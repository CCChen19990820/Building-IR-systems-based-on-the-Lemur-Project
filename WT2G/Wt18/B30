VOCs are one of the primary ingredients in the formation of ground-levelozone (smog), the most pervasive air pollutant in the United States. <BR><BR>Architectural coatings are commonly used by consumers and contractors andinclude products such as exterior and interior house paints, highway andtraffic paints, primers, industrial maintenance coatings and wood and roofcoatings. The architectural and industrial maintenance coatings or &quot;AIM&quot;rule would affect about 500 architectural coating manufacturers and importersnationwide. <BR><BR>Today's action is based on the pollution prevention method of product reformulation,instead of add-on control devices.The announced action will appear soonin the Federal Register, but will be computer-accessible immediately throughEPA's electronic bulletin board system, the Technology Transfer Network(TTN) at 919-541-5742 (backup number for access problems is 919-541-5384)under &quot;Recently Signed Rules,&quot; on the TTN's Clean Air Act Amendmentsbulletin board.

As a result, much of this waste was improperly managed. ... It isa much smaller scale repeat of the same thing we saw last year.&quot;<BR><BR>Snyder said that the latest violations do not pose any immediate environmentaldangers, and that the waste is contained within the facility. Though inspectorshave proposed fines of $5,385, the fine may be waived in keeping with theDEP's policy shift toward negotiated compliance.<BR><BR>&quot;In some ways, penalties are necessary to make a point with people,but to improve compliance in the community, there are a lot of waste moneycan be better spent than in penalties.&quot;</H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><BR><BR><BR><A NAME="anchor635511"></A><BR><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR><BR><A HREF="#anchor635511">Sewage truck leaks 2-mile sludge trail</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><H3>JACKSONVILLE--(EnviroWorld)-- A two-mile trail of sewage sludge froma leaking truck traveling through East Jacksonville yesterday caused thepartial closing of the Hart Bridge exit, the Times-Union reported.<BR><BR>The sludge had been chemically treated and was not a public health risk,said Lt.

It is important to get rid of any standing water whenever possible,whether it is in an old tire or a forgotten wading pool, Longo said. <BR><BR>Mosquitoes also pose a threat because of their ability to carry diseasessuch as malaria and encephalitis. </H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><BR><BR><BR><BR><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR></H3></BODY></HTML>

It is a similarity that could provide relief from theeconomic hardships of the net ban for Florida fishermen, but one that alsomakes environmentalists tense. <BR><BR>The Florida Department of Labor has provided $79,483 to train 80 fishermenhow to catch and process jellyfish this summer, in time for prime jellyfishharvesting beginning in August in the Gulfof Mexico. While officials believejellyfishing could be one answer for suffering fishermen, they say thatmistakes learned from the mullet roe market will be remembered.<BR><BR>The Asian taste for mullet roe was a primary cause for the depletion ofthe state's mullet population, and led to the push for a constitutionalban on large drift nets. Catching jellyfish does not require such nets,but the animals are important to the diet of marine turtles.<BR><BR>&quot;We're very concerned,&quot; Florida League of Anglers attorney CaseyGluckman told the Sentinel. &quot;Once you open a commercial harvest, peopleinvest in the business and it's hard to turn back.

It is a bacterial diseasethat causes cows to abort, decreases milk production and makes animals weakand arthritic. It can be spread to humans through tainted milk, causingthe undulant fever. <BR><BR>Only 46 livestock herds in the United States carry the disease, as comparedwith 124,000 infected herds in 1957.

The USDA has no control overthe wildlife herds and those will be the only ones left unchecked.<BR><BR>Ranchers are infuriated over the possibility of the bison reinfecting cattleherds. They are urging the government to round up the bison, test them anddestroy those that are infected. Wayne Brewster, Yellowstone's buffalo specialist,disagrees.

Palm Beach engineer JamesBowser said that three years of monitoring showed that the breakwater acceleratederosion. However, the Palm Beach reef was one continuous structure, allowingthe waves to wash sand around the sides.The Vero Beach structure will besegmented, allowing the space between the pieces to act as a sieve, allowingwater to gently return to the ocean. </H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><BR><BR><BR><A NAME="anchor11208139"></A><BR><BR><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR><A HREF="#anchor11208139">Companytries to gain public support for proposed cement plant</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><H3>NEWBERRY--(EnviroWorld)-- Florida Rock Industries officials are usinglow key civic meetings to gain community support for a proposed cement plant,the Gainesville Sun reported.

In fact, more then 70 manateesat a time have been seen gathering throughout the waterway's canals. <BR><BR>According to Kovens, the only reason he agreed to such a provision was becausethe deal he signed allowed him to come back to the commission to requestanother arrangement after the county's manatee-protection plan was finished.<BR><BR>In the meantime, while Kovens waited for the manatee plan to be developed,he constructed and sold 34 of 42 boat slips at about $70,000 each.<BR><BR>&quot;We look up and down this waterway and we see there are motorboatsall over, &quot; Kovens told the Herald. &quot;We are just 40 slips outof more than 1,000 on this waterway. Why should they only restrict us? We'rebeing discriminated against and it isn't fair.&quot;<BR><BR>Environmentalists are concerned about the Koven case because it is the firstchallenge to the manatee-protection plan since last November. There areonly about 2,600 manatees left in Florida, and speed-boats are the biggestman-made killer. About 80 percent of the living manatees are scarred bycollision with boat propellers, according to the Herald.<BR><BR>Using the guidelines set by the manatee plan, however, the county regulatorshave offered Kovens a chance to possibly allow nine powerboat slips on thecanal. That's one motor boat for every 100 feet of shore. <BR><BR>Kovens said the offer is not acceptable and plans to battle for years inthe courts if things don't go his way with the commission.</H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><BR><BR><BR><A NAME="anchor578057"></A><BR><BR><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR><A HREF="#anchor578057">Jupitermakes plans to add pathways to A1A for safety of cyclists and pedestrians</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><H3>JUPITER -- (EnviroWorld) -- In attempt to make A1A safer for bicyclistsand pedestrians, Jupiter is planning to proceed with a $3.3 million projectto beautify the state road, the Palm Beach Post reported.<BR><BR>The project will extend from Indiantown Road south to Juno Beach and willinclude construction of bike lanes, sidewalks, parking, landscaping anddune walkovers.

Cattails grow in thick stands that leave no room for wading birdsto feed. <BR><BR>The Everglades is a sawgrass community, naturally low in nutrients. It wasbelieved that farm runoff into the Everglades was allowing the cattailsto take over the sawgrass by introducing phosphorus and other nutrients.However, farmers in the farming region have reduced the amount of phosphorusthat flows into the Everglades by 30 percent in the past four years; thereduction rose to 68 percent last year. But the cattails are still spreading.<BR><BR>The presence of cattails, besides choking out the ecologically importantsawgrass, indicates many other less-visable changes in the Everglades. Theoxygen level declines and causes the disappearance of worms, snails andother small animals that make up the basis for the food chain. Another importantlink in the Everglades food chain, the spongy periphyton algae mat, disappearstwo miles ahead of the cattail invasion.<BR><BR>Scientists are debating whether phosphorus and other nutrients are to blamefor the cattail invasion. High water levels and the disturbance of the muckfrom airboat paths and trenches made by swamp buggies also help cattailstake over swamp grass. <BR><BR>Auburn University biologist Mike Maceina thinks that excess water from highrainfall the past few years may be a contributor. &quot;You can drown outsawgrass pretty easily,&quot; Maceina said. <BR><BR>Duke University Wetland Center Director Curtis Richardson, a researcherfor farmers, has conducted an experiment for five years in which he dumpedphosphorus on sawgrass. Cattails have not invaded, but they have grown ina nearby area where the muck soil is disturbed.</H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><BR><BR><BR><A NAME="anchor584550"></A><BR><BR><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR><A HREF="#anchor584550">Pesticideclause may be repealed</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><H3>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)-- The 38 year-old Delaney Clause of the Food,Drug and Cosmetic Act, which calls for a ban on cancer-causing substancesin food, may be repealed, the Tampa Tribune reported.

The manatee is uniquely adapted to the warm waters ofthe flood-and-drought cycles of the Amazon. When the water is high and foodabundant, an adult eats up to 110 pounds of water plants a day. In the dryseason, it can go for six months without food. <BR><BR>The manatee plays a crucial role in the Amazon food chain. <BR><BR>&quot;It transforms up to 40 percent of its food into smaller particlesand nutrients that feed many fish, micro-organisms and phytoplankton,&quot;da Silve said.<BR><BR>The manatee has been protected in Brazil since 1967, but poaching is a problem.Manatee oil is used for cooking and in home remedies. The meat, fried andstored in its own fat, is a dish much appreciated in the Amazon interiorbecause it keeps for months without refrigeration.

SaveOur Everglades is pushing for an initiative that would give voters the chanceto decide who should pay to clean and restore the Everglades.

Though the industry only employees16,000 people, industry officials say that for every person directly employeedby Florida sugar growers another 1.5 jobs are generated elsewhere in SouthFlorida. Their figures claim that sugar averages $60.87 per-acre profit--0.7 cents a pound. <BR><BR>Florida's privately held sugar companies are not required to disclose theirearnings. But, some economists say that sugar industry claims are &quot;widelyexaggerated&quot;, according to the Palm Beach Post.

MARYS -- (EnviroWorld) -- Motorboats are the biggest cause of deathfor manatees, but while speed limits may give boaters more time to lookout for the endangered animal, slower-moving boats may be more difficultfor the manatee to hear, the Florida Times-Union reported.<BR><BR>Scientists working under a Defense Department grant in King's Bay are developinga device that would attach to boats and emit a band of high-frequency soundthat manatees might learn to associate with an approaching propeller.<BR><BR>Scientists Edmund Gerstein and Joseph Blue have been using underwater microphonesto study underwater noise in manatee habitats. Gerstein, who directs marinemammal research at Florida Atlantic University, told the Times-Union thatmanatees don't hear low frequencies well. Since slow-moving boats emit lowersound frequencies, &quot;Boats are unsafe at any speed,&quot; he said.<BR><BR>&quot;A manatee needs about 200 feet to hear an oncoming boat and get outof the way,&quot; Gerstein said.<BR><BR>Gerstein and Blue's device is a 2-by-4 inch transmitter, which the pairhave been fine-tuning to avoid negative impacts on the manatee.<BR><BR>&quot;We don't want it to be so intense it hurts the animal,&quot; Bluetold the Times-Union. &quot;We wouldn't want to do anything to change theirbehavior patterns.&quot;<BR><BR>The waterways that humans might think would be noisy to a manatee, may actuallybe quiet. The manatees are more likely to hear the noise of the large snappingshrimp population in King's bay, which doesn't have a high-volume of recreationboats, than they are to hear the props on a busy river.<BR><BR>Gerstein said that manatees would have to learn to associate the sound ofthe transmitter with a dangerous boat, but that the animals were intelligentenough to figure it out quickly.

The Agency already sends between 81% and 89% ofLUST money annually to the states, and setting a mandated amount would interferewith the EPA's ability to &quot;protect human health and the environmentthrough management, oversight and enforcement...,&quot; according to Mathews'testimony.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR><A NAME="anchor3664704"></A><BR><BR><H3><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines<BR></A><HR><A HREF="#anchor3664704">Anti-tax group won't sell names on petitions</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--An anti-tax group Monday decidednot to make money by selling names collected on petitions after learningthat signers hated the idea, The Associated Press reported.<BR><BR>David Biddulph, head of the Tax Cap Committee, said he changed his mindafter reading an Associated Press article quoting people in Tallahasseewho objected to their names and addresses being sold to direct-mail andother political organizations.<BR><BR>His plan would not have violated any laws.

In February and March, an estimatedsix tons of frogs were taken from Big Cypress. <BR><BR>This, say the environmentalists, is not the only problem. The boats squashmarsh grass, which sustains a long food chain in the Everglades. The marshgrass is home to such species as the endangered Cape sable seaside sparrow,the wood stork and the snail kite hawk.<BR><BR>Brian Hunt of the Florida Biodiversity project is concerned because &quot;thepark knew about the damage and did nothing to protect the resources.

Sierra Club attorney Thomas Reese told the Times that&quot;Suburbanization definitely has an effect on natural populations byreducing diversity.

The270-acre Big Fish drained completely in 1990, coinciding with an increasein pumping from the wellfield. The radar studies revealed that Big Fish,Lake Iola, Camp Lake and Lake Merrywhether lack clay layers beneath thelake bottom. Instead the lakes have &quot;raveling sand zones&quot; whichallow water to quickly seep down to the aquifer. As a result, those lakes'water levels are closely tied to aquifer levels.<BR><BR>Lake Alice, Horse Lake, Lake Calm and East Lake were less closely connectedto the aquifer.<BR><BR>The study provides evidence to the contention of the Southwest Florida WaterManagement District that the pumping of water to meet the needs of PinellasCounty and western Hillsborough County has damaged the environment.

The real dangercomes from the island's wild hogs. Kirkland said the deer increasingly competefor food with the hog population. The hogs, which were brought to the islandby settlers, threaten the islands wildlife. Kirkland said they uproot seedlingsand flowers, and raid sea turtle nests. The hogs have no natural predatorsso the hunts help control the hog populations, Kirkland said, so the residentsrarely complain.</H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><BR><A NAME="anchor672154"></A><BR><BR><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines<BR></A><HR><A HREF="#anchor672154">Residential Robin Hood prosecuted for killinggator</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><H3>LARGO -- (EnviroWorld) -- The alligator in Lester and Hermine Smith'sretention pond edged closer and closer to their door -- and to their poodle,Pearl.

That could cost the lives of many fish, Rosen said.<BR><BR>The organisms prosper in hot, dry water and float to the top of the surfacein bright, sunny weather.

At 390 feet above sea level, the 330-foottall mound will spread across 2,400 acres and will even reach higher thanmost Florida buildings.<BR><BR>Last Friday, the Department of Environmental Protection ended 10 monthsof review and gave approval to the Chambers Development Co.'s overall plansfor the site. Though some permits still must be obtained, the company'splans exceed current landfill regulations. For example, the dump's syntheticliner is twice as thick as required.<BR><BR>Now, the landfill only occupies 48 acres and is 140 feet above sea level.The rest of the land is leased out for cattle grazing. Chambers obtainedthe rights to build the regional landfill in 1992 when the town sold itsown small and outdated landfill. In exchange for those rights, Chambersagreed to pay host fees -- so far amounting to $1.5 to $2 million -- tothe town. Those benefits and others have led to a reduction in propertytaxes and several improvements in infrastructure and recreational facilities.<BR><BR>But it's still a landfill, and residents downwind already complain of thestink. St. Lucie County County officials, which borders the landfill, haveraised concerns about runoff and is considering protesting the DEP permit.<BR><BR>&quot;We get no economic benefit whatsoever from their landfill,&quot; St.Lucie County Commission Chairman Cliff Barnes told the Post, &quot;The lastthing we want is their poison.&quot;<BR><BR>Okeechobee officials are less worried.<BR><BR>&quot;If it's landscaped and terraced and grassed and has trees standingaround it, I don't know if it would look any different from Kennesaw orStone Mountain (Ga.),&quot; Okeechobee County Commission Chairman CliffBetts, Jr. said.<BR><BR>Still, the commission may impose a height restriction on the landfill. Economically,it's in the best interests of Chambers to build the dump as high as possiblebecause of the high cost of lining a landfill cell -- $250,000 per cellaccording to a company engineer.<BR><BR>The dump should have little problem attracting customers. Tipping fees thereare cheap (Okeechobee residents are charged $24 a ton, compared to $55.75a ton at their old dump), and the landfill has its own public relationsconsultant.</H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><BR><BR><A NAME="anchor964494"></A><BR><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines<BR></A><HR><A HREF="#anchor964494">Lake quality an issue in Leon County race</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><H3>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- With one lake seriously polluted andseveral others at risk, southwestern Leon County's natural resources andfuture development are a big issue in a county commission race, the TallahasseeDemocrat reported.<BR><BR>Lake Munson, which receives stormwater runoff from downtown Tallahassee,has a history of problems with bacteria, weeds and odor, and has been targetedto receive part of a proposed sales tax extension.

Yet few could consistently find the snails. Phil Darbyand Patty Valentine did so by attaching radio transmitters the size of watermelonseeds to some snails, then following them through the Florida marshes.<BR><BR>They found the snails actually moved fairly long distances. &quot;Everyonehad thought the snail might move to get to deeper water,&quot; said Darby,a doctoral student at the University of Florida. &quot;But they were actuallymoving to mate or to lay eggs.&quot; At the suggestion of a state biologistthey began using simple crayfish traps baited with female apple snails.The catch was unbelievable-- more than 500 snails in five days.<BR><BR>The snails became the heart of an experiment to see how well they couldendure dramatic changes in water levels. Understanding the snail's abilityto survive severe drawdowns of water in canals and impounded marshes isa bottom line issue in the Everglades.

Scientists have suspected that ozone depletion in that lowerregion, the lower stratosphere, may be partially or wholly responsible forthe cooling trend.<BR><BR>The high altitude cooling isn't an environmental threat, because temperaturesin the lower stratosphere have little to do with climate patterns near theEarth's surface. But understanding the cooling and what's causing it willhelp atmospheric scientists in studying global warming and other importantphenomena.<BR><BR>Based on a computer simulation, three researchers now argue that ozone depletionis, in fact, the cause of the lower-stratosphere cooling trend. Telltalepatterns, such as greater temperature drops in the spring and over polarregions, seem to mirror the ozone destruction process.</H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><BR><BR><BR><A NAME="anchor694031"></A><BR><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines<BR></A><HR><A HREF="#anchor694031">OSHA investigates fuel tank blast</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><H3>TARPON SPRINGS--(EnviroWorld)-- The Occupational Safety and Health Administrationis investigating a fuel tank explosion that seriously injured two scrapmetal workers Monday, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR><BR>Lawrence Falck, an area director for OSHA, said investigators will determinethe cause of the explosion and whether any OSHA rules were violated at thesalvage company Hurt Scrap Metal and Salvage off Anclote Road in TarponSprings.<BR><BR>Authorities say the men, David Lindenmayer, 28, and Michael Bear, 31, wereusing a torch to cut a boat fuel tank when the flames ignited gasoline fumesremaining in the 100-gallon container.<BR><BR>According to OHSA standards, no welding or cutting should be performed ona used tank until it has been &quot;cleaned so thoroughly as to make absolutelycertain&quot; that there are no flammable materials or vapors present.</H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><BR><A NAME="anchor695187"></A><BR><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines<BR></A><HR><A HREF="#anchor695187">Gator attacks watercraft</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><H3>ORMOND BEACH--(EnviroWorld)-- Ray Smith of Ormond Beach and Sherry Taylorwere aboard his idling Yamaha Wave Rider on the Tomoka River Sunday whenthey saw a rush of water and felt their 470-pound watercraft begin to tipbackward, The Associated Press reported.<BR><BR>Although no one actually saw the gator bite the watercraft, teeth marksand some tiny bone fragments left no doubt about the attacker.<BR><BR>Typically, alligators shy away from humans, said Lt.

An investigation lastingmonths was completed by police last week and turned over to the BrowardState Attorney's Office, where it will determine whether to file chargesby the end of this week.<BR><BR>One of the key components discovered in the investigation is aerial photographstaken for survey purposes, which indicate that dumping did not occur onthe Hampshire Homes property until Lennar began developing the land, policesaid.<BR><BR>A 1985 photo shows a cluster of Australian pines in what is now the commonarea for the subdivision, but no debris. By 1987, land development was underwayand all the trees were gone. Then in 1988, a photo taken on Jan. 22 showsthe common area was being graded by heavy equipment in a west to east direction,leaving tire marks, police told the Sun-Sentinel. A portion of the commonarea had water, debris, wood and miscellaneous rubbish. Finally, a December1988 photo shows no remaining debris.<BR><BR>Lennar officials said any construction debris was buried in accordance withthe law. Developers in Broward County are allowed to bury &quot;clean,&quot;nontoxic debris, which poses no environmental hazards, but tires are prohibitedand were discovered in the Hampshire Homes pileup.<BR><BR>Other findings within the investigation include copies of receipts thatindicate Lennar paid A.

Fishermen have sewn hundredsof yards of tarp onto the small nets still permitted by the year-old ban.The tarp is draped in the water like a giant plastic corral.<BR><BR>Ropes are cinched slowly, forcing water out through a small strip of net.As the corral shrinks, trapped fish are herded into a shrinking area besidea waiting boat.<BR><BR>Florida's net ban is not a complete prohibition against fishing with nets.It is a constitutional amendment, enacted by referendum, that forbids largecommercial fishing nets in specified areas.<BR><BR>In the Gulf of Mexico, the traditional gill nets of mullet fishermen areforbidden within nine miles of the Florida coast. Purse seines, which encirclebait fish, are illegal within three miles. Nets smaller than 500 squarefeet remain legal throughout Florida waters.<BR><BR>A judge recently ruled that the net ban does not cover tarps, and the rulingis being appealed. But commercial fishermen saw an opportunity.<BR><BR>Conservationists, however, call the homemade gear an evasion of the netban - and potentially much more damaging to the marine environment thanthe prohibited nets.</H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><BR><BR><A NAME="anchor834515"></A><BR><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines<BR></A><HR><A HREF="#anchor834515">Lantana council OKs sale of former landfill</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><H3>LANTANA -- (EnviroWorld) -- Ending a 2 1/2 year debate, earlier thisweek council members approved the sale of a former landfill in Lantana for$2.65 million, the Palm Beach Post reported.<BR><BR>Under the contract, Stewart Marcus, trustee for HealthTrust America of Hollywood,Fla., may use half of the waterfront property to build a 310-unit adultcongregate living facility.

Instead, the judge's award worksout to just under $3,900 per hour.<BR><BR>Law firm founding partner Toby Brigham said the $12 million figure was fairand reasonable, given the quality of work by the 10 lawyers on his team.Witnesses testifying on behalf of the law firm, including former SupremeCourt Justice Arthur England, said a fee between $12 million and $15 millionwas reasonable for this type of eminent domain case.<BR><BR>Since 1990, the state had been trying to acquire 20,000 acres of coastalpeninsula between Panama City Beach and Ft. Walton Beach known as TopsailHill.<BR><BR>Negotiators for the state and St. Joe Paper agreed on a price of $45 millionfor two key miles of beachfront, but that was rejected by the Cabinet. <BR><BR>The state then pressured Walton County into decreasing the allowable densityof development on the land in the area from 22 units per acre to one unitper five acres, which greatly reduced the value of St. Joe's land. The statethen offered $25 million for the tract.</H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><BR><BR><BR><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines<BR></A><HR></H3><BR></BODY></HTML>

LUCIE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Atlantic Gulf Communities is lookingfor a bigger market and wants the city to rezone undeveloped property tocommercial, the Ft. Pierce Tribune reported. <BR><BR>AGC has sold about 900 acres since last year and has 4,000 acres left tosell. With the exception of a 1,200 acre tract dubbed River Trace, mostof AGC's properties lie in small, isolated pockets throughout the city.Of that land, about 30 parcels totaling 90 acres is designated open spacerecreation -- undeveloped green spaces highly valued by city planners andresidents.<BR><BR>The company wants the city to change the land use on those parcels to allowcommercial development, which would make the land easier to sell at a muchhigher price. A spokesman for the city said, &quot;I think the AGC is wayoff base, they used these lands as a selling tool and now they're tryingto put in general commercial in areas where it is inappropriate.&quot; <BR><BR>Charles Heartsfield, AGC's director of project management, said residentsshould not assume the land has been set aside for parks and that AGC issimply pursuing its rights under law. The land is private property and notfor public use, he added.<BR><BR>City planners see the rezoning as a two-fold problem. Either AGC asks thecity to rezone parcels in a residential neighborhood or it doesn't adequatelycompensate the city for its loss of green space. Planning Director SteveBall said if AGC wants to rezone its recreational tracts it will have togive up similar land somewhere else. <BR><BR>AGC attorney Jack Spira said such deals amount to &quot;contract zoning&quot;and are against the law. AGC also has objected to how the city plans todrag out the 44 rezoning requests over a three year period. </H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><BR><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines<BR></A><HR></H3><BR></BODY></HTML>

In 1990, Flagler County addeda one cent sales tax for a $9.1 million bond issue to pay for landfill improvementsand a new landfill. A year after the bond was approved, though, the countymade a deal with Volusia County to use their landfills. <BR><BR>The fund has now grown to $12 million. The county can not spend the moneybecause the bond language allows the money to be used only for a landfill.Commission Chairman Jim Darby proposed putting the issue on the ballot andletting tax payers decide what to do with the money. He has suggested usingthe money to pay off previous bond issues, build a new library, and variousother county improvements. The commission rejected his suggestion that theyput the issue on the ballot, but they plan to take his list of improvementsto the circuit court for approval. </H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><BR><A NAME="anchor60561"></A><BR><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR><A HREF="#anchor60561">WestPalm mayor appoints new drainage system manager</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><H3>WEST PALM BEACH--(EnviroWorld)-- Mayor Nancy Graham has given controlof the storm-water utility to Utility Director Erik Olson, the Palm BeachPost reported.

Gov. Buddy MacKay (D) advocated making sugar companiespay for restoring the Everglades. Although MacKay, who did not attend Mondaynight's festivities, used a short nationally televised speech to the DemocraticNational Convention to promote environmental protection, he was nearly aloneamong the Floridians gathered at the Chicago meetings in his stance againstBig Sugar. Other Florida delegates embraced the industry, which donated$5,000 towards the party held at an lavish hotel ballroom.<BR><BR>&quot;Just because we care about the Everglades and the environment doesnot mean we're not pro-business,&quot; said Terrie Brady, the state Democraticchairwoman.<BR><BR>While Jeff Ryan, leader of the Florida delegation's fundraising efforts,didn't solicit contributions from tobacco firms, seeking money from thesugar companies was only natural, &quot;They've been helping us,&quot; hesaid. &quot;They've been partners for years.&quot; <BR><BR>Regardless of the loyalty between the organizations in business, the Democratsdrew criticism from Save Our Everglades, an organization pushing the proposedamendment that would place a penny-a-pound tax on raw sugar to pay for Evergladescleanup.

Most recently, workers performing an inspection Aug. 14 foundthree switches glued shut in a backup control room. Three weeks earlier,glue was found in nine padlocks and two door locks.<BR><BR>Since there was no indication of intruders, the obvious conclusion is thatan insider with high security clearance is the culprit.

Inhis 35 years of consulting, he has seen it with 5 to 10 percent of his clients.<BR><BR>&quot;It's not statistically analyzed because companies don't report it,and it's not reported because they don't want it to spread,&quot; he said.<BR><BR>The gluing is an exception because the plant declared a low-level emergency,which must be reported to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The NRC conducteda thorough inspection of the plant and is meeting with management on plansto improve St. Lucie's performance.<BR><BR>St. Lucie was formerly a model of safety performance, earning awards andrecognition for their quality. Since 1993, they have had troubles in maintenanceand operations.

The most controversial of the initiatives is a penny-per-poundtax on sugar production that would be designated for Everglades cleanupprojects.<BR>At press time, the proposed amendments still had to pass muster before thestate Supreme Court. The court will hear arguments from the opposing interests,and if it decides to allow the initiatives on the ballot, get ready fora two-month onslaught of slick public relations efforts likely to test thegag reflex of 7,762,732 voters.<BR>Already, both sides have gone on the attack. The Save Our Everglades campaign,which organized the petition drive to get the initiatives on the ballot,promotes an outdated image of a plantation-style sugar industry that wantonlypollutes the environment. Meanwhile, the sugar industry has taken to personalattacks on Mary Barley, the outspoken and wealthy leader of Save Our Everglades.<BR>The political campaign is unlikely to clarify the issue for voters, butto vote responsibly on the tax - a one cent levy for every pound of sugarprocessed in the state during the next 25 years - demands an informed opinionon a complicated issue. Taken at face value, the penny-tax would be a significantsource of Everglades cleanup revenue that environmental officials and legislatorswould depend on for a generation. It is critical then, that the sugar industryactually be able to pay the tax. Like it or not, forcing sugar to pay amajor chunk of the Everglades tab requires that the industry remain profitablefor a long time.<BR>&quot;We're looking towards a sustainable sugar industry -- we're not tryingto run them out of business,&quot; said Save Our Everglades spokesman TomSadler. <BR>People who make a living from the sugar industry in the vast EvergladesAgricultural Area have a tough time believing that statement.<BR>&quot;That political group's purpose is to put sugar out of business,&quot;said Judy Sanchez, the U.S. Sugar Corporation's Director of Communications.<BR>Unquestionably, agricultural practices in the EAA have created a massiveproblem in the Everglades. Exposing the rich muck of the area to oxygenresults in a rapid decomposition of organic matter which in turn, releasesthe soil's nutrients. The most significant of these minerals is phosphorous- a critical plant nutrient that is often in the shortest supply in ecosystems,earning it the label &quot;limiting nutrient.&quot; That is, plant growthis limited by the amount of phosphorous available. A stable plant community,such as the sawgrass plains of the Everglades before the 1900's, is delicatelytuned to certain levels of limiting nutrients.<BR>The Everglades system is so delicate that adding phosphorous on a scalemeasured in parts per billion has contributed to an alteration of the landscapemeasured in hundreds of thousands of acres.<BR>&quot;What we do know is they are the largest contributor to Evergladespollution,&quot; said Save Our Everglades' Barley. That's not an easy contentionto prove. <BR>Phosphorous pollution also comes from a number of urban sources, and itisn't the only problem. The megalopolis of South Florida could not existwithout the canals that lace the living land like the neat gashes of a vivisection.Those canals, so crucial to keeping coastal developments dry and Everglades'farms productive, are also a major factor in the damage.<BR>&quot;Farming, yes, is a part of it, but it's not the biggest part and it'snot the only part of it,&quot; said Judy Sanchez, the U.S. Sugar Corporation'sDirector of Communications. &quot;Why is it that only sugar farms have togo back and retroactively pay?&quot;<BR>It's a good question. Though the industry has caused far more damage than&quot;making a few cattails grow,&quot; as Sanchez tries to spin, the sugarindustry is taking steps to reduce its impacts on the environment underthe requirements of 1994's Everglades Forever Act. South Florida's developerscertainly aren't making any bold strides at minimizing their impact. Butthat piece of legislation only begins to address Sugar's stamp on the land.<BR>Restoration of the Everglades is in its infancy. Though a number of projectswill be tried, from filtration marshes and plant eradication programs tomitigation banks and rebending the Kissimmee River, the only guarantee isthat it will cost in the range of a few billion dollars. <BR>Barley estimates about 20 percent of sugar farmland would have to be convertedto filtering marshes to properly clean up the water.<BR>Meanwhile Sugar is touting a recent press release from the South FloridaWater Management District that cites a 68 percent reduction in phosphatelevels in sugar field runoff last year.<BR>However, a look at the District's own report reveals that only 46 percentof the farmlands were evaluated and, as such, &quot;any data evaluationconducted at this time would provide inconclusive and possibly misleadinginterpretations,&quot; the report states.<BR>An unabashed SFWMD information flak declared, &quot;We didn't want peopleto think this wasn't good news, because it is good news,&quot; said JohnNeuharth. &quot;Regardless, the validity is that they have made a 68 percentreduction.&quot;<BR>Whatever that means, in the future other groups will likely have to helppay for the cleanup-and that will be another sour pill to swallow.<BR>Part of the move to make Sugar pay now is that it faces an uncertain, andpossibly short future regardless of economic sanctions. <BR>The same process that liberates phosphorous and other nutrients from thedrained soils - and grows sugarcane- also consumes the soil itself.<BR>It is a problem called subsidence and already the EAA, which once had tractor-swallowingmuck 10 feet deep, has lost more than half its soil depth. During the 1970's,it was calculated that EAA soil was disappearing at the rate of one inchper year. At the time, it was predicted that 87 percent of the area's soilwould be less than 3 feet deep by the year 2,000, half of that less thanone foot deep.<BR>Of course farmers do have the common sense to preserve their land, and theyhave adopted practices, such as keeping water tables higher and rotatingsugar crops with rice, which slow the loss of soil. Still, the rate of subsidenceis greater than one-half inch per year, and no matter what is done, theland will not last forever.<BR>&quot;My guess is that, in our life and our children's, sugar will stillbe there. In 100 years, nobody knows,&quot; predicts Dr. Peter Rosendahl,the Vice President of Environmental Affairs for the Flo-Sun Corporation.<BR>Others are less optimistic. And proponents of the penny-per-pound tax believethat the timing won't get any better. <BR>But whether a penny-a-pound is a fair share really can't be answered. Itis nearly as difficult to determine whether the industry could afford it.<BR>To Sadler, sugar producers are the beneficiaries of a price control system&quot;that's a direct transfer of wealth out of the pockets of taxpayersinto the sugar producers.&quot;<BR>Yet, while farming sugar has been a profitable business, and it does enjoya government-imposed market stability, the sugar industry is not only inthe hands of a few rich sugar barons. Several thousand people make a livingdirectly from the Florida sugar industry, and most of the $400 million to$500 million in annual sugar revenues stays within the local economy. <BR>Barley counters that thousands more make a living directly or indirectlyfrom a healthy, vibrant Everglades-and Sugar's trying to put them out ofbusiness.<BR>One root question for voters is how much profit does a pound of sugar bring.Don't expect a straight answer from your TV screen. <BR>A 1991 study of the economics of sugarcane production, by Jose Alvarez andThomas Schueneman of the University of Florida, estimated that a representative640-acre sugar farm in the EAA earned a net profit of 2.95 cents per pound.The total profit for the farmer was $152,196. Thus, the penny tax wouldtake about $50,000 of that farmer's earnings.<BR>In all the tax would generate $35 million from a typical EAA sugar cropof 1.75 million tons. Certainly, the tax is a heavy one, but the wordingof the proposed amendment makes it clear who the intended target is: &quot;TheSouth Florida Water Management District ... shall levy a fee ... of onecent per pound of raw sugar, assessed against each first processor , fromsugarcane grown in the Everglades Agricultural Area.&quot; <BR>Thus the tax is specifically aimed at Big Sugar - the seven mills in theEAA that process crops. Those mills are held by three companies: The SugarCane Growers Co-operative, U.S. Sugar,and Flo-Sun, Inc.<BR>If voters approve the tax, those companies predict a dim future for sugar.<BR>But the sugar industry, masters of obstructionist tactics, won't simplyroll over.<BR>&quot;Obviously, the first thing (we would challenge) is the constitutionalityof this. I'm sure it would be tied up for a long time,&quot; said Sanchez.<BR>Also sure to come would be political maneuvers. The sugar industry has areputation for greasing the wheel in Washington - a practice that seemsto have paid off in the past. In the first half of 1995, when the sugarsubsidy was up for renewal in the farm bill, sugar PAC's gave more thanhalf a million dollars to congressional members.<BR>&quot;We're simply talking to our elected officials,&quot; said Sanchez.&quot;We're up against a huge group of commercial sugar users who want cheapersugar.&quot; <BR>But Sanchez acknowledged that &quot;we know how to play the game.&quot;Sadler said it was precisely that reason that Save Our Everglades decidedto try getting a proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot.<BR>&quot;We tried everything else,&quot; Sadler said. &quot;(But) They've alsopolluted our political structure.&quot;<BR>Critics worry that constitutional amendments are a dangerous way to decidesuch issues. If a flaw was found the problem couldn't be as easily fixedas a legislative foul-up.<BR>&quot;Once you put something in the Constitution ... the task [to get itout] would be so prohibitive, it would be almost impossible to do,&quot;warned Sanchez.<BR>But if passed, the tax would expire in 25 years. <BR>Hopefully, the Everglades hasn't expired in the meantime.</H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><BR><A NAME="anchor837799"></A><BR><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR><A HREF="#anchor837799">DEPsays tanks program shuffle not driven by political deals</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><H3>GAINESVILLE--(A Florida Environments Exclusive)--by Dave Newport, Editor--Justas Florida's beleaguered underground tanks cleanup program is showing signsof life under a new system, state environmental officials are breaking theprogram apart and replacing its leader with an employee who has no previoustanks-related experience. Though some question why certain personnel wereshifted around, state environmental officials deny the moves are politicallymotivated.<BR>The Florida Department of Environmental Protection's Bureau of Waste Cleanupwill be split into two separate Bureaus. One Bureau will oversee tanks work,and the other will administer all other types of cleanups.<BR>Longtime Bureau Chief Doug Jones will be transferred out of the Bureau thatoversees tanks cleanups. <BR>DEP's spokesperson Joy Mills said &quot;people are dissatisfied with themanagement of the program&quot; as the reason for Jones' transfer.<BR>&quot;The problem is not in the technical analysis of sites, but in themanagement of the program,&quot; she told Florida Environments. New managementis needed, Mills said, &quot;to get the program moving.&quot; The new organizationalstructure is needed, &quot;To correct the problems we've had in the past,&quot;according to Mills.<BR>Jones said he's proud of the job he's done. &quot;I've managed a programthat is in constant change. Now we're moving well towards a fully functionalpreapproval system. &quot;<BR>Jones has been with the Bureau since the tanks program first began in themid-1980s. During that time, Jones has been at the center of much wranglingin a program that pays out over $160 million a year in cleanup funds. Someveteran tanks program observers see Jones as the program's savior; somesee him as the source of the problem. <BR>In the end, Jones' naysayers may have powerful allies in the Legislature.<BR>Sources tell Florida Environments that Legislative leaders held this year'stanks cleanup bill hostage until DEP agreed to remove Jones from his job.<BR>DEP assistant secretary Dale Patchett would only state he had &quot;no comment&quot;when asked if that was true.<BR>Jones is philosophical about the change, saying he's looking forward togetting some of his life back now that the demands on his time won't beso rigorous. <BR><BR>--The Sole person qualified?--<BR>The odds-on favorite for the new Bureau chief job is Mike Sole, a BiologicalAdministrator III who works in the Department's Marine Resources Divisionmarine turtle section. Sole now supervises 3 people in a bureau sectionthat has a $400,000 budget.<BR>Sole has no experience in tanks cleanup although he was a hazardous wasteofficer for about two years as a First Lieutenant in the Marine Corps. Millscalls Sole's experience &quot;quite adequate&quot; for the job. He has aBS in Marine Biology earned in 1986.<BR>Sole, who was tapped for the Bureau chief job by Dale Patchett, said he's&quot;confident I can readily fill the requirements of the job.&quot; Solefully realizes that he's stepping into perhaps the most contentious Bureauchief job at the Department.<BR>&quot;The controversy definitely keeps it skylined,&quot; he said.<BR>Sole, who sources say turned down the job the first time it was offered,will be hired without a nationwide search. Patchett allows he only interviewedtwo other possible candidates but he refused to name them.<BR>Patchett said Sole will be hired for the management expertise he demonstratedin the military.<BR>&quot;He's quick, bright, task oriented and used to controversy,&quot; Patchetttold FE.<BR>A nationwide search was not used because, &quot;It would divert attentionand effort from the functions we were assigned under that bill,&quot; Patchettsaid. <BR>Sole will oversee about 75 people and a $160 million per year budget.<BR>Some point to Sole's father, Joe Sole, an aide to state Comptroller RobertF. Milligan (R-Tallahassee), as one reason for the appointment. <BR>Mike Sole, then a Captain, served under then General, now Comptroller Milliganin the Desert Storm war.<BR>So what's in it for DEP?<BR>Patchett is in charge of two hot issues at DEP: tanks and the restorationof north Florida's Oklawaha River. <BR>The Oklawaha project turns, in part, on questions about DEP's legal authorityto fund restoration of the river. DEP and Attorney General Bob Butterworthsay &quot;yes.&quot; Last month, the Comptroller said &quot;no&quot; toDEP spending even $100 on the Oklawaha project.<BR>Mills rejected the idea that Sole was hired in order to shmooze the Comptroller'soffice.<BR>&quot;If it was a deal, we got screwed,&quot; she said.<BR>&quot;What's he supposed to do: not get this promotion because his dad'sgot this job?&quot; Mills queried.<BR>Patchett bristled at the suggestion.<BR>&quot;I don't believe in that kind of crap,&quot; he told Florida Environments.<BR>Either way, Sole's predecessor says he'll help him if he's asked to-andSole said he's planned to ask Jones for lots of help.<BR>But &quot;he certainly is going to have a steep learning curve,&quot; DougJones said. &quot; It can be done, but it's going to be really rough forhim over the next year.&quot;<BR>Patchett conceded that staff changes could produce delays, and &quot;Ifthey fail, Lord help them-they may not come back alive from the Legislature.&quot;<BR>If DEP does fail to implement the new tanks program, look for calls to privatizethe program to become deafening.<BR>&quot;After the backlog's paid off, perhaps by July next year, privatizationis an option,&quot; said Patchett.<BR><BR>--A midsummer's day nightmare--<BR>DEP was called onto the carpet last month by state House and Senate NaturalResources committee Chairman. In an early August meeting, briefings on thetanks program's status were given to Rep. Everett Kelley and Sen. Rick Dantzlerby state environmental and finance staffers. <BR>Officials from the state Division of Bond Finance held forth on the projectedtime line and potential difficulties with setting up the Inland ProtectionFinancing Corporation. The Legislature mandated the IPFC to float a bondand pay off the backlog of tanks cleanup cost reimbursement applicationsnow some $300 million in arrears.<BR>The best guess of the finance staffers was that cash flow to payoff thebacklog will begin no later than May of 1997. <BR>If the legal work is delayed or the bond difficult to float, the DEP willhave to dip into its cash for new cleanup work now set for distributionunder the preapproval system. About $3.3 million a month is set to be spenton new work next year, Jones estimated. If the IPFC or the bond is delayed,contractors could see new cleanup work orders dry up next June. What happensafter that, &quot;is up to the Legislature,&quot; Jones said.<BR>Another wild card in the process surrounds, &quot;How many semi-truck loadsof reimbursement applications we get delivered to us by December 31,&quot;DEP's Patchett told the politicians.<BR>Under the new cleanup law, contractors have until 12/31/96 to apply forreimbursement for cleanup work done before that program was eliminated lastyear. DEP has made some preliminary estimates that the reimbursement backlogwill be about $325 million by year's end.<BR>&quot;If I were a contractor, I'd put everything- the kitchen sink-in thoseapplications,&quot; Dantzler told DEP while admonishing them to be vigilantin their reviews of the late applications.<BR><BR>--It went downhill from there--<BR>After the briefings, Dantzler led a charge of criticisms from tanks cleanupcontractors and Oil industry officials aimed at DEP's tanks cleanup performanceand personnel.<BR>&quot;There are lingering concerns that micro-management is still goingon&quot; in the tanks program, Dantzler fired at Patchett. And &quot;someof your personnel don't have the expertise necessary to question the judgmentsof [private sector] cleanup professionals.&quot;<BR>Patchett countered that DEP was by law compelled to balance the books andso our &quot;auditors are bean counters-they like everything to line up.&quot;<BR>But Patchett conceded the expertise issue although with the reorganizationand new training, &quot;our expertise will be better in six months.&quot;<BR>Jones stated that he felt &quot;pressure to rubber stamp things and I'mconcerned about that pressure.&quot;<BR>After about two hours of this, Dantzler said the group would reconvene afterthe elections for another &quot;update.&quot;<BR><BR>--Technical advisors tapped--<BR>DEP also last month finalized the roster for the Tanks Cleanup TechnicalAdvisory Committee. That group has been tapped to review new risk-basedcleanup practices and evaluate new technologies for tanks cleanup.<BR>The roster includes: Tom Herbert, Chairman; Glenn MacGraw, Tallahassee;Victor Kremesec, Amoco; Mark Malander, Mobil; Bruce Nocita, Clearwater;Lee Killinger, a former DEP lobbyist; Bob Boyd, Tallahassee attorney; BobBass, tanks consultant; Greg Self, tanks consultant; Wilbur Mayorga, DadeCounty Environmental; Juliet Gridley, Florida Power; Jay Nordqvist, LawEngineering; and Cris Teaf, a Tallahassee toxicologist.</H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><BR><BR><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR></H3></BODY></HTML>

TheSave Our Everglades Committee gathered the 429,428 signatures needed toplace their Everglades cleanup referendum before voters , but they stillmust get four of seven Florida Supreme Court judges to approve the amendmentfor it to appear on the ballot.<BR><BR>Save Our Everglades wants to impose a penny-per-pound tax on the sugar industryto fund the cleanup of the Everglades. They claim that the sugar industryis responsible for the destruction of the Everglades and should pay forits cleanup. Sugar supporters say that the sugar industry pays its fairshare of cleanup under the law and that they have lowered the amount ofhabitat-altering substances that enter the Everglades. They say state lawsare working and a tax should not enter the Florida Constitution.<BR><BR>Save Our Everglades proposes three amendments. One is the penny-per-poundtax that would carry for the next 25 years, hopefully raising $25 to $30million each year. The second amendment creates a state account to holdthe money for cleanup. The third states that Everglades polluters must payfor the damage they inflict.<BR><BR>Sugar lawyers claim the questions are misleading and deal with more thanone issue, which violates the constitutional rule of placing issues togetherto hide unpopular ideas under popular ones. They claim there is more thanone idea because the amendment imposes a tax and instructs what will bedone with it. They believe voters will be stuck voting for a tax they donot want because they want the Everglades cleaned up.<BR><BR>Opponents of the tax have a list of things that are wrong with the amendments.They say the forms were never approved by the Department of State and thatthe wording does not clearly identify what part of the constitution willbe affected. They claim the amendments were changed during the petitionprocess. <BR><BR>Bruce Rogow, a sugar lawyer who led the 1994 sugar victory, says that theamendments are a ploy to slip the 1994 proposal onto the ballot in threeparts.<BR><BR>SOE says their three amendments can stand or fall on their own. They donot need each other, they just help each other. </H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><BR><A NAME="anchor791792"></A><BR><BR><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR><A HREF="#anchor791792">Clintondoles out cleanup money</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><H3>KALAMAZOO, Mich.--(EnviroWorld)--President Clinton put the icing onthe cake of a pre-convention appearance on Wednesday by proposing a $1.9billion plan to help clean up polluted lands and waters, the Palm BeachPost reported.<BR><BR>Some of his proposals and their costs, announced during the stop in Kalamazoo,Mich. include the following: $196 million towards putting environmentalinformation on the internet, $76 million toward reducing toxins in the watersof the Great Lakes region, and $1.3 billion towards cleaning two-thirdsof all Superfund sites by the year 2000. </H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><BR><BR><A NAME="anchor792604"></A><BR><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR><A HREF="#anchor792604">Residentsconcerned about shoreline restoration project</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><H3>CLEARWATER--(EnviroWorld)--Homeowners raise concerns as the city considersgoing forward with a shoreline restoration project along Edgewater Drive,the St. Petersburg Times reported. <BR><BR>City commissioners are expected to decide this week whether to move aheadwith the $400,000 project. The plans call for a sill of limestone and sandto meander along a half-mile of shoreline and be filled with sea grassesand other plants to give it a natural look. <BR><BR>Homeowners in the area fear that work on the shoreline could block one ofClearwater's most scenic views. They also were concerned that traffic problemscould arise with more people enticed to visit the park stretching alongedgewater due to improvements.

Whether the outbreak can be linkedto use of agricultural pesticides in the region remains unclear, officialssaid.<BR><BR>The current die-off, according to David Klinger of the Fish and WildlifeService, has claimed 42 species, including brown pelicans. The brown pelicanis listed on the national endangered species list, with only about 5,000pairs thought to remain in the wild. <BR><BR>Scientists are toying with the idea that a recent storm could have churnedup botulism spores at the bottom of the shallow sea, and that high windsand the sea's high alkalinity could have made the spores deadly upon reachingthe surface. <BR><BR>A secondary theory is that fish that had died after eating the spores wereeaten by the birds that became infected. However, there is little evidenceto support the idea of birds catching botulism from fish, Klinger said.</H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><BR><BR><BR><A NAME="anchor795776"></A><BR><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR><A HREF="#anchor795776">Butterflieshead north due to global warming</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><H3>SANTA BARBARA, Calif.--(EnviroWorld)--According to a University of California-SantaBarbara researcher, rising temperatures are forcing a prized collector'sbutterfly north through California, the Palm Beach Post reported.<BR><BR>Edith's checkerspot butterfly is rarely noticed due to its small size, however,the orange and black winged butterfly is known by ecologists for its sensitivitytowards subtle changes in climate.

In Palm Beach County,3,135 nests have been found this year on one 3 mile stretch of beach southof the Martin County line. <BR><BR>The loggerhead population along the entire east coast of Florida is thesecond-largest in the world, accounting for 35 to 40 percent of all loggerheadnesting worldwide.<BR><BR>Despite encouraging nesting numbers, however, a comprehensive state studyreported that sea turtles are still adversely affected by the loss of habitat,marine pollution, entanglement in debris, incidental capture in commercialfishing gear and boating related accidents. </H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><BR><A NAME="anchor782786"></A><BR><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR><A HREF="#anchor782786">Evergladescleanup efforts appear to be working</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><H3>MIAMI--(EnviroWorld)--Farmers appear to have improved the quality ofwater running off their land and into the Everglades ecosystem, thus improvingthe overall water quality in the River of Grass, the Florida Times-Unionreported. Reports that the water is cleaner are the first good news thatmanagers monitoring the health of the Everglades have had to report in years.<BR><BR>A report by the South Florida Water Management District indicated that farmershave achieved a 68 percent reduction in the amount of phosphorous fertilizerdraining from their fields. Phosphorous, used as a fertilizer on sugar andvegetable farms, is a major threat to the Everglades because the chemicalupsets the delicate balance and encourages an invasion of exotic pests andplants, including the cattails responsible for choking thousands of acresof marshland. <BR><BR>Not only are the farms producing what appears to be cleaner water, but thefirst experimental filtering marsh is operating better than expected. <BR><BR>However, citing their 68 percent phosphorous reduction, sugar growers andtheir allies are launching another offensive against a proposed &quot;penny-a-pound&quot;tax on sugar grown in the Everglades Agricultural Area. The money, whichcould amount to $900 million over the next 25 years, would be used to purchaseland and construct filtering marshes.

Because of the new plan, thetown won't have to drill 3,000-foot-deep injection wells to dispose of thesaltwater discharge.

The process generates about a million gallons of saltwaterresidue daily, and this saltwater must be dumped.<BR><BR>Discharging the water at the C-18 Canal in the Loxahatchee river was approvedbecause water at the discharge site is closer to sea water than brackishwater and is about one-third as salty as seawater.

Broken homes and broken resolve litterthe streets of Dade County.<BR><BR>Four years later, only a few threads of hope are left dangling after ferociousbattles by Dade citizens to make government follow its own laws when re-developingHomestead AFB. The war is on to put some controls on explosive, unregulatedgrowth in the last development frontier of the sprawling, crowded county.<BR><BR>The citizens groups are losing. Their battle losses included failing to:--Halt the70 year lease offered by the county of nearly 2,000 acres of improvedpublic land at phased-out Homestead Air Force Base to a politically powerfulgroup of developers without a competitive bid process, request for proposalsfrom other parties, financial disclosures, performance bonds, public inputor information, aviation studies to justify the transfer or studies of environmentalimpacts. --Persuade federal agencies to delay the air base transfer andmandate studies on how development at the airport and surrounding areaswill affect the entire region, including Everglades and Biscayne nationalparks and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.<BR>--Persuade the county to change its recent designation as an urban expansionarea the 2,700 acres of farms and open space next to the airport. The landis needed as a buffer to protect surrounding waters from upland pollution.<BR><BR>Among the many questions still swirling is how the federal government canspend millions-and in the long run billions-to protect and restore the SouthFlorida ecosystem, while at the same time condone and even participate inactions that severely threaten the very same ecosystem. <BR><BR>The question was raised in Congress in June by Republican Senator John Chafeeof Rhode Island. At the urging of environmentalists, he wrote a letter tothe General Accounting Office asking for an investigation of the airportlease. This news was widely circulated, but after talking with Florida'stwo U.S. Senators, Chafee said, he decided not to mail it. <BR><BR>Assistant U.S. Interior Secretary George Frampton says his agency has beenconcerned for some time about the possible repercussions of developmentat the base that &quot;might run counter to the substantial Federal, Stateand local investment in restoration of the South Florida ecosystem.&quot;<BR><BR>But most public officials at all levels of government have failed to react.The mainstream press has kept the stories off the front page. The most comprehensivereports appeared in the Miami New Times, a widely circulated free weekly.There was plenty of activity at the grass roots level. In an angry froth,the people tried everything they had been taught in civics class about effectiveparticipation in the democratic process. Nothing worked.<BR><BR>The property leased to the developers includes the airfield, roads and utilities.The lessees, who have no experience in airport operation, plan to builda civilian airport with cargo and maintenance facilities, a commercial passengerterminal, an industrial office park and a hotel. Long term estimated valueof the project ranges from $500 to $700 million. <BR><BR>The lease holders will be able to shortcut the usual planning and zoningprocedures required of major developments. They will be required to placeonly $8.24 million in escrow and invest only $16 million over seven years.The taxpayers will have to spend about $10 million on improvements now andup to $165 million later. The Defense Department is completely refurbishingthe control tower and hangars at a cost of about $10 million. The countyhas not yet obtained title to the air base from the federal government.<BR><BR>&quot;Our elected officials are giving away the public trust,&quot; saidenvironmentalist Alan Farago, one of the leaders of the opposition. <BR><BR>When the Metro Commission met to vote on the lease, about 700 persons showedup. The meeting lasted 13 hours, almost to the break of dawn. In the endthe Commission voted nine to five in favor of the lease, changes in whichwere still being made at 5 a.m. A move by the county commission to takeback 200 acres of airport land for a public park still was being foughtby the lease holders at the time this story went to press. <BR><BR>Holder of the lease is Homestead Air Base Developers Inc. (HABDI), whoseleaders includes Carlos Herrera, president, and other members of the politicallypowerful Latin Builders Association. The association has made heavy contributionsto political campaigns of both parties, including $100,000 to the DemocraticNational Committee, according to the New Times. <BR><BR>Because of its concerns about the environment, the Everglades Coalitionhas asked the Defense Department to hold up the base transfer until a supplementalEnvironmental Impact Statement and other studies are made. The Coalition,working for Everglades restoration, includes national and local enviro organizations.<BR><BR>&quot;The base is immediately adjacent to Biscayne National Park and connectedby the Military Canal that has been and still may be the conduit for seriouspollution,&quot; said the Coalition.<BR><BR>Although the base is owned by the Defense Department, the transfer willbe handled through the Federal Aviation Agency. This makes the transferan &quot;aviation conveyance,&quot; and as such is exempt by state law fromthe requirement for competitive bidding and from the requirement that theplans be processed as a &quot;Development of Regional Impact&quot; (DRI).The DRI process is more thorough, takes longer, costs more and providesmore public scrutiny and participation than the planning process used byHABDI. Environmentalists urged unsuccessfully that the airport developmentplans be processed as a DRI despite the legal exemption. <BR><BR>HABDI's lawyer, Miguel De Grandy of the powerful Greenburg-Traurig firm,says the shortcut planning is best for the public. It will, he said, &quot;assistin expediting economic development in South Dade while saving the taxpayersof Dade County hundreds of thousands of dollars.&quot; <BR><BR>However, in April the county missed the deadline for approving the shortcutplan when the measure failed by one vote. HABDI went to the legislatureand got the necessary extension with the help of the Dade delegation. Thenext vote on the plan is scheduled for Sept. 10. It has been amended toprovide for the park and for certain environmental safeguards requestedby the South Florida Water Management District. <BR><BR>Saving the Everglades ecosystem has become a national political issue. Congresshas appropriated an extra $200 million for the task and President Clinton'sbudget contains other special Everglades funding. The task force of federaland state agencies working on Everglades restoration has asked that thefederal conveyance of the airbase contain conditions that will &quot;enhancethe protection of natural resources in Southern Dade County.&quot; <BR><BR>At the marathon meeting on the lease last January, one of the many pointsof conflict was HABDI's refusal to provide crucial financial records inadvance of the lease approval. Commission chairman Art Teale, who votedagainst the lease, warned: &quot;Every commissioner here is going to haveto face the public and explain how we could vote in favor of a $700 milliondeal without there being anybody from the county who had reviewed the financials.&quot;<BR><BR><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR></H3></BLOCKQUOTE></BODY></HTML>

Whether the plant could do that is a question thatrequires more data and technical expertise, the report stated. In comparison,however, two Brooksville cement plants were found to emit 38 percent oftheir maximum allowed pollution.<BR><BR>In concluding that there was insufficient data to answer key questions surroundingthe plant's emissions, the report also questioned whether Florida Rock Industrieswas required to release more data than it had.<BR><BR>The report will be provided to a hearing officer appointed by the commissionto review the plant's permit.<BR><BR>The plant is the target of intense public opposition and has become a keyissue among candidates for the three county commission seats up for grabsthis election season.Though the $80 million plant will create 80 jobs, thoseopposed to the plant say the fragile ecosystem on which it would be locatedand the potential human health effects from the plant's air pollution, arenot worth risking for the industrial growth.<BR><BR>The EPAC report was written by former air pollution research technicianDave Newport, who is now editor and publisher of &quot;Florida Environments,&quot;the parent of EnviroWorld. </H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><BR><BR><BR><BR><A NAME="anchor879100"></A><BR><BR><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR><A HREF="#anchor879100">Envirotechnology funding on the block in Senate EPA bill</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><H3>WASHINGTON D.C.--(EnviroWorld)--EPA's fiscal-year 1997 appropriationwas the subject of discussion in the Senate beginning September 3. <BR><BR>The bill would provide $6.6 billion to EPA for 1997, $70 million more thanEPA's 1996 funding level, but $444 million less than President Clinton requestedfor 1997.

The decision was made official by Dade  County Elections Supervisor David Leahy on Monday.</P>  <P></P>  <P>The petition was certified early in the day and set the stage for a  public vote on the question of whether the county should build a new arena  for the Miami Heat on waterfront land north of the Bayside Marketplace.</P>  <P></P>  <P>A telephone survey conducted last month by the Herald and NBC-6 suggested  that most voters opposed the project. Two other polls produced similar  results. However, the outcome is far from certain because fans of the arena  are expected to stage an expensive television campaign to raise support  for the project. </P>  <P></P>  <P>Voters may also be reluctant to vote against the arena because of the  potential impact on proposed expansion of the Port of Miami. The county  wants to build four cruise-ship terminals on the same waterfront land as  part of a bigger project called Maritime Park. The referendum, if approved  by voters, would prohibit the county from building any permanent structures  that would &quot;obstruct or impair&quot; the public's access to or view  of Biscayne Bay. </P>  <P></P>  <P>Arena fans say that the referendum would kill the port project, but  Paul disagrees. He said the project could go forward as long as the county  provides &quot;view corridors&quot; through the project to the water. Paul's  restriction would only block construction on the waterfront. The arena  backers could avert a showdown by shifting the proposed site to a new location,  perhaps west of Biscayne Boulevard. </P>  <P></P>  <P>The Metro Commission now has 30 days to either adopt the petition or  place the issue before voters. Leahy said the commission must act by next  week for the issue to appear on the Nov. 5 ballot.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><A NAME="anchor807429"></A></P><P><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR></P><H3><A HREF="#anchor807429">Debate over library site to decide park's fate</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>MIAMI--(EnviroWorld)--The Miami Beach City Commission is considering  a plan to relocate and expand the library that has marred the beauty of  Collins Park, the Miami Herald reported. </P>  <P></P>  <P>The park was a gift to the city from Miami Beach pioneer John Collins  and his family in 1928.

The only remaining  building on the land would be the Bass Museum, approved by the family in  1930 and designed by Collins' grandson, Russel T. Pancoast.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Although the city and county have already agreed to replace the library  with a $11.5 million regional library, the search for the site has divided  the community. While 11 potential sites were studied, the options have  come down to two: the existing site near South Beach, and another site  in North Beach.</P>  <P></P>  <P>&quot;The library has been there traditionally--and should stay there,&quot;  said Elaine Weisburd, president of the Middle Beach Community Association,  who is leading a petition to bring the issue before voters. She had collected  3,000 signatures to take to the commission yesterday, and was fairly confident  the commission would listen. &quot;This is a mandate from the people,&quot;  Weisburd said.</P>  <P></P>  <P>But according to Collins family members, the mandate of history calls  for the restoration of Collins Park. Grafton said that, repeatedly, changes  to the site have been approached with extreme shortsightedness. &quot;We're  just trying to remind people about the history,&quot; he said. </P>  <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><A NAME="anchor812660"></A></P><P><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR></P><H3><A HREF="#anchor812660">Growth across the state pushes wildlife to limit</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>SEBASTIAN--(EnviroWorld)--Problems of growth and development threatening  Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge are typical of those at 29 other  refuges around the state, Florida Today reported.</P>  <P></P>  <P>From the panhandle to Key West, more people are moving to Florida and  that means more boat ramps, homes, roads and parking lots neighboring refuges.  </P>  <P></P>  <P>&quot;We're loving our refuges to death,&quot; said Ron Hight, who oversees  three state refuges for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

Pheromones are naturally occurring compounds used by insects  to communicate and mate with one another. The compounds can control pests  by affecting normal insect behavior and preventing reproduction. Pheromones  pose fewer risks than traditional chemical pesticides. </P>  <P></P>  <P>EPA's measures have reduced both the time and cost of bringing new pheromone  pesticides to market.

To supporters of the  amendments, it is a victory for democracy; for opponents, it is environmentalism  run amuck.</P>  <P></P>  <P>The most controversial of the proposals is a one-cent per pound tax  on sugar processed from the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) in South  Florida. The tax would generate an estimated $30 million per year and would  be designated for restoration projects for the Everglades. That measure  is strongly opposed by the area's sugar industry, which is spending millions  in a public relations effort to sway voter opinion against the tax.</P>  <P></P>  <P>U.S. Sugar Corporation Vice President Robert H. Buker predicted the  South Florida sugar industry would &quot;strangle to death&quot; in 3 to  5 years if voters approve the tax. Recent polls indicate that voters are  favoring the tax.</P>  <P></P>  <P>The other two proposals would establish an Everglades trust fund and  make anyone causing pollution in the Everglades, or the EAA, liable for  cleanup costs. Each of the measures would become part of the state's constitution  if passed.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Since the group Save Our Everglades began collecting signatures to place  the proposals on the 1996 ballot, the sugar industry has tried a number  of unsuccessful legal maneuvers to block them. </P>  <P></P>  <P>The supreme court approval was the last major hurdle for the ballot  proposals, though opponents may file a motion for rehearing within 10 days  of the decision. However, because six justices voted for approval and none  voted against (one justice did not vote), a rehearing is unlikely to alter  the court's decision, and Buker said that as far as he knew, no one in  the industry planned to appeal.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Buker predicted that passage of the tax would actually hurt the Everglades,  and called the movement to tax sugar &quot;a real red flag&quot; to the  environmentalism movement.</P>  <P></P>  <P>&quot;Environmentalism has degraded to putting one group after another  out of business,&quot; he said. </P>  <P></P>  <P>But Big Sugar is not dead yet. The industry has already begun a multimillion  dollar public relations campaign to sway votes.

Now, most of the fish are gone and it is  unfit for swimming. Three drainage canals and hundreds of street drains  dump filthy water into the 20-mile stretch of the Intercoastal Waterway,  the Palm Beach Post reported.</P>  <P></P>  <P>County health officials discourage swimming because the water quality  is &quot;unpredictable.&quot; However, Lake Worth Mayor Rodney Romano gets  in the green water every year to publicize the pollution problem. Romano  wants Lake Worth Lagoon cleaned up so the city can benefit from the extra  tourist dollars.</P>  <P></P>  <P>&quot;You don't have to be a tree hugger or an environmentalist to understand  [cleaning up the lake] is the smart thing to do,&quot; Romano said.</P>  <P></P>  <P>County officials spend about $70,000 annually for restoration activities  in the lagoon. Palm Beach County's environmental director, Jim Barry, is  working with a group of county biologists to create a low-budget cleanup  plan, including planting mangroves and removing invasive plants. The project  is expected to total about $1.7 million. </P>  <P></P>  <P>The group has begun restoring wetlands on Munyon Island and already  the sea grass is back and young fish and crabs are thriving. By early 1997,  there will be a beach and a boardwalk with signs explaining the island's  history.</P>  <P></P>  <P>The major pollution problem is the 178 million pounds of soil and contaminants  that the West Palm Beach Canal dumps into the lagoon every year. The runoff  brings lead and arsenic into the water and the soil smothers the sea grasses.  The water from the canal is black, which blocks necessary sunlight from  reaching the sea grasses. The grasses die, wiping out the basis of the  food chain.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Water tests show that the lagoon contains levels of lead and arsenic  high enough to be harmful to sea life. The coliform bacteria count, which  indicates the presence of human waste, is 11 times the state's allowable  level for swimming.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Congress is expected to approve $135 million in federal funds to build  a marsh west of Wellington as part of the Everglades cleanup. This marsh  will cut the water that drains into the Lake Worth Lagoon by one-third--  89 million gallons. The marsh is scheduled to be completed by 2002. A federal  law is forcing cities that drain into Lake Worth Lagoon to monitor the  quality of their runoff and repair their storm drains by 2002.</P>  <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P></P><P><A NAME="anchor881225"></A></P><P><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR></P><H3><A HREF="#anchor881225">Final approval for SFWMD budget</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>--(EnviroWorld)-- The Governing Board of the South Florida Water Management  District gave final approval to the FY '97 budget and millage rates.

The expansion we are  considering would give the public the right to know not just which chemicals  come out of local industrial facilities, but which chemicals go into their  neighborhoods and how they are used.

Residents in the  307-home community began complaining earlier this year when construction  debris was discovered in a pit that formed in a common area of the development.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Assistant Attorney General Stephen A. LeClair said other Lennar developments  across the state may also be investigated. Lennar has built thousands of  homes in South Florida since the 1950's. </P>  <P></P>  <P>``It's hard for me to envision that a dump site of this magnitude would've  been the company's first endeavor into this sort of activity,'' LeClair  told the Herald, </P>  <P></P>  <P>Former Lennar employee Dow Wilkins said he saw countless trucks haul  debris into what is now the giant pit behind 20 homes at the development,  adding that it was a common practice among developers.</P>  <P></P>  <P>``It's cheaper than dirt,'' said Wilkins, who was project manager and  superintendent of Hampshire homes.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Though an initial Miramar police investigation in August concluded that  Lennar knew materials were trucked in during construction and buried in  the common area, no charges were filed because the statute of limitations  had expired.

That debris included an entire washing  machine, tires and rolls of carpeting. </P>  <P></P>  <P>In March, the Broward County Department of Natural Resource Protection  cited Lennar with a solid-waste violation for the dump in the common area.  More than 250 truckloads of debris were removed from the site.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P></P><P><A NAME="anchor367838"></A></P><P><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="100496.html">Return to today's headlines</A><HR></P><H3><A HREF="#anchor367838">EPA will move all 358 Mt. Dioxin families</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>PENSACOLA -- (EnviroWorld) -- Federal environmental officials Thursday  changed their minds and agreed to move all 358 families living around a  toxic waste site the residents have dubbed ``Mount Dioxin,'' The Associated  Press reported.</P>  <P></P>  <P>The decision came after five years of prodding by residents of the predominantly  black neighborhoods surrounding an abandoned wood-treating plant in the  heart of Pensacola. They had accused the agency of ``environmental racism,''  which officials denied.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Environmental Protection Agency staffers said it was coincidence that  the decision was announced two days after an advertisement in USA Today  appealed to President Clinton to order the relocation because ``neighborhood  children are sick and getting sicker.''</P>  <P></P>  <P>Regional EPA officials in Atlanta said the decision boiled down to a  matter of dollars and cents after city planners decided the area should  be redeveloped for light industrial use.</P>  <P></P>  <P>``It becomes cost efficient,'' Green said.</P>  <P></P>  <P>At a minimum of $18 million, permanent relocation and conversion to  light industrial will be cheaper than temporarily moving the families and  then cleaning the site to more stringent residential standards, said Richard  Green, acting waste-management director for EPA's Atlanta region.</P>  <P></P>  <P>The agency, however, has yet to decide what to do with a mound of contaminated  dirt that was dug up on the site of the Escambia wood-treating plant in  1993 to stop it from contaminating ground water. The soil remains piled  at the site, standing nearly 60 feet high and covered by gray plastic sheeting,  hence the Mount Dioxin nickname. Two intersecting mounds of soil, one about  1,000 feet long and the other about 300 feet, together cover roughly the  size of four football fields.</P>  <P></P>  <P>The mound and neighbors' yards are laced with dioxin, arsenic, PCBs,  lead and other poisons.</P>  <P>Citizens Against Toxic Exposure, a community group, contends the contamination  has caused cancer, skin rashes, respiratory problems and other illnesses  and even deaths, but government studies have failed to confirm the claims.</P>  <P></P>  <P>In May, the EPA proposed moving 66 households most directly impacted  by the site in the Rosewood Terrace subdivision and then added 35 more  homes in the Oak Park neighborhood to the plan in August.</P>  <P></P>  <P>But that still left out 257 households, including a large apartment  complex slightly farther from the site. The community group, supported  by U.S. Rep. Joe Scarborough, R-Pensacola, appealed to EPA to move everyone.</P>  <P></P>  <P>The ad in Florida editions of USA Today was signed by 101 groups and  10 individuals under the auspices of the community group and the Citizens  Clearinghouse for Hazardous Waste. The latter group was founded by Lois  Gibbs, who got her start as an activist pushing for relocation of her Love  Canal neighborhood.</P>  <P></P>  <P>It was headlined with a quote from Clinton's acceptance speech at the  Democratic National Convention: ``No child should ever have to live near  a hazardous waste site.''</P>  <P></P>  <P>It includes pictures of Clinton and three neighborhood children and  challenges the president ``to put the words of your acceptance speech into  action'' in Pensacola.</P>  <P></P>  <P>``It's a coincidence,'' said EPA project manager Kenneth Lucas. ``We  had no idea of when an ad was going to come out in USA Today.''</P>  <P></P>  <P>He said the revised relocation plan was in the works long before the  advertisement.</P>  <P></P>  <P>The relocation, which will be supervised by the Army Corps of Engineers,  is expected to take place in about a year, Green said. The Corps is expected  to complete an initial planning document in three weeks, he said. </P></BLOCKQUOTE><P></P><P><A NAME="anchor369337"></A></P><P></P><P><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="100496.html">Return to today's headlines</A><HR></P><H3><A HREF="#anchor369337">State Attorney General upholds Orimulsion decision</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>RUSKIN -- (EnviroWorld) -- An appeal by Florida Power and Light Co.  of the Governor and Cabinet's refusal to allow the company to burn a controversial  alternative fuel was turned down last week by the Attorney General's office,  the Tampa Tribune reported.</P>  <P></P>  <P>FP&amp;L has been seeking to burn Orimulsion -- a Venezuelan product  made of tarlike bitumen, water, and emulsifiers -- at the company's Parrish  plant in Manatee County.

The water district  had expected to get $47 million from the tolls. That estimate recently  was dropped to about $25 million.</P>  <P></P>  <P>&quot;This is very predictable,&quot; said Charles Lee of the Florida  Audubon Society. &quot;It's exceedingly rare that you have a public-works  project where the final cost is at or below the original estimate.&quot;</P>  <P></P>  <P>The state project, created by the 1994 Everglades Forever Act, is designed  to clean up pollution and restore the natural water flow in the ailing  River of Grass south of Lake Okeechobee.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Federal and state taxpayers are footing about two-thirds of the bill.  Sugar farmers in the Everglades Agricultural Area will pay the remaining  one-third, as much as $320 million.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Some environmentalists say farmers should pay more and are supporting  the penny-a-pound sugar tax on the Nov. 5 ballot that's supposed to raise  $875 million over the next 25 years and should cover any shortfall.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Meanwhile, the federal Water Resources Development Act, which Clinton  signed Saturday, expands on the state project by trying to restore the  natural water flow of the entire Everglades, from Orlando south to Key  West.

Though recycled materials  markets have a reputation for volatility, PET - polyethylene terephthalate  - has experienced such a nose dive that your plastic soda bottles may soon  be making a trip straight from the recycling bin to the landfill.</P>  <P></P>  <P>The latest reports indicate that Wellman, Inc. , the nation's largest  plastic reclaimer, was paying as little as one cent a pound for baled PET  scrap. Only a year ago the same material was fetching as much as 40 cents  per pound, and news reports were glowing over the future of recycled plastics.  </P>  <P>The Advance Disposal Fee may seem like a dim light in the corner to  cause national repercussions. And certainly a glut of cheap virgin resin  is a primary cause of recycled PET's price slide. But to recycling businesses  the market value isn't the problem, it's that the recycling infrastructure  may be crumbling along with it. And it's that infrastructure that the ADF,  which was a major player in a tiny league of states that passed similar  laws, helped to expand. </P>  <P></P>  <P>In it's September issue, Resource Recycling's Plastics Recycling Update  reported that the number of PET reclaimers - the middlemen who are key  to market stability - was rapidly dwindling. Last year, there were 24 reclaiming  companies. That number now stands at 12 and may soon drop to six, according  to Steve Apotheker, editor of the Portland, Ore. based Update. Apotheker  said that the loss of infrastructure could keep the recycled PET market  bottomed out for a long times.</P>  <P>Though representatives of the plastics industry downplay the role of  Florida's Advance Disposal Fee in this situation, trade journals and state  officials repeatedly point to the ADF's demise as a key factor. </P>  <P></P>  <P>&quot;When the Advance Disposal Fee was going into effect in 1993, one  of the things we heard from industry folks was that 'We're doing this anyway,'&quot;  said Ron Hendricks, administrator for the waste reduction section at the  Department of Environmental Protection. &quot;Then the ADF sunsets in '95  and the market goes to hell in a handbasket.&quot;</P>  <P></P>  <P>&quot;That's a little naive. ... Florida is such a niche market,&quot;  said Roger Bernstein, the Senior Director of Government Affairs for the  American Plastics Council. &quot;If you talk to economists, and we have,  they would say it's an incredible stretch.&quot;</P>  <P></P>  <P>That would seem to match conventional thinking, but market insiders  say Florida's ADF was much more than a law applying only to a niche market.  </P>  <P></P>  <P>&quot;Johnson Controls (a major national plastic product manufacturer)  told us they were on the fence - ADF gave them the extra incentive,&quot;  said Russ Martin, a DEP environmental manager in its waste reduction section.</P>  <P></P>  <P>The beauty of the ADF was that it truly worked as an incentive and was  not viewed as a punitive fee, said Martin, who was perhaps more closely  tied to the evolution and implementing of the ADF in the 90's than anyone.  Manufacturers could get exemptions from the fee in two ways: by incorporating  a certain level of recycled material into their packaging, or by adopting  &quot;takeback&quot; policies that found other homes for their used containers.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Martin said that a number of companies viewed an exemption as a competitive  advantage, so that the ADF became a decisive factor for them to plunge  into recycling.</P>  <P>More importantly Florida's law was considered a harbinger for other  states, an omen which some companies actively resisted.</P>  <P></P>  <P>&quot;There was a lot of pressure to kill the ADF in Florida to keep  it from spreading to other states,&quot; said Martin.</P>  <P></P>  <P>That pressure was strongest in the late 80's, when the ADF was getting  fine-tuned. Not surprisingly, many trade and manufacturing groups lobbied  against it, including representatives of the brand-name labels, supermarket  chains, glass packagers, and plastics manufacturers. But strong forces  existed on the other side of the fence. Solid waste issues, especially  dwindling landfill space were popular, and bottle-bill proponents, though  viewing the ADF as a compromise, supported the fee. </P>  <P></P>  <P>When the bill finally went into effect, in 1993, it had been so fine-tuned  as to almost guarantee success.</P>  <P></P>  <P>But for one flaw - the sunset provision.</P>  <P>Though required to have one, the date for sunsetting, when legislators  would review the bill, had not been updated from the original 1988 version.  When 1995 rolled around, and the sunset review came up, Martin and others  who had spent so much time on the bill uttered a collective, &quot;Duh.&quot;</P>  <P>Interestingly, by 1995 the ADF had won over many companies originally  aligned against the the fee.</P>  <P></P>  <P>&quot;There was a lot of quiet support,&quot; said Martin, adding that  the fee won over the National Association for Plastic Container Recovery,  which at least in principal opposes market regulation.</P>  <P>&quot;Especially toward the end, they were fighting to keep it,&quot;  said Martin.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Not all the opposition went away, however.</P>  <P></P>  <P>&quot;Yes. We were opposed to the ADF in Florida,&quot; said the American  Plastic Council's Bernstein. &quot;We support the concerns of plastics  industries that are telling us these kinds of legislation are hurting them.&quot;</P>  <P></P>  <P>In addition to that formidable lobby, in 1995 the ADF faced a fickle  legislature, too pleased that overall recycling goals were being met. And  while the ADF was a glittering success from a recycling viewpoint, legislators  gauged it by the revenue it produced. By that measure, the ADF was a dismal  failure. Because so many companies won exemptions based on recycling revenues  had dropped precipitously.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Some of the results of the ADF's demise were quick. A Florida Pepsi  bottling cooperative immediately stopped buying a patented post-consumer  PET resin from a Shell Oil Co. plant. The bottler was a major buyer, and  the Shell plant shut down. But a Washington bottler had also been buying  the resin, so the sunsetted ADF effectively took recycled Pepsi bottles  off the shelf in another state. Likewise, the end of the ADF is credited  with spurring Johnson Controls, Inc. and Wellman to move their production  of two recycled PET plastics from the U.S. to Europe.</P>  <P>According to a report in the June 1996 issue of Bottlemaking Technology  and Market News, &quot;On the day that Florida's ADF was dropped, demand  for food-contact recycled content vanished overnight.&quot;</P>  <P></P>  <P>Marilyn Bakker, editor of that newsletter, argues that government regulation  is critical to &quot;leveling the playing field&quot; in the plastic bottle  business.</P>  <P></P>  <P>&quot;If there are laws, people have to use it, even without the economic  incentive,&quot; said Bakker. &quot;The sunset of the ADF was a major blow  to the recycled PET industry...As long as there was legislation, then everybody  had to work in that direction...As soon as Florida went away, that was  the first big blow.&quot;</P>  <P></P>  <P>Since then, the remaining players, California and Oregon, have seen  their laws thwarted. A dismayed Bakker said that &quot;most of my subscribers  are tickled that all of the legislation is gone.&quot; </P>  <P>But while Bakker says the list of lobbyists opposing such legislation  is long, one name stands out - the American Plastics Council. In the May  issue of her newsletter, the plastics industry is given credit for defeating  &quot;the passage of more than 165 bill proposed in 33 states to ban or  tax plastic products.&quot; As part of that lobbying effort, the council  adopted its own goal of achieving a 25 percent recycling rate across the  board in the plastics industry, a goal it now says is not possible with  today's technology.</P>  <P></P>  <P>&quot;If anyone thinks it's easy for food and beverage container makers  to incorporate recycled PET, it's not,&quot; said Bernstein. &quot;It has  the greatest technical hurdles, the greatest safety hurdles.&quot;</P>  <P>Susan Kissler, the American Plastic Council's media relations director  said the PET downturn was nothing unusual. &quot;It's a commodity like  anything else. It's just a market.&quot;</P>  <P></P>  <P>That isn't exactly true because it is impossible to rid the market of  government influence at the critical level of waste production. And that  may send some soda bottles to the landfill because many local governments,  wooed by predictions of a rosy market, demanded that PET be included in  long-term waste recycling contacts. So while PET collection continues to  increase, places to put it are getting scarce. </P>  <P></P>  <P>The outlook for PET isn't totally dark. The material has become widely  used in a number of products, and an up cycle is bound to come again. The  real issue is that getting recycled PET into food and beverage containers,  by far the largest use of the plastic, would generate exponential market  growth. For ambitious companies that anticipated that growth, Florida's  ATF was a big tease, with a giant disappointment.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P></P><P></P><P></P><P><A NAME="anchor22548"></A></P><P><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR></P><H3><A HREF="#anchor22548">Courts to decide on coastal drilling</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)-- After years of litigation, a court will  decide if Coastal Petroleum, a company without a boat or drill, can explore  for oil off St. George Island, The Associated Press reported.</P>  <P></P>  <P>If Coastal loses, it probably will continue litigation for years over  its permit. If the state loses, it could face a decision on whether to  give Coastal a permit and, in effect, dare the company to drill.</P>  <P></P>  <P>The alternative would be to acknowledge the environmental dangers and  offer to buy out Coastal's offshore drilling leases, which critics say  has been Coastal's goal all along. Coastal president Phil Ware insists  there is oil in the area for which it holds leases.</P>  <P></P>  <P>&quot;The potential is enormous,&quot; Ware said.</P>  <P></P>  <P>But Denis Dean, an attorney for the state, said aside from its maps  and a small office in Apalachicola, Coastal isn't in the oil exploration  business.</P>  <P></P>  <P>&quot;They are waiting for a big bundle of money to drop,&quot; Dean  said.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Coastal has remained in business since 1953 without making a profit.  In fact, during that time, the company has lost $22.8 million. But based  on leases that give it the right to drill for oil off Florida's coast,  the company sells stock to the public each year that keeps some money flowing  in.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Coastal's last drilling, a dry hole off Apalachicola, was 28 years ago.  Now a series of court rulings has left the state Department of Environmental  Protection saying it must issue Coastal a permit to drill of St. George  Island, known for its beach front homes and state park.</P>  <P></P>  <P>The state fought issuing the permit, even asking Coastal to post a $1.9  billion bond to pay for possible oil spills. But courts struck down that  requirement, saying the state went beyond its authority. The Department  of Environmental Protection said before it issues Coastal a permit, the  company must publish a notice so the public and environmental groups can  file challenges.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Coastal denies it is required to notify the public, and has asked the  1st District Court of Appeal to order the DEP to issue the permit.</P>  <P></P>  <P>That case is pending, and Dean said state officials hope for a ruling  that will let environmental groups successfully challenge the Coastal permit.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Ware maintained that if a permit was issued, Coastal could raise the  $10 to $15 million needed to drill a well. Coastal would then subcontract  with a company like Mobil or Chevron to bring oil rigs, equipment and crews  to do the drilling, he said.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P></P><P><A NAME="anchor23506"></A></P><P><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR></P><H3><A HREF="#anchor23506">Deformed frogs appearing across the U.S.</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>HENDERSON, Minn.--(EnviroWorld)-- Across Minnesota and into neighboring  Wisconsin, South Dakota and Quebec, scientists and locals are seeing frogs  with stumps for limbs, with as many as four hind limbs, tails, missing  or shrunken eyes and smaller sex organs, The Associated Press reported.  </P>  <P></P>  <P>Scientists have had a hard time finding wetlands in Minnesota with no  deformed frogs.

Lauderdale.</P>  <P></P>  <P>`There are probably seven times more boats in the city than what you  have on the isles,'' Cal Landau, a Hendricks Isle resident, told commissioners.  ``This is a bigger problem than what we have down there.'' </P>  <P></P>  <P>Sonny Irons, a member of several advisory boards, said, ``I think it  would be a mistake to exempt all existing marinas. If we're looking for  clean water, we ought to go after everything.''</P>  <P></P>  <P>City Manager George Hanbury said requiring the pumping stations is the  first step of several that would be necessary to alleviate the pollution.  </P>  <P></P>  <P>Hanbury plans to return to commissioners next month with an outline  of how the city will deal with density and zoning issues and financing  of the pumping facilities. A seven-member advisory committee appointed  in July recommended the pumping station to handle wastes from more than  500 boats on the two narrow isles, at a cost of $1,450 per slip. Officials  are proposing to split the cost in half between government and residents.</P>  <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P></P><P></P><P><A NAME="anchor702160"></A></P><P></P><P><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="101696.html">Return to today's headlines</A><HR></P><H3><A HREF="#anchor702160">Group continues get funds to fight non-existentpipeline plans</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>(EnviroWorld) -- Broward County commissioners decided in a 5-1 vote  Monday to continue funding lobbying efforts to oppose petroleum pipelines  in the county.

Timothy Lenz, a political science professor at Florida  Atlantic University, says that the confusion generated by the warfare could  play to the advantage of the sugar industry.</P>  <P></P>  <P>&quot;Uncertainty generally causes people to trip the 'no' trigger&quot;  in voting booths, Lenz said. &quot;As a rule, that is what happens.&quot;</P>  <P></P>  <P>&quot;Symbolism, manipulation of facts, name-calling and visual imagery  -- clean Everglades; jobs, no jobs&quot; are being used to sway public  opinion on complicated issues, he said.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Jim Kane, editor of the Davie publication Florida Voter, said that studies  show that negative campaigning can cause people to not vote at all.

LUCIE COUNTY--(EnviroWorld)-- Black, sticky muck east of the Fort  Pierce Inlet is harming the commercial and recreational fishing in the  area, covering the offshore reefs and eliminating the view for divers,  the Fort Pierce Tribune reported. No one questions that there is a problem,  but no one is sure who is the culprit.</P>  <P></P>  <P>The main suspect is the Army Corps of Engineers who did the dredging  that created the the inlet.

They have organized a team to study the area and hopefully  determine the source of the muck. </P>  <P></P>  <P>The regional administrator of the National Marine Fisheries Services  in St. Petersburg, Andrew Kemmerer, has asked the Army Corps of Engineers  to speed up their study in response to findings of divers in the area.  </P>  <P></P>  <P>Kemmerer also reminded the corps that his agency and the Environmental  Protection Agency had reservations about the dredging to begin with.</P>  <P></P>  <P>&quot;None of the resource agencies, including the National Marine Fisheries  Service, anticipated such dramatic impacts to fishery resources,&quot;  he wrote. &quot;However it appears that fishery habitat and Fort Pierce  commercial and recreational fishermen and divers have been harmed by activities  associated with the (dredging) project.&quot;</P>  <P></P>  <P>The corps argues that last year's extreme weather and runoff from water  management agencies caused the muck to form in the area, not the dredging.  </P>  <P></P>  <P>&quot;It's very apparent it's all up and down the coast.

But while the state Department of Environmental Protection  gave its approval, Governor Chiles and the state Cabinet voted no last  April.

Cost: $20,000 per seminar. </P>  <P></P>  <P>A $7,000, one-day session at a beach hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico,  to train EPA lawyers on preparing for administrative hearings. </P>  <P></P>  <P>A two-day auditors' conference at a Breckenridge, Colo., lodge costing  $4,400. </P>  <P></P>  <P>The committee said it identified $1.4-million in questionable EPA training  expenses between 1993 and 1995. The agency was among the worst offenders  in the committee's investigation of inappropriate spending on federal employee  training programs, said committee chairman William Clinger, R-Pa. </P>  <P></P>  <P>&quot;What is especially offensive about EPA's action is that the Clinton  administration has repeatedly requested increases in EPA's budget while  doing nothing to curb this wasteful spending,&quot; Clinger said. </P>  <P></P>  <P>All the training was for employees who earned more than $50,000 a year,  a committee aide said. </P>  <P></P>  <P>The EPA defended the seminars as training sessions necessary to enhance  worker performances, like those any company or agency sponsors. </P>  <P></P>  <P>Some classes must be held outside EPA offices to accommodate large groups,  spokesman David Cohen said, but the agency keeps costs down by choosing  hotels near employees' offices and paying less than private firms for outside  trainers. </P>  <P></P>  <P>&quot;The EPA takes a very conservative tack when it comes to training,&quot;  Cohen said. &quot;It doesn't cost a lot to reserve a room or stay somewhere  close by.&quot; </P>  <P></P>  <P>The EPA spent $10.8-million on training for its 17,200 employees, about  1 percent of its overall budget. Private companies typically spend 3 percent  to 5 percent of staff costs on training. </P>  <P></P>  <P>Some seminars had nothing to do with environmental issues. The agency's  office of solid waste and emergency response spent tens of thousands of  dollars on Evelyn Wood speed-reading courses, business writing classes,  driving courses and seminars on resolving conflicts among employees. </P>  <P></P>  <P>Cohen said some EPA employees must read through voluminous files. Improving  their reading speed increases productivity, he said. </P>  <P></P>  <P>The $20,000 seminars on productivity were to teach required management  skills to staffers up for promotion to senior jobs, Cohen said. </P>  <P></P>  <P>Run by an outside firm, the seminars imitate actual executive settings  and have &quot;specific logistical requirements,&quot; an EPA training  official said. The West Virginia resort was chosen because it's close to  the agency's Washington headquarters. &quot;These are the kind of things  that can't be put on in a government conference room. There's not enough  room,&quot; Cohen said. </P>  <P></P>  <P>Seventeen employees attended each session, according to the committee's  information. </P>  <P></P>  <P>The meeting in Puerto Rico was to fulfill the EPA's statutory obligation  to train staff and local officials involved in pollution cases. Many EPA  staffers at the meeting were based in Puerto Rico, Cohen said. </P>  <P></P>  <P>&quot;It's not extravagant spending,&quot; he said. &quot;We try to  keep the training localized so that people can drive.&quot; </P></BLOCKQUOTE><P></P><P></P><P></P><P><A NAME="anchor944670"></A></P><P><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR></P><H3><A HREF="#anchor944670">Environment is not top issue for voters</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)-- While the environment is high on voters'  priority list, it is not the issue that they focus on when they are in  the ballot box, the Gainesville Sun reported.

Assistant State Attorney General  Denis Dean said, &quot;They are holding a lottery ticket out to their shareholders.  If their play works, they will have won the lottery.&quot;</P>  <P></P>  <P>Coastal owns leases to 800,000 acres of submerged land along the Gulf  of Mexico from Apalachicola to south of Naples. The lease give the company  the right to explore and drill for oil.</P>  <P></P>  <P>However, the company's last drilling, which was a dry hole, was 28 years  ago. In fact, from 1976 to 1990, the company was dormant except for lawsuits,  until 1990 when the state moved to ban offshore oil drilling. The company  has lost $22.8 million since 1953, according to SEC reports, and has depended  on the selling of stock to survive. In addition, no oil has ever been found  in the Gulf water off Florida.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Yet Phil Ware, Coastal's president, says there is oil in the Gulf and  there's also big money for the company that finds it. He insists that company  will be Coastal.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Coastal Petroleum got its drilling leases after 1941 when lawmakers  passed the Florida Oil Discovery Award bill, which guaranteed $50,000 to  the first company to strike oil. Coastal bought out a company which held  the largest number of drilling leases. For 25 years, Coastal prospected  for oil off Pensacola. A total of 22 wells were drilled.</P>  <P></P>  <P>In 1976, Coastal sued the state and then the federal government over  its right to mine minerals from the bottom of Lake Okeechobee. The company  settled the lawsuit and as part of the settlement gave up its right to  drill within four miles of the coastline (but retained its rights to royalties  if anyone found oil), surrendered all rights to land between four and seven  miles offshore and retained all rights to explore an area beginning seven  miles off the coast out to the 10-mile federal limit.</P>  <P></P>  <P>For the next 14 years neither Coastal nor any other company drilled  in the waters. Then in 1990 after the ban on offshore oil-drilling, the  company sued the state saying the state had reneged on its 53-year-old  lease. The company lost the lawsuit in August but is now appealing the  decision.</P>  <P></P>  <P>In 1995, the company applied for a permit to drill for oil in the seven-mile  zone exempt from the state ban. The state fought the ban but by late summer  the Department of Environmental Protection said it had its hands tied and  says it is ready to issue a permit.</P>  <P></P>  <P>But even if the company got the permit, it doesn't have the money to  drill. The company has about $6 million in cash from the sale of stocks  but needs about $10 to $15 million to drill a well.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Ware said he is not worried about the money because Coastal would subcontract  with another company, such as Mobil or Chevron, to bring their oil rigs,  equipment and people to do the drilling.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Ware dismisses the state's allegations that Coastal is drilling for  dollars saying that the company is ready to explore and to become oil producers.  However, he said the company would take the money from the state but really  wants to drill.</P>  <P></P>  <P>The state doesn't want to take the chance of Coastal drilling offshore,  but says the DEP has nowhere else to go, unless environmental groups can  successfully sue to prevent issuance of the permit. Unless a third party  intervenes, the state will have to decide whether to buy back the leases  or to issue a drilling permit and see what happens. Either way, the drilling  dispute will come to an end by 2016, which is when Coastal's leases run  out.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P></P><P></P><P></P><P></P><P><A NAME="anchor371509"></A></P><P><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR></P><H3><A HREF="#anchor371509">Wetlands site is newest classroom</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>DURANT--(EnviroWorld)--A 2-acre site on the northeast corner of Durant  High School's campus has been the school's focus this year for a environmental  effort to turn the wetland site into a classroom, the Tampa Tribune reported.  </P>  <P></P>  <P>Already more than 1,000 hours have been spent clearing the land for  &quot;Cougar Path,&quot; to make room for native vegetation, said Richard  Albertson, an agriculture-technology teacher at Durant. </P>  <P></P>  <P>&quot;The principal [Ron Frost] took a lot of heat over this.

In other words, thirty-five  percent of the voters could block a tax supported by sixty-five percent.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Most taxes are in laws rather than the constitution, but this year there  is an amendment to put a penny-per-pound tax on sugar grown south of lake  Okeechobee to raise an estimated $900 million over 25 years for Everglades  cleanup.</P>  <P></P>  <P>It is no coincidence that voters are faced with both proposals at the  same time. </P>  <P></P>  <P>The super-majority rule will be put into the constitution if it is supported  by a simple majority of 50 percent plus one. </P>  <P></P>  <P>There is a debate on how many votes the Everglades sugar tax--Amendment  Four--will need to get into the constitution.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Leaders of Save Our Everglades, the group that put the sugar tax proposal  on the ballot, argue that their measure is worded in such a way that it  isn't covered by Amendment One.

They maintain that if Amendment  One wins by a simple majority, Amendment Four can only win by a super-majority.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Citizens are concerned with the decision at hand. David Biddulph of  New Smyrna Beach said that Amendment One would make it harder to impose  a personal income tax in Florida.

Bradshaw  objects to an engineering firm's proposal of a berm as a way to redirect  water flow around the lake east of Brooksville. He said the berm is the  wrong approach because it doesn't address water flow or habitat improvement.  </P>  <P></P>  <P>Bradshaw said that a sluiceway, which was dug in the early 1950's between  the lake and Griffin Prairie, should be closed off. This would keep the  water, which currently drains into Bystre Lake, in Griffin Prairie. Not  only would this reduce flooding, but a traditional wetland would be restored,  he said.</P>  <P></P>  <P>Huntington, who directs the DEP's relatively new Withlacoochee Rib\ver  ecosystem management area, said that although he doesn't know whether Bradshaw's  plan would control flooding effectively, he wants to explore the proposal  at the meeting of the area's management committee in November. He said  that &quot;as a biologist, it's easy to see the potential habitat benefits&quot;  in Bradshaw's plan. </P>  <P></P>  <P>Huntington added that it would be a while before the plan could be implemented.  &quot;We're at the twinkle in the eye stage,&quot; he said. </P></BLOCKQUOTE><P></P><P></P><P></P><P><A NAME="anchor375671"></A></P><P><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR></P><H3><A HREF="#anchor375671">Activists link drainage, river cleanup</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>JACKSONVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--Before the city pumps millions into solving  Jacksonville's notorious drainage problems, some activists want it to pump  a few hundred thousand dollars into selling the solution, the Florida Times-Union  reported. </P>  <P></P>  <P>In the words of one member of the city's Environmental Protection Board,  however, the $300,000 education and awareness project being pitched by  the Stewards of the St. Johns needs &quot;more flesh on its bones&quot;  before the board will free up the money. </P>  <P></P>  <P>The Stewards introduced the campaign yesterday at the meeting of the  board's Water Quality Committee.

The new fuel could increase that number  by 19,000 tons a year, pushing emissions to the limit. </P>  <P></P>  <P>While they would still be under the allowable limit for emissions, Linero  said that the increase would eliminate the &quot;margin of safety.&quot;</P>  <P></P>  <P>Florida Power would buy the oil refining byproduct from refineries,  saving about $1.2 million a year in fuel costs. </P>  <P></P>  <P>The fuel is presently used in plants in Tampa, Jacksonville and Lakeland.  Those plants, however, have scrubbers in place between the boilers and  smokestacks to reduce the emissions emitted.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P></P><P></P><P></P><P><A NAME="anchor25353"></A></P><P><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="../September96/102396.html#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR></P><H3><A HREF="../September96/102396.html#anchor25353">PETA dupes &quot;NewYorker&quot;</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>NEW YORK--(EnviroWorld)-- The Oct. 14 issue of The New Yorker contained  an advertisement for &quot;Paul's Furs&quot; with an offer for a free video  that could save you thousands, the New York Times reported.

Reed  called Boyd &quot;the leading proponent&quot; of a state Everglades restoration  plan &quot;which is flawed in favor of the agricultural interests&quot;  and inadequately funded. </P>  <P></P>  <P>The sugar campaign, meanwhile, is not planning to take the governor's  advice. John Sowinski, the campaign manager, said that the water district  has earned a reputation for wasting money. &quot;The ad is relevant,&quot;  he said. &quot;The ad is true.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P></P><P><A NAME="anchor74346"></A></P><P><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR></P><H3><A HREF="#anchor74346">Fertilizer giant fined $45,000 for air qualityviolations</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>PLANT CITY--(EnviroWorld)--Phosphate fertilizer giant CF Industries  Inc. has agreed to pay $45,000 in penalties to the U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency for violating clean air permits at its facility near the Pasco County  Line, the Tampa Tribune reported.</P>  <P></P>  <P>The violations involved producing more sulfuric acid that the 1,050  tons allowed by a 1993 permit at two production plants, said CF and Hillsborough  County officials. </P>  <P></P>  <P>CF Industries acknowledges the plants produced too much sulfuric acid  but maintains that no environmental damage was done, said Tom Edwards,  the company's superintendent for environmental affairs. </P>  <P></P>  <P>CF has generally had a good record of compliance with air quality regulations,  said Jerry Campbell, assistant air division director at the Hillsborough  County Environmental Protection Commission. &quot;It's a fairly large,  complex operation,&quot; Campbell said. &quot;Considering all that, they  run a pretty tight ship.&quot; </P>  <P></P>  <P>EPC's biggest concern about the sulfuric acid production is the byproduct  sulfur dioxide, Campbell said.

Since the last progressreport, health effects studies indicate that acidic aerosols and other typesof particulate matter have adverse health effects in both countries. Bothgovernments also report substantial progress in reducing emissions and effectsof acid rain. <BR><BR>The 110 biggest sulfur dioxide (SO2)-emitting power plants and other utilitiesin the United States were in compliance with the acid rain reduction requirementsof the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments in 1995, the first year of the program(SO2 is one of the prime ingredients in the formation of acid rain). SO2emissions in this country also declined sharply in 1995, decreasing to 5.3millions tons annually from 1980 levels of 10.9 million tons(a 51 percentdecline). <BR><BR>The 1995 SO2 levels were 3.4 million tons better than required under theClean Air Act. The report cites studies showing reduction in surface watersulfates, leading to water quality improvement in the northeastern UnitedStates and Canada, as well as a decrease in lake nitrate concentrationsin the Adirondacks; however, the report cites other studies indicating thatnitrogen deposition at current levels could reduce the benefits of acidrain reduction in the long term. In addition, the study finds no evidenceof widespread forest decline from acid deposition, with some exceptionsin some especially sensitive regions. <BR><BR>The five-year review of the Air Quality Agreement in the report concludesthat, overall, both governments have been successful in fulfilling theirobligations under the pact, particularly regarding acid rain control. TheAir Quality Agreement, signed by the United States and Canada in March 1991,was established to address transboundary air pollution issues between thetwo countries.<BR><BR>For further technical information, contact Rosemary Wolfe of EPA's AcidRain Division at 202-233-9176.

Bob Owens, an agency environmental  scientist, was called to the site Oct. 18 by neighbors. When Owens saw  that a tree trimmer had violated a county code by cutting about 5 feet  into the mangrove fringe on the port authority property, he immediately  issued a &quot;cease and desist&quot; order. A port authority notice that  all work on the site must stop has been posted at the mangroves since Oct.  23.<BR>  <BR>  Fernandez, an investment manager who has been on the council since 1991,  said he thought it was safe to ask his landscapers to cut the mangroves  down to 7 feet. &quot;I was really just trying to make the neighborhood  look better,&quot; Fernandez said Wednesday. <BR>  <BR>  Some of Fernandez's new neighbors aren't happy. &quot; I don't want to  bad mouth him or anything, but it seems to me he should be setting an example,&quot;  said Frank Ferlita. Ferlita said there have been problems with people cutting  down parts of the mangroves, which are on Old Tampa Bay, despite a sign  marking it as a sanctuary.<BR>  <BR>  Fernandez said he never saw the sign and hopes there are not &quot;ruffled  feathers.&quot; He has asked the port authority for permission to clean  out debris in the mangroves, including glass bottles and cans.<BR>  <BR>  To ensure Fernandez is adhering to the &quot;cease and desist&quot; order,  Owens will inspect the property twice within the next 60 days. The commission  does not plan to levy a fine at this point, because it is a first offense  and the action was stopped, Owens said.</H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><BR><BR><BR><A NAME="anchor4108696"></A><BR><BR><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News CoverPage</A> | <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR><A HREF="#anchor4108696">City tree code seeks to plant building seed</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <H3>TAMPA--(EnviroWorld)--A prolonged debate as Tampa officials try to  tune the city's Tree and Landscape Code to encourage development in poor  areas has centered around the trees themselves, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>  <BR>  Some residents like Jean Villareal, who serves on the board of Tampa Federation  of Garden Clubs, are asking whether Mayor Dick Greco's administration is  digging too close to the root of the ordinance established to protect trees  and encourage landscaping on commercial development. <BR>  <BR>  City officials don't want to build a continuous concrete slab. The revisions  are aimed at protecting large trees and cutting a little slack to landowners  who might be digging deep to renovate property.<BR>  <BR>  &quot;Although the city has said it wants to promote infill development,  it has land development regulations that make it impossible,&quot; said  Ron Rotella, special consultant to Mayor Dick Greco. Such infill development  might occur on Florida Avenue in vacant lots sandwiched between car lots  and storefronts.<BR>  <BR>  Both sides were presented during a recent meeting of Hillsborough's City-Council  Planning Commission. <BR>  <BR>  The city's proposed revisions include exempting developers from meeting  the code if they are merely renovating an existing building and not changing  a parking lot. Under the city proposal, developers would gain more flexibility  when landscaping parking lots. Instead of requiring one island for every  ten spaces, the code would allow them to consolidate islands, said Tom  Johnston, a city planner.<BR>  <BR>  Landscaped parking lots are an asset, Commissioner Laura Swain said. &quot;In  an urban development where you have commercial development right next to  residential, I think it's a shame to think about not having trees in parking  lots.&quot;<BR>  <BR>  The tree debate will likely reach the Tampa City Council next month.</H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><BR><BR><BR><A NAME="anchor4110482"></A><BR><BR><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News CoverPage</A> | <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR><A HREF="#anchor4110482">Sugar tax supporter targeted by critics</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <H3>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)--A New York commodity trader who handed out  nearly $9 million in political contributions this election, mostly in Florida,  is being targeted this week by both the political watchdog group Common  Cause and the Republican National Committee, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>  <BR>  Paul Tudor Jones II, who has bankrolled the campaign for a new state amendment  for a penny-a-pound tax on Everglades sugar, was not criticized for the  $8.6 million he contributed to the Save Our Everglades Committee, the group  campaigning in favor of the sugar tax. Jones was questioned instead for  the $100,000 he gave to the Democratic National Committee in July.<BR>  <BR>  <BR>  On Wednesday, Common Cause President Ann McBride released a list of the  biggest contributors to the Democratic and Republican parties, with Jones'  name near the top. The $200 million in total contributions given to parties  this election is &quot;engulfing our elections and corrupting our democratic  system,&quot; McBride said.<BR>  <BR>  In a press release Sunday, Republicans questioned whether Jones' contribution  could be as scandalous as the foreign-linked political donations to the  Democratic Party that have caused such an uproar this month.<BR>  <BR>  Reason for suspicion lies in the fact that, in federal campaign reports,  the address the Democrats listed for Jones and 26 other contributors happened  to be the exact same address as the Democratic National Committee. <BR>  <BR>  Republican National Chairman Haley Barbour questioned &quot;If these were  legitimate contributions, why didn't the DNC list the donor' real addresses?&quot;<BR>  <BR>  A spokeswoman for the Democratic party said it was a simple clerical error.<BR>  <BR>  Jones said Wednesday that he has never had any reason to hide his political  involvement and makes no apologies for it. He said that all of his political  contributions have been given with a single goal: to conserve the nation's  national parks and pristine wildlife areas.<BR>  <BR>  &quot;That's the only reason I gave to any member of any party,&quot; Jones  said. &quot;I have an environmental filter on the dollars I give, and it's  as simple as that.&quot;<BR>  <BR>  If Republican officials wanted to know Jones' address, all they had to  do was look in their own records.

In past years, conservation-minded consumers have managed to hold  water use to a daily average of about 215-million gallons.<BR>  <BR>  The problem is rooted in rainfall patterns. The winter months, normally  dry periods were wet. Then in late June when rains should have been picking  up to seasonal highs, they became spotty. Rainfall this year also fell  in mostly heavy downpours, so most of it ran off. <BR>  <BR>  &quot;(The situation is) not nearly as bad as it was three years ago,&quot;  said Kinsman. &quot;But it is a disappointing position to be in as we enter  another dry season.</H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><BR><BR><BR><BR><A NAME="anchor4113151"></A><BR><BR><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News CoverPage</A> | <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR><A HREF="#anchor4113151">Election bonus: money for Lake Apopka</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <H3>ORLANDO- (EnviroWorld)- One week before the elections, the Clinton  Administration doubled the amount of money available for a project to help  restore Lake Apopka , the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>  <BR>  The project aims to end the farm pollution ,which most experts blame for  killing the 31,000-acre lake, by buying lakeside farms.<BR>  <BR>  State Rep. Everett Kelly, D-Tavares, said he had known about the money  for a month or so but wasn't allowed to make it public. Some believe the  information was held in an attempt to gain electorial votes in Florida.  <BR>  <BR>  But most people don't care whether the money was given with a political  agenda. Rep. Bill Sublette, R-Orlando, said, &quot;If it takes an election  year to get the money, then God bless the election year. The important  thing is to clean up Lake Apopka.&quot;<BR>  <BR>  During the next two weeks, representatives from the St. Johns River Water  Management District will be making offers to farmers to purchase land that  was once lake bottom on the north shore of the lake .<BR>  <BR>  Farmers initially asked for $95 million for 14,000 acres, but Florida officials  believe the price will be substantially lower, somewhere between $60 million  and $70 million if land is bought on a farm-by-farm basis. With the federal  money, the total money available is $46 million, which means the fund will  probably be a little short.<BR>  <BR>  Water district officials say that stopping the farm pollution and allowing  the lake to reclaim the farmland would provide the quickest cleanup.<BR>  <BR>  The federal funds are coming from the Wetlands Reserve Program of the Department  of Agriculture and are technically not grants but a &quot;30-year easement&quot;  where the federal government buys the right to restore the land during  the next three decades.

Farchan researches and produces specialty chemicals for  agricultural and pharmaceutical use.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The EPA has been supervising cleanup and testing of the site and told  county environmental officials Thursday of the test findings and Superfund  designation. Alachua County has only one other Superfund site, the Koppers-Cabot  site on NW 39th Avenue.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Bird said that the latest EPA tests found chromium, cadmium and lead.  Cyanide, previously found in a wastewater barrel, was found in debris near  the barrel. The metals found were in fairly low amounts, according to Mike  Shuler. Shuler supervised the site for the county environmental department.  He said that test results due out today will give more details about levels  of contamination.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Because of the toxic metals and cyanide, the debris from the site, including  the concrete pad and metal siding, will have to be disposed of as hazardous  material, probably out of state, Bird said.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;The disposal costs go way up&quot; when hazardous material is  involved, Bird said.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Soil and groundwater tests will begin soon.

Poll results for Amendment  1 also show declining support. Support for that amendment is down to 51  percent, with 27 percent undecided.

The charges include several due process violations,  libel, injurious falsehood, invasion of privacy, restraint of trade, negligence,  and several other charges. She asks for over $18 million in punitive damages.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The suit, which DEP has moved to dismiss, stems from a series of hazardous  waste storage rule violation complaints against HWC dating back to 1987.  After protracted litigation, DEP in 1994 won a victory in Orange County  Court which fined HWC $500,000 and Ricketson $75,000.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Ricketson contends that she was &quot;the victim of negligent and abusive&quot;  behavior by DEP, was never convicted of any pollution-related counts although  she was branded a polluter in DEP press releases, was forced into bankruptcy  by DEP prosecutors, and has since been railroaded by the courts. Ricketson,  who now teaches a hazardous waste training seminars around the state, said  she's filing this suit to clear her name and to &quot;try and get DEP to  stop doing this to people.&quot;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>DEP attorney Steve Medina, know as a very aggressive enforcer, is the  particular subject of Ricketson's wrath. &quot;He made it a personal vendetta,&quot;  Ricketson told Florida Environments.

In particular, the impending decision  on PM has the regulated community biting its nails because a change could  demand billions of dollars in new pollution control costs.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>But regulators are nervous, too. While groups such as the American Lung  Association and the National Resources Defense Council are lobbying to  have fine particles-those less than 2.5 microns in diameter-placed in their  own regulatory class, EPA's lawsuit-inspired rush has generated criticism  that the scientific evidence for such recommendations is not complete.  The EPA prefers to have an airtight defense for its rules to ward off litigation,  and has already received extensions from the courts to allow the Clean  Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) more time to review staff recommendations.  Nevertheless, based on the results of recent large scale epidemiological  studies, the EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS)  has offered a range for a new &quot;PM2.5&quot; standard.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;There have been a number of studies (of fine particles) since  1987 ... that have seen an attendant increase in health effects,&quot;  said Dr. Jane Caldwell, a toxicologist with the OAQPS. &quot;Toxicologically,  they have more components that would cause problems. For example, pound  for pound, fine particles have a much larger surface area that toxic materials  could stick to and then be transported into the lungs.&quot;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The National Resource Defense Council's May 1996 report, &quot;Breathtaking,&quot;  extrapolated the results of several studies to estimate that particle pollution  sends 64,000 people to an early grave each year. That report, which examined  239 metropolitan areas, seemed to show that Florida's air was pretty safe.  Only Tampa/St. Pete (97th), and Jacksonville (82nd) cracked the top 100  for average annual mean concentrations of particulate matter less than  10 microns, out of 14 areas analyzed in the state.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>But when the NRDC calculated death rates resulting from particulate  pollution in each area, it factored in health risks based on demographics.  That turned some retirement hotspots into death traps: Tampa/St. Pete ranked  22, Sarasota ranked 18, and Miami ranked 21.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Thus, for Florida, the stakes could be particularly high. One-fourth  of the state will be more than 65 years old by 2025. Because that segment  of the population is most susceptible to air pollution related illnesses,  pollution rules which result in reduced health care costs seem prudent.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>But Caldwell acknowledges that scientists don't yet know exactly how,  or even which, fine particles cause those health effects.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;We're concerned with the proposed 2.5 standard ... because there  seems to be an absence of good scientific data,&quot; said Florida Petroleum  Council executive director Doug Shelby. &quot;What we're saying is we're  not opposing change, but do it on hard data.&quot;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The Council's November newsletter sounds less cooperative. An item titled  &quot;Changing Particulate Standards Could Damage the U.S. Economy,&quot;  warned that a fine particle standard could cost millions both to farmers  and builders for new dust control measures, and to electric utilities,  oil and natural gas producers and trucking companies for new exhaust and  emissions controls.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>On the national level, the Washington Post reported Nov.1 that the Air  Quality Standards Coalition, made up of 500 members of the National Association  of Manufacturers, is using local campaigns to warn the public that new  standards could put a number of areas in nonattainment status.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>But air pollution experts counter that cities would not have to worry  about nonattainment until the next century, and that the most immediate  need for an EPA PM2.5 standard would be to mandate a nationwide monitoring  network that could begin to accumulate some of the very data on fine particles  that is missing.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Dr. John Watson, a scientist at the Desert Research Institute in Reno,  NV, said that a PM2.5 standard could be a good thing for industry.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Watson, an authority on fine particle pollution, said the jumps made  in knowledge about air pollution would translate into more flexibility  and common sense in regulations. For one thing, he said PM2.5 monitoring  will be geared toward looking at air quality within communities, where  people are actually breathing air, and where correlations between monitoring  statistics and health problems are much stronger. Moreover there would  be an increase in sampling and a reliance on long-term averages of air  quality, decreasing the possibility that one-time measurements would throw  an area into non-attainment.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;In a way, it's a loosening of standards,&quot; said Watson.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Another benefit is that new sampling technology will allow chemical  analyses to determine what particles are contributing to an area's PM2.5  levels. That could be a major benefit to the Tampa/St. Petersburg area  and other coastal cities where ocean spray is suspected of contributing  to particulate levels.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;If you can analyze your (city's) sample and say, 'half of this  is sodium chloride, you can make a case for that (to regulators),&quot;  said Watson.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>But a sampling network for PM2.5 will be an expensive proposition (though  the tab will most likely be picked up by government, and not industry).  Fine particles behave much differently than the coarse particles that are  currently monitored under PM10 rules, instead sharing characteristics with  ozone and acid rain pollutants.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>In fact, most manmade fine particles in the eastern U.S. are not belched  directly into the air, but are formed in complex reactions from precursor  chemical pollutants and can travel hundreds of miles before reaching your  lungs. Some of those chemicals also cause acid rain and ozone (NOx and  SO2, for example). Indeed, officials believe current acid rain and ozone  standards are already making a dent in PM2.5 levels. But chemicals such  as ammonia and volatile organic carbon compounds are also important components  of fine particle pollution.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>An adequate assessment of fine particle pollution will require extensive  data on airflow patterns, as well as new technology for monitors to analyze  air constituents continuously. Some of that technology is still in development,  and the EPA must set specs before monitoring can begin. Even then, a lot  of gray territory will have to be crossed before cities will have to worry  about meeting a PM2.5.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>One problem is that data may show rural sources of fine particles are  contributing to high PM2.5 levels in urban areas. According to &quot;Breathtaking,&quot;  about 7.5 percent of fine particles are from prescribed burns and wildfires,  or feedlots and other agricultural practices.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Prescribed burning may be a particularly thorny issue in Florida. State  Fire Management Administrator Jim Brenner said that more than 2 million  acres are burned in Florida each year, and 75 percent of the emissions  from those burns are fine particles. But he said that existing emissions  rules in states such as California made officials reluctant to allow controlled  burns, only to result in wildfires that ultimately caused more harm.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>If wildfires are exempted from PM2.5 regulation, and prescribed burns  are not, the result, Brenner said, will be less efficient fires that ultimately  cause more pollution.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Not surprisingly, setting up a whole new category of air pollutant will  be challenging both for regulators and the regulated. Given the reservations  expressed by CASAC, the EPA may decide not to propose any changes, or else  set an annual ambient PM2.5 standard much higher than the NRDC recommendation  of 10 micrograms per cubic meter. While the NRDC states that a wimpy PM2.5  won't save many lives, that strategy may save the EPA from additional lawsuits.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><A NAME="anchor1024883"></A></P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A HREF="#anchor1024883">Manatee relaxes air pollution ordinance underFP&amp;L pressure</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>BRADENTON--(EnviroWorld)-- Manatee County commissioners unanimously  repealed a 2-week old ordinance that local environmentalists hoped would  help strengthen a ban on Orimulsion, the Tampa Tribune reported.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The ordinance limited industrial air emissions.

The circling turkey vultures may  be an ominous sign for those with business inside, but for many court employees  they are somewhat of a mascot.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;We call them retired judges,&quot; mediation clerk Tara Dummett  said with a wink. &quot;People on the 24th floor have stuffed buzzards  on their computers and desks.&quot;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The birds summer in Hinkley, Ohio, and start showing up here in late  October. They started roosting atop the tiered courthouse decades ago when  the building was the tallest in Florida and they could look out to Biscayne  Bay to the east and the Everglades to the west.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The bald, redheaded bird often can be seen devouring the flesh of the  dead -- usually small rodents or fish -- on the courthouse ledges. The  birds show up each morning to greet those summoned for jury duty.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;Vultures spend a lot of time gliding and soaring and they need  to reach thermals -- a corridor of warm air that is rising,&quot; said  Mark Kraus, conservation director for the National Audubon Society in Miami.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>They are not the only wild birds to adapt to city life. Peregrine falcons  can be found under bridges throughout the U.S., Kraus said.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;These birds come right to the city like it's a canyon,&quot; he  said. &quot;People do disturb wildlife but wildlife can habituate to humans.&quot;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The buzzards -- sometimes up to 200 -- dry their wings while they roost  on the ledges of the courthouse. Soon they are circling over downtown and  flying off to look for carrion. The birds roost on islands in Biscayne  Bay each night.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Every fall, feathers clog up drain pipes and a few vultures miscalculate  a landing and kill themselves against a plate glass window. Yet, every  fall they return.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;</P><P><A NAME="anchor1027291"></A></P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A HREF="#anchor1027291">Water quality worsened by polluted tributaries</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>JACKSONVILLE--(EnviroWorld)-- City officials dealing with the water  quality problems of the St. Johns River are looking at its tributaries  for answers, the Florida Times-Union reported.

The attorney general said  that it could, which, in the words of Florida Audubon society vice president  Charles Lee, &quot;clears the decks for citizen enforcement.&quot;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>But the Wall Street Journal reported that lawsuits resulting from the  amendment could damage the existing Everglades Forever Act, which requires  the sugar industry and other area farmers to pay about one-third of the  costs of a Phase I phosphorous reduction program, while other property  owners in South Florida pick up the rest of the $800 million tab. The article  warned that the sugar industry could use the amendment to sue urban contributors  to Everglades pollution.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;I don't know what to make of Amendment 5,&quot; Senate Natural  Resources Committee Chairman Rick Dantzler told the Journal. &quot;The  (Everglades Forever Act) could end up back in a ditch.&quot;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Softmud, for its part, is treading rough seas. The agency was hammered  in the anti-sugar tax ad campaign as being a corrupt bureaucracy. Those  ads were criticized for containing outright lies by Governor Chiles, who  took a neutral position on the tax itself. As governor, Chiles makes appointments  to the district's governing board, which now contains a mix of environmental,  development, and agricultural representatives.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Softmud general counsel Barbara Markham said the district did not believe  the amendment would require changes in property tax formulas, but would  result in the hiring of consultants to tease out the responsible parties  and their fair shares.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The governing board itself is silent. It had attempted to remain neutral  during the sugar-tax campaigning, but, according to a column in the Ft.  Myers News Press, board chairman Valerie Boyd, who is tied to agricultural  interests, first spoke out against the tax. That prompted tax-supporter  Nathaniel Reed to rebut, and other members of the board then quickly jumped  into the fray. With both Reed and Boyd's terms ending next year, there  will be heavy political pressure on Gov.

LUCIE COUNTY--(EnviroWorld)-- Mosquito impoundments in St. Lucie  County are being credited with providing much needed habitat for wading  birds, the Fort Pierce Tribune reported.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The first mosquito impoundment was built at Bear Point in 1936. Dikes  were built to control the flow of water. By the 1960s the gates were left  closed because the putrid water from the rarely opened impoundment was  harming fish in the Indian River Lagoon.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>In 1983, Jim David was hired by the St. Lucie County Mosquito Control  District. One of the first things he did was open all the impoundment gates  he could find to restore the flow of water and allow fish into the impoundments.  The lowered water level allowed vegetation to return to the mud flats.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>In July of 1988, David began experimenting with opening and closing  the impoundments periodically in hopes of helping the fish. The result  was hundreds of wading birds descended on Jack Island State Preserve to  feed on the concentrated masses of fish, shrimp, frogs, snakes and crabs.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The abundant food supply allows the birds to reproduce more successfully  because there is plenty of food for the young. Abundant food during early  development makes the young healthier and stronger, said David.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The artificial wetland now has over 6,000 birds, including woodstorks,  a federally and state protected bird. Two colonies of white ibis, roseate  spoonbills, egrets and herons have all found a home on Jack Island Preserve.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The St. Lucie County Mosquito Control District recently shared its knowledge  about mosquito control and bird habitat at a national mosquito control  conference.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;We haven't convinced everybody, yet, even though we've given them  data,&quot; David said.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><A NAME="anchor643815"></A></P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR><A HREF="../index.html">Return to today's headlines</A><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A HREF="#anchor643815">Hydro-Logic Associates makes promotions</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>CLEARWATER -- (EnviroWorld) -- Hydro-Logic Associates, Inc. a Clearwater-based  national environmental consulting firm, has promoted Mark Zayatz to mid-regional  vice president and shareholder in the company.

Instead the draft report proposes that the crude phosphorous  become part of the long-term cleanup of the 160-acre toxic waste site on  the Pinellas-Pasco line, the St. Petersburg Times reported.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>However, that decision is not final, according to Maxwell Kimpson, the  EPA's project manager for the site. He released a draft of the report to  a few residents in the area last week and is awaiting their comments before  making the report final.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>As proposed in the draft, Stauffer will not resume the excavation and  packaging of phosphorous that sparked fires and sent clouds of smoke wafting  from the site last month. Phosphorous ignites when exposed to warm air  and the EPA stopped the operation Oct.16 after a resident complained that  smoke from the plant was making her ill.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>What residents are likely to see next at the site is Stauffer cleaning  and taking away equipment that was used during the phosphorous removal.  Kimpson said the process will take about three weeks and may begin as soon  as Monday, but will more likely start after Thanksgiving.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>However, the bad news for residents is that the equipment cleanup may  cause more smoke. The Stauffer Management Co., which was formed to supervise  the site, warned of this effect in a report that is circulating in the  community along with the EPA draft.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Kimpson said he is looking forward to resolving the crude phosphorous  issue and completing the EPA's final cleanup plan, a document called the  Record of Decision that the community is anxiously awaiting.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><A NAME="anchor715127"></A></P><H3><HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR><A HREF="../index.html">Return to today's headlines</A><HR ALIGN=LEFT></H3><P>&nbsp;</P><H3><A HREF="#anchor715127">'Mount Dioxin' neighbors want to relocate</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>PENSACOLA--(EnviroWorld)--In 1993 the EPA excavated 250,000 cubic yards  of contaminated soil to prevent ground water contamination, forming a huge  pile of contaminated soil which covers an area the size of four football  fields.

The dead mangrove  area has now increased to about 50 acres. Scientists say that the heavy  rainfall of 1995 stressed the forest and contributed to the tree deaths.  Rain and runoff flooding the bay is causing the black mangrove trees to  drown. Black mangroves have a horizontal root system that must reach above  the soil to &quot;breathe.&quot; The lack of water flow is causing debris  to be improperly flushed, affecting other organisms in the area.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The Collier County Commission hired a consulting team to create a short-term  plan for saving the mangrove forest. They sent workers out with shovels  this summer to reopen the channels through the mangrove forest, allowing  proper water flow. The mangroves started to make a turn around.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The team made about half the flushing cuts permitted. However, T.R.  Brown Co., the consulting firm hired by the city commission, and Hilburn  Hillestad, the scientist working with the consulting company, have said  that some of the flushing cuts were made in the wrong place and could retard  long-term efforts to save the forest. They want to conduct a study to determine  the effects of further cuts.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Pelican Bay Services District Administrator Jim Ward said that changing  the location of the flushing cuts would require new permits. He suggests  waiting for the consultants to make a better determination of the effects  of the cuts.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>A report from Hillestad and Brown, dated Sept. 19, states that the best  way to restore the mangrove forest is to dredge Clam Pass and other channels  to aid interior water flow.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Environmentalist Fran Stallings of Save the Bays Association was stunned  by the report saying that it drew away from plans to reconnect the Clam  Bay system with Vanderbilt Lagoon to improve water flow through Venetian  Bay.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The report also suggests installing a &quot;flap&quot; system in the  Seagate culverts to allow water to flow only from Venetian Bay to Clam  Bay, causing the water to exit through Clam Pass. This would help keep  Clam Pass open. It also makes the suggestion that runoff from nearby golf  courses and lawns be monitored to reduce the water that Clam Bay receives.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><A NAME="anchor1023720"></A></P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR><A HREF="../index.html">Return to today's headlines</A><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A HREF="#anchor1023720">Benthologists gather in Palatka for annualmeeting</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>PALATKA -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Florida Association of Benthologists  will hold their annual meeting on Dec. 5-6 at the St. Johns River Water  Management District in Palatka.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>There will be presentations on lake, stream and estuarine benthology,  benthic community ecology, taxonomy and ecology of benthic taxa, bionmonitoring  and bioassessment, and information management databases.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>MIAMI--(EnviroWorld)--Despite voters' rejection of a proposal to tax
  sugar growers for Everglades cleanup, the nation's biggest environmental
  restoration project will not be slowed down, The Associated Press reported.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>The total cost of restoring the greater Everglades ecosystem could cost
  anywhere from $3 billion to $5 billion over the next few decades. The penny-a-pound
  tax would have filled a major gap in the funding equation.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>&quot;The price tag on it exceeds anything else in the history of our
  country, &quot; said Curt Kiser, a former state senator who worked on the
  1994 Everglades cleanup law. &quot;Who's going to pay for it?&quot;</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>A 1994 state law designed to clean up the heart of the Everglades is
  estimated to cost $1.5 billion over 20 years. But there is a formula for
  getting and spending just the first $800 million.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>The sugar industry, responsible for about half the phosphorous run-off
  that is disrupting the natural balance of the Everglades, will contribute
  about a third of the cost of the first phase of restoration.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Taxpayers will pick up the rest.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Regardless of this years political fight, or the ensuing legal fight,
  the first phase of cleanup is underway.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Sugar growers have improved operations to reduce the phosphorous in
  the water that leaves their land. But the cornerstone of the plan is the
  creation of six marshes between the farmland and the Everglades to filter
  out phosphorous.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>However, a shortfall that could range from $22 million to $45 million
  already has developed, according to the district's calculations. Officials
  haven't decided how to make up the difference, although property taxes
  are a likely source.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>LARGO--(EnviroWorld)--Much to the disappointment of many homeowners
  in two subdivisions outside of Largo, residents will soon be forced to
  give up their septic tanks. After the city installs proposed new sewer
  lines during the next two years, state law will require residents in the
  two areas to connect with the sewers within one year, regardless of whether
  they vote to annex into the city, the Tampa Tribune reported.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Many homeowners in the Heights and Kent Place subdivisions northwest
  of the city say they want to keep their septic tanks because they don't
  want to pay sewer fees.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>The monthly sewer rate for Largo homes in the two neighborhoods is $13.13.
  Residents connected to city sewers living outside city limits pay $16.41
  per month.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Largo is offering residents in the two neighborhoods a discount on connection
  fees if they join the city, and will ask them to annex on a referendum
  Dec. 10.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Normally, Largo's sewer installation rates range from $500 to $2,000
  per house, depending on the location of the sewer tap on the house and
  the size of the lot. Residents would also have to pay a $845 connection
  fee.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>If residents choose to join the city, they would only pay $845 to use
  the sewer system. Residents will also have to pay for the disconnection
  of their septic tanks at a cost of $500 to $800.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>The county has hinted that it may be willing to pay for disconnecting
  residents' septic tanks, said Assistant City Manager Henry Schubert.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Largo is also considering offering financial assistance for new sewer
  customers in annexed areas.</P>

cost</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>WESLEY CHAPEL--(EnviroWorld)--On Monday, West Coast Regional Water Supply
  Authority agreed to negotiate with Pasco County to share the cost of resurfacing
  Quail Hollow Boulevard, but property owners remain unhappy, the St. Petersburg
  Times reported.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>The road is riddled with potholes and cracks. Many property owners blame
  a West Coast water project, which brought heavy loads of trucks to deliver
  pipes down the road last year, for the damage done to the road.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Residents are not pleased with the amount that the water authority has
  agreed to put towards the reconstruction of the road. The repair bill may
  total $1 million and West Coast has agreed to pay about 20 percent, or
  $200,000. Even with that help, 125 property owners along Quail Hollow would
  still face assessments of more than $6,000 each to resurface the road.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Residents feel that West Coast should pay for all the damaged caused
  since last year when the water project began, said Coni Shoda, incoming
  vice president of the Quail Hollow Community Organization.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>West Coast manager Jerry Maxwell maintained that the road was heavily
  damaged by other large vehicles before the piping trucks came, citing school
  buses, garbage trucks and building contractors' trucks as other sources
  of damage.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>The West Coast board directed its staff Monday to return with a proposed
  settlement by its December meeting.</P>

two workers</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>PERRY-- (EnviroWorld)-- Two workers were killed in the second magnesium
  explosion in a year at the Martin Electronics plant located about 12 miles
  out of Perry, the Tallahassee Democrat reported.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Something went wrong after about 9:20 p.m. when a spark, perhaps from
  electricity, ignited and caused the wooden building where 22-year-old Carl
  Fews and his co-worker Janice Lou Outland were working to go into flames.
  The flash of flames, which lasted only a few seconds, completely burned
  through Outland and Few's protective clothing. The two workers were wearing
  protective suits designed to protect them from heat as high as 5,000 degrees.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Fews and Outland worked in a 20-by-20 foot wooden building putting the
  highly-flammable magnesium onto a conveyor belt, which sifts the chemical
  into a finer, more pure substance.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Capt. Steve Spradley of the fire marshal's office said he isn't sure
  what caused the spark but speculates it was static electricity.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>John Peterson, director of administration for Martin Electronics, said
  he knew little about the explosion and refused to let a reporter and photographer
  view the plant.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>According to records, OSHA, which inspects businesses for safety hazards,
  has fined Martin Electronics more than $40,000 in the past two years for
  &quot;serious violations.&quot; Among the violations were not instructing
  employees on how to use protective equipment, allowing employees to work
  without protective coats and coveralls, having only one fire exit from
  a building when at least two are required, and not cleaning up spills of
  magnesium to prevent a fire. The fines were paid and the company corrected
  the problems.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>However, the company still faces a lawsuit filed by the family of 19-year-old
  Gregory Glombowski, who was killed almost a year ago to the day under similar
  circumstances. The family says their son's death could have been avoided.</P>

manatees</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>FT. LAUDERDALE-- (EnviroWorld)-- The first 10 months of 1996 have been
  the deadliest in decades for Florida's endangered manatees, and environmentalists
  worry that the toll could worsen as the manatees begin their seasonal migration,
  the Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel reported.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>So far this year, 388 manatees have died. But even though half the deaths
  were attributed to naturally occurring red tide, researchers say the deaths
  have increased. Last year, only 201 manatee deaths were recorded.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Only 2,639 manatees were counted in the U.S., most living in Florida.
  Although most manatees die of natural causes, such as stress from cold
  weather, humans were linked to 27 percent of manatee deaths in 1995, mostly
  from boat injuries. This year the percentage rate seems to have increased.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>This is why boating speed limits and no-wake zones will begin to be
  inforced in Florida.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>&quot;The main problem is that the speed limits and regulations are
  not being enforced. We need more marine patrol officers,&quot; said Judith
  Vallee, executive director of Save The Manatee Club. &quot;We think the
  root of the problem is that there's only 283 on-water officers for the
  whole state.&quot;</P>

headwaters</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>FOLKSTON, Ga.--(EnviroWorld)-- The Dupont Co. is moving ahead with plans
  to strip-mine the entire eastern edge of the famed Okefenokee Swamp, evoking
  fears that the digging may cause irreparable damage to one of the world's
  largest and purest freshwater wetlands, the Tallahassee Democrat reported.</P>
  <P>The Okefenokee Swamp drains into what becomes Florida's Suwannee's River,
  a national wild and scenic river. The Suwannee flows from the Georgia-Florida
  border, to a delta near Ceder Key, on Florida's Gulf of Mexico coast.</P>
  <P>Dupont has bought or leased more than 38,000 acres of piney woods from
  timber companies during the past few years to mine a sandy ridge next to
  Okefenokee for titanium dioxide, a shiny white mineral used to make paper,
  paint, plastic and hundreds of other products.</P>
  <P>The company plans to apply for state and federal environmental permits
  early next year. Mining would start in 2002 and last for 40 to 50 years.</P>
  <P>Dupont officials have promised to take whatever steps necessary to protect
  the Okefenokee. But several environmental groups say the mining will affect
  the water table and ruin the swamp and surrounding wetlands.</P>
  <P>Dupont's plan for mining titanium dioxide includes dredging up dozens
  of 15-acre pits up to 50 feet deep along the sandy ridge known as Trail
  Ridge. The ridge works as a natural dam to keep water in the swamp.</P>
  <P>After mining, the scarred land would be reclaimed and reestablished
  accordingly.</P>
  <P>Environmentalists, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials, geologists
  and others say the mining could destroy wetlands adjacent to the swamp,
  stir up natural drainage systems on the surface and alter the flow of ground
  water. If this happens, they say, water levels and the swamp's environment
  will be irrevocably damaged.</P>

<H3><A HREF="#anchor483565">Sugar industry attorney says growers exempt
from Amendment 5</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>FT. LAUDERDALE-- (EnviroWorld)-- A sugar industry attorney offered water
  managers his interpretation of the &quot;polluter pays&quot; amendment
  passed by voters, and he says that it does not apply to Everglades sugar
  growers, the Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel reported.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative attorney William Green said growers have
  cut their phosphorous runoff so much that they cannot be defined as polluters
  under the state's Everglades Forever Act and are, therefore, exempt from
  Amendment 5.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Under the Everglades Forever Act, sugar growers agreed to pay about
  $233 million of the estimated $700 million cost of the first phase of the
  Everglades cleanup, with taxpayers footing the remainder. However, Save
  Our Everglades has taken the position that the amendment repeals the act
  and forces sugar growers to pay more.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>&quot;The sugar industry's response under Amendment 5 is to further
  get out of their responsibility,&quot; said Charles Lee of the Florida
  Audubon Society.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>District officials must decide how to carry out the amendment's mandate
  that polluters in the Everglades Agricultural Area are to be made &quot;primarily
  responsible&quot; for the ecological damage they cause.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Green said sugar cane growers are cleaning their dirty Everglades-bound
  drainage so well that they probably deserve a rebate on pollution taxes
  they already are paying.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>The district governing board agreed to listen to other experts next
  month who will also offer alternative interpretations on how the board
  should go about the complicated task of allocating payments by farmers
  and other polluters if it decides they should change under Amendment 5.</P>

Since then, a handful of other residents have reported  spotting a member of the endangered species to the Florida Game and Fresh  Water Fish Commission.  </P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>If the sightings are confirmed through photographic documentation and  preserved tracks, it would be the first certified sighting of a panther  in the area in at least 25 or 30 years.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>But people probably saw a common bobcat, which can easily be confused  with a panther, said Jim Huffstadt, a game commission spokesman.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Gray-colored bobcats usually weigh about 50 pounds.  Panthers are about  twice that size, have longer tails and have a tawny coat.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>And Florida panthers don't like residential neighborhoods, Huffstadt  said.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Most of the roughly 30 panthers left in Florida's wild are located in  the far reaches of Collier County, he said.  </P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>But rumors of a Florida panther have persisted for at least three years  from Hutchinson Island to Fort Pierce, said Bob Przekop, manager of the  Savannas State Reserve, which runs east of U.S. 1.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;People say they've seen a cat with a long tail, bigger than a  bobcat, but a little thinner than a panther.

She was rescued from a wastewater treatment plant in  Houston before being flown to Florida.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Once free, she again took a northwestern turn, swimming up the west  coast to the Florida Panhandle, where she remained all summer before heading  back south in late September.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>But she never stopped.  Sweet Pea traveled through the Everglades National  Park as far south as Marathon and Wednesday arrived in Biscayne Bay.  She  continued on a northward track Thursday through Miami, north of the Rickenbacker  Causeway, Weigle said.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Although she is heading north at a time when manatees usually migrate  i the opposite direction, scientists aren't worried about her.  Many of  the animals congregate in the warm water adjacent to power plants.  She  should come across a couple of the plants if she maintains her northbound  course, Weigle said.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Sweet Pea is unusual because female manatees tend to stay in the same  place, although males often roam great distances, he said.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Scientists have been cataloging manatees based on scar patterns on their  skin.  Until Sweet Pea came along, however, they had never before identified  the same manatee on both coasts.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Such travels, though, probably have occurred because studies show east  and west coast manatees genetically are the same, Weigle said.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Another manatee renowned for his travels was dubbed Chessie after he  showed up in Chesapeake Bay in 1994 and was flown back to Florida.  Last  year, he again swam north as far as Rhode Island but made it back to Florida  on his own for the winter.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Chessie this summer was spotted as far north as Annapolis, Md., but  he lost his transmitter and scientists are unsure of his whereabouts.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><A NAME="anchor508808"></A></P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR><A HREF="../index.html">Return to today's headlines</A><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A HREF="#anchor508808">Cement plant's site plan rejected</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>NEWBERRY--(EnviroWorld)-- Alachua County's Development Review Committee  rejected Florida Rock Industries' site plan Thursday at a preliminary meeting  due to concerns by the Environmental Protection Department that the plan  lacked environmental monitoring, the Gainesville Sun reported.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Florida Rock will either have to work out the concerns with the Environmental  Protection Department or go to the county commission for assistance with  approval.  </P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Florida Rock says it will try to apply for final site plan approval  by Dec. 2 so it can be considered at the Dec. 19 committee meeting.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Plant opponents are hoping that the Environmental Protection Department's  issues will be enough to keep the plant from being built.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)-- Government officials announced Tuesday that
  entrance fees to visit the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, the Everglades, Appomattox
  Court House and many other of the nation's most popular national parks
  will soon double, The Associated Press reported.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Visitors to some wildlife refuges and recreation areas also will be
  charged fees for the first time. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said
  the income will pay for improvements at 106 public land sites.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>The new or increased fees for admission, snowmobiling, boating or back-country
  camping will help raise an estimated $30 million to $50 million over three
  years for sites managed by the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife
  Service and Bureau of Land Management, department officials said.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>&quot;Even with the pilot fee increase, a family of four can enjoy a
  week's visit to Yosemite, Yellowstone or Glacier national parks for less
  than it costs to see a first-run movie,&quot; Babbitt said.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>&quot;While everything else has gone up in price over the past 70 years,
  Yellowstone is still $10 per car,&quot; he said. &quot;That's less than
  the price of a good video of the park, and much less than it costs to visit
  an imitation Yellowstone at an amusement park in Florida.&quot;</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>The most significant increases under the trial program will occur beginning
  next year at four of the most-visited U.S. national parks -- Yellowstone,
  Yosemite, Grand Canyon and Grand Tetons -- where the cost of an annual
  pass per carload will go from the current $15 to $40 .</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>The fee at those parks will rise from the current $10 to $20 per car
  for seven days. Fees at most other identified sites will range from $2
  per person to about $20 per car.</P>

<H3><A HREF="#anchor1054475">EPA announces new air standards</A></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)-- Based on evidence claimed to show harm to
  human health and the environment, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
  today proposed new national air quality standards for particulate matter
  (soot) and ground-level ozone (smog).</P>
  <P>The PM standard currently calls for regulation of particles the size
  of 10 microns or smaller (PM- 10) in concentrations of 50 micrograms per
  cubic meter annually and 150 micrograms per cubic meter daily. The proposed
  PM standard calls for 2.5 microns or smaller (PM 2.5) in concentrations
  of 15 micrograms per cubic meter annually and 50 micrograms per cubic meter
  daily. </P>
  <P>EPA today also proposed maintaining the current standards for PM-10
  so that larger, coarse particles would continue to be regulated. The current
  ozone standard is .12 parts per million measured over one hour. EPA's proposed
  standard calls for .08 parts per million measured over eight hours. </P>
  <P>EPA also is seeking comment on several other options, including an ozone
  concentration of .09 parts per million measured over eight hours, as well
  as a range of ozone concentrations from .07 parts per million measured
  over eight hours to .12 parts per million measured over one hour, the current
  standard. On both proposed standards, EPA has also specified the way in
  which attainment of these standards would be measured.</P>
  <P>Because of the significance of the proposal, EPA will seek broad public
  comment on its recommended approach and on the need for any changes to
  the particulate matter and ozone proposal. The purpose of the comment period
  is to reach out to all stakeholders in order to obtain the best information
  available for determining the appropriate final standards.</P>
  <P>&quot;In the Clean Air Act, Congress required EPA to review and incorporate
  the best available science into public health standards to protect Americans
  from air pollution,&quot; said EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner. &quot;The
  EPA proposal would provide new protection to nearly 133 million Americans,
  including 40 million children. We will use the very best science to do
  what is necessary to protect public health in common-sense, cost-effective
  ways.&quot;</P>
  <P>Particulate matter (PM), or soot, comes largely from combustion from
  sources like power plants or large incinerators. Ozone is primarily the
  haze of chemicals from car exhausts and smoke-stack emissions that shrouds
  many cities on hot summer days. </P>
  <P>EPA and a board of independent scientists have reviewed 86 PM- related
  human-health studies, covering millions of people, that showed harmful
  effects from breathing particles at the current standard. The proposed
  standard, along with clean air programs already planned, would reduce premature
  deaths by 40,000 per year, and reduce serious respiratory problems in children
  by 250,000 cases per year. </P>
  <P>Another 185 of the latest ozone-related studies on human health also
  were reviewed. All of them showed harmful effects from ozone at the current
  standard, including more than 1.5 million incidences a year of significant
  respiratory problems, such as loss of lung capacity and exacerbation of
  both childhood and adult asthma. In addition to threatening health, ozone
  and PM can damage agricultural crops, and diminish visibility in national
  parks, in some cases by as much as 77 percent.</P>
  <P>Browner said, &quot;EPA has based its proposal on a thorough review
  of the best available science. We are now hoping to hear from a wide range
  of the American people, from scientists and environmentalists to industry
  experts, small business owners, doctors and parents, to receive the broadest
  possible public comment and input on this important issue.&quot;</P>

  <P>CRYSTAL RIVER--(EnviroWorld)-- Florida Power Corp.'s Crystal River nuclear

  They plan to expand sewer lines in areas that are now served by septic
  tanks.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>The county has purchased 160 acres near Homosassa Springs to build a

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>MIAMI--(EnviroWorld)-- Endangered Species such as the Florida panther
  and the manatee have caught the attention of conservationists, but how
  about the lowly, slimy sea slug?</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Sea slugs may not have their pictures branded on specialty license plates,
  but the jelly-like creatures are topping an international list of endangered
  species that are quickly vanishing, The Associated Press reported.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>The shell-less snails live in shallow coastal lagoons, eat algae and
  come i a variety of shapes, colors and sizes, ranging from 1/8 of an inch
  to 5 inches long.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>But coastal development and pollution are causing the creatures to slowly
  disappear from the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Playing an important role in maintaining the balance between algae and
  coral, the sea slug population has declined as much as 80 percent in the
  last 10 years.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>This has prompted marine biologists to put the sea slug at the top of
  The World Conservation Union's &quot;Red List&quot; of endangered species.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>&quot;We do know they are important to the coral reefs,&quot; said biologist
  Kerry Clark of the Florida Institute of Technology.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>&quot;They produce some of the fine adjustments that keep the system
  well-tuned.&quot;</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Clark said 33 slug species in the Keys are on the decline. One of the
  species -- the sea hare -- is thought to be extinct.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Pollution washing into shallow water during storms, silt being flushed
  off construction sites and sewage leaking into the water from septic tanks
  have all played a role in destroying slug habitat.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Clark's research helped put the Florida mollusks on a new list of international
  species at risk of extinction.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>It includes more than 5,200 species. The slugs are listed among the
  most endangered of species -- those that have experienced at least an 80
  percent decline over a decade.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Because mollusks are immobile, they tend to be easily threatened and
  very difficult to study.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Despite Clark's efforts to document their decline, there's still not
  enough information to place slugs on the federal endangered species list.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>BREVARD COUNTY--(EnviroWorld)-- Brevard County's natural treasures have
  long been known to fishermen and beachgoers, but county officials are marketing
  these resources to lure in new businesses, Florida Today reported.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>The Economic Development Commission of Florida's Space Coast has been
  conducting tours and cruises for business people to convince them that
  this is where their companies ought to be.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>&quot;Most of the companies come here because their top management wants
  to live here. They like living on the river; they like fishing in the ocean;
  they like driving by and seeing the waves in the morning,&quot; said Marilyn
  Waters, EDC chairwoman.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>County Commissioner Truman Scarborough feels that a balance of development
  and environmental conservation will help attract the kind of high tech
  business the Space Coast needs.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>&quot;Business executives in California tell me Florida is one of the
  few places they convince their employees to move to,&quot; Scarborough
  said. &quot;Remember, if the companies move, they have to worry about whether
  their employees are going to follow them or move down the street.&quot;</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Many have criticized the county's Environmentally Endangered Lands program
  which buys environmentally sensitive tracts of land with tax dollars. The
  program has been buying small pieces of South Brevard beaches to protect
  the nesting grounds of sea turtles. The land is being linked to the Archie
  Carr National Wildlife Refuge.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Some, like outdoorsman Bob Wille, say that buying small pieces of land
  is not cost-effective.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>&quot;In environmentalism, you want to preserve ecosystems. You want
  to do large purchases,&quot; he said.</P>

The city estimates that it could be losing as much as  $1 million a year by collecting trash from non-paying customers.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>City garbage coffers, they say, are shortchanged because of  hundreds  of illegally built additional homes, which are rented to people who do  not pay for garbage pickup.

One question asks employees to indicate a range of agreement  or disagreement with the statement:</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>- &quot;The primary customers of DEP should be environmental resources  and the public, not the regulated community.&quot; Another questions reads:</P>  <P>- &quot;DEP management will often pressure or order subordinates to  adopt a permitting or policy position proposed by a representative of the  regulated community.&quot;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Weis contends that &quot;some of the questions are balanced, some are  negative, some are positive,&quot; but they are the product of DEP's own  employees and they can agree or disagree with the statements.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;The employees wrote it. These are the questions they felt needed  to be asked.&quot;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>DEP spokesperson Joy Mills has told EnviroWorld that they welcome the  investigation.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;We're not perfect. If there are weaknesses we'd like to know what  they are so that we can work on improving them,&quot; Mills said.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Weis said DEP need not worry about the process &quot;if there is nothing  to these allegations, everything will come up rosy.&quot;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The next step in the investigation process will be a series of meetings  with DEP staff. Starting next week, PEER will tour central and north Florida  DEP district offices. Both Weis and PEER's attorney Jeff Ruch will attend  the meetings. No meeting is yet scheduled with Wetherell, Weis said.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;If she'd like to meet with us, we'd love to meet with her.&quot;  Weis said.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Next month, PEER will tour south Florida DEP District offices and finalize  the survey results, Weis said.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>A similar investigation of the State of Virginia's environmental agency  earlier this year resulted in several similar investigations by EPA, spurred  public hearings on alleged illegal water permits, led to charges filed  against state environmental managers, and contributed to the ouster of  the top agency official.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Weis said it was &quot;premature&quot; to decide if similar charges  will be filed in Florida.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>PEER has thousands of members in state and federal environmental agencies  across the nation, according to Weis.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><A NAME="anchor717814"></A></P><H3><HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR><A HREF="120496.html">Return to today's headlines</A></H3><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A HREF="#anchor717814">Florida near top of nation's hazard list</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--An environmental group says that Florida  is among the nation's worst places for accidental chemical spills, the  St. Petersburg Times reported.  </P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The group also ranks Hillsborough and Polk counties as among the top  counties in the United States for chemical spills. </P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The Florida Public Interest Research Group held a news conference Wednesday  in Tallahassee to mark the 12th anniversary of the Bhopal, India, chemical  accident, which killed 3,500 people.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Stressing that information on chemical accidents is not easy to collect  and is largely generated by industry, the group released a nationwide survey  that claims a chemical accident is reported 20 times every day across America.  </P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Florida was ranked ninth among the 50 states.

Spiller remained  stoic throughout the proceedings, under a barrage of criticism.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Spiller insisted his company is doing everything it can to be upfront  about the proposed $9.4 million cleanup.  &quot;I think it's important  we do a better job of communicating,&quot; he said.  &quot;But there's  nothing that we're hiding.&quot;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The plant produced elemental phosphorous, a material used to produce  food additives, pesticides, and flame retardants for decades before shutting  down in 1981.  The operation polluted a 155-acre area of land with low-level  radiation, arsenic, calcium fluoride, and thousands of gallons of phosphorous,  according to the company.  </P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The company plans to dig out all toxic materials on the site, move it  to a site near the river, and cap it with sod and a protective lining.   Several residents expressed displeasure with the proposal, saying they  wanted all hazardous materials picked up and shipped away. </P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The EPA has already tentatively approved the cleanup plan.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Spiller told residents the company would set up a public telephone number  for information on the Stauffer cleanup.

If Spicola rules in  the city's favor, he could fine Wahl or order him to remove the animals.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Meanwhile, Spicola said that Wahl should request a city variance which  would allow him to build a 7- to 8-foot fence at the center and that Wahl  should continue looking for relocation sites.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Earlier this year, after Spicola ordered a noise abatement study to  see which measures would reduce the noise, the city said building a 7-  to 8-foot fence along Wahl's eastern property line would reduce the noise.   However, the city code limits fences to 6 feet in height, so a variance  needs to be requested.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Assistant city attorney Jorge Martin said he doesn't think a variance  is likely to be granted, but wouldn't rule out the possibility.  Martin  said the city doesn't believe Wahl should keep large animals in a residential  neighborhood.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Wahl has run the nonprofit center out of his home since 1982, treating  injured animals.  Most are released to the wild, but some- including bobcats  and endangered Florida panthers- are caged in his yard.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Virginia Schwab, Wahl's next-door neighbor, said her home is about 10  feet from the cages and doesn't think a fence will eliminate the noise  she hears.  But she says a fence might be feasible if Wahl removes the  female panthers and bobcats, which are the biggest source of noise.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Spicola wants to see if a fence can be built.  And if it can, he says  he wants it built immediately so Wahl's neighbors can see if it works before  a final ruling is made.

Thus, they serve as an &quot;umbrella&quot;  for other plants and animals.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;When you protect the bear, you protect many other species, some  of which are, themselves, quite rare,&quot; Macdonald said.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The bears represent both the challenge and the opportunity in balancing  conservation and development in a state that heralds the arrival of about  1,000 residents a day.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Bear crossing signs mark a section of U.S. 19 thought to be a corridor  for the animals to pass between Chassahowitzka and the Annutteliga Hammock,  which contains 30,000 acres of forest.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The property, which is scheduled for subdivisions, is near the top of  the state's Conservation and Recreational Lands program list. CARL, the  largest single land-buying program in the nation, receives $150 million  each year from Florida's Preservation 2000 bonds.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>A portion of the $56 million Annutteliga Hammock project is scheduled  for purchase this year.  The buy would not only preserve the bear habitat,  but it would also link Chassahowitzka with the Withlacoochee State Forest.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Biologists say bridging the gaps between protected habitats is an important  strategy for maintaining the species in the future. Without corridors to  other bears, access to isolated gene pools would dry up.  </P>  <P>&nbsp;</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><A NAME="anchor446903"></A></P><H3><HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR><A HREF="../index.html">Return to today's headlines</A></H3><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A HREF="#anchor446903">Pinhook Swamp gets top CARL priority </A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>--(EnviroWorld)-- Lobbying efforts by environmentalists and local governments  succeeded in pushing 35,000 acres of swamp land into a top position on  the state Conservation and Recreation Lands purchase list, the Florida  Times-Union reported.

Three years later, the barge canal project  was stopped by court order and presidential decree because it would destroy  the free-flowing river and because there was no economic justification  for the dam's construction.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The first part of the scandal involved a 20-year congressional delay  in deauthorizing the barge canal project, mostly because of one Florida  member of the U.S. House of Representatives William Chappell of Marion  County and later Volusia County.  The second part of the scandal began  in 1990 when the project was finally deauthorized.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The 16-mile long backwater that formed behind the Rodman Dam was not  a true reservoir because it did not conserve water, instead it lost water  due to evaportation.  But in the 1970's it became an excellent fishing  area for bass.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>As fishing decreased in the pool, underwater plants, particularly hydrilla,  exploded.  For years the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers did their best to  manage Rodman as a fishing area.  They did research on hydrilla and paid  for a biologist to give daily care to the pool.  They paid for poison and  mechanical removal of aquatic plants and floating logs leftover from the  5,000-acre mechanically crushed hardwood forest.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Managing Rodman was expensive.  Fish kills occurred, manatees were squashed  to death in the structures and hydrilla and other aquatic plants flourished.   Many wanted restoration of the Ocklawaha to begin as soon as the canal  project was deauthorized.  But others wanted to keep Rodman Pool as a fishing  hole.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The Rodman Pool can be managed for bass and other sports fish, but at  a terribly expensive price.  The cost includes many major and recurring  expenses, including: The cost of maintaining Rodman Dam and replacement  of the dam every 20 years; The cost of maintaining Buckman Lock and its  replacement about every 20 years; The cost of construction and maintenance  of a boat lift over the dam if the lock is dismantled; The cost of keeping  invasive water plants from overwhelming the pool using mechanical removal,  poisons and drawdowns.  All of these methods last only a short time.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>There are also some other costs associated with the dam that are difficult  to quantify and are often overlooked.  These include:  The cost of preventing  breeding migratory fish such as shad and striped bass from traveling up  and down the Ocklawaha;  The cost of preventing manatee to safely travel  up the river for food and sanctuary; The cost of preventing the normal  nutrients developing in the floodplains of the Ocklawaha from reaching  the St. John's River.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The Ocklawaha is the largest tributary of the mighty St. John's and  its entrance into the St. John's is the estuary of the Ocklawaha.  Before  the Rodman Dam was closed the stretch of the St. John's near the mouth  of the Ocklawaha was a favorite place for bass fishermen.  This is no longer  true.  Other costs include losing 16 miles of prime fishing and canoeing  river, and also the cost of losing 16 miles of natural flood control.    Losing the ability to navigate sightseeing boats from the St. John's to  Silver Springs, and losing about 20 small-to-medium sized natural Florida  springs are costs are that also overlooked.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Intangible costs in other areas are also phenomenal, including:  The  cost of destroying 16 miles of the wildlife movement corridor for large  mammals from the forests on the St. John's to the forests along the Ocklawaha  and the Ocala National Forest;  The cost of the destroyed 5,000 acres of  floodplain hardwoods which was a prime habitat for game; The cost of reducing  the abundance and diversity of the fish fauna in Silver Springs.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Once free, the Ocklawaha will provide a myriad of things without any  costs to taxpayers, because the river maintains itself.

And by then, Florida's Comptroller wants to make sure taxpayers  don't have to pay for a lot of kitchen sinks.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The &quot;kitchen sink&quot; the Comptroller is worried about is the  kind former Florida Department of Environmental Protection assistant secretary  Dale Patchett said would be included in the &quot;truckloads of [leaking  underground tanks cleanup] reimbursement applications we will see on December  31.&quot; Patchett told lawmakers last summer that contractors who are  submitting their cleanup bills to the state for reimbursement under a law  that ends this year would flood DEP with many possibly bogus claims.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Then during a Governor and Cabinet meeting last month,  Florida Comptroller  Bob Milligan unleashed a barrage of criticism of the DEP and of environmental  cleanup contractors. Milligan criticized the DEP for understaffing its  underground tanks auditing program, saying the backlog of cases was costing  the state millions.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;There's a significant amount of unallowable expenses here,&quot;  Milligan said. &quot;It's simply unacceptable.&quot;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>DEP audits have turned up more than $2 million in fraudulent claims  from companies seeking state reimbursements. That figure comes from the  25 completed audits out of a pool of 11,000 reimbursement applications  dating back 10 years. The auditing program has two full-time staff members,  and one part-timer.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;It doesn't take Albert Einstein to figure out it will take over  500 years to complete the audits with the current manpower,&quot; Milligan  said.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>DEP Secretary Virginia Wetherell agreed with Milligan's critique, and  promised to improve the system by January.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;We want to make sure that we don't overpay people,&quot; Wetherell  said. &quot;It's true that we don't have enough people to do sufficient  audits for this program.&quot;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>But improving that system may prove difficult to do, according to estimates  given to EnviroWorld by DEP's top auditor. And the dollar amounts likely  to be recovered from rigorous audits of reimbursement payments may be overstated.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>DEP Inspector General Pinky Hall concedes that most of the $2 million  the Comptroller was so upset about was recovered from the now infamous  CCG and PACO criminal fraud cases settled in Tampa over three years ago.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;I don't know what all the screaming was about,&quot; Hall told  EnviroWorld. &quot;Possibly [Milligan] was concerned about all the new  players at the Department.&quot; </P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>On October 1, DEP split the Bureau in charge of administering the tanks  program and hired a new tanks Bureau chief with no previous tanks program  experience.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>But that new chief, Mike Sole, a former Marine Lieutenant who served  under then-General Milligan during the Desert Storm war, is bullish about  his program's efficiency in dealing with the work load.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;Our reimbursement [application] review is as detailed as it can  be,&quot; Sole said. &quot;We're still disallowing 15 to 18 percent [of  the applications' value].&quot;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Sole, whose first months in charge have earned him high marks from staff  and informed observers, said it was too early to tell if the reimbursement  applications that come in this month are showing signs of the kitchen sink's  presence. &quot;There's been a substantial increase in applications,&quot;  Sole said. &quot;But I don't think we'll see the 25 percent disallowance  as we've seen in the past.&quot;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Sole estimated that with over 6,000 applications are currently in the  system, it would be next August before the last minute's load is processed.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The extra staff Milligan wants to see auditing those payments may be  hard to find, Pinky Hall admitted.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;We're going to ask [the Legislature] for maybe 10 new auditors  to work on reimbursement payments,&quot; she said.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Those ten would each perform about five audits per year, Hall estimated.  And that extra staff might recover about a $1 million a year, total, according  to a &quot;very iffy estimate&quot; Hall said.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Those ten new auditor positions would cost the state about $325,000  in annual salaries, Hall estimated.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><A NAME="anchor1098401"></A></P><P><A HREF="../index.html"><HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR>Return to today's headlines<HR ALIGN=LEFT></A></P><H3><A HREF="#anchor1098401">EPA has toll-free number, e-mail for air qualitycomments</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)-- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  has established a new toll-free telephone number and electronic mail addresses  to accept public comment on its recent proposal to strengthen air quality  standards for ground-level ozone and particulates.

This represents a 15 percent reduction from  current utility levels and a five percent nationwide reduction from all  sources.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>This action will help protect public health and the environment in several  ways. It will help cities attain and maintain EPA's national atmospheric  (ambient) air quality standard for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which protects  humans from lung damage and respiratory illness. However, NOx emissions  are also transformed into other air pollutants, such as ground-level ozone  (smog), fine particulate matter and nitric acid, which also negatively  impact human health (e.g.,childhood</P>  <P>respiratory problems, premature mortality, acute eye irritation). NOx  emissions also damage crops, buildings and monuments; obscure visibility;  contribute to the acidity of lakes and</P>  <P>streams; and create nutrient imbalances in waterways.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The final rule, issued under authority of the Acid Rain provisions of  the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, sets NOx emission limitations for most  of the 1,090 coal-fired electric utility plants in the United States that  have generation capacity above 25 megawatts. Electric utilities contribute  approximately 33% of total atmospheric NOx emissions.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Specifically, the action: 1) revises earlier NOx standards called Phase  1 for approximately 600 dry-bottom, wall-fired and tangentially-fired boilers  in the U.S.; and 2) sets new emissions limitations called Phase 2 for approximately  145 wet-bottom boilers, cyclones, cell burner boilers and vertically-fired  boilers. EPA estimates that 85-90 percent of the facilities affected by  Phase</P>  <P>2 can meet the new standards when retrofit with Low NOx burners, the  most common NOx control technology available to electric utilities today.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>As part of the Clinton Administration's regulatory reinvention efforts,  EPA is encouraging states to adopt an &quot;emissions cap and trade&quot;  program as an alternative to meeting boiler-specific emission limits. A  cap-and-trade program promotes cost-effective and flexible industry compliance  by allowing utilities that over-control emissions at one plant to offset  excess emissions at another plant. However, the cap and trade alternative  must result in lower NOx emissions than would result from meeting the individual  plant-by- plant emission limits.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The action will appear soon in the Federal Register, but will be computer-accessible  earlier through EPA's electronic bulletin board system, the Technology  Transfer Network (TTN) at 919-541-5742 (backup number for access problems  is 919-541-5384).

Scientists are unclear about what causes  the diseases, how they are spread, and how to stop them.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Scientists worry that the diseases could threaten the life of the entire  reef. For a number of years, a few other diseases have threatened the reefs,  but they appear infrequently and scientists say they don't kill tissue.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The new disease -- white pox -- was discovered three months ago by a  University of Georgia scientist. James Porter inspected the reef after  hearing that there were strange white blotches on elkhorn coral off Key  West.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;The second I got in the water and looked at the coral reef, I  knew there was trouble,&quot; Porter said in a telephone interview from  his Athens, Ga. office. He said formerly lush areas of elkhorn corals were  dead or dying. </P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Blotches ranging in size from a quarter to more than 10 inches in diameter  scarred the corals, which can grow several feet tall. The white skeleton  showed through in the infected areas, Porter said.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;The tissue melts off the skeleton, producing large amounts of  mucus in the water, and then the bare skeleton is exposed underneath,&quot;  he said. &quot;White pox  is reported nowhere else in the world.&quot;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Presently confined to three reefs about 12 miles south of Key West,  white pox seems to afflict only elkhorn corals found in 3 feet to 15 feet  of water.Up to a fourth of each 1,320-foot reef is infected. Porter estimates  that the white pox will spread only two feet each year.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;Right now we don't know if this is a natural occurrence or an  expression of pollution problems,&quot; Porter said.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The second disease, white plague,  is more familiar.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>A strain of it infected the Keys in the 1970s, then seemed to disappear,  said John Halas, resource manager for the Florida Keys National Marine  Sanctuary. Like white pox, the earlier strain left blotches and killed  tissue.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>In the summer of 1995, a different, more virulent strain began attacking  elliptical star coral from the upper Keys to the Dry Tortugas, an isolated  island cluster 70 miles west of Key West.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Now found only in the lower Keys, white plague surrounds the lower part  of the coral and consumes the living tissue.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;The disease tends to grow from the bottom of the coral and goes  up. Sometimes it may come halfway up or three-quarters of the way up,&quot;  Halas said. &quot;The disease is killing off the coral as it builds up.&quot;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>He said scientists have no clues at this point as to what is causing  the organism to invade the coral.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Both diseases spread in the summer and go into remission the rest of  the year, scientists say. Some theorize polluted water may be the cause.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Coral needs clear water to flourish. The waters off Key West are polluted  by sewage runoff and pollution from Florida Bay. The bay, which drains  the Everglades, has long suffered from choking algae blooms.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Reefs, limestone structures formed by the skeletons of coral, are found  in shallow, tropical waters. Living coral attach themselves to the reef  and contribute to its growth when they die.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Thousands of plant and animal species live in and around the reefs.  If they perish, larger creatures will also die and ecological ruin would  follow, scientists warn.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Coral experts plan to hold meetings early next year to discuss the white  pox and white plague problem. They are also lobbying the state and federal  governments for additional research money.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;We know more about Mars and the moon than about corals,&quot;  said Craig Quirolo, founder of Reef Relief, a Key West conservation agency  that first detected the diseases and alerted scientists to the latest outbreaks.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;</P><P><A NAME="anchor548781"></A></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><A HREF="../index.html"><FONT SIZE=+1><HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR>Return to today's headlines<HR ALIGN=LEFT></FONT></A></P><H3><A HREF="#anchor548781">First Farm Bill purchase made to help Everglades</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>WEST PALM BEACH--(EnviroWorld)-- The U.S. Department of the Interior  made a  $19.1 million  purchase of a 2,200 acre tract in an effort to create  a buffer zone between the Everglades and development, the Ft.

The Tomahawks are launched from ships and submarines in the Atlantic  Ocean and gulf and land at Eglin.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Initial reaction from the Keys has been hesitant to the anti-missile  testing, which would be conducted by the Army, Navy and Air Force.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Officials do not object to the testing but would prefer that top priority  be given to launching the test missiles from aircraft rather than land  sites in the Keys, Monroe County Commission Chairman Keith Douglass said  Tuesday.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;We said, 'Would you consider the aircraft launches, thoroughly?'&quot;  Douglass said.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Keys launches would be a new twist to an earlier gulf testing proposal  rejected last year. Defense officials opted, instead, to test the missiles  at White Sands Missile Test Range, N.M., and in the Marshall Islands in  the Pacific Ocean.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The gulf option, however, has been revived in part because of the high  cost of sending warships and equipment to the Pacific range. Also, the  White Sands range is too short for some tests and civilians must be evacuated  from some places during tests, said program spokeswoman Janet Tucker.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>A decision is not expected to take place until 1998 after the environmental  impact study is completed and no launches would take place before 1999,  Tucker said.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Weapons that would be tested include the PAC-3, an advanced version  of the Patriot missile that was employed with little success against Scud  missiles during the Persian Gulf War.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The other interceptors would be the Theater High Altitude Defense missile,  or THAAD, designed to strike targets at higher altitudes than the Patriot  and the Navy Area Defense System.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Most of the target missiles would be the two-stage HERA, which uses  Minutemen booster rockets. The first stage would splash down shortly after  launch. The second stage of HERAs launched from the Keys would impact near  the Panhandle coast while those fired from the Panhandle would land in  the middle of the gulf nearly 200 miles west of Tampa.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><A NAME="anchor34272"></A></P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR><A HREF="../index.html">Return to today's headlines</A><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A HREF="#anchor34272">Copper polluter indicted on federal charges</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>LARGO--(EnviroWorld)-- A former Universal Circuits employee has been  charged in a federal indictment with polluting Pinellas County's sewer  system with copper, the St. Petersburg Times reported.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>David W.

Ellington and his colleagues came up with an answer as to how  those tiny flapping wings can get creatures off the ground. They say insects  create a whirling cylinder of air above their wings that provides lift.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Ellington's team studied hawkmoths with a wingspan of about 4 inches.  In one set of experiments, the moths were snared in a loop of thread attached  to a stiff wire to keep them in the breeze from a wind tunnel. The wind  contained thin streams of smoke to show how the air flowed over the wings.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The telltale evidence appeared above and just behind the front edge  of the wing when the moth flapped down. The layer of air curled up into  a cylinder, maintaining low pressure that pulled the top of the wing upward  and providing enough lift for flying.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>To show how insects produce this air cylinder, Ellington and his colleagues  built a computer-controlled mechanical moth with a 3-foot wingspan.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Ellington and colleagues found that insects use the same strategy as  paper airplanes. The cylinder of air continuously slips toward the wingtip,  which apparently keeps it from growing too big.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><A NAME="anchor42105"></A></P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR><A HREF="../index.html">Return to today's headlines</A><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A HREF="#anchor42105">Program gives money and motivation to spruceup Orlando areas</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>ORLANDO-- (EnviroWorld)-- More than 30 Orlando neighborhoods found out  that they will be getting a gift from the city of $153,000 for community  enhancement projects, the Orlando Sentinel reported.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Mayor Glenda Hood announced that 34 neighborhood organizations will  receive 1997 Neighborhood Matching Grants. &quot;We want to offer citizens  the necessary tools to create positive change, but we also want to allow  them the freedom to do what they feel is best for their neighborhoods,&quot;  Hood said.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The program was created to encourage residents to come together to address  community needs and gives neighborhood associations money for bricks-and-mortar  projects, public safety and cultural, recreational or educational programs.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>To receive a grant, neighborhood associations must match the city's  contribution, which can be up to $5,000 with volunteer hours, cash, in-kind  services, equipment or supplies.

The group claims the comments raise doubts  about her commitment to the federal-state enforcement partnership.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The letter was written in response to statements made in a December  15  New York Times article. In the article, Browner found faults with the  enforcement commitment of &quot;a number of</P>  <P>states&quot; that have been &quot;emboldened by the anti-environmental  sentiment that began here in Congress.&quot;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&quot;States are very concerned about what appears to be a retreat on  your part from the partnership relation which had been carefully and, in  some instances, painfully built over the past four years. State commissioners...are  disappointed to be the objects of your apparent lack of trust,&quot; said  the ECOS letter.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The group asked Browner to &quot;publicly renew your commitment to partnership  with the states and acknowledge the accomplishments which states have made.  We believe that is the best way to correct the impression which this article  has, unfortunately, created.&quot;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>One EPA source said that Browner's statements were not meant as an indictment  of all the states. &quot;The vast majority of states are doing their enforcement  job very well,&quot; the source said, but</P>  <P>there are &quot;a handful of states&quot; where the proper enforcement  efforts &quot;are lacking.&quot; Additionally, some states have developed  environmental compliance audit privilege policies that trouble EPA.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>ECOS also saw a &quot;strong partisan flavor&quot; in Browner's comments.  &quot;We note that the states mentioned throughout the report all have  Republican governors.

<H1><A NAME="anchor298891"></A>Federal Court approves &quot;ability-to-pay&quot;
Superfund settlement</H1>
<B><BR>
by DOMINICK J. GRAZIANO<BR>
columnist<BR>
TAMPA</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>In <B><I>U. S. v.</I> <I>Bay Area Battery</I>,</B> the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Florida upheld a <I>non-de
minimis</I> Superfund settlement based on potentially responsible parties
(PRPs) &quot;ability-to-pay.&quot; In the past several years EPA has used
ability-to-pay settlements in <I>de minimis</I> settlements, but not with
<I>non-de minimis</I> PRPs. (De minimis PRPs are those PRPs that have contributed
relatively small quantities of hazardous waste to a Superfund site). In
<I>Bay Area Battery</I>, the Federal District Court upheld one of the first
legal challenges to EPA's expanding use of such formulas.<BR>
<BR>
In 1992 some large quantity generator PRPs had agreed to conduct a $15 million
soil clean up and pay the government $1 million toward reimbursement of
EPA's past site costs. The settlement was directed at resolving liability
for contaminated soils and offered no contribution protection, nor did it
resolve potential liability for natural resource or groundwater damages.<BR>
<BR>
In 1994 EPA sought to recover full reimbursement of its remaining $2.6 million
in past site costs from other PRPs. Most importantly, EPA agreed to reduce
each settling PRP's share of liability by an &quot;ability-to-pay calculation&quot;
based on each company's financial disclosures. EPA also offered the &quot;ability-to-pay&quot;
PRPs full settlement of all Superfund liability for the site in addition
to contribution protection from claims for reimbursement from other PRPs.<BR>
<BR>
In working toward the settlement, EPA required the PRPs to provide information
on their financial condition including tax returns and balance sheets. EPA
used the information to calculate the amount each PRP could pay while still
remaining viable. Specifically, the court found that EPA was allowing the
parties to pay without &quot;selling off significant assets or filing bankruptcy.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The major PRPs in the initial settlement challenged the &quot;ability-to-pay&quot;
settlement. The major PRPs challenged the settlement on several grounds,
all of which were rejected by the court. Specifically, the court found that
the negotiations were procedurally fair because they included notice to
all PRPs at the site. Most importantly perhaps, the court rejected the need
for EPA to establish settlements based on comparative fault, concluding
that EPA has the flexibility to consider financial factors not related to
liability apportionment.<BR>
<BR>
In this particular instance the settlement involved &quot;individuals and
small Mom and Pop businesses with little to contribute toward cleaning up
the site.&quot; Finally, the court found that EPA had the authority to grant
protection from contribution claims finding that a cost sharing allocation
that favors the government was consistent with Superfund which gives the
&quot;government's claim clear statutory priority over the [major groups]
claim on these settlor's fund.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>EPA issues proposed rule on hazardous waste identification</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>EPA has issued a proposed rule that would amend the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) by establishing constituent specific
exit levels for low risk solid waste that are designated as hazardous because
they are listed, or have been mixed with, derived from, or contain listed
hazardous waste. Under the proposal generators of listed hazardous wastes
that meet the self-implementing exit levels would no longer be subject to
the hazardous waste management system under Subtitle &quot;C&quot; of RCRA
for listed wastes.<BR>
<BR>
Under EPA's current hazardous waste identification rules a waste is considered
hazardous in one of two ways. First, if the waste exhibits one of four hazardous
waste characteristics (toxicity, corrosivity, ignitability or reactivity),
the waste is considered hazardous until it no longer exhibits any characteristics.<BR>
<BR>
Alternatively, a waste can be considered hazardous and required to be managed
as hazardous if it is a &quot;listed&quot; waste. Under EPA's regulatory
regime listed wastes contain constituents at concentrations which pose risks
which are unacceptable for human or environmental exposure. The listed wastes
are further broken down into two general categories: One composed of waste
generated from non-specific sources and one composed of waste generated
from specific sources. Two other sets of listed waste include discarded
commercial chemical products, off specification species, container residues,
and spill residues which are hazardous under specific circumstances.<BR>
<BR>
Under the proposed rule listed wastes will be exempt from hazardous waste
regulation by establishing exit levels that are risk based concentrations
at which a human or wild animal species could be directly or indirectly
exposed to the exempted waste, and would be unlikely to suffer adverse health
effects. According to EPA the exposure scenario used to develop such levels
assume that the exempted waste would no longer be subject to Subtitle &quot;C&quot;
control, but rather will be managed as a solid waste in one of a variety
of non-hazardous waste management units regulated under Subtitle &quot;D.&quot;
Wastes that satisfy the exit levels, but nonetheless still exhibit any characteristics,
<BR>
must still be managed as a characteristically hazardous waste.<BR>
<BR>
The proposed rule has many other unique features and also addresses the
mixture and derived from rules and the contained-in policy. According to
EPA the proposed rule will &quot;encourage pollution prevention, waste minimization,
and the development of innovative waste treatment technologies.&quot; EPA
will accept public comments on the proposed rule until February 20, 1996.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>EPA issues final NESHAP for ship building and ship repair surface coating
operations</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The EPA has issued a final rule covering the National Emissions
Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for ship building and ship
repair surface coating operations. The NESHAP requires existing and new
major sources of these emissions to control them using the maximum available
control technology (MACT) to control hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). Primarily,
the NESHAP is focused on surface coatings and solvents used in marine coating
operations. According to EPA the HAP emitted by such facilities includes
xylene, toluene, ethylbenzene, methyl ketone, methyl isobutyl, keton ethylene
glycol and glycol ethers. According to <BR>
EPA these pollutants can cause reversible or irreversible toxic effects
following exposure including irritation of the eye, nose, throat, and skin
and damage to the blood cells, heart, liver and kidneys. Under the proposal
EPA expects to reduce base line emissions of HAP by 24 percent ( or 350
tons per year).<BR>
<BR>
The final rule is applicable to all existing and new ship building and repair
facilities for all major sources of HAP or for facilities that are located
at plant sites that are major sources. Under the Clean Act Amendments of
1990 major sources is a source, or group of sources, located within a contiguous
area and under common control that emits or has a potential to emit 10 tons
per year or more of any individual HAP or 25 tons per year or more of any
combination of HAP at any given time.</BLOCKQUOTE>

details plan for Everglades restoration, funding</A></STRONG></H1>
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Summary of issues important to Florida's water management
districts.</STRONG></CENTER>
<P><B>by E. Lee Worsham</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>AT THE EVERGLADES National Park on February 19, 1996, Vice President
Gore promised to accelerate the Everglades restoration by proposing to raise
nearly $700 million for land purchases and for the completion of work in
progress. <BR>
The Administration's plan would expand the $768 million program already
planned under the Everglades Forever Act by adding another 100,000 acres
to the marsh system at the southern end of the Everglades Agricultural Area,
including the acquisition of the Talisman Sugar Co. land in western Palm
Beach County. <BR>
It would also provide money to buy 60,000 acres for the Everglades buffer,
a strip of reservoirs and marshes between the conservation areas (original
Everglades) and the populated areas of Broward and Palm Beach counties.
<BR>
The plan would also speed up progress on restoring the meanders of the Kissimmee
River, improving fresh water deliveries to Florida Bay, expanding Everglades
National Park, and building a marsh near the 20-Mile Bend to keep some of
the water in the system which would otherwise flow to tide via the West
Palm Beach Canal.<BR>
Funding for the proposal is proving controversial. Some $245 million would
be raised over seven years through a one-cent-per-pound increase in the
marketing fee collected through the federal price-support system, with another
$400 million from congressional appropriations over the next four years.
<BR>
Implementation of this proposal would require bipartisan support in Congress,
so Everglades advocates are only cautiously optimistic. <BR>
Gore's announcement comes at a time when Governor Chiles is questioning
the wisdom behind environmentalists' campaign to get a two-cent-per-pound
federal tax on Florida sugar to help pay for the Everglades restoration
program. <BR>
Also, Senator Bob Graham has recently been instrumental in getting $200
million in the Senate-passed farm bill for Everglades land acquisition.
An aide to Senator Graham has expressed concern that Vice President Gore's
announcement may &quot;cloud&quot; the chances for getting that money since
if the Gore plan fails, the Everglades could get nothing.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Suwannee River Water Management District hosts Intergovernmental Conference
for protection of the Suwannee River</H3>
On February 7, 1996, officials from Georgia, Florida, and the Federal Government
met with private groups to discuss ways to protect the Suwannee River Basin.
Fifty-seven percent of the nearly 10,000 square mile Suwannee River Basin
is in Georgia, and at least 57 government agencies have regulatory jurisdiction
over activities in the river basin. <BR>
The meetings focused on how the river and estuary downstream in Florida
is impacted by land uses and water quality north of the state line. Not
content to simply discuss means to improve coordination and communication,
the group was looking for improvements and other things which can actually
be done on the ground to protect the river system.<BR>
After presentations were made, it appears that Florida is ahead of Georgia
in purchasing land for conservation and in identifying water quality concerns.
The Suwannee River Water Management District's land acquisition program,
implemented for the purpose of preventing harmful impacts to the river,
resulted in the purchase of floodplain areas to protect developments from
flooding and to prevent pollution and erosion from other human activities.
<BR>
The district has already purchased 61,000 acres and plans to acquire another
40,000 more with funds from the State's Preservation 2000 Program. By way
of contrast, Georgia's Preservation 2000 program has already ended after
buying slightly more than 100,000 acres, although less than 1,000 acres
are within the Suwannee River Basin. Georgia has, however, begun a new River
Care 2000 Program which will purchase additional lands and development rights.
<BR>
The new initiative has been applauded by the Suwannee Audubon Society and
appears to be an effort to avert litigation which occurred among Florida,
Georgia, and Alabama over protecting the Apalachicola River Watershed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Ecosystem Management Program is implemented for Withlacoochee River</H3>
The Florida Department of Environmental Protection is now in the process
of establishing an ecosystem management area to include the entire Withlacoochee
River Basin. <BR>
In responding to concerns that the DEP's activities will result in just
another layer of bureaucracy, the DEP has stated that the reality will be
the opposite-the result will be the integration of the activities of the
Army Corps of Engineers, the Southwest Florida Water Management district,
the State Game and Freshwater Fish Commission, and the Florida Division
of Forestry. <BR>
The effort will be to end the case-by-case, reactive and site-specific nature
of these regulatory programs. The means to integrate these programs will
be to develop an integrated plan and to implement specific programs designed
to improve the quality and quantity of the Withlacoochee's water.<BR>
The Withlacoochee project is only the second ecosystem management group
in the State to get started, although six pilot programs were implemented
by the DEP in 1994. Water quality is generally very good in the Basin, which
winds through Citrus, Hernando and Pasco counties. Recent concerns have
been raised about low water levels in Lake Tsala Apopka, and the River itself
hit its record low flow in 1993. A great deal of wetland drainage has occurred
in the past to support agriculture, primarily grazing, and the river basin
drains much more quickly than before the loss of its wetlands.<BR>
The challenge ahead is to coordinate a massive organization job, raise money,
and to motivate the agencies and the potentially affected landowners to
air their concerns and to facilitate more effective working relationships.
The DEP believes that the primary benefit will be that the agencies will
be able to better coordinate their permitting with the goal of cutting in
half the time it takes to get permits for new projects.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Attorney General's opinion paves way for draining Rodman Reservoir</H3>
In early February, Attorney General Bob Butterworth gave the opinion that
the state can drain the Rodman Reservoir without further legislation or
Cabinet action. This action buttressed the claims of the Florida Department
of Environmental Protection, which has contended that it can lower the reservoir
and restore the Oklawaha River as soon as it obtains the requisite federal
and St. Johns River Water Management District permits.<BR>
The Rodman Dam was built as a key part of the now-abandoned Cross-Florida
Barge Canal project in the 1960s. The reservoir in Putnam and Marion counties
has become a prime bass fishing and recreational spot. <BR>
Local legislators disagree with the Attorney General's opinion and are not
yet about to concede defeat. In response to a request from DEP, Butterworth
opined that the Legislature approved the Cross Florida Greenway Management
Plan in 1993, which included the option of restoring the Oklawaha. <BR>
Butterworth further stated that the DEP has since advised the Legislature
of its decision to restore the Rodman Dam, and the Legislators took no subsequent
action to alter the Plan. Accordingly, the Attorney General advised that
the DEP may proceed with the restoration of the river without further legislative
approval.<BR>
Now that the DEP is armed with this opinion, the restoration will still
require some $2 million in legislative appropriations for the agency's plan
of minimum restoration, which will cover blocking the Buckman Lock and then
breaching the Rodman Dam and dikes in the reservoir.<BR>

utility bills</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CAPE CORAL--(EnviroWorld)--The real costs of a growing city
have shocked some residents of Cape Coral, the St. Petersburg Times reported.
Hundreds of properties have been foreclosed after bills to cover $206 million
in improvements to the area's utilities came due.<BR>
<BR>
City leaders approved the much-needed project to extend water and sewer
lines to neighborhoods which had outgrown their septic tanks. Cape Coral's
population has grown from 12,000 to 85,000 in 25 years, and, in terms of
land area, it is the second largest city in Florida, though only a quarter
of it is developed.<BR>
<BR>
But the residents who had to shoulder the costs, got bills as high as $17,000.
Then they found out that government properties had gotten a free ride, and
owners of property larger than two acres had received discounts. Tempers
flared. <BR>
<BR>
The average bill for a 10,000 square foot lot was $10,000. While some residents
have anteed up the full bill, others have arranged to pay over as many as
18 years, with a 6 percent interest rate. The city has liens on those residents'
homes.<BR>
<BR>
But by last week, the city had foreclosed on 138 property owners who had
made no payments, Don Forrer, the city's business director, told the Times.
The city is in the process of foreclosing on another 250 properties, he
said. Forrer added that many of those properties were vacant lots, or belonged
to out-of-state residents. He said that hardship extensions had been given
to those who needed them. Still, the bills have resulted in a number of
For Sale signs in the city.<BR>
<BR>
The city has now agreed to charge the government properties for their share,
but many of the city's residents told the Times that the hostility that
the situation has provoked has diminished the positive aspects of the improvements.<BR>
<BR>
After the Wall Street Journal wrote about Cape Coral's utility troubles,
shocked Cape Coral leaders launched a $2,000 counterpublicity campaign.
They ran a full-page ad in the Cape Coral Daily Breeze defending the system.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The big problem is the image of being a controversial community where
you have this negativism going on between the city and the community,&quot;
said Cape Coral Chamber of Commerce president Doug Lockard. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CRYSTAL RIVER--(EnviroWorld)--The Crystal River nuclear power
plant could down within 15 years, and all the nuclear waste the plant has
generated may have no place to go, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
While Florida Power and Light, the utility that operates the Crystal River
Plant, has paid hefty fees to the Department of Energy in return for promises
that the DOE would take its waste, those promises are coming up empty so
far. In the meantime, Crystal River is running out of on-site storage space
for its spent fuel.<BR>
<BR>
The 13.5-foot-tall spent-fuel canisters are stored in pools at the plant.
The pools are half-full now, and utility officials say room will run out
by the year 2010. At that time the plant would have to be shut down, six
years ahead of schedule. Not only would the would the utility lose the generator
early, but the decommissioning cost would rise by $500 million to $1.7 billion
because of the nuclear waste remaining at the site.<BR>
<BR>
DOE has been paid $12 billion by utilities nationwide to take their nuclear
waste--promising to take Crystal River's waste by 1998--but for now, the
department has no place to put it. It's proposed Yucca Mountain disposal
site in Nevada has met with heavy opposition, and prospects are dim.<BR>
<BR>
With the DOE refusing to take the waste, Florida Power and Light will either
have to pay a commercial nuclear plant to take the waste, or store it at
the site in above-ground metal casks. The utility has joined 24 other utilities
in suing the DOE to force the department to take their waste. That decision
is pending.<BR>
<BR>
Florida has five nuclear power plants. The Crystal River Plant supplies
20 percent of the electricity used by the area it serves, and produces a
ton of hazardous waste each year.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CRYSTAL RIVER--(EnviroWorld)--A possible solution has been found
for cleanup snags that have kept Kings Bay full of algae and silt, the St.
Petersburg Times reported. Local environmental officials have found a suitable
place to put dredged muck from the site-- a pit in the Crystal River State
Buffer Preserve--that would eliminate construction costs.<BR>
<BR>
Those savings and increased aid from the state could allow officials to
vacuum a wider area around Kings Bay and clean up pesky mats of lyngbya
algae from other area waters. <BR>
<BR>
The project is part of the states Surface Water Improvement and Management
program (SWIM) and will improve the popular swimming and diving area, which
includes Hunter Springs. SWIM funding is expected to be increased to $400,000
if local officials actually begin work on the project.<BR>
<BR>
The county's environmental planner, Gary Maidhof, said he will ask state
and federal agencies to modify project permits to include the new disposal
site and expanded areas. Those modifications will be presented to the County
Commission and the Crystal River City Council. <BR>
<BR>
The county then will seek a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
to work inside a wildlife refuge. <BR>
<BR>
Maidhof told the Times the county probably wants a firm to begin dredging
within the next few months.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>LARGO--(EnviroWorld)--The city of Largo is adding more reclaimed
water lines in the southwest part of the city, the St. Petersburg Times
reported. About 850 homes will be able to connect to the system, and for
a small permit fee plus $7 a month, residents can water their lawns as much
as they like.<BR>
<BR>
Reclaimed water is partially treated wastewater which is not drinkable,
but is safe for lawns. Largo reclaims about 50 percent of its water, and
expects to reclaim nearly all of it by the year 2001. <BR>
<BR>
The city's has received millions of dollars in grants from the Southwest
Florida Water Management District for its reclamation projects, partly because
the area's water supply is so threatened.<BR>
<BR>
Largo's reclaimed water information specialist, Anthony Andrade, said several
neighborhoods have petitioned the city for reclaimed water lines. Those
neighborhoods most likely to get them already have saltwater intrusion in
their underground water supplies, he told the Times.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Beach, according to Army report</STRONG> </A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>BELLEAIR BEACH--(EnviroWorld)--Bellair Beach and its coastal
waters were used for target practice in World War II, and some unexploded
bombs are still around, but an Army Corps of Engineers study found little
to worry about, the St. Petersburg Times reported. <BR>
<BR>
Because only a few land rockets have been found in recent years and human
contact with any deep water rockets pose little threat, the Corps will recommend
that no further action be taken for removal, the Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
The study will be discussed at a Monday evening meeting at city hall. <BR>
<BR>
From May 1943 to January 1947, portions of what is now Belleair Beach, Belleair
Shore and more than 3 miles into the gulf were leased by the War Department
for use as air-to-ground and anti-aircraft gunnery ranges. <BR>
<BR>
A copy of the report can be read at the Largo Public Library, 351 East Bay
Drive. Written comments will be accepted through March 29 and should be
sent to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District, ATTN: Richard

<BLOCKQUOTE>FORT LAUDERDALE--(EnviroWorld)--The first stages of the Everglades
cleanup have begun, though it's mostly on paper, the Orlando Sentinel reported.
Scientists, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the South Florida Water Management
District have begun discussing the logistics of redesigning the massive
flood control system that has protected South Florida's humans, and nearly
killed the Everglades.<BR>
<BR>
One big problem can be easily understood in overview. Development has brought
thousands of people right up to dikes where, a few yards away, is nothing
but swamp. While many of those dikes must be removed to restore natural
water flow, engineers must figure out how to keep all the people dry.<BR>
<BR>
Another scientist put the ecosystem's problems in perspective for the Sentinel.
John Ogden, who is studying how to recreate more natural conditions in the
Everglades, said, &quot;Sometimes we say this is our version of Silent Spring.
We have this huge marsh but there's no life in it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Ogden said he focuses on two questions: &quot;Is this system really unique?
And if it is unique, what is it that really defines the Everglades as being
different from any other from any other wetlands system?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;If we can determine that, then we can focus our restoration on recapturing
those characteristics.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
That goal, which has been embraced by President Clinton and supported in
Congress, is expected to cost several billion dollars.</BLOCKQUOTE>

pay for water</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE --(EnviroWorld)-- Gainesville Regional Utilities
and E.T. and Vam York of Caret Corp., a development firm, are disputing
who should pay the $264,316 it will cost to install a water main and lift
station for a planned development, the Gainesville Sun reported. <BR>
<BR>
Caret Corp. plans to build 344 homes on 124 acres south of Haile Plantation.
The development will be called Mentone, and the first 44 homes have been
approved by county planners. In most cases, developers install water and
sewer lines and lift stations as needed, then deed them to GRU, which agrees
to maintain them in the future.<BR>
<BR>
The Yorks contend that a 17-year-old letter makes a committment by GRU to
install water and sewer for free. The March, 1979 letter was sent by a senior
utilities engineer to developer Howard Sharps, who then owned a portion
of the land Mentone will be built on. It suggests that the utility made
a committment to install the infrastructure for reduced fees. Sharps did
not go ahead will the development.<BR>
<BR>
The letter said that GRU &quot;can provide water service. Upon receipt of
an application and the payment of fees, construction of a water main extension
to serve the property will commence.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
GRU General Manager Mike Krutz said in a letter to Vim York that the current
GRU policy is in keeping with the letter from 1979, and Caret Corp. will
have to construct the facilities and pay the fees themselves.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Dioxin' cleanup race related</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>PENSACOLA --(EnviroWorld)-- Two toxic waste dumps in Pensacola
are being blamed for causing deaths and disease by a local activist,who
claims cleanup delays are race-related, the Associated Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
Federal government officials deny that racism was involved, and are now
considering a $23.1 million proposal to relocate as many as 453 families.
<BR>
<BR>
One site was once owned by the Escambia Wood Treating Co., where wood pilings
and utility poles were bathed in creosote and pentachlorophenol. At the
other site, Agrico manufactured fertilizer. <BR>
<BR>
The EPA spent $4 million on an emergency basis to excavate 250,000 cubic
yards of contaminated soil at the Escambia site in 1993 to stop ground water
contamination. But the soil remains at the site, piled up 60 feet high,
thus dubbed &quot;Mt. Dioxin&quot; by area residents. The mounds of dirt
will remain until the EPA comes up with a permanent solution.<BR>
<BR>
Taxpayers will probably pay for the Escambia cleanup, because the company
is out of business. The estimated cost of that site is from $35 million
to $154 million. The former owners of Agrico have begun a $10 million cleanup
of the fertilizer site.<BR>
<BR>
Margaret Williams, the president of Citizens Against Toxic Exposure, is
one of the residents leading the fight to get the area cleaned up. She says
that her parents and uncle have died from cancer, two babies have died and
another was born with six toes on each foot, which she attributes to the
effects of the toxins. She also contends that if a white neighborhood were
located between two Superfund toxic waste sites, cleanup would have already
happened.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE --(EnviroWorld)-- The Alachua County Environmental
Protection Department says it does not have enough workers to review Gainesville
development projects because of the increased preparation time each project
requires for public hearings, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
The department suggested the city could pay for those development reviews,
but the interim director of the city's Department of Community Development,
Linda Portal, rejected the idea because of a lack of funding to pay for
any additional services.<BR>
<BR>
County DEP officials said that they will no longer routinely review development
projects in the city, but will remain involved in on-going projects and
new projects that appear to be important to the environment.<BR>
<BR>
The city Public Works Department, which has engineers but no environmental
specialists on staff, is now reviewing development projects for environmental

for lakes and wetlands</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA --(EnviroWorld)-- Lt. Gov. Buddy McKay asked state officials
to devise new environmental standards to protect lakes and wetlands in Hillsborough,
Pinellas and Pasco counties by the end of the year, the Associated Press
reported. McKay, who has announced he will run for governor in 1998, also
suggested money be reallocated to expedite implementation of those new standards.<BR>
<BR>
The request came in a letter from McKay to Joe Davis, chairman of the Southwest
Florida Water Managing District's governing board. The agency regulates
all large water withdrawls for public supply in the Tampa Bay area.<BR>
<BR>
District scientists have concluded after years of study that pumping at
regional wellfields has dried thousands of acres of lakes and wetlands in
Pasco and Hillsborough counties. <BR>
<BR>
District officials said they have met with most of McKay's requests already.
Last year, they set new performance standards at four regional wetlands,
including three in Hillsborough and one in Pasco. The standards could cut
pumping by half in the next eight years.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the well sites are operated by West Coast Water Supply Authority.
The water supply authority disputes the scientific study results. They contend
that drought and development are as much to blame for dry conditions as
the pumping, and are challenging the standards implementation in court.</BLOCKQUOTE>

case</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO --(EnviroWorld)-- The Department of Environmental Protection
has appealed the decision of a circuit court judge in a case involving the
right of property owners to build along remnant wetlands, the Orlando Sentinel
reported.<BR>
<BR>
The case, which has been going on for seven years, involves the Vatalero
family's privately owned lake in east Orange County. The judge ruled that
the state had unfairly blocked Ron Valatero's mother from building on her
land in 1988. At the time, the state said its actions were necessary to
conserve important wetlands.<BR>
<BR>
The case highlights Florida's most important property right battle - the
right to develop versus regulations to protect the environment.<BR>
<BR>
The Florida Legal Foundation, a group of property-rights lawyers, has gotten
behind the Valateros' cause. DEP officials say they have to continue to
fight, or they could start a bad precedent: pay millions of dollars in tax
money to buy the lands in question or look the other way and risk hurting
the environment.</BLOCKQUOTE>

  <DD>GRADUATE RESEARCH ASSISTANTSHIPS IN PLANT - SOIL INTERACTIONS 
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>M.S. and Ph.D. assistantships in plant - soil interactions are available
  beginning July 1997 at Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ. The
  M.S. assistantship will investigate competition for available nitrogen
  among ponderosa pine, bunchgrass, and soil microorganisms using N-15 techniques.
  The effect of low-intensity ground fires on the competitive interactions
  among these functional groups will also be assessed. This study is part
  of a larger National Science Foundation-supported investigation of the
  ecological implications of restoring ponderosa pine/bunchgrass ecosystems
  to more natural (pre-EuroAmerican settlement) conditions in the Southwest.
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>The Ph.D. assistantship will utilize stable isotopes (D/H, O-18/O-16,
  C-13/C-12) to assess current and historical water-use by riparian trees
  in the West, and how human-induced changes in hydrology have altered water-uptake,
  water-use efficiency, and productivity of these endangered forest ecosystems.
  The successful applicant will collaborate with isotope chemists and dendrochronologists
  from University of Utah and University of Arizona on this project.

  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>Salary: GS-11, about $35,000 per year, plus benefits 
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>Description of Duties:
  <DD>Research will focus on two recently established exotic beetles in the
  United States: the pine shoot beetle, Tomicus piniperda, and the Asian
  longhorned beetle, Anoplophora glabripennis. The overall objective is to
  conduct studies that will support the development of sound management guidelines
  and quarantine regulations.
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>Tomicus piniperda was first found in the United States in 1992 and
  is now found in 8 states in the Great Lakes region (IL, IN, MI, OH, PA,
  NY, MD, WV). Movement of pine logs, nursery stock, and Christmas trees
  from all infested areas in the US is regulated under a federal quarantine.
  The principal objective of the Tomicus program is to conduct studies that
  address critical data gaps in the current quarantine. These studies deal
  with all aspects of the beetle's life cycle, including adult flight behavior,
  duration of the oviposition period, brood survival under different treatments,
  chemical ecology, natural enemies, and overwintering behavior. In other
  studies, we will evaluate (a) how various management treatments affect
  T. piniperda populations in Christmas tree plantations and in forest stands,
  and (b) how T. piniperda interacts with native bark beetle species. 
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>Anoplophora glabripennis was first discovered in New York City in August
  1996 at two sites on Long Island. This insect, which is also under quarantine,
  has been recorded from maple, aspen, willow, and horsechestnut in New York.
  An eradication effort will begin in 1997. Several studies will be initiated
  in 1997 in cooperation with various universities and state and federal
  agencies. These studies will address A. glabripennis seasonal development,
  within-tree distribution, tree species preferences, and various control
  methods. In addition, the possibility that firewood can serve as brood
  material will be evaluated.
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>Overnight traveling is required. Field work will occur year-round in
  a multi-state region.
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>Location and Staff:
  <DD>The USDA Forest Service, North Central Forest Experiment Station, Insect
  Unit is located on the Michigan State University campus. All Unit employees
  are given staff privileges at MSU. Our labs are in two campus buildings
  and our main office is in a third campus building. We have three permanent
  scientists in our Insect Unit: Robert Haack (Project Leader), Leah Bauer
  (Insect Pathologist), and William Mattson (Insect Ecologist). 
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>Requirements:
  <DD>Candidates must have a Ph.D. in entomology or a related field. The
  Ph.D. should have been earned within the past 5 years. Experience in forest
  entomology, especially with bark- or wood-infesting insects, is preferred,
  but not required. A valid driver s license is needed. The US Forest Service
  restricts hiring of post-doctoral scientists to US citizens. 
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>To Apply:
  <DD>If interested, send a copy of your resume to Dr. Robert A. Haack at
  the above address BY 15 FEBRUARY 1997. Include your full name, mailing
  address, day and evening phone, e-mail address, Social Security Number,

  <DD>SUBTIDAL MARINE ECOLOGY SUMMER INTERNSHIPS TO STUDY GREEN SEA URCHINS
  AND LOBSTERS ALONG THE MAINE COAST AT THE DARLING MARINE CENTER, UNIVERSITY
  OF MAINE 
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>We are seeking applicants to help conduct research on two projects.
  One studies the interactions between algae and sea urchins along the coast
  of Maine with particular emphasis on the effects of kelp on urchin settlement
  and survival. The other project is focused on predicting lobster stocks
  from settlement and life history data. Both projects have fishery management
  implications.
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>Research will be based primarily from the Darling Marine Center in
  the Pemaquid region of the Maine Coast. But trips up to a week in duration
  will be made to three other regions along the coast of Maine, including
  the scenic islands of the Mt. Desert region. 
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>We are looking for at least six interns, four of which need to be SCUBA
  certified. Diving is shallow (up to 60 feet) in cold (40-65oF) water. Applicants
  must have their own full wetsuits or drysuits. Small boat handling experience
  is a plus. All divers need to be certified divers, have current CPR and
  First Aid certification, and the proper dive physical. 
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>Field research will include underwater surveying, and deploying and
  retrieving experiments. Those interns not certified will conduct lab experments
  and analyze data. All interns will be involved in construction of experiments,
  sorting samples collected from the field, and some computer data analysis.
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>The duration of the internship is about 3 months. Most interns will
  start the first week of June, but there is a need for a few to start in
  late April or the beginning of July. Interns will live in the dorms at
  the Darling Marine Center, which is a busy place in the summer hosting
  interns, graduate students and researchers from around the nation and world.
  
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>Room charges and monthly stipend will be provided. In addition, interns
  will receive training in diving and boat handling. There will be weekly
  seminars and evening discussion sessions on scientific literature pertinent
  to our research.
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>We are seeking people who are enthusiastic about this kind of work,
  and may be considering research as an occupation. Exotic as this project
  may sound, please realize it requires long days of either physically demanding
  work in cold water, or long hours sorting samples in lab. Enthusiasm and
  excitement about marine research are just as (if not more) important than
  experience in determining a rewarding internship. This is a great opportunity
  for hands-on training in the field. Many past interns have used this experience
  to go on to graduate school or for employment as research technicians.
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>For more information and an application form please email us at: 
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>Barthel@maine.maine.edu
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>and we can send an application and information by email. Appllication
  deadline is MARCH 28, 1997. We will notify interns by mid-April.

  <DD>****ATTENTION WILDLAND FIREFIGHTERS WITH A STRONG INTEREST****
  <DD>*************** IN FIRE ECOLOGY AND PRESCRIBED BURNING!!!!!!!**********
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>Join one of four National Park Service (NPS) Prescribed Fire Support
  Modules (PFSM)! The Modules are located in Yellowstone Nat. Park, Zion
  Nat. Park, Bandolier NM, and Whiskeytown Nat. Rec. Area in Northern California,
  Ecotopia. I am the crew leader of the latter park, of course, and I am
  soliciting applicants for this operational, seasonal crew. Being of a more
  technical nature than ordinary firefighting, we look for a background of
  botany, ecology, biology, forestry, or natural resource management, in
  addition to the prerequisite firefighting background.
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>The crew travels extensively to a wide variety of parks, forests, and
  refuges throughout the West, but mostly in N. California to assist in prescribed
  fire activities. The crew labors hard to manually &amp; mechanically prepare
  burn units for ignition, as the NPS attempts to reintroduce fire into fire-dependant
  ecosystems and mitigate the danger of a large, catastrophic wildfire. We
  also engage in planning activities, such as fire behavior prediction, monitoring
  fuel moisture, and writing burn plans. Vegetation and fuels monitoring
  is conducted by crewmembers to measure fire effects and obtainment of burn
  objectives. Finally, the crew's most important mission is to support the
  management of Prescribed Natural Fires (PNF) in park &amp; forest wilderness
  areas, allowing Mother Nature (in the form of lightning ) take it's course.
  Crewmembers spend many days in the backcountry monitoring and manipulating
  these PNFs.

  <DD>NSF GRADUATE RESEARCH TRAINEESHIPS IN ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY: CONSERVATION
  OF BIODIVERSITY
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>BIOLOGY DEPARTMENT
  <DD>UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS BOSTON
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>The National Science Foundation has awarded Graduate Research Traineeships
  in Conservation of Biodiversity to the Department of Biology at the University
  of Massachusetts Boston as part of our Doctoral Program in Environmental
  Biology. We invite applications from individuals who are U.S. citizens
  or permanent residents with undergraduate or masters degrees in Biology,
  Environmental Sciences, Geography, Conservation and related areas. Individuals
  with disabilities, women and minorities are especially encouraged to apply.
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>The traineeship program is an integrative approach to population genetics,
  population dynamics and community ecology that is designed to create an
  awareness of scale and causal links between levels of organization, and
  to provide students with the theoretical and analytical skills to critically
  evaluate these phenomena. In addition to their dissertation research, students
  will take a required core curriculum in theoretical and applied ecology,
  statistics and environmental policy. As an important part of their training,
  students will do a rotation among the research labs of our faculty to acquire
  first-hand experience in measuring and analyzing biological diversity at
  levels of organization outside their dissertation topic. At the end of
  the program, we expect students to have a strong conceptual appreciation
  of the mechanisms responsible for the evolution and maintenance of biodiversity,
  and to have acquired the quantitative ability to assess and manage biodiversity
  from genes to ecosystems.
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD>There are nineteen participating ecologists, geneticists and environmental
  physiologists with funded research programs in spatiotemporal patterns
  of biodiversity in marine and terrestrial ecosystems, population dynamics,
  metapopulations and community structure, biogeochemical cycles, population
  genetics, breeding systems and fertility, germ plasm resources in wild,
  captive and domesticated species and systematics.

  <DD>Our research investigates rates and controls of nitrogenous gas production
  in the surface soils and groundwater of a riparian forest receiving nitrogen
  from adjacent cornfields. Gases emitted from surface soils in the field
  are captured with tent-like flow-through chambers. The gases are drawn
  from the chambers with a computer-controlled sampler and analyzed with
  a custom-engineered infra-red laser spectrophotometer. Gas production in
  groundwater is studied by using wells to introduce solutions below the
  water table and to sample groundwater for dissolved gases. Dissolved gases
  are analyzed by gas chromatography. In related laboratory studies, core
  samples are incubated under different conditions and released gases are
  measured by gas chromatography.
