<!--cci_guest_long_bio-->
As President of the Wind Dancer Production Group, Rick Leed 
is responsible for coordinating all the administrative, 
business and strategic planning activities which support the
creative output of the company. Leed is partnered with Wind
Dancer's three principals: Matt Williams, David McFadzean and
Carmen Finestra. Matt Williams is one of Hollywood's
highly touted "hyphenates" in that he creates, writes and
produces hit TV shows. Among Williams' credits are "The
Cosby Show" (writer), "Roseanne" (creator, writer and one-
time executive producer), and the new series "Buddies" which
begins airing on ABC this March.
<P>
Recently, Wind Dancer established a fully staffed feature
film division, Wind Dancer Films. The first film under that
banner is the forthcoming "Firelight", starring Sophie Marceau
from "Braveheart" and written and directed by William
Nicholson, screenwriter of "Shadowlands" and "Nell". 
Previously, Wind Dancer produced the 1991 film "Wild Hearts
Can't Be Broken" written by Wind Dancer's Matt Williams.
Wind Dancer also is involved in theatrical productions.
<P>
Previously, Leed was Senior Vice President of one of Hollywood's
leading talent agencies, Agency for the Performing Arts,
where he headed the New York Literary Department. There,
his clients included writers, directors and producers,
as well as a limited number of performers, all working in
film, television and theater. Among his clients were Matt
Williams and David McFadzean, celebrated British actors
Ian McKellen and Rowan Atkinson, playwright/screenwriter
Aaron Sorkin and the groups "Best Brains", who created
Comedy Central's Mystery Science Theatre 3000, and "Artificial
Intelligence", who created Tony and Tina's Wedding.
<P>
Leed has also worked for Columbia Pictures in distribution,
for Plitt Theatres in theatrical film exhibition, and
briefly as a freelance journalist for newspapers and magazines
in Chicago and New York. He graduated from Northwestern
University with dual degrees--a B.S. in radio, TV and film
from the School of Speech and a B.A. in psychology from the
College of Arts and Sciences.

Geoff Gilmore is Director of Programming for the annual
Sundance Film Festival which just ended in Park City, Utah. 
Considered the premiere venue for screening independent
films, the festival had a record attendance this year,
particularly by Hollywood's power elite which is always on
the lookout for new talent. Formerly known as the U.S. Film
Festival, the conclave underwent a name change in 1985 when
Robert Redford's Sundance Institute took it over.

<!--cci_guest_long_bio-->
As Director of Programming for the Sundance Film Festival,
Geoff Gilmore was in charge of viewing the more than 700
submissions received this year and whittling them down to
a few dozen official entries. The festival is one of the
most anticipated and well-attended events outside of
Hollywood because the annual conclave is now considered THE
place for first-time filmmakers to debut their work and
attract the attention of the media, the agents, the studios
and, most importantly of all, the distributors.
<P>
Once an obscure, marginal event called the U.S. Film Festival,
the gathering has gained both visibility and clout ever since
Robert Redford's Sundance Institute took over its management
in 1985. Presently, the Sundance Film Festival is a glitzy
Hollywood schmooze-fest known as much for its great parties
as for its great films. Every year, top media outlets send
several reporters to cover the movies and related events,
while screenings are often standing-room-only affairs.
<P>
The festival's huge success has coincided, and some say even
helped launch, the current renaissance of independent cinema
in America. Among the important works which have made their
debut at the Sundance Film Festival are Steven Soderbergh's
"sex, lies and videotape," the Coen brothers' "Blood Simple,"
Wim Wenders' "Paris, Texas," Jim Jarmusch's "Stranger than
Paradise," Whit Stillman's "Metropolitan," and Ed Burns'
"The Brothers McMullen."

<!--cci_guest_long_bio-->
Mike Fenton graduated from UCLA in 1956 with a bachelor's
degree in cinema. He left USC Law School to work as an agent
trainee for MCA, then Hollywood's most powerful talent agency.
From 1956 to 1963, he functioned as an agent. After much prodding,
Paramount Pictures eventually convinced him to become a casting
director. He never looked back.
<P>
In 1965, he joined T&L Productions as head of casting for
numerous television shows, including the "I Spy" TV series.
In 1968, he went to work for Qualis Productions as vice
president of talent and business affairs. By 1971, he was
more than ready to go out on his own, so he teamed up with
Fred Roos to start Roos/Fenton Casting. 
<P>
Two years later, Mr. Roos left to become Francis Ford Coppola's
producing partner, so Fenton brought in Jane Feinberg and
formed Fenton-Feinberg Casting. In 1987, when Ms. Feinberg
retired, the company became Mike Fenton and Associates. 
Presently, Mr. Fenton is president of the Casting Society of
America and works with the top names in the Industry.
<P>
Fenton and his company have been responsible for some of
the most imaginative and original casting of Hollywood's
best-known movies, including "Godfather II", "Marathon Man",
"Young Frankenstein", "Chinatown", "E.T.", "One Flew Over the 
Cuckoo's Nest", "Norma Rae", "Breaking Away", "Poltergeist",
"Raiders of the Lost Ark I, II and III", "Back to the Future
I, II and III", "Honeymoon in Vegas", "Chaplin", and "Congo".
<P>
He also has cast many TV Movies of the Week and miniseries
including "Elvis and Me", "Poor Little Rich Girl", "The
Billionaire Boys Club" and "East of Eden".

Bernard Weinraub has long been one of America's most respected
journalists. After growing up in the Bronx and graduating
from City College in New York, he began his newspaper career
as a copy boy at The New York Times. Soon, he was made a full
reporter and assigned to the Metropolitan Desk where he
covered local news.
<P>
In 1968, Mr. Weinraub was sent to the Times' Saigon Bureau
where he joined a platoon of U.S. journalists covering the
Vietnam War. In the 1970s, he was made the paper's London
Correspondent and then named New Delhi Correspondent.
<P>
Like many foreign correspondents, Mr. Weinraub eventually
moved back to the States and began reporting from the Times'
Washington Bureau. He covered both the 1984 and 1988 American
presidential elections, following first the Walter Mondale
and then the George Bush campaigns. He also was White House
Correspondent in the late 1980s, assigned to both the Reagan
and the Bush administrations, before becoming the Washington
Bureau's Deputy News Editor. 
<P>
Eventually, Mr. Weinraub, eager for a new reporting challenge,
moved to Los Angeles and became the Times' Hollywood writer
in 1991. His incisive and witty coverage of the Industry's
key players and their game moves on and off the screen is
considered by many to be the best in the business.

Producer Brian Grazer is partnered with director Ron Howard
in Imagine Entertainment, which produced this year's
critically acclaimed box office success "Apollo 13" starring
Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Kevin Bacon and Ed
Harris. Directed by Howard, the film has grossed over $170
million to date.
<P>
Mr. Grazer began his career as a producer developing
television projects with Edgar J. Sherick and Daniel Blatt.
During his two-year tenure, he produced the TV movies "Zuma
Beach" and "Thou Shall Not Kill" for NBC. In 1980, Mr.
Grazer signed a development deal with Paramount Pictures
that let him segue into motion pictures. It was at
Paramount, where he was executive-producing several
television pilots, that Mr. Grazer met Mr. Howard, who was
just completing his seven-year run on the hit series "Happy
Days."
<P>
Mr. Grazer hired Mr. Howard to direct "Night Shift" starring
Michael Keaton and Henry Winkler and "Splash" starring Tom
Hanks, John Candy and Darryl Hannah. The latter garnered Mr.
Grazer an Academy Award nomination for Best Screenplay. Mr.
Grazer and Mr. Howard officially joined forces in 1986 as co-
chairmen and co-founders of Imagine Films Entertainment, a
public company which they eventually took private in 1993 as
Imagine Entertainment. One of the company's biggest
successes was "Parenthood," directed by Howard and starring
Steve Martin, which in 1989 was the Number One attraction in
its first two weeks of release and went on to gross over
$100 million.
<P>
Mr. Grazer also produced "The 'burbs," "My Girl," "The
Paper," "Kindergarten Cop," "Real Genius," "Clean and
Sober," "Spies Like Us," "Cry Baby," "The Doors," "Far and
Away, "Housesitter, "Boomerang," and the Oscar-nominated
"Backdraft" directed by Mr. Howard. Some of the stars who
have worked with Mr. Grazer include Arnold Schwarzenegger,
Glenn Close, Robert Duvall, Macauley Culkin, Goldie Hawn,
Kurt Russell, Johnnie Depp, Val Kilmer, Chevy Chase and Dan
Ackroyd. In 1992, Mr. Grazer was honored by NATO/ShoWest as
Producer of the Year.
<P>
Mr. Grazer's upcoming projects include producing "The Nutty
Professor," starring Eddie Murphy, "Sgt. Bilko" starring
Steve Martin and directed by Jonathan Lynn, "Ransom"
starring Mel Gibson and directed by Ron Howard, "The
Chamber" starring Gene Hackman and Chris O'Donnell, and
"Liar Liar" starring Jim Carrey.

<H1><CENTER> YOUR HOST....... GARY CALAMAR</CENTER></H1>

A pair of travellers gaze throught the curved windshield of a '62 Rambler on the blue moonlit interstate that stretches towards the horzion. The highway is alive tonight. Two fingers twist a Delco radio dial leftways, finely tuning to  a signal curious and strong. The sky fades to black as Hank Williams segues into Sonic Youth.<P>

This is driving music, or stay at home sounds for vicarious vagabonds. You got the car, we got the gas....  <I>This is THE OPEN ROAD</I> <P>

The Open Road takes the listener on an evocative twilight ride. The show encompasses rear-view reflections on the roots of Rock, Country, Jazz, Blues, and Soul, while looking ahead to the most compelling new releases emerging just around the bend. I like to incorporate pop music's rich history, to show the routes that bridge Robert Johnson to Bob Dylan to P.J. Harvey. From Elvis to Elvis. <P>

Ironically I started thinking about the Open Road during a cross-country drive.  Much of the radio out there tends to be pretty safe and one-dimensional. I wanted to put a show together that was more daring and fun - not afraid to take a left turn down an alternate beat.  I'm thrilled that KCRW is giving me the opportunity to draw up the map.  Yeah!
<P>

<I>Hop in for a ride on The Open Road with Gary Calamar, Saturdays and Sundays 8-10 PM.</I>

As a playwright, Jon Robin Baitz provided, in The Substance of 			Fire, a searing portrait of an aging, widowered New York publisher 			imprisoned by his past--and of his three grown but emotionally 			vapid children who struggle for control of his company and his 			sanity.  The play, which ran in New York and at the Mark Taper 			Forum, consisted of almost two related one-acts.  The first was set 			in the board room of the publishing house and focussed on the 			father's self-destructive obsession with publishing an unprofitably 			high-quality and arcane set of books on genetic experimentation 			during the Holocaust.  His offspring reveal their own baggage and 			largely passive life choices in the course of wresting the firm from 			him.  The second act, or second playlet, depicts the broken and 			sick old man in his Gramercy Park apartment, parrying with his 			social worker and improbable caretaker son--and sifting through 			the shards of his driving force: as a boy, he was the only member 			of his family to survive the Nazis, but not in a prison camp with its	 		badge of honor, rather in a book-lined room.  This was powerful, 			and meaningful stuff on stage, and Baitz was brave and fortunate, 			as a co-producer, to be able to bring The Substance of Fire to the 			screen.<p>
		However, as the screenwriter adapting his own play, Baitz "opens 			up," back-storys and literalizes his piece almost out of existence.  			Characters who are only talked about or imagined on stage have 			become intrusively real, as have many of the New York locations.  			The paucity of soul among the sibling and filial relationships is 			fragmented by all that determined movement, as much the decision 		of director Daniel Sullivan, who is also from the theatre, as of Baitz.  		Must we really see Tim Hutton, as the dropout, ill and upstate son, 			riding the train into the city to know he makes the painful journey?  			Or is it really necessary to watch the old publisher and his even 			older author try to sell their boxed set to the young buyer at 				Rizzoli's to know that the project is doomed never to find an 				audience or make back its money?<p>  
		Apart from Hutton, the three major cast members come from the 			original New York stage production: Ron Rifkin as the father; Tony 			Goldwyn as the other son, who dutifully joined the publishing firm; 			and Sarah Jessica Parker as the daughter who hosts an inane but 			successful TV show for kids, but who, like her brothers, will never 			have children of her own.  All three actors bring, from their stage 			time, understanding, commitment and flashes of insight into their 			tortured characters.  But they are equally hampered by the new 			structure and content of The Substance of Fire--added to which, 			in closeup Rifkin seems a bit too young for the part he is playing, a 			problem he never had on stage.  Only in the denouement, as the 			three survivors are sitting on a bench in Gramercy Park itself, 			reflecting on all that has happened, do they achieve the dramatic 			symbiosis that ran throughout the stage version. 
		Otherwise, alas, the movie provides far less substance than the 			play, and almost no fire. <p>
Rifkin also makes a brief appearance in the confusing and unecessary prologue to I'm Not Rappaport, another hit play now out in a movie version.  Herb Gardner adapted, and directed, this film version of his play, starring Walter Matthau and Ossie Davis as two eightyish men who meet on a Central Park bench almost daily to discuss their lives and lies.  Gardner has also "opened up" his screenplay to use (beautifully) a great deal of the park.  This new cinematic sweep, as in The Substance of Fire, dissipates the central relationship and robs I'm Not Rappoport of much of its warmth and humor.

When I was a kid watching the Ed Sullivan show on TV, frequently in amongst Elvis Presley, the Beatles and the live renditions of songs from Broadway shows (the stuff that really interested me), an eightyish woman would appear, talk-singing something about being "the last of the red hot mamas."  This seemed to go down all right with my grandparents and other people who remembered Sophie Tucker in her heyday, but for us teens on the cusp of at least two kinds of rock and roll and a sexual revolution, this white-haired old fat woman trying to be seductive and bawdy seemed pathetic, like an unfunny sketch.  Had I known then what I know now about Sophie Tucker, I might have paid more attention, and been a bit more sympathetic.  Thanks to Sharon McNight's remarkable cabaret act at the Hollywood Roosevelt Cinegrill through January 26, we can all catch up with Tucker's long and unique show business career.  McKnight performs "The Sophie Tucker Songbook" entirely in wise-cracking character (beyond zaftig and in a marcelled platinum blonde hairdo that the ghost of Jean Harlow might envy).  Without a writer or director, other than herself, McNight takes us on a fascinating journey of the sixty years of popular entertainment when the ever-touring and ever-recording Tucker was one of its icons.  Having sung as a kid for the patrons of her parents' Hartford, Connecticut restaurant, Sophie began her professional career in 1906.   She was a Ziegfeld girl by 1909 and started making recordings--for Thomas Edison, the inventor of the gramophone--in 1910.  Edison himself supervised Tucker's wax-cynlinder recording of "Some of These Days," by Shelton Brooks, the first black Tin Pan Alley composer, in 1911.  It remained her theme song until her death in 1966 (and was the number she usually did on the Sullivan show).  The cylinder itself is in the Gammy Hall of Fame.  She played the Palace in 1914.  Tucker, who was Jewish and had been born in Eastern Europe, had her first million-seller in 1928 with "My Yiddeshe Mama."  She made her talking picture debut  the same year, and played Judy Garland's mother in "Broadway Melody of 1938."  But Tucker's brassy, belting voice and her syncopated delivery (even on ballads!) were always more heart-pounding in person--a fact which McKnight demonstrates brilliantly by never veering from the carefully calculated Sophie persona.  Tucker's biggest Broadway hit was Cole Porter's "Leave It to Me," in which she introduced "Most Gentlemen Don't Like Love."  But she also made famous such standards as "After You've Gone," "It All Depends on You," "I'm Living Alone and I Like It" and "There'll Be Some Changes Made."  Her raunchier, risque-for-their-day numbers (she was even arrested in Portland, Oregon) are more footnotes to relics of social history, but no less fascinating for that.  "The Sophie Tucker Songbook" is the right name for McKnight's re-creation of the legendary entertainer's body of work.  Performing nineteen numbers in their entirety, in just about and hour and fifteen minutes, McKnight gives us the broad strokes of Tucker's biography, including her three failed marriages and, by inference, a life that was able to glow only in performance.   As a full-blown theatre piece it might need some more sweeping historical context, but as a cabaret act it's riveting.  It also works as a compact disc, which is on sale in the lobby after the show.  (Tucker herself was the first performer to sell her products, such as her autobiography, after a performance, even collecting the money herself, in a cigar box--a fact that isn't in McKnight's patter.)  The musical director of both the act and the CD, James Followell, ably doubles onstage as Tucker's piano accompanist for 45 years, Ted Shapiro.

Thoughts on Theatre is hosted by Robert Windler.

<BR>
<BR>
<B>January 9, 1997</B>
<BR><BR>
My problem with something like "Andrew Lloyd Webber--Music of the Night," which has touched down at the Pantages on its national tour, is that it is neither musical show, nor concert--nor is it a nightclub act.  It combines elements of all three forms, of course.  A headliner, now Betty Buckley (in past versions, Sarah Brightman or Michael Crawford) provides some star power--although she isn't on stage enough to make this a Buckley concert or cabaret evening.  And mini-suites of such Lloyd Webber shows as "Evita," "Cats," "The Phantom of the Opera" and "Sunset Boulevard" give some sense of theatre time remembered.  (You're dead in the water if you haven't seen most or all of Lloyd Webber's output beforehand--few of his numbers hold up out of context, and the running order makes no sense at all, except perhaps for technical reasons.)  The onstage orchestra and Tony Walton's neutral starry-night set, give some of the concert feeling, especially during the instrumental overtures.  But Buckley in particular seems to miss the intimacy of, say, the Cinegrill.  At times she's quite content belting to the balcony, but at others--to her credit--she seems to want to be reaching for a more intimate focus group.  Fat chance, in this overblown, overmiked production featuring a few overworked hits and a lot of recititive filler.  In that sense, "Andrew Lloyd Webber--Music of the Night" is like one of the composer's musicals.  The supporting cast is comfortable with the mass-audience concept, and seems ready to sing to all out doors.  Kevin R. Wright and John Herrera are especially effective with two songs from "Aspects of Love," with lyrics by Don Black and Charles Hart.  Wright dazzles with the lesser known "Anything But Lonely" while Herrera achieves one of the show's few truly moving moments with "Love Changes Everything."  Tonya Dixon makes the most of Black's and Richard Maltby Jr.'s "Unexpected Song" from "Song and Dance."  Until Buckley shows up and sings "I Don't Know How to Love Him" from "Jesus Christ Superstar" while Herrera and Dixon are also singing "Love Changes Everything" and "Unexpected Song."  This bizarre tripartite first-act finale can stand as a metaphor for the whole show: a lot of noise and notes ultimately signifying nothing.  Lloyd Webber isn't exactly Richard Rodgers, after all.  Alas.<BR><BR>
Musical recycling of another sort has returned to the Canon Theatre in Beverly Hills in the form of "Forever Plaid."  It was a hit in the same venue five years ago, and has never really gone off tour since.  Two of the four members of the pre-rock pop quartet are even the same as they were in 1992.  Director Stuart Ross's libretto about the four friends who died in a car crash en route to their first big engagement and come back from the dead to do the concert seems even sillier the second time around.  But the good news is that the 1950s songs, as arranged by the late James Raitt, seem even better the second time around.  Paul Castree, David Engel, Neil Nash and Larry Raben are all solid solo singers who blend just beautifully.  "Forever Plaid," with its singular dedication to period anti-rock, provides that solid throughline that "Music of the Night" lacks.  And musically, at least, "Forever Plaid" is a solid evening of entertainment.
Burton Lane, who died this week at age 84, was the last of his generation of great Broadway composers.  Lane should be best remembered for his score for "Finian's Rainbow," with lyrics by E.Y. Harburg on such songs as "Old Devil Moon," "If This Isn't Love" and "How Are Things in Glocca?"  Lane also had a major success, writing, with Alan Jay Lerner, "On A Clear Day You Can See Forever."  Lane's last Broadway score was for the underrated "Carmelina," also written with Lerner.  That show's "One More Walk Around the Garden," on the recently released Julie Andrews album of Lerner lyrics, is a fitting valedictory to Lane.

It's time for my ten best list, a highly subjective selection of what I enjoyed most in Southern California theatre in 1996.  As usual, I didn't even see half of everything, and what I did go to I hoped I'd like in advance; I never set out to have a bad time, which doesn't mean I didn't have many.  Here then in no order at all, are the ten local shows I'll remember best from this past year.<BR><BR>
1. "City of Angels," at the Colony Studio Theatre, which proved that a big Broadway musical could be reinvented for a small stage and a small venue.  Larry Gelbart's libretto, Cy Coleman's score and David Zippel's lyrics were just as effective here as they had been in the 1990 Broadway original.  Robert Stoeckle as the writer Stone was the standout in a mostly effective cast.<BR><BR>
2.  "And God Said, 'Ha,'" co-written and played by Julia Sweeney at the Coronet Theatre, promoted the concept of performance art by a quantum leap.  In this carefully scripted but seemingly spontaneous one-woman show, Sweeney proved that you can tell your sad story, hand your audience a lot of laughs and not leave them thinking they had paid to be your shrink. <BR><BR>
3. Sue Raney, at the Hollywood Roosevelt Cinegrill, was in great voice and handled lyrics with equal aplomb.  Her set, with both overly familiar movie music and some obscure gems was atonishingly original in its intepretation.  With Dick Shreve on the piano and Dave Carpenter on bass, Raney and her unique but unfussy style managed to remain timeless and reassuring.<BR><BR>
4.  Eddie Frierson's one-man show, "Matty," at the Two Roads Theatre, restored my faith in individual passion for a subject.  Even if you thought you didn't want to know anything about Christy Mathewson, the legendary pitcher from the early part of this century, Frierson made you care almost as much as he did.  Frierson evoked an entire era in this heart-felt stage biography.<BR><BR>  
5. Donizetti's "The Elixer of Love" at the Los Angeles Music Center Opera, was lovely, limid and accessible, as 1832 operas go.  British soprano Alison Hagley was merely exquisite as Adina, and Mexican tenor Ramon Vargas soared as Nemorino.<BR><BR>
6.  The Pointer Sisters in "Ain't Misbehavin'," at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, proved the 1978 Fats Waller musical that started a whole genre of one-composer or team-shows is still best of breed.  Anita Pointer in particular took the stage with an infectious love of the material.<BR><BR>
7. "Dinah Was" also enshrined a musical legend, Dinah Washington, but as a living subject not a museum piece.  Yvette Freeman as Dinah, and author Oliver Goldstick transcended their genre by fulfilling their obligation to context, with the help of a superb supporting cast.  What a difference a play makes.<BR><BR>
8. The Royal Nationa Theatre production of "Carousel," at the Ahmanson Theatre, proved anew that this 1945 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical was a show for all seasons.  The distance five decades and director Nicholas Hytner's reassessment of the piece showed us what a treasure this show really is.<BR><BR>
9. The touring company of Frank Loesser's "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying," at the Pantages Theatre and Orange County Performing Arts Center was a delightful musical that was so-time specific it was timeless, thanks to Ralph Macchio and Shauna Hicks in the leads, director Des McAnuff and choreographer Wayne Cilento.<BR><BR>
10. "Sordid Lives," by Del Shores, at Theatre/Theater featured oddly wonderful characters and performances that made this more than just another "coming out" play.  In spite of exaggeration for emphasis bordering on farce, this story of a Texas family and their wayward son was often as truthful as it was hilarious.<BR><BR>

It's time for those last-minute Christmas gifts for your musical- loving friends.  This season, an even greater variety of compact discs than usual is available on several labels.  My favorite, hands down, is "Leonard Bernstein's New York" on Nonesuch.  This collection of nineteen numbers is mostly from the big three  Manhattan-based Bernstein shows: "On the Town," "Wonderful Town" and "West Side Story," which ran on Broadway between 1944 and 1957.  Newly recorded by such artists as Audra MacDonald, Dawn Upshaw, Donna Murphy and Mandy Pantinkin, accompanied by the orchestra of St. Luke's and produced by Tommy Krasker, "Leonard Bernstein's New York" is a glowing tribute to a great composer in a golden age and place.  Highlights are Upshaw's "Somewhere" and "Lonely Town," MacDonald's "A Little Bit In Love," and  "Murphy's "Ain't Got No Tears Left," which was cut from "On the Town." 
As much sense as it makes to do a recording devoted to one composer or lyricist, that's how little sense it makes to devote a two CD-set to the musicals of one director, even if it is Hal Prince.  First Night Records has just released "A Gala Concert for Hal Prince, 28 tracks from shows he has directed, sung by a variety of artists in one night in Munich.  But unless you think Len Cariou makes the ideal Tevye in "Fiddler on the Roof"--singing both "Tradition" and "Sunrise, Sunset," yet--and you like "live" recordings of show tunes, with applause and other extraneous noise, skip this one.  Prince's genius is visual, not aural, after all. <BR><BR>
The Broadway Angel recording of the 1996 Nathan Lane "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" is a must for anyone who remembers the golden age of musical comedy or merely wants to re-create it by seeing and collecting lovingly "modern" revivals.  This disc demonstrates all the delights of Stephen Sondheim's music and lyrics, so underrated 34 years ago, even by Sondheim himself.  The revival cast is equally rambunctious, and recording techniques are vastly superior.
Anyone who is particularly partial to baritone arias in Broadway shows must have Thomas Hampson's "Leading Man."   This collection of eleven songs going back to Jerome Kern's 1939 "All the Things You Are," and produced by Thomas Z. Shepard finds Hampson better casting for a musical comedy album than most opera singers.  He does especially well on the title song from "Gigi," "Hey There," from "The Pajama Game" (in a duet with the song's introducer John Raitt) and "If Ever I Would Leave You" from "Camelot."  In contrast, Hampson shows up the weaknesses in songs from "Phantom," "Les Miz," "Secret Garden" and "Beauty and the Beast."<BR><BR>
The temptation to sneak in a song from a modern British musical, "On My Own," from "Les Miz" also mars the otherwise charming new album by Twiggy on the Varese Sarabande label.  "London Pride" subtitled "Songs from the London Stage" is at its best when Twiggy sings Noel Coward (the title song and "If Love Were All"), Cole Porter ("The Physician"), Sandy Wilson's "A Room In Bloomsbury" from "The Boy Friend" or "The Lambeth Walk" from "Me and My Girl."  A better singer than Gertrude Lawrence, if not as good as Julie Andrews, Twiggy should be doing more musicals on stage.  In the meantime these fifteen songs will have to do.<BR><BR>
If your giftee is a "Peter Pan" freak or just a Peter Pan type, you may want to gift him or her with the 21-selection CD, also from Varese Sarabande, that combines the Peter Pan musicals of Moose Charlap and Carolyn Leigh, Leonard Bernstein, Jule Styne, Comden & Green, Anthony Newley & Leslie Bricusse and others into one giant wallow--more eclectic than cohesive, more gimmick than synergy, at least for those us whose favorite musical is not Peter Pan.<BR><BR>

Valour! Compassion!," Terrence McNally's Tony-winning play which opened last night at the Geffen Playhouse, is a work I wish I hadn't been seeing for the second time, so soon after the first.  But I did see it on Broadway, with the original cast, less than two years ago.  So if you haven't seen "Love! Valour! Compassion!" before, by all means book tickets for some day before January 26.  It's an important play, by a distinguished American playwright.  It's being given a topflight staging by the original director, Joe Mantello, in a warm and accessible space in Westwood.  And even though it focusses on youngish to early middleaged gay American men in the age of AIDS, "Love! Valour! Compassion!" has a lot to say about the human condition generally.  Now, you would-be first-timers don't have to keep listening to me, nad maybe you shouldn't.  But if you have seen the play before, and are tempted to take it in again, you might want to pay attention.  Some plays, mostly classics, Shakespeare in particular, are dense in dialogue, packed with ambiguities and layers of possible meaning; these plays may benefit from repeated visits at any intervals.  But McNally's play is straight-forward in structure, intent and speech.  As lovely as they all are, you tend to absorb them pretty completely the first time around.  This isn't to say that "Love! Valour! Compassion!" won't become a classic; in future generations it could well stand for our time and place.  But with its plotline and punchlines so potent upon first hearing and seeing, there is no reason to take it in again, anytime soon.  Rather, you might find yourself, as I did, noticing all the wrong things and making odious comparisons.  Start with the title: like "My Fair Lady" it doesn't come from any dialogue in the play.  "Love! Valour! Compassion!' (each with its own exclamation point, by the way) was always a bad title; now it seems worse, as if it's needed to telegraph content and emotions that aren't being conveyed in the acting and dialogue.  Except that, the first time they were.  The present, committed, ensemble cast of seven (one of them playing two roles) includes four members who did do the play on Broadway.  (I just didn't happen to see any of them.)  Two cast members, Mitchell Anderson as the blind Bobby, and Randy Becker as young Puerto Rican dancer Ramon, are even superior to their predecessors.  But as a whole, this cast did not move me as much as "my" first one.  I did not care about their characters until the very end last night, and that's too late.  These eight people must seem real from the git-go, especially if they are to transcend the confines of their time and place.  One performance in particular is notably less convincing, while still very funny: Mario Cantone as Buzz, the musical comedy queen, by now perhaps an overworked character anyway.  Cantone plays Buzz with a hard edge of defensive obnoxiousness, as if to say that no one could have ever loved him, sick or well.  I thought Emory had wandered in from Mart Crowley's "The Boys in the Band."  In Nathan Lane's original, rounder, more likeable portrayal we got the feeling that Buzz could have been loved, and would be again, if only he weren't sick and dying.  Big difference.  "Love! Valour! Compassion!" is set on three summer holiday weekends in a large old house by a lake in the country two hours north of New York City.  The same group, friends, lovers and roomates for as long as fourteen years, gather over Memorial Day, the Fourth of July and Labor Day weekends.  Two of the men are dying--and they all are.  This longish play (three full acts, requiring a 7:30 curtain midweek) owes a lot to Crowley and "The Boys in the Band" as McNally is the first to admit.  On second viewing it owes as much to "Same Time, Next Year," and that is not such a good thing.  This is Robert Windeler, with Thoughts on Theatre.<BR><P>  </BLOCKQUOTE><BR><A HREF="thoughts.html"> Back</A><BR><PRE></PRE><CENTER> <A HREF="../m.html"><IMG ALIGN=top SRC="../images/kcrwww.gif"WIDTH=144 HEIGHT=48 BORDER=0></A> </CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Since the legendary Cline died in 1963, at the age of thirty, this has never been much of a boast or threat--just a desert-island-disc kind of preferential statement.  Besides, Cline's recording legacy is prodigious for someone who only had a five-year career.  But none of this stops people from trying to recreate the Cline magic live, on stage.  Nor does it stop us hard-core obsessives from hoping that they get it right this time.  Well, my opera-going is not in jeopardy, thanks to Always...Patsy Cline, which played the Alex Theatre in Glendale over the weekend, plays tonight at the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza, and Saturday night at the Pepperdine Center for the Arts.  Ted Swindley, who wrote and directed Always...Patsy Cline, has got it only about half right.  The extremely good news is his leading lady, Alice Spencer, a remarkable mimic and singer who looks and sounds a lot like the real Patsy.  Her interaction with the audience and her first-rate country backup band is magical; she even at times seems to capture some of Patsy's soul.  Unfortunately, Spencer as Cline is almost never alone on the stage with her muse and her music.  The other half of Always...Patsy is a real pain in the butt.  Quite literally.  Squirm time.  The glue that purports to hold this two-act piece together is the real-life story of a fan who met Cline just as she was making it big.  This woman, Louise, is the sort of groupie who gives reflected glory a bad name.  She helped Cline, backstage, get through an early gig in 1957 and cooked scrambled eggs for her after the show.  Patsy wrote her a few letters over the next six years.  End of story--if only.  But Louise, in her own tedious words as lovingly recounted by Swindley, has become an undeserving co-star of Always...Patsy Cline.  Louise's irritating presence is made worse by the numbingly literal performance of Candyce Hinkle.  She's an actress who feels compelled, if saying "I called him at five in the morning" to point to herself, talk into an imaginary telephone, point to an unseen him, and hold up five fingers.  Please.  And Swindley lets her do it--or encourages her, which would be even worse.   If you can endure this grating, gratuitous travesty, and are a serious Patsy Cline fan, go see Alice Spencer.  She and Patsy deserve their own show.<P>Those of us who have been waiting eagerly for the twin delights of the next Jerry Herman musical and Angela Lansbury's return to musical comedy don't have to travel to Broadway or even downtown.  CBS is offering up Mrs. Santa Claus this Sunday night at eight.  This two-hour show, written by Mark Saltzman, is set in the colorful melting pot of Lower East Side New York in 1910.  The era is replete with suffragettes and labor-union protests against the use of children in factories, just enough social commentary to keep adults paying attention while the children wallow in the upbeat yuletide sentiments and the tuneful Herman score.  Yes, the setting and the songs are derivative of Hello, Dolly! but this isn't such a bad thing, especially at Christmas time.  Lansbury is a delight as a twinkly, white-haired Dolly-esque Mrs. Santa Claus, who manages to keep fairly busy year-round helping to supervise the making of all those toys, but who is tired of spending Christmas Eve alone.  She has much more fun re-arranging lives on the Lower East Side.  Charles Durning is perfectly cast as Santa himself, and Michael Jeter makes an off-beat chief elf.  The supporting cast is all well chosen, and Bob Mackie has great fun with the Edwardian-era winter costumes.  Rob Marshall's choreography is sprightly and Terry Hughes has directed with a sense of fun.<BR><P>  </BLOCKQUOTE><BR><A NAME="PastShows"></A><A HREF="thoughts.html">Back</A><BR><PRE></PRE><CENTER> <A HREF="../m.html"><IMG ALIGN=top SRC="../images/kcrwww.gif"WIDTH=144 HEIGHT=48 BORDER=0></A> </CENTER></BODY></HTML>

	Thanksgiving night may seem a little early for turkey hash.  Forgive me.  But I've got so many undigested morsels to chew over and get off my plate before the rush of openings between now and Christmas.  This has already been a busy season in so many ways, notably in the greatest flood of cinematically reinvented Shakespeare plays since the tumultuous late 1960s and early 70s.  There's also been a glut of non-Shakespearean plays transferred to film, from Arthur Miller's classic "The Crucible" to the contemporary "Marvin's Room" by Scott McPherson.  First, a couple of stage productions that have nothing to do with either of those categories, and seem unlikely to be filmed anytime soon.  "Agency" may have closed at the Coast Theatre while I was trying to think of something nice to say about it.  (It also took me a lot time to get to it; because it had a familiar sounding title, I thought I'd seen it before.)  But in retrospect "Agency," which had two authors, Christie Dowda and Andy Ellis, is most memorable for its set: Robert L. Smith's afterwork bar from the point of view of the bartender.  Otherwise this unevenly acted play about downsizing in an advertising agency was so intent on instructing us in the business it portrayed and the current ethical climate that it forgot to offer us even one well-rounded sympathetic human being in the barful.  The play did not, alas, forget to telegraph its twist ending.
<BR>
<P>"A Quarrel of Sparrows," James Duff's self-described comedy, closes at the Court Theatre this weekend.  Again, I'm afraid that I found the acting uneven--only Ronnie Claire Edwards created a memorable character from the inside out.  Duff is so intent on his absurdist allegory, about a New York writer whom God tells not to sign a Hollywood contract, that director Mary Lou Belli and the rest of the cast are left to their own devices, which are not always the same devices.  The play's title is apt: sparrows don't sing, they just chatter unpleasantly, sometimes all at once.
I haven't seen Kenneth Branagh's screen "Hamlet" yet, but I did see his fresh interpretation on the London stage about six years ago, enough to look forward to this overworked material yet again.
<BR>
<P>"Romeo and Juliet," "Richard III" and "Twelfth Night" certainly haven't been overlooked across the centuries, arguably being the most produced Shakespeare tragedy, history and comedy plays, respectively.  But that's because they keep offering the opportunity for a different point of view.  I found Baz Luhrman's "Romeo and Juliet" jarring, not because it was transposed to a modern setting--but because it was the wrong modern setting: Verona Beach, indeed.  Also, the pros in the cast, such as Pete Postlethwaite, Brian Dennehy and Miriam Margoyles are so obviously more comfortable with Shakespeare's poetical dialogue, trimmed as it is.  Leonardo di Caprio is far too "cool" and callow to be the hot-blooded Romeo, and Clare Danes is only slightly more winsome as Juliet.  Far more successful is Trevor Nunn's really rethought and embellished "Twelfth Night," now set in the 1890s and a lot less frothy than most played-for-laughs productions.  This satisfying moody "Twelfth Night" works wonderfully thanks to Imogen Stubbs as Viola, and her lookalike twin brother indeed, Stephen Mackintosh.  Helena Bonham Carter, as Olivia, has never been better, and Nigel Hawthorne's heartbreaking but still hilarious Malvolio is the stuff of supporting actor Oscars.  I'm just sorry I saw the movie right before A Noise Within's perfectly competent and traditional "Twelfth Night," which runs through this weekend. Al Pacino, alas, comes up more self-indulgent than insightful in his "Looking for Richard," but the recently rediscovered and restored 1912 "Richard III" of Frederick Warde is a fascinating piece of social and cinematic history.  "The Crucible" does not offer many cinematic reasons for being, and will not satisfy those who know the play well.  Also its parallels to modern witch-hunting are less compelling on the screen, even with Paul Scofield in charge.  "Marvin's Room" however, is that movie opening-up that we all crave, not just visually but in terms of this serious, touching and funny play's themes.  As directed by Broadway's Jerry Zaks, Di Caprio more than redeems his Romeo here as a troubled teen; Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton make indelibly believeable opposite sisters, and veteran musical comedy star Gwen Verdon bestows a brave incandescence in the role of their aunt.

Starting with Johnny Mercer's creation of Capitol Records in 1942, Whiting has worked steadily as a professional performer in six decades.  The first pop star of her generation not to have been a big band singer, Whiting transcended genre then, and, like Tony Bennett and Rosemary Clooney, she transcends it still.  Space age bachelor-pad devotees of retro-1950s music will feel comfortable with Whiting's set at the Hollywood Roosevelt Cinegrill through next weekend.  But so will devotees of almost any kind of popular music from the second half of this century.  Whiting introduced such standards as "Come Rain or Come Shine," and "That Old Black Magic."  She came by her musicality naturally, as the daughter of songwriter Richard Whiting.  He wrote the music to "My Ideal," "Too Marvelous for Words," "On the Good Ship Lollipop" and "Beyond the Blue Horizon."  Margaret opens her Cinegrill set, appropriately, with her father's "Hooray for Hollywood."  Whiting at almost 72 doesn't have every single note exactly in place, but she looks more or less the same as she always has, and is forthright and effective in her delivery.  If you care about pop music history don't miss this set.<BR>	I can't be at all enthusiastic about an ambitious but way  under-realized revival of Maxwell Anderson's "Anne of the Thousand Days" put on by Theatre Tribe at the CBS Studio Center in Studio City.  Anne is Anne Boleyn, the second wife of Henry VIII.  She had about one thousand days to produce a male heir or incur Henry's ultimate wrath, and lose her head.  Anderson, who wrote historical plays about Anne's daughter "Elizabeth The Queen," and her cousin, "Mary of Scotland" is now best remembered for "The Bad Seed."  Anne and Henry were fascinating subjects for both serious historians and romance novel fans for about four centuries before Anderson framed his play in the 1950s.  So the material is timeless.  But in spite of a lessening of power and respect accorded to royals, especially in England, in the four decades since, Henry and his Anne were not just the Bickersons in Tudor times.   Their impact on history reverberates today. And not treating Anne and Henry as truly larger than life--but rather as Melanie Griffith and Antonio Banderas manque--is the fatal flaw of  director Stuart Rogers's production.  Add to that the egregious miscasting of Len Donato as Henry VIII.  Not only is he physically and emotionally all wrong for the role, Donato sounds like a Long Island soccer coach.  Call me old-fashioned, but I do think Henry  VIII, above all British monarchs, should sound like a king, and speak the king's English.  As Anne, Elisa Beth Garver, is callow enough, but she's trying so many different moods and acting styles that only once in a while does she hit on the right one for the moment.  A few of the supporting players gamely slog through, some of them even seeming to have a modicum of acquaintance with Elizabethan theatre and English accents.  You could, I guess, do "Anne of the Thousand Days" in modern dress with American accents.  But this production didn't mean to do that.  The sumptuous and authentic period costumes  must have cost a disproportionate amount of money to make or rent.  They only emphasize the lack of thinking through in the production itself.   </BLOCKQUOTE><BR><A HREF="thoughts.html#PastShows">Back.</A><PRE></PRE><CENTER> <A HREF="../m.html"><IMG ALIGN=top SRC="../images/kcrwww.gif"WIDTH=144 HEIGHT=48 BORDER=0></A> </CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Sometimes we critics only get to review something after the fact.  
The most obvious reason for this is that the show or event occurs 
one-time only.  We can talk about it after it's come and gone, or 
not at all.  But sometimes a show has been running for six weeks, 
and because of the press of dozens of other seemingly worthy 
productions, we don't get to attend until the last weekend of the run.
Which brings up another problem--most smaller theatre presentations 
in greater Los Angeles tend to be open on weekends only.   My policy 
usually is that if a production is mostly without merit, I won't 
review it after the fact.  But if it's worthy in some key aspects, 
I will.  
<BR>
This week I have one of each for you--a one-shot concert, 
bass-baritone Bryn Terfel at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion; and a 
one-person show closed last weekend, "Donna's Day," at the Jewel Box 
Theatre in North Hollywood.  Two vocalists, accompanied by a piano 
apiece, but otherwise very different shows.  Bryn Terferl of course 
is the next big thing in the world of opera and recitals.  
The 31-year-old Welshman is this season's Cecilia Bartoli in terms 
of natural gifts and high expectations.  He is rightly acclaimed far 
and wide as a performer of astonishing versatility and power.  A near 
capacity audience Monday night (only, alas) saw firsthand what all 
the shouting was about.  And shouting is only a small part of it.  
Terfel, a large man, is a tuba who can also play piccolo with his 
voice, and does, often, deliberately and to great effect.  He is 
also an acting singer, who can convey with body language and facial 
gestures the humor or heaviness of songs in German, Welsh and French.
In English he's positively electrifying.  The first half of the program consisted of Schubert lieder, a charming cycle of songs rather than a song cycle.  In the second half, Terfel sang four Ibert songs written for Chaliapin to sing in a 1931 movie version of "Don Quixote," and six Vaughn Williams Songs of Travel.  His encores consisted of two Flanders and Swann numbers from their 1960s musicals "At the Drop of a Hat" and "At the Drop of Another Hat"--and four Welsh folk tunes.  It was an altogether satisfying evening sung by someone who knows how to use his magnificent vocal instrument, and also knows how to play an audience.  Pianist Malcolm Martineau provided complementary, understated accompaniment.  Now that he's made it big, Terfel might consider a new tailor, especially for his trousers.<P>
<BR>
I've always felt that Doris Day was the underrated popular singer of 
our lifetime, in part a prisoner of her movie image.  So it's 
always nice to hear that someone else feels that way too.  
Donna Getzinger was born just about as Day was retiring from all 
media, so her admiration is all the more remarkable.  
In "Donna's Day," more a tribute than a biography in song, 
Getzinger certainly hits all the musical high spots, in a pleasant 
voice that is only intermittently reminiscent of Day's.  
Unfortunately, as her own writer, Getzinger has also tried to be 
fairly comprehensive about the movies of Doris Day, and to cover 
the highs and lows of her professional and personal lives.  This 
show deserves an after life, but only after some careful re-working.  
It's too long; "Donna's Day" would be better served by a 
ninety-minute-long single act, instead of two acts split by an 
intermission.  (Getzinger changes costumes on stage anyway, one 
of the show's elements that does work well.)  Also, the faux 
Doris Day movie musical that intends to keep the piece together 
should be scrapped.  "Donna's Day" can work better as bioplay in 
concert than as all that plus pastiche.  Streamlining would also 
better focus the direction, choreography and set design.  Despite 
those caveats, "Donna's Day" was worth seeing, for its passion and 
exhuberence.  And Alan Axelrod's musical direction and accompaniment 
were just right.

This weekend is your last chance to see "The Root," at Theatre Exchange in North Hollywood.
This gritty and unexpectedly funny play by Gary Richards is about four venal men in the 
underbelly of Brooklyn.  They attempt both to use and one-up one another with Mametish macho 
gamesmanship.  These four characters are a corrupt cop, a ghetto-bred procurer, a producer of 
porno movies and a second-generation auto mechanic turned chop-shop operator.  
And you wouldn't be so taken with any of them if they weren't so well acted--by Gregg Daniel,
Dave Florek, Eddie Jones and Don Fischer.  
(Fischer is the stand-by for the actor playing the highly conflicted owner of the chop-shop 
in which all of the action takes place; I happened to see Fischer, but it's hard to imagine
the regular cast member as being much better.)  The success of the production also owes a 
lot to Anita Khanzadian's taut direction on a tiny stage.  And Bradley Kaye's seedy garage
set allows us to be convinced that stolen cars are being stripped for their parts just
through that door, even as stolen lives are being stripped of their dignity before our eyes.
"The Root" takes its title from the biblical admonition "the love of money is the root of
all evil."  The play's central premise is that the four characters started out to be as
honorably ambitious as most of us, but were seduced by circumstances into the netherworld 
of "easy" money.  Both the horror and the humor of "The Root" emanate from that notion's being 
so close to the fine line of rationalizing in most of us.<P>
<BR>
One of the playwrighting godfathers of fine lines, Tennessee Williams, seems to
be having a major revival in small theatres around town.  First there were two separate 
productions of several of his one-act plays.  Now three of his best-known full-length plays 
are having productions around town: "The Glass Menagerie" at A Noise Within, "The Rose Tattoo"
at the Hudson Theatre, and "Orpheus Descending" at the Fountain Theatre.  This last was the
first to open, and is something of a surprise hit, having been given multiple extensions. 
Presumably the enthusiasm among audiences for this "Orpheus Descending" is generated by those
who have never seen any production of this play before.  Not that there's anything especially 
wrong with Simon Levy's staging other than the limitations imposed by a small, shallow stage. 
It's hard to evoke an entire general store, complete with storeroom, confectionary and a 
staircase to upstairs living quarters in this cramped area.  (Locational believeability was 
further hampered by
serious electrical power problems the night I saw the play.)  And the two leads, 
Karen Kondazian as the middleaged second-generation Italian demi-widow running this small-town 
Mississippi store, and Cameron Dye as the young drifter who awakens her sexual passions, are
quite credible.  (Although Kondazian's accent sounds more Polish to me than Italian, she does 
have her Magnanisms down pat.)  Dye, especially, is completely convincing in the Brandoesque 
role, although his Cajun accent is so good as to be at times unintelligible.  The big problem 
is that "Orpheus Descending" is minor Williams.  This 1957 play at times seems just a reworking
of "The Rose Tattoo," the 1951 play whose 1955 movie version won an Oscar for Anna Magnani as
the real widow, opposite Burt Lancaster's truck driver.  "Orpheus Descending" is better known 
for its 1959 movie version, "The Fugitive Kind," with Magnani again, and Marlon Brando.  Even 
the Broadway revival of a few years back, led by Vanessa Redgrave, couldn't elevate "Orpheus
Desceding" to the first rank of Tennessee Williams plays.

The Walt Disney Concert Hall, to be located at First Street and Grand Avenue in the historically and culturally prominent Bunker Hill district of downtown Los Angeles, is designed by the internationally recognized architecture firm Frank O. Gehry & Associates, located in Santa Monica, California.  This unique design is the result of a design process that began in 1987, when an invited design competition was held after Lillian Disney gave an initial donation of $50 million toward the construction of a new concert hall to be built in the name of her late husband, Walt Disney.

The majority of the 3.6-acre site in which the Walt Disney Concert Hall is located is devoted to a large garden that surrounds the building itself.  The garden, equally accessible from the building and from the surrounding streets, encourages the feeling that the Walt Disney Concert Hall is an inviting oasis in the midst of the immediate urban environment and provides a pleasant gathering place for concert patrons and pedestrians alike.</font>

<B>Michael Silverblatt:</B>  Hello and welcome to Bookworm and today my guest is Salman Rushdie. Around 20 years ago I was working as a clerk in a bookstore that no longer exists in Los Angeles. Into the store came a man whose face I recognized although I didn't think he'd be here in this city. It was a translator and poet named Richard Howard. He had just done a monumental new translation of Boudelare. I took the opportunity to ask him what it was that I should be reading, because everyone has a secret book or a secret new book. And he said that I should read immediately <I>Midnight's Children</I>, that Salman Rushdie was the most significant writer to have appeared in America in many years. I read the book, I read his previous book <I>Grimase</I>.  I followed his career.  Seven years ago, the day before an event that has become so famous that we needn't talk about it very much, I was to interview Mr. Rushdie who was obliged, the very day before, to go into hiding.  He's been in hiding for seven years. He has recently published his newest novel. It's been brought out in America by Pantheon. The book is called <I>The Moor's Last Sigh</I>. And I'm very pleased to have you here today.
<P>
<P><B>Salman Rushdie:</B> Hello, sorry I'm a little late.<P>
<B>MS:</B>  I wanted to begin by asking you, this book seems to be very much about matriarchy -- the domination of women and mothers and mother India. I wonder what brought you to be writing a mother book at this moment of the world.<P>
<P>
<B>SR:</B> Well, the mother India theme, I suppose, was one, was if you like the intellectual way into the book.  The fact is that the idea of India as a mother, the idea of the mother goddess has always been the most central defining image of India. I thought that the trouble is that it's often presented either in pious terms or more recently in movie sentimental kitsch tones in which the mother is presented as a kind of indomitable and extremely sentimentalized figure. I thought I'd like to invent a different sort of mother, not rural but urban. Not slushy but kind of gritty and sassy with a bad mouth on her, and so on. And this led me really to the character of Aurora, the mother, well, the last of the matriarchs of the novel and the most monstrous, probably, of them. The real truth is novels don't come into being for abstract intellectual reasons, they come into being because something catches fire. What happened is the character of Aurora just grew into a kind of blaze. The moment I had her, also her mother Belle and the matriarch Epiphania, the three successive generations of bad mouthing women in this novel -- that's how I felt I had the novel's heart.
<P>
<P>
<B>MS:</B> The novel begins with an image of India for export, of the spices and the odors of the spices that take over the ocean around the island on which the book begins. It is an India for export that most readers come to.  Intellectuals, perhaps, come from India song, Margarite Duras, a little bit of Naipo, a good bit of Kipling.  How does one dare, as Joyce dared to create a Dublin so specific that no one reading the book outside of Ireland could know its shopkeepers and streets, how does one write a novel that penetrates a world and disregards at the same time the fact that that world is not known to the majority of its readers.
<P>
<P>
<B>SR:</B> You write it obsessively and insanely and with passion and you hope that that communicates. I think that the truth is that all cities in novels are, in a way, imaginary cities. This Bombay I believe to be deeply rooted in the real Bombay, but nevertheless it's my Bombay. Another writer approaching the city would approach it differently, would find different things there. So in the end it's a city of words and it's my job to make that alien city one which the reader can enter whether he's ever been there or not. I do think that one of the things that made me a writer was that the books that I read in English, which dealt with India and the reality I'd grown up in that I knew, just didn't seem to me to be right. It didn't mean they weren't good. I can admire E.M. Forrester, and I do indeed. But the kind of music on the page in <I>A Passage to India</I> was not the music in my head. It seemed strange that the famous books that were written about India tended to be rather cool books whereas it seemed to me that the one thing India was not was cool, but it was hot. I thought I needed to try and find a way of writing a kind of hot, smelly, noisy, crowded, messy prose because that would, it seemed to me, would be a way of echoing a reality that was there. And I knew in exactly the same as sitting in India and reading Ulysses long before I'd ever seen Dublin. I felt entirely able to enter Joyce's Dublin. I really, I had no idea that closely related to an actually existing city. I didn't give a damn. I was very happy to be there. In the same way, long before I had ever been to South America, I was able to read the great South American writers like Borges and Garcia Marquez and was able to be carried into the Buenos Aries of Borges, the macando of Garcia Marquez, and it didn't matter to me that I didn't really know the place because the book was the place that I was in and I was happy to be there. And I would hope that that would be the same for anyone entering my cities or my books.
<P>
<P>
<B>MS:</B> Because most of the listeners who know your name will not know your work, which is an unfortunate condition of your condition, I wanted to primarily help them place it literarily. It seems to me that those days or weeks or months that you read Ulysses in India must have had the quality of an epochal event for your imagination. Was Joyce a primary father?
<P>
<P>

<B>SR:</B> Yes. I think there's no question about it. I think I thought when I first read Joyce, and I still think today, that he is certainly the greatest English language writer of the 20th century and quite possibly, as a novelist, the greatest English language novelist ever. I mean you'd have to think of only one or two people who could give him a run for his money, Dickens for example. So yes, Joyce is so good that it makes you want to give up.  What is there left to do? It took me a long time to recover, if you like, from Joyce and work out that there might be one or two corners of the world that was still worth writing about. <P>

<B>MS:</B> I might be entirely wrong, but in the uproar about the controversial sections of <I>The Satanic Verses</I>, it seemed that very few people, if any, noticed that that is an adaptation in a sense of a section of <I>Finnegan's Wake</I> in which the two brothers, Shem and Sean are carrying on their war down the margins of a page while there's a central text at the center and the two are falling, falling, falling. I wondered, the madness of <I>Finnegan's Wake</I> and one's expectation -- I had a friend who said, if you had a million dollar bill the best place to hide it would be in a copy of <I>Finnegan's Wake</I> because no one would look there and no one would find it there.
<P>
<P>
<B>SR:</B> I think it's true that you and I must be two of the very few people in America at this moment who have in fact read <I>Finnegan's Wake</I>. I suspect I would not have read it had it not been for the fact that I was going out with a girl who was writing a Ph.D. thesis about it.
<P>
<P>
<B>MS:</B> The dangers of love.
<P>
<P>
<B>SR:</B> Exactly, so I had to read it. But I'm glad I did. I'm not a great <I>Wake</I> man, actually. I think it has brilliance in it but the incomprehensibility of it, I think, is a real problem for me as it is for most people. I think Joyce was a great writer of clarity. And I think <I>Finnegan's Wake</I> was, I would see, as a colossal blind alley. Because when Joyce wrote straightforwardly and from the heart about things he knew, such as in the <I>Dubliners</I> stories and in the great short story <I>The Dead</I>, he wrote like an angel. It's that Joyce that I respond to. I also respond to the playfulness of the Joyce of <I>Ulysses</I> and I think playfulness in literature is something I've always responded to, not only in Joyce but in Lawrence Stern and Italo Calvino and in all sorts of people like that. I think it may have to do with having grown up in a family, but not only a family, in a society where people were playful with language. In our household certainly language jokes were two a penny. We were always cracking bad jokes. I had three sisters and they were all very noisy and voluble and in order to get into the conversation you had to be louder and funnier than them. So I grew up in that kind of atmosphere so maybe that's why I responded to the light-heartedness and the sense of play in these writers that we've been talking about and tried to inject some of that in my own writing.
<P>
<P>
<B>MS:</B> But am I right in thinking that that section of <I>Finnegan's Wake</I> informs or lies behind <I>The Satanic Verses</I>
<P>
<P>
<B>SR:</B> Only that I was conscious of the echo. I wouldn't put it more strongly than that. The way in which <I>The Satanic Verses</I> began was simply that I had this image of this exploding airplane and two people falling out of it and, like the characters in <I>Finnegan's Wake</I>, disputing as they fell, dancing, singing, embracing each other, arguing, flapping their hands as if they were wings and making a soft landing on a beach on the southern coast of England. I find myself thinking as Butch Cassidy said to the Sundance Kid, who are these guys? It took me ages to find out who they were. And the novel really did grow out of that image. The rest is, I'm afraid, history.
<P>
<P>
<B>MS:</B> Falling is very much a central image in your work. In this novel, Aurora, the mother, the matriarch, the artist, leaps to her death or at least appears to. And falling in love becomes for the narrator, the Moor, a version of the mother's death in fact. What is it about that fall? Is it falling in the garden, the primal fall, what's the fall?
<P>
<B>SR:</B> I think it may well have something to do with that, and that's again, to mention <I>Finnegan's Wake</I> again, that's a novel that begins with a fall.
<P>
<P>
<B>MS:</B> Humpty Dumpty's among others.
<P>
<P>
<B>SR:</B> Humpty Dumpty's and the human race's.  I suppose that that idea, the fall through space but also the fall from grace is something that I have kind of rather obsessively written about. I suppose one reason, just thinking about it as we speak, might be that I'm interested in what happens to characters when you take them out of, as the Moor, the narrator of the new novel says, when you take them out of, what they have every right to think of as, their natural life. So you pluck somebody, in whatever way, out of their life whether by accident or by design or by war or exile or through a random act of God, as they say. And the person suddenly unhoused, without the protection of comfortably known surroundings and people is suddenly obliged to act out of pure humanity, that is to say he no longer has any socializing, normalizing comfort around him or her.  And I've been very interested in what happens when that happens. In many of my novels there are such moments, there are moments when people are torn out of the comfortable world they know and have to accommodate themselves to a new world. One of the phenomena in which one could describe in that way is the phenomenon of migration and that's what primarily <I>The Satanic Verses</I> was about. It's about how people are ripped from one world and land in another. It's also in <I>The Moor's Last Sigh</I>, after all, here is a character born to privilege and wealth, he's born into a very elite family and not just elite in money terms but also in the world of art. They've got a high Bohemian family. And at a given point he is expelled from that Eden. And there's a fall from, actually the novel uses the references to <I>Paradise Lost</I>. It's a fall from paradise into pandemonium. I'm interested in it. It's a way to find out what people are like, taking them from the thing they know.<P><CENTER>(Continued)</CENTER><P>

Alan Nierob began his career at Rogers & Cowan Inc. in 1979
as an intern in the public relations company's Entertainment
Division. Several promotions later, he is now the Executive
Vice President of Rogers & Cowan's Entertainment Division.
<P>
Over the years, Mr. Nierob has worked with numerous actors,

<P>
PR firms such as Rogers & Cowan handle campaigns for movie
and television actors, directors, producers and shows as
well as personal publicity for stars and personalities. They
assist a celebrity in managing his or her media coverage,
both good and bad, and often act as that star's link to
the outside world. The duties of a Hollywood publicist 
can include deciding which charities, personal appearances,
interviews and photos a celebrity will support or grant.

One of the biggest publicity companies in the world, Rogers
& Cowan's Hollywood office represents such A-list stars and
directors as Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone, Steve Martin,
and Robert Zemeckis. The company was founded by Warren Cowan
and Henry Rogers; it is now owned by a British conglomerate.

Jason Bentley was one of the DJ's at the <I>In Seventh Heaven</I> gathering.  The party was broken up when many were sickened by a liquid that is believed to have been GHB:
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Wednesday, January 1, 1997</B> 
              <H1>16 Sickened by Substance Given Out at Party</H1> 
<BR>
<BR>


At least 16 revelers at a New Year's Eve party at the
                                   Olympic Auditorium in downtown Los Angeles were rushed
         to hospitals--12 of them in serious to critical
                       condition--after they drank a liquid that may have been the
                             dangerous drug known as GHB, a city firefighter said. 
                             Officials said the victims were overcome after
                                drinking from some of the 100 bottles of a substance called
                                   "Herbal FX" that were distributed at the auditorium. 
                                         The revelers were at the party when they collapsed,
                                     officials said. Some of the victims had stopped breathing,
                                           emergency medical crews said. 
                                           Officials said other people at the auditorium may
                                    have been overcome. Fire officials said more ambulances
                                     were being sent to the auditorium at Grand Avenue and
                                       Washington Boulevard. 
                                  Those stricken at the "In Seventh Heaven" gathering
                                  were being transported by ambulances to three area
                             hospitals. 
                                   Four of the victims were reported in stable condition.
                   Preliminary reports are that a liquid substance had been
                           passed among the revelers at the Olympic Auditorium," Los
                      Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said. "It could be any one of a number of substances."

The exterior of the building, which will evolve as a direct expression of the Concert Hall's interior volume, will be clad in limestone and titanium panels.  The boldly curving and folding facades of the exterior will create dynamic, highly sculptural views from the garden and from the surrounding streets and plazas.

The heart and true focus of the interior is the 2,380-seat concert hall, intended to function as a natural acoustics hall with no amplification.  The concert hall, which evolved as a direct expression of acoustic parameters, features an undulating wooden ceiling, wood-wrapped seating blocks surrounding the orchestra platform on all sides and a highly sculptural pipe organ located between seating blocks at the rear of the platform.  Skylights and a large window allow natural light to enhance daytime concerts, and at night the large window funnels interior light through to the exterior, creating a beacon announcing the activities within.
<br>
Freestanding walls were developed to enhance and balance the distribution of sound to the various seating tiers. <br><br><br><br><br>

 The most sculpturally and acoustically dramatic interior form is the ceiling, which billows upward from a low point above the orchestra platform in a series of convexly curved tiers, providing surface planes for the sound reflection critical to symphonic performance.  The interior volumes of the concert hall evolved as a direct expression of the critical acoustical parameters, and in turn, provided the foundation for the design of the building's exterior forms.</font><br><br>

The Walt Disney Concert Hall is the result of a lengthy design process using sketches, computer models and scale architectural models.  From the beginning, Frank Gehry sought the counsel of internationally recognized musicians, conductors and directors in the development of all design concepts.  Early sketches and diagrams were developed into physical models at various scales, and these models ultimately led to the development of full-scale mock-ups, in stone and metal for exterior elements and in wood for interior elements.  These mock-ups assisted in the refinement of details and in the confirmation of construction feasibility. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The extensive use of models and mock-ups also allowed for the creation of an open dialogue during the design process, in which the Disney family, the Philharmonic, the Music Center and local artists and contractors participated.<br><br>

<br>
The Walt Disney Concert Hall has already achieved international recognition.  The design was exhibited in the U.S. Pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 1991 and has been featured in numerous publications throughout the world.  In 1992 the design received an honor award from Progressive Architecture Magazine for the sculptural power of its form and the fluid procession of its indoor and outdoor spaces.</font>

Frank Gehry is the principal of the firm of Frank O. Gehry and Associates, which he established in 1962.  Among his most acclaimed designs are the Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao, Spain; American Center, Paris, France; Frederick Weisman Art Museum, Minneapolis, Minnesota; Chiat/Day Building, Venice, California; and the renovation of The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA (formerly the Temporary Contemporary), Los Angeles, California.  He was awarded architecture's highest honor, the Pritzker Architecture Prize, in 1989 and was named by TIME Magazine as one of the "TIME 25" earlier this year.
<br>
<br>
Gehry has taught at Yale University, Harvard University, the University of Southern California, the University of California at Los Angeles and the Southern California Institute of Architecture.  His drawings, models and furniture have been featured in exhibitions in museums around the world,

Hollywood Wrap's Top Ten Frequently Asked Questions

</TT></B></FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE = +1><B>OK... IT'S NOT TEN YET.  BUT IT WILL BE SOON.</B></FONT>

</CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B> Ive scrimped and saved for a vacation in Los Angeles. But, before I leave, I want a guarantee that Ill see a celebrity. Can you point me in the right direction?
<P>

<B>Answer:</B> So you want to see celebrities, eh? Well, they're certainly not standing at the corner of Hollywood and Vine. They're rarely attractions on the Universal Studios Tour. And theyre absolutely not calling out to you looky-loos, "Yoo-hoo, we're over here!"<P>
What they are is elusive. Yet they're everywhere. Because Los Angeles is indeed a great big Celebrity-O-Rama--that is, if you know the secret places for star-gazing. Well-known actors and actresses are surprisingly accessible because a lot of them don't hide inside of limousines or send minions to do chores. Instead, they drive themselves, shop for themselves and go out in public by themselves without bodyguard in tow. "Strangely enough, you're not going to find them in the places you'd most expect," says Scott Downie, one of Hollywood's premiere celebrity photographers who knows the haunts and habits of a heaven's worth of stars. "I'm more likely to see them stopping by my dry cleaners than shopping on Rodeo Drive." (Ergo all those ridiculous wall of photographs signed To the best car wash in the world, love Burt and Loni.)<P>
So where do professional celebrity hunters like Downie go to snap the celebs? "I've         gotten my best pictures hanging outside the 31 Flavors on Canon Drive in Beverly Hills. Goldie Hawn, Richard Dreyfuss, it seems to me someone's always getting an ice cream cone there." Which explains why even a nobody can pick produce alongside Johnny Carson at the Hughes Market in Malibu, try on T-shirts in the dressing room next to Uma Thurman's in the Fred Segal store in West Hollywood and eat Death-by-Chocolate dessert alongside Harrison Ford at pricey Patina restaurant on Melrose.<P>
But, first, if you're a stalker, do us all a favor and don't read on. Nobody wants you around (and most celebrities hire security firms to keep you under wraps.) If you're just a fan, then follow some simple rules of etiquette for close encounters of the famous kind. Maintain your dignity. Don't be a pest. It's all right to say hi, or even to whisper "I love your movies." But don't get in their face. Don't push for an autograph. Try not to interrupt them when they're eating. Never take a photo without permission. And please, please, leave them alone in the bathroom.<P>
OK, so now the dish. Or dishes. Yes, the best place to see stars are LA's hottest restaurants. But often that means shelling out $100-plus for lunch or dinner. Trust me: save your money and go down the street to Pink's and Tail-O-The-Pup, the two best hot dog stands in Los Angeles. Pink's is where Sean Penn proposed to Madonna (and where both stars still get their junk food fixes) and where Eddie Murphy eats with his entourage when hes in town. Tail--a small fiberglass stand shaped like a hot dog and bun--boasts a clientele as diverse as Jay Leno, Lily Tomlin, Luke Perry, Neil Diamond, George Clooney and Bette Midler. "Jay likes his hot dogs plain. Bette orders the Red Eye with mustard, relish, onion and tomato," says manager Dennis Blake. Even young Hollywood interrupts their vegetarian diets for a Tail hot dog from time to time. In fact, when Generation X talk show host Jon Stewart made a trip to L.A. recently, he threw his get-to-know-me party at Tail-o-the-Pup.<P>
Speaking of Leno, it's well known that he and the rest of Hollywood love to collect vintage cars. If you're hankering for a glimpse of stars and their cars, then head to their servicing hangout, Solo Performance in North Hollywood. Another of Hollywood's hobbies is gun ownership in these brutal times. Which is why the shooting range at the Beverly Hills Gun Club is packed with celebs ranging from Ice-T to Charlie Sheen.<P>
If you simply must see where the stars live (and Elvis only know why), then be prepared to see more gate than house. Forget those expensive Maps of the Stars' Homes: they're out of date and out of touch. (Ugh, one version still lists the street  where Agnes Moorhead used to live, and her TV show Bewitched is on the Nick at Night cable network.) My advice instead is to drive up Mulholland Drive and ascend to the overlook in the Hollywood Hills. There, you'll find a row of giant telescopes. One of them is focused on "Madonna's House": for a quarter, you'll see that wildly painted, over-sized white elephant which is one reason why she's called The Material Girl. (Perhaps the telescopes were the reason, but Madonna has put that manse on the market.) <P>
Other not-so-obvious locations for star-gazing include the Santa Palm Car Wash in West Hollywood where Brad Pitt is known to frequent, the no-name pizzeria in the small shopping center at the intersection of Beverly Glen and Mulholland where Warren Beatty takes his movie meetings, and the 24-hour Jewish deli Canter's on Fairfax Avenue where Guns 'n' Roses bandmembers hang out in the pre-dawn hours. Don't forget the old world Italian restaurant Dan Tana's in West Hollywood: it's Bruce Springsteen's favorite eating place.<P>
Then, there's Hollywood Billiards where Kiefer Sutherland, Keanu Reeves and the Red Hot Chili Peppers shoot pool. The Rock Store attracts bikers like Mickey Rourke, Billy Idol and Dennis Hopper. And Gelson's in the Pacific Palisades is a gourmet food store where Bruce Willis was asked to autograph a grapefruit. Of course, you can always feign sickness and head to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica where VIPs like Michael Jackson and Elizabeth Taylor are regularly recovering from something-or-other.<P>
	And, finally, it's true that every dog has his day in Hollywood. Wanna get a glimpse of that popular Frasier pooch Eddie (whose real name is Moose)? Then pad the aisles at Centinela Feed and Pet Supplies where he's partial to healthful dog snacks and the squeaky toy shaped like a hamburger. Gosh, on his salary, it should be filet mignon.

<B>Question:  </b>Hey, I have a great idea for a movie. It's
&quot;Witness&quot; meets &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; with a little
&quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; thrown in. How do I let the
Hollywood moguls know about it?<P><b>Answer: </b>You don't. Unless
you're a bonafide box office star like Tom Cruise or Arnold
Schwarzenegger, or an Oscar-winning director like Martin Scorsese
or Jim Brooks, you can't get a movie made on an idea alone. 
 It's been eons since Hollywood made a deal off just a treatment, which i
s a three-to-ten page recitation of the plot for a film, from anyone but 
a superstar. You might have better luck if you or someone you know had so
mething awful/wonderful happen to them that made the evening news. Then, 
television and movie producers would be knocking at your door for the rig
hts to the story. I tell people that, if they have a great idea, write a 
novel, get it published and then Hollywood might want it. The only
problem is that the publishing world is as almost hard to break
into as Hollywood.

<P>

<HR WIDTH = 10%>

<p>


<b>Question:</b> OK, so now I've taken this idea and used it as the basis
 of a screenplay. I'm certain I've written the next Oscar winner. How do 
I get someone powerful to read it?<P>
<b>Answer: </b>First, are you <I>sure</I> you've written a
screenplay? Have you ever <I>read</I> a screenplay? You don't
necessarily have to take one of those $500 screenplay-writing
courses to pen a movie, but it helps --if for no other reason than
you understand the structure of a film. Some basic requirements
include fleshed-out characters, story development, t hree solid
acts and a length between 100 and 120 pages. You say you've done
all this?<P> 

Fine, now for the hard part. The odds of sending your screenplay to
the head of Paramount Pictures or to Mel Gibson's office and
getting it read are, well, less than zero. Same goes for the
chairman of any of Hollywood's top talent and literary agencies.
The fact is that everything in Hollywood is done through
networking--that phenomenon where you know somebody, and somebody
knows somebody, and that person knows another person, and so 
 on and so forth. So the question to ask yourself is, Do I know
anybody in Hollywood?<P> 

Chances are good that you do. First, query your family for a
distant cousin or inlaw-twice-removed who might be a paper-pusher
at a production office or sound studio. Your uncle doesn't
<I>necessarily</I> have to be Robert Daly, the chairman and CEO of
Warner Bros. Pictures--but, hey, it works even if he's the studio
commisary bookkeeper.
<P>
If you haven't any relatives in The Biz,
then call your college or fraternity alumni office and ask if
anyone's on file who works in Hollywood. If 
 it's someone who was in your class, then maybe they even remember
you. If not, they still may be willing to give a leg up to someone
they have something in common with. This also holds true if you have
an unusual hobby.
<P>
Still coming up empty-handed? Do not, repeat, DO NOT quit your
job and move out to Los Angeles hoping to become an overnight
sensation.  Must I remind you that Quentin Tarantino toiled in
obscurity as a clerk in a video  store for years until he was
&quot;discovered&quot; by Hollywood? Then do what a friend of a
friend of mine did. An accountant living in upstate New York, he
saved up his vacation from work, took all three weeks in Los Angeles
and worked in the offices of several producers and agents by going
to a temp agency and telling them he <I>only</I> wanted jobs in the
entertainment business. He did manage to get several Hollywood
players to read his screenplay and offer suggestions on how to
improve it. And, while there's been no sale as of yet, he is hard at
work on his second screenplay and now has solid contacts who will be
willing to read his work in the future. My kudos to him!

 <P>

<P>

<B>Question:</B> I love the movies and I want to work in Hollywood
as either a director, producer, studio executive or agent. How do I
get a good job where I won't just be fetching someone's
capuccino?
<P> 

<B>Answer:</B> Get off that high horse of yours. You'd be <I>lucky</I> to
 fetch a suit from the cleaners (you have to get promoted before
you're allowed to make cappucino!). The most coveted entry-level
jobs in Hollywood are the so-called mailroom jobs where dozens of
over-qualified young men and women do menial and even humiliating
errands for executives at the studios and agencies. These days,
those positions are so competitive that you won't even be considered
unless you have an MBA, PhD or law degree, graduated from one of the
country's top film schools or (again) have a relative or school chum
well-placed in The Industry. And then you're given the privilege of
earning sub-existence wages for extra-long hours.
<P>
Still, it's the best way to start in Hollywood. Other low rungs
on the food chain you might try are working as someone's secretary,
scoring an unpaid internship or just simply volunteering your
services. Then dazzle everyone with your brilliance, creativity and
initiative! For a dose of Hollywood reality, I suggest you rent a
terrific comedy that's something of a
 cult film in the Industry -- &quot;The Big Picture,&quot; starring Kevin
 Bacon. There's a wonderful scene in it where Bacon, having fallen flat o
n his face in Hollywood, applies for a job as a waiter. On his
resume, he's listed his profession as &quot;film director.&quot;
Says the restaurant manager, &quot;Oh, you're a director? Our busboy
is a director, too.&qu ot; Needless to say, there weren't any
openings for director/waiters at that eatery. Bacon did find work as
a messenger.
<P>
Again, one of the best ways to get your foot in the door is to
sign up with a temp agency that places people with entertainment
companies. But before you even apply, make sure you have solid
typing and word processing  kills, can do lots of cool things on the
computer and look presentable.
<P>
<HR WIDTH = 10%>
<P>
<B>Question:</B> I've decided to move to Los
Angeles and find that job in Hollywood. What can I expect to find in
terms of apartment prices, cost of living, and other matters. Will I
make it?
<P>

<B>Answer:</B> Start saving your money NOW. Actually, Los Angeles
is a lot less expensive to live in than, say, New York City. But not
if you're coming from Topeka, Kansas. Studio (one-room) apartments
in a safe neighborhood start at about $400-$500.  One-bedroom
apartments range from $650 to $900. And two-bedroom apartments go
for $950 and up. These somewhat reasonable rents are because many
Los Angelenos can't sell their condominiums and have placed them on
the rental market instead. But buying a home in Los Angeles is
extraordinarily expensive, probably twice or three times the price
of real estate in other cities. One thing is certain: you're going
to need a car to get around because LA's public transportation is a
last resort at best. The bad news is that car insurance prices
continue to soar: expect to pay $1,000 annually and much, much
more.
<P>
Food costs are reasonable, since many of America's food-growers are
based right here in California. The markets are always full of fresh
fruit and  vegetables throughout the year. Also, cheap and good
restaurants around town are plentiful. Then, of course, the weather
is --in a word-- spectacular so you'll save money on air
conditioning and heating costs compared to other climates. You also
won't need two wardrobes, one for hot weather and one for cold&#59;
be like Los Angelenos and simply go for that layered look. A good
leather jacket is about all you'lll need for an overcoat even in the
dead of winter.
<P>
Crime is no better or worse than anywhere else (despite what you may
have heard). Yes, the freeways clog at rush hour and when it rains.
Yes, we have earthquakes and smog. And Yes, we have floods, forest
fires and mudslides. But we also have a city filled with natural
beauty. I maintain that LA is one of those cities you can enjoy
whether you have big bucks or not. Many of its best things are
free--the beaches, the mountains, the desert just a short drive
away. So enjoy!
<P>

<P>
<B>Question:</B> OK, so what are stars really like? Is [substitute
name of star like Tom Cruise, Robert Redford, Denzel Washington] a
cool dude? Is [substitute name of star like Julia Roberts, Sandra
Bullock, Emma Thompson] fun to be around? And arent they all
terribly rich? I want the scoop.

<P>


<B>Answer:</B> This is NOT the place to find gossip about Hollywood
celebrities. Theres so much of that already, its almost overkill.
Instead, &quot;Hollywood Wrap&quot; will focus on the
behind-the-scenes players like the studio moguls, star producers,
top directors, well-known screenwriters, best personal managers and
heavy-hitting agents who normally dont get covered by television
or the tabloids (thank god!). Suffice it to say that you can name
any movie star in Hollywood and chances are theyre incredibly
hard-working folk. First, they must read scores and scores of
scripts to decide which projects they may want to act in. Theyre
constantly meeting or talking on the phone with their
&quot;team&quot; of Hollywood behind-the-sceners and considering
their advice before making decisions. 

<P>
For instance, nearly every actor or actress has an agent, who books
their work and takes 10 percent of their salary as commission.  Most
also have an attorney who looks over every contract they need to
sign and thinks up new ways they can avoid giving their entire salary
to the IRS; for this, the attorneys either charge by the hour or take
a percentage--usually five percent of an actors income from a movie.
Some also have personal managers who guide their careers and handle
the bulk of their business affairs in exchange for as much as 15
percent of their salaries or &quot;executive producer&quot; credit
on their movies for which the studios pay them a producers fee.
Other people who may be on an actors payroll include a business
manager, a personal assistant and a partner for their personal
production companies. 

<P>


Now, before you start feeling very sorry for major actors who have
to fork over huge chunks of their income to all these people,
remember this: these celebrities get paid a LOT of money. Right
now, the very top Hollywood movie actors are pulling down $20
million a picture--names like Tom Cruise, Sylvester Stallone, Mel
Gibson and Jim Carrey. Top actresses like Demi Moore and Julia
Roberts are getting paid less, about $12-to-$13 million a movie. 

<P>

In some cases, a top actor or actress will forgo taking a large wad
of cash up front for doing a role and instead make their
compensation dependent on how well the movie does at the box
office. Needless to say, the studios love it when they do this
because it lowers the cost of getting the movie made. The biggest
stars can get something called &quot;first dollar gross&quot; which
means they start taking their cut the minute you pay $7.50 at the
box office. Lesser stars get a thing called &quot;net&quot; which
is just another way in Hollywood of saying &quot;zero.&quot;
Seriously, lawsuits are increasingly being filed to challenge the
studios so-called &quot;creative&quot; accounting methods which
ensure that a movie that does boffo box office around the world
still doesnt show a profit on the books. You may have read about
one of them--Art Buchwalds fight against Paramount over Eddie
Murphys &quot;Coming to America.&quot; So if anyone ever hands you
a Hollywood contract, ask for gross--NOT net.

<B>Question:</B> Whats this thing I hear called The Buzz. Like,
&quot;such-and-such picture has good buzz.&quot; Im guessing this
has nothing to do with bees. But if a movie hasnt come out yet,
how do people know its going to be a hit or a bomb? 

<P>

<B>Answer:</B> Congratulations! Youve stumbled upon one of the most
elusive and bizarre eccentricities in Hollywood. &quot;The
Buzz&quot; is also known as The Hollywood Grapevine, The Heat, The
Word-of-Mouth, The
I-Heard-It-at-a-Party-From-Someone-Who-Is-Sleeping-With-the-Assistant-Director. What it means is dozens and dozens of people in and around show business who are all hard at work dishing and dissing the newest bundle of movies about to be dropped at the doorsteps of theaters. And, thanks good or bad Buzz on a film, careers will be made or missed, stars celebrated or sneered, and audiences pleased or punished by the silver screEn. Sometimes its downright uncanny how accurate The Buzz can be. 
After all, the word in years past on &quot;Ishtar,&quot;
&quot;Whos That Girl,&quot; &quot;Bonfire of the Vanities,&quot;
and &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; was all dead-on awful. And look at
last summers &quot;Waterworld.&quot; But just when the Industry
gets a little too cocky about its ability to predict sure-fire hits
and misses, along comes a sleeper like &quot;Fried Green
Tomatoes,&quot; &quot;Ghost,&quot; or &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet
Detective&quot; to blow every movie handicappers foolproof system
out of the water. Which all goes to show that, in the end, people
in the entertainment business probably could obtain just as
accurate a preview of summer films by sorting Tarot cards or
consulting Marianne Williamson than conversing with one another. 

<P>

Exactly who buzzes The Buzz is a subject of much discussion and
confusion in Hollywood. First on the list, though, is a rather meek
and mild man named John Krier. As president of Exhibitor Relations,
Krier supplies industry news to movie-theater owners. One of his
most important jobs, however, is to get as early a look as possible
at the upcoming Christmas and summer movies and pass the word about
whats hot and whats not to his clients. As a result, Krier has a
major impact on the initial perception of a films commercial
possibilities. Not surprisingly, Krier has become Hollywoods movie
guru, consulted by every journalist trying to make sense of a movie
schedule where as many as five or six films can be released on the
same weekend in cities everywhere. 

<P>

To his credit, Krier often can find something nice to say about
every film, even those with so little heat that Hollywood already is carrying them out in body bags. As certain as everyone was that Waterworld would be a dud, for instance, Krier was counseling Industry-watchers to remember The Buzz on Dances with Wolves. In fact, prior to its opening, The Word went out that Dances with Wolves would wind up as Kevins Gatea reference to the money-losing Heavens Gate which brought down a studio because of its dismal showing at the box office. Instead, the movie won an Oscar and made hundreds of millions.

<P>

Next in line to murmur are those studio executives, lawyers, agents,
managers and assorted underlings who attend those infamously secret
test screenings. Now, if truth be told, almost no one ever publicly
acknowledges that a film registered lousy scores.  Privately,
however, this sort of bad news spreads as quickly as a Malibu brush
fire. Thats how word got out that &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;
would be first on the flop list. 

<P>

Following in the food chain are the Hollywood hairdressers, makeup
artists and other gadabouts who simply cant stop themselves from
passing along the latest gossip--often from the mouths of the very
celebrities starring in the very movies everyone wants to know
about. Then, of course, there are the journalists, some of whom are
shown movies in rough cut so they can decide as early as possible
whether they like a particular film. If they do, then perhaps Keanu
or Sandra will wind up on an upcoming Vanity Fair cover. If not,
then the studios know to clear the decks, raise the anchor and set
sail immediately because a storm of criticism will head their way
within weeks. 

<P>

<P>

<B>Question:</B> Gee, Im hearing more and more how much films cost
and what money they brought in at the box office. I usually go to
the movies just to be entertained; if I wanted to hear about this
business stuff, Id subscribe to the Wall Street Journal. Why all
the talk about dough? 

<P>

<B>Answer:</B> Its perhaps the most hotly debated subject in the
film industry today, this blood sport over the ballooning cost of
blockbuster movies especially in those with never-before-seen
special effects--including the first &quot;Superman&quot; movie,
&quot;Terminator 2,&quot; &quot;Cliffhanger,&quot; &quot;Last Action
Hero,&quot; &quot;Waterworld&quot; and now Arnold Schwarzeneggers
upcoming &quot;Eraser.&quot; Even worse in the case of some huge
flops, the huge sums spent on them werent visible on the screen in
the form of rock em, sock em action sequences. 

<P>

I contend that most of the time there IS a correlation between
budget and quality when it comes to movies--with some exceptions,
usually the more that was spent, the worse the movie is. I also
believe that the audience has a right to know what a movie costs
before it opens. After all, nearly all the studios producing movies
these days are public companies answerable to shareholders.
However, most of the major players in Hollywood would vehemently
disagree with me. They argue that until such time when the studios
start basing ticket prices on a movies budget, then the public
doesnt need to know. 

<P>

&quot;When a 'Waterworld' ticket costs $60 like `Phantom of the
Opera, <I>then</I> you can start to bitch. But until that happens,
'Waterworld' will be priced like any other film. Seven bucks and
some change. A screamin deal,&quot; asserted David Twohy, the
writer on &quot;Waterworld&quot; as well as &quot;The
Fugitive,&quot; &quot;Aliens III,&quot; &quot;Warlock&quot; and
&quot;Terminal Velocity.&quot; In fact, Twohy was so upset about
all the ranting and raving about the ballooning cost of
&quot;Waterworld&quot; before it opened--perhaps as much as $200
million due to a myriad problems on the set--he took out a full
page in <I>Daily Variety</I> and printed &quot;An Open Letter to the
Industry.&quot; 

&quot;I want to tell you about a strange thing that happened the
other day,&quot; he wrote. &quot;A film producer was peppering me
with 'Waterworld' anecdotes. These were the horror stories weve all
heard--whole cities being built on water, hurricane delays, lobster
dinners being flown in, and so on. But the real horror was this:
After a 10 non-stop minutes, the producer pauses and asks me, 'So
whats it about, anyway?' He knew the last-minute news about the
production woes, yet he didnt know the first thing about the story
... If youve been out of the country, call up your grandmother in
Rhode Island. Shell give you the running [money] total,&quot; Twohy
claimed. Then he told the Industry to &quot;stop gnawing on the
hand that feeds you&quot; and &quot;just shut the hell up.&quot;

<P>

One of the most popular parlor games played in Hollywood is
guessing the cost of a movie currently in production. Studio
executives tear their hair out when a pictures costs go out of
control. Because the more money thats spent on one movie means
less money in the overall budget to spend on other films. Its also
something that drives big-name stars crazy, especially those actors
who earn big fees. Arnold Schwarzenegger once told me from the set
of &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; that it &quot;really is insane when
people add $10 million to the last figure they heard about what a
movie costs. And it just keeps going up from there.&quot; That
movie, for a time, was the subject of more budget controversy than
any picture previously. The wildest rumors alleged that Heidi
Fleiss hookers had been billed into the budget (false), to
published reports that editors toiling overtime to get the film
ready for theaters were getting on-the-job neck and shoulder
massages (true). 

<P>

This obsession with a movies budget is not really anything new.
David O. Selznick wrestled with it during the making of &quot;Gone
With the Wind&quot;--then laughed all the way to the bank when the
movie was a solid hit. The same thing happened with
&quot;Cleopatra&quot; when word got out that Elizabeth Taylor
received an unprecedented $1 million payday, plus jewelry and
first-dollar gross. The movie wound up becoming the most expensive
bomb then ever made. And &quot;Superman&quot; cost a bundle because
the films producers had to make it believable that a man could
fly. Same with &quot;Terminator 2&quot; where director Jim Camerons
incredible special effects had characters realistically morphing
and melting right before audience eyes. 

<P>

Hollywood marketing executives are convinced that just hearing what
unprecedented amount a movie costs can create doubt among the public
about the film ahead of its release. What happens is the public
begins to wonder: Is it costing so much money because its got
something thats never been done before? Or because its got a lot of
mistakes? On the one hand, you can create a lot of curiosity. On the
other, you can create a negative perception before anybody sees
anything.

</CENTER>

 <P>

<B>Nikki Finke</B> has covered Hollywood business and lifestyles for
the <I>Los Angeles Times</I>, <I>Newsweek</I>, <I>Vanity Fair</I>,
<I>Details</I>, <I>Harper's Bazaar</I>, <I>US</I>, <I>Allure</I>,
<I>Mademoiselle</I>, <I>Esquire</I>, <I>Working Woman</I> and
<I>Los Angeles Magazine</I>. She also has appeared as an
entertainment business expert on <I>CNN Showbiz Today</I>, <I>CBS
This Morning</I>, <I>Entertainment Tonight</I> and other shows.
Currently, she is West Coast Editor for Newsweek's <I>Virtual City
Magazine</I>, Special Correspondent and Hollywood columnist for
<I>Buzz Magazine</I>, Hollywood correspondent for <I>The New York
Observer</I> and the author of a forthcoming non- fiction
investigative book, <I>Pay or Play: The Rise and Rise of the New
Hollywood Agent</I> (Dial Press/Bantam Doubleday Dell). <I>Daily
Variety</I> has described <I>Pay or Play</I> as one of the most
"anticipated and feared" books about Hollywood.
<P> 
After growing up in New York and graduating from Wellesley College,
Finke went to work for Associated Press and became one of only a
handful of female foreign correspondents. By age 24, she was
reporting for AP from Moscow, where she made world headlines with her
coverage of the Shcharansky dissident trial and SALT negotiations.
She was then named AP correspondent in London.
<P>
Finke joined <I>Newsweek</I> as a staff correspondent in Washington
D.C. where she became the magazine's expert on urban affairs and
social issues.  She also contributed to <I>Newsweek's</I> coverage
of the Grenada invasion with her reporting from Havana, Cuba.  She
also was part of <I>Newsweek's</I> 1984 U.S. presidential campaign
team and instrumental in cover stories on major business
personalities, including then Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker
and the Texas billionaire Bass brothers who had taken over Walt
Disney Co.

<P>
 
After transferring to <I>Newsweek's</I> Los Angeles bureau, she
became a staff writer for the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> in 1987. For
the next four years, she regularly contributed major profile or
investigative pieces about national, Los Angeles, and entertainment
news and personalities.  Meanwhile, Finke began articles about
Hollywood for major magazines. Ten years after her first reporting
from Moscow, the <I>L.A. Times</I> returned Finke to the Soviet
Union in 1988 to cover the Reagan-Gorbachev summit and the changes
in that country due to glasnost and perestroika.  She also was
singled out for journalism honors in 1987 and again in 1988 for two
investigative articles. She also taught journalism at UCLA's
Extension Program. 

<P>

In 1990, Finke signed the contract for <I>Pay or Play</I> and took a
book leave from the <I>Los Angeles Times</I>. For the next years,
she interviewed some 600 members of Hollywood's entertainment
industry. She has contributed investigative articles to <I>Vanity Fair</I>
magazine, including a major piece about the relationship of New
York's garment industry with the Mafia and another on comedian Bill
Cosby's effort to gain financial control NBC. She
obtained the first exclusive interview with alleged Hollywood madam
Heidi Fleiss for <I>Details</I> magazine that looked at the
entertainment industry's underworld of sex and drugs. 
<I>Entertainment Weekly</I> asked Finke to serve as a senior
editor/consultant.

<P>
 
Presently, most of Finke's time is being spent putting the finishing
touches on her book and contributing articles to magazines and
newspapers.  Divorced, she loves going to the movies, eating in her
favorite restaurant, Patina, and suntanning in Palm Springs.

</CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

 Like the big news shows on public radio, the mission of <B><I>This
American Life</I></B>  is to document and describe life in these United States.
But it uses a much wider range of contributors and storytelling styles than
the news shows use.  And it's a lot looser.  It's the sound of live radio,
adapted to do the heavy lifting of hardcore documentary production.
<P>
The program is hosted by veteran National Public Radio reporter and
producer <A HREF = "tamglass.html">Ira Glass</A>.  Glass is best known for his documentary stories on
Chicago public schools which aired on NPR's <B><I>All Things Considered</B></I> and
 <B><I>Morning Edition</B></I> from 1990 through 1995.

<p> Each week, <I><B>This American Life</B></I> chooses a theme - immigrant
parents, animals, people who lead double lives.  Glass does a story or two.
And he  invites a variety of writers and performers to take a whack at the
theme, with stories, monologues, short radio plays, miniature
documentaries, "found recordings" and original works for radio.

<P>        
To do a story about the large number of temporary workers in the
economy now, the producers simply <B>hired</B> two temps, young men who normally
do manual labor, and had them prepare stories about their jobs.  For a show
about poultry, radio legend Dick Orkin created a new episode of his beloved
"Chickenman" radio serial, the first full episode created in three decades.
<P>
    
 A show about high school plays included a documentary about a
suburban school putting on a production of Neil Simon's "Lost in Yonkers,"
and a long comic memoir from David Sedaris about getting the "drama bug"
when he was in high school.  As a teenager, mesmerized by the sound of
Shakespeare, Sedaris resolved to re-introduce Elizabethan English to daily
life in Raleigh, North Carolina.   It didn't catch on.

<P>       
In fact, David Sedaris, one of the most popular commentators on
NPR's <I><B>Morning Edition</B></I> and author of the book <B><I>Barrel Fever</I></B>, is a regular
contributor to <I><B>This American Life</B></I>.

<P>        
"The longest David's work can run on NPR is eight minutes," says
Glass.  "So for years, he's had these great stories that need twenty
minutes, or thirty, and there's been no national program that can
accomodate them.  That's one of the ideas behind this new show.  To create
a home for these longer stories which now have no place in the public radio
system."

<P>        
In his work on NPR, and on the local show on WBEZ he co-hosted for
five years, Glass has shown an unusual knack for finding writers and
performers whose work hasn't been heard on radio, but should be, and
producing them in a way that charms radio audiences.  From the first day he
put David Sedaris onto NPR's Morning Edition, (telling the story of working
as an elf at Macy's Department Store at Christmas), Sedaris generated more
listener response than any story in years.
<P>
<I><B>This American Life</B></I> airs on KCRW (89.9 FM), at 6:00 Saturday
nights, and on WBEZ in Chicago, at 7:00 Friday and Saturday nights (on 91.5
FM).  The program premiered locally on November 17th, 1995 on WBEZ.  KCRW
is the second station to run the show.  Other public radio stations will be
offered the program starting in June 1996.
<P>
<I><B>This American Life</B></I> is produced by WBEZ Chicago, with major
funding from the John D and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the National
Endowment for the Arts, the Elizabeth F. Cheney Foundation and the
listeners of WBEZ Chicago.

<P>
<I><B>This American Life's</B></I> host Ira Glass answers all email!  Send it
to <A HREF = "mailto: radio@well.com">radio@well.com</A>  Don't be alarmed if it takes him a couple days to
respond.  If you have "found tapes" you think might be suitable for the
show (see the rundown of the Accidental Documentaries show if you want an
idea of what kind of tapes this might mean) email the show with some info!
Extremely modest, public-radio-sized, "honorarium"-type cash rewards
offered for suitable tapes.
<p>
Cassettes of any episode of <I><B>This American Life</B></I> are $10.  Email
the staff with your name, something that'll indicate which show you want,
and a phone number.  A trained public radio employee will call you and ask
you for that pesky credit card number information which shouldn't be sent
over email.  Or you can send a check to This American Life/WBEZ/848 E.
Grand Avenue/Chicago, IL 60611.

</CENTER>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Ira Glass is the host and producer of WBEZ's new national program,
<B><I>This American Life</B></I>.  The program premiered locally in Chicago on November
17th, 1995, started on KCRW in April, and will launch nationally in June of
1996.

<P>Glass has worked for National Public Radio for 18 years, starting
when he was 19 years old.  At one point or another, he has worked on nearly
every NPR network news program, and done virtually every production job in
NPR's Washington headquarters.  He has been a tape cutter, newscast writer,
desk assistant, editor and producer.  He has filled in as host of <B><I>Talk of
the Nation</B></I> and <B><I>Weekend All Things Considered</B></I>.  He produced the pilots
and helped design the format of the late-night program <B><I>Heat with John
Hockenberry</B></I>.

<P>
From 1989 until 1995, Ira Glass was a reporter in National Public
Radio's Chicago Bureau.  For two years, he covered Chicago school reform
for NPR's <B><I>All Things Considered</B></I>, with two unusual series of reports.
The first followed Taft High School for an entire school year.  The second
followed Washington Irving Elementary for a year.  School restructuring at
Taft went poorly; at Irving it went well.

<p>
His education reporting began in 1990, when he spent two months at
Chicago's Lincoln Park High School, for a series about race relations at
one urban school.  He returned to Lincoln Park two years later, to see
which of the sophomores he had followed so closely had graduated and which
had dropped out, and why, in a second series.

<P>His education reporting has won several awards:  in 1991 from the
National Education Association; in 1992 and 1994 from the Education Writers
Association.  In 1994 and 1995, Glass was invited to speak at the Harvard
Graduate School of Education.  In 1995, he was the only journalist invited
to contribute to a book on education policy put out by the National
Governors Association.

<P>In 1988, Glass was named as one of a handful of "Young Journalists
of the Year" by the Livingston Foundation.  In 1991, he and NPR's South
Africa correspondent John Matisonn were awarded by the National Association
of Black Journalists, for their four-part series comparing race relations
in South Africa with those in the United States.

<P>During the 1992 Presidential Campaign, he travelled with the
Clinton campaign, and in January 1993, he anchored NPR's live broadcast of
the Clinton Inauguration.

<P>From 1990 until the summer of 1995, he co-hosted a weekly, local
program on WBEZ called <B><I>The Wild Room</B></I>, a show which defies easy
description.

<P>Glass graduated from Brown University in January 1982 with honors,
in Semiotics.

<P>This WWW server is maintained by Jim Milles, Head of Computer Services and Associate
Professor of Legal Research at Saint Louis University School of Law Library.

<P>I am Chair of the Computing Services (formerly Automation and Scientific Development) Special Interest Section of the American Association of Law Libraries, and a Past Chair of the Social Responsibilities SIS.  In addition, I am listowner and moderator of NETTRAIN@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu, the discussion list for Internet trainers, as well as several other specialized discussion lists.  I've written a couple of useful Internet help materials: <A HREF="ftp://lawlib.slu.edu/interlaw.txt">"An Introduction to Using the Internet at Saint Louis University School of Law"</A> (also available in <A HREF="ftp://lawlib.slu.edu/interlaw.exe">WordPerfect 6.0</A> and <A HREF="ftp://lawlib.slu.edu/interlaw.ps">PostScript</A> formats), and <A
HREF="http://lawlib.slu.edu/training/mailser.htm">"Discussion Lists: Mailing List Manager Commands,"</A> a guide to basic commands for the most popular mailing list software packages: listproc, LISTSERV, mailbase, mailserv, and majordomo.  (If you're interested, see my exhaustive <A HREF="http://lawlib.slu.edu/resume.htm">resume</A> for more information.)

<P>In November and December 1995 I spent a month in the southern African country of <A HREF="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/African_Studies/Country_Specific/Lesotho.html">Lesotho</A> as a consultant to the Lesotho Privatisation and Private Sector Development Project.  My part of the project consisted of designing sustainable methods for the publication and dissemination of primary legal information sources (statutes and law reports) and advising on the automation and improvement of the government registries.  I also spent a bit of time in <A HREF="http://www.is.co.za/www-za/">South Africa</A>, particularly <A HREF="http://www.pix.za/business/bloemfontein/bloemftn.html">Bloemfontein</A> and <A HREF="http://africa.com/docs/travel/wctb.htm">Cape Town</A>.

<P>I live in South <A HREF="http://www.inlink.com/~jbhicks/stlguide.html">St. Louis</A> with <A HREF="http://lawlib.slu.edu/eberly.gif">Eberly Milles</A> and our cats Christopher (pictured above) and <A HREF="http://lawlib.slu.edu/william.gif">William.</A>  When I'm not working, I enjoy reading <A HREF="http://users.aol.com/bchrcon97/mysteris.htm">detective and mystery novels</A> (right now I'm reading everything by <A HREF="http://studbimb.tuwien.ac.at/~e9225468/hiaasen.html">Carl Hiaasen</A>).  My favorite TV show?  <A HREF="http://www.cybersuperstores.com/wishbone/wishbone.html">Wishbone!</A>  I also enjoy listening to a wide variety of music.  My current favorites: <A HREF="http://www.nauticom.net/www/express/ashley.htm">Ashley Cleveland</A>, <a href="http://www.versa.com/ely/">Joe Ely</a>, <a href="http://www.unicom.com/john-hiatt/">John Hiatt</a>, <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/4591/kirsty.htm">Kirsty MacColl</A>, <a href="http://www.mel.dit.csiro.au/~sfy/RT/">Richard Thompson</a>, <A HREF="http://www.panix.com/~tneff/dar/index.html">Dar Williams</A>, and my all-time favorite, <A HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu:80/users/rager/Story/">Jonatha Brooke and The Story</A>.  I'm also trying to learn to play the <A HREF="http://www.tns.lcs.mit.edu/harp/harp.html">Celtic harp</A>.  My favorite harpers are <A HREF="http://www.access.digex.net/~carolyns/egbios.htm#richards">Sue Richards</A>, who also plays with Ceoltoiri and <A HREF="http://www.access.digex.net/~carolyns/">Ensemble Galilei</A>, and Patsy Seddon and Mary McMaster, also known as <A HREF="http://www.fb15.uni-dortmund.de/voelker/poozies/sileas.html">Sileas</A> and as half of <A HREF="http://www.fb15.uni-dortmund.de/voelker/poozies/poozies.html">The Poozies</A>.

<html><head><title>Where to Start: Recommended Books</title>
<link rev="made" href="millesjg@sluvca.slu.edu"></head>
<body>

<H2>2.  Some recommended books for new users of the Internet:</H2>

Aboba, Bernard.  <I>The Online User's Encyclopedia: Bulletin Boards 
and Beyond.</I>  Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1994.  806 pp.  ISBN 
0-201-62214-9, US$32.95.  (A remarkably useful and comprehensive 
work, covering everything from the basics of computer 
communications, to using local bulletin boards, to the 
intricacies of the Internet.) 

<P>Dern, Daniel P.  <I>The Internet Guide for New Users.</I>  New York: 
McGraw-Hill, 1994.  570 pp.  ISBN 0-07-016510-6, US$40.00 
(hardcover); ISBN 0-07-016511-4, US$27.95 (paper).  (Dern is the 
former editor of <I>Internet World</I> magazine and author of numerous 
articles on the Internet in many other publications.) 

<P>Engst, Adam.  <I>Internet Starter Kit for Macintosh.</I>  
Indianapolis: Hayden Press, 1993.  641 pp.  ISBN 1-56830-064-6, 
US$19.95.  (Highly recommended by Mac users, many of whom 
preferred this to the Fraase book listed below.  Comes with a 
disk containing a variety of Internet access software, including 
a "legal copy of MacTCP 2.0.2.") 

<P>Gilster, Paul.  <I>The Internet Navigator.</I>  New York: John 
Wiley, 1993.  470 pp.  ISBN 0-471-59782-1, US$24.95.  (An 
elegantly written and cleanly designed guidebook, the best of the 
new books for the individual dial-up user.  Contains a wealth of 
useful background information on the workings of the Internet and 
the organizations behind it.  Recommended for the individual 
dial-up user who is serious about the Internet.) 

<P>Hahn, Harley & Rick Stout.  <I>The Internet Complete 
Reference.</I>  Berkeley: Osborne McGraw-Hill, 1993.  818 pp.  
ISBN 0-07-881980-6, US$29.95.  (Considered by many the best of 
the new crop of Internet books, and at 800+ pages, among the most 
comprehensive.  The humor, however, seems somewhat more lame than 
some others.) 

<P>Krol, Ed.  <I>The Whole Internet: User's Guide & Catalog.</I>  
2nd ed.  Sebastapol, CA: O'Reilly & Associates, 1994.  543 pp.  
ISBN 1-56592-063-5, US$24.95.  (In the fast-moving world of the 
Internet, for most of 1993 this was the successor to <I>Zen</I> 
as the essential guide to the Internet, and is still regarded by 
many as the best of the Internet books.  However, the 
availability of other books like Gilster's makes Krol's Unix bias 
more evident.  Recommended especially for users of Unix systems.) 

<P>LaQuey, Tracy.  <I>The Internet Companion Plus: A Beginner's 
Start-Up Kit for Global Networking.</I>  Reading, MA: Addison-
Wesley, 1993.  196 pp.  ISBN 0-201-62719-1, US$19.95.  (A good 
guide for the true beginner, useful even for the pre-beginner who

    <p>E-mail discussion lists constitute one of the most popular methods of group communication  on the Internet.  Discussion lists support group communication by providing, at minimum, two basic functions: (1) the ability to distribute a message to a group of people by sending it to a single, central address, and (2) the ability to quietly join and leave the list at any time.
    <p>In order to provide these separate functions, an e-mail discussion list typically has two addresses associated with it: (1) a "listname address," the address to which you send any messages that you intend to be read by the list subscribers; and (2) an "administrative address," the address to which you send any commands or requests that affect your subscription to the list. It's easy to remember this distinction by thinking of your local newspaper: the first address is somewhat analogous to sending a "letter to the editor,"  while the second is like sending a letter to the newspaper's subscription office.
    <p>With most discussion lists, the "administrative address" is a computer program called a "mailing list manager" or MLM.  The MLM allows the subscriber to subscribe and unsubscribe automatically, without external intervention.  There are at least five popular mailing list manager programs used to manage most Internet discussion lists: REVISED LISTSERV (formerly called BITNET LISTSERV), Unix ListProcessor (or Listproc), Mailbase, Mailserv, and Majordomo.  The commands for subscribing and unsubscribing under most of these programs are the same; however, other useful commands differ greatly from one program to another, and some programs support features that others do not.

<td valign=top><B><A NAME="about">About This Document</A></B>
<td>
    <p>This document does not describe all the features supported by any of these programs, only those most commonly used.  For more information on any of these programs, send a message containing only the word "help" to the appropriate mail server.  Additional programs and commands will be added in future revisions of this document.
    <p>This document also does not deal with discussion lists to which one subscribes by sending a message to "[listname]-request," sometimes referred to as "Internet lists."  There are a great many discussion lists of this type; some are distribution lists maintained manually by the listowner, while others use some form of mailing list manager software ranging from a simple script to a fairly sophisticated mailing list program.  Some require that subscription requests be placed in the message text; others require them to be included in the Subject: line.  Because of the variety of methods of maintaining these lists, it is impossible to generalize about their command features. However, as a rule, assume that any discussion list with an administrative address of "[listname]-request" is maintained manually by a human being.  Accordingly, you should subscribe by sending a friendly message in plain English to "[listname]-request."  If a program responds with instructions for subscribing, follow the instructions.
    <p>The latest version of this document is available by e-mail and by anonymous ftp, as well as on the World Wide Web:
    <pre>
E-mail:   Send a message containing only the line
          <b>GET MAILSER CMD NETTRAIN</b>
          to LISTSERV@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu.

FTP:      anonymous ftp to lawlib.slu.edu
          get mailser.cmd

Web:      http://lawlib.slu.edu/training/mailser.htm
    </pre>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign=top><A NAME="which"><B>Which MLM?</B></A></td>
<td>
    <p>When you subscribe to a list, you will typically receive a "welcome" message, describing the purpose of the list and telling you how to unsubscribe.  <b>Save this message!</b>  It tells you which program the discussion list is run under, and how to get further help.
    <p>Mailing list managers can be confusing.  Many people use the term "listserv" generically, to refer to any list mail server program.  To make things worse, the Unix ListProcessor (listproc) program was originally called "listserv," just like REVISED LISTSERV.  Many listproc hosts are still configured with the name "listserv," and will accept commands addressed to "listserv@[host]" as well as to the correct name, "listproc@[host]."
    <p>Usually--but not always--you can find out which program a discussion list is run under by examining the message headers.  For instance, listproc lists should include a line saying "Unix ListProcessor."  However, the best practice is to save any "welcome" message you receive when you subscribe, and to note at that time which set of commands is applicable.

<td valign=top><B><A NAME="sending">Sending commands to the MLM</A></B></td>
<td>
    <p>Remember to send all commands to the "administrative address"--[mailserver]@[host]--not to the "listname address".  [Mailserver] is the program that maintains the list (either listproc, LISTSERV, mailbase, mailserv, or majordomo); [host] is the address of the host computer (for example, ucdavis.edu or cleo.murdoch.edu.au).
    <p>Be sure to leave the Subject: line blank, and to delete any signature file if your mailer allows you to do so.
    <p> Always include the name of the list in the message to [mailserver]@[host].  Most mailserver sites maintain many different discussion lists, and it is essential that you tell the mail server which list you are talking about.
    <p>For instance, to join the discussion list <b>law-lib@ucdavis.edu</b>, send an e-mail message containing only the command
<pre>
    <b>SUBSCRIBE LAW-LIB John Doe</b>
</pre>
    to listproc@ucdavis.edu.
<br>The other examples used below are:
<br><b>INT-LAW@UMINN1.BITNET</b> (REVISED LISTSERV), <b>law-europe@mailbase.ac.uk</b>
(Mailbase), <b>envirolaw@oregon.uoregon.edu</b> (Mailserv),and <b>elaw-j@cleo.murdoch.edu.au</b>
(Majordomo).

   <td>LISTSERV has a sophisticated and powerful search engine that does lots of neat things such as finding "sounds like" matches; however, it uses a difficult, batch-coded search language to construct queries.  I find it useful to keep a "template" file in my Internet account, and then edit the file as appropriate when I need to do a search.  Here's the search file:
    <pre>
    //  JOB  Echo=No
    Database Search DD=Rules
    //Rules DD   *
    Search nafta in int-law since 93/6/1

    To run a search, send this file in an e-mail message to LISTSERV@[host].  The <b>Search</b>line can be modified as needed.  The date is optional; Boolean combinations, nesting with parentheses, and a great number of other capabilities are supported.  For a full description of LISTSERV search functions, send the command<br>
   <b>GET LISTDB MEMO F=MAIL</b><br>

<HR>

<P>To make use of all of the resources of the World-Wide Web, you can choose from a variety of comprehensive hierarchical directories and searchable indexes of Internet resources. Here are some of the better Internet search tools. (The <IMG SRC="star.gif" ALT="[Star!]" HEIGHT=18 WIDTH=20> next to an entry indicates a recommended site--one that I turn to regularly. <IMG SRC="star.gif" ALT="[Star!]" HEIGHT=18 WIDTH=20><IMG SRC="star.gif" ALT="[Star!]" HEIGHT=18 WIDTH=20> indicates particular favorites.)

<HR>

<DL>

  <DT><A NAME="dir"><H2>Directories</A></H2>
  <DD>These directories are extensive lists of Internet resources arranged by human editors into subject categories. Some include reviews; all are selective, and attempt to point the user to what the editors view as the best resources on the Internet. These directories may offer a good place to start if you're looking for collections of material on a particular topic.

  <UL>

  <LI><A HREF="http://a2z.lycos.com/">A2Z</A> &lt;http://a2z.lycos.com/&gt;, a directory of the "most popular" sites on the Web - "the one-tenth of Web sites most linked-to by users like you."

  <li><IMG SRC="star.gif" ALT="[Star!]" HEIGHT=18 WIDTH=20><a href="http://www.looksmart.com/">LookSmart</a> &lt;http://www.looksmart.com/&gt;, a selective directory of over 146,000 useful sites, with an attractive graphical interface.  (Note: The SLU "<a href="http://lawlib.slu.edu/centers/hlthlaw/hlthlaw.htm">Center for Health Law Studies</a>" is a "LookSmart Editors Choice.")

  <LI><A HREF="http://www.mckinley.com/">Magellan</A> &lt;http://www.mckinley.com/&gt;,
a database of over 1.5 million Internet sites. Many are reviewed and rated for depth, ease of use, and "net appeal"; also identifies sites "that, at the time of review, contained no content apparently intended for mature audiences."

  <LI>The World Wide Web Virtual Library, the &quot;official&quot; directory of WWW resources. Includes directories for scores of subject areas, each maintained by interested volunteers.

    <UL>
    <LI><A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html">By Subject</A> &lt;http://www.w3.org/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html&gt;
    <LI><A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/DataSources/WWW/Servers.html">Geographical Arrangement</A> &lt;http://www.w3.org/hypertext/DataSources/WWW/Servers.html&gt;
    </UL>

<LI><IMG SRC="star.gif" ALT="[Star!]" HEIGHT=18 WIDTH=20><IMG SRC="star.gif" ALT="[Star!]" HEIGHT=18 WIDTH=20><A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</A> &lt;http://www.yahoo.com/&gt;. The definitive, most comprehensive hierarchically arranged directory to Web resources.  An excellent starting point when you're looking for information on a broad topic; the categories help you narrow down your search.

</UL>

  <DT><A NAME="idx"><H2>Indexes</H2></A>
  <DD>The following indexes are generated automatically by computer programs called "robots" or "webcrawlers." Each claims to be the largest and best index of Internet resources, but differences in methods of counting and lack of information on how indexing is done make these claims difficult to verify. Full-text searching gives the user the ability to find virtually anything on the most obscure topics; however, most indexes also yield many "false hits," or irrelevant items that must be sorted through by the user.

  <UL>

  <LI><IMG SRC="star.gif" ALT="[Star!]" HEIGHT=18 WIDTH=20><IMG SRC="star.gif" ALT="[Star!]" HEIGHT=18 WIDTH=20><A HREF="http://altavista.digital.com/">Alta Vista</A> &lt;http://altavista.digital.com/&gt;. Probably the largest and fastest web index, this is the one I turn to first for most searches.  It also offers advanced search options such as full Boolean searching and user-customizable control over the weighting of search terms.

  <LI><IMG SRC="star.gif" ALT="[Star!]" HEIGHT=18 WIDTH=20><A HREF="http://www.excite.com/">excite</A> &lt;http://www.excite.com/&gt;, a comprehensive index of over 50 million web pages, with reviews of over 61,000 sites. Excite uses a sophisticated "concept-based" searching technique:
  <blockquote>"Excite's search engine uses something called ICE (intelligent concept  extraction) to learn about the content of the web. This means that as Excite indexes pages, it learns what words are related to other words. This is not a simple thesaurus. As new words or ideas come onto the web, Excite learns about them and their relationship to existing words as well. Excite then uses this to aid in your search. So when you search for "dog care", Excite knows that "pet grooming" is a related topic and finds pages about this as well, even if the words "dog" and "care" are not actually on the page! Excite is the only search engine to do this."</blockquote>
  <P>Excite also uses a very powerful information retrieval technique known as "relevance feedback": when you find a particularly useful site, click on the "More like this" link to use the contents of that site as the query for a new search.

  <LI><IMG SRC="star.gif" ALT="[Star!]" HEIGHT=18 WIDTH=20><A HREF="http://www.hotbot.com/">HotBot</A> &lt;http://www.hotbot.com/&gt; is a powerful and fast index based on the Inktomi search engine, with an easy-to-use interface but including a variety of enhanced search features in "Expert" mode.  HotBot also offers the user the ability to customize and save search options.

  <LI><IMG SRC="star.gif" ALT="[Star!]" HEIGHT=18 WIDTH=20><A HREF="http://www.infoseek.com/">InfoSeek</A> &lt;http://www.infoseek.com/&gt; is comprehensive and fast.  In addition to simple keyword searching, it also offers the option to broaden your research through additional links in the form of "Related Topics" and "Company Profiles."

  <LI><IMG SRC="star.gif" ALT="[Star!]" HEIGHT=18 WIDTH=20><A HREF="http://www.lycos.com/">Lycos</A> &lt;http://www.lycos.com/&gt; is distinquished from the other indexes by its range of added directory features, such as: the <A HREF="http://a2z.lycos.com/">a2z Directory of Sites by Subject</A> &lt;http://a2z.lycos.com/&gt;, a listing of the "one-tenth of Web sites most linked-to by users"; <a href="http://cityguide.lycos.com/">City Guide</a> &lt;http://cityguide.lycos.com/&gt;; <a href="http://www.lycos.com/pplfndr.html">People Find</a> &lt;http://www.lycos.com/pplfndr.html&gt;; a separate index of <a href="http://www.lycos.com/lycosmedia.html">pictures and sounds</a>; and <A HREF="http://point.lycos.com/">Pointreview</A> &lt;http://www.pointcom.com/&gt;, featuring daily and weekly website reviews.

  <LI><A HREF="http://www.opentext.com/omw/f-omw.html">Open Text</A> &lt;http://www.opentext.com/omw/f-omw.html&gt; offers a simple search method as well as a powerful search interface using full Boolean search functions (AND, OR, BUT NOT, NEAR).  However, the database is small and incomplete; not recommended.

  <LI><A HREF="http://webcrawler.com/">WebCrawler</A> &lt;http://webcrawler.com/&gt; is a  small and selective database combined with a <a href="http://www.mckinley.com/">Magellan</a>-like directory of categories. WebCrawler supports both full Boolean searching (including proximity connectors) and natural language searching. When using the "Show summaries" feature, WebCrawler also offers a "similar pages" (relevance feedback) option. </LI>

  <LI><b>Several services allow users to search multiple indexes simultaneously.</b>

    <UL>

    <LI><a href="http://www.cyber411.com/search/">Cyber411</a> &lt;http://www.cyber411.com/search/&gt;, which currently searches fifteen different Internet search engines.

    <LI><A HREF="http://www.intbc.com/sleuth/">The Internet Sleuth</A> &lt;http://www.intbc.com/sleuth/&gt; is an "index of indexes," with descriptions of and links to over 1,500 separate databases on the Internet. The databases included range from comprehensive indexes like Yahoo to the text of individual literary works such as Milton's <A HREF="gopher://ccat.sas.upenn.edu:3333/77/.index/ParadiseLost/indx">Paradise Lost</A> &lt;gopher://ccat.sas.upenn.edu:3333/77/.index/ParadiseLost/indx&gt;.

MetaCrawler also performs site verification--checking each link to confirm that it is accessible.  This takes a few minutes longer, but the time saved in avoiding dead ends
is well worth the wait.

    <LI><A HREF="http://www.designlab.ukans.edu/profusion/">ProFusion</A> &lt;http://www.designlab.ukans.edu/profusion/&gt; offers six of the major Web indexes, and allows the user to select which of the six to search.  Like MetaCrawler, there is an option to check for broken links.

    <LI><IMG SRC="star.gif" ALT="[Star!]" HEIGHT=18 WIDTH=20><A HREF="http://savvy.cs.colostate.edu:2000/">SavvySearch</A> &lt;http://savvy.cs.colostate.edu:2000/&gt; currently searches over 19 different Internet indexes, including specialized databases such as <A  HREF="http://www.msstate.edu/Movies/">The Internet Movie Database</A> &lt;http://www.msstate.edu/Movies/&gt; and the <A HREF="http://www.shareware.com/">Virtual Software Library</A> &lt;http://www.shareware.com/&gt; as well as the usual general indexes from Altavista to Yahoo. SavvySearch also gives you the choice of displaying the results of each database individually or integrating them into a single display.

    <LI><A HREF="http://www.search.com/">Search.Com</A> &lt;http://www.search.com/&gt; is an "index of indexes," providing links to over 250 separate Internet databases, from general indexes such as Altavista and Yahoo to specialized databases like the <A HREF="http://www.dealernet.com/">DealerNet New Car Directory</A> &lt;http://www.dealernet.com/&gt;.

<DD>Here are tools for searching for e-mail addresses. Note, however, that none of these tools is complete; many institutions do not make their e-mail directories public. In addition, when you find somebody's e-mail address, you have no guarantee that he or she actually uses e-mail. The most reliable way to find someone's e-mail address is still to ask him or her.

<TITLE>Admission Procedures</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<HR>
<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Admission Procedures</H1>
<HR>

<P>All applicants must be registered for both the Law School
Admissions Test (LSAT) and the Law School Data Assembly Service
(LSDAS). No application is complete without test scores and
transcript analysis from LSAT/LSDAS. It is highly recommended that
students take the test in the summer or fall before they wish to
enter law school. All undergraduate and graduate transcripts must
be forwarded directly to LSDAS. The School of Law requests the
LSDAS report upon receipt of the application.

<P>An applicant's file is complete when the School has received:

<UL>
<LI>A completed Saint Louis University School of Law Application
<LI>Two letters of recommendation
<LI>$40 application fee
<LI>Written personal statement (optional, but strongly recommended)
</UL>

<P>The personal statement may contain information about any special
factors, achievements, problems, plans or explanations which the
student believes should be brought to the attention of the
Admissions Committee. The personal statement may also serve to
explain any discrepancies between an applicant's undergraduate
grade point average and LSAT score. Whatever the content, the
statement should reflect the student's own writing style. Attention
is given to brevity and clarity of thought and expression.

<P>The Committee is composed of the Assistant Dean for
Admissions, four faculty members, the Assistant Director of Admissions, and
three law students. With the exception of those applicants whose index (a
combination of LSAT and GPA) falls in a clearly defined  upper or lower
percentile and whose application is reviewed by the  Assistant Dean and the
faculty Committee Chair, the Committee reviews   the entire application of
each applicant, after which it meets to   discuss each application.  No action
is taken without the consensus of  the Committee.

<P>The School of Law recommends an undergraduate academic program with
rigor and writing experience, including courses that will be helpful in training students to think in an analytical and logical manner.

<P>If practical, letters of recommendation from college instructors
who are familiar with a student's work are most helpful. For those
students who have been away from the classroom for a number of
years, recommendations from employers, supervisors, and associates
are welcome.

<P>Factors considered by the Committee in addition to the GPA and LSAT
score are strength of the undergraduate program, any graduate degrees
earned, work experience, any extraordinary circumstances which may  have
affected a student's performance in college, and motivation. The median GPA
and LSAT for those admitted to the Fall 1996 class were 3.3  and 155,
respectively. This LSAT score represents the 67th percentile.
Over 1140 applications were received for the entering class, which  includes
approximately 200 applications for the part-time program.  There are 175
spaces available for full-time students and 75 spaces available for part-time
students in the fall entering class. Approximately 450-500 offers of admission
are made for the full-time program and 100 for the part-time program.  A
statistical profile for the last four admitted classes is available on request.

<P>Reapplicants (those candidates who have previously filed an
application for admission) must follow the same procedures and
meet the same requirements as first-time applicants.

<P>The School of Law is committed to increasing the number of
minorities in the legal profession. Accordingly, the School of Law
actively seeks applications from qualified minorities.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Transfer Students</H2>

<P>A limited number of transfer students are admitted each year in the
fall, spring, or summer semesters. In addition to satisfying the
entrance requirements for first-year students, they must produce
evidence of superior study in an ABA-approved law school and be
eligible to continue at the school from which transfer is
sought. Competition for admission to the upper division is strong,
and first consideration is given to those applicants presenting
superior credentials.

<P>In addition to the requirements listed on the previous page (a copy of  the
LSDAS Report forwarded by the current law school is acceptable),
transfer applicants must submit the following:

<OL>
<LI>A letter of recommendation from a law school professor.
<LI>A letter from the Dean or appropriate law school official
certifying that the student is "in good standing and eligible to
return."
<LI>An official transcript of all law school work, including class
rank where available. (An unofficial transcript will suffice when
the official transcript is unavailable at the time of application.
Please note that a decision made on the basis of an unofficial
transcript is contingent on receipt of the official transcript as
soon as it is available.) The amount of credit which will be
applied toward the J.D. degree at Saint Louis University School of
Law will depend on the content of the completed courses and the
grade received in those courses.
</OL>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Visiting Students</H2>

<P>The School of Law grants visiting status to a limited number of
students who wish to complete a semester or a year of law study at
Saint Louis University and receive their degree from another law
school. An applicant for visiting status must submit a letter of
application and a statement from the Dean of the degree-granting
law school stating that the student is in good standing and has
permission to take courses at Saint Louis University School of Law,
an official transcript of all law school work, statement of class
rank, and a copy of the LSDAS report.


<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">The Summer Institute</H2>

<P>The faculty of the School of Law recognizes that there can be
discrepancies between predicted and actual success. Because of
this, and because the faculty believes that a diverse group of
individuals is important in both the student population and the
legal profession, a special admissions program is conducted each
summer at the School of Law. The Summer Institute is designed to
identify students who have experienced the effects of cultural or
racial discrimination, or other educational disadvantages to such an extent
that their undergraduate work or performance on standardized tests
is affected.

<P>The Institute includes a substantive first semester course
(traditionally either Contracts or Property) and a course in legal
writing. The program lasts seven weeks, beginning in late May and
ending in mid-July. Students who successfully complete this program are
accepted into the School of Law for the fall semester.
Enrollment in the Summer Institute is approximately 25 students.
In the past, 50%-60% of the candidates have successfully completed the
program.

<P>In addition to the factors considered for all applicants, the
Committee considers the applicant's race or national origin and
cultural background, including the language spoken in the home.
Applicants are also required to submit a personal statement
explaining their disadvantage.  If the disadvantage is a learning disability, appropriate documentation must be provided.  Applicants should note that a low
LSAT score or undergraduate GPA alone is insufficient evidence of
disadvantage. Because this program begins in late May each year, it
is imperative that the application be completed no later than March
1. Approximately 120 applications are received for this program.  As in
all admissions decision-making, it is not possible to offer
admission to every qualified candidate due to space limitations.
This program is tuition-free; there is a $50 administrative
and materials fee required of all participants. Students are
responsible for their housing arrangements. University housing
is available.

<td valign=top>St. Louis University School of Law recognizes the increasing public concern with health care issues, health care reform, and the impact of law on health care delivery.  The Center represents the School's commitment to heightened and sustained contributions to education, research, policy analysis, publication and service for law students, practicing health lawyers, and health care professionals.

<P>The Center utilizes the considerable expertise the School of Law has developed since the late 1970's in the law as it applies to hospitals, long-term care facilities, human experimentation, licensing, liability of health care professionals, mental health, child abuse and other areas.  The Center's faculty work closely with Saint Louis University's Health Sciences Center which includes Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Allied Health Professions, Public Health, hospitals and outpatient centers.  The Health Sciences Center provides patient services, conducts research and provides teaching across the entire spectrum of health concerns from public health to high tech clinical care.  Where appropriate, the Health Law Center can also call on members of other University Departments such as Economics and Psychology in carrying out its activities.

<P>The healthcare industry is the largest employer in the metropolitan St. Louis area, and in addition to assistance that may be provided by national organizations, the Center draws on the greater St. Louis area as a major regional health care resource.  The area includes two University medical centers, a school of pharmacy, nursing schools, teaching hospitals, three children's hospitals, numerous alternative healthcare delivery groups, and national professional and service organizations in health-related fields.

<P>The Center for Health Law Studies, established in 1982, has been ranked among the top programs in the nation in publications such as <I>U.S. New &amp; World Report</I> and the <I>ABA Student Lawyer.</I>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The study of international law in today's shrinking world has become an essential component of legal

education.  Such study not only broadens one's horizons, cultural understanding and promotes better

comprehension of the strengths and weaknesses of one's own legal system, but it also opens up new and

exciting career opportunities.



<p>The emergence of the new world order, its challenges for peace, democracy and human rights, the "CNN

factor" of instantaneous world-wide communications have all internationalized many social problems.

Breakdowns in the capacity of states to govern, civil war, massive abuses of human rights, famine,

terrorism, air hijacking, drug smuggling, and nuclear proliferation are just some of the pressing concerns

that have become internationalized.  Other areas, such as the globalization of trade, also raise important

challenges in the international commercial arena.  All of these, and many other subjects are central to the

study of international law.



<p>The internationalization of so many social and economic problems has affected the practice of domestic

law.  American courts now deal regularly with international issues.  No lawyer can thus ignore the

international legal ramifications of many issues of domestic law.<p>



These are among the reasons why the study of international law offers growing career opportunities. US

News and World Report reported that "While lawyers as a group will not be in short supply in the '90's .

. . specialists in international business . . . will be courted as business goes increasingly global ["Best

Jobs for the Future (1990 Career Guide -- Special Report)," <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i>, Sept. 25, 1989,

at 60, 69.].  The article pointed out that the career path of the "international lawyer" would be one of the

most sought after legal career paths in the 1990's. Careers in international law include opportunities both

in the private/commercial and the public sectors.  The private international lawyer may specialize in

admiralty, arbitration, banking, corporate law, trade, tax or customs law.  A public international lawyer

may specialize in immigration law, environmental law, human rights, or diplomacy.  Today, almost

every aspect of law has some international application.



<h2>The Center for International and Comparative Law</h2>



<p>In the spring of 1992, the Saint Louis University School of Law established the Center for International

and Comparative Law. The Center's mission is to further the study and practice of international and

comparative law and to prepare students for the challenges of international legal practice in the twenty-first century. The Center is responsible for developing and coordinating the international law programs at

Saint Louis University School of Law, building upon the depth of its permanent and visiting foreign law

faculty.  The Center has established several forms of programs for the study of international and

comparative law, including the Certificate in International and Comparative Law, The Master of Laws

Degree in American Law for Foreign Lawyers, the Saint Louis - Warsaw Transatlantic Law Journal, the

Jessup International Moot Court Competition, and several international exchange programs.  These

programs are described below.

<H1 align="center">A Law Degree With a Certificate in Employment Law</H1>

<P>In the fall of 1987 Saint Louis University School of Law established a new academic program emphasizing Employment Law for students who are pursuing a law degree.

<P>The program offers students interested in Employment Law the opportunity to obtain a Certificate in Employment Law while they obtain the basic degree in law (J.D.)

<P>A student pursuing a Certificate in Employment Law chooses from a wide variety of courses dealing with the employment relationship, thus acquiring a special competence in that area.  At the same time, the student receives the full range of traditional legal training to equip him or her to practice in any area of law.

<P>In recognition of the generous gift of William C. Wefel ('68), the Center was named in his honor and is now known as the William C. Wefel Center for Employment Law.

<P>The 485,000-plus-volume collection of the Omer Poos Law Library
includes microforms, rare books, audio and video cassettes,
computer assisted learning materials, CD-ROM databases and
computer
software. The library staff stays current with all the newest
developments in research and educational opportunities.

<P>The law library provides access to both the fundamental tools of
legal research and materials for in-depth scholarship. These
include foreign materials, government documents from many
American
and foreign jurisdictions, legal data bases (LEXIS, Westlaw),
bibliographic data bases (Dialog, MEDLINE, OCLC), Internet and
World Wide Web connections and in-house computers for computer
aided instruction and word processing. Each first-year student is
trained
in the use of traditional and computerized legal research tools
during the Legal Research and Writing course. Optional seminars
on
specific word processors, microcomputer literacy, and database
research strategy are offered.
For members of the School of Law community with reading
disabilities, a specially equipped PC using synthetic speech can
read aloud printed text that has been scanned or which appears on
the screen (such as Westlaw or LEXIS).

<P>The Law Library staff emphasizes attention to the individual
needs
of both students and faculty. Students are encouraged to ask
questions, and reference assistance is available all hours the
library is open.  The Library also offers one of the most
accessible
interlibrary loan programs in the region. Faculty and students
can initiate requests to borrow from other schools after
searching several union lists of holdings.  A new project, Ariel,
allows faster receipt of borrowed articles.
It holds depository status for United States and Missouri
documents and also acquires many documents for the state of
Illinois.

<P>The Law Library is part of a consortium which includes all the libraries of Saint Louis University and the University of Missouri System that will provide an Integrated Library System for its members.  During 1996, this will provide a two million-plus title database to its members.

<P>Over the past few years, the Law Library has received national
recognition in the library community through its active
participation in several projects. It now ranks 33rd out of 177
accredited law schools for volumes held. The Library is 24th nationally in number of titles (hardcopy) held, and is the largest law library in the state for volumes held.
Among its numerous
distinctions, it was one of eight libraries in the country to
receive Network Level
Enhance status on OCLC and was, in fact, the first law library to
receive this authorization. This coveted capability allows
Library
catalogers to make permanent corrections in the database. OCLC is
an international bibliographic database of over 33 million
records
supplied by more than 7,000 members. The Law Library also
contributes both full bibliographic and authority records to the
Library of Congress via an LC terminal in the library. It is the
only law library in the country to be accepted to these two
programs.  The Law Library is also prominent on the Internet,
both through its sponsorship of several electronic mail
discussion lists, and for its active role in electronic
publishing using World-Wide Web <A HREF="http://lawlib.slu.edu/">&lt;http://lawlib.slu.edu/&gt;</A>.

<P>Another way in which the law library sets itself apart from other
law libraries is in the development of specialty legal information centers.
In creating a health law center and a labor law center the library
 builds on the excellence in its faculty with unique and high
quality collections. The Law Library also houses The Smurfit
Irish Law Center, supported by donations from the legal and
business community. It is becoming nationally known as a source
of current and historical Irish legal materials. The Center
reflects the close ties between Saint Louis University and the
Irish community. With the help of SLU law professor Stanislaw
Frankowski, a Contemporary Polish Law Collection has been
assembled. This will facilitate both the tracking of the
extraordinary legal changes in Poland and the provision of
current legal information for those interested in doing business
in Poland. The newly established Jewish Law Center provides
support for the Jewish Law Seminar, and expands the Law Library's
long term emphasis on legal and ethical problems. The Law Library
also holds special collections of the papers and memorabilia of
Congresswoman Leonor K. Sullivan and labor arbitrator Fr. Leo
Brown, S.J.

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Scholarship Programs</H1>
<HR>

<P>Scholarships are available directly from the School of Law and are
awarded on the basis of outstanding academic credentials,
exceptional career achievements, and ethnic and cultural diversity.
Most scholarships are awarded to students whose academic
credentials place them in the top 50% of the incoming class, as
determined by their LSAT/GPA. These are available to both full- and
part-time students. <STRONG>Approximately half of the incoming Fall 1995 class
received merit scholarships.</STRONG>

<P>To apply for these scholarships, students should complete
the Scholarship Application which is included with the application
for admission packet.  Consideration for scholarships is given within several weeks of admission.

<P>Students should note that it is essential that their application
for admission be completed prior to March 1 to receive full
consideration. Scholarships are automatically renewable for the second and third
years of law school, provided the recipient has a cumulative GPA of
3.2.  Students whose GPA falls below 3.2 will be reviewed for renewal.

<H2>Finding a Place to Start</H2>

If you are not familiar with doing research in the law, you are likely to find the process somewhat confusing at first.  Most legal research tools are designed to make research easier for the lawyer who uses them every day, but this may seem to make legal research difficult for a person without a legal background and training.  This guide is intended to direct you to some of the basic tools and methods used in legal research, and to explain briefly how they are used. 

<P>This guide is not intended to teach an untrained user how to do the legal research needed for preparing a court case, and does not cover all the tools necessary for complete legal research.                                 

<H3>The Public Catalog</H3>

Often there will be a book on your topic that, in addition to explaining and analyzing the law in that area, will also give you references to the relevant statutes, cases, and regulations.

<P>To locate books in the Law Library's collection, use the Intelligent Catalog, the Law Library's computer-based catalog.  You will find one terminal on the First Floor, next to the Reference Desk; there are two additional terminals on the second floor.  (On the first floor are also found two other versions of the catalog, one covering all the Saint Louis University libraries, the other covering a group of 17 midwestern law school libraries.)

<P>To search for a specific book by its author or title, press the "View Catalog" key on the Intelligent Catalog terminal.  If you are searching for books on a particular topic, the best way to search is to press the "Find Anything" key.  The Intelligent Catalog will display the author, title, publisher, and call number for each book.  Refer to the Law Library Location Guide to see where each call number is located in the Law Library.


<H3>The Periodical Indexes</H3>

If you don't find any books on your specific topic of interest, or if you need more current material, use the periodical indexes. 

<P>A good law journal article will discuss the cases which have dealt with your issue, the broader issues involved, and any trends in the development of the law.  In addition, most law journals are heavily footnoted, and so can be used as one way of finding relevant cases and statutes.

<P>There are three main indexes to law journals.  The Index to Legal Periodicals covers about 500 law journals from 1926 to the present.  It is also searchable in computer form from 1980 to the present on Wilsondisc.  Legaltrac, another computerized index, covers over 750 journals after 1980.

<P>The documentation form used for legal periodicals will be different from the forms you may be used to: the volume number comes first, followed by the abbreviated title of the journal, the page number, and the date.  For instance, "31 Buffalo L. Rev. 797-882" refers to an article in volume 31 of the Buffalo
Law Review, on pages 797 to 882.  A list of the abbreviated titles of law journals is included at the beginning of the microfilm reel for the Legal Resource Index, and at the front of each volume of the Index to Legal Periodicals.

<P>Since most of the library's journals are shelved on the first floor in alphabetical order, you can usually find the journal you want by going directly to the shelves.  If you can't find the journal you are looking for,
check the Kardex file outside the Serials office, Room 127.  The Kardex lists each journal owned by the library, and will give you the call number to enable you to locate it in the library.

<P>To locate a particular call number in the Law Library, whether for a book or a law journal, refer to the Law Library Location Guide, or ask at the Circulation Desk, to find where that call number is shelved.


<H3>ALR Annotations</H3>

Another extremely useful source for finding cases is the ALR Annotation series (KF 132 .A53 for state cases, KF 105 .A54 for federal cases).  Each "annotation" gives an in-depth analysis of the law across the country on a specific issue, discussing both general principles and differences between jurisdictions, with brief summaries of each case.  Use the Index to Annotations (KF 132.6 .I53 1986) to find annotations on the topic you are interested in. 

<P>References to ALR Annotations are given in the same format as law journal articles: that is, first the volume number, then the abbreviated name of the series, then the first page of the annotation (for example, 34 A.L.R.2d 863).  Be sure to check the "pocket part" in the back of each volume for more recent cases dealing with the same issue.  (A "pocket part" is a pamphlet inserted in either the front or the back of a volume, which contains updated material as a supplement to the main volume.  Many legal reference materials are kept current this way.)


<H2>Finding Statutes</H2>

One you have read enough articles and books to have a good general understanding of your topic, you will need to look at the text of the laws themselves.  You will usually want to start with the statutes.

<P>As statutes are passed, they are published in the form of "public laws" or "session laws."  Frequently they are referred to in this form, as for instance the "Tax Reform Act of 1986."  However, statutes are frequently amended over the years, and tracing all the amendments to a statute through the annual session laws would be a tremendous task.  For this reason, statutes are compiled in subject order in publications known as "codes." 

<P>"Annotated codes" or "annotated statutes" include not only the text of the statutes, but also summaries of cases interpreting those statutes, and so are a valuable tool for locating case law as well.  Most Codes are updated with pocket parts, so always check for a pocket part to see if there are any amendments to the statute you are interested in.

<P>Use the United States Code Annotated, or U.S.C.A. (kept at the Reserve Desk) to find federal statutes.  There is a subject index to the U.S.C.A., as well as an index to acts by popular name (such as "Civil Rights Act of 1964").  The U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News, or U.S.C.C.A.N. (also at
the Reserve Desk), is used to locate recently passed federal legislation. 

<P>Use Vernon's Annotated Missouri Statutes, or V.A.M.S. (kept at the Reserve Desk) to find any Missouri statutes on a particular topic.  Use the Missouri Legislative Service (also at the Reserve Desk) to find any recently-passed statutes that have not yet been reprinted in V.A.M.S.  We also have annotated statutes for all of the other states; the state materials are on east side of the second floor (up the stairs and straight ahead), in alphabetical order by state.


<H2>Finding Case Law</H2>

The most thorough way of finding cases is through the West digests.  West Publishing Company uses an elaborate "key number system" to index cases according to the points of law they deal with; for instance, under the key number "Physicians & Surgeons 15" are indexed cases dealing with "acts or omissions constituting negligence or malpractice."  The Missouri Digest (kept at the Reserve Desk) is an index to Missouri case law; the Federal Practice Digest (KF 127 .W48) indexes cases from the federal courts. 

<P>All the West digests use the same key number system.  For  instance, you can start your research with the Missouri Digest, find the relevant key numbers, and then use the same key numbers to find federal cases on the same issue; or, if you know of a case from another state, you can use the key numbers assigned to that case to find Missouri cases on the same issue. 

<P>There are several ways to find cases in a West digest: 

<UL>
<LI>The "Descriptive Word Index" (in two or more volumes at the end of each set) is most helpful for finding cases dealing with a particular set of facts.  The Index will refer you to the key number where you will find summaries of cases involving your issue. 

<LI>The "topical approach" is often best for finding cases dealing with a particular point of law.  At the beginning of each topic there is a detailed outline of the law on that topic which is helpful in understanding the variety of issues involved in any area of law.  After identifying the general topic relevant to your issue, turn to the outline at the beginning of that topic to see how the various issues relate to each other and to identify the particular issues of interest to you.

<LI>If you are trying to find a particular case, and you have only the name of the case, use the "Case Name Table" or the "Defendant-Plaintiff Table."
</UL>

Once you have identified the relevant cases, locate and read the cases themselves. 

<P>Court decisions or opinions are published in a number of series called "reporters."  Cases are identified by a citation form similar to that used for journal articles; that is, first the name of the case, then the volume number, then the abbreviation for the reporter, then the beginning page, and finally the year of the decision.  "704 F.2d 1009" refers to a case in volume 704 of the Federal Reporter, 2d Series, page 1009.  

<P>The abbreviations of the major reporters, and the courts covered by each reporter, are listed below. 

<DL>

<DT><B>U.S.</B> or <B>S.Ct.</B>
<DD>United States Reports (U.S. Supreme Court) and Supreme Court Reporter (U.S. Supreme Court) 

<DT><B>F.</B> or <B>F.2d</B> or <B>F.3d</B>
<DD>Federal Reporter, Federal Reporter, 2d Series, and Federal Reporter, 3d Series (U.S. Court of Appeals)

<DT><B>F. Supp.</B>
<DD>Federal Supplement (U.S. District Court) 

</DL>

State court cases are published in several sets called "regional reporters": Missouri is in the Southwestern region, while Illinois is in the Northeastern region. 

<DL>

<DT><B>A.</B> or <B>A.2d</B>
<DD>Atlantic Reporter and Atlantic Reporter, 2d Series

<DT><B>N.E.</B> or <B>N.E.2d</B>
<DD>North Eastern Reporter and North Eastern Reporter, 2d Series

<DT><B>N.W.</B> or <B>N.W.2d</B>
<DD>North Western Reporter and North Western Reporter, 2d Series

<DT><B>P.</B> or <B>P.2d</B>
<DD>Pacific Reporter and Pacific Reporter, 2d Series

<DT><B>So.</B> or <B>So.2d</B>
<DD>Southern Reporter and Southern Reporter, 2d Series

<DT><B>S.E.</B> or <B>S.E.2d</B>
<DD>South Eastern Reporter and South Eastern Reporter, 2d Series

<DT><B>S.W.</B> or <B>S.W.2d </B>
<DD>South Western Reporter and South Western Reporter, 2d Series

</DL>

Frequently you will find case names given with "parallel cites": for instance, Williams v. Zbaraz, 448 U.S. 358, 100 S.Ct. 2694, 65 L.Ed.2d 831 (1980).  This simply means that the case is published in more than one reporter, by different publishers.  The list above includes only the abbreviations for the West reporters because they are usually the easiest to use; however, if you can't find the appropriate West volume, you can often find the same case in another reporter.  Ask a reference librarian if you need help.


<H2>Finding Regulations</H2>

Another very important source of law, in addition to statutes and cases, is the regulations issued by various agencies under the authority of the state legislature or the U.S. Congress.  

<P>Regulations go through a publication process similar to that of statutes: they are issued chronologically in a publication usually called a "register," and are arranged in subject order, incorporating all their amendments, in codes.

<P>The Code of State Regulations (kept at the Reserve Desk) publishes Missouri state agency regulations currently in effect.  Use the Missouri Register to locate any recent regulations amending the CSR.  The Illinois Administrative Code (KFI 1235 1985 .A2) is shelved on the second floor; the Illinois Register (KFI 1234 .A2) is located next to it.

<P>The Code of Federal Regulations (KF 70 .A3) publishes all current federal regulations.  It consists of some 100 volumes which are updated on a staggered schedule; for some titles you will be able to use the 1991 CFR, while for others the 1990 CFR is the most current available.  To find recent regulations amending the CFR, use the "List of Sections Affected" (a separate volume at the end of the set) to find references to issues of the Federal Register (KF 70 .A2).


<H2>Asking for Help</H2>

This guide is meant to give you a start on your research in the Law Library.  There are a great many more resources available in the library than can be listed here.  If you need help with any of these, or if you have questions about any of the materials described in this pamphlet, please ask a reference librarian for help.  We will do what we can to help you find and use the material you need.

<TD bgcolor="#B8C7DC" valign=top><H2>Students, Alumni and Placement</H2></TD>
<TD valign=top>
Law students enrolled in either the J.D., J.D./M.H.A. or the
LL.M. program of the School of Law have been both excellent
resources for and active consumers of Center activities.  In
addition to recent college graduates, the student body has
included physicians, dentists, nurses, hospital administrators,
pharmacists, and health planners.  Approximately fifteen percent
of the student body indicate at the time of admission a principal
interest in health law.  There is also an active student Health
Law Association at the School.
<P>Saint Louis University law alumni practice throughout the
nation and in several foreign countries.  As a group they have
been extremely successful in obtaining positions in a variety of
geographical locations and employment settings.  Alumni in health
law practice in major national health law firms in Chicago, Los
Angeles, St. Louis, and Washington, D.C.  Several serve as
administrators and in-house counsel at health care facilities
throughout the country.  Health law alumni also practice with
state and federal governments, legal services programs, and teach
in law schools.
<P>Much of this success can be attributed to the Centers's
development of an active Association of Saint Louis University
Alumni in Health Law.  Members of the Association serve as
advisors to law students seeking careers in health law and
frequently participate as both faculty and students in continuing
education and law school courses and programs.
<P>The Center publishes a Directory of Association members,
which includes information on self-identified specialty areas.
This assists alumni in finding fellow alumni for referral or
hiring purposes as well as students seeking positions.  The
Directory also identifies as speakers or student advisors, alumni
who have so volunteered.  The Alumni practicing in health law
have been invaluable to the School as resources for the School's
Placement Office.

<TD bgcolor="#B8C7DC" valign=top><H2><A NAME="pub">Publications &amp; Research</A></H2></TD>
<TD valign=top>
Faculty and students affiliated with the Center for Health
Law Studies engage in extensive research and publication
projects.  Numerous articles and several books in health-related
areas have been authored by these individuals.  The Centers also
prepare educational materials in connection with courses and
programs which it offers.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD bgcolor="#B8C7DC" valign=top><H2><A NAME="lib">Library</A></H2></TD>
<TD valign=top>
The Saint Louis University Law Library had developed an
extensive endowed collection in health law to support the
research activates of faculty, alumni and students.  With over
6,000 titles in health, the collection is one of the largest in
the country.  This collection is supplemented by the Library's
outstanding capacity for computer-assisted research, which
provides access to the research and scholarship of the health
care profession, economists and others relevant to health law.
Students and faculty have free access to electronic health law
databases, Internet, word processing software, and computer
hardware.  The Library has been a repository for the National
Health Lawyers Association.
</TD>
</TR>

<TD bgcolor="#B8C7DC" valign=top><H2><A NAME="ed">Education</A></H2></TD>
<TD valign=top>
The major mission of the Center is to utilize the resources
of the School of Law to educate law students, attorneys and
health care professionals.  Each year, law faculty teach a
variety of courses in health-related areas which are offered as
part of the regular law school curriculum, but which are much
more numerous and extensive than are found in most other Juris
Doctor programs.  The School also offers a unique J.D./M.H.A.
joint degree with the School of Public Health, and an LL.M.
degree in health law. In addition, law faculty teach courses in
other divisions of the University, primarily the Schools of
Medicine and Public Health, thereby exposing students in other
professional programs to legal issues relevant to their own
disciplines.
<P>Finally, the Center has been involved in frequent continuing
education programs for lawyers and health care professionals.
The Center for Health Law Studies conducts these programs at the
School of Law and at other locations upon request of health care
facilities or other educational institutions.

The <I>Saint Louis University Law Journal</I>, staffed and edited
entirely by law students, publishes the oldest annual Health Law
Symposium in the nation.  The symposium includes articles by
leading health law scholars and practitioners on current topics
in health law and notes and comments by law students.  Recent
editions of the Health Law Symposium have featured articles by
nationally recognized medical and legal professionals from around
the country including Government's Role in Medical Care, with
articles by Eleanor Kinney, Jack Bierig, Robert Portman, and
Douglas Mancino; Legal and Ethical Issues in Healthcare for the
Aging, with articles by Daniel Callahan, and C. Everett Koop;
Physician Payment Reform, with articles by Thomas Greaney, Paul
Ginsburg, and Barry Furrow; Medicare and Medicaid, with articles
by Herbert Eastman, Eleanor Kinney, and Robert Schwartz; Medical
Malpractice, with articles by Troyen Brennan, and Peter Budetti;
Law and Mental Health Sciences, with articles by Dorothy
Kagehiro, Mark Small and Richard Wiener; and Human
Experimentation, with articles by Jesse Goldner, Jay Katz and
Edmund Pellegrino.
<P>The <I>Public Law Review</I>, a publication of the School of Law,
periodically publishes symposia issues on health law.  In 1988,
the Review devoted an issue to AIDS and the law, including
articles on criminal law, access to health care, long-term care
and insurance.  In 1992, the Review published a Right to
Life/Right to Die Symposium.
<P>Student writing is encouraged, and annual cash prizes are
awarded for outstanding contributions to the health law field.
An endowment from the St. Louis County Medical Society, enables
the School to offer the annual Paul C. Koenig Award for student
writing in health law.  In addition, LEXIS/NEXIS, a legal
electronic database corporation also offers an annual award for
for excellence in research and writing in the healthcare field.
<P>Students at the School of Law also have opportunities to
research and write in health law in their seminars and for
Directed Research credit.  In addition, each year the School of
Law sponsors a Faculty Fellowship program in which students work
with faculty on research projects and are paid at rates
competitive with local law firms.  Recent fellowship projects
include drug recovery homes, AIDS, sentencing, institutional
review boards, legal controls on human research, a treatise on
health law, an empirical study of healthcare institutional
policies on medical futility, liability of members of
institutional ethics committees, and legal issues in medical
decisionmaking by and for children.  Given the school's eight
full-time health law faculty, and four part-time law health
faculty the opportunities for a health law student to receive a
Fellowship or to otherwise become involved in research and
writing projects are quite substantial.  Student and faculty
publications are available from the Center.

<TD valign=top>
  <H3>The Juris Doctor Program</H3>
Health law studies at Saint Louis University School of Law
center upon the Juris Doctor curriculum of the School.  The
School's range of offerings in health law is one of the broadest
found in American law schools.

<P>A basic three hour Health Law
survey course and a two credit Bioethics course are taught
annually. 
  <UL>
  <LI>The <I>Health Law survey</I> course typically covers quality control regulation, including licensing of professionals and health care institutions, private accreditation, peer review, and staff privileges; legal issues relating to the structure of health care institutions and to access to health care; medical malpractice; and a brief introduction to bioethics.
  <LI><I>Bioethics</I> addresses legal issues relating to human reproduction and birth; fetal/maternal conflicts; genetic screening and engineering; defining death; life and death decisions including the right to die, do not resuscitate orders, and criminal law implications; allocation and rationing of new technology, including organ transplants; interdisciplinary decisionmaking in health care, including human research committees and hospital ethics committees, and national advisory committees; alternative dispute resolution processes for Bioethical dilemmas; and analysis of ethical theories in medical and scientific contexts.
  </UL>
The curriculum also regularly includes a number of other specialized courses in health law:
  <UL>
  <LI><I>Health Care Financing and Planning</I> focuses on regulatory and business aspects of health care practice as well as various state and federal health reform proposals, with particular attention to the application of various areas of law (e.g., corporate tax, antitrust, fraud and abuse) in advising clients on structuring health care organizations.
  <LI><I>Health Care Provider Liability</I> focuses on private law responses to quality of care and autonomy issues involving health care providers and their consumers.  The course examines the competing and overlapping liability models applied to health care providers, and the liability exposure of different provider groups, from individual health care profes sionals through provider groups to third party payors and drug and device manufacturers.  The course covers the full range of litigation issues including expert and scientific evidence, causation, damages, and insurance issues as they relate to HCPs.  Additionally, considerable attention is paid to the effect of statutory reforms, ranging from qualifications of experts through limitations on certain types of damage recovery to mandated dispute resolution mechanisms. 
  <LI>Participants in the <I>Law and Psychiatry</I> seminar include ten law students and six to eight psychiatry resident physicians.  The seminar is divided into three parts.  During the initial two weeks, the law students are given a general introduction to psychiatric diagnosis and treatment while the residents will receive a similar introduction to law and the legal system.  During the next eight weeks, all participants will meet jointly.  The goal of the seminar is to expose the participants to the following topics: legal aspects of providing mental health treatment, including such issues as regulation and quality control, therapist-patient confidentiality, medical malpractice, informed consent, and the liability to third parties harmed by a patient; issues relating to the liberty and property interests of mentally disabled persons, including the legal impact of expert opinions, mental disability and the criminal law, legal competency, the commitment system, and the right to treatment; and, rather briefly, benefits and protection for the mentally disabled, including social security benefits, special education benefits, employment discrimination and reasonable accommodations, and access to housing.  During the final sessions, law students will make presentations on their seminar papers. 
  <LI>Other recent offerings in specialized health care courses have included seminars in AIDS, Public Health and the Law, Child Abuse and Neglect, Food and Drug Regulations, Law and Aging, Not for Profit Organizations, Occupational Health, Professional Malpractice, and Bioethics:
Death and Dying.
  </UL>
The following course offerings are related to the healthcare field:
<blockquote>Administrative Law, Alternative Dispute Resolution, Antitrust,
Business Associations, Civil Practice, Evidence, Insurance,
Products Liability, Regulated Industries, Remedies, Trial
Advocacy, and seminars in Tax-exempt Organizations, and White
Collar Crime.</blockquote>
  <P>The health law curriculum is continuing to expand.  In
addition to courses, seminars and clinics, the student interested
in health law may participate in Directed Research under the
supervision of a faculty member for academic credit.
  <P>The Civil Clinic includes opportunities to work with law
school faculty in an in-house clinical setting as well as extern
placements.  Students working in the in-house Health Law Clinic
provide legal services to the elderly, to persons with HIV and
AIDS, and to families of persons with Alzheimer's.  In-house
clinic students also represent psychiatric patients and prosecute
child abuse and neglect cases in family court.  Students have
also had the opportunity to assist the School's in-house faculty
in major litigation on issues concerning Medicaid payments for
pharmaceuticals and housing discrimination against recovering
alcoholics.  Externship opportunities include placements with the
U.S. Attorney's Office, and with local hospitals.  Students in
the U.S. Attorney's Office, work with the task force which
investigates and prosecutes federal crimes related to health care
fraud and abuse, as well as civil fraud cases brought against
health care providers.  Students working at area hospitals assist
in-house counsel with hospital policy and procedure and risk
management.
  <H3>The LL.M. Program</H3>
The School also offers a small, highly selective advanced
degree program in health law.  The LL.M. program admits up to
five candidates a year.  A significant portion of the 24 credit
hour program is dedicated to research in health law.  In
recognition of both the experience level of many advanced degree
candidates and their potential interest specializing in a
particular area of health law, the LL.M. program encourages
candidates to take up to six credit hours in Directed Research,
which requires the production of publishable, scholarly articles
under faculty supervision.
  <H3>The J.D./M.H.A. Program</H3>
The School of Law and the School of Public Health offer a
unique joint J.D./M.H.A. degree.  The student, upon completion of
the first year of law school, begins a course of study that
results in the award of both degrees after a total of four years
of study, instead of the five ordinarily required if the two
degrees were pursued separately.  The only summer commitment
required for the joint degree is participation in a health care
administration residency during the summer after the third year.
In this residency, candidates for the joint degree serve in
administrative capacities in health care facilities.
  <P>A student studying for the J.D. may take up to six credit
hours in approved graduate-level courses offered in University
graduate schools and departments, including the School of Public
Health and the School of Business and Administration.
Courses offered in the School of Public Health include:
  <P><blockquote>Health Care Organizations, Statistics-Health Sciences,
Epidemiology, Chronic Disease Epidemiology, Environmental-
Occupational Health, Health Risk Management, Industrial Hygiene,
Health Planning Marketing, Health Policy, Urban Public Health
Policy, Principles/Practices of Health Education, Community
Health, Health Information Systems, Health Care Economics,
Organizational Behavior and Health Care Delivery, Long Term Care
Administration and Planning, Health Care Human Resources
Management, Ethics and Catholic Health Care, Health Finance
Management, Financial Aspects of Health Care Delivery, and Health
Administration.</blockquote>
  <P>The curriculum is particularly strong in other areas
relevant to a health law practice.  For example, the School
offers a nationally recognized program in trial advocacy for
which it received the prestigious Emil Gumpert Award of the
American College of Trial Lawyers in 1985.
  <H3>Continuing Education Programs</H3>
A primary function of the Center for Health Law Studies is
the development and sponsorship of continuing education programs
for lawyers and health care providers.  These programs are also
available to law students and have covered a wide range of
healthcare topics.
  <H4>Programs and featured speakers over the last several years have
included the following:</H4>
    <UL>
    <LI><I>Government's Role in Medicare:</I> James Blumstein, Eleanor Kinney,
Jack Bierig, Robert Portman, Douglas Mancino, and Walter
Metcalfe, Jr.
    <LI><I>Health Care for the Elderly:</I> Daniel Callahan, Karen Rothenberg,
Ellen Olson, Gary Crum, Robert Schwartz, Eleanor Kinney, Maxwell
Melman, and James Blumstein.
    <LI><I>Physician Payment Reform:</I> Thomas Greaney, Paul Ginsburg, Clark
Havighurst, Barry Furrow, John Holahan, Ross Rubin, Mark Segal,
and Sandra Sherman.
    <LI><I>Medicare and Medicaid:</I> Eleanor Kinney, Rand Rosenblatt, Robert
Schwartz, Ann Lever, Herbert Eastman, and Matthew Strickler.
    <LI><I>Medical Malpractice:</I> Troyen Brennan, Peter Budetti, Walter
Wadlington, and John Blum.
    <LI><I>Law and Mental Health Sciences:</I> Richard Wiener, Bruce Sales,
Connie Beck, Richard Haan, James Ogloff, Randy Otto, Dorothy
Kagehiro, and Mark Small.
    <LI><I>Human Experimentation and Human Rights:</I> Jay Katz, Edmund
Pellegrino, Jesse Goldner, R. Alta Charo, and Nicholas Terry.
    </UL>
The Center has also co-sponsored national health law
programs with the National Health Lawyers Association, and the
American Society of Law, Medicine, and Ethics.  The Center has
offered continuing education programs on Long-Term Care and the
Law, Legal Issues Concerning Nurse Practitioners and Physician's
Assistants, Legal Issues in Licensing and Credentialing, and
Legal Issues for Nurse Administrators.  This year, the Center
will offer a program on Health Care Reform, with a keynote
address by Lawrence Gostin, and a conference in conjunction with
the American Society of Law, and Ethics on Ethics Committees and
the Young.
  <P>Students at the School of Law are admitted to these
continuing education programs and charged only for materials.
The continuing education programs allow our law students to
enrich their own study and to meet lawyers practicing health law.
  <H3>Colloquia</H3>
Finally, during each year, the Center together with the Student
Health Law Association sponsors a Colloquia series.  Leading
practitioners, law school faculty, and others who work in the
health law area make presentations to students concerning current
topics of interest.  The student Health Law Association, also
offers a series of brown bag lunch seminars, in an informal
setting where students interested in health law can meet with
health law practitioners.

<H2>Doing Legal Research on the Internet</H2>

WESTLAW and LEXIS are large commercial services that provide legal information to lawyers, law students, and others, on a fee-paying basis.  Law schools pay large annual subscription fees to provide these services, and are required by contract to restrict use of these services to law school faculty, staff, and students.  

<P>The Internet, of course, is free to anyone who has access to it.  Although the legal information resources available to the public on the Internet do not approach the scope of WESTLAW and LEXIS, nonetheless there is a growing collection of legal material on the Internet.  Some of this legal information is provided by the U.S. federal government (for instance, <A HREF=gopher://cyfer.esusda.gov:70/11/ace>Americans Communicating Electronically,</A> the collection of federal legislation and other material provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Extension Service); some is provided by the states (for instance, the <A HREF=http://www.law.indiana.edu/codes/ca/codes.html>California statutes</A> provided by the State of California).  

<P>Most of the legal information currently found on the Internet, however, is provided as a public service by law schools in the United States and abroad.  Many law schools have begun carving out particular subject-area niches for themselves.  For example:

<UL>
<LI>The <A HREF=http://www.law.cornell.edu/lii.table.html>Legal Information Institute</A> at Cornell Law School provides a great deal of material on <A HREF=http://www.law.cornell.edu:80/copyright/context.html>intellectual property (copyright, patent, and trademark)</A> law. 

<LI><A HREF=http://www.law.indiana.edu/>Indiana University Law School </A> publishes two "electronic" law journals, and offers a <A HREF=http://www.law.indiana.edu:80/fcrc/fcrc.html>Feminist Curricular Materials Clearinghouse.</A>

<LI>The <A HREF=http://ananse.irv.uit.no/law/nav/hp.html>University of Troms&oslash;</A> in Norway is building a collection of materials on <A HREF=http://ananse.irv.uit.no/trade_law/nav/trade.html>international trade law.</A>

<LI>A <A HREF=http://fatty.law.cornell.edu/topical.html>topical listing of legal materials on the Internet</A> is maintained by the Legal Information Institute at Cornell Law School.

<H1>Legal Encyclopedias: Am.Jur.2d and C.J.S.</H1>

<LI>Legal Encyclopedias in General
<LI>C.J.S. and Am. Jur. 2d Compared
<LI>How to Use Legal Encyclopedias
<LI>When to Use Legal Encyclopedias
</UL>

<H2>Legal Encyclopedias in General</H2>

A "legal encyclopedia" is not an encyclopedia in the usual sense; it does not consist of thousands of individual short articles on narrow topics such as you would find in the <I>Encyclopaedia Britannica</I>.  Rather, it is more like an extensive multi-volume treatise that attempts to summarize all of the law in somewhat the way Corbin does for Contracts or Prosser and Keeton do for Torts.

<P>There are two general American legal encyclopedias: <I>Corpus Juris Secundum,</I> or <I>C.J.S.</I>, and <I>American Jurisprudence, Second Series,</I> or <I>Am. Jur. 2d</I>.  Each encyclopedia arranges the entire field of law into a little more than 400 topics, in about 100 volumes.

<P>However, there are several differences between the two encyclopedias and the typical treatise.  For instance, while the more commonly cited treatises are written by major legal scholars in their respective       fields--Corbin on Contracts, Prosser on Torts, Tribe on Constitutional Law, Scott on Trusts--the two legal encyclopedias are written by large, anonymous editorial staffs.

<P>For this reason, they are seldom cited in judicial opinions these days.  Where they are cited, it is likely   to be for the case citations compiled in them, rather than for their analysis of the law. 

<P>However, the legal encyclopedias can be useful to the researcher for those case citations.  Although treatises include references to major cases, the legal encyclopedias include a great many more cases.

<P>In addition, the discussion of the law found in the legal encyclopedias, while it does not carry as much weight as discussion of the same topics by Corbin or Tribe, can be useful in the beginning stages of research in an unfamiliar area of law.  They must be used with caution, however, because in many cases the discussion is not updated and rewritten to keep current with developing case law; most of the updating is simply adding references to new cases, rather than rewriting the main text of the article.


<H2>C.J.S. and Am. Jur. 2d Compared</H2>

<I>C.J.S.</I> is published by West, and so the list of topics in <I>C.J.S.</I> is very similar, though not identical, to the list of West Digest Topics.  <I>Am. Jur. 2d</I>, published by Lawyers Co-op, has its own separate list of topics.

<P>Formerly, <I>C.J.S.</I> claimed to include citations to every relevant case on a particular topic.  <I>Am. Jur. 2d</I> has always been selective in its citations to cases.  The editors of <I>Am. Jur. 2d</I> believe that their "selective editorial process weeds out the obsolete and the redundant, leaving the law that relates to the point, supported by the controlling cases that interpret and construe the law."  In recent years, <I>C.J.S.</I> has changed its editorial policy, and the current volumes include only selected citations to cases.  In either instance, however, the researcher should not rely solely on the cases found in the encyclopedia; it is always necessary to use a variety of research tools (digests, ALR annotations, journal articles, Shepards, Westlaw and LEXIS) to find all the relevant cases.

<P>Although the textual discussion of the law in <I>C.J.S.</I> supersedes and replaces the text of the first series of <I>Corpus Juris,</I> the case citations do not always incorporate the cases cited in the earlier series.  For this reason, it is necessary to use <I>Corpus Juris</I> to find older cases.  <I>Am. Jur. 2d</I>, however, completely supersedes the first series of American Jurisprudence, cases and all.

<P>Both encyclopedias publish revised volumes periodically.  Both encyclopedias issue completely revised volumes on federal taxation annually--<I>Am. Jur. 2d</I> in "Federal Taxation," volumes 33, 34 & 34A; <I>C.J.S.</I> in "Internal Revenue," volumes 47A and 47B.  In addition, <I>Am. Jur. 2d</I> includes a separate looseleaf binder, the New Topic Service, which permits the publication of completely new topics    without having to issue new bound volumes.

<P>Both encyclopedias offer cross-references to other research tools.  <I>C.J.S.</I>, at least in its more recent volumes, gives references to key numbers for relevant topics; this enables the researcher to find additional cases, either in the General Digests, the state and federal Digests, or on Westlaw.  The references in <I>Am. Jur. 2d</I> provide access to a whole range of practice-oriented material in the Lawyers' Co-op "Total Client Service Library," or TCSL.  These materials include A.L.R. annotations, <I>Am. Jur. Proof of Facts</I>, <I>Am. Jur. Legal Forms</I>, <I>Am. Jur. Pleading & Practice Forms</I>, <I>Am. Jur. Trials</I>, and other sets.  These practice materials are the main reason many lawyers prefer <I>Am. Jur. 2d</I> to <I>C.J.S.</I>

<P>Each encyclopedia offers a few unique features that the other set does not have.  For instance, <I>C.J.S.</I> also functions as a legal dictionary.  Definitions of legal words and phrases are included, interpersed in alphabetical order among the more substantive articles.

<P>On the other hand, Am. Jur. 2d offers a convenient one-volume compilation, the Am. Jur. 2d Deskbook, which provides a handy reference source for a wide variety of information the lawyer might need.  Material included ranges from primary sources of law such as the U.S. Constitution and historical documents such as the Magna Carta, to statistical tables on crimes reported and compound interest and annuities, to an automobile skid-speed chart.  Anytime you need to find some out-of-the-way fact or figure, the <I>Am. Jur. 2d Deskbook</I> may be a good place to start.


<H2>How to Use Legal Encyclopedias</H2>

There are four ways to find relevant materials in the legal encyclopedias:

<OL>
<LI>through the general index to the entire set,
<LI>through the individual title indexes,
<LI>through the topical outlines, and 
<LI>through the tables.
</OL>

<strong>General Index:</strong>  Each encyclopedia has a multi-volume general index in the last few volumes of the set.  In some cases, the general index will refer you directly to the relevant title and section.  In any case, you will generally want to start with the general index to identify at least the relevant title.

<P><strong>Title Indexes:</strong>  In addition to the general or master index, each individual title has a separate, more detailed index.  This title index may be used to narrow down your search even further.

<P><strong>Topical Outlines:</strong>  In many cases, the most effective way to find the relevant sections is to (1) locate the relevant title in the general index, and then (2) examine the topical outline for that title.  The topical outline will frequently lay out the legal issues for you, and enable you to see how your particular concern fits into the larger context.

<P><strong>Tables:</strong>  In addition, <I>Am. Jur. 2d</I> has a separate volume, <I>Table of Statutes, Rules, and Regulations Cited</I>, which allows the researcher to find any references in <I>Am. Jur. 2d</I> to the U.S. Code, the C.F.R., federal rules of procedure, evidence, and so on, and uniform laws such as the U.C.C.


<H2>When to Use Legal Encyclopedias</H2>

Because of the relatively low esteem in which the legal encyclopedias are held, they are not used by researchers as often as they once were.  However, there are circumstances in which they can prove very useful.  Here are some examples:

<P><strong>Researching older cases.</strong>  Since <I>C.J.S.</I> aims to be comprehensive in its collection of cases, it can sometimes be useful if you are interested in the historical development of an obscure or narrow point of law.

<P><strong>Finding practice materials.</strong>  <I>Am. Jur. 2d</I> is useful for this, since it gives you, in addition to narrative discussion of the law, numerous references to practice materials which can assist you in preparing for trial.

<P><strong>Researching areas in which there is no recent treatise or hornbook.</strong>  For instance, in the field of suretyship law, the most recent treatise is the fifth edition of Stearns, published in 1951.  The discussion of "Principal and Surety" in <I>C.J.S.</I> was completely rewritten in 1987 and extends for 246 pages.

<HR>
<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Areas of Specialization</H1>

<H3 align="center">The School of Law has developed exceptional programs in
the areas of health law, professional skills training,
international law and employment law.</H3>

<P><HR>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">The Wefel Center for Employment Law</H2>
<HR>

<P>In 1987, the School of Law established the Center for Employment
Law, drawing on its outstanding and nationally recognized faculty
in this field.  The Center offers interested students an
opportunity to specialize in the subject of the employment
relationship as a unifying thread for their study of law. The
Center awards to students who satisfactorily complete the program
a Certificate in Employment Law which recognizes their special course of study in
Employment Law (see <A HREF="#cert">Certificates</A>).

<P>The employment relationship is one of the most fundamental and
important relationships in modern industrial societies.
Exploration of this relationship involves consideration of legal
rules affecting decisions to hire, to promote, to confer benefits
and to discharge emloyees, and covers the unorganized work force
as well as unionized sectors of the economy, top management
officials as well as part-time clerks.  The study of employer and
employee rights and responsibilities ranges from the prohibition
of discrimination based on race, age, sex, religion, or
disability, to the traditional establishment of collective
bargaining relationships between unions and manaagement in the
private sector and the more recent establishment of such
relations in the public sector; to regulation of employee
benefits and qualified retirement plans, as well as regulation of
health and safety in the workplace.  A wide range of
opportunities for employment exist in this field.

<P>The School of Law offers an extensive labor and employment law curriculum.  In addition to the regularly scheduled courses (listed in the description of the <A HREF="#cert">Certificate</A> in Employment Law Program, the School of Law has recently offered two mini-courses taught by nationally-recognized employment law scholars.  In the Spring of 1996, Distinguished Visiting Professor David E. Feller taught a course entitled "Arbitration of Statutory Claims."  In the Fall of 1996, Distinguished Visiting Professor Julius J. Getman taught a mini-course entitled "Collective Bargaining and the Right to Strike."

<P>The Center for Employment Law has demonstrated its commitment to
the promotion of academic scholarship and publication as well as
to serving the needs ot the practicing bar by presenting annual
conferences which explore current significant issues in labor and
employment law.  Many of the nationally known speakers at these
conferences have also published articles in the <I>Saint Louis
University Law Review</I> and in the <I>Public Law Review</I>.

<P>The annual conferences are held at the law school, thereby
offering students who attend these programs the opportunity to
learn about critical issues in labor and employment law as well
as the opportunity to meet and exchange views with prominent
academics and leading members of the practicing bar.  Annual
programs of this nature also serve as a means of introducing
students to prospective employers.

<P>In 1996 the Center for Employment Law and the Center for Health Law Studies co-sponsored a conference entitled "Shifting Professional Relationships in Contemporary Health Care: Privileges, Labor, Employment and Contract."  In 1995 the eighth annual Center for Employment Law conference
offered consideration of the future of the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) by the current NLRB Chairman, William B.
Gould IV, who was on leave from his position as Charles A.
Beardsley Professor of Law at Stanford University.

<P>Also in 1995, in conjunction with the National Employment Lawyers
Association, the Center co-sponsored a full day program entitled
"How to Prepare and Try Employment Discrimination Cases: Basics
in Employment Discrimination," presented by Professor Leland Ware
of the Center faculty and prominent local practitioners.

<P>"Smoking in the Workplace" was
the topic of the 1993-94 conference which featured two national
experts in the areas of health law and tobacco liability as well
as
a prominent local attorney who is currently engaged in a second-hand
smoke case.

<P>The St. Louis metropolitan area affords an ideal location for the
operations of the Center, encompassing both an impressive number
of
large corporate employers and a range of medium and small
businesses. Virtually the entire spectrum of legal issues
involving
employment is reflected in the city and surrounding suburbs and
towns.

<P>Participation in the Employment Law Association, the student
organization within the School of Law, has increased dramatically
since the inception of the program.  Each year the association
and
the Center offer a variety of programs for students ranging from
substantive programs addressing such diverse topics as Sports
Law,
Sexual Harassment and Worker's Compensation to programs focussing
on employment law practice and social events.

<P>In recognition of the generous gift of William C. Wefel ('68),
the
Center was named in his honor in 1994 and is now known as the
William
C. Wefel Center for Employment Law.

<P><HR>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">The Center for Health Law Studies</H2>
<HR>

<P>The School has long been a leader in the health law area.  The
national reputation of the School's Center for Health Law
Studies has been cited in numerous articles over an extended
period
of time. In 1985 The Student Lawyer magazine, the official
publication of the Law Student Division of the ABA, listed eight
schools as being involved in health law, noting that Saint Louis
University "is one of the most active schools in the nation in
this
area." In each of its four reviews of law schools' health law
programs, most recently in 1995, the <I>U.S. News and World Report</I>
ranked  Saint Louis University among the top five in the
country, listing SLU as first in both 1995 and 1996.

<P>The Center utilizes the considerable expertise the School of Law
has developed since the late 1970's in the law as it applies to
hospitals, long-term care facilities, human experimentation,
licensing, liability of health care professionals, mental health,
child abuse and other areas. The Center's faculty work closely
with
Saint Louis University's School of Medicine, School of Nursing,
School of Allied Health Professions, and School of Public Health.

<P>The School's health law program is unique in that there are seven
full-time faculty members involved in the health law area and
available to advise and work with health law students. These
faculty members are involved in conducting research projects on a
wide range of health law issues. Opportunities are available for
students to participate in these projects as research assistants
or
to conduct their own work, under supervision, for directed
research
credit.  Center faculty and students edit <I>The Journal of Health and Hospital Law</I>,  the official journal of the American Academy of Healthcare Attorneys of the American Hospital Association (see <A HREF="http://lawlib.slu.edu/lawschl/orgs.htm#journals">Journals</A>).  The School's endowed library collection in health law
provides an outstanding research facility.

<P>Students enrolled in the J.D. program may earn a <A HREF="#cert">Certificate</A> in
Health Law, to be awarded at the time they receive their law
degree. The School also offers a four-year joint degree program
in Law and Health Administration. Students earning the
J.D./M.H.A. are well prepared to hold top level positions in
health care facilities or specialized health care organizations,
such as trade associations and governmental regulatory agencies,
and to practice law with clients such as  hospitals and medical
group practices. Students must apply separately   for admission
both to the School of Law and to the School of Public Health if
they wish to participate in the joint degree program and  each of
the Schools utilizes different admissions criteria. The
application to the School of Public Health can be submitted
concurrently with the law school application or during the
student's first year of law school.

<P>The School also offers a Master of Laws degree in Health Law for
individuals who have already obtained their basic law degree.
This opportunity is described under <A HREF="#grad">Graduate Programs</A> in this
bulletin.

<P>The student Health Law Association continues to grow. Many
special
programs are offered throughout the year to bring students
information about the many opportunities in health law. The Saint
Louis University Health Law Alumni Association provides
assistance
to the health law program in a variety of ways. Members offer
career counseling and job placement help, participate in school
programs on health law, and supervise students in clinical
placements in health law settings.

<IMG SRC="http://lawlib.slu.edu/lawschl/katz.gif" ALIGN=right>
<P>The Center sponsors an annual Health Law Symposium which
brings together noted national figures who are health law
scholars
and practitioners. Papers presented at the conference are
published
as part of an annual health law symposium issue of the School's
<I>Law
Journal</I>.

<P><A HREF="http://lawlib.slu.edu/centers/hlthlaw/llm.htm">Further detailed information</A> is available from the <A HREF="mailto:admissions@lawlib.slu.edu">Law Admissions

<P><HR>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">The Center for International &amp; Comparative Law</H2>
<HR>

<IMG SRC="http://lawlib.slu.edu/lawschl/gorb.gif" ALIGN=left><P>In the spring of 1992, the School of Law established the Center
for
International and Comparative Law. The international law program
at
Saint Louis University School of Law builds upon the depth of the
law faculty working in international and comparative law. The
School has six faculty members who were trained as lawyers in
foreign legal systems. Three other faculty members have
significant
experience in international law. Several other faculty members
have
done extensive lecturing abroad. Faculty members have published
in
the leading international law reviews, including those of
Stanford,
Harvard, Virginia and others, and with leading presses such as
Oxford University and Martinus-Nijhoff.

<P>The strength of the program is a result of the combination of
curricular and extra-curricular offerings, permanent and visiting
faculty, and a strong library collection. This rich program will
prepare students for practice in the next century. Some years ago, the Center
inaugurated a <A HREF="#cert">Certificate</A> in International Law, which
allows J.D. students to specialize in international and comparative law studies.

<P>To complement the course offerings in international law, the
School
has a number of special study opportunities in European
countries.
Through the <B>Brussels Seminar</B> and the <B>Ruhr University Exchange
Program</B>, the School offers its qualified students four to five
weeks of high quality instruction in Europe, at no charge for
tuition and accommodations.

<P>The Brussels Seminar on Law and Institutions of the European
Economic Community is held each July at Universite Libre de
Bruxelles in Brussels, Belgium. Ten students from the School are
eligible to attend the Seminar. The Seminar lasts approximately
three weeks and includes visits to the medieval city of Bruges
and
to Luxembourg, where the students attend a hearing before the EEC
Court of Justice and have an audience with Judges of the Court.

<P>In 1985, the School hosted a visit by students and faculty members from Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany. As a result of this visit, the School entered into a cooperative
agreement with Ruhr University which permits student exchanges. In 1987 the first group of students from the School spent 10 days in Bochum and received lectures by German professors (in English) on Civil Law.  This program is held just prior to the Brussels Seminar.

<P>The School also has developed cooperative agreements with Sichuan
University in Chengdu, People's Republic of China, and the
University of Warsaw. Recent international visitors have included
distinguished faculty members from the People's Republic of
China,
Italy, England, Australia, Israel, Germany, Poland, Belgium, and
Egypt.

<P>Each year the Center invites distinguished foreign visitors
including the Irvin and Margaret Dagen Visiting Professorship.  Among the most recent of these visitors are Justice Leszek Garlicki, Professor Bernard Rudden, and Professor Joel Mon&eacute;ger.

<P>In October 1992 the School hosted a visit by former President
Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia. In November 1992 the Center hosted the
first visit to the United States of the Justices of the Constitutional
Court of Russia.

<P>The Center for International and Comparative Law has recently
established a joint publication with Warsaw University in Poland to be
called the <I>Saint Louis-Warsaw Transatlantic Law Journal</I>.
This is the first peer-reviewed journal in the United States
established in cooperation with a European university.  The
Journal publishes articles by scholars on both sides of the
Atlantic in the field of international and comparative law.  Volume I, published in 1995, features many distinguished authors, including U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

<P><A HREF="http://lawlib.slu.edu/centers/cicl/cicl.htm">Further detailed information</A> on the Center for International and Comparative Law is available from the <A HREF="mailto:admissions@lawlib.slu.edu">Admissions Office &lt;admissions@lawlib.slu.edu&gt;</A>.

<P><HR>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Professional Skills</H2>
<HR>

<P>At the School of Law, students are expected to learn the art of
legal analysis, to become proficient in legal problem-solving,
and
to acquire a deep sense of professional responsibility. The
Professional Skills cluster of the law school's curriculum offers
students ample opportunities to meet these expectations. The
cluster is comprised of several distinct, yet complementary
components which allow students to develop and practice a wide
range of lawyering techniques. Upper-division students who enroll
in these skills courses are involved in "live-client" situations
as
well as the more traditional simulated exercises. As evidence of
the quality of its programs, Saint Louis University School of Law
received  the prestigious Emil Gumpert Award in 1985 for
excellence in teaching  trial advocacy. The $25,000 award was
added to the School's specific endowment for its advocacy program.

<P>The School of Law offers an exceptionally rich and stimulating
selection of skills courses to its students. These include:

<P><EM>Simulation Courses:</EM> Students often learn the most
important skills of
lawyering through a variety of simulated classroom exercises.
These
exercises include simulated negotiations, depositions, and
drafting
assignments in such classes as Civil Practice, Real Estate
Transactions, Estate Planning. They may also
involve the student in the development of legal problem-solving
skills in the areas of Professional Responsibility and
Alternative
Dispute Resolution. Students may enroll in Moot Court, Advanced
Criminal Procedure, Client Counseling, and Trial Advocacy, all of
which expose students to the unique set of circumstances which
they
will face in actual practice.

<P><EM>Civil Clinic:</EM> This Clinic consists of two types of
placements:
in-house and extern. A student in the in-house clinic may work
with
mentally incapacitated clients, the homebound elderly, families
of
Alzheimer's patients, community groups which represent low-income
populations, the homeless, and persons with AIDS. In-house clinic
students work out of a law office in the School
of Law which includes staff attorney offices, interview rooms, a
library and a conference area. The extern program offers student
placements at Legal Services of Eastern Missouri, the District
Counsel of the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Attorney's
Office, and the EEOC, to name a representative sample.

<P><EM>Criminal Clinic:</EM> Students who enroll in this course
represent
clients in criminal matters in the St. Louis City Public
Defender's
Office. Criminal Clinic students concurrently register in the
Advanced Criminal Procedure course, which, through simulated
exercises, focuses on the trial process from arrest through
sentencing.

<P><EM>Judicial Process Clinic:</EM> These internship experiences
are open in
both semesters to students who have completed all first year
course requirements and are in good standing at the School of
Law.  Students who are selected for one of these positions clerk
for state or federal judges in the Missouri and Illinois trial
and appellate courts.

<P><HR>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Joint Degree Programs</H2>
<HR>

<P>The School of Law has established joint degree programs with the
graduate programs in Business Administration (JD/MBA), Hospital
and
Health Care Administration (JD/MHA), Public Administration (JD/MA
in Public Administration), and Urban Affairs (JD/MA in Urban
Affairs). In addition, the School will consider fashioning a
joint
degree program to meet individual student interests.

<P>The joint degree student must fulfill all entrance requirements
of
both schools, including the graduate school's entrance exam as
well
as the LSAT. Application to the master's program may be made
after
enrollment at the School of Law or at the same time as the
application to the law school.  Part-time evening students
interested
in joint degree programs must have maximum flexibility in their
work
schedule in order to complete curricular requirements of both
degree
programs.

<P>Further detailed information is available from the <A HREF="mailto:admissions@lawlib.slu.edu">Law Admissions Office &lt;admissions@lawlib.slu.edu&gt;</A> on any of the areas of
specialization or joint degree programs.

<HR>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Opportunities for Interdisciplinary Study</h2>
<HR>

<P>A variety of opportunities exist for interdisciplinary study
without the formal commitment to a joint program.  For example,
the <I>Housing Issues Symposium</I> has been offered for several
years in the fall semester as a way for students from Law (SLU),
Public Policy (SLU), Social Service (SLU), and Architecture
(Washington Univ.) to work in teams of study and address a
specific housing issue during the course.  With a variety of
guest lecturers and presentations by the several participating
faculty members, students gain insight into different ways of
approaching a problem.

<P>Students collaborate on a project that requires them to pool
their information, bring their different backgrounds and
experiences to the table, and work out a proposal.  They often
must struggle to understand their different nomenclature, their
different theoretical perspectives, and their different values as
they work through the problem.  But the work is the richer for
the struggle, and the students benefit greatly from their
exposure to different aspects of the same problem.  The following
spring the results of the team efforts are presented at a
symposium attended by a variety of interested groups: city
workers, non-profit agencies, professionals, consultants,
advocates, providers, and so forth.

<P><HR>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="grad"></A>Graduate Programs</H2>
<HR>

<H3>Master of Laws in Health Law</H3>

<P>The School of Law is offering a small, highly selective advanced
degree program in health law. The LL.M. program will admit up to
five candidates each year.  The degree requirements include 24
credit   hours, to be taken over a two-year period. Candidates
may take up to six hours of Directed Research and six hours
outside of the School of Law to meet the 24 hours required.

<P>A significant portion of the program will be dedicated to
directed
research in health law, in recognition of both the experience
level
of many advanced degree candidates and their potential interest
in
specializing in a particular area of health law. The program
builds
on the strength of the School's Center for Health Law Studies,
which includes seven full-time law faculty engaged in active
teaching and research in health law, an outstanding endowed
library
collection in health law, and enrichment programs developed and
supported by the Center.

<P><A HREF="http://lawlib.slu.edu/centers/hlthlaw/hlthlaw.htm">Further information on the LL.M. in Health Law</A> is available from the <A HREF="mailt:admission@lawlib.slu.edu">Law Admissions Office &lt;admission@lawlib.slu.edu&gt;</A>.

<H3>Master of Laws in American Law for Foreign Lawyers</H3>

<P>The School of Law offers a one year graduate program leading to a
Master of Laws degree for lawyers holding a basic law degree from
a
foreign country. The principal objective of this program is to
provide a small select group of highly qualified individuals with
the opportunity to pursue studies and research in American law.
It
is designed primarily for students whose first degree in law was
received at a foreign university which did not instruct in the
common law system, although foreign lawyers from common law
countries will also be considered.

<P>The purposes of the program are three-fold: to facilitate and
improve understanding of the American legal system, particularly
in
its practical application; to provide a solid framework for
advanced legal research; and to provide specialized training
which
would be of use in law practice, law teaching, or legal
scholarship
in the candidate's own country. The program requires a total of
twenty-four semester hours of credit.  A thesis of publishable quality done under faculty  supervision is required for graduation.

<P>Further detailed information on the LL.M. for Foreign Lawyers is
available from the <A HREF="mailto:admissions@lawlib.slu.edu">Law Admissions Office&lt;admission@lawlib.slu.edu&gt;</A>. Please request the

requirements of the program.  In exceptional cases -- for
example, financial hardship -- the directors of the Center may
waive this requirement.  All candidates for the certificate are
strongly encouraged to enroll in such courses in European
Community Law as are available.  The remaining hours should be
earned in the other courses in the international and comparative
law curriculum.  The candidates must also complete at least one
international or comparative law seminar with a writing
requirement.

<P>The program also encourages some proficiency in a foreign
language.  Students in the certificate program are required to

foreign language classes outside the Law School is also
encouraged.

<P>The current course offerings include International Law,
Regulation of Foreign Trade, Multinational Corporate
Transactions, Conflicts of Law, Comparative Law, International
Tax, and European Union Law.  Seminars include International
Commercial Arbitration, New World Order, International Trade
Litigation, International Environmental Law, Comparative Systems
of International Trade, European Economic Community, The
Constitution and Foreign Affairs, Major Criminal Justice Systems,
Brussels Seminar and Jessup International Law Moot Court
Competition.

<P>We also continue to receive visitors to teach a variety of
minicourses on comparative law such as EU Banking Law,
Comparative Commercial Law and Comparative Constitutional Law.
These courses would also count toward fulfilling the requirements
of the program.

<HR>

<P>Discovering which of the many fine accredited law schools will best
suit your needs is an information-gathering process. This process
results in a decision which will, in many ways, determine the
direction your legal career will take.

<P>Would you prefer an urban or rural setting, a particular geographic
region, a private or public university? What kind of learning
atmosphere do you find most conducive to high performance?

<P>The School of Law is located on the main campus of Saint Louis
University, a Catholic Jesuit institution founded as St. Louis
College in 1818. It received its University charter in 1832 and
became the first university west of the Mississippi. The campus is
located in the part of the city of St. Louis known as midtown, just
a few blocks from the Fox Theatre and Powell Symphony Hall, only
five minutes from St. Louis Union Station, Missouri Botanical
Gardens, Forest Park, the St. Louis Art Museum, the St. Louis Zoo,
and the Science Center, and only ten minutes from the Arch, the
riverfront and downtown. There is a wide choice of affordable
rental housing for students in the many charming restored
neighborhoods around the University. St. Louis offers the amenities
of urban living without the inconveniences and high costs normally
associated with living in a major metropolitan area.

<P>During the summer of 1990, the School of Law completed construction
on the new south wing of the law school complex. This additional
wing expands the overall size of the building by 16,000 square
feet. It includes offices for Alumni and Development, Career
Planning and Placement, a student study lounge, student
organization office spaces, offices for the Law Journal, Public Law
Review and Moot Court, and new seminar rooms. Also included in
the new space in the law library are new library administrative
offices, a spacious student computer room, a rare book room, and
expanded audio-visual and microfiche student services. Because the
offices of individual faculty members are located in the law
library and all classrooms, administrative offices, and clinical
facilities are housed within this same building complex, students
will enjoy the convenience and collegiality that such a building
design offers.

<P>Students attending the School of Law have access to the University's Simon Recreation Center, which made the list of the
top twenty North American recreational facilities published by the
National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association. It was cited
for its open design, use of color, skylights, and responsiveness to
user needs. The Center was honored in Cologne, Germany at an
international competition involving sports and leisure facilities.
Yearly statistical information indicates that 55% of the law
students utilize this facility at least three times per week.

<HR>
<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Campus Ministry</H1>
<HR>

<P>This is a Jesuit University and we are concerned that you receive the best legal education in the nation.  But we believe that you are far more than a future lawyer.  We believe that you are a person with spirit and heart.  Campus Ministry is present throughout the University, including the law school.  It is the job of the Campus Minister to meet the "total" person during the three-five years you are with us.  He is not an administrator of the law school.  He does not teach in or work for the law school.  His office serves as a sort of sanctuary in the law school where you can leave the pressure for a time to celebrate, mourn, relax, explode . . . and be human.  His door is always open and students can speak to him in total confidentiality.

<P>He is here for all of the students, the Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Mormons, Muslims, Mohammedans, Shinto, Buddhists, Hindus, Agnostics and Atheists.  The Campus Minister sponsored two retreats last year to all who were interested.  This was an opportunity to get away, to regroup with friends, to  become quiet and organize your thoughts, a chance to talk to and meet with one another.  He also celebrates Mass once a week at a specific time and place in the law school, as well as a prayer service which is non-denominational.

<TITLE>Academic Programs</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<HR>
<H1 ALIGN="center">Academic Program</H1>
<HR>

<P>The curriculum at Saint Louis University School of Law provides
students with the opportunity for both experimentation and
specialization. Over 150 hours of challenging and interesting
courses are offered from which students choose a minimum of 88
hours to graduate.

<P>The basic goals of the curriculum are set out in the School's
mission statement:

<OL>
<LI>Provide a superb legal education in the Jesuit tradition of academic excellence and genuine concern for the development of each student;
<LI>Expose students to a wide variety of philosophical currents influencing law making and law application;
<LI>Sensitize students to ethical standards and norms, including the traditional obligation to engage in public service.
</OL>

<P>The curriculum is heavily elective and allows students both to
experiment in several areas and to concentrate in an area of
special interest. Although students generally elect many of the
courses tested on state bar examinations, the School of Law urges
students to expand their legal horizons to reflect the diversity of
the global economy in which they will function, and to develop the
ability to acquire knowledge in depth through research and analysis
in at least one area. A wide variety of small group seminars
enriches the curriculum, serving as outlets for current faculty and
student interest and experimentation.

<P>The School of Law operates full-time and part-time programs leading
to the degree of <I>juris doctor</I>. In addition, the School offers
advanced degree programs in health law and for lawyers holding a
basic law degree from a foreign country. Each of these lead to a
Master of Laws degree. The School also offers joint degree programs
in Hospital and Health Care Administration, Business
Administration, Urban Affairs and Public Administration with other
graduate programs of the University.

<H2>Degree Requirements</H2>

<P>A minimum of 88 semester hours and a cumulative grade point average
(GPA) of 2.0 is required to earn the J.D. degree. A student may
register for up to six hours of graduate courses or seminars in
other departments of the University, with the permission of the
Associate Dean.

<H2>First Year Requirements</H2>

<PRE>
FIRST SEMESTER                SECOND SEMESTER
Contracts I (3)               Contracts II (2)

<H2>Upper Division Requirements</H2>

<PRE>
Legal Profession (2-3) (Professional Ethics)
Seminar (2)
Humanistic Requirement (2) (e.g.: American Legal History, English
  Legal History, Jurisprudence, Comparative Law, other related
  seminars)
</PRE>

<P>Our legal system is based on the English Common law and the United
States Constitution. Thus, every law student should understand the
basic principles of the Common Law and the Constitution.
Additionally, because of the extraordinary growth in statutory and
regulatory law, lawyers must also know how to read and interpret
statutes and regulatory materials.

<P>In the course of their law school careers, students should ensure
that they are exposed to the important philosophical approaches to
law, to the history of law, and to ethical dimensions of problems
that confront the practitioner. The Legal Profession course and the
Humanities requirement are designed to direct students to consider
ethical and philosophical approaches to law, with the expectation
that students will receive additional exposure to such topics in
the elective portion of the curriculum.

<P>The remaining 51-52 hours may be drawn from over 100 credit hours
of elective courses, reflecting the long-standing faculty policy of
offering an extremely rich and broad based upper-division
curriculum.

<H2 ALIGN="center">A Special Note to Part-Time Students</H2>

<P>Naturally, students attending on a part-time basis must meet the
same degree requirements as those attending on a full-time basis.
The sequencing of courses varies slightly so that, in the first two
years of attendance, all first year requirements, as well as
additional requirements, are met.

<PRE>
FIRST SEMESTER                SECOND SEMESTER
Contracts I (3)               Contracts II (2)
Civil Procedure I (2)         Civil Procedure II (3)
Torts (4)                     Property (4)

THIRD SEMESTER                FOURTH SEMESTER
Taxation (4)                  Upper-division course (4)

 &amp; Writing I (2)               &amp; Writing II (3)
Constitutional Law I (3)      Humanistic requirement (2)
</PRE>

<P>Part-time students may also elect to add courses to this schedule
by registering for summer coursework. The part-time program offers
two completion options: a four-year option that requires attendance
at three summer sessions and a five-year program without summer
attendance. Both options require nine semester hours during the
fall and spring semesters. Evening classes are scheduled four
nights per week, usually Monday-Thursday, beginning at 6:00 PM and
running between two and four hours. A few courses are also offered
Saturday mornings.

<P>The part-time program of legal education is identical to the full-time program in terms of academic quality, rigor, and admissions
standards. The same faculty members are involved in teaching in
both the full- and part-time programs. Consistent with the School's
tradition of involvement with and concern for its students, every
effort is also made to provide a support system for the students to
help them adjust to the demands which legal education will make on
their already busy lives.


<H2 ALIGN="center">Opportunities for Legal Research and Writing</H2>

<IMG SRC="http://lawlib.slu.edu/lawschl/lrw.gif" ALIGN=right>
<P>Writing is at the center of what law students, lawyers, and judges do.
Without the ability to communicate effectively in writing, law students have
difficulties, lawyers lose cases, and judges let the law stumble into
unexpected error.  The same things may result from poor research or poor analysis.
Thus, the fundamental skills of researching, analyzing, and
communicating the law are stressed throughout the law student's years at the
School of Law.

<P>Although several upper-class opportunities exist for the development of legal
research and writing skills, the groundwork is laid in the first year in a
required, five credit-hour course taken over two semesters in small group
settings (this course falls during the second year of attendance for students
in the part-time program).  This course is the main activity of the Legal
Research and Writing Program.  The program's instructors are usually full-time
members of the teaching faculty with significant experience as
practicing attorneys and legal academics.  In addition to the instructors,
students have upper-class teaching assistants who provide both oral and
written comments on draft assignments throughout the year-long course.
Although the main goal of the program is to build the student's ability in
legal writing, the course places great emphasis on related legal skills, such
as case and statutory analysis, research strategies, and computer assisted
research methods.

<P>After successful completion of Legal Research and Writing, students have
additional opportunities to develop their writing skills.  Each student must
take a seminar during the second or third year. Seminars require research
papers which must go through at least two drafts, as well as
student presentations. Students have additional writing
opportunities in selected courses such as Estate Planning and Land Use Control
where papers are part of the required work product. The Civil Practice course,
which is part of the Professional Skills cluster, requires almost weekly
writing assignments.  The school has a large number of seminars.  There were 37 offered last year alone.

<P>A number of other upper division courses include additional opportunities to
write.  Students may also engage in directed research
activities and obtain academic credit for close research work with
individual members of the faculty. To help ensure a high level of
supervision, faculty members are limited to working with no more
than two such students during a given semester. The <I>Saint Louis
University Law Journal</I> and the <I>Public Law Review</I>, <I>The Saint Louis-Warsaw Transatlantic Law Journa</I>, <I>The Journal of Health and Hospital Law</I>, and <I>The Fidelity and Surety News</I>, as well as the
Moot Court program, provide further opportunities for students to
produce different types of legal writing which will be edited and
criticized by others. Law librarians provide one-on-one
training in implementation of effective practical research
strategies on a continuing basis throughout students' law school
careers.

<H2 ALIGN="center">Ethics</H2>

<P>Law students are confronted with important ethical and value issues from the
very beginning of new legal careers.  A student ethics regulation is distributed to incoming students and discussed
during orientation.  An introductory course on ethics was added to the 1994
orientation program.  The Thomas C. Deline Program in Legal Ethics exposes
incoming students to ethical problems of the sort that both lawyers and non-lawyers face.  During orientation, a 5-hour introductory course is organized
around a series of problems that students discuss and then prepare written
papers proposing possible resolutions.  Small group discussion leaders include
teaching faculty, as well as members of the practicing bar.

<P>Upperclass students take a required course, legal profession, which focuses on
the question, "What ought a person do as a lawyer?" in all of the contexts in
which a lawyer functions in our social system.  It does so both in the narrow
context of applicable rules of professional conduct and in the broader
cultural context in which these rules are understood.

<P>In addition, faculty raise ethics issues in other courses when the opportunity
presents itself.  For example, ethics issues are raised in the Property Law
course on such issues as allocating responsibilities for quality in rental
housing, and using private and public land use control techniques to exclude
people.  A number of seminars raising ethical questions are offered on a
regular basis, such as Ethical Issues in Death and Dying.  The clinical
programs have the ability to expose students to ethical issues in live
settings.  Coursework associated with the externship programs focuses on legal ethics.  This year, the Law School began an ethics colloquium for graduating students, to capstone their ethical training.


<H2 ALIGN="center">Seminars</H2>

<P>Each semester approximately fifteen to twenty seminars are offered, including some
scheduled during the evening hours. While the vast
majority of seminars are taught by full-time faculty, several
seminars are taught by adjunct faculty who practice in specialized
areas of law (e.g., Trademark, Deferred Compensation, and Selected
Topics in Labor Law). Approximately half of the seminars offered
each semester are available on a yearly basis, while others are
offered in alternating years.

<P>Sufficient flexibility is reserved for the emergence of new
seminars which focus on current topics of interest or seminars
taught by distinguished visiting faculty. Several seminars which
are taught from a humanities perspective (jurisprudential,
historical, literary, etc.) fulfill both the School's humanities
and seminar requirements for graduation.

<P>Seminar enrollment is generally limited to twelve students,
although in exceptional cases (and with the permission of the
instructor), up to fifteen students may be enrolled.

<H2 ALIGN="center">Academic Planning</H2>

<P>The curriculum offers difficult choices. Over 150 hours are
offered, yet only 88 are required to graduate. The modern law
school curriculum reflects the complexity of legal rules which
students will encounter in the practice of law.

<P>With so few required courses and so much to choose from, it becomes
important that decisions about course selections have a focus.
Legal education should be a liberal education. Law school is a time
to sample areas with which one may be unfamiliar.

<P>Much attention has been devoted to the development of practical
skills courses. Two major values of the practical skills courses
are the dramatization of the necessity for mastery of theoretical
concepts and the importance of the ethical considerations lawyers
must face. Exposure to a practical skills course will also assist
in developing personal strengths and weaknesses in oral advocacy,
writing, etc.

<P>The Law School has an extensive academic advising program.  Advising sessions are scheduled during Spring registration.
Students are urged to attend to take advantage of the variety of
views of academic planning that the faculty represents. Each
student selects a faculty advisor.  The importance of developing strong  professional
skills and values is reflected in the booklet, <I>Planning a
Course of Study</I>, developed by the Law School Curriculum Committee
and the Dean's Office.  This booklet is distributed in the spring to full-time students and to part-time students during the fall semester of the second year.

<P>In addition to general advising sessions, academic training workshops are available to all first and second year students.  These workshops focus on developing the academic skills necessary to succeed in law school.  They cover topics such as: critical reading; legal analysis and reasoning; effective study groups; and exam preparation and practice.  The workshops are conducted by a full-time academic counselor who is available throughout the year for individual academic advising.

planning their law school career.

<HR>

<P>The School of Law has enjoyed a remarkable placement record.  With 92% of '95 graduates responding, 92.3% were employed within six months of graduation compared to the national median of 86.7% with 92% reporting.

<P>Previous years' rates were equally impressive:

<PRE>
   Class    SLU    National

   1994     95%    85%
   1993     93%    83.5%
   1992     91%    85%
</PRE>

<P>The Office of Career Services is designed to assist
students, alumni and employers. Students and alumni are welcome
to utilize the services of the office throughout their academic
and legal careers. These services include career counseling,
assistance in developing resumes and letters, access to job
postings, an alumni job bulletin, assistance in the job search
for other geographic areas, and on-campus interviews for current
students. The office houses a career library which has
information on a wide range of employers and career choices,
including government job bulletins, books and brochures on a
variety of practice areas and placement bulletins from law
schools throughout the United States.  The resources of the
Career Library are available in an annotated format to assist
students in finding resources, and information about additional
resources in the Law School Library is also available. The office
lists positions for student clerks, summer positions, full-time
positions for recent graduates, and positions for attorneys with
experience. In order to assist students in finding additional
information about employers, the Lexis/Nexis and Westlaw computer
research services are also available in the Career Library.

<P>To help students choose wisely from their career options, the
office sponsors many programs throughout the year on such topics
as health law, international law, corporate practice, government
practice, public interest options, judicial clerkships, and
private practice in firms of varying sizes. While a law degree cannot guarantee a job, the skills acquired thorugh a legal education can equip graduates to function effectively in the complex world of the next century.  Student surveys are
conducted to insure that program needs are meeting student
interests. In addition, programs and workshops are conducted by
the Assistant Dean and Assistant Director on job search
techniques. The Assistant Dean for Career Planning and Placement
has co-authored a resource guide to alternative careers for
lawyers for the National Association for Law Placement.

<P>As a member school in the National Association for Law Placement,
Saint Louis University participates in a number of regional job
fairs. These include the Midwest Public Interest Career Fair, the
  Chicago Regional Job Fair, the MAP Washington D.C. Job Fair,
the    Midwest BALSA Job Fair, and the Patent Law Job Fair. In
addition,    Saint Louis University has been instrumental in
establishing a first year minority summer clerkship program with
three other law schools in the area. The program has been in
place since 1989 and has expanded since it was established. The
alumni directory has been effectively utilized in assisting
students in meeting graduates practicing throughout the country.
Trips to areas outside of St. Louis by the Assistant Dean and
contact with alumni have been very helpful in assisting students
in gaining employment outside of the St. Louis area.

<P>Approximately 64% of the graduates enter private practice; 14%
accept judicial clerkships; 10% take positions with the
government; 16.8% are employed by the business sector. Smaller
numbers enter areas such as legal services, public defender
offices, graduate education, banks, and accounting firms.
Approximately 95% of the class of 1994 was employed within six
months of graduation as compared with the national average of
85%. Salaries ranged from $20,000 - $70,000.  The median salary in the private sector was $45,000, in the public sector, $29,000.  Alumni practice in
all 50 states and several foreign countries, the majority are
practicing in the midwest region, especially in the states of
Illinois and Missouri.

<title>The Master of Laws Degree</title>
<meta name="keywords" content="LL.M., LLM, foreign lawyers, American law, master of laws">
</head>

<body>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">The Master of Laws Degree (LL.M.) In American Law for Foreign Lawyers</h2>

<hr>

<p>The School of Law, through the Center for International and Comparative Law, offers a one year graduate program leading to a Master of Laws degree (LL.M.) for lawyers holding a basic law degree from a foreign country. The principal objective of this program is to provide a select group of highly qualified individuals with the opportunity to pursue studies and research in American law. It is designed primarily for students whose first degree in law was received at a foreign university which did not instruct in the common law system.

<p>For the academic year 1994-1995, five students were accepted from China, Croatia and Germany.  In previous years students were admitted from China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Nepal, Poland, Russia and Spain.  Mr. Carsten Alting, had his LL.M thesis published in the Spring 1995 issue of the <I>Tulsa Journal of International and Comparative Law</I>.  Simone Haug, another graduate of the program had her LL.M thesis accepted for publication by the <I>Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law</I>.

<p>The purpose of the program is three-fold: to facilitate and improve understanding of the American legal system, particularly in its practical application; to provide a solid framework for advanced legal research; and to provide specialized training that would be of use in law practice, law teaching, or legal scholarship in the candidate's own country.

<p>The LL.M. Program for Foreign Lawyers requires a total of twenty-four (24) hours of credit, including a written thesis of publishable quality. A student is required to present an oral defense of the thesis before a faculty committee. Four credit hours are awarded upon satisfactory completion of the thesis. Depending upon  the student's specific interest, a faculty member will be appointed as an advisor to supervise the student's thesis. With the consent of the Program Director, a student may elect to substitute two seminars (each with a major writing component) for the written thesis requirement.

<p>The remaining twenty hours are to be completed by taking courses offered by the School of Law under the Juris Doctor (J.D.) curriculum. An LL.M. student may, in consultation with the advisor, choose any course from the regular curriculum.

<p>The LL.M. Program offers students an opportunity to specialize in areas of particular interest. The School of law offers specialized curricula in the areas of Health Law, Employment Law and International and Comparative Law. Concentrations in business and commercial law, and
criminal law and procedure are also available.  Faculty members are available to work with students in their particular areas of interest.

<p>Efforts will be made to create an opportunity to participate in unpaid externships at law firms in the area. Students may receive up to three hours of credit for such work.

<p>All examinations are written. Examination criteria for foreign students are the same as those for J.D. students. However, where English is not the student's first language, additional time will beallotted and the use of an English-foreign language dictionary will be permitted.

<p>It is expected that a student will obtain the LL.M. degree in 10-12 months (two full semesters plus 2-4 months to complete and defend the thesis).  The fall semester begins in the third week of August and ends in the middle of December; the spring semester starts in the middle of January and ends in the middle of May.

<h3><a name="adm"></a>Admissions Procedures and Requirements</h3>

All applicants to the LL.M. Program for Foreign Lawyers must meet two basic formal requirements:

<ol>
  <li>Completion of a degree in law from a foreign university;</li>
  <li>Proficiency in the English language, both written and spoken. If English is not the first language, the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) should be taken. A minimumscore of 575 should be attained.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Complete applications should be received by May 15. Every effort will be made to expedite the decision-making process to provide accepted students sufficient time to make necessary arrangements.

<p>LL.M. students will be assessed the same tuition as J.D. students. A limited number of scholarships in the form of partial tuition remission are available.  Therefore, students should explore loan or assistance programs in their own country.

<title>International Exchange Programs</title>
</head>
<body>

<hr>
<h2 align="center">International Exchange Programs</h2>
<hr>
 
To complement the course offerings in international law, the School offers a number of special
opportunities in  foreign legal study.

<h3><a name="french"></a>The Post-JD <i>Licence</i> in French Law</h3>

The Saint Louis University School of Law, through the Center for International and Comparative
Law is currently looking into the establishment of an international post-JD degree program in
conjunction with the Universit&eacute; d'Orl&eacute;ans, France. The program will be a four year course of
study resulting in both an American Juris Doctorate and a <u>Licence</u> in French Law.  Students in
this program must complete eighty-eight (88) hours of class work at the Saint Louis University
School of Law and thirty (30) hours  at the Universit&eacute; d'Orl&eacute;ans. Upon completion of this
program, students would be eligible to sit for the bar examination in the United States, and, upon
completion of an apprenticeship in France, they may become eligible to sit for the bar
examination in France. <p>

The Universit&eacute; d'Orl&eacute;ans is located in Orl&eacute;ans, France, some forty-five minutes south of Paris by
train. Orl&eacute;ans is a charming and historic city -- the birth place of  Joan of Arc.  It is located in the
beautiful Loire Valley, known for its string of castles and Napoleon's famous hunting grounds.

<h3><a name="brussels"></a>The Brussels Seminar</h3>

The School of Law, together with the University of Georgia, is a co-sponsor of the Brussels
Seminar on Law and Institutions of the European Union held annually in Brussels, Belgium. The
School selects ten students to study at the Seminar each year.   The Seminar receives support
from and is held at the Institute of European Studies, Universit&eacute; Libre de Bruxelles and Vrije
Universiteit Brussel.  Each year some 30 students from various law schools in the United States
attend the Seminar. They receive free tuition, free study materials, and free accommodation and
breakfast. A minimal fee is charged to cover educational and sightseeing trips to Luxembourg
and Bruges.<p>

Professors from the two universities in Brussels, judges of the European Court of Justice, and
staff members of the European Commission deliver lectures. Students  attend a hearing before
the European Court of Justice and have a meeting with several judges of the Court; they also visit
the European Commission. The seminar concludes with an examination graded by a committee
of European professors. After the conclusion of the Seminar, the students may participate in a
session of the Hague Academy of International Law.

<h3><a name="ruhr"></a>The Ruhr University Program</h3>

The Center has a cooperative agreement with the Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany, for
annual student exchanges.  The exchange includes a trip by Saint Louis University students to
Bochum and English lectures from German professors on Civil Law. The stay includes several
trips within Germany. This program is held just prior to the Brussels Seminar.  Students selected
for the Brussels program may also enroll in the Bochum program.<p>

<h3><a name="indep"></a>Independent Exchange Programs</h3>
The Saint Louis University School of Law maintains cooperative relationships with the
Universit&eacute; of Orl&eacute;ans, France, Warsaw University, Poland, and Sichuan University, China.
Unique opportunities are thus available especially to students with the appropriate language
skills and background. <p>

The International Law Society maintains an up-to-date portfolio on the many exchange programs
available through other universities. These programs offer students the opportunity to visit the
country and culture of their choice.  Independent exchange programs may be considered in
satisfying the requirements for the Certificate in International and Comparative Law.   <p>

Under the rules of the American Bar Association (ABA), the Saint Louis University School of
Law will consider accepting a certain number of hours of credit toward the JD degree for courses
taken at foreign law schools.  Prior approval is required from the Office of the Dean of the Law
School.

<h3><a name="step"></a>The Student Trainee Exchange Program -- STEP </h3>

The Saint Louis University School of Law, through its International Law Society, offers students
the opportunity to participate in the Student Trainee Exchange Program (STEP). The STEP
program arranges international summer internships with foreign law firms. The program is a
cooperative effort between the International Law Society and the European Law Students
Association (ELSA) to promote international legal experiences.

<P><STRONG>Moot Court:</STRONG>  The School of Law sponsors an active Moot Court program for upper-level students in the full-time day and part-time evening divisions.  The
School also sponsors one or more teams of students in regional and national
Moot Court competition.

<P>The intramural Moot Court program is divided into two parts.  During Moot
Court I, students write an appellate brief under the supervision of Moot Court
Board members.  Participants then engage in a series of three oral arguments
(one of which is off-brief).

<P>The top 32 students in Moot Court I are invited to participate in Moot Court
II during the second semester.  Participants in Moot Court II engage in two
qualifying rounds of oral arguments, culminating in a semi-final and final
round of arguments.  The final arguments are held before a large audience at
the School of Law.  Guest judges in past years have included United States
Supreme Court Justices William H. Rehnquist and Antonin Scalia, members of the
United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth, Seventh, and Third Circuits,
and justices of the Eastern District of Missouri and the Missouri Supreme
Court.  Participants in Moot Court II receive one hour of academic credit.
Finalists receive cash prizes.  The Moot Court II problem occasionally tracks
the National Moot Court topic.  United States Supreme Court procedural rules
govern the conduct of Moot Court II.

<P>The Moot Court Board is composed of third-year students who formerly
participated in Moot Court II.  The Moot Court Board administers the Moot
Court program, under the supervision of the faculty advisor.  During the first
semester, board members are responsible for assisting participants in Moot
Courts I and II in mastering the skills of appellate brief writing and oral
argument.  Six board members comprise the National Moot Court team.

<P>Over the past two years, our students advanced past the Regionals to the
Finals twice in the National Moot Court Competition, and once in the Frederick
Douglass Moot Court Competition, the Jessup International Moot Court
Competition, and the Trial Advocacy Competition.  The year before last, students
competing in the National Moot Court Competition placed among the top 16 teams in the
country; the students competing in the Jessup International Moot Court
Competition placed 8th in the country and 24th in the world.

<P><EM>Client Counseling:</EM>  This ABA sponsored competition provides students an
opportunity to learn about the all important skill of effective, ethical, and
responsible interviewing and counseling of clients.  The competition is open
to students who are enrolled in one client counselling course.  Students
compete in teams of two.  The teams conduct simulated interviews of clients
and are judged by a panel of two lawyers and one nonlegal counselor.  The best
two teams compete in the regional competition sponsored by the ABA in which
several law schools from the midwest participate.

<h2>I.  GENERAL ADVICE</h2>

<p>The student in health law courses works not only with unique doctrinal areas of law but also with
law as applied to the largest industry in the U.S. economy and to intensely personal human
problems.  Most of the health law courses involve the application of law to the sometimes atypical
demands of the health care setting and so involve the student in advanced study of basic areas of
law such as administrative law, constitutional law, torts, and business law.

<p>For students interested in health law, we generally conceptualize the School of Law's offerings
into two "traditional" patterns that students, and the practice, seem to follow.  The first area tends
to focus on medical malpractice and litigation, and the second focuses on the law of health care
institutions and enterprises.   The two areas are not mutually exclusive and, depending upon
career goals, students will find it useful to attempt to become somewhat familiar with both areas,
while emphasizing one over the other.  Some of the courses,  seminars, and professional skills
opportunities involved in each of the two areas would more narrowly be viewed as pure  "health
law" offerings,  while others are applicable to a wide variety of substantive settings but have clear
relevance to health law or include health law topics.

<p>Students should also be aware of other course offerings related to Health Law, in other parts of
the University.  For example, the School of Public Health offers a variety of graduate level
courses in areas such as health care organization, health care administration, epidemiology, public
health administration and health policy.  Students are permitted to take up to six hours of
coursework toward their J.D. degree outside the Law School.  Permission of Dean Szaj is
required before enrolling in these courses.

<hr>

<h2>II.  CERTIFICATE IN HEALTH LAW</h2>

<p>The Certificate in Health Law recognizes J.D. students who complete a required course of study
and co-curricular activities in health law.  The Certificate Program joins the School's other
academic programs in health law -- the joint degree program (in which students receive both the
J.D. and the Master's degree in Health Care Administration) and the graduate law program (in
which attorneys earn the LL.M. in Health Care Law).  Information on the joint J.D./M.H.A.
program is available from the School of Public Health.  Information on the LL.M. in Health Care
Law program is available from the School of Law's admissions office.

<ol type="A">
<li>Students must complete four requirements to earn the Certificate in Health Law:</li>
  <ol>
  <li>Certificate students must take and pass a minimum of ten credit hours in specialized
health law courses.  Courses and seminars which may be used to satisfy this requirement
are noted below.</li>
  <li>Certificate students must also gain supervised experience in a health law practice
setting.  Students may satisfy this requirement by establishing, with the guidance of a
faculty member, a non-credit externship in a practice setting (ordinarily with a
government agency, a non-profit provider, or advocacy organization) or by submitting
evidence of completion of substantial part-time or summer employment in a health law
setting which included significant research and drafting relating to health care law.
Students may also satisfy this requirement by enrolling in the School's Health Law Clinic
or Externship Program.</li>
  <li>Students must submit a publishable paper on an issue in health law to be reviewed and
approved by the Director of the School's Center for Health Law Studies.</li>
  <li>Finally, the student must participate in the Center's Colloquia in Health Care Law during
his or her second year of law studies.  The Colloquium Series, which will provide
students with an opportunity to explore contemporary issues in health law with both
outside speakers and University faculty, will meet on at least six occasions during the
year at dates and times to be arranged.  A description of the topics to be covered in the
year's colloquia series will be available early in each academic year.</li>
  <br>All law students are invited to attend the colloquia.  Students in the Health Law
Certificate Program are required to (1) register for at least four of the meetings with
Ms. Jauer in Room 240; (2) read the assigned materials in advance of the colloquia; (3)
attend and sign in at the four meetings; and (4) after each meeting attended, write and
submit to Ms. Jauer a short evaluation of the information presented in the materials and
at the colloquium.   </li>
  </ol>
  <li>To be awarded an "Honors Certificate in Health Law" a graduating student must complete the
requirements of the certificate program with a grade point average in health law courses equal
to or greater than that required to graduate <u>cum laude</u>.</li>
  <li>A student who wishes to pursue the Certificate in Health Law Program must declare his or her
intention to do so not later than the conclusion of the first month of the student's third semester
in law school by completing an application available from Ms. Mary Ann Jauer in Room 240.</li>
  <li>Special Notes</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Part-time students: The Certificate in Health Law is available to part-time students who
have sufficiently flexible schedules to meet the program's requirements.</li>
    <li>Seminar registration: Remember that you must register for seminars on the separate
seminar registration form and that you should check the Health Law Certificate box on
the form if you are pursuing the Certificate.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<h2>IV. COURSE SEQUENCING AND DIRECTED RESEARCH  </h2>

<p>Students should plan on taking several of the health law offerings spread over the course of their
program.  Given the relative richness of the health law curriculum at this School, students should
not expect to take all or even a majority of the pure "health law" courses and seminars which are
offered.

<p>In the pure "Health Law" offerings there are no pre-requisites.  It is helpful to enroll in Health
Law as early in the student's career as possible, as it may provide a useful perspective for other
courses, particularly the seminars.

<p>Evidence is a pre-requisite for Trial Advocacy I, which in turn is a pre-requisite for Trial
Advocacy II.  Evidence should thus be taken as early as possible for those interested in medical
malpractice.
<h3>A Note on Directed Research:</h3>

<p>You should not ignore the possibility of doing a Directed Research project on a health law topic
at any time after you complete the first year research and writing course.  A significant number of
faculty have health law interests.  In the descriptions below of the health law courses and seminars
the names of the faculty who teach in the particular area are noted. You can use this as a guide in
determining which individual faculty member ought to be approached, given the general area
which you are interested in exploring.  Ordinarily this should be done at the beginning of the
registration period.

<p>After ascertaining faculty availability to supervise you and willingness to work with you in the
area you have identified, you will be asked to provide the faculty member with a brief summary or
outline of the proposed project before approval is granted to enroll in directed research.
Thereafter, a detailed outline, and first and second drafts will generally be required.

<h2>V.  EXTRACURRICULAR PROGRAMS:</h2>

<p>The students of the School of Law have formed a Student Health Law Association which
regularly sponsors a series of programs, often in conjunction with the School's Center for Health
Law Studies.  There is an active Saint Louis University Law School Alumni in Health Law group
which serves as a vehicle for alumni to keep in touch with each other and for the Center to keep in
touch with them.  The Center publishes a Newsletter for alumni and students and maintains a
directory of alumni.

<p>Each year the Center, together with the Saint Louis University Law Journal, sponsors a one day
conference on a health law topic.  Papers presented at the conference (together with other health
law writings) are published each year in the annual health law issue of the Law Journal, the oldest
of its kind in the country.

<h2>VI. COURSE DESCRIPTIONS</h2>

<h3>A. Health Law Courses, Seminars and Clinical Opportunities     </h3>

<DL>

<DT><strong>Health Law </strong> (3 hours)
<dd>This is the basic survey course in health law.  It typically covers quality control regulation
(including licensing of professionals and health care institutions, private accreditation, and peer
review, including staff privileges); legal issues relating to the structure of health care institutions
and to access to health care; medical malpractice; and a brief introduction to bioethics, among
other issues.  This basic survey course provides a helpful, though not required, background for the
other health law courses.  (Johnson, Goldner)

<dt><strong>Food and Drug Law</strong> (3 hours)
<dd>[It is expected that faculty approval will be sought to offer this as a three hour course for the
Spring, 1997.]  The following is the existing seminar description.  This seminar will examine the
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and explore just what it is that the Food and Drug
Administration does.  Students will be exposed to such topics as (i) FDA regulation of food
labeling (for example, nutritional content labeling requirements); (ii) FDA standards for food
identity and quality; (iii) just what is a "drug"; (iv) prescription drug labeling and promotion; (v)
FDA pre-marketing review of new drugs; (vi) biologies; (vii) medical devices; and (viii) FDA
enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act -- as the FDA itself put it, the FDA as a
"scientifically oriented law enforcement agency."  Students will have the opportunity to hear
presentations by guest lecturers providing different perspectives on the FDA.  Requirements for
the seminar include:  (i) attendance and participation in seminar meetings; (ii) seminar paper
(including a first draft); and (iii) presentation of the seminar paper.  (Heath)

<dt><strong>Law and Bioethics</strong> (2 hours)

<dt><strong>Health Care Financing &amp; Business Planning</strong> (3 hours)
<dd>This three hour course will focus on regulatory and business aspects of health care practice.
Particular attention will be placed on bringing to bear various areas of law (e.g., corporate, tax,
antitrust, fraud and abuse) in advising clients on structuring health care organizations.  The course
will also examine closely various state and federal health reform proposals.

<br>The introductory Health Care Law course is a prerequisite or corequisite.  The course will meet
two hours per week and students will be required to do a project consisting of a brief-writing,
drafting, negotiation or other written exercises in addition to the exam.  The professor may allow
an optional paper in lieu of an exam.  (Greaney)

<dt><strong>Health Care Provider Liability</strong> (2 hours)
<dd>This course focuses on private law responses to quality of care and autonomy issues involving
health care providers and their consumers.  The course examines the competing and overlapping
liability models applied to health care providers, and the liability exposure of different provider
groups, from individual health care professionals through provider groups to third party payors
and drug and device manufacturers.  The course covers the full range of litigation issues including
expert and scientific evidence, causation, damages, and insurance issues as they relate to HCPs.
Additionally, considerable attention is paid to the effect of statutory reforms, ranging from
qualifications of experts through limitations on certain types of damage recovery to mandated
dispute resolution mechanisms.  (Terry)

<dt><strong>Directed Research</strong> (1-3 hours)
<dd>Each faculty member is able to supervise up to two students each semester in a directed research
project for one or two credit hours.  Arrangements must be made with individual faculty.  Faculty
with interests in health law areas include Professors Gilchrist, Goldner, Greaney, Heath, Johnson,
Terry and Wolff.

<dt><strong>SEM: Advanced Competition Issues</strong> (2 hours)
<dd>This seminar will examine antitrust and unfair competition issues in a variety of contexts.
Emphasis will be placed on application of these areas of law to the health care industry and
perhaps certain regulated industries such as telecommunications.  In addition, the class will study
the competition law of the European Community and its member states.  Students may write their
seminar papers on any topic involving competition law.  Antitrust law is a prerequisite or co-requisite with permission of the instructor.  (Greaney)

<dt><strong>SEM: Child Abuse and Neglect and The Law</strong> (2)
<dd>The seminar reviews legal issues and public policy questions which frequently arise in child abuse
and neglect cases.  It includes discussions of the various stages of maltreatment cases as they
proceed through the legal system, from the initial report of maltreatment through post-dispositional activities.  The seminar examines a number of complex issues such as how and when
the state should intervene in suspected cases of abuse and neglect, when social service workers
should be held liable for their actions (or failure to act) in child maltreatment cases, and what
ethical questions the attorney is likely to encounter in abuse and neglect cases.

<br>The seminar requires graded first and final drafts of a paper on a topic selected by the student in
consultation with the instructor, as well as a presentation of the paper to the class. (Goldner)

<dt><strong>SEM: Deferred Compensation</strong> (2)

thought about ethical theory in the context of an examination of leading cases.  Issues covered in
the seminar include consent, health care decision making, human experimentation, refusals of
treatment and withdrawal of nutrition and hydration.  The grade is based on two writing
assignments.  In the first, students critique the ethical analysis of a judicial opinion in the area.  In
the second, students draft an opinion in a hypothetical case developed from case studies in health
care.  This seminar is taught by Dennis Brodeur who is Vice-President for Stewardship of the
Sisters of St. Mary Health Care System, a multi-facility health care system in the Midwest.  Prior
to joining the SSM Health Care System, Dr. Brodeur was Associate Director of the Center for
Health Care Ethics at the University's Medical Center.  Students enrolled in this seminar should
not enroll in the Bioethics course.

privacy, confidentiality and disclosure of genetic conditions; human reproductive health decisions,
among others.  (Johnson)

<dt><strong>SEM: Health Care Law &amp; Aging</strong> (2)
<dd>The proportion of elderly persons in the population of the United States is rapidly increasing and
the age of the elderly population itself is increasing.  Within ten years, nearly half of the elderly
will be 75 years old and older.  These demographic changes have implications for health care
delivery and financing and for patients' rights.  This seminar examines legal issues relating to the
aging population, including health care financing; health care allocation, including major public
benefit programs; state and federal quality-control regulation in long-term care; and legal issues in
informed consent and surrogate decisionmaking.

<br>Up to five students will be able to receive humanities credit for the seminar with <u>prior</u> approval of
the instructor.  Students seeking humanities credit will prepare papers focusing on an analysis of
historical, ethical or comparative perspectives of a particular issue in law and aging.

<br>The seminar will require a graded first draft and graded final draft of the paper as well as a
presentation of the student's paper to the class.  (Johnson)

<dt><strong>SEM: Law &amp; Psychiatry</strong>  (2)
<dd>Participants in the seminar include up to twelve law students and six to eight psychiatry resident
physicians.  During the initial two weeks, the law students will be given a general introduction to
psychiatric diagnosis and treatment while the residents will receive a similar introduction to law
and the legal system.  During the next eight weeks all participants will meet jointly.

<br>The goals of the seminar are to expose the participants to the following topics:  Legal aspects of
providing mental health treatment, including such issues as regulation and quality control,
therapist-patient confidentiality, medical malpractice, informed consent, and the liability to third
parties harmed by a patient; issues relating to the liberty and property interests of mentally
disabled persons, including the legal impact of expert opinions, mental disability and the criminal
law, legal competency, the civil commitment system, and the right to treatment; benefits and

Students will negotiate agreements, write legal memoranda, and draft documents in teams
representing various client groups -- e.g., physicians, hospitals, third party payors and employers.
Teams will be supervised by attorneys actively involved in such contracting in their practice.  In
addition to drafting documents in connection with simulations, students will be required to write a
memorandum on a point of law.  <u>Health Law is a prerequisite</u>.

<dt><strong>SEM: Medical Licensure and Discipline:  Impact on Health Care Decisionmaking</strong> (2)
<dd>This seminar will examine legal and policy issues in the licensure and discipline of the health care
professions, including:  The impact of scope of practice regulation on access to care; the relation
between disciplinary standards and ethics (using the example of sexual misconduct); the allocation
of authority among the legislature, the agency and the courts (using the example of
nonconforming or innovative treatments); and procedural issues in a disciplinary action.
<br>A substantial portion of this seminar will focus on the scope and impact of the disciplinary system
upon access to health care and the use of medication for the relief of pain.

<dt><strong>SEM: Not-for-Profit Organizations</strong> (2)
<dd>Mr. Ruger is a partner at the law firm of Peper, Martin, Jensen, Maichel, and Hetlage.  Ms. Davis

of officers and directors, and their liability under the common law and state corporation laws, is
an integral part of the course.

<DT><strong>Civil Practice</strong> (3)
<DD>Civil Practice focuses on practical, theoretical, and ethical issues in pre-trial civil litigation practice
through lecture and discussion and emphasizes the development of practice skills through
simulation exercises in client interviewing, fact investigation, pleading, formal discovery

class also focuses on the underlying assumptions and substantive rules affecting regulation of
public utilities and "natural monopolies."  While the course will study a number of regulated
industries (such as power, communications, airlines, banking, and health), its focus will be on the
legal, administrative and public policy issues raised by different modes of regulation.  Students
may be offered the option of writing a paper in lieu of a final exam.

in light of the judicial process and results achieved by courts.  Guest speakers, videotaped
illustrations of the processes and student problem/simulations will be employed.  Each student will
write and present a seminar paper on which the final grade will be based.  This seminar does not
duplicate the arbitration or negotiation seminar, although occasionally similar topics will be discussed.

<DT><strong>SEM: Arbitration</strong> (2)
<DD>The subject is arbitration with emphasis on labor arbitration.  In the first three or four meetings,
students will be introduced to arbitration practice and basis arbitration law developed through the
U.S. Supreme Court decisions.  thereafter, students will present papers on specific topics or
prepared on the basis of transcripts and documentary evidence.

<DT><strong>SEM: Deferred Compensation</strong> (2)
<DD>This seminar is designed to introduce students to the qualified retirement plan area.  Much time

<DT><strong>SEM: Preventive Lawyering in Corporate Practice</strong> (2)
<DD>In light of increasing criminalization of corporate conduct, and expanding theories of tort liability,
little doubt exists that the current high level of corporate exposure in litigation will continue.
Directors, officers, and managers confront legal antitrust, environmental, product and workplace
safety, securities, and employment discrimination statutes and regulations.  Adoption of the
federal sentencing guidelines for corporate defendants has resulted in heightened awareness of the
importance of corporate compliance programs in recent years.  The corporate clients's legal
advisors can suggest steps to be taken by management to anticipate and avoid legal
entanglements, or mitigate their impact.
<DD>The seminar will address the range of compliance programs and preventive law techniques
appropriate for adoption by large and small business clients.  We will consider both the substance
and process of structuring and implementing corporate compliance programs and periodic legal
audits to prevent violation of legal rules and to maximize future rights.  Ethical considerations of
nonadversarial lawyering will also be discussed.  Each student will be expected to submit a
substantial paper developing a compliance program in a substantive law area of interest, and to
present his or her recommendations for consideration by other seminar participants sitting as a
corporate board of directors.  (Weinberger)

<DT><strong>SEM: Social Science and the Law</strong> (2)
<DD>This seminar is taught by Dr. Richard Weiner, Professor of Psychology.  It examines social
science and law as it is used to resolve disputes, formulate public policy, and develop an empirical
understanding of the legal system.  We will examine the use of social science to determine factual
issues specific to a particular case, establish legal rules that set precedent for future disputes,
provide context or background for determining facts important only to a specific case, shape the
court system and set public policy, and assist attorneys in preparing for litigation.  While
examining these themes we will study functioning of juries, death qualification, the death penalty,
rules of evidence, tort liability of special seizures, criminal defenses, custody mediation, alternative
forms of dispute resolution, changing venue, juror selection, and jury instructions.  Each student
will write a paper on the use of social science in either one of the above areas or another area
negotiated with the instructor.  This class meets on Tuesdays and Thursday at 9:30 a.m. in
Shannon Hall, Room 203.  (Wiener)

<DT><strong>SEM: White Collar Crime</strong>  (2)
<DD>This course will cover general white collar crime, including consumer fraud, health care fraud, tax
fraud, securities fraud, election fraud and official corruption.  It will be taught by one experienced
white collar crime prosecutor and a circuit court judge (former white collar crime prosecutor) and
will accentuate the practical as well as the legal aspects and methods of prosecuting and defending
white collar crime.  It will be the instructors' aim to make the course as practical as possible,
concentrating on actual situations and trials encountered by them in their practice.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">SLU Ranked First -- Again</H2>

For the second consecutive year,
the SLU health law program was ranked first among health law programs
in the nation's law schools.  A survey conducted by and published
in the U.S. News &amp; World Report in March reported the top
ten health law programs.  The program at the University of Houston
tied with Saint Louis University for first place this year.  The
survey has been published for five years.  The SLU program has
ranked either first or second in each of those years.

<HR>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="new">New Journals, New Ph.D. Program, New Seminar</A></H2>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Journal of Health and Hospital Law</H3>

The <I>Journal of Health
and Hospital Law</I>, published by the American Academy of Health
Care Attorneys of the American Hospital Association, will move
to the Center for Health Law Studies this Fall.  The Journal will
be published quarterly and will cover a full range of health care
law issues, with particular attention to the legal questions of
concern to health care providers and their attorneys.  Professors
Jesse Goldner and Tim Greaney will be co-editors-in-chief of the
Journal.  They will be assisted by an attorney managing editor,
who will work at the Center, and by a student editorial staff.

<P>Professors Goldner and Greaney will work closely with the leadership
and membership of the Academy, as well as with other Center faculty,
in soliciting and reviewing articles.  Articles written by Academy
members and other health care attorneys are welcome and may be
directed to Professors Goldner and Greaney.The AAHA Publications
Committee selected the Center for Health Law Studies as the new
home for the Journal, pending approval by the Board of the AHA.
 Members of the Committee who were actively involved in the selection
process included Jack Spalding Schroder, Jr., a partner in Alston
&amp; Bird and chair of the Committee; Beth Shermer, a partner
in Lewis and Roca; Jerry Bell, a partner in Fulbright &amp; Jaworski;
and Gerald Sill, Senior Vice President and General Counsel of
the Missouri Hospital Association.

<P>The <I>Journal of Health
and Hospital Law</I> is the second journal to move to Saint Louis
University, joining the <I>Journal of Law and Human Behavior</I>
which was announced in the previous edition of the newsletter.
 Dr. Richard Wiener, of the University's Department of Psychology,
will be the editor-in-chief of JLHB.  Dr. Wiener has taught an
annual seminar at the School of Law and has participated in funded
research at the Center.  Health law students will provide editorial
services on articles addressing legal issues.

<P>Of course, the
<I>St. Louis University Law Journal</I> will continue to publish
its Annual Health Law Symposium.  The most recent issue addresses
&quot;Managed Mental Health Care&quot; and will be available from
the School of Law through the Law Journal Office.  The next issue
on &quot;Professional Relationships in Contemporary Health Care&quot;
is being edited this summer.

<P>The <I>St. Louis University Public
Law Review</I> also frequently publishes special issues on health
law.  The special issue on &quot;Culture, Race, Gender and Religion
in Bioethics&quot; is expected to be published this summer.

<HR>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="interdisc">Interdisciplinary Doctoral Program in Health Care Ethics</A></H2>

Also beginning in Fall 1996, the University will institute a new interdisciplinary
Ph.D. program in Health Care Ethics.  The program will collaborate
with and build upon the University's Center for Health Care Ethics.

<P>The focus of the program is emphatically interdisciplinary, with
22 faculty members from a variety of disciplines providing support
for the program's educational and research agenda.  Entry criteria
for admission to the program will also recognize that students
will bring graduate-level training from a variety of disciplines,
including law.

<P>Another distinguishing characteristic of the program
is its integration of research and scholarship on religious perspectives
within the analysis of health care issues.  In addition, the program
incorporates structured clinical experience opportunities within
its academic curriculum.

<P>Dr. Gerard Magill is the director of the
Ph.D. program.  Further information is available from the Center
for Health Care Ethics at (314) 577-8195.</H2>

<HR>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="managed">Seminar on Managed Care Contracting</A></H2>

The health law program added a new advanced seminar to its course offerings in Spring
1996.  This seminar, taught by Randy Gerber (Gallop, Johnson &amp;
Neuman) and Jim Wiehl (Sonnenschein, Nath &amp; Rosenthal), involved
students in negotiating a physician-hospital integration and a
managed care contract.  Students also drafted some of the documents
required in structuring the resultant organizations.  Because
the seminar involved the students in conceptualizing and structuring
delivery systems, it required that students have completed the
basic course in Health Law and have completed or be enrolled in
the course on Health Care Finance and Business Planning.

<P>Gerber
represents physicians and Wiehl represents hospitals and managed
care organizations, and the students were able to receive the
benefit of both perspectives throughout the semester.  Students
were very enthusiastic about the sophistication of the seminar
and the professional guidance and teaching provided by the instructors.
 It will be offered again in Spring 1997.  Dennis Brodeur, Ph.D.,
Senior Vice-President-Stewardship, SSM Health Care System, who
has taught a seminar in &quot;Ethical Issues in Death and Dying&quot;
at the School of Law for the past several years will offer a new
seminar on ethical issues in health care delivery systems this
Spring.  Professor Sandra Johnson will be offering a new seminar
on Geriatrics and Law.</H2>

<HR>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="hla">Health Law Association</A></H2>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Projects, Panels, and Parties</H3>

Committees of the student Health
Law Association undertook several substantial projects, including
the review and summary of pending Missouri health care legislation
for the Combined Health Appeal and the development of a Health
Law Placement Sourcebook.  The Association organized and sponsored
several panels on professional practice in health law, including
sessions on in-house counsel, law firms, and government agencies.
 It also hosted a happy hour and an end-of-year party.

<HR>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="symposium">Health Law Symposium</A></H2>

The Annual Health Law Symposium brought
several leading health care lawyers to the School of Law on March
21 for a full-day conference on <B>Shifting Professional Relationships
in Contemporary Health Care:  Privileges, Labor, Employment and
Contract</B>.  Keynote speaker <B>Alice Gosfield</B> (Gosfield
and Associates) provided a dynamic analysis of current issues
in health law practice, focussing on the sometimes irrational
drive toward integration.  <B>Mark Kadzielski</B> (Epstein, Becker
&amp; Green) provided his insight into legal trends in physician
contracting.   <B>James Eggleston</B> (SLU '77; Eggleston, Siegel
&amp; Lewitter) championed the role of unionization in monitoring
quality of care and described strategies pursued by his client
the California Nurses Association.  <B>Paul Gleeson</B> (Vedder,
Price, Kaufman &amp; Kammholz) thoughtfully analyzed current labor
disputes in health care and evaluated the influence of emerging
legal issues.  In a session on employment discrimination, <B>Laura
Rothstein</B> (Health Law Institute, University of Houston Law
Center), provided a framework for the analysis of case law on
disability discrimination in health care settings; and <B>Mary
Anne Sedey</B> (SLU '75; Mary Anne Sedey &amp; Associates; President
of the National Employment Lawyers Association) described strategies
in litigating sex, race and age discrimination cases in health
care.  <B>David Feller</B> (Univ. of Cal.-Berkeley School of Law)
and <B>Josef Rohlik</B> (SLU) presented a session on emerging
issues in arbitration of health care professional disputes.

<P>Eight
additional workshops on a variety of topics ranging from &quot;Credentialling
in IDSs&quot; to &quot;Surviving Downsizing&quot; to &quot;Legal
Issues in Buying and Selling Physician Practices&quot; provided
attendees with a rich selection.  Our thanks to all of the professionals
who taught in these sessions:  <B>Randy S. Gerber, </B>Gallop,

<H1 ALIGN="Center">Message from the Dean</H1>

<P>We welcome your interest in the Saint Louis University School of Law.  Here
you will find a character and atmosphere that are the result of a number of
factors, including our Jesuit educational traditions, our outstanding faculty
and students, and the rich quality of life in a thriving midwestern city.  The
Jesuit nature of the institution is manifested in our commitment to academic
excellence and freedom of inquiry, a genuine concern for the development of
each student as a person, and an effort to sensitize students to the moral and
ethical dimensions of law and lawyering.

<P>The heart of a law school is its faculty.  Unique to the School of Law is the
special rapport among students, faculty, and staff.  Over the years, the
School has built a reputation for a close-knit community founded on the mutual support and friendship,
openness and accessibility, that characterizes the student-faculty
relationship.  The men and women who comprise the faculty of Saint Louis
University School of Law possess the knowledge and creativity to help students
to develop the skills essential for the successful practice of law.  Faculty
teaching and research activities are supported by a nationally-recognized law
library that is the only one in the country that can change the Library of
Congress Catalog.  Members of our faculty have authored countless treatises,
monographs, anthologies, articles, essays, and other materials in prominent
presses and law journals around the nation and the world.  Leading
practitioners serve as adjunct faculty to strengthen our curriculum.

<P>In addition to our outstanding faculty, we also host distinguished visiting
professors.  Our visitors this year will include internationally-recognized
professors from Oxford, the University of Texas, the European Commission, a Justice of the Constitutional Court of South Africa, a former
Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court, a Judge of the United States Court
of Appeals from the Seventh Circuit, and a former Counsel to the European Commission.  Visiting scholars have come from other
countries including Russia, China and the Ukraine.

<P>This remarkable group of people produces a rich and diverse curriculum in
which students can receive a "broad" general legal education or can
specialize.  We have leading Centers and Certificates in Health Law,
Employment Law, and International and Comparative Law.  With the diversification of the work force, the globalization of the economy, and health care
reform, these Centers stand poised in some of the most promising growth areas
in legal practice.  Our goal is to continue to develop our curriculum toward
the 21st century and a global economy.

<P>Mead Data Central, Inc., owner of the LEXIS&reg;/NEXIS&reg; databases, and and West Company, owner of the WESTLAW databases, have created computerized classrooms of the
future at the School of Law.  One of the primary uses of the classrooms is to
transform the legal research and writing course into one of the most
innovative in the country.  Students currently learn computer-assisted legal
research at approximately the same time as book research.  We also offer a
Sentencing Policy Center in which students discuss actual sentences with the
judges who imposed them.

<P>Beyond our varied curricular offerings are numerous guest lecturers.  Over the
past few years, visitors have included the President of the Italian Constitutional Court; the former Deputy President of the Israeli Supreme Court; the Solicitor General of the United States; the Lord Chancellor of Great Britain; Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, Antonin Scalia; Founding President of Zambia, Kenneth Kaunda; six Justices from the
Russian Constitutional Court; British Parliament member, John Hume; former
Attorney General Edwin Meese; Senator Paul Tsongas; Mayor Freeman Bosley; and
Judges from the Third, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Federal Circuit Courts
of Appeals, the Delaware Supreme Court, and the Missouri State Courts.  Our
Law Journal has recently published articles by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and
Roman Herzog, then President of the German Constitutional Court and now the
President of Germany.  The Public Law Review recently published a symposium
headlined by Governor Casey of Pennsylvania; another issue featured Justice
John Paul Stevens of the Supreme Court of the United States.  The Secretary
General of the United Nations, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, is publishing his Cairo
address in the inaugural issue of the <I>Saint Louis-Warsaw Transatlantic Law</I>
Journal.  This year, our distinguished visitors will include Chief Justice Antionio Larner of the Supreme Court of Canada and Judge Guido Calabresi of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, who also is the former Dean of Yale Law School.

<P>Over the past few years, just over 50% of our entering classes have come from
Missouri, approximately 15-18% from Illinois, and about 30-33% from 26-33
other states.  Over the past two years, classes have included students from
Germany, Israel, India, Russia, Croatia, France, China, and Nepal.  Admission
to the School has been very competitive.  The Admissions Committee considers
many factors in addition to the LSAT score and cumulative grade point average.

<P>Our placement record has been outstanding.  Approximately 92% of the class of
1995 was placed six months after graduation.  Saint Louis University School of
Law graduates occupy approximately 42% of the legal positions in the St. Louis
area, including the mayor, the only Federal Court of Appeals Judge, and vice
presidents or general counsels of several Fortune 500 corporations.  We also
have graduates in prominent positions practicing law around the country and
the world.

<P>Our aim is to be a law school of national and international influence that, in
the Jesuit tradition of service, trains lawyers of the future.

<H1>Teaching the Internet to Faculty and Students</H1>
<H2>1994 CALI/LEAP Conference of Law School Computing
Professionals</H2>
Jim Milles, Facilitator<BR>
Head of Computer Services<BR>
Saint Louis University Law Library



<P>These are notes from the discussion during the program
"Teaching the Internet" at the 1994 CALI/LEAP Conference of Law
School Computing Professionals.  In order to allow the discussion
to flow smoothly, I didn't ask participants to identify
themselves; it's more important to note what was said than who
said it.  Many thanks to Professor Kimberly Colgate of Thomas M.
Cooley Law School for taking these notes.

<ADDRESS>Jim Milles</ADDRESS>

<HR>

<H2>Why do we want to teach the Internet?</H2>

It might convince administrators that this is a good thing to
do--a worthwhile way for us to spend our time.

<P>I'm not sure that it is all wrong to justify the expense. 
Several years ago the monitors were placed in the room, and the
President asked how you liked the monitors--response was we like
them to gather more information. 

<P>Resource management for practice. 

<P>In legal research, to let them know they have more options.

<P>If you have your audience realize you are justifying your own
existence and keeping a positive view of yourself. 

<P>The most valuable resource is the people at the other end of
the terminals.  That human resource enables you to get rapid
response.  Also, I am quite thrifty - it costs less. 

<P>Learning curve is fairly steep--people need help.

<P>Remote access to information. 

<P>Better they learn it from us than out on the streets.

<P>It's fun.


<H2>What are some reasons not to teach internet?</H2>

Time consuming to learn. 

<P>Overwhelming 

<P>We just got internet access on our network 

<P>What is the group we are communicating with?  What is the
student population?  There are significant ramifications,
depending upon the audience.  The predominant group is the
faculty.  If you can teach the faculty how to use the internet,
they are going to be much more supportive of the financial
ramifications.  

<P>A few years ago, the moderator had a theory that the way to
get faculty involved was to teach the students; once faculty saw
the benefits students were getting from using the Internet, the
faculty would follow.  This was probably incorrect, but with the
sudden surge of media coverage of the Internet, it's hard to say.

<H2>Are you teaching faculty, staff and students?</H2>

Yes, we teach them different things.  We have taught faculty
how to transfer files and corrections.  That was a big boost.  

<H2>How are you teaching them?</H2>

We teach them in groups, and then on an individual basis as
needed.  We have found that with the faculty we have to do this
one on one.  Demonstrations of and WWW are helpful; big response
for followup with wanting individual training.

<H2>How many are having to create awareness--teach what Internet
is?</H2>

There was a split.  They are not mutually exclusive.  

<H2>What about people are not eager, but you know they could use
it?</H2>

Knock on their door. 

<H2>Does it help?</H2>

Sometimes.  We have some involved in international law, and
none of them are involved in Internet.  

<P>When you find something of interest, send them a memo about
it.  

<P>There can be pitfalls.  I have two faculty members interested in
Russia, one who is Polish, and was printing several things for
them of interest.  You need to be careful not to turn into a
document delivery service. 

<P>Question about training faculty.  With demonstration and one
on one training, could it be that after introducing them to the
Internet, they will stop there because I have not sent them to
sources that are useful to them.  Do they then ask librarian to
supply it to them?  How far can you go to tailor the introduction
to them?

<P>One thing that has happened by accident, teach E-Mail then
tell them about their discussion list in their area.  Then you
can quit worrying.  

<P>Peer pressure from colleagues can be helpful.

<P>One useful technique is to start with a small group, then go
on one on one.  Whenever they find something of interest, set a
Gopher or WWW bookmark.

<P>A librarian sends them stuff of interest off E-Mail.  Faculty
found out about song lyrics server and became hooked.  (The
server has been overwhelmed, may have been discontinued?)

<P>We found our faculty have a low threshold for "noise."  

<P>Don't always have to do one on one with faculty; sometimes
teaching two at a time is productive.  One will ask questions
that the other didn't think to ask.  It seems they don't want
others to know they don't know something.  

<P>I do that with students, 2 or 3 at a time.  Teach them e-mail
by having them send messages to each other.

<P>May run into technical problmes with two professors are
collaborating: complexities of uuencoding and ftp.  I solved it
by using PCNFS to link two professors to the same hard drive.

<P>One of the means we use is that every week we have a faculty
forum.  We have the ability to present different aspects of law
and Internet.  You get the 4 or 5 power users.  Then they will
speak to the others.  Just show them the capability.  

<P>You need to be careful because the power users like to show
how complex it is to use.  You have to control it. 

<P>Example of what did not work.  E Mail back and forth.  Then
demonstrating gopher; I did some demo and some hands on.  The
third class was FTP, never again.  There are too many little
tricks.  

<H2>Should we bother to teach basics like telnet and FTP?</H2>

You have to continue to teach when you have low end machines. 

<P>I teach them, but differently.  Telnet is the tool that allows
them to read their e-mail remotely while travelling; ftp allows
them to exchange drafts with co-authors.  If you have specific
applications, you can teach them, but don't get bogged down with
using Archie to search for software.

<P>Useful to at least introduce them to telnet and ftp, so they
can appreciate how much better Gopher and Web clients are.

<P>Here at Chicago has been two step process.  (1) Get them in
front of the computer; E Mail will do that.  (2) Then make
software readily available.  They press the button and gopher
works because the underlying software works.  

<H2>How much success can you have with a low level of
connectivity?</H2>

All of our faculty are still using 2400 baud modems to dial
up.  They often complained that they forgot to check their e-
mail, but after a while I figured out it was just too cumbersome.

<P>We have a high level of connectivity, but they want SLIP
access from home.

<P>There are other solutions, e.g. easily configured terminal
servers.

<P>Rutgers has 20,000 students with Internet access.  We have
labs throughout university.  We teach them emacs or vi.  It is
very difficult.  It gives them an appreciation of what the
command line is.  Then we introduce Windows and graphical
interface.  It helps to teach basic things.  Sometimes you will
not be able to be available to support. 

<P>We have a few using SLIP connections.  It causes increased
demand for support.  Part of it is that some of the software is
still flaky.  

<P>I think it is our responsibility to provide user-friendly
applications that don't require a sophisticated user.  If it
required any more, it would be difficult to get people to use it. 

<H2>That relates to upgrades?</H2>

You don't upgrade piecemeal.  

<P>Test everything out.  We do not want to deliver a Windows
program until the bugs are worked out and everything can be
installed in a single pass.

<H2>Realistic expectations: When you have people asking for help,
what do they think Internet is going to do for them?</H2>

I had someone come in who wanted to research demographics on
Latin America.  I could not think of a source for that
information.  Discussion on this.  Important to get across the
idea that Internet is still primarily a communication medium, not
a research tool.  Tell the faculty the Internet is not a
database.

<P>I think that the faculty might think it is going to be easy. 
they might get discouraged.  You need to give them some
background to avoid expectations.  

<P>I have had the experience of collaboration across the country. 
At this stage you need to make it easier for faculty.  We are
sending the files through modem--not sophisticated way to do it,
but the other institution had security fears and wouldn't set up
an ftp server. 

<H2>What about written documentation in training?</H2>

I am curious about how people feel about written documentation
in training.  What kind of documentation is effective?  Do you
throw them <I>The Whole Internet?</I>

<P>Keep it real short--explicit, 1 page instruction sheets are
best.

<P>Instructions have to be explicit, idiot-proof.  We had
documentation on FTP that said "ftp domain.domain.edu"--a
complete mystery to the user.

<P>I found after using my documentation that I had to go through
it and put "press Enter" after every command.

<P>This has worked for me: we type commands on screen and then
print screen at every step; they use that to create their own
notes.  This will give them 10-15 pages of their own
documentation.  

<H2>Screen captures</H2>

Any training documentation should have lots of screen
documentation.  Even with screen output that you can ignore,
explain what it is and that you can ignore it--otherwise people
get confused.

<P>I do not use screen captures in my documentation; I want
people to use the documentation and work through it at the
terminal, not just read it.  

<P>In screen capture you can take things out.  If you don't tell
them, they wonder why those number are there. 

<H2>What is on Internet that is worth showing them?</H2>

Apparently, what faculty wants to do most is to transfer
files.

<P>Listserves, e.g. LAWPROF.

<P>International law professor using gopher.

<P>Co-authoring going on.

<H2>What tools do you teach?</H2>

E-mail 
     
<P>Gopher 
     
<P>Card catalog 
     
<H2>Where do you use documentation?</H2>

Do you use written documentation as an introduction to read
beforehand, during the lesson, or as a reminder for later?

<P>I hand them the document, then have class.  Tell them what
will be in there.  Half of the document is actual training, the
other half is materil that you will need later on.  

<P>We starting to do that, provide big documentation.  One of the
things you should do is look at what is already out there.  

<P>We spent a lot of time on E mail to show them each screen so
that we did not have to train.  

<H2>How many people can you hand documentation and nothing
more?</H2> 

Obviously, some.  

<H2>Success stories to share?</H2>

UseNet is a way to get faculty members interested.  

<P>There was discussion about excessive use of E Mail or not
reading it.

Guides.</H2>

<P>INTERNET PUBLIC LIBRARY: "The Internet Public Library is the first public library of the Internet. As librarians, we are committed to providing valuable services to that world.

<P>MLNC : THE MISSOURI LIBRARY NETWORK CORPORATION: "The Missouri Library Network Corporation (MLNC) was founded on October 19, 1981 by the representatives of 31 Missouri libraries.

As what libraries do has changed since 1981, many of MLNCs services now focus on fulfilling this mission by supplying, training and supporting libraries in their use of the latest information technologies.
MLNC became a provider of OCLC services for Missouri libraries on July 1, 1983. In addition to serving as the OCLC Regional Network for the state of Missouri, MLNC now provides discounts on a variety of library-related products and services, including discounts from CD-ROM database vendors (such as SilverPlatter and WILSONDISC), major online reference database vendors (such as OVID and DIALOG), and library supply catalogs (such as DEMCO and BRODART).
MLNC also offers a wide range of workshops on OCLC products, library automation, Internet technologies, and library-related continuing education topics"--P. 1 of MLNC home page, history and purpose. </P>

<head><title>How to Submit Training Materials</title>
<link rev="made" href="millesjg@sluvca.slu.edu">
</head>

<body>

Date: Mon, 09 May 1994 17:40:41 -0400 (EDT)<br>
From: Jim Milles &lt;MILLESJG@SLUVCA.SLU.EDU&gt;<br>
Subject: Internet training materials<br>
Sender: teknoids@fatty.law.cornell.edu<br>

<P>Fellow Teknoids,

<P>A few weeks ago I volunteered to develop a clearinghouse of 
law-related Internet training materials.  I originally proposed 
an anonymous ftp site, but since we now have our W3 server up, 
I'd like to HTML the whole thing.

<P>So, anyone who has any in-house Internet training documents 
that they'd like to share, please do so.  You can submit your 
materials virtually any way you like:

<OL>
<LI>By e-mail to millesjg@sluvca.slu.edu (take your pick of 
ASCII, WordPerfect 7-bit transfer, uuencode, or binhex); or 
<LI>By anonymous ftp to lawlib.slu.edu (send me an e-mail 
message to let me know you've put something there); or
<LI>If your training materials are already available by 
anonymous ftp, or if they are already in HTML on your own server, 
just send me the URL and I'll put in a link to your document.  
(This is the best method for all involved, because you can then 
maintain updates locally; you don't have to send me a copy.) 
<LI>If you need an ftp site to post your materials, you may 
use mine.  Just ftp/put the file in lawlib.slu.edu, directory 
/incoming (and e-mail me to let me know it's there), and I'll 
move it to our Unix host at sluaxa.slu.edu. 
</OL>

<hr>

<H1>INDEXING INFORMATION:</H1>

<P>In order to help potential users find relevant materials 
more easily, I would like to include some basic indexing 
information to be incorporated into the overall HTML document.  
So, when you submit your training documents, please send me a 
short message containing the following information for each 
document you submit: 

<UL>
<LI>TITLE of the document: 
<LI>AUTHOR: 
<LI>LAW SCHOOL (or other affiliation):
<LI>COVERAGE: (e.g., mail, telnet, ftp, gopher, or WWW, 
for documentation on specific tools; "general introduction" if 
that's what your document is)
<LI>LEVEL: Introductory, Advanced, or Introductory/Advanced 
(classify your document as "Introductory/Advanced" if it is 
intended for a range of experience levels, or if it includes both 
introductory and advanced material)
<LI>ENVIRONMENT: 
      <UL> 
      <LI>Host system: Unix, VAX, IBM/VM, Novell, etc.
      <LI>Local systems: DOS, Windows, Macintosh, NeXT, etc.
      <LI>Software: Which client software is presented in your training material; e.g., mail (Unix, VAX, CC:Mail, Eudora, etc.), Usenet newsreader (nn, rn, VAX NEWS, Trumpet, etc.), Cello, Mosaic, or Lynx, and any special telnet, ftp, or other clients (e.g., NCSA Telnet, WS_FTP, etc.) 
      <LI>FORMAT: e.g., ASCII, HTML, WordPerfect 5.1/5.2/6.0, Word, etc.
      </UL>
</UL>

<P>Of course, I welcome any suggestions for improving this 
outline.  This is, after all, a cooperative effort, and it needs 
your input to succeed.

<title>The Omer Poos Law Library</title>

<hr>
<h2 align="center">The Omer Poos Law Library</h2>
<hr>

The Omer Poos Law Library boasts a 400,000-plus volume collection, including microfilms, rare
books, audio and video cassettes, computer assisted learning materials, CD-ROM databases, and
computer software.  The Library provides access to both the fundamental tools of legal research
and materials for in-depth scholarship, including foreign materials, government documents from
many American and foreign jurisdictions, legal data bases, (LEXIS/NEXIS&reg;, Westlaw&reg;),
bibliographic data bases (Dialog&reg;, MEDLINE&reg;, OCLC&reg;), Internet connections, and in-house
computers for computer aided instruction and word-processing.<p>

In the international and comparative law area, the Law Library contains a substantial collection
of foreign legal materials in English and the basic source materials from many foreign
jurisdictions. The Law Library has current subscriptions to over 140 foreign legal periodicals. <p>

The Law Library's experience in international exchange covers a span of over 30 years and
includes exchanges with the law libraries of Ateneo de Manila, Philippines, the University of
London, England, as well as current exchanges with institutions in Ireland, Germany, and
Poland. <p>

Over the past few years, the Law Library has received national recognition in the library
community through its active participation in several projects. Among its numerous distinctions,
it was among the first among the 20 libraries in the country to receive enhance status on OCLC
which is an international bibliographic database of over 34 million records supplied by more than
13,000 members.  This coveted capability allows Library catalogers to make permanent
corrections in the database.   The Law Library also contributes authority records to the Library of
Congress over a computerized network.<p>

Due to its well-known excellence in cataloging, the law library was asked to organize and direct
the cataloging for the Nineteenth-Century Law Collection, a microform republication of Harvard
Law Library's 19th-century English-language collections.  The project was undertaken in
conjunction with the Law Libraries of the University of Virginia and the University of Oklahoma
as an OCLC microform consortium.<p>

Recently, the Law Library was also requested to lead a project to catalog the microfiche
International Law collection edited by Professor William Butler of the University of London. 
This project was undertaken in conjunction with Georgetown University Law Library and
covered more than 6,000 titles in 15 different languages.<p>

The Smurfit Irish Law Center is supported by an endowment donated by the Jefferson Smurfit
Company.  The Center's collection of Irish legal materials is among the best in the United States.
A "Bibliographic Guide" to the collection is maintained electronically and is continuously
updated. The Guide is a foundation for a "Legal Research Guide" to Irish legal materials. The
Bar Council in Ireland and the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland support the Center. <p>

The Library has recently embarked on establishing a contemporary Polish law collection.  The
collection includes English translations of Polish legal materials, major Polish law journals and
books, and current legal information regarding business developments in Poland.

<body>

<hr>
<h2 align="center">Foreign Visitors, Lecturers and Conferences</h2>
<hr>

Saint Louis University has a strong tradition of promoting continued expansion of student and
faculty exposure to international legal studies. With this goal in mind, Saint Louis University
School of Law conducts enrichment programs and hosts international guest lecturers and
professors.  The Center strongly encourages students to take advantage of these unique
opportunities to gain first hand insight into the world beyond our national borders. <p>

Here are some recent examples of faculty involvement in international conferences, followed by
examples of events hosted by the law school:


<ul>

meeting with Law School faculty and students.  The Justices returned in 1993.  During their
visits the Justices met with members of the faculty of New York University School of Law
and Yale Law School.  They also met with the Justices of the United States Supreme Court. 
At the suggestion of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Saint Louis University School of Law, in
association with New York University School of Law, organized a Summit on Constitutional
Adjudication, attended by justices of the Constitutional Courts of Russia, the United States,
Italy, Germany and the European Union.  The Summit took place in Florence, Italy, from July
25-28, 1995.  The justices discussed the experiences of their respective courts on such
subjects as International Law and Rights Jurisprudence, European Unification and Federalism,
Court Jurisdiction and Organization, Separation of Powers, Judicial Self-Restraint, etc.  Dean

<TITLE>LL.M. in Health Law</TITLE>
<META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="Internet Assistant for Word 1.0Z">
<META NAME="AUTHOR" CONTENT="James Milles">
</HEAD>

<BODY>

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER"> LL.M. IN HEALTH LAW</H1>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"> SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW</H2>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"> CENTER FOR HEALTH LAW STUDIES</H2>

<P>
 Saint Louis University's Master of Laws degree in Health Law
offers attorneys the opportunity to obtain an advanced degree
in law and pursue an individualized course of study chosen from
a wide spectrum of courses, seminars, externships and directed
research involving the rapidly-changing health care industry.
 The program is part of the Center for Health Law Studies at Saint
Louis University School of Law, which was ranked by U.S. News
and World Report as the number one health law program in the United
States in 1995 and 1996.

<H3>CURRICULUM</H3>

 The program is designed to serve both lawyers who do not have
extensive experience in the practice of health care law but who
may wish to change or expand practice areas as well as those currently
employed in the field but desiring to gain a broad exposure to
new developments in the law and other disciplines.  Candidates
for the LL.M. degree must have received a J.D. degree from an
ABA accredited law school.  Because it emphasizes individual attention
and close faculty supervision for each student, the program is
highly selective and has traditionally admitted five or fewer
candidates per year.  Students may complete the program on a full-time
basis over the course of one year or on a part-time basis over
the course of two years.

<P>
 There is no fixed curriculum for the LL.M. degree.  Students
may choose from a wide variety of academic offerings and are advised
in designing a program that fits their particular needs and interests.
 In recent years, some students have focused in the following
areas:  the business of medicine (legal issues surrounding restructuring,
integration and joint ventures), medical malpractice, gerontology,
and bioethics.

<P>
 The Health Law LL.M. program at Saint Louis University places
strong emphasis on research under the close supervision of experienced
faculty.  Each student is encouraged to chart out a course of
study that enables him or her to do extensive scholarly writing
in seminars and directed research projects.  A number of students
have had their LL.M. work published in law reviews and professional
journals.

<H3>A RICH LEARNING ENVIRONMENT</H3>

Saint Louis University's Center for Health Law Studies draws
upon an array of resources both on campus and in the Saint Louis
community to offer a broad range of educational experiences and
options for the LL.M. candidates.
<H4>Faculty</H4>

<P>
 The faculty's extensive involvement in scholarship, litigation,
legislation and national health law organizations helps them bring
to the classroom cutting-edge issues and a thorough familiarity
with scholarly and legal developments.  For example, in recent
years, faculty members have been actively involved in such issues
as antitrust, bioethics, insurance, law and psychiatry, medical
malpractice, AIDS, long-term care, Medicaid reform, geriatrics
and child abuse.  Faculty have also participated in funded research
projects.

<H4>Publications</H4>

<P>
 The Law School has an unrivaled record in health law publication.
 For nearly twenty years the Saint Louis University Law Journal
has published its annual Health Law Symposium.  This issue has
been well-cited and reviewed in the field.  Since 1988, the Symposium
has been based on papers presented at the annual health law conference
held at the School of Law.  The Law School has recently been chosen
by the American Academy of Health Attorneys to publish <I>The
Journal of Health and Hospital Law</I>, one of the nation's leading
journals in the health law field.  In addition, <I>The Journal
of Law and Human Behavior</I>, an interdisciplinary journal which
publishes articles related to the interaction of law, legal systems
and legal processes with human behavior, is edited at Saint Louis
University.

<P>
 The Saint Louis University <I>Public Law Review</I> also has
published special issues on health law, focussing primarily on
public policy concerns. 

<H4>Saint Louis University -- Opportunities for Interdisciplinary
Studies</H4>

 Candidates for the LL.M. degree frequently draw on the extensive
resources of the University in health care and other disciplines.
 For example, students may take advantage of opportunities for
interdisciplinary study available in courses offered at the University's
School of Public Health, including courses on health administration,
economics and managed care.  The University's Center for Health
Care Ethics has established a new interdisciplinary Ph.D. program
in Health Care Ethics.
<H4>Externships and Experiential Learning</H4>

<P>
 Students may take advantage of a number of opportunities for
externships for academic credit with health lawyers throughout
the St. Louis area.  The school offers externships in the in-house
counsel offices of major hospitals, systems, universities, and
insurers in the area as well as the U.S. Attorney's Health Care
Fraud Task Force, and other government agencies.  The law school
also offers a Health Law Clinic in which students work under the
supervision of an experienced faculty member on a variety of civil
matters such as legal problems of the homebound elderly, Alzheimer's
patients and persons with AIDS.

<H3>DEGREE REQUIREMENTS</H3>

 Candidates must complete twenty-four credit hours.  Students
may take up to six hours of directed research under the  direct
supervision of a member of the faculty and may take up to six
hours of courses outside of the law school.  Students must submit
a thesis prior to graduation.
<H3>APPLICATION AND FURTHER INFORMATION</H3>

<P>
 All applicants must submit a completed application, two letters
of recommendation, a law school transcript and a personal statement.
 Applications may be obtained from:

<p>This is my daughter, Lauren. She is four years old. She attends Storman Stufflin School 
where she is learning so many wonderful things. Now, I'm not just bragging because she 
is my kid, but this girl is smart. She is reading and her analytical reasoning is sharp (like 
her daddy)! She loves Barbie on CD Rom.</p>

<title>SLU International Law Program</title>
<!-- HTML version by James Milles millesjg@slu.edu -->

<H1 align="center">The International Law Program at Saint Louis University School of Law</H1>
<P align="center">by <A HREF="http://lawlib.slu.edu/lawschl/dore.htm">Isaak Dore</A><a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>

<CENTER><H2>Introduction</H2></CENTER>


<p>	The intellectual foundations of the international studies program at Saint Louis University
School of Law were established a long time  ago.  These include a traditionally open-minded and
well-traveled <A HREF="http://lawlib.slu.edu/centers/cicl/cicl7.htm">faculty</A>, as well as emphasis on comparative studies and <A HREF="http://lawlib.slu.edu/centers/cicl/cicl4.htm">international exchanges</A>
dating back to the early 1960's.  The program is based on the faculty's belief that comparative
study and open-minded exchanges enrich the atmosphere of learning within the law school, that
they are key to a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of our own legal system,
and that just as domestic peace cannot be preserved without effective municipal legal systems,
international law is a <em>sine qua non </em>for international peace.

<p>	<A HREF="http://swift.eng.ox.ac.uk/jdr/kant.html">Immanuel Kant</A>, writing in 1795, recognized the importance of international law when he
stated that

<blockquote>	. . . states find themselves impelled (though hardly by moral compulsion) to
promote the noble peace and to try to avert war by mediation whenever it
threatens to break out anywhere in the world.  It is as if states were constantly
leagued for this purpose; for great leagues <em>for</em> the purpose of making war can only come
about very rarely and can succeed even more rarely.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a></blockquote>

<p>	The Kantian imperative of law shows that legal ordering is a purposive endeavor to
establish an effective, stable - i.e., permanent or "eternal" - peace.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>  Kant further asserts that it is
the way of nature that "the mechanism of human inclinations" causes or "impels" states to seek
peace and avoid war.  Once this minimum condition is guaranteed, other pursuits to promote the
common good (such as the "spirit of commerce"<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>) become possible.  This notion of guaranteeing
peace as a minimum common good before other goals can be pursued is one of the main
intellectual pillars of Saint Louis University's International Law Program.  The program
explains the basic normative foundations of the international common good, the institutions for its
preservation, and how contemporary challenges of globalization have expanded and transformed
the concept of the common good.

<p>	The Saint Louis law faculty has identified three fundamental challenges that legal
education faces today in the designing of international law curricula:  to implant in the minds of
the next generation of young lawyers that the Kantian notion of nations united by mutual self-interest has at no time been more true and more significant; to expose students to the full variety
of challenges to globalization so that they make legal decisions on an informed basis; and to equip
them with the intellectual tools to devise creative strategies for tomorrow's society, balancing the
common good (defined both in the minimalist and the maximalist sense) and individual gains.

<p>	The sovereignty-centered society of yesterday produced a de facto order in which state
power was deployed to secure such unilateral benefits and advantages as could be attained for the
citizenry in the world arena while parallel attempts were in progress, in fits and spurts, to advance
the common good of all sovereignties.  It is this internationalism that is sweeping the world today.
The state that ignores it does so at its own peril.  At the same time, joining the trend does not
mean the surrender of all individual gains.  To force such a surrender is to upset the balance,
which could lead to domestic civil strife or, worse still, war between states.

<p>	The program at Saint Louis University Law School recognizes that the new
internationalism has globalized many of what were previously considered to be national or local
problems.  The lawyer for the government of tomorrow must be prepared to abandon a strictly
national vantage point.  One must engage in a new effort to engineer institutions that meet the
challenges of globalization, and that protect and enhance in a democratic fashion the balance
between the common good and individual gains.

<p>	The Saint Louis University law faculty has also endorsed complementary jurisprudential
reasons for teaching international law.   First, it enhances the student's understanding of the
concept of law both in a theoretical and a functional sense.  A course in public international law is
similar to the general course in jurisprudence offered in most law schools.   International law is
still a developing system that tests the boundaries of our concept of law generally and our
understanding of law in operational or functional contexts.  It allows both student and teacher to
test normative rules beyond the strictures of traditional Austinian positivism.  It throws new light
on such basic questions as to what is law; how is it made, ascertained and enforced; the nature of
sanction and its role in law; and the nature of obligation.

<p>	Second, students can learn from another legal system in order to improve their own.
International law has its own jurisprudential underpinnings and operates as a distinct system.  Yet
it has permeated most municipal systems and constitutional traditions.  This interface offers many
exciting opportunities for exploring the dualist/monist debate, for testing the validity of many
basic domestic legal premises, and learning advocacy techniques under a different yet related
system.

<p>	Third, we believe that international law courses can provide the student with a well-rounded education in the liberal arts tradition.  A liberal education frees the student from the
limiting perspectives and constrained habits of thought of his own system.

<p>	Our international law program has been divided into four broad but overlapping
categories.  First, a specialization in international law offered to our J.D. students, aimed at
preparing them for the theory and practice of international law leading to the award of a
Certificate in International and Comparative Law.  Second, a master's (LL.M.) degree in
American law offered to foreign lawyers.  Third, international exchange programs and visitors.
Fourth, internal publications (as well as external publication) that stimulate interest in international
law within the law school.  The four categories are complimentary; each contributes to the
program as a whole.

<center><H2>The Certificate Program</H2>
</center>


<p>	This program, offered to our J.D. students, requires 12 hours of credits from the
International Law curriculum, including basic required courses in public international law,
international trade, comparative law and <A HREF="http://europa.eu.int/">European Union</A> law.  There is also a substantial writing
requirement, and students must participate in the foreign language program.

<p>	The certificate program is designed to ensure that the lawyer of tomorrow makes informed
decisions.  Various courses and seminars convey the information that tomorrow's lawyer will
need.  Laws for the articulation and protection of the common good are the subject of Public
International Law, International Human Rights, and International Environmental Law.  The new
corporate internationalism is reflected in Multinational Corporate Transactions, European Union
Law, International Business Transactions,  Regulation of Foreign Trade, International Taxation,
International Banking, and courses on <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Economy/Trade/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement___NAFTA/">NAFTA</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.wto.org/">World Trade Organization</A>.  International
Commercial Arbitration and International Business Transactions deal with dispute settlement.
Students learn from other systems, and come to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their own legal system by taking courses in Comparative Law, Jurisprudence, Comparative Criminal
Justice Systems, Comparative Constitutional Law, The United States Constitution and Foreign
Affairs, and <A HREF="http://europa.eu.int/">European Union</A> Laws.  In International Arbitration, International Environmental
Law, The New World Order, and International Human Rights, students consider strategies to
cope with some of the newer challenges to globalization.

<p>	These courses have broad thematic cross-overs, designed to inculcate the sense that the
lawyer of tomorrow will live in a one-world community rather than within separate and distinct
sovereignties.  To present such an integrated curriculum also enables the student to cope with the
collapsing distinction between public and private international law.  It has been said that a lawyer
"cannot advise or defend private clients without an understanding of the powers and limitations of
governments, and one cannot advise or participate in government without a grasp of how private
firms and their legal counsel operate."<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>  This public/private interface is generally recognized in the
domestic law curricula, where constitutional law and administrative law courses are recommended
if not required.  The same is true for the practitioner whose clients (private and governmental)
engage in transactions that cross national borders.

<p>	It is well known that cultural and language barriers frequently lead to misunderstanding:
relations become strained when parties speak and act at cross-purposes because they do not
understand each other person's mode of communication.  Learning a foreign language goes a long
way to overcome these obstacles to successful - and enjoyable - international practice.  Our
International Law Center has responded to this need in an interesting way.  Every other week at
the law school, students and faculty gather at lunch time for foreign language discussion groups.
The French speakers munch their <A HREF="http://epicurious.com/db/dictionary/terms/c/croissan.html">croissants</A>, the Italian-speakers sip their <A HREF="http://cappuccino.com/drinks.htm">latte</A>, the Dutch
speakers dunk their <em><A HREF="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/paulvanV/speculas.htm">speculoos</A></em>, the German-speakers hoist their <A HREF="http://realbeer.com/rbp/rbp.html">beer</A>, and the Spanish speakers
snack on homemade <A HREF="http://vino.eunet.es/vino/es_bits.html#TAPAS">tapas</A>.  Native speakers from different countries (often foreign lawyers
enrolled in our own LL.M. for foreign lawyers program) introduce basic legal vocabulary from
their own legal systems.  Sometimes groups view foreign television news broadcasts or foreign
films.  These meetings are very informal, but they help students develop an awareness and
sensitivity to other cultures.

<center><H2>The LL.M. Program</H2>
</center>


<p>	Our LL.M. in American law meets the needs of lawyers from other countries who wish to
conduct an in-depth study of the American legal system.  The candidate must have a law degree
from his or her home country and must successfully complete 24 hours of credit in our J.D.
curriculum, including a thesis to be defended before a faculty committee.  The program has
admitted students from Poland, Germany, France, Croatia, Hungary, Russia, China, India and
Nepal.  The varied foreign presence has enriched the general learning environment and has
stimulated much interest in international studies; it has also fostered cultural awareness and
understanding on the part of our American students.

<center><H2>International Exchanges</H2>
</center>


<p>	The Center for International and Comparative Law, established in 1992, maintains an
aggressive international exchange and lecturing program.  This is largely due to a truly diverse
faculty.  Four members were born and received their legal training abroad.  About a third of the
faculty are multilingual, and about a fourth bilingual.  At last count, the faculty have lectured in at
least twenty-four countries around the world, often in the host country's language.  The Center
maintains independent exchange programs with the University of Orl&eacute;ans (France), the Ruhr
University (Germany), the University of Warsaw (Poland), and Sichuan University and Chendu
University (China).  Several of our faculty have taught courses (ranging from mincourses to full-semester courses) at these universities.  The center also invites foreign dignitaries and scholars to
speak and teach at the law school.

<p>	As a general practice, the law school invites one or more visiting professors to teach in the
international law area each year.  Last year Professor Bernard Rudden, University Professor at
Oxford University, taught comparative law, and Professor Richard Lillich of the University of
Virginia taught a course in international human rights.  Jo&euml;l Mon&eacute;ger from the University of
Orl&eacute;ans taught a course on Mergers and Acquisitions under European Law - our response to the
fact that the European Union is undergoing a unique economic integration which will result in
many economic as well as non-economic linkages among the countries of the region.  We further
meet this challenge with our European Union Law Seminar, an intensive course offered partly in
St. Louis and partly at the Institute of European Studies at the Free University of Brussels, in
which students study European Union law, including telecommunications, competition law,
external trade relations, and European human rights.  Students attend classes and lectures with
European professors, judges, and practitioners.  Tuition and costs are provided free to the
students, who are responsible only for their individual travel.  A follow-up session at the Hague
Academy of International Law is also available.  The European Law Seminar is among the
requirements of the Certificate Program.

<p>	Turning to the former Soviet Union, one notes that the reorganization of the republics
there offers unparalleled opportunities.  Thanks to the initiatives and experience of our dean, John
Attanasio, who has served as advisor to a number of parliaments and judicial tribunals in Eastern
Europe, we were able to host the judges from the Russian Constitutional Court at

<p>a our law school in 1992, and again in 1993.  After those visits Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
proposed a formal summit on constitutional adjudication.  It was organized by the Saint Louis and
New York University law schools and took place in Florence, Italy, at NYU's magnificent Villa
La Pietra.  In addition to justices from the Constitutional Court of Russia, participants included
three justices of the U.S. Supreme Court and justices from the constitutional courts of Germany,
Italy, and the European Union.

<p>	Our faculty has many ongoing contacts with legal and academic circles in Eastern Europe.
One of our permanent faculty members is a native of Poland and a former faculty member at the
School of Law of the University of Warsaw.  Another is a native of the former Czechoslovakia.
An agreement concluded in the late 1980's established Saint Louis and the Warsaw law school as
sister schools, leading to many faculty exchanges.

<center><H2>Research and Publication</H2>
</center>


<p>	The <em>Saint Louis University Law Journal</em> has published articles by high-ranking officials of
several countries.  In addition, our faculty have published numerous books and articles in the U.S.
and abroad.

<p>	In 1994, Saint Louis University launched the <em>Saint Louis-Warsaw Transatlantic Law
Journal</em> - the first peer-reviewed legal publication jointly sponsored by a North American law
school and a European law school.  It is run by the two schools' faculties.  The inaugural issue
contains works by - among others - United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali and
the Prime Minister of the Czech republic, Vaclav Klaus.  There is substantial student involvement
in the journal.  There has historically been great student interest in establishing an international
law journal.  A student editorial board, selected after a writing competition, works under the
supervision of the editors in chief and a faculty editorial committee.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u></u>	The broad categories and themes outlined above are just the minimum standards that the
School of Law has set for itself.  I think we have done more than the minimum, but much more
remains to be done.

<H1 align="center">Academic Conferences and Programs for the Practicing Lawyer</H1>

<P>The William C. Wefel Center for Employment Law has demonstrated its commitment to the promotion of academic scholarship and publication as well as to serving the needs of the practicing bar by presenting annual conferences which explore current significant issues in labor and employment law.  Many of the nationally known speakers at these conferences have also published articles in the <I>Saint Louis University Law Journal</I> and in the <I>Public Law Review</I>.

<P>The annual conferences are held at the law school, thereby offering students who attend these programs the opportunity to learn about current critical issues in labor and employment law as well as the opportunity to meet and exchange views with prominent academics and leading members of the practicing bar.  Annual programs of this nature also serve as a means of introducing students to prospective employers.

<P>In 1996 the Center for Employment Law and the <A HREF="http://lawlib.slu.edu/centers/hlthlaw.htm">Center for Health Law Studies</A> co-sponsored a conference entitled "Shifting Professional Relationships in Contemporary Health Care: Privileges, Labor, Employment and Contract."  Nationally-known practitioners James E. Eggleston, who represents the California Nurses Association, and Paul F. Gleeson of Vedder, Price, Kaufman and Kammholz in Chicago, discussed collective action and unionization in health care.  Professor Laura Rothstein of the University of Houston Law Center considered developments in discrimination law relating to health care professionals with mental and physical impairments and Mary Anne Sedey, President of the National Employment Lawyers Association, explored the issues of sex, race, age discrimination and sexual harassment in health care settings.

<P>In 1995 the eighth annual conference offered consideration of the future of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) by the current NLRB Chairman, William B. Gould, IV, who was on leave from his position as Charles A. Beardsley Professor of Law at Stanford University.  Former General Counsel of the NLRB, Jerry M. Hunter, commented upon Chairmant Gould's remarks.  The Deputy General Counsel of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), James R. Neely, Jr., discussed recent developments at the EEOD with particular emphasis on the impact and implications of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Professor Julius G. Getman, who holds the Earl E. Sheffield Regents Chair at the University of Texas, discussed the right to strike.  Arbitration of statutory employment claims was explored by Professor Martin H. Malin of Chicago-Kent College of Law, and prominent local practitioners discussed after-acquired evidence problems and the report of the Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations.

<P>Also in 1995, the <A HREF="http://www.nela.org/">National Employment Lawyers' Association</A> and the Center co-sponsored a full-day conference entitled "How to Prepare and Try Employment Discrimination Cases: Basics in Employment Discrimination," presented by Professor Leland Ware of the Center faculty and prominent local practitioners.

<P>"Smoking in the Workplace" was the topic of the 1993-1994 conference which featured two national experts in the areas of health law and tobacco liability as well as a prominent local attorney who was currently engaged in a second-hand smoke case.  Theodore J. St. Antoine and David E. Feller, both nationally known labor law experts, were featured speakers at the 1992-1993 conference entitled "Arbitration and Employment Law" which focused on the arbitration of grievances in unionized workplaces as well as whether non-union employees may be required to arbitrate employment discrimination claims.  Previous conference themes included: drug testing in the workplace, deferred compensation and employee benefits, employment discrimination, mediation of collective bargaining grievances, and practical advice from judges on how to win labor and employment law cases.

<link rev="made" href="millesjg@sluvca.slu.edu"></head>
<body>

<H1 align="center">The Practice of Employment Law</H1>

<P>The employment relationship, considered one of the most fundamental in modern industrial societies, spans the union-organized sectors of the economy as well as the unorganized work force.  The law governing the employment relationship affects the lives of all workers, from top managerial officials to part-time clerks.  Though its forms and manifestations are constantly changing, the dynamic character of this critical relationship intensified in the 1990's.

<P>The study of employer and employee responsibilities and rights ranges from the traditional establishment of collective bargaining relationships between unions and management in the private sector and the more recent establishment of such relations in the public sector, to prohibition of employment discrimination based on race, age, sex (including sexual harassment), religion and disabilities, to regulation of employee benefits and qualified retirement plans, as well as regulation of health and safety in the workplace.<P>

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD>A wide of opportunities for employment exist in this field.  The study of labor and employment law provides the foundation for the practice of law as a representative of individual employees, unions or management, as well as for practice in governmental positions such as with the National Labor Relations Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or the Human Rights Commission of a state or local government.  Expertise in the employment field of law is also beneficial in the practice of corporate law, and in representing institutional clients such as health care industries or higher education institutions.  Significant increases in the number of employment discrimination cases filed have also made this area an important component of any law firm's litigation department.

</TABLE>

<H2 align="center">The William C. Wefel Center for Employment Law</H2>

<P>The William C. Center for Employment Law at Saint Louis University School of Law was established to offer interested students an opportunity to specialize in the subject of the employment relationship as a unifying thread for their study of law leading to the J.D. degree and to obtain a Certificate in Employment Law recognizing their academic experience in this area.  The Center also sponsors annual conferences and academic lectures and promotes scholarship and publications in the employment law field.

<P>The Center draws upon the full resources of Saint Louis University as well as the School of Law in staffing its academic programs.  The School of Law is generally recognized for its friendly and supportive atmosphere, and a full-time Center faculty rich in academic and practical experience is available on a daily basis to administer to the needs of the students.  In addition, the <A HREF="http://www.bamsl.org/bamsl/">St. Louis Bar</A> with its nationally recognized wealth of talent in the area of labor-management and employment relationships provides part-time and counseling assistance from practitioners active in the field.

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.st-louis.mo.us/">St. Louis metropolitan area</A> affords an ideal location for the operations of the Center, encompassing both an impressive number of <A HREF="http://www.st-louis.mo.us/business/">large corporate employers and a range of medium and small businesses.</A>  Virtually the entire spectrum of legal issues involving employment is reflected in the city and surrounding suburbs.

<P>Each year the Center and the student-sponsored Employment Law Association offer a variety of extra-curricular programs for students which enrich the academic experience.  These programs address current employment law issues including, for example, the impact of Congressional budget decisions on the National Labor Relations Board, sexual harassment, sports law, and workers' compensation.

<P>Additional programs feature local attorneys discussing the practice of labor and employment law.  The Center and the Employment Law Association also hold a number of social gatherings.  All of these activities afford students a variety of perspectives on employment law as well as the opportunity to meet each other and to "network" with practitioners.

<H2 align="center">The Certificate in Employment Law</H2>

<P>The first-year student confronts a bewildering array of apparently disconnected courses.  A persistent complaint of a beginning law student is the lack of cohesion to the studies.  While much of the confusion and trauma are inevitable in any attempt to master a new area of knowledge, the William C. Wefel Center for Employment Law offers a point of orientation for a student to help him or her plot an approach to the study of the law.

<P>To achieve the Certificate in Employment Law, a student is required to complete eleven hours of course work in the employment field as part of the curriculum of study leading to the Juris Doctor degree and to submit a paper of publishable quality on a topic related to Employment Law.  After the first year of study, each student chooses from a broad range of courses in the employment area, including not only traditional labor-management subjects in both the private and public sectors, but also judicial and legislative regulations on discrimination, pensions, deferred compensation, worker safety, and employment-at-will.

<P>The School of Law offers an extensive labor and employment law curriculum.  Employment law has been one ofthe most significant sectors of growth in the field of alternative dispute resolution and an important component of the Centner program emphasizes the arbitration, mediation, and negotiation processes.  In addition to regularly scheduled course, the School of Law has recently offered two mini-courses taught by nationally-recognized employment law scholars.  In the spring of 1996, Distinguished Visiting Professor David E. Feller taught a course entitled "Arbitration of Statutory Claims."  Professor Feller is professor emeritus at the University of California Law School at Berkeley, and is a member and past president of the National Academy of Arbitrators.  Professor Feller has written briefs to the U.S. Supreme Court in a number of seminal cases involving labor arbitration including the <I>Steelworkers Trilogy</I> cases and the <I>United Paperworkers International v. Misco</I> case.

<P>In the fall of 1996, Distinguished Visiting Professor Julius G. Getman taught a mini-course entitled "Collective Bargaining and the Right to Strike."  Professor Getman holds the Earl E. Sheffield Regents Chair at The University of Texas School of Law, where he has been a professor of law since 1986.  He previously was the William K. Townsend Professor of Law at Yale (1978-86) and was Professor of Law at Stanford University (1975-77).  He is a member of the National Academy of Arbitrators and his extensive writing in the labor and employment law area includes numerous books and articles.

<P>By pursuing an area of academic emphasis in Employment Law, students acquire a special competence in that field by the time of graduation.  However, great care is taken to assure that members of the Center also cover the full spectrum of traditional legal training to prepare them for practice in other fields as well.  While possessing particular skills in Employment Law which are attractive to potential employers, the graduate is nevertheless free to embrace other career opportunities if he or she chooses.

<H2>Programs for Union Leaders</H2>

<P>Since 1989, the Center has sponsored two educational programs offered specifically for union officers and agents.  At the first full-day conference, prominent local attorneys and agency experts tackled the issues of IRS and Department of Labor <A HREF="http://www.dol.gov/dol/public/regs/main.htm">recordkeeping requirements and auditing programs</A> as well as problems of plant closings and in the duty of fair representation in arbitration.  The second Union Conference on Labor Law and Collective Bargaining focused first on the problems surrounding strikes, picketing and handbilling, and then shifted consideration to the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, and the finality of arbitration awards.

<H1>Health Care Reform Study Group</H1>

<P>The faculty of the Center for Health Law Studies and faculty
members of the University's School of Public Health and the
Center for Health Care Ethics formed a study group this fall to
discuss the proposed national health care reforms.  The group has
met monthly.  The exchange among the lawyers, the ethicists, the
health policy experts and the economists has been productive.

<P>The study group has broadened its reach.  At its January
meeting, the group invited James C. Stutz, St. Louis Area
Business Health Coalition, to provide a local focus on the impact
of health care reform.  In February, Bill Thompson, Senior Vice
President for Strategic Development of the SSM Health Care System
described the strategies currently being pursued by health care
systems in response to health care reform and other pressures.

<H2>Health Law Association: Thanks For A Successful Year</H2>

<P>Students and faculty of the Center for Health Law Studies are grateful to the 1994-95
officers of the student Health Law Association for providing a range of opportunities that greatly
enriched the experience of health law students at the School of Law.  The outgoing 1994-95
officers are David Frye, President; 
Donald Fritschie, Vice-President; Susan Buckley, Secretary; and Bart Baumstark, Treasurer. 
Under their direction, the Association offered three panels on the practice of health law; three
social events (including a joint law student/medical student event; a reception for faculty,
adjuncts and attorneys in the LL.M. health law program, and an end-of-year party) and volunteer
opportunities (including a St. Patrick's Day project in which health law students purchased and
assembled personal care kits for the homeless mentally ill at St. Patrick's Center).  

<HR>
<H3>"We are absolutely overwhelmed with both the quality and quantity of what the Association did.  It is of great importance and help to the Combined Health Appeal and its member agencies."</H3>
<B>Jane Evans, Exec. Dir., CHA</B>
<HR>

<p>Students in the Health Law Association made a significant contribution to the community
while gaining valuable experience when Association members participated in the 1995 SLU
Health Law Association/Combined Health Appeal Public Policy Project, Chaired by Doug
Freeman.  Students reviewed, analyzed and prepared summaries of pending Missouri legislation
on health-related issues for distribution by CHA to over twenty health agencies in Eastern
Missouri.

<h2><center><A NAME="pain"></A>SLU Students Participate in National Project on the
Regulation of Pain Relief</h2>
</center>
	The Center for Health Law Studies is one of three institutions participating in a national project
to study the effect of licensure and disciplinary actions on the availability of effective pain relief. 
The Mayday Foundation and the Kornfeld Foundation, both of New York City, funded this
project with a $165,000 grant to the American Society of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics.  The Center
for Health Law Studies, Yale Medical School, and Albert Einstein University/Montefiore
Hospital are the three institutions conducting research for the project.  <p>

	Empirical research on pain management has indicated serious deficiencies in the treatment of
pain.  Research indicates that 40% of white, male cancer patients suffer from treatable pain and
that the incidence of untreated but treatable pain is higher among women, minorities, the elderly
and the disabled.  Surveys of physicians repeatedly indicate that physicians may be aware that
they are undertreating their patients for pain.  In one survey, 30% of doctors reported that they
knowingly undertreated pain.  Physicians report that they undermedicate due to fear of
disciplinary sanction by the state licensure boards.  The backdrop of narcotics regulation in the
U.S. has led some to comment that people in pain have become victims of the war on drugs.  In
addition, scope of practice regulation of non-physician providers may limit effective access to
treatment.  <p>

Fifteen students are participating in the seminar on Medical Licensure and Discipline, which is
the focal point of the research being done at the School of Law under the direction of Professor
Sandra Johnson.  Eight of these students are working as a project task force to draft a model
statute and to research and write the supporting commentaries for the statute.  Among these law
students are Kevin Hennessey (a former narcotics enforcement officer), Judie Threatt (an
emergency room nurse), Pat Dennis and Jackie Barrow (health care managers), Farruk Ikbal (a

<H1>Saint Louis University Health Law Association/Combined Health
Appeal Public Policy Project</H1>

<P>The Health Law Association undertook a special public service
project with the Combined Health Appeal of Greater St. Louis. 
Combined Health Appeal (CHA) is a partner with United Way. 
Fifteen voluntary health agencies are members of CHA.  CHA serves
many other voluntary health organizations in the St. Louis area. 
The HLA/CHA Public Policy Project was initiated by a committee of
the board of the Combined Health Appeal.  This planning committee
included Jane Evans, Executive Director of CHA; Pat Knoerle,
Executive Director of the MS Society and member of the board of
CHA; and Sandra Johnson of the School of Law and member of CHA's
board.  As the project developed, Jennifer Techman and Doug
Freeman, law student members of HLA joined the committee.

<P>The Project had two main components.  The first was the
development of educational programs in health policy for CHA
members and other voluntary health agencies.  During the fall,
the Project hosted Michael Wolff, Counsel to the Governor and
faculty member (on leave) at the School of Law.  Prof. Wolff
described the Governor's Agenda in Health Care to a group of
approximately 70 agency directors.  The second component of the
project was the preparation of legislative summaries of bills
pending before the General Assembly.  Doug Freeman, second-year
law student who previously worked in legislative affairs, chaired
this part of the Project.  A group of HLA members screened
proposed legislation prefiled for submission to Missouri's
General Assembly and prepared summaries of relevant bills.  These
summaries, along with information on the legislative process at
the Assembly, an updated list of proposed legislation and other
information, were printed and delivered to CHA for dissemination
to interested voluntary health agencies.

<P>Law students who participated in the project include Doug
Freeman (Chair), Amy Jurevic, Sarah Rainey, Tom Sanders, Judith
El Amin, Don Fritschie, and Neela Kottmier.  

<P>CHA Executive Director Jane Evans was enthusiastic about this
first year of the project citing its helpfulness to those
agencies serving the health and social needs of persons with
chronic conditions or other illnesses.

<H1>Health Law Courses Offered in 1993-94</H1>

<P>Students interested in health law were able to choose from
among a dozen health law course offerings at the School of Law in
1993-94.  In addition, J.D. and LL.M. students are permitted to
take up to six credit hours offered by other Schools in the
University including the School of Public Health.

<P>The fall semester curriculum offered several health law
courses to J.D. and LL.M. students including Health Law; Food and
Drug Regulation; Child Abuse and Neglect; and Not-For-Profit
Organizations.  In addition, the Civil Clinic offered the In-
House Health Law Clinic and externships in health care settings. 
Students in the Health Law Clinic represented persons with HIV
and AIDS and families of persons with Alzheimers.  Students
participating in the Externship Program, conducted within the
Civil Clinic program, have the opportunity to select one of a
variety of placements.  These include the general counsel offices
of several local hospitals, the risk management office of St.
Louis University Hospital, and the Fraud and Abuse Task Force of
the U.S. Attorney's Office. 

<P>The spring term includes a wide selection of courses,
including Health Care Financing; Ethical Issues in Death and
Dying; AIDS, Public Health and the Law, as well as the Health Law
Clinic and the Externship Program.  Each of these courses have
been offered at the School of Law previously.  In addition, two
new offerings are available this Spring.  First, a new course in
Law and Bioethics has been added to the curriculum of the School
of Law and will be offered on a regular basis.  This course
covers a wide range of issues in bioethics.  Law and Bioethics
supplements the seminars already offered in bioethics by the
School of Law.  Professor Katherine Pratt is teaching a seminar
on the Tax Aspects of Health Care Reform.  In this seminar
students examine the tax policy and other public policy issues
involved in raising revenue for health care and in the tax
treatment of health benefits and health care expenses.

<H1>Health Law Association</H1>

<P>The Health Law Association presented an active calendar of
events for students at the School of Law this fall.  Two of the
Association's meetings focused on opportunities in the practice
of health law.  

<P>In the first, "What Is Health Law?," Charles Gilham (JD'88),
Senior Staff Legal Counsel, Department of Legal Services for Blue
Cross and a current LL.M. candidate at the School of Law, and
Richard Watters (JD'76), a partner in Lashly &amp; Baer P.C.,
described their practices in health law.

<P>In the second of the programs on practice opportunities, four
current J.D. students described their summer jobs in health law. 
Three of these students had just completed their first year
before taking these positions.  Denise Biehn clerked for the
Health Care Financing Administration in Baltimore for the first
2/3 of the summer.  She finished the summer as a Faculty Fellow
for Professor Johnson working on a treatise on health law.  Terri
Brenneman worked in the School's Health Law Clinic, providing
legal services to persons with AIDS and to families of person's
with Alzheimer's disease.  Dan Underwood worked for the in-house
counsel's office of Spectrum, a for-profit corporation that
provides emergency room physician services among other
enterprises.  Most of his time was spent reviewing physician
contracts and researching a variety of related issues.  Third-
year student Jennifer Techman described her work with the St.
Louis office of the Missouri Attorney General, a position she
held part-time during the school year and full-time during the
summer.  In her position, Techman worked on a broad range of
health-related and other issues.

<P>The Association also sponsored two programs on substantive
issues in health law.  Professor Jesse Goldner and Fr. Patrick
Norris, of the University's Center for Health Care Ethics,
discussed the interrelationship of law, medicine and ethics. 
Their discussion focused on two cases: the refusal of a
transfusion by a Jehovah's Witness and a situation in which a
spouse tests HIV positive.  In both of these cases, the speakers
first emphasized the importance of accurate and complete facts
and an effective search for alternatives, and then addressed the
situation from the perspectives of law and ethics.  In the second
of these programs, Professor Sandra Johnson and Professor
Katherine Pratt discussed Clinton's Health Care Reform.  Johnson
presented the outlines of the program, relating the structure of
the program to four of the program's stated goals.  Pratt
analyzed the tax policy aspects of raising the revenue for the
proposed reform.

<P>This Spring, the Association will co-sponsor a presentation by
Lawrence O. Gostin on "The Interconnected Epidemics of AIDS and
TB" on March 17.  Mr. Gostin is the keynote speaker for the
Annual Health Law Symposium on March 18.  The Association will
also sponsor a brown bag on course selection in health law and
will sponsor a reception for the health law faculty and LL.M.
candidates.

<P>The officers of the Association for 1993-1994 are Denise Biehn
(President); Terri Brenneman (Vice-President); Dan Underwood
(Treasurer) and Jennifer Techman (Secretary).

<H1>Study On Medical Futility Policies</H1>

<P>Jesse Goldner (Law), and Richard L. Wiener (Arts and Sciences)
received a grant from the Beaumont Fund to study medical futility
policies adopted by hospitals.  A national survey of hospitals
inquiring about such policies and related policies on life-
sustaining treatment will be conducted under the grant and will
provide data for analysis.  Vincent P. Gibbons, M.D.  of
Departments of Pediatrics and Neurology at the School of
Medicine, and Professor Sandra H. Johnson are also working on the
project.

<H1>Oxford House Case</H1>

<P>In a lawsuit won by the Clinical Program of Saint Louis
University School of Law, a federal court in St. Louis has ruled
that the City of St. Louis, under the prior administration of
Mayor Vincent Schoemehl, discriminated against the handicapped in
its efforts to close two group homes.  The group homes are Oxford
Houses, which are drug-free homes for recovering alcoholics and
addicts.  The City attempted to close the two Oxford Houses
through discriminatory enforcement of its zoning code.

<P>United States Magistrate Judge Catherine Perry of the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri ruled
on January 28, 1994 that the City had violated several federal
civil rights laws forbidding discrimination against the
handicapped.  The Court noted that all the evidence established
that Oxford Houses did not negatively affect the neighbors and
did not lower property values or increase crime or traffic in the
neighborhoods -- although neighbors often fear those adverse
effects at first.

<P>Oxford House is a nationally recognized program, proven
successful in the effort to help individuals overcome addiction. 
It is supported by a federal loan program signed into law by
President Ronald Reagan in 1988 and supported by both
presidential administrations since then.  The Oxford House model
has three basic rules; (1) <EM>democratic self-governance,</EM>
which means that the houses are run by the recovering individuals
themselves, (2) <EM>economic self-sufficiency,</EM> which means
that the house members work and support the house without
government subsidy (i.e., the loans are repaid), and (3) <EM>zero
drug tolerance,</EM> which means that a member is expelled for
any use of drugs or alcohol.

<P>Legal Services of Eastern Missouri co-counselled the case with
Professor Herb Eastman of the Clinic.  Law students helped
prepare every phase of the case for trial and examined witnesses
at the trial.

<H2>Law Students in the Hospital</H2>

<P>As a first step in a new "exchange" program for law students and medical students at the
University, Tuesday morning became "surgery day" for health law students at the School of Law. 
Each Tuesday morning, two law students dressed in scrubs and observed surgery and
anesthesiology in the OR at the VA hospital.  About a dozen students were able to take
advantage of this program this Spring.  Medical students and residents were invited to participate
in the School's trial advocacy program as jurors, giving them a chance to see behind the closed
door of the jury room.  Dr. Frank Johnson, Chief of Surgery at the VA Hospital and Professor of
Surgery for Saint Louis University School of Medicine, and Professor Jesse Goldner have
established this new program for law and medical students at the University.  This program will
be further developed in 1995-1996 when medical students and residents will receive more
exposure to trial practice and law students will be able to get a first-hand look at a broader range
of hospital administration and medical practice.

<p>Law student Amy Jurevic developed an additional opportunity for law students this
Spring.  Law students observed clinical rounds in the pulmonary intensive care unit at Barnes
Hospital in St. Louis.  Ms. Jurevic accompanied each pair of law students as they joined
physicians in bedside visits.

<HR>

<H2>Law Students Awarded</H2>

<p><b>Amy Jurevic</b> and <b>Lori Desnick</b> each received a $1,000 scholarship in healthcare
administration from the Catholic Health Association of the United States.  The scholarship will
support their studies in the joint JD/MHA program of the School of Law and the School of
Public Health.

<HR>

<H2>1995-96 HLA OFFICERS</H2>

<P>Incoming officers are Robert Harrison, President; Jim Guest, Vice-President; Morris Scott, Secretary; and, Rob Wilson, Treasurer.  The Association looks forward to another challenging
year.

students.  In order to earn the certificate, the student must complete a minimum of ten credit
hours in specialized health law courses; gain supervised experience in health law practice; submit
a publishable paper on a health law issue; and participate in the Center's Colloquia on Health
Care Law.

<p>Twenty-six current second-year students have enrolled in the program and have
completed their colloquium requirement.  First-year students are currently registering to begin
the program in Fall, 1995, when they enter their second year.  Seven third-year students intend to
graduate with the certificate this May.  

<P>Colloquia topics covered in 1994-95 included The Role of Managed Competition in
Public Sector Health Care; The Practical Effect of Malpractice Reform on Litigation; Litigating
to Increase Access to Health Care; Integrating Health Care Delivery Systems; Ethics Committees
and Medical Futility; and The ADA:  Health Insurance, Employment and Medical Treatment
Decisions.  The Colloquia were conducted by faculty members and practicing attorneys and other
health care experts.  We are grateful to: <b>Sr. Judith Carron</b> (Cardinal Glennon Hospital); <b>Donna
Harper</b> (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission); <b>James Hullverson, Jr.</b> (The Hullverson
Law Firm); <b>Greg Kuhn</b> (Mercer Company); <b>Ann Lever</b> (Legal Services of Eastern Missouri);
<b>Peter F. Spataro (Moser &amp; Marsalek); Sheldon Weinhaus</b> (Levin and Weinhaus); and <b>James
Wiehl</b> (Sonnenschein, Nath and Rosenthal).

<H1>Changing the Environment for the Delivery of Mental Health Services</H1>

<p>Over 130 lawyers, health care professionals and law students attended the Center for
Health Law Studies/Saint Louis University Law Journal conference on "Changing the
Environment of the Delivery of Mental Health Services" at the School of Law on March 24.  The
Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior of the University's School of Medicine co-sponsored.

<p>Dr. Howard Goldman, Professor of Psychiatry and Director of Mental Health Policies at
the University of Maryland, set the foundation for the conference in the opening address.  Dr.
Goldman related current developments in the theories, methods and delivery of mental health
services to the history of mental health care policy in the U.S.

<HR>

<H3>"A wonderful program"... "Quality of speakers was excellent"... "Very timely"... "My gratitude and appreciation to the Center for all its work."</H3>
<B>Conference attendees</B>

<HR>  

<p>Many conference speakers identified managed care as a current major force that is having
far-reaching effects on the delivery of mental health services.  Speakers and conference
attendees, many of whom were mental health professionals who direct managed care programs or
who provide services under managed care contracts, discussed the nature of professional
responsibilities toward patients; issues in evaluating the effectiveness of mental health therapies
and the quality of mental health services; the basics of managed care contracting; and the
influence of disability discrimination laws, among other timely topics.  

<p>The plenary speakers, each of whom will publish in the Law Journal Symposium,
included Dr. Goldman; Leonard Rubenstein (Exec. Director of the Bazelon Center for Mental
Health Law); Philip Boyle (Hastings Center); John Petrila (Chair of the Department of Mental
Health Law and Policy, University of South Florida); Dorothy McMurtry (Asst. U.S. Attorney)
and John Munich (Asst. Atty. General).   	

<p>Workshops focussing on the changing environment included Mental Health in Long
Term Care (George Grossberg and Cathy Goldstein, Department of Psychiatry and Human
Behavior, St. Louis University);  Managed Care (Abby Wasserman, United Behavioral Systems,
and Greg Kuhn, William Mercer, Inc.); Substance Abuse (David Ohlms, SSM Recovery
Centers); and State Mental Health Systems (Joseph Parks, M.D., Missouri Department of Mental
Health).  Roundtable sessions on specific issues included Confidentiality and Records (Susan
Spiegel, Personal Performance Consultants); Contracting with Managed Care Entities (Brian
Andrew, Greensfelder, Hemker &amp; Gale, and Jill Hummel, BJC Health System); Licensure and
Scope of Practice (Daniel P. Card, II, Paule, Camazine &amp; Blumenthal); and Research Agenda
(Richard Wiener, Department of Psychology, St. Louis University, and Maria Hall, School of
Public, St. Louis University).  We appreciate the contribution that each of these speakers made to
the quality of the program.  

<p>The 1995-1996 Health Law Symposium of the Saint Louis University Law Journal will
publish articles based on the major papers presented at the conference.  Diane Turpin has been
named as editor of the Symposium issue.

<h2>CENTER IN THE NEWS</h2>

<p>The health law program at the School of Law ranked <STRONG>first</STRONG> among health law programs in the nation's law schools in a survey conducted and published by the <b>U.S. News &amp; World Report</b>
in March.  This was SLU's third time to be ranked among the top health law programs nationally in the U.S. News.  SLU ranked second in 1992 and in 1994 and first this year.  The <b>Missouri
Lawyers Weekly</b> reported this recognition of the SLU program by experts in the field.

<p>A <b>New York Times</b> article on the growth of health law as a specialty practice highlighted
the SLU health law program.  The article described health law as a strong area of law practice,
especially as a result of the current restructuring of the health care industry, and briefly described
the health law curriculum at SLU.  [Robert Pear, "Revolution in Health Care Industry Means Big
Business for Specialist Lawyers," NYT, 1/13/95.]  The article was reprinted in the <b>Chicago Law
Bulletin</b> and was distributed by the National Health Lawyers Association to its membership.

<p><b>Student Lawyer</b>, a magazine published by the ABA Law Student Division, quoted at
length from the <I>St. Louis University law Journal</I> in an April, 1995 article on medical research. 
The Student Lawyer article quoted an article by Professor Jay Katz which appeared as the lead
article in the Journal's 1993 Health Law Symposium.  Katz's article had been quoted previously
in the <b>New York Times</b>, the <b>Baltimore Evening Sun</b>, the <b>L.A. Daily News</b> and others.

<hr>
<p><font size=5><em>Some of the world's best skiing awaits for you in Innsbruck, the Olympic Capital of the Alps</em></font>.</p>
<p align=center><font color="#FF0000"><font size=5><em>Departures every Friday</em></font></font></p>
<p>Here you can ski 6 different areas at your heart's content. The free &quot;Ski-Bus&quot; takes you to any of these outstanding ski-locations. Every day you can try a different 
run! Or, if you want, visit more of the region or go as far as Venice, Salzburg or the Royal Castles of Germany with day trips. </p>
<p>Incomparable Innsbruck, surrounded by timeless villages and towering peaks, marries centuries of cultural heritage with modern wintersports facilities befitting the 
capital of Tyrol. Twice the Winter Olympic Host City, Innsbruck offers all the very best for skiers and non-skiers of every age and interest. Innsbruck is a 
sightseer's paradise, stroll down arcaded streets; visit churches, museums and palaces; investigate tiny craft shops and modern department stores; relax in rustic 
cafes with apple strudel and music. Or catch the ski-bus, free also to non-skiers, to the surrounding villages to explore many kilometers of cleared walking paths 
and take a ski-lift to one of the scenic mountain restaurants. You can also try your skating at the Olympic Stadium, look over the fames bobsled run at Igls or even 
more famous Berhisel ski-jump, perched above the city. Ski bobs and toboggans can be hired and, indoor, there is tennis, squash, heated swimming pools, sauna 
and nine-pin bowling</p>

</ol>
<h3><a name="des_info">Destination Information</a></h3>
<p>For all groups we will first prepare a sketch itinerary for your perusal and acceptance. Some general destination information is given at this time along with the NET 
rate per passengers. All services to be rendered at the destination are specifically listed</p>
<p>At time of final documents (usually 30 days before departure of the group) a full destination itinerary including Art, Architecture, Cuisine highlights is prepared and 
sent to you for distribution to the group. This information is very complete and, depending on the country visited, can be a small volume of 50/60 pages or more.</p>
<p>Maps are also usually available and we request as much material as possible from all the airlines and Tourist Offices of the various countries in order to provide you 
with the maximum possible information as possible from all the airlines and Tourist Offices of the various countries in order to provide you with the maximum 
possible information</p>
<h3><a name="ht_inf">Hotel Information</a></h3>
<p>It&#146;s by a judicious choice of hotels that Vantage has become a leader in first-class touring. Your hotel will vary in style, size of room, amenities, yet all share high 
ratings in their category and convenient locations. We offer the best city hotels but, where possible, we have also selected the more intimate private villas and small 
castles (mostly in Europe) for a unique experience. Generally, each hotel been selected because it stood above the others for ambiance, service and value. Our 
<strong>ECOLOGICAL AREAS</strong> programs include comfortable hotels in, or as close as possible, to the natural parks. Please remember that they may be &#147;rustic&#148;, 
compared to city hotels, as the emphasis is on nature, not staying at a resort. </p>
<p>Hotels, especially outside the main cities, are also quite different from the ones you are used to in the USA. Rooms are usually smaller, especially singles, with triple 
rooms really cramped! We do not recommend them for comfort. Air-conditioning is not present everywhere &#151; actually only some of the hotels have it. 
Nevertheless they offer precious &#147;experiences&#148; you would not find on your own.</p>
<p>The type of hotels vary greatly from one country to the other and reflect the specific laws of each destination. Classification is not constant and varies greatly 
between countries.<font size=4><strong> Also rates vary greatly in the same category depending on the location of the hotel, expect to pay double 
or more for a centrally located hotel. This where you need to be careful in comparing quotes to see if you are really 
comparing &quot;apples to apples&quot;</strong></font>. To ease the choice of hotels we use an internal general classification which defines hotels as per services:</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>TOURIST CLASS</strong></font><strong> -</strong> Suited for general travel, they are usually smaller, family run hotels providing basic services but without the amenities found in the other class 
of hotels. They offer private bathroom and small public areas with small restaurants or cafeterias</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>SUPERIOR TOURIST </strong></font><strong>-</strong> A definite higher grade, they are usually larger in some cases belonging to international chains and offer many of the services found in 
First Class Hotels but with not as high a ratio of &quot;employee to client&quot;. Restaurants here seem to cater mostly to groups</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>FIRST CLASS</strong></font> - Larger and better, with good public areas, bars and restaurants patronized by the locals. Rooms have more amenities and the location is usually 
more central</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>SUPERIOR FIRST CLASS</strong></font><strong> </strong>- Sometimes it is difficult to see the differences between a Superior First Class and a Deluxe establishment - probably there is one 
only in the rate</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>DELUXE</strong></font> - The very best a location can offer, these 5 ***** star properties are the ultimate in luxury on beautiful grounds with saunas, swimming pools, fitness 
centers, most of the times tennis courts and even a golf course. Restaurants are superb and quite pricey but usually offer the best selection in international dining </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>UNIQUE PROPERTY</strong></font> - Many of our properties fall in this category as we tend to use private villas, small castles and palaces for the true connoisseurs. Service 
vary greatly from one hotel to the other as all are historical buildings with a limited amount of possible restoration that can be done to them. Most are located 
outside the cities and offer splendid and unique accommodation. Especially suited for small and knowledgeable groups.&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="gua_dep">Using a &quot;GUARANTEED DEPARTURE&quot; for a group</a></h3>
<p>&#160;All of our Brochure Departures are suited for group travel and offer many advantages. The worst thing that can happen with a group is to <font color="#FF0000"><font size=4><em><strong>CANCEL</strong></em></font></font> the 
departure because of lack of participation. This can unfortunately happen very often as individual programs can change unexpectedly.</p>
<p>If you have selected a <font color="#FF0000"><strong>&quot;GUARANTEED DEPARTURE&quot; </strong></font>your passengers will depart regardless of the amount of participants to the group! Most group agents 
are using this method to eliminate the possibility of cancellation and the added bonus is that all our itineraries are quite unique and include most of what you wanted 
to include in your group&#160; </p>
<h3><a name="adv_grp">Adventure Travel for Groups</a></h3>
<p>It is possible to use Adventure programs for a group departure. As we have stated earlier, our Guaranteed Departure can be used for a group. The consideration 
you need to have if you want to operate an Adventure Program is 'to the group&quot;. They need to be in good physical form, aware of the destination and must be 
provided with the maximum information possible. Vantage will help you establish the guidelines for your Adventure Group&#160; </p>
<h3><a name="hot_deal">Hot Deals for Groups</a></h3>
<p>If you are looking for the best rates consider traveling to any destination in their OFF-SEASON. This will give you the best buying power (Europe in winter for 
instance) and the added pleasure of visiting locations without the usual swarms of visitors usually found in their high season. Hotels will be ready to give us special 
deals and, as we pass on to you the savings, we will be able to include more for the money. Consider the off-season for all your travel needs</p>
<h3><a name="grp_org">GROUP ORGANIZERS</a></h3>
<p>Many people who belong to a group, association, club or congregation are ideally suited for organizing groups to travel to different destinations. The advantages are 
many, one of them free travel for the organizer on the promoted group. Some organizers have progressed from handling one group to having many departures 
during the year and, although it requires a lot of pleasant work, is very rewarding for the rifht person If you are interested in organizing a group please <font color="#FF0000"><strong>CALL US</strong></font>.</p>

<h2>AN INCENTIVE PLANNER</h2>
<p>This incentive planner is a ready-reference tool to help corporate executives plan, design and execute successful incentive programs . . . programs that will increase 
a company's bottom line profits. Everyone knows that travel incentives work, but few understand why and how they work. In the pages that follow, we will try to 
show you how to make incentives work for you. By following a simple, step-by-step procedure, and working together with the travel incentive experts at 
VANTAGE, you can design the correct program for your needs. </p>
<h3><a name="phi">Philosophy of Incentives</a></h3>
<p>Let's take a moment to examine the philosophy of incentives. Any corporation considering the introduction of incentives into its marketing strategy has the right to 
ask, &quot;Why incentives? We're already paying people to produce&#151;why should we do more?'' </p>
<p>Very simple: People are only human, and by human nature, no matter how well paid, establish a level of effort or performance somewhere below 100% of their 
potential or ability. Psychologists call this characteristic, ''developing levels of comfortability.''</p>
<p>Once a person has reached his or her own personal ''!eve! of comfortability&quot;, the drive for additional productivity levels off. We see this most readily in sales 
people. It's axiomatic that the top 20% of any sales force accounts for 80% of a company's business. These top salespeople are already well compensated for their 
selling efforts . . . and the 80% don't seem to produce more by dangling the carrot of additional cash before them. All of these people could earn more at any time, 
simply by selling more. In other words, while money might initially serve as a strong force to motivate a salesperson. . . other needs overshadow its effectiveness as 
the salesperson grows to consider himself or herself financially successful.</p>
<p>Incentives in the form of travel especially motivate people out of their self-set plateau&#151;spur new effort get new results and prove to the person that he, or she, can 
achieve and maintain higher plateaus at or nearer to 100% of his or her ability. The same rules that apply to a sales force, apply to all levels of marketing: to 
distributors, dealers, retailers, etc. </p>
<h3>Planning Your Incentive Program</h3>
<p>There are nine simple steps in planning your incentive program.</p>
<h4><a name="obj">1. Define Your Objective</a></h4>
<p>The objective of the vast majority of travel incentive programs is to increase profits by selling more of a company's products or services. However, there are many 
ways to achieve this objective:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sell the full product line&#183; </li>
<li>Concentrate on high-profit items&#183; </li>
<li>Open new accounts</li>
<li>Introduce a new product</li>
<li>Move old inventory</li>
<li>Load dealers or distributors</li>
<li>Obtain more shelf space</li>
<li>Install dealer displays</li>
<li>Obtain early orders</li>
<li>Make more sales calls</li>
</ul>
<p>The list can go on, and often more than one of these objectives can be the goal of your campaign. However, whatever your objective, it must be well-defined in 
your mind. . . and it must be communicated clearly to the people you wish to motivate.</p>
<h4><a name="par">2. Select Participants</a></h4>
<p>Having defined the goal you wish to accomplish, you must next select the group of people you wish to motivate. While it is best to include everyone in an incentive 
campaign who can affect the end result of the program, it is not always economically or legally possible. In states where retailers are forbidden to participate in an 
incentive program {such as is the case with liquor retailers], you may have no other choice but to go to your own sales force or to wholesalers or distributor 
principals and/or their salespeople. In other instances you may wish, budget permitting, to include dealers in your incentive effort.</p>
<h4>3. Establish The Program Duration</h4>
<p>Incentive programs usually run from six months to a year. This relatively long time period is usually necessary to justify the cost of the award. The exact duration is 
determined by you, but remember to allow enough time to permit participants to earn their travel award. Since travel is a large award, and since participants earn 
that award by additional or incremental business, you must make certain you give them sufficient time and opportunity to win. You cannot, for example, reasonably 
expect dealers to purchase six months worth of product from you in two months. They may, however, be able to attain that goal in a four or five month time period. </p>
<h4><a name="awa">4. Determine Awards</a></h4>
<p>There is no better incentive award than travel. </p>
<h4>5. Select Quality Award FuffilIment</h4>
<p>Many criteria are used to select the perfect destination for your incentive travel program after all you will be sending your most important people to the travel 
destination you select for your program (your top salespeople, your best distributors, or biggest retailers). These are the people who make your business what it is. 
Therefore, it is paramount that the trip they win be one that they remember fondly, for years to come. Using Vantage, you can rest assured that the end justifies the 
means. Having run Incentive programs for over 20 years, we understand that personalized attention is every step of the way. Every detail is planned well in 
advance: Itineraries are suggested, programs are structured, and winners needs are attended to.</p>
<h4><a name="str">6. Establish Program Rules</a></h4>
<p>You, and our Incentive expert, have defined your objective, determined the program participants, set the length of the campaign and selected the travel destination. 
The next step is to establish the program rules. When structuring the rules of your program, make certain that:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are simple and easy to understand</li>
<li>The goals are attainable</li>
<li>You are rewarding a participant commensurately with the effort needed to win a travel award</li>
<li>The results are measurable</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, you must define each participant's personal objective in terms of what he or she must do to earn a travel award:</p>
<p>&#183; Exceed previous year's sales for the same period by X %</p>
<ul>
<li>&#183; Sell $ X of a specific product</li>
<li>&#183; Meet 100% of an established sales objective</li>
<li>&#183; Be one of the top (ten) salespeople during the program period</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish, you may decide to divide participants into groups of similar sales potential and reward the top performers in each group. You may also choose to utilize 
an open-end budget [whereby every participant can win a trip if he or she achieves a specified sales objective] or, you may use a closed-end budget {rewarding 
only top performers). Whatever the rules, they are yours to determine. However, should you have any questions, our representative will be there to assist you in 
correctly structuring your incentive travel program.</p>
<h4><a name="pro">7. Promote Your Program</a></h4>
<p>Good promotion is the key to a successful incentive program. It introduces the program, serves as a constant reminder to participants about the program rules and 
award opportunity, and motivates people to action. Vantage will help you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select an exciting theme for your program.</li>
<li>Announce the program via a special announcement mailing or at a ''kick-off'' meeting, where possible. (Get all levels of management involved in supporting 
the program). </li>
<li>Utilize a mail campaign [preferably to the home of participants]. Arrange for at least one promotional mailing per month. Mailings can be: </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>a ) monthly standings reports telling participants how close they've come to earning their travel award <br>
b) travel brochures on the destinations <br>
c) campaign letters, spiced with sales messages and trip details, etc. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>and to:</p>
<ol>
<li>4. List participants names and home or business addresses </li>
<li>5. Assign sales or purchase objectives and rcord, monthly, actual sales or purchase results </li>
<li>6. Issue standings {progress] reports and Notify winners </li>
<li>7. Evaluate results</li>
</ol>
<h4><a name="bud">8. Determine Incentive Budget</a></h4>
<p>How much is it worth to increase sales five percent? Ten percent? Twenty percent? We will help, but only you can determine that figure. When planning your 
incentive budget, you can choose from one of two budget plans &quot;closed-end&quot; or ''open-end.'' As previously mentioned, a ''closed-end&quot; budget is pre-determined at 
a fixed amount regardless of sales performance, i.e. you allocate S20,000 for the incentive travel budget, allow S 1,000 per trip and have 20 winners. An 
''open-end'' budget increases as more participants reach and exceed their assigned incentive objectives. Whenever possible, it is preferable to utilize an open-end 
budget, since participants compete only against themselves and are judged by their own performance. Budgets are usually determined as a percentage of sales or 
purchases, i.e. 2% of sales. First, determine how many travel dollars an average participant can earn by reaching a given objective. Then compute how many travel 
dollars are necessary for a winning participant to pay for his or her own trip. Lastly, estimate the number of winners you expect the program to generate. The sum 
of these figures will be your award budget. To this figure, add promotional and administrative costs.</p>
<p>Once again, your Vantage Representatives will work with you, every step of the way, providing a range of itineraries that can fit your needs and award budget. 
Whether your company is large or small, whether you're planning a motivational campaign for 20 people or 200 people, Vantage can make the job of planning your 
next travel incentive program a lot easier.</p>

<h4>As fellow passengers on Planet Earth, all travelers share a responsibility to respect the dignity and diversity of other cultures and to care for the 
renewable natural resources at each travel destination so that they may be enjoyed by generations yet to come. We also believe that travel is the 
natural right of all people and is a crucial ingredient of world peace and understanding. Hence our programs encourage the growth of a peaceful 
tourism and environmentally-responsible travel in adherence with the main <font size=4>ASTA</font> guidelines which follow: </h4>
<ol>
<li>Respect the fragility of your Earth. Realize that unless all are willing to help in its preservation, unique and beautiful destinations may not be here for future 
generations to enjoy. </li>
<li>Leave only footprints. Take only photographs. No graffiti! No litter! Do not take away &quot;souvenirs&quot; from historical sites and natural areas. </li>
<li>To make your travels more meaningful, educate yourself about the geography, customs, manners, and cultures of the regions you visit. Take time to listen to 
the people. Encourage local conservation efforts. </li>
<li>Respect the privacy and dignity of others. Get permission before photographing people. </li>
<li>Do not buy products made from endangered plants and animals, such as ivory, tortoise shell, animal skins and feathers. Read &quot;Know Before You Go,&quot; the 
U.S. Customs list of products which may not be imported. </li>
<li>Follow designated trails. Do not disturb animals, plants, or their natural habitats </li>
<li>Learn about and support conservation-oriented programs and organizations working to preserve the environment. </li>
<li>Whenever possible walk or utilize environmentally-sound methods of transportation. Encourage drivers of public vehicles to stop engines when parked. </li>
<li>Patronize suppliers that advance energy and environmental conservation, water and air quality, recycling, safe management of waste and toxic materials, 
noise abatement, community involvement, and that provide experienced, well-trained staff dedicated to strong principles of conservation. </li>

<h3><a name="gr_inf">Group Information</a></h3>
<p>The more information you can give us at the time of requesting a quote and itinerary, the better we will be able to serve you. Of course certain services will 
automatically be included (we will include a professional escort and city guides for visits wherever necessary - all our hotel will have private bathrooms except 
specific cases like Treetops in Kenya which does not have any private bathrooms available - all motorcoaches are deluxe for the country visited etc.etc.). We will 
also need information on the following specific items:</p>
<h5>GENERAL INFORMATION</h5>
<ol>
<li>What period of time are you planning to operate your group ?</li>
<li>How many people are you considering for the group participation ?</li>
<li>What destination are you thinking on promoting ?</li>
<li>How long will your visit be in the destination country ?</li>
<li>If more than one country is considered how long to you intend to stay in each country ?</li>
<li>Is there a specific reason for the visit or is it just a vacations ?</li>
<li>Are you planning to depart from one city or do you have passengers scattered in different states ?</li>
<li>What is the medium age of your group ?</li>
<li>Do your passengers have any specific interests ?</li>
<li>Are all passengers mobile (especially necessary on adventurous programs) ?</li>
</ol>
<h5>HOTELS &amp; MEALS</h5>
<ol>
<li>What type of hotels are you considering ? Tourist - First Class - Deluxe Hotels ? (In most countries hotel classification is not the same as in the USA)</li>
<li>How many meals do you want to include each day ? </li>
<li>Continental breakfast is becoming more popular in hotels - do you want to include American or Buffet breakfast instead ?</li>
<li>Are you considering any special functions ? (Welcome or Farewell Dinners or else)</li>
<li>Would you want to have some of the meals in local restaurants ?</li>
<li>Do you want to have some evenings planned (meals and entertainment)</li>
</ol>
<h5>TOURING</h5>
<ol>
<li>Do you want to include regular tours or specialized visits (especially for museum groups etc.) ?</li>
<li>Do you want to include private collections, villas etc., (if possible) ?</li>
<li>Are you considering using trains (if available) for portions of the trip ?</li>
<li>Would you prefer a large motorcoach even for a small group for convenience ?</li>
<li>Do you plan to include ALL visits or to leave some as optionals for the passengers ?</li>
<li>Have you already sketched an itinerary for your group (please fax it or e-mail it to us) ?</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="des_info">Destination Information</a></h3>
<p>For all groups we will first prepare a sketch itinerary for your perusal and acceptance. Some general destination information is given at this time along with the NET 
rate per passengers. All services to be rendered at the destination are specifically listed</p>
<p>At time of final documents (usually 30 days before departure of the group) a full destination itinerary including Art, Architecture, Cuisine highlights is prepared and 
sent to you for distribution to the group. This information is very complete and, depending on the country visited, can be a small volume of 50/60 pages or more.</p>
<p>Maps are also usually available and we request as much material as possible from all the airlines and Tourist Offices of the various countries in order to provide you 
with the maximum possible information as possible from all the airlines and Tourist Offices of the various countries in order to provide you with the maximum 
possible information</p>
<h3><a name="ht_inf">Hotel Information</a></h3>
<p>It&#146;s by a judicious choice of hotels that Vantage has become a leader in first-class touring. Your hotel will vary in style, size of room, amenities, yet all share high 
ratings in their category and convenient locations. We offer the best city hotels but, where possible, we have also selected the more intimate private villas and small 
castles (mostly in Europe) for a unique experience. Generally, each hotel been selected because it stood above the others for ambiance, service and value. Our 
<strong>ECOLOGICAL AREAS</strong> programs include comfortable hotels in, or as close as possible, to the natural parks. Please remember that they may be &#147;rustic&#148;, 
compared to city hotels, as the emphasis is on nature, not staying at a resort. </p>
<p>Hotels, especially outside the main cities, are also quite different from the ones you are used to in the USA. Rooms are usually smaller, especially singles, with triple 
rooms really cramped! We do not recommend them for comfort. Air-conditioning is not present everywhere &#151; actually only some of the hotels have it. 
Nevertheless they offer precious &#147;experiences&#148; you would not find on your own.</p>
<p>The type of hotels vary greatly from one country to the other and reflect the specific laws of each destination. Classification is not constant and varies greatly 
between countries.<font size=4><strong> Also rates vary greatly in the same category depending on the location of the hotel, expect to pay double 
or more for a centrally located hotel. This where you need to be careful in comparing quotes to see if you are really 
comparing &quot;apples to apples&quot;</strong></font>. To ease the choice of hotels we use an internal general classification which defines hotels as per services:</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>TOURIST CLASS</strong></font><strong> -</strong> Suited for general travel, they are usually smaller, family run hotels providing basic services but without the amenities found in the other class 
of hotels. They offer private bathroom and small public areas with small restaurants or cafeterias</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>SUPERIOR TOURIST </strong></font><strong>-</strong> A definite higher grade, they are usually larger in some cases belonging to international chains and offer many of the services found in 
First Class Hotels but with not as high a ratio of &quot;employee to client&quot;. Restaurants here seem to cater mostly to groups</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>FIRST CLASS</strong></font> - Larger and better, with good public areas, bars and restaurants patronized by the locals. Rooms have more amenities and the location is usually 
more central</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>SUPERIOR FIRST CLASS</strong></font><strong> </strong>- Sometimes it is difficult to see the differences between a Superior First Class and a Deluxe establishment - probably there is one 
only in the rate</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>DELUXE</strong></font> - The very best a location can offer, these 5 ***** star properties are the ultimate in luxury on beautiful grounds with saunas, swimming pools, fitness 
centers, most of the times tennis courts and even a golf course. Restaurants are superb and quite pricey but usually offer the best selection in international dining </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>UNIQUE PROPERTY</strong></font> - Many of our properties fall in this category as we tend to use private villas, small castles and palaces for the true connoisseurs. Service 
vary greatly from one hotel to the other as all are historical buildings with a limited amount of possible restoration that can be done to them. Most are located 
outside the cities and offer splendid and unique accommodation. Especially suited for small and knowledgeable groups.&#160;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="gua_dep">Using a &quot;GUARANTEED DEPARTURE&quot; for a group</a></h3>
<p>&#160;All of our Brochure Departures are suited for group travel and offer many advantages. The worst thing that can happen with a group is to <font color="#FF0000"><font size=4><em><strong>CANCEL</strong></em></font></font> the 
departure because of lack of participation. This can unfortunately happen very often as individual programs can change unexpectedly.</p>
<p>If you have selected a <font color="#FF0000"><strong>&quot;GUARANTEED DEPARTURE&quot; </strong></font>your passengers will depart regardless of the amount of participants to the group! Most group agents 
are using this method to eliminate the possibility of cancellation and the added bonus is that all our itineraries are quite unique and include most of what you wanted 
to include in your group&#160; </p>
<h3><a name="adv_grp">Adventure Travel for Groups</a></h3>
<p>It is possible to use Adventure programs for a group departure. As we have stated earlier, our Guaranteed Departure can be used for a group. The consideration 
you need to have if you want to operate an Adventure Program is 'to the group&quot;. They need to be in good physical form, aware of the destination and must be 
provided with the maximum information possible. Vantage will help you establish the guidelines for your Adventure Group&#160; </p>
<h3><a name="hot_deal">Hot Deals for Groups</a></h3>
<p>If you are looking for the best rates consider traveling to any destination in their OFF-SEASON. This will give you the best buying power (Europe in winter for 
instance) and the added pleasure of visiting locations without the usual swarms of visitors usually found in their high season. Hotels will be ready to give us special 
deals and, as we pass on to you the savings, we will be able to include more for the money. Consider the off-season for all your travel needs</p>
<h3><a name="grp_org">GROUP ORGANIZERS</a></h3>
<p>Many people who belong to a group, association, club or congregation are ideally suited for organizing groups to travel to different destinations. The advantages are 
many, one of them free travel for the organizer on the promoted group. Some organizers have progressed from handling one group to having many departures 
during the year and, although it requires a lot of pleasant work, is very rewarding for the rifht person If you are interested in organizing a group please <font color="#FF0000"><strong>CALL US</strong></font>.</p>

<p align=left><font color="#804040"><strong>Zimbabwe </strong></font>- like Botswana, is a landlocked country at the base of the African continent. Its neighbours are Mozambique (to the east), South Africa and Botswana 
(to the south and west), and Zambia (to the north). Zimbabwe lies on a high plateau, and its terrain consists primarily of grasslands bordered on the east by 
mountains. The northeastern border of the country is marked by the mighty Zambezi River, along which is located the incomparable spectacle of Victoria Falls and 
the magnificent expanse of Lake Kariba. The Zambezi has become one of the world's best water adventure travel destinations, offering outstanding whitewater 
rafting in the Zambezi Gorges below the falls as well as excellent canoeing and kayaking above them</p>

skies and a population density which is among the lowest in the world it creates a sense of freedom in ebveryone. Along its entire length, the vast shifting sand dunes 
of the Namib Desert spread inland for 50 to 80 miles. In the interior one finds the vast sand basin of the Kalahari. In the far northwest the 25,500 sq miles of the 
Kaokoland mountains run along the coast, while further inland lies the Etosha Pan (a dried-out saline lake), surrounded by grasslands and bush which support a 
large and varied wildlife. The Etosha National Park &amp; Game Reserve is one of the finest in Africa, in that it remains, to a large extent, free of man's influence.</p>

<hr>
<h2 align=left>GENERAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p align=left>Italy's instantly recognisable boot shape kicks its way into the Mediterranean Sea. The islands of Elba, Sardinia, Ischia, Capri, the Aeolians and Sicily lie offshore. 
Mountains feature prominently in Italy's topography, and bolster its landlocked borders all the way from Genoa in the west to Trieste in the east. Italy's backbone is 
formed by the Apennines, extending from Genoa right down to Sicily. The lowland plain of the Po River Valley in the country's north-east forms the largest lowland 
area, and is heavily populated and industrialised. Underground activity is evidenced by the country's three active volcanoes - Stromboli in the Aeolian Islands, 
Vesuvius near Naples and Etna on Sicily - and the devastation wrought by earthquakes, especially fierce in 1908 and 1980. A couple of millennia of human 
occupation, coupled with the locals' love of hunting, has extinguished many species of animals once endemic to Italy. You might spot a brown bear or a lynx if 
you're lucky, and the Alpine regions are still home to wolves, marmots, chamois and deer. Mouflon sheep and wild boars and cats can be found on Sardinia, while 
in the skies falcons, hawks and golden eagles dodge the hunters' birdshot. Italy's climate varies from north to south and from lowland to mountain top. Winters are 
long and severe in the Alps, with snow falling as early as mid-September. The northern regions experience chilly winters and hot summers, while conditions become 
milder as you head south. The scirocco, however, affects regions south of Rome, the hot and humid African winds producing at least a couple of stiflingly hot 
weeks in summer. </p>
<p align=left>While Italy's status as a single political entity is relatively recent (1861), its strategic Mediterranean position made it a target for colonisers and opportunists. The 
Etruscans were the first people to rule the peninsula, arriving anywhere between the 12th and 8th centuries BC. They were eventually subsumed within the mighty 
Roman empire, leaving little cultural evidence, other than the odd tomb. The Ancient Greeks, their contemporaries, set up a few colonies along the southern coast, 
which became known as Magna Graecia and developed into independent city states. Thus the greater glory which was Rome was itself the offspring of Etruscan 
and Greek cultures.</p>
<h3 align=left><a name="art">An Art Gallery</a></h3>
<p align=left>Italy is the world's 'living art gallery': whether it's a broken pillar rising up through the linoleum floor of a train station or a baroque church overlooking a cracked 
antique pediment in the forum, history and culture surround you. Outside there are Etruscan tombs, Greek temples, Roman ruins, Moorish architecture and 
statue-filled baroque fountains to gawp at; inside you can swoon to Roman copies of Hellenic sculptures, Byzantine mosaics, beatific Madonnas from Giotto to 
Titian, gargantuan baroque tombs and trompe l'oeil ceilings. Writers abound from Virgil, Ovid, Horace, Livy and Cicero to Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Ficino and 
Mirandola to Vasari. As to music, Italians invented both the piano and our system of musical notation, as well as producing Monteverdi, Vivaldi, Scarlatti, Verdi, 
Puccini, Bellini and Rossini. Cinema would not be the same without Italy's Marcello Mastroianni, Anna Magnani, Gina Lollobrigida, Sophia Loren and directors 
Luchino Visconti, Roberto Rossellini, Frederico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni and Bernardo Bertolucci. Modern literary Italian appeared in the 13th and 14th 
centuries, developing out of its Latin heritage, the country's many dialects and the works of Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio, who wrote chiefly in the Florentine 
dialect. Though over 80% of the population profess to be Catholic, the number of people who actually practise the religion is surprisingly low: an average of only 
25% attend Mass regularly. However, saints' days, first communions and religious festivals never fail to attract large crowds. <a href="ita_art.html"><font size=4><em><strong>Italian Art Page</strong></em></font></a></p>
<h3 align=left><a name="cuisine">The Cuisine</a></h3>
<p align=left>Italy's many regional cucine have combined to form a unique cuisine which is justifiably world famous. These cooking styles vary notably, from the rich and creamy 
dishes of the north to the hot and spicy specialities of the south. Northern Emilia-Romagna has produced the best known dishes - spaghetti bolognese, lasagne and 
tortellini - and is also home to the best prosciutto and mortadella. Liguria is the home of pesto, that mainstay of caf&eacute;s worldwide and ubiquitous companion of 
sun-dried tomatoes and foccacia bread. Spectacular vegetable and pasta dishes feature just as predominantly as seafood and exotic meats (anyone for frog 
rissotto?, donkey steak?, entrail pudding?). Desserts come into their own in Sicily - cassata, cannoli, zabaglione, granita and marzipan - while Sardinia is famous for 
its spit-roasted piglet (with optional woolly muffler). Coffee, beer and wine are of course magnificent countrywide. </p>
<hr>
<h3 align=left><a name="history">A Little History</a></h3>
<p align=left>The first Roman Republic was founded in 509 BC, changed into an empire which grew so large it had to be divided into eastern and western sectors just to be 
administered. Even so, the bloodthirsty theatrics of regicide and intrigue were planting the seeds of its eventual destruction. Successive waves of Lombards, Franks, 
Saracens, Germans and Normans invaded the peninsula and claimed in various degrees the lost title of empire and emperor, culminating in Frankish Charlemagne's 
crowning as emperor in 800. Powerfully combative and competitive city states arose in the north, supporting either the pope (power within the peninsula vested in 
the papal states) or the emperor (usually a foreign power). The rise of cities and a merchant class led directly to cultural adulthood, culminating in the Renaissance 
of the 15th century. First Spain and then Austria controlled the peninsula during the ensuing centuries, followed briefly by Napoleon's imperial flourish. The 
post-Napoleon shake-up led directly to the drive for unification of the 19th century, led by Garibaldi, Cavour and Mazzini. The Kingdom of Italy was declared in 
1861. No label of unity, however, could hide the huge cultural and social differences which split the industrialised north from the poverty-stricken south. Economic 
crisis and fickle politics dogged the new nation in the ensuing decades, as Italy muddled through WW I and became riddled with industrial unrest in the early 1920s. 
In a memorably unwise employment decision, the king asked one Benito Mussolini to take the reins of government under the auspices of his Fascist Party. The 
postwar years have been coloured by extremism: the extreme violence of terrorists such as the Red Brigade, extreme centre-right politics, extreme economic boom 
and economic crisis, extreme corruption and bribery in extremely high places - and an extremely cynical and fatigued public- </p>

<h3 align=left><a name="rome">Rome</a></h3>
<p align=left>Roma: where legend, history and cultural monuments collide with everyday modern bustle of phenomenal proportions and enough innate style to make you wear 
out your dentures with gum-grinding envy. The metropolis is vast, but the historical centre is thankfully small, and just wandering from piazza to caf&eacute; and monument 
is a great way to get a taste of the Eternal City. The city is split by the River Tiber, with the Vatican on the left bank and the remnants of Imperial Rome on the right 
<em><strong>For More Information go to: </strong></em><a href="rome.html"><font size=4><em><strong>Rome Page</strong></em></font></a></p>
<h3 align=left><a name="flo">Florence</a></h3>
<p align=left>Where Rome is a historical hot-pot, Florence is like stepping back into a Fiat and Vespa-filled Renaissance: the shop-lined Ponte Vecchio, the trademark Duomo, 
the gem-filled Uffizi Gallery, the turreted Piazza della Signoria and the Medici Chapels. Thankfully, these unforgettables are all within walking distance of each other</p>
<p align=left><em><strong>For More Information go to: </strong></em><a href="ita_flo.html"><font size=4><em><strong>Florence Page</strong></em></font></a></p>
<h3 align=left><a name="ven">Venice</a></h3>
<p align=left>There's no escaping it: Venice is unique. For a start, this is a pedestrian's city on a very human scale - cars are almost nonexistent, and beguiling narrow paths take 
the place of ugly city roads. The harmonious architecture seems to have sprung uniformly from somewhere between the 12th and 16th centuries, its secretive walls 
and enticing balconies sparkling with flashes of water glimpsed through cracks and windows. Dark paths suddenly emerge into the clear, bright daylight of a 
church-filled square or to cross the city's myriad canals by way of numerous and wonderful little bridges. The atmosphere is magical, and inexplicably festive. The 
city is built on 117 small islands, and is linked to the mainland service town of Mestre by a road and rail causeway. The Grand Canal insinuates itself around the 
city, emerging at the unforgettable vista of Piazza San Marco, boasting its campanile, Doges' Palace, St Mark's Basilica and elegant pigeon-filled piazza. The Bridge 
of Sighs links the palace to the gloomy old prisons, and the bobbing gondolas are overlooked by the stunning Santa Maria della Salute, San Giorgio Maggiore and 
del Redentore churches. It takes only half an hour or so to walk from the train station to San Marco: that is if you can resist the temptation to take one of the many 
paths which diverge from the main drag (Lista di Spagna) and assuming that you can follow the signs which appear every now and then indicating nonsensical 
directions. To appreciate the fine palaces which line the Grand Canal, swallow your 'but I'm not really a tourist' phlegm and take a gondola. The Accademia Bridge 
leads to a quieter Venice and the Galleria dell'Accademia, with its collection of Venetian masters. The nearby Peggy Guggenheim Gallery updates your walk 
through history and art, with its fine collection of early 20th-century works. Venice is surrounded by equally enchanting islands: the Lido (forever linked with 
Tommy Mann, Dirk and Death in Venice), Murano (the home of Venetian glass), Burano (famous for its lace) and strangely time-warped Torcello, with its 
Byzantine cathedral. </p>

<h3 align=left><a name="milan">Milan</a></h3>
<p align=left>Visitors come to Milan for its fashion, cuisine, opera, church (the world's fourth-largest), Renaissance castle and da Vinci's Last Supper fresco. But this is very 
much a working city, the country's business and finance capital. Shopping is huge in Milan, the eating is legendary and nightclubbing is the best (thanks to the 
presence of the country's largest gay community). The huge city sprawls for miles, but the main historical attractions can be found between the two most important: 
the huge duomo - commissioned in 1386 and still unfinished - and the spiky Sforza castle. The Piazza del Duomo is bordered by the world's most beautiful 
shopping mall: the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II. Resist the caf&eacute;s and boutiques and you emerge opposite opera's sacred shrine: La Scala. Its museum is pretty 
good too. Milan has plenty of art galleries and collections, but the most popular venue is the Vinciano Refectory: home to the Last Supper.</p>
<h3 align=left><a name="siena">Siena</a></h3>
<p align=left>Ramparts still crown the hills which surround gentle Siena - just one of the many vestiges of the city's medieval prime. Its many reddish-brown buildings gave the 
world 'burnt sienna', and a thriving cultural scene was dubbed the Sienese school in the 13th and 14th centuries. Plague and autocrats from the Viscontis to the 
Medicis brought urban growth and cultural finesse to a screaming halt, the rot setting in with the plague of 1348, which killed 65,000 of the city's 100,000 people. 
Fortunately, Italy's finest medieval square - the Piazza del Campo - was finished just in time, with the graceful town hall and emblemic tower nearby. Siena's duomo 
is a stunner, with black and white stripes of marble on the facade. Palazzos, piazzas, art collections, museums and churches are scattered throughout the easily 
walkable old town, making Siena a great destination for visitors who like to see things from the pavement up.</p>
<h3 align=left>Assisi</h3>
<p align=left>Walled Assisi is miraculous: it has somehow managed to retain some tranquil refuges amid the tourist hubbub. Perched halfway up Mt Subasio, the visual impact of 
its shimmering white marble buildings is magnificent. The city is dominated by the massive 14th-century Rocca Maggiore - a hill fortress which offers fabulous views 
over the valley and back to Perugia. St Francis was born here in 1182, and work began on his basilica two years after his death in 1228. It's a magnificent tribute 
to the patron saint of animals, with frescoes by Giotto, Cimabue and Martini. Relics from Imperial days include the excavated forum and the pillared facade of the 
Temple of Minerva; Roman foundations are a common feature of many buildings. The town's many churches include Santa Maria Maggiore, San Pietro, St Clare 
and the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli. </p>
<h3 align=left>San Gimignano</h3>
<p align=left>Only 14 of the original 72 towers remain, but this wonderfully preserved medieval city in Tuscany is still known as San Gimignano of the Fine Towers. The towers 
reflect a period in Italian history when neighbours were particularly quarrelsome and a person's house really was their castle, with points scored for the highest 
tower. Crenellated palazzos and soaring towers circle the town's major piazzas, with Torre Grossa the tallest tower at 54 metres. A<br>
Romanesque cathedral, ruined fortress, frescoed church and a fabulous museum featuring art of the Sienese and Florentine schools round off this special city's 
charms. </p>
<h3 align=left>Cinque Terre</h3>
<p align=left>If you blink, you'll miss the five magnificent villages of the Cinque Terre, but you'll never forgive yourself if you do. The villages are wedged into the impossibly 
mountainous countryside which borders coastal Liguria in the north-west of the country, and as yet the ravages of uncontrolled tourism have been kept in check. 
The towns are connected by a scenic pathway which winds along the terraced hillside, through olive groves and vineyards. The towns are car-free too. 
Riomaggiore overlooks a tiny cove, and fishing boats rule the roost: lying along the shore and even in the small square. Lovers' Lane links the village with Manarola, 
the most picturesque of the five villages. Corniglia is not for the faint-hearted, as it sits high above the water and is reached by tortuous steps. Vernazza makes the 
most of its sea views, with a promenade and a piazza overlooking the water. Finally, Monterosso overlooks the only real beach in the vicinity, and features huge 
statues carved into the rocks which overlook it.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align=left><a name="naokes">Naples &amp; Pompeii</a></h3>
<p align=left>Napoli, capital of the Campania, is set on the beautiful Bay of Naples and overshadowed by Mt Vesuvius. It's one of Europe's most densely populated cities, and 
throbs with the hubbub of workers and city dwellers, its narrow streets crowded with people dodging overhanging washing and speeding Vespas. Naples' historic 
centre features the church-filled Piazza del Ges&ugrave; Nuovo, the duomo, the Palazzo Reale and San Carlo Opera House. The 13th-century Castel Nuovo overlooks 
the ferry port, and further along the waterfront there's a Norman castle, surrounded by a tiny fishing village, the Borgo Marinaro. The National Archaeological 
Museum contains a fine collection of Greco-Roman art, and the priceless treasures discovered at Pompeii and Herculaneum. </p>
<p align=left>Easily accessible from Naples is enigmatic Pompeii, the thriving resort town for wealthy Romans which was buried under ash and mud during the devastating 
eruption of Mt Vesuvius in 79 AD. The vast ruins provide a fascinating insight into how the ancient Romans lived, and include impressive temples, a forum, one of 
the largest known Roman amphitheatres, luxurious houses with frescoes and mosaics, and streets lined with shops. </p>
<h3 align=left><a name="amalfi">Amalfi Coast</a></h3>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=20%><img src="images/map-it_a.gif" align=bottom width=277 height=199></td><td width=50%>Stretching for 50 km along a promontory from Sorrento to Salerno is some of Europe's most beautiful coastline. The 
road hugs the zigzagging bends and curves of the cliffy coast, overlooking intensely blue waters and passing 
picture-postcard villages which cling to the cliff walls like matchbox houses. Positano is the first port of call out of 
Sorrento, and it's truly sublime: tiered arcades of rose and honey-coloured houses hover precariously over an 
iridescent sea, and further investigation reveals caf&eacute;s and hotels to die for. Further around several intervening bends is 
Amalfi, its former status as a supreme naval power which rivalled Pisa and Genoa evidenced in its arsenal and 
imposing duomo. Hairpin bends separate Amalfi from Ravello, which sits like a balcony overlooking the bay. Its 
duomo has an interesting pulpit with six lions carved at its base, and several villas and their beautiful gardens add to 
its attractions. Salerno has seen it all, from Etruscan to Roman and medieval times. Unfortunately, the city was 
extensively damaged during WW II, as it was one of the Allies' major landing sites. </td></tr>
</table>
<h3 align=left>Paestum</h3>
<p align=left>Just south of Salerno, Paestum is home to the country's best preserved relics of the Magna Graecia colonies. It is an enigmatic site, with three Doric temples 
dominating a flower-strewn, grassy plain. It includes the temples of Ceres and Neptune, a forum, basilica and city walls. The museum houses a collection of friezes, 
rounding off one of the best collections of ancient architecture in the world. In keeping with the attic atmosphere, 12 km inland is one of the few protected natural 
environments in Italy's south, known as the Woods of Diana</p>
<hr>
<h2 align=left><a name="sicily">Sicily</a></h2>
<p align=left>The island of Sicily is a place of contrasts: from the crumbling grandeur of its capital, Palermo, to the Greek ruins at Syracuse, volatile Mt Etna and the Aeolian 
Islands, home to touristy Lipari, jet-set Panarea, rugged Vulcano and spectacularly spouting Stromboli. Squatting strategically in the Mediterranean, and its largest 
island, Sicily has attracted waves of invaders and colonisers, whose detritus include Greek temples, Roman ruins, Norman churches and castles, and Arab and 
Byzantine domes. Sicilians remain strongly tied to the land, despite summer heat which can be utterly scorching - luckily, the beaches are superb. Other sights 
includes the magnificent 12th-century cathedral at Monreale and the touristy but unmissable Taormina, with its Greek theatre, panoramic public gardens, palazzo, 
cathedral and beaches. </p>
<hr>
<h2 align=left><a name="sard">Sardinia</a></h2>
<p align=left>The island of Sardinia has been colonised and invaded by the Greeks, Phoenicians, Romans, Pisans, Genoese and Spaniards. Through these ravages, the locals 
(known as the Sardi) have retained their identity and singularity, remaining strangely insular people. The landscape is rugged, and the remaining wildlife distinctive - 
from albino donkeys to griffon vultures.Cagliari, the capital, is surprisingly attractive, with an interesting medieval section and a beautiful beach. Other attractions 
include the magnificent and relatively unspoiled Costa Verde coastline, the beaches and grottoes around the tourist enclave of Alghero and the trekking and 
traditional culture offered in Nuoro Province. </p>

<h3 align=left><a name="paris">PARIS</a></h3>
<p align=left>As an art capital, Paris has had a fruitful history. Prominent in Merovingian times, it became one of the great Cathedral cities of France in the later Middle Ages, 
with Notre Dame at the heart of a cluster of excellent Gothic churches. The artistic development was not sustained in the Renaissance as the Kings shifted the focus 
of power to the Loire Valley, Fontainbleau and, eventually, to Versailles. Nevertheless the 17th century saw Paris emerging into something of international 
reputation with the arrival of artists such as Rubens and Bernini, and from then on to the 1930s the capital gradually assumed a position as the most influential art 
center of Europe. Puccini's Opera La Boheme merely indicates the extent to which the city has become identified with modern art in the popular imagination, with a 
period of residence in the Latin Quarter seen as a necessary stage in the process of becoming a &quot;true&quot; artist. The 19th century left the greatest mark on the city's 
appearance with the Sacre Coeur, Opera, Madeleine, the Grand Palais and the Eiffel Tower.</p>
<p align=left>So many places to discover while walking. Try the Marais Quarter and the old site of the Halles where the well known Pompidou Center is now in attendance. 
Enter the fabled Louvre museum for an overview of priceless masterpieces, only an overview since an in-depth visit will have you here for weeks. Above all seat at 
one of the typical cafes dotting the beautiful avenues, watch the world go by as trained Parisians do. Paris has a name for good food but very steep prices. While 
this is true of too many restaurants, it is also not difficult to dine out well and inexpensively , with a few classic old bistros and some small new places which have 
taken up the &quot;prix-fixe menu&quot; that offers plenty of choice. Most are unpretentious and serve traditional French cooking in astonishingly large proportions. All of 
them have moderately priced house wines as well as a reasonable wine list, and are popular with Parisians who live and work nearby, making reservations quite 
important. </p>
<hr>
<h3 align=left><a name="pro">PROVENCE AND C&Ocirc;TE D&#146;AZUR</a></h3>
<p align=left>This is probably the most visited region in France outside of Paris. This &quot;province&quot;, as the Romans called it, is the area known as Provence today and was ruled 
from the 12th C by counts based at the aristocratic and elegant city of Aix-en-Provence. The counts built many of the fine castles in the region, and also 
commissioned many important works of art, but probably the greatest contribution to the region&#146;s artistic heritage came with the papacy, which resided in Avignon 
in the 14th C, and brought some of the greatest Italian artists, writers and musicians. In 1482 Provence was annexed to France and gradually came to offer fewer 
opportunities for its artists, many of whom, like Fragonard and Granet, moved to Paris or Rome. The beauty of the Provencal landscape has only recently become 
widely appreciated. One of the most important 19th C artists to paint in the region was van Gogh, who moved to Arles from Paris in 1886, hoping to establish what 
he called a &quot;school of the Midi&quot; similar to the artist&#146;s colonies in Brittany. Nothing came of this but many artists started establishing themselves in town and village 
along the Cote d&#146;Azur, an area which developed concurrently as a major tourist center. Signac and Fauves went to St. Tropez, Renoir to Cagnes, Matisse to Nice, 
Picasso to Antibes, Chagall to Vence, Leger to Biot and so on. </p>
<h3 align=left>NICE</h3>
<p align=left>Settlements in this area may well go back to around 40,000 years ago but it is only 6 C BC that we find tribes of Celto-Ligurians established here at the level of the 
castle hill. A little later merchants from Marseilles came to olive, of course followed directly by the Romans, who favored the Cimiez district. In 1388, aided by the 
Grimaldi family, the House of Savoy incorporated Provence in its domain and retained it till 1860 when, after the agreements between France and the House of 
Savoy and following a plebiscite, Nice was returned to France. The core of the city, huddling the foot of the castle hill, is a lively and utterly Mediterranean town 
with its own character. The landscaped slopes of the castle with their umbrella pines make a wonderful refuge for a glorious view of the city and the &quot;Bay of the 
Angels&quot; where all great hotels are located. To the north is Cimiez where the Roman settlement was located, all around the beautiful hills of the lower Provence and 
Cote d&#146;Azur.</p>

simply to vacation, not just to test their standing with lady luck, nor merely to see and be seen, but to revel in the

boat trips down the rapids and arduous train rides, 
primitive hilltribes in their colorful costumes with a 
tradition and culture of their own </h4>

<h2 align=left><a name="qui">Quito</a></h2>
<p align=left>Quito, considered one of the most beautiful cities in the Western Hemisphere, has an astonishing location -more than a mile above sea level, nestled in the Andes 
Mountains beneath the sparkling snow-cone of the Pichincha mountain, and almost directly on the equator! When the Spaniards departed, they left behind a vast 
collection of colonial art and superb churches whose interiors shine with the glitter of gold. This rich treasury of religious architecture and decorative arts was 
recognized several years ago when UNESCO proclaimed Quito a &quot;Cultural Patrimony of Mankind&quot;. Among the most impressive of the capital's architectural 
treasures is La Compania Church, whose richly carved facade is the most ornate in the city and whose interior is a date of golden altars, gilded columns and 
balconies. Hues of gold also shine on the altars and ceilings of San Francisco Cathedral, one of the first great religious buildings in the continent. Sculpture and 
paintings produced by the &quot;Escuela Quitefia&quot;- the school of native artists trained by the church friars decorate the walls with traditional religious subjects mingling 
with pagan symbols. The of San Agustin, Santo Domingo Church, the Basilica of La Merced, and the newly restored Convent of San Diego are other outstanding 
examples of the magnificence of Quito's spiritual fortress.</p>
<p align=left>The city's rich legacy is also on view at the National Museum of Colonial Art, the Casa de la Cultura Ecuatoriana (with its fascinating assemblage of musical 
instruments and modern art) and the Jacinto Jijon y Caamano collection of colonial art (which is housed at the Catholic University). Colonial pieces are the most 
modern of the artifacts in the Banco Central's Archaeological Museum, which houses a magnificent collection of native ceramics dating back to 10,000 B.C. 
Specially trained, multilingual guides take visitors through the grand displays of every day and ceremonial objects of gold, stone, cloth and wood.<br>
Quito is a city for walkers who wish to savor the city&#146;s charm and calm. Because of the altitude, and the roller-coaster topography of the capital, take a taxi from 
section to section-to the narrow cobblestone streets of the old city, for example. They are full of history; doted with spacious plazas, bustling with hawkers selling 
fruit, ice cream and chocolate; brighten by flower vendors. Strolling down, rather than up, the most vertical incline of the oldest street, La Ronda, one catches the 
feeling of 16th-century Quito, a city of red-tile roofs, whitewashed walls, and heavy wooden doors with inset grilles offering a peephole to flowering and fountain 
courtyards. Shopping is a major pastime for visitors and Quito is one of the finest shopping capitals in South America selling crafts from all over the country selling 
crafts from all over the country. Ecuador's centuries of artistic excellence are carried over into such handmade, shopping bargains as traditional embroidery designs 
applies to fashionable men&#146;s and women&#146;s clothing and pre-Colombian motifs and material worked into tapestries or gold and silver jewelry.	</p>
<p align=left>Restaurants are often housed in former old family mansions. A good, refreshing local drink should precede a tasty lunch or dinner featuring Ecuadorian specialties 
or international cuisine. After dinner entertainment in Quito includes a choice of lively discotheques, casino gambling, or drinks along with native music of the 
Andean highlands, served up at informal clubs called &quot;penas&quot;. When staying in Quito, the 15 mile drive north to the equator is a must on every itinerary. The 
monument at the middle of the world, located right on latitude 0 degrees, provides the irresistible opportunity to straddle both hemispheres. From the top, the 
monument also offers a grand view of the Andean landscape.</p>
<h2 align=left><a name="cue">Cuenca</a></h2>
<p align=left>Ecuadorians call it their most beautiful city, and indeed visitors to Cuenca will find a lovely center of elegance and colonial charm. Cuenca's cobblestone streets, 
graceful ironwork balconies, flowered plazas and courtyards, and religious art treasures recall her long association with Spain; yet the people, the markets, and the 
Andean setting leave no doubt that you are in Ecuador. A short flight from Quito or Guayaquil, Cuenca is tucked away in a southern valley on the site of a once 
important settlement along the Inca highway that joined Cuzco to Quito during the last pre-Colombian empire. Today, Cuenca is the third largest city in Ecuador 
with a skyline marked, not by high-rise buildings, but by shining church domes. Her cobblestone streets wind around flowered plazas and are lined with red-roofed 
adobe houses. Delightful and ornate wooden houses hug the bluff above the Tomebamba River which skirts the base of the city. The cathedrals dominate Parque 
Calderon in the heart of town. The new one is a large building with a facade of pink marble, whose construction started in 1880 yet remains unfinished. Due to an 
architectural miscalculation the towers were too heavy for the edifice to sustain, and the bells remain on the ground outside the church. Also, near the main plaza 
and right at the flower market, is the Convento de El Carmen. The Convent is preserved almost as it was at the end of the 1600S. Though the nuns quarters are 
closed to the public, the Central Bank of Ecuador has restored the adjacent Monastery of the Conception. It is filled with a remarkable treasury of religious art 
pieces, contributed by the families whose daughters became cloistered Carmelite nuns, as well as displays of objects used in everyday life. Among other things to 
see in Cuenca are the Municipal Museum whose displays range from the Canari and Chordeleg cultures the first to appear in the region and the CIDAP 
Inter-American Museum, devoted to handicrafts of the continent, which are at their best in this region.<br>
There are many good places to buy local wares which include embroidered blouses, natural sheep wool sweaters, gold and silver filigree jewelry and weavings with 
tie-dyed patterns called ikat. Crafts, as well as fresh produce, are also on sale at the weekly Thursday market which is held around 9 de Octubre and 10 de 
Agosto squares. In Cuenca and the surrounding area, hats are a leading cottage industry and several factories are open to visitors. The most famous one, of course, 
is the so-called Panama hat, first made in Montecristi, Ecuador, during the construction of the Panama Canal and sent north to the workers. Nowadays, Cuenca s 
the leading production center for straw hats. Visitors have even more fun taking excursions to the nearby villages that produce handmade crafts. </p>
<p align=left>It is a full and fascinating day's trip from Cuenca to the massive fortifications of Ingapirca rising above the dramatically beautiful valleys. This is the only remaining 
major monument of the Inca empire which ruled here for several hundred year before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century. It is believed today that Ingapirca was 
both a religious and administrative center. as well as a fortress. The complex was built by the Incas on top of an old Caiiari settlement. The vast archaeological 
complex of ruins includes a roofless fortification, courtyards, terraces, temples, houses, and a &quot;castle&quot; or possibly a &quot;Temple of the Sun&quot;A museum is now open at 
the site containing both archaeological and ethnographic displays as well as a scale of the ruins. Additionally, there are exhibits of ceramics and jewelry of earlier 
cultures, and scraps of textiles found in a burial ground believed to have been from the period, 500 years before the Incas. En route to Ingapirrca are the towns of 
Azogues, with its lovely church and Saturday straw market, and Biblian. whose heights are crowned with a most astonishing cathedral cut into the rock. </p>
<h2 align=left><a name="in_mkt">Indian Markets</a></h2>
<p align=left>While Ecuador straddles the equator at the middle of the world, Quito sits at the hub of the country&#146;s road system. South, and north, from the capital is the Pan 
American Highway-the &quot;main street&quot; of South America- leading to some of the most fascinating and scenic excursions on the continent. For most visitors, Ecuador's 
outstanding appeal lies in the colorful spectacle of the native, country markets which are the major social and commercial events in Andean valley towns. There is a 
nearby market for almost every day of the week, and the spectacular scenery en route makes getting there half the fun. Most markets lie south of Quito along the 
route called the Avenue of the Volcanoes: 11 snowy peaks framing the Latacunga-Ambato valley. Ambato itself sits in full view of the towering Tungurahua 
volcano, and on Monday, market day, plaza after plaza is filled with the bright colors of fruits, vegetables and flowers; shiny stacks of tin pans and hardware; 
blankets, ponchos and fine straw hats called Panama hats (which are really made in Ecuador). Under makeshift roofs, pots steam and barbecue spits turn over 
charcoal blazers to feed some 20,000 native buyers and sellers. This is the place to look for the tapestries of the Salasacas, a native group who originally came 
from Bolivia during Inca times. The Salasacas recognized by their black ponchos and white, wide-brimmed hats have their weaving center about ten miles from 
Ambato; but their tapices, strips of cloth with imaginative bird and animal shapes, are for sale in their main village. Along the Pan American Highway there are other 
good produce markets such as Saquisili. There, on Thursdays, the focus is on selling what the local people need, not what the visitors want. Then there's Pujili on 
Wednesdays and Sundays, a gathering place where the people swap sheep, blankets, pigs and vegetables, and exchange village gossip. There is rarely a day when 
you won't find a spectacle somewhere nearby at these interesting weekly fairs on, or just off, the Pan American Highway.</p>
<p align=left>Close to Quito is Calderron, whose singular craft is bread-dough figures. Usually from one to six inches high, forms are shaped into birds, animals, flowers, and 
people, colored with dyes, and varnished for protection. Unique to Ecuador, these &quot;bread dolls&quot; are imaginative and inexpensive. Traditionally, the dolls are placed 
on the graves to honor the dead during All Souls Day celebrations at beginning of November. Today they are extremely popular as Christmas ornaments. Ecuador 
is well known for its native markets, and its best known is just a few hours from Quito, at Otavalo whose master weavers were at their loom long before the 
Spaniards - or even the Incas - arrived. Ponchos, sweaters, belts and blankets are the staples of the natives in this region and also the favorite purchases for 
visitors. The market here, in full swing by, 7 a.m., is ablaze with colorful products. including tapestries and rugs from other weaving centers. No less colorful are the 
people themselves. Close to Otavalo, there are other fine craft centers to visit such as San Antonio de Ibarra, famous for its wood carvings, and Cotacachi, which 
has shop after shop of beautiful leather accessories and clothing. Nearby is the charming city of Ibarra, known as the &quot;White City&quot; for its order and beauty. And 
remember, you are in Imbabura, the Province of the Lakes, which has such serene and peaceful ones as Lake San Pablo, Culcocha and Yahuarcocha (the last one 
encircled by an auto race track-Grand Prix style).</p>

<h2 align=left><a name="train">Train Adventure</a></h2>
<p align=left>Following this same routing which leads through the central highlands, and eventually down to the Pacific Coast, is a picturesque rail line with regular service. There 
is a special tourist train that operates twice weekly between Quito and Riobamba with a refitted car featuring pullman seats, wide windows, a rear view platform 
and food service. Riobamba sits right beneath snow-clad Chimborazo, the second highest and largest mountain in the Andes. Other towering white peaks seen 
along the route are the Antisana, Cotopaxi, the Ilinizas, Altar and Tungurahua. Getting to Riobamba is part of the fun, because the drive, or ride, from Quito is 
marvelously scenic. By rail, the route skirts steep inclines, cuts through narrow tunnels, and crosses the Andes at 11,841 feet before dropping down to Riobamba. 
The rail trip between Riobamba and Guayaquil is one of the most spectacular train rides in the world that takes you through some of the most glorious scenery, up 
and down the Andes, via the famous Devil's Nose. Repairs are presently in progress and this line should be reopened in the near future. One should plan to be in 
Riobamba for the big Saturday market. Commercial activity spreads over nine plazas, filled with seas of red, blue and purple ponchos and regional hats. One area 
is reserved for woven goods such as belts and blankets. Other market specialties are carvings of tagua (a nut that hardens to look like ivory) and ikat shawls of 
hand-woven and tie-dyed fabrics with interesting string fringes.</p>
<h2 align=left><a name="ama">THE AMAZON JUNGLE</a></h2>
<p align=left>Visits to the Indian villages, overnights in jungle lodges, walks through the primeval rain forest in search of brilliant toucans and parrots, traveling by dugout canoe 
down hidden tributaries, and cruising the a 50-passenger floating hotel-are all part of the adventure which is Amazonia. Travel to this part of the Amazon Basin has 
not always been easy. It is an area that is about the same size as the United States west of the Mississippi, that touches on six South American countries, is the 
largest and densest rain forest on earth, and is home to almost half of the world's 8,500 different species of birds and at least 1,200 different kinds of butterflies. 
The Oriente extends from the eastern Andes mountain range to the border with Peru. In addition to the characteristically lush tropical jungle flora which visitors 
have come to enjoy, the region supports lumber, agriculture, gold mining, and oil industries. Some of the area is accessible from Quito by road and air service, other 
parts can best be reached by dugout canoe. Travelers visiting this region usually fly to the northern zone and the airport at Coca on the Napo. Alternatively, one 
flies to Lago Agrio, traveling overland to Coca through an astonishingly diverse route that passes alongside the oil pipeline through the jungle. When traveling down 
the river from Coca, you will see the world of Amazonia on foot and by canoe, best if accompanied by a naturalist-guide. One trip includes the Limoncocha 
Lagoon (with an overnight at the lodge) where more than 400 species of birds have been sighted, and where visitors go alligator &quot;hunting&quot; (with flashlights) at night; 
Pompeya Island with its museum, church and village, and the Taracoa jungle area of giant kapok trees and other rain forest life. Longer trips include overnight in 
Panacocha, by Piranha Lake, where there is a jungle cam used as a base for fishing, birdwatching, canoeing and swimming. There is another interesting jungle 
routing in central Oriente which combines overland travel from Quito-along the Pan American Highway to Ambato-then cutting east on a secondary road to 
Baifios, a highland retreat at the foot of Mt. Tungurahua, and gateway to the Upper Amazon region. The route then follows the Pastaza River to Puyo, Tena, and 
the frontier Napo River port of Misahualli. By dugout canoe travelers go for an overnight or two, on Anaconda Island, with jungle hikes and canoe rides, as well as

<h2><a name="gala">GALAPAGOS ISLANDS</a></h2>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=50%><img src="images/map_gala.gif" align=bottom width=391 height=314></td><td width=50%>When travelers return from visiting the Galapagos Islands, their eyes sparkle with 
wonder as they tell marvelous tales. You may think their stories are pure 
fabrication: birds that no longer fly, tortoises weighing up to 500 pounds, 
Antarctic penguins living right on the equator, and blue-footed boobies doing 
sophisticated mating dances, but you would be wrong. The Galapagos are just as 
amazing as everyone says. The reason is their remoteness. The islands, officially 
called the Archipelago de Colon, straddle the equator 600 miles off Ecuador's 
Pacific coast. There are 13 major islands, dozens of small lava islets, and reefs 
dotting about some 3,000 square miles of the Pacific. Seeds and insects 
eventually were blown here or carried on driftwood. Birds and animals arrived by 
air and by water. Because no humans landed before the 16th century, flora and 
fauna flourished untroubled, yet changed, as the new environment demanded. The 
islands were discovered in 1535 and during the next 300 years they were visited 
periodically by Spanish mariners, British buccaneers, renegades and pirates in 
search of shelter. Today, the human population of approximately 9,000 is 
confined to four major islands and is engaged in farming, fishing, raising cattle, and 
tourism. The Darwin Research Station, housed on the Santa Cruz Island, trains 
naturalist guides from all over the world and is charged with the task of advancing 
conservation on the islands. It is a convenient place to see the famous tortoises for 
which the islands are named-from the Spanish word galapago.</td></tr>
</table>
<p align=left>Your Galapagos cruise experience will vary slightly, depending on the boat. On both the small motor yachts and the larger 90-passenger cruise vessels, passengers 
eat and sleep aboard, usually make two different shore visits each day; and have a chance to swim and snorkel. Naturalist guides travel on all vessels, and brief 
passengers each evening about the island sights they will encounter the next day. Most boats do not land on the islands, and passengers are ferried ashore in 
&quot;pangas&quot;, which are dingy-like boats. Naturalist-guides must accompany each group, which cannot exceed 20 persons. The guides stay on designated paths and 
conduct a running commentary on the habits and habitats of the wildlife. On the larger ships, sailing&#146;s are offered for three to seven nights. Life aboard is informal. 
Boats, classified as yachts, carry from 4 passengers with a crew of 2, to 34 passengers with a crew of 17. Cruising itineraries normally are planned to last one or 
two weeks.Most cruises begin in the islands. The passengers fly from Quito or Guayaquil to either Santa Cruz or San Cristobal Island. There are small hotels on 
both of them for those who wish to spend time on land and take day cruises to nearby islands only. The wildlife of Galapagos consists mostly of birds and reptiles 
whose ancestors were capable of crossing the large ocean spaces. There are 56 resident bird species on the island, 27 of which are found only in Galapagos, and 
some are endemic to just one island. Among the mammals in Galapagos, one finds sea lions and fur seals. Whales and dolphins are frequently spotted while 
cruising. From highlands to shorelines, almost 900 species of plants have been recorded, and of those, 200 grow only in Galapagos. As much as there is to be seen 
in the islands, the main sights you will be visiting are:</p>
<p align=left>The following facts are an abbreviated outline of a few of the many striking features of the Galapagos islands. It&#146;s one of the most important tourism destinations in 
the world and from the standpoint of a natural history attraction, few have the appeal or the available infrastructure.</p>

<hr>
<p>Chile's offers a unique combination of Pacific coastline and Andean highlands, plus distinctive culture has survived the violence and repression of its recent history 
and is thriving once again thanks to a people noted for their warmth and resilience. Despite having the most European community in South America, indigenous 
traditions persist in the Andean foothills and in the southern plains, while some of South America's finest national parks draw trekkers and guanaco spotters alike. It 
extends some 4300 km from the desert north to the glacial south, bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west and sheltered by the Andes on the east. Chile shares 
most of its extensive eastern border with Argentina, and borders Peru and Bolivia in the north. Rarely extending beyond 200 km in width, Chile rises rapidly from 
sea level to 6000 metres and shows a formidable array of landscapes. Snow-capped volcanoes plunge to river canyons; the Great North, where some weather 
stations have never recorded rainfall, is counterpoint to storm and snow prone Patagonia; and Chile's razored and sculpted coastline has endowed it with beaches 
and bays perfect for fishing and swimming. Chile also lays claim to the offshore territories of Easter Island (3700 km west), Juan Fern&aacute;ndez (700 km west) and half 
of the southern island of Tierra del Fuego (which it shares with Argentina). The variety of habitat supports distinctive flora and fauna, which are protected by an 
extensive system of national parks (vicu&ntilde;a (a wild relative of the alpaca), the Patagonian guanaco (a wild relative of the Andean llama), flamingos, pelicans, 
penguins, otters and sea lions). Climate is as varied as the terrain, with arid but surprisingly temperate areas in the north, a heartland which enjoys a Mediterranean 
climate, and the wind, rain and snow-battered lands of Chilean Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego in the south. The rainy season in the heartland is from May to 
August when temperatures are cooler.</p>
<p>Chile's European heritage is pervasive, the Paris education of many Chilean intellectuals influenced the country's art, music and architecture. Important art galleries 
and museums and a thriving theatre scene are the result. The country's art, literature and music have been influential internationally. The country's Catholic 
architecture is impressive and ubiquitous, from grandiose colonial churches to roadside shrines, some of which are extraordinary manifestations of folk art. Spanish 
is Chile's official language, though a handful of native languages are still spoken. In the north, there are more than 20,000 speakers of Aymara, and in the south 
there are perhaps half a million speakers of Mapuche. The most intriguing linguistic minority is the 2000-plus speakers of Rapa Nui, the Polynesian language of 
most of Easter Island's population</p>
<p>Chile's cuisine reflects the country's topographical variety, and features seafood, beef, fresh fruit and vegetables. Empanadas are large turnover snacks with a 
variety of fillings; humitas are corn tamales; and there are a variety of potato and flour-based breads. Chile's biggest standard meal is lomo a lo pobre - an 
enormous slab of beef topped with two fried eggs and buried in chips. The parillada, which will appal vegetarians and heart specialists, is a mixed grill including such 
delicacies as intestines, udders and blood sausage. Curanto, one of the nation's finest dishes, is an all-encompassing, hearty stew of fish, shellfish, chicken, pork, 
lamb, beef and potato. Chilean wines are arguably South America's best. A pisco sour is a popular drink which easily gets you piscoed - it's a grape brandy served 
with lemon juice, egg white and powdered sugar.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="high">CHILE HIGHLIGHTS</a></h3>
<h3>Santiago</h3>
<p>Santiago is immense, its central core, however, is manageable and relatively small - a roughly triangular area bounded by the Rio Mapocho on the north. It is a city 
of grand thoroughfares and plazas, lined with public buildings and churches and circled by parks. The grid town plan imposed by the Spanish, however, is 
conducive to traffic jams and pollution. The Virgin Mary guards the city from the peak of the 860-metre Cerro San Crist&oacute;bal, part of the Parque Metropolitano 
recreational area. The city's attractions include the colourful Mercado Central, the historical centre of Plaza de Armas, the pedestrian mall of Paseo Ahumada 
(haunt of buskers and pedlars) and the late-colonial and block-filling Palacio de La Moneda - former mint, presidential residence and the site of Allende's last 
stand. Santiago's has plenty of museums, including the beautifully arranged Pre-Colombian Museum and the Museo de Santiago, which documents the city's 
present sprawl with dioramas and reconstructions. The Palacio de Bellas Artes is modelled on the Petit Palais in Paris and has a fine collection of European and 
Chilean art</p>
<h3>Valpara&iacute;so</h3>
<p>Lying 120 km north-west of Santiago, Valparaiso is Chile's principal port and second-largest city. Despite its size, it is Chile's most distinctive city and one of South 
America's most intriguing. Occupying a narrow strip of land between the waterfront and the nearby hills, its convoluted centre has distinctive, sinuous cobbled 
streets, and is overlooked by precipitous cliffs and hilltop suburbs which are accessed by funicular railways and stairway footpaths. It truly is a rabbit-warren of a 
place, which probably only a lifetime resident could completely fathom. It is conducive to maze-like strolls and rides on the funicular, and its natural-history, 
fine-arts and maritime museums are justly famed. Muelle Prat, the recently redeveloped pier, is a lively market area. </p>
<h3>Vi&ntilde;a del Mar</h3>
<p>Chile's premier beach resort is only 10 km north of Valpara&iacute;so, and is popularly known as the Garden City because of its manicured subtropical landscape of palm 
and banana trees. Horse-drawn carriages trot past attractive turn-of-the-century mansions on both river and beach frontages. Other attractions are the white-sand 
beaches, numerous parks and notable museums housed in restored mansions. The town is also the home of Chile's national botanical garden, comprising 61 
hectares of native and exotic plants</p>
<h3>La Serena</h3>
<p>Important both historically and economically, the beachside city of La Serena is one of Chile's oldest post-Columbian cities. The region's silver, copper and 
agriculture were so important that the city had its own mint. Today, La Serena maintains a colonial air, although it is threatening Vi&ntilde;a del Mar's supremacy as 
premier beach resort. Apart from a string of beautiful beaches, attractions include a handful of museums and a number of nearby quaint villages and<br>
vineyards</p>
<h3>Puerto Montt</h3>
<p>Settled by German colonists in the mid-19th century, this is one of southern Chile's most important cities. It features middle-European architecture, with shingles, 
high-pitched roofs and ornate balconies. The redwood cathedral on the city's plaza is the city's oldest building, dating from 1856. The city is the transport hub and 
access point to the southern Lake District, the island of Chilo&eacute; and Chilean Patagonia. </p>
<h3>Parque Nacional Torres del Paine </h3>
<p>Near Chile's fragmented southern tip, this park is Chile's showpiece: a world biosphere reserve with all the diverse scenery of Alaska in only 180,000 hectares. The 
Torres del Paine are spectacular granite pillars which soar almost vertically for more than 2000 metres above the Patagonian steppe. Cascading waterfalls, 
sprawling glaciers, dense forests, and the chance to see Patagonian guanaco make it a truly awesome experience</p>
<h3>Parque Nacional Lauca</h3>
<p>This world biosphere reserve, 160 km north-east of Arica, near the Bolivian border, encompasses Lake Chungar&aacute;, one of the highest lakes in the world, 
spectacularly situated at the foot of the dormant twin Pallachata volcanoes. It supports vicu&ntilde;a, condor and vizcacha, and Aymara alpaca and llama herders. There 
is extensive bird life along the shores of Lake Cotacotani, and panoramic views from the 5300-metre-high summit of Cerro Guane Guane</p>
<h3>Chilo&eacute; Island</h3>
<p>Only about 180 km long and 50 km wide, the Isla Grande de Chilo&eacute; is a well-watered, densely forested island of undulating hills, with a temperate maritime 
climate. It is linked to the Chilean mainland by ferries departing from the island's northern tip. Its towns feature distinctive shingled houses and stilt homes, and its 
weather is known for precipitation and fog. When visible, however, a majestic panorama across the gulf to the snow-capped volcanoes of the mainland are 
revealed. Ancud and Castro are the only two sizeable towns, but there are over 150 picturesque wooden churches servicing the island's small villages. Parque 
Nacional Chilo&eacute; protects extensive stands of native coniferous and evergreen forest and a long and almost pristine coastline. The rare pud&uacute; also lives here</p>
<h3>Parque Nacional Puyehue</h3>
<p>Situated in the beautiful Lake District, this is Chile's most popular national park. It preserves 107,000 hectares of verdant montane forest and starkly awesome 
volcanic scenery. Dense forest hides puma, the rare pud&uacute; (a miniature deer) and prolific bird life, including the Chilean torrent duck. Nature trails, lake views, ski 
resorts, thermal springs, waterfalls and examples of some of Chile's strange plant life, in particular the umbrella-leaved nalca and multi-trunked ulmo, are some of 
the many attractions which draw visitors. </p>
<h3>Parque Nacional Laguna San Rafael</h3>
<p>Despite the difficulty and expense of getting here, this glacier-filled, 1.7-million hectare park in southern Patagonia is the most popular attraction in the Ais&eacute;n region. 
It encompasses some of the most spectacular fjord and mountain scenery in the world and is dense with floating icebergs. The terrain is unforgiving for hikers, but 
the rewards are many: in the water there are ducks, albatross, Magellanic penguins, otters, sea lions and elephant seals; in the surrounding forests and uplands there 
are pud&uacute;s, pumas and foxes. Charter flights from Colhaique land in the park, and there are a number of (costly) ferry services from Colhaique and Puerto 
Chacabuco.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="easter">Easter Island (Rapa Nui) </a></h2>
<p>Lying 3700 km west of the Chilean mainland, enigmatic Easter Island is the world's most remote inhabited island. It is actually more Polynesian than Chilean, though 
the presence of Pacific Islanders in this isolated part of the world is as much a mystery as how their descendants managed to design and sculpt the hundreds of 
colossal statues (moai) from hard volcanic basalt - let alone transport them from the inland quarries to the coast. This really is off the beaten track: you can sail more 
than 1900 km in any direction without sighting inhabited land. Chile officially annexed the island in 1888 during the period of expansion which followed the War of 
the Pacific. Only about 2000 people live on the island, and nearly all of them live in the town of Hanga Roa. The population is 70% Polynesian, with most of the 
remainder coming from the Chilean mainland. The island is virtually an open-air national park, and boasts 300moais and related stonework. </p>

<h2><a name="gen">GENERAL INFORMATION</a></h2>
<p>. the country of the large skies, a great world still mostly virgin offering supreme beauty in a high diversity of surprising outlooks: desert, mountains, pampa, lakes, 
glaciers, falls and oceans. Buenos Aires, a city open to every etnic group and so European in character, Iguazzu Falls, the site of great waters, Bariloche's typical 
Alpine attraction and the great Patagonian Andes and the land of glaciers. A country of many worlds, surprisingly easy to visit. - Argentina forms the eastern half of 
South America's long, tapering tail. It's a big country - the eighth-largest in the world, and the second-largest on the South American continent. It borders Chile, 
Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil and Bolivia. It also shares the offshore island territory of Tierra del Fuego with Chile, and continues to dispute the ownership of the Islas 
Malvinas (the Falklands to the British). Argentina's topography is affected by both latitude and altitude, and is accordingly varied. The country can be divided into 
four major physiographic provinces: the Andes to the west, the northern lowland, the central Pampas, and Patagonia. Argentina's climate ranges from subtropical in 
the north through humid and steamy in the centre to cold in the south. - European influences are in every aspect of Argentina's art, architecture, literature and 
lifestyle. As a result, there are many important art museums and galleries in the city, and it has a vigorous theatre community. Probably the best known Argentine 
popular culture is the tango - a dance and music which has captured the imagination of romantics worldwide. </p>
<p><b>Size: </b>Second largest country in South America. Argentina's territory would cover a third of Europe and is as long as the US in wide. spanning 1.100.000 square 
miles. </p>
<p><b>Population: </b>28.000.000 of which 9.000.000 live in Buenos Aires. </p>
<p><b>Capital: </b>Buenos Aires. spanning, 77 square miles, has 350,o of the country's population. </p>
<p><b>Electricity: </b>220volts. 30 50 cycles (US is 110volts). </p>
<p><b>Religion: </b>Roman Catholic. </p>
<p><b>Entrv requirements: </b>A valid US passport. No Visa for tourist stays up to 90 days. </p>
<p><b>Weather &amp; clothing: </b>The topography of Argentina is varied. To the west is the Andes, to the north the vast forested plains of the Chaco, to the south the vast 
Pampas and in the far south Patagonia. Dress should be tailored to the area being visited. Seasons are reversed. so when it is winter in the US it is summer in 
Argentina and vice-versa. Average temperatures for Buenos Aires are: </p>
<pre WIDTH="132">TEMP F.		JAN	APR	JUL	OCT

a.m.-7:30 p.m. Monday-Friday and 9:00 a.m.-1:00 p.m. Saturday. There is an excellent outdoor market in historic San Telmo on the weekends that specializes in 
antiques and art. </p>
<p><b>Currency: </b>The official currency is the Peso. There is a fluctuating exchange. </p>
<p><b>Getting around the country: </b>Both national carriers, Aerolineas Argentinas and Austral connect major points in Argentina with the capital. Because of the size of

<h2><a name="bue">Buenos Aires</a></h2>
<p>The capital and country's largest city, Buenos Aires is often referred to as &quot;The Paris of South America&quot;. With a population of around 9,000.000 and spanning 
some 77 square miles. Buenos Aires is a world class sophisticated city. The heart of the city today, as in colonial days, is the Plaza de Mayo with the Casa Rosada 
(Pink House - Presidential Palace) and the Cathedral where San Martin. the father of Independence. is buried. The Avenida 9 de Julio is the widest avenue in the 
world -the obelisk commemorating the 400th anniversary of the city stands midway. Tree-lined boulevards. parks and plazas are abundant and the skyline, though 
punctuated with a few new skyscrapers, resembles that of Paris. Night life is late - dining begins around 10:00 p.m. There are several tango houses ranging from 
music only to music and dance: discos ad clubs are abundant and Calle Lavalle is lined with movie houses and theaters. The world famous Colon Opera House 
spans an entire city block and offers a wide range of cultural presentations from March through December. Sightseeing tours are available to visit the city's nearby 
haciendas for an authentic Fiesta Gaucha, traditional steak dinner with tango show, but Buenos Aires is very much a city to stroll about. to enjoy sidewalk cafes, 
chic boutiques and excellent museums. </p>
<h3>Mar del Plata</h3>
<p>Mar del Plata is &quot;the&quot; beach of Argentina. Situated on the northern Atlantic coast, 400 km from the capital, beaches in this area sprawl for eight km, with 
sophisticated mansions (reflecting the area's upper-class origins) mingling with the new middle-class resorts. Sea lions keep an eye on the fishing activities around 
the wharves, and a replica of the grotto of Lourdes is a kitsch paradise.</p>
<h2><a name="pamp">The Pampas</a></h2>
<p>The unrelentingly flat Pampas is Argentina's agricultural heartland and the home of the gaucho. Comprising the provinces of Buenos Aires, La Pampa and major 
parts of Santa Fe and C&oacute;rdoba, its environments include forested hills, extensive grasslands and flamingo-coated salt lakes. The Parque National Liahu&eacute; Calel has 
dense wildlife including puma, guanaco, rhea, native hares and a variety of wild chinchilla called &quot;vizcacha&quot;. The cities of La Plata, Luj&aacute;n (whose basilica to La 
Virgen de Luj&aacute;n receives four million pilgrims a year), Rosario and Santa Fe are worth seeing for their many museums, churches and faded colonial buildings</p>
<h3>C&oacute;rdoba : THE HEARTLAND OF ARGENTINA</h3>
<p>The province of Cordoba sits in the center of Argentina, its southern plains the northern half of the pampa, its western border rimmed by an offshoot of the Andes, 
its northern limit the beginning of a vast desert and its eastern edge parallel to but never touching the Parana River, Argentina's main waterway. The province is 
shaped like a classical torso, the trunk giving the impression that the body once stood on its right leg, the left arm and leg raised before the limbs were truncated. 
The territory Cordoba covers is twice that of Austria, but only a quarter that of Texas. </p>
<p>The area's history stretches back into the 16th century when the region was governed from its far-off Lima. Cordoba was the southernmost city under the 
administration of the Viceroyalty of Peru, leaving the populace with a heritage diametrically opposed to that of Buenos Aires. At the time of Argentine 
independence in 1816, English historian Arnold Toynbee has written, &quot;Cordoba was already an important city, while Buenos Aires was then still an insignificant little 
port&quot;. Late last century the roles were reversed, as Toynbee noted, &quot;While Cordoba continued to sleep a Peruvian-like slumber, Buenos Aires built herself up into a 
great modem city by importing European immigrants on a North American scale to populate her vast hinterland on the pampa and to develop its potential wealth&quot;. 
But Cordoba eventually did react. &quot;Cordoba was piqued but remained torpid, till suddenly, within the last few years, this once old-fashioned city began to 
transform herself into an industrial center&quot;, Toynbee observed in 1966 in his book, Between Maule and the Amazon. Today Cordoba is a province rich in 
agriculture and industry, its natives proud and productive. The province produces a third of Argentina's sorghum, 29 per cent of the sunflower seed, 27 per cent of 
the corn and 99 per cent of the peanuts, planting almost ten million acres in grains and legumes every year. Seven and a half million head of cattle roam the plains, 
and the province's hills are rich in marble, granite, mica, quartz, feldspar, manganese and wolfram. Its lakes and mountains are weekend playgrounds readily 
accessible to the one million residents of Argentina's second city. Over two million Argentine tourists visit the province every year.</p>
<p>For the traveler, Cordoba offers a comfortable contrast to the extravaganzas of Argentina's extremities: the Andean north with its indigenous Incaic roots and the 
roaring Iguazu Falls or the thrilling sights of Patagonia, with its glaciers and marine wildlife. Cordoba offers culture in consumable doses, scenery in serene settings, 
and as one Cordoba lawyer points out, the best asset of all: the province's warm and willing people. The infrastructure is adequate though never luxurious, the roads 
are often winding but never hair-raising, and the sights are singular while serene. Cordoba&#146;s tourist circuits spread out from the capital city like the spokes of a 
wheel, and many can be covered comfortably in a day. From caves with prehistoric rock paintings and colonial Jesuit ranches to Teutonic enclaves, villages tucked 
in intimate valleys with moderate microclimates and scenic mountain streams, the fare is varied. Many of Argentina's major artists have chosen comers of Cordoba 
to concentrate on their craft in more tranquil conditions. The pace is more peaceful and the people less intense than in Buenos Aires. And Cordoba, as the nation's 
second city, does get an ample sampling of the international performers who play BA, because Cordoba is just an hour from the country's capital by plane. </p>
<p>There are six basic tours which take the visitor to every comer of the province:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first goes north and west of the city following river valleys toward the neighboring province of La Rioja. This tour starts at Carlos Paz Lake, a large 
artificial body of water which attracts Argentines from all over in summer. From there the traveler weaves up through the gentle slopes, visiting Cosqufn, 
which in late January is the site of a ten-day folkloric music festival, La Cumbre and surrounding villages, which provide a summer setting similar to that of the 
Adirondacks resorts. In Cuchi Corral the hardy enjoy hang-gliding, and near Capilla del Monte, at the site of an extinct volcano, there have been frequent 
UFO sightings. The farthest point on this circuit is the village of San Marcos Sierras with a colonial church and a benign microclimate which makes the area 
Argentina's most important honey producing region. </li>
<li>The second tour covers the province's larger lakes in an oval-shaped circuit going south toward the province of Buenos Aires. On one leg of the trip the 
traveler sees the handsome Jesuit church in Alta Gracia, visits the Mountainside villages, settled by German immigrants, so reminiscent of the Alps, and can 
fish in the series of lakes along the way. At the southernmost part of the tour, there are rustic archaeological remains of the Comechingones Indians. This 
circuit provides a glimpse of a combination of small cities, historical and natural landmarks.</li>
<li>The third tour is more historically oriented, taking the traveler to the most spectacular of the Jesuit farming complexes at Santa Catalina and Jesus Maria. The 
sight worth seeing closest to Cordoba is Colonia Caroya, where a magnificent Jesuit building, once a factory for making swords and knives, is now a 
museum commemorating the arrival of the town's founding fathers. The building itself manages to counterbalance the rather modest exhibits. A bit further 
northward, Cerro Colorado provides an interesting sampling of rock painting done by indigenous artists ten centuries ago. Santa Catalina, a Jesuit farm 
village still actively used by its present owners, is the highlight of this tour and an historical monument of worldclass dimensions.</li>
<li>The fourth tour takes the traveler to the far side of the Sierras, the low mountain range which runs north-south along the province&#146;s western frontier. Here on 
the plateaus beyond the peaks, nature is beautiful and benign, with wonderful rocky river beds for swimming. Cordoba&#146;s tallest mountain, Champaqui, 
almost 9,000 feet high, rises in the distance. Each little village along this route offers an adequate small inn or a homey restaurant for the visitor to relax in the 
middle of his trip. This excursion takes the traveler to scenery that is less familiar. Combined with a visit to the Jesuit colonial church at Candelaria at the 
northern end of the circuit, the tourist can see the most unusual and least visited of the province's sights. </li>
<li>The fifth tour is for mountain lovers, weaving through valleys under extinct volcanoes and passing small villages that date back to the 17th century. In summer 
there are countless streams which offer fresh pools and shady spots for picnics. </li>
<li>The sixth tour leads north to a large inland sea, which boasts a salt concentration five times that of the Atlantic Ocean, with spas for treatments based on the 
area's mineral enriched waters and mud. Pink flamingos are the most spectacular of the 245 species of birds to be found in the region. Another attraction are 
the nutria farms, which breed the animals for the fur industry. This tour should probably be saved for last, as the province's tourist department recommends 
this circuit for &quot;rest and recovery&quot;. The city of Cordoba itself has a fourteen block area limited to pedestrian traffic, and some of Cordoba&#146;s most important 
sights can be reached there on foot. Santo Domingo Church, the Cathedral, the Cabildo, La Merced Church and the Jesuit colonial complex on Obispo 
Trejo Street, for example, are all on this route. </li>
</ul>
<p>As Cordoba was the country's most important city for over a century, the few buildings that still survive from that period evoke that important heritage. Three 
Jesuits arrived at Cordoba in 1599. The city housed sixty families and six thousand Indians back then. The Church of the Company of Jesus, the most important 
church of the period, was built between 1650 and 1674. Cedar wood was brought from Paraguay for the roof while the walls were built with local stone. Although 
the Jesuits were expelled from the colonies in 1767, the building has survived intact and is a magnificent monument to their ability as architects and builders. Another 
spot worth visiting in the city is the Juan de Tejada Museum of Religious Art, located in the Carmelite Church and Convent, which was built in 1622. Rebuilt or 
restored in 1714 and 1770, the buildings offer the visitor an insight into what monastic life in South America must have been like two or three centuries ago. The 
museum, which should be visited, is only open on Wednesdays and Saturdays from 10 a.m. until noon. The Marquis de Sobremonte Historical Museum is another 
sight worth visiting. Construction on this unique colonial home was started in 1752 by a wealthy descendent of the founder of Cordoba. The building was planned 
to house his eight children. The Marques de Sobremonte rented the residence from 1783 to 1796. Today the homestead is decorated with period furniture and has 
displays of antique firearms, musical instruments, including an 18th century church organ, and fine paintings from colonial times.</p>
<p>If the visitor has time for only one quick visit, I would recommend that it be to the Jesuit estancia at Jesus Maria, founded in 1618 and famous back then for its 
grapes, walnuts and wines. The San Isidro Church itself is a handsome building surrounded by simple shady gardens and a pond. In the adjoining convent an 
excellent collection of Argentine pre-Columbian art is on display. Formed by Jesuit Father Oscar Dreidemie, the selection is as fine as any to be found in the 
country and has been incorporated into the holdings of the National Museum of Jesuit Art. Less than an hour by car from the center of the city, with an excellent 
roadside restaurant nearby for a delicious lunch or supper of carefully barbecued beef and goat, this combination gives the harried traveler a brief overview of the 
best of Cordoba in an easy half-day excursion. The attractions of Cordoba range from the timeless flavor of rural mountain valley villages to the refreshing scenery 
of rocky rivers nestled in wooded hillsides. The city itself is big but not too busy; part of it seems caught in the cocoon of time, offering treasures surviving from the 
region's resplendent golden age when the town's government depended directly on faraway Lima. As one chronicler of Cordoba, Jorge Arrambide, likes to point 
out, &quot;The best feature of Cordoba is the people of the province&quot;. In addition to finding culture and adventure, the traveler may discover a friend among the amiable 
and warm-hearted individuals he comes across while visiting this vast province. </p>

<h2><a name="igua">The North</a></h2>
<h3>Iguaz&uacute; Falls</h3>
<p>At the border conjunctions of Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil. the spectacular falls are viewed up close from the Argentine side. Wooden walkways take you along 
the edge of the falls to Devil's Throat. With 3&quot;/2 kilometers and 27,5 falls, Iguazu Falls are higher and wider than Niagara. Throughout the near jungle-like 
surroundings are gorgeous flora. exotic birds and magnificent butterflies. Fly from Buenos Aires for the day or overnight, the Hotel Internacional overlooks the fall 
and is convenient for the walkways. Several other hotels are located nearby the falls, To visit the Brazilian side of the falls a visa for entry into Brazil is required. 
These spectacular falls, just east of the confluence of the Iguazu and Paran&aacute; rivers carry at least 5000 cubic metres of water per second into a 70 metres plunge. 
The area is also famous for its historic ruins of Jesuit missions which also draw many visitors. San Ignacio Min&iacute;, built in a style of architecture known as 'Guaran&iacute; 
baroque', is especially popular. Above the falls, the waters are suitable for canoeing, kayaking and other water sports. The surrounding park is home to 55,000 
hectares of pristine subtropical rainforest, with abundant wildlife and plant species.</p>
<h2><a name="andes">The Andean North-West</a></h2>
<p>Home to abundant natural attractions and atmospheric relics from the pre-Columbian and colonial past, this is the more 'traditional' part of Argentina. It includes the 
provinces of Jujuy (numerous wildlife reserves), Salta (with the best preserved colonial city in the country, hundreds of archaeological sites, and colonial buildings), 
Tucum&aacute;n, La Rioja, Catamarca and Santiago del Estero. </p>
<h3><b>Mendoza</b></h3>
<p>At the foot of the Andes. Mendoza is a modern city set on historic foundations -Liberator San Martin crossed the Andes from here to help in the liberation of Chile. 
Though rainfall is slight, irrigation turns the surroundings into a green oasis covered with productive vineyards and fruit plantations. Wine making season is 
March/April and there are numerous bodegas where winetasting is a popular activity. The city, is mainly modern with low buildings and with many gardens and 
trees. there are 9 excellent museums. Mountain climbing and trekking are available from Mendoza, and Argentina's newest ski resort, Las Lenas, is south of the city 
in Calle Hermoso.</p>
<h3><b>Salta/Jujuy</b></h3>
<p>Historic Salta. founded in 1582 and Jujuy, founded for the third time in 1593. offer an excellent three night excursion. Salta is in a hilly and strikingly beautiful district 
and is a handsome city, with fine old colonial buildings. From Salta a magnificent round-trip excursion can be made to Cafayate (the views of the Andean-foothill 
desert with strange rock formations and unexpected colors are fascinating). The population around Cafayate is largely Indian and native costumes abound. The 
drive from Salta to Jujuy, includes a picturesque 57 mile winding road through the mountains known as La Cornisa. Jujuy also offers good colonial buildings and the 
surrounding countryside is varied. Most packages begin in one city, visit Cafayate and end in the other city. Easy air connections connect both Salta and Jujuy to 
Buenos Aires. </p>
<h2><a name="pata">The South</a></h2>
<h3>Patagonia</h3>
<p>This province features a glacier-dotted mountainous interior, unique coastal wildlife and Andean national parks. Pen&iacute;nsula Vald&eacute;s offers large numbers of sea lions, 
elephant seals, guanacos, rheas, Magellanic penguins, sea birds, flamingos and right whales. The Moreno Glacier of Santa Cruz is one of the world's few advancing 
glaciers: a 60-metre-high river of rising, toppling and exploding ice.</p>
<h3>Tierra del Fuego</h3>
<p>Argentina shares half of this island with Chile. It's a place of oil derricks, sheep, glaciers, wind and waterways. Ushuaia and R&iacute;o Grande are the two main towns; 
awesome scenery, wild walks and fishing are the island's main attractions. Argentina's only coastal national park comprises rivers, lakes, forests and glaciers, with 
great trekking and wildlife-spotting opportunities</p>

<hr>
<p>Paraguay is a landlocked country surrounded by Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia. The country is divided into two unequal portions by the R&iacute;o Paraguay, the third 
largest river in the western hemisphere. To the west of the river is the Chaco, a largely infertile and sparsely populated tract of land that makes up nearly 60% of the 
country's area. To the east is a well-watered, elevated plateau of tumbling grasslands, with patches of subtropical forest, stretching all the way to the R&iacute;o Paran&aacute; on 
the Brazilian and Argentinian borders. This eastern portion is considered Paraguay proper, where almost all the population is concentrated. Wildlife is diverse and 
includes a number of parrot and parakeet, wood stork, hyacinth macaw and the once-thought-to-be-extinct Chacoan peccary, plus large reptiles such as caiman, 
anaconda and the boa constrictor. However, due to the dense human population of rural eastern Paraguay, mammals such as the giant anteater, maned wolf, 
Brazilian tapir and jaguar are fast disappearing. The climate in eastern Paraguay is humid, with rainfall evenly distributed throughout the year. Temperatures are 
almost universally hot in summer (January to March), averaging 35 degrees Celsius, but can drop as low as five degrees Celsius in winter (July to September). 
Frosts at this time are not uncommon, but there is little or no snowfall. Temperatures are higher in the Chaco and the rainfall is more erratic</p>

<hr>
<p>Uruguay - the smallest Hispanic country in America. For the most part, the country's undulating topography is an extension of that in southern Brazil, and includes 
two lowly ranges - the Cuchilla de Haedo and the Cuchilla Grande. The terrain levels out west of Montevideo, while east of the capital are impressive beaches, 
dunes and headlands. Five rivers flow westwards across the country and drain into the R&iacute;o Uruguay. To the south is the wide estuary of the R&iacute;o de la Plata. - The 
country's flora consists mostly of grasslands, with little forest except on the banks of its rivers and streams. In the south-east, along the Brazilian border, are 
lingering traces of palm savanna. Wild animals are scarce, although rhea (a bird-like ostrich) can still be seen in areas near major tributaries. The climate is 
temperate, even in winter, and frosts are almost unknown. Rainfall, evenly distributed throughout the year, averages about 100 mm over the entire country. - 
Uruguayans are voracious meat eaters and the parrillada (beef platter) is a national standard. Another standard is chivito, a tasty and substantial steak sandwich 
with all the trimmings. Typical snacks include ol&iacute;mpicos (club sandwiches) and h&uacute;ngaros (spicy sausage wrapped in a hot dog roll). Tea or mate is quaffed in 
enormous quantities. Cleric&oacute;, a mixture of white wine and fruit juice, and medio y medio, part sparkling wine and part white wine, are popular, and the beer is 
pretty good. </p>
<h3>Montevideo</h3>
<p>The capital and only large city sprawls along the banks of the R&iacute;o de la Plata, almost directly opposite Buenos Aires. It's a picturesque place of colonial Spanish, 
Italian and Art Deco styles. Most attention is focused on the Ciudad Vieja, the old city built on a peninsula close to the port and harbour, and the commercial 
centre, located around Plaza Independencia to the east. To get your bearings in the city centre, take a walk from Plaza Independencia, the grandest of 
Montevideo's squares, through the Ciudad Vieja to the port. On the plaza is the black-marbled Mauseleo de Artigas, topped by an enormous statue of the national 
hero, and the 26-storey Palacio Salvo, the tallest building in South America when built in 1927 and still the tallest in the city today. The Plaza Constituci&oacute;n, 
neoclassical Cabildo and the Iglesia Matriz, the oldest public building (1799) in the city, are further west. Other important sights in the area include the Museo 
Hist&oacute;rico Nacional, which consists of four different homes filled with historical effects, and the Museo del Gaucho y de la Moneda, which houses an impressive 
display of artefacts from Uruguay's gaucho (cowboy) past. Also, don't miss the Mercado del Puerto, once the finest port in South America, and now a colourful, 
lively centre filled with markets, restaurants, artists and street musicians. The Feria de Trist&aacute;n Narvaja is an outdoor market peddling groceries, antiques and 
souvenirs. A handful of sandy beaches stretch along the metropolitan waterfront and are popular excursions for the city's residents on summer weekends. </p>
<h3>The Uruguayan Littoral</h3>
<p>West of Montevideo, and covering the portion of Uruguay which fronts the R&iacute;o de la Plata and the R&iacute;o Uruguay, is the country's most important agricultural area. 
Its outstanding attraction is the lively colonial city of Colonia (del Sacramento), an under-appreciated gem of narrow cobbled streets flanked by whitewashed 
buildings. The boating, fishing and swimming are good along the beaches of Mercedes, and there are many excellent museums in Paysand&uacute;, Uruguay's second 
largest city. </p>
<h3>The Uruguayan Riviera</h3>
<p>The area east of Montevideo is one of the most Westernised places in Uruguay with innumerable beach resorts, plenty of water activities and lots of well-groomed, 
narcissistic tourists sporting hibiscusy shirts. Immediately east of the capital is the major resort of Atl&aacute;ntida, and Piri&aacute;polis is a mere flick of the towel away. From 
here, you can venture into the surrounding countryside and climb the 493-metre Cerro Pan de Az&uacute;car or visit Minas, a lovely town set in wooded hills. - The 
largest and best known of the resorts is Punta del Este, one of South America's most glamorous and exclusive destinations. The place is awash with yacht and 
fishing clubs, golf courses, casinos and beautiful holiday homes. If that's not enough, there are excellent bathing beaches, perfect for swimming and sunbathing. Just 
offshore are Isla Gorriti, which has more superb beaches and the ruins of an 18th-century fortress, and Isla de Lobos, a nature reservethat is home to a large 
sea-lion colony.</p>

<hr>
<h2 align=left><a name="gen">GENERAL INFORMATION</a></h2>
<p align=left>Brazil is the world's fifth-largest country, occupying almost half of the South American continent. Scarcely populated, some regions with previously low population, 
such as the Amazon, are being rapidly settled, logged and depleted. - Brazil can be divided into four major geographic regions. The long, narrow Atlantic seaboard: 
the large highlands - which extend over most of Brazil's interior south of the Amazon Basin; the Paraguay Basin, characteri\zed by open forest and the densely 
forested Amazon Basin. The 6275-km-long Amazon is the world's largest river, and the Amazon forest contains 30% of the world's remaining forest. - Most of the 
country has noticeable seasonal variations in rain, temperature and humidity, but only the south has extreme seasonal changes. Winter is from June to August, in 
summer (December to February), Rio is hot and humid, with temperatures in the high 30s; the rest of the year, temperatures hover around 25 degrees. The 
north-east coast gets as hot as Rio but is less humid. The Amazon basin is the rainiest part of Brazil, and while it is humid, temperatures average a reasonable 27 
degrees.</p>
<p align=left>Brazilian culture has been shaped not only by the Portuguese, who gave the country its religion and language, but also by the country's native Indians, the 
considerable African population, and other settlers from Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Brazilian music has always been characterised by great diversity and, 
shaped by musical influences from three continents, it is still developing new and original forms. The samba, which reached the height of popularity during the 
1930s, is a mixture of Spanish bolero with the cadences and rhythms of African music. The more subdued bossa nova, popular in the 1950&#146; was influenced by 
North American jazz. Tropicalismo is a mix of musical influences that arrived in Brazil in the 1960s, including Italian ballads. More recently, the lambada, influenced 
by Caribbean rhythms, has become internationally popular.</p>
<p align=left>The staples of the Brazilian diet are white rice, black beans and manioc flour, usually combined with steak, chicken or fish. Brazilian specialities include moqueca, a 
seafood stew flavoured with dend&ecirc; oil and coconut milk; caruru, okra and other vegetables mixed with shrimp, onions and peppers; and feijoada, a bean and meat 
stew. On many street corners in Bahia, women wearing flowing white dresses sell acarj&eacute;, beans, mashed in salt and onions and then fried in dend&ecirc; oil. The fried 
balls are filled with seafood, manioc paste, dried shrimp, pepper and tomato sauce.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="rio">Rio de Janeiro</a></h3>
<p>In one of the world's most beautiful setting - between ocean and escarpment - seats Rio de Janeiro. Rio has its problems, a third of the people live in the favelas 
(shanty towns) that blanket the hillsides; the poor have no schools, no doctors, no jobs; drug abuse and violence are endemic; police corruption and brutality are 
commonplace: there is even a special police unit which patrols areas frequented by gringos. Rio is divided into a zona norte (northern zone) and a zona sul (southern 
zone) by the Serra da Carioca, steep mountains that are part of the Parque Nacional da Tijuca. The view from the top of Corcovado, the mountain peak with the 
statue of Christ the Redeemer at its summit, offers the best way to become geographically familiar with the city. Favelas crowd against the hillsides on both sides of 
town. The beach, a ritual and a way of life for the Cariocas, is Rio's common denominator. Copacabana is probably the world's most famous beach, and runs for 
4.5 km in front of one of the most densely populated residential areas on the planet. (It is also the place where you are most likely to be robbed in Brazil.) From the 
scalloped beach you can see the granite slabs that surround the entrance to the bay. Ipanema is Rio's richest and most chic beach. Other beaches within and near 
the city include Pepino, Praia Barra da Tijuca, Flamengo and Aproador. </p>
<p>P&atilde;o de A&ccedil;&uacute;car (Sugar Loaf) is God's gift to the picture-postcard industry. Two cable cars climb 1300 metres above Rio and the Ba&iacute;a de Guanabara and, from the 
top, Rio looks the most beautiful city in the world. The 120-sq-km Parque Nacional de Tijuca, 15 minutes from the concrete jungle of Copacobana, is all that's left 
of the tropical jungle that once surrounded Rio. The forest is an exuberant green, with beautiful trees and waterfalls. Rio's famous glitzy Carnaval is a fantastic 
spectacle, but there are more authentic celebration held elsewhere in Brazil. In many ways, Carnival can be the worst time to be in Rio. Everyone gets a bit unglued 
at this time of year: taxi fares quadruple, accommodation triples and masses of visitors descend on the city to get drunk or high <br>
</p>
<h3><a name="bra">Bras&iacute;lia</a></h3>
<p>Bras&iacute;lia may be a World Heritage Site, but it is only of interest to town planning and architecture students, and those keen to witness the folly of man on a 
metropolitan scale. It must have looked good on paper, and still looks good in photos, but in the flesh, forget it. Designed by architect Oscar Niemeyer, urban 
planner Lucio Costa, and landscape architect Burle Marx, the city was built in an incredible three years between 1957 and 1960. Unfortunately, the<br>
world's most ambitious planned city is designed for automobiles and air-conditioners, not people. Distances are enormous and no-one walks; the sun blazes and 
there are no trees for shelter. Bureaucrats and politicians are lured to Bras&iacute;lia by 100% salary hikes and big apartments, but as soon as the weekend comes they jet 
to Rio or S&atilde;o Paulo - anywhere less sterile. The poor, who work in the construction and service industries, were not part of the plan for an inland capital and live in 
favelas up to 30 km outside the city, called 'anti-Bras&iacute;lias'.</p>
<h3><a name="sao">S&atilde;o Paulo</a></h3>
<p>The biggest city in South America is a city of immigrants and ethnic neighbourhoods. 17 million people live in this megalopolis, many of them descendants of Italian 
and Japanese migrants. Strong industrial development and cultural diversity have provided S&atilde;o Paulo with the largest, most cultured and educated middle class in 
Brazil. S&atilde;o Paulo can be an intimidating place, but if you like big cities, it offers the excitement and nightlife of one of the world's most dynamic. Attractions include 
the baroque Teatro Municipal, Niemeyer's Edif&iacute;cio Copan, and the 16th-century Pat&iacute;o do Col&eacute;gio</p>
<h3><a name="bahia">Salvador da Bahia</a></h3>
<p>Salvador da Bahia (often abbreviated to Bahia or Salvador), is a fascinating city loaded with historic buildings. If beaches are what you want, the only difficulty is 
making a choice. Founded in 1549, Salvador was Brazil's most important city for 300 years, and the Portuguese Empire's second city, after Lisbon. As the centre 
of the sugar trade, it was famous for gold-filled churches and beautiful mansions, and for its many wild festivals and general sensuality and decadence. Carnival in 
Salvador is justly famous and attracts hordes of tourists. Other highlights include 34 colonial churches; the Museu Afro-Brasileira, which is dedicated to Black 
culture; and the Elevador Lacerda, an Art Deco structure with clanking electric elevators which truck up and down a set of 85-metre cement shafts in less than 15 
seconds and carry over 50,000 passengers daily between the port and the hilly historic section of the city. </p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ama">The Amazon</a></h2>
<p>The Amazon is a gigantic system of rivers and forests, covering half of Brazil and extending into neighbouring countries. The stretch of river known as Rio 
Amazonas runs between the cities of Manaus and Bel&eacute;m, though the various rivers which join to form it provide a navigable route for ocean-going vessels to the 
other side of the South American continent. The forest still keeps many of its secrets: to this day major tributaries of the Amazon are unexplored. Of the estimated 
15,000 species of Amazon creatures, thousands of birds and fish and hundreds of mammals have not been classified. A cursory sampling of known animal species 
found in the forest - some common, some rare, some virtually extinct - includes jaguar, tapir, peccary, spider monkey, sloth, armadillo, caiman, alligator, river 
dolphin, boa constrictor and anaconda. Forest birds include toucans, parrots, macaws, hummingbirds and hawks; insect life is well represented with over 1800 
species of butterflies and more than 200 species of mosquitoes; and fish such as piranha, tucunar&eacute;, piraracu, pintado and electric eel abound in such an amazing 
diversity of fish species that biologists are unable to identify 30% of the catch found in Belem's markets.</p>
<p>The most common jumping-off point for excursions into the Amazon is Manaus, which lies beside the Rio Negro, 10 km upstream from the confluence of the 
Solim&otilde;es and Negro rivers, which join to form the Amazon. Although Manaus continues to be vaunted in countless glossy travel brochures as an Amazon 
wonderland, the city itself has few attractions and is dirty, ugly and increasingly crime-ridden. The city's most potent symbol is the Teatro Amazonas, the famous 
opera house designed by Domenico de Angelis in Italian Renaissance style at the height of the rubber boom, in 1896. Day trips and boat tours up the Amazon 
provide a close-up experience of the jungle flora and abundant bird life, and a chance to see what life is like for the cabolcos (inhabitants of the Amazonian river 
towns) in the vicinity of Manaus, but don't expect to meet remote Indian tribes or dozens of free-ranging beasts, because in both cases contact has been 
synonymous with destruction, and both have sensibly fled from accessible areas. </p>
<h2><a name="pant">The Pantanal</a></h2>
<p>The Amazon may have all the fame, but the Pantanal is the place to see wildlife. This vast area of wetlands lies in the far west of Brazil and extends into the border 
regions of Bolivia and Paraguay. Birds are the most frequently seen wildlife, but the Pantanal is also a sanctuary for giant river otters, anacondas, iguanas, jaguars, 
cougars, crocodiles, deer and anteaters. The area has few people and no towns, and access is via the Transpantaneira road which ends at the one-hotel hamlet of 
Porto Jofre. Boat tours are available from the port city of Rio Paraguai on the Bolivian border, but be cautious as the town has a reputation for gun-running, drug 
traffic and poaching.</p>
<h2><a name="igu">Igua&ccedil;u Falls</a></h2>
<p>The Rio Igua&ccedil;u arises in the coastal mountains of Paran&aacute; and Santa Catarina, the Serra do Mar, and snakes west for 600 km before it widens majestically and 
sweeps around a magnificent jungle stage, plunging and crashing in tiered falls at the border with Argentina and Paraguay. The 275 falls are over three km wide and 
80 metres high. The best time of year to see them is from August to November, when there is least risk of flood waters hindering the approach to the catwalks.</p>

<h2><a name="CENTRAL HIGHLANDS">THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS</a></h2>
<p>Political and economic heartland of the country, the Central Highlands stand at the focal point of Kenyan history. Mount Kenya - Africa's second highest peak - 
gave the colonial nation its name and the majority of British and European settlers carved their farms from the countryside around, land held for centuries before by 
the Kikuyu and closely related Meru and Embu peoples. Later, and as a direct consequence, it was to be this region which saw the development of organised 
anti-colonial resistance culminating in Mau Mau. Until Independence, the fertile highland soils ('A more charming region is not to be found in all Africa' thought 
Joseph Thomson, exploring in the 1880s) were reserved largely for Europeans and considered, in governor Eliot's breathtaking phrase, 'White Man's Country'. 
Skilled farmers and herders long before the Europeans arrived, the Kikuyu peoples (Kikuyu, Meru and Embu) were at first mystified to find themselves 'squatters' 
on land whose ownership, in the sense of exclusive right, had never been an issue in traditional society. They were certainly not alone in losing land but, in supplying 
most of the fighters for the Land and Freedom Army, they were placed squarely in the political limelight and in return they've received a large proportion of what 
Kenyans call the Fruits of Independence. Today the land is mostly in African hands again, supporting the coun-try's highest rural population with intensive farming 
on almost all the lower slopes as well as much of the higher ground beneath the Mt Kenya and Aberdares National Parks.</p>
<p>There are considerable rewards in travel through the Highlands. Above all, if you're into hiking, there's the ascent of Mt Kenya. And while hikes lower down and in 
the Aberdares are easier, they're hardly less dramatic, with the bonus of a chance to see some of the Highland wildlife, If you like fishing, the mountain streams are 
full of trout - introduced early this century - and most tourist lodges hire out fishing tackle even if you're not staying. Nor is travel itself ever dull in the Highlands, 
where the range of scenery is a spectacular draw in its own right - primary-coloured jungle and shambas; pale, windswept grasslands; dense conifer plan-tations; all 
with a mountain backdrop. People are everywhere friendly and quick to strike up conversation - towns are animated and markets colourfully chaotic.</p>
<h3>AROUND THE ABERDARES</h3>
<p>The Aberdare Range, which peaks at 4,000m, is much less known than Mt Kenya. The lower eastern slopes have long been farmed by the Kikuyu, more recently 
by European tea and coffee planters, and the dense montane forests which cover the higher reaches are the habitat of leopard, bongo, buffalo and elephant. Above 
about 3,500m, lion and other open country animals roam the cloudy moorlands. The Kikuyu called these mountains Nyandarua ('Drying hide' - for their silhouette) 
long before Thomson in 1884 named them after Lord Aberdare, president of the Royal Geographical Society. In their bamboo thickets and tangled forests Kikuyu 
guerillas hid out for months and even years in the 1950s, living off the jungle and surviving on the strength of techniques learned under British officers during the 
Burma campaign in WW Two, in which many of them had fought. Despite the manhunts through the forests and the bombing of hideouts, little damage was done to 
the natural habitat and Aberdares Park remains one of Kenya's most pristine forest reserves. On the western side, the range drops away steeply to the Rift. It was 
here, in the high Wanjohi valley, that a concentration of settlers in the 1920s and 1930s created the myth of Happy Valley out of their obsessive - and unsettled - 
lives. There's not much to see (or hear) these days: the old wheat and pyrethrum farms having been subdivided after Indepen-dence, the valley's new settlers are 
more concerned with making their smallholdings pay. The memories live on only among veteran wazungu. The Kinangop plateau was settled by Europeans too, but 
the high forest and moorland here was declared Aberdare National Park in 1950. Stretching 60km around the peaks, with the Treetops salient on the lower slopes 
reaching out east, the park, like Mt Kenya's, includes the worst of the weather. Rainfall up here is high, often closing the park in the wet season, though the game 
lodges stay open all year. Somewhat inaccessible, the park is nevertheless close enough to Nairobi to be worth the effort of getting to Nyeri, the usual base. 
Nyahururu, the other important town in the region, has Thomsons Falls as a postcard attraction, and is also the base for a wild cross-country journey to Lake 
Bogoria in the Rift Valley, 1500 metres below. From here, too, begins one of the four routes into the northern deserts, in this case to Maralal and Loiyangalani on 
the east shore of Lake Turkana.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="RIFT VALLEY">THE RIFT VALLEY</a></h2>
<p>Kenya's Rift Valley is only part of a continental fault system which ru 6,000km clean across Africa from Jordan to Mozambique. It is perha Kenya's most important 
topographical feature and as a human a natural divide, it's come to be seen as one of the country's great disting ishing marks - a monumental valley of teeming game 
and Maasai herder a trough of grasslands older than mankind. This image is not entire borne but by reality. For though the valley certainly is a spectacula literal rift 
across the country, with all the stunning vistas and gau escarpment backdrops you could wish for, and while the plains anima still are abundant in places (I even saw 
a cheetah with cubs crossing t main highway near Nakuru one morning), much of the game has be dispersed by human population pressure on to the higher 
plateaux to t south-west, and most of the Maasai nowadays live further south. At least its place in history cannot be diluted. Down the Rift Vall people have 
trekked, generation by generation, over perhaps the last or 3,000 years from the wetlands of southern Sudan and the Ethiopi highlands. Some of these immigrants 
were the forefathers of the Maas who, for several centuries before the Europeans arrived, dominated mu of the valley and its surrounds. Until the beginning of this 
century th lived on either side and the northern Ilaikipiak section were a consta threat to caravans up from the coast. With European settlerdom th were forced from 
their former grazing grounds in the valley's turbule bottleneck and confined to the Southern Reserve throughout much of t colonial era. In terms of travel, the Rift 
Valley offers several exceptional lakes, couple of excellent fast roads, lots of spectacular twisting tracks a some of the wildest country in central Kenya. If you're at 
all interest in wildlife, especially ornithology, you'll find it a source of endless fas nation, with unmissable nature reserves at lakes Nakuru and Bogoria.Apart from 
Nakuru itself, the area covered in this chapter conta few places larger than a village and lodgings, strictly speaking, are scar Though there usually is somewhere to 
put your head down this is a regi where a tent will be worth its extra weight - and walking shoes are added advantage. Transport in the higher, agricultural parts of 
the so is generally good, but northwards, or off the main Nakuru-Barin Kabarnet axis, you can expect long waits, next to no buses and infrequ matatus. The 
northern Rift is lower than most upcountry regions so prepared for some very high temperatures and don't underestimate y water requirements.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="LAKE BARINGO">LAKE BARINGO</a></h2>
<p>At one time a barely accessible retreat favoured only by a few weekende BARINGO now has a fine new road from Nakuru. For the prese though, it remains a 
peaceful oasis in the dry thorn country, rich birdlife and with a captivating character entirely its own. The lake is freshwater (Naivasha is the only other Rift Valley la 
that's not saline) so its fish support numerous birds not otherwise seen fish eagles, pelicans, cormorants and herons, for example - and quite sizeable crocodile 
population. Hippos are common too. Though y rarely see much more than ears and snout by day, they come ashore aft dark and on a moonlit night their presence 
can be unnervingly obvio - even in pitch darkness they're too noisy to be ignored. The crocodil are reckoned to be quite safe, too small to be dangerous and rar 
provoked by hunters as their skins are under-sized - but if you're swi ming you might like to know that a supposed man-eater was shot 1981.<br>
The 'Njemps' people of the lakeshore villages live by an unus mixture of fishing and livestock herding, breaking the taboo on the eati of fish which is the norm 
amongst pastoralists. Speaking a dialect of t Maasai language, these Ilchumps fishermen paddle out in half-submerg dinghies made from saplings of the fibrous 
ambatch tree which grows profusion at the southern end of the lake. The lake itself is heavily silted with the red topsoil of the region a it runs through a whole range 
of colours every day, from coral to put according to the sun@s position and the state of the sky. Recent years drought have reduced it considerably so that a broad 
swathe of grass and reeds lies between the water's edge and the lakeshore properties, where before the water lapped right to the campsite.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="THE PARKS">THE PARKS</a></h2>
<p>The first realisation of where you are in these national parks - among real, uncaptured wildlife - is truly arresting. Which parks to visit, however, seems at first a 
pin-in-the-map decision: any and all of them can provide a store of amazing sight and sound impressions. Amboseli and Tsavo West are the two most accessible, 
with heavily booked game lodges, well-worn tracks and large numbers of elephant. Amboseli, though, is perhaps least recommended, despite its position at the 
foot of Kilimanjaro: it's just too small and too well worn. Tsavo, in contrast, is huge enough to escape company completely, except at Mzima Springs and this is 
worth being part of the crowd for if necessary. Maasai Mara has perhaps the most fabled reputation, with its horizons of wildlife on every side. Somewhat isolated 
in the west, it requires a specific visit - well worth the effort (and perhaps the cost), especially during the yearly wi 'Idebeest migration which takes place between 
July and November. The Mara is also the place to see lions - lots of them. Samburu and Meru, over on the far side of Mt Kenya, have different varieties of animals 
- northern species of giraffe, zebra, antelope, ostrich. Samburu - dry, thorny and split by the Esawo Nyiro river - is increasingly</p>
<h3>MASAI MARA</h3>
<p>Wherever you go there are animals. This is the one part of Kenya where the concentrations of game that existed in the last century can still be seen. The most 
interesting areas, scenically and zoologically, are westward signalled by the long ridge of the Siria-Oloololo escarpment, and if you'v only a day or two you'd do 
well to spend most of your time here, near the Mara river. The reserve is crisscrossed with tracks but smooth surfaces tend t encourage off-road driving. So far this 
hasn't had the damaging effect 1 has in Amboseli - the Mara's ecosystem is far less fragile, and there' much more of it - but there are signs that a balance won't be 
maintains for much longer: look at the stretch along the edge of the forest to th north of Governor's Camp. Big, brunette lions are the best-known denizens of the 
reserve and ther are usually several prides resident around the Musiara Swamps - dry much of the year. It's sometimes possible to watch them hunt - they tak very 
little notice of vehicles. We accompanied one gang of adolesce lions and lionesses for a whole afternoon, just outside the boundar After scanning a big herd of 
cattle across the plain for some time, the made several attempts at some impala, chased a lone hippo into the Mar river, pounced at a warthog with a broken leg but 
failed to catch it - t our mixed feelings of amazement and relief - and finally surrounded a elderly buffalo in the marsh and settled down to wait for darkness. T next 
morning the kill was cold and they were burrowing in the old bull carcase like huge maggots. </p>
<p>While lions seem to be lounging under every other bush, finding cheetah is much harder. These are solitary cats - slender, unobtrusi and somewhat shy. When they 
move though - their speed and agility a marvellous. If you're lucky enough to witness a kill (cynicism about suc voyeurism is quickly dispelled when you find yourself 
on the spot) it likely to take place a kilometre from where the chase began in a clou of dust. But cheetahs are vulnerable to too much harassment. Traditio ally they 
hunt at dawn and dusk (at the same time as the tourists a hunting for photographs) but there's evidence that they're turning to midday hunting pattern when the 
humans are shaded in the lodges - n a good time of day for the cheetah, which expends terrific energy in each case and may have to give up if it goes on for more 
than 30 or seconds. Leopards are rarely seen, though there are plenty of them, and do on the sandbanks at the edge of the Mara you can find their footprint But 
they're largely nocturnal and prefer to remain well out of sight. You have to crane your neck to a lot of trees to have much chance of seei one. Their deep, grating 
roar at night however, is a sound which, on heard, you carry round with you. For rhinos, check out Rhino Ridge where a handful of the reserve survivors are often 
obligingly positioned. Every calf born is a victory a if you have a ranger with you he's certain to know the current ne about the kifaru. The other heavyweights are 
about in abundance. The Mara river surges with hippo and big families of elephant traipse along the forest margins and spread out into the Musiara marshes when 
the herbage is thick and juicy. Buffalo are all over, and not a little menacing to a small jeep surrounded by a thundering herd of several hundred tons. It's the solitary 
old bulls that you need to watch out for, though, and their reputation and that of old rhinos, are not exaggerated. Tourists' vehicles get stoved in quite often - always 
back off. Amongst all these outstanding characters, the herds of humble grazers fade remarkably quickly into the background and it's easy to become blas6 when 
one of the much-hyped 'big five' isn't eyeballing you at arm's length. But those are the hunter@s trophies, not the photographer's. Warthog families - like files of 
dismantled Russian dolls - zebra, gazelle, odd-looking hartebeest and sleek topi are all scattered with abandon across the scene. The topi are particularly 
characteristic of Maasai Mara and there's always one or two in every group standing sentry on a tussock or an old termite mound. They, and giraffe, are often good 
pointers for predators in the vicinity. And the reserve has rare herds of Roan antelope too - swaggering, horse-sized animals with sweeping curved horns - that 
you'll see elsewhere only at the Shimba Hills reserve near Mombasa.</p>
<p>But it's the annual wildebeest migration that plants Maasai Mara in the imagination. With a lemming-like instinct, finally gelled into mass movement, the herds gather 
in their hundreds of thousands on the with-ering plains of Serengeti and begin the long, streaming journey northward. towards the scent of moisture and green grass 
in the Mara. They,arrive in July and August, pouring over the Sand river into the eastern side of rthe reserve around Keekorok and gradually munching their way 
westwards@in a milling, unsettled mass to turn south again in October. Never the most graceful of animals, wildebeest play up to their appearance with frolicsome, 
unpredictable behaviour, bucking like wild horses, springing like jack-in-the-boxes or suddenly sprinting off through the herd for no apparent reason.<br>
The Mara River is their biggest obstacle and heavy rains up on the Mau range where it rises can produce a brown flood claiming thousands of animals as they try to 
cross. Like huge sheep, the brainless masses swarm desperately to the banks and plunge in. Many are fatally injured on rocks and fallen branches: others are 
skewered by flailing legs and horns. With every surge, more bodies bob to the surface and float down-stream. Heaps of bloated carcasses line the banks, injured 
and dying animals struggle mournfully in the mud, vultures and marabous squat in glazed, postprandial stupor. The migration's full, cacophonous impact is awesome 
- both on the plains where the multitudes graze and cavort and at the deadly river crossings. The super-abundance of meat accounts for the Mara's big lion 
population. And through it all, the spotted hyenas scamper and loiter like psychopathic sheep dogs: half a million wildebeest calves are born in January and 
February before the migration, two out of three to perish without returning to the Serengeti.<br>
From the ground, the migration is bewildering and sometimes harrowing as you witness individual struggles and events. From the air, by balloon, it must resemble an 
ant's nest. At around Ksh2,000 for a lhr-11/2hr flight plus a breakfast (cooked on the burners) with vin mous-seux, balloon safaris are the ultimate in bush chic. 
Even, just watching the inflation and dawn take-off is a spectacular early morning sight, especially at Little Governor's Camp deep in the words. And if 
irrepress-ible urges overtake you, this is probably the better place to book standing room in the basket - the balloon drifts serenely at around tree height above the 
Mara triangle to the west of the river. From Keekorok, the other balloon base, the prevailing winds tend to carry the Montgolfiers south, directly into Tanzanian 
airspace, so they fly very high and dri westwards with a different air stream - fine for a grand view no doubt but less satisfactory for animal watching. </p>
<h2><a name="TAITA HILLS">THE TAITA HILLS</a></h2>
<p>A good option if efforts to hitch into TSAVO prove fruitless is to head off west from Voi to Taveta, a highly accessible but largely unvisited region. Apart from also 
being a route into TANZANIA, the Taveta road has some interesting possibilities north and south and for much of the time the magnificent mass of Kilimanjaro 
dominates the scene. The only place attracting much tourist traffic down here is Taita Hills Game Sanctuary - run by the Hilton chain with two hotels acting as bait. 
The private, 110 sq km reserve is past BURA on the south side of the road. There is virtually no chance of getting a lift into the sanctuary itself, though you could 
walk the 1/2km to the first hotel, Taita Hills Lodge, just outside, if you felt like a Hilton meal (Kshl35 for lunch). Having used the lodge facilities, you're entitled to 
free entry to the sanctuary (otherwise usual park fees apply) but even assuming you have transport, this may not be worth it. Despite its reputation, the sanctuary at 
certain times of year can be virtually deserted of wildlife, and its small size is frustrating - you can drive round it in an hour. On the southern side, Salt Lick Lodge 
has to take the prize for the most bizarre hotel architecture in Kenya, looking from a distance like a clump of mushrooms growing out of the swamp. Each of its 
rooms is a turret on a stilt, all of them linked by mock suspension bridges and there's even a drawbridge at the lobby. The ensemble is supposedly in keeping with 
the area's WWI battle history; most of the important Anglo-German engagements in East Africa were fought on these plains. It does, however, provide waterhole 
game-viewing (at the right times of year) to rival the 'Tree Hotels' of the Central Highlands. </p>
<p>To get a glimpse of the less ephemeral history of this region, go up into the TAITA HILLS. Matatus pitch through the fertile chasms on a switchback road to the 
little district capital. After the sultry, dry plains you're transported into another world. The hills at amazingly precipitous and beautiful, striped with cliffs, waterfalls an 
dense cultivation, and highly populated. Near the peaks are patches o thick forest. There's notably prosperity up here, and a strong sense o community - most of 
the people speak the Taita language. The Taita are welcoming and VIUNDANYI is an attractive and enjoy-able centre: the conifer trees and a genuine babbling 
brook running past the football pitch reinforceing a feeling of departure from the thornbush and scrub below. This sense of suspended reality is accentuated by the 
cave of skulls outside the town, one of many ancestor shrines in the hills. To find it ask a passer-by to show you the way: it's halfway to the Mwasungia Scenery 
Guest House, hidden in a banana grove just below the road. In the niche rest the skulls of thirty-two Taita ancestors, exhumed from their graves. The cave was a 
traditional advice centre where the perplexities of life were resolved by consultation with the dead. Christianity has eroded some of the reverence that the Taita 
once had for these shrines, but the niches are left undisturbed nonetheless.</p>
