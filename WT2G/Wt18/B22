about overly stimulating research and ideas. Specifically:

A) Haphazardly selected superficial (but advanced!) extracts
of research news and satire from the Journal of
Irreproducible Results (JIR).

B) News about the annual Ig Nobel Prize ceremony. Ig Nobel
Prizes honor "achievements that cannot or should not be

1993-02-03  Abstracts from JIR, vol. 38, no. 6, Nov/Dec 93

This section contains abstracts of articles that appear in
volume 39, number 6 (the November/December 1993 issue) of
The Journal of Irreproducible Results (JIR).

[PLEASE NOTE: JIR 38:6 is a special theme issue on the
subject of "Politically Incorrect Science."]

           |  FOR FULL TEXT (including lurid  |
           |  photographs) OF THESE ARTICLES  |
           |  SEE THE CURRENT ISSUE OF JIR.   |

"The Saluting Fetus," by Carol B. Benson, M.D., and Peter M.
Doubilet.
A sonogram depicts a human fetus in the saluting position.

"The Mappeltree Soviet Science/Art Controversy," by Bruce
Gellerman.
A U.S. Senator is attempting to ban the showing of allegedly
"obscene" photomicrographs collected by NIH archivist Roger
Mappeltree. The issue is complex; the works were purchased
from agencies of the former Soviet Union under a funding
program that the Senator himself sponsored.

"The Politically Correct Periodic Table of the Elements," by
Robert Rose.
The author has revised the periodic table of the elements,
eliminating all sources of toxicity, pollution and
radiation, all isotopes and artificial elements, all sources
of greenhouse gases, and all causes of hypertension.

"The Guide to Politically Correct Cardiology," by Thomas
Michel.
The nomenclature of specific diagnoses may profoundly affect
a patient's well-being, self-image, and time to full
recovery. For example, a diagnosis of heart failure is
belittling, in that it says to the patient, "your heart has
failed." This guide provides more correct terminology.

"Virtual Academia -- Year 1 Report," by Anne Pamsum
Hufnagle-Chang and Viktor Asa Gupta-Duffy.
The authors report on the first year of a 16-universitiy
virtual reality project designed to replace many costly
aspects of today's universities. In these universities,
students, professors, classrooms, offices, and dormitory
facilites exist only as computer-based concepts.

"An Empirical Investigation of Multicultural Diversity," by
Bruce McAfee.
Two radically different approaches to promoting
multicultural diversity were studied. One university
conducted an extensive, expensive program of courses,
internships, workshops, etc. The other used a "smoke and
mirrors" approach. Both systems were found to be effective.

"Research Funding: New Art," by Stanley Rudin.
A photograph depicts a newly discovered artwork (Greco-
Hebrew, 5th century Athens, 2nd millenium Los Angeles)
portraying scientists in pursuit of funding for a study of
wealthy mice while an ethics committee and the Owl of Athena
look on.

"The Pet Silicone Implant," by John E. Christ.
The author reports on his campaign to enlist a medical
journal's aid in promoting a new use for existing
inventories of now-defunct manfacturers of silicone breast
implants.

"A Call for Scientific Correction," by Gordon Videen.
Scientists can an must reap the rewards of Revisionist
Science. Electrons are not negative, the earth's magnetic
poles are mislabeled, astronomy uses demeaning terminology,
all animals in their natural state are vegetarians, etc.

"Further Alternatives to Live Animals in Teaching Surgery,"
by Douglas Lindsey.
Several inanimate materials proved superior for teaching
surgery: 1) fresh, edible pig feet; 2) plastic soda straws
(unpeeled) for vein dissection; 3) skinned hog necks and
synthetic chamois for cricothyrotomy; fig tree limbs for
intraosseous infusion in small children.

"Guidelines for Equivocation in EEG Reports," By Robert. S.
Hoffman.
The interpretation of electroencephalograms (EEGs) is
necessarily imprecise, offering a pleasing intellectual
challenge to neurologists who engage in the activity. Other
physicians who must use the reports are not pleased. This
guide helps to bridge the gap in temperament.

"Technology Update: The Metor Shower," by Stephen Drew.
A new device is expected to give astronomers the first clear
photographs of meteors. It locates approaching meteorites,
washes them with what is in essence a spray of soapy water,
then photographs them in the moments before they enter the
upper atmosphere.

Interview with Nobel Chemistry Laureate (1976) William
Lipscomb.
Lipscomb discovered much of what we know about the structure
and bonding of boron compounds and of the general nature of
chemical bonding. In this interview, he explains his
controversial views about perfume and aftershave lotions,
offers advice for young people who are entering the field,
and suggests a candidate for the Ig Nobel Prize.

"How to Testify to Congress," by Shelby Miller.
Spurred by the firing of Will Happer as director of the U.S.
Department of Energy's chief research scientist, JIR
presents a new service: a database of currently acceptable
observations, theories, ideas and methods.  Experts from
this field can be rented for appearances before Congress.
[PLEASE NOTE: An excerpt from this article appears in
section 1993-02-04 of this issue of mini-JIR.]

"Elegant Results" (regular column) by Alice Shirell Kaswell.
Styles, trends, and tidbits, culled from leading research
journals. In this issue: findings from the research journals
"Fighting Knives," and "Milk Cover Collector."

"Scientific Gossip" (regular column) by Stephen Drew.
Contains 100% gossip from concentrate. In this issue: Killer
Colognes; Stylish Processing; Virtual Population Growth;
Preferred Lighting; Intergalactic Deficit Reduction; A
Threat from the Middle; A Threat from the Middle; Virtual
Population Growth.

1993-02-04  Testifying to Congress: Our New Service

The Society for Basic Irreproducible Research (SBIR) is
offering a new service to its members. For a small annual
fee, we provide experts to accompany you when you testify
before government agencies. These experts are well-versed in
government policies, procedures and rituals. Each is fully
qualified for the work Each has attended law school, worked
on a political campaign, and been a sports journalist. Three
of our experts have taken a college science course. All are
conversant with episodes of the first Star Trek television
series.

The service has a second part. Since 1955, SBIR has
maintained a database containing currently acceptable
observations, theories, ideas and even methods. The database
can now be accessed, via E-Mail or CD-ROM, for a modest
monthly charge. JIR subscribers receive a 3% discount.

The database contains acceptability criteria for more than
126 countries (including Latvia) across the entire range of
current scientific fields. Interdiscipinary issues may incur
a surcharge. JIR subscribers receive a 3% discount.

The service is called Politically Acceptable Science Service
(PASS). Further news about it will be reported in this space
in a future issue.

This journal may constitute a serious hazard to the
Internet. Within a few hours of the announcement of its
existence, and before the first issue was sent over the
network, the rate of arrival of new subscription requests
climbed exponentially. At the end of the data sampling
period, the growth remained exponential. See figure 1 below.
Simple extrapolation shows that if this trend continues,
every human being on the planet will have subscribed at
least 2.72 times within the first two weeks. This behavior,
exhibited by such a large number of people, presents unique
research opportunities in several of the social sciences.
More detailed analysis of the subscription rates will appear
in the next edition if the Internet survives.*

elastic bands around the ears. A 36-month study assesses how much
"orthodontic" movement of the ear is induced by the continuous tensile
force which these bands exert.

"Footnotes to the First Paragraph of Chapter Three" by David Weinberger
Key literary, philosophical and technological allusions are identified
and explained for a brief quotation attributed to James Joyce, a senior
Vice President at a brokerage firm in Albany, New York. The quote was

1994-01-04  Commentary: The Gallo Case

Commentary by X. Perry Mental, Honorary Chairman, The Society for Basic
Irreproducible Research (SBIR)

     "Misconduct charges against Gallo withdrawn..."
          ---Nature, 366, 191, 1993

     "US clears top AIDS scientist"
          ---International Herald Tribune, Nov 13, 1993, p. 5

These are the surprising[1] headlines.  After nine years of suspicion
and 5 years of investigation, Dr Robert C. Gallo was cleared of all
charges of misconduct by the US dept of Health and Human Services
(USDHHS), after the office "abandoned hope of winning the final
adjudicatory hearing on Dr. Gallo..." because "the evidence produced by
ORI (Office of Research Integrity) did not stand up top legal scrutiny"
(Nature 366, 99, 1993). The charges against Gallo were that "he
misstated in a scientific article how important French research was to
his work and failed to give credit to another scientist (Gazdar) who had
invented the cell culture crucial to his work".

Actually the scapegoat[2] of the whole affair was Gallo's collaborator,
Mikulas Popovic, who originally was found by ORI guilty on 4 counts of
scientific misconduct (and as a result was unemployed for 4 years).
Popovic has now been exonorated by the USDHHS Appeals Board.

As a result of this whole affair, ORI is preparing revised guidelines on
the basis of which a scientist can be convicted of fraud only if he
(she) knew that "a sentence in his/her manuscript might be misleading."

Let us hope that this will be so.  Anyway, Power helps.

NOTES:
[1] to be accurate about it, let us say: "headlines surprising to many"

[2] one can rephrase this: "unfortunate victim"

1994-01-11  A Message From Our Beleaguered Technical Brains

We are currently experiencing some unfortunately non-irreproducible
difficulties.  One problem is that many subscribers are receiving
multiple copies of each issue.  With a list as large as MINI-JIR has
become, even behemoth computers seeem to have trouble getting everything
sent out in one try.  So, they start over and keep trying.  There is a
way around this problem -- maybe -- but we haven't been able to get it
implemented just yet.  In the mean time, as I suggested to one
subscriber who gave me information on his multiple copies, we suggest
that you use the extra copies to line the bottom of your virtual
birdcage for your ethereal parakeet.

A second significant problem is mail bounces we've received for users
whose nodes are not accepting mail.  Sometimes, nodes are not properly
registered; sometimes systems are down; sometimes the byte-sized Gods
just aren't smiling on us.  Subscribers in the United Kingdom seem to be
hardest hit.  As luck would have it, we haven't got a satisfactory
solution for this problem yet either.  If some kind colleague passes
this issue on to you because you didn't get your own copy, you can check
to see if you are properly subscribed by sending a one line message to:
        LISTSERV@MITVMA or LISTSERV@MITVMA.MIT.EDU
that reads:
        QUERY MINI-JIR
By return mail, you should receive information about your mail setting
for this list or a message stating that you are not subscribed.  If you
don't get anything at all, there's something wrong!  Check with your
local postmaster to see if the node is properly registered or what the
correct form of node name is.

Wilde, "The American Journal of Surgery," 1983, no. 146, pp. 376-382.
The report reads in part: "It became fashionable in the decade after
1970 for the humiliated Thai wife to wait until her [philandering]
husband fell asleep so that she could quickly sever his penis with a
kitchen knife. A traditional Thai home is elevated on pilings and the
windows are open to allow for ventilation. The area under the house is
the home of the family pigs, chickens, and ducks. Thus, it is quite
usual that an amputated penis is tossed out of an open window, where it
may be captured by a duck."

1994-02-02      Purpose of the mini-Journal (*)

The mini-Journal of Irreproducible Results publishes news about overly
stimulating research and ideas. Specifically:

A) Haphazardly selected superficial (but advanced!) extracts of research
news and satire from the Journal of Irreproducible Results (JIR).

B) News about the annual Ig Nobel Prize ceremony. Ig Nobel Prizes honor
"achievements that cannot or should not be reproduced." A public
ceremony is held at MIT, in Cambridge Massachusetts, every autumn. The
ceremony is sponsored jointly by JIR and by the MIT Museum.

C) News about other science humor activities conducted by the MIT Museum
and JIR.

------------------------------------------------------------
1994-02-03      Historic Abstracts from JIR, vol. 3, 1956

        [JIR itself is published bi-monthly.
        In months between issues, this section of mini-JIR will contain
        historic abstracts from the JIR archives.]

Volume 3 (1956) of JIR is devoted primarily to zippers.

In the lead article, the zipper is defined as a fastening device
consisting of two flexible strands engaging and disengaging by means of
a sliding cam pulled between them. The zipper was invented in 1891 by
Whitcomb J. Judson (because he became fed up with lacing his shoes and
his wife's corset). After 12 years of toiling to make the device by
hand, he enlisted the help of a Swedish engineer, Gideon Sundback, and
by 1912 they devised the product as we know it today.

The second article is Harry J. Zipkin s "Theoretical Zipperdynamics"
Zipkin first discusses "Zipperbewegiung" of quantum theoretical nature
with no clear resolution of the problem. A semi-infinite zipper, based
on the Schroedzipper equation, is then described, the construction of
which was impossible because of the semi-infinite budget required.

The finite zipper, which, too, is based on the Schroedzipper equation,
presents other problems. These are discussed by Azo-KOHN in the article
"Applications and Complications of Zippery Mechanisms". The following
facts are described:
1. Production of finite zippers is connected with accumulation of Au and
Ag;
2. Concentrated sulfuric acid seriously disturbs the potential activity
of the zipper;
3. The introduction of the plastic zipper is beneficial for forgetful
surgeons: they can use it for closing abdominal postoperative wounds;
4. Electronically operated remote control zippers can be installed on
the oral apertures of talkative spouses;
5. A clear connection exists between the hybridization mechanisms of DNA
and the function of zippers.

Volume 3 also contains an article on "Grading Systems of Scientific
Workers" by D. Rougge. Several systems are evaluated:
1. Idea grading: based on IPM (ideas per minute). It works quite well
for scientists employing many graduate or postgrad students.
2. Execution grading: based on projects - no matter whether original or
not. The important factor is the number of publications or patents.
3. Disagreeable grading : Certain activities (administration of a
department, planning of laboratories, organization of conferences,
inspection of laboratories) seem to be quite disagreeable to scientists.
Promotions can be keyed to the performance of these disagreeable jobs.
4. Public relations: Grading depends on scientists ability to convince
potential investors to part with their money

H. J. Lipkin contributes another non-zipper related article. "The story
of Chanukah" discusses:
1. The view of Sceptics and Antisceptics.
2. The Scottish origin of McAbies.
3. The problem of why potato latkes (in Europe) and doughnuts (in the
USA) are associated with Chanukah.


----------------------------------------------
1994-02-04      WARNING: Perfume as Biohazard

A special announcement from
        William Lipscomb, 1976 Nobel Laureate, chemistry
        Chemistry Department
        Harvard University

[Professor Lipscomb first presented this speech at the Ig Nobel Prize
Ceremony held last October at MIT]

                                        * * *
The international science community is worried about the future of the
earth's environment. The uncontrolled release of perfume into the
atmosphere constitutes a major biohazard.

Please -- after you have read a magazine, don't throw your smelly scent
strips in the trash. Recycle them.

At our recycling center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, we now have
separate bins for glass, for plastic, for metal, and for scent strips.
If your town doesn't recycle scent strips, please do the next best thing
-- stick your scent strips in an envelope and mail them back to the
magazine.

Thank you.
                                        * * *

1994-03-02      News: AIR, Curiousity, Kilt, the, CAT

1. Yes Indeed!
We are very pleased to announce:
You can now become a charter subcriber (whatever that means) to
The Annals of Improbable Research (AIR).  The magazine will appear
on your doorstep 6 times per year.  For details, see section 1994-
03-11 below.  PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD!!!!!!

2. Curiousity
We AIRheads continue to receive queries from former readers of The
Journal of Irreproducible Results (JIR) hungry for details of why
the entire staff (1955-1994) of JIR felt it necessary to resign
from that publication and create The Annals of Improbable Research
(AIR).  The matter is explained in news reports in The Scientist
(July 11), Science (June 24) and Nature (June 9).  Details can
also be obtained by emailing a request to air@mit.edu.

3. Kilt
Would the Scottish reader who mailed a kilt to the AIR editorial
office please inform us of your address?  We are otherwise unable
to send you a letter acknowledging that the contribution is tax-
deductible.

3. the
Effective with this issue of mini-AIR, we must discontinue our
popular data feature "The 'The' Count."  "The 'The' Count"
reported how many times during the previous month the the word
"the" appeared in major metropolitan newspapers in 162 cities.  If
and when Internet sites in Asia and Australia agree not to censor
the data, we will resume publishing the column.

4. CAT
The winner of the CAT scanner lottery is Norman F. Lee of Hong
Kong.  Second prize, a wooden tongue depressor, was won by Traian
Mihaescu of Iasi, Romania.

1994-03-04      Additional, Unreported Dangers from Mexican food

by Steve Mirsky
New York City

The recent report from CSIPI [1] on the high fat and salt content
of Mexican food, though long overdue, still neglects to
implicate the myriad other health dangers consumers face when
dining in Mexican restaurants.

The plates upon which Mexican food is traditionally served
can be very, very hot, indeed approaching the "yip yip woo
hatcha" stage.  Contact between said plates and human skin
can result in tissue damage followed by vigorous hand waving
and blowing that in turn can cause hyperventilation.

A little-discussed danger of Mexican dining is the finite
probability of encounters with roving Mariachia bands.  A
condition known as Castanet Culjone, though rare, is
particularly painful and debilitating.  In addition, the
small mobile orchestras are exceptionally annoying, which can
lower the immune response.

Finally, there is the much observed but little discussed
"twice-burned" phenomenon, consistent with the relative
indigestibility of certain key ingredients of Mexican food
that register particularly high on the Scoville Organoleptic
Test (the official scale of hotness)[2].  At least one Navy test
has shown that window cleaning fluid, especially if it
contains ammonia, can be an effective topical neutralizing
solution for SOEYYWH (Sudden Onset Egress Yip Yip Woo
Hatcha)[3].

1994-03-04      International Sweetness Ages

by Susan Andersen, Lennox University, London, U.K., and Bernadette
Highwood, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Massachusetts

In virtually every culture, people who have generous, kind
dispositions are described as being "sweet."  However, this term
is usually reserved (by other adults) for individuals who have
reached a certain age.  We conducted a cross-national study[1] to
determine how "the minimum age of adult sweetness" varies from
country to country.  Our results our presented below.[2]

1994-04-05      Specimen of the Month

Taxonomic and analytical text prepared by Emmert Lowery, Jr.
This item is on exhibit at The MIT Museum.

ITEM #786-4591-089      Ferdie The Cow

This fiberglass bovine, measuring eight feet in length from tail
to snout and four feet tall at the shoulders, appeared on the
morning of  October 31, 1979 perched atop MIT's 150 feet tall
Great Dome. The previous  night Ferdi had been, "liberated" from
its home in the Hilltop Steak House  in Saugus, Massachusetts, by
an unidentified group of MIT students. Ferdi's visit to the Great
Dome attracted wide media coverage, and the Hilltop management
took it in good stride, displaying Ferdi with mortar board and
diploma after its return home.

Ferdi returned to MIT in 1990, as part of the MIT Museum's exhibit
on science humor. Since then she has served both as exhibit
artifact and landmark. "Take a right at the cow," has become a
standard instruction to visitors.

1994-03-06      May We Recommend...

Research reports that merit a trip to the library:

"Identification of Gourmet Meat Using FINS (Forensically
Informative Nucleotide Sequencing)," by Alistair Raymond Russel
Forrest and Patrick Robert Carnegie., "Biotechniqes," 1994, vol.
17, no 1, pp. 24-26.  The report reads in part:
"To protect both producers and consumers from illegal substitution
of cheaper meats for expensive meats, it is necessary to have
tests available that are effective with both cooked and processed
meats.... This high cost of development cannot be justified for
gourmet meats, such as emu, crocodile, and buffalo...  As an
example of the application of the improved FINS technique, a
sample of an emu shish kebab ordered at a local restaurant was
analyzed..."  It was found that the "emu" shish kebab was actually
buffalo shish keb.  (Thanks to Gene Cutler for bringing this to
our attention.)

"An Automated Feeding and Testing Device for Elephants," by
Charles W. Hyatt, Andy T. Richardson, Bruce W. Copeland, John R.
Lehnhardt, "IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,"
Vol. 43, No. 1, February 1994, pp 100-101.  The abstract reads:
"An automated feeding and testing device was developed to provide
behavioral enrichment and research instrumentation for the
elephants at the National Zoological Park/Smithsonian Institution
in Washington, DC."  (Thanks to Steve Goldstein for bringiing this
to our attention.  Goldstein points out that this device may be
the world's biggest touchpad keyboard.)

******************************************************************
1994-03-9       Purpose of mini-AIR (*)

The mini-Annals of Improbable Research (mini-AIR) publishes news
about improbable research and ideas. Specifically:

A) Haphazardly selected superficial (but advanced!) extracts of
research news and satire from The Annals of Improbable Research.

B) News about the annual Ig Nobel Prize ceremony.

C) News about other science humor activities intentional and
otherwise.

WHAT IS AIR? (An introduction, of sorts)
AIR is a new magazine produced by the entire former editorial
staff (1955-1994) of "The Journal of Irreproducible Results
(JIR)," the world's oldest satirical science journal. The new
magazine's co-founders are Marc Abrahams, who edited JIR from
1990-1994, and Alexander Kohn, who founded JIR in 1955 and was its
editor until 1989. AIR is published at the MIT Museum in
Cambridge, MA.  AIR's editorial board consists of more than 40
distinguished scientists from around the world including seven
Nobel Laureates. Every October, AIR and the MIT Museum produce the
Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony, honoring people whose achievements cannot
or should not be reproduced.

1994-04-02      News: Mysterious JSTEW, AIRhead for a day; etc.

1. About that flood...
If you received six or so copies of the previous mini-AIR issue,
you are not alone.  The problem, as many of you pointed out, was
caused by the LISTSERV distribution site at alaska.edu.  We
apologize for the trouble this caused.  Steps have been taken to
try to prevent this kind of problem from happening again.  Among
other actions, we have ruthlessly, doggedly sought out and
eliminated the mysterious JSTEW whose name appeared on each of the
more than 120,000 spurious messages that the alaska.edu site sent
spewing into e-mailboxes hither, yon, and elsewhere.
        [Much of our incoming e-mail was lost during the flood.
         If you sent us mail and have received no reply,
         kindly try again, if you have the stomach for it.
                                                --the (incompetent) mgmt.]

2. Inflate yourself.
Would you like to be an AIRhead for a Day?
We have prepared an attractively appalling flyer that describes
AIR. We need your help in handing out or posting it at research
conferences, academic meetings, on campuses, and in libraries, and
rest room stalls. If you would like to help, please email us at
air@mit.edu

3. Ig Tickets.
Tickets for this year's Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony go on sale on
Thursday, September 15. For details, see section 1994-04-07 below.

4. Get behind in your reading.
We are very pleased to announce that the first print issue of The
Annals of Improbable Research (AIR) will be published in December.
A subscription form appears in section 1994-04-11, or thereabouts,
we think, maybe.

1994-04-04      Interview with Linus Pauling

by Marc Abrahams

Linus Pauling, perhaps the most distinguished member of the AIR
editorial board, passed away this month.  Pauling is widely
regarded as one of the giants in the history of science. He has
been called the father of modern chemistry, and his pioneering
inquiries have ranged wide and far in the disciplines of biology,
physics and medicine. Linus Pauling was the only person who
received two undivided Nobel Prizes. In 1954 he was given the
Nobel prize for chemistry for his work on the nature of the
chemical bond and its application to the structure of complex
substances. In 1962 he was awarded the Nobel peace prize for his
efforts to bring about the treaty banning tests of atomic
explosives in the atmosphere. This interview took place last year.


Q. To what extent did your schooling interfere with your
education?

I don't think it interfered at all. I think I was fortunate going
to public schools in eastern Oregon and then in Portland. They
were excellent schools, grammar school and high school.

Q. To what extent did you interfere with your education?

Very little. Only one episode that I remember. After I'd been in
high school for three years and a half, having started in February
- mid-year, you see - I realized that I could go on to Oregon
Agricultural College if I graduated at the end of the term. There
was a requirement that to graduate high school the student needed
to have two terms of American history. I was always interested in
history, so I signed up for American History A and American
History B. The teacher who was registering said I had to get the
permission of the principal. I went to the principal, and he said,
"No," so I turned around and went out and changed the two terms of
American history to seventh semester mathematics and eighth
semester mathematics - trigonometry was one of them, and advanced
algebra - changed my schedule and didn't get a high school
diploma. So I interfered with the system to that extent. Then
twenty-five years later, perhaps, I was given an honorary high
school diploma by petition of the high school students.

Q. What is the most intriguing experiment someone might do
regarding human nature?

I don't think I could answer such a question without thinking
awhile. I have tried to.

Q. Do you have any advice for young people who are entering the
field?

Well, I have advice for young people in general. That's a guestion
I get asked reasonably often. I say you should look around
carefully at the members of the opposite sex, and pick one out
that you'd like to be with all your life. Get married young, and
stay married. Then second, I say try to decide what you like to do
best - what you enjoy doing - and then check up and see if it's
possible for you to earn a living doing it.

Q. Is there a third point?

No.

Q. Each year we present Ig Nobel prizes to people whose
achievements cannot or should not be reproduced. Who would you
nominate to win an Ig Nobel prize?

Well of course I'd be pleased to have [Edward] Teller get a second
Ig Nobel prize so he could become listed in the Guinness Book of
Records as the person who's achieved the most Ig Nobel prizes.
[Editor's note: Edward Teller, the father of the hydrogen bomb and
the foremost proponent of the "star wars" missile defense system,
was awarded the 1991 Ig Nobel peace prize. The citation said that
Teller had "changed the meaning of peace as we know it."]

Q. Anyone else come to mind?

Well, let me see. In personal science, Dr. Victor Herbert I think
deserves such a prize. He was at Hahnemann and got fired because
he got in a fistfight with the dean. He - Victor Herbert - is
considered to be a great authority on vitamins, always testifying
on vitamin cases, and he was on the food and drug board that
National Academy president Frank Press fired when they brought in
their report that the RDA's [Recommended Daily Amounts] be
decreased. Then when the National Academy of Sciences had a new
committee and got out a new report, he sued them for using some
material that he had written - for plagiarism. I think that case
has been thrown out of court.

And he in a sense is responsible for my having spent more than 20
years in this vitamin field. He irritated me so much about 1969
that I sat down and wrote my book "Vitamin C and the Common Cold."
Well, Victor Herbert is famous among orthomolecular nutritionists
and physicians. You expect the Food and Drug Administration to be
quoting him by just reading the reports, so they quote him as
authority for statements that I think are just not true. Mr.
Herbert seems to me to be a really good candidate.

Q. Anybody else?

Well, there's an anonymous referee for "Physical Review Letters"
who said that a paper that I wrote should be turned down, a paper
in which I talked about the cluster of nucleons revolving about a
central sphere. He said a structure of that sort is impossible
because quantum mechanics requires that the normal state (or any
other state) be either symmetric or antisymmetric. So I wrote to
the editor and said: "Here, this fellow doesn't understand quantum
mechanics, and you're using him as a referee! He would say that a
molecule of hydrogen chloride, for example, couldn't exist." I
didn't get any reply to that from the editor.

-----------------------------------------------------------
1994-04-06      May We Recommend...

Research reports that merit a trip to the library:

"The Dielectric Properties of Meat" by B. Bodakian and F. X. Hart,
"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation", Vol.
1, No 2, April 1994.  The abstract reads in part:  "The
permittivity and conductivity of beef and chicken samples were
measured in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz. Differences were
observed in these dielectric spectra for commercially purchased,
as compared to freshly slaughtered samples." (Thanks to Anders
Larsson for bringing this and the next citation to our attention.)

"A Classification of Pure Malt Scotch Whiskies" by F. J. Lapointe
and P. Legendre, "Applied Statistics", Vol. 43, No 1, pp. 237-257,
1994.  The authors introduce their study thusly: "Single malts are
well known by amateurs to differ widely in nose, colour, body,
palate and finish. The layman interested in discovering the
diversity of these tasting sensations may wonder how to  approach
the problem: what are the main types of single-malt Scotches, and
in what way do they differ? This is the type of question that came
to us after acquainting ourselves with single-malt whiskies during
and after the  3rd Conference of the International Federation of
Classification Societies held at Heriot-Watt University in
Edingburgh, Scotland, in August 1991."

1994-04-9       Purpose of mini-AIR (*)

The mini-Annals of Improbable Research (mini-AIR) publishes news
about improbable research and ideas. Specifically:

A) Haphazardly selected superficial (but advanced!) extracts of
research news and satire from The Annals of Improbable Research.

B) News about the annual Ig Nobel Prize ceremony.

C) News about other science humor activities intentional and
otherwise.

WHAT IS AIR? (An introduction, of sorts)
AIR is a new magazine produced by the entire former editorial
staff (1955-1994) of "The Journal of Irreproducible Results
(JIR)," the world's oldest satirical science journal. The new
magazine's co-founders are Marc Abrahams, who edited JIR from
1990-1994, and Alexander Kohn, who founded JIR in 1955 and was its
editor until 1989. AIR is published by the MIT Museum in
Cambridge, MA.  The editorial board consists of more than 40
distinguished scientists from around the world including seven
Nobel Laureates. EAch October, AIR and the MIT Museum produce the
Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony, honoring people whose achievements cannot
or should not be reproduced.

------------------------------------------------------------
1994-05-02      The Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony Approacheth -- details

1. Who will win?
All will be revealed on Thursday, October 6, at 7:30 pm. at MIT's
Kresge Auditorium.  Prizes will be awarded in 10 categories to
individuals whose achievements "cannot or should not be
reproduced."  Several of the winners will be present to receive
their Prizes from the genuine Nobel Laureates.

2. Heisenberg Certainty Lecturers
Each Heisenberg Certainty Lecture is on a topic of the speaker's
own choosing, and is striclty limited to 30 seconds.  The time
limit is enforced by a referee. This year's Heisenberg Lecturers
include: Nobel Laureates Sheldon Glashow (Physics), Dudley
Herschbach William Lipscomb (physics), and Richard Roberts
(Physiology or Medicine); astronomer Margaret Geller; and Marvin
Minsky, the father of Artificial Intelligence.

3. Returning Laureate Address.
This year's Returning Laureate Address will be delivered by Jim
Knowlton, the 1992 Ig Nobel Art Prize winner (shared with The U.S.
National Endowment for the Arts) for his seminal poster "Penises
of the Animal Kingdom." Mr. Nolan will speak on the topic, "Onward
and Upward."

4. Ig Tickets.
Tickets are on sale at the MIT Museum Shop in The MIT Student
Center.  The price is $2 per ticket.  There will be a strict limit
of five (5) tickets per person.  We have been asked to remind you
that scalping is illegal in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
For ticket information call 617-253-1533.

5. Calling all Delegations!
A limited number of seats is reserved for official theme
delegations of 4-12 beings (human participants only).  The
Ceremony commences with the formal Grand Entrance Parade of the
Delegations, an experience not to be missed   If you wish to bring
a delegation, please get in touch IMMEDIATELY with:
     Margaret Ann Gray     617-253-0217     mag@mit.edu

6. Poster Pestering
If you are located near Cambridge (MA) and would like to hang some of
our ultrachic 30" x 15" Ig Nobel 1994 Ceremony posters where people
will see and be shocked by them, please drop by the MIT Museum
and pick some up.

7. AIRhead proliferation.
An impressive number (of which we did not keep track) of readers
responded to our manipulative offer to become an AIRhead for a
Day.  These AIRheads are taking copies of our attractively
appalling flyer, and handing them out or posting them at
conferences, meetings, and classes, and in libraries and,
especially, in rest room stalls. If you would like to be an
AIRhead, please email us at <air@mit.edu>.  [And yes, yes, we
finally did create a postscript file version of the flyer, which
we will email to any AIRhead who asks.]

1994-05-03      Specific Anti-Wrinkle and Firming Eye Creme

by Alice Shirrell Kaswell

A breakthrough in biochemistry is reported in the September 26,
1994 issue of the research journal "The New Yorker."  An unsigned
paper on page 10 describes "a formula that slips on with a
delicacy that belies its potency."  No clinical data are
presented, but the research involved "special anti-wrinkle and
hydrophilic ingredients" that were found to be "responsive to the
eye area." The work was carried out by Lancome of Paris, working
with "a protein fortified, age-defying formula."  This may also be
of interest to the physics community -- the formula, which has
been given the chemical name "Renergie Eye" or, alternatively,
"Renergie Yeux," is reported to be "from a proven power against
time."


----------------------------------------------
1994-05-04      Advances in Science

"The Air Force is reacting to the EPA ban on CFC's by replacing
them in the cooling systems of the intercontinental (ballistic)
missiles with 2 to 10 nuclear warheads on board.  If they are ever
fired, it will be an environmentally friendly nuclear holocaust,
not threatening the Ozone layer."
    -- Access to Energy, July 1993

(Thanks to Paul Monaghan for bringing this to our attention.)

1994-05-05      Millipede Dimming

by Rodney L. Levine, National institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD

Progress continues apace in the field of millipede research.
Investigator Jack Eden of the research journal "The Washington
Post" presents the following terse summary of his life's work:

     "Continue dimming outdoor house lights to prevent
      millipedes from mating on the lawn."
                 --Washington Post, September 17, 1994, p. E13.

[Note:  Eden does not present details of how he conducted the
experiments, nor of the results that led him to this summary
conclusion.  We will closely monitor his subsequent publications.]

1994-05-06      Hot AIR: Letter of the month

Objectionable Abundance

To the editor:

August et al. et al.'s conclusions on "The Effects of Peanut
Butter on the Rotation of the Earth" (mini-AIR, 1994-00) were
welcome and certainly overdue.

However, you have not published the authors' addresses, a
decidedly unfortunate oversight on your part.  Could you please
send me the addresses for author nos. 34, 36, 56-59, 77, 134, 144,
156, 180, and 195.  Would you also kindly forward the enclosed
mail to author nos. 3, 65, 104, 169, and 198?

Secondarily, I fail to see how this paper could have been
"authored" by these authors (even if some are dead).  Each author
authored 0.085 word.

Please forward my objections to all authors for individual
response.

--Earle Spamer, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphis, PA

1995-06-02      AIRhead News Flashes and Flushes

1. The 1994 Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony was held on October 6.  Once
again, no deaths resulted.  Details, including a list of the
winners, are provided in section 1995-06-03 below.

2. Chances are high that mini-AIR readers will soon be able to
obtain a series of improbably memorable digital images of the must
lurid and scientific sort.  We are also planning, after a fashion,
to have a presence on the World-Wide-Web.  Details on both matters
will be announced in a future issue of mini-AIR.  Acronyms may be
involved;  however, a decision pro or con has not yet been made.

3. Uncontrolled AIRhead proliferation.
Readers continue to respond to our manipulative offer to become an
AIRhead for a Day.  These AIRheads are taking copies of our
attractively appalling flyer, and handing them out or posting them
at meetings and in provocative places.  If you would like to be an
AIRhead, please email us at <air@mit.edu>.  Please specify whether
you want the postscript version or the paper version.  For
ecological reasons, we do not offer plastic.  If you choose paper,
please include your street mailing address.

4. We apologize for the substandard number of typos in the last
issue.

1995-06-03      Announcing: The 1994 The Ig Nobel Prizewinners

On October 6, the winners of this year's Ig Nobel Prizes were
honored, in a fashion, by three Nobel Laureates, 1200 hecklers,
the Norwegian Consul, and a rat control scientist at a tumultuous
ceremony at MIT. The Prizes honor individuals whose achievements
"cannot or should not be reproduced." Five additional Nobel
Laureates (Sidney Altman, David Baltimore, Nicolas Bloembergen,
Jerome Friedman, and Philip Sharp) participated in the Ceremony
with congratulatory tapes and slides.

This was the fourth annual ceremony. Past winners include Los
Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates, who won the 1992 Ig Nobel Peace
Prize for "his uniquely compelling methods of bringing people
together."

The festivities included speeches by three of the new winners --
Dr. Brian Sweeney (Biology), Dr. Robert Lopez (Entomology) and,
via tape recording, Dr. Richard Dart (Medicine). Sweeney and Lopez
had their Prizes -- cheap gold-painted wax half-brains --
personally handed to them by the Nobel Laureates.

The Nobel Laureates -- Richard Roberts ( Physiology or Medicine,
1993), Dudley Herschbach (Chemistry, 1986), and William Lipscomb
(Chemistry, 1976) also each presented a 30-second "Heisenberg
Certainty Lecture." Heisenberg Lectures were also presented by:
Harvard Chemist Cynthia Friend; the father of artificial
intelligence, MIT's Marvin Minsky; astonomer Margaret Geller of
Harvard; and neurophysiology pioneer Jerome Lettvin of MIT.  Those
Heisenberg Certainty lecturers who exceeded the time limit were
thrown from the stage by a referee.

The Nobel Laureates also joined with a five-woman dance group to
perform a brief ballet number, "The Interpretive Dance of the
Electrons," with music from Tchaikovsky's "Nutcracker Suite."

Following is a list of the new Ig Nobellians:

==============================
The 1994 Ig Nobel Prizewinners
==============================

BIOLOGY W. Brian Sweeney, Brian Krafte-Jacobs, Jeffrey W. Britton,
and Wayne Hansen, for their breakthrough study, "The Constipated
Serviceman: Prevalence Among Deployed US Troops," and especially
for their numerical analysis of bowel movement frequency. [The
study was published in "Military Medicine," vol. 158, August,
1993, pages 346-348.]

PEACE John Hagelin of Maharishi University and The Institute of
Science, Technology and Public Policy, promulgator of peaceful
thoughts, for his experimental conclusion that 4,000 trained
meditators caused an 18 percent decrease in violent crime in
Washington, D.C. [Details were published in "Interim Report:
Results fo the National Demonstration Project To Reduce Violent
Crime and Improve Governmental Effectiveness In Washington, D.C.,
June 7 to July 30, 1993," Institute of Science, Technology and
Public Policy, Fairfield, Iowa.]

MEDICINE This prize is awarded in two parts. First, to Patient X,
formerly of the US Marine Corps, valiant victim of a venomous bite
from his pet rattlesnake, for his determined use of electroshock
therapy -- at his own insistence, automobile sparkplug wires were
attached to his lip, and the car engine revved to 3000 rpm for
five minutes. Second, to Dr. Richard C. Dart of the Rocky Mountain
Poison Center and Dr. Richard A. Gustafson of The University of
Arizona Health Sciences Center, for their well-grounded medical
report: "Failure of Electric Shock Treatment for Rattlesnake
Envenomation." [The report was published in "Annals of Emergency
Medicine," vol. 20, no. 6, June 1991, pp. 659-661.]

ENTOMOLOGY Robert A. Lopez of Westport, NY, valiant veterinarian
and friend of all creatures great and small, for his series of
experiments in obtaining ear mites from cats, inserting them into
his own ear, and carefully observing and analyzing the results.
[Dr. Lopez's report was published in "The Journal of the American
Veterinary Society," vol. 203, no. 5, Sept. 1, 1993, pp. 606-607.]

PSYCHOLOGY Lee Kuan Yew, former Prime Minister of Singapore,
practitioner of the psychology of negative reinforcement, for his
thirty-year study of the effects of punishing three million
citizens of Singapore whenever they spat, chewed gum, or fed
pigeons.

PHYSICS The Japanese Meterological Agency, for its seven-year
study of whether earthquakes are caused by catfish wiggling their
tails.

LITERATURE L. Ron Hubbard, ardent author of science fiction and
founding father of Scientology, for his crackling Good Book,
"Dianetics," which is highly profitable to mankind or to a portion
thereof.

CHEMISTRY Texas State Senator Bob Glasgow, wise writer of logical
legislation, for sponsoring the 1989 drug control law which make
it illegal to purchase beakers, flasks, test tubes, or other
laboratory glassware without a permit.

ECONOMICS Jan Pablo Davila of Chile, tireless trader of financial
futures and former employee of the state-owned Codelco Company,
for instructing his computer to "buy" when he meant "sell," and
subsequently attempting to recoup his losses by making
increasingly unprofitable trades that ultimately lost .5 percent
of Chile's gross national product. Davila's relentless achievement
inspired his countrymen to coin a new verb: "to davilar," meaning,
"to botch things up royally."

MATHEMATICIANS The Southern Baptist Church of Alabama,
mathematical measurers of morality, for their county-by-county
estimate of how many Alabama citizens will go to Hell if they
don't repent.

Full details of the 199 Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony, including
photographs and highlights of the acceptance speeches and 30-
second Heisenberg Certainty Lectures, will be presented in
December in the first print issue of The Annals of Inprobable
Research.

1995-06-04      AIRhead Project 2000: preliminary results

As announced in mini-AIR 1994-02-03 (June, 1993), we are compiling
a list of studies, projects, and products that involve the number
two thousand. Randomly selected items from the list include:

Item # 85 (submitted by investigator Peter Martin)
        Sudbury 2000, a plan to diversify the local economy of this
        Northern Ontario town.

Items # 231a and #232b (submitted by investigator David Coderre)
        PS2000 - Canadian federal public service renewal initiative

        Defence2000 - Canadian Dept. of Defence renewal initiative

Item #662 (submitted by investigator Jeremy Marshall)
        Rover 2000 automobile

Item #662 (submitted by investigator Terry Mawby)
        Triumph 2000 automobile

Item #662 (submitted by investigator Jim Larson)
         M&M's covered chocolate candy.  Larson points out that
        while the use of Roman numerals may be quaint,
        no one can deny the focus this product maintains on the
        future.  Using only mid 20th century technology, this
        chocolate treat is able to dissolve in one's mouth while
        remaining completely inert in the hands - surely one of
        the earliest applications of "smart materials."

Item #662 (submitted by investigator David J Walton)
        SimCity 2000, a computer simulation from Maxis

[NOTE: Due to space limitations, we do not indicate here which
listed items are obsolete.  That information is contained in
AIRhead Project 2000 Official Publication #2000FNP/21 (obs.)]

1994-07-02      AIRhead News Flashes and Flushes

1. Many readers pointed out that the October issue of mini-AIR was
mistakenly dated 1995 rather than 1894.  Thank you.

2. Beware...
The very first initial premiere grand commemorative historic
collectible tribute issue of AIR will be appearing on your
doorstep in mid-December, provided that you have remembered to
send in your subscription.  We are holding a special event to mar
the occasion (see section 1994-07-04 below for details).
And why not spread the cheer.  Give Grandma the one holiday gift
she will never forget, no matter how hard she tries.
Give the lady some AIR.

3. AIR home page is coming
Chances are high that mini-AIR readers will soon be able to obtain
a series of improbably memorable digital images of the must lurid
and scientific sort.  Our World Wide Web home page is nearly
ready.  Details will be announced in the next issue of mini-AIR.

4. AIRhead Tours
If your group of 25 or more colleagues, students, or admirers is
coming to Cambridge, you can arrange for a special AIRhead Tour of
The MIT Museum, including the notorious Hacks Collection and a
chance to meet a genuine AIRhead. The tour includes a half hour
slide show/talk on "Improbable Science and the Ig Nobel Prizes."
Phone or e-mail to arrange a tour.

5. Once again, we salute those members of the international
scientific and technical community who arranged the details of
World Standards Day. This year, World Standards Day was October
14.  In the US, the day was marked on October 11.  In Finland,
World Standards Day occurred on October 13.  Italy held its own
standards conference on October 18.

6. AIR is an intensely nonprofit educational activity of The MIT
Museum.  Any generous support you or yours (or someone else's)
might donate in the form of equipment, clerical assistance, or one
of the more widely recognized kinds of sustenance would: (a)
irremediably advance the cause of improbable research and
education; and (b) bring widespread glory, satisfaction and other
desirable states of being.

1994-07-03      Ig Nobel Peace Prize: Follow-up Investigation

Robert L. Park of the American Physical Society (APS) has done a
follow-up investigation of the work which earned John Hagelin this
year's Ig Nobel Peace Prize.  Park's report appeared in his weekly
APS newsletter, "WHAT'S NEW."  It reads in part:

"The [1994 Ig Nobel] Peace Prize went to physicist John Hagelin
for his experiment to reduce crime in Washington, DC by the
coherent meditation of 4,000 TM [Transcendental Meditation]
experts. By coincidence, Hagelin was holding a press conference
[on the day of the Ig Nobel Ceremony] to announce his final
results.  It was a data analysis clinic; violent crime, he proudly
declared, decreased 18%!  Relative to what?  To the predictions of
"time-series analysis" involving variables such as temperature and
the economy.  So although the weekly murder count hit the highest
level ever recorded, it was less than predicted."


------------------------------------------------------------
1994-07-04      Selected Abstracts from AIR vol. 1, no. 1

Following are selected abstracts from vol. 1, no. 1, of The Annals
of Improbable Research (AIR).  For full details, including lurid
photographs and data, see the issue itself.  Additional abstracts
will appear in the next issue of mini-AIR.  Collect the whole set
and amaze your friends and yourself.

"The Taxonomy of Barney," Edward C. Theriot, Arthur E. Bogan, and
Earle E. Spamer.
The authors observed on television an animal which was there
identified as a dinosaur, Barney.  X-ray, cladistic, and
morphological analyses suggest that Barney is a hominid. The
authors note that Barney more closely resembles a dead salmon than
a dinosaur.  [Includes photos and charts]

"The Aerodynamics of Potato Chips," by Scott Sandford, Jim Ross,
Joe Sacco, and Nathaniel Hellerstein.
Potato chips were subjected to a rigorous series of wind-tunnel
tests.  The authors conclude that, "you can throw a potato chip,
just not very far."  Other conclusions are also presented.
[Includes photos and graphs]

"Nobel Thoughts: Sidney Altman," by Marc Abrahams.
The Nobel chemistry Laureate addresses questions about beer and
potato chips. [Includes photo]

"At the Fourth First Annual Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony," by Stephen
Drew and Francesca Thurston.
A complete report on this year's ceremony, featuring citations of
the ten Prizewinning efforts and highlights from the acceptance
speeches and the 30-second Heisenberg Certainty Lectures.
Features 16 photos, including several of the world premiere ballet
"Interpretive Dance of the Electrons" featuring The Nicola Hawkins
Dancers, three Nobel Laureates, and jazz harpist Deborah Henson-
Conant.

"The mickeymouse Gene" (photomicrograph), Timothy P. Angelotti and
Marco A. Scarpetta

"QI of IQ: Quantum Interpretation of The Intelligence Quotient,"
by Dudley Herschbach.
It is hypothesized that intelligence arises from the vibrating
molecules within our brains.  Qualitatively, IQ is directly
proportional to the vibrational amplitude.  The distribution of
IQ's can be explained by a combination of quantum "tunnel
effects," temperature T, and the spring constant K of each
individual's head. [Includes instructive graph]

Each issue includes genuine page numbers.
Other regular features include:

1994-07-05      AIRhead Time Caplet: Exhumation & Interment Contest

To mark the publication of AIR's premiere print issue, the
assembled AIRheads will be unearthing a time caplet, removing the
contents, discarding them, placing new items into the time caplet,
and reburying the apparatus.  The caplet items will epitomize the
concept of "inflated research and personalities."  This is a
shamelessly promotional event designed for the press, and everyone
is welcome to take part.

CAPLET CONTEST
Please e-mail your entry to:   bourbaki@neu.edu
Here is the contest question:
          What/who should be placed into the time caplet
          when we re-bury it?

CONTEST RULES
1. What do you receive if you win?
   Nothing -- this contest was devised by AIRheads.
2. Contest submissions must be brief.  At your option, they
   may be in the form of poetry (caplet couplets).
3. We won't be able to personally reply to the contest
   submissions, but the winners will be honored in a
   future issue of mini-AIR, whether they like it or not.

HOOPLA
Several pieces of outstanding improbable research will also be
presented at the event. Dudley Herschbach of Harvard, 1986 Nobel
Chemistry Laureate, will deliver a five minute lecture based on
his AIR article, "QI of IQ:  A Quantum Interpretation of the
Intelligence Quotient."  Dr. Thomas Michel of Brigham and Women's
Hospital will present his strictures for "Politically Correct
Cardiology."  Other AIRheads will present research of similar
caliber.  Musicians, technicians, architectural historians,
literati, and a poodle will also be in attendance.

ATTENDING THE EVENT
The event will take place at the MIT Museum, on Wednesday,
December 14, at 6:30 pm.  It will be 45 minutes in length, unless
the caplet contents are found to be lethal.  A very limited number
of tickets (they are free!) will be available at the Museum ONLY
the week of the event ONLY ONLY ONLY.  Heckling and picketing are
strongly encouraged.  Lab coats or other appropriate attire are
mandatory.

                energizing formula; Superscent deodorizing formula.

[NOTE: This project continues to gain momentum, a fact for which
we have no explanation.  If you have an explanation, please keep
it to yourself.]

1994-07-07      Science and the Dervish

The Whirling Dervishes of Turkey are currently on a performance
tour of the United States.  Here is extract from the program
booklet given to their audiences.  It was written by Dr. Celaddin
B. Celebi, their master of ceremonies and the grandson of Hz.
Mevlana:

"Contemporary science definitely confirms that the fundamental
condition of our existence is to revolve.  There is no object, no
being that does not revolve and the shared similarity among beings
is the revolution of the electrons and protons in the atoms, which
constitute the structure of the smallest particle to the stars far
in the sky.  As a consequence of thsi similarity, everything
revolves and man carries on his life, his very existence by means
of the revolution in the atoms, structural elements in his body,
by the circulation of his blood, by his coming from the Earth and
return to it, by his revolving with the earth itself."

1994-07-11      Purpose of mini-AIR (*)

The mini-Annals of Improbable Research (mini-AIR) publishes news
about improbable research and ideas. Specifically:

A) Haphazardly selected superficial (but advanced!) extracts of
research news and satire from The Annals of Improbable Research.

B) News about the annual Ig Nobel Prize ceremony.

C) News about other science humor activities intentional and
otherwise.

WHAT IS AIR? (An introduction, of sorts)
AIR is a new magazine produced by the entire former editorial
staff (1955-1994) of "The Journal of Irreproducible Results
(JIR)," the world's oldest satirical science journal. The new
magazine's co-founders are Marc Abrahams, who edited JIR from
1990-1994, and Alexander Kohn, who founded JIR in 1955 and was its
editor until 1989. AIR is published by the MIT Museum in
Cambridge, MA.  The editorial board consists of more than 40
distinguished scientists from around the world including seven
Nobel Laureates. Each October, AIR and the MIT Museum produce the
Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony, honoring people whose achievements cannot
or should not be reproduced.

1994-08-02      AIRhead News Flashes and Flushes

1. In the November issue we reported that many readers had pointed
out that the October issue of mini-AIR was mistakenly dated 1894
rather than 1894.  We apologize for acknowledging our mistake.

2. Time Caplet Update
A time caplet was buried in 1914 by followers of Constant Desiree
Despradelle (1862-1912). The time caplet was coated with a special
anti-aging cream.  On December 14, 1994, five Nobel Laureates and
their acolytes will unearth & rebury the time caplet.  The event
is growing in scale, pomp and verisimilitude (see section 1994-08-
04, 1994-08-05, and 1994-08-06 below for details).  This gala no-
questions-asked occurrence will mar the publication of the first
issue of AIR.  A copy of this valued Collectible Issue will appear
in your home or that of a loved one within the next few weeks,
provided that you have remembered to send in your subscription.
(See section 1994-08-16 below for details).

C. AIR home page is still coming
Our World Wide Web home page is patently pending.  Our Global
Village Idiot, Amy Gorin, assures us that January will be the
month when we reveal this home page. It will contain, among other
data, an X-ray image from our research project on "The Taxonomy of
Barney."  Details will be announced.

5. We have nearly completed construction of the official MIT
Museum Public High-Vacuum Toilet Facility (there are only three
public restrooms in Cambridge). It features six opto-electronic
multimedia functions, including a data bank of 250 tatoos.  The
number will be increased as soon as the Internet drop is
installed.  Please stop by and try it.

6. Acting on a tip from a reader in Hong Kong, we have obtained a
cache of slide rules. (See section 1994-08-12 below for details.)


------------------------------------------------------------
1994-08-03      Sad News: Alexander Kohn Has Passed Away

Last week Alexander Kohn died.  Alex was the co-founder and
editorial board chairman of AIR.  In 1955, together with Harry
Lipkin, he founded The Journal of Irreproducible Results, of which
he was editor until 1989, and editor emeritus until this year,
when we all left that magazine to create AIR.  By day, Alex was an
eminent virologist at Tel Aviv Medical School.  By evening, he was
a scholar of the history of scientific fraud.  At night, often in
the guise of Dr. X. Perry Mental, Alex produced some of the
funniest and most literate commentaries, parodies and satires ever
written.  In coming months, AIR will reprint some of Alex's (and
X.P. Mental's) best articles.  Alex was loved and admired by many
people in many places.  Anyone who has read his work, and
especially those of us who were lucky enough to know him
personally, will miss Alex terribly.
                -- Marc Abrahams


------------------------------------------------------------
1994-08-04      Vos Savant Slated to Sip Soup at Ceremony

AIR editorial board member Marilyn Vos Savant, possessor of the
world's highest IQ, will be present at the ceremony, eating soup.
At the conclusion of the ceremony, Ms. Vos Savant will hand out
crackers to all audience members who desire them.


------------------------------------------------------------
1994-08-05      Robin Leach / Rich & Famous / Food

Robin Leach, host of the noted science television programs
"Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous" and "Robin Leach Talking Food,"
has created and sent us a special videotape (duration: 43 seconds)
and two other items for entombment in the Time Caplet.  We do not
know why.


------------------------------------------------------------
1994-08-06      AIRhead Time Caplet Contest Winners, etc.

CAPLET CONTEST WINNERS
Our contest was to determine "What/who should be placed into the
time caplet when we re-bury it?"  A frighteningly large number of
readers felt compelled to submit entries.  Winners will receive
nothing, because this contest was devised by AIRheads.  However,
their names and winning entries will be included in the AIR home
page; space does not permit its inclusion here.  One of the
winning items, submitted by reader Donald Turnblade, represents
the Internet: it is a half naked Barbie doll with fiber optic
cables instead of doll hair.

RESEARCH MINI-PRESENTATIONS
Several pieces of outstanding improbable research will be mini-
presented at the event:
        "Politically Correct Cardiology."
        "QI of IQ:  A Quantum Interpretation of the Intelligence
                Quotient."
        "The Taxonomy of Barney"

ATTENDING THE EVENT
The event will take place at the MIT Museum, on Wednesday,
December 14, at 6:30 pm. For details on attending the event, see
section 1994-08-13.)


------------------------------------------------------------
1994-08-07      Further Selected Abstracts from AIR vol. 1, no. 1

Following are further selected abstracts from vol. 1, no. 1, of
The Annals of Improbable Research (AIR).  For full details,
including lurid photographs and data, see the issue itself.

"The Paradigm Paradox," Bill Schweber.
The word "paradox" has appeared frequently in the standard
literature since its use in a 1965 book by Thomas Kuhn.
Occurrences are tracked year by year, and presented in chart form.
Literature citations of the word (known as "citings of sightings")
have decreased by 75% during the past year.

"Einstein's Shoes" (poem), by Heather Rypkema.
"I would not live in Einstein's Shoes, despite his noted name./
For as I walked, each shoe would move in someone else's reference
frame..."  The author pursues this thought and reaches a logical
conclusion.

Sleep Research Update (who is sleeping with whom in the lab)

Scheduled UFO Appearances

"The Pop-Up Medical Thermometer," by Stephen Drew.
The pop-up medical thermometer is inserted into the skin or into
existing body apertures. The inner cylinder pops up when the
patient's fever subsides, indicating that it is time for the
patient to go home. The technology was originally developed for
the poultry industry.  This is its first application to
biomedicine. [Includes photo]

"Book Review: The Nairobi Telephone Directory," by Tim Healey.
This reference work has been deliberately constructed so as to
encourage the contemplative life. Some, but by no means all, names
are listed by forename rather than surname. Alphabetical order is
enhanced in new ways (A,B,C,D,E,S,E,M,E,F,G,...). The Classified
Section headings invoke long chains of "see also" references,
often ending with nonexistent sections.


------------------------------------------------------------
1994-08-08      AIRhead Project 2000: preliminary results

As announced in mini-AIR 1994-02-03 (June, 1993), we are compiling

1994-08-09      Ancient Rocketry?

Dervishes Not the Only Scientific Pioneers in Turkey

by Bill Higgins
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, IL

mini-AIR 1994-07 (Nov. 94) mentioned[1] a Turkish scholar[3] named
Dr. Celaddin B. Celebi, who explained the significance to physics
of the Whirling Dervishes: "Contemporary science definitely
confirms that the fundamental condition of our existence is to
revolve."  His name rang a bell, so I went scampering for my
history references.  Could he be a relative of a seventeenth-
century commentator, Evilya Chelebi?

An issue of "Aerospace Historian" (Fall/September 1988) had
"Birdmen of the Middle East:  Early Attempts at Human Flight," by
Gary Leiser, a USAF historian specializing in Islamic history.
Leiser quotes, and so will I, from a seventeenth-century account
by Evilya Chelebi.  This supposedly happened around 1633 in
Istanbul.  (Native speakers, please pardon my slaughter of the
transliterations!)

"This Lagari Hasan had fabricated a seven-cylinder rocket using 50
okkas [about 64 kg] of gunpowder compound.  When the Sultan was at
Saray Point, he got on the rocket and his apprentices lit the fuse
of the rocket. Saying, 'My Sultan, I have recommended you to God.
I am going to speak with the Prophet Jesus,' and, praising and
glorifying God, he made his ascent to the highest heaven... At the
roof of the heavens, the powder of the great rocket was exhausted
and when it descended toward the earth, he opened the eagle wings
that he had in his hands and landed in the water in front of the
mansion of Sinan Pasha.  He swam from there and came naked to the
Sultan. He kissed the ground and began to joke, saying. 'My
Sultan, the Prophet Jesus sends you his regards.'"

Leiser doesn't believe a word of this, but he says, "Evilya's
account does show that the Turks had the ability to make large
rockets, that some Turks had contemplated human flight by means of
rockets as early as the seventeenth century, and that they may
have even experimented with such a flight."


EDITOR'S NOTE:

1. One incensed reader[2] sent us a letter objecting, in highly
colorful, ethnically oriented language, to the original report,
which was a verbatim quotation from a Turkish ethnomusicologist.
This reader informed us that we should not identify any reports
concerning improbable research from Turkey as being from Turkey.

2. No pun intended.

3. We were unable to identify the nationality of this researcher.

1994-08-12      Slide Rule Surprise

We have obtained a stash of genuine 12" slide rules.  They are
logarithmic in nature. They can be ordered via email
(mitshop@mit.edu) or telephone (617-253-4462).  The price is
$19.95 plus $4.50 shipping/handling.  The primary use of this
instrument is to produce the following speech from your father,
the engineer:
   "When I was your age, we didn't have one of them fancy-ass
   computers, we had to do all the calculations by hand, and
   I'll bet you don't even know what the square root of 369.72 is,
   but I can find it using this here stick, you see, now how was
   it these things worked anyway, you are supposed to line up, uh,
   something and something else, uh, well, we were real engineers
   back then, I tell you."
Don't say you weren't warned.

------------------------------------------------------------
1995-01-02      AIRhead News Flashes and Flushes

A. There was an error in last issue's notice concerning higher-
level communications.  The correct Internet address for God ends
in .ORG, not .GOV

B. On this, day 91 of the Official AIRhead Slogans Competition,
the leading contender for AIR's official German-language slogan is
"Luft, luft, nichts als is luft."  Entries for any of the
languages should be e-mailed to BOURBAKI@NEU.EDU   As stated
previously: [1] we reserve the right to ignore all entries in
languages for which we do not readily have translators;  and [2]
we reserve the right to ignore all entries in languages for which
we do have translators.

C. Home, home (page) on the AIR
On Tuesday, January 17, the AIR home page on the World Wide Web
will be ready for your improbable reading pleasure.  This
delightful academically deviant work is called "Hot AIR."  An
ever-changing kaleidoscopic cornucopia of delights, it [probably]
contains such useful data as: an X-ray image from our research
project on "The Taxonomy of Barney;" images from various Ig Nobel
Prize ceremonies; exhibits from The Museum of Burnt Food; the
complete ancient archives of mini-AIR ("Stale mini-AIR"); photos
from the AIRhead Time Caplet ceremony, and more.
The URL is:
http://web.mit.edu/afs/athena/org/i/improb/www/home.html

D. The definition in mini-AIR 1994-10 that "an acre is the amount
of land that an ox can plow under one man in one day" was
misleading, if not inaccurate.

E. The official first premiere commemorative etcetera print issue
of AIR is now off the presses.  It is therefore hot.  Our AIRhead
printer printed a not overly large quantity of extra copies of
this historic first etcetera print issue.  Therefore, shrewd
individuals who subscribe to AIR before this little treasure trove
runs out will receive the premiere etcetera issue as the first of
their subscription.  Hurry hurry hurry, for your children's sake
and so forth.

F. On advice of counsel, we will not, after all, be publishing Lee
L. Franklin's treatise on "Obesity Among Feminist Economists:
Every Tub on its Own Bottom."

G. Because AIR is still so new, fresh, and partially gaseous, we
are unknown to the world at large.  Please help us change that.
If you know of specific publications (newspapers, magazines, etc.)
that might like to write about AIR, please tell us the pertinent
info (name of the publication, mail and e-mail addresses, phone
number).  Names of specific reporters/editors are especially
helpful.


------------------------------------------------------------
1995-01-03      Valentine's Day AIRhead Chocolate Gender Survey

In honor of Valentine's Day, we are conducting a survey of gender
preferences for dark chocolate and light chocolate.

Votes can be cast by visiting the Hot AIR home page on the World
Wide Web (See section 1995-01-02).

Alternatively, please clip the following ballot, fill it out, and
e-mail your data to:  BOURBAKI@NEU.EDU

____MY GENDER IS: FEMALE
____MY GENDER IS: MALE

____I PREFER DARK CHOCOLATE
____I PREFER MILK CHOCOLATE

NOTES

1. Due to reasons, we cannot acknowledge receipt of individual
data submissions.

2. If you don't like chocolate, tough.


------------------------------------------------------------
1995-01-04      Correction: Mass Murderer Accreditation

The survey presented in mini-AIR 1994-12 contains data and/or
conclusions that may be invalid.  The research grant money was
withdrawn during the final stages of analysis, skewing both the
results and the researchers.  Particularly suspect is the chapter
reproduced here:

     VOTING PREFERENCES OF MASS MURDERERS
     WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE 1994 US NATIONAL ELECTIONS

     82% voted Republican
      7% voted Democratic
     11% voted for themselves


------------------------------------------------------------
1995-01-05      More Skinny on Internet Barbie

Many readers requested that we publish the full text of Donald
Turnblade's essay for the AIRhead Time Caplet Interment Contest.
Our contest was to determine "What/who should be placed into the
Time Caplet?"  The contest winners received nothing, as this
contest was devised by AIRheads.  However, their names and winning
essays are included in the AIR home page.  The home page also
contains a separate list of items that were actually buried in the
Time Caplet.

Donald Turnblade's essay:
        "I propose that a symbol embodying
        the properties of the Internet be enclosed
        in the proposed time capsule.  It should represent
        the interconnected-ness of the Internet, the human
        nature of the inhabitance of the Internet, the
        character of Internet communications, and the intellect
        of the Internet.  Therefore, a half naked Barbie doll
        with fiber optic cables instead of doll hair would
        represent things fairly well."


------------------------------------------------------------
1995-01-06      AIRhead Project 2000: preliminary results

-----------------------------------------------------------
1995-01-07      Ig Nobel Interlopers!!!

Several of the Nobel Laureates warned us that this would happen.

We were shocked, shocked to discover that a lobbying group in
Washington, DC has issued a press release announcing that it has
chosen the winners of the Ig Nobel Prizes.

The group is called "Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine
(PCRM)."  Neither AIR nor the Ig Nobel Board of Governors had any
previous knowledge of the group. In short, we AIRheads have no
connection with any would-be AIRheads in Washington.

While we sympathize to some extent with PCRM's underlying
sentiments (for example: we no longer advocate that monkeys be
forced to become crack cocaine addicts), we cannot permit this
group to appropriate the good name of the Ig Nobel Prizes.  We
must We must protect the purity and essence of the genuine Ig
Nobel Prizewinners.

It seems unthinkable that a group called the "Physicians Committee
for Responsible Medicine" would knowingly commit an irresponsible
act.  Yet, it has oft been observed that we live is an imperfect
universe.

The misappropriation of the name "Ig Nobel Prize" has already
begun to cause confusion and consternation -- we first learned
about it via a perplexed phone call from a magazine editor.
Anything you can do to help get the word out would be appreciated
by AIRheads everywhere.

ADDENDUM:  Perhaps you have an opinion as to whether this
unauthorized use of the phrase "Ig Nobel Prize" was a responsible
act on the part of the "Physicians Committee for Responsible
Medicine."  If you wish to make them aware of your opinion, you
can telephone them at 202-686-2210 or fax them at 202-686-2216 or
mail polite letters to them at 5100 Wisconsin Avenue NW,
Washington, DC  20016.

1995-01-11      Teachers' Guide

[We might repeat this section in future issues.  Then again, we
might not.  Please pass it on to any teacher friend who would find
it useful.]

Three out of five teachers agree: curiosity is a dangerous thing,
especially in students.  If you are one of the other two teachers,
AIR and mini-AIR can be powerful tools.  Choose your favorite
hAIR-raising article and give copies to your students.  The
approach is simple.  The scientist thinks that he (or she, or
whatever), of all people, has discovered something about how the
universe behaves.  So:

* Is this scientist right -- and what does "right" mean, anyway?
* Can you think of even one different explanation that works
  as well or better?
* Did the test really, really, truly, unquestionably, completely
  test what the author thought he was testing?
* Is the scientist ruthlessly honest with himself about how well
  his idea explains everything, or could he be suffering from
  wishful thinking?

Kids are naturally good scientists.  Help them stay that way.

1995-01-12      WHAT IS AIR? (*)

AIR is a new magazine produced by the entire former editorial
staff (1955-1994) of "The Journal of Irreproducible Results."  The
new magazine's co-founders are Marc Abrahams, who edited The
Journal from 1990-1994, and Alexander Kohn, who founded The
Journal in 1955 and was its editor until 1989.  AIR is published
by the MIT Museum in Cambridge, MA.  The editorial board consists
of more than 40 distinguished scientists from around the world
including seven Nobel Laureates.  Each October, AIR and the MIT
Museum produce the Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony, honoring people whose
achievements cannot or should not be reproduced.

1995-02-02      AIRhead News Flashes and Flushes

A.  The official AIRhead German language slogan, "Luft, luft,
nichts als luft," which was announced in mini-AIR 1995-01, has
become the source of disputatious consternation.  A typographical
error, compounded by the obscurity of the quotation source,
infuriated or inspired many readers, especially Dr. W-------f from
Munich, who kindly mailed us an autographed sixteen volume set of
his German grammar textbooks.  Our thanks to him.

B.  A photograph of the Pop-Up Medical Thermometer is featured as
this month's new poster in Hot AIR, our WWW home page.  The
thermometer, described in detail in AIR 1:1, is a prime example of
technology transfer (in this case, from the poultry industry).

C.  We are in dire need of interns, volunteers, and lost souls to
assist the editor.  If you within driving distance of the MIT
Museum, have a few spare hours a month, and would like to impose
your mark on science history and yourself on the editor, please
contact us.

D.  The Gallery of Bearded Men, our project to document nature's
full range of bearded men, is now accepting photographs.  The
Gallery will eventually go on display in our WWW home page, and
will become the subject of a scholarly analysis in AIR itself.
All bearded men whose photos are included in the Gallery will be
invited to be part of the official Bearded Men delegation to this
October's Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony.

C.  We are preparing a report on Improbable Research at Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory.  This will be the first in a chronic
series of reports devoted to improbable research at the world's
great scientific and medical institutions.  Each report will be
accompanied by a review of the cafeteria.

B.  The second issue of AIR will be emerging from our subterranian
printing press later this month.  In response to questions from
several (proudly) confused readers, let us clarify that:  Yes, the
continuing existence of AIR and mini-AIR depends entirely on paid
subscriptions to AIR.  We hope you will subscribe, for the sake of
future generations.

A.  A special thank you to the gentleman at CERN in Geneva who
shipped us his collection of autographed socks from members of the
European physics community.

B. Please be assured that we DO read all of our incoming
correspondence.  However, the amount we receive far surpasses our
ability to send replies.  If you really, really need a response,
please so indicate thank you very much yes indeed and please
accept our humble apologies sorry about that chief.

1995-02-03      Valentine's Chocolate Survey: Phase I Results

1088 people participated in Phase I of the 1995 AIR St Valentine's
chocolate survey. We would like to thank each and every one of you
- especially those who were kind enough to vote more than once.

73.27% of respondents were male; 25.42% were female; 1.03% could
not or would not reveal their gender; 0.28% claimed to be both.

AGGREGATE PREFERENCES
62.34% prefer dark chocolate, 33.37% prefer milk chocolate, 1.03%
voted for white chocolate, 1.78% were undecided.  In addition,
there was one vote each for light turkey, light beer, dark beer,
marzipan and chocolate licorice.  One person preferred the white
chocolate in the form of a bunny.  Two votes were of the X-rated
variety. The answer "yes" was given twice.

We also received one Haiku.

There was one person who reported being born on Valentine's Day,
and one person who reported being lactose intolerant and who
considers milk chocolate to be the spawn of Satan.  Seven people
pointed out that we confused sex with gender and one gave the
following reference: "Miss Manners' Guide for the Turn of the
Millenium," by Judith Martin, page 192.  One person suggested an
age factor be brought into the study, and two people recommended
we examine the gender of the chocolate, i.e. with or without nuts.

As you may have noticed, we added white chocolate into the survey
even though it was omitted from the original questionaire.  This
was suggested by a number of individuals, not all of whom voted
for white chocolate.  On the other hand, we recieved the following
comment "White chocolate is an aberrant albino abomination which
I'm glad to see you're ignoring."

The detailed results of Phase I:

FEMALES
64.34% preferred dark chocolate
31.25% went for milk
01.10% for white chocolate
01.84% split their vote in favor of a dark milk chocolate
00.64% were undecided or other

MALES
62.37% preferred dark chocolate
34.31% preferred milk chocolate
01.02% preferred white chocolate
10.2%  split for dark milk
00.64% were undecided or other

HERMAPHRODITES
66.67% went for dark chocolate
33.33% chose milk chocolate

UNKNOWN/OTHER
9.09% went for dark and milk respectively
27.27% opted for dark milk
54.44% were undecided or other

We leave it to educated readers to perform their own chi-square
tests.

Phase II of the survey is being conducted by ABC-TV's World News
Now program, and on a continuing basis via our WWW home page.
Results will be reported in a future issue of mini-AIR.

1995-02-04      Selected Abstracts from AIR 1:2

Selected abstract from articles published in the March/April 1995
issue (vol. 1, no. 2) of The Annals of Improbable Research.  For
details and accompanying photographs and data, see the issue
itself.

"Effectiveness of Chinese Fortune Cookies, " by Robert Feldman.
The author conducted experiments to determine the effectiveness of
Chinese fortune cookies at predicting the future.  The results
were conclusive, and unexpected.

"Xerox Enlargement Microscopy (XEM)," by David P. Cann and Phillip
Pruna.  A revolutionary new microscopy technique makes it possible
to achieve subatomic resolution levels by using standard copying
machines. The process consists of iterative enlargements of
enlargements.  The authors present several examples, including a
15,392 magnification image of ferroelectric barium titanate and a
1,367,481 X image of a deuterium ion.

"The Dead in the Classroom," by Stephen Rushen.  To an early
morning freshman economics class of thirty live students, fifteen
dead students were added.  Performance of both live and dead
students was observed through the course of the semester.  Data
are presented in the categories of:  attendance; behavior;
participation; and exam scores.  In three of the four areas, the
dead students' performance was the equal of, if not superior to,
that of their living peers.

"Cindy Crawford Discovers," a new regular column written by Alice
Shirrell Kaswell.  Kaswell reports on the scientific efforts and
achievements of supermodel Cindy Crawford and her ilk, as
documented in published works in the research journals "Vogue,"
"Cosmopolitan," "Elle," etc.  This premiere column concerns
certain of Cindy Crawford's recent discoveries in chemistry, and
more.

1995-02-05      In re L. Ron Hubbard

We recently received this letter, dated 2/1/95, concerning a
recent Ig Nobel Prizewinner.  The letter is reproduced here in its
entirety:

"I recently learned that L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of
Scientology, received an 'award' from the Annals of Improbable
Research and the MIT Museum last October.

"Few men in history have had so positive an influence upon the
lives of others through their writings as has L. Ron Hubbard.

"Millions of individual men and women have achieved greater
abilities, success and happiness through his work.

"Because of this workability in improving the lives of others L.
Ron Hubbard's books have been published in 32 languages and
distributed in 103 countries.  To date, his works have sold a
total of 116,000,000 copies, making him one of the most acclaimed
and widely read authors of all time.

"For more information on his works readers can feel free to
personally contact me by correspondence to The Church of
Scientology, 448 Beacon Street, Boston, MA 02115 or phone me at
617-266-9500."

        Sincerely,
        Kit Finn
        Community Services Director
        Church of Scientology

1995-02-06      'Studmuffins of Science' Calendar

by Karen Hopkin

Attention, afficionados of the academic Adonis. The curators of
the all-new Studmuffuns of Science Calendar seek photos and
biographical blurbs on the hottest young scientists from
astrophysics to zoology.  Designed to give female students and
faculty members something to ogle while they run their gels or
prepare their grants, the calendar will feature a dozen of the
smartest and sexiest science studs around.  We'll show these
brainy boys at work and at play... and reveal their intimate
secrets... their favorite board games, bacterial media, ftp sites,
and pasta recipes.

Nominate yourself.  Nominate your chairman.  Nominate the poor
unsuspecting slob slaving away at the lab bench next to you.
Remember, if you have a Y chromosome and a PhD, you could be Dr.
December.

We anxiously await your entries.  Please send calendar candidate
photos to:  Studmuffins of Science Calendar, c/o Karen Hopkin,
Producer, Talk of the Nation: Science Friday, WNYC Radio, One
Centre Street, New York, NY 10007 or c/o The Annals of Improbable
Research (address given below).  If you have any recommendations
or would be interested in getting your hands on a copy of the
steamiest science calender ever conceived, drop us a line at
khopkin@npr.org.

        clams, etc.) shack on route 24 in Swansboro, NC,
        run by a nice guy named Bobby.

ITEM # 407 (Contributed by investigator Dudley A. Horque)
        "Towards 2000."  Predecessor to the Australian television

-----------------------------------------------------------
1995-02-09      May We Recommend...

Research reports that merit a trip to the library:

"Cannabis in the Ear--the Legal Aspects," by S.R. Saeed, M.S.
Timms, and T. J. Woolford, "Journal of Laryngology & Otology,"
vol. 107, no. 10, 1993, p. 979.  (Thanks to John Carne for
bringing this to our attention.)

"Optimal Replacement of GMC Bus Engines: An Empirical Model of
Harold Zurcher," by John Rust, "Econometrica," vol. 55, no. 5,
Sept. 1987.  The research concerns the replacement of internal
combustion engines, not of Mr. Zurcher.  The author's name is
apparently genuine.  [NOTE: This paper won the 1992 Frisch medal
given by the Econometric Society, announced on p. 1443 of the Nov.
1992 issue of "Econometrica," vol. 60, no. 6, Nov. 1992, p. 1443.
(Thanks to Arthur Lewbel for bringing this to our attention.)

"Data manipulation: Dr. Factifuge Meets the Three Stooges," by
P.F. Dillon, "Perspectives in Biology and Medicine," vol. 33,
1990, pp. 231-236.  The paper concerns how to deal with a changing
baseline.  (Thanks to Joe Clark for bringing this to our
attention.)

(We welcome your suggestions for this column.  Please include full
citations. If possible, please send us a photocopy of the paper.)

The Annals of Improbable Research (AIR) is a splendid educational
magazine produced by the entire former editorial staff (1955-1994)
of "The Journal of Irreproducible Results."  AIR's co-founders are
Marc Abrahams, who edited the Journal from 1990-1994, and
Alexander Kohn, who founded the Journal in 1955 and was its editor
until 1989.  AIR is published by the MIT Museum in Cambridge, MA.
The editorial board consists of more than 40 distinguished
scientists from around the world including seven Nobel Laureates
and a convicted felon.  Each October, AIR produces the Ig Nobel
Prize Ceremony at MIT, honoring people whose achievements cannot
or should not be reproduced.

<H2>Some Recent Papers </H2>
<UL>
<LI>  <a href="91.ps.Z">
Gluino Condensation in F-theory,
hep-th/9606091</a>
</ul>
Coupling of bilinears of gauginos on D-branes to anti-symmetric tensor
fields can be deduced by comparing F-theory compactified to 8 dimensions
with the heterotic string on $R^8\times T^2$. Application to SUSY breaking
in F-theory triggered by gaugino condensation is discussed. Compactification
to four dimensions with a warp factor is briefly discussed. In this case
some 3-branes whose world-volume coincides with the open spacetime must 
be introduced, in addition to 7-branes.
<p>
<ul>
<LI>  <a href="41.ps.Z">
D-Brane Realization of $\CN=2$ Super Yang-Mills Theory in Four Dimensions,
hep-th/9604041</a>
</ul>
We develop and study a D-brane realization of
4D  N=2 super Yang-Mills theory.
It is a type IIB string theory compactified on R^6\times K3 and
containing parallel 7-branes.
It can also be regarded as
a subsector of Vafa's F-theory compactified on K3\times K3 and is
thus dual to the heterotic string on K3\times T^2.
We show that the one-loop prepotential in this gauge theory is
exactly equal to the interaction produced by classical closed string exchange.
A monopole configuration corresponds to an open Dirichlet 5-brane
wrapping around $K3$ with ends attached to two 7-branes.
<p>
<UL>
<LI>  <a href="dbl.ps.Z">
Dirichlet Boundary State in Linear Dilaton Background, 
hep-th/9512042</a>
</ul>
Dirichlet-branes have emerged as important objects in studying
nonperturbative string theory. It is important to generalize these objects
to more general backgrounds other than the usual flat background. The simplest
case is the linear dilaton condensate. The usual Dirichlet boundary
condition violates conformal invariance in such a background. We show
that by switching on a certain boundary interaction, conformal invariance
is restored. An immediate application of this result is to
two dimensional string theory.
<p>
<UL>
<LI>  <a href="dybrane.ps.Z">
Boundary States of D-Branes and Dy-Strings, 
hep-th/9510161</a>
</ul>
Polchinski's recent construction of Dirichlet-branes of R-R charges,
together with Witten's mechanism for forming bound states of both 
NS-NS charges and R-R charges, provides a rigorous method to treat 
these dy-branes. We construct the massless sector of boundary
states of D-branes, as well as of dy-strings of charges (p,1).
As a consequence, the string tension formula predicted by duality
in the type IIB theory is obtained.
<p>
<UL>
<LI>  <a href="quench.ps.Z">
Quenched Two Dimensional Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory, 
hep-th/9506063</a>
</ul>
An one dimensional supersymmetric matrix model is obtained by quenching
the 2D SYM. This model will likely be solved in the large N limit. We
also propose an extended supersymmetric matrix model where large N 
solution can be readily obtained.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>  <a href="leg1.ps.Z">
Doubling of Scattering Phase Shifts for Two Dimensional Strings, 
hep-th/9504091</a>
</ul>
With Antal Jevicki and Tamiaki Yoneya, we discuss the origin of the leg
factor in 2D string theory. Longitudinal oscillating modes are shown
to be responsible for the doubling of time delay in scattering off the
Liouville wall. We are planning to study related issues in the black
hole background. Better understanding of these stringy phenomena will
ultimately lead us to a better understanding of a fundamental formulation
of string theory.
<P>
<UL>

<LI>  <a href="super.ps.Z">
Large N Solution of the 2D Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory,
hep-th/9503033</a>
</ul>
We study loop equations in this theory. With an assumption, these equations
are solved in the large N limit. This paper is meant to initiate a
program of studying the super-gauge theory. We are currently studying
other aspects of this theory. Generalization to higher dimensional
models is also under consideration.

<h1>AR 380-5 Appendix H Classified Document and Materiel Storage</h1>

<h2>Standards and Information</h2>

<h3>AR 380-5 Section I<br> Minimum Class A, B, and C Vault
Construction Standards</h3>

<h4>AR 380-5 H-1. Consolidated masonry vault specifications</h4> 
These
specifications are given in table H-1.<hr>

<b>Legend:</b> RC = Reinforced concrete; C = Concrete without
reinforcement<br> </center> 
<p> 
<b>Notes:</b> <ol> 
<li> All concrete used in vault construction will be monolithic cast
in place, Class A, conforming to US Army Corps of Engineers Specification C.E.  204
(minimum compressive strength of 3000 psi after 28 days of
aging). Reinforcing will be by minimum 5/8-inch diameter steel rein-
forcing bars (rebars) laid a maximum of 6 inches on centers, creating
a cross-hatched steel curtain, to be sandwiched at half thickness of
the concrete, parallel to the longest surface.  Rebars will be
anchored or imbedded in all contiguous walls/surfaces.  <li> Class B
vault walls will be constructed of masonry at least 8 inches thick,
such as brick or concrete block employing adequate bond. Hollow
masonry, only of the vertical cell (load bearing) type, can also be
used, but if used, each cell will have from ceiling to floor 1/2-inch
diame- ter or larger rebar inserted, and then be filled with pea
gravel and Portland cement grout.  Rebars will be anchored in both
floor and ceiling to a depth of at least 4 inches. In seismic areas,
6-inch or thicker RC will be required.  <li> Class C vault walls will
be constructed of thick-shell concrete block or vertical cell clay
tile and be not less than 8 inches thick. In seismic areas, 6-inch or
thicker RC will be used.  </ol> <hr> <h4>AR 380-5 H-2. Lightweight
alternate Class A vault specifications</h4> Interim lightweight
alternate class A and B vault specifications (for use above ground
level only). Where building structural design factors preclude the use
of a standard class A or B vault design at above ground level
locations, a modular vault-ASTM type I, U.L. class-M approved under
ANSI/UL Standard 608, dated 27 June 1983 or later, may be used. Until
final testing of this product is completed, it will not be used in
lieu of the conventional designed vaults, at or below grade. Existing
steel lined rooms, built to previously approved specifications, will
continue to be approved for use, but further construction of steel
liners will be deferred in favor of the above specified ANSI/UL
Standard 608 product.  <p> <h4>AR 380-5 H-3. Doors for both methods of
vault construction</h4> The vault will be equipped with an approved
vault door of the type presently listed on the Federal Supply
Schedule. The Class 5 vault door will be used with reinforced concrete
vaults. Where weight of construction is a factor and a steel-lined
vault is used, a Class 6 vault door may be used, if
obtainable. Normally, a vault should have only one entrance. When a
vault exceeds 1,000 square feet of floor space or has more than eight
occupants, it should have a minimum of two exits (one of which will be
the entrance) for safety purposes. When more than one entrance is
required, each must be equipped with the approved door, but only one
door will be used for normal access. The use of a vault door for
controlling movement into and out of a facility is not authorized as
this continued use will create undue wear on the door and will
eventually weaken the locking mechanism and cause malfunctioning.
Therefore, a vestibule should be constructed at the entrance with an
access door to achieve control when the vault door is open.  Where
building codes require that the vault entrance meet a specified fire
rating, the vestibule and its access door must be of the required fire
rating. Where permissible, the vault door optional day gate may be
employed as the entrance control in lieu of the above vestibule. There
will be no windows in a vault, and all ventilator openings or other
access routes into the vault will be properly treated to deny
unauthorized access. Sound attenuation will be fully employed and
where inadequate, white noise masking will be added to prevent
classified discussions from being overheard.  <p> <h4>AR 380-5
H-4. Additional security safeguards for vaults</h4> All vaults
designated Class A or B will have intrusion and fire protection. In
addition, when a vault is unattended, the areas contiguous to such
vault will be supervised either by frequent routine guard patrols or
electronic means so as to increase the depth of security and to allow
early detection of trespass.  Detection of trespass outside the vault
is preferred to detection of vault penetration, since response to the
former should preclude the latter. Detection systems that indicate
attempted penetration (such as vibration sensors) are acceptable,
provided they allow adequate response time before actual barrier
violation.  <p> <h4>AR 380-5 H-5. Security assistance</h4> If
requested in writing, additional technical advice and guidance
relative to vault security problems, may be obtained from the
Commander, Intelligence Materiel Activity (IMA), ATTN: AMXIM-PS, Fort
Meade, MD 20755.

<p> <h3>AR 380-5 Section II<br> Security Upgrading Via
Construction-Buildings, Offices, and Rooms</h3> <p> <h4>AR 380-5
H-6. Approved standards for security upgrading</h4> The following
guidance is offered as a norm against which-
 a. To evaluate the adequacy of existing structural security
safeguards.
 b. To provide security guidance for new construction in areas which
will contain activities and material of foreign intelligence interest.
<p> <h4>AR 380-5 H-7. Hardware</h4> Heavy-duty builder's hardware
should be used in construction, and all screws, nuts, bolts, hasps,
clamps, bars, 2-inch-square mesh of No. 11 wire, 18-gauge expanded
metal screen, hinges, pins, etc., should be securely fastened to
preclude surreptitious removal and ensure visual evidence of
tampering. Hardware accessible from outside the area should be peened,
pinned, brazed, or tack-welded to preclude removal. The term
""2-inch-square mesh of No. 11 wire,'' which meets the requirements of
Federal Specification RR-F-191d, 17 June 1965, hereinafter shall be
referred to as ""wire mesh.''  <p> <h4>AR 380-5 H-8. Interior
walls</h4> Construction should be plaster, gypsum wallboard, metal
panels, hardboard, wood, plywood, or other opaque materials offering
similar resistance to, and evidence of, unauthorized entry into the
area. If insert-type panels are used, a method should be devised to
prevent the removal of such panels without leaving visual evidence of
tampering. Area barriers up to a height of 8 feet should be of opaque
or translucent construction where visual access is a factor. If visual
access is not a factor, the area barrier walls may be of wire mesh or
other nonopaque material offering similar resistance to, and evidence
of, unauthorized entry into the area.  <p> <h4>AR 380-5
H-9. Windows</h4> Window openings 18 feet or less from an access point
(for example, another window outside the area, roof, ledge, door, and
so forth) should be fitted with 1/2-inch bars (separated by no more
than 6 inches), plus crossbars to prevent spreading, or 18-gauge
expanded metal screen, or wire mesh securely fastened on the
inside. When visual access is a factor, the windows should be kept
closed and locked at all times, and also should be made translucent or
opaque by any practical method such as painting or covering the inside
of the glass. During nonduty hours the windows should be closed and
securely fastened to preclude surreptitious removal of classified
material.

<p> <h4>AR 380-5 H-10. Doors</h4> Doors should be substantially
constructed of wood or metal. When windows, panels, or similar
openings are used in the door, they should be secured with 18-gauge
expanded metal screen or wire mesh securely fastened on the inside. If
visual access is a factor, the windows should be translucent or
opaqued. When doors are used in pairs, a mullion insert anchored top
and bottom should be installed between the doors.  <p> <h4>AR 380-5
H-11. Door louvers or baffle plates</h4> When used, they should be
reinforced with 18-gauge expanded metal screen, or wire mesh fastened
inside the area.  <p> <h4>AR 380-5 H-12. Door locking devices</h4>
 a. Entrance doors should be secured with either a GSA-approved
built-in, three-position, dial-type, changeable combination lock; a
GSA-approved combination padlock (per paragraph 5-101) as amended and
as specified in paragraph 5-102d; a key-operated padlock or locking
device with high security cylinder and hasp (see figure H-1) as
described in the same paragraph; or a built-in 1-inch throw, deadbolt
lock equipped with the GSA-approved high- security cylinder; or
preferably a combination of these.  Other doors should be firmly
secured from the inside with a panic bolt (actuated by a panic bar), a
deadbolt, a rigid wood or metal bar (fitted to preclude
""springing''), extending across the width of the door and held in
position by solid clamps, preferably on the door casing, or other
means approved by the cognizant OPSEC Support Unit and Fire Marshal.
 b. The new High-Security Padlock approved July 1982 became available
within the supply system late fall 1982. It has the same Federal Stock
Number as the Sargent and Greenleaf (S&G) Model 831B Padlock, which is
being phased out of service.  <p> <h4>AR 380-5 H-13. Ceilings</h4>
Ceilings should be constructed of plaster, gypsum wallboard material,
panels, hardboard, wood, plywood, ceiling tile, or other material
offering similar resistance to and detection of unauthorized
entry. Wire mesh, 18-gauge expanded metal screen, or other nonopaque
material offering similar resistance to, and evidence of, unauthorized
entry into the area may be used if visual access to classified
material is not a factor. When wall barriers do not extend to the
ceiling, and a false ceiling is used, this false ceiling should be
reinforced with wire mesh or 18-gauge expanded metal screen, alarmed
and otherwise secured with heavy-duty builder's hardware. (This
measure also applies when panels are removable, and entry can be
gained into the area without visible detection.) When wire mesh or
expanded metal screens are used, they must be secured to adjoining
walls in a manner which precludes removal without leaving evidence of
tampering. In those instances where barrier walls of an area extend to
a solid ceiling, there is no need to reinforce a false ceiling;
however, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) should monitor this
otherwise unobserved area.  <p> <h4>AR 380-5 H-14. Ceilings (unusual
cases)</h4> It is recognized that instances may arise where activities
have a valid justification for not erecting a solid suspended ceiling
as part of the area, especially in high-ceiling hangars. The activity
may contend that the use of a suspended ceiling is impractical because
of production methods, such as the use of overhead cranes for moving
bulky equipment within the area. Cases also exist where the air
conditioning system may be impeded by the construction of a solid
suspended ceiling (such as ADP centers). At times, even the height of
the classified material may make a suspended ceiling impractical. In
such cases, special provisions should be made to ensure that
surreptitious entry cannot be achieved by entering the area over the
top of the barrier walls (for example, employ approved intrusion
detection systems, sensors, and more frequent guard patrols). Areas of
this type should be closely scrutinized to ensure that the structural
safeguards are adequate to preclude entry via adjacent pipes,
catwalks, and ladders, or to preclude observation, if visual access is
a factor.  <p> <h4>AR 380-5 H-15. Miscellaneous openings</h4> Where
ducts, pipes, registers, sewers, and tunnels are of such size and
shape as to permit unauthorized entry (in excess of 96 square inches,
for example), they will be secured by 18-gauge expanded metal screen,
wire mesh, or where more practical steel bars at least 1/2-inch in
diameter with a maximum space of 6 inches between the bars. The steel
bars will be securely fastened at both ends to preclude removal, and
will have 1/4-inch thick by 1-1/2-inch wide steel crossbars at 18-inch
intervals to prevent spreading. When wire mesh, expanded metal screen,
or steel bars are used, installation should ensure that classified
material cannot be removed through the openings with the aid of any
type of instrument. Care also will be taken to ensure that a barrier
placed across any waterway (sewer or tunnel) will not cause clogging
or offer obstruction to the free flow of water or sewage.  <p> <h4>AR
380-5 H-16. Approved alarm systems</h4> Information and limitation on
use of approved intrusion detection systems, both commercial and DOD
J-SIIDS equipment, can be found in DIA Manual 50-3, chapter III, dated
2 May 1980.  Model designations of items specifically approved for use
in protection of U.S.  classified information and material are
provided in that chapter, along with other pertinent information.  All
detailed information relative to an alarmed area and the electronic
system protecting its classified defense information or materiel
(i.e., electrical diagrams indicating wire runs, sensor and control
placements, as well as sensor types and area of coverage, floor plans,
and photographs revealing the position or existence of such items
within the area), will be tightly controlled and marked For Official
Use Only.  </body> </html>

<p>
 Here is an example of an the eigenvector <a href="eig_003.gif"> chi </a> 
(with the third lowest eigenvalue)
of M_dagger M. It is the slice with the maximum value of chi_dagger chi.
It has been produced using Lanczos algorithm with 1024 steps.
The pictures have been produced with MATLAB using cubic interpolation
for smoothing.

<h1> Current Massive Project </h1><p>

At the moment, my time and energy are being gobbled up in designing the
<a href = "//www.physics.brown.edu/ObsCosmology/msam2/optics/optics.html">optical setup</a> for the <a href = "//www.physics.brown.edu/ObsCosmology/msam2/msam2.html">MSAM II telescope.</a> <p> 

The ultimate goal is to couple a gaussian beam (produced by a pair of scalar
feed horns and a tertiary mirror) into an existing telescope provided by
the good folks down at Goddard.  The trouble comes in trying to produce the
correct sized beam with horns that will fit inside of our dewar while maintaining the low sidelobe levels required to unambiguously measure the CMBR anisotropy.<p>

<p>
<h1> Spring 1995 </h1>
<p>
Well, with <i>"Broccoli Night"</i> now regretfully over and Spring coming on soon, my
thoughts are rapidly converging on the upcoming flight of our experiment in
1996.  We will be road tripping down to Texas in April to test some of the
telescope (including our kicking optics) and then it's back up here to Brown
to tidy up the odds and ends for the real thing.

Abstract:
 
We study experimentally atomic motion in an accelerating
                periodic lattice. The potential is formed by a chirped
                standing wave of light that is tuned far from atomic resonance
                so that the atoms remain in the ground state. This atom
                accelerator can be used to launch sub-recoil atomic samples
                for atomic interferometry. It is also strongly related to the
                condensed matter system of a Bloch electron in a dc electric
                field which has been studied for many years. We observe
                Wannier-Stark ladder resonances by probe spectroscopy of the
                band structure. We also observe quantum tunnelling, which
                is the ultimate loss mechanism for this atom accelerator.

DR. JOHN KOHL
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics 
 
Abstract:
 
The SOHO Ultraviolet Coronagraph Spectrometer (UVCS/SOHO) is a joint
project of SAO and the University of Florence. The instrument
is being used for ultraviolet spectroscopy of the extended solar
corona in order to describe and understand coronal heating and solar
wind acceleration. The observations include measurements of spectral
line profiles for HI Lyman alpha and beta, O VI 103.2 and 103.7 nm,
Mg X 62.5 nm and other spectral lines. Intensities for about 40
minor ions have been observed. 
 
Preliminary results for equatorial streamers provide line-of-sight
velocity distributions for protons, oxygen and iron ions that are
similar to those expected for an equilibrium plasma at a temperature
of 2E6 K. In the case of polar coronal holes, the line-of-sight
velocities at 1/e are much larger than expected (several hundred km/s)
and are similar for hydrogen, oxygen and magnesium with oxygen having
the largest values. The velocities in the radial direction appear
to be much smaller.  The velocity distribution may have contributions from
microscopic velocities, macroscopic velocities and transverse wave motions.
Derived outflow velocities for hydrogen and oxygen are supersonic above about
2 solar radii from sun center in polar coronal holes, and oxygen outflow
velocities reach values of about 100 km/s in the tips of equatorial
streamers. Mass flow velocities during a coronal mass ejection also have
been measured. 

Tea will be served at 3:30 p.m.

``Structure and Spectra of Atomic Bose-Einstein Condensates''

Abstract:

About a year after their first production in the laboratory,
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of alkali atoms are now being used in
physics experiments: measurements of excitation spectra, temperature
dependence of the condensate fraction, and specific heat have been
reported, and no doubt we shall soon hear reports from the labs of
collisions between condensates, coexistence of several condensate
species, and who knows what else?  A good sense of the current state of
this fast-moving field can be obtained from Mark Edwards' WWW page
http://amo.phy.gasou.edu, particularly the on-line bibliography.  I will
discuss what new physics has been learned from this work, what more basic
physics we hope to learn, and prospects for BEC applications such as the
"atom laser."  The intellectual basis for the perspective I present is
computational atomic/condensed matter physics: solution of the
mean-field, zero-temperature (Hartree/Gross-Pitaevskii/Bogoliubov)
equations formulated for systems of 103-105 interacting bosons confined
in three-dimensional harmonic traps with characteristic frequencies of
10-103 Hz.

Scientific Colloquium

``Multiwavelength Studies of X-ray Binaries''

Abstract:

Accretion onto compact objects is one of the most important energy
release mechanisms in the Universe.  From the X-ray binaries that
are the most luminous sources in our own Galaxy to the active
galactic nuclei and quasars that are the most intrinsically luminous
cosmic sources now known, accretion is the central, unifying theme.
Owing to their proximity and brightness, X-ray binaries lend
themselves especially well to a detailed study of accretion.  The
X-ray flux responds sensitively to geometry, ultraviolet emission
characterizes phenomena in the majority of the accretion disk, and
optical emission identifies the outer disk and the companion star ---
hence simultaneous observations in all wavelength bands are needed
to constrain comprehensive models properly. 

To illustrate the results that can be obtained from current space- and
ground-based instruments, I will discuss an extensive multiwavelength
campaign on the X-ray pulsar system Her X-1/HZ Her.  The simultaneous
X-ray/UV/Optical data obtained made it possible to show a direct
connection between the mass accretion rates, disk precession, and
spin up/spin down episodes of the system that has impact on theories
of angular momentum transport in accretion disks.  I will also discuss
simultaneous observations with the HST/GHRS and ASCA of several X-ray
binaries that enable us to determine fine details of accretion structure
via accurate measurements of the shapes and kinematic velocities of
lines and their rapid time changes.\par

``Understanding Gauge Coupling Unification in String Theory:
                         A Review of Recent Developments''

Abstract:

This will be a pedagogical review talk surveying the various approaches
  	towards understanding gauge coupling unification within string theory.
  	As is well known, one of the major problems confronting string
   	phenomenology has been an apparent discrepancy between the scale
   	of gauge coupling unification predicted within string theory, and the
   	unification scale expected within the framework of the
   	Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM).
   	In this talk, I will provide an overview of the different
   	approaches that have been taken in recent years towards reconciling
   	these two scales, and outline some of the major recent developments
   	in each.  These approaches include string GUT models;
   	higher Ka\v{c}-Moody levels and non-standard hypercharge
   	normalizations;  heavy string threshold corrections;
   	light SUSY thresholds;  effects from intermediate-scale gauge and
   	matter structure beyond the MSSM;  strings without supersymmetry;
   	and strings at strong coupling.

``Quantum Chaos with Interactions:  Experiments in Quantum Dots''

Abstract:

This talk will present recent experiments on mesoscopic fluctuations in
quantum dots at low temperatures across the transition from open to
isolated quantum systems. At the transition from open to isolated,
conduction becomes dominated by tunneling, and individual
resonances become resolved. At this same point, Coulomb blockade of
conduction due to electron interactions appears,leading to periodic peaks
in conductance as the number of electrons on the dot changes.

Mesoscopic fluctuations persist in the nearly-isolated regime, and appear
well described by random matrix theory, A large separation of energy
scales allows a non-interacting random matrix theory to be applied to
this strongly interacting problem.

Finally, this discuss mesoscopic fluctuations of cotunneling, a coherent
virtual process. These new experimental results allow a direct
measurement of the tunneling time.

<title>LOVE Enter</title>

<h2>Reviews of LOVE Enter</h2>

Six weeks after its release at Houghton Mifflin, <i>LOVE Enter</i>
went into a second printing.  <i>LOVE Enter</i> is a love story set in Paris
and New Orleans, and was just named the winner of the 1993
<i>Los Angeles Times</i>
Book Award for First Fiction.
<i>LOVE Enter</i> was included in the <i>New York Times</i> "Books
for Vacation Reading" list (June 6) for this summer. 

<ul>
<li>
Lisa Zeidner, in the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> (May 23),
calls <i>LOVE Enter</i> "original and moving.  Kafka's tender novel gives the 
familiar story of Americans in Paris, in love, a fresh spin."
<li>
Eugenia Zukerman, in the <i>Washington Post</i> (May 4) calls
<i>LOVE Enter</i> "virtuosic, the characters unique and as multilayered
as a napoleon, and bittersweet as absinthe."
<li>
Suzanne Freeman, in the <i>Boston Globe</i> (May 16), 
describes <i>LOVE Enter</i> 
as "an exploration of that mysterious area where love and
technology intersect.  Kafka writes with passion and promise."
<li>
"<i>LOVE Enter</i> dazzlingly evokes young passion through luxuriant
language and an aphrodisiacal Parisian backdrop," writes
<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (March 22) in a starred review.
<li>
<i>Cosmopolitan</i> (May) describes <i>LOVE Enter</i> as "thoroughly charming
and romantic.  The start of a great literary career."
</ul>

<h2> From the dust cover of LOVE Enter by Paul Kafka</h2>

<blockquote>
Remember what it was like to fall in love --
wildly, hopeless in love -- for the first time?
Paul Kafka's gloriously romantic debut novel 
recaptures love's first days
in a sparkling, bittersweet tale of awakening and longing.
<p>

Paris sets the scene for the emotional
entanglements of four young Americans.
Dan and Beck, just out of college, share a
ramshackle garret and the friendship of
Margot and Bou, two women who happen to be in love with each other. 
For a
brief, enchanted time, the foursome revel
in the bohemian splendor of the City of
Light. But when loyalties shift, as they
inevitably  do, the friends discover the
heartbreaking boundaries of intimacy.
Five years later, Dan is finishing medical school 
in New Orleans and delivering
babies at a local hospital. 
But memories of Paris haunt him. Where are they now
-- outrageous Beck, wise, steadfast Margot, impulsive, irresistible Bou? 
Do they think of him, and of each other? In the
midnight minutes between births, Dan
uses the maternity ward's computer to
write long letters to his faraway friends,
conjuring up the rapture of their early
days together, when they were just entering the realm of love.
<p>

Stylish, fresh, filled with charmingly
offbeat characters and saturated with
Parisian sunlight,
 LOVE Enter is an epistolary romance for the modern age.

<h2> "Praise for LOVE Enter:" </h2>

<blockquote>

Paul Kafka's enchanting novel brings a new dimension to the
epistolary romance and a fresh face to the American in Paris.  
The city gleams and winks, seduces and betrays as if 
for the first time in this deftly written love story.
It's a beauty -- a crazy, unexpected, entirely winning tale:
Paris love remembered by a young doctor on the milky computer
screen of a New Orleans maternity ward at night.
When Paul Kafka hist the Enter key to `save to memory,' the
story gets send straight to the heart.
<p>
<address>--Patricia Hampl</address>
<p>

<i>LOVE Enter </i> is a delight and a revelation, a must-read for lovers
of Paris, for lovers of young love in all its awkwardness, beauty, and 
bittersweet trials.
It was hard for me to believe contemporary Paris could 
still evoke this romantic
backdrop in so originial and engaging a fashion, but novelist
Paul Kafka, with delicacy, wit, and wisdom, succedds where
fainter hearts (and lesser talents) might fear to tread.

TotWare - Benjamin's Favorites </h1>

<p><hr>
Here are some <a href="#PC">PC</a>
and <a href="#Mac">Mac</a>
shareware and freeware programs we liked.
<p>

For other opinions, see what they're saying on
<a href="news:misc.kids.computer">misc.kids.computer</a>.
For a Web sites to visit with your child, see
<a href="http://www.crc.ricoh.com/people/steve/kids.html">
the list</a> compiled by Stephen Savitzky.
<p>
(We started this page in 1993 when both Benjamin and
the Web were younger.  Lots of other folks now contribute
pages and reviews, too, so look around.) 
<p>

Don't forget that shareware can be expensive
relative to a good commercial program,
since the latter often have many more activities.
For example, LetterLand is nicely done and only
costs $8.00 but may not be 1/4 as good as, say,
Bailey's Book House.  (...Particularly when you
discover that it only has about 20 letters!)

<h2>Numerical Field Theory</h2>

The Computational High Energy Physics Group here at Brown has been
giving a number of talks and papers on a new method for the numerical
calculation of field theory quantities, based on Galerkin techniques.  
Since these haven't arrived in book or journal form yet, 
I'll just point them out here.<p>

The first paper is by S. Garc&iacute;a, G. Guralnik and J. Lawson, and was
recently accepted for publication by <i>Physics Letters B</i>:<p>

<A HREF=het908.ps><img src="/images/button-ps.gif"> S. Garc&iacute;a (Brown), G. S. Guralnik (LANL), and J. Lawson (Brown), <i>A New Approach to Numerical Quantum Field Theory</i>, BROWN-HET-908.</A>

<p>
Two talks were given at the lattice conference in Dallas.  The first
was by Garc&iacute;a on boson problems:<p>

<A HREF=lattice93_garc&iacute;a.ps><img src="/images/button-ps.gif"> S. Garc&iacute;a (Brown), <i>A New Approach to Numerical Quantum Field Theory</i>.</A>

Apparently, no one has tired of that title yet.<p>

 Lawson presented a
talk on fermionic issues:<p>
<A HREF=lattice93_lawson.ps><img src="/images/button-ps.gif"> J. Lawson (Brown), <i>A New Method for Solving Lattice QFT with Dynamical Fermions</i>.</A>

This talk contains a different calculation than the one presented in the
first two documents.  John is now at ICTP Trieste, and his email address is
<i>lawson@ictp.trieste.it</i>.

<h3>Lattice Fermions</h3>

Currently, I'm doing some work on extending the fermionic methods that
Lawson developed.  A good review of lattice fermions and other
issues was given by Kogut:<p>

<img src="/images/rules.gif"> J. Kogut, <i>A Review of the Lattice Gauge Theory Approach to Quantum Chromodynamics</i>, Rev. Mod. Phys., <b>55</b>:775 (1983).<p>

A less formal introduction was given by S. Garc&iacute;a in his prelim
talk a few years ago:<p>

<img src="/images/talk.gif"> S. Garc&iacute;a (Brown), <i>Fermion Doubling</i>.
When I get a chance, I'll scan in the amusing title page from this
talk.

Yet another introduction is given by Susskind:<p>

<img src="/images/rules.gif"> L. Susskind (Tel Aviv/Yeshiva), <i>Lattice fermions</i>, Phys. Rev. D., <b>16</b>:3031 (1977).  Of key importance is the
demonstration of the equivalence of the Thirring Model and the XY Model,
which implies that the Source Galerkin methods can be swiftly turned
to numerical problems in condensed matter theory.

<h2>Thermal Field Theory</h2>

Currently, I'm just starting to review the topic of infrared divergences at
finite temperature.  A good place to start for TFT in general is a 
recent review by T. Altherr of Annecy-le-Vieux, who is currently at CERN:<p>

<A HREF=ftp://preprint.slac.stanford.edu/pub/preprints/hep-ph/9307/9307277.ps.Z><img src="/images/button-ps.gif"> T. Altherr (CERN), <i> Introduction to Thermal Field Theory</i>, hep-ph/9307277</A>

Altherr introduces the resummation program of Braaten and Pisarski in
the context of a \phi^4 theory.<p>

A more technical paper, which also is developed in \phi^4,  
is:<p>

<A HREF=ftp://preprint.slac.stanford.edu/pub/preprints/hep-ph/9304/9304254.ps.Z><img src="/images/button-ps.gif"> C. G. Boyd (Chicago), D. E. Brahm (Caltech), and S. D. H. Hsu (Harvard), <i>Resummation Methods at Finite Temperature: The Tadpole Way</i>, hep-ph/9304254</A>

Boyd <i>et al</i> are concerned with the counting difficulties that a
number of the resummation methods in the literature present.<p>

My short review paper on finite temperature is also available:<p>

<A HREF="resummation.ps"><img src="/images/button-ps.gif"> S. C. Hahn (Brown), <i> An Introduction to Resummation</i></A>

One interesting aspect of this review is that it actually derives the
thermal mass contribution, unlike most other papers in the literature.
The contribution in the zero bare mass case can be done exactly, in terms
of special functions.<p>

<h1>LOVE Enter</h1>
 
<h2>The setting for the novel and the reading</h2>

<p>
In the novel Dan Shoenfeld, a fourth-year medical sutdent
at Tulane, is working nights in the maternity ward of Charity
Hospital.  Between delivering babies, Dan types
three extended letters into a hospital computer designed
for writing up cases.  His access code is LOVE, and he will
eventually send the letters, one through Internet and two by mail,
to three close friends with whom he spend a year in Paris after college.
<p>

Dan's first letter is to Bou, the woman he knew four years before in
Paris, and with whom he is still hopelessly and somewhat 
abashedly in love.
The middle third of the novel, BECK.DOC, is addressed to Beck.
Beck was Dan's best friend in Paris and, for a time afterwards,
became Dan's enemy.  
The third letter is to Margot, Bou's lover, who throughout the year in Paris
and in the four years since has remained Dan's faithful friend.

CALL		10/23/92 * 23:06		BOU.DOC
</b>
</pre>
 
 
Jennifer Sandler is the magician here tonight.  Renee Gilbert 
plays the role of her beautiful, silent assistant.  Soon a baby 
will spring from the trick box of Renee's belly.  Sandler 
prepares for her performance to the accompaniment of the 
hidden infant's own heartbeats, which come thudding 
through the internal monitor with the steady rhythm of a 
galloping horse.  The shining instruments are set out, the 
brilliant lights focused.  At the last moment the internal 
monitor is removed, and in the thick, new silence, Renee is 
curtained off from her own abdomen by the blue drape, 
which the nurses hang from two IV stands so that it falls just 
above her navel.  
<p>
   What's going on? Renee's eyes immediately ask.  She 
knows she's going to miss the good part.  I want to tell her, 
but I'm new here and afraid to speak unless spoken to.  With 
a crowd pleasing sweep, Sandler draws the blue triangle of 
the scalpel forward.  The attending physician, Gus Grant, is 
letting her lead.  He follows her with the pad, catching the 
surge of blood.  Sandler's fingers glide and turn, face his, 
bow, and glide again.  Red seeps across until Grant catches 
it. 
<p>
   Renee's nose twitches.  She's the only one in the room 
not wearing a mask.  She wrinkles her nose again and I 
have a strong urge to reach over and adjust her epidural.  
I'm sure she's in pain. 
<p>
   "An itch?" the anesthetist asks. 
<p>
   She nods.  The woman scratches Renee's nose. 
 
 
Sandler uncovers the pink dome of the uterus, which pushes 
up against the eye-shaped window in the transversus 
abdominis.  She nods to Grant, and he hands the bladder 
blade to the scrub tech while he and Sandler lean back and 
pull hard.  I hold my breath, wear my poker face.  The 
window in Renee's belly only yawns an inch wider, the 
uterus rising higher toward the white light.  Renee's 
eyebrows form question marks. 
<p>
   "Almost there," I whisper, stepping forward.  I can't help 
myself.  I'm not doing a damn thing.  It must be my job to 
talk to Renee.  I try to ignore the silence that surrounds us. 
<p>
   "How you holding up?" 
<p>
   "I'm glad it's almost over," she tells me.  She's been in 
the hospital since one this afternoon.  She was only at 
twenty-nine weeks, so when she came in contracting, Grant 
checked for ruptured membranes and urinary infection, then 
hydrated her and put her on terbutaline to stop her or at 
least slow her down.  He also gave her a shot of 
betamethasone to accelerate fetal lung maturity.  At twenty- 
nine weeks, the air sacs of the lungs don't hold enough 
surface tension for the lobes to expand.  Betamethasone 
stimulates the production of the surfactant.  Renee's 
contractions didn't slow, so Grant put her on magnesium 
sulfate to supplement the terbutaline.  Her membranes 
ruptured and then, at six o'clock, the baby scared the pants 
off everybody with persistent late decelerations.  That's what 
finally reserved Renee this prime, dinner-hour table in OR. 
<p>
   "Have you picked names?" I whisper.  We're the two 
youngest in the room, not counting whoever's inside. 
<p>
   "Jordan." 
<p>
   "How about a girl?" 
<p>
   "Jordan.  Thought we had another week or two," she 
says, her mouth turning down in a mock pout.  She thought 
she had another ten. 
<p>
   "I like Jordan." 
<p>
   "My father's name," she says.  She speaks in the slow 
New Orleans style, as if the two of us are strolling beneath 
the live oaks of a peaceful avenue.   She's a thin woman 
where she isn't pregnant.  Her wrists are thin.  She's the 
color the nurses here call cream. 
<p>
   I step back to look past the drapes.  Sandler's hands 
turn, lean, glide.  Her steel wand deepens the crescent in 
the uterus.  Sandler and Grant work faster.  Their hands 
pass, dip, pass.  Sandler stops, nods.  They lean forward 
until their masked noses almost touch.  The silence is 
complete.  One of Sandler's hands disappears, then the 
other. 
<p>
   The baby leaps, blue, green under the lights.  Renee's 
eyes find it in midair.  For an instant we all disappear.  
There's only Renee and her baby floating above her.  
Sandler suctions the baby's nose and mouth.  Grant clamps 
and cuts the umbilical cord and passes the kid, who is a 
boy, to Chris Spellman, the neonatal attending.  Spellman 
lays him firmly in the middle of the table.  We go to work. 
<p>
   "Eight forty-one," the circulating nurse calls.  I wipe 
glistening vernix off Jordan's belly and back.  Spellman holds 
the oxygen catheter to his nose. 
<p>
   "One minute," the nurse calls out. 
<p>
   She's waiting for Apgar scores, which summarize a 
baby's condition.  Spellman ignores her.  We can see the 
baby's condition.  He's pale and his chest sucks in with 
every breath.  I put a mask on him and push air into him 
with the bag.  He turns a shade or two darker, and 
Spellman's worrying shoulders drop an inch.  The same 
nurse who called for scores comes over to bracelet the kid's 
ankle and ink his feet and finger as if this were a normal 
delivery.  Spellman frowns her right back across the room.  
He wants to get this boy dry and warm before we take care 
of the bookkeeping.  The baby's crying now, but not well.  
Spellman holds him up for Renee.  She looks.  Her eyes 
carry him right through the air to her.  
 
 
Now it's midnight, Bou.  I'm on call.  My hands walk up and 
down this keyboard like Jennifer Sandler's own.  Green 
words dance across the screen, the way they have since I 
thought of you an hour ago.  It's four years, four months 
since we said goodbye, or whatever we said.  You're still the 
one I want to tell about my day.  That makes this a love 
letter, doesn't it?  I'm writing you a love letter. 
<p>
   I just can't get used to Labor and Delivery.  For one 
thing, the colors up here are ridiculous.  Hospitals are 
supposed to be white, but the narrow corridors of this wing 
are yellow, the floor is speckled black, white, and pink, and 
inside the miniature delivery rooms, the walls are tiled to 
breast height, bright pink above.  For another thing, I can't 
adjust to the rhythm of this place.  Delivery's like a nursing 
home crossed with a fire station.  For hours nothing 
happens, then all at once everything goes crazy.  There are 
two separate and supposedly equal teaching hospitals under 
this roof, Tulane's and Louisiana State's.  This morning there 
were five births in an hour, just on the Tulane side.  But 
tonight after the C-section, there was absolute silence on 
both sides of the delivery hall. 
<p>
   Sandler sewed up Renee's uterus and tucked it back 
inside.  Grant left for another delivery and the third-year 
resident, Tim Clinton, came in.  He sewed up Renee's belly 
while Sandler chatted with her about Renee's five-year-old, 
Marcy.  Turns out Marcy doesn't want a baby brother or 
sister to come live in her house and use her old crib.  She 
asked this morning if the new baby couldn't live down the 
street at her friend Jamie's house. 
<p>
   Clinton's another one of my new bosses.  He asked me 
who I was and if I knew anything about outboard motors.  I 
told him no and that I was a fourth-year subintern who'd 
been in neonatal and was starting OB.  Good to have you 
aboard, he said, and then told me all about his motor 
anyway.  He's pretty sure he's got a sticking carburetor, and 
from the symptoms he described, I had to confirm that 
diagnosis.  He imitated engine noises while stitching up 
Renee as delicately as if he were embroidering a pillowcase.  
Finally Renee's belly was crossed by a single stitched line.  
The circulating nurse and the scrub chanted inventory in a 
soothing nursery rhyme.  They have to make sure no 
instruments are left inside the patients. 
<p>
   I told Renee goodbye, as if she were the guest of 
honor, and left her chatting with Sandler and the nurses.  I 
watched a Monopoly game in the unit clerk's office until I got 
sleepy.  The RNs, LPNs, aides, and scrub techs all hang out 
in Unit Clerk, which looks like a big kitchen, with two phones 
and a copy machine next to the sink and a school clock on 
the wall.  Finally I wandered toward the Residents' Room to 
lie down, but instead found myself in Nurses' Conference in 
front of this computer.  No one ever uses the machine, or 
this room.  I pulled a sweater and a jacket off the monitor 
and flipped on the CPU.  Up out of the hard drive flew the 
winged-staff-and-serpent caduceus, then a full-screen 
banner saying WELCOME TO MEDWARE, and finally a 
menu.  I picked CHART, which gave me a divided screen, 
the bottom half filled with medical abbreviations and a list of 
lab result tables, the top half blank except for a pulsing 
cursor.  I started writing to you.  The words just poured out.  
I started describing the C-section.  I knew you'd want to 
know everything.  I had to type as fast as I could, just to 
keep up with your questions. 
<p>
   Kate, the head night nurse, came in fifteen minutes ago.  
She told me this IBM arrived with the Great Cash 
Transfusion of 1990, after the Joint Commission on 
Accreditation of Health Care Organizations nearly shut 
Charity down.  The commission found a few minor problems 
with the hospital, such as poor blood banking, thirty beds 
together in undivided wards, no fire doors between corridors, 
and no significant records on the patients.  I exaggerate, but 
Kate says this PC, the steel doors between wards, and the 
cloth partitions inside the giant rooms were supposed to drag 
Charity into the modern era. 
<p>
   To my eye, the results are only so-so.  I'd say the 
hospital is now hovering in the late '50s, but then I'm in no 
position to criticize.  Who knows where I am.  All I can say 
with confidence is that I'm not in New Orleans, I'm not in 
October 1992, and I haven't even decided if I want to be.  I 
should make use of this computer and these scattered hours 
of something like leisure, because I probably won't have this 
opportunity again until I retire.  Over the next ten weeks I 
could update my records and try to figure out what's wrong 
with me.  I think it's a memory problem.  I've got to free up 
some working memory, or I'm always going to function in the 
fog that has surrounded me since last spring.  My trouble is 
backlog.  The records for one year in particular--a year you 
know everything and nothing about--are such a mess that 
my only chance of sorting through them is to toss everything 
out and start from scratch. 
<p>
   I'll go high tech and put the whole year into this 
computer.  Perhaps in that way I can create an order not my 
own.  I'll work at night and during the day, whenever it's 
quiet.  There's nothing I won't tell you, except how much I'm 
still thinking about you, which you know.  I'll write about my 
New Orleans and especially about that Paris we knew, which 
stubbornly refuses to stay in the past. 
<p>
   I'll conjure you right up into the air, Bou, the way 
Sandler abracadabraed Jordan out of Renee's belly.  Then, 
when you're floating in front of me, I won't reach out.  I'll just 
look, while everything else disappears.

<h2>
BOUTIQUE MADEMOISELLE 
</h2>
 
 
"Bless us," Beck called up the stairwell.  "If it isn't the Sax Machine."  
<p>
   I followed him to the landing where you towered behind Margot.  Beck picked Margot 
up and whirled her around, then set her down and kissed her with loud smacking noises, as if 
she were his six-year-old niece.  I stood in front of you, Bou, and my soul ran at a fast clip 
up to my eyes and leapt in a shallow, long-jump arc across the air into your eyes and was 
gone.  I felt my metatarsals bow up and open, my lungs widen.  I longed to take your hands 
in mine, lace my fingers in yours, squat and rock on my heels with you.  We'd begin, eye to 
eye, forehead to forehead, knees wobbling, to balance and whisper together.  Instead I stood 
to one side.  Bou? I asked.  A hat store, you said.  Really two, both called Boutique 
Mademoiselle.  The main branch was under the table where your mother and her friends 
played bridge.  They had all called you Bou. 
<p>
   That made no sense at all, but Margot was greeting me now, her hands under my 
elbows, her cheek against mine.  A loose, lost-and-found arrow surged up and through me.  I 
kissed Margot with closed eyes, and didn't need to see her because I already knew the high 
Eskimo curve of her cheeks cresting above me, the blue of her eyes, the trill of her tongue 
speaking, the spiral fall of her hair, the weight of her breasts not in my hands.  I listened for 
my heart and found it plashing away inside her, and I realized I'd lost that, too.  And so it 
was there on the landing during that first long moment that I learned I loved you and Margot, 
not indistinguishably but inseparably, and always. 
<p>
   Margot led us into the apartment, poured out mugs of wine, and sat me on a sofa with 
a rounded back at one end, which she told me was a chaise longue.  The whole place was full 
of battered antiques with names.  Under a tall candelabrum with forty-watt bulbs in orange 
hats stood an inlaid writing desk, its broken hood rolled two-thirds of the way up.  A scarred 
wooden table with legs like ironwood trunks grew across the alcove by the kitchen.  In the 
living room grate was that fossil of a Path Marconi TV, a little Sputnik, complete with 
vacuum tubes and a bell fuselage.  The apartment was surprising and intricate, and Beck 
jumped on the subject while I was still trying to decide what had just happened to me twice, 
or once. 
<p>
   "Most excellent crib," he told Margot in the kitchen.  "One imagines a lock of 
chestnut hair tied with velvet ribbon in that defunct critoire, and a dried rose petal between 
the pages of a musty Baudelaire in the study.  Down the hall, beneath a tear-dampened 
handkerchief, a last letter from the front, cut by a single gold-rimmed bullet hole.  Why else 
comes faint but unmistakable lamentation from high in the corners of this twilight salon, 
which heard such laughter, saw such love?   Yes'm, truly a mysterious and alluring rental 
property.  Ours is a little simpler.  N'est-ce pas, Daniel?" 
<p>
   Beck pretended you didn't exist, as was his way when he wanted to get to know a 
woman more than he thought she might want to know him.  The music of Thelonious Sphere 
Monk moaned from the tiny cassette player in the kitchen.  Margot chopped and sauteed 
mushrooms.  You told me about Yale and how of course you remembered Beck, he'd danced 
with you at a party once.  You were concentrating in modern European history and theater, 
and I was concentrating on the symmetrical and economic grace with which you moved 
through the room.  I stood and helped set the table, and you told me about your family while 
I looked at your cinnamon lashes and the strength of your forearms and hands, which held an 
invisible bridle together with forks and spoons.  Your father was a financial counsel which 
was actually a kind of lawyer, and your mother a preschool teacher and perpetual student of 
early childhood.  My father was a doctor, I told you, and when you didn't ask what kind, I 
had that sinking feeling that always comes before I talk about Mom.  I was about to go 
through with it when you said that you had two brothers, but that the middle one, Nathan, had 
drowned.  We stopped setting and looked at each other. 
<p>
   "He was seventeen," you said.  Mom was thirty-four, I told you.  We didn't need to 
whisper because we weren't telling secrets, and both Beck and Thelonious were at full 
volume.  But we leaned across the table and once more looked into each other's eyes, as if to 
glimpse those always present, always absent ones.  In your tensed shoulders, Stonewall 
Jackson chin, smoky eyes, and cropped blond hair, I found him. 
<p>
   Beck went off to the toilet, and for the first time Margot tried to teach me how to fold 
napkins.  I still work at it every once in a while.  What amazes me is that in five years I've 
never repeated the same mistake.  My napkins are like snowflakes.  She was patient and 
thought I wasn't just watching her eyes and lips above the conical nests of linen she wove 
while her unpredictable, low-high voice spun instructions in the air like birdsong.  She was 
busty and sturdy, and she looked up at an angle that included my middle but took in all of 
me, so that standing in front of her, I was entirely present. 
<p>
   Beck returned full of enthusiasm.  Plumbing, he told me right past you, was an 
astonishing invention.  We should look into it at once.  We three sat down and ate the 
mushroom omelet and salad while Margot made a second omelet.  We ate that, two yogurts, 
and all the bread while Margot got out a leftover chicken.  We picked the chicken apart and 
finished the second and half of the third bottle of wine, along with a hunk of reblochon and a 
box of toasts.  Margot nibbled the salad. 
<p>
   It happened that fast.  We'd been at Rue Berlioz just over an hour.  The pattern of 
feasting, and of who loved and nourished whom, was already firmly in place. 
 
 
Two hours later I soaked myself and my tights in Berlioz's lion-footed, rowboat-size bathtub.  
When I was dry, I went to your bedroom and hung the tights over the glowing sconce, which 
clung like a phosphorescent barnacle to the wall.  I set a towel on the cracked marble table to 
catch the drip, and lay my muscle shirt over the radiator.  Margot's two saxes, one taller than 
the other, stood by the hall door like a big and little brother.  Opposite them was the oak 
armoire with the handles like saucers.  A row of books ran from its feet to a knitting basket 
in the corner.  Threadbare velvet drapes were roped back to expose the middle halves of the 
balcony windows, which reflected the olive-and-royal-blue madras spread tucked under the 
wide futon.  A worn, eyeless elephant lay in the deflated cleavage between the missing 
pillows. 
<p>
   I tiptoed down the hall.  You and Margot spooned like a beautiful dwarf and a 
handsome noblewoman in the TV moonlight.  You held one hand protectively under Margot's 
head, her dark hair falling across you.  Beck, too, was asleep, leaning back against the chaise 
on the dried-out herringbone floor.  His head was tilted past what looked comfortable, and 
his knees were Egyptian left.  He wore a bleached Texaco attendant's shirt, which said Jess in 
once-red thread above the pocket. 
<p>
   I stood first watch.

<title>LOVE Enter</title>
 
<h2>
BEHIND EINSTEIN 
</h2>
 
 
 
After she realized I was Jewish, our new concierge, Madame Lagache, took to me.  But right 
from the start she didn't like Beck.  I couldn't understand it.  Almost everyone at Hopital
Forcilles had been wild about his clumsy, American-abroad ways.  Only Madame Lagache 
resented his assaults on French syntax and found no charm in the rags he carefully threw on 
each day, his tattered smoking jacket, his gas station shirts and retirement pants.  She didn't 
see him as a jazz personality with a new look.  She thought he was immodest. 
<p>
   "Monsieur," she called to me from her doorway that first week.  "Will you and your 
friend be staying long?" 
<p>
   She was a small woman with round shoulders, a ruddy complexion, and hennaed 
brown hair worn in an abridged pageboy that just covered her large ears. 
<p>
   "Until we have finished the renovations." 
<p>
   Madame Lagache could have had us thrown out with a single phone call to the 
building plumber, whose atelier was directly across the street.  The plumber would have 
strolled over, taken one look at the pipes, and told us the apartment was illegal until he 
installed the fixtures.  That would have taken a few weeks if Claude Villeneuve agreed to 
pay, which he might not have.  That was why I had to win our concierge over immediately. 
<p>
   "What is your occupation?" Madame Lagache asked. 
<p>
   We were students, I told her, and friends of the Villeneuve family.  Claude hadn't 
returned my calls that week and I was doing nothing, but I said les travaux were under way.  
Madame Lagache squinted suspiciously at me with her steady left eye, while the right one 
bobbed exotropically. 
<p>
   "What is your field of study?" she asked in an icy tone.  Perhaps I was squatting in 
the apartment with no purpose or permission.  Perhaps Claude did not want me to stay, and 
so had engaged no plumber. 
<p>
   It was too late to turn back.  Beck and I were students of medicine.  I didn't mention 
our interests in the arts.  I told her we'd just graduated from Yale University in the United 
States, which was half true, and that we were taking a year to learn French.  Her door opened 
further and one of her arms snaked out and pulled me into her apartment.  In her other hand 
was a book so old it looked like a sponge.  She saw my glance and handed it to me.  Ars 
Moriendi, The Art of Nourishment, first published in 1492.  I looked up and saw that her tiny 
flat, as narrow as a section of the stacks at the top of Carnegie Library at Syracuse, was 
blanketed with books. 
<p>
   "La mdecine," she repeated.  "Have you explored a cadaver then?" 
<p>
   I translated the question as best I could.  In France, at my age, I would have been well 
into medical training.  Yes, I said, I had explored a cadaver, and wondered if this meant 
examined.  I thought of the frog, the two rats, and the eel I'd brutally dismantled over the 
previous years.  Madame Lagache set the porous book aside, grabbed my hands, and held 
them to her face. 
<p>
   "You have the fingers," she said, sniffing them, "of a form weaver."  Her own fingers 
were cold and rough.  My French wasn't nearly up to this kind of talk.  It was more on the 
level of "How long have you been in Paris?" and "American food is less good than French 
food."  I decided to let the remark about my fingers alone.  Would she please, I hazarded, tell 
me about her books? 
<p>
   She grinned with such force that I snatched my hands away and bumped the back of 
my head on her door.  She put on her reading glasses and started hauling volumes off the 
shelves with both hands.  The first one she opened for me was Bourrit's account of the first 
ascent of Mont Blanc, by Paccard and the cowardly peasant Balmat, in 1786. 
<p>
   "Paccard returned blind and without the use of his fingers," Madame Lagache 
mentioned as she pressed the flaking binding to my chest.  "Neither Balmat nor Bourrit ever 
forgave him." 
<p>
   What did I like to read? she asked.  I told her I enjoyed Ionesco and Camus, these 
being two writers from my French class whose names occurred to me.  Madame Lagache 
asked why I didn't study this world and told me that she herself had stopped reading literature 
fifteen years before.  Now she investigated healing, astrology and history, which were all one 
subject.  She knew the poems of her youth by heart and looked at them only when she 
wanted to write them. 
<p>
   I was sure I'd missed an important transition.  Write what?  Then she brought down a 
volume of Apollinaire in which someone had crossed out and revised a number of verses in a 
pointy, backward-leaning hand.  She glanced over these, her lips moving, as if to reassure 
herself that the corrections were justified. 
<p>
   "Before writing," she assured me, "I consult the originator."  She kept talking while I 
decided she meant original.  What bothered me was the familiar way she kept calling out 
"Guillaume," as if Apollinaire himself were right there with us.  The greater part of her 
collection, she told me, was in storage in the cave.  This was only the material currently on 
display. 
<p>
   "You may borrow what you like."  She used the familiar tu.  I had become a borrower 
and a tu at the same moment.  I bowed as far as space permitted. 
<p>
   "You are too kind," I murmured, still employing the vous.  This was a little different 
from my relationship with my landlord at school, a gentleman by the name of Julius Beggs 
on Allen Street, who read only Soldier of Fortune.  When I once asked him to fix my front 
steps, which had crumbled into a pile of brick, he offered instead to fix my dumb college ass 
for me. 
<p>
   "Are you interested in the Greek medicine?" Madame Lagache now inquired.  She 
handed me a long volume wrapped in blue paper.  I undressed it and examined its illustrated 
pages.  A color plate detailed the removal of a tooth in a Golden Age tableau, complete with 
a marble dental chair and a cloud-covered Parnassus.  The Greeks employed a hot iron rod 
for a cautery.  She lifted a dozen books from a cutting board, the topmost of which was the 
Calendrier Solaire et Lunaire of Bai Niam Li.  Then she opened a drawer and pulled out a jar 
of rusty nails.  She put up water as if for tea.  She was entirely friendly now.  Another 
woman had been staring accusingly out the window at Beck and me every time we entered or 
left the building. 
<p>
   We sat side by side at her small table.  Lace doilies marked her end of it as the tea 
table.  A fountain pen, a pile of books, a block of heavy paper, and a maneuverable lamp 
topped by a magnifying glass transformed my end into the desk.  Under the lens was Posie, 
Musique et Graphologie by Docteur Jean-Charles Gille-Maisani. 
<p>
   "What do you know," Madame Lagache asked with studied disinterest, "about the 
Masons?" 
<p>
   I cleared my throat.  I said I believed the Masons were a fraternal order of craftsmen 
who had built the great cathedrals of Europe.  Madame Lagache's left eye fixed me above her 
toothy smile.  My schoolboy's knowledge amused her.  It was as if I had said I believed the 
moon was made of Jarlsberg. 
<p>
   "The Masons are the Lost Tribe of Israel.  They constructed a lunar capsule in Egypt 
three thousand years before Jesus of Nazareth." 
<p>
   I nodded as if I'd suspected as much.  Germaine, as I called her after that day, pushed 
aside a half dozen sheets of cryptic scribblings to reveal a shiny new paperback, La Pierre et 
la Foi, by Noah de Rocca.  She turned the pages with callused fingers. 
<p>
   "You are a Jew," she announced.  She used the archaic hbreu instead of juif.  I 
hesitated, wondering just what a Jew was in Germaine's mind.  Perhaps it was like a Mason, 
mysterious and powerful.  If so, how would this affect my chances of keeping the apartment? 
<p>
   "Oui." 
<p>
   Germaine pulled a second book from beneath her notes.  It was called Les Juifs et 
l'Empire.  On the cover was a drawing of a king with a large gold cross suspended from his 
neck.  Beside him stood a white-bearded man bearing a staff and whispering in his ear.  The 
kettle lid rattled.  Germaine rose and dropped a few of the nails into a teapot, then added 
water. 
<p>
   I leafed through The Jews and the Empire.  On one page I learned that Christopher 
Columbus came from Spanish Jews living in Genoa.  On another page, a doctor of theology 
in Lucerne argued that Charlemagne had been disastrously counseled by Pre Cordovero, an 
Umbrian Jew masquerading as a Benedictine  friar. 
<p>
   We sipped what looked and tasted like dirt mixed with clam juice.  Germaine 
explained to me that the Jews were not only the ancestral Masons, but had reached other 
worlds at key moments throughout history.  She said the contributions of Einstein could only 
have been the result of contact with a higher intelligence in the Triangulum galaxy.  She 
hauled a book from the floor and hunted in it until she found his astrologic chart.  Together 
we pored over the text, which explained that Einstein had been a mediocre student and then 
had inexplicably become the most brilliant physicist of the century.  I hunted up and down 
the column for a synopsis of what Albert had done during the years between his pitiful 
showing in his first year of high school in Aarau and his acceptance of the Nobel prize in 
Stockholm.  I also looked for some mention of the physics think tank in the Triangulum 
galaxy, where diverse life forms cooperated in the spirit of enlightened inquiry.  From what 
Germaine said, the galactic nucleus, defined by its small disk of neutral gas and its three 
averagely bright suns, was an interstellar Los Alamos.  There was nothing about Triangulum 
on our page.  I concluded that Einstein's visiting professorship there was Germaine's own 
contribution to the history of ideas. 
<p>
   She lifted away the pages to where a strip of felt-backed fur marked her place.  On 
the lefthand page Rigaud's portrait of Louis XIV.  The Sun King wore yellow knee garters 
and tomato-red high-heeled sandals.  On the right was his birth constellation.  Dozens of 
planets were diagrammed in their orbits on the morning of September 5, 1638, at 2:38.  
Germaine bent over the chart and explained the correspondences that had governed the life of 
le Roi Soleil.  As far as I knew, Louis XIV was not a Jew.  We had apparently left les 
Hbreux to go about their interplanetary affairs.  Germaine spoke and pointed here and there 
in the packed pages, which linked the Franco-Dutch War, the Great Winter of 1709, and the 
deaths of the beloved Duchess Adelaide of Bourgogne and two of her three sons to sinister 
aspects in Louis' royal sky. 
<p>
   "Will you take over your father's practice?" she asked out of the blue.  I blinked at 
her.  I hadn't mentioned that my father was a doctor.  How could she have known I was 
planning to be an ear, nose, and throat man?  Now that I actually have to decide on a 
specialty, I don't know what to do.  But back then, I just thought of Dad's demanding golf 
schedule and of the way he usually reads American Journal of Otolaryngology on the john 
Sunday evenings, and said to myself, Why not ENT? 
<p>
   But how had Germaine known?  And why had she asked me about my father when we 
were in the end of the seventeenth century?  I told Germaine my plans.  Still she studied me 
intently, as if she hadn't understood my pronunciation of oreille.  For the first time, I 
wondered then if she knew more about my future than I did. 
<p>
   "You are Pisces?" 
<p>
   "Aquarius," I told her.  She nodded as if that was what she'd meant by Pisces. 
<p>
   "You have the courage," she said, "to enter the other." 
<p>
   Other what? I wondered.  But Germaine just left the word floating in the air. 
<p>
   "You possess a transparent soul." 
<p>
   I fingered Germaine's bookmark, which I fervently hoped was rabbit.  I was 
remembering the feel of the tumors, hard as pebbles, beneath Madame Puget's skin when I'd 
washed her each morning in August at Hpital Forcilles.  During those weeks I'd worked in 
the terminal ward, I had felt that my soul was...transparent was as good a word as any.  But 
I'd never thought of this as an advantage. 
<p>
   You cross thresholds of time, Germaine told me now.  My shadowlight bore energy 
seeds.  In particular, if I understood her, I would be good with ailments of the liver.  That 
meant something to me.  I was glad Germaine saw a gastroenterologist in me, even if she was 
officially only a janitor.  I was just getting started studying for MCATs then. 
<p>
   Out in the hall, the elevator groaned and rattled to a halt.  The grillwork doors 
squeaked open, footsteps approached, and a fist pounded Germaine's door.  We sat in silence, 
then Germaine rose and ponderously walked two steps, as if passing down a long corridor. 
<p>
   "Bonjour, Chrie!" 
<p>
   A squash-shaped woman with a bronze helmet of hair peered into the room.  She 
raised her eyebrows high when she saw me, then looked away.  It was as if I were buck 
naked and lying in a feather bed, not sitting at Germaine's table in front of a teacup.  
Shouting, the woman informed us that her toilet was blocked through absolutely no fault of 
her own.  She swore she had put neither grease nor trop de papier down it, and then asked 
whether Chrie, as she again called frowning Germaine, would please call the building 
plumber at once. 
<p>
   "I will see to it," Germaine answered.  She closed the door so quickly the woman had 
to jump back.  Germaine didn't call the plumber at once.  Instead, after the elevator had risen, 
she placed her telephone in a drawer, which she then closed on the cord.  Her fingers 
twitched murderously and her weak eye ping-ponged off the side of her head.  She didn't 
stop frowning until she'd finished a second cup of tea. 
<p>
   "Your mother misses you," she told me.  In French this came out, You are missing to 
your mother. 
<p>
   "But my mother is--" 
<p>
   Germaine dismissed my mother's death with a wave of her hand. 
<p>
   "She will visit you.  I have already contacted her." 
<p>
   I didn't ask what Germaine meant by visit or contacted.  I was afraid to undermine the 
new bond between us.  Now that the topic of plumbing had been so harshly reintroduced by 
the helmet head, I felt much less confident of Beck's and my tenure. 
<p>
   Later in the week, when I brought Germaine one of the delicate bouquets of violet 
skullcaps sold at the Faidherbe-Chaligny mtro exit for twenty francs, she told me more.  As 
soon as Mom's soul had been liberated from Saint Francis' Hospital, it had traveled to the 
sixth Cepheid-type star in the globular cluster Omega Centauri.  From there, Germaine 
gradually led me to understand, Mom had followed my progress through life with earnest, but 
in no way anxious, interest. 
<p>
   None of this surprised me.  I'd known it already, the night Dad picked me up from 
Onkel John and Tante Clara's in Schenectady.  For two weeks I'd been staying in the attic 
room with Curt, going to school with him and Mina.  Onkel John had given me two dollars 
allowance, even though all I did was make my bed and help clear the table.  Dad didn't drive 
up to their house until almost ten o'clock at night.  He helped me pack my duffle bag and 
held my hand all the way home in the car, driving with his left hand the way he always had 
when he wanted to play with Mom's hair.  I didn't have to ask him where she was.  I knew I 
wasn't going to see her anymore, but I also knew that I'd never be without her. 
<p>
   "Come again soon," Germaine told me that first day, when at last she ushered me into 
the hallway. 
<p>
   "With pleasure," I answered, and bowed for the second time in our brief acquaintance.  
Germaine was starved for good manners.  Her lonely days of cleaning and guard duty were 
interrupted only by the offhand greetings of passing tenants. 
<p>
   "You are in love," she told me.  "Walk cautiously in the streets." 
<p>
   I thanked her and told her I would.  She summoned the elevator, which sobbed like a 
wounded beast as it wended its way down from the fourth floor. 
<p>
   "Above all," Germaine told me, "watch for buses." 
<p>

<title>LOVE Enter</title> 
 
<h2>
WINDOW GLASS 
</h2>
 
 
"The cauliflower's fresh," Margot explained, "and not that cabbagy, so that's for the salad.  
The carrots are plenty stiff, but they're not sweet." 
<p>
   So those went into the curry pile along with the tomatoes, which looked fine from 
where I sat.  I sat in the declined empire chair, looking into the balcony window.  We 
listened to a World Saxophone Quartet tape that Margot adored and that I thought sounded 
like sax players making fun of folks who buy cassettes full of squealing nonsense. 
<p>
   I could never make Beck understand how I kept falling in love with both you and 
Margot during those weeks.  It didn't need explaining, I thought.  Every other day or so I sat 
by the window looking through the iron balustrade along the ancient wall of tan-and-amber 
fieldstone, over which grew the dark, cordate leaves of vineyard ivy.  I talked with whichever 
of you was there about whichever of you wasn't.  You were lovely separately and you fit 
together perfectly, not in spite of but because you were tall and Margot was short, you were 
moody and Margot wasn't, you were messy and Margot was a housekeeper, a scientist, and a 
jazz person all rolled into one. 
<p>
   "She's having a tough week," Margot said, chopping all the wrong vegetables.   
<p>
   "Her brother?"  
<p>
   Margot shrugged.  Nathan had been dead for seven years. 
<p>
   "That's part of it.  That's always there." 
<p>
   Her hair hung in black curlicues over the navy sweatshirt she wore three days out of 
four.  When she looked up from the cutting board she lifted her thick eyebrow--her 
monobrow Beck called it--and her eyes drew mine. 
<p>
   "So what do you do?" 
<p>
   "I wait," she told me.  "Bou talks eventually.  When I can't stand it anymore, I rush 
her.  Then we get into these terrific arguments about whether I want to discuss everything 
because I want to be a shrink, or whether she's like the rest of her family and never talks 
about anything difficult.  What bothers her is that I came out to my parents and she hasn't 
and won't.  She's competitive about everything." 
<p>
   I could never think of Margot as being the same age as the rest of us.  She looked a 
whole epoch more mature, the way the senior girls at Arlington High did when I was in ninth 
grade.  Margot made me wish I'd had an older sister back then, so that she could have had 
Margot for a friend.  That way I could have fallen in love with her when I was fourteen and 
she was seventeen, and she could have pretended that it was just a game, while really she 
would have been mad for me, too.  But I didn't have a sister, I didn't meet Margot until I'd 
finished college, and I was fifteen months older than she was. 
<p>
   "She's even competitive with you.  You know she did ballet when she was little, 
before she started riding all the time.  The other day she said she wished she hadn't quit so 
she could take class with you." 
<p>
   "That's not competitive." 
<p>
   "You don't know her," Margot said.  "What she really means is that she wishes she 
could dance better than you."  
<p>
   All at once I saw you.  You were three feet tall, hopping around a lawn in a pink tutu 
over white tights. 
<p>
   "Her riding teacher said she wouldn't improve if she kept missing saddle time.  The 
ballet school said riding would deform her legs." 
<p>
   There you were again, an eight-year-old rider in a hard cap, boots, tiny jodhpurs, like 
a young Princess Anne.  Everything Margot said, I saw instantly.  I had Bou the ballerina, 
Bou the horsy girl.  From what Margot had told me two days before, I especially knew Bou 
the shy Andover junior who didn't go on dates, smelled permanently of manure, and thought 
lesbians were transvestites who smoked cigarettes in holders and flattened their hair with 
brilliantine.  Often that fall I felt like my own medium landlady, Germaine.  I was absorbing 
too much information from sources that were not apparent to me. 
<p>
   "Bou said she didn't care how her legs came out.  When she was six, Mam took her 
down to New York to see this famous rider, Rodney Jenkins.  He was an old friend of 
Mam's, and he took Bou up on his saddle and rode her around the edge of the jump course.  
That was it for ballet.  Only now she's jealous of you." 
<p>
   From the moment I met Margot, I felt as if I'd been in Hebrew school with her every 
Saturday of my life.  Yet I knew I'd never known anyone like her.  She did what she wanted 
to do, she thought about things I'd never heard of, and still she listened to me attentively, 
which made me smarter than I was.  She had quick hands for cooking and touching.  She 
could walk up to wherever I stood and fit herself against me like a cat.  She loved women 
and men. 
<p>
   "Is Beck still having wet dreams?" she asked.  It was after six.  The last of the 
previous night's wine tasted like pencil shavings.  From the once regal chair by the window, I 
could look toward the courtyard and at the same time see Margot reflected in the glass.  The 
window glass aged and mellowed what occurred inside that apartment, like instant barrel 
wood. 
<p>
   "Haven't heard any.  He probably has them after I leave for ballet." 
<p>
   "Does he miss Val?" 
<p>
   "I suppose so.  He talks about her body for hours." 
<p>
   We all gave away each other's secrets, but Beck was difficult to rat on.  His 
confessions were so detailed and personal that there was almost nothing left to give away.  
He'd already informed you and Margot about his earwax problem, the way he bullied his 
mom, what occurred or didn't occur each day in his bowels, the tantrums he threw when his 
dad beat him at tennis, his feverish need to make money, his obsession about women whose 
breasts were widely separated, and his guilt over Ralph Powers, the boy in his fourth grade 
class whose lost eye he felt responsible for, though it had never been conclusively established 
that it had been Beck's jump from the sled that had sent Ralph into a fire hydrant.  The only 
topic about which Beck was stubbornly mute was his brother, Brian.  Still, I did my best. 
<p>
   "He's secretly glad she's in Manchuria," I said.  "Dreaming her has got to be easier 
than dealing with her." 
<p>
   Margot laughed like a silly little girl with a chest cold. 
<p>
   "Valerie," she said, "is truly a pain.  Talk about arrogant." 
<p>
   She took the challah out of the oven and set it on the table.  In the window, the bread 
was golden.  After a moment the air smelled like summer.  I curled deeper into the faded 
needlework roses.  
<p>
   It had been only two weeks and a day since Beck and I had come to Rue Berlioz.  
That night I'd watched over the three of you, then gone and fallen onto the striped bedspread.  
I'd woken in the morning with the bald, eyeless elephant, Phunt, tucked under my chin like a 
violin.  I was sleeping between love and love, you and Margot warming me with your 
bottoms, your backs curled away from me like a pair of wings.  I nuzzled your hair and 
Margot's hair, and before either of you had woken I decided I would stay encamped in that 
nest forever.  I loved the perpetually mild season, and the potential for flight. 
<p>
   "I really only know Valerie from self-defense," Margot told me.  "She was just there 
the first week." 
<p>
   "They threw her out?" 
<p>
   "She wouldn't shut up.  She had the goalie from the soccer team with her.  They did 
Moe and Curly routines with all the little whoops and chuckles when we were learning eye 
jabs.  The instructor asked Val if she thought she could control herself.  She said no and left, 
taking her partner with her.  I think she has an attention problem." 
<p>
   Valerie did sound like the ideal mate for Beck.  It was natural, too, that even at the 
beginning of October, Margot believed that Val's inappropriate behavior indicated an attention 
disorder.  This was right in the beginning of Margot's attention fixation, when she was just 
starting to see everything in terms of her lab job.  She hadn't yet gotten around to dividing up 
all learning activities into global or selective attention categories.  It would be over a month 
before she put those colored cards on everything to increase her French vocabulary, and two 
months before Beck would stay up all night writing dirty limericks on the cards and switching 
them around.  I still can't look at a thick-slice toaster without seeing bright green paper and 
thinking SALT SHAKER (SALIRE, f.) and There once was a boy whore from Ipswich, et 
cetera, in that order. 
<p>
   "Are they going to get hitched?" Margot asked. 
<p>
   "Who knows.  Beck talks." 
<p>
   Margot thought Val was the only woman on earth who could tolerate prolonged 
exposure to Beck, and vice versa.  She told Beck and he agreed.  Beck and Val were both 
overachievers intent on being totally independent together.  He was the musical premed 
meteor, she the soccer and Chinese studies star.  Each was attractive in an overinflated way, 
to judge from the picture of Val on the wall by Beck's cot. 
<p>
   "I'll bet she already has a pair of Chinese boys doing her bidding," Margot said.  
"She's been there two months.  If she wanted Beck, she'd be here." 
<p>
   "She was supposed to come to France with him," I said, pleased that Margot didn't 
know.  "He was going to put off med school and follow her wherever she wanted to live next 
year.  She changed her mind when she got the Fulbright." 
<p>
   People on their way home from work filed down Berlioz.  None of them was you or 
Beck. 
<p>
   "No Westerner has ever been to her town for more than a night.  She couldn't pass it 
up." 
<p>
   "They'll have a lot of use for English, then," Margot said. 
<p>
   She put down her knife and disappeared into the kitchen.  Then she came out along 
the wall, spun on her right foot, and dropped back into her chair with her arms full of green 
peppers and an eggplant.  Margot's figure--her wide hips and low butt, together with her 
breasts which filled her sweatshirt a few inches closer than I ever expected to her suddenly 
narrow waist--her figure gave her the overbuilt, road-hugging grace of an early '70s 
Corvette.  Especially the '72 Stingray coupe. 
<p>
   "He runs downstairs for the mail every day," I contentedly ratted.  "He sends Val long 
letters on Mondays and Saturdays.  They're so thick he has to tape them closed.  Every once 
in a while he gets a postcard from her with big writing." 
<p>
   "The nerve." 
<p>
   "He wants a Paris woman to make him forget.  Or at least help him wait." 
<p>
   I abused Beck as well as I could.  It was my way of forgiving him for the casual put- 
downs he threw my way whenever the four of us were together.  I knew he was just being 
entertaining, but his jibes still hurt.  I was forever playing Zeppo to his Groucho.  I took my 
straight man's revenge. 
<p>
   "He can't find the girl," I said.  "His charms don't translate.  Here he's just a fat guy 
with a red face and a terrible accent." 
<p>
   "What's he usually?" 
<p>
   "Suave and accomplished." 
<p>
   "Oh, come on," Margot said. 
<p>
   She knew I was right.  In English, Beck was physically acceptable and intellectually 
intriguing.  Women found in him a sort of egotistical Yogi Bear, with brains and a trust fund.  
But in French his lunkish form overshadowed his wit.  The foreign women he'd met during 
the summer were not impressed.  He'd first tried his moves on two Austrian substitute nurses, 
Hilde and Berthe, who were perhaps the only two members of the Hpital Forcilles staff not 
to be bowled over by him.  Beck invited them on a day excursion to Versailles, with me 
along to make it look like he wasn't trying to seduce both, or rather either, of them.  The next 
Sunday he took all three of us to lunch on Rue de Paradis, and then to the Muse du Cristal 
to look at the Baccarat perfume bottles which were Berthe's obsession. 
<p>
   It turned out that Berthe was engaged and not kidding about it, and that Hilde was 
frightened of being touched below the waist.  This didn't definitively bother Beck until he 
found out that she was also frightened of touching anyone else below the waist. 
<p>
   "He claims he was busy at Yale." 
<p>
   "Beauty and the Beast appeal," Margot said. 
<p>
   "He told me Val had to fight for him." 
<p>
   "It's true," Margot said.  "I don't understand it, but he was in demand." 
<p>
   Not so in Paris.  For a month I'd watched him try to pick up women in bars, on the 
mtro, at the bank where he could flash his dollars.  Even there he had no luck.  A few days 
after we moved to the city, he met a Dutch philology student at the library at Beaubourg.  
Meanwhile he was dropping in on an Argentine waitress who worked at the tabac on Rue 
Paul Bert.  Neither responded, and in desperation Beck went after an actual native at the BNP 
in Reuilly while drawing on his bottomless credit cards.  I watched him sidle up to the 
prospect, who looked like a slightly elongated Demi Moore, and speak a few words of his 
patois to her.  She told him quite loudly she was not free Friday night.  He didn't understand 
and went after her again.  She broke down and said, in unaccented English, that she would 
never be free, not on a Friday, not on any day of the week.  Beck went home and wrote a 
long letter to Val. 
<p>
   "You don't think he's attractive?" I asked, thrilled. 
<p>
   "He's not my type." 
<p>
   I didn't know how to interpret this. 
<p>
   "Have you ever, you know--" 
<p>
   "Screwed guys?  Sure.  In high school I was with the jazz band director.  He was 
married." 
<p>
   I was immediately granted a picture of a dark, popular, sixteen-year-old Margot in 
faded cords and untucked flannel shirts.  She spent all her time with the boys in the jazz band 
and with the band director.  She had breasts, and she was brilliant at trigonometry.  Margot 
hadn't told me any of this, but it all turned out to be accurate.  My Germaine Lagachian 
powers were not limited to your past alone. 
<p>
   "He said he loved me.  He wanted to get a divorce." 
<p>
   She crushed garlic. 
<p>
   "You were sixteen." 
<p>
   She stepped to the kitchen. 
<p>
   "We would have been cool for a few years, until I graduated." 
<p>
   I saw the young Margot at once, pretty and efficient, making decisions that most 
grown people can't handle.  In the afternoon she did math, had sex, played sax.  She always 
played sax. 
<p>
   "Where would I be now?  In Newton, married to a high school band teacher, that's 
where.  I loved Wayne, but I wasn't a pinhead.  Besides, Dad wanted Yale for me." 
<p>
   Margot and I were from the same background, both middle-class Jewish onlys with a 
hard-wired success wish.  My dad had made it out of Opa and Oma's teetering little house in 
downtown Poughkeepsie to a golfer's split-level in Brentwood.  Hers had made it all the way 
from Jersey City to a dental practice in Massachusetts, with a two-car garage and a boat in 
the driveway.  Margot had told me her dad was so proud of her he could hardly bear to let 
her explain what she'd accomplished last.  He was always too busy trying to repeat the 
success story to Margot's mom.  That was true, even on Thanksgiving of her first year at 
Yale, when Margot was telling him, while she helped cook, that she'd figured out she liked 
sleeping with women.  Bobby was about to say to Miriam, That's our girl.  Instead he turned 
to Margot, offered her a spoonful of cranberry sauce, and said, I don't think there's any reason 
to worry, honey.  This is very common at your age. 
<p>
   I'd never sprung any comparable revelations on Dad and my almost stepmom, Brenda.  
I did startle them when I started taking modern dance five days a week freshman year.  I 
made the switch after I realized that if I trained as hard as I could and didn't injure my knees 
or shins again, I might be the seventh fastest sprinter on the JV squad.  Over the phone, 
Brenda said she loved dance.  Dad was silent, but I could hear him wondering if his great 
nightmare, the Gay Son, was about to be visited upon him. 
<p>
   But my point was that Margot and I were from the same caste, whereas you and Beck, 
well, you know who you are.  Beck says your father's people arrived in New England on a 
wooden boat, swapped beads for Beacon Hill real estate, and settled down to wait for you.  
Meanwhile your mother's folks went on up to New Hampshire, cleared the land and named it 
Logs. 
<p>
   "Did you date guys at Yale?" 
<p>
   "I went out with my physics section leader," Margot said.  She braised eggplant. 
<p>
   "What's this with you and teachers?" 
<p>
   "That's a long story," she said happily.  She obviously had some complicated 
psychological theory about it.  I wallowed deeper in the chair, nursed the wine in my coffee 
cup, and waited.  James Blood Ulmer was on guitar now, making a sound like a litter of 
piglets being tickled. 
<p>
   "I've got time," I told her.  I loved to hear Margot talk sex and psychology.  Her 
theories were like dirty fairy tales for big kids, with the moral built right into the middle.  But 
as it turned out, I didn't have time.  Beck clomped up the stairs and banged on the door. 
<p>
   "Open!" 
<p>
   "No," I said, with feeling.  Margot let him in, cutting knife in hand. 
<p>
   "Peace pipe," Beck told her, guiding the knife to the side.  "Me powwow giant white 
squaw ray long fish over cold waters." 
<p>
   He had another stock tip for you, from his brother at Kidder Peabody. 
<p>
   "She's not home yet," Margot said. 
<p>
   "Go away," I said. 
<p>
   "Never." 
<p>
   He threw his leather saddlebag at me, the one he used all the time, though it weighed 
more than whatever he put in it.  He'd bought it one Sunday at Les Puces for an undisclosed 
sum and thought it was authentic Polish cavalry, circa '38.  I knew it was Andalusian 
contemporary and that he'd been handsomely ripped off by a Frenchman posing as a gypsy.  I 
batted the bag down. 
<p>
   "Where have you been?" 
<p>
   "Working," he said. 
<p>
   This was secret agent talk for sleeping the afternoon away.  I'd finished the worst of 
the cleaning the week before.  Then I'd bought materials to begin repairing the walls, which 
needed to be patched before I painted them.  Beck, in the meantime, had finished the beers of 
Belgium and started on those of Holland.  It wasn't as if he'd been idle. 
<p>
   "How's it hanging, Sweet Cheeks?" he said. 
<p>
   He walked up behind Margot and didn't goose her, it was slower than that.  He 
massaged her ass affectionately for a moment with both hands, grunting to himself in a 
boarish way.  He could do that, just as he could say anything. 
<p>
   "Zubir's got a sister.  Did I tell you?" 
<p>
   "You told us, Beck," I said.  "You tell us every night." 
<p>
   "Zohra doesn't play an instrument, but she's part of the band now.  She comes to all 
our rehearsals just to see me." 
<p>
   Margot rolled her eyes.  Beck had found the bass player, Zubir, on the bulletin board 
at Beaubourg.  There were lots of musicians' cards up, he'd told us, but most were the 
whinings of pathetic basement rock stars.  There in the middle of all the rubbish was a 
message neatly printed in English--M. Zubir Derouiche, bass acoustic.  In research of the 
bebop experience. 
<p>
   "Why didn't you show this morning?  Zubir and I waited for you." 
<p>
   "My J-O-B," Margot said.  "Remember?  I told you about those." 
<p>
   "I'll show you the charts.  We set 'Y.A.T.A.G." 
<p>
   Beck, Margot, and Zubir played together all fall.  They needed a drummer, and the 
trio, christened The Tone Wizards in time for the first of their Thursday gigs at the Tahonga, 
would have been a quartet.  Instead they stayed a threesome, Beck played with his West 
Indian big band, and Margot and Zubir started gigging as a duet at Le Cambridge and King 
Opra Twenty One.  Everyone grew artistically and got paid once in a while. 
<p>
   "Red stuff?" Beck said. 
<p>
   "You were bringing it.  I left you a note." 
<p>
   Beck weakly slapped his forehead. 
<p>
   "I am aweary," he said in brogue. 
<p>
   I dragged myself upright and held out a palm.  This was the way all our disagreements 
were resolved--Beck's money, my time.  Before I was out the door, he had usurped the chair 
and was contentedly listening to Margot's voice and the sounds of saxes and cooking.  I 
understood him and almost forgave him his interruption, but couldn't quite until I ran smack 
into you on the landing. 
<p>
   "Bonk," you said.  You leaned down from the heights of your boots and kissed my 
cheek. 
 
 
I led you back down the stairwell, across the courtyard, and through the gate. 
<p>
   "Wine," I told you, as if the word alone justified not letting you say hello to Margot.  
The cool print of your kiss melted from my cheek in the October breeze.  In the shop on Rue 
Duret you asked advice in French good enough not only to formulate questions, but to 
understand answers.  I had a standing directive from Beck about how much to spend.  We 
would drink three bottles in descending order of value as we lost the power of discrimination.  
You chose a fifty franc Domaine de Villemajou, a white Muscadet for half that, and a vin du 
pays du Var for twelve francs and sous.  The man wrapped our bottles in pieces of white 
paper so they wouldn't catch cold.  I suppose that was his reasoning.  He didn't offer us 
anything as useful as a bag. 
<p>
   It had been a long day.  Ballet was becoming more painful, just when I thought it 
couldn't possibly.  Beck's dormant existence appealed to me, as did your double career as an 
actress and Parisian intellectual.  You'd spent your morning on Boulevard Raspail at a 
seminar on Napoleon's legal, political, and social impact, and how France wouldn't have come 
out looking at all French if it wasn't for him.  Then you'd gone to your acting workshop with 
the enthusiastic but brutally honest Monsieur Jano Hanbowski, Polish dissident playwright- 
director.  He taught drama disguised as dialectics, or was it the other way around?  Now you 
looked culturally aware and refreshed, and I was jealous of your rich interior life.  It made 
me wish I'd been less premed at Syracuse, but I'd graduated and it was too late.  No matter 
how much money I made, no matter what kind of physical shape I kept myself in, I would 
spend my days becoming less and less sophisticated, until I died an unexamined death.  That 
was when you started laughing. 
<p>
   "I'm thinking," you explained, "about the guys on the green motorcycles." 
<p>
   "What?" 
<p>
   "Who suck up dog shit." 
<p>
   "On cycles." 
<p>
   "You don't know," you said, "what I mean." 
<p>
   You held open the door for me and I maneuvered through with the bottles. 
<p>
   "They ride down the sidewalk.  They wear green overalls with Des Trottoirs Nets on 
the back." 
<p>
   We walked into the last rays of sunlight. 
<p>
   "They wear white helmets," you tried again.  "They hold metal vacuum cleaners down 
over the poop." 
<p>
   Then your sight memory entertained you on a different level and you couldn't talk at 
all.  So much for your intellectual life, I thought.  We stopped beside a bucket of chamomile 
bouquets at the florist's.  I tried to zero in on what you'd seen, but my new powers worked 
better on your childhood than on temporally proximate occurrences.  Your eyes squeezed 
shut.  You hugged yourself and bobbed in place. 
<p>
    "They wear rubber boots," you said.  "They rev their engines.  Water shoots out." 
<p>
   You looked volumes at me. 
<p>
   "They push a button.  That vacuums it back up." 
<p>
   "Right." 
<p>
   "It's like a rug shampooer.  Except for sidewalks." 
<p>
   Tears rolled down your face and right off your chin.  You wrapped your arms tighter 
around yourself and bent over until your nose was between your knees. 
<p>
   "Why not use a shovel?" I asked. 
<p>
   You stood up holding your breath and started forward.  I took rapid baby steps to 
match your pace.  When we stopped next, it was in front of Giorgio's, where a yellow belt 
cost a lot, I remember that.  You wiped your eyes with the hand that wasn't clutching my 
arm.  Then you started taking full steps and I held on to the bottles for dear life.  We zoomed 
across Avenue de Malakoff and through into Berlioz.  I still don't know how you managed to 
see through your laughter and catch that bottle, the Villemajou of course, when it finally 
slipped its wrapper and headed for the stone.  But you did, and so it was the two of us who 
landed on the cobbles, side by side, under the linden tree in love.

GHOST MUSCLE		10/28/92 * 05:12	BOU.DOC 
</b>
</pre>
 
 
Through the narrow window, the New Orleans dawn is orange and rose.  I'm tapping away, 
alone and wide awake for once.  Delivery has been quiet since an hour ago when Laskin, 
Boy, slid effortlessly through his mother's birth canal as if on a toboggan run.  Not so last 
night at around ten when Joel Nash and I performed three deliveries, two hitchless, the last 
one outlet forceps, in a single athletic hour.  When that third baby decided not to be born, we 
paged Jennifer Sandler, but she was busy in OR with the attending, Gus Grant.  Joel and I 
were on our own. 
<p>
   Joel's my fellow fourth-year subintern, along with Steve Tsintolas.  Joel would be a 
doctor by now if he weren't on a full ride with Uncle Sam.  In his second year, Army 
shanghaied him to Saudi where he did nothing, from what he says, except learn to make all 
kinds of macrobiotically acceptable foods.  He's a nonlacto-ovovegetarian, and though born 
Baptist is a self-proclaimed Buddhist.  He looks like a cross between Colonel Sanders and 
Yoko Ono.  He has Yoko's features and her hair except blond, but he has the colonel's smile 
and twinkly blue eyes. 
<p>
   Last night he briefly attempted a vacuum-assisted delivery.  This is a procedure in 
which a device like a sterile plunger attached to a pump is planted on the baby's head.  To 
put it crudely, one draws the unwilling infant onto the great, peopled stage of life with 
something resembling a Hoover Convertible.  The problem is the suction doesn't always hold, 
and when it does, the baby isn't always pleased.  Like last night.  The baby's head was barely 
crowning with each contraction, then disappearing again, in a most provocative manner.  Joel 
gingerly applied the rubber bell, but as soon as I turned on the pump, the kid's pulse dropped 
to seventy.  We removed the cup and the baby's heart rate came right back up.  Joel was 
slower to recover, having turned as pale as one of those slabs of tofu he eats with soy and 
chopped scallion. 
<p>
   Just then the dreaded Dr. Grant arrived from surgery, took one look at Joel, and sat 
him in the corner.  I had the forceps in my hand, and I was too worried about what I was 
going to do with them to care about the boss.  Joel always has time to worry about Grant 
because Joel's a white southerner, while Grant's an African-American southerner.  Grant 
turned his impatient eyes on us, his lips twisting with dissatisfaction before we could even tell 
him what had happened, and Joel quaked like a schoolboy.  I didn't care.  I'm a Yankee. 
<p>
   There were no more decelerations once we got the vacuum off, but there also wasn't 
much progress with the mother's pushes.  We had an asynclitism, which is when the baby's 
head hits the floor of the birth canal at the wrong angle.  I held the left forceps blade in my 
palm like a violin bow, then guided it into position with my right glove.  That was only about 
as hard as reaching into the trunk of a car packed tight for a camping trip and finding a jar of 
peanut butter.  Then I placed the spoon of the right blade in front of the baby's other ear.  
This was tougher, more like going back into the trunk in the dark and coming up with two 
slices of unsquashed bread.  Luckily the mom, Judy, who was only twenty-four but was 
having her third, did all she could to help me.  She said I was doing just fine.  Once it was 
clear her baby wasn't in distress, she even asked Joel if he was feeling better.  I thought that 
was a nice gesture. 
<p>
   Her introitus was distended like the mouth of a fish, not soft the way you'd expect.  
Between contractions the baby's head jammed up against her perineum so tight I could feel 
the ridge of the eyebrows.  To my amazement, I closed the forceps.  Grant checked their 
placement, then I started the gentlest traction Charity Hospital has ever witnessed.  I wasn't 
moving that baby at all, just standing there sweating, all my chest muscles in a knot.  The 
head started to move, slowly, and lined up all right.  I knew where the baby was, even though 
I couldn't see it.  I could sense it pivoting in there.  Grant whispered that I should have done 
an episiotomy and that I'd better do one now.  Kate held the forceps while I gave Judy a shot 
of lidocaine and then, under Grant's guidance, carefully made the cut. 
<p>
   I took the forceps again, but I still wanted to let the baby come out by itself.  I bent 
my knees to get the gentlest angle of leverage, and tried not to let Grant see that I wasn't 
doing anything.  I leaned over the invisible baby and prayed to it to hurry up.  With the next 
contraction the head came all the way clear, facing down toward Judy's bottom.  I thought I'd 
done it.  Then Judy's perineum snapped shut around that baby's neck, as if there were a ghost 
between her legs trying to strangle it. 
<p>
   I froze.  The baby wasn't breathing yet, was still on the umbilical cord, but for a 
endless second I forgot that.  The next contraction didn't arrive.  Grant opened the forceps 
and carefully removed them from the baby's head.  Then he pried the handles out of my 
numb hands, while I tried with telepathy to help Judy figure out in what direction to make the 
baby go.  Grant lifted Judy's feet out of the stirrups and guided her knees up and apart.  The 
whole room closed in.  Joel and Kate were telling Judy, Push! Push!  I could hardly hear 
them.  Judy, the baby, and I, we were all waiting to be born together, the baby from Judy, 
Judy from time, me from that silent place where I stood. 
<p>
   Another inch of the baby's neck appeared and my ears opened.  Grant placed Judy's 
feet back in the stirrups.  The left shoulder worked free.  Kate and Grant came in closer and I 
made a basket of my hands and forearms.  The baby's right shoulder popped clear, and with a 
squirt the whole creature followed.  She lay in my hands and on my arms, her hair matted, 
her nose chafed and flat.  I saw the red pucker of her pudendum and realized that I'd known 
all along that she was a girl, though there was no way I could have known. 
<p>
   Grant took her from me.  Kate clamped and cut the umbilical cord.  I stood still.  Joel 
was back on his feet, and he and Grant worked on the baby.  Kate cleaned up Judy and told 
me to sit down. 
<p>
   On his way out, Grant said I'd done fine.  That was all.  No wonder Joel's scared of him.

<h2>Motivation</h2>
To provide a model for <i>personal reviews</i> of a current field, by
serving up a set of links, with commentary, to electronically-available
documents across the Web.<p>

To develop hypertext as an alternative or supplement to current 
materials in physics instruction.<p>

<h2>Starting Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="FT_Numerical.html">Numerical Field Theory</A>
<li><A HREF="FT_Thermal.html">Thermal Field Theory</A>
<li><A HREF="CM.html">Classical Mechanics</A>
</ul>

<b>To navigate upwards, use the links at the bottom of the page, if any.</b>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<i>ph</i> is the outcome of discussions with Paul Mende and Gerry Guralnik
concerning the electronic dissemination of physics research, and the
role or possibility of peer review.<p>

<i>I am revisiting</i> ph <i> after a two-year hiatus.  Please excuse
any disorganization.</i><p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
At least at present, <i>ph</i> contains only my opinions, which are in
no way connected with those of Brown University, or the Physics Department
at Brown University.  Your commentary is invited, and should be sent

<P>
<STRONG>Currently, in the field of medicine and pharmacy practice, there is no 
acknowledged knowledge-database on pharmacotherapy that pharmacists and 
pharmacy students can use. We need a well-developed knowledge system from 
which most pharmacists and pharmacy students can obtain valuable and 
objective information regarding patient's rational drug therapy.<BR>
This information system will be produced in a multimedia form to achieve 
user-friendly interface and to improve comprehensiveness of information. 
Therefore, our center has decided to establish "Multimedia Pharmacotherapy 
Information System."</STRONG>

<TITLE>Welcoming Address by Director</TITLE>

<H2>Welcoming Address by Director</H2>

Korea is undergoing a rapid change as it tries to adopt the open-door policy, to work side-by-side with other advanced nations, and be a part of today's information super highway. It is predicted that Korea will experience even further changes during the remaining few years of the twenty-first century. The driving force behind all these changes is the information industry which was built on the basis of fast growing scientific techniques.

<BR><P>

Therefore, in order to remain competitive in each professional field, one needs to obtain the latest, the most up-to-date information to appropriately manage and utilize them. Especially professionals in the medical and pharmaceutical fields, where tons of new information are coming out each year, need to develop a way to efficiently digest and utilize these new information.

<BR><P>

Because of easy access to the information network and very affordable PC and CD-ROM, each person can easily obtain information unlike before. However, currently the medical professionals are not actively taking advantage of them and utilization of drug information service is far below that of the advanced countries. Drug therapy is an integral part of medical treatment and the success of drug therapy lies in knowing accurate information about drugs and appropriately utilizing them. Thus, utilization of drug information by the health professionals has a direct impact on the quality of medical treatment. In order for the health professionals to appropriately utilize necessary drug information, pharmacists with expertise in drug therapy need to provide such information. With this very thought in mind, the Sookmyung Drug Information Center was established after a long and hard preparation in order to provide fast and accurate drug information service to pharmacy students, educators, practitioners and researchers in nation.

<P>
IDIS SYSTEM/Microfiche is a database of index records to drug and drug therapy articles from medical and pharmaceutical journals. Clinically relevant journal articles are indexed by pharmacists, added to the IDIS database, and sent to subscribers on a monthly basis.
<P>
IDIS indexes are available from Iowa Drug Information Service on microfiche(IDIS SYSTEM/Microfice) or compact disc(IDIS SYSTEM/CD-ROM), or online(IDIS SYSTEM/Online) through database vendors BRS and Data-Star.
<P>
Each month an update consisting of drug and disease indexs to journal articles is generated. The microfiche and CD-ROM versions fo IDIS SYSTEM also contain the indexed articles on microfiche. Drug and disease indexes are cumulataed monthly from January through December of each year for microfiche, cumulated from January 1985 on CD-ROM, and cumulated from 1966 for online.
<P>
Microfiche subscribers receive a monthly update. Drug and disease indexes from the previous month are replaced with the new cumulative indexes. Article microfiche are added to the file each month to create, a permanent, expanding database.
<P>
<STRONG>Journal Selection</STRONG>
<P>
Medical and pharmaceutical journals, reflecting a cross-section of clinically oriented journals conraining articles about drugs and drug therapy in humans, are the basis for the IDIS databases. Subject specialization and journal quality are considered when selecting journals for the databases.
<P>
The journals indexed are reviewed and evaluated with additions and deletions made in order to maintain representative coverage of most areas of current therapeutics.
<P>
<STRONG>Article Selection</STRONG>
<P>
An article must be relevant to drugs or drug therapy in humans to be indexed. In general, an article is indexed if a drug is discussed and specific information is presented about the drug or its use in therapeutics.

IPA began in 1964 as a print service and became computerized in 1970. The chief purpose of the database is to review and present pharmaceutical literature and coverage includes clinical and technical drug information, pharmacy practice, pharmaceutical education, and legal aspects of pharmacy and drugs. 
<P>
ASHP scans over 750 journals published worldwide for information to be added to IPA. In 1988, IPA began including abstracts of papers presented at ASHP's major meetings, and will eventually begin adding abstracts of approved Masters and Doctor theses for degrees affered through schools of pharmacy.
<P>
All U.S. state pharmacy journals are included as well as most publications on cosmetics. ASHP's selection criteria has no restrictions as to language of article and journal size or obscurity. Letters, editorials, comments and other items that feature significant pharmaceutical information are also abstracted and indexed.

        Recommended Regimen / Comments:
                Patient may need  long term parenteral nutrition because  of her hyperemesis 
disturbing oral 
        intake of nutrients.
                Patient's energy  and protein requirement are  2,087kcal and 89.5mg  daily to 
keep healthy 
        maternal body normal growth of fetus.
                This  requirement will  be met  by supplying  two bottles  of the  following 
formula,
                                amino acid 8.5%         500ml
                                dextrose 50%   500ml
                                vitamins, electrolytes    qs
                                trace elements 

                                                +1,000ml
                This regimen will give patient 2,050kcal of energy and 85gm of protein daily. 
Therefore, 
        occasional small food  supplements are encouraged to  make up the remaining calorie 
and protein      requirement. In addition, 10% fat emulsion (twice weekly) is recommended to 
supply essential fatty 
        acids. Thank you allowing us follow this patient.         Tom Shin, Pharm.D.

        Recommended Regimen / Comments:
                In  considering patient's  severe  hepatic failure  and  malnutrition, adequate 
parenteral nutrition 
        with  high BCAA(branched  chain amino  acid) content  is recommended  to prevent 
possible encepha-
        lopathy and further muscle breakdown. 
                Patient's  calorie and  protein  requirement are  1355  kcal and  66 g  daily, 
respectively and can be 
        met     ideally by supplying 2 bottles of the following formula,
                                Hepatamine                                      8% 500ml                            
                dextrose 50%   500ml

                                                +1,000ml
                This regimen on NPO basis will give patient sufficient energy and protein of 
2014 kcal and 76g 
        daily.  However, close  monitoring about  hepatic  metabolism should  be maintained, 
especially blood 
        amino acid  profile to ensure  normal aromatic/branced chain amino  acids balance in 
CNS.                                                           Tom Shin, Pharm.D.

        Recommended Regimen / Comments:
                Considering low  serum albumin and  lymphocyte count in spite  of adequate 
muscle and fat 
        reserve, patient is supposed to be at risk of infection.
                To  keep patient's  immunocompetence and  adequate  muscle mass,  patient 
should be given 
        enough calories and protein.
                As far  as high  dose steroid therapy  continues, patient protein  requirement 
will be also high. 
        Thus, additional protein should be added to current regimen.
                This will be met by one more bottle of the following formula,
                                Plasol 5%       500ml(protein 25g/300kcal)        
                                        or
                                Any  other  amino  acid  solution  containing   protein  and 
calories more than 30g and 
                                        226 kcal.
                Close monitoring for metabolic change secondary to steroid therapy should be 
maintained.
                Occasional Intralipid (once a week) is  also recommended to prevent essential 
fatty acid 
        deficiency on long term therapy.

<H2><B>Message from the Dean</B></H2>
<IMG SRC = "/images/rain_lin.gif"><BR><P>
<STRONG>Welcome to the World Wide Web page of the
College of Pharmacy, Sookmyung Women's University. The College has strived
for high quality of pharmacy education and is now taking the leading role of
advancing pharmaceutical sciences and developing clinical pharmacy education
and practice in nation.<p>
The College is offering well-designed 4-years
bachelor program and graduate programs leading to master and doctoral degrees
in 9 areas.<p>
We are very proud of having the only professional school in nation, the
Graduate School of Clinical Pharmacy and the first campus-based drug
information center, both of which are affiliated with the College.<p>
Our curriculum at all levels strongly emphasizes on the development of new
drugs and clinical knowledges and skills for rational drug utilization for
better patient care in society.<p>
On behalf of the faculty, students, and
staff of the College of Pharmacy, I am proud to share with you our academic
achievements and successes. I am sure that the College will continue to keep
the leading role in educating the next generation of pharmacy practitioners
and scientists.</STRONG>

Anne E. Martin and Patricia A. Montgomery
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and clinical efficacy of acarbose, a new antidiabetic agent, are reviewed. Acarbose reversibly inhibits intestinal alpha-glucosidases, enzymes responsible for the metabolism of complex carbohydrates into absorbable monosaccharide units. Thiscation results in a diminished and delayed rise in blood glucose following a meal, resulting in a reduction in post-prandial hyperglycemia, area under the glucose concentration-time curve, and glycosylated hemoglobin. Other effects include a reduction in postprandial insulin and variable changes in plasma lipid concentrations. In placebo-controlled trials, acarbose caused significant improvements in glycemic control indicators, including glycosylated hemoglobin. Acarbose has demonstrated additional glycemic control when added to other antidiabetic therapies, including sulfonylureas and insulin. Efficacy of acarbose appears to be comparable to or slightly less than that of sulfonylureas or metformin, although it has not been compared with maximal doses of these agents. The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions with acarbose are abdominal pain, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, diarrhea, and flatulence, which tend to lessen with time. Acarbose may affect the bioavailability of metformin and may be less effective when used in conjunction with intestinal adsorbents and digestive enzyme preparations. Concurrent use with hypoglycemic agents (sulfonylureas and insulin) may cause an increased frequency of hypoglycemia. Acarbose should start at 25 mg one to three times daily given with the first bite of each main meal and should be adjusted to a maximum of 50 mg three times daily for heavier patients. Acarbose may be considered for first-line antidiabetic therapy in certain patients and may be useful as combination therapy in selected instances. Acarbose is efficacious in improving metabolic control in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Further evaluation of itseffects on the long-term complications of diabetes is needed.<BR>

Larisa M. Humma
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therapy recommended for preventing and treating drug-resistant tuberculosis is discussed. Drug-resistant strains of <I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</I> can be transmitted by an infected individual, or resistance can be acquired during therapy for drug-susceptible disease. At least until susceptibility test data are available, the recommended initial treatment for tuberculosis consists of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and either ethambutol or streptomycin. Resistance has led to variations on this regimen that sometimes include more toxic alternative drugs, including ethionamide, aminosalicylic acid, cycloserine, and capreomycin, as well as ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Drug regimens used for retreatment usually include the alternative drugs. Success in treating drug-resistant tuberculosis varies. Therapy to prevent resistant tuberculosis is recommended for any individual with a positive skin-test result and any of the following: infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), close contact with a newly diagnosed patient, recent conversion to a positive skin-test result, or a predisposing medical condition. Although isoniazid is the only drug with FDA-approved labeling for use as prophylaxis in patients with latent tuberculosis, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests several teo-drug combinations. Fluoroquinolones are recommended for both treatment and prevention Patient compliance and HIV infection are special issues in managing resistant tuberculosis. Drug-resistant tuberculosis is a growing problem that must be addressed through appropriate prophylactic and treatment measures.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The extent and sources of trace-element contamination during simulated manual and automated compounding of total parenteral nutrient (TPN) solutions were studied. Four experimental groups were prepared: (1) sterile water for injection as received from the manufacturer, (2) TPN bags manually filled with sterile water for injection, (3) TPN bags automatically filled with sterile water for injection, and (4) sterile water for injection manually added directly to sample vials (i.e., bypassing the TPN bag). After the bags had been stored for 16 hours at 4 <SUP>o</SUP>C, samples were analyzed for 66 trace elements by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Of the 66 trace elements analyzed for, 3 (zinc, boron, and aluminum) were present as contaminants in each of the experimental groups. Very low background concentrations of zinc, boron, and aluminum were found to contaminate the sterile water as received from the manufacturer. Simulated compounding (manual or automated) in TPN bags did not contribute additional boron or aluminum but sis result in a mean total zinc concentration of 35.4 ug/L; of this, 12.4 ug/L came from  the compounding equipment, 9.1 ug/L from the TPN bag, and 13.9 ug/L from the sterile water for injection. Although the amount of zinc contributed by compounding was significantly higher than the background level, the amount was inconsequential compared with that needed to satisfy physiological requirements. Simulated compounding of TPN solutions either manually or with an automated system contributed minimal trace-element contamination.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The stability of drugs commonly prescribed for use in oral liquid dosage forms but not commercially available as such was studied. Labetalol hydrochloride 40 mg/mL, metoprolol tartrate 10 m/gmL, verapamil hydrochloride 50 m/gmL, and spironolactone 5 mg/mL plus hydrochlorothiazide 5 mg/mL were prepared in a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Sweet and Ora-Plus (Paddock Laboratories), a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Sweet SF and Ora-Plus (Pad-dockLaboratories), and cherry syruo and placed in polyethylene terephthalate bottles. The sources of the drugs were tablets. Six bottles were prepared per liquid; three were stored at 5 <SUP>o</SUP>C and three at 25 <SUP>o</SUP>C, all in the dark. A samplewas removed from each bottle initially and at intervals up to 60 days and analyzed for drug concentration by stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography. At least 91% of the initial drug concentration was retained in all the oral liquids for up to 60 days. There were no substantial changes in the appearance or odor of the liquids, or in the pH. Labetalol hydrochloride 40 mg/mL, metoprolol tartrate 10 mg/mL, verapamil hydrochloride 50 mg/mL, and spironolactone 5 mg/mL plus hydrochlorothiazide 5 mg/mL in three oral liquids compounded extemporaneously from sweetenedvehicles and tablets were stable for up to 60 days when stored without light at 5 and 25 <SUP>o</SUP>C.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The stability of levofloxacin in 10 commonly used infusion fluids was studied. Levofloxacin 25-mg/mL injection was diluted to 0.5 and 5 mg/mL in each of the following i.v. infusion fluids: 0.9% sodium chloride injection, 5% dextrose injection, 5% dextrose and 0.9% sodium chloride injection, 5% dextrose and lactated Ringer's injection, 5% sodium bicarbonate injection, Plasma-Lyte 56 and 5% dextrose injection, 5% dextrose and 0.45% sodium chloride and 0.15% potassium chloride injection, 1/6 M sodium lactate injection, sterile water for injection, and 20% mannitol injection. Ten polyvinyl chloride bags were prepared for each solution; two were stored for 3 days at 25 <SUP>o</SUP>C, two for 7 days at 5 <SUP>o</SUP>C, two for 14 days at 5 <SUP>o</SUP>C, two for 13 weeks at -20 <SUP>o</SUP>C followed by 14 days at 5 <SUP>o</SUP>C, all in the dark. The solutions were visually examined, tested for turbidity and particulate matter, and subjected to stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography; solution pH was determined. Levofloxacin was stable in and compatible with all but two of the diluents tested. Precipitation occurred under all conditions in 20% mannitol injection for the 0.5-mg/mL levofloxacin concentration and after storage for 13 weeks at -20 <SUP>o</SUP>C for the 5-mg/mL concentration. Levofloxacin 0.5 mg/mL in 5% sodium bicarbonate injection formed a precipitate when stored at -20 <SUP>o</SUP>C for 13 weeks and beyond. Levofloxacin 0.5 and 5 mg/mL was compatible with and stable in 8 of the 10 infusion fluids studied. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We conducted a case-control study based on computer-recorded information accrued in the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database to assess and compare the relation between different antihypertensive drug therapies and myocardial infarction in patients with no known clinical or laboratory risk factors for myocardial infarction other than hypertension. Cases were treated hypertensive patients with no other known risk factors who developed a first acute myocardial infarction between January 1, 1993, and October 31, 1994. They were ascertained from a review of the clinical record together with a questionnaire filled out by the attending general practitioner. Controls were matched to each case for age, sex, general practice, and index date. Antihypertensive therapy was derived from the computerized patients record. The study consisted of 210 cases and 793 controls. Compared with users of B-blockers alone, the adjusted relative risk (RR) estimates for all other treatment regimens were close to 1.0. A comparision of users of calcium channel blockers alone with users of B-blockers alone yielded a RR estimate of 0.9 (95% CI 0.5, 1.7). We conclude that the risk of acute myocardial infarction in otherwise healthy, treated hypertensive patients is not materially associated with the particular drug they receive.<BR>

Audrey Jade Lee, Pharm.D.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Metformin is an oral antihyperglycemic agent that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. It differs from the sulfonylureas in that it is does not enhance insulin secretion and normally does not produce hypoglycemia. Metformin acts to decrease preprandial and postprandial blood glucose concentrations by increasing skeletal muscle uptake of glucose, decreasing gluconeogenesis, and  decreasing absorption of glucose. The addition of metformin to maximum dosages of a sulfonylurea may synergistically improve glucose control. The drug may offer other potential benefits, such as weight loss or minimal weight gain, improved blood flow in patients with peripheral vascular disease, reduction of tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor, and improved lipid profiles. It is relatively safe if taken appropriately. Its most common side effects are gastrointestinal (nausea, diarrhea, anorexia), metallic taste, and  vitamin B12 malabsorption. Lactic acidosis may also occur, but it is rare if metformin is avoided in patients with contraindications to its use. With careful monitoring, the agent may be considered for the initial treatment of obese patients who fail dietary measures, and those whose disease is refractory to maximum dosages of sulfonylureas or who do not tolerate them.<BR>

Mollie A. Scott, Pharm.D., Penny S. Shelton, Pharm.D., and Wendy Gattis, Pharm.D.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Major depression is a debilitating disorder that is often undertreated. Psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, and pharmacotherapy are options for management. Tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the cornerstones of drug therapy. Venlafaxine, a phenylethylamine antidepressant that primarily inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin, is an alternative to those agents. It has been studies in short-term and continuation studies and appears to have efficacy similar to that of imipramine, trazodone, and fluoxetine. Moreover, venlafaxine is effective in approximately one-third of patients with treatment-resistant depression. Venlafaxine is metabolized by the P-450 enzyme system to an active metabolite O-desmethyl-venlafaxine, which is excretel renally. Nausea, somnolence, and dizziness are dose-related adverse effects that often occur with initiation of therapy. Increases in blood pressure, paticularly with high dosages, also may occur. Drug-drug interactions appear to be minimal.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Androgen deprivation is the most effective therapy for patients with advanced prostatic carcinoma. The lack of androgen stimulation on these cells causes them to become apoptotic. Although therapeutic efficacy of initial androgen deprivation in prostate cancer is high, the emergence of androgen-independent cancer is inevitable. Withdrawal of the antiandrogen flutamide elicits surprising activity in these cancers. In numerous studies the response rates cell line harbors a mutation in codon 877 of the androgen receptor. The mutant receptor loses androgen specificity and is activated by various steroids as well as flutamide. Identical and similar mutations have now been isolated from human prostate cancer tissue. The discovery of the mutated androgen receptor sheds light on the emergence of androgen-independent cancer and should facilitate the development of more efficacious therapies.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The incidence of spinal cord injury (SCI) in the United States is approximately 10,000 new cases per year. Strategies to prevent injury or salvage a few dermatomal levels may have significant effects on outcome. Several pharmacologic agents have been evaluated for their efficacy in patients with acute SCI. Methylprednisolone, when administered early, was the first drug to show significant improvement in outcome and is a standard of comparison for future agents. Several new drugs show promising results in aniaml models of SCI, with more extensive human trials currently under way. Results of more well-controlled clinical trials are necessary to determine which agents have significant neurologic benefits.

Sue Lyon Mertl, Pharm.D.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Clarithromycin is a first-line agent in the treatment of disseminated disease due to Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (dMAC) in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and its role in dMAC prophylaxis is nearing definition. Fifteen abstracts described clinical outcoms when clarithromycin was given in various dosages as monoprophylaxis or in combination with other agents. Patients totaled 1063, the majority of whom had CD4+ counts of 100 cells/mm<SUP>3</SUP> or below. In one study, MAC disease occurred in 4.5% of 343 clarithromycin-treated patients compared with 12.6% of 341 receiving placebo (p<0.001). The remaining studies combined to report only two positive blood cultures, one positive sputum culture, and one positive culture of unidentified origin during their respective study periods. Gastrointestinal intolerance caused discontinuation of therapy in 21 (2.9%) of 722 patients receiving clarithromycin. Clinical evaluations show that the drug decreases the risk of dMAC. prolongs survival, and is well tolerated.<BR>

Janice S. Liao, Pharm.D., and William G. Reiss, Pharm.D.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The immune system is a complex network that regulates and maintains the host's defense system. Changes and alterations in the immune system precipitate a series of reactions to prevent further damage as well as initiate repair. The system's cellular component relies on cytokines (interleukins, tumor necrosis factor, interferons, etc.) to facilitate communication in response to a foreign antigen. Cytokine concentrations are therefore elevated during times of inflammation, such as rejection of a transplanted organ. Recent research suggests that interleukin-6 may have an inhibitory effect on cytochrome P-450 3A and thus affects drug metabolism. Cyclosporine, which is administered to prevent rejection of transplanted organs, is metabolized primarily by the P-450 3A system. Thus, the inhibitory effect of interleukin-6 may alter cyclosporine concentrations, which in turn may increase its adverse effects, such as nephrotoxicity.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Several case reports of resistance to short-term administration of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (NNMBAs) have been reported in research and surgical settings. Recently, several reports documented resistance to NNMBAs during therapy for prolonged paralysis in critically ill patients. Adverse outcoms associated with NNMBA resistance may include inadequate ventilatory management or suppression of patient movement, and an increased risk of dose-dependent cardiovascular adverse effects. Pharmacoeconomic issues must be considered in that the cost of NNMBA therapy in a resistant patient may be significant. Although the specific etiologies of resistance are not clear, several pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic alterations may occur as a consequence of disease state or concomitant drug therapy. Pharmacodynamic changes include altered acetylcholine receptor physiology or sensitivity, inhibition of serum cholinesterase activity, and interaction with plasma constituents. Alterations in distribution volumn, protein binding, and clearance may also contribute to resistance in several disease states.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Study Objectives.</B> To determine of low-dose lovastatin in combination with niacin causes a greater percentage reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol than lovastatin alone, and to determine if the combination increases the risk of serious  adverse effects.<BR>
<B>Design.</B> Prospective, randomized, open-level, clinical trial.<BR>
<B>Settings.</B> Family medicine clinic of a university-affliated hospital.<BR>
<B>Patients.</B> Patients with fasting LDL cholosterol concentrations of at least 150 mg/dl after 4 weeks of dietary stabilization and washout of any cholesterol-lowering drugs.<BR>
<B>Interventions.</B> Twenty-eight patients received lovastatin 20 mg/day for 4 weeks after dietary stabilization and washout. If LDL cholosterol remained above 130 mg/dl (100 mg/dl in patients with coronary artery disease), they were randomized to receive either lovastatin 40mg/day or a combination of lovastatin 20 mg/day and niacin 500 mg 3 times/day.<BR>
<B>Measurements and Main Results.</B> There was no difference in actual or percentage reductions of LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides between the groups. A greater increse in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol occurred with combination therapy (p=0.024). There was no difference in liver function tests, glucose, or uric acid between the therapies. Based on drug-acqusition cost, combination therapy is approximately 40% less expensive than monotherapy.<BR>
<B>Conclusion.</B> Low-dose niacin plus low-dose lovastatin was as effective as higher-dose lovastatin in lowering total cholesterol, LDL, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. The combination may offer benefit in raising HDL cholesterol levels.<BR>

<B>Study Objective.</B> To compare the pharmacokinetics of a single 100-mg oral dose of itraconazole administered as 10 ml of 10-mg/ml itraconazole solution in hydroxypropyl-Beta-cyclodextrin under fasting versus postprandial conditions.<BR>
<B>Design.</B> Open-label, two-way, randomized, crossover study.<BR>
<B>Setting.</B> Janssen Research Foundation, Belgium.<BR>
<B>Patients.</B> Twelve healthy volunteers.<BR>
<B>Interventions.</B> Blood samples were obtained for pharmacokinetic analyses immediately before dosing and at regular intervals up to 96 hours after each dose. Blood and urine samples were obtained for hematologic, biochemical, and urinary safety analyses at baseline and at the end of the study.<BR>
<B>Measurements and Main Results.</B> The mean peak plasma concentrations of both itraconazole and its active metabolite hydroxy-itraconazole were significantly higher under fasting conditions than under postprandial conditions. The mean times to peak concentration for both the parent compound and its metabolite were significantly shorter under fasting than under nonfasting conditions. The mean areas under the curve (AUC<SUB>0-inf</SUB> and AUC<SUB>0-24 hrs</SUB>) were also significantly higher under fasting than under postprandial conditions.<BR>
<B>Conclusions.</B> Our findings suggest that the higherbioavailability of this new formulation of itraconazole may be of benefit in seriously ill patients who are not able to ingest adequate quantities of blood. The fact that the solutionwas also well tolerated and was not associated with clinically significant changes in any laboratory value further underscores the potential utility of this dosing form.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We determined the effect of cocaine on ventricular vulnerability to fibrillation, as measured by ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT), and cardiac electophysiology in 20 anesthetized dogs with normal hearts. Animals were randomized in blinded fashion to receive a continuous 3-hour infusion of cocaine 0.11 mg/kg/minute (total dose 20 mg/kg) or placebo (lactose dissolved in normal saline). The VFT, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, ventricular effective refractory period (ERP), and electrocardiographic intervals were measured at baseline and every 30 minutes during infusion. Baseline mean +/- SE VFT in cocaine and placebo groups was 57.0 +/- 7.8 and 51.8 +/- 7.6 mA, respectively (p=0.64). Cocaine did not significantly decrease VFT, but actually increased it (i.e., reduced ventricular vulnerability to fibrillation) compared with placebo (84.6 +/- 10.4 vs 55.8 +/- 7.2 mA, respectively, at 150 minutes, p=0.04). Cpcaine prolonged ERP and PR, QRS, QT, QTc, JT, and JTc intervals. Cocaine dose not increse ventricular vulnerability to fibrillation in anesthetized dogs with normal intact hearts. Its electrophysiologic effects are similar to those of class I antiarrhythmic agents in this model.<BR>

To determine and describe relationships between plasma cocaine concentrations and electrophysiologic and electrocardiographic effects, 10 anesthetized dogs with normal intact hearts received a continuous 3-hour infusion of cocaine 0.11 mg/kg/minute (total dose 20 mg/kg). Data were collected as part of a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study investigating the effects of cocaine on ventricular fibrillation threshold. Every 30 minutes during infusion of cocaine or placebo and for 3 hours after discontinuation of the infusion, heart rate and mean arterial pressure were determined, effective refractory period (ERP) was measured, and QRS duration and PR, QTc., and JTc intervals were recorded. At the time of each 30-minute measurement, arterial blood was obtained to determine plasma cocaine concentrations. Hysteresis curves were observed for cocaine-induced increases in ERP and PR interval. The effects of cocaine on QRS duration and QTc and JTc intervals were not well described by tested models. Pharmacodynamic modeling techniques may be used to describe relationships between plasma cocaine concentrations and specific cardiovascular effects of cocaine. Further study is required to determine applicability of this model for prediction of cocaine's cardiovascular effects in humans.<BR>

This randomized, open-label study compared the investigational inhalational anesthetic sevoflurane with isoflurane in 47 healthy women undergoing elective ambulatory surgery. The women were randomized to receive either sevoflurane of isoflurane in 60% nitrous oxide-oxygen. Induction with thiopental 3-6 mg/kg was followed by vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg and fentanyl 0-200 ug. Duration of anesthesia, time to emergence, orientation, length of stay in the surgical unit, and hospital discharge were recorded. The emergence, length of stay, and discharge times after discontinuation of sevoflurane were 9.7 +/- 0.7, 120.6 +/- 8.0, and 244 +/- 15 minutes, respectively, and for isoflurane were 11.9 +/- 1.4, 106.8 +/- 7.1, and 282 +/- 24 minutes, respectively (NS). The isoflurane group had a higher frequency of postoperative cough. At the end of surgery, the sevoflurane group received a deeper level of anesthesia (minimum alveolar concentration 1.5 vs 1.3), however, these patients were oriented earlier (13.6 +/- 1.1 min vs 17.0 +/- 1.5 min isoflurane; p=0.02) after discontinuation of anesthesia, although this difference is of little clinical significance.<BR>

James W. McAuley, Ph.D., Frank J. Kroboth, M.D., and Patricia D. Kroboth, Ph.d.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Historically, oral progesterone has been regarded clinically ineffective because of its poor absorption and rapid clearance. Recent evidence suggests that an oral micronized form of natural progesterone is readily absorbed, produces luteal phase serum concentrations, provokes an end-organ response, and has no detrimental effect on the lipoprotein profile. Thus it is considered by many to be an attractive alternative to synthetic progestin. We evaluated the effects of a single oral dose of micronized progesterone 300 mg in eight healthy postmenopausal women. The maximum serum concentration ranged from 15.72-625.98 ng/ml. The extent of absorption increased with increasing age. The reviewed literature and our data indicate considerable intersubject variability in the extent of progesterone absorbed after administration of oral micronized progesterone.<BR>

Three children were receiving ticarcillin-clavulanic acid by continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). Two of them were also receiving concomitant extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We collected ultrafiltrate hourly to determine the clearance of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid by CVVH. Serum concentrations were also determined at the midpoint of each ultrafiltrate collection. All samples were collected over one dosing interval. The volume of distribution of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid was 0.26 +/- 0.01 and 0.69 +/- 0.23 L/kg, respectively. Total body clearance of ticarcillin, determined from the elimination rate constant and volume of distribution, was 0.038 +/- 0.003 L/kg/hour and for clavulanic acid was 0.18 +/- 0.03 L/kg/hour. The sieving coefficients for ticarcillin and clavulanic acid were 0.83 +/- 0.11 and 1.69 +/- 0.19, respectively. We attempted to estimate the clearances by ECMO, but the result was uninterpretable.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A 64-year-old man with narcolepsy could not take stimulant drugs due to coronary heart disease. In the past he noted improvement in alertness when taking codeine for pain, but this was eventually discontinued. After he developed end-stage renal disease, and because the use of stimulants in this setting may be difficult, treatment with codeine was again initiated. This resulted in dramatic improvement in alertness and substantial reduction of cataplexy. Because it is simple to use and familiar to most physicians, codeine may be the drug of choice for narcoleptic patients who are undergoing hemodialysis.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A 42-year-old woman was admintted to the hospital to receive intravenous acyclovir for a herpes zoster infection. At the time she was taking lithium carbonate 450 mg twice/day. Six days after starting acyclovir she exhibited signs of lithium toxicity. When measured, the serum lithium level had increased 4-fold during acyclovir therapy. Both agents are excreted by the kidneys, raising the possibility that acyclovir at high serum concentrations may interfere with the renal excretion of lithium. A MEDLINE search did not identify any citation describing the possibility of an interaction between the drugs. This case suggests that acyclovir when given intravenously in doses of 10 mg/kg may result in increased serum lithium concentrations. Until additional data are available, if intravenous acyclovir is administered concurrently with lithium, we recommend closely monitoring patients for signs of lithium toxicity and measuring serum lithium levels every second or third day.<BR>

Heparin is widely used in current practice for a variety of indications. It is well known that it can cause thrombocytopenia, but not that thrombosis may also develop in thrombocytopenic patients and cause significant morbidity and mortality. A 56-year-old woman developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis that resulted in the amputation of her leg. It is proposed that the reaction has an immune-mediated mechanism. Several ways of diagnosing the condition are available, specifically the serotonin-release assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The investigational agent danaproid may be effective in the treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 120 patients who received an initial prescription of iron from a resident physician in internal medicine to determine how accurately house officers diagnose iron-deficiency anemia before initiating iron therapy. Each patient's laboratory records were reviewed for the 3-month period before the prescription. Of the 120 patients, 77 (64%) did not have any iron tests performed to aid in the diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia. Forty-three percent of those who had iron tests did not have the disorder by our criteria. Ferritin levels and iron profiles are often not measured in patients prescribed iron, and when they are, they are frequently misinterpreted by medical house officers. This can lead to inappropriate gastrointestinal procedures as well as inappropriate prescribing of iron.<BR>

The incidence of bronchial obstruction after bronchiolitis is reduced by early treatment with nebulized <B>SODIUM CROMOGLYCATE[cromolyn sodium]</B> or budesonide, reported researchers from Kuopio University Hospital, Finland. Anti-inflammatory treatment was particularly beneficial in atopic infants, who were noted to be at high risk of bronchial obstruction.<I> Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine 150: 512-517, May 1996</I><P>

Administration of intracoronary<B> DILTIAZEM</B> reduces percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty(PTCA)-induced myocardial ischemia, report researchers from France. This cardioprotective effect allows a longer duration of balloon inflation during PTCA. <I>Clinical Drug Investigation 11: 261-269, May 1996</I><P>

The results of study by researchers in Switzerland showed the administration of <B>MAGNESIUM SULFATE</B> in patients undergoing surgery to be associated with a lower analgesic requirement, less discomfort and a better quality of sleep during the post-operative period. <I>Anesthesiology 84: 340-347, Feb 1996</I><P>

<B>CISAPRIDE</B> reduces duodenoesophageal reflux post-gastrectomy, report researchers from the US. They note that while cisapride has been shown to be effective in reflux in patients with intact stomachs, theirs is the first study to demonstrate the efficacy of cisapride in patients who have undergone gastrectomy. <I>Digestive Diseases and Sciences 41: 754-763, Apr 1996</I><P>

<B>IFOSFAMIDE</B> has activity against both advanced and recurrent endometrial stromal sarcoma, report researchers from the Gynecologic Study Group in the US. They received IV ifosfamide 1.2-1.5 g/m<sup>2</sup> for 5 days every 4 weeks and IV mesna 300 mg/m<sup>2</sup> immediately before and 4 and 8 hours after ifosfamide administration. <I>Obstetrics and Gynecology 87: 747-750, Part 1, May 1996</I><P>

<B>CARBAMAZEPINE</B> may not be effective in children with aggressive conduct disorder, report researchers from the US. Children aged from 5 to 12 years and the initial dosage of carbamazepine was 200 mg/day; this was gradually increased (to a maximum dosage of 1 g/kg). The total duration of therapy was 6 weeks. <I>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry 35: 480-490, Apr 1996</I><P>

<B>PENTOXYFYLLINE</B> successfully treated Behcet's disease, in 3 patients, report Japanese researchers. The patients (aged 17-35 years) received pentoxifylline 600 mg/day for 2 weeks; the dosage was then decreased to 300 mg/day. In addition, neutrophil function improved in all 3 patients. <I>Annals of Internal Medicine 124; 891-893, 15 may 1996</I><P>

A combination of <B>CLONIDINE</B> 150 mcg + <B>LIDOCAINE</B> 40 mg [ lignocaine] provides superior epidural analgesia to clonidine or lidocaine alone, report researchers from the UK and Ireland. <I>Pain 64: 337-343, Feb 1996</I><P>

<B>CLONAZEPAM </B>0.5 mg 3 times daily may be useful for long-term treatment of shooting/shocking phantom limb pain after long-standing total hip disarticulation, say researchers from the US. <I>Clinical Journal of Pain 12: 59-62, Mar 1996</I><P>

Administering <B>SURFACTANT</B> to patients with sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) is of little benefit, conclude researchers from the Exosurf Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Sepsis Study Group. <I>New England Journal of Medicine 334: 1417-1430, 30 May 1996</I><P>

A combination regimen of <B>IDARUBICIN, LOMUSTINE</B> and <B>DEXAMETHASONE</B> is effective in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, according to the preliminary results of a pilot study in the UK. Thirty such patients received oral lomustine 25-50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1, oral idarubicin 10 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day on days 1-3, and oral dexamethasone 10 mg twice daily on days 1-4 of each 4-week cycle.<I> Research and Clinical Forums 18: 87-92, No. 3, 1996</I><P>

DRUG SAFETY WARNINGS<BR>
 []</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<B>CLOMIPRAMINE</B> was not therapeutic in young autistic children, and was commonly associated with adverse effects, according to the results of a pilot study by researchers in the US. Eight hospitalized children aged 3.5-8.7 years were treated with clomipramine 25-250 mg/day for 5 weeks. <I>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry 35; 537-544, Apr 1996</I><P>

The results of a crossover study by researchers in Finland showed <B>AMITRIPTYLINE</B> to effectively relieve pain in the breast scar area and ipsilateral arm of women who had undergone surgery for breast cancer. However, most of women who experienced good pain relief did not want to continue taking amitriptyline due to adverse effects. Administraion of amitriptyline was associated with significantly more tiredness, dry mouth, constipation and sweating. <I>Pain 64: 293-302, Feb 1996</I><P>

It is well known that <B>HEPARIN</B> can cause thrombocytopenia, but not that thrombosis may also develop in thrombocytopenic patients and cause significant morbidity and mortality. A 56- year- old woman developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis that resulted in the amputation of her leg. <I>Pharmacotherapy 16(3): 469-472, 1996</I><P>

High-dose<B> METHOTREAXATE</B> was not associated with any permanent pathological or neurological disorders in young children, according to results of a pilot study conducted by researchers in Norway. <I>Acta Paediatrica 85: 450-453, Apr 1996</I><P>

Janssen Pharmaceutica warned healthcare prefessionals of a new labeling change made regarding the coadministration of <B>CISAPRIDE</B> with any cytochrome CYP3A4 inhibitor. This drug combination is now considered to be contraindicated,because it has the potential to cause serious and potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias. To date, there is evidence that antidepressants such as fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, and nefazodone may markedly inhibit CYP3A4 inhibitors. <I>The Annals of Pharmacotherapy 30: 684, June 1996</I><P>

Cardiomyopathy associated with <B>CLOZAPINE</B>. A patient with a long psychiatric history significant for schizophrenia and no prior cardiac history developed dyspnea, malaise, and edema with a low ventricular ejection fraction during clozapine therapy. <I>Ann Pharmacother 30: 603-5, June 1996</I><P>

Childhood lichen planus in a patient receiving <B>GROWTH HORMONE</B> for dwarfism. A 9-year-old boy was prescribed human recombinant growth hormone 0.5 units/kg intramuscularly for pituitary dwarfism. Three days before the first dose of growth hormone was administered, three brownish pruritic papules developed on his neck. One month later the eruption had spread over the patient's trunk and flexor aspects of the forearms. <I>Dermatol 192: 87-88, 1996</I><P>

<B>PYRAZINAMIDE</B> hypersensitivity. A 46-year-old man developed primary pulmonary tuberculosis. Approximately 1 hour after the first dose of pyrazinamide, the patient developed a pruritic, diffuse, blanching, erythematous rash on his trunk and extremities. <I>Chest 109: 855-856 (Mar) 1996</I><P>

Cutaneous hypersensitivity reaction to <B>MESALAZINE</B>. The patient, who had a recent diagnosis of ulcerative colitis was treated with mesalazine 500 mg orally every 8 hours. Within 48 hours, a pruriginous rash appeared on his neck and the front part of his abdomen. <I>Amer J Gastroenterol 91: 620-621 (Mar) 1996</I><P>

True delayed pressure urticaria induced by human <B>MONOTARD INSULIN</B>. A 40-year-old man had developed diabetes at age 17 years. The patient changed from Neulente insulin to human Monotard insulin and within 6 months of this change began to develop true delayed pressure urticaria. <I>Brit J Derm 134: 184, 1996</B><P>

<B>RISPERIDONE</B>-induced dystonic reaction. The patient, a 33-year-old man with a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, was started on risperidone gradually increased to 3 mg twice daily. On the fourth day he experienced intermittent retrocollis and tonic upward deviation of both eyes for 2 hours and was taken to the emergency room. <I>Amer J Psychiat 153: 577 (Apr) 1996</I><P>

Fixed drug eruption due to <B>COLCHICINE</B>. A 31-year-old man with hyperuricemia experienced gout attacks several times a year. Five hours after receiving colchicine, a pruritic dark reddish erythematous and edematous eruption was seen on the glans penis. <I>Dermatol 192: 61, 1996</I><P>

Severe hyponatremia during therapy with <B>FLUOXETINE</B>. A 78-year-old woman has started fluoxetine 20 mg daily 6 weeks before admission for treatment of depression. On admission, the patient's serum sodium level was very low at 103 mEq/L (normal: 135-147 mEq/L) and her urine osmolality measured 209 mOsm/kg (normal: 275-300 mOsm/kg). <I>Arch Intern Med 156: 681-682 (Mar 25) 1996</I><P>

Hepatitis secondary to<B> FLUOXETINE</B> treatment. Ten weeks before admission for evaluation of an enlarging aortic aneurysm and clinical hepatitis, a 57-year-old man was started on fluoxetine 20 mg daily for treatment of disabling anxiety. Physical examination showed an enlarged non-tender liver. The patient's liver function test values were elevated. Nine days after fluoxetine withdrawal, liver enzyme levels were near normal. <I>Amer J Psychiat 153: 580 (Apr) 1996</I><P>

Intrahepatic cholestasis associated with <B>MOCLOBEMIDE</B> leading to death. An 85-year-old woman was started on moclobemide 100 mg three times daily for treatment of depression. Seven days after starting moclobemide therapy, the patient was icteric and her right upper abdominal quadrant was mildly tender.

<P><I>Consider<STRONG>   NIMODIPINE</STRONG>   for   age-related   dementia.</I> 
Nimodipine should be considered for the  treatment of age-related cerebral impairment in the 
general  practice setting.  Compared with  baseline,  scores for  the  syndrome short  test, a 
measure of deficits in memory  and attention, had improved by a median of 3  points after 12 
weeks' treatment.<I> European Journal of Clinical Research 7: 205-215, 1995</I>

<P><I><STRONG>INTERFERON-alpha</STRONG>cannot  be  recommended  as  therapy  for 
chronic hepatitis  C in patients  with renal transplants.</I> Interferon-alpha  was not very  well 
tolerated in this  setting, was ineffective in clearing hepatitis  C virus RNA from the  plasma, 
and  was associated  with  an  unacceptable rate  of  renal failure.<I>  Nephrology  Dialysis 
Transplantation 10 (suppl.6): 93-96, 1995</I>

<P><I><STRONG>PRAVASTATIN  PLUS  NICOTINIC   ACID</STRONG>improves  lipid 
profiles.</I> Magnesium supplementation appeared to  have no significant beneficial effects on 
lipid  levels  in patients  with  dyslipidemia  receiving  pravastatin, while  lipid  levels  were 
significantly  improved in  patients  receiving  pravastatin plus  nicotinic  acid.<I>  American 
Journal of Cardiology 76: 480-484, 1 Sep 1995</I>

<P><I><STRONG>IV  IMMUNOGLOBULIN  G(IV  IgG)</STRONG>may  be  an  effective 
treatment   for   opsoclonus-myoclonus(OM)   associated   with   neuroblastoma.</I>   An 
18-month-old girl experienced  significant improvement of ataxia and OM  within 48 hours of 
receiving the  first of  2 doses of  IV IgG  1g/kg administered before  antineoplastic therapy. 
<I>Journal of Pediatrics 127: 328-329, Aug 1995</I>

<P><I><STRONG>ONDANSETRON</STRONG>appears  to possess  distinct  voltagegated 
potassium channel  blocking activity</I> that  is independent of  its affinity  for the 5-HT3 
receptor. This action  may contribute to its  reported cognition-enhancing activity. <I>Journal 
of Pharmacy and Pharmacology 47: 618-622, Jul 1995</I>

<P><I>Once-daily    IM    administration    of    <STRONG>TOBRAMYCIN</STRONG>    150    or 
300mg  results  in  high and  persistent  concentration  of  the  drug  in  skin 
interstitial  space and  in  bronchial tissue.</I>  These concentrations  exceed  the minimum 
inhibitory  concentration for  90% of  respiratory pathogens.<I>  Journal of  chemotherapy  7: 
363-370, Aug 1995</I>

<P><I>Administration  of<STRONG>GOSERELIN,</STRONG>   a  long-acting  luteinizing 
hormone-releasing  hormon  analogue,  was  as  effective  as  orchiectomy</I>  in  treating 
advanced prostate  cancer. Both treatment  were well tolerated,  and the toxicity  of goserelin 
<I>was decidedly minor. Urology 46: 220-226, Aug 1995</I>

<P><I><STRONG>PRAVASTATIN</STRONG>         has        benefits         beyond 
cholesterol-lowering</I> in patients who have undergone  cardiac transpla-ntation. Pravastatin 
not only significantly lowered the mean  cholesterol level, but also decreased the natural killer 
cell cytotoxicity. Pravastatin may cause an enhanced  state of immunosuppression, possibly by 
interacting  with cyclosporin.<I>  New  England Journal  of  Medicine 333:  621-627,  7 Sep 
1995</I>

<P><I>The timing of<STRONG> CILAZAPRIL</STRONG>administration  is more important 
than   dose.</I>   Pre-administration   of   cilazapril   prevents   post-PTCA(percutaneous 
transluminal coronary  angioplasty) restenosis. This effect  is due to an  apparent time-lag in 
the  induction of  a  full  anti-ACE effect.<I>  Coronary  Artery Disease    6:  573-579, Jul 
1995</I>

<P><I>Cardiovascular                structure               normalized                with 
a<STRONG>PERINDOPRIL</STRONG>-based   regimen.</I>   With  a   perindopril-based 
regimen, casual and ambulatory blood pressure significantly  decreased, the media:lumen ratio 
of peripheral resistance arteries, which was significantly greater in patients than in controls at 
baseline, normalized  and there was  significant reduction  in left ventricular  mass.<I> Blood 
Pressure 4: 241-248, Jul 1995</I>

<P><I>Treatment  with   <STRONG>RAMIPRIL,</STRONG>with  or   without  felodipine, 
causes regression of  carotid artery intima-media thickness</I> in patients  with hypertension 
according to the  results of the first study to  access the effects of antihyperten-sive therapy 
on wall thickness of large arteries.<I> Cardiovascular Research 30: 147-152, Jul 1995</I>

<P><I><STRONG>CAPTOPRIL</STRONG>was   effective  in   treating   post-transplant 
erythrocytosis(PTE)</I> in renal transplant recipient. Mean hematocrit and  hemoglobin values 
decreased significantly  in the  captopril-treated group, but  not in  the group who  continued 
nifedipine  therapy. Erythropoietin  levels were  similar in  both groups  and did  not change 
significantly in either.<I>Transplantation Proceedings 27: 2239-2241, Aug 1995</I>

<P><I>Oral  <STRONG>VITAMIN  K1</STRONG>prevents  hemorrhagic  disease  of  the 
newborn.</I>  A  single  oral  dose of  phytonadione(vitamin  K1)  2mg  provides  adequate 
prophylaxis  for hemorrhagic  disease of  the  newborn(HDN).<I> Journal  of Pediatrics  127: 
301-304, Aug 1995</I>

<P><I><STRONG>SERTRALINE</STRONG>seems to  be an effective treatment  for social 
phobia.</I> There was  a significant improvement in scores on  the Liebowitz Social Anxiety 
Scale  with  sertraline  therapy. <I>American  Journal  of  Psychiatry  152:  1368-1371,  Sep 
1995</I>

<P><I><STRONG>ANTIOXIDANTS</STRONG>normalize adverse response  to nitroglycerin 
in NIDDM.</I> The paradoxical adverse  rheological effects of nitroglycerin that are seen in 
patients  with   non-insulin-dependent  diabetes  mellitus(NIDDM)   can  be   overcome  by 
antioxidant supplementation.<I>Annals of Internal Medicine 123: 338-343, Sep 1995</I>

<P><I><STRONG>CYPROHEPTADINE</STRONG>therapy  may  be  of  benefit  to  some 
patients  with serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors induced  sexual  dysfunction.</I> Patients  with 
sexual  dysfunction  following  treatment  with   serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors,  fluo-xetine, 
clomipramine had an improvement in sexual function after taking cyproheptadine 4~12  mg 1~2 
hours before sexual activity. <I>Clinical Neuropharmacology 18: 320-324 , Aug 1995</I>

<P><I>Warning issued  on short-acting<STRONG>  NIFEDIPINE.</STRONG></I> Doctors 
should use  'greater caution'  when prescribing  short-acting nifedipine,  especially in  higher 
dosages, for  patients with a  history of myocardial  infarction or angina  pectoris. <I>Lancet 
346: 689-690, 9 Sep 1995</I>

<P><I><STRONG>LAMOTRIGINE</STRONG>has  a  favourable safety  profile</I>  when 
used  as  add-on  therapy  for  refractory  partial  seizures.  Most adverse  reactions  were 
considered  to be  mild  or  moderate and  did  not result  in  the discontinuation  of  study 
medication.<I> Journal of Epilepsy 8: 201-209, Aug 1995</I>

<P><I><STRONG>AMIODARONE</STRONG>therapy-risk  of  sudden  death</I> Patients 
with advanced heart failure and a history of drug-induced torsade de  pointes are at high risk 
for  sudden  death during  amiodarone  treatment.<I>  American  Journal of  Cardiology  76: 
499-502, 1 Sep 1995</I>

<P><I><STRONG>FLUTAMIDE</STRONG>induced     hepatic    insufficiency.</I>     A 
58-year-old  man   with  prostate   cancer,  underwent  transurethral   prostatectomy  and 
orchiectomy. Six  weeks after  flutamide 750 mg  daily, he  experienced dark urine,  jaundice, 
pruritus, anorexia,  and weight  loss. His liver  function test  values were elevated  and his 
prothrombin time prolonged.<I> Amer J Gastro-enterol 90: 1027-1028 (June) 1995</I>

<P><I><STRONG>DAPSONE</STRONG>related thrombocytosis in an AIDS patient.</I>  A 
24-year-old  man received  dapsone  for his  secondary  chemoprophylaxis for  Pneumocystis 
carinii pneumonia. He  had a two-fold rise in  his platelet count, a drop  in hemo-globin, and 
the appearance  of Howell-Jolly  bodies on his  blood film.  <I>Amer J Med  98: 602  (June) 
1995</I>

<P><I>Severe cytolysis  after <STRONG>HEPATITIS  B VACCINATION.</STRONG></I> 
A 35-year-old  man presented with jaundice  2 days after the  third injection of  recombinant 
hepatitis  B vaccine.  Severe  cytolysis  was present.  His  liver  function test  values  were 
elevated. Antihepatitis B surface antibodies  were elevated to 1,100 UI/L.<I> Amer J Med  98: 
595-596 (June) 1995</I>

<P><I><STRONG>METOCLOPRAMIDE</STRONG>induced   sulfhemoglobinemia.</I>    A 
54-year-old man with chronic  schizophrenia had been taken metoclopramide 10  mg orally 4 
times daily for  18 months. He experienced cyanosis with  bluish discoloration of his lips and 
fingertips, and some mild  dyspnea on exertion. His oxygen saturation  was decreased at 79% 
and  his   carboxy-hemoglobin  was   elevated,  signed   sulfhemoglobinemia.<I>  Amer   J 
Gastroenterol 90: 1010-1011 (June) 1995</I>

<P><I><STRONG>SUCCINYLCHOLINE</STRONG>    induced     hyperkalemic    cardiac 
arrest.</I>  A  15-year-old  girl  underwent  orthotopic  liver  trans-plantation  was  given 
succinylcholine 110  mg IV for amputation  of her right  leg. She had ventricular  tachycardia 
and her serum  potassium was 7.8 mEq/L.  At autopsy, she showed  interstitial nephritis and 
fibrosis in kidneys, and extensive  necrosis of skeletal muscle in the gangrenous areas of leg. 
<I>Anes 83: 211-213 (July) 1995</I>

<P><I>Blue-black  pigmentation associated  with<STRONG>PEFLOXACIN.</STRONG></I> 
A  60-year-old woman  with multiple  recurrences  of infectious  cellulitis  had been  taken 
pefloxacin 1 g daily during 6  months. She had extensive lymphedema of both legs and areas 
of blue-black macular pigmentation of the extensor surface of the lower legs and the dorsa of 
the feet.<I> Arch Derm 131: 856-857 (July) 1995</I>

<P><I>End-stage liver  disease developing  with<STRONG>METHOTREXATE.</STRONG> 
</I>A 75-year-old man with a 17-year history of severe rheumatoid arthritis  had been taken 
methotrexate 7.5  mg weekly for several  months. He showed  signs of chronic liver  disease, 
including  spider angiomas,  pale  nails, and  gynecomastia.  His total  bilirubin and  alkaline 
phosphatase levels  were mildly  elevated but his  platelet count  and white blood  cell count 
were low.<I> Arth & Rheum 38: 1014-1018 (July) 1995</I>

<P><I>Hepatic  dysfunction   associated  with<STRONG>ATENOLOL.</STRONG></I>  A 
78-year-old man with  a 2-week history of  shortness of breath on  exertion and palpitations 
had  been taken  atenolol  for 2  days.  His laboratory  test  values showed  abnormal  liver 
function with markedly  elevated alanine aminotransferase, and  moderately elevated bilirubin 
and alkaline phosphatase,  suggesting hepatocellular damage and  some cholestasis.<I> Lancet 
346: 192 (July 15) 1995</I>

<P><I><STRONG>INTERFERON-alpha</STRONG>   induced  severe   hyponatremia.</I>   A 
41-year-old  man  with  a 5-year  history  of  chronic  myeloid  leukemia had  been  taken 
inteferon-a 3 MU  daily subcutaneously for 6 weeks,  and then increased to 4.5 MU.  After 1 
weeks, he presented with mental confusion, lethargy,  generalized muscle weakness, and fever. 
<I>Amer J Hematol 49: 100, 1995</I>

<P><I>Acute interstitial nephritis associated with<STRONG>TICLOPIDINE.</STRONG></I> 
A  75-year-old  woman with  a  3-day  history of  nausea  and  weakness was  prescribed 
ticlopidine 250 mg twice  daily. A morbilliform rash was noted  over her chest, abdomen, and 
extremities. Her  initial blood  urea nitrogen  and serum  creatinine levels  were elevated.<I> 
Amer J Kidney Dis 25: 934-936 (June) 1995</I>

<P><I>Hypersensitivity to<STRONG>RETINOL  PALMITATE</STRONG> injection.</I> A 
66-year-old woman with xerosis and lichen was given intramuscular water soluble vitamin A 
palmitate. Two weeks after receiving  a second injection of vitamin A 50,000 IU, she  noted a 
red itchy area on  her right buttock over the second  injection site. The itchy area grew  into 
an oval erythe-matous scaly plaque with a hemorrhagic  component, which slowly disappeared 
over 3 weeks.<I> Brit Med J 311: 232 (July) 1995</I>

<P><I>Tinnitus  and<STRONG>CIPROFLOXACIN.</STRONG></I>  Postoperative infection 
of a sternal wound in a  57-year-old man was treated with ciprofloxacin 750 mg orally twice

Clinical Pharmacology 47:507-511, No. 6,1995</I>

<P><STRONG>EPOETIN</STRONG>-a   successfully    treated   B-chronic   lymphocytic 
leukaemia-related anaemia  in 8/9 patients.  At study end,  haematocrit had increased  from a 
mean level  of 28% to 31-45%  in 8 patients.<I>British Journal  of Haematology 89: 627-629, 
Mar 1995</I>

<P>Low-dose<STRONG>OMEPRAZOLE</STRONG>for  prevention  of  reflux oesophagitis.   
Maintenance therapy  with low-dose  omeprazole prolongs  remission in  patients with  reflux 
oesophagitis.<I>Gut 36: 492-498, Apr 1995</I>

<P>Using<STRONG>WARFARIN</STRONG>in     antiphospholipid-antibody     syndrome.            
Long-term  anticoagulation  therapy   with  warfarin  should  be  given   to  patients  with 
antiphospholipid-  antibody syndrome  to  reduce  the risk  of  recurrent  thrombosis.<I>New 
England  Journal of Medicine 332:993-997, 13 Apr 1995</I>

<P>Speedier     neutrophil     recovery      with<STRONG>CIPROFLOXACIN.</STRONG>           
Prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin  resulted in a faster  neutrophil recovery time than prophylaxis 
with  cotrimoxazole [trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole]  in patients  undergoing autologous  bone 
marrow transplantation  because of  Hodgkin's disease or  non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.<I>Bone 
Marrow Transplantation 15: 267-270, Feb 1995</I>

<P>Topical<STRONG>CLOBETASOL</STRONG>was    more    effective   than    topical 
methoxsalen in  children with  vitiligo.    The  children, aged<12years, were  treated for  the 
affected areas with  either methoxsalen ointment 0.1% 3 times  weekly 45 minutes before sun 
exposure or clobetasol  cream 0.05% twice daily.  After 6 months, 4/23  and 15/22 patients in 
the   respective  groups   showed  an   'acceptable  response'.<I>International   Journal  of 
Dermatology 34:203-205, Mar 1995</I>

<P><STRONG>CLOTRIMAZOLE</STRONG>                                           or                       
<STRONG>ITRACONAZOLE</STRONG>  is better for vaginal candidiases  than fluconazole.  
 Clinical and mycological cure rates were significantly higher after  topical clotrimazole or oral 
itraconazole treatment than  after oral fluconazole therapy in a  recent study involving women 
with confirmed  vaginal candidiasis.<I>British Journal  of Clinical Practice 49:65-66,  Mar-Apr 
1995</I>
<P><STRONG>PIRENZEPINE</STRONG>  may prevent post-MI arrhythmias.   Pirenzepine 
has the  potential to  protect against  malignant ventricular  arrhythmias after  an acute  MI. 
<I>Journal of the American College of Cardiology 25: 915-921, 15 Mar 1995</I>

<P><STRONG>RANITIDINE</STRONG>   reduces  risk  of aspiration  pneumonitis  during 
surgery.    Two doses of  oral ranitidine given  before surgery appear to  reduce the risk  of 
aspiration pneumonitis to  a greater extent than  single dose.<I>Pharmacotherapy 15: 170-175, 
Mar-Apr 1995</I>

<P><STRONG>DOBUTAMINE</STRONG>   may  be preferable  to dopamine  in  children.    
There may be  'significant clinical advantages' in  using dobutamine rather than dopamine  in 
children  who  require   high-dose  inotropic  support.<I>  British  Journal  of   Anaesthesia 
74:419-423 Apr 1995</I>

<P><STRONG>PENTOXIFYLLINE</STRONG>   decreases  proteinuria and  albuminuria in 
diabetes mellitus.   Pentoxifylline treatment clearly decreased microalbuminuria and proteinuria 
in patients with  non-insulin-dependent and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. These  effects 
may  be associated  with rheological  and renal  haemodynamic actions  of pentoxifylline.<I> 
Clinical Nephrology 43: 116-121 Feb 1995</I>

<P>Once-daily IV <STRONG> CEFTRIAXONE</STRONG>   is sufficient for pyelonephritis 
in pregnancy.   Once-daily treatment  with IV ceftriaxone 1g was as effective as thrice-daily 
administration  of  IV  cefazolin  2g  for  the  treatment  of  pregnant  women  with  acute 
pyelonephritis.<I> American  Journal of Obstetrics and  Gynecology 172: 129-133, Part  1, Jan 
1995</I>

<P>Low-dose  <STRONG>CAPTOPRIL</STRONG>    showed  a potential  in  non-severe 
idiopathic  membranous nephropathy.     After  low  dose captopril  treatment,  there was  a 
significant  reduction  in  proteinuria and  a  significant  increase  in  serum  albumin  level. 
<I>Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation 10:25-29, No. 1,1995</I>

<P>Good  results  with<STRONG>  BLEOMYCIN</STRONG>  in disseminated  germ  cell 
cancer.   The inclusion of bleomycin  in combination antineoplastic regimens for the treatment 
of disseminated  germ cell  tumors is  advocated.<I>Journal of Clinical  Oncology 13:470-476,

<P><STRONG>AMIODARONE</STRONG> pneumonitis  at low doses.    Pneumonitis  is a 
well documented  adverse effect of  higher doses  of amiodarone(>200mg/day). However,  this 
adverse  effect  can occur  even  at  low doses.  <I>Respiratory  Medicine  89:233-235, Mar 
1995,</I>
 
<P>Regular  x-rays  needed  with<STRONG>RETINOID.</STRONG>      Vitamin  A and 
retinoid  therapy  are associated  with  many  adverse skeletal  and  rheumatological  effects. 
Regular x-ray examinations should be performed during treatment with these agents to detect 
any such complications. In  some cases other procedures such as scintigraphy may  be useful. 
<I>Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism  24:291-296,Feb 1995</I>

<P>Premedication   for   adverse   events   associated   with   infusion   of   <STRONG> 
AMPHOTERICIN  B</STRONG> is not efficacious.    The most commonly used pretreatment 
regimens were no more effective in preventing  the adverse effects of amphotericin B than no 
pretreatment.<I> Clinical Infectious Diseases 20: 755-761, Apr 1995</I>

<P>Reduce  <STRONG>   ACYCLOVIR</STRONG>  dosage  in   renal  failure.       The 
recommended  dose of oral acyclovir(800mg  bid) is too high in patients with end-stage renal 
failure requiring haemodialysis.<I>Nephron 69:428-432, Apr 1995</I>

<P>Monthly testing  is adequate to detect <STRONG> ANTITUBERCULAR</STRONG> therapy-induced 
liver failure.  Patients receiving antitubercular  therapy who develop  liver failure 
can deteriorate in less than a month. Monthly testing should be performed.<I> Lancet 345:867, 
1 Apr 1995</I>

<P><STRONG>CISAPRIDE</STRONG>  can cause  torsade  de  pointes.     Cisapride can 
potentially cause  life-threatening ventricular  arrhythmias, including  torsade de pointes.  The 
company has also  warned physicians to avoid coprescribing  cisapride with oral ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, IV miconazole or troleandomycin. <I> Lancet 345: 508,25 Feb 1995</I>

<P><STRONG>VIGABATRIN</STRONG>   linked with psychiatric disorders.    Psychiatric 
disorders, which  may be severe and  feature aggression, appear  to be an important  adverse 
effect  of  the recently  introduced  anticonvulsant,  vigabatrin.<I>  Australian  Adverse Drg

<P><I>Gallstone prophylaxis  with<STRONG>URSODEOXYCHOLIC ACID.</STRONG></I> 
Ursodeoxycholic acid was highly effective in preventing gallstone formation in both men and 
women.  The  optimum  dose   for  gallstone  prophylaxis  in  this context  appears  to  be

immunomodulatory  effects.  <I>Journal  of  the  American Academy  of  Dermatology  32: 
1056-1057, Jun 1995</I>

<P><I>Severe     PMS:<STRONG>ALPRAZOLAM</STRONG>more      effective     than

placebo for  treatment of premenstrual syndrome(PMS).<I>  Journal of the American  Medical 
Associa-tion 274: 51-57, 5 Jul 1995</I>

<P><I>Response  to<STRONG>ANTITHYMOCYTE GLOBULIN</STRONG>  in Wegener"s
granulomatosis. Antithymocyte globulin(ATG)  therapy should be considered for  patients with 
Wegener"s  granulomatosis who  have  failed  "sufficient"immunosuppressive therapy  with 
corticosteroids and  cyclophosphamide, or  who experience  severe adverse  effects with  such 
treatment.<I> Clinical Nephrology 43: 351-359, Jun 1995</I>

<P><I><STRONG>PREDNISONE</STRONG>plus<STRONG>AZATHIOPRINE</STRONG> 
should be given to  patients with combined features</I> of autoimmune chronic  hepatitis and 
chronic hepatitis C virus infection, and interferon  therapy should only be considered for those 
pat-ients who do not respond.<I> Annals of Internal Medicine 123: 32-34, 1 Jul 1995</I>

<P><I><STRONG>VINCRISTINE</STRONG>is   effective   for   treating  life-threatening 
haemangiomas</I> in children whose  disease is refractory to corticosteroid treatment. Tumor 
size decreased  in patients within 1~5  weeks after initiation  of vincristine.<I> New  England 
Journal of Medicine 333: 69, 6 Jul 1995</I>

<P><I><STRONG>OCTREOTIDE</STRONG>  is   "very effective"in  controlling  diarrhea

severe,  refractory,  regimen-related diarrhea  following  bone  marrow transplantation(BMT). 
<I>Clinical Tansplanta-tion 9: 205-208, part 1, Jun 1995</I>

<P><I><STRONG>CLOMIPRAMINE</STRONG>  stops the  stutter.</I> Clomipramine  has 
modest efficacy in severe  stuttering and may be a useful alternative to  haloperidol, the most 
effective established treatment for this disorder.<I> Journal of Clinical Psychiatry 56:  238-242, 
Jun 1995</I>

<P><I><STRONG>EPINEPHRINE</STRONG>  more  effective  than  salbutamol  in  acute 
bronchiolitis.</I> Nebulized  epinephrine is more  effective than salbutamol,  and equally  well 
tolerated, in  infants with  acute bronchiolitis.<I>  Journal of  Pediatrics 126:  1004-1007, Jun 
1995</I>

<P><I><STRONG>ENALAPRIL</STRONG>     more     effective    than     theophylline 
polycythemia.</I>Enalapril lowered  hematocrit more  effectively and  more permanently  than 
theophylline    in  renal  transplant  recipients  with  polycythemia.<I>  Transplantation  59:

<P><I><STRONG>AMIODARONE</STRONG>  fails  to   improve  survival  in  CHF.</I> 
Amiodarone did not reduce overall mortality or the incidence of sudden death in  patients with 
congestive  heart failure(CHF)  and asymptomatic  arrhythmia.<I>  New England  Journal of 
Medicne 333: 121-122, 13 Jul 1995</I>

<P><I><STRONG>IBUPROFEN</STRONG>    heads   upward.</I>    In    contrast   to 
indomethacin, ibuprofen did not impair cerebral hemodynamics when used to induce closure of 
patent ductus  arteriosus(PDA) in infants born  between 23 and 28  weeks postconception.<I> 
Lancet 346: 255, 22 Jul 1995</I>

<P><I><STRONG>MISOPROSTOL</STRONG>  reduces  pain  associated  with  trigeminal 
neuralgia</I> in patients with multiple sclerosis.  Six of 7 patients who had failed to respond 
to conventional  therapy had  complete(n=4), transient(1)  or partial(1)  pain relief  soon after 
starting  treatment  with  misoprostol  300~800mcg/day.<I>  Neurology  45:  1097-1100,  Jun 
1995</I>

<B>RISPERIDONE</B> produces symptomatic and global improvement in antipsychotic-naive patients who are hospitalised with their first episode of schizophrenia. There was a greater than 20% reduction in total PANSS(Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) score in 59% of patients. <I>Biological Psychiatry 39: 296-298, 15 Feb 1996</I><P>

<B>TRAMADOLE</B> provides more effective analgesia than ketorolac after day-stay laparoscopy. Compared with ketorolac recipients,tramadole recipients experienced significantly less pain in the first 2 days after discharge from hospital. <I>British Journal of Anesthesia 76:584, Apr 1996</I><P>
The combination of <B>METHOTREXATE + SULFASALAZINE + HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE</B> is more effective than,and as well tolerated as, methotrexate alone or sulfasalazine + hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis(RA). <I>New England Journal of Medicine 334:1287-1291,16 May 1996</I><P>

Administering <B>CARVEDILOL</B>, the beta-blocker in addition to conventional therapy, improves survival in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). The mortality rate was significantly lower in carvedilol compared with placebo recipients (3.2 vs 7.8%, respectively). The rate of hospitalisation was also lower in carvedilol compared with placebo recipients (14.1 vs 19.6%, respectively). <I>New England Journal of Medicine 334: 1349-1355, 23 May 1996</I><P>

Using <B>NSAIDs</B> for greater than 2 years may reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease by up to 60%. The reduction in risk appears to be associated only with non-aspirin NSAIDs. The minimum dose for a protective benefit needs to be identified, because of concerns associated with the long-term use of NSAIDs. <I>Lancet 347: 958, 6 Apr 1996</I><P>

The addition of <B>FLUNARIZINE</B> to anticonvulsant regimens may benefit patients with refractory epilepsy. Seventeen patients with refractory epilepsy received flunarizine 10mg/day or 20mg/day for 6 months in addition to their current anticonvulsant therapy. After the treatment, seizure frequency was reduced in 10 patients.Flunarizine was more effective in controlling generalised tonic-clonic seizures than complex partial seizures. <I>Journal of Epilepsy 9: 20-22, Mar 1996</I><P>

<B>TRANSDERMAL NITROGLYCERIN</B> may be effective in the treatment of dysmenorrhoea. Total pain score was lower with nitroglycerin compared with placebo administration. The pain score on the worst day during the treatment cycle was also lower with nitroglycerin compared with placebo administration. <I>British Medical Journal 312: 884,6 Apr 1996</I><P>

<B>ENOXAPARIN</B> sodium prevents thromboembolism after arthroplasty. In patients who undergo knee arthroplasty, postoperative use of fixed-dose enoxaparin sodium is more effective than adjusted doses of warfarin in preventing total deep vein thrombosis (DVT). <I>Annals of Internal Medicine 124: 619-626, 1 Apr 1996</I><P>

When used in the treatment of DVT, <B>Low-Molecular-Weight-Heparins (LMWH)</B> were associated with fewer recurrent venous thromboembolic episodes and less major bleeding than unfractionated heparin in meta-analysis. <I>American Journal of Medicine 100: 269-277, Mar 1996</I><P>

<B>TETRACYCLINE</B> is effective in benign essential telangiectasia. After treating for 14 girls and women with benign essential telangiectasia, 50% of the patients had a decrease in the extent of the area of telangiectasia. Recommended dosage of tetracycline was 1g/day for 6-12 months. <I>European Journal of Dermatology 6: 91-93, Mar 1996</I><P>

<B>LOVASTATIN</B> slows the progression of early atherosclerosis. Lovastatin had consistent reduction in the carotid intima-media thickness which is a reliable end-point for lipid-lowering trials in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) while placebo recipients had a consistent increase. The reduction of intima-media thickness was associated with reductions in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, total triglyceride, and apolipoproteins, and an increase in HDL cholesterol. <I>Annals of Internal Medicine 124: 548-556, 15 Mar 1996</I><P>

<B>BEZAFIBRATE</B> slows the progression of CAD in young men who have experienced myocardial infarction (MI). Bezafibrate therapy also improves patients' lipid profile, reduces fibrinogen levels and reduces the incidence of coronary events. <I>Lancet 347: 849-853, 30 Mar 1996</I><P>

<B>PCA + Continuous Infusion (CI) MORPHINE</B> is no better than PCA alone for postsurgical analgesia. Adding CI morphine to morphine administered via patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) increased the incidence of adverse effects requiring adjustment or discontinuation of  treatment, without improving analgesic efficacy. <I>Annals of Pharmacotherapy 30: 224-227, Mar 1996</I><P>

<B>AMOXICILLIN</B> to be better than azithromycin for erythema migrans. Twenty days' treatment with amoxicillin was showen to be significantly more effective than 7 days' treatment with azithromycin in resolving the acute manifestation of erythema migrans, a characteristic manifestation of Lyme disease and in the prevention of relapse. <I>Annals of Internal Medicine 124: 785-791, 1 May 1996</I><P>

Effects of  <B>OTC FAMOTIDINE and ANTACID</B> on gastric acid.
Calcium carbonate antacid reduces postprandial gastric acidity more rapidly than the over-the-counter (OTC) formulation of famotidine. While famotidine has a delayed onset of action, it also had a much longer duration of effect than calcium carbonate. <I>JAMA 275: 1428-1431, 8 May 1996</I><P>

<B>ONCE-DAILY administration of AMINOGLYCOSIDES</B> has equivalent efficacy in terms of bacteriological cure to standard regimens, according to the results of a meta-analysis. In the meta-analysis, a once-daily IV aminoglycoside regimen was compared with a standard twice- or thrice- daily regimen in infected, immunocompetent patients. <I>Annals of Internal Medicine 124: 717-725, 15 Apr 1996</I><P>

<B>METRONIDAZOLE</B> is the drug of choice for the treatment of Clostridium difficile - associated diarrhea. The study which compares oral metronidazole 500mg thrice daily  with fusidate 500mg or vancomycin 500mg thrice daily, or oral teicoplanin 400mg twice daily for 10 days had similar clinical efficacy; however, cost analysis demonstrated the superiority of metronidazole. <I>Clinical Infectious Disease 22: 813-818, May 1996</I><P>

Among specific calcium antagonists, <B>VERAPAMIL</B> was associated with the highest risk of GI hemorrhage followed by diltiazem and nifedipine. <I>Lancet 347:1061-1065, Apr 1996</I><P>

No age-related differences in <B>GLIBENCLAMIDE</B> pharmacokinetics. Ten elderly and 10 younger patients with NIDDM received oral glibenclamide (maximum 20mg/day) for 12 weeks. Pharmacokinetic evaluations showed no age-related differences in the glucose and insulin level, while the glibenclamide induced change in C-peptide levels was greater in the elderly patients. <I>Annals of Pharmacotherapy 30: 472-475, May 1996</I><P>

<B>VITAMIN A</B> in the form of retinal and retinyl ester  <I>seems safe</I>  at dosages of 5000-10000 IU/day. However, toxic reactions are common in megadoses, even after short-term exposure. The risk of toxicity is increased in patients with low body weight, protein malnutrition, liver or renal disease, hyperlipoproteinemia, and ascorbic acid deficiency. It should be contraindicated in women of childbearing age and heavy alcohol consumers. <I> Archives of Internal Medicine 156: 925-935, 13 May 1996</I><P>

<B>DEXAMETHASONE</B> pharmacokinetics are related to gestational age in premature neonates. The study with 15 premature neonates showed that neonates < 27 weeks' gestational age had almost a 5-fold lower clearance rate of dexamethasone than those > 27 weeks' gestational age. Individualised, lower dosage regimen may be required in very premature neonates. <I>European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology 49: 477-483, No.6, 1996</I><P>

The US FDA has received 115 reports of drug abuse, withdrawal effects, or overdose, and 83 reports of seizures associated with <B>TRAMADOLE</B>. Tramadole is not recommended for patients with a history of opioid dependence, and recommended single and daily dosages of tramadole should not be exceeded. <I>FDC reports- Pink Sheet- Prescription Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology: T & G  1,8 Apr 1996</I><P>

The <B>BISPHOSPHONATES</B> are generally well tolerated, but toxicity may vary considerably among agents of this drug class. Etidronate can induce osteomalacia when administered at dosages > 5 mg/kg/day for long periods. Impaired bone mineralisation is not generally seen with other bisphosphonates ( e.g. clodronic acid, pamidronic acid, alendronic acid and tiludronic acid). <I>Drug Safety 14: 158-170, Mar 1996</I><P>

How 'safe' are <B>CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING</B> interventions?
The benefits associated with cholesterol - lowering interventions may be outweighed by the risks in some patients with hypercholesterolemia. Cholesterol - lowering interventions (fibric acid derivatives, HMG-Co A reductase inhibitors, gemfibrozil, and bile acid resins) appear to increase the risk for cancer, stroke, accidental and violent death, and in some cases, coronary heart disease. <I>Annals of Pharmacotherapy 30: 495-500, May 1996</I><P>

Antihistamine, <B>TERFENADINE</B>, should not be coadministrated with drugs such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, troleandomycin, ketoconazole, and itraconazole, because this practice results in ventricular arrhythmias. <I>JAMA 275: 1339-1341, 1 May 1996</I><P>

<B>VERAPAMIL</B> induced polydipsia.
A 6-week-old infant was treated with oral digoxin for supraventricular tachycardia(SVT). When the infant's symptoms recurred 3 months later, verapamil was added. Both medications were discontinued when he was 6 months of age. When SVT recurred at 11 months of age, verapamil 5 mg/kg/day treatment was restarted. Shortly thereafter, the infant developed lethargy, increased thirst and urination, and irritability. This primary polydipsia was reported to be due to chronic use of verapamil in children. <I>Pediat Cardiol 16:228-230, 1995</I><P>
 
<B>FLUOXETINE  and PAROXETINE</B> induced recurrent hyponatremia.
A 78-year-old woman with a 12-month history of first-episode major depression was successfully treated with a regimen of fluoxetine 20mg daily. Five months later she developed SIADH and serum sodium level was 118 mmol/L. Fluoxetine discontinuation and fluid restriction (800 ml/day) stabilized serum sodium level at 135 mmol/L within 2 weeks. One week after restarting paroxetine 10mg daily, the patient's serum sodium level fell to 125 mmol/L. <I>Amer J Psychiat 153:135, Jan 1996</I><P>

<B>RISPERIDONE</B> induced neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
A 43-year-old woman with chronic schizophrenia and depression had been taking risperidone 6mg daily. Four days after study risperidone she developed sinus tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, fever, and urinary incontinence, mutism, transient confusion, marked akinesia, cogwheel rigidity, and dystonia. A diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome was made. <I>JAMA 275:446, 1996</I><P>


<B>ANTITUBERCULOSIS THERAPY</B> induced alopecia.
Five patients developed alopecia after treatment with tuberculosis therapy. The drugs included isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol,and vitamin B6. <I>Lancet 347:472, Feb 1996</I><P>

<B>WARFARIN</B> induced spinal epidural hematoma.
A 69-year-old man who had been taking warfarin for 5 months for a deep vein thrombosis developed constant, severe pain in the lower back. Emergency MRI showed a posterior extradural hematoma from T6 to L2 with high-grade spinal cord compression. The spinal epidural hematoma should be considered when sudden, unexplained back pain occurs in a patient taking warfarin. <I>Amer J Med 100: 237-238, Feb 1996</I><P>

<B>SERTRALINE</B> induced prolonged bleeding time.
A 16-year- old-girl was started on a trial of sertraline 25mg daily and increased to 50mg daily during the third week for treatment of major depression. Four months after study sertraline the patient developed bilateral leg and arm ecchymoses and her bleeding time was prolonged.(12.5 minutes). <I>Amer J Psychiat 153: 443, Mar 1996</I><P>

<B>TRIMETHOPRIM</B> induced anaphylaxis.
A 31-year-old man experienced generalized urticaria, facial angioedema, dysphagia, and wheezing dyspnea after taking one tablet of cotrimoxazole. Three weeks after the reaction to trimethoprim, trimethoprim produced a 5 X 5 mm wheal with flare and was positive. Specific IgE was positive for trimethoprim. <I>Allergy & Clin Immunol 97: 137-138, Jan 1996</I><P>

The combination use of <B>CISAPRIDE</B> with oral or parenteral fluconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, ketoconazole, erythromycin, or clarithromycin should be avoided. These antifungals and antibacterials inhibit cisapride metabolism, and can increase blood concentrations leading to disturbances in cardiac rhythm.<I> Current problems in Pharmacovigilance 22:1, Mar 1996</I><P>

<B>PHENYTOIN, CARBAMAZEPINE</B> and thyroid hormone levels.
Patients who receive treatment with phenytoin or carbamazepine show decreased serum levels of free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), while appearing otherwise clinically euthyroid with normal levels of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). <I>JAMA 275: 1495-1498, 15 May 1996</I><P>

<B>ASPIRIN</B> + low-dose warfarin led to significantly higher faecal hemoglobin excretion compared with conventional warfarin therapy alone. The incidency of more major clinical GI bleeding episodes occurred with warfarin + aspirin, when compared to conventional warfarin therapy alone after 1 month treatemnt. <I>Archives of Internal Medicine 156: 658-660, 25 Mar 1996</I><P>

Clinically significant interaction between <B>FLUCONAZOLE</B> and triazolam. Fluconazole more than doubled the AUC, almost doubled the elimination half-life, and significantly enhanced the effects of a single dose of triazolam 0.25mg. The dosage of triazolam should be reduced by 50-75% when concomitant use of fluconazole cannot be avoided. <I>British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology 41: 319-323, Apr 1996</I><BR><P>

The addition of  droperidol to propofol   anesthesia doubled the frequency  of multiple nausea 
and  vomiting  episodes, suggesting  a  possible  interaction between  the  drugs.  Propofol's 
antiemetic efficacy  is related to  its activity  at the dopaminergic  receptor in the  CTZ, and   
droperidol and propofol  compete for binding at  the same receptor, resulting  in submaximum 
receptor blockade  and an  increase in the  frequently of  nausea and vomiting  after noxious 
stimuli.<I> Pharmacotherapy 1994;14(5):586-591 </I>

<P><I><STRONG>Carboplatin</STRONG>  a better  choice  than cisplatin  for  SCLC:</I>  
Both etoposide + cisplatin and etoposide + carboplatin  are effective in patients with small cell

<P><I><STRONG>Baclofen</STRONG>  beats  bronchial  hyper-reactivity:</I>    Baclofen 
may prove to be useful in  the treatment of asthma, according to US researchers. Baclofen is 
a  GABA agonist  that  has an  anticholinergic  effect  and inhibits  the  release of  various 
inflammatory mediators.<I> Chest 106: 758-761, Sep 1994</I>

<P><I>Which<STRONG> salicylate</STRONG> for ulcerative colitis?</I><BR>
<P>    The choice of salicylate for the  maintenance treatment of ulcerative colitis should be 
based on both efficacy  and safety. There is no need to switch  patients from sulfasalazine to 
another new drug. However, in new patients,  one of the sulfa-free salicylates should be used 
to  avoid  the potential,  but  rare,  adverse  effects  of agranulocytosis  and  hepatotoxicity. 
Olsalazine  and  balsalazide are  the  2  agents that  most  reliably  deliver  5-aminosalicylic 
acid(5-ASA) to the colon.<I> Gut 35:1155-1158, Sep 1994</I>

<P><I>Improved response with  high-dose<STRONG> fluoxetine:</STRONG></I>  Patients 
with major depression resistant to treatment with fluoxetine 20mg/day may improve when the 
fluoxetine dose  is increased, according  to a double-blind,  pilot study conducted  in the US.

Combining ribavirin  and interferon-alpha   can  induce sustained inhibition  of hepatitis  C virus 
replication and sustained  normalization of ALT levels in  some patients who have previously 
failed interferon-a  monotherapy.<I> Gastroenterology 107: 812-817, Sep 1994</I>

<P>    Nicardipine may  be  better than  metoprolol  for treating  hypertension in  pregnant 
women,  report researchers  from France.<I>  Obstetrics  and Gynecology  84:  354-359, Sep

<P>    Nimodipine appears to be effective and safe  for pregnant women with pre-eclampsia, 
according to  researchers from  the US.  Moreover, evidence  from their  study suggest  that 
nimodipine causes  small-diameter cerebral vessel  vasodilation.<I> Journal of  Obstetrics and 
Gynecology 171: 417-424, Aug 1994</I>

<P><I><STRONG>Clomifene</STRONG> may increase ovarian cancer risk:</I>  Results of 
a US  study suggest that  the use of clomifene  to treat infertility  may increase the  risk of 
ovarian cancer. The risk was  increased both in women with, and in those without, ovulatory 
abnormalities.<I> New England Journal of Medicine. 331: 771-776, 22 Sep 1994 </I>  

<P><I>Caution with<STRONG>  ciprofloxacin</STRONG> and driving:</I>   The fact that 
ciprofloxacin can  impair the ability  to perform skilled  tasks such as  driving is not  widely 
recognised, according to Dr KJ  Gray and colleagues from Whiston Hospital, Merseyside, UK. 
But it  is essential  that patients  are cautioned  about this  effect when  they are  precribed 
ciprofloxacin, they say.<I> British Medical Journal 309: 542, 20-27 Aug 1994 </I>

<P><I>Marked BP  increase with<STRONG> NSAIDs:</STRONG></I>   NSAIDs  cause a 
marked elevation  in BP,  according to  results of  a meta-analysis performed  by Australian 
investigators.  This  effect  could  potentially  increase  hypertension-related  morbidity  and 
mortaily, they say. NSAIDs were noted  to antagonise the BP-lowering effects of  b-blockers 
and vasodilators more  than those of diuretics.<I>  Annals of Internal Medicine 121:  289-300, 
15 Aug 1994</I>

<P><I><STRONG>Gangliosides</STRONG>  withdrawn in  Italy:</I>   The Italian  Health 
Ministry has  finally decided  to withdraw  mixed ganglioside preparations  from the  market, 
according to a report in<I> Scrip  [1957: 25, 13 Sep 1994].</I> The national health council in 
Italy, the CSS,  recommended in July that  the preparations be withdrawn  because they may 
cause Guillan Barre syndrome.

<P><I>FDA urged  to ban<STRONG> quinine</STRONG>  for night-time leg cramps:</I>   
According to a report in the Wal Street  Journal [9 Sep], the US FDA is being urged to take 
action  about Marion  Merrell Dow  Inc's drug  Quinamm [quinine],  which is  used to  treat 
night-time leg cramps.

<P><I>Sandoz  withdrawing<STRONG>  Parlodel</STRONG>   postpartum  indication:</I>   
An  FDA committe  recommended  that  bromocriptine not  be  used for  the  prevention  of 
postpartum lactation. The  FDA requested that companies marketing drugs  for the prevention 
of  postpartum breast  engorgement  remove the  indication from  labelling;  at the  time  all 
manufacturers apart from  Sandoz complied with the request.<I> FDC  Report - Pink Sheet :

<P><I><STRONG>Quinidine</STRONG> induced  pneumonitis :</I>   A 10-day history  of 
fever and rapidly   progressing lung infiltrates  prompted admission of a  54-year-old man to 
the hospital.  He had  been treated with  quinidine during  the preceding 2  months on  three 
occasions because of episodes of atrial fibrillation.<I> Chest 106 : 304-306 (July ) 1994 </I>

<P><I><STRONG>Benzocaine</STRONG> induced Methemoglobinemia:</I>  A 40-year-old 
woman  underwent  upper  GI endoscopy  for  evaluation  of  chronic,  left upper  quadrant, 
abdominal pain. The patient  was premedicated and 20% benzocaine spray was  used for local 
anesthesia. She  became increasingly  cyanotic and her  oxygen saturation level  continued to 
fall. The  cyanosis progressed to her  face, hands, and  legs.<I> Amer J   Gastroenteral 89 : 
1108-1109 (July ) 1994</I>

<P><I><STRONG>Ondansetron</STRONG>  induced  Jaundice:</I>  A  35-year-old  man, 
receiving  adjuvant chemotherapy  after  removal of  a  tumor  of the  left  kidney, received 
ondansetron two  8mg doses intravenously.  Ten days later he  was admitted to  the hospital 
with nausea and vomiting associated with jaundice.<I> Lancet 344 : 190-191 (July) 1994 </I>

<P><I><STRONG>Sulfasalazine</STRONG> induced  systemic lupus erythematosus:</I>  A 
31-year-old woman with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis had remained fairly stable after 5 
years of  treatment with sulfasalazine 1  g twice daily. The  patient developed a symmetrical 
erythematous facial  rash with orbital  sparing. A  diagnosis of systemic  lupus erythematous 
with intra-abdominal vasculitis was considered.<I> Brit J Rheum 33 : 175-176, 1994</I>

<P><I><STRONG>Ticlopidine</STRONG>  induced cholesatatic  jaundice:</I>   One  week 
before her  symptoms of worsening  nausea, deterioration of  appetite, and  jaundice began, a 
69-year-old woman  started taking ticlopidine  hydrochloride 250 mg  orally twice daily  after 
having a mild stroke.<I> Amer J hosp Pharm 51 : 1822 (July 15) 1994 </I>

<P><I><STRONG>Ketorolac</STRONG> induced  Giant Duodenal  Ulcers:</I> Following a 
ventral hernia  repair, a 67-year-old man  received ketorolac 60  mg intramuscularly, then  30 
mg every six  hours for eleven doses, for  pain control. Esophagogastroduodnoscopy (EGD) 
showed a 3cm duodenal ulcer  with a sentinel clot.<I> Amer J Gastroenterol 89  : 1111 (July) 
1994</I>

<P><I><STRONG>Loratadine</STRONG> induced  Ventricular Tachycardia:</I>  For three 
days before hospital admission, a 69-year-old man with a history of arrhythmias treated  with 
quinidine experienced  symptoms of presyncope. 24  four before the  onset of the presyncopal 
episodes,  therapy with  loratadine  10mg daily  had  been started.  During transport  to  the 
hospital  he was  found to  have runs  of nonsustained  ventricular tachycardia.<I>  Amer J 
Cardiol 74:207 (July 15) 1994</I>

<P><I><STRONG>Oral Polio  Vaccine</STRONG> induced  paralytic poliomyelitis:</I>   A 
3-1/2-month-old boy  was admitted  to the  hospital with  a 5-day history  of fever,  and a 
2-day history  of progressive, generalized  muscle weakness.  Neurologic examination showed 
marked quadriparesis  with diminished tone of  the upper extremities, flaccid  paralysis of the 
lower  extremities, and  absence of  deep  tendon reflexes  of all  four  extremities. 32  days 
previously, the infant had received an oral poliovirus vaccine immunization.<I> J Child Neurol 
9:334-335  (July) 1994</I>

<P><I><STRONG>Buprenorphine</STRONG> induced noncardiogenic pulmonary edema:</I> 
A   21-year-old  nurse with  a history   of  severe dysmenorrhea  had taken  one tablet  of 
buprenorphine 0.2mg  sublingually. Within  90 minutes of  taking the  tablet, she  experienced 
dizziness and syncope. She was drowsy, and had peripheral  cyanosis and pink frothy sputum. 
Respiratory  evaluation  disclosed shallow  breathing  and  auscultation  showed diffuse  fine 
crepitations over both lung  fields. Chest x-ray indicated diffuse alveolar  infiltrates.<I> Chest

<P><I>Adverse   interaction  between<STRONG>   clonidine</STRONG>   and<STRONG> 
verapamil:</STRONG>  A 54-year-old  woman  with hyperaldosteronism  was  treated with 
verapamil 480  mg/d and spironolactone  100 mg/d. After  the addition of  a minimal dose of 
clonidine (0.15mg bid),  she was developed complete AV block  and severe hypertesion, which 
resolved  upon  cessation  of  all  medications.  A  65-year-old  woman  was  treated  with 
extended-release verapamil 240mg/d. After the addition of clonidine 0.15 mg bid she developed 
complete  AV block,  which resolved  after all  therapy was  stopped.<I> Ann  Pharmacother

<P>Sustained  response after  <STRONG>INTERFERON-a-2b</STRONG> for  hepatitis  C.  
Patients  with hepatitis  C   who demonstrate  a sustained  response  to treatment  with SC 
interferon-a-2b 3MU  3 times/weeks  are likely to  maintain normal ALT  levels and  remain 
nonviraemic for up to 2 years. <I>Hepatology 21: 918-922, Apr 1995.</I>

<P>A  4-day  course  of  <STRONG>CEFUROXIME  AXETIL</STRONG>  treated  acute 
streptococcus   pharyngitis  as   effectively  as   10  days'   conventional  treatment   with 
phenoxymethyl penicillin(penicillin V). <I>Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal 14: 295-300, Apr 
1995.</I>

<P><STRONG>DINOPROSTONE</STRONG> better in second  trimester abortion. Compared 
with    IM   carboprost(15-methyl-prostaglandin    E2),   intravaginal    administration   of 
dinoprostone(prostagladin E2) resulted in  a shorter time from induction to delivery in  women 
undergoing second trimester abortion. In addition, the mean times from induction to rupture of 
the membranes, delivery  of the fetus and delivery of  the placenta, were significantly shorter 
in the dinoprostone,  compared with the carboprost. <I>Obstetrics and Gynecology 85:697-700, 
Part 1, May 1995.</I>

<P><STRONG>LISINOPRIL</STRONG>   reduces  fibrinogen   levels.  Lisinopril   has   a 
fibrinogen lowering effect, in addition  to  its antihypertensive action and beneficial effects  on 
the lipid profile. It has  recently been shown that high fibrinogen levels are a risk  factors for 
cardiovascular morbidity and  mortality. <I>Journal of Clinical Pharmacology 39:471-476,  May 
1995. </I>

<P><STRONG>FLUOXETINE</STRONG> treatment   in PMS.  Fluoxetine  20 mg/day can 
effectively relieve  symptoms of  premenstrual syndrome within  the first cycle  of treatment, 
while  reducing  the   risk  of  adverse  effects.   <I>New  England  Journal  of  Medicine 
332:1574-1575, 8, Jun 1995</I>

<P><STRONG>CEFTAZIDIME</STRONG> 2g  bid IV  was more  effective overall  than a 
combination of IV ceftriaxone  2g once daily plus IV or IM tobramycin  3~5mg/kg/day after a 
2 mg/kg  loading dose  in treating patients  with hospital-acquired  gram-negative infections.   
<I>Clinical Infectious Disease 20:1217-1228, May 1995.</I>

<P><STRONG>MAGNESIUM   SULFATE</STRONG>  favoured in  eclampsia. Magnesium 
sulfate is the  drug of choice for  the management of convulsions  in women with eclampsia. 
This drug  is more effective  than either phenytoin  or diazepam in  preventing recurrence of 
convulsions and maternal death. <I>Lancet 345:1455-1463, 10 Jun 1995.</I>

<P><STRONG>PRAVASTATIN</STRONG> slows  atherosclerosis. Progression of  coronary 
atherosclerosis  was  significantly  less in  patients  who  received  pravastatin  40  mg/day, 
compared with placebo recipients. <I>Circulation 91:2528-2540, 15 May 1995.</I>

<P>Adjuvant   <STRONG>THIAMINE</STRONG>  beneficial   in  long-term   furosemide 
therapy.   Supplementation  with thiamine  IV 100mg  bid improved  left  ventricular ejection 
fraction(LVEF) by  22% in some  patients with moderate-to-severe  chronic congestive  heart 
failure who  were receiving long term  furosemide therapy(>80mg/day). <I>American  Journal 
of Medicine 98:485-490, May 1995.</I>

<P>Improvements   with  <STRONG>SITOSTEROL</STRONG>   in     benign   prostatic 
hyperplasia(BPH.).  Treatment with  sitosterol 20mg  thrice  daily for  6 months  resulted  in 
significant beneficial  effects in  patient with symptomatic  BPH, compared with  the placebo. 
<I>Lancet 345:1529-1532, 17 Jun 1995.</I>

<P>Low-dose   nasal    <STRONG>SALCATONIN</STRONG>   sufficient    to   prevent 
osteoporosis. Intranasal salcatonin [salmon calcitonin] 50 IU/day  appeared sufficient to prevent 
trabecular  bone  loss  in postmenopausal  who  had  had  their  last menses  6~72  months 
previously. <I>American Journal of Medicine 98:452-458, May 1995.</I>

<P>Pulse <STRONG>DEXAMETHASONE</STRONG> therapy  beneficial in very low  birth 
weight neonates. Pulse dexamethasone therapy(0.25mg/kg bid for 3 days) resulted in improved 
outcome in a study involving neonates  with very low birth weight who were at high risk of 
chronic lung  disease and  required ventilator  support. <I>Journal  of Pediatrics  126:769-776, 
Part 1, May 1995.</I>

<P><STRONG>RAMIPRIL</STRONG>  is  a  suitable  antihypersentive  for  single-kidney 
patients. Oral ramipril 2.5mg/day  for 4 weeks reduces BP, and may have  a favourable effect 
on renal haemodynamics, in  single-kidney patient with hypertension. <I>American Journal of 
Therapeutics 2:328-332, May 1995.</I>

<P>Inhibitory    effect    of     <STRONG>TERFENADINE</STRONG>    on    alcoholic 
beverage-induced bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients. Oral terfenadine therapy(60mg bid) 
before   challenge   with   alcohol   may   be   effective   in   preventing  alcohol-induced 
bronchoconstriction in  patient with asthma. <I>European  Respiratory Journal 8:619-623,  Apr 
1995.</I>

<P><STRONG>CIPROFIBRATE</STRONG>  appears   to  be  a   valuable  to  drug  for 
hypercholesterolemia.  In  patients with  type  2a  or 2b  disease  who  received  ciprofibrate 
100mg/day for up  to 6 years, LDL-cholesterol  and triglyceride levels decreased  significantly 
and  mean  HDL- cholesterol  level  had  increased significantly  at  the  end of  treatment. 
<I>Current Therapeutic Research 56:498-507, May 1995.</I>

<P>Long  term, low  dose  <STRONG>ROXITHROMYCIN</STRONG>(150mg/day) reduced 
the production  of superoxide anions  by peripheral polymorphonuclear  leukocytes(PMNs) and 
reduced bronchial hypertensiveness  in patients with bronchial asthma.  <I>Journal of Asthma 
32:191-197, No. 3, 1995.</I>

<P><STRONG>ENALAPRIL</STRONG>  reduces neurohormone  levels in  LV dysfunction. 
Effects of  enalapril in  patients with  left ventricular  dysfunction may  be attributed to  the 
reduction in plasma neurohormone  levels. <I>American Journal of Cardiology 75:1151-1157,  1 
Jun 1995.</I>

<P>Oral  <STRONG>FOLIC  ACID</STRONG>  therapy  resulted  in  rapid  remission  of 
red-cell aplasia of unknown etiology in a 68-year-old  woman. Initiation of folic acid 1mg/day 
resulted in an apparent delay of anaemia.  A dose increase to 5mg/day was associated with a 
normalization of blood haemoglobin  level within 4~5 weeks and a  clear reticulocyte response. 
<I>Lancet 345: 1645-1646, 24 Jun 1995. </I>

<P>Using  <STRONG>FAMOTIDINE</STRONG>  and <STRONG>ANTACID</STRONG> 
in heartburn. Antacids  or low doses of famotidine  can be used effectively for self-treatment 
of heartburn,  and famotidine can  provide effective prophylaxis against  meal-provoked upper 
GI symptoms. <I>American Journal of Therapeutics 2:314-319, May 1995.</I>

<P>Angiographic    evidence    for   reduced    progression    of    atherosclerosis    with 
<STRONG>TOCOPHEROL</STRONG>.   Men    with   a    supplementary   intake   of 
tocopherol>100IU/day had significantly less  coronary artery lesion pregression than men with 
a lower supplementary intake of the vitamin. <I>Journal of the American Medical Association 
273:1849-1854, 21 Jun 1995.</I>

<P><STRONG>ACARBOSE</STRONG> is an effective new approach to  NIDDM. In patient 
with  NIDDM, acarbose  represents a  new modality  of therapy  that significantly  improves 
overall glycaemic control.  The maximum improvement in  glycaemic control was seen in  the 
tolbutamide plus  acarbose group. <I>American  Journal  of  Medicine 98:443-451, May  1995.

varices after  sclerotherapy. In patient  with liver cirrhosis  who were  undergoing endoscopic 
variceal sclerotherapy, treatment with  SC octreotide 100mg tid did not decrease the  incidence 
of  early rebleeding,  compared with  sclerotherapy alone.  <I>Hepatology 21:1322-1327,  May 
1995.</I>

<P>Reduce <STRONG>IDARUBICIN</STRONG>  dose for elderly with  AML. The dose of 
idarubicin  should   be  reduced  in   elderly  patients  (median   65)  with  acute   myeloid 
leukemia(AML) who received 1 or 2 courses of IV induction therapy that comprised idarubicin 
8mg/m2  on days 1, 3, and  5, cytarabine 200mg/m2 on days 1-7 and etoposide 60 mg/m2 on

<P><STRONG>METHOTREXATE</STRONG>   induced   life-threatening  herpes   zoster 
infection.   A 26-year old woman  with a 10-year  history of rheumatoid arthritis  favourably 
responded to  treatment with  methotrexate 7.5  mg weekly which  was increased  to 20  mg 
weekly over eight months.  She developed ulcers of the eyes, mouth,  and vagina which were 
severe disseminated life-threatening  herpes zoster infection.   <I>Annals Rheum Dis  54:155, 
1995</I>

<P><STRONG>NIFEDIPINE</STRONG> induced gingival  hyperplasia.  A 57-year-old man 
with a history of coronary vascular disease had taken nifedipine intermittently over a  12-year 
period,  including  the  preceding   11  months.  Physical  examination  showed  pronounced 
inflammatory gingival  hyperplasia involving several  papillae on the labial  side of the  lower 
anterior teeth.  <I>Brit Heart J  73:115,1995</I>

<P><STRONG>AZATHIOPRINE</STRONG> induced  acute myeloid  leukemia.  A  72-year 
old woman  with rheumatoid arthritis   was started azathioprine 100  mg daily. Her condition
