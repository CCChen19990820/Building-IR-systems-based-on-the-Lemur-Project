medical treatment will be on the ballot Tuesday in California, and recent polls suggest that both are headed for easy defeat.

snifters or cognac.  Glossy magazine articles on blind tastings quote smokers rhapsodizing like wine snobs.  What many don't

Summary:	It has become a fall ritual for millions of employed Californians; the search through the brochures to pick the right HMO for the

Summary:	HMOs have had a poor year so far, and things won't change overnight.  Most major HMOs are expected to post
anemic third-quarter results, but Wall Street estimates for the sector are so low that substantial
disappointments on the scale of those seen in the past quarter appear unlikely.<p>

Summary:	The prospect of a blood transfusion makes many health consumers feel faint with apprehension.  But there are
more ways to replenish this liquid commodity than you might imagine.  Recycling blood reduces or in some
cases entirely eliminates the need for conventional transfusion.  Instead of wasting blood, surgeons now
routinely save, cleanse and reinfuse a patient's own blood on the spot.<p>

Summary:	Is the tobacco industry inching closer to admitting that smoking causes cancer?  That long-improbable
scenario may have become a little more likely after last week's release of a landmark study in which two
teams of scientists identified the last link in the chain of evidence showing how cigarettes cause cancer.<p>

Summary:	When researchers last year unveiled the most promising treatment in the history of AIDS, a triple-drug attack
that can drive the virus to undetectable levels, they warned of a potential dark side.  If the patient doesn't
take the 14 to 26 pills every day, the virus could evolve into a super-resistant strain.<p>

  Big investor-owned hospital chains, now far along in a torrid consolidation of
          for-profit hospitals that is reshaping the nation's health care, have been
          accelerating their takeovers of nonprofit hospitals.  State officials worry that too
          many of these tax-exempt institutions, long regarded as the mainstay of public
          health care, will be gobbled up by the national chains without any public
          scrutiny.

     As the Raley's Gold Rush Classic has grown in popularity and attendance over the
years, so has its contribution to local charities.  Under the guidance of Dr. Don Rollofson and
Dr. Jerry Ortner, the dental program provided free treatment to 459 area underprivileged
children last October.  The fifth annual Dental Days featured 85 dentists, 430 hygienists and
180 dental assistants, office staff and volunteers at 10 clinics, providing nearly $133,000 in
free services.  They included exams, X-rays, cleanings, fluoride treatments, sealants, fillings

        In 1992, California doctors tried to reform the state's health care system with an
initiative and got trounced.  In 1994, a coalition of seniors, doctors and unions tried again. 
Same result.  This year, it is the nurses' turn.  In two different initiatives backed by two
different nurses' unions, their focus is on the health maintenance organizations that are quickly
taking over the state's health care system.

<B> Network of Doctors, Touted as a Panacea, Develops Big Problems - Nikhil Deogun
</B><I> 

     The Wall Street Journal -- 9/26/96 -- A1</I><P>


     Steven Scott had a simple prescription for profiting from the changes roiling the
nation's health-care system: Gather together as many doctors as possible and let them run the
show.   They did - but the show flopped.  Coastal Physician Group Inc. was a pioneer in the
business of building networks of physician practices.  Dr. Scott, its founder, was hailed as a
visionary.  Today, his dream of a physician-led revolution has turned into a nightmare.  Major
clients and top executives have fled.  Coastal is abandoning many of its businesses, selling
clinics and trying to resuscitate its original activity, staffing hospitals.

buy about $49 million in dental supplies annually.

        If you can't brush your teeth after a meal, rinse your mouth with water, advises the
Academy of General Dentistry.  The rinsing will neutralize acids that can erode tooth enamel
and will reduce decay-causing bacteria by 30 percent

<B>     Health Care Initiatives Lagging -- Sabin Russell</B><I>

      San Francisco Chronicle -- 9/17/96 -- A2</I><P>

      Two California initiatives taking aim at health maintenance organizations have made
little impression on state voters and have little support among those who are familiar with
them, according to a new Field Poll.  The poll by the San Francisco-based Field Institute
found that 69 percent of probable voters were unaware of either Proposition 214, which
backers call the HMO Patients Rights Initiative, or Proposition 216, which supporters call the
Patient Protection Act.  Among the 31 percent that knew of either measure, voters were
inclined to reject them by a 2-to-1 ratio.  But the informed voters represented only a fraction
of the electorate: 10 percent of the probable voters favor the initiatives, and 5 percent opposed
them.

California-based Foundation Health Corp., which runs HMOs and other health networks in 10

<B> `1201' Invites You to Open Wide and Say `Ahh' -- Mike Dunne</B><I>

     The Sacramento Bee -- 9/6/96 -- Ticket 12</I><P>

     The prospect of dining at a restaurant owned by dentists conjures up all sorts of
worrisome images.  Before being seated will we have to wait interminably in a lobby with
nothing but 4-year-old copies of Newsweek to amuse us?  Good grief, will they even serve
dessert at all?  Will the bill be accompanied by a sample packet of floss?
     Put your fears aside if your destination is the new Restaurant 1201 on the ground floor
of the downtown Sacramento skyscraper commonly know as the Ban Roll-on Building.  Both
the restaurant and the building are owned and operated by the California Dental Association. 
Before we get to the toothsome food - sorry - there's something else you need to know of
Restaurant 1201: Contrary to the image of dentists as a fairly conservative lot, this place bucks
the trend of quick, casual and cheap cafes.  For the first time in several years, a restaurant has
opened downtown with big tables, Chippendale-style chairs, damask linens and other formal
and stylish touches. They've assembled a busy and ambitious menu, with dishes ranging from
updated versions of the classics to more fashionable entrees out of the country's hottest
culinary region, the Pacific Northwest.  Clearly, this is no dental office, although awaiting
you in the restroom is a bottle of mint-flavored mouthwash presented prominently on a slab of
rough-cut marble.

<B>     Doctors' Pay Falls for the First Time on Record -- Associated Press</B><I>

     The Sacramento Bee -- 9/3/96 -- D1</I><P>

     After years of climbing salaries, physicians are seeing their earnings drop in large part
because managed care has worked to control costs.  "This is a remarkable turnaround," said
Carol Simon, an economics professor at the university of Illinois and co-author of a new
study.  "This is the first time we've seen a reduction in take-home pay." It hasn't gone
unnoticed by doctors, especially specialists, whose incomes have fallen the sharpest.  With an
average income of $187,000 in 1994, doctors were still among the highest-paid workers in
America.  But that was 4 percent less than in 1993, according to the report published in the
journal of Health Affairs.  It's the first decrease since statistics were first compiled in 1982. 
On average income has risen nearly 6 percent annually; 2.2 percent when inflation is taken
into account.  Managed care gets much of the blame - or credit - depending on the point of
view, for the drop.

<B> Drug Reaction Blamed for Boy's Death -- Marshall Wilson</B><I>

     San Francisco Chronicle -- 8/23/96 -- A30</I><P>

     The San Mateo County coroner has determined that a 5-year-old San Carlos boy died
in June from a rare reaction to drugs given before a dental procedure.  "It's one of those
one-in-a-million things that happen," Deputy Coroner Steve Hortin said yesterday. "There's
no
indication of negligence on (the dentist's) part."  Benjamin Shimshock died June 26 after being
given medications at a Burlingame oral surgeon's office.  The cause of death is respiratory
failure caused by "apparent idiosyncratic reaction to sedative medication," Hortin said.  The
boy was given the drugs Robinul, Versed and Brevital.  Dr. David Rothman, a pediatric
dentist and a spokesman for the California Dental Association, said the drugs are commonly
used.  He said the doses Benjamin was given were "very, very low," and that a reaction is
extremely rare.  Benjamin had no history of medical problems or allergies, Hortin said.  The
boy experienced a reaction in the dentist's chair at about 8:15a.m. and was rushed to
Peninsula Hospital, where he died.

<B> Television Ads Attack Pair of Anti-HMO Initiatives -- Carl T. Hall </B><I>

     San Francisco Chronicle -- 8/15/96 -- B1</I><P>

     The same folks who helped turn the Clinton health insurance plan into a laughingstock
are now trying to do the same to a pair of anti-HMO initiatives on the California ballot this
fall.  Attack ads ridiculing Propositions 214 and 216 began airing on television stations
throughout the state this week.  With three months to go before Election Day, the beleaguered
managed care industry promises a fierce self-defense campaign.  Backers of the two measures
-- which include labor unions, consumer groups and patient advocates - say they lack the
financial firepower to respond in kind.  Although some limited major media ads are planned,
they will come much closer to the election.  The message from the HMOs is simple: "No
matter what you think about managed care, these two initiatives make things worse," said
Janet Maira, spokeswoman for the industry-financed Taxpayers Against Higher Health Costs,
a coalition of health-care interests financing the new TV commercials.

 <B>    Bracing For Orthodontia -- Laurie Castaneda</B><I>

     San Francisco Chronicle -- 8/12/96 -- B1</I><P>

     Braces take a big bite out of a family's budget.  And to top things off, kids nowadays
are starting orthodontics earlier and getting treatment for longer periods of time.  When most
of today's parents were young, getting braces was a relatively simple process that usually
started around age 12.  To make more room for crowded teeth, the patient had some
permanent teeth pulled, then wore braces for about two years.  While some orthodontists and
parents still opt for the old one-step procedure, about 80 percent of cases now involve a
two-phase process that takes more time, money and office visits.  Instead of extracting
permanent
teeth, younger children's jaws are expanded using a variety of mouth appliances while they
still have all or most of their baby teeth.  This process starts around age 7 to 9 and takes about
1.5 years.  Next, patients wear a retainer or a holding wire until all or most their permanent
teeth have come in.  At that time, patients usually get a full set of braces and wear them for an
additional two years on average.

<B> Activists Protest Animal Research</B><I>

     The Daily Breeze (Torrance) -- 8/11/96 -- B4</I><P>

     Animal rights activists protested noisily outside Moscone Center on Saturday,
condemning Procter & Gamble for using animals in laboratory research.  About two dozen
protesters, including one in a bunny suit, held up signs that read "There's no excuse for
animal abuse" and "Demand Alternatives," as they handed out pamphlets to dentists and
dental health care workers attending an annual convention.  Procter & Gamble is one of the
participants in the three-day scientific meeting of dental health professionals, sponsored by the
California Dental Association.  Protester Joy Meininger has boycotted P&G products, which
range from laundry detergents to cooking oil, for more than 10 years.  She said she thinks
animal testing is not only cruel, but a waste of money as well.  But P&G spokesman Don
Tassone said animal testing is essential to ensure product safety for humans.

     Signs warning of mercury levels in fillings might soon be a nerve-touching addition to
the normal angst of visiting your dentist's office, thanks to an appellate court ruling this week. 
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled Monday that the Environmental
Law foundation can file a suit to require warnings for fillings containing dental amalgam, a
mixture of mercury and adhesives.  The legal twist comes after years of studies and
controversy over amalgam fillings.  Health activists say the public deserves to know about
possible effects of mercury, which is on a state list of chemicals known to cause birth defects. 
Dental groups, however, say the danger to the public is minuscule.  Both sides cite various
studies.  The signs are unnecessary, said Caroline Turner, executive director of the
Santa-Barbara Ventura County Dental Society, which represents 600 member dentists in the
two
counties.

<B> House Approves Health-Insurance Bill as Both Parties Take Credit for
     Measure -- Laurie McGinley</B><I>

     The Wall Street Journal -- 8/2/96 -- A16</I><P>

     Long-awaited legislation to improve access to health insurance was approved by
the House, 421-2, as politicians scrambled to claim credit for the popular election-year
measure.  At an afternoon news conference, House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.),
said the legislation, which will make it easier for workers to keep coverage when they
change jobs or get sick, is a "direct descendant" of earlier Republican health proposals.

<B>     Health-Care Costs for Employers Slow Dramatically -- Robert
Rosenblatt</B><I>

     Los Angeles Times -- 8/1/96 -- D1</I><P>

     In a startling shift, health care is becoming a bargain for employers as inflation
disappears and more of health care's financial burden is shifted to workers, the Labor
Department reported Wednesday.  The cost of health care for business rose a
minuscule 0.1% during the year ending in June, the lowest medical inflation rate in 13
years of record-keeping, according to a social department study.

Plan That Makes Everyone Smile!</h1>
<hr>
<p>

<p>

Some people think that a dental benefit plan that pleases both employers and employees is
about as likely as turning a frog into a prince.  They've jumped to the wrong conclusion. 
Large and small employers across the nation are using a simple, cost-effective strategy for
providing dental benefits.  It's called Direct Reimbursement.<p>

<p>

<h2><center>Direct Reimbursement: It's Not The Traditional
Story</h2>
</center>
<p>

Traditional dental plans attempt to contain costs by limiting services, treatment and even
providers.  Direct Reimbursement, on the other hand, reduces costs by eliminating third-party
involvement in the benefits payment process.  It is self-funding strategy that allows employers
to administer their own in-house dental plan.  Here's how it works.  Employees covered by
Direct Reimbursement:<p>

<p>

1.  Go to the dentist of their choice, <p>

2.  Pay for the treatment.<p>

3.  Present a paid receipt to their employer.<p>

<p>

The employer then pays dental benefits directly to employees by reimbursing them for all, or a
portion of, expenses up to a predetermined maximum benefit allowance.<p>

<p>

<h2><center>Direct Reimbursement Everybody Wins</h2>
</center>
<p>

<h3>Direct Reimbursement Is Cost Effective</h3>
<p>

Direct Reimbursement often costs 25-35 percent less than fully insured dental plans.  That's
because Direct Reimbursement eliminates costly overhead expenses such as sales commissions,
insurance company profits and third party administrative fees.  And because employees are
reimbursed only for actual expenses, no premium monies are wasted on unused benefits.<p>

<p>

<h3>Direct Reimbursement Is Simple</h3>
<p>

With Direct Reimbursement there are usually no deductibles and few, if any, treatment
exclusions.  Benefits are generally stated as a percentage of actual dental expenses up to an
annual maximum benefit allowance.  Because employees understand how expenses will be
reimbursed, confusion and complaints are virtually eliminated.<p>

<p>

<h3>Direct Reimbursement Is Flexible</h3>
<p>

Employers can tailor a plan to meet the specific needs of their group and their budget. 
Companies converting to Direct Reimbursement can mirror the benefits of their previous plan. 
Groups that have never offered a dental plan can begin conservatively and increase benefits in
their second or third plan year.  <p>

<p>

<h3>Direct Reimbursement Allows Freedom of Choice</h3>
<p>

Direct Reimbursement preserves what surveys show employees feel is the most important
aspect of a dental plan - the right to choose their own dentist.<p>

<p>

<h3>Direct Reimbursement: A Common Sense Approach</h3>
<p>

Direct Reimbursement encourages employees to get involved in their own care.  It allows
employees and dentists to agree on treatment plans that are clinically appropriate and cost
effective.  Unlike traditional plan, Direct Reimbursement does not insulate employees form
dental care costs.  As employees save money, so do their employers.<p>

<p>

<h2><center>Look To Us For Help</h2>
</center>
<p>

Direct Reimbursement gets to the heart of what employees and employers want: Simple, cost
effective, non-restrictive dental benefits.  Remember, when you opt for Direct
Reimbursement, your dental benefit dollars <i>go directly to paying for care,</i> not for insurance
company overhead and profits.<p>

<h3>What is Direct Reimbursement?</h3>
Direct Reimbursement is a self-funding strategy that allows employers to provide dental benefits
without insurance company involvement.  Here's how it works:<p>

<b>Employees covered by Direct Reimbursement:</b><p>

1.	Visit the dentist of their choice<br>

2.  	Pay for treatment<br>

3.	Present a paid receipt to their employer who then reimburses them for covered expenses.<p>

<hr>
<p>

<h3>Does Direct Reimbursement reduce costs?</h3>
Yes!  If an employer provides benefits through a fully-insured dental plan, as much as one-third of
the premium may be applied to administrative costs.  With Direct Reimbursement, no insurance
company makes a profit, no sales agent makes a commission.  The elimination of such overhead
expenses often results in savings off 25 to 35 percent.<p>

<hr>
<p>

<h3>What are other advantages of Direct Reimbursement?  </h3>
<h4>Simplicity - </b>Employees are reimbursed for a portion for their expenses up to a maximum
benefit allowance.  Usually there are no deductibles and few, if any, excluded treatment
procedures.<b></h4>
<h4>Right to Choose - </b>Direct Reimbursement preserves employees' right to receive treatment from
the dentist of their choice.<b></h4>
<h4>Flexibility - </b>Employers tailor benefits to meet their budget allocations.  Many employers who
thought they could never afford dental plans are now offering attractive benefits through Direct
Reimbursement.<b></h4>
<hr>
<p>

<h3>How does Direct Reimbursement benefit dentists?</h3>
Direct Reimbursement eliminates insurance company intrusions.  You and your patients make
treatment decisions based on their individual needs.  Direct Reimbursement eliminates:<p>

<p>

	"pre-authorization of treatment" disputes<br>

	"least expensive alternative treatment" limitations<br>

	fee disputes resulting from out-dated UCR Tables<p>

<hr>
<p>

<h3>What do employees think of Direct Reimbursement?</h3>
Employees appreciate the ability to make their own decisions.  Direct Reimbursement allows them
the freedom to see the dentist of their choice and the ability to receive the treatment they feel is in
their best interest.  Since they are not insulated from costs, they have an incentive to ask questions
and explore treatment options.  This leads to healthy communication between patients and
doctors.<p>

<hr>
<p>

<h3>How can you help?</h3>
Because Direct Reimbursement eliminates insurance company profits, few insurance brokers
promote the concept.  Employers will not hear about Direct Reimbursement unless you tell them. 
Here's how you can help.<p>

1.	Keep Direct Reimbursement promotional materials in your office so you can share information
with interested patients.  If you need materials, contact CDA at 1-800-736-7071, ext. 4480. <p>

2.	Involve your office staff.  Discuss Direct Reimbursement in staff meetings on a regular basis. 
Encourage your staff members to recommend Direct Reimbursement to any patient experiencing
insurance company payment difficulties.  Post CDA's "Employer Referral" sticker on your phone
and instruct staff to contact CDA any time they speak to a DR prospect.<p>

3.	Identify patients and friends who are in decision-making positions where they work.  Recommend
they consider Direct Reimbursement the next time they review their employee benefits package.

<h2>Direct reimbursement benefits dentists, too</h2>
<hr>

<h3>California dentists are introducing the concept of direct
reimbursement to patients and employers.</h3>
<p>

As some of the dentists in California are finding out, the concept of direct reimbursement
offers a viable alternative to traditional, dental-insurance plans.  And it is proving to be
effective in alleviating typical insurance headaches for patients, employers and dentists.<p>

<p>

Convinced of its benefits, California dentists like David Blende, William Van Dyk and Bill
Cannon are taking it upon themselves to introduce the concept of direct reimbursement to
patients and employers.  And the doctors are receiving strong support from organized
dentistry at local and state levels.<p>

<p>

<h4>The Concept Defined</h4>
<p>

As defined by Douglas Bush, director of Dental Benefits Consulting for the California Dental
Association, direct reimbursement is a self-funding strategy that allows employers to pay
dental benefits directly to employees by reimbursing them for dental expenses.  This
eliminates the middle man, namely the insurance company.<p>

<p>

In marked contrast to traditional plans, explains Bush, a direct-reimbursement plan usually has
a simple, easily-understood and administered benefits schedule, which often is a single
reimbursement rate, regardless of the type of dental treatment.  It also gives an employee the
right to choose his/her own dentist while allowing employers the flexibility to tailor benefits to
meet budget allocations without worrying about insurance-premium increases.<p>

<p>

A direct-reimbursement plan is more than just a self-insured plan, emphasizes Bush.  Some
benefit consultants call direct reimbursement the "purest form of self-insurance."  The fact is,
while most companies with more than 100 employees have self-insured dental plans, many are
administered by insurance companies and subject to traditional-insurance headaches.  All
direct-reimbursement plans are self-insured, but not all self-insured plans are direct
reimbursement.<p>

<p>

<h4>Dentists as Advocates</h4>
<p>

Mari Edgar, the controller at PTRL West, Inc. of Richmond, California, was looking for a
dental plan that could improve the health-benefits package the company was offering its 45
employees.<p>

<p>

PTRL's problems with its existing, traditional, dental plan are common to many employers,
including dental offices.  They included having to pay premiums for benefits that many
employees do not use; having a good portion of benefit dollars going to support insurance-company overhead, commissions and charges; and having to deal with an excess of frustrating
tape.<p>

<p>

"Our existing dental-insurance plan wasn't doing much with our dollars," says Edgar.  "Our
copayment costs were more than what the dental plan was paying out.  We were funding a lot
of money into the plan but were receiving less.  Out of the $9,000 we paid into the plan in one
year, only $1,200 was paid out in claims.  It got to the point where employees weren't using
the benefit."<p>

<p>

Edgar happened to ask her dentist, Dr. Van Dyk, if he knew of any plan that could improve
PTRL's situation.  He immediately took the opportunity to introduce her to the concept of
direct reimbursement.<p>

<p>

"I learned about direct reimbursement through meetings, magazines, newsletters and
information packets provided by the California Dental Association," says Dr. Van Dyk, a
CDA member.<p>

<p>

"I was convinced direct reimbursement provided a cost-effective and easy-to-manage
alternative.  I briefly outlined the concept and its benefits to Edgar and gave her an
information packet provided by CDA.  When Edgar expressed interest in exploring the
possibility of adopting direct reimbursement, I put her in touch with Doug Bush at CDA.  His
department provided free consultation and helped her set up a direct-reimbursement-based
dental plan at PTRL."<p>

<p>

Long &amp; Levit, a 200-employee law firm in San Francisco, came to learn about direct
reimbursement through Dr. Blende, a local dentist and a CDA member.<p>

<p>

Dr. Blende came across direct reimbursement about five years ago when it was a pilot project
of the Santa Barbara-Ventura County Dental Society.  When the direct-reimbursement
promotion later was expanded to a statewide program, he volunteered to participate in the
program.  "I was convinced that direct reimbursement was a winner," says Dr. Blende.<p>

<p>

It was during a sailing vacation short time later that Dr. Blende recommended the concept to
Howard Garfield, who then was the managing partner at Long &amp; Levit.<p>

<p>

"We talked about our businesses and the topic turned to health-care costs," Dr. Blende recalls. 
"I suggested that he look into direct reimbursement.  Howard took the idea back to the law
firm.  When the firm showed interest, I put them in touch with Doug Bush at CDA.  His
department helped the firm implement a direct-reimbursement dental plan."<p>

<p>

According to Vicki Arch, benefits director of the law firm, the plan has just under 200
participants and averages about 40-45 claims per month.<p>

<p>

The firm has not added any personnel to administer the plan.  Arch spends about an hour a
week to administer and evaluate claims.  The reimbursement checks are issued by the
accounts-payable department.<p>

<p>

Dr. John Rathbone, a retired orthodontist from the Santa Barbara-Ventura County Dental
Society, is among those who pioneered direct reimbursement in California.<p>

<p>

"We first heard about direct reimbursement about 10 years ago through the American
Association of Orthodontists," says Dr. Rathbone, who continues to be active in organized
dentistry and in promoting direct reimbursement.  "I initially was interested in direct
reimbursement because traditional insurance did not cover orthodontia and direct
reimbursement offered a way employers could offer this coverage to employees.  Once I
learned more about it, I was convinced direct reimbursement offered a cost-effective solution
to many employers' dental-insurance dilemmas.  In the last six years, I must have talked to 30-35 organizations about direct reimbursement, and many of them now are enjoying its
benefits."<p>

<p>

Dr. Rathbone urges dentists to "get out there and push it.  Talk to patients who are in
administrative positions.  In my experience, it works well for companies with 100-200
employees and for nonprofit organizations.  My greatest satisfaction comes when employers
tell me how well direct reimbursement is working for them."<p>

<p>

<h4>Direct Reimbursement Works</h4>
<p>

"Direct reimbursement does work," says Garfield of Long &amp; Levit.  "[With direct
reimbursement], the employer saves money.  The employees are more satisfied because they
get to choose their own dentist and can plan their own program of care that spreads the cost of
care over time.  So, it is a win-win situation for everybody: the employer saves money, it
doesn't significantly increase administrative costs and the employees are happy.  And that is
what a benefit program is supposed to do."<p>

<p>

For PTRL too, the switch to direct reimbursement is working.  "Although at $25 per
employee, per month, we spend only a few dollars less than before, our dollars are directly
benefiting employees and not any third parties," says PTRL's Edgar.  According to Edgar,
each employee has a $1,000 annual-expense allowance.  The first $100 in benefits is
reimbursed at 100 percent; the next $200 is reimbursed at 80 percent; thereafter, the plan
reimburses at 50 percent until the maximum allowance is reached."<p>

<p>

And for Tom Hopkins Construction Company in Santa Cruz, California, the switch to a
direct-reimbursement-based dental plan was one of the very best business decisions the
company has made, according to John Sabine, the company vice president.<p>

<p>

"Now that we are two years into the plan, all of the employees are enthusiastic," says Sabine,
whose company was introduced to direct reimbursement by Dr. Cannon, a local dentist and
CDA member.  "We have been able to expand a little on the actual dental coverage,"
continues Sabine.  "For example, we allow cosmetic work to be done and we don't have
lifetime cap on orthodontic care.  We do have a $750-a-year cap [per person].   Our savings
over two years has been 60 percent [compared to a third-party insurance plan].  With the
savings, our company now has introduced vision care, a service we did not have before."<p>

<p>

<h4>Benefits</h4>
<p>

According to Dr. Blende, "Dentists should realize that direct reimbursement is a sound
concept that works for patients, employers and dentists.  It is, perhaps, the last stand against
the encroachment of dentistry by third-party payers.  The concept preserves the patient's right
to choose.  With direct reimbursement, the dentists's office does not have to deal with any
insurance paperwork.  It allows dentists to have a solid, one-on-one relationship with patients,
the kind of relationship the profession enjoyed in the '40s and '50s when dentists and patients,
and not somebody else, were able to decide that was the best care for the patient."  As Dr.
Gordon J. Christensen, a prominent proponent of direct reimbursement, explains it, direct
reimbursement is the kind of concept that allows freedom and gives people the ability to
choose for themselves the kind of oral therapy they desire.  Direct reimbursement allows a
continuation of excellent oral care because a person may elect to start with something simple
and build over the years until his/her oral care reaches a point where only slight maintenance
is required.<p>

<p>

"Most dentists have had patients tell them they can't get certain dental care because their third-party payer will not reimburse for it," continues Dr. Christensen.  "That has impeded the
progress of proper oral therapy.  On the other hand, a dentist working with patients on a
direct-reimbursement-based plan does not have this impediment.  With direct reimbursement,
the election for the type of treatment to be performed is the patient's choice, based upon the
education the dentist gives the patient."<p>

<p>

Therefore, there is no lack of ability to do proper dentistry, Dr. Chistensen reasons.  It may
be spread over a number of years, but gradually the dentist will be able to provide optimum
care for the patient who is on a direct-reimbursement plan.<p>

<p>

Some dentists may be reluctant to introduce the plan to employers because they feel that it is
too self-serving.  Dr. Christensen disagrees.  "If we believe that the patient and the dentist
together can make an educated prognosis about what should be done for a given mouth, then it
is not restrictive in any way.  It is an open, free-enterprise approach to dental care," he adds.<p>

<p>

CDA's Bush, who has been promoting the direct-reimbursement concept for over six years,
firmly believes that direct reimbursement benefits employers and employees, as well as
dentists.<p>

<p>

For example, PTRL's success with direct reimbursement has been positive for Dr. Van Dyk.<p>

<p>

"More of their employees now are coming in for dental care because of the direct-reimbursement plan, and they all seem satisfied with it," says Dr. Van Dyk.  "In addition, we
do not have to fill out extensive, insurance-reimbursement forms for each employee who
comes to us.  Preauthorization is not required.<p>

<p>

"Dental-care decisions now are left to my patients and me, not to a third party," Dr. Van Dyk
continues.  "To facilitate payment and reduce the burden on the patient, we have arranged for
the company to pay us its share directly.  The patient pays his/her portion at the time of
receiving care, and we present a bill for the remainder to the company.  Instead of waiting 60-90 days for the insurance company to pay us, now we get paid in a matter of days.  They like
it; we like it.  They benefit; we benefit."<p>

<p>

<h4>Dentists Hold Key</h4>
<p>

As more and more California dentists introduce direct reimbursement to employers, success
stories are cropping up across the state.<p>

<p>

"I lost count of the success stories a long time ago," says Bush.  "Direct reimbursement really
does allow employers to simplify and improve benefits, while still realizing significant
savings.  One of the most satisfying aspects of my job is seeing employers who have had a
great experience with the concept refer other employers to us."<p>

<p>

Although employer-to-employer referrals are welcomed, Bush contends that dentists are the
real key to a successful direct-reimbursement-promotion program.  "In California, we receive
half of our employer contacts from our member-dentists, but these referrals result in 80
percent of our implemented plans," explains Bush.  "Almost all employers entrust their dental
care to their personal dentist.  It only makes sense that these employers also value their
dentists' input regarding quality dental plans.  That's why we encourage our members to be
proactive.  Don't wait for someone to complain about his/her dental plan. Instead, go ahead
and tell that person you've got information about a plan that he/she should consider."<p>

<p>

Despite the apparent advantages, many dental practitioners are hesitant to talk about the
concept.  Bush explains that most referrals can be traced to a relatively small percentage of
CDA's membership.<p>

<p>

"I think most dentists are familiar with the basic, direct-reimbursement concept, but they don't
understand the mechanics of how it works.  There is a natural resistance to recommending a
dental-plan concept, if they are unsure of how to respond to the questions that might follow,"
says Bush.  "That is why we encourage our members to play the role of prospectors.  They
don't have to understand all of the ins and outs of direct reimbursement to introduce a business
leader to the concept.  Once the employer contacts my office, we explain the concept in
detail."<p>

<p>

And Dr.  Blende agrees.  "Dentists need not know the 'nut and bolts' of how direct
reimbursement works in order to benefit form it.  They only need to understand the basic
premise.  Once dentists introduce employers to the concept, they can bring in the experts to
explain various aspects and help employers set up a direct-reimbursement-based plan."<p>

<p>

As managed care continues to influence how dental benefits are provided, Bush feels it is
imperative for dentist-input to be heard.  "I recently read an article in a major employee-benefits magazine that sang the praises of capitated dental plans.  It claimed that, when
compared to fee-for-service plans, capitation provided better quality assurance at safer dental
offices," says Bush.  "When employers read those kind of articles, it influences the dental
plans they choose for their employees.  Dentists must realize it is up to them to communicate
the advantages of fee-for-service dental plans that allow employees to choose their own
dentist.  Direct reimbursement is a great concept, but because it eliminates third-party profits,
few insurance agents or benefit professional promote the strategy.  If dentists don't promote
direct reimbursement, it is unlikely employers will ever hear about the concept."<p>

<p>

<h4>Organizing for Success</h4>
<p>

California's success with promoting direct reimbursement can be attributed to a coordinated
effort by dentists with the help of the California Dental Association.  In emulating California's
example, following are some basic steps other states can take to get the direct reimbursement
ball rolling:<p>

<p>

  <b>Involvement</b> - Involve your local dental society and the statewide organization.<p>

  <b>Education</b> - Educate dentists through organization newsletters, information packets,
seminars, meetings, etc.<p>

<b> Awareness</b> - Increase awareness through media coverage, speaking engagements at
business-association meetings, etc.<p>

 <b>Support </b>- Provide support to promotional efforts by offering free consulting services to
businesses, establishing an 800-number for easy access to information.<p>

<p>

<h2>Who Benefits Most From your Dental Plan?</h2>
<p>

Most employers don't know that up to a third of their dental premium may never benefit their
employees...it's applied to insurance company overhead and profits.<p>

<p>

That's why the California Dental Association promotes Direct Reimbursement.  DR is a self-funding strategy that allows employers to pay benefits directly to employees by reimbursing
them for their dental expenses.<p>

<p>

When compared to fully insured dental plan, Direct Reimbursement often results in savings of
25 to 35 percent.  This means more dental benefits for employees and big savings for
employers!<p>

<p>

Direct Reimbursement also preserves the employee's 'Right to Choose'.  Unlike dental plans
that limit providers, DR lets you have complete freedom of choice in selecting your dentist.<p>

<p>

Since DR eliminates the need for insurance, few agents are anxious to talk about the concept. 
That's why we're offering our help.<p>

<title>Feel Threatened by Managed Care?</title>

<h1>Feel Threatened by Managed Care?</h1><img src="octo.jpg" align=right hspace=10>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>Do you feel your practice is threatened by managed
care?</h2>
<p>

If you do, you're not alone.  Tough economic times have forced many employers to drop their
fee-for-service dental plans for managed care plans - plans that may require your patients to
change dentists in order to receive dental benefits.<p>

<p>

<h2>What can you do?</h2>
<p>

You can join managed care plans as a participating provider, but there's a downside.  Some
plans require you to substantially discount your fees.  Others contractually obligate you to
treat the patients assigned to your office for a fixed monthly "capitation fee."  With this type
of plan, you assume the insurance risk.  If utilization is high, your overhead costs may exceed
the capitation fee you're paid to provide dental services.<p>

<p>

<h2>But what if I choose not to join managed care plans?</h2>
<p>

The decision to join or not to join a managed care plan is one that you must make for yourself,
after carefully evaluating the legal and financial impact it could have on your practice.  But
whether or not you choose to be a managed care provider, you can strengthen your base of
fee-for-service patients by helping promote Direct Reimbursement.<p>

<p>

<h2>What is Direct Reimbursement?</h2>
<p>

Direct Reimbursement is a self-funding strategy that allows employers to provide dental
benefits for employees without insurance company involvement.  Patients pay their dentist for
treatment on a fee-for-service basis.  They are then reimbursed by their employer for all or a
portion of their expenses up to an annual maximum allowance.<p>

<p>

<h2>What are the advantages of Direct Reimbursement?</h2>
<p>

Direct Reimbursement is simple to use and easy to understand.  Employees can receive
treatment form the dentist of their choice and can use their benefit allowance on the treatment
that they and their dentist feel best meets their dental needs.  Because insurance overhead and
profits are eliminated, the concept is extremely cost-effective.  Employers often report savings
of 20, 40 even 60 percent.<p>

<p>

<h2>How can you help?</h2>
<p>

We need you to help us introduce employers to the Direct Reimbursement strategy.  It's easy. 
Just keep copies of our informational brochure or audiotape in your office.  Share the
information with patients and friends, especially those who are decision-makers where they
work.  Recommend that they consider Direct Reimbursement when the next review their
employee benefit package.  Tell them that Direct Reimbursement allows them to provide
quality, cost-effective dental benefits, without sacrificing their employees' right to choose their
dentist.<p>

<p>

Use the attached reply card to put us in touch with an employer who you feel can benefit from
information about Direct Reimbursement.  We'll send him or her an information packet. 
We'll also offer sample plan designs, cost estimates and sample administrative forms and
documents.  Our assistance is free of charge, a public service of CDA.<p>

<p>

<h2><center>Dental Group Recommends Direct Reimbursement</h2>

Reprinted from THE HERALD, Monterey, California<br>
March 1, 1992<br>
</center>
<p>

<p>

Imagine the perfect employee dental benefit plan: no deductibles, no excluded treatment
procedures and, best of all, no premiums.<p>

<p>

Impossible?  Not so--at least, not according to the dentists of the Monterey Bay Dental
Society.  They are actively promoting a totally new approach to group dental benefits, called
Direct Reimbursement.<p>

<p>

"This is a great concept that employers need to hear about," said Leon H. Cooper, D.D.S.,
president of the 333-member dental organization.  "I've made promoting this strategy to
employers in the Monterey Bay area one of the priorities in my term of office.  It's a
concept that benefits everyone involved: employees, employers, and the dentists providing
the dental care."<p>

<p>

According to Cooper, Direct Reimbursement greatly simplifies how benefits are provided. 
Instead of paying a premium to an insurance company, the employer keeps monies budgeted
for a dental plan, usually depositing them into an interest bearing checking account. 
Employees visit the dentist of their choice and receive treatment.  They pay the dentist and
present a receipt to their employer, documenting that an expense was incurred.  The
employer reimburses employees for all or part of the expenses, up to an annual maximum
allowance.<p>

<p>

"There are usually no deductibles, waiting periods or excluded treatment procedures," said
Cooper.  "The 'red tape' found in traditional plans is eliminated.  The plan makes benefits
easy for employees to understand and easy for the employer to administer."<p>

<p>

According to Cooper, one of the most attractive features of the plan if its cost-efficiency. 
Insurance agent commissions and insurance company profits are eliminated.  There are no
unused premiums because the employer incurs no expense until an employee visits the dentist
and requests reimbursement.<p>

<p>

John Sabine, vice president and chief operations officer of Tom Hopkins Construction
Company in Santa Cruz, is quick to endorse the costs-efficiency of the Direct Reimbursement
strategy.  Before joining Hopkins Construction he worked for a large company that was
exploring ways of improving cost efficiency.<p>

<hr>

<strong>"Employee Satisfaction is excellent . . . Benefits are clear and our employees receive faster payment."
</strong><hr>

"We looked at our dental plan and compared what we were paying in premium to what the
insurance company was paying back in claims," said Sabine.  "It was clear the insurance
company was doing very well, so we started self-funding our dental plan."<p>

<p>

The company eventually implemented a vision care plan and was able to pay both dental and
vision benefits for the same cost of their former dental premium.  It wasn't until two years
later, after joining Hopkins Construction, that a local dentist, Dr. Bill Cannon, recommended
Direct Reimbursement to Sabine.  It was the same self-funding strategy Sabine's previous
employer had used.<p>

<p>

"We thought we had invented the idea," said Sabine.<p>

<p>

With the help of consultants from the California Dental Association, Sabine implemented a
Direct Reimbursement plan for the 40 employees at Hopkins Construction which went into
effect in August 1991.  Their early experience with the plan has been very favorable.<p>

<p>

"Now, we are paying ourselves," said Sabine.  "The monies we would have paid in
premiums are deposited into a separate account.  We are building a significant reserve.  So
far only 35% of the monies deposited have been used to pay benefits."<p>

<p>

According to Sabine, they intend to use the reserve monies to enhance employees benefits in
other areas.  "We want to improve the overall medical care...perhaps start a vision care
program.  We have seven months to go for a first year review, but it would appear there will
be sufficient funds to do that."<p>

<p>

Marc Fearnehough, owner of Appliance Service Center in Santa Cruz, heard about the
concept from Sabine and Dr. Cannon.  The conversation prompted him to study the claims
experience of the plan that covered his 11 employees.  Getting the data was not easy.  His
insurance company would not give him the information.  After several months of persistent
inquiries, he got the claims data he was looking for.<p>

<p>

"Our former plan was not a good value," said Fearnehough.  "Only 46 percent of what we
paid in premiums was returned to employees in the form of benefits."<p>

<p>

Fearnehough adopted a Direct Reimbursement plan in August 1991.  Under the new plan, he
pays employees directly when they go to the dentist.  They present receipts documenting
their expenses and he reimburses them for 80 percent of their actual expenses, up to an $800
annual maximum benefit.<p>

<p>

"Employee satisfaction is excellent," said Fearnehough.  "Reimbursement is based on a set
percentage, we eliminated deductibles.  Benefits are clear and our employees receive faster
payment.  The plan has cost us 45.5% of our previous premium, so we're saving about
55%."<p>

<p>

Fearnehough feels an added benefit of Direct Reimbursement is reduced administrative costs
in the dental office.  "We've learned some dentists actually offer a discount if payment is
made in cash.  Direct Reimbursement apparently reduces their overhead costs."<p>

<p>

Doug Bush, director of benefit consulting for the California Dental Association assisted both
groups in establishing their plans.  He said he was not surprised by early savings the two
groups have experienced.<p>

<p>

"Most groups converting their traditional insured plans to Direct Reimbursement have a
potential savings of 25 - 35%.  The actual cost will vary from group to group and from year
to year, based on utilization of the plan.  Both these groups knew their utilization was low. 
They were paying premiums for a number of employees who weren't using their benefits. 
That made them ideal candidates for Direct Reimbursement."<p>

<p>

Bush works closely with local dental societies promoting the Direct Reimbursement concept. 
He aids employers in designing plans, projecting costs and preparing the plan documents
required for self-funded employee reimbursement plans.  His services are offered as a public
service by the California Dental Association.<p>

<p>

"Doug will be back in the Monterey area on March 12 and 13 to meet with employers
interested in learning more about Direct Reimbursement," said Dr. Cooper.  "This is nothing
we're selling: it's information we're sharing.  We think the business community will find the
information very helpful."<p>

<p>

<b>WHAT IS A PERIODONTIST?  $48.00 per 100 (includes shipping, handling; CA Resident
add 7.25% tax).   </b><p>

<p>

This brochure answers the questions of patients who are about to be, or have been referred to a
periodontist from a general dentist, specialty dental practice, or allied professional.  The brochure
dispels common apprehensions of both the referring dentist and patient about returning to the
'home' practice and discusses such concerns as insurance coverage, surgery, X-Rays and loss of
teeth.<p>

<p>

An excellent referral tool for all dentists, hygienists and medical professionals.  A great practice
building tool for specialists and general practitioners alike.  <p>

<p>

<p>

<b>WHEN TO SEE A PERIODONTIST $48.00 per 100 (includes shipping, handling; CA
Residents add 7.25% tax).</b><p>

<p>

An easily understood introduction to periodontal disease.  This brochure includes a definition of
gum disease and how it is diagnosed.  It reinforces that surgery is not always part of treatment.<p>

<p>

Recommended as a patient education handout in the general dental or specialty practice.  It is
also for periodontists to give to patients prior to or at their first appointment.  A good education
tool for direct mail or distribution at health fairs.<p>

<p>

<b>A WORD ABOUT YOUR NEW MEDICATION $48.00 per 100 (includes shipping,
handling; CA Residents add 7.25% tax).</b><p>

<p>

Though calcium channel blockers are among the most frequently prescribed drugs in the United
States, many patients and physicians are not aware of the relationship between these drugs and
Gingival Hyperplasia (enlarged gums).  This brochure provides important information for
patients who take calcium channel blockers such as Procardia, Calan, or Cyclosporine-A, as well
as Dilantin, a drug used to control convulsions.<p>

<p>

This brochure is appropriate for use in both medical and dental practices. It includes a list of
drugs by (trade and generic name) currently known to cause gingival hyperplasia, photos of both
healthy and hyperplasic gums, warning signs and tips on dental hygiene.  The publication can be
useful as a referral enhancing or building tool with physicians (particularly cardiologists and
cardiovascular surgeons), and dentists.  It can also be used in periodontal practices for patients in
active and maintenance stages of treatment.<p>

<p>

<b>WHAT EVERY WOMAN SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE FEMALE HORMONE
PROGESTERONE AND GUM DISEASE $48.00 per 100 (includes shipping, handling; CA
Residents add 7.25% tax).<p>

</b><p>

Women of nearly any age can be affected by increased levels of the female hormone,
Progesterone.  Progesterone levels not only increase naturally during pregnancy, they are often
used alone, or combined in oral contraceptives, in menopausal drugs, and to treat a number of
conditions related to female reproduction.<p>

<p>

An increase in progesterone levels can cause or irritate gum disease: a fact of which many
physicians and patients are unaware.  <p>

<p>

This brochure is an excellent education tool for obstetricians, gynecologists and female patients
as well as for use in community education programs.  It is recommended for distribution to
pharmacies and women's organizations, in addition to dental practices.<p>

<p>

The publication includes a definition of gum disease, a list of medications containing
progesterones, warning signs of gum disease, and tips on how to care for teeth and gums. <p>

Frequently Asked Questions

<br>
<font size="+1>
about
<font size="+4"> CDA <b><I>Online</I></b>
</font></center>
<br clear=all>
<hr size=10>
<font size=+0">
<dl><dd>
<img src="qmark.gif"width=60 height=49 align=left><b>What is the World Wide Web, and how can I use it to connect to <I>CDA Online</I>?</b>
</dl>
<br clear=all>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The World Wide Web (WWW) is the <i>graphical</i> Internet Service. It has the most powerful linking abilities with all other Internet services, and is the fastest growing Internet Information Service. If you can connect to the World Wide Web, you can connect to <i>CDA Online</i>. And, you can connect to the Web, worldwide, through many different sources.

<dl><dd>
<img src="qmark.gif"width=60 height=49 align=left><b>What kind of computer and software do I need?  How do I connect to the World Wide Web?</b>
</dl>
<br clear=all>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Almost all personal computers can do it.  There are many software programs available for PC "compatible" and Macintosh machines.  For full enjoyment of the World Wide Web, and <i>CDA Online</i>, you'll want a machine with a high quality color display and a fast modem.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
You can connect to the Web via many sources; even the commercial online services like COMPUSERVE, PRODIGY and AMERICA ON-LINE now offer Web access. But to do it right, you should find an <b>I</b>nternet <b>S</b>ervice <b>P</b>rovider offering dial-up connections within your local dialing area. The ISP should offer high-speed (28.8 kbps) dial-up SLIP or PPP connections. We also recommend <a href="http://www.mcom.com">Netscape Navigator Software</a> - this is an excellent Web Browser that utilitizes the full capabilities of the WWW.<BR>


<dl><dd>
<img src="qmark.gif"width=60 height=49 align=left><b>How do I find an Internet Service Provider? And what is "SLIP" or "PPP"?</b>
</dl>
<br clear=all>&nbsp;&nbsp;
This can take some investigation on your part, as these services can vary in price and availability by location. But, if you are reading this via one of the commercial on-line services, you can do some investigation right now. Check out the <a href=
"http://www.yahoo.com/Regional_Information/States/California/">Yahoo list of Regional Internet Access Providers</A>, and this<a href="http://www.commerce.net/directories/news/inet.prov.dir.html"> Internet Service Providers Directory</A>. Remember, you want a SLIP or PPP account, with dial-in 28.8 kbps access.  Shop around before you buy for the best deal.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"SLIP" and "PPP" mean "Serial Line Interface Protocol" and "Point to Point Protocol". This type of connection is necessary for dial-up access to the WWW.




<dl><dd>
<img src="qmark.gif"width=60 height=49 align=left><b>How do I subscribe to <i>CDA Online</i>? How much does it cost?</b>
</dl>
<br clear=all>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>CDA Online</b> is available to members of the California Dental Association as a direct benefit of membership. There is an annual subscription fee for ADA members of $35 a year (after January 1, 1996). Terms for CDA/ADA non-members, institutional and foreign subscriptions are available from <a href="/cda/masthead.html">the CDA Online Masthead page.</a>


<dl><dd>
<img src="qmark.gif"width=60 height=49 align=left><b>Who do I contact with problems, suggestions or questions about this service?</b>
</dl>
<br clear=all>&nbsp;&nbsp;
From here, you can write e-mail to <a href=mailto:admin@cda.org><i>Adminstration at CDA Online</i></a>. You can also call the California Dental Association at 800-736-8702, or 916-443-3382.  Or, you can write the California Dental Association at: <i>CDA Online, Post Office Box 13749, Sacramento, CA. 95853. </i>

<title>INFECTION CONTROL REGULATIONS</title>
<meta name="CreatedBy" content="WP Internet Publisher 6.1">
</head>
<body>
<h2><center>BOARD OF DENTAL EXAMINERS</h2>
<h1>INFECTION CONTROL REGULATIONS</h1>
<hr>
<p>

</center>
<b>These amended regulations will be enforced as of August 7, 1996.</b> They replace the three sets of Centers
for Disease Control recommendations which the Board adopted as regulations in 1994.<p>

<p>

<u>1005. Minimum Standards for Infection Control</u><p>

<b>(a)</b> As used in this section:<p>

<blockquote>	    (1) "Universal precautions" is an approach to infection control according to which all
human blood and certain human body fluids are treated as if known to be infectious for HIV,
HBV and other blood-borne pathogens.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (2) "Critical instruments" are surgical and other instruments used to penetrate soft tissue
or bone.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (3) "Semi-critical instruments" are surgical and other instruments that are not used to
penetrate soft tissue or bone, but contact oral tissue.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (4) "Non-critical instruments and devices" are instruments and devices that contact
intact skin.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (5) "Surgical procedures" are entries into normally sterile areas of the body.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (6) "Low-level disinfection" is the least effective disinfection process.  It does not kill
bacterial spores or mycobacterium tuberculosis var bovis, a laboratory test organism used to
classify the strength of disinfectant chemicals.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (7) "Intermediate-level disinfection" kills mycobacterium tuberculosis var bovis that
indicates less resistant organisms such as hepatitis B and HIV are also killed.
	    (8) "High-level disinfection" kills some, but not necessarily all bacterial spores. This
process kills mycobacterium tuberculosis var bovis, and other bacteria, fungi and viruses.
</blockquote>
<p>

<b>(b)</b> Licensees with one or more employees shall comply with infection control precautions mandated by the
California Occupational Safety and Health Administration.  All licensees shall comply with the following
minimum precautions to minimize the transmission of pathogens in health care settings:<p>

<blockquote>	    (1) Universal precautions shall be practiced in the care of all patients.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (2) Medical exam gloves shall be worn whenever there is a potential for contact with
blood, blood-contaminated saliva, or mucous membranes.  Sterile gloves shall be worn in
connection with surgical procedures involving soft tissue or bone. Sterile coolants/irrigants shall
be used for surgical procedures involving soft tissue or bone. Sterile coolant/irrigants are
deemed to be sterile when delivered using a device or process that has a Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) marketing clearance for delivery of sterile/coolant irrigants to the patient. 
Delivery of sterile/coolant irrigants shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's directions.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (3) Health care workers shall wash hands and put on new gloves before treating each
patient. Antimicrobial soap shall be used to wash hands for surgical procedures. Health care
workers shall wash hands after removing and discarding gloves after treatment of each patient
or before leaving the operatory. Gloves shall not be washed before or after use.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (4) Health care workers shall wear surgical face masks and either chin length plastic face
shields or surgical masks and protective eye-wear when treating patients. After each patient,
and during patient treatment if applicable, masks shall be changed if moist or contaminated.
After each patient, face shields and protective eyewear shall be cleaned and disinfected, if
contaminated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (5) Health care workers shall wear reusable or disposable gowns when their clothing is
likely to be soiled with blood or other bodily fluids.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (6) Protective attire must be removed when leaving the laboratories and work areas.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (7) Items or surfaces such as, but not limited to, light handles which are impossible to
clean and disinfect, shall be protected with impervious barriers. Between patients, the covering
must be removed, discarded and replaced with clean covering.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (8) Splash shields shall be used in dental laboratories.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (9) Health care workers who have exudative lesions or weeping dermatitis shall refrain
from all direct patient care and from handling patient care equipment until the condition
resolves.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (10) Needles shall be recapped only by using the scoop technique or a mechanical device
designed for holding the needle sheath, or a mechanical device which eliminates the need for
two handed capping. Needles shall not be bent or broken prior to disposal. Disposable needles,
syringes, scalpel blades and/or other sharp items and instruments shall be placed into puncture
resistant containers for disposal.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (11) Heat stable critical and semi-critical instruments shall be cleaned and sterilized
before use by using steam under pressure (autoclaving), dry heat, or chemical vapor. EPA-registered sterilants/disinfectants shall be used for sterilization of heat-sensitive critical items
and for high-level disinfection of heat-sensitive semi-critical items.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (12) Heavy-duty utility gloves shall be worn to process instruments before sterilization
or high-level disinfection.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	   (13) Critical and semi-critical instruments shall be packaged before sterilization if they
are not to be used immediately.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (14) Proper functioning of the sterilization cycle shall be verified at least weekly through
use of a biological indicator (such as spore test).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (15) Counter tops and dental unit surfaces shall be cleaned with disposable towels
followed by an intermediate-level disinfectant between patients. Low-level disinfectant shall be
used for visibly soiled areas such as floors, walls and other housekeeping surfaces.
	    (16) Intraoral items such as impressions, bite registration, prosthetic and orthodontic
appliances shall be cleaned and disinfected with an intermediate-level disinfectant before
manipulation in the laboratory and before placement in the patient's mouth.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (17) All high-speed dental handpieces, low-speed handpiece components used
intraorally, and other dental unit attachments such as a reusable air/water syringe tips and
ultrasonic scaler tips shall be heat-sterilized between uses.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (18) Anti-retraction valves (one-way flow valves) in dental unit water lines shall be
installed and maintained.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (19) High-speed handpieces shall be activated for 30 seconds after use on each patient
to flush out air and water.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (20) Single-use disposable instruments (e.g. prophylaxis, angles, prophylaxis cups and
brushes, tips for high-speed evacuators, saliva ejectors, air/water syringe tips) shall be used for
one patient only and discarded appropriately.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (21) At the beginning of each workday, dental unit lines shall be purged with air or
flushed with water for at least two (2) minutes prior to attaching handpieces, scalers and other
devices.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (22) Contaminated solid waste shall be disposed of according to applicable local, state
and federal environmental standards.
	    (23) A written protocol shall be developed for proper instrument processing, operatory
cleanliness, and management of injuries.
</blockquote>
<p>

<b>(c) </b>A copy of this regulation shall be conspicuously posted in each dental office.<p>

<p>

<b>(d)</b> The Board shall review this regulation annually.<p>

<h2><center>MEMBER ALERT</h2>

<hr>
<p>

<b>August 14, 1996</b><p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>TO:		CDA Members<p>

<p>

FROM:	Ben Allamano, General Counsel<p>

<p>

SUBJECT:	Court Decision in Prop 65 Case<p>

</b><p>

The court challenge to California's Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of
1986 (Prop 65) brought by the Committee of Dental Amalgam Manufacturers and
Distributors has been decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  On
August 5, 1996, a three-judge panel reversed the decision issued in August 1994 by the
U.S. District Judge in San Diego, which declared Prop 65 preempted by the Medical
Device Amendments to the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act.  The case has been
remanded back to the District Court for further consideration.<p>

<p>

The news media has already reported the decision incorrectly and probably will
continue to do so.  The point that you may want to clarify for those who inquire is that
Prop 65 is only concerned with giving notice to people who are about to be exposed to
certain chemicals, including mercury and mercury compounds.  Dental amalgam is not
specifically listed by Prop 65 because it is, of course, an amalgam not a chemical.  The
decision does not alter the application of Prop 65.  The state law still does not apply to
persons who employ less than 10 employees (most dentists) and only requires the
posting of a notice.  The law does not require anything further.<p>

<p>

One headline indicated that a warning is required for dental fillings.  The story
indicated that health activists can seek statewide warnings for dental patients on the
possible dangers of amalgam fillings. Another story stated that California can issue
warnings on the dangers of mercury fillings and that health activists can seek statewide
warnings regarding their claim that mercury used in common dental fillings can cause
birth defects. That is not what Prop 65 requires.  The warning that is required would
state:<p>

<p>

	WARNING:  This office uses mercury, a chemical known to the State of
California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm. <p>

<p>

The dental amalgam committee will be meeting to discuss their options.  I will keep
you apprised of the status of this matter.<p>

<center><h2>Member Alert:  A bill that might come back to you.</h2>
</center>
<p>

Don't be caught off guard by CDA's advertising efforts which will begin promoting an updated
version of the "Dental Patient Bill of Rights".  While the bill originally premiered in February of
1988, materials promoting the revised version will roll out in mid-October.  So look for them. 
Your patients may question you regarding the rights outlined in the bill and their expectations
from you as their trusted practitioner.<p>

<p>

Changes and/or additions to the original "Dental Patient Bill of Rights" are in <b>bold</b> for your
information.  <p>

<hr>
<p>

<center><h1>Dental Patient Bill of Rights</h1>
</center>
     -  <u><b>You have the right to schedule an appointment with your dentist in a timely manner.</b></u><p>

<p>

     -  You have a right to see the dentist every time you receive dental treatment.<p>

<p>

     -  You have a right to know in advance the type and expected cost of treatment.<p>

<p>

     -  You have a right to expect dental team members to use appropriate  infection and
<b><u>sterilization controls.</u></b><p>

<p>

     -  You have a right to ask about treatment alternatives and be told, in language you can
understand, the advantages of each.<p>

<p>

     -  <u><b>You have a right to ask your dentist to explain all the treatment options regardless of
coverage or cost.</b></u><p>

<p>

     -  You have a right to know the education and training of your dentist and  the dental team.<p>

<p>

     -  You have a right to know the professional rules, laws and ethics that apply to your dentist
and the dental team.<p>

<p>

     -  You have a right to choose your own dentist.<p>

<p>

     -  That's it for now.  Give me a buzz if you think of something else with which I might be able
to help you.<p>

<title>INFECTION CONTROL REGULATIONS</title>
<meta name="CreatedBy" content="WP Internet Publisher 6.1">
</head>
<body>
<h2><center>BOARD OF DENTAL EXAMINERS</h2>
<h1>INFECTION CONTROL REGULATIONS</h1>
<hr>
<p>

</center>
<b>These amended regulations will be enforced as of August 7, 1996.</b> They replace the three sets of Centers
for Disease Control recommendations which the Board adopted as regulations in 1994.<p>

<p>

<u>1005. Minimum Standards for Infection Control</u><p>

<b>(a)</b> As used in this section:<p>

<blockquote>	    (1) "Universal precautions" is an approach to infection control according to which all
human blood and certain human body fluids are treated as if known to be infectious for HIV,
HBV and other blood-borne pathogens.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (2) "Critical instruments" are surgical and other instruments used to penetrate soft tissue
or bone.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (3) "Semi-critical instruments" are surgical and other instruments that are not used to
penetrate soft tissue or bone, but contact oral tissue.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (4) "Non-critical instruments and devices" are instruments and devices that contact
intact skin.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (5) "Surgical procedures" are entries into normally sterile areas of the body.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (6) "Low-level disinfection" is the least effective disinfection process.  It does not kill
bacterial spores or mycobacterium tuberculosis var bovis, a laboratory test organism used to
classify the strength of disinfectant chemicals.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (7) "Intermediate-level disinfection" kills mycobacterium tuberculosis var bovis that
indicates less resistant organisms such as hepatitis B and HIV are also killed.
	    (8) "High-level disinfection" kills some, but not necessarily all bacterial spores. This
process kills mycobacterium tuberculosis var bovis, and other bacteria, fungi and viruses.
</blockquote>
<p>

<b>(b)</b> Licensees with one or more employees shall comply with infection control precautions mandated by the
California Occupational Safety and Health Administration.  All licensees shall comply with the following
minimum precautions to minimize the transmission of pathogens in health care settings:<p>

<blockquote>	    (1) Universal precautions shall be practiced in the care of all patients.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (2) Medical exam gloves shall be worn whenever there is a potential for contact with
blood, blood-contaminated saliva, or mucous membranes.  Sterile gloves shall be worn in
connection with surgical procedures involving soft tissue or bone. Sterile coolants/irrigants shall
be used for surgical procedures involving soft tissue or bone. Sterile coolant/irrigants are
deemed to be sterile when delivered using a device or process that has a Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) marketing clearance for delivery of sterile/coolant irrigants to the patient. 
Delivery of sterile/coolant irrigants shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's directions.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (3) Health care workers shall wash hands and put on new gloves before treating each
patient. Antimicrobial soap shall be used to wash hands for surgical procedures. Health care
workers shall wash hands after removing and discarding gloves after treatment of each patient
or before leaving the operatory. Gloves shall not be washed before or after use.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (4) Health care workers shall wear surgical face masks and either chin length plastic face
shields or surgical masks and protective eye-wear when treating patients. After each patient,
and during patient treatment if applicable, masks shall be changed if moist or contaminated.
After each patient, face shields and protective eyewear shall be cleaned and disinfected, if
contaminated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (5) Health care workers shall wear reusable or disposable gowns when their clothing is
likely to be soiled with blood or other bodily fluids.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (6) Protective attire must be removed when leaving the laboratories and work areas.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (7) Items or surfaces such as, but not limited to, light handles which are impossible to
clean and disinfect, shall be protected with impervious barriers. Between patients, the covering
must be removed, discarded and replaced with clean covering.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (8) Splash shields shall be used in dental laboratories.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>	    (9) Health care workers who have exudative lesions or weeping dermatitis shall refrain
from all direct patient care and from handling patient care equipment until the condition

<b>TO:		CDA Members<p>

<p>

FROM:	Ben Allamano, General Counsel<p>

<p>

SUBJECT:	Court Decision in Prop 65 Case<p>

</b><p>

The court challenge to California's Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of
1986 (Prop 65) brought by the Committee of Dental Amalgam Manufacturers and
Distributors has been decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  On
August 5, 1996, a three-judge panel reversed the decision issued in August 1994 by the
U.S. District Judge in San Diego, which declared Prop 65 preempted by the Medical
Device Amendments to the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act.  The case has been
remanded back to the District Court for further consideration.<p>

<p>

The news media has already reported the decision incorrectly and probably will
continue to do so.  The point that you may want to clarify for those who inquire is that
Prop 65 is only concerned with giving notice to people who are about to be exposed to
certain chemicals, including mercury and mercury compounds.  Dental amalgam is not
specifically listed by Prop 65 because it is, of course, an amalgam not a chemical.  The
decision does not alter the application of Prop 65.  The state law still does not apply to
persons who employ less than 10 employees (most dentists) and only requires the
posting of a notice.  The law does not require anything further.<p>

<p>

One headline indicated that a warning is required for dental fillings.  The story
indicated that health activists can seek statewide warnings for dental patients on the
possible dangers of amalgam fillings. Another story stated that California can issue
warnings on the dangers of mercury fillings and that health activists can seek statewide
warnings regarding their claim that mercury used in common dental fillings can cause
birth defects. That is not what Prop 65 requires.  The warning that is required would
state:<p>

<p>

	WARNING:  This office uses mercury, a chemical known to the State of
California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm. <p>

<p>

The dental amalgam committee will be meeting to discuss their options.  I will keep
you apprised of the status of this matter.<p>

<h2>More Than Just Your Ego Is At Stake.</h2>
<br>
It's amazing what some people will go through at the first hint of a receding hairline.  Sheer<br>
vanity will compel them to try miracle-working hair tonics, purchase spray-on hair through<br>
the mail or even undergo expensive hair transplants.  But ask them what they've done about<br>
their receding gums, and often their reply is little more than an apathetic shrug.<br>
<br>
At first, receding gums may not sound like such a disastrous affliction, but when one considers<br>
the possible causes and consequences of the condition, it suddenly becomes much more than a<br>
vanity issue.<br>
<p>

In many cases, receding gums are caused by periodontal disease   also known as gum<br>
disease.  Three out of four adults have some form of it.  And, in most cases, it doesn't cause<br>
any pain and therefore goes unnoticed. <br>
<br>
Most common in adults, gum disease starts when plaque, containing bacteria, builds up on the<br>
teeth and gums.  When the plaque is not removed daily, it produces toxins that irritate the<br>
gums.  Eventually these toxins destroy the gum tissues, causing them to separate from the<br>
tooth (recede) and form spaces called pockets.  The pockets hold more bacteria, which only<br>
compounds the problem.<br>
<br>
In the early stages (gingivitis), marked by red or swollen gums that bleed easily, gum disease<br>
is reversible and can be detected by your dentist during regular check-ups. As the disease<br>
progresses (periodontitis), it can destroy the bone and soft tissues that support the teeth.  Teeth<br>
can become loose, fall out or have to be removed by a dentist.  In fact, periodontitis is the<br>
culprit in 70 percent of tooth loss in adults over 40.<br>
<br>
The good news is that gum disease is easily prevented through brushing and flossing daily,<br>
eating a balanced diet and visiting the dentist regularly for professional cleanings.  Following<br>
this simple regimen, adults can look forward to keeping their natural teeth throughout their<br>
life. If only maintaining a full head of hair were this easy.<br>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>The Roots Of Dentistry</h2>
The science and art of dentistry have changed dramatically since the Middle Ages, when<br>
barber-surgeons replaced physicians as primary caretakers of oral health.  Happily, 800 years<br>
of dental practice, research and scientific advancements have provided us with dental<br>
treatments that are substantially more effective than the old standbys of bloodletting or<br>
smearing garlic on the thumbnail to relieve a toothache.<br>
<br>
Dentistry actually goes back much further than the Middle Ages.  The first known dentist was<br>
Hesi-Re, an Egyptian who lived during the reign of Zoser, the pharaoh who ordered the<br>
building of the great Step Pyramid at Saqarra (2600 B.C).  From the skulls of early Egyptians,<br>
it is apparent that dentists like Hesi-Re primarily removed problem teeth or drilled holes in the<br>
jaw bones as a means of releasing pressure caused by abscessed teeth.<br>
<br>
There is also evidence of dental work performed by the Mayan Indians of Mexico, whose<br>
culture reached its peak from about A.D. 300 to A.D. 900.  Mayan skulls have been found<br>
with teeth inlaid with exquisitely carved minerals such as jadeite, turquoise, quartz and<br>
serpentine.  It is believed that Mayan dental work was done primarily for cosmetic or<br>
ritualistic purposes.<br>
<br>
Some of the greatest advances in modern dentistry were made as recently as the 19th century. <br>
In 1832, amalgam, a substance for filling cavities, was introduced in the United States.  Later<br>
that decade, the dental drill was patented.  However, it wasn't until 1840 that the first dental<br>
college opened its doors in Baltimore.  And up until 1841, when the first dental practice law<br>
was enacted in Alabama, anyone could hang a dentist sign above their door and start pulling<br>
teeth.  Among those who did were barbers and fish sellers.<br>
<br>
One of the most important discoveries to the medical profession as a whole was made by a<br>
dentist named William Morton, when he discovered the anesthetic properties of ether in 1846. <br>
1854 marked the introduction of all-porcelain dentures.  The first patients to rinse and spit into<br>
a self-cleaning spittoon, did so in 1867.  They did it from the first hydraulic chair in 1877.<br>
<br>
One of modern dentistry's most innovative practitioners was Dr. C. Edmund Kells. Among his<br>
many inventions was the suction pump, clearing the way, as it were, for drier operating fields,<br>
not only in dentistry, but every kind of surgery.  He built the  first X-ray machine in America,<br>
and in 1896 was the first to demonstrate the use of X-rays in dentistry.<br>
<br>
It wasn't until the 20th century that innovations such as dental hygiene, fluoride and<br>
orthodontic surgery were introduced to the practice of dentistry.  But they wouldn't have been<br>
possible without the centuries of dedicated pioneering by dentists like Hesi-Re, William<br>
Morton and Edmund Kells and their associates.  Thanks to these forward-looking men and<br>
women, our visits to the dentist have become easier, more comfortable and more effective. <br>
And perhaps most importantly, completely devoid of bloodletting.<br>

<h2>Life, Liberty And The Pursuit of Quality Dental Care.</h2>
<br>
Have you ever questioned the quality of dental care you've received? Or left the chair thinking<br>
that maybe your dentist is the one who needs to be examined? According to the California<br>
Dental Association President, Dr. Michael Miller, if you are unhappy with the quality of the<br>
dental treatment you receive, or you think you may have received treatment that was<br>
inappropriate, you have someplace to turn.<br>
<br>
If your dentist is a member of the California Dental Association (CDA), you can ask to have<br>
your dispute resolved through "peer review." Peer review was developed by the CDA to<br>
resolve disputes between patients and CDA dentists. The process includes examination of the<br>
patient and review of the treatment plan by a committee of dentists to determine if the care<br>
given was appropriate and meets community standards.<br>
<br>
"Peer review will resolve the problem quickly, and at no cost to the patient," says Miller,<br>
"And if the dentist is found to be at fault, which happens about 50% of the time, the CDA will<br>
order your dentist to reimburse you or provide retreatment at no additional cost."<br>
<br>
If you are having problems and your dentist is not a member of the CDA, you should contact<br>
the Board of Dental Examiners, the primary licensing and disciplinary authority for dentists.<br>

<h2>Ask Molar Man</h2>
<br>
Dear Molar Man,<br>
     What's this I hear about dental sealants? What do they do? How can they help me?<br>
Where do I get 'em? Do they hurt? Do they come in different flavors? Like mango, for<br>
instance? Or maybe chicken-flavored? How about licorice? Or beet?<br>
                                Orally Fixated in Ojai<br>
<br>
Dear Orally,<br>
     As always, I'm pleased to hear from others who take their own dental hygiene as<br>
seriously as I. Just imagine how much brighter each day would be if it were filled with the<br>
healthy, sparkling smiles of people like yourself.<br>
     As I'm sure you already know, Orally, daily brushing and flossing are your most<br>
powerful weapons in your noble quest to keep plaque, the most evil and primary cause of<br>
cavities, at bay. With the advent of sealants, you now have a third weapon in your dental<br>
arsenal. A sealant is a coat of plastic material that your dentist can apply to the top, or biting<br>
surfaces, of your teeth. The slippery surface of the sealant makes it harder for pesky old Mr.<br>
Plaque to stick to the tiny nooks, crannies and grooves of your teeth, thereby reducing the risk<br>
of cavities and tooth decay.<br>
     Both young children, with newly formed permanent teeth, and big strong grown-ups<br>
like you, Orally, can benefit from having a sealant applied to their teeth. Your dentist can<br>
easily apply it, using a special instrument. It's most often a painless treatment, and each<br>
application serves as an effective preventive measure against cavities and tooth decay for<br>
years.<br>
     Sadly, at this point in time, we have yet to explore specific flavors. However, if and<br>
when we do, you can be sure I'll put your thoughtful requests right at the top of the list, along<br>
with my personal favorite, spinach.<br>
<br>
                              Yours Hygienically, <br>
                              Molar Man<br>
<p>

<br>
<h2>Are Your Gums Too Sensitive?   </h2>
<br>
To find out if you may indeed be among the 75% of adults that have some form of gum<br>
disease, take this quick quiz:<br>
<br>
1.   Do your gums bleed during tooth brushing or flossing?<br>
2.   Are your gums red, swollen or tender?<br>
3.   Have your gums started to pull away from your teeth?<br>
4.   Do you have persistent bad breath?<br>
5.   Is there ever pus between your teeth and gums?<br>
6.   Are any of your adult teeth loose?<br>
7.   Is the way your teeth fit together when you bite changing?<br>
8.   Do your partial dentures fit differently than they used to?<br>
<br>
If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, you may have some form of gum disease and<br>
should contact your dentist.<br>
<hr>
<p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>Adult Orthodontics: How To Grin And Bear It.</h2>
<br>
     "Excuse Me, I Need What?"<br>
<br>
So, you made it through adolescence relatively unscathed.  Your parents respectfully stayed<br>
away from home football games. You actually had a date for the prom, even if it was just a<br>
platonic one.  And most of your zits stayed hidden neatly behind your bangs.  Then, just when<br>
you thought it was safe to start feeling smug about it all, your dentist slays you with three of<br>
the most dreaded words known to aesthetically conscious people everywhere:<br>
"You need braces."<br>
<br>
Surely there must be some mistake.  After all you're an adult.  Perhaps what your dentist<br>
meant to say was, "Your kids need braces."  Yes, that's it!  The braces are for your kids. <br>
Phew.  That dentist!<br>
<br>
Really had you going for a second there.<br>
<br>
It takes a while, but eventually your dentist makes it clear that it is indeed you who needs the<br>
braces.  But fear not.  You aren't alone.<br>
<br>
The fact is, that as Americans are putting greater emphasis on health, fitness and<br>
self-improvement, more and more adults are seeking orthodontic treatment.  And recent<br>
advances, such as less visible and more effective brackets and wires, now make orthodontic<br>
treatment more palatable for many adults.  Of the 1.3 million people who begin treatment each<br>
year, 25 percent are over 18 years old. And most feel that the benefit of improved self-image<br>
is well worth the time and investment.<br>
<br>
But even more important than giving you a winning smile, orthodontic treatment may benefit<br>
your dental and general health.  If teeth are poorly aligned, removing plaque and tartar by<br>
brushing and flossing alone may be difficult.  A poor bite may result in fractured or<br>
excessively worn tooth surfaces.  And the extra stress caused by a poor bite can even result in<br>
pain or problems with the jaw joints.<br>
<br>
While most dentists treat some orthodontic problems, if yours thinks you should see a<br>
specialist, he or she will refer you to an orthodontist.  The cost and length of your treatment<br>
will depend on several factors:  the severity of the problem for which it is prescribed;  the<br>
health of your teeth, gums and supporting bones;  your age; and how closely you follow your<br>
dentist's or your orthodontist's instructions.<br>
<br>
Yes, donning braces at the age of 30, or 40, or even 60, can be a somewhat humbling<br>
experience.  However, it might help to remember the many words of wisdom parents have<br>
shared with their metal-mouthed kids over the years like, "It builds character."  And, "You'll<br>
be the one who's laughing two years from now.  With perfectly straight teeth, I might add." <br>
And, "Could you go stand by the TV?  We get better reception that way."  Okay, so maybe<br>
you shouldn't remember all of them.<br>
<hr>
<p>

<p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>Fail This Test and There Will be a Drill</h2>
<br>
1.   Does your dental plan let employees choose any dentist they want?<br>
<br>
2.   Do you need pre-approval before treatment begins?<br>
<br>
3.   Does the insurance company insist on second-guessing your treatment decisions?<br>
<br>
4.   Are deeply discounted dental fees required by the insurer?<br>
<br>
5.   Does it seem like you need to be a rocket scientist to figure out the plan?<br>
<br>
6.   Is the plan bigger on small print that on benefits?<br>
<br>
7.   Does it feel like the premiums pay for a lot of unnecessary bureaucratic overhead?<br>
<br>
8.   Does the fine print put excessive limits on your treatment options?<br>
<br>
Irked by the answers to most of these questions?  We thought so. Consider, then an idea that is<br>
gaining lots of ground today: <i><b>direct reimbursement</b></i> of dental expenses.  Some insurance<br>
premiums are so high and service is so limited, many employers would rather keep the funds<br>
and directly reimburse employees instead.  The <i><b>direct reimbursement</b></i> concept can improve<br>
care: the right treatments, less waste, happy employees.  Hey, just what the doctor ordered. <br>
For more details, call us.  Perhaps the most painless call you'll ever make.<br>

<I>	The ongoing national debate on health care 
and the growing tension between opponents 
and proponents of managed care, even among 
the ranks at CDA, have given cause for alarm 
to consumers and stakeholders alike.  One 
need not possess the intelligence of a rocket 
scientist to conclude that changes brewing on 
the horizon will significantly affect the 
delivery of dental care as we know it 
today.</I><P>

<I>	In dental offices and component forums 
throughout the state, as well as at the nation's 
capitol, the debate is weathering increasing 
scrutiny.  In March, House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich called for an unprecedented 
congressional investigation of the managed 
care industry, the fastest growing and 
perhaps most controversial sector of the 
nation's health care system.</I><P>

<I>	Unfortunately, the problems that plague the 
medical care delivery system in the U.S. have 
spilled into the dental care arena.  What many 
fail to realize is that medicine and dentistry   
differ.   When  some  proposed managed care solutions for medicine 
are applied to dentistry, the results can be 
potentially disastrous.</I><P>

<I>	Your task is to inform and educate your 
patients and all who will lend you their ear 
on the issues of quality dental care.  Also, 
prepare to provide brief explanations of man-
aged medical and dental care.</I><P>

<H3>THE FACTS</H3>

	Discussing managed care is an intricate issue that requires 
comprehensive, in-depth coverage.  It is not a topic that lends 
itself to a quick, 30-second television spot or an 8- to 10-second 
soundbite.<P>

	On March 28, House Speaker Newt Gingrich unexpectedly 
called for congressional hearings on the current health care 
delivery system that covers nearly 63 percent of all privately 
insured Americans.  Understandably so, this proposal drew mixed 
reactions:  favored by doctors who increasingly are hard pressed 
by the control of managed care networks; and stunned by the 
dominant force behind the operation of managed care in the 
health insurance industry.<P>

	After his formal remarks at the American Medical 
Association's annual national leadership conference, Gingrich 
said, "We need hearings on
managed care because anytime you have an accumulation of 
power comparable to [that in] some of the communities in which 
managed care is now [and] has a very large penetration, you need 
to have some kind of government review of what are the 
procedures, what are the systems, what are the terms of 
employment, what are some of the conditions of secrecy, 
etcetera."<P>

	A towering criticism of the managed care industry is its 
reliance on "gate-keeper" physicians, a practice that limits 
consumers' choice of medical providers.  Anchored on reducing 
the role of the federal government, the GOP-controlled Congress 
is certain to engage in riveting deliberation with a public 
investigation of the industry and their practices.<P>

	Some contend that managed care is here to stay; that the 
issue has progressed far beyond whether or not it will affect 
dentistry.  They stress that the profession now must deal and 
work with managed care.  Others contend that every effort must 
be made to preserve fee-for-service dental care for the good of the 
public and dentistry.<P>

	The term "managed care" originated to describe the concept 
of streamlining and cost-cutting wastes in the health care delivery 
system.  Dentistry's historical record reflects strong cost-
containment measures that neither sacrifice patients' access to 
quality care nor unduly restrict dentists options for  providing  
appropriate  treatment.  In this sense, dentistry has been reflecting 
what managed care hopes to achieve with the medical health care 
delivery system.<P>

	Proponents are quick to stress the significance of the role 
they play in reducing the federal budget deficit by delivering a 
product that offers significant cost-cutting value not only in the 
private sector, but also in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  
Opponents criticize the industry for nurturing a system that draws 
strength from a corps of penny-pinching administrators who are 
more concerned with bottom line figures than with the quality of 
individual patient care.<P>

	In January, CDA unveiled an educational campaign to 
further educate Californians on the issues surrounding managed 
care; a full-scale effort to educate and empower dental consumers 
and member dentists.  The three-tiered effort made use of 
statewide forums,  conducted to educate dentists; radio and print 
advertising, to reach patients and consumers; and a comprehen-
sive managed care brochure, made available to consumers and 
dentists interested in more in-depth information.<P>

	Consumers interested in learning more about managed care 
and dental insurance should be referred to the brochure <I>What 
Everyone Should Know About Selecting and Using Dental 
Benefits</I>.  This brochure will be mailed free of charge to con-
sumers who contact CDA.<P>

<H3>GLOSSARY OF TERMS</H3>

<I>	Become familiar with the following brief 
glossary of commonly used terms relating to 
managed care and share it with members of 
the media and/or consumers when discussing 
this issue.</I><P>


	<B>Capitation</B>  A method of reimbursement and 
financing that pays a flat monthly fee per patient to the dentist.  
Dental HMOs operate under a capitated system.<P>

	<B>Closed Panel</B>  A closed panel dental plan 
provides benefits for treatment only if that treatment is provided 
by a dentist who has agreed to provide treatment to eligible 
beneficiaries under terms dictated by the plan.  Among other 
terms of the agreement, the dentist generally agrees to provide 
treatment at reduced fees.  Only a limited number of dentists in 
an area are allowed to participate in a typical closed panel. Dental 
HMOs, other capitation plans and some PPOs operate with closed 
panels.<P>

	<B>Denti-Cal</B>  This program provides dental care for 
the indigent in California.<P>

	<B>Direct Reimbursement</B>  A self-funding strategy 
that allows employers to pay dental benefits to employees by 
reimbursing them directly, thus eliminating insurance company 
involvement.  Direct reimbursement allows patients to see a 
dentist of their choice and to play an active role in the 
management of the benefits. <P>

	<B>Fee-for-Service</B>  An arrangement under which 
physicians, dentists, hospitals or other health care providers are 
paid for each service rendered, whether by a private insurer, the 
government or the patient.<P>

	<B>Freedom of Choice</B> - A provision in a dental 
benefits plan that allows patients to select any licensed dentist to  
provide  dental  care  and receive full plan benefits.  Freedom of 
choice also makes provision for any licensed dentist to participate 
in the dental benefits plan.<P>

	<B>HMO</B> - Health Maintenance Organizations 
provide prepaid health care plans under which participating 
consumers pay a set annual fee.  Patients then receive services 
through a group of affiliated physicians, dentists and/or hospitals, 
often with no additional copayments or fees.  HMOs operate 
under a capitated system.<P>

	<B>Managed Care</B>  A method of delivering, 
supervising and coordinating health care, often through HMOs 
and other networks of physicians, dentists and hospitals.  In 
theory, this method eliminates inappropriate services and controls 
costs.<P>

	<B>Medi-Cal</B>  This program provides health care for 
the indigent in California.  Denti-Cal is a part of the Medi-Cal 
program.<P>

	<B>PPO </B> Preferred Provider Organizations make 
arrangements under which a dental benefits company negotiates 
discounted fees with health care provider networks in return for 
guaranteeing a certain volume of patients.  Enrollees in PPOs can 
elect to receive treatment outside the network but pay higher 
copayments or deductibles for doing so.<P>

<H3>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</H3>

<B>Q</B>	What differences between medical and dental 
diseases substantiate that managed care may not be appropriate 
for dentistry?<P>

<B>A</B>	Medical disease can be unpredictable and 
catastrophic.  Most dental ailments are preventable.  The key to 
maintaining your oral health is to obtain preventive care, 
including regular checkups and cleanings.  Regular visits to the 
dentist help to diagnose and treat most problems in the early 
stages without extensive testing or elaborate and expensive 
procedures; this keeps dental care costs much lower than those of 
medical care.  In fact, total spending for dental care is decreasing.  
In 1970, it made up 6.3 percent of total health care expenditures.  
In 1991, dental care's share of health care spending was only 4.9 
percent.<P>

<B>Q</B>	What are the differences between medical and 
dental insurance?<P>
	<P>
<B>A</B>	Medical insurance is designed primarily to cover 
the costs of diagnosing, treating and curing serious illnesses.  
This process may involve a primary care physician, multiple 
specialists, a variety of tests performed by doctors and labora-
tories, an array of procedures and an assortment of medications.  
Other factors responsible for the fluctuation in costs are the 
health, age and attitudes of people in the medical coverage 
group.<P>

Dentistry is health care that works.  Most dental coverage is 
designed to ensure that patients receive regular preventive care.  
High quality dental care rarely requires the complex, multiple 
resources often required by medical care.  A thorough 
examination by the dentist and a set of x-rays are all it usually 
takes to diagnose a problem.  By and large, dental care is 
provided by a general practitioner, although some cases may 
require the services of a dental specialist.  Because most dental 
disease is preventable, dental benefit plans are structured to en-
courage patients to get the regular, routine care so vital to pre-
venting and diagnosing the onset of serious disease.<P>

As a matter of fact, most dental plans require patients to assume a 
greater portion of the costs for treatment of dental disease than for 
preventive procedures.  By placing an emphasis on prevention, 
and by covering regular teeth cleanings and check-ups, 
Americans saved nearly $100 billion in dental care costs during 
the 1980s.<P>

<B>Q</B>	What percentage of the U.S. population is 
covered by dental insurance?<P>

<B>A</B>	The availability of dental insurance is the single 
greatest factor that helps consumers get the dental care they need.  
Research by the Alexander Consulting Group, Hewett &amp 
Associates, and the Rand Corporation indicates that more than 48 
percent of all Americans  113 million of us  are covered by 
privately financed dental insurance plans.  This compares with 
just 12 million people who had such coverage in 1970.  As a 
direct result of increased access to regular oral care and the 
widespread use of preventive measures, the incidence of dental 
decay has dropped sharply.<P>

<B>Q</B>	With so many choices in the marketplace, what 
should I bear in mind when looking for an appropriate insurance 
carrier or dental plan?<P>

<B>A</B>	Consumers can benefit from the wide assortment 
of available dental benefit plans that can accommodate a variety 
of needs and expectations.  Before signing up with an insurance 
carrier or for a dental plan, determine the following:  the type of 
third party responsible for funding and administration of the plan; 
the alternatives offered for selecting a dentist; the structure used 
to compensate the dentist for services provided; and the method 
by which benefits and payments are calculated.  Understanding 
the implications of each of these factors is essential to making an 
informed decision when selecting a plan and using the 
benefits.<P>

<B>Q</B>	Who are the main players in a typical dental 
plan?<P>

<B>A</B>	Most dental benefits plan involve three principal 
parties:  you, the patient; the dentist providing care; and a third 
party with whom you or your employer contracts for coverage.  If 
your plan is funded by your employer, you may have an 
administrator responsible for processing and payment of claims.  
The primary responsibility of the third party is to provide the 
financial foundation for your dental benefits plan.

<h2>Is the Nightly Grind Wearing You Down?</h2>
<p>

You walk into an empty room. It's a classroom. You take your seat at your desk. Only it's one of
those kindergarten desks, and the chair is so short that when you sit down, your knees smash into
your chin, knocking you unconscious. When you come to, you're on the floor in your office and
all your co-workers are hovering above you, laughing. You assume it's because you're lying on
the floor with a swollen jaw. Then you realize you're wearing a giant, pink bunny outfit, complete
with long, floppy ears. Which is especially embarrassing considering you're a grown man. Who
also happens to be the boss.<p>

<p>

Then you wake up. It was just a dream. Only, why is your jaw still aching? <p>

<p>

One word: bruxism. Also known as teeth grinding. A lot of people suffer from this disorder
unknowingly, as it usually occurs during sleep. And unless the constant racket of your grinding is
keeping someone else up, you may not think your sore jaw, restless sleep and general fatigue are
symptoms of bruxism. Left untreated, it could lead to painful or loose teeth, or teeth that are
literally ground down, leaving worn surfaces or fractured enamel. While dentists can usually
detect the telltale signs of wear on your teeth, if you suspect you might have a grinding problem,
be sure to mention it at your next visit. Then you and your dentist can determine the cause and
appropriate treatment of your problem.<p>

<p>

A major cause of bruxism is stress. Since it's probably not feasible to eliminate all sources of
stress from your life, the best thing to do is learn to manage it better. Cut down on caffeine.
Consider taking warm baths before bed. To help relax clenching muscles, apply a warm washcloth
to the sides of your face. Try talking yourself out of the habit by placing little reminders around
the house or repeating phrases that help you relax. And for Pete's sake, try to lighten up a little. If
this doesn't do the trick, your dentist may recommend counseling, prescribe muscle relaxants for
your jaw, or suggest physical therapy to alleviate muscle pain. <p>

<p>

If an abnormal bite or crooked or missing teeth are causing you to grind, your dentist may treat
your bruxism by removing the high spots on the problem teeth. In more serious cases, he or she
will reshape or reconstruct the biting surfaces of the problem teeth with crowns or inlays. Another
treatment involves wearing a plastic mouth guard at night to help prevent grinding. The
custom-made guard keeps the upper and lower teeth from coming together, making it impossible
for you to grind them. <p>

<p>

If you want to get your grinding under control, talk to your dentist. With the proper treatment, he
or she can help alleviate the pain in your jaw, improve your sleep, and return your energy level to
normal. If you want to make sense of that wacky dream, talk to a Jungian therapist. With the
proper analysis, he or she can help address your apparent fear of... bunnies.<p>

<h2>The Roots of Dentistry</h2>
<p>

During the Great Depression, some dentists, like this one in rural Georgia, had to restructure their
fee schedules somewhat to keep their patients healthy and their doors open. It was a compromise
that seemed to work well for everyone. Except maybe for the chickens, hogs and cows.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<h2></h2>
<h2>Dental Team Comes Through in the Clench.</h2>
<p>

Year in and year out you've counted on your dental team to go to the line for your oral health.
But the success of your dental team relies on the contributions of every player, including you.
When you all work together, you're guaranteed to walk away with (you knew we had to say it
sooner or later) a winning smile.<p>

<p>

<b>	The Players</b><p>

<p>

	<b>	The Dental Hygienist</b><p>

		Quite often the heart and soul of the dental team, the dental hygienist is responsible for cleaning
teeth as well as performing other functions under the direction and supervision of the dentist, such
as applying sealants, teaching oral hygiene techniques, and delivering the occasional pep talk.<p>

<p>

	<b>	The Receptionist</b><p>

		As their title suggests, receptionists are known for their receiving skills. An ambassador of sorts,
the receptionist greets patients, makes appointments, takes insurance information, and serves as
an information source.<p>

<p>

	<b>	The Dentist</b><p>

		As the captain of the dental team, the dentist is responsible and accountable for everything that
goes on in the office. Only the licensed dentist is educated and trained to diagnose dental
problems, plan treatment, prescribe medication, and pretty much call all the shots.<p>

<p>

		The Dental Assistant<p>

		Taking X-rays and helping the dentist at chairside are some of the countless assists performed
daily by this team member. Others include the no-look-behind-the-back floss pass and the soft
bristle alley-oop.<p>

<p>

		The Patient<p>

		Perhaps the most dedicated player on the team, the patient never takes a day off. Executing the
highly effective brush-n-floss play daily and scheduling semi-annual check-ups are the basics of
every patient's game plan.<p>

<h2>Your Dental Insurance -- Has It Really Got You
Covered?</h2>
<p>

To find out if you're getting the most from your dental coverage, answer the questions on this
short checklist.<p>

<p>

1.	Do you know your dental plan options and have you compared notes with friends, family,
co-workers and your benefits manager?<p>

<p>

2.	Does your dental plan provide benefits for a wide range of preventive procedures and dental
services?<p>

<p>

3.	Does your coverage allow you and your dentist to develop the treatment plan best suited to your
personal needs?<p>

<p>

4.	Does your dental plan allow you to choose your own dentist? (Or are you restricted to a list
selected by the plan?)<p>

<p>

5.	Does your dental plan provide a clear and complete description of the benefit programs and
options available?<p>

<p>

6.	Do you know what types of diagnostic and corrective treatment the dental plan considers routine?<p>

<p>

7.	Can you see your family dentist when you need to and schedule appointment times that are
convenient to you?<p>

<p>

8.	Does your dental plan allow referrals to specialists?<p>

<p>

9.	Do you know the differences between indemnity coverage and managed care programs, such as
HMOs, preferred provider organizations and capitation plans?<p>

<p>

10.	Have you documented and communicated to your employer, union or broker your good and bad
experiences with the plan?<p>

<p>

If you answered "yes" to most of these questions, you're probably getting the most from your
dental coverage. Too many "no" answers means changes are needed. Talk to your benefits
manager about what you can do to make the changes happen.<p>

<h2>The Point Guard On The Mouth Guard</h2>
<p>

BJ Armstrong, 6'2" point guard for the Golden State Warriors, spent the first half of the 1990s in
the backcourt for the Chicago Bulls. He was a starter in the 1994 NBA All-Star Game, is one of
the league's best three-point shooters, and sports three -- count 'em -- three NBA
Championship rings. Suffice it to say, the man knows a thing or two about basketball.<p>

<p>

Unfortunately for BJ, he also knows a thing or two about sports-related mouth injuries. Which
explains why, when BJ steps onto the basketball court, BJ's wearing a mouth guard. Or chewing
on one. Or dangling one From his mouth. Recently, ENAMEL had an opportunity to sit with BJ
and ask him about his mouth guard, his reasons for wearing it, and his penchant for fiddling with
it.<p>

<p>

<b>	Enamel talks to BJ Armstrong</b><br>
<br>
<b>	Enamel:</b>  I can't remember ever seeing you play without a mouth guard in your mouth. When did
you start wearing them?<br>
<br>
<b>	BJ Armstrong:</b>  I started wearing mouth guards when I got to college.<br>
	<br>
<b>	E:</b>  Were they required by your school?<br>
<br>
<b>	BJ:  </b>No, I got hit in the chin and I chipped a couple of my back teeth. We were in the NCAA
tournament and I had to keep playing, so I had to wear a mouth piece to protect my back teeth.
Then I just kinda got used to wearing it. It just became part of me, like some players wear wrist
bands and some players wear knee braces. You just start wearing it and it becomes part of your
uniform.<br>
<br>
<b>	E:</b>  So if you were to leave yours home and you didn't have it on for a game, would you feel like
something was terribly wrong?<br>
<br>
<b>	BJ:  </b>Yeah, I don't think I could play without it now. It's just such a habit. <br>
<br>
<b>	E:</b>  Even if you're just out back with friends?<br>
	<br>
<b>	BJ:  </b>Yeah, even in the summer. It's just like chewing gum. And I chew on them all the time. So I
go through 20 or 30 during a year, 'cause I chew them up.<br>
<br>
<b>	E:</b>  They look uncomfortable. Are they?<br>
	<br>
<b>	BJ:</b>  I guess it depends. I have a dentist that I've known since 1985, and the ones he makes for
me are very comfortable. It's like they're not even in. But people are always asking me why I play
with mine all the time. It's just a habit.<br>
<br>
<b>	E:  </b>Can you talk with it in? <br>
<br>
<b>	BJ:</b>  Yeah. I can talk with mine.<br>
<br>
<b>	E:</b>  Can you trash talk with it in?<br>
<br>
<b>	BJ:</b>  Trash talk. You know, there are maybe one or two guys who may say something during the
course of the game, and now they're trash talkers. That kills me. They may say something once
during the course of the year, then they get all this publicity. No one's really a trash talker. I mean
you can't. You don't have the energy to talk, play, find out what's going on...<br>
<br>
<b>	E:</b>  I see them on TV. It's not that hard to read lips.<br>
<br>
<b>	BJ:</b>  Yeah, they're probably talking about what they did last night. They're not trash talking.<br>
<br>
<b>	E:</b>  I understand you've had some other unfortunate things happen to your teeth.<br>
<br>
<b>	BJ:</b>  I got my front tooth knocked out during a game - and I had my mouth guard in. It was just
bad luck. I'm actually still waiting for that injury to heal so I can get my permanent replacement. <br>
<br>
<b>	E:</b>  So this happened just recently?<br>
<br>
	<b>BJ:</b>  No, it was the end of, not last year, but the year before. But I need two years to let it heal. <br>
<br>
<b>	E:</b>  Is it still painful?<br>
<p>

<b>	BJ:</b>  No, it doesn't hurt or anything. It's just the process of them having to put a screw into that
bone up there (pointing to the roof of his mouth). Then you have to let that heal and make sure it
takes. Then they have to reopen it. It's like, a major process. Next summer I'll have it done. But
that's part of playing the game. The doctor kept saying that if I didn't have my mouth guard in, I
probably would have lost all of them.<br>
<br>
	<b>E:  </b>I'm surprised more teeth don't end up on the court. It looks like you guys are always getting
elbows and fists and shoulders in your faces, especially under the net. <br>
<br>
<b>	BJ:</b>  Well, it looks like that. It's just that we're always so close to one another. Most of the time
we push one another, but we really don't get hit in the face that much. But when it does happen,
usually it's pretty bad.<br>
<br>
<b>	E:</b>  Why do you suppose more NBA players don't wear mouth guards?<br>
<br>
<b>	BJ:</b>  Everyone's different. Some players like to chew gum. Some players like to wear mouth
guards. It just depends on whatever you're comfortable with. I think until something happens to
your teeth, you don't think about it. <br>
<br>
<b>	E:</b>  Do you think more kids will start wearing mouth guards if they see more of their favorite
athletes wearing them?<br>
<br>
<b>	BJ:</b>  I think it's like anything else. If one high-profile player, let's say Michael Jordan, wears a
wrist band, it becomes fashionable. Then you see all the players wearing wrist bands. If he wears a
knee brace, then everyone starts wearing them. I mean, everyone's left knee can't be hurting at
the same time. So if the kids see it, then they want to do it. Maybe next year if he wears a mouth
guard, it'll be the in thing to do.<br>
<br>
<b>	E:</b>  If you had kids who played basketball, would you recommend that they wear a mouth guard?<br>
<br>
<b>	BJ:</b>  I would definitely try to give the positives and negatives of having it in and not having it in,
and let them draw their own conclusion. I mean, if I can explain to young people that there are
benefits to wearing mouth pieces and they should be weighed, hopefully they'll wear a mouth
piece and understand that it does help them and it's not just fashionable or just something that you
do. You're wearing it for a reason. <br>

<h2>Ith Pierthing My Tongue Hatherdouth to My Health?</h2>
<p>

Feeling a little rebellious? Bored with your tattoos? Wish you could dye your hair purple but
know better since you just had your colors done and were told that you're an autumn and should
really stick to earth tones? No need to fret. There is an alternative: body piercing. <p>

Seems lately there's no limit to where you can poke a hole and fill it with some sort of shiny
doo-dad. But you're not alone if you think there might also be no limit to the health risks involved
in doing so. <p>

<p>

It's something Rebecca considered before having both her tongue and lower lip pierced, so <p>

she took time to investigate the process first. She chose to have both of her piercings done by
formally trained professional piercers who adhere to the strict standards set by the Association of
Professional Piercers.<p>

<p>

"What matters," Rebecca says, surprisingly lisp-less, "is how professional the person that you're
working with is, if he's clean, and if he knows what he's doing." She explained that the reputable
piercers keep you well informed as to what to expect from the moment you walk in the door.
"You get a sheet to take home that says exactly how to take care of it, what to look out for, what
not to do in what period of time, how long it will to take to heal, and who to call if something
goes wrong."<p>

<p>

When asked if it hurt to get her lip and tongue pierced, Rebecca, who, for the record, has a
slightly more Zen-like approach to pain than most, admitted that while her lip was a piece of cake,
her tongue was swollen and painful for a good nine days after she got it pierced. "On the 10th day
it was fine. It was like it wasn't there." She also mentioned that during that first nine days she bit
down on the barbell (the piece of jewelry in her tongue) once by mistake. But she bit it gently
enough that she didn't chip any teeth.<p>

<p>

While Rebecca has heard and seen a lot of piercing horror stories, she's had a very positive
experience with her mouth piercings. But before you run out and join the ranks of the formidably
cool by piercing your tongue, lip or cheek, consider also the experiences of Dr. Eric Shapira, a
CDA dentist in Half Moon Bay, who has written about intraoral piercing for the Academy of
General Dentistry. <p>

<p>

Dr. Shapira holds an assistant professorship at the University of the Pacific School of Dentistry in
San Francisco and has a mastership in the Academy of General Dentistry. He has witnessed cases
in which teeth have been chipped or broken from biting down on the jewelry in or around the
mouth, as well as numerous infections around the piercing sites.<p>

<p>

Dr. Shapira is not opposed to people piercing in or around their mouths. "It's their body. I think if
anyone's going to make a choice to pierce their body, they need to be responsible for that choice
and realize what the possible side effects are."<p>

<p>

And what are some of those possible side effects? For starters, you can get blood poisoning from
impure metals, allergies, or an increased saliva flow that can result in a permanent drool. An
excess of bacteria on the tongue could cause an underlying infection in the bloodstream. A pierced
tongue can swell so much that it could obstruct the airway. Or the ball that holds the barbell in the
tongue can become loose and be inhaled into the lung. Shapira adds, "There are very specialized
nerves that bring taste to the anterior (front) third of the tongue that can be damaged, so you can
affect your taste. You can affect your speech and the way you eat. I think the worst culprit of all
is the tongue pierce because there are so many ramifications of what can happen during and after
the pierce. Especially breaking of the teeth, which is the major thing I see." <p>

<p>

Like Rebecca, Shapira stresses the importance of investigating the techniques, materials and
background of any potential piercer before going under the needle. All instruments used in the
piercing process should be sterilized and any body part that is being pierced should be disinfected.
He advises people to consult their physician prior to being pierced. Their physician may prescribe
an antibiotic and/or an antiinflammatory to help prevent infection or excess swelling. <p>

<p>

Shapira's advice for people who already have mouth piercings and want to keep them healthy is
to keep them as clean as possible. He suggests using ultrasonic cleaners for the metal jewelry,
flushing the hole with a small rinsing syringe, and rinsing the mouth out and brushing the tongue
and oral tissues daily. He also advises against eating with the metal jewelry in. According to
Rebecca, there's plastic jewelry that you can wear while eating.<p>

<p>

So, in response to the burning question, "Ith pierthing your tongue hatherdouth to your health?" it
seems the answer is a resounding "Pothibly." While entering into this process with as much
information as possible certainly increases your chances for a problem-free piercing experience, it
doesn't necessarily guarantee it. Rebecca sums it up well saying, "It's really about personal
responsibility and paying attention to what's going on and doing what's right for you." And if that
means abandoning the piercing plan for the more innocuous dye job, the color consultants at
<i>ENAMEL</i> suggest a nice, deep auburn.  <p>

<h2>What's a Bill of Rights Without a Few Amendments? </h2>
<p>

Dental times are indeed a'changin'. Dentists and patients alike are crying out for fair and speedy
appointments, freedom of information and freedom from germs. But there's no need to organize a
Dental Patients' March on Sacramento. Because in keeping with the latest changes in dental
coverage and techniques, CDA has already added new amendments to The Dental Patient Bill of
Rights.<p>

<p>

The first amendment states that you have a right to schedule an appointment with your dentist in a
timely manner. It addresses the potential access problems posed by some managed care dental
plans. As a member of one of these plans, if you need to see your plan's dentist in an emergency,
and he or she can't fit you in, it's possible that you may be forced to go to a dentist outside the
plan and end up having to pay for the treatment yourself. But CDA asserts that your dentist
should be able to give you an appointment as quickly as the situation requires.<p>

<p>

The second amendment addresses the so-called "gag clauses" in some dental plans. By asserting
your right to ask your dentist to explain all the treatment options regardless of cost or insurance
coverage, you can make an informed decision as to what treatment is best for you. You can also
ask your dentist to let you know which option(s) your plan will cover.<p>

<p>

When the original Bill of Rights was drawn up, infection and sterilization controls such as gloves
and masks were just beginning to be used in dental offices. Now, there are so many controls
designed to make your visit as safe as possible, there isn't room to list them all on the bill. Among
them are instruments that are either disposable or autoclaved (a pressurized heating process that
kills bacteria), and sterile plastic coverings on the dentist's light, instrument trays and patient's
headrest that are changed between each appointment. The third right now reads: You have a right
to expect dental team members to use appropriate infection and sterilization controls. This revised
wording covers every angle of this important health issue.<p>

<p>

You, the people, have spoken. We, the CDA, in order to provide a more perfect dental
experience, have listened. With these amendments, we hope to continue to uphold the rights of
dental patients in their pursuit of quality dental care. <p>

<p>

<b>	New Amendments</b><br>
<br>
	You have a right to schedule an appointment with your dentist in a timely manner.<br>
	You have a right to ask your dentist to explain all the treatment options regardless of coverage
or cost.<br>
	You have a right to expect dental team members to use appropriate infection and sterilization
controls.<br>

<h2>Ask Molar Man</h2>
<p>

Dear Molar Man,<p>

	My boyfriend, Biff, is boffo. But one whiff of Biff's breath could make a buffalo barf. Can
anything be done to make Biff's bad breath better?<p>

						-- Bothered in Burlingame<p>

<p>

Dear Bothered,<p>

	Boy, things sound bad. But don't be bummed. There's hope for your buddy Biff. The thing is,
Bothered, while some cases of halitosis (the fancy-schmancy scientific name for bad breath) may
be caused by medications or illnesses such as sinus infections or diabetes, many dentists agree that
most cases are caused by lack of oral hygiene and that regular dental cleanings are the most
effective remedy.<p>

	Biff should bravely begin his bad breath battle by brushing and flossing his teeth twice a day. He
should also brush his tongue to remove any pesky, odor-causing bacteria that might be lingering
about after meals. Rinsing his mouth after meals will help get rid of tiny bits of food that could
become, shall we say, pungent, as the day progresses. Saliva is the body's natural mouthwash, so
when Biff's mouth feels dry, he could try chewing sugarless gum to help get the old saliva flowing
again. If Biff's bad breath persists, he should see his dentist, as there may be some other cause.
But in the meantime, a pat on the back to you, Bothered, for standing by your man in his hour of
need. A lesser girlfriend would have bolted on Biff. <p>

						Yours Hygienically, <p>

<h2>The Dentist on The Mouth Guard</h2>
<p>

As one of the dentists in the Olympic Village during the 1984 summer games in Los Angeles, Dr.
Ray Padilla has long been a proponent of custom athletic mouth guards and has worked hard to
raise both athletes' and dentists' awareness of the vital role mouth guards play in our oral health.
Dr. Padilla shares his experiences and insights on mouth guards and sports dentistry in great and,
at times, gory detail.<p>

<p>

Chances are, when most of us think of mouth guards we think of those horribly uncomfortable
and inconvenient plastic jobs we can pick up at a sporting goods store. It's little wonder many of
us choose to risk losing a few teeth over having to wear one of these things for the duration of
whatever game we happen to be playing. Besides, they're quite unattractive.<p>

<p>

This kind of mouth guard is referred to as a stock mouth guard. "Basically," explains Dr. Ray
Padilla, who is a member of CDA, the Academy of Sports Dentistry and the National Youth
Sports Foundation for the Prevention of Athletic Injuries, "you take it out of the package and put
it in your mouth. They only come in two sizes and there is absolutely no attempt made for fit."
There are documented cases of athletes who have cut these mouth guards to make them more
comfortable. They've gotten hit, swallowed them and had to be rushed to the hospital
immediately. <p>

<p>

Another type of mouth guard, which is also horribly uncomfortable, inconvenient, unattractive,
and found in a sporting goods store, is a boil-and-bite mouth guard. As the name suggests, you
soften this mouth guard in boiling water and then bite down on it. The idea being that the
impression your teeth leave will customize the guard to your mouth. "The problem with these
mouth guards," Padilla says, "is they only come in limited sizes, and as you're forming them,
you're biting through the material, so there's hardly any coverage given to the tops of the teeth."<p>

<p>

The only mouth guards that Dr. Padilla believes provide adequate protection to athletes are
custom-made mouth guards that are made directly from a mold of the athlete's mouth. "The
vacuum type mouth guard is what we've been making here in the U.S. for years. It was
considered the best mouth guard available when I graduated from dental school 18 years ago. The
problem with this type that we're finding now is that when the dentist makes them, they fit
adequately. But after wearing them for a few weeks, they lose their shape and then don't fit as
tightly."<p>

<p>

The latest advancement in custom-made mouth guards is the pressure-laminated variety. Padilla
describes the adaptation and fit of this type of mouth guard as phenomenal. "These mouth guards
snap into the mouth and they're actually difficult to remove -- they fit that well. It's the only
mouth guard I place my patients in." And perhaps best of all, for all the style-conscious athletes
out there, they come in a wide array of fashion colors.<p>

<p>

Dr. Padilla has seen more than his share of sports-related injuries to patients who weren't wearing
custom mouth guards. Everything from tongues that have been split open, to broken <p>

jaws to teeth that have been fractured or knocked out entirely. A custom-made mouth guard can
help prevent all of these injuries as well as concussions. <p>

<p>

Surprisingly, custom mouth guards are actually less expensive than a retainer or bleaching tray,
but still only about 5-10 percent of all athletes are wearing them. Dr. Padilla feels athletes should
wear custom-made mouth guards in any sport in which oral injuries are a possibility.<p>

<p>

With the many advances in and advantages to custom mouth guards, you'd be hard pressed to
come up with a good excuse not to wear one. Whether you're a weekend warrior or a Golden
State Warrior, a custom mouth guard can help protect you from injuries and, in doing so, increase
your confidence on the court, field, street, track, slope, ocean or rink. And depending on the color
you choose, it will also make you look that much more menacing to your opponents.<p>

<p>

<b>If you participate in any of these sports you should consider wearing a mouthguard: <p>

Acrobatics,  Badminton,  Baseball,  Basketball,  Bicycling,  Boxing,  Field Hockey, 
Football,  Gymnastics,  Hand ball, Ice Hockey, Lacrosse, Martial Arts,  Racquetball, 
Rollerskating,  Rugby,  Skateboarding,  Skiing,  Soccer,  Softball,  Squash,  Surfing, 
Trampoline,  Water Polo,  Weightlifting,  Wrestling,  and Volleyball</b>

<h1><center>PRIMER</h1>
A publication of the California Dental Association<p>

</center>
<center><h4>Voume 4, NO. 4 - November 1996</b><b></h4>
</center>
<center><h2>This Month's Topic: THE BASICS OF INFECTION CONTROL</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<p>

<i>Once again, we focus on infection control to reacquaint spokespersons with the fundamentals of a highly sensitive
issue.  CDA has continually advised consumers of their right to expect safety in the dental office and of dentists'
adherence to stringent infection control measures to protect patients and the dental team from the transmission of
disease.  Still, today's communicators cannot overemphasize these points.<p>

<p>

Communicators should convey with confidence that the health and well-being of dental patients has been at the heart
of organized dentistry from day one.  But we cannot stop there.  Consumers should be urged to discuss with their
dentists the measures the dental team uses to ensure optimal safety.<p>

<p>

Although infection control is a serious and complex issue, it is not one that spokespersons should feel they have to shy
away from.  And although it lends itself to discussion at great length in technical terms, the facts must be conveyed to
consumers in terms they can understand.<p>

<hr>
<p>

</i><h2>THE FACTS</h2>
<p>

	The risk of transmission of an infectious disease at the dental office from a member of the dental team to a patient is
minuscule; current data supports this statement.<p>

<p>

	The absence of conclusive data to support any incident of HIV transmission at the dental office to a patient
underscores the effectiveness of proper infection control as protection against the transmission of HIV and other
communicable diseases.<p>

<p>

	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has concluded that adherence to "universal precautions"
provides an effective means to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases.   CDA and ADA concur.<p>

<p>

	Universal precautions are protective measures that are observed with every patient to prevent the transmission of <u>any</u>
infectious disease.  These precautions include:<p>

	---<u>	</u>wearing gloves, masks, protective eyewear, and other protective clothing such as gowns or lab coats;<p>

	---	washing hands and changing gloves after each patient;<p>

	---	cleaning and sterilizing dental instruments;<p>

	---	cleaning and disinfecting the treatment area after each patient;<p>

	---	special handling of sharp instruments and needles; and<p>

	---	disposing of needles, other sharp items and regulated waste materials in special containers.<p>

<p>

	There are several acceptable methods of sterilization.  Instruments that can withstand high temperature may be
sterilized in an autoclave or a dry-heat sterilizer.  Instruments that cannot be heat-sterilized are scrubbed clean and
then sterilized or disinfected in chemical solutions.<p>

<p>

	Surfaces and equipment that cannot be removed for sterilization are disinfected by a chemical agent, which is
registered with the Environmental Protection Agency as a hospital disinfectant.  Many offices cover surfaces with
plastic or other material that is changed after each patient.<p>

<p>

	Under ethical and moral commitment to serve the public, CDA member dentists believe that all consumers should
have access to dental treatment and should be treated with dignity, compassion and respect.<p>

<p>

	The law of the land dictates that dentists may not deny treatment to patients solely because of their HIV status.<p>

<p>

	Consumers with infectious diseases or other illnesses should disclose their condition to their dentist and other health
care providers.  This is important because consumers with compromised health might be taking medication that
affects dental treatment.<p>

<p>

	Organized dentistry will continue to cooperate with all who direct public policy regarding infection control but insists
that policy be based on valid scientific data rather than hype, public opinion or speculation.<p>

<p>

	Individual dental practices may adhere to slightly different, yet acceptable, infection control procedures.  CDA
encourages consumers to openly discuss with their dentists specific concerns pertaining to infection control, delivery
of care or any other health issue.<p>

<p>

	CDA member dentists are valuable resources for consumers who wish to obtain information and discuss the measures
taken by the dental team to protect public health.<p>

<p>

	Various ADA councils continually monitor and examine the scientific literature, CDC guidelines and other sources of
new information.  The science of infection control is continually evolving, and organized dentistry will continue to
adapt as science improves.<p>

<p>

	Consumers are best served by seeing their dentists regularly to obtain necessary care, as well as factual and accurate
information regarding infection control.<p>

<hr>
<p>

<h2>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p>

<b>Q</b>	How can I address my concerns about infection control to my dentist without sounding as though I don't trust him or
as if I'm accusing him of wrongdoing?<p>

<p>

<b>A</b>	Dentists are people with fears and concerns just like yours.  They can relate to your need to get information to soothe
your nerves and put things into perspective.  Chances are that they'll be impressed by your interest in discussing a
subject that they deal with on a daily basis.<p>

<p>

<b>Q</b>	I'm ashamed to admit it, but I'm a little uncomfortable knowing that my dentist treats patients who are HIV positive. 
Should I look for another dentist?<p>

<p>

<b>A</b>	All dentists have legal, moral and ethical obligations to treat patients who are HIV positive.  Dentists observe
infection control procedures that are recommended by federal agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention to protect you, other patients and the dental team.  You should make it a point to speak frankly with your
dentist to get the facts about your safety.<p>

 <p>

<b>Q</b>	If my health and safety is a top priority for my dentist, why didn't he use gloves when I started seeing him 13 years
ago?<p>

<p>

<b>A</b>	The science of infection control is constantly evolving.  Dentists revise how they provide care as science improves. 
Don't be surprised if down the line your dentist changes the way he currently does things relating to infection control. 
Rest assured, your safety is a top priority.<p>

<p>

<b>Q</b>	The case of Kimberly Bergalis really made dentists look bad.  Why does it take a tragedy like that for the profession to
address the issue of proper infection control?<p>

<p>

<b>A</b>	Although Kimberly Bergalis' contraction of the AIDS virus was tragic, her struggle brought forth international
<b>public</b> attention to an issue that was not new to dentistry.  In fact, the CDC's findings were inconclusive in
determining how Kimberly Bergalis contracted the virus.  The bottom line is simple.  Proper infection control is
effective protection against the transmission of HIV and other infectious diseases.<p>

<hr>
<p>

<h2>DENTAL CONSUMER CHECKLIST</h2>
<p>

Today's consumer has access to more information than ever before.  When informed, they can make smart decisions
to safeguard their health, lifestyles and pocketbooks.  Dental consumers are encouraged to do the following
regarding:<p>

<p>

<b>Hand-Washing and Gloves</b>:<p>

<p>

Check to see if your dentist and the dental team members wash their hands and put on fresh gloves before starting
treatment.<p>

<p>

<b>Protective Garb</b>:<p>

<p>

Check to see if your dentist and the dental team wear face masks and protective eyewear or face shields, as well as
clean clinic jackets or lab coats over their street clothes, when providing treatment.<p>

<p>

<b>Dental Handpieces</b>:<p>

<p>

Ask if the dental handpiece has been sterilized.  CDA recommends that dental handpieces be sterilized before each new
patient with acceptable methods that destroy microorganisms, including viruses and bacteria.  Ask your dentist to
explain how handpieces and other dental instruments are sterilized.<p>

<p>

<b>Office Cleanliness</b>:<p>

<p>

Check general cleanliness of office surfaces such as counter tops, chairs, X-ray unit heads and light handles.  These
surfaces should either be cleaned with a chemical disinfectant or covered with disposable wraps.<p>

<p>

<b>Disposable Items</b>:<p>

<p>

Check the use of disposable items.  Many dental materials -- such as gloves, masks, wipes, paper drapes, suction-tube
tips, needles and scalpel blades -- are used once and then discarded.<p>

<p>

<b>Waste Material</b>:<p>

<p>

Check to see how waste items are handled.  Needles and other sharp items should be disposed of in special puncture-proof containers; other contaminated waste is disposed of in special bags.

                <p><font color="#00007F"><strong>Dig: </strong>Roger,
                when we last heard from you, you had just gotten <b>'Back
                From Rio'</b>. What prompted you to choose Mars
                for the recording of your new album, '<b>Live
                From Mars'</b>?<br>
                </font><font color="#000000"><strong>Roger: </strong></font>Well
                as Tom Servo says, &quot;Mars has a lot more room
                than Earth for singing and recording&quot;!</p>
                <p><font color="#00007F"><strong>Dig: </strong>&quot;Live
                From Mars&quot; is a collection of DAT recordings
                from your tour. Did you make DAT recordings of
                all of your shows?<br>
                </font><font color="#000000"><strong>Roger: </strong></font>Not
                all, we got quite a few though!</p>
                <p><font color="#00007F"><strong>Dig: </strong>In
                many ways, 'Live From Mars' is a revelation. Your
                trademark twelve string guitar is evident
                throughout, but it is your personality that
                really makes the album work, thanks to your song
                introductions. I remember seeing you several
                times in the 70's when you toured with a band,
                and don't remember you being so talkative. How
                have your solo shows evolved since they began in
                the early '80's?<br>
                </font><font color="#000000"><strong>Roger: </strong></font>I
                started talking more in the mid '80s after
                getting a bad review in Texas for being rather
                dull on stage. At first I told the story of Gene
                Trip from the play <strong>Jacques Levy</strong>
                and I had written. Then after a few years of
                touring, I began writing an autobiography. I
                thought &quot;what would the soundtrack to this
                be like&quot;? And I came up with the show that's
                on &quot;Live From Mars.&quot;</p>
                <p><font color="#00007F"><strong>Dig: </strong>How
                did you find time from your tour of Mars, to
                record new studio tracks with a band in
                Minneapolis, MN. And why did you decide to
                include them on the CD?<br>
                </font><font color="#000000"><strong>Roger: </strong></font>We
                thought it would be nice to add two bonus studio
                tracks. It was really not out of the way because <strong>Mystery
                Science Theater 3000</strong> is based in
                Minneapolis and that's where the former Jayhawks
                live!</p>
                <p><font color="#00007F"><strong>Dig: </strong>How
                did you get hooked up with the <strong>Jayhawks</strong>?<br>
                </font><font color="#000000"><strong>Roger: </strong></font>Rob
                Seidenberg, my A &amp; R man at Hollywood Records
                is a friend of theirs. He suggested us getting
                together, and it worked out great!</p>
                <p><font color="#00007F"><strong>Dig: </strong>How
                do you explain the Mystery Science Theater 3000
                connection, and what kind of comments did those
                little robot guys have about your performance?<br>
                </font><font color="#000000"><strong>Roger: </strong></font>Mystery
                Science Theater 3000 is one of my favorite TV
                shows! They used my name one time and I was
                really honored. When we decided to call the album
                &quot;Live From Mars&quot; we just HAD to have
                them involved. You can read Tom Servo's comments
                in the liner notes.</p>
                <p><font color="#00007F"><strong>Dig: </strong>What
                was your inspiration for <strong>The Folk Den</strong>?
                Did something happen in Rio, or on Mars, that
                made you want to get back to where you once
                belonged?<br>
                </font><font color="#000000"><strong>Roger: </strong></font>It
                was not one specific event, but more, a building
                concern that the old folk songs might get lost in
                the shuffle. All the new &quot;folk singers&quot;
                write their own material.</p>
                <p><font color="#00007F"><strong>Dig: </strong>Are
                the songs chosen for The Folk Den ones that
                you've learned through the years, or are you
                actively in search of folk songs to cover.<br>
                </font><font color="#000000"><strong>Roger: </strong></font>Most
                of the songs in the Folk Den are songs that I've
                known since I attended the Old Town School of
                Folk Music in Chicago, back in the 50s.</p>
                <p><font color="#00007F"><strong>Dig: </strong>How
                were the songs recorded for The Folk Den? Do you
                have a home studio? If so, what equipment is in
                your studio rig, and what instruments did you
                use?<br>
                </font><font color="#000000"><strong>Roger: </strong></font>I
                use a variety of digital audio recording programs
                for Windows. It is a multi-track digital home
                studio.</p>
                <p><font color="#00007F"><strong>Dig: </strong>So
                all of your tracks for The Folk Den are recorded
                direct to disk?<br>
                </font><font color="#000000"><strong>Roger: </strong></font>Yes
                that's how I do it. Then I save them to CD-ROM.</p>
                <p><font color="#00007F"><strong>Dig: </strong>You
                were one of the first to use a moog synthesizer
                on your albums. Do you have an interest today in
                midi synthesizer's, sequencing, or sampling?<br>
                </font><font color="#000000"><strong>Roger: </strong></font>I
                use sampling with my digital audio recorders, but
                I'm not a big fan of MIDI.</p>
                <p><font color="#00007F"><strong>Dig: </strong>Was
                the gap between &quot;<strong>McGuinn/Hillman</strong>&quot;
                in 1980 and &quot;Back From Rio&quot; in 1991
                your own choice, or was it dictated by the record
                companies? If so, do you find the gaps between
                albums frustrating, and do you wish you could
                release more music? <br>
                </font><font color="#000000"><strong>Roger: </strong></font>It
                was my choice not to knock my brains out getting
                a record deal in the 80s. I actually enjoy the
                gaps between recordings. It gives me time to live
                a quality life. </p>
                <p><font color="#00007F"><strong>Dig: </strong>Are
                there many unreleased Roger McGuinn tracks?<br>
                </font><font color="#000000"><strong>Roger: </strong></font>There
                are not a lot of out-takes in the vault.</p>

                you have any plans for another Electric Rock

                The next project I do will be a Studio - Rock CD.</p>
                <p><font color="#00007F"><strong>Dig: </strong>Are
                you content with what you have achieved
                musically, or are you still trying to get there?<br>
                </font><font color="#000000"><strong>Roger: </strong></font>I
                like the style that I've grown into. After years
                of wild experimentation, I've relaxed and learned
                to enjoy the rolling 12-string sound.</p>

                seems over the last few years, you have been very

                next question. <strong>David Crosby</strong> was
                quoted recently as saying he would love to get
                back together with you and Chris Hillman anytime
                to perform as the Byrds, but that you were not
                interested. And you know, the harmonies of
                Crosby/Hillman/McGuinn sounded better than ever
                on Rio. So what's the scoop, and why hasn't
                anybody thought to ask you about a Byrds reunion
                before :-) ?<br>
                </font><font color="#000000"><strong>Roger: </strong></font>I
                really love touring solo acoustic. My wife and I
                go on the road and it's like a honeymoon! Touring
                with a band isn't fun for me at this point, and
                I'd just prefer to continue doing what I love.</p>

                got my first computer in 1982. I learned a great
                deal about them, taking them apart, putting
                different chips in, building hardware, and
                writing software. By the mid 80's I was on-line
                with CompuServe and a music business Email
                service called Easy Street. In the early 90's I
                got into the Internet and found the World Wide
                Web. It's really great fun to communicate around

            height="14"> <font color="#FFFFFF">Turning a play
            into a movie is always a hit-or-miss process, and I
            still don't know quite what to make of the latest
            film to take that journey, I'M NOT RAPPAPORT.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Based on the
            critically-acclaimed play of the same name, I'M NOT
            RAPPAPORT as the story of two elderly men, Nat, a
            Jewish/socialist radical and compulsive liar (Walter
            Matthau), and Midge, a black, nearly blind apartment
            superintendent (Ossie Davis). The pair has an uneasy
            friendship based on the fact that they sit on the
            same bench in Central Park, where Nat fills Midge's
            head with fabrications. Nat's flair for creating new
            personae for himself draws the pair into one minor
            adventure after another, involving a young
            artist-in-training (Martha Plimpton), a drug dealer
            (Craig T. Nelson), a mugger (Guillermo Diaz), and
            threats from Nat's daughter (Amy Irving) regarding
            the ever-looming old folks' home.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The stuff of Broadway? For
            sure. The stuff of Hollywood? I don't think so. The
            problems of compressing a heartwarming story about
            two old guys who hang around Central Park into a
            feature film have obviously taken their toll on I'M
            NOT RAPPAPORT, and what we've got is a 2-hour,
            15-minute opus that features a very rocky start, some
            unneeded subplots, and an overly repetitious plotline
            that is compelling despite its heavy talkiness.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Matthau and Davis are truly
            inspired as the leads (they worked together before in
            GRUMPY OLD MEN), and it's great to see Plimpton
            again, but whoever was in charge of putting Irving
            and Nelson in this movie should be put in the old
            folks' home themselves. Herb Gardner's direction of
            his own script is as good as you can expect for a
            piece like this (he changes camera angles enough to
            keep it interesting, and that's about it), but
            nothing much else is overly inspired.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The film is
            semi-entertaining and semi-interesting, but unless
            you're really into this kind of tale,
            &quot;semi&quot; probably isn't going to cut it.</font></p>

                Hriteau's love of beauty and extensive
                knowledge of gardening in North America have
                bloomed into a magical book about GLORIOUS
                GARDENS. Gardeners are invited to reconsider the
                space around them and create a personal vision of
                beauty. Rules don't matter and any plant is
                appropriate, provided the environmental needs,
                such as climate, light, soil and site conditions,
                are met. Drawing inspiration from the 250
                full-color photographs used as illustrations,
                Hriteau has written a book for all gardeners
                and for all those entranced by beautiful living
                spaces.</p>

                gardens in this volume make abundantly

                Hales, Curtice Taylor, Andrew Lawson, Hugh Palmer

                <p>This is an unusual book written for North
                American gardeners and drawing visual inspiration
                from here and abroad. Gardeners down the ages
                have gained new ideas from their travels, and
                interpreted them for their own garden conditions.
                Many types of gardens are considered, including
                kitchen gardens, weekend gardens, seashore
                gardens, hillside gardens, xeriscapes and small
                gardens. Practical knowledge is necessary for a
                successful garden wherever it may be, so the
                Appendix includes Gardening Basics, plus a list
                of outstanding plants and some sources.</p>
                <p><font color="#004080" size="3"><em>...the way
                to a beautiful landscape is to make the land and
                the plants your co-creators... take a rocking
                chair out to the garden and sit in it with
                catalogs and plan your garden....walk your land
                in bad weather, good weather, plant under an

    <p>&quot; Yes, sir-can I help you?&quot; asks the clerk at
    the computer store. </p>
    <p>&quot;I'd like to return the Christmas present I got for
    my niece,&quot; I reply. </p>
    <p>&quot;And what seems to be wrong with it?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Wrong?&quot; I ask incredulously. &quot;Wrong? My
    niece is only 13 years old! Good Lord, man, how could you
    have sold me a toy this sadistic?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Sadistic, sir? There must be some mistake-this is
    SymGarden; one of the most popular software simulation
    games this season. It teaches players about the joys of
    gardening.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Look,&quot; I retort, &quot;This so-called game has
    my niece so upset that her parents are interviewing child
    psychiatrists! No one in my family is currently talking to
    me.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;I'm still trying to understand this. What seems to
    be wrong with the product? How is it broken?&quot; persists
    the salesperson. </p>
    <p>&quot;It's not broken-that's the whole point!&quot; I
    snarl. &quot;SymWare has done it again-it's a perfect
    simulation of gardening. And now my niece is as close to a
    nervous breakdown as a child can be! Here, let me show you on
    the store copy.&quot; </p>
    <p>I sit the clerk down at a computer terminal and tell him
    to double-click on the SymGarden icon-a smiling,
    anthropomorphic sun staring lovingly at a bunch of tiny
    flowers that look equally pleased to be there. Suddenly on
    the screen we see: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <h3><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">WELCOME
        TO </font><font color="#800000"><br>
        </font><font color="#FF0000" size="5" face="Arial Black">SymGarden

        </font><font color="#000000"><em>Where the Wonder of
        Gardening Comes Alive! </em></font></h3>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We patiently wait for the perky synthesizer music to reach
    the end (a kind of a fadeout into stereo bird sounds) and
    then the OPTIONS BOX confronts us. The clerk quickly chooses
    the soil type, the climate, the size of the garden, and the
    kinds of flowers, shrubs, and bushes he wants to
    &quot;grow.&quot; </p>
    <p>He looks up at me with thinly disguised disdain.
    &quot;See? What could be simpler? I'd start worrying about
    your niece, if I were you, buddy. If she can't take a little
    gardening...&quot; He is interrupted by a klaxon sound
    issuing from the computer. </p>
    <p>&quot;Jeez, what the hell was that?&quot; he says, clearly
    flustered. I knew. I had been there before with my niece. </p>
    <p>&quot;It's the rainfall indicator, my friend-it looks like
    the simulation has dealt you a drought,&quot; I say grimly.
    &quot;And those computer-modeled impatiens aren't looking
    very well.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Oh no!&quot; shouts the clerk. &quot;Look! What do I
    do? What do I do?&quot; On the screen, the little impatiens
    were going into a melodramatic wilt care of state-of-the-art
    animation. </p>
    <p>&quot;Try the WATERING option-say, SPRINKLER,&quot; I
    suggest. His fingers fly across the keyboard. </p>
    <p>&quot;Look, they're coming back!&quot; says the clerk with
    manic glee. &quot;But, er, what's happening to the other
    stuff? Now it's looking even worse than before!&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Well, you watered at mid-day. The game doesn't like
    you doing that-it's not a good thing and the game kills stuff
    to make its point,&quot; I explain, ignoring the clerk's
    developing eye tick. </p>
    <p>He quickly reviews other options and begins to pull his
    SymGarden back from the brink. &quot;Now we're rolling.
    Look at all the stuff blooming! I told you that it was...Hey,
    where's all the green going?&quot; he screams as the screen
    shows his garden rapidly yellowing. </p>
    <p>I'd been there, too, with my niece. &quot;Bugs. You got
    bugs. Look down there at the BUG BOX-mites, beetles, aphids,
    gypsy moths; you name it, you got it. You better do something
    fast.&quot; </p>
    <p>Panicking, the clerk clicks on an icon that looks like a
    spray can and pushes a slider to Max. &quot;Die, die,
    die!&quot; he hisses at the screen as little animated bugs
    drop on their backs with their buggy legs up in the air. His
    tie is now loosened and he is sweating profusely. </p>
    <p>&quot;Hey! My points just dropped by 1,000! What
    happened?&quot; he whimpers, as a mocking sound draws his
    attention to the SCORE BOX. </p>
    <p>&quot;Ah, that would be the family dog,&quot; I say sagely
    (for I too had panicked at the sight of the bugs). You killed
    it. It was the insecticide. Too much, too soon, too wide an
    area. The game hates it when you launch a chemical assault on
    your garden.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Don't talk to me about a dead animated dog at this
    point,&quot; he snarls, showing me the whites of his eyes.
    &quot;I have bigger problems to contend with-weeds, I've got
    weeds everywhere!! Look at the WEED BOX: goose grass, crab
    grass, wild grapevine, and god knows what else!&quot; He is
    sobbing now, even as he spits the words out. </p>
    <p>I try to console him, but he is having none of it. I watch
    as he wipes out the lawn applying the wrong weed killer and
    then I look on as he tries to reseed in the winter. It is not
    a pretty sight. He is in his own world now and I wonder if he
    will ever rejoin ours again. Shrugging at this thought, I
    open the cash register and take out the price of SymGarden
    plus the tax. </p>
    <p>As I leave, I can hear him laughing hysterically and
    trying to throttle the monitor. &quot;The wonders of
    gardening? I'll show you the wonders of gardening! Those
    hailstones just smashed my tulips ...&quot; The strains of
    perky synthesizer music finally drowns him out. </p>

    <h2><img src="../graphics/poinsettia.jpg" width="240"

    <p><font size="5" face="Arial"><strong>A Gift From Mexico<br>
    </strong></font><font color="#000000" size="4"><em><strong>Dr.
    H. Marc Cathey, with Jacquline Heriteau</strong></em></font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Long before Christmas came to the Western
    continents and adopted the poinsettia, Cuetlaxochitl, the
    plant that turned red in November and December, was cherished
    as a symbol of purity by the Aztecs including the last
    emperor, Montezuma, (1466-1520). They also had practical
    applications for the plant. From the pointed bracts they
    extracted a reddish purple dye used as a cosmetic, and the
    milky white latex sap went into a medicinal preparation to
    counteract fever. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">A ten-foot tall, stiff-canned shrub, the
    evergreen poinsettia is a Central American native that
    flourishes in the arid tropical highlands surrounding Taxco
    de Alarcon, a town in Southern Mexico. In the seventeenth
    century, a settlement of Franciscan priests near Taxco
    incorporated the poinsettia's bright red into a nativity
    procession. Two centuries later the poinsettia was introduced
    to the United States, and it was a hundred years more before
    it become established as the world's best-known Christmas
    flower, and Big $ Business. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">It was Joel Roberts Poinsett, a
    cosmopolitan American statesman, who set the poinsettia on
    the road to stardom. In 1825, President Madison appointed
    Poinsett to be the first United States Minister (Ambassador)
    to turbulent Mexico. Something of a Renaissance man, Poinsett
    was known for the fierce courage with which he had handled
    challenges to the young US government. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">In Mexico City Poinsett lived up to his
    reputation, facing down revolutionary mobs threatening people
    under the protection of the American embassy. The son of a
    French physician/apothecary, and a former medical student,
    Poinsett was also an able botanist. While his heroic missions
    to Latin America have been consigned to the dust of history
    -- as has his role as a founder of the precursor to the
    famous Smithsonian Institution -- his interest in the plant
    that turned red at Christmas is likely to immortalize his
    name. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">In 1828, Poinsett sent poinsettia plants
    back to his home in Charleston, SC. The first known US-grown
    poinsettias were propagated quite casually in Poinsett's
    greenhouses and distributed to family friends and botanical
    gardens. Among the friends was John Bartram of Philadelphia.
    Bartram passed the gift plant on to Robert Buist, a
    Pennsylvania nurseryman, and it was Buist who first sold the
    poinsettia under the botanical name it now bears, Euphorbia
    pulcherrima -- which means the most beautiful Euphorbia. It
    also has many colorful common names: Flower of the Holy
    Night; Christmas Star; Christmas Flower; Painted Lady;
    Lobster Plant; Mexican Flameleaf. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">What all euphorbias have in common is a
    milky sap which can be a skin irritant -- but there's nothing
    poisonous abuot the planbt -- and this flowerhead composed of
    small button-shaped blooms and colorful bracts. The
    poinsettia's brilliant red &quot;petals&quot; are bracts, not
    petals. Bracts are petal-like modified leaves that change
    color. The cluster of tiny round yellow blossoms that center
    the poinsettia's red bracts are its true flowers. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The poinsettia's passage from Aztec symbol
    to world-famous potted plant has been eventful, and its
    contributions, like Poinsett's, more significant than is
    generally known. The gawky stems of the original species have
    stringy red bracts which tend to drop after flowering, along
    with the leaves, and the flowers rarely form seeds. Many
    years of research and investment dollars separate the
    original plant from today's long-lasting, compact,
    multi-branched, oak-leaved hybrids that come in assorted
    decorator colors, from white and pink to yellow and all
    manner of variations on the original red. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Growing the poinsettia now is a world-wide,
    billion-dollar enterprise providing thousands of jobs, but
    the name most often associated with modern hybrids is that of
    a German immigrant to the US, Paul Ecke. In 1906 the first
    Paul Ecke moved from the farm he had established in Eagle
    Rock Valley, California, (now Los Angeles), to Hollywood.
    There he raised gladioli, chrysanthemums and poinsettias for
    the cut-flower trade. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Though not much use as a landscape plant in
    temperate regions, the poinsettia soars in southern
    California gardens. For Ecke, the harvest was bountiful, but
    the narrow bracts tended to color too soon and many of the
    plants lost their foliage at shipping time, or soon after.
    Then a &quot;sport&quot; that held its foliage better than
    the species volunteered in a neighbor's yard, and Ecke's son
    Albert acquired it. A sport is a plant that on its own
    presents a genetic change that is reproducible. This sport
    also had much wider bracts which gave the plants better
    color. Named 'Early Red', it became the favorite cutting
    poinsettia. In 1920 another sport appeared, a show-stopper
    with even wider, more compact red bracts. Named 'Hollywood',
    it became the potted plant sold during the holidays. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">But early in 'Hollywood's' reign a plant
    with a characteristic that would be included in the makeup of
    all modern poinsettias sported in the Jersey City garden of a
    Mrs. Enteman. Named 'Oak Leaf', its broad, twice-scalloped
    foliage was more attractive than earlier poinsettias. Better
    yet -- the leaves and bracts stayed on the plant through the
    crucial shipping period, the week before Christmas. From 1923
    to the early 1960s all commercial sales in the US came from
    poinsettias developed from 'Oak Leaf'. Many of the varieties,
    perhaps most, were selected and multiplied by Paul Ecke.
    Along the way came a sport that was an early blooming white,
    the first of the modern colors. The new breeds </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Before 1960, very few poinsettias were
    grown in Europe, and those were used primarily as fresh-cut
    flowers for Christmas. The first truly long lasting
    poinsettia was introduced in 1963 by Ohio nurseryman Jim
    Mickelson who named the plant for his father, 'Paul
    Mickelson'. The following year from Norway came 'Annette
    Hegg', a plant which combined an extraordinary capacity for
    branching and lasting keeping qualities. Easy to grow, the
    Hegg cultivars have the ability to develop five to eight
    bracts from a single pinched-out stem, with up to fifteen
    branches per plant. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">No one understands just why, but just an
    inch or two of a Hegg stem grafted onto an ordinary
    poinsettia induces self-branching in the entire plant and it
    will always be like that, it won't revert. More branching
    means more stem-ends, more bracts, and therefore more color.
    The Hegg miracle spread throughout Europe, the US, and
    Canada. In 1969, the red 'Annette Hegg' sported to white,
    then marble, then dark red, then orange-red, all still within
    the Christmas color scheme. In 1972, 'Annette Hegg' in hot
    pink appeared, and in 1984, a whiter white came from Denmark.
    These decorator colors were desirable before and after the
    holiday season, inching the poinsettia towards a niche in the
    realm of decorator plants. Throughout these years, the Ecke
    nurseries in California continued to introduce new poinsettia
    forms. In 1992 the Echespoint (T) strain came onto the market
    with 'Freedom'. A compact plant that flowers early and has
    bright ruby red bracts and dark green foliage, 'Freedom'
    travels well. It has set the standard for today's industry.
    Dazzling new colors appeared -- the golden yellow Eckespoint
    'Lemon Drop', and a bronzed 'Pink Peppermint'. The 1993 star
    poinsettia, 'Monet', splashes every bract with the warm
    pink-orange-yellow colors of the garden at Giverny that
    inspired some of the French artist's most beautiful
    paintings. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">In 1992 the poinsettia was included on the
    list of houseplants most succesful in removing pollutants
    from indoor air -- another boost to its emerging role as a
    year-round indoor plant. Flower of the future </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The extraordinary 1993 poinsettia is a
    shining example of the riches, spiritual and financial, that
    can be created through the study and modification of plant
    properties. The basic research on the inter-relations of
    light, temperature, and chemicals in plant growth that has
    made the poinsettia a year-round industry, has made other
    plants available year-round as well, notably mums. The growth
    controls found effective with the poinsettia are successfully
    applied to agriculture, and have given many areas a
    substantial boost. The poinsettia's extreme sensitivity to
    air pollution has given science an environmental
    &quot;canary&quot;, a valued tool for investigating the
    effects of pollution, drought, atmospheric changes, and ultra
    violet radiation. One set of pigments within the surface of
    the poinsettia leaf act as optical screens shielding internal
    tissues from damage by UV radiation. Sometime in the future
    -- who knows? -- the most beautiful euphoria may lead to
    total sunscreen protection for humans. In its passage from
    super-sensitive primitive to Flower of the Holy Night, the
    plant cherished by the Aztecs as a symbol of purity hints at
    a future which may appear almost as miraculous as the first
    Christmas.</font></p>

        light that is bright enough to read by.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Keep the soil moist to the touch, but
        don't allow water to stand in the plant saucer.After
        January 1:</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Once the plant shows signs of new
        growth, apply all-purpose houseplant fertilizer at
        half-strength each every watering. After St. Patrick's
        Day, 17:</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Give the plant a thorough cleaning.
        Remove fading bracts, and drying foliage.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Loosen the top of the soil and add and
        inch or two of sterile plant mix.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Move the plant to a brighter location.
        After Memorial Day, May 30:</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Promote side branching by cutting back
        by at least two inches all the stems and branches. Reduce
        extra long branches by half.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Repot the plant in a larger container
        and fill with sterile plant mix.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Move the plant outdoors to low indirect
        light for a week or so, then to bright indirect light.
        Keep the soil moist. After Independence Day, July 4:</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Cut back all the new growth to promote
        side branching.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Move the plant to full sunlight.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Fertilize at full strength at each
        watering. After Labor Day:</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Move the plant indoors to a sunny
        window.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Reduce the fertilization to half
        strength. After the first day of autumn, Sept. 21:</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Provide the poinsettia with 12 hours of
        full sun or bright light, and 12 hours of continuous
        unbroken darkness, in a room where temperatures are 62 to
        65 degrees at night.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Rotate the plant weekly so all sides
        receive equal light. After Thanksgiving Day:</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Discontinue the short day/long night
        treatment, and move the plant to bright sun for at least
        six hours daily.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Reduce the amount of fertilizer by half
        again. With luck, by the holidays the poinsettia will
        color up again. But even if it doesn't, the poinsettia
        will have grown into a handsome foliage plant, one that
        will help to scrub the indoor air of assorted pollutants.</font></p>

FAVORITES</font><font color="#400040" size="6" face="Arial Black">
FROM THIS YEARS GARDEN</font></h1>

<blockquote>
    <h2><font size="4"><em><strong><i><img
    src="../graphics/peppers.jpg" width="240" height="160"></i></strong></em></font></h2>
    <h2><font size="4"><em><strong><i>by Marie Iannotti</i></strong></em></font></h2>
    <p><font size="3">It seems that as soon as I finish mulching
    the perennials in the fall, the new seed catalogs start
    arriving. Today Thompson &amp; Morgan arrived in full color.
    While I am tempted to start dreaming about next year's
    gardens, I think it's important to steal a few minutes and
    jot down some notes about the plants that really performed
    past expectations in the garden this year. Here at home I
    look first to the vegetable garden. Actually I should look
    first to the freezer as a reliable indication of how the
    harvest went. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">I have always had good luck with peppers,
    both hot and sweet, but this year I was truly blessed.
    Outstanding among the hot peppers was a small, round, red
    variety labeled cherry red hot. I picked the plants up as
    seedlings at a local nursery and I have yet to find seeds by
    the same name. Although I saved some seeds from this year's
    harvest, if anyone knows of a source for more seeds, I would
    be very appreciative. This is a delightful plant to grow.
    Beautiful color, unplagued by pests and disease and extremely
    fruitful. It was not uncommon to see a dozen ripe peppers on
    a relatively compact 18&quot; plant at any given time from
    July through frost. The flesh was quite thick for such a
    small fruit and holds up well with cooking. I'd say
    temperature-wise they are a step below jalapenos, but with a
    good bite while retaining a &quot;pepper&quot; flavor. And
    being round, they are the ideal shape for removing the seeds
    easily. One turn of a spoon scoops out everything, leaving
    the perfect bowl for stuffing and using as an hors d'oeuvre.
    I will definitely be growing these again next season.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Another vegetable I'd like to recommend is
    spaghetti squash. If you haven't yet tried it, spaghetti
    squash got it's common name because the cooked pulp comes out
    in strands like spaghetti, when you scrap it out with a fork.
    Prolific doesn't do justice to this squashes' growth habit.
    We had to add supports to our squash trellis, since they are
    a winter squash and take a while to mature on the vine.
    Luckily it's an excellent keeper. If you don't know what you
    would do with so much squash, I can attest that it is an
    excellent substitute for rice or noodles in curry, stir fry
    or primavera dishes. I noticed that the Burpee catalog had
    seeds for a spaghetti squash called &quot;Hasta La
    Pasta&quot; that matures in just 73 days and is billed as a
    compact plant. Maybe I'll try this variety also and see if I
    can forgo the additional supports.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">One of the community gardens I worked on
    this summer was at the county fairgrounds, behind the newly
    built horticulture building. We needed the garden to peak in
    mid-August for the fair and we wanted to demonstrate some
    unusual annuals for people to consider using in their home
    gardens. We called it &quot;Great Garden Performers&quot;.
    Fortunately, we got a garden that lived up to its name. A
    little TLC and a lot of milorganite yielded a garden that
    literally drew &quot;wow&quot;s from people coming around the
    corner.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Standouts from this garden included a
    beautiful Euphorbia, Euphorbia marginata `Summer
    Icicle&quot;. About three feet tall and 2 feet wide, with
    imposing variegation and small white flowers, it was a show
    stopper. Virtually everyone asked what it was. However most
    people were disappointed to learn it was an annual in our
    area and didn't think they would try it at home. Too bad,
    because for such a delicate plant it is unusually striking.
    We used it as a reoccurring theme and it had no problem
    serving as an anchor for the rest of the garden.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">I think my favorite specimens were the
    salvias. Particularly the Salvia horminum and Salvia
    coccinea. S. horminum or paper sage comes in Oxford Blue and
    Pink Sunday, both beautiful intense, heathered colors that
    complement each other. We planted these in front of Italian
    White sunflowers at the entrance to the building. They proved
    to be a great draw for getting people to walk around the
    entrance to where they could take in the rest of the garden.
    They grow about a foot and a half tall and the flowers do
    have a papery feel to them, giving them their name. They also
    make a wonderful dried flower. I've recently seen a white
    variety advertised. Definitely grow in large bunches, for
    impact.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Salvia coccinea is &quot;Lady in Red&quot;.
    It's an All-America Winner and very popular with butterflies
    too. I loved it because it always looked fresh. The brilliant
    red coloring never faded. Perhaps people were picking the
    flowers before they had a chance to fade. If so, new blooms
    must have filled in quickly, because I never saw any lag
    time. One batch in direct sun was getting a bit too tall and
    falling over. We cut them all back and within a couple of
    weeks they were once again in full, beautiful bloom. They are
    supposed to be a good choice for containers, also. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Singling out five plants as standouts
    during a good garden year is difficult. I think I've made
    respectable choices since I have already started thinking
    about where to plant these five next year. They were all
    vigorous, unfussy, welcome additions and I hope any of you
    who audition them in your gardens next season do as well with
    them as I was fortunate enough to. If you do try growing
    them, I would enjoy hearing how successful you are.</font></p>

            height="14"> <font color="#FFFFFF">Well, another new
            Disney movie is coming out and with it comes the
            theaters packed with screaming babies, very restless
            kids kicking your seat, and throngs of grownups
            providing running commentary of everything on the
            screen (to themselves, not the kids).</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">This is not a good thing.
            This time, the Disney movie is 101 DALMATIANS, the
            live-action version, and if any movie could make me
            long for a quick and painless death, this is it.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">In an era when we get smart
            &quot;children's&quot; movies like BABE, why does
            dreck like this have to continue to be made? The new
            101 DALMATIANS goes like this: Roger (Jeff Daniels)
            is a video game designer in London (where all the
            best video game designers live, I'm sure), and Anita
            (Joely Richardson) is a fashion designer in the
            employ of one Cruella DeVil (Glenn Close). Roger and
            Anita both have Dalmatians, and the super-smart dogs
            conspire to get Roger and Anita together. He proposes
            marriage an hour after he meets her, they get
            hitched, the Dalmatians have puppies, and Cruella
            decides she wants them for a coat. Cruella steals the
            happy couple's puppies plus a bunch more from other
            people. Dogs outwit baddies and escape, bringing down
            Cruella and her evil henchmen.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Well, la-dee-dah. This plot
            couldn't be less interesting if it was written by
            HOME ALONE's John Hughes. Oh, wait a minute! It *was*
            written by John Hughes! Silly me!!! In fact, 101
            DALMATIANS is almost *exactly* the same movie as HOME
            ALONE. Point in fact: Kid/dogs in trouble; bad guys
            chase him/them; kid/dogs end(s) up being much more
            resourceful; bad guys fall down a lot. Oh, funny!</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you're saying,
            &quot;Hey, this is a kid's movie! Lighten up!&quot;
            Well, I don't think it's anywhere near being suitable
            for children, despite it's G rating -- there are
            blatant sex jokes, dead/dying animals, reactionary
            Puritanical attitudes (women should stay in the
            home), and downright destructive messages.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">And this movie isn't for
            adults, either, because this next brick in the wall
            of the Disney empire is so dumbed-down it ends up
            just rotting the audience's brains. There's never any
            sense of &quot;thrill&quot; to this adventure, the
            acting is mundane, and I laughed at *one* single joke
            (&quot;Who gets the gold?&quot;) But hey, this is
            Disney, and maybe brain rot is what they're aiming
            for! (Because then you'll pay to see next year's
            animated HERCULES, which, from the trailer, looks
            even worse.)</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">So what do we learn from 101
            DALMATIANS? That your dog is smarter than you? That
            if your dog saves someone else's dog, you get to keep
            it? Who can say?</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Hell, I'm a cat person,
            after all. So what do I know?</font></p>

            <p><img src="../graphics/film/stars2.gif" width="61"
            height="14"> <font color="#FFFFFF">We've already had
            three movies based on TV shows this year, plus a film
            based on a TV commercial, but I think it's a really
            bad omen when a film is based on a series of trading
            cards.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The film is MARS ATTACKS!,
            and with it Tim Burton serves up the worst production
            of his once-blossoming career, a movie wherein he
            indulges every excess of his demented psyche, pays no
            attention to entertaining the audience, and recycles
            every joke he can get his hands on.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The joke recycling would be
            okay, even appropriate, given Burton's predilection
            for shtick, if only the jokes were *funny*! But
            they're not. Nothing much is funny in MARS ATTACKS!,
            whose mildly amusing &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;
            story can best be described as... Mars attacks.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Burton obviously started
            this production in the casting -- Jack Nicholson as
            the president, Glenn Close as his uppity wife,
            Annette Bening as a New Age freak, Pierce Brosnan as
            a sophisticated science advisor. You get the idea. I
            guess Burton figured that throwing Tom Jones (as
            himself) into the mix would make it all better.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">And maybe it would have,
            except the performances look like they're cobbled
            together from the days off that the cast of some 15
            &quot;name&quot; actors happened to have. Bits and
            pieces of what should be on the editing room floor
            have somehow made their way into the final print
            instead, and in no particular order, either. Only one
            running joke stands out as worthy -- a flirtation
            between two disembodied heads (I won't say who).</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I realize that MARS ATTACKS!
            was supposed to be a tongue-in-cheek homage to the
            cheesy, old sci-fi flicks (but Tim, you *already*
            made ED WOOD), but MARS ATTACKS! isn't even any good
            as a farce. The movie just plain looks bad -- too bad
            to be taken seriously, but not bad enough to look bad
            on purpose. And Burton's use of ultra-campy stars

            height="14"> <font color="#FFFFFF">What has been
            billed as the first &quot;really scary&quot; movie in
            a long time surprisingly lives up to its promise
            (due, in part, to the fact that there hasn't been a
            really scary movie since THE EXORCIST III in 1990),
            with plenty of screaming on the screen and in the
            audience. Wes Craven's SCREAM is a true exercise in
            the horror film -- an in-depth study of the genre
            that terrifies at the same time as it good-naturedly
            pokes a little fun at itself.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Anyway, Miramax is
            practically *begging* critics not to reveal the plot,
            so I'll just give you the starting point: an
            all-alone Drew Barrymore answers a phone call from a
            deranged killer, and it goes downhill from there. Be
            aware that the &quot;star&quot; of the show is not
            Barrymore, but is actually Neve Campbell (THE CRAFT).
            And the *real* stars are a couple of her character's
            friends, played by a now-blonde Rose McGowan (THE
            DOOM GENERATION) and Matthew Lillard (HACKERS), who
            totally steal the show.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Of course, these are only
            two of the dozens of characters who serve as Fresh
            Meat for our killer, the most notable of which is
            probably Courtney Cox as a trashy tabloid TV reporter
            covering the story.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Thank God Craven has imbued
            SCREAM with witty dialogue, fine plot development,
            and an ending that actually seems remotely plausible.
            While he does let up with the terror in the final act
            (I won't be having any nightmares tonight), I left
            pleasantly surprised and a bit shaken up from so much
            jumping in my seat. I'm sure you'll agree. It's a...
            well... a scream.</font></p>

            height="14"> <font color="#FFFFFF">I realize, right
            from the start, that absolutely *nothing* I say about
            BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA is going to sway you
            at all, one way or another, about whether or not to
            see the film.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Nevertheless, I'm going to
            comment, mainly out of habit.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">If you've read this far, I
            just have to wonder -- what are you expecting from
            this film? A work of genius? A breakthrough
            performance for the two delinquent boys made famous
            by MTV? What kind of a bunghole reads a review of a
            Beavis and Butt-head movie without knowing from the
            start exactly what's coming???</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO
            AMERICA is exactly what it claims to be -- no more,
            no less. It's about 78 minutes of spare animation,
            butt jokes, rock &amp; roll music, and enough
            Technicolor slapstick to... um, well, um... hu-huh...
            I said &quot;stick.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, now *I've* got Mike
            Judge's grating characters on the brain, so I've got
            to give him credit. Who would have thought that in
            the time it takes to eat lunch, two kids who do
            nothing but watch TV all day could get involved with
            a tale of a stolen biological warfare device, hitmen,
            ATF agents, and the collapse of Hoover Dam, and live
            to watch TV again? Far-fetched, you say? It's a
            *cartoon*, people.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the film is already
            destined to be a cult classic, I'm sure, so I guess
            you'd better see it too. For the record, the jokes
            are above average for typical B&amp;B material, there
            are a number of celebrity voice cameos that I won't
            spoil for you, plus enough movie spoofs to entertain
            even a non-fan of the show. And, it's only 78 minutes
            long -- it's like, you can either catch the movie, or
            you can watch an episode of &quot;Baywatch.&quot;
            Take your pick.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">In the end, I was relatively
            amused and entertained. Beavis and Butt-head
            &quot;do&quot; America -- in every sense of the title
            -- and the movie is simply a fine homage to a movie
            whose parts add up to less than its whole.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Hu-huh, hu-huh. I said
            &quot;hole.&quot;</font></p>

<h1><font color="#800000" size="6" face="Arial Black">COOKING

HERBS</font></h1>

<blockquote>
    <h2><img src="../graphics/books/herbs_in_the_kitchen.jpg"
    width="140" height="148"></h2>
    <p><font size="5" face="Arial"><strong>Basil</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times">Basil is an especially easy annual herb
    plant to grow. Look for seed to sow in the vegetable garden
    or perennial bed next spring. Although it does not reseed in
    my yard it&#146;s worth the effort to purchase seed every
    year. There are oodles of varieties available. In a copy of
    Shepherd&#146;s 1994 Garden Seed Catalog there are lettuce
    leaf, broadleaf, purple opal, anise, lemon, Greek mini
    &#145;windowbox&#146;&quot;, and cinnamon under the
    &#145;Scented Basils&#146; heading. Then there&#146;s genova
    profumatissima, fino verde compactto, and napoletano under
    the &#145;Italian Basils&#146; heading!</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times">Now that Basil season is almost over be
    sure to go out and harvest some of this flavorful herb before
    the frost. It can be dried, frozen, or preserved in oil. If
    you didn&#146;t plant it this year find room for it next
    year. It&#146;s a companion plant to tomatoes in the
    vegetable garden and &#145;purple ruffles&#146; adds a nice
    complement to the flower border. You can dry or preserve it
    in several ways. Basil vinegar can be considered a gift
    giving idea anytime of the year. Remember to attach a recipe
    for its use or include a seed packet. Here&#146;s several
    recipes to try. This first recipe would be yummy served with
    fresh fruit and garlic bread.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Times"><strong><u>Pasta with Fresh
    Tomato and Basil Sauce</u></strong><strong> Serves 3 or 4</strong></font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times">1 1/4 pounds of ripe tomatoes</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times">2 or 3 garlic cloves</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times">1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times">1 T. red wine vinegar</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times">salt, freshly ground pepper, pinch
        of red pepper flakes</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times">3 or 4 large sprigs of basil</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times">1/2 pound pasta ( shells are
        suggested )</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times">Rinse the tomatoes, core them, and cut
    them into 1/2 inch cubes. Mince garlic. Mix the tomatoes,
    garlic, olive oil and wine vinegar in a bowl. Season with
    salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes (optional). Refrigerate
    this sauce for at least 30 minutes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times">Cook the pasta in abundant boiling
    water. When the pasta is nearly al dente, tear or shred basil
    leaves and add to the sauce.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times">When the pasta is just done, drain it,
    and mix with chilled sauce. Serve immediately.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times">This next recipe is another favorite
    although my mother always used croutons or just tore the
    stale bread slices into small pieces. The cooking aroma still
    reminds me of fresh trout. Of course I especially like this
    served with fish and cornbread.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4" face="Times"><strong><u>Basil Stewed
    Tomatoes</u></strong><strong> Serves 4-6</strong></font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times">1 medium onion, diced</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times">1 medium celery rib, diced</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times">2 T. olive oil</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times">2 pounds ripe tomatoes or a 28-
        ounce can of tomatoes</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times">8 lettuce-leaf or cinnamon basil
        leaves or 1/2 t. crumbled dry basil</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times">1/4 cup packed parsley leaves</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times">3 garlic cloves, minced</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times">2 t. honey</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times">1/4 t. cayenne pepper</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times">salt</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Times">1 cup coarse day-old whole grain
        bread crumbs</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times">Saut the onion and celery in the
    olive oil for about 8 minutes over medium heat. Cut the
    tomatoes into wedges, or coarsely chop canned tomatoes, and
    add them to the vegetables.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times">Coarsely chop the basil and parsley
    leaves and add to the tomatoes with the cayenne, garlic,
    honey, and salt to taste. Simmer uncovered for 20 minutes,
    then stir in the bread crumbs and simmer 5 minutes longer.
    Cover and let stand for 5 minutes. Serve in a heated serving
    dish.</font></p>

    <p>'Tis the season when remembering overcomes our thoughts
    and lavish meals fill the frig with leftovers. Though I
    prefer sunny lunches of garlic breadsticks dipped in a bowl
    of sauce straight from the Prego jar ( Diced Onion and
    Garlic's my favorite), there are days when I have to do more.
    After several weeks of decorating, baking and overeating a
    light fare seems appropriate. And it's usually around the
    holidays that the perfect solution to cleaning up the frig is
    a pot of soup and a batch of yeast bread. The aroma of fresh
    baked bread is heavenly. Plus it's especially nice if you're
    heading out of town on the typical seasonal visitations and
    can offer soup &amp; bread upon arrival at your destination. </p>
    <p>We all have our favorite holiday recipes. An old standard
    at our annual Christmas eve party was Mom's Goose Salad made
    with homemade salad dressing, capers, and seedless green
    grapes. Dad was a hunter and there was almost always a few
    geese in the freezer. Now without a goose for salad, I seem
    to have developed the habit of making certain cookies at
    Christmas and if I don't, nothing's quite right. Here's a few
    favorite recipes from my kitchen: </p>
    <h3><em>Bourbon Balls - (adults only) </em></h3>
    <p>2 C. vanilla wafers - Roll with pin, blend or process to
    powder fine consistency </p>
    <p>2 C. powdered 10x sugar </p>
    <p>2 C. nuts (English walnuts) chopped coarse </p>
    <p>3 T. cocoa </p>
    <p>3 T. white corn syrup, maple syrup or honey (each gives a
    different favor) </p>
    <p>1/2 C. Bourbon (sometimes 1/4 C. Bourbon, 1/4 C. Vodka
    with a shot of Kahlua for a mocha favor!) </p>
    <p>Mix well. Roll in additional powdered sugar- DO NOT BAKE! </p>
    <h3><em>Ginger Snaps - 10 dozen</em></h3>
    <p>3/4 C. margarine or butter 2 C. sugar </p>
    <p>2 beaten eggs 1/2 C. molasses </p>
    <p>2 t. vinegar 3 3/4 C. flour </p>
    <p>1 1/2 t. soda 2-3 T. ginger </p>
    <p>1 T. cinnamon 1/4 t. ground cloves </p>
    <p>2-3 dashes of black pepper</p>
    <p>Cream together butter and sugar. Add eggs, molasses and
    vinegar. Add dry ingredients. Roll into 1&quot; balls and
    bake about 12 minutes at 325. Do not over-bake, they'll get
    too snappy! </p>
    <h3><em>Homemade Salad Dressing </em></h3>
    <p>2 eggs 1 C. sugar </p>
    <p>2 T. cornstarch 2 T. dry mustard </p>
    <p>1/2 t. salt 1 C. vinegar </p>
    <p>1/4 stick butter or 2 T. oil</p>
    <p>Blend eggs and dry ingredients together. Add vinegar very
    slowly, stirring well with each small amount added. Add
    butter or oil and place over medium heat. Cook till thick and
    translucent stirring the entire time. Otherwise it will stick
    to bottom of sauce pan and get lumpy. When thoroughly cooked
    add an equal amount of mayonnaise. This recipe makes 1 pint
    and must be mixed with 1 pint of mayonnaise. Use for potato
    salad, macaroni salad, and Cole slaw. It's especially good in
    a salad made with fresh leaf lettuce, bacon, onions, and hard
    boiled eggs in the spring when the first new lettuce is
    picked. Or you can use any leafy soft lettuce from your local
    market. </p>

    size="4"><em><strong><i><br>
    by Donna Weeks</i></strong></em></font></h2>
    <p>Oh no !! It&#146;s almost winter and you are already
    longing for some fresh herbs from your garden. You don&#146;t
    have to wait until Spring to enjoy the taste and smell of
    fresh herbs. Why not make a living herbal wreath to keep you
    company this winter? It would also be the perfect gift for
    the gardener on your Christmas list. They are simple to make,
    require little care and will last for months. Living wreaths
    look especially nice as a centerpiece for the Holidays.</p>
    <p>Here are the supplies you will need: A wire wreath base, a
    large plastic container just a little larger than the base,
    (you can use those clear plastic saucers you put under your
    pots), some sphagnum or sheet moss and herbs of choice. Fill
    the metal base with moss being careful not to pack it in too
    tightly. You need to leave room to tuck in the herbs. When
    you gather your herbs, try to get some roots so they will get
    a better start. Thyme (especially creeping varieties),
    rosemary, germander, mint and oregano will grow very well in
    the sphagnum medium. Once you have gathered your herbs, press
    the stem ends or roots into the moss as firmly as you can.
    You can either wind the herbs around the wreath, or simple
    tuck them in as you proceed around the base. Use the smaller,
    more pliable herbs first and the larger leafed varieties
    last. They are good for tucking in and covering up any bare
    spots. Once you have the wreath to your satisfaction, fill
    the plastic saucer with water and set the wreath in it.
    You&#146;ll need to check the wreath after a few hours to see
    if it absorbing the water. If it appears too dry, let it sit
    another hour. Too wet, pour off the excess water. Your wreath
    will benefit from frequent mistings and a once-a-week root
    watering. Be sure to add some fertilizer to your water once a
    month as the sphagnum will not supply the needed nutrients
    for your plants. To decorate for the holidays simply place
    fresh flowers throughout the wreath, put a large candle in
    the center and you&#146;ve created a delightful unusual
    centerpiece. You might want to decorate a plain candle with
    some pressed herbs or flowers to add to the centerpiece. To
    apply pressed items, use tacky glue that you have watered
    down. Paint the glue on the candle, lay the pressed item on
    top and allow to dry. When thoroughly dry, apply a thin layer
    of water and glue to the herb or flower to seal.</p>
    <p>Keep an eye on your wreath over the winter months. You
    will need to prune back some of the herbs and replace those
    which don&#146;t adapt to their new environment. Enjoy your
    creation and Think Herbs!!!</p>

<title>Conifers: A Look At Garden Varieties</title>

<h1><font size="6" face="Arial Black">WHAT ARE </font><font
color="#008080" size="6" face="Arial Black">CONIFERS</font><font
size="6" face="Arial Black">? </font></h1>

<blockquote>
    <p>The name &quot;Conifer&quot; comes from Latin and means
    &quot;to bear cones.&quot; Although cones are a common
    feature with most conifers, junipers and yews are two
    exceptions with berry-like fruit. The best method of
    identifying a conifer is to look at the leaves. Conifers are
    mostly evergreen trees or shrubs with linear, needle-like or
    scale like leaves, though some such as Larch and Cypress drop
    their leaves in autumn. Among the Conifers are some of the
    smallest, largest, and oldest living woody plants known. The
    more than 500 Conifer species are distributed worldwide and
    are invaluable for their timber as well as being adaptable
    garden plants for year round interest. </p>
    <h3>GARDEN CONIFERS </h3>
    <p>The diversity of available conifers for the landscape is
    tremendous. Nurseries and plants people around the world are
    devoted to the discovery and introduction of new selections
    that vary in size, form, color, and texture. There has been
    special interest in the group of conifers classified as
    &quot;Dwarf Conifers.&quot; One definition of a Dwarf Conifer
    is one that for some reason fails to attain the size and
    stature of the parent plant. </p>
    <h3>CONIFER SIZES </h3>
    <p>From massive forest giants to minuscule mounds of elegant
    foliage, the appropriate size will depend on the landscape
    situation. The typical landscape today is limited in space,
    making size an important issue when choosing plants. The
    American Conifer Society has adopted, as a relative guide,
    the following four size categories for conifers.* </p>
    <p><u>Category Growth/year at 10-15 years <br>
    </u>Miniature &lt;3&quot; 2-3' <br>
    Dwarf 3-6&quot; 3-6' <br>
    Intermediate 6-12&quot; 6-15' <br>
    Large 12 + 15 +</p>
    <p><i>* Size may vary due to cultural, climatic and regional
    factors.</i> </p>
    <h3>CONIFER FORMS </h3>
    <p>The form most commonly associated with conifers is the
    familiar conical shape of Christmas trees, yet for the
    landscape, the range varies from the vertical form of tall
    columnar plants to the horizontal form of flat ground covers.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Globose: </b>globe-like or rounded in general
            outline. </li>
        <li><b>Pendulous: </b>upright or mounding with varying
            degrees of weeping branches. </li>
        <li><b>Narrow Upright: </b>much taller than broad.
            Includes plants referred to as fastigiate, columnar,
            narrowly pyramidal or narrowly conical. </li>
        <li><b>Broad Upright: </b>includes all other upright
            plants which do not fit into categories 1-3. </li>
        <li><b>Prostrate: </b>ground-hugging, carpeting plants -
            without an inclination to grow upward. </li>
        <li><b>Spreading: </b>wider than tall,. </li>
        <li><b>Irregular: </b>erratic growth pattern. </li>
        <li><b>Culturally Altered: </b>pruned or trained into
            formal or imaginative shapes. High grafts and
            standards. </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>CONIFER COLOR </h3>
    <p>Garden conifers come in a rainbow of year round colors
    that can be used effectively with companion plants. Many are
    shades of green, yellow, orange, blue, lavender, or purple,
    while others are bicolor and have variegated foliage. with
    patterns of stripes, spots, and patches. Many go through
    seasonal color changes and provide interest in the winter
    landscape. In the spring lighter shades of new growth
    contrast against the darker older foliage. In some cases new
    growth is not just a lighter shade, but emerge as a bright
    yellow or red shade, but emerge as a bright yellow or red
    rivaling any floral display. Some even display two colors of
    needles. On others the cones and seed bearing fruits are
    brightly colored and decorative during certain seasons of the
    year. </p>
    <h3>HOW TO USE GARDEN CONIFERS </h3>
    <p>The landscape uses are limited only by the imagination.
    The strong silhouette of many compact, slow-growing conifers
    can accent a corner of a garden bed, frame a doorway, or add
    winter interest to perennial and annual flower beds. Use them
    in foundation plantings, borders or island beds with other
    shrubs. Plant a mixture of different conifers, blending the
    various textures, shapes and colors, for a unique
    low-maintenance landscape statement. Use large specimens for
    expensive lawns, or miniature specimens to view up close in
    containers, troughs, or rock gardens. Don't forget that
    conifers are also stalwart hedging and wind-break plants. </p>
    <h3>PRUNING EVERGREENS </h3>
    <p>It is easy to say that the natural growth pattern of a
    normal of dwarf evergreen is a large part of its charm. When
    its charm gets out of hand by getting too large for its
    assigned space than either the wrong plant was selected or
    the proper pruning was not maintained. At this point the
    choice is pruning, moving, or removal, often removal is
    easier. Some evergreens can be severely pruned and others
    cannot.. In any event severe pruning will destroy the natural
    charm, although some evergreens can recover over time. </p>
    <p><b>Easiest to control are Yews and Hemlocks</b>. Both have
    abundant buds on both old and new wood that develop in twigs
    when the cut is above. Thus, they can be sheared heavily and
    not permanently harmed, so they can be used as hedges. The
    leaves tolerate some shade so they grow on the inside of the
    plant and hence the plant can be made dense by shearing or
    pruning. Pruning just before new spring growth allows the
    pruning cuts to be covered with new growth very rapidly to
    get away from the &quot;just sheared look.&quot; </p>
    <p><b>Next easiest to control are the Firs, Cedars, Spruce,
    and Douglas Firs. </b>These have easily identified buds along
    the current season's growth and sometimes on the stem of the
    previous year's growth. Size can be controlled at any time
    pruning back to a bud. For a formal shape, they can be pruned
    or sheared when the current season's growth is soft. Their
    leaves are also somewhat shade tolerant so pruning or
    shearing has the potential for making a dense plant. </p>
    <p><b>More care must be taken with Pines. </b>When pruning
    Pines one must be aware of their lack of buds along the stem
    and that buds are only at the tip of current season's growth.
    Thus, pruning at most times of the year must be done
    carefully or shape will be lost. The time to prune Pines is
    in the spring. When growth is soft a candle can be cut or
    pinched before the needles are fully elongated, and buds will
    develop from needle fascicles below the cut. Spring pruning
    or &quot;candling&quot; will produce a compact plant. By
    careful early spring pruning, one could almost maintained the
    size forever. </p>
    <p><b>The group most difficult to prune and control their
    size are the Junipers, Arborvitae, and False cypress (</b><b><i>Chamaecyparis).</i></b>
    In this group, buds are present only where there are green
    leaves; a branch cut back to a non-leafy region will not form
    new foliage. Thus cutting or shearing to the brown inner part
    results in an unsightly scar that may not be covered for many
    years if ever. The naked or brown interior is the result of
    the fact that this groups foliage is intolerant for shade and
    therefore the interior leaves die. If they are sheared, it
    should be done with care and only when they are actively
    growing in the spring. This group of plants ends up being a
    thin &quot;shell&quot; of green growth over a zone of twigs
    and limbs with no leaves and no potential for development of
    buds. <u>Care must be taken not to open this thin
    &quot;shell&quot; during pruning.</u> </p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#0080C0"><font size="6"><strong><b>Writers
        Guidelines</b></strong></font></font></p>
        <p><b>Dig Magazine Online</b> is on the lookout for
        writers who can deliver quality content for our Home
        &amp; Garden Diversions web site. Some of these articles
        may also appear in our regional print versions (currently
        available in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S.) </p>
        <h3>Editorial Direction: </h3>
        <p>Our take on the <b>Home &amp; Garden</b> concept is a
        bit different than the norm, focusing not only on what
        the home owner does <a href="outside.htm"><b>Outside</b></a>
        (<i>gardening, landscape design, leisure activities, bird
        watching, etc</i>.), but what we do <a href="inside.htm"><b>Inside</b></a>
        (<i>cooking, videos, music, books, the Internet, and more</i>).
        </p>
        <p>To enhance the global appeal of Dig Magazine Online,
        we need your input. We are looking for 500 - 1200 words.
        We're also happy to receive copies of relevant state and
        county issued documents that can be reprinted. </p>
        <h3>Compensation </h3>
        <p>At this stage, we are unable to offer payment for
        material. However, we do offer regular contributors (<i>3
        accepted articles in a 6 month period</i>) their own
        personal web site (<i>non-domain</i>), with up to 1mb of
        server space. You can use this space to advertise your
        work, publications, etc. Your personal web site must meet
        the current style guide of Dig Magazine Online.</p>
        <p>For your web site, all text (<i>rtf and word files
        only</i>) and graphics (gif and jpeg only) must be
        supplied via land mail or e-mail (<i>as an attachment</i>).
        InSync Design &amp; Publishing will not key in any text,
        nor design any graphics. We will however convert your
        supplied electronic files to HTML, in keeping with the
        look and feel of Dig Magazine. </p>
        <p><b>InSync Design &amp; Publishing reserves the right
        not to publish any material we deem offensive</b>. </p>
        <p>If you are unable to meet the above requirements, we
        can design and layout your web site through INSYNCnet. </p>
        <h3>Format </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sent as MS Word, RTF, or ASCII text on 3  PC or
                Mac disks </li>
            <li>Please provide endnotes, and not footnotes at the
                bottom of each page, if references are necessary.
            </li>
            <li>Include a brief one or two sentence bio statement
                with your text, and any title suggestions you may
                have. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How to Submit </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>E-mailed to us (<a
                href="mailto:info@digmagazine.com">info@digmagazine.com</a>)
                as an attachment </li>

        <td><font color="#0080C0" face="Arial">Referred to by his
        colleagues as &quot;Mr. Dig Magazine&quot;, Paul is in
        fact, &quot;Mr. Dig Magazine&quot;. If you like Dig
        Magazine, you might like Paul. If you don't like Dig
        Magazine, you probably wouldn't like Paul (to be honest,
        either way, you probably wouldn't like Paul). He's the
        one, who upon seeing the first blueline of the very first
        Dig, abruptly yelled out, &quot;<em>Where the Hell are
        the music reviews?</em>&quot; </font><p><font
        color="#0080C0" face="Arial">Nobody told him that they
        didn't belong in a home and garden magazine.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0080C0" face="Arial">Paul started Dig
        Magazine in a dark, damp basement, lit by a single black
        light and surrounded by PC's, Macs, 17 inch Monitors,
        Scanners, Wacom Tablets, Camcorders, Sequencers, Racks of
        Midi Equipment, DAT machines, 17 inch Monitors, Baseball
        Trophies, Microwaves, Coffee Beans, Coffee Grinders,
        Coffee Cups, Fax Machines, Wireless Phones, Speakers, 17
        inch Monitors, Mixers, Microphones, Floppies, CD's, 33 <sup>1/3's</sup>,
        45's, and Ibuprofen. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0080C0" face="Arial">He gave copies of
        Dig away for free on street corners (inspired by the Joni
        Mitchell song), even going so far as to design and insert
        by hand, a huge grayscale chart, depicting the
        relationship between rakes and sampling rates. People
        wondered why it cost so much. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#0080C0" face="Arial">Somewhat injured,
        and increasingly bitchy, he turned to the web, muttering
        something about human beings, and their inability to
        merge.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0080C0" face="Arial">He is,
        unfortunately, not a gardener. He hasn't figured them out
        yet, nor does he intend to. He was however happy, when
        the Cuban refugees finally found out how to power a boat
        with a Weed Whacker. His wife </font><a

        face="Arial">Sherry</font></a><font color="#0080C0"
        face="Arial">, fortunately, is a gardener. Her presence
        has, on more than one occasion, helped prevent their boat
        from flipping over completely.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0080C0" face="Arial">He's been known to
        play his trusty Gibson Melody Maker up-side down, loves
        to argue the Mac vs. Win95 issue (he uses both, but upon
        noticing the increasing similarity between Mac owners and
        Amiga Owners, prefers Chairman Bill's vision of the
        future), and he still has a penchant for Nat Sherman's
        Virginia Circles (<em>brown/non-filtered</em>).</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0080C0" face="Arial">We're not so sure
        it's a good idea to send email to </font><a

        face="Arial">pk@insyncnet.com</font></a><font

<h2><a name="topics"><font size=4>TOPICS</font></a></h2>
<h3><font color="#004080"><font size=4>Select a Topic </font></font></h3>
<p>On most boards you as a casual user will only be able to select a topic. To do this browse through the list of topics and find one which 
interests you. The topic is a base declaration of the content within but does not limit it. To chose a topic simply click on the Link that 
interests you.<font size=4> </font></p>
<h3><font color="#004080"><font size=4>Add a new Topic </font></font></h3>
<p>To add a new topic most of the time you will need to be the board administrator and have the validation password. If it is a free for all 
board then anyone can create a new topic. To do this you click on the Add Topic button located at the top and bottom of the topic list 
page. This will present you with a form to fill out. There will be a password entry if the board is controlled by the system administrator. If 
this is the case and you would like to have a topic added E-mail the admin. with your suggestion. If there is no password entry then it is a 
free for all board. To add a topic simply give it a name which is a short description of the topic. Enter a more complete explanation of the 
topic contents in the Topic Description space. Then try and select a descriptive directory to create for the topic and its messages. If you 
select one which has already been used simply click back on your browser and try another. Once the topic has been created you will be 
automatically returned back to the topic list page. </p>
<h2><a name="forum"><font color="#004080"><font size=4>Forum Board </font></font></a></h2>
<p>On the main topic page you should be displayed a list of messages already posted. To view any of these posts simply click on the link. If 
there are no messages listed on the page then it is a new topic and no messages have been posted yet, or the system administrator has 
removed all of the previous messages. To make a new post you must click on the New Post button. This will display you with a fill out 
form. On this form you need to enter your E-mail address, name or a nickname, your message which can be as long as you want. The 
message will automatically wrap if you are using Netscape 2.0 or better. If not you will have to hit return from time to time otherwise your 
message might look funny. You must also enter a Subject. This is the content of your post very similar to an E-mail or newsgroup Subject. 
This is only necessary on a new post. The Subject will be carried over on all replies. The URL section is optional. If you enter a URL in 
this section your name will be a click to view it link in the final message. This is good if you wish to link your web page to your message. 
Hypertext markup entered in the message section will be stripped. </p>
<h2><a name="reply"><font color="#004080"><font size=4>Reply Posts </font></font></a></h2>
<p>When you are viewing a posted message you will see a reply to this message button. Clicking on this will pop up a fill out form which will 
enable you to reply to the original post. You will not be able to change the original subject but you may change or remove the original 
message which will be popped up in your message window. To remove it simply highlight it and hit your delete key. This will remove it and 
leave you a blank window for your message. </p>
<p>You will also notice that there is a follow up section. When viewing this section there will either be an open folder, a closed folder, or 
nothing. If there is nothing then there is no replies to this message. If there is an open folder then there are multiple replies to this message. 
i.e. this message has a reply and the reply also has a reply and maybe even more.. A closed folder represents a reply to this message which 
has no replies itself. Clicking on these links will allow you to iew the replies. If there is nothing in this section then this message is the end of 
the thread. </p>

        <td width="100%"><font color="#FFFFFF">Christopher Null
        is a long-established writer and media critic based in
        Austin, Texas. He was first published at the age of 11,
        completed his first novel at the age 19, and his first
        screenplay, Fringe, at 23. Chris has also written 2 other
        novels and just completed September Drift, his second
        full-length screenplay. In addition to writing, Null Set
        Productions (the film production company he began with
        his brother) produced its first offering, a live-action
        short film entitled Pressurecooker, this August. The
        company hopes to begin shooting Fringe in early 1997.</font><p><font
        color="#FFFFFF">Now 25, Chris has been covering the world
        of film and the cinema for almost 3 years. He is
        internationally syndicated as a writer (now in 5
        countries and 4 different languages) and is also
        Contributing Editor for Film for Mike's Feedback
        magazine, an Austin, Texas monthly. Now, Chris's reviews
        and articles reach over 850,000 readers (that's four
        times the readership of Austin's daily newspaper). In
        fact, the world-renowned Roger Ebert quoted Chris in his
        review of Emma, although he didn't bother with an
        acknowledgment of the source.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">When he's not writing,
        moviegoing, or putting together film productions, Chris
        serves as COO for an Austin software company--Genius
        Technologies. He recently earned his Master of Business
        Administration at The University of Texas at Austin,
        where he received the Sord Scholar Award and the Dean's
        Award for academic merit.</font> </p>

        Heriteau is the author of 35 books on gardening and
        cooking&#151;many of them book club offerings&#151;and a
        journalist. She is the daughter of an award-winning
        French chef, a co-founder of the Escoffier Society in
        Montreal, Canada. </font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">In
        recognition of her contribution to the literature of
        gardening, in 1990 she was awarded the American
        Association of Nurserymen's Communicator of the Year
        Award. In 1992 she was one of the Distinguished Lecturers
        chosen by the American Horticultural Society to address
        Ameriflora, the international flower show held in
        Columbus, Ohio. She sits on the Directors of the Garden
        Writer's Association of America. And is chair of their
        Plant a Row for the Hungry Campaign. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Heriteau's three major books
        identify pest and disease resistant ornamentals that
        withstand environmental pollution, and they indicate
        which plants to use where: <b>The National Arboretum's
        Book of Outstanding Plants</b> (Simon &amp; Schuster,
        1990), <b>The American Horticultural Society Flower
        Finder</b>, (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1992) and <b>Water
        Gardens with Charles Thomas</b>, President of Lilypons
        Water Gardens (Houghton Mifflin, Spring 1994). </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Feast of Flowers</b>
        (Houghton Mifflin, 1993) a gift book of personal
        reminiscences illustrated with watercolors by
        artist/muralist Susan Davis, was followed in 1995 by<b>
        The Birthday Book of Fragrant Flowers.</b> </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Heriteau was the general Editor
        of the 16-volume The Good Housekeeping Illustrated
        Encyclopedia of Gardening; has been horticultural
        consultant for House and Garden Garden Guides and Family
        Circle Magazine; has contributed to Good Housekeeping
        Magazine, Voque, Harper's Bazaar, The World &amp; I,
        American Horticulturist, Southern Accents, The New York
        Times, and the Christian Science Monitor, </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Heriteau's column This Week in
        my Garden appears weekly in The Washington Times. The
        Times also publishes her bi-weekly column Dr. Cathey Says
        a Q &amp; A based on Marc Cathey's nationally syndicated
        weekly radio show. Cathey, for ten years the Director of
        the US National Arboretum, is now President and CEO of

                or just the world's fastest writer? With perfect
                timing, Michael Crichton, author of the
                blockbusters <strong>The Andromeda Strain</strong>,
                <strong>Disclosure</strong> and <strong>Rising
                Sun</strong>, delivers a bang-up thriller that
                does for jumbo jets what <strong>Jurassic Park</strong>
                did for T-rex. <br>
                <br>
                Cruising 35,000 feet above the earth, a
                twin-engine commercial jet encounters an accident
                that leaves 3 dead, 56 wounded, and the cabin
                ashambles. What happened? With a
                multibillion-dollar, company-saving deal on the
                line, Casey Singleton leads a team of crack
                engineers to uncover the mysterious circumstances
                that led to the disaster before more people die.
                But someone doesn't want her to find the truth. <br>
                <br>
                It's obvious that Crichton has done his research.
                Airframe bristles with authentic information,
                technical jargon, and the command of detail
                Crichton's readers have come to expect. We learn
                not only why jets fly, but the complexities of
                the systems that keep them aloft and, of course,
                the chilling sequence of errors that can send
                them plummeting. Combine that with nail-biting
                suspense, and you may decide to cash in your
                frequent flyer miles. <br>

                        face="Verdana">Daniel Greene was the duty
                        officer at the FAA Flight Standards
                        District Office on Imperial Highway, half
                        a mile from LAX. The local FSDOs--or
                        Fizdos, as they were called--supervised
                        the flight operations of commercial
                        carriers, checking everything from
                        aircraft maintenance to pilot training.
                        Greene had come in early to clear the
                        paper off his desk; his secretary had
                        quit the week before, and the office
                        manager refused to replace her, citing
                        orders from Washington to absorb
                        attrition. So now Greene went to work,
                        muttering. Congress was slashing the FAA
                        budget, telling them to do more with
                        less, pretending the problem was
                        productivity and not workload. But
                        passenger traffic was up four percent a
                        year, and the commercial fleet wasn't
                        getting younger. The combination made for
                        a lot more work on the ground. Of course,
                        the FSDOs weren't the only ones who were
                        strapped. Even the NTSB was broke; the
                        Safety Board only got a million dollars a
                        year for aircraft accidents, and--<br>
                        <br>
                        The red phone on his desk rang, the
                        emergency line. He picked it up; it was a
                        woman at traffic control.<br>
                        <br>
                        &quot;We've just been informed of an
                        incident on an inbound foreign
                        carrier,&quot; she said.<br>
                        <br>
                        &quot;Uh-huh.&quot; Greene reached for a
                        notepad. &quot;Incident&quot; had a
                        specific meaning to the FAA, referring to
                        the lower category of flight problems
                        that carriers were required to report.
                        &quot;Accidents&quot; involved deaths or
                        structural damage to the aircraft and
                        were always serious, but with incidents,
                        you never knew. &quot;Go ahead.&quot;<br>
                        <br>
                        &quot;It's TransPacific Flight 545,
                        incoming from Hong Kong to Denver.
                        Pilot's requested emergency landing at
                        LAX. Says they encountered turbulence
                        during flight.&quot;<br>
                        <br>
                        &quot;Is the plane airworthy?&quot;<br>
                        <br>
                        &quot;They say it is,&quot; Levine said.
                        &quot;They've got injuries, and they've
                        requested forty ambulances.&quot;<br>
                        <br>
                        &quot;Forty?&quot;<br>
                        <br>
                        &quot;They've also got two stiffs.&quot;<br>
                        <br>
                        &quot;Great.&quot; Greene got up from his
                        desk. &quot;When's it due in?&quot;<br>
                        <br>
                        &quot;Eighteen minutes.&quot;<br>
                        <br>
                        &quot;Eighteen minutes--Jeez, why am I
                        getting this so late?&quot;<br>
                        <br>
                        &quot;Hey, the captain just told us,
                        we're telling you. I've notified EMS and
                        alerted the fire crews.&quot;<br>
                        <br>
                        &quot;Fire crews? I thought you said the
                        plane's okay.&quot;<br>
                        <br>
                        &quot;Who knows?&quot; the woman said.
                        &quot;The pilot is not making much sense.
                        Sounds like he might be in shock. We hand
                        off to the tower in seven minutes.&quot;<br>
                        <br>
                        &quot;Okay,&quot; Greene said. &quot;I'm
                        on my way.&quot;<br>
                        <br>
                        He grabbed his badge and his cell phone
                        and went out the door. As he passed
                        Karen, the receptionist, he said,
                        &quot;Have we got anybody at the
                        international terminal?&quot;<br>
                        <br>
                        &quot;Kevin's there.&quot;<br>
                        <br>
                        &quot;Beep him,&quot; Greene said.
                        &quot;Tell him to get on TPA 545, inbound
                        Hong Kong, landing in fifteen. Tell him
                        to stay at the gate--and don't let the
                        flight crew leave.&quot;<br>
                        <br>
                        &quot;Got it,&quot; she said, reaching
                        for the phone.<br>
                        <br>
                        Greene roared down Sepulveda Boulevard
                        toward the airport. Just before the
                        highway ran beneath the runway, he looked
                        up and saw the big TransPacific Airlines
                        widebody, identifiable by its bright
                        yellow tail insignia, taxiing toward the
                        gate. TransPacific was a Hong Kong-based
                        charter carrier. Most of the problems the
                        FAA had with foreign airlines occurred
                        with charters. Many were low-budget
                        operators that didn't match the rigorous
                        safety standards of the scheduled
                        carriers. But TransPacific had an
                        excellent reputation.<br>
                        <br>
                        At least the bird was on the ground,
                        Greene thought. And he couldn't see any
                        structural damage to the widebody. The
                        plane was an N-22, built by Norton
                        Aircraft in Burbank. The plane had been
                        in revenue service five years, with an
                        enviable dispatch and safety record.<br>
                        <br>
                        Greene stepped on the gas and rushed into
                        the tunnel, passing beneath the giant
                        aircraft.<br>
                        <br>
                        He sprinted through the international
                        building. Through the windows, he saw the
                        TransPacific jet pulled up to the gate,
                        and the ambulances lined up on the
                        concrete below. The first of them was
                        already driving out, its siren whining.<br>
                        <br>
                        Greene came to the gate, flashed his
                        badge, and ran down the ramp. Passengers
                        were disembarking, pale and frightened.
                        Many limped, their clothes torn and
                        bloody. On each side of the ramp,
                        paramedics clustered around the injured.<br>
                        <br>
                        As he neared the plane, the nauseating
                        odor of vomit grew stronger. A frightened
                        TransPac stewardess pushed him back at
                        the door, chattering at him rapidly in
                        Chinese. He showed her his badge and
                        said, &quot;FAA! Official business!
                        FAA!&quot; The stewardess stepped back,
                        and Greene slid past a mother clutching
                        an infant and stepped into the plane.<br>
                        <br>
                        He looked at the interior, and stopped.
                        &quot;Oh my God,&quot; he said softly.
                        &quot;What happened to this plane?&quot;</font></p>

            height="14"><font color="#FFFFFF">Now I understand
            why Argentineans wanted Madonna to go home during the
            filming of EVITA!</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">What the fuss is all about,
            I have no idea, because EVITA is just another bad
            movie starring one of our worst actresses, Madonna.
            The catch is, this time she gets to sing sing sing
            for 2 1/2 hours -- sing until she can sing no more --
            sing until your ears bleed.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">EVITA has had a long and
            sordid past as a motion picture project, and it's
            easy to see why. The fact that EVITA makes a mockery
            of Argentina's most beloved personage *and* the
            filmmakers wanted to shoot there is almost beside the
            point. There's the problem that movie musicals have
            tended to be huge flops over the last 40 years; the
            problem of Madonna's inability to act; the problem
            that Eva Peron was basically an egomaniac that died
            40 years ago and that no one in America really cares
            about anymore. And when co-screenwriter Oliver Stone
            gets involved... yikes! They might as well have made
            a musical called OSWALD!</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">But they didn't. Instead,
            EVITA rumbles through the plot points in Eva Peron's
            life like a freight train. From stargazing child to
            slutty gold-digger to talentless actress to the wife
            of the President, it's no wonder why Madonna fought
            so hard for this part -- it's straight out of her
            life (except for the President part... so far)! No
            acting required! *And* she gets to sing the whole
            time!</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">And what's with all this
            singing, anyway? Yes, I know it's from Andrew Lloyd
            Webber (who, after seeing &quot;Cats,&quot; I believe
            is seriously disturbed), and as a traditional
            musical, EVITA might have had a prayer. But electric
            guitars and synthesizers? Discordant,
            headache-inducing chants? A capella, sing-song
            dialogue between characters? Sheesh, EVITA is more
            like THE WHO'S TOMMY than SINGIN' IN THE RAIN. (It's
            no surprise that director Alan Parker also created
            PINK FLOYD'S THE WALL.) I half-expected Madonna to
            start rolling around in baked beans a la Ann-Margret!</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">No such luck. Instead we
            have to listen to the likes of Antonio Banderas's
            singing narrator, which sounds a lot like he has his
            cajones in a vise. Or the very British Jonathan Pryce
            as Juan Peron (!), singing about how he ran the
            British out of Argentina. The hilarity of these two
            performing is *almost* as much fun as the real treat
            of EVITA: trying to see how many ways Madonna can
            cover up her blossoming pregnancy. How many arms,
            hats, and flower bouquets can she hold across her
            waist? A lot.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">In all fairness, Banderas is
            a diamond in the rough here, in a part of comic
            relief that is desperately needed among the Very
            Serious performances. Also, a few of the songs are
            tolerable, even memorable, even if they rarely make
            sense. But, in the end, I have to pan EVITA, if for
            no other reason than it's just plain goofy. And some
            parting words for Madonna, in a lyrical fashion she
            may be able to finally understand:</font></p>

            src="../graphics/film/stars3h.gif" width="61"
            height="14"> The issue of whether Thomas Pallotta and
            Jack Meredith are twisted sons of bitches is not up
            for debate. A better point of contention is, are they
            geniuses, and what happens to them next?</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">After seeing their ultra-low
            budget production of THE HIGH ROAD, a drug- and
            booze-infused trip around the state of Texas, I'm
            almost unable to comment. What might be described as
            EASY RIDER meets DRUGSTORE COWBOY, the movie is
            certainly a success in terms of experimental
            filmmaking, and it definitely has the potential of
            becoming a cult classic on the midnight circuit.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">While following go-nowhere
            (and I *mean* it) twentysomethings on an
            inspired-by-nothing journey is nothing new,
            Pallotta's camera direction and eye for locations is
            more reminiscent of David Lynch than Dennis Hopper.
            Making the most of almost no money (how they got such
            a fantastic score is beyond me), Pallotta proves that
            his directorial style is a force to be reckoned with,
            should the Money Men come knocking.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Although the road movie has
            seen a resurgence of late, what sets THE HIGH ROAD
            apart from recent klunkers like THE DOOM GENERATION
            is the deadpan goofiness with which Pallotta and
            company have infused the film. Full of sex, drug, and
            alcohol clichs, all delivered in monotone by the
            cast of amateurs, the movie is one long running joke
            about being high, yet in some bizarre way manages to
            be as anti-drug as anything I've ever seen.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">With production values at
            the low end of low-budget, much of the film's sound
            is drowned out by room/car tone and tape hiss. It's
            unfortunate, even if it is expected. The performances
            from the four leads are all, oddly, exactly the same,
            due to what Pallotta refers to as &quot;the
            hyperrealism of the Huston/Bunuel approach.&quot; I'm
            not sure if I know what that means, and I'm not even
            sure if I spelled &quot;hyperrealism&quot; right,
            either... but, as with most experiments, sometimes it
            works, and sometimes it doesn't.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Thankfully, THE HIGH ROAD
            works more often than not, and any fan of the genre
            will definitely be entertained.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">THE HIGH ROAD opens at the
            Dobie Theater in Austin on January 17. </font></p>

            height="14"> <font color="#FFFFFF">In Hollywood, you
            just can't make a movie like SHINE. Put simply, it is
            just not allowed.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">This is our loss and
            Australia's gain, because SHINE comes off as one of
            the upper-echelon films of the year, an ambitious and
            unflinching look at that country's David Helfgott, a
            prodigy of a pianist driven insane by his father,
            only to emerge again after 20 years of
            institutionalization.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The film tracks David's
            tumultuous life from young boy (Alex Rafalowicz) to
            young man (FLIRTING's Noah Taylor) to adulthood
            (Australian stage actor Geoffrey Rush). David's
            father Peter (Armin Mueller-Stahl) pushes young David
            so hard (his motto: &quot;Win! Win! Win!&quot;) that
            his mind slowly crumbles before our very eyes. And
            while Peter wants David to be The Best, he doesn't
            want him away from home, and his overprotectionism,
            combined with Peter's insistence that David master
            Rachmaninoff's 3rd Piano Concerto (the &quot;Rach
            3,&quot; considered one of the most difficult piano
            pieces ever written), eventually drives David over
            the edge.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Extremely compelling for a
            film that is essentially a character study of one
            man, SHINE succeeds by leaving out no detail and by
            masterfully using the camera to capture an inner
            turmoil that would be impossible for us to feel
            otherwise. Exquisite is the string of five-star
            performances by Rush, Taylor (a favorite of mine),
            Mueller-Stahl, and supporting players John Gielgud
            and Lynn Redgrave. Rush's frantic jabbering as the
            insane adult Helfgott so perfectly captures the mood
            that he deserves (and is receiving) serious notice.
            And let me not forget the music, which is
            awe-inspiring (especially the unbelievable Rach 3),
            and which makes you want to applaud after each piece
            is performed.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">SHINE isn't flawless, though
            -- the biggest problem is a *serious* defect in the
            sound quality, normally no big deal, but inexcusable
            in a film about music. The roundabout plot structure
            will not appeal to every filmgoer, and when the movie
            was over, I felt a bit cheated by the lack of a real
            ending. (Helfgott has returned to sanity and is
            allegedly going to play at the Oscars if SHINE is
            nominated -- an event that the film, as it stands,
            would never portend.)</font></p>

            everything. But maybe leaving the audience hungry for
            more was the whole idea.</font></p>

            <p><img src="../graphics/film/stars4.gif" width="61"
            height="14"> <font color="#FFFFFF">What a huge
            gamble, to make a movie about &quot;Hustler&quot;
            magazine founder and die-hard porn king Larry Flynt
            and his turbulent life.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Whether or not it's
            successful, the filmmakers deserve every bit of
            praise for having the guts to make a movie like this,
            especially in an age where Washington constantly
            cries foul over Hollywood's depiction's of sex and
            violence. And believe me, THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT
            has plenty of both.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Following Flynt's (Woody
            Harrelson) life from juvenile Kentucky moonshiner to
            Ohio strip joint owner to the multi-millionaire ruler
            of a publishing empire, the film lays out the facts
            and doesn't make any judgments. Instead, we are
            invited to decide for ourselves, as the movie turns
            around Flynt's almost perpetual run-ins with the law,
            with anti-porn crusaders like Jerry Falwell and
            Charles Keating, and folds in Flynt's loving (and
            kinda sick) relationship with his wife Althea
            (Courtney Love).</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The biggest surprise in
            FLYNT is a five-star performance by Harrelson. After
            a series of idiotic movies like INDECENT PROPOSAL and
            MONEY TRAIN, who knew there was an actual *actor*
            under there? Edward Norton also redeems himself from
            the boneheaded PRIMAL FEAR, playing Flynt's
            long-suffering attorney Isaacman. Again, another
            pleasant surprise.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">But what truly baffles me is
            how Harrelson's finest hour is being overshadowed in
            the press by the performance of Courtney Love, who is
            undoubtedly one of the worst actresses I've ever
            seen, even in a role that was custom-made for her
            meager talents. That Love is perfectly credible as a
            stripper/drug addict is no surprise; it's her
            credibility as an actress (i.e. when she opens her
            mouth) that is more difficult to swallow, and it is
            her laughable performance that almost manages to
            topple FLYNT from greatness. I can only assume that
            people are confusing acting ability with a good
            makeup job.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">LARRY FLYNT is not
            particularly well-written, glossing over a ton of
            details, often favoring shock value to storytelling.
            Considering this is the life of Larry Flynt, you
            can't really fault the writers for this, but the
            linear plot progression often feels incidental to the
            rest of the picture. Still, Flynt's story is
            compelling enough to provide its own momentum, and
            with Milos Forman (AMADEUS) behind the camera, it
            does.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">As to whether Flynt is a
            crusader for freedom or the Anti-Christ, you'll have
            to draw your own conclusion. In the meantime, here's
            something to think about: Why is the movie called THE
            PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT when the big case in the film
            is Flynt vs. Falwell? Discuss amongst yourselves.</font></p>

    <p><font size="5"><strong>Well, </strong><strong><i>yes</i></strong><strong>.
    </strong></font>This <i>is</i> a piece about an
    adult-oriented animated series dropped smack-dab into the
    middle of your favorite horticultural publication and
    website. And this being the case, I realize that some of you
    out there may be--er--<i>confused</i>. Or, as the publisher
    of this esteemed magazine said so succinctly: &quot;My <i>god</i>,
    man! Have you lost your <i>senses</i>!? I'm <i>ruined</i>!&quot;
    He actually said a good deal more, but most of it was drowned
    out by the inconsolable weeping of his editor in chief (one
    of the reasons that I spend the extra money for the <i>water-proof</i>
    toner powder for my laser printer). </p>
    <p>Being extremely focused, a bastion of journalistic
    integrity, and with nothing else to offer him, I ignored his
    doubts. I brushed aside his concerns and his hands (which
    were crushing my lapels) with a sage look and an arched
    eyebrow. &quot;<i>Trust</i> me,&quot; I smiled, sounding as
    if I were giving out free apple samples in Eden. &quot;The
    readers will <i>understand</i>,&quot; I purred, &quot;You'd
    have to get up pretty <i>early</i> in the morning to lose <i>them</i>
    in a tight curve of logic.&quot; </p>
    <p>He thought about this for a moment and seemed to cheer
    up--even letting go of my lapels. &quot;Yes, of course!&quot;
    he shouted. &quot;You're right, Sheridan! What was I <i>thinking</i>?
    After all we do have the <i>hippest</i> readership in the
    country.&quot; And with that he told the editor in chief to
    stop her annoying hyperventilating sobs. </p>
    <p>And that was how it went down, over a week ago as I write
    this. But I must admit the episode left me a bit shaken--what
    if some of you out there didn't notice that<i> DIG</i> was
    broadening its coverage? What if you failed to realized that
    part of its new &quot;Diversion&quot; coverage focuses on the
    media--both new and traditional? What if my leap of faith and
    rationale--that while we should always question and analyze
    what the media is pumping into our living rooms; it is even
    more important to do so in a computer-assisted home-centric
    age--is not clear to you? What if you don't see, as I do,
    that as well-rounded individuals, we are shaped by all
    encounters with the Other Than--whether it takes the form of
    gardening and nature, art, or pop culture? </p>
    <p>But then I thought, <i>no</i>, the publisher was
    right--you <i>are</i> the hippest readership on the planet;
    we'll be just <i>fine</i>. And, uh, if you aren't--try to
    give me a heads-up, okay? I'd like to get at least a few
    states between me and the publisher if he happens to be
    displeased. Such a circumstance is one reason why all
    pundits, including myself, contribute heavily to the Writers'
    Protection Program. One assignment gone awry and you can be
    on the other side of the country writing about local sewer
    moratoriums under an assumed name. But let's <i>surprise</i>
    the publisher and not have me end up pounding a small town
    city beat under the name Symthe--<i>alright</i>? </p>
    <p>Good. Well, then <i>that's</i> settled. . . </p>
    <h4><font face="Arial">About the website version</font></h4>
    <p>As magazines migrate onto the Web, they are beginning to
    understand that their shiny new electronic, hypertext
    manifestation is not simply the ink-and-paper version on
    steroids. The Web and conventional printed pieces are two
    very different beasts. They make different demands on the
    reader, they have different strengths and weaknesses, and can
    achieve different ends. </p>
    <p>And so there is really no reason that the web and printed
    versions of an article need to be identical. Indeed, be wary
    of publications that merely &quot;repurpose&quot; their
    contents--they can and should be doing more to serve your
    informational needs. </p>
    <p>And so <i>this</i> on Flux piece is not <i>that</i> on
    Flux piece--the one you may have perused on the subway on
    your way home from work. On one hand, this version is able to
    linger and go deeper. On the other hand, it's electronic form
    allows you to more rapidly skim it, mining only the parts of
    it that are of interest to you. </p>
    <p>As the Web matures, and as publications and writers become
    more Web savvy, adjunct or supplementary versions of the same
    piece of reportage will proliferate. Look upon this as a
    first step... </p>

    <blockquote>
        <ol>
            <li>Periodically check for heaved plants in the
                garden. When the temperature rises to 60 degrees
                as it&#146;s done this January many plants heave
                and their roots become exposed. Push them down
                and maybe cover with mulch so they&#146;re less
                likely to thaw as often. Newly planted perennials
                tend to succumb to this and also root rot if left
                in water logged heavy clay for too long. A good
                reason to amend soil before planting. Winter wind
                can also dry those exposed roots and kill the
                plants.<br>
                </li>
            <li>Bulbs are peeking up and slow release fertilizer
                can be applied now which will feed them through
                their flowering stage and after to ensure
                nutrients are available for new growth cycle
                after flowering.<br>
                </li>
            <li>It&#146;s a great time to force various types of
                bulbs. Actually I uncovered a flat of about 50
                bulbs well on their way which I busied myself
                till dark trying to plant outside last Friday.
                Nature helped settle them in by dropping about
                1&quot; of rain the next day. Wonder if
                they&#146;ll bloom. Lessons learned tell me
                they&#146;ll probably bloom this season. Nature
                takes kindly consideration of gardeners with
                little time for rules and only an occasional
                chance to get dirty.<br>
                </li>
            <li>If you have ornamental grasses, February is a
                good time to cut back before any new growth
                begins. I always hate to trim just yet
                &#145;cause they&#146;re still such a nice golden
                color maybe wait till March or save some cuttings
                in a big basket in the house. When you&#146;ll
                ready cut to about 6 - 8 &quot; above the ground.<br>
                </li>
            <li>Prune back grapes and other vines. For specific
                information consult your cooperative extension
                service or get a resource guide from your
                library. Remember most garden centers and nursery
                personnel can give expert hands on advice.<br>
                </li>
            <li>Most shrubs and trees can be pruned while
                dormant. Do not cut maples as the syrup will run!
                Spring flowering woody shrubs and trees can be
                pruned judiciously sparing a few branches so
                you&#146;ll still get spring flowers. Sometimes
                the right is when you have time.<br>
                </li>
            <li>Starting seeds can be a late February project for
                those gardeners that want to get a hop on spring
                and have the space. Potatoes can be planted about
                1 month before the last freeze. Frost dates range
                from around March 26th to April 13th in this area
                we&#146;re right on the cusp of zones 6 &amp; 7.
                When trying to determine if the ground is ready
                to handle, please remember if it&#146;s too wet
                you can actually do damage to your soil. If your
                soil stays very wet for long periods and clumps
                together into hard rocks it is telling you to
                amend or consider raised beds. Poor drainage can
                kill a lot of perennials and rot bulbs. In the
                vegetable garden do not till wet soggy soil, wait
                till it dries out a little.</li>

    width="150" height="154"><font size="5"><em><strong><br>
    Everything's Coming Up Sunflowers</strong></em></font> </h2>
    <p> Everything's coming up sunflowers for 1996! They're
    everywhere! On hats, on skirts, scarves, shawls, and shirts,
    on greeting cards, postcards, and magazine covers. Even the
    posh twentieth anniversary edition of 'Pacific Horticulture',
    a prestigious little literary quarterly has given its cover
    to sunflowers. So it's not a great surprise to discover that
    the <b>National Garden Bureau</b> has named 1996 the 'Year of
    the Sunflower!' </p>
    <p>I can think of two good reasons for the grand surge in
    popularity of this sunny American native. Good reason one is
    that small varieties are being marketed that branch
    beautifully and produce dozens of charming small cutting
    flowers that have captured the imagination of gardeners and
    florists alike. However, you may love giant sunflowers, those
    straight-up, 'Jack-in-the-beanstalk' stems never did fit very
    comfortably into the typical flowering border. They usually
    have been grown in the kitchen garden. Many of the new
    varieties are charming in a the garden, and some have
    dazzling new colors. </p>
    <p>An example of the new form and a new color is the variety <b>'Floristan</b>',
    which was introduced in 1994. It's a fabulous bi-color whose
    petals are rusty red with yellow tips surrounding a dark
    central disk. The plant is just three feet tall and the
    branches about eighteen inches long. The flowers are six
    inches across, and ready for cutting just nine or ten weeks
    after the seed has been sown. </p>
    <p>The shortest, earliest, of the new breed sunflower is<b>
    'Big Smile' </b>which grows to 12 to 14 inches and produced
    flower in 50 to 60 days. The most adorable one I've seen
    photos of is <b>'Teddy Bear'</b>, a two-footed that produces
    six-inch fully double dwarf sunflowers. It's small enough to
    grow in a container. I searched the garden catalogs piled by
    my desk and found seed for it offered in the Thompson &amp;
    Morgan Inc. catalog. (Thompson &amp; Morgan Inc., PO Box
    1308, Jackson NJ 08527-0308.) There probably are others like
    it being marketed under different names. </p>
    <p>Two other new colors offered by the catalogs are <b>'Italian
    White,'</b> and <b>'Sunbeam.</b>' You'd grow these plants as
    cutting flowers rather than in a border. <b>'Italian White'</b>
    is not all that small, four feet at least, but it branches
    and produces a profusion of the four-inch flowers that are
    ivory white shading to an inner ring of gold, that surrounds
    a deep chocolate central disk. </p>
    <p><b>'Sunbeam'</b> is a beautiful flower with bright clear
    green eye ringed by a golden yellow petals. They're about
    five inches across, on six-foot plants that do not branch.
    Its great value to the florist trade, and to the home garden
    with a cutting garden, is that it is pollenless. Sunflowers
    produce a pollen that can be as difficult as lily pollen to
    get rid of. </p>
    <p>The new sunflowers wouldn't have become quite so popular
    if they weren't so gosh durn easy to grow. Sunflowers have
    been thriving here for eons, literally. According to the <b>National
    Garden Bureau</b>, sunflowers were grown as food plants on
    the Western Plains 5,000 years ago. The first breeders appear
    to have been the Ozark Bluff dwellers. They selected seed
    whose plants produced more seed than other sunflowers. The
    seeds were dried then ground into flour for bread making.
    They were also served with other vegetables. </p>
    <p>As early in our history as 1568 Spanish explorers decided
    the sunflower was something to write home about, which they
    did, and sent seeds. By 1616 the sunflower had become a
    popular ornamental in British gardens. Eventually they were
    being grown for the seeds all over Europe. The people who
    were most interested were the Russians. During Lent and
    Advent members of the Holy Orthodox Church of Russia were not
    allowed to use foods rich in oil. So the Russians bred very
    tall sunflowers with huge heads filled with seeds from which
    they extracted oil. Apparently eating foods cooked in
    sunflower oil did not break the Church laws. </p>
    <p>Sunflower collectors (there are more around than you
    suppose) used to go to great lengths to find and grow Russian
    seeds because they're the tallest sunflowers of all - eight
    and ten feet tall. Now the American seed catalogs sell a
    variety called <b>'Russian Giant' </b>which has been selected
    for size - eight and ten feet. Like marigolds, dandelions,
    black-eyed Susans, and (surprise!) lettuce, sunflowers belong
    to the Composite or daisy family. There's not a finicky plant
    in the bunch as long as there's plenty of direct sun. The
    fascinating thing about the giant sunflower is that you can
    almost see their great heads moving with the sun, which they
    do follow from East to West. The genus name, <b><i>Helianthus</i></b>,
    comes from two Greek words, helios, sun, and anthos, flower.
    Give a child a few seeds of 'Russian Giant' to plant; seeing
    those tiny seeds sprout giant plants with all the ease in the
    world is a consciousness-raising experience. Not only do they
    soar with no trouble at all, but they're also the original
    smiley face. </p>
    <p>In this <b>'Year of the Sunflower'</b>, try them yourself.
    Sow the seeds after all danger of frost has gone by, and the
    air is warming up a little. They will need five to ten days
    to germinate. If you grow sunflowers for the seed heads,
    expect to have a little tussle with the birds. When they
    start visiting, cover the head with cheesecloth. When the
    back of the flower is dry and brown, the seeds are ready to
    harvest. Remove the flower with one to two inches of stem,
    and hang it to cure in a warm dry place. When the seeds are
    completely dry, a brisk go at them with a stiff brush will
    encourage the seeds to fall out. Don't wash them. Store them
    in an air tight container in the refrigerator. </p>

    <h3><font size="5">Mid Winter Dreamin'</font><br>
    <font size="4"><i>by Sylvia Ehrhardt</i> </font></h3>
    <p>On a cold winter's day, with snow piled up, my thoughts
    turn toward spring and the coming garden season. This is the
    perfect time to start planning. It's time to draw those plans
    and dream about how great the garden will be. Even if I don't
    follow my plan to the letter, it is worth making. </p>
    <p>This imaginary garden is the picture of abundance. Crisp
    ruffled red and green lettuce is followed by slim snap beans,
    while beautiful large red tomatoes and squash gradually fill
    in the garden with healthy vines and fruit. My ideal garden
    is continuously productive. It starts early and lasts late. </p>
    <p>While a perfect garden will probably always lie just
    beyond reach, over a period of years small steady
    improvements can transform an ordinary plot into a highly
    productive one. Good gardens are built by a continuing
    process, one in which the gardener tries to remedy the
    mistakes of the past while looking to the future with new
    varieties and techniques. </p>
    <p>Garden planning, for most gardeners, begins first with
    ordering the seeds, then the garden is mapped, and finally
    the planting timetable is figured. </p>
    <p><b>Late winter is the time to take the first step -
    ordering seeds for what is hoped to be the best garden ever.</b>
    </p>
    <p>The seed catalogs start arriving in January, before I am
    really ready for them. These catalogs are very tempting with
    their beautiful pictures and description of fresh food. </p>
    <p>'Seed-catalog fever' is one of the in-jokes among
    gardeners. It is easy to get carried away - to order five
    kinds of zucchini for a family of two, more flowers than
    existing seed flats or planting space, or unusual vegetables
    or flowers that are unsuited for the climate. </p>
    <p>Overdoing the seed order is a harmless indulgence.
    Ordering seeds is a matter of practical necessity, but
    there's nothing wrong with making pleasure out of it. I like
    to treat myself by buying some of those unfamiliar vegetables
    and flowers. If I don't get them all planted this year, I can
    always plant them next year. Most vegetable seeds last at
    least one year. I always order more seeds than I can plant. <b>It
    is good to be well supplied with seeds just in case extra
    space becomes available sooner than planned.</b> </p>
    <p>I jot down all the different kinds of seeds I plant. Then
    I check my seeds saved from last year, and check off, from
    the list, all varieties for which I already have seeds. That
    leaves a list of seeds to be bought, usually from the many
    catalogs I consult. With the basic seeds taken care of, I
    order new varieties and new vegetables and flowers. </p>
    <p>When choosing between several varieties. I consider<b> </b><b><i>flavor,
    disease resistance, yield, hardiness, earliness,</i></b><b>
    and</b><b><i> growing habit</i></b><b> (bush or climbing).</b>
    </p>
    <p>Some qualities are more important for certain vegetables;
    for example, <b>disease resistance </b>is <i>crucial</i> in
    tomatoes and cucumbers;<b> earliness </b>is important in
    lettuce and peas; <b>growing habit</b> determines whether
    bush or climbing peas and beans are grown. </p>
    <p>I usually have a few <b>open-pollinated </b>vegetables
    seeds. If I want to, I can save seed from the plants for next
    year. It also is good to have extra radish seeds on hand.
    Radishes are not only good to eat, but if planted around
    squash and cucumber, will protect the plants from insect
    damage. </p>
    <p>There are certain terms you will need to know as you read
    the seed catalog. </p>
    <p>Here are some commonly used terms: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><b>All-America Selection</b>: A vegetable variety
        chosen in annual competition for its reliable performance
        in home gardens. </p>
        <p><b>Annual</b>: A plant that goes from seed to seed in
        one year. </p>
        <p><b>Biennial</b>: A plant that bears flowers and fruit
        or seed the first spring after overwintering and usually
        dies the following season. </p>
        <p><b>Gynoecious</b>: A plant that bears mostly female
        flowers. This plant may produce more fruit than a plant
        that has equal amounts of male and female flowers. </p>
        <p><b>Hybrid</b>: A plant grown from seed obtained by
        cross-fertilizing two different plant varieties. Seeds
        from this plant cannot be saved for next year. </p>
        <p><b>Days to Maturity</b>: The number after a variety
        indicates the average days until the vegetable is fully
        developed and ready for picking. For example, a catalog
        may say (55) or 55 days. </p>
        <p><b>Open-Pollinated</b>: A plant pollinated naturally
        without human intervention. Seeds from this plant can be
        saved for next year. </p>
        <p><b>Perennial</b>: A plant that survives the winter and
        bears flowers and fruit or seed each year for several
        years. </p>
        <p><b>Resistant</b>: Vegetables and fruits capable of
        withstanding disease or insect attack. </p>
        <p><b>Tolerant</b>: Plants often unaffected by disease or
        insect infestation. </p>
        <p><b>Untreated or treated seed</b>: Many corn, bean, and
        cabbage seeds are treated with fungicides, such as captan
        or thiram, to prevent rotting in the ground. If these
        fungicides touch your skin they can make you ill. Captan
        is suspected of being carcinogenic. I use only untreated
        seeds. If the catalog doesn't specify that the seeds are
        untreated, I write on the order -<b><i> untreated seeds
        only.</i></b> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b>Planning for a productive garden begins with the seed
    order.</b> </p>
    <p>Spinach, lettuce, and radishes provide the first fresh
    eating of the season. With an early start there will be time
    to raise another crop in the same row. It's also important to
    look ahead to fall and buy seeds for the crops you plan to
    grow then. The choice of varieties can affect the yield of
    your garden. </p>
    <p><b>Bush or pole varieties</b>? <i>Bush varieties</i> yield
    less than the vining kinds, but they do not stay in the
    ground as long making it possible for another crop to be
    planted in the row. I especially like <i>Sugar Ann Snap Peas</i>
    because it produces very early and can be followed by a crop
    of beans or corn. <i>Pole varieties</i> produce for a longer
    time than bush varieties, but they are slower to start
    bearing. My favorite is <i>Kentucky Blue Pole Beans</i>. </p>
    <p><b>Short thick carrots</b> will yield more on heavy soils.
    <i>Half-Long</i> or <i>Royal Chantenay are excellent choices.</i>
    </p>
    <p><b>Spinach</b> doesn't produce a lot for the space it
    takes, but it can be planted in early spring, early fall, as
    well as in the late fall. In the late fall, it will winter
    over and produce spinach the following spring. <i>Bloomsdale
    Long-Standing</i> can be used for all three plantings. </p>
    <p>Vegetables such as <b>tomatoes, peppers, carrots, and
    Swiss chard </b>produce a harvest for many months and are
    always a good investment. My favorites are: <i>Better Boy,
    Big Girl,</i> and <i>Sweet Chelsea</i> for tomatoes; <i>Park's
    Early</i> <i>Thickset for</i> green peppers, <i>Nantes
    Scarlet for</i> carrots, and <i>Swiss Chard of Geneva for</i>
    Swiss chard. </p>
    <p>When it is cold outside, a continuous harvest of fresh
    vegetables sounds awfully good. One way to make sure you have
    that harvest is to order your seeds promptly so that they
    will be on hand when the soil is ready to plant. </p>
    <p>Here are some catalogs that I like: </p>
    <p><b>Burpee </b>- 300 Park Avenue, Warminster, PA 18991 </p>
    <p><b>Nichols Garden Nursery</b> - 1190 North Pacific
    Highway, Albany, Oregon 97321 </p>
    <p><b>Park Seed</b> - Cokesbury Road, Greenwood, SC 29647 </p>
    <p><b>Shepherd's Garden Seeds</b> - 30 Irene Street,
    Torrington, Connecticut 06790 </p>
    <p><b>Southern Exposure Seed Exchange</b> - P.O. Box 170,
    Earlysville, VA 22936. <br>

    </h2>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Healthy plants are attractive furnishings in the home and
    office. However, maintaining healthy plants indoors can
    sometimes be difficult. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Plants used indoors have widely differing requirements for
    light, soil, temperature and water. Find out the requirements
    for each of your plants from reference books which discuss
    individual plants in detail. Many such books are available in
    public libraries. </p>
    <p>Some people enjoy caring for plants, while others do not
    want to fuss over them. If you do not enjoy plant care, it
    would be a good idea to simply discard declining plants and
    replace with fresh ones periodically. This is an especially
    good idea for many of the following plants that require
    special care to produce a second crop of flowers, (e.g.
    Cyclamen, Fuchsia, Browallia, Gloxinia, Poinsettia). If you
    enjoy the challenge of growing plants indoors, you will still
    need to use time and ingenuity to figure out what is causing
    problems when they occur. Following are eight common symptoms
    with possible causes and remedies. </p>
    <h4>Brown leaf tips, and/or leaf edges </h4>
    <p>Look for signs of salt accumulation in the soil, white or
    tan crusty material on soil surface, pot edges, and stems.
    Correct by re-potting in fresh soil or by watering thoroughly
    once each month. </p>
    <p>Very dry air, common indoors in the winter months, will
    cause tip browning. Grow plants together with the pots
    sitting on a bed of moist pebbles or spray with a fine mist
    daily. Better still, install a humidifier. </p>
    <p>Mechanical injury caused by brushing against the plants or
    chewing by insects or pets will cause browning in many
    plants. Ferns are especially sensitive to contact injury. </p>
    <p>Some plants that are pot-bound also develop brown leaf
    tips or lose older leaves. </p>
    <h4>Spots on leaves </h4>
    <p>Water-soaked spots, sometimes with a yellow halo, usually
    uniform in size, sometimes with a sticky ooze may be caused
    by bacteria. Fungi may also cause spots. Fungal leaf spots
    often have distinctive features such as a red ring around the
    spot; a concentric ring or target spot pattern; small black
    dots (fruiting bodies) in the dead tissue; cracks in the
    affected tissues with orange, black or tan ooze; a powdery,
    felt-like or fluffy growth on affected parts. If you suspect
    a bacterium or fungus is causing spots, remove and destroy
    severely affected plant parts, avoid splashing water on the
    foliage since this spreads the microorganisms causing the
    problem, and provide good air circulation. </p>
    <p>Many tropical plants develop spots on foliage that is old
    and ready to be dropped. This is normal. </p>
    <p>Pale washed out, white or gray spots, usually irregular in
    shape and size may be caused by too much light or heat. </p>
    <p>Brown corky spots or lumps can be caused by too much
    water, especially during cool, humid weather. This is
    especially common on peperomia, geranium and many succulents.
    </p>
    <h4>Leaves drop off </h4>
    <p>Many plants drop leaves when there is a sudden change in
    temperature, amount of light or humidity. Exposure to natural
    gas or manufactured gas may also cause leaves to drop. Some
    seasonal leaf drop is normal for plants, as new leaves are
    produced. Insect infestations and lack of water can also
    cause leaf drop. </p>
    <h4>Wilting </h4>
    <p>Wilting means that the plant is not able to replace the
    water lost by evaporation and transpiration. To determine the
    cause, you must examine the roots of the plant. </p>
    <p>Over-watering will cause the roots to die from lack of
    air. Look for wet, saturated soil caused by lack of drainage
    from the pot. Provide proper drainage and reduce watering. </p>
    <p>A pot-bound plant has filled its pot with roots which can
    often be seen growing out of the bottom of the pot. There
    isn't enough soil to hold the water for all those roots, so
    the plant wilts. Correct by re-potting in a larger pot. </p>
    <p>Fertilizer and minerals from hard water will accumulate in
    soil and cause root damage and wilting. The best solution is
    to re-pot in fresh soil. </p>
    <p>Fungal root rots will eventually cause a wilted top.
    Almost all healthy plant roots are pale in color and firm.
    Dead roots are brown to black and may be soft. Certain fungi
    cause root rots which are usually aggravated by too much
    water. If only a small amount of the roots have been
    affected, drenching the soil with fungicides may cure the
    disease. However, most indoor gardeners will find that these
    chemicals probably cost as much as a new plant. Good results
    are usually obtained by cutting dead roots and re-potting in
    clean soil. If most of the roots are dead, the plant should
    be discarded. </p>
    <p>Sometimes infection by root knot nematodes will result in
    wilting. Look for lumps and bumps on the root system.
    Infected plants and soil should be destroyed. If in doubt,
    submit a sample to your extension agent for confirmation. </p>
    <h4>Yellowing of the entire plant </h4>
    <p>Yellowing may result from too little light, too little
    fertilizer, insects or mites. Most often yellowing is a
    symptom caused by over-watering. As above, check for drainage
    in the pot, examine the roots and if most are dark, soft and
    dead, it is better to discard the plant. </p>
    <h4>Yellowing, browning, death of lower leaves, new growth
    looks OK </h4>
    <p>Yellowing and death of the lower leaves is generally
    caused by nitrogen deficiency. Pot-bound plants are
    especially susceptible. Regular application of fertilizer
    when the plant is growing vigorously and re-potting
    periodically in fresh soil avoids this problem. </p>
    <h4>Leaves are smaller, plants are tall and spindly </h4>
    <p>Too little light will cause plants to be pale, tall and
    weak. Consult a reference for light requirements for specific
    plants and ways to provide supplemental light indoors. </p>
    <h4>Sticky substance on leaves, sometimes accompanied by a
    black growth which can be washed off</h4>
    <p>Look for insects such as whiteflies, mealybugs, scales, or
    aphids. The black mold is called 'sooty mold.' It is growing
    on the sweet honeydew produced by the insects and is only
    secondary to the insect infestation, the the primary cause of
    the damage. </p>

    Repairing the Garden</strong></em></font></h2>
    <p>A heavy fall of snow; a sudden ice-storm; a heavy,
    rain-laden gale-Nature's powerful reminders of her
    might-often result in damage to the garden and landscaping
    plants. </p>
    <p>Dealing with storm damage takes three paths: <b>prevention,
    immediate aid, clean-up and repair.</b> </p>
    <h3>Preventing Winter Damage </h3>
    <p>Preventing winter damage begins with a thorough autumn
    cleanup. Burn diseased or insect-infested material and
    compost the rest. Give your trees and shrubs a clean-up
    pruning. Remove weak, broken, or crossed branches, cut back
    over-long canes, and prune overgrown shrubs and
    hedges-shaping them narrower at the top to shed snow loads.
    Be careful with spring-flowering shrubs-a hard barbering now
    will remove next season's flower buds. </p>
    <p>Spray broadleaf and young needle-leafed evergreens with
    water-soluble anti-desiccant, making sure the south and west
    sides get good coverage to prevent excessive moisture loss
    from drying winter winds and sunshine. </p>
    <p>Foundation plantings that may receive the weight of snow
    or ice falling from overhanging eaves should be covered with
    sturdy slatted frames or platforms, sloped to allow the
    accumulation to slide off. </p>
    <p>Evergreens in windy locations can be loosely but securely
    wrapped in burlap. </p>
    <p>Don't use plastic as a winter wrap: strong winter sunshine
    can build up enough heat to cook tightly wrapped plants.
    Upright forms like arborvitae should be bound gently with
    twine or soft rope to prevent their branches spreading apart
    and cracking under snow or ice loads. </p>
    <p>Roadside shrubs may need extra protection from road
    chemicals and salt spray; burlap splash shields or
    anti-desiccant sprays work well. </p>
    <p>Wrap the trunks of young trees to protect them from rodent
    damage and sunscald, which splits bark. Loosely wind strips
    of burlap or professional tree-wrap around the trunk from
    ground level to the lowest branches. </p>
    <p>Deciduous shrubs need little protection; those in exposed
    locations will benefit from a light spritz of anti-desiccant
    spray. Bind trailing canes on roses, bramble fruits, and
    grape vines to prevent them from whipping around in high
    winds, and mound up a little extra earth around the roots. </p>
    <p>Mulch perennials and bulb beds only after the ground
    freezes, to prevent frost heaving. </p>
    <h3>First Aid </h3>
    <p>The second step to dealing with winter damage is immediate
    aid-what you should and shouldn't do right after a storm.
    After an extremely heavy, clinging, wet snow, take a
    soft-bristled kitchen broom with you as you walk around your
    property. Shrubs or low-growing plants that are completely
    buried should be left alone; the heavy covering will both
    cushion and insulate them from damage. </p>
    <p>Leafless deciduous trees and shrubs usually need no
    attention. Their thin twigs and branches can support a quite
    heavy amount of snow without damage. If the snow has come at
    a time when the plants are still leafed-out, however, you may
    want to carefully remove the heaviest burden from badly bowed
    main branches. Place the bristle end of your broom (or your
    hands) under the middle of the branch and gently bounce
    upward a few times. Don't try to remove all the snow, don't
    push or pull at the branch tip, and don't whip the branch up
    and down-a few gentle nudges will suffice. </p>
    <p>Most needle-leafed pines, spruces, and hemlocks can be
    left undisturbed under their burden of snow-these plants have
    evolved in heavy-snow regions and have sufficient flexibility
    to bear heavy loads. Intervene only when the main trunk of a
    tree is badly bowed down, as is usually the case only in very
    young specimens. With small, badly bowed trees, gently shake
    the main trunk to dislodge most of the snow burden. Bounce
    from underneath to remove the heaviest accumulation from
    severely stressed lower branches. </p>
    <p>Dense evergreen shrubs like yews, arborvitae, and
    junipers, as well as sheared deciduous shrubs and hedges, are
    often deformed by heavy snow. Again, using a broom or your
    hands, gently bounce the branches from underneath. Don't
    shovel the dislodged snow away from the base of the shrub; as
    it builds up it forms a supporting platform for the lower
    branches and protects the plant from further damage. Once the
    snow is completely melted off the shrub, loosely spiral soft
    twine, bands of cloth, or soft rope around any deformed
    shrubs to gently ease them back into shape. Leaving the twine
    in place until early summer will usually &quot;retrain&quot;
    spread branches to their proper position. </p>
    <p>The aftermath of an<b> ice storm</b> is a different story
    altogether. Even in the case of very heavy ice coatings, it
    is best to DO NOTHING AT ALL. Because ice forms a brittle,
    rigid sleeve over everything it coats, it is both a load and
    a support. Trying to knock hard ice off even badly bowed
    trees and shrubs usually results in far more damage than
    allowing Nature to take its course. Once the ice begins to
    melt and drop from branches, you can help severely deformed
    shrubs by gently bouncing their branches from underneath to
    dislodge more of the ice. Use extreme care when moving around
    large trees whose branches are coated with ice-falling limbs
    can be deadly. </p>
    <h3>Clean-up and repair </h3>
    <p>The third aspect of dealing with winter damage involves
    clean-up and repair. As soon as the weather settles, assess
    the damage. Large trees with broken branches still hanging
    require professional care. Call a tree service at once-your's
    won't be the only damage in the area, and the arborists'
    schedule will likely be crowded. No matter how far down the
    waiting list you fall, don't be tempted to risk life and limb
    trying to pull down or saw out still-attached or dangling
    branches on a really big tree. </p>
    <p>Smaller trees and large shrubs with broken branches can be
    dealt with immediately. If the branch is completely severed,
    use a very sharp saw or pruning shears to remove the
    splintered stump from the tree. Make a clean, angled cut that
    will shed water and heal cleanly. If the surrounding bark is
    badly peeled or scraped, seal it using either tree-wound
    paint, or use oil-based house paint. Remove hanging bark with
    a sharp knife, cutting it off flush to the surface of the
    branch. </p>
    <p>Remove still-attached broken limbs. Trying to save a
    half-broken branch by splinting and propping is possible, but
    it's rarely worth the effort. Cut off broken branches close
    to the main stem, leaving clean, short, angled stubs. </p>
    <p>Uprooted, wind-toppled plants are another matter. In the
    case of very large, mature trees, removal is usually your
    only option-there will usually be severe damage to both crown
    and roots, making recovery impossible. You may be able to
    save smaller trees and shrubs, however, if a large portion of
    the root ball is still intact and the main trunk is not
    broken. You must act quickly. Protecting the roots from
    further damage is your first priority. Immediately cover the
    entire exposed root system with damp burlap, wet leaves, or
    straw. The remaining roots must not be allowed to dry out.
    (If the ground is frozen and you won't be able to replant the
    tree or shrub at once, pack the whole plant-root ball and
    branches-thickly with wet straw or leaves, peat moss,
    compost-anything that retains moisture- then cover it with a
    heavy tarpaulin, or burlap. Keep the entire plant protected
    from wind or drying until the ground thaws and you can
    replant.) </p>
    <p>If the ground isn't frozen, clean out the hole left by the
    uprooted root ball, removing rocks and severed roots. Fill
    the hole with water and let it absorb completely. Wrap a pad
    of cloth near the middle of the main trunk, then loop a
    length of sturdy rope or chain around the trunk. Remove any
    packing or covering from the roots. Slowly pull the plant
    upright, settling it back into the hole. Don't drag or roll
    it-you don't want to break any roots that might still be
    attached to the ground. </p>
    <p>Backfill immediately, firming the soil around the roots
    after every few shovelfuls. Don't stomp! Press gently to firm
    the soil without damaging fine roots. When the hole is
    half-filled, water again. Fill the hole completely, firm, and
    apply a thick mulch of wood chips, straw, or leaves. Water
    again, saturating the earth completely. </p>
    <p>Next, drive three or four support stakes into the solid
    earth just outside the tree or shrub dripline. Run stout wire
    or rope to the main trunk of the plant and brace it securely
    into a normal, upright position. Be sure to pad the trunk
    where the guy wires touch it. </p>
    <p>Prune away all damaged upper growth. If the broken
    branches removed total about one-third or more of the entire
    top growth, you're done. If less, prune back a little more,
    both to reduce the amount of top growth the roots must feed
    and to reduce the wind-load stress on the crown. Wrap exposed
    trunks with rodent-proof tree-wrap. </p>
    <p>To further anchor the plant, place bales of straw or
    peatmoss next to but not touching the trunk. Keep the
    re-planted specimen well watered until the ground freezes.
    Make frequent checks throughout the winter to make sure that
    guy wires remain taut and no heaving has occurred. </p>
    <p>Frost-heaving usually occurs when plants have been set out
    too late in the autumn to make good, anchoring root growth.
    Intermittent periods of mild and freezing weather cause the
    soil to expand and contract, lifting plants out of the
    ground. Heaved-up plants can be saved if you act quickly. If
    the soil is not frozen, carefully lift and reset the plant.
    Firm the soil, water thoroughly, and apply a heavy mulch as
    soon as the ground freezes again. A few well-placed stones or
    bricks set near the base of smaller plants may also help to
    keep them in place. </p>
    <p>If the ground is frozen solid and immediate replanting is
    impossible, use wet burlap to wrap as much of the exposed
    root ball as possible, then mound up damp peatmoss or straw
    around the base of the plant to further protect it from
    drying. Use a wire tomato cage to support any frost-heaved
    plant that looks ready to topple over in the next gust of
    wind. Replant as soon as the soil thaws. As a last resort,
    when dealing with very small frost-heaved specimens, consider
    lifting and potting the plant. Place it in a sheltered
    outdoor location, buried in deep mulch to the rim of the pot.
    Replant in the spring. </p>
    <p>Quick and appropriate action following a storm is
    critical. All it takes to lessen storm damage is a little
    planning, knowledge, and the ability to respond quickly to
    Old Man Winter's wrath. </p>

        Ehrhardt is a nationally and internationally known
        organic grower. She and her husband, Walter, founded
        Ehrhardt Organic Farm in 1979 as a commercial venture,
        demonstration farm and educational center. It is one of
        the first farms to be certified Organic by the Maryland
        Department of Agriculture. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Since 1981 Sylvia
        has conducted a training program at the Ehrhardt Organic
        Farm for students interested in organic agriculture. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Since 1982 Sylvia
        and Walter have conducted workshops and lectures on
        organic gardening and farming at her farm, around the
        United States and abroad in Austria, Brazil, Germany,
        Hungary, Poland and Russia. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Since 1991 the
        Ehrhardts have spent time in Russia each year, lecturing
        about ecological gardening and farming and providing
        technical assistance to urban gardeners and farmers in
        regions around St. Petersburg, Moscow and Volgograd. </font></p>

        turned over day-to-day operations of the farm to their
        daughter and son-in-law in 1992, freeing time for
        lectures, writing, consulting and travel. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">In 1992 the
        Ehrhardts successfully coordinated the International
        organic Gardening Training Program at Pine Ridge Indian
        Reservation in South Dakota. </font></p>

        a member of the United Nations Conference on Environment
        and Development (UNCED) Task Group on Sustainable
        Agriculture. The Task Group succeeded in persuading
        delegates to UNCED to include sustainable agriculture on
        the agenda of the conference that was held in Rio de
        Janeiro, Brazil, in June, 1992. She participated in the

How did you like his portrayal in 'Barfly'.  It remains one of my all time favorite movies.  But then again, I think it is both a touching and hilarious film.<br>

<b>Subject:</b> <i>Music on The English Patient trailer</i><p>
<b>Message:</b><br><ul>
I have a question about music on a specific movie trailer.  I have just recently seen the trailer for The English Patient, which can be found at<br>
http://www.miramax.com/dlpages/1englidl.html#video, and I was wondering<br>
if anyone knows what the music is.  I am aware that the first half of the trailer is the music Aria by Bach which can be found on The English<br>
Patient soundtrack, but I would really like to know what the orchestral piece is. It plays from the middle of the trailer till the end.  If anyone<br>
could help me out in any way posssible I would greatly appreciate it.  If by some chance you can't help could you give me some addresses where<br>
I might be able to email or write to someone who can.  Thanks</ul>

<br>
Please feel free to e-mail me directly.<br>

<b>Message:</b><br><ul>
I am a new gardener and am confused about what to do with my iris plants now - I replanted them last fall, and last spring/summer had only one bloom. Now most of the leaves are yellowed and drying, but some are still quite green. What do I do after they bloom? Should I cut the leaves back? <br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

You should cut back iris leaves in the fall and dispose of them in case of any disease which might be present.  Don't cut them down to the ground, but in a fan shape about 3-4 inches from the ground.  Your iris leaves should be nice and green next spring, and you should have more bloooms as the plants grow larger.  Don't you just love iris?!!</ul>

Iris leaves should be trimmed back in the fall and removed, in case of any disease which may be present.  Don't cut them down to the ground, but in a fan shape about 3-4 inches from the ground.  They should come back nice and green next year, and you should have more blooms as the plants grow larger.  Don't you just love iris?!?</ul>

I am in the Washington DC area. I have had a recurring problem with slugs wiping out several types of Dahlias I have been trying to get established in a near<br>
woodland garden. I have tried different types of traps and killed hundreds ( are dead slugs good for compost?) however these traps (including beer in sunken cans) seems to just attract more to the plants. Does anyone know of reasonable<br>
repellents which work in this area?</ul>

The only thing I have found that not only kills them, but repells them as well is by<br>
placeing a thin strip of plastic around your plant bed that has been anchored to the ground.<br>
On this put a thin layer of salt. Repeat this after every rain, or watering. </ul>

This is a horrible winter for newly planted perennials and bushes, especially roses, because we've had no snow cover for protection.  You should definitely put some kinf of covering around your plants that you put in this year.  Evergreen boughs (is your Christmas tree laying around outside somewhere?), leaves, pine needles, anything you can find to help cover and keep the ground from upheaving will help your plants make it through.  Good Luck!!</ul>

I used the product &quot;Wilt Proof&quot; on all of my evergreens last winter and it did a wonderful job of protecting them from moisture loss. It also seemed to provide a good overall protective barrier from insects and fungus/mildew.<br>
<br>
I also used it on my pine wreath and it stayed attractive until Easter.<br>

You need to make the soil lighter. Try adding sand.</ul>

Use caution when adding sand to heavy clay soil. In my area (south Texas) this mixture can result in something akin to concrete in the hot, dry summer. Continue to add leaves, grass clippings, compost and any other organic matter that you can get cheaply. Try some leguminous cover crops such as vetch if you are trying to improve the soil in an area that can be turned or tilled (the legumes have the added benefit of fixing nitrogen to the soil.) Gypsum and other rock powders can also be used to improve tilth and the mineral content of the soil. Mulch. Mulch. Mulch.</ul>

<b>Subject:</b> <i>Landscaping suggestions for narrow bed</i><p>
<b>Message:</b><br><ul>
I have a long, narrow bed (5 ft x 30 ft) that has sun light from 10am to 2pm during the summer time, less sun light during the winter. It is along the east side of my house. I have planted a row of azaleas in the inner side of the bed (where it touches the foundation of the house). The next row consists of variaged golden liriope. I need suggestion on how to fill the rest of the bed (the outside side). it's about 2 feet wide. I want something low that will not cover up my liriope. With that amount of sun light, do you think blue pacific juniper will thrive? I also thought of some evergreen ground cover but I don't want the ground cover to invade into the row of liriopes and azaleas. Right now I have a row of lamb ear just to fill the space, but not very happy with this idea. I want something (not expensive) with contrasting color and texture, yet low growing, evergreen is preferable, but will settle for perennial. That bed has low visibility so I don't want to spend a fortune on it.</ul>

<b>Message:</b><br><ul>
: I have a long, narrow bed (5 ft x 30 ft) that has sun light from 10am to 2pm during the summer time, less sun light during the winter. It is along the east side of my house. I have planted a row of azaleas in the inner side of the bed (where it touches the foundation of the house). The next row consists of variaged golden liriope. I need suggestion on how to fill the rest of the bed (the outside side). it's about 2 feet wide. I want something low that will not cover up my liriope. With that amount of sun light, do you think blue pacific juniper will thrive? I also thought of some evergreen ground cover but I don't want the ground cover to invade into the row of liriopes and azaleas. Right now I have a row of lamb ear just to fill the space, but not very happy with this idea. I want something (not expensive) with contrasting color and texture, yet low growing, evergreen is preferable, but will settle for perennial. That bed has low visibility so I don't want to spend a fortune on it.<br>
<br>
What about Dianthus 'Tiny Rubies' or some other low growing Dianthus? Or daffodils, crocus? How about taking it all out of a line and grouping the plants instead? Yhen you would have areas with wider spaces in which you could plant more interesting things.</ul>

Hello everyone,<br>
<br>
I am a teacher of science for special education students. I am looking for good hands on activities to teach these students about gardening and agriculture. The students are 10 -14 years old with specific learning disabilities or mild retardation. We are beginning to plant a fall garden in a raised bed plot. If anyone has any suggestions for activities, winter hardy plants (for Hazlehurst, MS) or unusual garden designs....please let me know. Your suggestions will be greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

Hi Deborah,<br>
Plant pansies, mums, ornamental kale, cabage. Also consider silver dusty miller, and snap dragon. I have had dusty miller untouched by the winter in the Northern Virginia area. My dusty miller and snap dragon came back the next spring. If you want to plant snap dragon, plant them where they have afternoon shade.<br>
<br>
Good luck,<br>
JD<br>

<b>Message:</b><br><ul>
I live on the Eastern Shore of Md. I bought a 20 year old piece of property of which approx 1acre is lawn. At this time of year (mid/late summer) the lawn is overgrown with a spreading weed to the point that it appears that there is no grass in the lawn. The weed is green.<br>
So, how do I redo the entire lawn??<br>
Do I overseed this falll? I don't particularly want to use chemicals such as &quot;weed be gone&quot;, as I have 2 dogs and a cat and don't like using chemicals anyway.<br>
Any all suggestions would be welcome.<br>
Also, about 85% of the lawn is sunny, only the back part of the property is in any type of shade. That area is ok. </ul>

Does anybody have the SECRET to getting rid of gophers??????<br>
I have tried everything. Except poision. We have five cats and four dogs,<br>

I have tried flares, gopher bombs, moth balls. A plant called gopher purge.<br>
Nothing seems to work. I am having to resort to above ground gardening which<br>
really sucks since we live on 10 acres. I welcome any proven ideas.<br>

I would suggest figuring out what they are eating and removing that. Moles like to eat Japanese Beetle grubs and other grubs so if you killed them in the soil the moles would go away. Is that who you mean when you say gophers? If so then start putting down Milky Spore disease this fall and maybe trapping the beetles next season. Also some dogs really love to dig up and kill moles. I had a Daschound when I was a kid and she really put a dent in them. Of course there were dug up tunnels all over instead...</ul>

Zoo. They have not been of any help. I know you use concrete and black<br>
tar paper. I am curious about the concrete mix I should use and how to go about <br>
it.<br>
<br>
Can anyone help me out????<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

<b>Message:</b><br><ul>
I have many clusters of oriental/asiatic type lilies in sunny spots in my southern NH garden. They all grow very well, but when they begin to bloom the lower leaves all turn brown and die. This process slowly climbs up the length of each stalk so you no longer notice the beautiful flowers. Anyone have any idea what is causing this?</ul>

As you may know, azalia and hydrangea bloom on last year's wood. Is it possible that you are pruning off the buds without realizing it?</ul>

The best way to deter squirrels is to feed them something else. One<br>
of those cute squirrel tables with an ear of dryed corn or a dish<br>
of cracked corn. They particularly love sun flower seeds and you<br>
will probably attract some nice birds too! For a homemade pepper <br>
spray soak some red hot dried peppers in water and put the resulting<br>
water in a sprayer ... though I'd rather feed them than have them<br>
crying and rubbing their eyes. </ul>

Since you're in zone 3, maybe 4, you can plant tulips starting in late August and September to get an early start. Most garden centers in your area should have bulbs for sale then, they may be starting to get them in soon. Mail order bulb catalogs are arriving in my mailbox now. They usually ship orders to the coldest areas first. You can continue to plant till the ground is frozen. Most tulips should be hardy in your area. </ul>

I agree with Sherry about a sunny location and the combination of ingredients<br>
in your compost. I have been composting for several years and have found that<br>
a good mix of kitchen food scraps and plant material seems to work well.<br>
I also have a chipper/shredder that I use on all brush trimmings. I also add this to the<br>
compost. Just look around you will be amazed at all that can go into making<br>
the beautiful black gold.<br>
<br>
Have funnnnnnn!!!</ul>

: Is it better to put a compost bin in the sun or shade? <br>
<br>
Having spent the last several years with compost piles in various exposures, I seem to get faster useable material from the sunnier spots although the fastest breakdown relys on the right mix of nitrogen to carbon materials, because this simulates the microbial action. Good luck-once you feeding your garden compost everything starts growing better! </ul>

<b>Subject:</b> <i>Who's eating my tomatos?</i><p>
<b>Message:</b><br><ul>
Every year we grow tomatos in our back yrad, usually only 6-8 plants of different varieties.<br>
<br>
Also every year, as soon as they turn red, something eats jagged holes into them. I don't know if it's birds, but that's what I suspect. I don't see any infestation that could explain it otherwise.<br>
<br>
What can I do to get more tomatos and less moth-eaten ones?<br>
<br>
BTW, If I pick some of these partly eated tomatos and put them out for easy access to the birds, none are touched.<br>
<br>
I need help!!!!<br>

Mike , my tomatoes get eaten in the same way and I blame it on the woodchucks. You can buy a mesh netting to cover the plants and see if that works. Be sure you secure the netting to the ground so that nothing can crawl through and support the net so that it does not lay on the plants. You may be able to get some whole tomatoes this year, unless it's chipmunks. Theyl just burrow under the net, but most animals won't go near it for fear of getting trapped inside.<br>

John, <br>
<br>
Personally I don't have any hands-on experience with either of these plants but they are mentioned in several of my resource guides. Since no one else has answered, I thought I could at least passalong what I found. It's suggested that the Fatzia should be pruned in spring. Hard pruning of old growth should stimulate in basal growth. Propagation is best accomplished through the the simple method of layering, scoring and laying a lower branch under the soil till it roots. Place a brick or stone over the branch to hold in place. This may take up to 2 yrs.-- so patience is necessary but results are quaranteed until you break it off from its mother. Soft and hard wood cuttings are always trickier with some woody shrubs but in protected locations it's worth trying.<br>
<br>
As far as the hops is concerned I understand the species seeds can be viable. Collect in fall, stratify then plant in spring. All seeds do not come true to their original plant. Since yours is a cultivar, the seeds may not come true,cultivars seeds are known to be sterile. It is also suggested that you can dig away a portion from the ground of the new growth in spring. This should have some roots attached. Simple layering may work too. Maybe this info will help. </ul>

The Black Snakes have decided to start mating in my yard (maryland). They're hanging of off ladders, out of trees, wherever and whenever they want. I'm sure they will come inside as soon as they can.<br>

Just reading your black snake post has given me goosebumps the size of eggs! I'm terribly afraid of snakes, though I know they do the garden good by eliminating rodents. But, hey, isn't that what a cat's for? And a cat will not only hold down the rodents but keep away the snakes as well! So, find a feline friend if you don't have one. Another trick to keep them from coming into your home is to pack steel wool into any cracks or crevices where a snake could enter as they can't tolerate the stuff. I've also heard that they keep their distance from moth balls,too, so you might want to try them at possible points of entry. <br>
My Aunt had to have her home professionally exterminated due to black snakes breeding in her stone foundation and she had to move out of the house for two weeks to have it done. I hope your solution is far less drastic than that. Best of luck!<br>

<b>Subject:</b> <i>Re: Black Snakes in my yard</i><p>
<b>Message:</b><br><ul>
: The Black Snakes have decided to start mating in my yard (maryland). They're hanging of off ladders, out of trees, wherever and whenever they want. I'm sure they will come inside as soon as they can.<br>
: <br>
: I'd like them to go to someone else's yard. Any suggestions? <br>
<br>
We had this problem 2 years ago and they did get in the<br>
house. From what I learned during this ordeal, the black<br>
snakes come because there are mice and other type rodents near or around your house. <br>
<br>
Additionally, their breeding season is around Sept so they dig under the stoop many times so they can breed and stay their through winter <br>
since it is below the freeze line. We had them in our siding, under the stoops and I hate snakes.<br>
<br>
Anyway, we had a service come out to use that expanding<br>
spray foam near our foundation where there are cracks to <br>
try and stop them from coming in the house. They also filled<br>
in lots of dirt under our stoops, but each year the <br>
chipmunks dig it back out again.<br>
<br>
Hope this information helps. </ul>

Hi, Kristine -- <br>
<br>
In reply to your Dig query about a small space garden and what goes well with <br>
junipers<br>
<br>
I'd give a better answer if I knew what kind of light the area receives. <br>
Junipers are handsome fluffy dark evergreens that would look well if the <br>
corners of the property had a few flowering shrubs -- like forsythia which <br>
covers itself with gold flowers in early spring -- evergreen azaleas which <br>
bloom a littel later and come in gorgeous shades of pink, white, coral, red -- <br>
and the leaves turn toward yellow adn red a little in winter; potentilla, a <br>
carefree shrub that bears yellow flowers bright as buttercups all summer long <br>
-- and barberries, which color up wonderfully in flal adn have bright red <br>
berries that birds love.<br>
<br>
If the junipers are being used as a &quot;Lawn&quot; -- covering the area, you could <br>
group those shrubs in a corner where yuo'd see them as you come onto teh <br>
property adn where you'd see them from whatever is the main window.<br>
If the juniper is a carpeting juniper, you could also have daffodils coming up <br>
through it here and there - those you plant in fall. <br>
<br>
Hope this inspires your creative genes!<br>
<br>
All The Best -- Jacqui Heriteau</ul>

A lot depends on your exposure, your gardening zone and the type of soil you have. Whatever you do, I highly recommend perennials, which take a little time to develop, but in the long run is more economical. Do you want color in your beds, foliage, shrubbery? Don't rush, look through magazines, other homes in your area & your local nursery so you won't do anything that has to be undone.</ul>

<b>Message:</b><br><ul>
Hi. I live in the country and there are rabbits all around, so I put<br>
up a small fence about the garden. I had heard that marigolds tend to<br>
discourage critters from getting into the garden, so I planted them <br>
around the perimeter. Unfortunately, the beautiful marigold flowers<br>
are being all eaten up by some unknown critter, and it's gotten me<br>
down. I wonder if you have a word of advice.<br>
<br>
with thanks,<br>

Try using layers of newspaper under your mulch. Use atleast a 24 page <br>
thickness. I save all my newpapers and my neighbors save theirs for me.<br>
What a way to recycle. The paper will eventually decay, but by then you <br>
might be ready to replant the area anyway. I consider this a freebie for my<br>
flower garden<br>

Have funnnnn!!! </ul>

<br>
Hi, Liz:<br>
<br>
About grass in a garden: the sure way to prevent grass from growing is to <br>
cover the area with a mulch of shredded pine bark, bark chips, pine needles, <br>
or something of that sort,. Make the mulch 3 inches deep, and replenish it as <br>
it decays on the underside. <br>
<br>
If your garden has grass already up and growing lustily you may have to kill <br>
it first before mulching. Mulching tends to prevent grass and weeds from <br>
developing but once they are up adn going it won't stop them. So -- get heavy <br>
duty black plastic at the garden center, and during the hottest time of the <br>
year, lay it over the areas where the grass is growing, and keep it there six <br>
weeks or until the grass is definitely dead. Black plastic adn high heat will <br>
bake everything under the plastic. Then you can remove the ploastic, and mulch <br>
the area to keep any new weed seeds from taking root. If you have an old barn <br>
door to lay over the area you can use that instead of plastic. Basically you <br>
are out to cook the weeds and deprive them of water until they adn their seeds <br>
are too hot to come back.<br>
<br>
You can kill grass that has sprouted among rocks the same way, by shading and <br>
baking it out of existence.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

<b>Subject:</b> <i>Waterlogged Garden</i><p>
<b>Message:</b><br><ul>
I live in Kirkland, WA, just north of Seattle. Our house is built on a slope, NW to SE. The back garden is 80ft wide and about 30ft wide to the start of the house. To prevent the back slope from creeping across the patio we installed eco blocks 10ft from the back fence. These are 2 high (4ft) and run the width of the garden.<br>
<br>
Here is the problem. Somewhere behind the blocks is an underground spring. Also, the soil is clay about 1 foot from the surface. We get a lot of rain in Seattle. The area in front of the blocks (about 4 ft) is grass then a concrete patio. This is permanently water logged. We have tried building a french drain, this didn't work too well.<br>
<br>
Any suggestions, please? We are desparate. I had thought of building a pond, but dread to think of digging through a couple of feet of clay to get depth. Also, I do not want to undermine the blocks. My latest thought is to dig down about 6 inches and gravel the areas where the grass is.<br>
<br>
Any comments will be truly appreciated.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>

Dear Anita,<br>
<br>
The classic solutions to your wet feet are: 1) to dig down, find <br>
the spring,and drain it off over a gravel run: 2) import soil and <br>
build a raised bed where the water stays, and plant it with big <br>
plants,. things that love water, like willows and dogwoods, clethra,<br>
and viburnum; or ornamental grasses that like wet feet, or ground <br>
covers like galax that like a damp soil surface,lamium and so on. <br>
In the good old days on a farm, the solution to a wet spot <br>
was to stick it full of young stems of willow wood before the <br>
trees leafed out and let them drink it dry. But if you have an <br>
underground spring constantly seeping to the surface you need <br>
something there that will keep using up the water -- so solution<br>
Number 2 is the one I prefer.<br>

Check out some of the homemade organic spray recipes at http://www.whitehawk.com/dirtdoctor/recipes.html. The onion/garlic spray works well for me in Houston as an insect repellent. Try the baking soda spray as a mild fugicide. </ul>

You were right on! I am always amazed that folks are not concerned about what they put on something they will eventually eat. That is one of the advantages of growing your own vegetables...you control what goes on them. As a Master Gardener I am extremely concerned with the overuse of chemicals. I have been gardening for many years and will only use organic methods for controling problems. I prefer to use beneficial insects to control pest problems. If I have a disease problem I try and figure out why...did I water incorrectly...did the weather cause the problem...I find that by planting a few extra tomatoe plants as insurance I can always pull out a plant and still have enough fruit.<br>

I have a gardening client who sprinkled Milorganite fertilizer on her Hosta, daylilies, and roses this past season and it worked rather well. You have to reapply it whenever the granules disappear- maybe 4 x per season. I believe it has composted sewage sludge in it and that is probably what deters the deer. The other good remedy is a dog that will bark and chase them. A radio controlled fence will keep the dog from chasing them past your property. Another good method is to thin them out by putting them in your freezer. In Fairfax County Va. where it is illegal to discharge a firearm they are giving out permits to hunt them with bow and arrow if you can get all the surrounding neighbors to agree.</ul>

<br>
I've been wondering if anyone had practical experience utilizing Milorganite on their gardens. Jacqui Heriteau directed me to some reserach using it on several test gardens. The tests were conducted through Cornell University's agriculture research programs--some done with master gardeners. It was determined that repeat applications were necessary to ward off deer and other scavengers for the &quot;feeding&quot; season. If anyone's interested in a copy of Cornell's research results,gv e-mail address with request </ul>

Do you see deer tracks? Sometimes the culprit is a rabbit, woodchuck,&<br>
even geese or ducks can do a lot of damage. Deer tend to chew at <br>
higher levels than other animals although deer will ravage daylilies,<br>
tulips and lilies but so will woodchucks. There's lots of new fangled <br>
solutions to discouraging animals but the best deterent will always be a <br>
fence! </ul>

Yes, High humidity and soapy water will slow them down.<br>
A good bug by the name of predator mites eat them and their <br>
eggs and then starve to death, thus they produce twice as fast.<br>
However spider mites always figure a way back with a vengeance. </ul>

Add a couple of drops of liquid dish soap to water in a spray bottle and spray the plant, on both sides of the leaves. Spider mites like it dry and dirty, keep washing the leaves and you should get rid of the mites. </ul>

I do not have any personal experience with this, but I saw a television show which featured an ivy expert, and she recommended giving the ivy a gold water shower once a week. Seems like cold and clean would work as spider mites like dry and dirty.</ul>

            height="14"> <font color="#FFFFFF">Jesus, I didn't
            realize when I went to the movies this morning I was
            going to have to *think*!</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">But seriously, that's what
            you're going to be doing if you see THE PORTRAIT OF A
            LADY -- Jane Campion's follow-up to THE PIANO, based
            on Henry James's &quot;classic&quot; novel that
            you've probably never read. Now, I'm wishing that I
            had, though, because PORTRAIT is a fantastic movie to
            watch, exquisitely crafted and painstakingly
            detailed, gorgeously photographed and full of style
            -- but it is just plain impossible to follow.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I mean *impossible* to
            follow -- I'm guessing that's why I get copies of the
            production notes and why you get to read reviews like
            this: to explain the plot. So here goes: Isabel
            (Nicole Kidman) is a woman in 1872 Europe who eschews
            the traditional life of the time (i.e. marry a rich
            guy) and has the world's first afro (check out the
            publicity stills). She's a rare free spirit in an age
            of repression. Turning down suitors played by Viggo
            Mortensen, Richard E. Grant, and AMATEUR's Martin
            Donovan, Isabel turns out to be pretty gullible, too,
            and gets suckered into marrying the manipulative
            Osmond (John Malkovich), thanks to the duplicity of
            Osmond's evil friend Madame Merle (a nearly
            unrecognizable Barbara Hershey). (Yes, it does sound
            very DANGEROUS LIAISONS-ish.) Isabel soon finds her
            life pretty miserable, and then 124 years later they
            make a movie about it. That's *way* simplified.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">You're probably saying that
            PORTRAIT is probably not the best movie material out
            there, and I agree, but if anyone was going to have
            the ability to pull this off, it was Campion, and
            I've got to give her credit for trying.
            Unfortunately, unlike THE PIANO, PORTRAIT is
            incredibly hard to get at, a dense and mostly
            inaccessible try at making something into art.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">There's so much good about
            the film, though, that it's hard not to recommend --
            the performances are top-notch, especially Donovan as
            Isabel's cousin, who really deserves notice for this
            production. Kidman is really coming into her own as a
            true talent, as well, and the remaining cast are all
            great. Again, beautiful art direction,
            cinematography, direction by Campion, and interesting
            editing all work to the film's advantage. The only
            problem I had: what's with the black &amp; white
            inserts, slow-motion, askew angles, and singing
            beans(!?) that show up now and then? We do *not* need
            another ERASERHEAD.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Oh well... you should still
            see it, if for no other reason than it will give you
            plenty of conversation material for a *long* time.
            And you'll get some interesting hairstyling ideas.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">[Be sure to listen for the
            best inside-joke line: &quot;I would have given my
            little finger...&quot;] </font></p>

            height="14"> <font color="#FFFFFF">What could be more
            foul than having your ashes spread over the beach of
            the horribly polluted Gulf of Mexico? Well, maybe
            having to sit through THE EVENING STAR, the
            long-awaited tearjerky sequel to TERMS OF ENDEARMENT.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">THE EVENING STAR picks up in
            1988, and follows 8 more years of the further
            adventures of Aurora Greenwood's (Shirley MacLaine)
            ber-dysfunctional extended family. Now, Emma's
            (Debra Winger in TERMS) kids have grown up under
            Aurora's eye, and the jury's still out on how well
            she did. Their Aunt Patsy (Miranda Richardson) is now
            a wealthy divorcee who is constantly one-upping
            Aurora. The caustic Aurora finds brief happiness in
            the arms of a younger man (Bill Paxton). Rosie
            (Marion Ross) is still in Aurora's kitchen, and a
            whole horde of minor players weave in and out of the
            action, mainly serving to dredge up the past and to
            breathe some new life into the ENDEARMENT franchise.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">THE EVENING STAR is so chock
            full of mystery illnesses &amp; deaths, Oedipal
            complexes, prison terms, illegitimate children, and
            other staples of daytime TV that you'd think it would
            make a much better movie than it does. Instead, the
            film comes off as a pointless rehashing of old story
            lines, part soap opera (see above illnesses, etc.)
            and part sitcom (sample wacky dialogue: &quot;How are
            we gonna get Aurora Greenwood to see a
            shrink!?&quot;).</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">...and *all* cheese. By
            killing off the entire senior citizen population of
            Houston (where the film is set and was shot in), the
            filmmakers go straight for the tear ducts, in the
            hopes that you'll be crying too much to notice that
            this movie has no plot whatsoever. When someone's not
            gasping last words, the film is just a series of
            movie clichs, one after another. Why bother?</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">While there are a few bright
            sparks in the film, notably the fantastically
            over-the-top Richardson and the curmudgeony Ross,
            plus some decent jokes here and there, overall the
            movie is a meandering tale that, in the end, just
            reminds me even more of why I hate Houston so much. </font></p>

            height="14"> <font color="#FFFFFF">As Norman Bates
            said it: &quot;A boy's best friend is his
            mother.&quot; And just as Norman's family had its own
            brand of extreme dysfunctionality, Albert Brooks
            dredges up more of his neuroses in MOTHER, a new
            comedy about making peace with your past --
            particularly with Mom.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">At least I think that's what
            it's about. MOTHER starts off with a definitive
            whimper, and it takes a long time to get to the real
            story. (Lisa Kudrow makes a short appearance at the
            film's opening -- which bodes ill for the film, as it
            violates the &quot;Never put a 'Friend' in a
            movie&quot; rule which was established early last
            year.)</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">So, in the first 15 minutes,
            here's what we do get. Brooks plays John Henderson, a
            frustrated science fiction writer who is just
            finishing all the paperwork on his second divorce.
            His life is a shambles, and John flails about for
            some kind of answer to the questions of life. His
            ingrate brother (Rob Morrow) is no help, so John
            turns to the one person who understands him *least*
            -- his mother.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">John drives the 400 miles
            from L.A. to Sausalito and finds Mom (played by the
            wonderful Debbie Reynolds) a reluctant host, plying
            him with 3-year-old sherbet and frozen cheese. John
            is moving back home with one thing on his mind:
            &quot;The Experiment,&quot; a kind of soul searching
            that isn't easy to explain in the context of a film
            review (the one time John tries to explain it in the
            film, Mom turns and replies, &quot;I'm sorry John, I
            wasn't listening...&quot;).</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">And while you may not really
            understand this Experiment thing, the give and take
            between the two leads makes for some excellent
            comedic moments: Mom talks about John's divorce to
            the pet store clerk, John takes Mom into Victoria's
            Secret to buy her some crotchless panties. You get
            the idea.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The gist of the rest of the
            film revolves around John trying to figure out why
            animosity exists between he and his mother, and when
            he does, everything ties up a little too
            nice-and-neatly, and everyone's happy again. But cut
            him some slack; relationships are by definition a
            tricky subject, and Brooks is to be praised for
            exploring one like this. I don't know if he's right
            about the whole thing, but I had a good time watching
            him try to figure it all out. If you have a mother,
            you should too.</font></p>

            height="14"> <font color="#FFFFFF">Just so you know,
            &quot;patient&quot; refers to a man with a medical
            condition, not the ability to sit through a film that
            flirts with a three hour running time.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">You think I'm kidding, but
            I'm *serious* -- THE ENGLISH PATIENT has got to be
            the longest romance movie I've ever seen. Well, OUT
            OF AFRICA was awfully long, too, but that doesn't
            make it okay! (Like your mother might say, &quot;If
            Meryl Streep jumped off a cliff, would you do it
            too?&quot;)</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, I'm being
            melodramatic, but my three hours in the front row
            (not by choice) didn't do my neck a bit of good, and
            if this review seems a bit grumpy, I refuse to be
            held responsible.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">THE ENGLISH PATIENT is a
            grand tale of love and loss set during the backdrop
            of the African theatre of WWII. Told using a
            structure that busts Hollywood's Three Acts wide
            open, we follow a man we eventually come to know as
            The Count (Ralph Fiennes), whose plane has been shot
            down near the start of the war. Horribly disfigured
            in the resulting fire and an apparent amnesiac, the
            Count finds himself in the hands of Hana (Juliette
            Binoche), a Canadian nurse. While the war plays out,
            with Hana and the Count holed up in an abandoned
            monastery, so does the truth about the Count's past
            -- an intrigue-filled tale of adventure, love, and
            tragedy.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Fiennes is spectacular is
            the mystery man, and Kristin Scott Thomas (who plays
            the Count's flashback love interest) shows that, when
            she dyes her hair blonde, she can seriously burn up
            the screen. Also look for Willem Dafoe in one of his
            most earnest and accessible roles to date. Serious
            praises are deserved by the film's art director and
            editor, and I'll be absolutely shocked if THE ENGLISH
            PATIENT doesn't take home a Best Makeup Design Oscar.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The only problem with the
            film, besides severe butt-ache, is a number of holes
            in writer/director Anthony Minghella's (TRULY MADLY
            DEEPLY) screenplay. You'd think that with that extra
            hour, he could fill these holes up, but I guess not.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">No matter. THE ENGLISH
            PATIENT is still a solid story and an
            exquisitely-produced film. There's always enough
            going on to hold the viewer's eye, or even get you to
            shed a tear or two. Just be forewarned that the best
            films always have sad endings.</font></p>

            height="14"> One of the most sincere and earnest
            looks into single life in the 90's, SWINGERS is
            nothing but -- in the terms of its resident lounge
            lizards -- *money*.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">You've probably seen print
            ads, movie reviews, and the like, portraying SWINGERS
            as a film about a bunch of suave and sexy guys,
            making the moves on the pretty babies (aka women) in
            the nightlife of La-La land. The title's double
            entendre doesn't help matters, either, so let me set
            the record straight.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">SWINGERS is about a bunch of
            guys in L.A., yes, but they aren't overly suave, with
            the exception of Trent (the hysterically funny Vince
            Vaughn), who lives in an apparent fantasy world of
            CLOCKWORK ORANGEy faux-English doublespeak. His best
            friend is Mike (Jon Favreau, who also wrote the
            script), a down-and-out actor/comedian suffering over
            the breakup with his girlfriend of six years. Rob
            (Ron Livingston) and Sue (is in &quot;a boy named
            Sue,&quot; Patrick Van Horn) are both actors/losers
            also.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Weaving through Los Angeles
            and Las Vegas, Trent, Mike, and their friends turn
            out to pretty much be high-talkers and low-rollers,
            about like everyone else. We see that these are
            regular guys, each with his own demons, each as
            insecure as you and me. But they talk a big game.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Sound familiar? In the end,
            SWINGERS perfectly humanizes its players, makes a
            touching statement about getting back on your feet
            after love knocks you down, and, most importantly,
            comes off as really, really, really funny. Favreau
            and director Doug Liman are sure to hit the big time
            after this, and Vaughn (who's already been picked to
            star in JURASSIC PARK 2) ought to get a Best
            Supporting Actor nomination, at least.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">SWINGERS is one of those
            very rare movies where you really come out a changed,
            happier person -- at least for awhile. Hey, maybe I'm
            money, and I don't even know it!</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">And am I the only one that
            thinks Favreau looks *exactly* like George Clooney?
            And yes, Doug, that Aaton-III camera is *way* too
            loud.</font></p>

            src="../graphics/film/stars3h.gif" width="61"
            height="14"> Get this tagline for TREES LOUNGE:
            &quot;A story about one man's search... for who knows
            what.&quot; That could describe quite well
            writer/director/star Steve Buscemi during his
            creation of this film, a quirky and melodramatic
            tragicomedy about... who knows what.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Buscemi plays Tommy, a
            regular guy in Long Island whose life is basically a
            series of alcoholic binges, sprinkled with failed
            love affairs, cheap drugs, and terminal unemployment.
            A parade of supporting characters (all played by
            Buscemi's personal friends) run in and out of his
            life, and everyone tries to make some sense of it
            all.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The Trees Lounge is the
            unfortunately-named bar where Tommy spends virtually
            all of his time. It's the kind of joint where a guy
            can walk into one night and come back out 20 years
            later, wondering where his life went. It's the kind
            of place you can almost smell -- or maybe that was
            just the movie theater's goo-encrusted floor.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I get the feeling that TREES
            LOUNGE is the movie that all filmmakers are secretly
            dying to make -- a personal portrait of simple life,
            nothing but depression all the way. The reason this
            kind of movie doesn't get made more often is because
            (1) no studio in their right mind would let someone
            do such a thing [case in point: TREES LOUNGE is being
            released by the only-recently-out-of-bankruptcy Orion
            Pictures], and (2) when you get down to brass tacks,
            not many people *really* want to make a movie about
            someone that's more pathetic than they are.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Still, I've got to admire
            Buscemi for doing it anyway. Buscemi has complained
            in interviews about having trouble writing the script
            for TREES LOUNGE, and it shows, but at least he
            doesn't let the self-pity get too thick, applying
            liberal doses of comedy to counter the tragic
            underscore of the film. Overall, he ends up with a
            picture that isn't half bad, but which just doesn't
            make for a light matinee and *certainly* isn't
            &quot;fun for the whole family.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">As a director, Buscemi isn't
            awful, but he isn't great. As far as his casting
            choices, they're fine, except for his breaking of the
            cardinal rule that Daniel Baldwin should never be
            allowed to be in a movie. Chloe Sevigny (KIDS) is a
            fun Lolita, and minor roles like Bronson Dudley's
            eternal barfly are a scream, and they really show
            Buscemi's knack for comedy. Let's hope he explores
            this a little more in his next offering.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">P.S. Be sure to watch for
            the cameo by the faux-Reservoir Dogs (it's in the
            first five minutes).</font></p>

            movie, except Neil Jordan's paean to the Irish hero
            leaves much to be desired by the discriminating
            viewer. Jordan, best known for his masterpiece THE
            CRYING GAME, really seems to be falling apart these
            days (did *you* stay awake during INTERVIEW WITH THE
            VAMPIRE?). Now he's back with MICHAEL COLLINS, a
            rambling, 138-minute epic that could have easily been
            cut to 90, and has its good points and its bad -- but
            the bad really stick out like sore thumbs.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Using more scrolling title
            cards than I've ever seen before, at first I thought
            MICHAEL COLLINS was going to be a read-along. But
            instead of incorporating this information about
            Collins (Liam Neeson) into the story, Jordan tacks on
            the printed Michael Collins at-a-glance biography and
            just plugs the movie full of the same sequence over
            and over again. (That sequence is this: the IRA guys
            are asleep, then the Brits come on a raid, then the
            IRA guys get away just in time. Whew!)</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Then there's the
            what-on-earth-were-you-thinking decision to put Julia
            Roberts in this movie as Kitty Kiernan, the woman
            torn between Collins and his once-best friend Harry
            Boland (Aidan Quinn). Seriously, my Irish accent is
            better than Roberts's, and I'm from *Texas*.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The real story of Michael
            Collins may be a good one -- full of intrigue,
            infighting with the Irish President Eamon De Valera
            (Alan Rickman), bloody war with the English, and a
            struggle to get the girl with the bad Irish accent.
            The problem is that Jordan tells the story like it's
            a history lesson, and a dull one at that. Yes, the
            movie's full of good acting (exception noted above),
            gory violence, and lavish sets (all of which are
            blown up by the end of the film), but it ends up
            being just another over-indulgent sermon by a
            misguided preacher.</font></p>

            height="14"><font color="#FFFFFF"> If you learn only
            one thing while watching SURVIVING PICASSO, it will
            probably be this: Pablo Picasso was a big fat jerk.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately, that's about
            all you'll learn, as Merchant-Ivory's latest exercise
            in excess sheds little light on the great artiste and
            leaves the viewer with even less of an understanding
            as to why Picasso was the man he was.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Anthony Hopkins is the
            obvious choice for Picasso, and the film takes the
            track of vaguely following Picasso's life along with
            his many, many love interests, including the
            psychotic Dora Maar (Julianne Moore in a fantastic
            performance), his wife Olga (Jeanne Lapotaire), a
            couple of other relationships, plus the mysterious
            Francoise Gilot (Natascha McElhone), who suffered
            with Pablo for some ten years. (All of the women
            perform their roles admirably.)</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">What the film doesn't do is
            show you any insight into Picasso's life, except for
            the fact that he was stingy, paranoid, stubborn, and
            basically a lech. The movie's liberal use of
            voice-over and thick accents doesn't help matters,
            and this already cryptic tale becomes even more
            inaccessible -- not only is it hard to understand
            what this movie is really about, it's hard to
            understand what anyone is saying.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">As played by Hopkins,
            Picasso is transformed into a childish goon with no
            redeeming qualities, and given SURVIVING PICASSO's
            123 minute running time, this gets extremely
            tiresome, extremely quickly. For the last 1 1/2
            hours, I was really just waiting for the credits. So
            I guess we'll never really understand what Picasso
            was all about.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The sad result is that, in
            the end, SURVIVING PICASSO is really just one long
            exercise in survival itself.</font></p>

            height="14"> <font color="#FFFFFF">How on earth did
            Kevin Bacon get top billing in a cast that includes
            Robert DeNiro, Dustin Hoffman, Brad Pitt, and Jason
            Patric -- just for starters? That's just one of the
            disturbing aspects of SLEEPERS (and I don't mean that
            in a bad way), Barry Levinson's new drama/thriller
            that finally redeems him for the idiocy of DISCLOSURE
            and TOYS.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Based on the extremely
            controversial novel, SLEEPERS tells what is purported
            to be a true story of revenge in Hell's Kitchen in
            New York City. Four early-teenaged friends (played as
            adults by Patric, Pitt, Ron Eldard, and Billy Crudup
            -- who I have to mention just because I like to say
            &quot;Crudup&quot;) are sent to a juvenile center
            when a prank goes wrong and almost kills a bystander.
            The brutality that occurs in the center does not need
            to be expounded upon, but suffice it's very horrible,
            and that guard Sean Nokes (Bacon) is the baddest of
            the bad guys.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Flash forward 13 years to
            1981, when a very non-reformed John and Tommy (Eldard
            and Crudup) run into Nokes in a neighborhood bar,
            and, on the spot, shoot him 6 times in front of 4
            witnesses. When it goes to trial, a now-assistant
            D.A. Michael (Pitt) takes the case and decides it's
            time for payback to everyone from the bad-old days at
            the center.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Working with attorney Danny
            Snyder (Hoffman), their old neighborhood priest
            (DeNiro), old pal Carol (Minnie Driver), and
            newsman-in-training &quot;Shakes&quot; (Patric),
            Michael constructs an intricate plan to get the guys
            off the hook and bring down the juvenile center in
            the process -- by losing the case he is prosecuting.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">If you've seen GOODFELLAS,
            you know what you're in for -- an overly-narrated
            epic saga about growing up in New York and the
            consequences of events that start when you're just a
            kid. And just like Scorcese, Levinson lays on the
            narration like butter on pancakes (all via Patric),
            and this gets old, *fast.*</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">But the point is that
            SLEEPERS is a very powerful story, and you never
            really notice that it's 2 1/2 hours long. The
            performances are universally good (although Eldard
            and Crudup basically have no lines), and seeing
            Dustin Hoffman as a long-haired alcoholic/failed
            attorney is quite a treat. DeNiro is excellent in
            showing his inner turmoil over whether or not to lie
            on the witness stand, and the kids (who I don't feel
            like naming right now) all pull off their parts just
            fine.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">SLEEPERS has its share of
            technical goofs, like a whole lot of black-and-white
            flashbacks, slow-motion, fast-motion, surreal-motion,
            and other camera tricks that really detract from the
            story and don't belong here. Also in question is a
            really rotten score and a questionable choice of
            background &quot;period&quot; songs -- and you can
            blame veteran composer John Williams, if you can
            believe that.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Oh well, at least it's a
            very solid story that leaves you wondering... did it
            really happen? As for the moral of this little tale?
            This is all I can figure: Two wrongs don't make a
            right, but maybe 150 wrongs do. They might be right
            about that.</font></p>

            height="14"> The much-publicized ballyhoo over THE
            LONG KISS GOODNIGHT relates largely to the $4 million
            paid for Shane Black's script. The question everyone
            is asking is, was it worth it?</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Well, yes and no. Opening
            weekend is sure to bring in moviegoers in droves
            enthralled by the sight of Geena Davis with a blonde
            dye-job, but more discriminating viewers will
            probably be put-off by the plot holes,
            inconsistencies, and downright silliness of the film.
            I mean, how many times *can* you outrun an explosion
            in one film, anyway?</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT
            starts with one hell of an idea -- suburban
            schoolteacher Samantha (Davis) has had amnesia for
            eight years, and when an escaped convict tries to
            kill her after he sees her on television, the truth
            of her past is slowly revealed. Along with private
            eye Mitch (Samuel L. Jackson), Samantha discovers the
            reality of her life -- she is a cold-blooded assassin
            in the employ of the CIA under deep cover, by the
            name of Charly.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Things go from bad to worse
            when everyone apparently wants the resurfaced and now
            out-of-date Charly out of the picture, and it becomes
            a game of cat and mouse with Charly's new goal
            becoming... well, we never really figure that out,
            but it involves killing a lot of people, and blowing
            up a lot of stuff.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Jackson is hilarious here in
            another PULP-y Jules-esque comic relief role, and
            Davis has the action-star makings of another
            Sigourney Weaver. And while the film on the whole is
            one exciting slam-bang actioner (directed by
            slam-bang director and Mr. Geena Davis, Renny
            Harlin), it's the glaring bits of incongruity that
            constantly bother the viewer. The conveniently placed
            props -- thin ice where it's needed, always a gun
            handy, kerosene in a child's doll (I still haven't
            figured that one out) -- and Harlin's insistence in
            pointing these out well in advance so we won't be
            scratching our heads when they inevitably enter the
            picture -- all of this gives the movie the feeling of
            a methodically-planned operation, executed with the
            skill of... well, a killer like Charly.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT has
            other problems, most notably a poor editing job,
            needed explanatory sequences obviously excised from
            the film, and a disconcerting similarity of Charly at
            the end of the film to MacGyver, but what's the point
            of worrying? In the end, you're likely to remember
            little but a lot of guns, explosions, and Geena's
            lovely hair.</font></p>

            src="../graphics/film/stars2h.gif" width="61"
            height="14">Or, as Meryl Streep might say, &quot;I
            had a bridge in Africa...&quot; Only a couple of
            wicked lions ate half my workers and the rest ran
            away.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">That's THE GHOST AND THE
            DARKNESS in a nutshell. And while it may be, as the
            press materials say, &quot;one of the most thrilling
            true stories ever told,&quot; it has somehow turned
            into one of the most boring movies of the year, owing
            to a downright dull directorial job by Stephen
            Hopkins and a surprisingly flat script by double
            Oscar-winner William Goldman.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Set during the rush to
            colonialize Africa in 1898, Val Kilmer stars as John
            Patterson, a bridge-builder working for the British
            railroad. Down in the belly of the country on
            assignment, two lions suddenly show up and begin
            decimating the crew, and no one is able to stop them.
            Even renowned hunter Charles Remington (Michael
            Douglas) is brought in, but the lions seem
            unstoppable. Hundreds are killed by these
            &quot;man-eaters,&quot; and the natives eventually
            give them the monikers, the Ghost and the Darkness --
            devils.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I'll admit, I think there's
            a story there, it's just not a movie, mainly because
            of the simplistic direction the film takes (no lions
            - lions - no lions). Everything is earnest in trying
            to convince the viewer that this is a True Story, I
            guess so you'll have a little more sympathy for the
            limp plotline. But like I said, THE GHOST AND THE
            DARKNESS keeps you waiting, and waiting, and
            waiting... and it just never revs up.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Combine this arrow-straight
            plot with a whole lot of gore (more than many people
            in the audience at my screening wanted -- as some of
            them left and never returned) and you get a picture
            that resembles a slasher movie much more than it does
            an action/drama.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">That's not an altogether bad
            thing, but it's certainly not what I was expecting.
            (Points only for cinematography, fine acting, and
            cool supporting characters.)</font></p>

            height="14"> There's a few legendary scripts among
            screenwriting circles -- scripts that people would
            *love* to rip off, if they could figure out how:
            WITNESS, CHINATOWN, NETWORK. And then there's
            TOOTSIE, the queen mother of comedy scripts, that
            gets ripped off all the time.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">THE ASSOCIATE is boilerplate
            TOOTSIE, lifting the entire plot structure from
            Dorothy's television world and dropping it on Wall
            Street, where Whoopi Goldberg finds herself forced to
            impersonate a man (named Cutty after Cutty Sark
            scotch) in order to be taken seriously.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">If you want to know all
            about it, just rent TOOTSIE, and you'll meet the
            principals of THE ASSOCIATE -- the confident (Dianne
            Wiest), the would-be-if-I-weren't-the-same-sex lover
            (Bebe Neuwirth), the rival (Tim Daly), and the wacky
            gang who fall for the trick. And you'll see familiar
            scenes -- Cutty is almost exposed, Cutty evades woman
            on the prowl, Cutty's big finish.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever. If THE ASSOCIATE
            were a *lot* funnier this might be forgivable, accent
            on might. As it is, THE ASSOCIATE is a relatively
            juvenile hit-and-miss affair that makes sexism look
            like it's just wacky hijinks. And more demerits for
            using stupid, not-remotely-realistic technology as a
            plot device.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Thank God the cast is good,
            with the exception of a miscast Daly (as a cutthroat
            Wall Street guy?). Dianne Wiest is awfully appealing
            in a Mrs. Claus sort-of way, and let me say right now
            that I see Bebe Neuwirth (you know, Frasier Crane's
            stodgy ex-wife) in a *completely* different light.
            And Goldberg... is Goldberg. If you like her, in
            general, you'll probably like her here, too.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Well, this is already more
            ink than this film deserves. Three stars on its
            merits; docked a half for blatant shamelessness. </font></p>

            height="14"> One reality in this world is certain:
            nice guys finish last. And while the case can be made
            that Primo and Secondo aren't the nicest guys around,
            it's pretty clear from the beginning of BIG NIGHT
            that they are doomed to be taken advantage of.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">This little gem, a darling
            of the festival circuit and cause for a huge rebirth
            in star, co-writer, co-producer, and co-director
            Stanley Tucci's career, tells the beautiful and
            touching story of two brothers (Tucci as Secondo, and
            &quot;Wings&quot; cab driver Tony Shalhoub as Primo)
            trying to make it as restaurateurs, straight off the
            boat from Italy.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Primo, the head chef,
            refuses to compromise on the tiniest detail regarding
            the food, while Secondo does battle on the business
            end. The meals they serve are second to none, but all
            the customers go down the street to their rival's (an
            Italian Ian Holm) thanks to his singing waiters. With
            the bank ready to foreclose, Primo and Secondo try to
            turn things around, and they put all they've got into
            one last feast in honor of jazz great Louis Prima,
            who may or may not actually be showing up. A big
            night indeed.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Intertwining the restaurant
            drama with the brothers' unsatisfying personal lives,
            Tucci and co-writer Joseph Tropiano tell a beautiful
            and touching story that resonates with a authenticity
            rarely found in today's films. Tucci, Shalhoub, and
            Holm are all excellent, as are Isabella Rossellini
            and CIRCLE OF FRIENDS's Minnie Driver as Secondo's
            love interests. Tucci and co-director Campbell Scott
            (co-star of SINGLES) also do excellent work
            considering their amateur status.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">While the film can get a bit
            talky at times (beware of the scenes with subtitles),
            it's overall a very moving and delightful first work
            for these guys. Deserving special notice are the
            exquisite cooking/dining scenes, which do for Italian
            food what EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN did for Chinese.
            All-in-all, it's a warm, funny, and at the same time
            heartbreaking look at one big night in the company of
            some truly interesting people.</font></p>

            else out there have a terrible time taking Jennifer
            Tilly seriously, no matter what role she plays? Well,
            I do, and her performance in BOUND is no exception to
            the rule.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Here, Tilly plays Violet, a
            mobster's wife with a plan to make off with $2
            million of the Mafia's money. Enlisting the aid of
            Corky (SHOWGIRLS's Gina Gershon), your everyday
            laborer/lesbian-next-door, the two ladies play a game
            of double-cross with the mob, with Violet's husband
            Caesar (RISKY BUSINESS's Joe Pantoliano) set to take
            the fall.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">As you might expect, it
            doesn't quite go according to plan, and as the bodies
            stack up, the stakes get higher and higher. If this
            sounds familiar, you're probably recalling FARGO,
            which is structured almost identically, but which is
            realized to a level of near-perfection that BOUND is
            sorely lacking.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">BOUND is a stylish thriller,
            emphasis on style. Writers-directors-brothers Andy
            and Larry Wachowski use an avant-garde and downright
            bizarre photographic motif of the extreme close-up
            variety. On the one hand this is interesting, and on
            the other it is quite annoying. The Wachowskis' style
            is so dynamic that it literally feels like the viewer
            is being pushed around, making BOUND a participative
            experience, like it or not.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">And to be perfectly honest,
            I'd rather not. Placing much more energy into
            &quot;looking cool,&quot; the script ends up falling
            a bit flat in areas where a little more complexity
            could have been used. Most notable in this regard is
            a dropped-in-your-lap ending that feels as if someone
            just forgot about it until the last second.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">But there's a lot of meat
            between the opening credits and that -- Pantoliano is
            a lot of fun as his now-instantly recognizable
            trollish tough guy, and the noirish feel to the
            picture really keeps you on the edge of your seat.
            Fans of the thriller genre will probably be
            moderately pleased, as I was, but will leave hungry
            for more.</font></p>

            <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><img
            src="../graphics/film/stars4.gif" width="61"
            height="14"> When you're a star as big as Tom Hanks,
            you can do whatever the hell your heart desires.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Such is the lesson to be
            taken away from THAT THING YOU DO!, Hanks's
            screenwriting and directorial debut. And just what is
            THAT THING YOU DO? Well, if you don't know, you must
            live in a cave, and a small one at that. The title
            refers to the one and only hit song of &quot;The
            Wonders&quot; (get it?). It is a song that is
            repeated throughout this film... over and over... in
            full or in part, a total of *11* times. I counted.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Hanks's ridiculously
            simplistic tale follows a couple of months in the
            lives of a small-time band from Erie, Pennsylvania,
            who almost by accident hit it big with their titular
            single. The cast is spearheaded by Tom Everett Scott,
            a young man who looks, sounds, and acts exactly like
            Hanks, and even has the same first name. Scott plays
            Guy, aka &quot;Shades,&quot; the group's drummer who
            is somehow alternately nerdy when he isn't being
            supercool. Add on moody frontman Johnathon Schaech,
            who looks down-right frightening, plus wisecracking
            Steve Zahn, and you've pretty much got the band.
            (Hanks plays the group's manager in later scenes.)</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">THAT THING YOU DO! takes The
            Wonders from playing talent shows to pizza parlors to
            getting a manager to a record deal to Billboard
            magazine to getting go-go dancers on stage with them,
            which is, I guess, as high as a music career ever
            gets. Then the band breaks up and the movie is over,
            and then you get to go home and go to sleep with the
            comfort that this is not a movie that's going to keep
            you up at night wondering about plot twists.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Without any bulky plot to
            get in the way of his perfectly linear story, Hanks
            is free to do what he does best -- crack jokes like
            he learned on &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; with
            then-co-star and THAT THING cameo-man Peter Scolari.
            It's funny in the same way that the aforementioned
            show was funny -- not witty, but good for an
            occasional laugh when someone falls down.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, everything is funny in
            this Tom Hanks world of peaches, cream, and racial
            harmony (this is supposed to be 1964). I don't know
            if you can blame Hanks alone for this senseless and
            totally obvious film that is devoid of emotion, but I
            hope that Hollywood takes from this the lesson that a
            big movie star does not a talented writer/director
            make. But I doubt they will.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">In all fairness, THAT THING
            YOU DO! is a pleasant film perfect for a brain-dead
            matinee, and the theme song is a catchy tune that
            gets your foot tapping quickly. And while the movie,
            like the song, has a nice beat and you can dance to
            it, why settle for this single when you can get a
            double CD's worth of fun or intrigue in the theater
            next door?</font></p>

            height="14"> If you've seen the trailer, the #1
            question on your mind about 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY must
            be: Is it a PULP FICTION rip-off, or is it a *bad*
            PULP FICTION rip-off? </font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the answer is this:
            Yes, it's a shameless PULP FICTION rip-off (more like
            PULP FICTION meets SHORT CUTS), but it's actually
            quite entertaining, in its own quirky little way.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">In fact, 2 DAYS IN THE
            VALLEY is the best (and possibly the last [hint,
            hint]) of these knockoffs to come down the
            interstate. The only problem is that writer/director
            John Herzfeld forgot one critical part: a cool
            soundtrack! The main difficult with 2 DAYS is an
            uncommonly lousy score that kills the suspense and
            the comedy with equal ability.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">But let's talk about the
            good parts, those mainly being the rich characters
            Herzfeld has created to act out his play. (Please pay
            attention.) It starts with Peter Horton (gets shot
            early on, a very big plus) as a deadbeat husband to
            downhill skier/aspiring scam artist Teri Hatcher.
            James Spader (by far the most fun of the film) and
            newcomer Charlize Theron as Hatcher's partners in
            crime. Danny Aiello as an aging hitman working with
            Spader. NAKED's Greg Cruttwell as Aiello's whining
            hostage. Glenne Headly as Cruttwell's bookish
            assistant. Marsha Mason as Cruttwell's
            nurse/half-sister. Paul Mazursky as a suicidal
            Hollywood has-been who is picked up by Mason. And
            Jeff Daniels and Eric Stoltz (the only PULP veteran
            in the show) as hapless cops on to all of these
            characters. (Plus there are at least three good<br>
            cameos.)</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Whew! D'you catch all that?
            It's easier than it sounds, trust me -- in fact, the
            fun of 2 DAYS is watching all the pieces come
            together via a mixture of slapstick comedy, generally
            witty dialogue, and blackly comedic gunfights,
            fistfights, dogfights, catfights, and any other kind
            of fight you can think of. All the while, Herzfeld
            manages to weave in unexpectedly powerful themes of
            bygone happiness, greed, and desperation... and The
            Valley. And Herzfeld manages to pack all of this into
            a very tight 105 minutes. There's very little wasted
            footage on the screen, which is hard to say about
            many directors today. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">It winds up as a solid
            picture that is probably accessible to a wider
            audience than PULP FICTION was -- there were plenty
            of squeamish girly types in the crowd, and no one
            walked out. And I was actually expecting a bad movie!
            Go figure.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">[Food for thought: When was
            the last time you could get gas in Los Angeles for
            $1.07, as is seen in the film? Talk amongst
            yourselves.]</font></p>

            height="14"> This year's low-budget success story and
            darling of the festival circuit, ED'S NEXT MOVE is
            one of a handful of recent pictures that is truly
            deserving of its praise.<br>
            <br>
            The Manhattan-based indie traces a few weeks in the
            life of urban greenhorn Eddie (Matt Ross), whose
            titular move is from the wide-open, cheesy state of
            Wisconsin to the dog-eat-dog world of New York City.
            Eddie, a genetics researcher and rice breeder, faces
            the world alone -- a stranger in a strange land. He
            lives in a cheap motel while he tries to find a
            non-psychotic roommate, can't get a simple hamburger
            at a restaurant, and finds his Midwestern
            sensibilities out of place in the big city. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">It's here that Eddie meets
            Lee (Callie Thorne), a brassy hipster trying to cut
            it as a musician. Eddie, in fine romantic comedy
            style, becomes smitten with Lee and tries to win her
            affections. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The result is a fine comedy
            from newcomer John Walsh, who directs his own script.
            In fact, just about everyone associated with the film
            is a newcomer, which works to the benefit of the
            picture by keeping everything fresh. Ross and Thorne
            are excellent actors, and because we've never seen
            them before, it's easy to suspend disbelief enough to
            buy them in their parts. (Also good is Kevin Carroll
            as Eddie's antithesis and roommate Ray.) </font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">With funny and fresh
            dialogue, a heap of production values considering the
            low budget, and a wide-appeal story that neither
            condescends to the audience nor enters the saccharine
            world of big-budget romantic comedies, ED'S NEXT MOVE
            is a winner for just about anyone's taste. (This
            critic laughed his proverbial butt off, that's for
            sure.) Be sure to watch for &quot;the mice
            scene&quot; -- the only comparable fall-down laughing
            sequence equivalent to last year's &quot;banana
            scene&quot; from THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">ED'S NEXT MOVE remains one
            of the better offerings of the year, by giving us a
            romantic comedy about people who could feasibly be
            friends of ours -- or could even be ourselves. My
            only hope is that Walsh can keep it up with his next
            picture.</font></p>

            src="../graphics/film/stars4.gif" width="61"
            height="14"> It's an old question of what's right and
            what's wrong: if you could cure a disease by killing
            one person, would you do it? That's basically the
            premise which starts up EXTREME MEASURES, an
            ultra-creepy little medical thriller by prolific
            filmmaker Michael Apted.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">If you can deal with the
            notion of Hugh Grant as a doctor, you've probably
            suspended disbelief enough to buy the whole
            production. Dr. Guy Luthan (Grant) finds a mystery
            patient in his trauma room at Gramercy Hospital. When
            the patient dies from a bizarre collection of
            symptoms, no one seems to care except for the dashing
            British doc.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Guy's investigation leads
            him into a conspiratorial cover-up in the hospital
            system, an underground dwelling of human moles, and a
            cryptic research lab where groundbreaking medicine is
            practiced -- on human subjects. What's more is that
            the head of the research lab is none other than Dr.
            Lawrence Myrick (Gene Hackman), one of the country's
            most respected physicians.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Blending the right amount of
            &quot;medical&quot; with just enough
            &quot;thriller,&quot; EXTREME MEASURES succeeds in
            giving the audience the willies from its opening
            scenes. Danny Elfman's creepiest score to date does a
            lot to help out, too, and Hackman is always good at
            getting you squirming in your seat. Lots of blood,
            surgical scars, and seizures are even more effective,
            giving cause to wonder, where was David Lynch when
            this movie was being made?</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Performances are fair to
            good, with the exception of supporting player Sarah
            Jessica Parker, who really isn't at home playing an
            unglamorous nurse. The 2-hour film moves along quite
            well, too, never getting too caught up in boring
            exposition while keeping the viewer informed with
            just enough backstory. On the other hand, there's not
            a whole lot of &quot;thrill&quot; to the picture,
            just background discomfort that's scarier than any
            horror flick.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Overall an above average
            movie, but EXTREME MEASURES gets bonus points for
            exposing the harsh truth about physicians and
            confirming my worst fears: they really are all evil.</font></p>

            color="#FFFFFF"> foisting their womanness on us with
            a vengeance. Sure to revive the debate over whether
            films like this are &quot;man hating,&quot; THE FIRST
            WIVES CLUB is, in reality, a harmless big screen
            sitcom that actually manages to appeal to a large
            audience.<br>
            <br>
            Rambling through its first 30 minutes with no real
            direction, THE FIRST WIVES CLUB eventually turns into
            a story about three old friends who want to exact
            vengeance on their wayward ex-husbands. Elise (Hawn)
            is an aging movie star, obsessed, as most aging movie
            stars are, about her looks. Brenda (Midler) is a
            bitter ex-housewife who loves her son and bemoans her
            lack of funds to support him -- and hasn't changed
            her hair since 1969. Annie (Keaton) is basically a
            middle-aged version of Annie Hall, only now she has a
            lesbian daughter and an intrusive mother, and Woody
            Allen is nowhere to be seen.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The most visible of the
            ex-husbands is Brenda's estranged hubby Morty (Dan
            Hedaya), an electronics kingpin who has moved on to
            the greener pastures of Shelly (Sarah Jessica
            Parker). He becomes the centerpiece of an intricate
            scam the women put together to basically drive the
            three husbands to madness, ruin, and poverty.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Hey! It's a comedy!</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I must admit, that for all
            its middle-aged woman-bent humor, THE FIRST WIVES
            CLUB still managed to be amusing to this 25 year-old
            man, mainly due to some really fine acting, good
            jokes, and a fresh story. Keaton is the best, as
            usual, and Hawn also does a fine job. Desperately
            trying to steal the show (and ending up as the only
            wife who I didn't really care about) is Midler. But
            when was the last time Midler played a character who
            *wasn't* an overbearing loudmouth?</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">It's also a manipulative
            little film -- pulling those heart strings about as
            hard as you can without jumping out of the comedy
            genre. There are loads of cameos -- the only person
            they forgot was Charles Nelson Reilly. Basically,
            everything works to give WIVES a sitcom feel (I
            wouldn't be surprised if they adapted it next
            season...). Just to seal the issue, they even put
            Bronson Pinchot in a supporting role. (Ironic fact:
            almost everyone behind the scenes of the film
            (including the director, screenwriter, and producer)
            is male.)</font></p>

            height="14"><font color="#FFFFFF">BASQUIAT -- or
            &quot;Sasquiatch,&quot; as I am becoming increasingly
            fond of calling this film -- may teach you a thing or
            two. Now you may not want to know any of the stuff
            you learn during its two long hours of running time,
            but like it or not, you will learn something.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">That something is a base
            level of information about Jean Michel Basquiat, a
            Haitian artist in the early 80's who became Andy
            Warhol's favorite son. (What is it with Warhol movies
            this year?) Basquiat rose from living in a cardboard
            box and decorating the streets of New York with
            cryptic graffiti to a high-profile yet short-lived
            career in the highest of art circles. All before his
            not-too-untimely death at the age of 27 from a (take
            a guess) *heroin* overdose.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Now hailed as something of a
            James Dean to the art world, Basquiat's bizarre life
            story is being told. The idea was apparently this:
            take every freak working in American cinema in the
            1990's and transform him or her info a freak who
            lived in the 1980's. And they got all the freaks --
            *all* of them -- starting with the granddaddy of all
            that is inexplicable, David Bowie (as Warhol), plus
            runners-up Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Gary
            Oldman, Benicio Del Toro, newcomer-freak Claire
            Forlani, Parker Posey, Willem Dafoe... Hell, they
            even got *Courtney Love* for God's sake! The freaks
            are here. All of them.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps the least freakish
            is he who plays Basquiat himself, soap star Jeffrey
            Wright, who flits from scene to scene in his
            be-dreadlocked hairdo (maybe a bit fancy for a guy
            living in a cardboard box), trying his best to keep
            up in the race to see Who Can Overact The Most. In
            this regard, Wright does well. And as you can
            imagine, this race runs the film right into the
            ground. Then again, it's a race that can be fun to
            watch at times.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I don't envy anyone the task
            of writing a screenplay about the short life of a
            not-universally known person, someone who was
            basically a strung-out junkie, overall a jerk of a
            guy, and whose sole talent was making what, in
            limited circles, must pass for avant-garde art.
            However, Julian Schnabel has taken this challenge,
            and in most regards, has failed, coming up with a
            self-indulgent work that captures what's going on in
            Schnabel's head, and that's about it. Basquiat's life
            is, from the start of the film to the finish,
            succinctly described by the first sentence of this
            paragraph -- little more than an wacko that was hyped
            into the big time. Not that that's suprising. It
            happens even more often today. It just doesn't
            deserve a *movie.*</font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Schnabel does pose one
            interesting dilemma -- when Basquiat is on drugs,
            he's (apparently) a brilliant artist. When he's
            clean, his art sucks. The question of &quot;Is it
            worth it?&quot; is an interesting one, but not too
            interesting. For Schnabel, it isn't interesting
            enough to justify an answer... and that's sad,
            because by the end of BASQUIAT, there are even fewer
            answers than when we started.</font></p>

    <h2><img src="../graphics/rudbeckia.jpg" width="285"
    height="188"></h2>
    <h2><font size="5" face="Arial"><strong>Seeing Black-Eyed
    Susan</strong></font></h2>
    <p><font size="3">As you contemplate the ruins of last
    summer's garden and ponder miracles for next year, give
    sunny, black-eyed Susans a chance to work some for you. This
    rustic native plant is the cover story of the summer 1996
    issue of The Quarterly Journal of The Perennial Plant
    Association, and that's a considerable endorsement.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The Quarterly is a small magazine published
    for nurserymen, wholesalers, and other members of the
    Perennial Plant Association. It's not exactly the Vogue or
    Harper's of the gardening world since its only color picture
    is on the cover. The editors deal with subjects of particular
    interest to their membership, and they're the people who
    decide what our garden centers will be selling in the years
    ahead. Since you and I buy what's available -- trust me,
    we're going to be growing rudbeckia. And we're going to love
    it!</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Only the naive still think of black-eyed
    Susans as field flowers. I was a member of the group when we
    first moved into this house. After the party-pretty pink
    flowers of our weeping cherry tree had gone by, I was not
    enchanted to see this big swath of large, coarse, dark green
    leaves fill out under the tree. When by mid or late June a
    few brash yellow daisies with sooty black centers came into
    bloom it was like the moonlight sonata being followed by hard
    rock.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The rudbeckia were allowed to remain that
    year only because I have learned the hard way that digging up
    a garden at a new house before you've seen it through a
    12-month cycle is a mistake only the very rich can afford.
    They were still in place three years later only because they
    performed so well that ripping them out never became a
    priority. It was the famous landscape design duo, Jim van
    Sweden and Wolfgang Oehme, who taught me their real value. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Jim and Wolfgang are the chief architects
    of America's love affair with the naturalistic New American
    Garden and its grassy prairie-meadow look. They helped me
    compile the ornamental grasses lists for National Arboretum
    Book of Outstanding Garden Plants, and later for the American
    Horticultural Society Flower Finder. The grasses are grouped
    according to specific uses -- for shade, for wet places, etc
    -- and each list is accompanied by a group of &quot;companion
    plantings. <i>Rudbeckia fulgida</i> var. <i>sullivantii
    'Goldsturm'</i> was mentioned so often I had to stop snubbing
    my plants.. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">When I am going to write about a subject, I
    usually try to visualize it. So I began to &quot;see&quot;
    black-eyed Susans with the other companion plants they were
    recommending -- lily flowered tulips, jade green <i>Sedum
    spectabile</i> 'Autumn Joy,' fern-leaved yarrow <i>Achillea
    filipendula</i> 'Coronation Gold', purple coneflower <i>Echinacea
    purpurea,</i> <i>Liriope platyphylla </i>'Majestic', and
    soaring sky-blue Russian sage, <i>Perovskia atriplicifolia</i>.
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The tulips die back, of course, but I
    &quot;saw&quot; that the others provide three and even four
    months of continuous color and that the strong gold of the
    coneflower disc with its dramatic black eyed is very good.
    And as I learned later, when you let plant groups like this
    go to seed in the garden, their dessicated structures provide
    food for birds, and have a wonderful wild, cosy look when
    fallen leaves drift up around them, and snow comes.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Our rudbeckias, which I now think of by the
    tonier name of coneflower, are still thick and beautiful in
    spite of the fact that the tree has grown and leafed out so
    that they get less and less sun. The colony has moved out
    toward the brighter light on the edge of the drop line of the
    cherry tree. They bloom in mid to late June and one or two
    small blooms still shine now in mid October as the leaves
    come tumbling down. Weeds don't have a chance in the shade of
    their dense dark foliage.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">I've never had to water them. A tree expert
    we engaged to check out the symptoms of fire blight in our
    cherry tree said the rudbeckias were OK there. However, he
    recommended I remove the impatiens I had started to grow
    behind the rudbeckias. He said the water and fertilizer most
    flowers need in August can encourage diseases in trees that
    aren't used to being pampered that time of year. One more
    plus for rudbeckias.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Our plants probably are 'Goldsturm.' A
    four-year study reported in that issue of the PPA Quarterly
    suggests it's the best one for gardens. A rhizomatous species
    that spreads slowly, it gets to be 18 to 30 inches tall. It's
    the showiest, the earliest to bloom, and has the longest
    period of flowering. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">For the garden with a somewhat damp
    situation, 'Goldquelle' would be a good choice. It's a
    beautiful cultivar of R. lacianata the wild coneflower that
    blooms at the edge of moist woodlands from Quebec to Florida,
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">For a large gardens, and for the back of
    the border, <i>R. nitida</i> 'Herbstonne' ('Autumn Sun') is
    probably the best choice. It develops very dense four- to
    five-foot clumps with upright, branching stalks and blooms
    non-stop throughout July and August even in high heat that
    shuts most other flowers down. The flowers are big, showy
    heads of drooping clear yellow ray florets surrounding a
    central greenish disk. They are likely to need support as
    storms may knock the plants over, especially in the South. It
    is somewhat less hardy than the other species but it is one
    of the finest coneflowers. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">For a flowering field, or a wild flower
    garden , choose the aggressively spreading self-sowing
    annual/biennial <i>R. hirta</i> . The flower is smaller than
    the cultivars mentioned above, but very similar, and it can
    stand a lot of heat and drought. <i>R. triloba</i> is
    recommended for damp meadows. Plant<i> Boltonia</i> with it,
    and Queen Anne's lace, and let thistles come in if they're in
    the right place.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Seeds, of various rudbeckia species and
    cultivars are available in at garden centers and from mail
    order catalogs now. Come spring you'll find seedlings and
    root divisions are garden centers. If you are looking for the
    wild varieties, try catalogs specializing in native plants.
    They're are more and more rudbeckias getting ready to bring
    small miracles to your garden this coming year.</font></p>

    <font size="5"><strong>Memories of Flower Power at the White
    House</strong></font></p>
    <p>When the garden goes to sleep, do you get this deep,
    gnawing hunger for fresh flowers? One way I get around it is
    to pick flowers from some of my houseplants -- a cyclamen
    blossom and the tip of a fern frond, for example, makes a
    sweet little nosegay, and a geranium set in a tip sprig of
    variegated pothos is adorable. </p>
    <p>But of course, I also feast on perfumed and pampered
    florists' flowers. Some of the most elegant, simple,
    arrangements I've ever seen were created by a veteran White
    House florist Rusty Young. I interviewed him years ago for
    Family Circle Magazine shortly before he retired. The flowers
    he worked with came from the wholesale market and even from
    the supermarket, but in Rusty's hands they became
    arrangements fit for a First Lady! </p>
    <p>The White House florist quarters then were on the lower
    level opposite the library, an open space with light, bright
    working surfaces, rows of gorgeous vases, and a glass-fronted
    walk-in cold room. Rusty told me that to make the bouquets
    last, he had them stored in the cold room overnight. Even so,
    he said the budget often ran out towards the end of the
    fiscal year, and during his tenure assorted floral crises
    were solved by getting permission to raid some of
    Washington's famous private gardens. </p>
    <p>Rusty's regular assignments included making fresh flower
    arrangements weekly for the five small formal parlors that
    are part of the White House public tour. He also prepared
    bouquets for the Presidential family's private living
    quarters. The greatest fun, and trauma, of course, was
    preparing for great state receptions. He admired Jackie
    Kennedy, the first First Lady during Rusty's regime to
    combine fresh fruits and vegetables with blossoms in
    centerpieces for state dinners. </p>
    <p>My magazine assignment included photographing Rusty making
    an arrangement for one of the formal parlors. For container
    he chose a small golden goblet, then he picked out a handful
    of flowers suited to the form of the vase and the colors in
    the parlor -- some to complement, some for diversity, some
    for contrast. Rusty then positioned a handful of attractive
    greens so that the stems created a mesh that would hold the
    flower stems in place. Before placing the flowers, he cut
    each stem to a length that would place it at a specific
    height, and stripped foliage that would be under water where
    it might rot. </p>
    <p>It's a quick way to anchor flower stems, especially useful
    when you have many to make, and makes it easy to pull up the
    flowers so that you can recut them often. A daily recutting
    and change of water helps prolong a flower's vase life. </p>
    <p>All Rusty's designs had elegance, whether destined for a
    formal parlor, or the private living quarters upstairs. Two I
    remember as especially beautiful are these: </p>
    <p><b>Green parlor: </b></p>
    <p>Here the walls are covered with green watered silk, and
    the Duncan Phyfe settee that dominates the room is striped
    rose and green. Rusty's bouquet was dominated by rose, gold,
    and green. </p>
    <p><em>Foliage greens: </em>stems of deep green podocarpus</p>
    <p><em>Fillers:</em><b> </b>white daisy mums with lots of
    ferny foliage showing</p>
    <p><em>Secondary flowers:</em> white snapdragons, blue
    larkspur, pink daisy mums, and gold button mums</p>
    <p><em>Stars:</em> purple anemones, and yellow tulips</p>
    <p><b>Child's room in the family quarters:</b> </p>
    <p>This was a dainty pink and white bouquet arranged in a
    low, oval vase of forest green with a white pattern: </p>
    <p><em>Foliage greens:</em> sprigs of podocarpus;
    baby's-breath; </p>
    <p><em>Secondary flowers:</em> pink sweet peas, and white
    narcissus; </p>
    <p><em>Stars:</em><b> </b>tightly-budded pink sweetheart
    roses </p>

    <p>Nurserymen and catalog people are feisty, irascible,
    creative dreamers, and they dance up a storm given a chance,
    which isn't every week, nor even every year. The way they are
    is easier to understand when you know that most started their
    own businesses, worry all the time about going broke because
    so many do, are jealous of the quality of their products, and
    love plants with a passion only the best Shakespearean
    sonnets can express adequately. Many classy catalogs are, or
    started out, as mom-and-pop operations where mom, pop, and
    the kids, risk everything all the time and often earn less
    than the minimal hourly wage. </p>
    <p>I expect the new kid on the catalog block will, like other
    talented nurserymen who have survived, develop the grace of a
    high wire act and learn to be tough. But for now, Scott
    Kunst's Old House Gardens catalog of antique bulbs has all
    the earmarks of a nurseryman very much in love. A bright
    mauve jacket wraps its 32 pages, and it is lovingly
    illustrated by old wood blocks and line art. Along with each
    offering, Scott includes a paeon of praise, the date the
    plant was introduced (the oldest is checkered lily `Alba' -- <i>Fritillaria
    meleagris</i>), and tasty tidbits of its history and place in
    horticulture. </p>
    <p>For example, the text accompanying the headily perfumed
    tuberose `Mexican Single' (<i>Polianthes tuberosa</i>)
    includes a paragraph explaining that the Aztecs grew and
    loved this exquisite plant, holding it sacred as their god of
    art, beauty, and love. It had arrived in Europe by 1530, and
    200 years later was growing in Williamsburg, Scott tells us.
    It probably still grows there, since Scott sells to
    Williamsburg, as well as to Monticello and other famous
    historic gardens. </p>
    <p>If you love perfume, by the way, try tuberoses. The stem
    rises straight up from the bulb, almost like the stem of a
    small allium, then a small, pure white flower unfolds and
    fills the air with the exquisite scent of orange blossoms and
    hyacinths. I plant them by the handful every week or two in
    June, scattering them in beds near the porch steps and under
    windows that we open at night. </p>
    <p>It's late in the season to be starting tuberoses for
    anyone who doesn't live in the South, but just about right
    for ordering spring flowering bulbs. Scott's collection
    includes other wonderfully fragrant plants you rarely see in
    modern gardens. There's the sweetly scented deep yellow
    Double Campernelle narcissus (Narcissus x (small cap, Roman)
    odorus `Plenus', a double that appeared in the catalogs your
    Great Great Grandmother studied! </p>
    <p>For indoor forcing, there's the Chinese Sacred Lily,
    Narcissus tazetta variety orientalis. Lush compared to its
    modern counterpart, the Israeli paperwhite, it is a
    wonderfully perfumed bunch-flowered narcissus. The Victorians
    called it the Lien Chu Lily, or Jos Flower. Outdoors, it
    blooms November to January in gardens of the Gulf Coast and
    Southern California. </p>
    <p>Scott has located some interesting antique crocuses,
    including `Cloth of Gold' (Crocus susianus aka S.
    angustifolius) which dates back to 1587, some lovely old
    double hyacinths, and even a few rare old fragrant tulips
    like the Single Early sweetly scented `Generaal de Wet',
    (spelling is correct) which has a gold base flushed and
    netted with deep orange and `Prince of Austria', an intense
    red-maturing-to-orange. The most fragrant of all the tulips,
    in Scott's garden, he says, it grows so vigorously that
    &quot;it increases from year to year with no special
    effort.&quot; </p>
    <p>That's another neat thing about this baby catalog: it has
    lots of interesting observations and suggestions. For
    example, Scott says that to make tulips last from year to
    year the most important thing is to keep them dry during the
    summer. (I've heard this said of many of the spring flowering
    bulbs.) Most often tulips start out in beds that later are
    filled with bedding annuals which need watering all summer
    long. Scott suggest you test a handful of tulip bulbs where
    you never water in the summer and see if they don't come
    back. </p>
    <p>The tulip variety counts, too: Scott said many of his come
    back when they are planted in full sun and in well drained
    soil fertilized in late winter and after flowering. Scott
    lets the foliage ripen before cutting it back, avoids
    disturbing nearby soil, and plants his bulbs 12 inches deep.
    For Zone 8 and warmer, Scott recommends buying pre-chilled
    tulips, or chilling them yourself in the refrigerator for a
    few weeks before planting them in the late fall. </p>
    <p>Scott ends his hints and tips on tulips with a quote from
    Elizabeth von Arnim's Elizabeth and Her German Garden (1898):
    &#147;I love tulips better than... any other spring flower;
    they are like a wholesome freshly tubbed young girl...Their
    faint, delicate scent is refinement itself...&#148; </p>
    <p>Scott was a school teacher until this year when he gave
    that up to devote himself full time to locating,
    authenticating, and selling antique bulbs. The conversion
    from class to nursery wasn't an overnight affair. Scott
    started out innocently enough about 15 years ago by buying a
    house built circa 1870 in Ypsilanti, MI. The old single white
    peonies enchanted him, and the old fashioned tiger lilies and
    privet hedge. He &quot;didn't want to mess up what was
    there&quot; so he consulted literature, and started
    researching older gardens. This lead to a degree in historic
    preservation, then to lectures and contributions to
    magazines. In 1983 he opened up for business as a landscape
    historian. When he began to search for bulbs for his clients
    gardens, he learned that most older varieties are very
    difficult to buy. What he found he multiplied, and in 1993
    published the first Old House Gardens' bulb catalog. </p>
    <p>I've always wanted to have an antique garden. It seems to
    be that as each plant comes into bloom, it would take me back
    to other centuries -- maybe ghostly lads in plumes and
    lassies in trailing skirts would haunt the afterdusk -- maybe
    snatches of bygone poetry would be wafted on the air along
    with the fragrances of these bygone flowers... It could
    happen, maybe, if one went to the garden in a very open mood </p>
    <p>Meanwhile, I hold the catalog and dream and wish Scott
    well. The catalog's $2. a pop. I'll remind you that Scott has
    just quit his job as a teacher, so giving the catalog away
    probably isn't an option. The address is Old House Gardens,
    536 Third Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48103. Tell him Jacqui sent
    you. </p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The landscaping season is just getting under way in and
    around the Capitol. A favorite spot of mine is the <b>Tulip
    Library</b>, a neat garden located between the Tidal basin
    and the Jefferson Memorial. There are about 100 small beds,
    each planted with one to two hundred varieties of tulips,
    most of them samples of the tulips that bloom around town.
    Early this month you may still be in time to see some of the
    lovely little species tulips that have been planted there
    this year for the first time at the recommendation of <b>Rob
    DeFeo</b>, chief horticulturist for the National Park
    Service. Species tulips come back in my garden, along with
    the tall tulips that the squirrels steal and bury in the
    pachysandra, but other tulips rarely bloom a second time for
    me. As I understand tulipology, after they bloom, the mother
    bulbs of the big beautiful Dutch tulips make bulblets instead
    of making flowers for next year's blooming. </p>
    <p>The flowers in the Tulip Library always look gorgeous, so
    I asked Rob the secret of his success, expecting to lectured
    about adding humus and a fall fertilization. Rob's answer
    surprised me. The beds are rototilled in the fall, he said,
    and tested for nutrient deficiencies. If none shows up, Rob
    doesn't add anything ( he just has the beds rototilled and
    plants the bulbs<b> four to six inches deep </b>for species
    tulips, and <b>four to eight inches deep</b> for the big
    tulips. I was pleased to learn, by the way, that these tulips
    are no more sacrosanct to squirrels than yours or mine. The
    only way the Park Service can be sure of saving the bulbs
    from the little darlings is to cover the beds with wire mesh
    that is removed when the tips begin to come up in spring. </p>
    <p>Rob's advise to us is:<b> never fertilize without knowing
    what the need is, only fertilize to replace a nutrient that
    is in short supply</b>. <b>The Park Service apparently
    considers runoff of fertilizers potentially as destructive to
    the Bay as pesticides, so they are used only when really
    necessary</b>. &#147;No farmer plants without running a soil
    test, and he does it every year.&#148; Rob said he's tried
    putting bonemeal into a tulip planting hole to see if it
    makes a difference, and he said he didn't see any special
    benefit. Rob said the Extension Services at the state
    university will test your soil for you. You also can buy soil
    testing kits that will report on the presence of the primary
    nutrients nitrogen, phosphorous, potash (NPK). Local
    nurseries I am sure, sell pH testing kits for something under
    $18. And for about $31, you can buy a kit that tests the NPK
    as well as the pH. </p>
    <p>The Tulip Library's season in the sun is short, but the
    14,000 trees on the Capitol grounds, and in the parks around
    DC, are always there, and always worth a visit even after the
    cherry blossoms go by. These great woody plants are among the
    most complex organic structures on the planet and those in DC
    are always in extraordinarily good condition. The huge old
    trees here on the Hill have deeply fissured bark and gnarly
    limbs and some have been here for a century and more. The
    National Park Service takes their trees very seriously
    indeed, and now that funds are short, they're interested in
    donated trees. The program that accepts donations is called <b>`Blossoms
    in Our Future,'</b> and over 1000 trees have already been
    donated to DC by people from all over the world. Many
    contributions to buy cherry trees have come from tourists
    from Japan, who visited when the cherry trees originally
    donated by Japan were in bloom. Others come from people
    interested in having a tree planted in someone's memory.
    Donated trees are numbered, and a central data base records
    the names of donors, those to whom the trees are dedicated,
    and where the donated trees are located. The cost of donating
    a tree is $250, and donors receive certificate of
    appreciation as well as a map showing location of tree
    donated. </p>
    <p>Another interesting perspective on the use of fertilizer
    came from <b>Wally Reed</b>, a horticulturist at the US
    Botanic Garden. I asked him about the height and the
    brilliance of the six-foot foxgloves and the delphinium that
    were so prominent in the delightful `Charlotte's Web' exhibit
    which has just ended. Wally told me they are a cultivar named
    `Foxy'. I thought I'd written `Foxy' up in <b>The American
    Horticultural Society Flower Finder Book </b>as a dwarf of <i>Digitalis
    purpurea</i>. I looked it up, and by golly, it is! So how
    come a dwarf is a six-foot giant, all whistles and bells?
    (One of the less entertaining aspects of being an author is
    that your mistakes are recorded in print in long lasting
    books!) </p>
    <p>So I called the DC Village, which is the Botanic Garden's
    growing facility, and contacted the gardener who grew those
    spectacular plants, Debbie Went. &#147;It's `Foxy' all right,
    &#147; said Debbie, &#147;and the delphiniums are the Pacific
    Giant strain.&#148; Reluctantly, she told me her grower's
    secret: the plants were started last fall, grown in cool
    greenhouses so they developed very slowly over many months,
    and at the same time they were kept on a constant-feed
    fertilizer program. In other words, we'd never see foxgloves
    or delphiniums like that in our back yard even if we stood on
    our heads to get them going unless we lived in the cool
    Pacific Northwest, or in New England. </p>
    <p>But constant feeding can have a place in our plants lives,
    Wally suggested. He said to see what happens when you use a <b>tiny
    bit</b> of a high nitrogen liquid fertilizer, such as
    20-20-20, every time you water your plants as a foliar feed.
    He said almost any annual will respond to that treatment with
    lush (if not six-foot) growth, and mentioned impatiens,
    petunias, and salvia. He also said `Miracle Grow' fertilizer
    could be used. </p>
    <p>And by the way, have you visited the brand new gift shop
    at the Botanic Garden? It opened mid March, and is staffed by
    the fund-raising branch of the Botanic garden, <b>the
    National Fund for US Botanic Garden</b>. They are something
    of a parallel to FONA, <b>Friends Of The National Arboretum.</b>
    The group was recently authorized by Congress, and their
    primary aim is to get together the funds needed to begin work
    on <b>The National Garden</b> which will some day grace the
    blunted wedge that occupies the space beyond the Botanic
    Garden west wall between Independence Avenue, Third Street
    and Maryland Avenue. Ground breaking is hoped for late this
    year or early 1997. </p>

    <p>The recipe for happiness on a cold March day with bare
    trees whistling in the wind and gray clouds whipping across
    the sky, is to dream up a summer garden. I asked my friend
    Helmut Jaehnigen, head of the woody plants department at
    Behnke's, what is the most exciting flower that he will plant
    in his garden this summer and got a surprising answer. Helmut
    just loves summer bulbs, and above all other he loves the <b>canna</b>,
    that regal flower that looks like a water iris painted by a
    rainbow. </p>
    <p>I told him I'd tried growing <b>canna</b> from seed once,
    got a single seedling from a whole package, nurtured it with
    tender, loving care, and planted it in the one square foot of
    sunlight available in my garden where it sure didn't do much!
    </p>
    <p>Helmut said &quot;Don't plant seed! Plant rhizomes!&quot;
    And if you have any doubts about the rhizomes, buy canna
    already up and flourishing in a container. Garden centers
    sell both. </p>
    <p>My other close encounter with canna occurred a couple of
    years ago when a neighbor on Capitol Hill planted several
    cannas in an empty street well. The canna got so tall they
    rivaled the baby tree next door, and by the end of summer
    produced flowers any jungle would be proud of. The foliage
    was lush, like a highly-colored corn-plant gone mad, and the
    flowers came in orange, yellow, apricot and pink, all the hot
    colors of the rainbow and some were multi-hued. They looked
    more beautiful just standing there with cars whizzing by than
    they usually do in stiff regiments massed in municipal
    plantings. </p>
    <p>But where I've seen canna look so gorgeous you really want
    to grow it, is in a photo of a small home garden of mixed
    perennials and annuals. No, I am not crazy. Canna is the most
    outstanding plant in the photo of Linda Yang's little
    Manhattan garden which appears in her 'The City Gardener's
    Handbook' (Random House). Linda writes the garden column for
    'The New York Times.' I liked that garden so well I used the
    photo in 'The American Horticultural Flower Finder' (Simon
    &amp; Schuster). </p>
    <p>Linda's garden is locked between city walls and has a
    difficult mix of hot sunny spots and shade. The garden is
    mostly lush greens and Linda has planted it in such a way
    that it is soft and green, and filled with exciting contrasts
    in foliage color, texture, and structure. Looking at the
    photo as I write, I can identify the dainty, hand-like
    foliage of andromeda, (<i>Pieris japonica</i>), astilbes,
    maidenhair ferns, the skyrocketing leaves of a mid-height
    ornamental grass, patches of silver dusty miller reaching for
    the clouds, rounded mounds of thyme, variegated hostas,
    thistles, roses, and growing up from a bucket of water, the
    broad undulating leaves of a lotus. These are shaped like
    wide, very shallow bowls - inverted parasols. Do you know
    that when the morning breeze stirs lotus stems, drops of dew
    roll around shining like diamonds in sunlight and they hold
    rain for hours after a shower? There across from the lotus on
    the other side of the flagstone path that zigzags through the
    underbrush, is a clump of four or five tall red-flowered
    canna. Not one of the new small cannas: it's a great big one
    and it looks graceful and just plain gorgeous! </p>
    <p><img src="../graphics/writers/jaqui.gif" width="116"
    height="212"> </p>
    <p>The tropical look of the lavish flowers are why Helmut
    plants canna, he said, but what he loves about the plant is
    that it flourishes in our steaming hot summers. &quot;Canna
    comes from India where our humid heat is
    characteristic,&quot; Helmut said, &quot;so it's at home
    here.&quot; I associate India with the kind of rain that
    shoots water in solid silver sheets off the roof down onto
    the nandina in our back yard - monsoon rains, first cousin to
    typhoons. Helmut says canna can handle all that as long as
    the plants are deadheaded when the flowers go by. Deadheading
    also keep flowers coming. </p>
    <p>The tall variety of cannas in Linda's garden, which
    appears to be much deeper than it is wide, are an exciting
    vertical element in a sea of wide-spreading foliage plants.
    But for a small, shallow garden, and for containers, Helmut
    recommends the 18-inch canna. The <b>Pfitzer's Dwarfs,</b>
    cultivars 24 to 36 inches high, would be perfect for the
    middle of a large border. The magnificent 3- to 4-foot group
    are the <b>Crozy or French cannas</b>. Plant the rhizomes in
    spring after danger of frost in full sun or light shade in
    well-drained fertile humusy soil and keep the soil damp. Set
    dwarf strains 5 inches deep 12 inches apart; place large
    cannas 24 inches apart. Cannas aren't hardy here, so you'll
    have to lift them for the winter, or replant new rhizomes the
    next year. The flowers from bulbs of every sort tend to be
    most spectacular the first year after planting so if you can
    buy new rhizomes for the next planting. </p>
    <p>In addition to cannas, Helmut plants <b>gladiolas for
    cutting flowers</b> - and was quick to agreed they just don't
    work in a flowering border. Most other summer flowering bulbs
    are good cutting flowers, too, and can be fitted into the
    garden. The <b>majestic lilies</b>, the <b>belladonna lilies</b>
    (which can stand most of our winters if well mulched), the <b>peacock
    orchid</b>, share the season with <b>the brilliant poppy
    anemones</b>, <b>crocosmia,</b> and <b>Galtonia,</b> the
    lovely summer hyacinth. There are sweet smaller bulb flowers
    for summer, brilliant <b>little Ixia and Sparaxis,
    Zephyranthes, </b>the little rain lily<b>, and the tuberose</b>,
    whose perfume is intoxicating - there's no other word to
    describe it's fragrance! The <b>caladiums,</b> of course, are
    beautiful: one of Helmut's favorite combinations is the
    lovely white caladium with green veins called 'Candidum Jr'
    (see photo inset) growing with white tuberous begonias in an
    all-white moon garden. The brilliant red caladium called
    'Frieda Hemple' is fabulous with bright red impatiens. </p>
    <p>Like canna, the summer flowering bulbs are set out in mid
    spring and begin to flower six to eight weeks after planting,
    about when nights begin to really warm up. They go on
    flowering and make wonderful splashes of color just when the
    garden needs color most, late in the season. Many bloom on
    until mid-September. </p>

    <p>As though you didn't know, SurferMania - and I do refer to
    surfing the Internet and other electronic highways - is
    sweeping the garden world. It's a revolution and I'm here to
    tell you, it's irresistible! That's the word from an honest
    four-thumbed electronics nerd. </p>
    <p>I'm not going to drop bauds and Ram and Mbytes on you. (I
    don't know what those words mean, anyway.) But I do want you
    to know that the electronic universe has a whole lot of offer
    gardeners. </p>
    <p>I was among the unconverted until October when I attended
    the Garden Writers Association of America 1995 symposium.
    This year's seminars addressed the ownership of electronic
    copyrights - suddenly a huge issue. Don't give electronic
    rights of anything away to anybody, not even your mother. </p>
    <p>They also gave us a look at some of the products being
    created for gardeners. It's staggering. </p>
    <p>To quote the GWAA's newsletter, the 'Quill &amp; Trowel':
    &quot;There is so much botany, horticulture, and gardening on
    the Internet that if you started today and you were 40 years
    old, you would be 116 by the time you had read it all, and
    that's if there were no new postings. </p>
    <p>It's true! Surfing the Internet, you can access The
    Virtual Garden at the Time Warner's Website. It includes an
    Interactive Searchable Garden Encyclopedia. Just click your
    question and the screen responds with encyclopedia largess.
    Typical of Internet websites, the material in The Virtual
    Garden will be free this year. Next year, who knows?
    Eventually, they're going to try to earn back the money spent
    on putting product out there for you and me. It's free now
    because the companies are thinking of their investment as
    advertising, marketing, market testing, and investment. </p>
    <p>Time Warner's Encyclopedia consists of a huge 3,000-plant
    data base. From The Virtual Garden you can also access all
    the magazines and books published by Time Warner properties,
    including Sunset and Southern Living Magazines, Alan Lacy's
    Homeground Newsletter, and the New York Botanical garden. </p>
    <p>That part is like having a heap of magazines and books the
    size of a very large mountain. But there are all sorts of
    other fascinating things there, too. A couple of weeks ago
    The American Orchid Society Website became part of The
    Virtual Garden. </p>
    <p>Tons more is coming through the pipeline both for The
    Virtual Garden and for Internet itself. New garden webs
    (think &quot;site&quot; &quot;destination&quot;) are added to
    the Internet almost daily. GWAA now has a web page. The
    American Horticultural Society is about to go on line.
    Longwood and many other botanic and public gardens are
    already on board garnering praise. </p>
    <p>That's online publishing. A lot of the stuff there is
    related to material that has already been published in print
    form. </p>
    <p>Then there are the not-on-line pioneers publishing
    gardening CDs - gardening CDs developed from scratch
    specifically for the computer screen. These publishers are
    new, lean, hungry, and they are producing some fabulous
    products! </p>
    <p>A CD that's hot right now is Horticupia's 1995 Perennials
    and Annuals. Pop the Horti disk into the CD drive and you get
    a screenful of pleasant graphic images representing plant
    attributes. What you are actually looking at is a head
    gardener with an incredible store of information and he's in
    there waiting to answer almost any question your fingers can
    command. </p>
    <p>Asking Horti 95 questions isn't difficult. You click your
    mouse on images representing the information you want, and
    Horti leads you through a simple process that gives the
    answers - and even prints them out. </p>
    <p>For instance: &quot;how many and which white perennials
    bloom in late spring?&quot; To set the question up, you click
    on white in the color wheel, on P for Perennials, on the box
    representing late spring, and on Show. Horti tells you how
    many, and shows you their names, common, and botanical. It
    will even give you the Latin pronunciation if your computer
    has speakers. </p>
    <p>You can also call up a first rate photo of each plant by
    clicking on its name. The photo will lead you to any
    information you need, precise, simple, and good how-to
    information on growing the plant. </p>
    <p>(By the way, the answer to that question is: there are 36
    white flowered perennials that bloom in late spring beginning
    with Ajuga repens which I never think of as having white
    varieties but Hortus 111 agrees.) </p>
    <p>This CD includes much more information than I have time to
    describe, including plants for naturalizing, drying,
    xeriscapes, a garden of natives, etc. I could rhapsodize. </p>
    <p>While I am fascinated with what Horti 95 can do, I'm just
    as fascinated by the couple that founded the company that
    publishes the Horti library, Desops Inc., 540 338-9147,
    Purcellville, VA. I think they're the wave of the future - a
    really neat future for moms and pops who'd rather not commute
    to work. </p>
    <p>Desops is the company created by Anne and Manfred Muecke.
    Experienced software developers, they wanted a business of
    their own, one that would require a modest initial
    investment. Anne's passion for gardening set the direction.
    Their first garden CD was published in 1994. 'Horti
    Perennials and Annuals' is their second, developed with Dr.
    Robert E. Lyons, Professor of Horticulture at Virginia Tech.
    In January 'Horticopia Trees, Shrubs and Ground Covers' will
    be released. </p>
    <p>Who's buying? High end gardeners, professional landscape
    architects and designers, garden centers, and educators.
    Desops sells mail order, distributes through 'Wetsel Seeds',
    'Sensible Software', garden centers, extension agents,
    university libraries, botanic gardens, and wherever there's
    interest. </p>
    <p>&quot;Distribution is everything in publishing,&quot; Anne
    says, &quot;we see ourselves as pioneers in a burgeoning
    industry. We're open to suggestions from interested
    gardeners, garden centers, botanic gardens.&quot; </p>
    <p>Horti 95 is not unique. Lady Bird Johnston's group has
    published a wildflower CD that allows you to input your
    region and learn about the wildflowers there. There are
    others - not quantities yet but they're coming. </p>
    <p>Pioneering is what this country has always been about. A
    new world is growing up around us and I guess 1996 is the
    year we're all going to discover it. See you on the Net -
    sooner than you think! Happy 1996! </p>

<blockquote>
    <h2><font size="5"><em><strong>The Road To Garden Writing</strong></em></font></h2>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>When you ask garden writers how they got involved, you
    find that few started out as horticulturists. Most of us just
    fell in love. At the Garden Writers Association's annual
    meeting last month I shared a hotel room with Ellen Spector
    Platt. Ellen designs gorgeous dried flower arrangements and
    wreaths and has a full time career writing and lecturing on
    her subject. Her sequay into garden writing is a case in
    point: she's a career psychologist who just couldn't keep her
    hands out of the dirt. </p>
    <p>&quot;The switch from psychologist to flower designer
    wasn't a planned change,&quot; Ellen told me. &quot;Weeding
    got me into it.&quot; After years as a full-time psychologist
    and parent, dinner on the table at the same time every night,
    once she'd seen the last child off to college she found she
    couldn't stay out of the garden. </p>
    <p>The transfer from brain to beauty began in 1985, the year
    Ellen made her first small efforts at drying flowers from her
    garden - delphinium, larkspur, roses. That summer she got
    together with a few crafts people and had an open house and
    craft sale in the barn that came with the old Pennsylvania
    farmhouse Ellen and husband Ben call home. Ellen's designs
    got a wonderful response, so the next year she made a few
    more. And each year a few more than the year before. </p>
    <p>Word of Ellen's talent spread and Ellen was invited to
    display her dried flower arrangements and wreaths at one
    flower show, and another, and another. Then she was asked to
    be a last-minute replacement at the Philadelphia Flower Show.
    Ellen had six weeks to ready a big display - but it was worth
    the effort. Her work charmed enough of the 220,000 visitors
    who attended the show to launch her on a round of paid
    lectures and workshops. </p>
    <p>To meet the demand, Ellen had to cut back on her practice.
    When the practice was so reduced she was devoting only half
    her working day to it, she knew she'd have to choose between
    the two careers. Ellen said, &quot;I'd been a practicing
    psychologist for a great many years by then, and it seemed
    time for a change. </p>
    <p>Ellen's husband Ben, whose career is also in the medical
    field, was pleased. &quot;He found the changes exciting. He's
    not a gardener,&quot; Ellen said, &quot;but he helps with the
    computer work and handles the mailing lists. In emergencies
    he's just at the other end of the beeper, and he comes
    running to the rescue. </p>
    <p>Ellen's business expanded, with the barn as headquarters.
    &quot;I've never kept regular store hours,&quot; Ellen told
    me. By appointment she sells dried arrangements, gives
    workshops, and holds open house. She charges admission to the
    workshops. The rest of the year she writes and gives talks
    and holds workshops in other towns. Ellen has built a mailing
    list for a bi-annual newsletter which is mostly about Ellen's
    open house dates, and her lecture and workshop schedule. She
    also ships dried flower arrangements in response to telephone
    orders, but hasn't gone so far as to produce a mail order
    catalog. </p>
    <p>&quot;My first book - like my career - was
    serendipitous,&quot; Ellen says. An editor from Rodale Press
    had seen Ellen's designs at flower shows. &quot;A week after
    I closed my office for good,&quot; Ellen told me, &quot;the
    editor phoned to discuss book possibilities.&quot; Ellen
    already had co-authored a book on psychology, she said,
    &quot;and I also had a computer which made writing easy. If
    I'd had to type on a typewriter I never would have managed. </p>
    <p>Rodale has since published three books by Ellen Spector
    Platt. 'Flower Craft' was the first, 'Wreaths, Arrangements,
    and Basket Decorations' came next. And this fall Rodale
    published Ellen's 'The Ultimate Wreath Book' which is filled
    with 150 very colorful wreaths in all sizes and shapes -
    Christmas, Thanksgiving, even Halloween! The book, and the
    wreaths you can make following Ellen's very clear directions,
    make wonderful Christmas gifts. </p>
    <p>Between books Ellen has spent so much time answering
    questions on how she started her business that she decided to
    put it on paper. So next year Stackpole Press is coming out
    with Ellen's latest: 'How To Make A Profit in the Flower and
    Herb Craft Business.' </p>
    <p>One way that Ellen makes a profit is by growing much of
    the material she uses in her arrangements. &quot;It's not a
    hardship - I love the experience of growing the flowers and
    the drying and the designing.&quot; Some materials she does
    import - eucalyptus, pomegranates, star fruit, which she
    dries sliced, and artichokes from the supermarket. </p>
    <p>Ellen air dries most of her materials in the classic
    manner - gathered into lose bunches and hung upside down. She
    even air dries peonies, which are surely among the more
    difficult subjects. Some of the flowers for wedding bouquets
    she desiccates in silica gel - orchids and lilies for
    example. Ferns and ivy are dried in a newspaper sandwich
    under her dining room rug. &quot;Nobody ever knows!&quot; she
    said. </p>
    <p>&quot;Air drying is still the best and the easiest way for
    most things,&quot; Ellen says. &quot;Where you hang them to
    dry is crucial. It must be really warm and dry.&quot; When
    it's hot and dry in summer she air dries in the attic and in
    the barn. &quot;It's too cool outside now for the barn,&quot;
    she said, &quot;but our old farmhouse has an old furnace and
    lots of drafts. That's not good for the budget but in winter
    it's good for drying flowers.&quot; Wire stretched above the
    furnace are Ellen's winter drying racks. </p>
    <p>This time of year Ellen scours nearby fields and roadsides
    looking for those beautiful wild things that can become part
    of dried arrangements and wreaths. A favorite is
    bright-berried bittersweet which she uses in loose upright
    arrangements. &quot;It also makes gorgeous wreaths,&quot; she
    said. &quot;Cut the vines, and weave strands in and out to
    make a circlet that binds itself in place.&quot; (Don't use
    this one on a door - the movement knocks the berries loose.) </p>
    <p>Ellen waxes some materials - rose hips, Virginia creeper,
    poke berries, and crabapples. &quot;Dip them quickly in
    paraffin melted in a double boiler. If you heat it on the
    burner it can catch fire.&quot; She waxes chestnuts in their
    prickly covers, and caladium leaves. &quot;The caladiums held
    up better than dogwood, &quot; she was surprised to discover.
    She combines these disparate elements in big luxuriant
    arrangements spilling over a bowl with little orange pumpkins
    beneath. They last three weeks and more. </p>
    <p>If you'd like to know more about Ellen's love affair with
    flowers, write, phone, or fax, Meadow Lark Flower &amp; Herb
    Farm, RD 1, Box 1568, Orwigsburg, PA, 17961, 717 366 1618;
    fax 717 366 0179. Ellen will put you on her mailing list and
    send you her bi-annual newsletter. It includes directions to
    Meadow Lark Farm, and gives the dates and places of upcoming
    workshops and lectures. </p>

    size="5"><strong> Be Changed</strong></font></h2>
    <p>We wander through the gardens at <b><i>Brookside</i></b><b>
    </b>and the <b><i>American Horticultural Society's River Farm</i></b>
    to smell the roses and gather beauty secrets &#151; like how
    tying asters together with soft twine makes a statement in
    height and color &#151; and how a fountain of tall variegated
    grasses can soften a brick corner. </p>
    <p>Walking the grounds at <b><i>Monticello</i></b> you have
    an experience of a different order. <i>Yes</i>, on a clear
    day the 360-degree view from Thomas Jefferson's &#147;little
    mountain&#148; is extraordinary. <i>Yes</i>, the 1,000-foot
    long vegetable terrace is an ode to the beauty of beans
    staked on weathered poles, to silver artichokes, aromatic
    herbs, and to the talent of its present curator, Maggie
    Stemann. <i>Yes</i>, this exquisite little mansion is
    beautifully restored, and the gift shop has been stocked with
    taste. </p>
    <p>But one of many very special aspects of Monticello is the
    visitor's awareness that it is still becoming what it once
    was. This is a living, growing garden, not an artifact frozen
    in time. Both researchers and the gardeners study Jefferson
    writings as they amplify the restoration of the 200-year-old
    gardens and search for old-fashioned plant varieties. </p>
    <p>So - ambling along the wooden terrace you find yourself
    trying to decide what Jefferson had chosen as the perfect
    spot for a long-vanished grove of trees they hope to replant.
    With something of his intensity, you query heirloom flowers
    he tried in the experimental beds by the dining room. Most of
    his seeds would have come from neighbors and distant friends.
    Garden markets were two centuries ahead in time, as were
    supermarkets and butcher shops. </p>
    <p>Understandably, this pioneer's first need was for a
    vegetable garden. Jefferson sited it on a long narrow terrace
    overlooking the rolling Piedmont countryside, and made it a
    work of art. Hewed from the side of the mountain, the terrace
    is supported by a massive and beautiful stone wall. At the
    foot of the wall there's a thicket of fig trees. On the
    grassy slope below, Jefferson's orchard has been replanted
    &#151; peaches, I seem to recall, cherries, and apples. Seen
    from above in spring, Jefferson's orchard must have been a
    froth of pink and white blossoms. </p>
    <p>I sat with my husband, Earl Hubbard, on a weathered gray
    bench under an apple tree looking up at the great stone wall
    and the little garden pavilion that rests on it. The pavilion
    was a quiet retreat where, we had been told, Jefferson read
    in the evening. We got to wondering....was he reading by
    candlelight or twilight? Was he escaping from the happy
    ruckus made by the eleven grandchildren who shared this
    mansion of rather modest size? Did he pen his Garden Book in
    that pavilion? </p>
    <p><i>Jefferson wrote: &#147;The greatest service which can
    be rendered (any country) is to add a useful plant to its
    culture.&#148;</i> </p>
    <p>When Jefferson spoke of his &#147;garden&#148;, like other
    early Americans he wasn't referring to a manicured estate. He
    was referring to that two-acre vegetable garden, a laboratory
    where he investigated 250 varieties of more than 70
    vegetables. Summer and winter, it was his major source of
    supply. Among the privileges of Jefferson's high estate was
    the responsibility to provide food and shelter for those who
    labored to carve his property from the North American jungle.
    </p>
    <p>Today the jungle laps at the edges of Monticello just as
    it did when Jefferson first cleared it. Valley views that
    once allowed Jefferson to monitor the daily construction of
    his beloved University of Virginia now must constantly be
    cleared of the ever-encroaching forest. Charlottesville and
    the Saturday afternoon football games are down there
    somewhere, but saplings and underbrush are everywhere
    present, waiting for another turn at Monticello. </p>
    <p>We came away from Monticello very much moved by
    Jefferson's profound commitment to perfection and wholeness.
    This exquisite place conveys Jefferson's abiding loves: his
    faith in the elegant culture he encountered during his tour
    as our Minister to France; and his reverence for the simple,
    powerful principles that govern the earth. This home and this
    garden were established by a caring genius committed to the
    wholeness of the American spirit he had defined and helped to
    articulate in the Declaration of Independence. </p>
    <p>We are his heirs. How fortunate we are! </p>
    <p>The standards expressed in the house and grounds at
    Monticello have had a profound impact on Charlottesville and
    its people. An example is the architecture of the Information
    Center at the foot of the hill. Across Route 20, the long,
    low building nestled into a rise was designed along lines
    established by a latter day American genius, Frank Lloyd
    Wright. Another example is the exquisite taste and attention
    to detail and comfort in the home of long-time Board Member
    George Palmer, and his wife Susanne. &#147;To be associated
    with Monticello is to be changed,&#148; Sue says. <i>To be
    changed is the gift offered to us by the best of our public
    homes and gardens.</i> </p>
    <p>I'd love to go back to Monticello now as the foliage on
    the slopes turns to gold, and mist feathers the valleys in
    the late afternoon. I think this is the most likely season
    for the great man's spirit to walk tall along the terraces
    &#151; planning his grove, the collection of seeds for next
    year's planting, the drying of beans for winter soups. </p>
    <p>The pleasant way to reach <b><i>Monticello </i></b>from
    Washington is to take #66, then Route 29 South at
    Gainesville. Follow it around Warrenton where it becomes
    Route 29/15. Charlottesville is less than two hours south
    through rolling green hills. At the approach to
    Charlottesville there's a four-mile strip under construction.
    A little beyond that turn onto Route 64 East, then take Route
    20 South, then that Route 53 leading up to Monticello. A neat
    place for a simple family meal is Michie's Tavern, about half
    way up the hill. Don't miss the Plant Shop located in the
    yellow and white striped tent at the Monticello Shuttle
    Station. It sells herbs, perennial vegetables, and heirloom
    seeds. You can plant Jeffersonians! Monticello is open year
    round except for Christmas day &#151; the hours March through
    October are 8 a.m. till 5 p.m. from November till February
    the hours are 9 a.m. till 4:30 p.m. Call (804) 984-9822 for
    special events information. Daily Garden Tours and Daily
    Plantation Tours will end October 31. </p>

    <p>The garden editors I know care passionately about their
    own gardens. That's how they got involved. But though they <b>know</b>
    a garden is a living design always in the act of becoming,
    most emit deprecating groans when you want to write about
    them. A lot of exposure to the big estate installations makes
    you hypercritical of your own results. </p>
    <p><b>Kathleen Fisher</b> isn't an exception to this rule.
    Kathy's the editor doing such a great job with &#147;<b>The
    American Horticulturist</b>,&#148; the magazine published by
    The American Horticultural Society. Kathleen took over as
    editor from Virginia Louisell six years ago. Her background
    is over 20 years as a newspaper writer and then a stint as
    editor of a newspaper for The American Psychological
    Association. </p>
    <p>It took some arm-twisting from me, and big sighs and
    hesitations from Kathy, before she would describe her two
    gardens -- the weekday garden in Alexandria, and the weekend
    garden near the Chesapeake on what is called Virginia's
    Northern Neck. </p>
    <p>A quarter-acre suburban yard near River Farm, AHS
    headquarters, is Kathy's everyday garden. Here she grows
    perennials, mostly shade plants. When she and David Ebersole,
    her husband, took over the property 12 years ago she says the
    <i>only thing growing was the rust on a broken swing set</i>.
    A brick patio had been surrounded by privet that had died in
    a hard freeze and the ground had been filled in with rock. </p>
    <p>To give the patio<i> a sense of enclosure</i> again, they
    built raised beds for herbs and planted a variety of shrubs.
    The beds are edged with dianthus for color and fragrance and <i>Campanula
    porcharskyana</i>, the little lavender bluebell that is so
    beautiful growing in walls and rock gardens. Kathy plans a
    major restructuring of this area to open the patio to the
    rest of the yard, reduce the lawn, and create even more space
    for shrubs &#147;if I can find the time.&#148; </p>
    <p>About a third of the back yard was taken up with a
    concrete driveway and adjacent slab probably used for
    basketball. Kathy herself applied a sledgehammer and broke up
    the cement. With her own hands she put in a brick and gravel
    path. Because the path is heavily <i>shaded</i><b><i>,</i></b>
    Kathy planted it on both sides with colorful, highly
    textured, bold combinations of fragrant-flowered <b>Hostas</b>,
    along with <b>Heucheras</b> and variegated <b>Solomon's sea</b>l.
    A favorite purchase this year was<i> Corydalis</i> `Blue
    Panda,' a ferny Spring bloomer with flowers rather like
    bleeding heart but blue. Her next project is to put in plants
    with more height. </p>
    <p>In the small, shaded back yard Kathy has created a Spring
    garden. Azaleas bloom at midseason surrounded by bleeding
    heart, Virginia bluebells, columbines, <i>Pieris</i>,
    blue-leaved hostas, and ferns. For Summer color she plants
    multi-hued drifts of impatiens. The colors in the back are in
    the blue, pink, purple range. Those in the front yard are in
    the gold, orange, red range. </p>
    <p>The couple's Northern Neck garden is a half-wooded,
    half-open six-acre piece of land on a cove. Here the
    challenge is to put in woody plants that will create a
    landscape with good bones. Kathy said, &#147;I'm trying to
    find the right trees and shrubs, and to position them so they
    create vistas connecting the house and its gardens to the
    woods.<b>&#148;</b> She added, &#147;It's all about patience
    -- I put in a few things, then I want to see how they work
    out. Then I put in a few more.&#148; </p>
    <p>So far Kathy's most pleased with the plantings of oakleaf
    hydrangeas and mountain laurels. The American Horticulturist
    ran an article on Kalmia breeder Richard Jaynes about a year
    ago and she has chosen several of his cultivars. Oakleaf
    hydrangea is <i>Hydrangea quercifolia</i>, a beautiful 6-foot
    shrub with big, deeply cut, fresh green leaves. In late
    Summer and through Autumn it bears cone-shaped flowerheads
    that have both sterile and fertile florets in a cream color
    that fades to soft rose. </p>
    <p>To create more privacy along one side of the house Kathy
    has planted the <b>viburnum cultivar `Shasta</b>,' a
    magnificent shrub introduced by the National Arboretum's
    late, great, Dr. Donald R. Egolf. It will grow more than 10
    feet tall and wide. In Spring it tops graceful horizontal
    branches with clusters of pure white flowers that are almost
    twice the size of those on a regular doublefile viburnum. In
    full bloom `Shasta' reminds you of a dogwood. The flowers are
    followed in midsummer by bright red fruits. </p>
    <p>Kathy suffers the frustrations familiar to all weekend
    gardeners, &#147;You're never there at those times when it's
    critical to water, weed, or fend off Japanese beetles,&#148;
    she says. To cut down on weeds and watering, she mulches and
    digs in compost. &#147;With a chipper-shredder and three
    acres of trees, a lot of them toppled in the
    once-in-a-century ice storm two Winters ago,&#148; she says,
    &#147;there's no end of free mulch and compost.&#148; Kathy
    also plants in less sun than usually suggested (&#147;I've
    even grown tomatoes in semi-shade,&#148;) and chooses the
    toughest plants possible. </p>
    <p>The most carefree planting so far has proved to be Kathy's
    garden for <b>hummingbirds and butterflies.</b> &#147;We
    planted it outside the back door near an old well,&#148;
    Kathy told me. &#147;We have <b>monarda, butterfly weed, and
    butterfly bush</b>. Even the <b>Joe Pye weed</b> is growing
    and last year's <b>cosmos</b> reseeded itself like crazy and
    is already blooming. <b>Cypress vine </b>was a big winner
    last year so I planted that again.&#148; </p>
    <p>Cypress vine (Cardinal climber) is the morning-glory
    relative <i>Ipomoea quamoclit,</i> a delicate twining climber
    with orange to red flowers in Summer and Fall. </p>
    <p>Kathy enjoys cooking weekends so she has installed a herb
    garden here, too. Kathy and her son Hart dug a pond last year
    to make a water garden, but they haven't gotten farther than
    the hole in the ground. Her next project is the acquisition
    of some<b> fringe trees</b>, <i>Chionanthus virginicus</i>,
    and a<b> red buckeye </b>(red horse chestnut) to plant near
    the butterfly garden. Red buckeye is <i>Aesculus X carnea</i>,
    a beautiful shade tree with upright panicles of showy red
    flowers in Spring. The leaves hold their color well into
    Autumn. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I am sore, tired, and wiser tonight. I have spent the day
    sorting out the ivy. My middle age has not crept up on me; it
    has <i>pounced</i> as if in ambush. Suddenly I am in my
    mid-40s; too sedentary and too ambivalent. My various aches
    testify to the fact that I am beginning to feel not as
    well-equipped to deal with certain sets of
    circumstances&#151;serious, industrial-strength ivy removal
    and self-distance both being high on the list. </p>
    <p>This morning, at breakfast, I looked out of the windows
    above the hill of cascading ivy and suddenly found my
    misplaced, righteous anger. Somehow&#151;perhaps under cover
    of darkness&#151;the ivy has gotten massively out of hand. I
    seem to have lost at least a foot of the railroad-tie steps
    to the creeping stuff. The gravel path that runs along side
    of the ivy is encroached upon by at least two feet. Entropy.
    Lots and lots of entropy. Things have gotten seriously
    tangled. My worklife has gotten so hectic and pressured that
    I've neglected things. I am appalled. Time to do something
    about it. </p>
    <p>&#147;I think I'll sort out the ivy,&#148; I tell my wife
    as I help clean up the breakfast dishes. </p>
    <p>&#147;Good idea,&#148; she says. &#147;Maybe it'll help
    you unwind.&#148; </p>
    <p><i>Indeed</i>. Maybe it will. I'm at a juncture in life
    where <i>wound too tight</i> has become the norm. I shuffle
    off down the hill to the gardening shed for my gloves and the
    hand pruners. This needs to be surgery, not land-clearing. I
    need to do some <i>restoration</i> work&#151;put the
    overgrown tangle back to the way it once was, maybe ringing
    some minor improvements along the way. </p>
    <p>It is hot and humid and not yet noon. Where to start? The
    Zen of gardening&#151;like the Zen of everything
    else&#151;says to simply <i>start</i>. So I kneel next to one
    step and begin searching for its edge underneath the tangle.
    Entropy. Suddenly I find the edge. </p>
    <table border="0" cellpadding="6" width="85%">
        <tr>
            <td>Nearly twenty years ago&#151;in <i>my</i>
            twenties&#151; I introduced a friend to songwriter
            Duncan Browne. Last week he returned the favor by
            informing me that Browne had died two years ago.
            Evidently, news from one's past travels very slowly,
            owing to the lack of forwarding addresses for the
            adults we become. Duncan Browne was about my
            age&#151;or would have been. He had also found the
            edge&#151;and now serves as a signpost to it for me.
            Serious entropy. <p>Sorting out the ivy turns out to
            be pretty brutal work, but I manage to release the
            full length of the railroad tie with a feeling of
            hard-won satisfaction&#151;I begin to remember the
            shape of the thing. Slowly, I proceed up the
            stairway, one step at a time. I learn a lot about ivy
            as I sort it out. I learn that the longer it goes
            untended, the stronger and tougher the vines
            become&#151;and the more difficult they are to cut
            through. </p>
            <p>Thinking about Duncan Browne, I remember my own
            music-filled youth. Browne left a trail of quietly
            brilliant songs in his wake. He kept that particular <i>white-hot</i>
            passion. And, for me, that's something that may have <i>left</i>
            with the music&#151;or, perhaps, withered and died,
            being cut off from the music. The trick is to cleave
            through the ensuing years of complacency and tap into
            that passion once again; have it once more fuel the
            endeavor&#151;even if the endeavor has changed. </p>

        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>I learn that <i>things</i> lurk underneath the
    ivy&#151;creepy, crawly things and lost objects; souvenirs
    from another time. It's biology crossed with archeology as
    slugs ooze by the forgotten tennis balls of forgotten dogs. I
    learn to take a deep breath before letting the sunlight flood
    beneath ivy. </p>
    <p>About the time I was evangelizing about Duncan Browne, I
    possessed the absolutism of youth. I remember thinking that,
    whatever else happened, I wouldn't end up middle-aged in the
    suburbs, trimming&#151;well&#151;ivy. What a long, strange
    trip it's been. In the end, does a very different kind of
    success compensate for the broken promises made to oneself?
    Sometimes, around three in the morning, I wonder. It's on
    those sleepless nights I go downstairs to listen to my old
    demo tapes and reread my own articles and try to decide. </p>
    <p>I learn that ivy tangles itself in an Escher-like fashion.
    Its chaos is not layered; new growth manages to twist itself
    around old growth, confusing attempts to separate the past
    from the present. I learn that the evolution of an ivy parcel
    is seemingly like a Klein Bottle&#151;its outside is
    transformed into its inside and back again: I go in to snip a
    new shoot and end up dredging out something old and gnarled. </p>
    <p>Duncan Browne kept the faith and I didn't&#151;or, at
    least, it seems that way. But is my middle-age so different
    from my youth? I've always used my chosen medium for my own
    ends&#151;whether it was pop song, novels, magazine
    articles&#151;or gardening columns. I've always been an
    example of <i>writer-as-guerrilla</i>; undermining my medium
    even as I wear its conventions on my sleeve. At the most
    basic level, then, I suppose I <i>have</i> kept the (albeit
    odd) faith. If I have doubts, they are to be found as much in
    my past as my present. </p>
    <p>I also learn that ivy, no matter how tangled, no matter
    how untended, yields to savage persistence. It is
    back-breaking, sweaty labor, it takes me all day, and I am
    often overwhelmed by the work that stretches out far in front
    of me. But I persevere and begin to see where I've
    been&#151;and, more importantly, where I'm <i>going</i>. In
    the end, the pleasure comes not from the new orderliness that
    trails behind me, but from the new-found certainty of where
    to make the <i>next</i> cut. The sureness of the next move is
    born of the aggregate lessons of the previous ones. </p>
    <p>Just as Duncan Browne oddly serves as both a symbol of my
    white-hot youth and my much-cooler middle years, I discover
    that I'm still making the same arrogant assumption from <i>this</i>
    side of the divide of decades Earlier, I saw no connection of
    youth with growing up. Now, grown-up, I see no connection
    with <i>youth</i>. </p>
    <p>The truth of the matter is that we are talking <i>continuums</i>
    here&#151;Duncan Browne represents not bookends to a stage of
    my life, but the connection of my past to my present. </p>
    <p>In the end, the ivy's a lot smarter than me&#151;it uses
    old structure as a point of departure for new ones; it uses
    age to toughen itself; it gracefully rises up and over old
    flotsam and jetsam; and it integrates its past and present.
    All that's needed is confident guiding. </p>
    <p>My wife brings me a lemonade as I'm surveying the results
    of my labor. I am soaked with sweat and walking as gingerly
    as befits a middle-aged man who has kneeled for over seven
    hours. She catches me humming to myself. </p>
    <p>&#147;This is as happy as I've seen you in
    months&#151;what happened?&#148; she asks. </p>
    <p>&#147;Not a lot,&#148; I reply. &#147;I've just been
    sorting out the ivy.&#148; I finish humming the Duncan Browne
    song. </p>

    <p><font color="#000000"><sub>I am sleepless tonight and
    riding the mournful, yearning sax lines that spill from the
    speakers. A full moon makes the snowy yard outside this
    window seem ghostly. They say it is the coldest night of the
    year and I am inclined to believe them.</sub></font><sub> </sub></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><sub>I am feeling alone and
    ultimately friendless tonight. I badly want to talk to
    someone right now, but everyone I currently know is safely
    tucked into flannel sheets; dreaming of tomorrow's workplace
    triumphs and tensions. It would not do to rouse them from bed
    at 3:00 AM. But there was once a time in my life where
    all-night friends were as plentiful as 24-hour diners; where
    a call at three in the morning would interrupt and not wake
    them.</sub></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><sub>And this loss of
    round-the-clock friendship has much to do with why I want to
    ring up my friends now. I need to tell them about this
    evening's television. I want to stir them from their sleep
    and warn them, like Kevin McCarthy in The Invasion of the
    Body Snatchers: For God's sake, don't fall asleep; you'll
    wake up an </sub></font><sub>adult! But, of course, it is too
    late-they are already asleep-in truth, they have been
    slumbering for years. Which leaves me here, at 3:00 AM; still
    dressed and looking down at the moonlight glinting off my icy
    yard with McCarthy's words reverberating in my ears:
    &quot;They're here!&quot; Yes, they are-or more accurately,
    we are. Indeed. </sub></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><sub>I am sleepless for a stupid and
    profound reason: I have spent the evening watching television
    and, in the space of an hour, three commercials have
    succeeded in cutting me lose from my moorings.</sub></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><sub>The first ad was for a new
    Jaguar. As to be expected, it was a toney, Euro sort of
    thing; Old World plains instead of the obligatory aerial shot
    of Detroit's Finest cruising down Big Sur. Lots of low camera
    angles with an expensive car carriage rushing overhead;
    oddly, exactly like that tracking shot beneath Darth Vader's
    ship at the opening of Star Wars. In short, advertising
    business as usual. And then came the voice-over: British and
    negotiating that </sub></font><sub>U in Jaguar like a veteran
    BBC announcer. Honey and gravel; terribly worn and lived-in,
    and all the more supple for it. Voice as archeological dig: a
    magnificent ruin built atop another, different city. Carnaby
    Street refracted through punk cabaret. It was Marianne
    Faithfull. And she was hawking luxury cars. </sub></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><sub>The commercial that followed
    immediately afterwards was for Mercedes, and trumpeted their
    new model to the world. Obviously, broken-voiced pop divas
    are much in fashion because accompanying Mercedes' Darth
    Vader car shot was Janis Joplin singing &quot;Oh Lord, Won't
    You Buy Me A Mercedes Benz?&quot; Despite the line &quot;My
    friends all drive Porches and I must make amends,&quot; and
    the fact that the session breaks down with Joplin laughing
    sarcastically, the irony of the song seemed to be lost on the
    agency, Mercedes and-perhaps-the audience.</sub></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><sub>Twenty minutes later I am still
    sitting there staring at the TV, still trying to wrap my mind
    around 'Sixties icons selling luxury cars, when an ad for
    Skippy peanut butter appears. And, by God, the growl of
    Eartha Kitt runs down the benefits of Skippy as images of
    television-perfect mothers and children dance across the
    screen. The spot concludes on a surreal note, with Kitt
    purring, as if to remind Baby Boomers everywhere that she had
    once played Cat Woman.</sub></font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><sub>I have not been able to get
    these commercials-or, rather, what they represent-out of my
    mind. Maybe a whole generation did fall asleep against all
    warnings and woke up, well, no longer themselves.</sub></font></p>

    <p><sub>What exactly is happening here? All women, all
    embodiments of the 'Sixties, all with world-weary voices-and,
    most importantly, all once-upon-a-time bad girls. And now
    they are validating 'Nineties domestic life as we know it.</sub></p>
    <p><sub>Marianne Faithfull, when not ethereally performing
    &quot;As Tears Go By,&quot; was going out with both Mick
    Jagger and Keith Richard of the Rolling Stones, and
    co-writing &quot;Sister Morphine&quot; with the boys. Janis
    Joplin battled her demons on stage, fueled by a nightly
    bottle of Jack Daniels. When she died of drug overdose, Port
    Arthur, Texas claimed her as one of their own with the
    greatest reluctance. And outside of that skin-tight Cat Woman
    suit, Eartha Kitt got herself banned from White House
    receptions for being too unrepentantly militant.</sub></p>
    <p><sub>No, this isn't some classic pundit-rant about rockers
    selling out. The real point here is that a generation's lust
    for living has become domesticated. In the context of Now-of
    cars and peanut butter-the &quot;danger&quot; lurking in
    Faithfull's posh pop-princess tones, or Joplin's ragged
    laugh, or Kitt's purr has as much to do with Then as a house
    cat watching a bird on the windowsill has to do with lions on
    the Serengeti. The lineage is obviously there, but years of
    evolution have ensued. </sub></p>
    <p><sub>And what exactly happened to us? There are no longer
    any more all-night friends or impassioned political arguments
    or rapt anticipation of the next pop record. Music no longer
    seems as if it can save our immortal souls-nor can politics
    or art or love-at-first-sight, for that matter. We all went
    to sleep, it seems-against urgent, panicky admonishments not
    to. And we awoke to find that Marianne Faithfull was asking
    us not &quot;Why'd Ya Do It?&quot; but rather, why'd we ever
    want to be without the comfort and status of a Jag.</sub></p>
    <p><sub>This is what I am pondering tonight; amused and
    appalled by the irony that now, after the fact, I am
    sleepless. Fitzgerald once wrote that there are no second
    acts in American lives. And right now I am wondering if the
    same may be said of youth.</sub></p>

    <p><sub>Things are, well, settled these days. Life seems to
    be filled with far fewer possibilities. As I knot my tie in
    the morning, I look down on the street as the junior high and
    high school kids run for the bus and think that their parents
    are about my age. And as I carefully lock the front door
    behind me (gotta a lot of stuff in there, after all), slip
    behind the wheel of the sports car, and head into another
    workday, well, I can feel my tolerance for risk narrowing;
    constricting like a noose. And some days-much like that house
    cat on the windowsill, no doubt-I can feel something ancient
    well up inside me, some echo of myself from twenty years ago,
    and it is on these occasions that I want to point the car
    towards the Blue Ridge mountains and see how fast it can
    really go. </sub></p>
    <p><sub>Because sometimes I think that my life is as
    inappropriate and wasted as driving a stick shift in city
    traffic: Beyond a certain throw-away stylishness, it does the
    car no good and it is most certainly a lot of work. A sports
    car is meant for graceful, controlled skids into curves and
    snapping G-forces as it rights itself on the straight away.
    And perhaps that is also what I am meant for-as were we all
    once.</sub></p>
    <p><sub>I think that I am at an awkward age-the later-life
    equivalent of being a gangly teenager. My vengefully youthful
    haircut is graying at the temples. As Bryan Ferry once
    crooned, &quot;We're too young too reason, too grown up to
    dream.&quot; It is a line that always leaves me with the
    shock of recognition.</sub></p>
    <p><sub>Take my flirtation with bifocals, for example. I need
    them; but not quite. I am left in a vaguely annoying
    lurch-too old for my former eyesight, too young for what is
    to come. As a result, I find myself straddling; living in two
    worlds. Using my trusty glasses from years past for distance
    and irritatingly pushing them up atop my head for reading;
    the very image of my father. My almost-need for bifocals is
    not anecdotal; for me it is an oddly resonant metaphor for
    this stage of my life.</sub></p>
    <p><sub>Steven Spielberg made a flawed but provocative film
    called Hook, which posited the idea that Peter Pan grew up to
    be a corporate raider, forgetting who he once was. I am here
    to say that there are worse things: Like remembering who you
    were years ago, even though you are hip-deep in adulthood.</sub></p>
    <p><sub>Thus tonight, I am railing at an earlier generation's
    pop stars for doing what I do 60 hours a week-taking the
    money and trying not to think too hard about the
    implications, irony, or cost. I am not angry with them-I am
    pissed at me. And suddenly this sleepless night crackles with
    epiphany. </sub></p>

    <p><sub><i>Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz? My
    friends are all sources for demographic trends</i>.
    Basically, most of us got good at what we did. We got a
    little affluent and we got a little piece of the action.
    Suddenly, somehow, we became Players-and the House gladly
    extended credit.</sub></p>
    <p><sub>And I am no different-music gave way to
    magazine-making, which has given way to Websmithing. The
    apartment became the condo, which, in its turn, morphed into
    a home. And now unshaven and a bit disheveled I watch the
    thin winter light edge across my neighborhood street. I could
    do the stay-up-all-night better in younger years, I think.</sub></p>
    <p><sub>I'm still circling, trying to get a fix on the
    problem. As the rising sun briefly turns the clouds salmon, I
    finally nail it: It's not the values; it's the passion that
    I'm mourning. Springsteen had is wrong; tramps like us were
    born to evolve, not run. Bowie had it right; ch-ch-changes,
    turn to face the strange. Values are temporal and perhaps
    even more transitory than we care to admit. At the apex of
    the 'Sixties there was a club in London called The
    Revolution. In its bathroom some wag had scrawled, &quot;If
    this is the revolution, why are the bleeding drinks so
    expensive?&quot; Indeed.</sub></p>
    <p><sub>In truth, our values evolve with us. This isn't about
    belief systems-I believe in the future of the World Wide Web
    as I once believed in the redemptive power of pop music. And
    my belief in that hand-restored Datsun 2000 with the
    removable hard top? Well, it's been supplanted by a belief in
    my garden and my roses and the stately old holly tree outside
    my office window.</sub></p>
    <p><sub>No, the rub is the passion. This is the thing that's
    kept me up all night. Because the new beliefs should be as
    passionate as the old ones. The urgency must somehow be
    preserved-whether it's about the kids, the neighborhood,
    or-God help us all-reseeding the lawn: If this is Middle Age,
    why is the bleeding blue grass so expensive? In the end, TS
    Eliot's horror isn't the measuring out of a life with coffee
    spoons-it's not having a profound and vital interest in them.
    Tonight I have decided that I can forgive many things-even
    the banal. But a cold-and-dead, arm's-length existence is
    Simply Not Acceptable.</sub></p>
    <p><sub>It looks as if it's going to a lovely day. And now,
    at six o'clock in the morning, I am suddenly seized with the
    desire to play a Marianne Faithfull CD. I think I shall play
    it loudly.</sub></p>

            108-pound leather-clad woman, albeit animated, who is
            part dancer, part valkyrie, and part anarchist (or,
            as her bio simply states: &quot;assassination,
            seduction, domination, modeling&quot;). And, oh yeah,
            that very cool-yet-disturbing thing she does with
            eyelashes and flies. </p>

            <p>Yes, the smart thing would be to merely skim the
            surface of <i>on Flux</i>; to simply file a prose
            inventory all of the oblique surface quirks that
            disguise what's really going on in the series,
            allowing it to slip, Trojan-Horse like, into the
            consciousness of the latest MTV Generation. </p>
            <p>The easy drill would be to accept <i>on Flux</i>
            at face value; as an odd and extreme show that
            perpetuates male fantasies women--a sort of <i>Beavis
            and Butthead</i> if it were written by a David Lynch
            and directed by a James Cameron. </p>
            <p>The glib approach would be to lean into the
            sensational aspects of the series. And, indeed, it's
            likely that MTV would endorse such an approach
            because it would deflect attention away from two
            things it may not be anxious to have pointed out:
            that genuine art may be lurking just below the heavy
            metal surface of <i>on Flux,</i> and that the
            subtext of the series belies its apparent trafficking
            in typical male (and MTV) &quot;babe&quot;
            fantasies--that the show is actually as radical a
            re-imagining of the pop cultural image of women as
            can exist this side of a manifesto. </p>
            <p>These are aspects of <i>on Flux</i> that MTV may
            ultimately be uncomfortable with. Given its current
            time slot, wedged in between the New Dumb banalities
            and sexism of <i>Singled Ou</i>t and--yes--<i>Beavis
            and Butthead</i>, the last thing the network needs is
            a High Art and Feminist jar of cold water ruining all
            of the mindless fun. </p>
            <p>And this is indicative of the conflicting agendas
            flying through and around <i>on Flux</i>: For
            example, here's some of the official MTV press
            release announcing the show: &quot;Featured are the
            adventures of the unpredictable on [Flux ,the
            secret agent extraordinaire] and her arch rival/soul
            mate Trevor.&quot; Described flatly and ambiguously,
            it sounds like a bad 60s spy show; <i>The Girl From
            UNCLE</i> all over again. </p>
            <p>On the other hand, Significance (though equally
            ambiguous) positively drips from this statement by
            Abby Terkuhule, senior vice president and creative
            director of MTV: &quot;I think on stood out head
            and shoulders above the rest [of the <i>Liquid
            Television</i> offerings]. There was, from the first
            season, a buzz on <i>on Flux</i>. Stylistically, I
            think it's incredible. It's just visually stunning.
            And I like the fact that it works on a lot of
            different levels. Politically and socially, there's a
            lot of sub-contexts.&quot; </p>
            <p>However, <i>on Flux</i> creator, designer, and
            writer, Peter Chung is unable to recall any initial
            comprehension or encouragement on the part of the
            network: &quot;I had arguments with MTV about [the
            show]. They didn't understand it and the only way I
            was able to sell it to them, to sell them on the idea
            of doing it or letting me do it, was to tell them
            that it was a <i>spoof</i>. </p>
            <p>&quot;My intentions were much more...I guess you'd
            say academic. I was interested in experimenting with
            visual narrative, telling a story without dialogue
            and also trying to create a style of telling a story
            with animation that wasn't influenced by the usual
            kinds of things that you see. For me, there is a
            solid storyline going on under all the action. It's
            not really that important to me whether or not
            everybody agrees on what that story is.&quot; <sup>1</sup>
            </p>
            <p>Chung also took exception to the MTV marketing of <i>on
            Flux </i>as a secret agent show. &quot;She doesn't
            really work for anyone,&quot; he has stated.
            &quot;She's a completely independent force. She's an
            anarchist, basically&quot; <sup>1</sup> </p>
            <p><i>on Flux</i>, then, is like the proverbial
            elephant presented to blind men that, in this case,
            are the network, its marketing division, the creator
            of the show, and--yes--the audience. The series is
            like a Rorschach test--its significance, artistic and
            social, shifts with the perceptions of each viewer.
            Ultimately, however, <i>on Flux</i> is a meditation
            on the changing image of women in pop culture, no
            matter what else it may be up to (which is quite a
            lot). </p>

        <p>It began quietly enough five years ago on MTV.
        Actually, it began wordlessly<i>, </i>amid hails of
        gunfire on <i>Liquid Television</i>--an MTV anthology
        program dedicated to <i>avant garde</i> animation--a
        respected genre in Europe and Japan (where is known as <i>anime)</i>,
        but then a nearly new concept for Disney-raised America. </p>
        <p>The show was comprised of various shorts from around
        the world, and the standout segments were the
        three-minute clips featuring a woman in leather who never
        spoke. In fact, <i>none</i> of the characters spoke:
        There was music, sound effects, and even the occasional
        &quot;<i>Hmmm</i>&quot; from a character, but no dialogue
        whatsoever. The show was called <i>on Flux</i> and it
        was unclear if it was the title of the unfolding
        serialized story or the name of the woman (by the way, it
        <i>did</i> refer to the story, but somehow the name
        managed to stick to the anti-heroine). </p>
        <p>Overall, the feeling was one of watching intriguing
        trailers for a forthcoming feature-length film--or
        excerpts from some larger work. There was an almost
        tangible sense of <i>more</i>--more story, more setting,
        more characters--lurking just off the edge of the
        television screen; there if we could only push against
        the tube and peer past each of its edges. </p>
        <p><i>on Flux</i> became the single most popular part
        of <i>Liquid Television </i>and a second series of the
        show ordered for the next season of <i>LTV</i>, except
        for one small thing--Peter Chung had killed off on in
        the final installment of the first series. Chung has said
        &quot;My idea was not to bring her back...but they [MTV]
        wanted to bring her back. I couldn't really find a
        credible way...I just said 'the hell with it', I'm just
        going to bring her back; I'm not going to explain it and
        she's going to die in every episode.&quot; <sup>2</sup> </p>
        <p>After the second increasingly successful series of <i>on
        Flux</i> episodes, MTV commissioned Chung to produce a
        series of 10 half-hour shows which featured dialogue for
        the characters. And this, in turn, has led to video
        compilations, tee-shirts, graphic novels, and even a
        proposed series of <i>action figures</i> based on the
        show's main characters. In short, the media machine has
        been cranked up and the flood of tie-ins has started.
        Except that this is not <i>The Brady Bunch</i> or <i>Batman</i>
        or even <i>Twin Peaks</i> (the feeling of which it
        occasionally echoes). </p>
        <p>The question thus becomes what messages <i>on Flu</i>x
        sends as an increasingly well-known pop phenomenon. It's
        fair to say that the show has evolved from action genre
        send-up to the highly complex psychodrama of the
        half-hour episodes. </p>
        <p>Though Peter Chung may beg to differ, <i>on Flux</i>
        is art that grew into its intent. A scholarly-prank
        morphed into an improbable pop hit that stealthily
        evolved into a psychological and cultural investigation.
        The self-admitted academic exercise ended up producing
        some of the most complex writing currently on television
        today. </p>
        <p>Meaning found <i>on Flux</i> as much as <i>on Flux</i>
        aspired to meaning. It attached itself to the series'
        open text and accumulated there like a coral reef. In
        this, it is a nearly perfect piece of pop art--a product
        of its time, in constant dialog with its culture, and
        fluidly shifting with changing perceptions. Ultimately,
        its artistic statement is a collaboration between creator
        and audience. </p>
        <p>Throughout this incremental, two-way growth, however,
        on's gender--whether parodied, underscored, or
        dismissed, has been the basis of the show's most
        consistent message. </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><i>on Flux</i> began as an inside-out cliche: A
            James Bond girl of expectedly improbable proportions
            who, in reality, actually out-Bonds Bond. </p>
            <p>Peter Chung has admitted that the send-up was
            built into the show from the outset: &quot;It's
            basically my reaction to seeing Hollywood
            action/adventure movies and wanting to do something
            that kind of showed viewers what was always implicit,
            but what those films never really delivered. Which
            was basically having the main character doing all the
            standard heroic things, but doing so in what I would
            call a 'moral vacuum' in which you don't really know
            why she's doing the things she's doing, but you're
            kind of caught up in the action. And seeing how...
            far along you could lead [the viewers] on--until the
            point where [on] dies in a very ridiculous
            manner.&quot;<sup>2</sup> </p>
            <p>on's sex not only stands the Bond Girl cliche on
            its head, it also thows the male action-film heroics
            out of context and therefore into relief--and
            question. As Chung points out, &quot;I don't think
            it's that far from what you actually see in, say, an
            Arnold Schwartzenegger movie.&quot; <sup>2</sup> </p>
            <p>While the violence in the series is extreme
            (although toned-down from its early <i>Liquid
            Television</i> installments), it is meant to be seen
            as futile rather than gratuitous: Individuals,
            groups, and <i>whole armies</i> die in <i>on Flux</i>--inevitably
            for no good reason. The goals they die for are never
            reached, the causes finally undermined. In this way,
            the sheep's clothing that enabled the show to sneak
            onto the MTV roster--the violence--is made to
            critically comment on itself. It's ironic that while
            the network had a number of concerns about the overt
            and <i>outre</i> sexuality of the series, they had no
            problems with its violence. &quot;It's America,&quot;
            Chung simply says in response. <sup>2</sup> </p>
            <p>And while having on inexplicably die and
            resurrect may have started out as a plot convenience,
            it can also be seen as the most dramatic example of
            futile violence in the series. She dies while trying
            to harm others; she dies merely as a result of having
            a bad day, she dies trying to save people, and she
            occasionally dies because of her own hubris. </p>
            <p>On one level--especially in the second-season
            episodes--<i>on Flux</i> became a post-modern
            reworking of Warner Brothers' Roadrunner cartoons,
            with on as the Coyote. In fact, in one installment,
            she falls out of an airplane while attempting to
            assassinate a politician and the canyon she plummets
            towards is a direct visual quote of that endless
            series of gorges Wile E. has fallen into over the
            years. As she falls to earth, she does a slow burn,
            shakes her head, and look disgustedly at the
            viewer--all moves of the Coyote in similar
            circumstances. And like the Coyote's travails, this
            episode ends badly for on--the Roadrunner in the
            guise of a speeding train finally seals her fate. </p>
            <p>The second season finale of the show illustrated
            not only the futility of violence, but also the
            contextual basis of heroism. An overconfident on is
            killed by an unbelievably dashing soldier who is in
            turn killed by an even more impossibly heroic enemy
            who is then dispatched by a goddess-like,
            gun-wielding woman who makes on look tame. It's a
            morality play compacted into three minutes; there
            are, Chung seems to be suggesting, heroes on <i>all</i>
            sides--we have merely decided to focus on on;
            perhaps arbitrarily. </p>
            <p>But while the gender of the main character in <i>on
            Flux </i>began as a simple device to make a point
            about male-dominated action films, it paradoxically
            became something more startling because the show was
            never about the violence. According to Chung,
            &quot;The action and violent aspects are really there
            to get the viewer to watch. What I'm really
            interested in is exploring the psychology of the
            characters. on Flux has a combination of good and
            bad traits, just like a real person. To me, that's
            the crucial component of creating a true
            character.&quot; <sup>2</sup> </p>
            <p>And so meaning also attached itself to the issue
            of on's gender and flourished in its open
            textuality. In essence, Chung created a strong woman
            stereotype and then proceeded to give her
            psychological resonance. And it is on's complex
            motivations and contradictory actions that undermine
            any attempt to reduce her to iconic, fetishist, or
            sex-object levels. In giving on a psychological
            life, whether or not he intended for it to happen,
            Chung not only popularized the so-called Riot Grrrl,
            but also extended the pop culture possibilities of
            women. </p>

        <p>on Flux is not without precedent or precursors. She
        has sisters, mothers, and grandmothers. As a Riot Grrrl,
        she is the latest iteration of the media's Strong Woman.
        on derives from Howard Hawkes' female characters; from
        Modesty Blaise; from <i>The Avengers</i>' Kathy Gale and
        Emma Peel; from the Julie Newmar/Eartha Kitt/Michelle
        Pfieffer Cat Woman; from Molly in <i>Neuromancer</i>; and
        from <i>La Femme Nikit</i>a<i>.</i> </p>
        <p>It is a lineage, where each new descendent builds upon
        what has previously been established. Emma Peel built on
        the strength of Modesty Blaise, while Nikita used Molly
        as a point of departure. But, with the exception of the
        Tim Burton/Michelle Pfieffer Cat Woman, this
        cross-referential group of female characters ultimately
        lacks psychological the resonances of on Flux. </p>
        <p>Kathy Gale and Emma Peel--or characters very, very
        much like them--were actually pulled back into morass of
        male media fantasies by literally <i>becoming</i> Bond
        Girls in <i>Goldfinger</i> and <i>On Her Majesty's Secret
        Service</i>, respectively via the actors who originally
        portrayed them. And <i>La Femme Nikita</i>--while mining
        the same vein as <i>on Flux</i>, finally reveals itself
        to be a retelling of <i>Pygmalion</i>--a kind of <i>My
        Fair Lady</i> with Uzis. </p>
        <p>Which pretty much leaves the playing field to on:
        She is an unpredictable force unto herself. And yes, of
        course we're <i>not</i> talking about Literature here.
        Self-sufficiency and rising above cliche status are
        hardly psychological breakthroughs--unless you happen to
        be a female character in male-dominated media. <i>Then</i>
        it becomes breath of fresh air. </p>
        <p>A clue to the major message of <i>on Flux</i> is
        found in the opening credits of the half-hour episodes.
        In a show that prides itself on what Peter Chung has
        describe as it's &quot;nonlinearity,&quot; in a show
        where the main character can die in one episode only to
        be alive in the next, in an entertainment where
        &quot;good&quot; characters are recast as &quot;bad&quot;
        and then recast back again, where <i>character relations</i>
        rather than <i>story</i> holds series together, the only
        constant is literally the only thing that <i>is</i>
        constant: the opening credits. </p>
        <p>The opening of <i>on Flux</i> is an homage to the
        credits of Patrick MacGoohan's surrealistic 1968
        television parable, <i>The Prisoner</i>. The voiceover
        exchanges between on and Trevor echo a similar weekly
        fencing between Number Six and Number Two. In the latter
        series, it represented the stand of an individual in the
        face of mindless societal and cultural authority. In <i>on
        Flux</i>, a woman's right to be an individual comes to
        the fore: &quot;<i>Trevor:</i> The Dream: To awaken the
        world. <i>on: </i>You're out of control. <i>Trevor:</i>
        I take control. Whose side are you on? <i>on:</i> I
        take no side. <i>Trevor:</i> You're skating the edge. <i>on:</i>
        I <i>am</i> the edge. <i>Trevor:</i> What you want, only
        I can give. <i>on:</i> You can't <i>give</i> it, you
        can't even <i>buy</i> it, and you just don't <i>get</i>
        it.&quot; </p>
        <p>Are we <i>really</i> talking about world domination
        here--or sexual politics? on's accusation to Trevor
        (after he tells her he knows what she &quot;wants&quot;),
        &quot;You just don't <i>get</i> it,&quot; flies into the
        face (and perhaps over the heads) of the mostly male
        audience as they hunker down to spend a half-hour with
        their favorite semi-clad heroine. Pop art can, at times,
        wage guerilla warfare. </p>
        <p>And there is also the matter of on's, well,
        pansexuality. Her autonomy is reflected in her love life,
        in which she is depicted as predator. Here, Chung
        continues his inversion of the Bond Girl cliche--on's
        heterosexual excursions pack a wallop based solely on her
        gender. A sexually predator is patently not shocking as
        long as it is Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan as the
        hunter. However, switch the gender and remove any Hester
        Pryne-like implication that on is a &quot;fallen&quot;
        woman, and one is left with considerable numbers of
        viewers squirming in their seats: She says things like
        &quot;I'm not <i>asking</i> you, I'm commandeering you...
        This is an authorized police action, Lover: You are <i>mine</i>!&quot;
        with a <i>tad</i> too much conviction... </p>
        <p>The question of free will runs like a leit motif
        throughout the show. Episodes examine on's
        individuality <i>vis a vis</i> conscience, memory,
        religion, genetics, evolution, and even sanity. It is in
        these installments that she reveals the nobility of a
        wild animal, savagely railing against any kind of attempt
        to constrain her or circumvent her true nature. But
        freedom, at least on's rarified version of it, cuts
        both ways: With its lack of restraints and barriers, it
        is exhilarating, and yet it also has a dark side--Chung's
        &quot;moral vacuum.&quot; </p>
        <p>In this way, on represents not only a truly
        autonomous pop-art heroine, but a <i>complete</i>
        one--and this may be Chung's greatest achievement. He
        seems to be suggesting that a female hero on equal
        footing with all of the muscle boys cannot merely distill
        their best qualities--it's a case of 'in for a penny, in
        for a pound.' And so on is <i>stupid</i> in ways that
        the Action Men are--perhaps even more so, because she is
        better at the violence game than they are, and because
        she is blessed/cursed with Chung's unwavering, ironic
        camera. His lens impassively records the wreckage on's
        brand of &quot;heroism&quot; leaves in its wake. </p>
        <p>Her mistakes are many, shocking, and often grimly
        humorous. In one installment she manages to kill an
        innocent person while shaving under her arms. In another,
        she wipes out an entire colony by accidently dropping a
        clip of bullets down a ventilator shaft. And in the final
        episode of the current half-hour episodes, on destroys
        the whole world--yes, all of it-- through a <i>misunderstanding</i>.
        For all of the show's evolution, on Flux is still very
        much Wile E. Coyote and, despite all of the stylized
        carnage, Chung still views violence as finally futile.
        She deserves her anti-heroine status because often we are
        left wondering who's more dangerous--Trevor or on. </p>
        <p>Because of all of this, there is much more than a
        divide between on and Emma Peel or Nikita--the distance
        can be measured in light years. There is no chance that
        Ms Flux will turn up breathlessly in the next Bond film,
        and--when the action doll finally comes out--it should on
        no account be put on the same shelf as Barbie--for
        Barbie's continued health. </p>

            <p>This, then, is something of what <i>on Flux</i>
            is up to weekly, crammed between an updated and
            mind-numbingly stupid version of <i>The Dating Game</i>
            and MTV's golden boys, Beavis and Butthead--who would
            not make it off their seedy couch alive if confronted
            by on (surely a potent recommendation of her to
            even the most repelled viewers). </p>
            <p>In this sort of piece, a graceful segue into What
            It All Means usually occurs about now. But on,
            after all, is dependent on viewer perceptions, both
            well- and ill-informed. So we can safely dispense
            with the section pondering Peter Chung's
            psychological makeup. </p>
            <p>No, better to leave it at this: an establishment
            that <i>stuff</i> is happening in <i>on Flux</i>
            beyond her 40-24-34 gun-toting proportions. With the
            show, we are confronted with something that is a good
            deal more than a posturing, animated music video. </p>
            <p>And let's leave it at this, too: The importance of
            <i>on Flu</i>x is not the just the cryptic,
            High-Art aspirations of its creator--rather, it is
            also because it's a substantial pop culture hit seen
            weekly on an international music video network. While
            <i>on Flu</i>x may have sprang from Peter Chung's
            idiosyncratic eye ticks, it has somehow succeeded in
            connecting with the obsessions, convictions, and
            sensibilities of a considerable number of people.
            on, after all, is the character who literally
            refuses to die; the pop creation who could not be
            killed off by her creator. </p>
            <p>In the end, like all durable art, perhaps <i>on
            Flux</i> is not <i>about</i> us but <i>of</i> us, of
            Late Twentieth Century America as it goes lumbering
            towards the Millennium. This is either a sobering or
            reassuring thought, depending on your view of
            on--but it is, after all, a <i>thought</i>--something
            rarely had on television these days. </p>

            <p><i>First the blankness and then the Dial Tone. The
            razor-sharp directness cuts to the heart of the
            matter with such grim efficiency that the campy irony
            fails to raise a smile. A hi-tech commercial venture
            is dying tonight, but it has resonances; ripples that
            travel outward from--and ultimately beyond--mere
            considerations of commerce, marketshare, and
            reallocation of corporate resouces. First the
            blankness and then the Dial Tone: It is also about
            the end of relationships and, of course, our
            mortality. . .</i> </p>
            <p>It's past two-thirty in the morning and I am
            online, an observer to a singular
            event--cyber-termination with extreme prejudice; a
            virtual execution. A world is about to be laid
            waste--as if Douglas Adams' Vogons were hovering
            overhead in cyberspace, oblivious to the fact that
            this is <i>not</i> Thursday. I have been drawn here,
            to eWorld, Apple Computer's online service, on its
            last night of existence--a Net backwater that I have
            had little patience with for the past couple of
            years. </p>
            <p>There is a feeling of history crackling down the
            phone lines tonight, a sense of Moment that
            transcends the cool, scrolling ASCII in a real-time
            window named <i>Town Square 4</i>. Usually there is
            only one Town Square in eWorld--but not tonight, not
            now. New adjunct windows are created as Town Squares
            1, 2, 3, and 4 each, in its turn, are filled to
            capacity. At one point over 700 people were
            participating in real-time chat in the heart of the
            night. As one online wag noted, &#147;Where were all
            these guys, when we <i>needed</i> them??&#148; Where
            indeed? </p>
            <p>In the silence that is almost 3:00 AM on a Monday
            morning, the feel is an eerie cross between those
            crowds celebrating the Millennium in <i>Strange Days</i>
            and the ragtag bands of people gathered to welcome
            the aliens in<i> Close Encounters of the Third Kind: </i>&#147;The
            End of History&#148; mixes with &#147;Stop and Be
            Friendly.&#148; </p>
            <p>Cyberspace is showing its youth tonight. The
            collapse of an international online service is still
            shockingly new. Oh, more such collapses will occur as
            the online world sorts itself out. Next year at this
            time, we will all be jaded--<i>been there, done that,
            got the tee-shirt</i>. But right now, the passing of
            eWorld is news. A much-ballyhooed service from Apple
            Computer, a technologically revolutionary company
            despite its breathtaking lack of business sense, is
            going belly up. eWorld, it seems, is Not A Sound
            Business Venture. </p>
            <p>There are many reasons why the crowds have
            gathered tonight. Some are the bystanders around a
            bad car accident. Some are in attendance at the
            Viking funeral of something they loved. Others are
            here merely to make the cyber-Scene; finding an
            excuse to party on a school night. And, yes, there
            are those who want to see what if feels like to
            collectively topple into the Big Black by staying
            jacked into eWorld as the switch is flipped: a
            virtual near-death experience--and these are people
            with handles like !!!Gothic!!! and *Pale Dead Child*.
            </p>
            <p>Why am I here? I'm here for the same reason I was
            out on the front lawn looking northward at that
            comet. I am also here out of guilt--my casual, near
            non-involvement with eWorld helped make it Not A
            Sound Business Venture. But ultimately, I am here
            tonight trying to understand the very important
            difference between desirability and desire. Because,
            in the end, I found eWorld <i>desirable</i>, but did
            not actually <i>desire</i> it. I subscribed to the
            concept of eWorld--indeed, I endorsed it. But, after
            consideration, I never used it much. It was, I guess,
            like PBS--comforting to have around, even supported
            during pledge drives, but little-watched because I'm
            a <i>Bravo</i> kind of guy. </p>
            <p>I am hanging at the edge of the virtual crowd
            tonight; <i>lurking</i>, in cyber-parlance. I've been
            wandering from one wake to another, eavesdropping on
            one set of reminiscences after another. I am watching
            the software libraries in the Apple Customer Service
            Center glow white hot from the flurry of downloading,
            even in these last minutes--like an embassy being
            sacked during the collapse of a country. And I am
            trafficking an endless stream of farewell One-on-One
            messages from strangers. <i>Yeah, you too &lt;s&gt;</i>
            has been keyed-in so often tonight that I can type it
            faster than I can trigger a macro. </p>

            <p>My favorite eWorld joke was to compare visiting it
            to playing Myst: Wandering around still and empty
            buildings, almost hearing my echoing footfalls behind
            me, wondering what had happened to everyone. But
            maybe it less about information broking and a great
            deal more about dialogue between individuals. . . </p>
            <p>eWorld and I had a complex relationship--one part
            marriage of convenience, one part lust, one part
            disappointment, and--inevitably--one part annoyance.
            Thrown together out of necessity, we circled each
            other, we flirted, and ultimately we let each other
            down. On one hand, eWorld was the stereotypical
            &#147;friend;&#148; in the films, eWorld would be
            played by a young Tony Randall or Gig Young. On the
            other hand, it was also the <i>film noir</i> queen, a
            Veronica Lake, whose glamour disguised the fact she
            was wasn't what she appeared to be. </p>
            <p>eWorld and I fell in together when I became a
            rabid owner of an Apple Newton MessagePad. After all
            the jokes about the initial flaky handwriting
            recognition have run their course, the MessagePad
            remains an elegant piece of landmark technology--as
            important for what it heralds as for what it is. And
            eWorld was the official, built-in way that Newton
            owners could send and receive e-mail from anywhere in
            the world. With a cellular modem slipped into the
            slot on the device's side, you didn't even need a
            phone cable. </p>
            <p>One simply opened an account with eWorld and told
            one's friends to send any messages there. Your Newton
            would then dial up Apple's online service, sending
            and retrieving e-mail in one go. This is how I got to
            know eWorld. </p>
            <p>On first acquaintance, eWorld was intelligent and
            witty and wrapped up in a sleekness abetted by a
            hi-tech, nightclub walk. When you first visited it,
            eWorld was heady stuff--or, rather, the <i>idea</i>
            of it was. In Apple tradition, it was intended as `an
            online service for the rest us.' Apple's human
            interface expertise had been brought to bear on a
            typical commercial online service in an attempt to
            make it, well, the <i>Mac</i> of information
            delivery. </p>
            <p>The concept of eWorld is still one that fires my
            imagination. It purported to be a <i>spatial</i>
            organization of information--and in this it seemed to
            dwell on the bleeding edge of interface design. </p>
            <p>Many interface design theories advocate a spatial
            approach: One model uses perspective as a visual cue
            for information--perhaps a three-dimensional row of
            file cabinets where those closest (and largest) to
            you is more recent information--those farther away
            (and smaller) is older data. In the commercial arena,
            General Magic's Magic Cap interface is used by Sony
            MagicLink personal digital assistants. There, one
            leaves one's virtual desk and goes down virtual
            hallways and out into a virtual street to get
            information and services. </p>
            <p>eWorld's metaphor was a town--a cityscape. And it
            is this concept that still excites me. Cities are
            laid out on grids, cities organize themselves into
            specialized neighborhoods, and cities are pretty much
            infinitely scalable--at least the virtual kind. As a
            way of organizing and structuring data, it remains a
            compelling idea. </p>
            <p>In eWorld, it was planned that one would
            intuitively enter buildings, depending on the kind of
            information being sought--a library for research, a
            sports arena for baseball scores, a community center
            for live chat, etc. And this, too, held great
            promise, because buildings further divide city space
            and function in more or less rational ways: there are
            floors, office suites, lobby directories, and public
            spaces. And virtual buildings are also infinitely
            scalable. </p>
            <p>There is much to recommend this metaphor and no
            real drawbacks. Except for two things: eWorld, as it
            was foisted on us, was both <i>precious</i> and <i>deceptive</i>.
            </p>
            <p>eWorld was precious in the way that a Beatrix
            Potter tale is; precious in the way that Hugh Grant
            in mid-stammer is; precious in the way that ribbon
            fashioned into a bow around a ponytail is. And I do
            not like precious. Precious leaves me <i>cold</i>.
            For me, cuteness can reach a kind of killing critical
            mass. </p>
            <p>Confronted with the possibility of creating the
            information equivalent of a <i>SimTower</i> embedded
            in a <i>SimCity</i>, Apple decided to opt instead for
            a <i>cartoon</i> town in breathless pastels. It
            irritated me each time I saw it. And,
            psychologically, it never made sense.
            Information--whether for business or casual
            use--cannot help but be colored by its source. This
            is one of the major reasons that doctors mostly
            forego large red latex clown noses when meeting with
            patients. All other things being equal, it stands to
            reason that a diagnosis of six weeks to live is as
            valid when delivered in Bozo garb as not, <i>but</i>.
            . . Apple, however, managed to undermine its
            breakthrough interface concept by being blind to the
            fact that I feel inherently queasy about information
            that is important to me emanating from a place that
            looks as if it has Roger Rabbit as mayor. (&#147;Yes,
            gentlemen, here are the absolutely critical stats on
            which the survival of our company depends--fresh in
            from <i>Toon Town</i>!&#148;) </p>
            <p>The grand vision of a city of information
            succumbed to <i>cuteness</i> before it even reached
            my monitor. One look at all those genderless,
            politically correct eCitizens on those pastel
            eStreets, and I viciously wanted to take a magnifying
            glass to them as if they were an ant hill on a sunny
            day. With its &#147;buildings&#148; designed to be
            giant objects with doors (imagine a seven-story
            desktop computer with glass doors under the floppy
            slot as a place to get hardware and software
            information), and its New-Age purples, whispery
            greens, and happy yellows, and you disconcertingly
            have Expressionism For The Masses--a remake of <i>The</i>
            <i>Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</i> in the manner of <i>Yellow
            Submarine</i>. </p>
            <p>eWorld was also deceptive: Its city metaphor was
            only one screen deep. Once you entered a building,
            spatiality--if you'll pardon the expression--went out
            the window. Yes, there was a graphical nod to lobby
            directories, but then the thing began to fall apart.
            Arrows were unintuitively and perversely used as
            virtual stairs in buildings, and abstract,
            idiosyncratic icons like 90-degree angle brackets
            signalled other sorts of information that would have
            been better served by an extension of the
            architectural metaphor. </p>
            <p>Bottom line, eWorld sold its open interface design
            short. The <i>Toon Town </i>cityscape was a splash
            screen conceit. Lurking just below the surface--and
            bleeding through--was the graphical syntax of a
            standard (albeit quite elegant) online service:
            planar screens nestled in screens, like Russian
            dolls. There is nothing inherently wrong with the old
            screens-within-screens approach--<i>except</i> when
            you tell users that it is a new, improved, even
            unprecedented approach. </p>
            <p>eWorld represented the first time that an
            Apple-designed interface was more cosmetic than
            ergonomic. The Mac and Newton interfaces are good
            examples of the consistent, seamless use of desktop
            and notepad metaphors, respectively. Not so with
            eWorld. </p>
            <p>But tonight, it seems to me that eWorld is somehow
            greater than the sum of its design strategies.
            Tonight, I'm looking past the &#147;interface,&#148;
            to &#147;the rest of us.&#148; </p>

            tableaux of people in mid-teleconversation. </i>Neighbors<i>
            subtly but importantly shifts the concept. A
            neighborhood suggests both social interaction and the
            </i>possiblitity<i> of it. There is much consolation
            in being a part of a neighborhood, even when one is
            not engaged in over-the-fence exchanges. A
            mid-workday neighborhood may look deserted, but there
            remains a visceral sense of </i>place<i>--of
            belonging--if you live there. The potential for
            communication is as powerful as the actual
            conversations. . .</i> </p>
            <p>This is a night awash in emotions and memory. It
            is filled with stream-of-consciousness communication;
            the wild, free-associations of people grappling with
            ways to express what this place has meant to them.
            But from my vantage point, at the edge of the crowd,
            a pattern slowly emerges. And the persistence of this
            pattern transforms it into the <i>leit motif</i> of
            this last evening. No matter where all of these
            rambling, emotion-choked conversations go, it always
            come back to one dopey and finally transcendant
            image: eWorld's little red mail truck. </p>
            <p>When one recieved mail in eWorld, a little red
            cartoon truck would seem to screech around the corner
            and pull up in front of the post office, indicating
            there was something inside for you. When you
            double-clicked the little red truck, you picked up
            your mail. </p>
            <p>And now, the little red truck has become <i>very</i>
            important to everyone. It is frequently mentioned and
            soon it's obvious that it will be the most missed
            thing about eWorld. The little red mail truck has
            become an instant folk image; the mascot of this
            place. </p>
            <p>At first I dismissed it with the same sneer I
            reserve for all things precious, but like the Little
            Engine That Could, the little red mail truck earns my
            begrudging admiration. Because in the cartoonish
            image of the truck, the users of eWorld see
            communication with each other and their community in
            general. In mourning its loss, they are mourning the
            end of eConversations and, yes, eConnection: </p>

            as it tried to pack everything it hadn't gotten
            around to expressing into its final moments. </p>
            <p>Chaos on screen now; honest-to-god <i>panic</i>.
            In their attempt to get their last thoughts online,
            everyone must be hitting <i>Enter</i> after each word
            they type. The screen dissolves into single column of
            words, stretching into infinity. It has become a
            strange, post-modern, and experimental poem; an
            incomprehensible ode to eWorld and its citizens:
            cyber-glossolalia; a collective tribal funeral wail. </p>
            <p>And suddenly something <i>extraordinary</i>. It
            starts at the top of the screen and ripples downward
            at the speed of my monitor's scan rate: <i>See ya,
            goodbye, goodbye, so long, bye, bye, Later, bye, bye,
            goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye,
            bye, bye, bye, bye, bye. . .</i> Hundreds of people
            have synchronized around a single, last sentiment. It
            seems to go on forever as my menu bar clock quietly
            pushes past 3:00 AM. And <i>still</i> the goodbyes
            continue to scroll. </p>
            <p>The farewells cease as quickly as they began. I am
            certain everyone online is like me--transfixed by the
            fact that we are all well into a minute past
            shutdown. Then the screen starts scrolling
            again--this time with that most human of feelings: In
            its final seconds, eWorld is suffused with <i>hope</i>:
            </p>

                worldwide reputation for his innovative work as a
                musician, writer and video maker. And he's a
                favorite here at Dig Magazine. We were excited to
                hear that he had recently set up shop on the web,
                with the debut of<strong> </strong><a

                with inside information on new releases from

                CD (an audio CD which includes a CD ROM track)
                that gives a glimpse of the future, with previews
                of new music from Real World Records, WOMAD and
                Peter Gabriel, as well as innovative multimedia
                projects to explore. </p>
                <p>Gabriel is currently in the midst of writing
                and recording the follow-up to his last album,
                &quot;<strong>US</strong>&quot;. Tracks which may
                appear and have already been heard or released in
                some form are &quot;<strong>Signal To Noise</strong>&quot;
                (performed at the VH-1 concert in Los Angeles)
                and &quot;<strong>Children</strong>&quot;
                (written for Greenpeace), the instrumental &quot;<strong>Seven
                Zero</strong>&quot; (on Real World Notes last CD
                Extra), &quot;<strong>While The Earth Sleep</strong>s&quot;
                (from the film &quot;Strange Days&quot; and
                written with Deep Forest), &quot;<strong>Love
                Town</strong>&quot; (on Real World Notes first CD
                Extra ) and &quot;P<strong>artyman</strong>&quot;
                (from the film &quot;Virtuosity&quot; and
                co-written by Tori Amos and George Acogny). No
                release date has been set. </p>
                <p>Peter has also completed work on a new CD-ROM
                entitled &quot;<a
                href="http://realworld.on.net/rwmm/eve/eve.html"><strong>Eve</strong></a>&quot;.
                The CD is the first to allow a user to take the
                constituent parts of many performances of four PG
                tracks and completely re-construct them, record
                them and play them to your friends. The
                constituent parts of &quot;<strong>Shaking The
                Tree</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>In Your Eyes</strong>&quot;,
                &quot;<strong>Come Talk To Me</strong>&quot; and
                &quot;<strong>Passion</strong>&quot; are all
                hidden away in landscapes designed by artists <strong>Helen
                Chadwick</strong>, <strong>Yayoi Kusama</strong>,
                <strong>Cathy de Moncheaux</strong> and <strong>Nils-Udo</strong>.
                By gathering them and making moral choices,
                meeting artists, scientists and other people in
                or out of love, the player journeys towards the
                paradise that is lost as the story unfolds. EVE
                will be launched as a dual-platform disc for Mac
                and PC this autumn. </p>

                <td valign="top">Described variously as &quot;a
                rare artist&quot; and a &quot;fascinating
                eccentric&quot; with &quot;a painter's sense of
                the real and surreal,&quot; Jane Siberry has made
                a break for it. Siberry has amicably parted ways
                with Reprise Records after 8 years, and started
                her own label, &quot;<a
                href="http://www.sheeba.ca"><strong>Sheeba
                Records</strong></a>&quot;. To celebrate, she has
                released a new album, &quot;<a
                href="http://www.sheeba.ca/teendisco.html"><strong>Teenager</strong></a>&quot;.
                A live album is slated for September. For more
                info about Sheeba, read <a
                href="http://www.sheeba.ca/billlboard.html"><strong>Siberry's
                Sheeba Takes Indie Route</strong></a><strong>.</strong><p>&quot;Teenager&quot;
                features 13 songs written by Jane during her
                teens and recorded in March '96. The collection
                includes the first song she wrote called
                &quot;For My Father&quot; (with a snippet of a
                version recorded at 17 years old!), as well as
                &quot;Trumpeter Swan&quot; (a tribute to an aunt
                that she later named herself after).
                &quot;Teenager&quot; is available only online or
                via mail order. </p>
                <p>Siberry's early work set a benchmark that
                critics began to measure other performers'
                success by. Rolling Stone's review of <strong>Sinead
                O'Connor</strong>'s debut album stated,
                &quot;Sinead has joined the ranks of <strong>Kate
                Bush, Laurie Anderson</strong> and <strong>Jane
                Siberry</strong>, all women who have shattered
                the boundaries of pop music...&quot; </p>
                <p>The singing started while Siberry was a
                student studying microbiology at the University
                of Guelph, just outside of Toronto. Her first
                self-titled, self-released recording was financed
                by the tips she received from waitressing. <strong>No
                Borders Here</strong>, featuring the hit
                &quot;Mimi On The Beach,&quot; marked her major
                label debut three years later. In 1985, Siberry
                released <strong>The Speckless Sky</strong>. It
                yielded Gold status and two People's Choice
                Awards (CASBY) for Album and Producer of the Year
                in her native Canada. </p>
                <p><strong>The Walking</strong>, released in
                1988, marked her debut on Reprise. A subsequent
                tour of Europe, Japan and Australia led to the
                accolades &quot;heart stopping&quot; and
                &quot;spellbinding&quot; from the press across
                both ponds. In 1989, Bound By The Beauty was
                recorded in the middle of an apple orchard. It
                moved away from the multi-layered complexity of
                the previous two albums, towards an acoustic
                simplicity and wry humor. Siberry's next release
                would have to wait four years to see the light of
                day. Recorded between June of 1991 and January of
                1993, <strong>When I Was A Boy</strong> came out
                later that year and yielded &quot;Calling All
                Angels,&quot; which first appeared in Wim
                Wender's film <strong>Until The End Of The World</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>Between releasing When I Was A Boy and
                recording <strong>Maria</strong>, Siberry was
                invited by <strong>Peter Gabriel</strong> to join
                a select group of musicians from around the world
                to participate in his Real World Recording Week
                in Bath, England. The results of the camp-like
                environment appear on three albums released by
                Real World Records. &quot;It was like a huge gift
                to me from Peter Gabriel. I was reminded in one
                week of the power of music generated by the
                musicians who pray when they play. The glamour of
                high tech manipulation (i.e. fix it 'til its
                perfect) was returned to its appropriate
                place.&quot; </p>
                <p>During this time, Siberry also co-wrote and
                recorded the closing title track for the film <strong>The
                Crow</strong>; recorded &quot;Slow Tango&quot;
                for Wim Wender's film <strong>Faraway, So Close</strong>;
                and recorded &quot;She's Like the Swallow&quot;
                for Hector Zazou's recently-released collection <strong>Songs
                from the Cold Seas</strong>. </p>
                <p>In 1994 she was also invited to sing on the
                new <strong>Indigo Girls</strong> Album, Swamp
                Ophelia released on Epic Records. Jane sang on
                two songs, Language Or The Kiss and Mystery. </p>
                <p>Invigorated by her collaborative endeavors,
                Siberry returned to the studio to record
                &quot;Maria&quot;. The release of the album was
                followed by Siberry's first full band tour in six
                years taking her across Canada and the U.S. </p>

                &quot;An ethereal, erudite Canadian chanteuse of
                no fixed hairstyle, Jane Siberry's only artistic
                constant is a &quot;goal to make the best music I
                can make.&quot; From the smart rock of The
                Speckless Sky to the spare simplicity of Bound By
                The Beauty to the Eno co-production When I Was a
                Boy, her idiosyncratic sounds elicit worshipful
                hosannas from critics and the growing cadre of
                Siberry fans.&quot; </p>
                <p><font color="#804000"><em>About her last
                record &quot;Maria&quot;: </em></font><br>
                &quot;Jane was born to wander,&quot; swears
                Rolling Stone. &quot;It's what she does
                best.&quot; On the new Maria, meandering Jane
                sings jazz, a liberating form that fits her
                perfectly. Over the course of three days, Siberry
                recorded 30 hours of rhythmic jams improvised
                around her &quot;shapes,&quot; then spent three
                months adding vocal tracks. The resultant songs
                of lambs, butterflies and yes, sex, include the
                20-minute suite &quot;Oh My My,&quot; the
                minimalist ballad &quot;Goodbye Sweet
                Pumpkinhead&quot; and &quot;Begat Begat,&quot; a
                scat so wild Siberry seems to be speaking in
                tongues. &quot;See the Child&quot; is a nursery
                rhyme with bebop cadences and matches her aim of
                creating music with &quot;enough space in it so
                you can walk in and look around. Like a Dutch
                painting.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                Enjoying the energy derived from the
                collaborative process Jane recently sang and
                wrote words for Nigel Kennedy's songs
                &quot;Innig&quot; on his new recording &quot;<strong>Kafka</strong>&quot;
                (1996 summer release) </p>
                <h3>The NEW news since March 1996: </h3>
                <p>On May 17, Siberry started her own label
                SHEEBA Records. Based out of Toronto, SHEEBA's
                primary purpose is to distribute &quot;all things
                Siberry&quot; including recordings, books and
                films. The first release, &quot;TEENAGER&quot; is
                due for release June 23 and will be a
                &quot;private&quot; release available only
                through SHEEBA via their web-site (www.sheeba.ca)
                or their toll-free number (888-3-SHEEBA).<br>
                <br>
                This summer, 1996, Siberry is doing another short
                sweep of shows including: </p>

<blockquote>
    <h1><img src="../graphics/thetic.gif" width="140"
    height="105"> </h1>
    <h2><font size="4"><em>Words of Wisdom from our Favorite
    Superhero</em></font></h2>
    <p><font color="#000000">&quot;And so, may evil beware and
    may good dress warmly and eat lots of fresh vegetables.&quot;</font>
    </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">&quot;Well, once again my friend, we
    find that science is a two-headed beast. One head is nice, it
    gives us aspirin and other modern conveniences. . . but the
    other head of science is bad! Oh beware the other head of
    science, Arthur, it bites!&quot;</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">&quot;Life is a big wild crazy
    tossed salad, but you don't eat it, no sir! You live
    it!&quot;</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">&quot;You know gang, when you're a
    superhero, you never know where the day will take you. You
    may find yourself halfway around the world in the
    shark-infested waters of true-to-life living. Or you may find
    yourself going down to the store for a lozenge. You can't
    know, can you? No! You gotta ride that wave, you gotta suck
    that lozenge! 'Cause if you don't, who will?&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">&quot;You know Arthur, it's really
    been quite a day. On the outside, on the surface, oh sure, we
    were pursued by Swiss industrial spies, trapped in the belly
    of a whale. But what really pursued us? Where were we really
    trapped? C'mon Arthur! Get Meta with me! What pursued us were
    our own obsessions. I'm good, you're evil. I'm a super hero,
    you're a sidekick. I'm a woman, you're a man. What does it
    all mean? Nothing! And where were we all trapped? I'll tell
    you where Arthur! <b>In the belly of love, love
    chum-LOVE.&quot;</b></font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">&quot;You know Arthur, when you
    spend two months riding around on a really big man, you start
    to learn a few things about yourself. You learn that it is a
    really great thing to stay on Earth and live in a place that
    has no arms or legs of its own. And most importantly, Arthur,
    you learn how to close you eyes and tell yourself that this
    just isn't happening to me. So, did you miss me?&quot;</font>
    </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">&quot;<b>You know Arthur, when evil
    is afoot and you don't have any arms, you gotta use your
    head. And when evil is ahead and you're behind you gotta do
    the legwork. But when you can't get a leg up, you gotta be
    hip . . .&quot;</b></font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">&quot;You know though today was the
    worst day of my life, I learned many things. First, the world
    looks a lot different when you're six inches tall and covered
    in feathers. Second, two heads are definitely not better than
    one. And finally you can lay an egg and still feel like a
    man.&quot;</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">&quot;You know, come to think of it,
    I'm not afraid of ants. I never was. It's just when they all
    come running out of a lady's pants like that...yech...creepy.
    And isn't sanity really just a one trick pony anyway? I mean
    if all you get is one trick, rational thinking, but when
    you're good and crazy, oooh oooh oooh,<b> </b>the sky is the
    limit!&quot;</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">&quot;So once again, we find that
    the evil of the past seeps into the present like salad
    dressing through cheap wax paper mixing memory and
    desire.&quot; SPOON!</font> </p>

    <p>Publishers have the advantage when it comes to content.
    The Hearst Corporation publishes <b>Country Living</b>, <b>Good
    Housekeeping</b>, <b>National Gardening</b>, <b>Popular
    Mechanics</b>, <b>Redbook</b> and others, and has drawn them
    together in a classy Web site called Homearts. </p>
    <p>From the Homearts home page, you can jump to 4 main
    topics: <b>Food</b>, <b>Health, Home and Garden</b>, and <b>Relationships</b>,
    as well as to the individual magazines, e-mail and more. The
    nice thing about this site is that there is content exclusive
    to Homearts, as well as that which is culled from the various
    magazines. In my book, the only reason for any
    publisher/publication to be on the web is to extend their
    content not mirror it. Homearts does just that. </p>
    <p>Follow the Food section link, and you will stumble across
    the <a href="http://homearts.com/waisform/recipe.htm"><b>Recipe
    Finder</b></a>. After answering a few questions-type of dish,
    main ingredient, and preparation time; you submit the
    information to the Web site (see <a href="netbits.htm"><strong>net.bits</strong></a>
    for information on Internet Security). You are then presented
    with a recipe that you can print, save, ignore, or whatever.
    I searched for Fried Chicken and was presented with several
    recipes. Click here to see the <a href="chicken.htm"><strong>Seasoned
    Country-Fried Chicken</strong></a> recipe. </p>
    <p>The Health link jumps to many articles relating to health,
    as well as a few celebrity profiles (Linda McCartney, Lauren
    Bacall and more). </p>
    <p>The Home and Garden link leads to a wealth of material
    broken into <b>Houses &amp; Homes</b>, <b>Decorating &amp;
    Remodeling</b>, <b>Gardening</b> and <b>Market Place</b>
    (which hopes to help you spend your money) all culled from
    Country Living, Good Housekeeping, Popular Mechanics, <b>Home
    and Land</b>, National Gardening magazines and more. I have
    only scratched the surface of Homearts, but if you are a home
    owner or gardener, I'm sure you'll find a lot to like here. </p>

    claims to be the central site for the home and garden
    enthusiast. Let's see. </p>
    <p>The February 19th issue features included: <b>Isamu

    more. There are a few spots here that are still under
    construction, but as it is, there is already enough to
    warrant a return. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Billed as the world's first on-air and online interactive
    showcase for computers, multimedia, and digital technologies,
    c/net is a media company built from the ground up for today's
    wired culture. And c/net is currently my favorite site on the
    net. People who love computers, software, the Internet,
    music, and video (just about all of my favorite things) will
    love this place-and the content is as deep as it gets. With
    over 20,000 pages of information, a user could spend hours
    here and barely scratch the surface. The site is also updated
    daily, so you may find yourself coming back often. You must
    have a PC which supports multimedia to really enjoy all that
    c|net has to offer. You'll also get the most out of this site
    with <a
    href="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/mirror/index.html"><b>Netscape
    Navigator 2.0</b></a><b> </b>(see <a href="netbits.htm">net.bits</a>).
    <i>c|net exploits all of 2.0's plug-ins and extensions: </i><b><i>Java</i></b><i>,
    </i><b><i>Frames</i></b><i>, </i><a
    href="http://www.realaudio.com/products/ra2.0/"><b><i>Realaudio</i></b></a>,
    etc., though <a href="http://www.microsoft.com"><b>Microsoft's
    Internet Explorer</b></a> also does a nice job with it's
    support of Realaudio, tables and more. As c|net ads around
    the Internet proclaim, <i>&quot;click here to torture test
    your browser&quot;</i>. If you don't have any of the above
    don't worry, your browser will just ignore all of the bells
    and whistles. </p>
    <p>C|net has 6 main sections: <b>News, Radio, Features,
    Reviews, Personalities</b> and <b>Product Finder</b>. When
    viewed with Navigator 2.0, you'll see animated, scrolling
    billboards (<i>almost like sitting on the beach, except
    they're not selling Beer, Crabs or Pizza</i>), which are in
    reality little Java applets/scripts running. If you download
    Realaudio and jump to the Radio section, you will be treated
    to something rather stunning, Realaudio-literally. Click on
    an audio clip, and the Realaudio player loads and you are
    treated to several minutes of a radio news broadcast, except
    this radio station is available only on the net. Realaudio is
    neat because it begins the audio playback during the
    download, which is great. No more waiting 10 minutes to find
    out you downloaded something worthless. Take the guided
    Realaudio tour of c|net, and you will instantly see that the
    online revolution is indeed in full swing. </p>
    <p>There is also a TV version, <b>c|net central</b>-a
    televised account of the digital world, which airs six times
    each weekend on cable television's USA Network and the Sci-Fi
    Channel. </p>
    <p>For you downloading fiends, c|net offers <b>Shareware.com </b>(http://www.shareware.com/),
    a massive collection of-you guessed it-shareware. There are
    tons of files for any platform here, and whether you're
    looking for the latest version of Netscape or your favorite
    utility, you're bound to find it here. Sound like I like this
    place? You bet! </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Boot that 286 and fire up your old 1200 baud modem, cause
    this month we're in search of Web sites that will make you
    want to throw either the 286, or this magazine out the
    window. Your choice. </p>
    <p>But you know, the Web would be quite boring if there were <i>only</i>
    little reviews like Hotlinks (and I guess if you're not on
    the net, the pain could be worse). So, why not nudge you in a
    couple of directions, cut back on the verbiage, and from
    there you're on your own. We'll event start with a couple of
    sites that will help you find your own Web pleasures. </p>
    <h3 align="left"><a href="http://www.search.com">Search.com</a></h3>
    <p>Search.com aims to be all you'll need to track anything
    down on the Internet and it succeeds. Another effort from
    those guys at <a href="http://www.cnet.com">C|NET</a> (see <a
    href="../3-96/hotlinks.htm">March '96 Hotlinks</a>),
    Search.com features all your favorite search engines
    (Alta-Vista, Infoseek, Excite, Yahoo, etc.) as well as a
    bunch of others you may not have been aware of. </p>
    <h3 align="left"><a href="http://www.iguide.com"><img

    <p>Billed as the definitive guide to the Internet, with
    20,000 site reviews, original features, news, entertainment
    and more, IGUIDE is the Internet version of TV Guide. </p>
    <h3 align="left"><a href="http://www.epicurious.com"><img
    src="../graphics/epicurou.gif" border="0" width="220"
    height="44"></a></h3>
    <p>Are you into Eating, Drinking, and playing with your food?
    Then be sure to check out the curious Epicurious Web site.
    Featuring recipes from Bon Appetit and Gourmet Magazine. Very
    slick. We've even included a Caesar Salad recipe for your
    dining pleasure. </p>
    <h3 align="left"><a href="http://pathfinder.com">Time
    Warner's Pathfinder</a></h3>
    <p>Slowly we turn to face the corporate, commercial
    web-beast. Time-Warner's web site is massive, with over 65
    links to things Timey: Time, Money, Life, People, Sports
    Illustrated, Fortune, Entertainment Weekly-well the list goes
    on and on. For our audience, we'll highlight a couple of the
    primarily on-line only efforts at Pathfinder. </p>
    <h3 align="left"><a href="http://pathfinder.com/vg">The
    Virtual Garden</a></h3>
    <p>Featuring gardening content from Sunset and Southern
    Living magazines, as well as excerpts from Alan Lacy's
    Homeground Newsletter, the Virtual Garden is an online
    gardening site as seen through the corporate eye of
    Time-Warner, and a bit stodgy and safe at that (are we not
    biased?). We will however offer a thumbs-up to the Time-Life
    Gardening Library; the heart of this site and a great
    gardening resource. </p>
    <h3 align="left"><a href="http://pathfinder.com/grooves">Grooves
    CD and Music Magazine Online</a></h3>
    <p>Online version of the CD-Rom music magazine Grooves. From

    articles on many artists, music news and more. </p>
    <h3 align="left"><a href="http://www.hotwired.com">Hotwired</a></h3>
    <p>The online cousin to Wired Magazine (our favorite InSync
    magazine), Hotwired is a text-book example of how to
    translate a magazine to the Web. Add to it! Even ignore the
    printed version if you have to. Politics, the Net, Music,
    Software, Culture and more are here. There's way too much
    here to even begin to tell you about it. Do not pass go, go
    directly to Hotwired. </p>

    <h1><font size="5"><strong>Tips on Buying and Storing with
    Recipes</strong></font></h1>
    <p>For best quality, select peaches that are firm to slightly
    soft and free from bruises. Peaches bruise easily if
    squeezed. The best sign of ripeness in a peach is a creamy or
    golden undertone, often called &#147;ground color.&#148; The
    rosy &#147;blush&#148; on a peach is not a good indicator of
    ripeness and differs from one variety to the next. Fresh
    peach fragrance also indicates ripeness. Avoid peaches with a
    green ground color, as they lack flavor and usually shrivel
    and become tough rather than ripen. Peaches that are picked
    green may develop more juice, but they will not become
    sweeter. </p>
    <p>Peaches become fully ripe and soft in three to four days
    when kept at room temperature in a loosely closed bag or
    ripening bowl. Store fully ripe peaches in the refrigerator
    and, for best quality, use within three to four days. For the
    best peachy taste, serve fragrant ripe peaches at room
    temperature. Choose: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Slightly under-ripe peaches for pickling; </p>
        <p>Firm-ripe peaches for canning and drying; </p>
        <p>Fully ripe peaches for freezing or eating fresh; </p>
        <p>Very ripe peaches, without any signs of mold or rot,
        for making sweet spreads. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If a recipe calls for peeled peaches, dip peaches into
    boiling water for about 30 seconds, then plunge them
    immediately into iced water. The skins will slip right off.
    Fresh peaches darken quickly when exposed to air. Powdered
    ascorbic acid (vitamin C) sprinkled on peaches or mixed with
    syrup keeps them bright and fresh looking for recipes or
    preserving. </p>
    <h3>Nutritional Information*</h3>
    <p>Although fresh high-quality peaches are sweet tasting,
    they are low in calories, with one medium peach furnishing
    only about 37 calories. Yellow-fleshed varieties are a good
    source of Vitamin A. Remember, making peach jam or canning
    peaches in sugar syrup add calories. </p>

        <p>*per 1/2 C. serving </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Quick `N Fresh Ideas</h3>
    <p>Use pureed fresh peaches in fruit punch, milkshakes and as
    a basting sauce to brush over grilled meat or poultry. </p>
    <p>Peach halves are delicious barbecued. Sprinkle peaches
    with ginger and brown sugar, thread on skewers and grill
    until the sugar caramelizes. Serve with meat, fish or
    poultry. </p>
    <p>For a quick breakfast make <b>Peach Slush</b>: In a
    blender, whirl until smooth 1 cup peaches (fresh or drained
    canned) with 1/2 cup milk, 4 ice cubes and one cup (one
    8-ounce container) of plain, lemon or vanilla yogurt. Pour
    into two chilled glasses and garnish with peach slice. If
    slightly frozen peaches are used, omit ice cubes. </p>
    <h3>Peach Crunch Bars</h3>
    <p>Homemade granola is wonderful in this recipe! </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>1 C. all -purpose flour </p>
        <p>1 C. whole wheat flour </p>
        <p>1/2 C. brown sugar, packed </p>
        <p>1/2 C. honey </p>
        <p>1/2 C. margarine, melted </p>
        <p>2 C. peaches, fresh, frozen or drained canned </p>
        <p>2 C. granola </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Grease 9-inch square baking pan. Combine flours, brown
    sugar and granola in a large bowl. Stir in honey and melted
    margarine until mixture is crumbly. Press half the mixture
    into the baking pan and arrange sliced peaches on top.
    Sprinkle remaining mixture on the top. Bake at 350 degree F
    for 30 minutes. Cool in pan before cutting into bars. </p>
    <p>Yield: 12 bars </p>
    <h3>Peach Variety Availability</h3>
    <p>Peaches are classified either as clingstone or freestone
    according to how difficult it is to remove the pit.
    Clingstone peaches are used primarily for canning. Freestone
    peaches are available from late June until early September. </p>
    <h3>Peach Shortcakes with Bergamot Flowers</h3>
    <p>Bergamot flowers add a special sweetness and colorful
    accent to this classic all-American dessert. </p>
    <p>Eight Three-Inch Shortcakes </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>6 to 8 very ripe peaches, peeled and sliced </p>
        <p>1 tablespoon lemon juice </p>
        <p>1 to 2 tablespoons sugar </p>
        <p>2 to 3 tablespoons bergamot flowers </p>
        <p>2 cups unbleached white flour </p>
        <p>1 tablespoon baking powder </p>
        <p>Scant 1/2 teaspoon salt </p>
        <p>3 tablespoons sugar </p>
        <p>6tablespoons unsalted butter </p>
        <p>1 cup half-and-half with 1 tablespoon bergamot flowers
        </p>
        <p>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted </p>
        <p>Whipping cream or vanilla ice cream </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Preheat over to 425F and lightly butter a baking sheet. </p>
    <p>Toss the peaches in a bowl with the lemon juice, sugar,
    and half of the bergamot flowers. If the fruit is tart, use
    the larger amount of sugar; if it is sweet, use less. Reserve
    the remaining flowers for garnishing the dessert. </p>
    <p>Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and 2 tablespoons
    of the sugar in a bowl or food processor. Cut the butter into
    the mixture until it is a coarse meal. Add the half-and-half
    with the bergamot flowers to the dry ingredients and mix
    until just blended; do not overmix. </p>
    <p>Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead 8 to 10
    times. Roll or pat the dough to about 3/4 inch thick. Using a
    3-inch cutter, cut out rounds, using all the dough. </p>
    <p>Place the rounds of dough on the baking sheet, brush the
    tops with the melted butter, and sprinkle them with the
    reserved tablespoon of sugar. </p>
    <p>Bake the cakes in the center of the oven for 12 to 14
    minutes, or until golden brown. Cool the shortcakes for at
    least 5 minutes before splitting them open; they are best
    served warm, but are good at room temperature. </p>
    <p>To assemble the shortcakes, split them in half. Place a
    spoonful of fruit on the bottom half with a bit of the juice.
    Add a dollop of whipped cream or a spoonful of ice cream and
    cover with the top half of the shortcake. Repeat layers of
    fruit and cream and garnish the top with a few peach slices.
    Scatter the reserved bergamot blossoms over the desserts and
    serve immediately. </p>

                after the millennial quake. Neon rain. Light
                everywhere blowing under any door you might try
                to close. Where the New Buildings, the largest in
                the world, erect themselves unaided, their slow
                rippling movements like the contractions of a
                sea-creature. <br>
                <br>
                Colin Laney is here looking for work. He is not,
                he is careful to point out, a voyeur. He is an
                intuitive fisher of patterns of information, the
                &quot;signature&quot; a particular individual
                creates simply by going about the business of
                living. But Laney knows how to sift for the
                interesting (read: dangerous) bits. Which makes
                him very useful--to certain people. <br>
                <br>
                Chia McKenzie is here on a rescue mission. She's
                fourteen. Her idol is the singer Rez, of the band
                Lo/Rez. When the Seattle chapter of the Lo/Rez
                fan club decided that he might be in trouble, in
                Tokyo, they sent Chia to check it out. <br>
                <br>
                Rei Toei is the beautiful, entirely virtual media
                star adored by all Japan. The idoru. And Rez has
                declared that he will marry her. This is the
                rumor that brought Chia to Tokyo. But the things
                that bother Rez are not the things that bother
                most people. <br>
                <br>
                Is something different here, in the very nature
                of reality? Or is it that something violently New
                is about to happen? It's possible the idoru is as
                real as she wants or needs to be--or as real as
                Rez desires. When Colin Laney looks into her dark
                eyes, trying hard to think of her as no more than
                a hologram, he sees things he's never seen
                before. He sees how she might break a man's
                heart. <br>
                <br>
                And, whatever else may be true, the idoru and the
                powerful interests surrounding her are enough to
                put all their lives in danger. </font></td>

                is sacred in Michael Moore's hilarious screed on
                the state of America, Downsize This! With the
                same in-your-face tenacity that has made him
                everyman's hero, Moore gets under the skin of
                corporate giants, politicians, lobbyists, and the
                media--anyone who has made life tougher for the
                millions of Americans who are working longer
                hours for less pay and have had enough. <br>
                <br>
                Moore brings his wit and working-class voice to a
                public desperate to save what's left of their
                American dream. His take-no-prisoners attitude is
                brutally funny, insightful, and irrepressible.
                Whether's he lusting after the First Lady in
                &quot;My Forbidden Love for Hillary Clinton&quot;
                or sending campaign contributions to Pat Buchanan
                from the John Wayne Gacey Fan Club, conducting a
                Rodney King Commemorative Riot or trying to
                commit Congressman Bob Dornan to a mental
                hospital, issuing Corporate Crook Trading Cards,
                or encouraging Congress to take advantage of
                NAFTA by moving themselves to Tiajuana, Michael
                Moore has the unique gift for making you think
                and laugh at the same time. <br>
                <br>
                He reflects an irreverent intelligence and biting
                humor so seldom heard today. Downsize This! is
                the perfect antidote to the mind-numbing throb of
                the election year. </font><p><font

                dead--and the weight, literally, of the world
                falls on Jack Ryan's shoulders, in Tom Clancy's
                newest and most extraordinary novel. <br>
                <br>
                I don't know what to do. Where's the manual, the
                training course, for this job? Whom do I ask?
                Where do I go? <br>
                <br>
                Debt of Honor ended with Tom Clancy's most
                shocking conclusion ever; a joint session of
                Congress destroyed, the President dead, most of
                the Cabinet and the Congress dead, the Supreme
                Court and the Joint Chiefs likewise. Dazed and
                confused, the man who only minutes before had
                been confirmed as the new Vice-President of the
                United States is told that he is now President. <br>
                <br>
                President John Patrick Ryan. <br>
                <br>
                And that is where Executive Orders begins. Ryan
                had agreed to accept the vice-presidency only as
                a caretaker for a year, and now, suddenly an
                incalculable weight has fallen on his shoulders.
                How do you run a government without a government?
                Where do you even begin? With stunning force,
                Ryan's responsibilities crush on him. He must
                calm an anxious and grieving nation, allay the
                skepticism of the world's leaders, conduct a
                swift investigation of the tragedy, and arrange a
                massive state funeral--all while attempting to
                reconstitute a Cabinet and a Congress with the
                greatest possible speed. <br>
                <br>
                But that is not all. Many eyes are on him now,
                and many of them are unfriendly. In Beijing,
                Tehran, and other world capitals, including
                Washington D.C., there are those eager to take
                advantage where they may, some of whom bear a
                deep animus toward the United States--some of
                whom, from Ryan's past, harbor intense animosity
                toward the new President himself. Soon they will
                begin to move on their opportunities; soon they
                will present Jack Ryan with a crisis so big even
                he cannot imagine it. <br>
                <br>
                Tom Clancy has written remarkable novels before,
                but nothing comparable to the timeliness and
                drama of Executive Orders. Filled with the
                exceptional realism and intricate plotting that
                are his hallmarks, it attests to the words of the
                St. Louis Post-Dispatch: &quot;This man can tell
                a story.&quot;</font></td>

            whenever we have gone for a walk in the woods, any
            woods in the Northeast, I have kept my eye on the
            ground. Not from fear of stumbling or losing my way,
            but simply because I don't want to miss a thing,
            either plant or animal. After all, the views above
            are merely the same old brown tree branches
            silhouetted against the same old blue or gray sky.</font>

        </tr>
    </table>
    <p><font color="#000000">One of the plants that I'm always
    looking for is the<b> maidenhair fern.</b> I consider it one
    of the most beautiful ferns in the forest, but it's not
    common. Once found it's duly admired, occasionally
    photographed but never dug, for most large nurseries stock
    this fern.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">The maidenhair fern is but one of
    the many beautiful members of this family, which includes
    some of the oldest plants on the face of the earth. When you
    look at a typical fern, you are looking at a plant that
    stretches back some 350 million years to the Paleozoic era,
    when the carbonized remains of these plants formed the vast
    coal beds that are mined today. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">In spring the new, coiled fronds
    (called fiddleheads) emerge from the ground. From then until
    early winter, when the fronds stand out against virgin snow
    like pen lines on paper, ferns are delightful additions to
    the shady garden.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Ferns number some ten thousand
    species worldwide, far fewer than the three hundred thousand
    species of seed-bearing plants. Yet with some one hundred
    species available for cultivation in a fern bed, they become
    an interesting plant family for the gardener who wants to
    specialize. In a reasonably small area, a number of species
    may be grown. Soil should be light and moist. Heavy soils can
    be adapted to fern culture with the addition of leaf mold or
    peat moss. Their roots are thin and wiry and, except for a
    few species (the hay-scented fern, <i>Dennstaedtia
    punctilobula</i>, for example, and the common bracken, <i>Pteridium
    aquilinum</i>), resent the thickness of clay soil. Sandy
    soils must also contain humus to provide the constant
    moisture that fern roots require-though only a few species
    can tolerate standing water. If water is needed, the gardener
    can easily supply it with a hose on a weekly schedule.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Bring in a few rocks to help vary
    the terrain if your backyard is unnaturally (for Ferns) flat.
    In nature these plants ramble over gentle slopes or sprout
    from a tiny bit of leaf litter lodged between boulders.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Our fern garden is built against the
    eastern corner of the north side of the house. We used field
    stones to build a low wall to contain the royal fern. The
    ground in front of the wall was mostly clay, so after
    removing the second rate turf that makes up our lawn, I
    worked in a bale of partially moistened peat moss and a
    bushel of leaf litter from the woods.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">A nearby gutter provides a great
    deal of moisture during and after rains. When rains are
    sparse, I haul out the hose to keep the soil moist.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Light is bright on the fern bed most
    of the day. But the only sun that falls on the ferns in front
    of the wall is in late afternoon, and much of that is shaded
    by the lower branches of a weeping birch.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">The centerpiece of the garden is a
    cultivar of the royal fern (<i>Osmunda regalis var.
    spectabilis</i>), Osmunda being a form of Osmunder, a name
    for Thor, the Scandinavian deity. Roots of this fern when
    gathered in Florida have been used as a potting medium for
    orchids. In their native haunts, royal ferns can reach ten
    feet in height, but this particular type settles for six feet
    in the garden. The parent of this cultivar is at home in the
    northern woods and does need attention to watering; in nature
    it's often found growing next to streams or directly in bogs.
    If given adequate moisture it can tolerate some sun, but it
    does better in light shade. The manner of growth is a crown
    rather than runners, so the plant spreads slowly. Leaflets
    turn golden brown in autumn.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Another Osmunda is the cinnamon fern
    (<i>O. cinnamomea</i>) noted for its fertile leaves-bright
    green at first but turning to a rich cinnamon brown and
    resembling the sticks used to mull cider. The stalks are also
    dressed with woolly tufts of cinnamon color but bear vigorous
    sterile leaves without <i>sori</i>; this fern thrives in
    moist, acid soil. The interrupted fern (<i>O. claytonia</i>)
    has two or more fertile leaves that interrupt the normal
    leaves on the stem.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Christmas fern (<i>Polystichum
    acrostichoides</i>) is, as its name implies, green for
    Christmas, and cut fronds make excellent holiday decorations.
    The genus name refers to the several rows of sori, or <i>stichoi</i>;
    the species name likens this fern to another genus. Plants
    grow about three feet high. Its sterile leaves remain green
    throughout the winter while the others wither, although
    sterile leaflets are often burned with frost. This fern will
    take some sun if given damp soil, but likes shade. It
    transplants well.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Sensitive or bead ferns <i>(Onoclea
    sensiblis</i>) are grown both for their leaves, which are
    decidedly unfernlike, and their spore-bearing fertile spikes,
    which look like beaded feathers and were very popular in
    Victorian times for dried arrangements and shadow-bow
    pictures (along with coils of human and animal hair). The
    genus is from the Greek<i> onos</i>, &quot;vessel,&quot; and<i>
    kleio</i>, &quot;to close&quot;, referring to the closely
    rolled fertile fronds. They are termed sensitive because the
    leaves die quickly when first touched by frost. But for most
    of the year they offer a pleasing contrast to the typically
    ferny look of the others. They do become invasive when
    conditions are right but have never been a problem in our
    garden. They will grow in partial shade.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Lady fern (<i>Athyrium filix-femina</i>)
    grows about thirty inches tall and likes a position in moist,
    partial shade, though it will live-but not well-in full sun
    up north, never in the South. The name comes from the
    delicate structure of the leaflets, which are very finely
    cut. The genus is from <i>athyro</i>, &quot;to sport,&quot;
    and refers to the many different shapes found among the sori;
    <i>filix</i> is Latin for &quot;fern&quot;</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><i>Asplenium</i>, the spleenwort, is
    usually evergreen with simple or deeply cut or compound
    leaves. The botanical name is from <i>a</i>, &quot;not&quot;,
    and <i>splen</i>, &quot;spleen&quot;, since the genus was
    formerly thought to be a medicine for ailments of the spleen,
    but named, such treatments were already out of style. Ebony
    spleenwort, <i>A. platyneuron</i>, is a good choice for a
    spot in a shady rock garden. Although many of these ferns
    grow best in the more alkaline soils found near limestone
    rock, the ebony spleenwort is also at home in acid soil.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><i>Matteuccia pensylvanica</i>, the
    ostrich fern, reaches heights of three feet and is great for
    backgrounds. It was named in honor of C. Matteucci
    (1800-1868), an Italian physicist. Because these ferns take
    more sun than most, you'll often find them at the edge of a
    woods, lining an old country road, especially if they have a
    wet ditch for a rhizome- or root run. New plants appear by
    runners.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Another choice for an initial fern
    garden is the florist's fern <i>(Dryopteris spinulosa</i>),
    known also as the spinulose wood fern. When approaching a
    grove of these plants in the woods, you see the archetypal
    fern. For cut flowers, this fern usually supplies the greens
    in the arrangement. The <i>dryad</i> in the genus name is a
    wood nymph, and it refers to this fern's fairylike qualities.
    Florist's fern needs light shade and must be well watered to
    prevent burning of the fronds. Plants grow about thirty
    inches tall and form crowns. One, Goldie's fern (<i>D.goldiana</i>),
    is found in rich woods and has an elusive quality, though it
    reaches four feet and produces leaves a foot wide when
    growing in a happy site.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">As for the elusive maidenhair, it is
    the reason I keep my eyes on the ground when I walk in the
    woods. The botanical name of this fern of great beauty is <i>Adiantum
    pedatum</i>, from<i> adiantos</i>, or &quot;dry&quot;, for
    when it rains, the droplets shy away just like beads of
    mercury and the fronds remain dry. The fan-shaped, light
    green leaflets are atop shiny, near-black stalks, and the
    grace of this plant is evident to all. Fronds grow between
    twelve and twenty-four inches tall and spread slowly in
    partial shade. Every so often a dwarf form is offered by
    nurseries.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">All these ferns will tolerate
    temperatures to -20 F and will thrive in areas of filtered
    sunlight, the kind of light found near the forest floor.</font>
    </p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Christmas is the busiest time of year for Bonsai sales,
    they are a hot impulse item. The small trees with their tiny
    leaves and flowers or a miniature landscape are hard to
    resist whether you are a novice or experienced Bonsai
    enthusiast. </p>
    <p>If you are considering a Bonsai tree for that special
    person (including yourself), there are a few things you
    should know to ensure that you end up with a nice healthy
    tree. First you should decide if you want a hardy outdoor
    tree or if an indoor Bonsai is more appropriate. Think about
    the conditions the tree will be in. Indoor Bonsai will
    generally need to be close to an east, west or south window
    or be supplemented with artificial light. Fluorescent lights
    close to the tree usually work well. Indoor Bonsai almost
    always need more humidity than a house has, especially in the
    winter. A small tray with gravel and a little bit of water
    under the tree will add humidity around the tree. A spritz on
    the leaves also helps. Also the proud owner of a new indoor
    Bonsai tree needs to be consistent with the care. It may not
    need to be watered every day but it should be checked daily
    as the small pots can dry out rather quickly. </p>
    <p>Hardy Bonsai need a winter dormancy. These are the
    conifers, pines and deciduous trees. One common tree is the
    juniper. They will not generally survive in your living room
    window unless it's cool. An unheated room, porch or cool
    basement is needed, they can be heeled into a garden, put in
    a garage or under a deck. Just don't forget to water on warm
    sunny days. </p>
    <p>You should always buy from a reputable Bonsai dealer. They
    should have specific care information such as cold hardiness
    and light requirements. Make sure you know what kind of tree
    it is. A serissa and a carmona both have small shiny leaves
    and white flowers but they require different light and water
    conditions. If you know the name you can always get any
    information you need. The public library has lots of good
    Bonsai care books. </p>
    <p>When you see a tree you like, check a few things before
    you buy. Look for a free draining soil. Be wary of soil
    completely covered with glued on rocks of moss as it's not
    healthy for the tree. Look at the bottom of the pot to make
    it has drain holes for excess water. It should be secure in
    the pot. A wobbly tree could mean that it doesn't have an
    established root system. A taper to the trunk is nice to have
    since it makes it look more like a tree than a cutting stuck
    in the soil. </p>
    <p>Look at the tree overall, checking branches and both sides
    of the leaves for any sign of insects or fungus. Insects are
    a fact of life but you definitely don't want to take any home
    with you. Also look at any other trees that are around. If
    you see dead or sick trees, check yours carefully especially
    if they are touching each other. </p>
    <p>So now you've found the perfect tree and brought it home
    or gave it as a gift. Most trees will react to a change in
    their environment, some naturally more than others, usually
    shedding some leaves. But with some good old T.L.C., a
    healthy tree will bounce back. </p>
    <p>This may seem like a lot to do to just to buy a little
    tree, but it's no different than any other informed purchase,
    just as you wouldn't buy a fish without having a special home
    for it. You should have a special home for your Bonsai tree.
    These few minutes of your time before hand can turn into a
    lifetime of enjoyment. </p>

    <p>Some years ago when I decided to admit to being a
    gardener, I never considered using the activity for anything
    more than a hobby. Then after people asked me about plants,
    soil, the weather (always the weather), I started writing
    books dealing with specific garden subjects. That worked so
    well that over the past twenty years I've both written and
    illustrated eighteen garden books on subjects ranging from
    ornamental grasses to perennial borders to rock gardens to
    all annuals found on today's market. But you could have
    knocked me over with a loaded wheelbarrow when Fugazy Travel
    of Asheville asked me to be a tour leader to the gardens of
    Southern England. </p>
    <p>Of course I said yes. So last May our group of thirty
    including my wife, Jean and Bob Weiler, president of the firm
    and also a member of the Men's Garden Club of Asheville, left
    the Charlotte Airport on a BOAC flight to Gatwick. Once the
    luggage was unloaded, there was no time for jetlag as we
    immediately boarded our personal bus and drove to <b>Folly
    Farm</b>, one of the most beautiful creations of garden
    genius Gertrude Jekyll and architect Edward Lutyens. From
    there we raced to the Royal Horticultural Society's<b> Wisley
    Gardens</b> for a personal tour of all the experimental
    garden plots, plus a needed hour in one of the biggest garden
    book centers not only in England but in the world. </p>
    <p>That night after we enjoyed a wonderful dinner in a small
    and charming hotel in Cirencester (since the Common Market,
    English food is sophisticated and ample), we slept the sleep
    of the garden initiates and woke up the next morning to face
    a delicious English breakfast, then a tour of<b> Hodges Farm
    Barn</b>, a lovely and small garden about six miles down the
    road from <b>Harrowgate</b>, the organic farm belonging to
    Prince Charles ( &quot;It's the royal muck,&quot; said Mr.
    Hodge, &quot; that I haul from Harrowgate, that makes my
    garden grow so beautifully!&quot;), get personal advice on
    how he started his water garden, and also getting prepped for
    the afternoon visit to <b>Rosemary Verey</b>'s marvelous
    perennial borders and her imaginative kitchen garden where
    lettuce is treated as a colorful annual. </p>
    <p>Rosemary is an old friend of mine and our paths have
    crossed at many garden conventions and horticultural seminars
    across the country. She took us to the hidden part of her
    garden where she grows all the extra plants needed to fill in
    the gaps in the kitchen garden when the lettuces bolt or too
    many friends want samples. </p>
    <p>Over the next few days we visited <b>Stourhead House and
    Gardens</b> (stately is the only word that applies); <b>Castle
    Drogo</b> ( the roses are superb); <b>Trewithen (</b> where
    else would you see tree ferns over ten feet tall); and<b>
    Forde Abbey</b> (a great water garden and a lovely rock
    garden designed by Jack Drake). The first week's penultimate
    tour was a stop at <b>St. Michael's Mount</b>, where our bus
    driver told us we would be the only Americans there since
    they generally never stop at places where walking or climbing
    is necessary. </p>
    <p><b>St. Michael's Mount</b>: what a glorious view from the
    top. On the way up the steep and rocky path to the main
    gardens, we looked out to sea and there basking was a giant
    shark slowly floating his way along the edge of the mount,
    looking for more breakfast seaweed while distant helicopters
    were landing at the government's emergency airport for sea
    and air rescue. </p>
    <p>Twice a day the 75 year old owner of St. Michael's Mount
    walks from the top of the 600 foot rock down to the village
    post office, then back up the twisting pathway, chatting on
    the way with the various visitors that come from all parts of
    the world but mostly England, Germany, and France. The
    gardens were originally created by two maiden aunts who spent
    some thirty years climbing up and down the rocky hillsides
    planting all kinds of tropical perennials and annuals in
    crevices and cairns, sometimes hanging on nothing but a few
    ropes. </p>
    <p>The present day gardener told me that because of climate
    changes, they now take about a thousand cuttings every year
    then store them in various glass houses against the time when
    the island is battered by fierce winter storms and
    temperatures fall way below freezing, a circumstance that is
    happening with increased frequency as the climate changes
    along the Cornish Coast. </p>
    <p>In the second week we hit <b>Sissinghurst and Great
    Dixter,</b> the first being in the best shape its been in
    fifteen years and Christopher Lloyd's great creation in
    perfect shape, too, and full of the flowers that bloom their
    best towards the end of May. We saw poppies where perfection
    was the rule, not a chance circumstance, iris to beat the
    band, white wisterias bending over walls carpeted with golden
    wallflowers, their sweet fragrance meeting the receptive
    noses of all those in attendance. </p>
    <p>In the spring of 1993 I met Doug Goodyear, the head
    gardener of <b>Hever Castle</b>, at the Portland Garden Show
    where we were both featured speakers. I talked on the evening
    garden and he told people of the difficulties of being in a
    garden family that had been controlling the development of
    Hever for several generations. I told him I would be over in
    England at Hever in late May, and he said: &quot;When you get
    there ring the bell by the castle door and I'll come out and
    give you a personal tour.&quot; We did, and it was grand. We
    learned about the thousands of plants needed to do the annual
    borders, not to mention replacing perennials and shrubs, and
    sometimes trees, that even in a beneficial English climate,
    often fail and because Hever is a Public place, must be
    replaced immediately. </p>
    <p>At the end of the second week, we were full of gardens but
    it was the comfortable fullness that follows a gourmet meal
    not a quick feed at a fast food joint. So it was with delight
    we stopped at <b>Crittenedon House </b>and had a personal
    tour by Mr. A. B. Thompsett, a seasoned gardener who had
    developed his four acres to include a mature-and
    blooming-handkerchief tree that he had grown from seed,
    incredible rhododendrons from Himalayas, again grown from
    seed, and in the line of perennials, clumps of beautiful
    pendulous wood sedge (Carex pendulis) and primroses to make
    the mouth water for more. After we wandered about, Mr.
    Thompsett took personal questions from the group about
    managing your time and managing your garden without losing
    patience or becoming worn out before your time. </p>
    <p>So weeks later, we made a reluctant return to the States
    and our forgotten gardens. But it opened a new career for me
    and today when the first growth of spring is showing, I'm in
    the South office of Fugazy answering phone questions about
    the most beautiful gardens of Ireland or when the roses bloom
    in Scotland or is the Lake Country as striking as the books
    say it is. After years of belonging to the Men's Garden Club
    and being involved in both civic and private garden projects,
    I have no trouble painting a beautiful garden picture of the
    British Isles. We can even cope with rain, but that's another
    story&#133;. </p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>This formal garden is based on three city gardens I have
    seen in Asheville, plus part of our own. The Plesses' garden
    has boxwood hedges that are trimmed low and surround mowed
    grass. The corners are filled with perennials like peonies
    and poppies. The Coles' garden consists of a wide perennial
    border separated by a strip of mowed grass originating from
    their rear terraces. The border contains Russian Sage
    (Perovskia atriplicifolia) and a number of ornamental
    grasses, chiefly fountain grass (Pennisetum alopecuroides).
    Boxwood hedges are also featured at Peggy Pennell's garden.
    At one corner is a low brick panel about three feet wide and
    four feet tall. Set into a bank of ivy, it surrounds an
    architectural fragment of great beauty and is fronted by a
    small birdbath and an Italian putto of black iron. </p>
    <p>If you live in a cold part of the country, the ground
    cover at the garden's center could be Japanese pachysandra
    (Pachyssandra terminalis). A better choice, however, would be
    one of the more unusual ivy cultivars, such as Hedera helix
    'Baltica'. This plant bears small leaves with whitish veins
    and makes an excellent ground cover even in Zone 4. In Zones
    7 or 8, look for 'Brokamp', a German ivy with dark green,
    glossy leaves that turn a beautiful shade of bronze in winter
    (a color that is heightened by growing the plant in poor
    soil). 'Ivalace' is also a good choice. Its gray-green leaves
    have white margins and turn copper in the winter. </p>
    <p>The large evergreen shrub could be a rhododendron. Or for
    an especially elegant look, plant one of the more unusual
    Japanese maples instead of an evergreen. </p>
    <p>This garden is made for sculpture, including many of
    reproductions sold by museums. Our favorite is a fiberglass
    reproduction called &quot;Fat Persian Cat&quot; by an
    American sculptor Richard H. Recchia and sold by the Boston
    Museum. Be sure to leave a spot for a large concrete or
    terra-cotta trough filled with beautiful annuals. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I've been fascinated with wildlife gardening since
    childhood. Rather than family shopping trips or excursions to
    baseball games, my father would take my brother and I out to
    the woods in search of wildflowers while my mother led the
    search for fossils at Ten-Mile Creek. So today, most of my
    gardening adventures are connected one way or another with
    the wild garden. </p>
    <p>And if you like wildlife, there are even more reasons for
    establishing such a garden, not only on country homes or
    suburban lots, but even in the middle of a city. No matter
    where you live, animals, birds, and insects abound. Just come
    over to my place early in the morning. I live in the middle
    of the city yet the hoot owls sing at night, the crows talk
    all day, the raccoons tip the garbage cans, the chipmunks
    scamper about (if you watch closely, every chipmunk has both
    individual physical and behavioral traits), you will find out
    where the word squirrely comes from, and the butterflies
    visit the flowers each and every day. </p>
    <p>The first thing to do about planning a woodland garden is
    to make a <b><i>plan</i></b>. Nothing serious is needed. Just
    a plain piece of paper and a pen should go with you on a walk
    around your property. Make a note of permanent landscape
    features, the rising and setting of the sun, existing trees
    and shrubs, and a source of water. Remember, you do not need
    Sherwood Forest to have a woodland garden. Two or three trees
    along with a few bushes, and some under plantings of native
    wildflowers and ferns, will create a small woodland even on a
    small lot. </p>
    <p>If you live in a tract house where the developer has
    removed (yes, Virginia, there are still developers who cut
    everything down), immediately <b><i>plant some trees</i></b><b>.</b>
    And the same thing applies to settled land that has never
    been graced with trees. First get in touch with your local
    extension agent (every county usually has one), and have your
    soil tested. Then get a list of the trees that are most
    successful in your area. </p>
    <p>When starting without trees, choose a few fast-growers
    like birches. The river birch, <i>Betula nigra,</i> and the
    gray birch, <i>Betula populifolia,</i> can reach a height of
    twenty feet in five years and are both at home in the
    northeast. Staghorn sumac, <i>Rhus typhina,</i> is another
    short-lived tree that grows quickly or can be cut every year
    to create a shrubby effect, plus the autumn color of the
    sumac is a wonder to behold. </p>
    <p>Other trees that do well in a small garden are the
    dogwoods, not only for their spring flowers, but for the
    autumn fruit that squirrels and birds delight in harvesting.
    Just try for the Chinese dogwood, <i>Cornus kousa,</i> rather
    than the native species until somebody solves the problem of
    the dogwood blight. Junipers, <i>Juniperus spp</i>.,
    hemlocks, <i>Tsuga spp</i>., pines, <i>Pinus spp</i>., and
    other evergreens like rhododendrons, <i>Rhododendron spp.,</i>
    and hollies,<i> Ilex spp</i>., can be mixed, not only to
    provide winter color but give protection to wildlife the year
    round. And once again, birds nest in the branches, and most
    wildlife will turn to such protected spaces for their
    day-to-day activities. </p>
    <p>Among some great shrubs for the woodland garden are: the
    winterberry, <i>Ilex verticillata</i>, a member of the holly
    family that is very hardy and provides very popular berries
    in late fall and winter; Blueberries, <i>Vaccinium spp</i>.,
    a number of viburnums, <i>Viburnum spp;</i> and even
    hyrangeas, like the beautiful native, the oak-leafed
    hydrangea, <i>Hydrangea quercifolia</i>, that not only charms
    the wildlife garden but the proper garden as well. Even a
    cluster of raspberries and blackberries, <i>Rubus spp.,</i>
    provide both protection and food. Hawthorns, <i>Crataegus spp</i>.
    and crabapples, <i>Malus spp</i>., also do well, not only in
    the woods, but in a small garden, too. </p>
    <p>The choice of wildflowers is legion. In addition to the
    columbines, violets, asters, and the white snakeroot, <i>Eupatorium
    rugosum,</i> are for wooded areas with some shade. There are
    literally hundreds of others now available to American
    gardeners through various seed exchanges and smaller seed
    houses. And don't forget to include other flowering plants
    like the grasses and sedges. Both northern sea oats,<i>
    Chasmanthium latifolium</i>, and bottlebrush grass, <i>Hystrix
    patula,</i> do beautifully in a woodland setting. </p>
    <p>But of all the beautiful plants for the woodland, nothing
    beats the ferns. While not a popular wildlife food, they
    bring rustic beauty to any setting, will tolerate (sometimes
    revel in) acid soil, and delight in shady conditions. The
    shield ferns, <i>Dryopteris spp.,</i> Christmas fern, <i>Polystichum
    acrostichoides</i>, and the beautiful maiden hair fern, <i>Adiantum
    pedatum</i>, are among the top fern contenders. And if you
    have a spot where an aggressive ground cover is needed, try
    the hay-scented fern,<i> Dennstaedtia</i> <i>punctilobula</i>.
    Not only is this last fern beautiful to see, it will grow
    where many plants won't even try. </p>
    <p>While not a perfect choice for the front yard in an
    upscale subdivision, the meadow garden with its mix of
    flowering wildflowers and grasses is a great choice for the
    backyard, especially to attract many birds and butterflies. A
    number of native plants, especially the goldenrod, <i>Solidago
    spp.,</i> and the black-eyed Susans, <i>Rudbeckia hirta</i>,
    thrive in hot weather and need little, if any, moisture
    except for summer rains. </p>
    <p>Remember to leave a spot in the woodlands for a water
    feature. Whether limited to a concrete birdbath or just a
    rubber dishpan, wildlife needs water and will immediately
    delight in a fresh source of water. Just be sure to keep the
    containers clean and the water level up. </p>
    <h3>Gardening in the Fall</h3>
    <p>Even though days grow shorter and life in the garden
    begins to wind down in preparation for autumn, it's one of
    the best times in the year to work with plants (as long as
    the gardener lives south of the Canadian wilderness). The
    nights may be cooler and the ground might be downright chilly
    to the touch but as long as soil temperatures stay above
    40F, plants continue to grow. That means transplants
    quickly adjust to moving, and within a short time, rev-up to
    produce new rootlets until the ground really freezes up. Then
    in the spring, they've all settled in and never suffer any
    setbacks. </p>
    <p>Before I begin to work in any part of the wild garden or
    the perennial border, I haunt the nursery centers looking for
    odd bargains. Just last week I found some three-gallon
    specimens of a variegated hydrangea for $6.95 each and three
    of them planted with seven two-year-old great pendulous wood
    sedge, <i>Carex pendula</i>, have made a great looking
    addition to the back border. Sometimes even if sale plants
    look a bit bedraggled on top, usually the roots are in good
    condition, and when they are planted with care, the
    percentage of successes is in the high 90's. </p>
    <p>One more thing - Whenever I do any gardening, including
    woodlands, I always take along a few bags of composted
    leaves, new labels and pen, my trusty long-handled trowel,
    tie-backs, a sharp pruning shears or saw, and knee-pads. <b>It's
    a shame to get all the way to an imagined back-forty, and
    have to come back for one tool.</b> </p>

    <h2><font size="5"><strong>Fern Valley's Old Field Meadow</strong></font></h2>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The present Fern Valley meadow was started in the spring
    of 1984. For the three years prior to this the area was mowed
    as a low maintenance lawn. A four year period preceded this
    mowing when the area was allowed to grow as a meadow. The
    meadow covers almost 2 acres. </p>
    <p>The meadow soil has a shallow layer of topsoil over
    hardpan so the soil holds water in the winter and spring. The
    ground is often wet for a week after rain. In the summer from
    mid-June on, the soil is dry, very dry until the rains start
    at the end of summer. The terrain is flat to slightly sloping
    to the north and into the woodland. The meadow borders a
    mature woodland on the east side throughout its length. The
    soil is neutral to slightly acidic. </p>
    <p>For ten years the meadow was mowed once a year in winter.
    In 1994 mowing needed to be increased, in order to knock back
    the woody plant encroachment. One half of the meadow was cut
    in early summer. This second cut alternates on each half of
    the meadow every other year. </p>
    <p>The growing season starts after the winter mowing, when
    the cool season grasses kick in, such as <i>Anthoxanthum
    odoratum</i> and <i>Poa pratensis. </i>These grow to about 1
    to 1/2 feet. Early summer brings in <i>Arrhenantheum elatius,
    Festuca elatior, Holcus lanatus </i>and<i> Paspalum </i>spp.
    These grasses bring the height of the meadow up to 3 feet. In
    late summer and early fall <i>Andropogan virginicus, Triodia
    flava, </i>and <i>Eragrostis spectabilis </i>go to flower,
    and raise the general height of the meadow to 4 and 5 feet.
    There are expansive areas of wire grass that never get above
    a foot throughout the season. There are still many grasses
    present that have not been identified. There may be as many
    as 20-25 species of grasses in all. </p>
    <p>There are many approaches to developing a wildflower
    meadow, from clearing and freshly seeding the land to
    allowing an existing piece of ground to grow up wild. In Fern
    Valley, the area that is now the old-field meadow was allowed
    to grow up and we were able to see what happened. Since
    meadows are dynamic communities, constantly on the road to
    succession, we thought that a good meadow might develop if we
    let natural succession proceed. </p>
    <p>In its first season of no mowing the area burst into bloom
    with 90 species of flowering plants and grasses. Our reason
    for not tilling the whole area and starting with a
    &#147;clean&#148; seedbed was that we did not want to start
    over with bare soil problems and constant spraying with
    herbicides. We were past the successional stage where many
    weeds can grow and did not want to step backwards. Over the
    past years we have hundreds of new plants representing many
    species in the meadow. We have never and do not plan to
    purchase seed for scattering. All of our new plants are
    greenhouse grown from seed and planted out as soon as they
    are large enough to compete in the established grasses. Many
    of these additions are flourishing, such as <i>Helianthus
    tomentosus, Aster grandiflorus, </i>and <i>Baptisia
    australis, </i>while <i>Aster novae-angliae </i>and <i>Rudbeckia
    fulgida</i> have not established well in this mature meadow. </p>
    <p>Much of our seed for plant starts comes from seed
    exchanges with other arboreta or native plant societies. The
    meadow is not fertilized. The plants that flourish in this
    environment are not heavy feeders. Fertilizers would only
    encourage various weeds from surrounding areas. Watering is
    necessary in one low section where there are a few species
    that require soil moisture. Our rare birch <i>Betula uber </i>and
    wildflowers <i>Veronicastrum </i>and <i>Asclepias incarnata</i>
    enjoy the sunny meadow environment, but naturally occur in
    wet meadows. </p>
    <p>At this stage of development in the meadow, a good fire
    would take care of the encroaching woody sprawlers and
    invaders, that annual mowing alone does not control. Because
    we are in an urban area, fires are not recommended.
    Therefore, we will be using some brush controlling herbicides
    in the winter. </p>
    <p>Since the meadow is only a portion of an expansive native
    plant and daffodil-ivy collection, maintenance is an
    as-time-is-available basis. The essential tasks as they
    appear at this stage are: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mowing 1-2 times per year. </li>
        <li>Planting new wildflowers in March and early April to
            take advantage of the spring moisture. </li>
        <li>Mowing a wide path through the meadow every other
            week. </li>
        <li>Removing all common and giant ragweed as it appears. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The prominent flowering species in the meadow are: </p>
    <h3><b>Spring:</b> </h3>
    <p><i>Penstemon digitalis, Prunella vulgaris, Iris virginica,
    Sisyrinchium angustifolium </i></p>
    <h3><b>Summer:</b> </h3>
    <p><i>Asclepias tuberosa</i>, <i>Asclepias syriacus, Bidens
    polylepis, Cassia fasciculata, Eupatorium hyssopifolium,
    Eupatorium maculatum, Euphorbia corollata, Euthamia
    (Solidago) qraminifolia, Helianthus tomentosus, Pycanthemum
    tenuifolium, Solidago juncea, Vernonia noveboracensis,
    Veronicastrum virginicum</i> </p>
    <h3><b>Fall</b><b><i>:</i></b> </h3>
    <p><i>Aster pilosus, Aster grandiflorus, Aster puniceus,
    Solidago species</i> </p>
    <p>We like to think that the Fern Valley meadow is a natural
    system that stops succession in its tracks. It is an
    intricate area with native grasses interspersed with lovely
    native wildflowers, appearing as it may have centuries ago
    when the land was the territory of native American people or
    when the first European colonists arrived in North America,
    perhaps a few years after the last fire or after the eastern
    bison moved on to other grazing grounds. </p>

<h1><font color="#804000"><font size="6"><strong>COMPOSTING</strong></font></font></h1>

<blockquote>
    <h2><em><strong>A Fall Activity That Pays Big Dividends</strong></em></h2>
    <p>Soil condition is the single most important aspect of
    successful gardening. More landscapes and lawns fail to
    flourish because of poor soil than any other reason. The best
    way to improve soil is through the addition of organic
    matter. And there's no better type of organic matter than
    compost. In terms of soil improvement compost is better than
    top soil, even better than peat moss, and it's FREE! </p>
    <h3>What is Composting? </h3>
    <p>Composting can be defined as a method of decomposing
    garden waste under controlled conditions. Leaves, grass
    clippings and weeds are broken down by microorganisms into a
    dark, crumbly material called humus. The art of composting is
    setting up and maintaining the environmental conditions under
    which these microorganisms work best. </p>
    <h3>The Environment of the Compost Microorganisms </h3>
    <p>The microorganisms that turn yard waste into compost
    require the following as part of their environment: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A food source and a nitrogen source </li>
        <li>Air </li>
        <li>Water </li>
        <li>Warmth </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Greens and Browns </h3>
    <p>The food of the compost microorganisms is carbon and it's
    found in all of your organic yard and garden waste. Yard
    waste that's brown in color, old leaves for example, are high
    in carbon, but low in nitrogen. The microorganisms need
    nitrogen to reproduce. The ideal environment has about 30
    times more carbon than nitrogen; we say this is a 30 to 1 C:N
    ratio. </p>
    <p>While the brown colored yard waste is high in carbon the
    green colored waste, such as grass clippings, is high in
    nitrogen. When building a compost pile it's important to try
    to have a mixture of at least 1 part green material for every
    10 parts brown material. </p>
    <h3>Providing Air and Water </h3>
    <p>The compost microorganisms are living things and they need
    air and water to survive. The real trick to building a
    successful compost pile lies in allowing air to easily enter
    the pile. If a pile of yard and garden waste becomes matted
    down, this excludes air from the pile and the composting
    microorganisms die, then the pile begins to stink. A well
    built compost pile should be damp but not spongy in texture.
    This indicates there is plenty of air in the pile. </p>
    <p>On the other hand, if the compost pile gets plenty of air
    but too little water the microorganisms work slowly and the
    composting process dramatically slows down. </p>
    <h3>Getting Hot With Compost </h3>
    <p>When the compost pile is just what the composting
    microorganisms like, they work hard at decomposing the
    organic waste, they multiply, and they generate heat. A well
    made compost pile will get hot. Or at least it will try to
    get hot. Whether or not the temperature goes up will depend
    of the size of the pile. If the pile is below a critical size
    more heat will be lost from the pile to the air and the
    microorganisms will not be able to maintain an increase in
    compost temperature. However, if the compost pile is at last
    three feet square, that's a pile three feet wide, three feet
    deep and three feet high, there will be an increase in heat.
    It is not uncommon for well built compost piles to reach
    internal temperatures of 140 F. in a day or two. </p>
    <p>The rise in temperature causes the microorganisms to work
    even faster and the conversion of raw, yard and garden waste
    proceeds at breakneck speed. </p>
    <h3>Practical Composting for the Small Scale Yard </h3>
    <p>Of course I realize that not every yard is going to
    produce enough grass clippings and weeds to build a 3 x 3 x 3
    foot compost pile; that's a lot of material. When you are not
    generating large amounts of yard waste you can still compost
    but on a smaller scale. </p>
    <p>The practical method of small scale composting is to build
    a compost bin, I use three wooden pallets nailed together,
    and simply dump all organic yard waste into the bin. The slow
    accumulation of yard waste will never develop into a hot
    compost pile in which the yard waste decomposes in a few
    weeks. Instead, it will be a cold pile, and the composting
    process will take months to be completed. Nevertheless,
    you'll still be recycling your organic yard waste and you'll
    still end up with a superb soil amendment; it'll just take
    longer. </p>
    <h3>Managing the Cold Compost Pile </h3>
    <p>When practicing small scale, cold composting you have to
    guard against the pile getting too wet and compacted. Try to
    mix many different types of organic waste together in the
    pile. If grass clippings, leaves and weeds are mixed together
    there is little chance of everything packing down and
    becoming compacted. Don't fill the pile with 100 percent
    grass clippings, or 100 percent leaves. Such a homogeneous
    pile leads to compaction which leads to a lack of air in the
    pile which leads to a smelly pile. If you notice that your
    compost pile smells and seems compacted you'll have to pull
    it apart and rebuild it. This is the only way to get air into
    the pile and end the odor problem. </p>
    <h3>Fine Tuning the Compost Process </h3>
    <p>One of the best methods to improving your composting is to
    shred all organic waste before it goes into the pile. The
    finer the waste is chopped the more surface area on which the
    microorganisms can work and the faster the decomposition
    process. A modest sized, well constructed compost pile, made
    with shredded waste, will heat up quickly and turn out humus
    in just a few weeks. </p>
    <p>The second thing to keep an eye on to fine tune your
    composting is the carbon to nitrogen ratio. If you place
    materials in the pile that are mostly carbon, such as leaves,
    the decomposition process will be slow. If there is not a
    sufficient amount of green materials available (grass
    clippings, etc.) add a few handfuls of garden or lawn
    fertilizer to the leaves. This will add the extra nitrogen to
    really help the compost pile cook. </p>
    <p>Over the years I've built hundreds of compost piles and
    even now I have four in the yard. There is just no substitute
    for compost in the improvement of yard and garden soil. Start
    a compost pile today and turn your yard waste into black
    gold. </p>

    <p><font color="#000000">Native plants have recently become
    the answer for those gardeners who are tired of pampering
    fancy exotic imports with toxic chemicals. Because they grow
    here naturally, many natives are less labor intensive than
    their finicky cousins from across the sea. For those of you
    new to the gardening game, here's the news: The native plant
    &quot;movement&quot; is in full swing and many terrific
    natives are readily available at nurseries throughout the
    area.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">While it's true that many natives
    are less troublesome and needy than &quot;introduced
    exotics&quot;, you may be confused as to where to go in the
    Washington metropolitan area to view our local native plants
    in their natural environment or in plantings that enhance
    their attributes. With more and more of the area being built
    over in concrete, asphalt, and steel, it may seem like
    there's little natural habitat left, but despair not. The
    Washington metropolitan area is a horticultural wonderland.
    In fact, many terrific - albeit hidden - natural gardens,
    preserved woodlands, meadows, and wetlands exist around the
    beltway to spur you on in your quest for knowledge of plants
    and their habitats. Here then, are a few of the best:</font> </p>

    Washington D.C. (202) 245-2726 </h4>
    <p><font color="#000000">The National Arboretum is home to
    many wonderful trees and plants, and contains an extensive
    collection of trees, ferns, spring ephemerals, and
    wildflowers at &quot;Fern Valley&quot;, a naturalized stream
    garden. Plants are best viewed in the early spring when
    spring bulbs are blooming. This is an excellent place to view
    trees and plants that have achieved their mature size.</font>
    </p>
    <h4>National Zoo 3001 Connecticut Avenue, NW Washington, D.C.
    (202) 673-4717 </h4>
    <p><font color="#000000">The zoo has beefed up their flora
    and fauna exhibits to offer many naturalized plantings
    throughout the park. Specialized gardens include a Native
    American garden, African American Garden, organic vegetable
    plot, and butterfly gardens. Many native and exotic plants
    are displayed throughout the park in settings and
    combinations that are sure to provide inspiration for the
    home garden.</font> </p>
    <h4>Brookside Gardens Glenallan Avenue Wheaton, Maryland
    (301) 949-8230 </h4>

    home to an extensive public garden that includes many
    naturalized gardens and native plants. Self guided trails
    lead visitors through herb, butterfly, water-side, woodland,
    and collector gardens of ornamental grasses, daylilies,
    peonies, iris, daffodils, and other plants.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">These are just a few of many public
    gardens in the Washington metropolitan area. Aside from
    public display gardens, there are many other &quot;natural
    habitats&quot; where native plants can be viewed such as the
    bluebell walk at Bull Run Regional Park, and the nature
    trails in Rock Creek Park.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">When viewing native plants, it's
    best to acquire a good field guide that contains pictures so
    you can identify the flora you see as you explore the
    vegetation around you. The National Audubon Society's Field
    Guide to North American Wildflowers (Eastern Region) is an
    excellent resource guide for beginners.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Whether you decide to convert the
    entire yard over to a nature habitat garden or just enjoy
    native flora and fauna on weekend hikes, you will enjoy the
    endemic beauty of plants that were here before the first
    settlers set foot on our soil. Nature and native plants are
    all around you, and there really is no place like home for
    creating a less demanding, more fulfilling garden sanctuary!
    Happy gardening!</font> </p>

<title>Perennials: Site Preparation</title>

<body background="../graphics/backgrd5.gif">

<h1><font color="#008080"><font size="6"><strong>PERENNIALS</strong></font></font></h1>

<blockquote>
    <h2><font size="5"><em><strong>Site Preparation</strong></em></font>
    </h2>
    <p>Those of you who know me well, know that if I had to
    concentrate on just one area of horticulture, it would be
    that of herbaceous perennials. Among the many topics that
    could be considered in discussing herbaceous perennials are
    their characteristics, bed and border design, color in the
    bed or border, site preparation, seasonal care, and
    propagation. Here I will discuss site preparation. </p>
    <p>There will never be as good an opportunity to tailor the
    soil to herbaceous perennials needs as the first time it is
    prepared. Try to start the preparation of the soil long
    before planting the bed or border. Start in spring for a fall
    planting and in fall for a spring planting. This will allow
    plenty of time for any organic soil amendments and/or pH
    modifications to take effect. To prepare the site for
    planting herbaceous perennials: </p>
    <h4>Clear all large debris from site.</h4>
    <p>Kill and/or remove all existing vegetation from the site
    for composting or disposal. Roundup, being non-selective and
    environmentally bio-rational, is an excellent herbicide to
    use to kill the vegetation. It might be necessary to retreat
    the site to kill persistent perennials weeds. </p>
    <p>Dig an 18-to-24 inch-deep hole in the proposed site to
    study the soil profile and do a percolation test. Examine the
    depth of the topsoil and the character of the subsoil. Fill
    the hole with water. If the water takes more than 24 hrs. to
    drain out of the hole, the bed may have to be tiled to
    facilitate drainage. </p>
    <p>Plant a green manure crop if it is possible to start soil
    preparation early. Sow winter rye if starting soil
    preparation in the fall for a spring planting. The
    densely-spaced stalks will choke out weeds, and tilling the
    winter rye into the soil in spring will add humus to the
    soil. Sow buckwheat, oats, or millet in spring and till them
    under in fall for a fall-planted herbaceous perennial border.
    </p>
    <p>Spread 2 to 3 inches of organic matter over the surface of
    the soil prior to beginning to work it. This is equivalent to
    3 to 4 yd.3/1000 ft. Spread and incorporate 1/2 to 1 yd.3 of
    organic matter/1000 ft2 in subsequent years. Compost ground
    corn cob, rotted hay, well-rotted sawdust, or sphagnum peat
    moss are just a few good forms of organic matter. Rototill or
    spade the organic matter into the soil to a depth of 8 to 10,
    if not even, 12 inches. Add no more organic matter than 1/3
    of the final amended soil volume. </p>
    <p>Consider using commercial composts. Commercial composts
    are an especially desirable form of organic matter to work
    into the soil while preparing it for herbaceous perennials as
    they are manufactured from materials that would otherwise end
    up in landfills or other waste disposal systems. Commercial
    composts may be composted sewage sludge (CSS), composted
    municipal yard waste (CMYW) such as leaves and grass
    clippings, composted garbage (CG) or composted paper mill
    sludge (CPMS). Again, incorporate 3 to 4 yd.3 of commercial
    compost/1000 ft of bed or border space. </p>
    <p>Use care in amending soils with commercial composts. Most
    commercial composts, especially lime-dewatered CSS, have pH's
    above 7.0. This admonition is especially important when
    amending a soil in which ericaceous plants, such as azalea,
    leucothoe, pieris, and rhododendron that require pH's of 4.5
    to 6.0, are to be grown. </p>
    <p>Lime-dewatered CSS (such as Compro) has a pH as high as
    8.2 by itself and a Compro-amended soil may have a pH as high
    as 9.4. Polymer-dewatered CSS (such as Earthlife) has a pH of
    6.2 to 7.2, CMYW (such as Leafgro) a pH of 7 to 7.2, and CPMS
    (such as Glatcolite) a pH of 6.8 to 7.2. </p>
    <p>Add 3 to 4 lb. of ferrous sulfate, FeSO4/1000 ft of bed or
    border space for each 0.5 pH point by which the amended soil
    needs to be dropped, down to a pH level of 6.0 regardless of
    the type of commercial compost used. It is necessary to use
    FeSO4 to lower the pH of amended soils to a pH of 6.0,
    because the micro-organisms that attack elemental sulfur, S,
    to convert it to the SO4 = ion, are not active above pH's of
    6.0. When FeSO4 is added to the amended soil it immediately
    goes into solution, freeing the SO4 = ion to join with the H+
    ions of water, forming sulfuric acid, H2SO4 with a resultant
    rapid reduction of soil pH. Once the soil pH has been lowered
    to a pH of 6.0, it is possible to add elemental sulfur, as
    the micro-organisms that convert elemental sulfur to SO4 =
    ion are active. Compro would seem to be the commercial
    compost of choice to add to soils that are extremely acid and
    are not to be planted with ericaceous plants, but it would be
    better to add another commercial compost to those soils in
    which ericaceous plants are to be grown to reduce the amount
    FeSO4 that would need to be added to drop the pH to a
    desirable level. </p>
    <p>Incorporate the organic matter, whatever form to a depth
    of 8 to 10, if not even, 12 inches deep. Do not work the soil
    when it is wet. Try not to step on the bed once it is tilled.
    </p>
    <p>Consider double digging the herbaceous perennial bed or
    border. Double digging is difficult and time consuming, but
    well worth the effort. </p>
    <p>Test the soil for soil type, pH, and nutritional status.
    This is done after incorporating the organic matter, because
    adding organic matter changes the soil type and the soil type
    dictates the amount of pH modifying agents that need to be
    added to effect the desired change. </p>
    <p>Add and incorporate pH modifying agents and nutrients as
    dictated by the soil test. While it is not recommended to add
    pH modifying agents and/or nutrients without testing the
    soil, it is generally safe to add 5 lb. of ground limestone
    and 5 lb. of 5-10-5 or 5-10-10 fertilizer/100 ft2 of bed or
    border space. </p>
    <p>If it is desired to garden organically, incorporate an
    organic fertilizer such as cottonseed meal, blood meal, or
    tankage to supply nitrogen and other elements. In lieu of
    chemical fertilizers use bone meal and rock phosphate for
    phosphorus, and greensand, wood ashes, and granite dust for
    potassium. Seaweed and fish oil provide trace elements in
    addition to nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium. </p>
    <p>Sterilize the soil if possible with a material (such as
    vapam) to reduce insects, soil borne diseases, and weeds. </p>
    <p>Spread an organic mulch over the prepared bed or border.
    It is easier and tidier to spread the mulch before planting.
    Good mulches include compost, grass clippings, cocoa bean
    hulls, or bark chips. Mulches moderate soil temperatures,
    reduce soil water loss, help control weeds, reduce heaving of
    plants in spring, may keep plants from resuming growth too
    early in spring, will prolong root growth in fall, are
    attractive, prevent mud-splashing of the foliage and flowers,
    and add nutrients as they decompose. </p>
    <p>Edge the bed or border in some fashion. This may be as
    simple as edging the sod with a sharp tool; implanting an
    edge of pressure treated wood, plastic steel, hard rubber, or
    aluminum; or partially burying bricks, stone slabs, or slate.
    An edging will be attractive and will help reduce the
    encroachment of the lawn. </p>

    <h2><font size="5"><strong>Wrap It Up</strong></font><br>
    <font size="4"><em><strong><i>by Sylvia Ehrhardt</i></strong></em><em><strong>
    </strong></em></font></h2>
    <p>The weeks between the end of the harvest season and the
    first hard freeze are the time of the year I use to get my
    land ready for winter and begin preparing for next year. If
    gardeners do not take advantage of this time, they will miss
    the best chance not only to get a jump on the coming growing
    season but also to take care of last season's problems -
    insect pests, diseases, soil deficiencies, etc. that may have
    plagued them this past year. Take a few hours to wrap up the
    season right. Here are some fall chores that you can do: </p>
    <p>Before you start clearing all the litter from the garden,
    note where all the crops were grown: </p>
    <p>Draw a sketch of the garden layout and record the location
    of each crop. Come spring, you'll want to be sure to avoid
    putting the same vegetables in the same place. This is
    important because different crops affect the soil in
    different ways. Some are heavy feeders - like corn and
    tomatoes - and use up a lot of nitrogen and phosphorus.
    Others - beans and peas - add nitrogen to the soil. </p>
    <p>To help balance soil nutrients from harvest to harvest
    grow a light feeding root crop (carrots, beets, etc.) or a
    nitrogen fixing legume (beans and peas) where you raised a
    heavy feeder the year before. Also try to follow a legume
    with a nitrogen hungry crop (corn, tomatoes). </p>
    <p>Moving your vegetables around from season to season helps
    keep crop-specific insects and diseases from setting up
    permanent quarters. </p>
    <h4>Clean up the garden:</h4>
    <p>The need to clear your garden of crop debris is more than
    cosmetic. All sorts of insects and diseases favor dead
    vegetation as winter quarters. </p>
    <p>Pull up diseased plants and burn them or put them in
    sealed containers for disposal with household trash. If you
    put them in the compost pile now it may not heat up enough to
    kill the disease pathogens. </p>
    <p>Pick up and destroy dropped fruit. This is especially
    important in reducing infestations of apple maggots, fruit
    flies, codling moths, and plum curculios. </p>
    <p>Shred healthy vines, stalks or frost-nipped plants and put
    them in the compost pile. </p>
    <p>Take a few minutes to scoop up some soil samples and have
    your soil analyzed: </p>
    <p>Fall is the best time for this because the soil yields a
    more accurate nutrient reading. It will tell you what is left
    in the soil after harvesting the season's crops. If a
    nutrient needs to be added, this is a good time to do it. A
    slow acting amendment, such as rock phosphate, takes time to
    break down. By spring the mineral will be available for the
    plants. </p>
    <h4>Till and enrich the old garden:</h4>
    <p>Fall is better than spring for soil preparation. Remember
    to put something back for everything you take out of the
    soil. This is the best time to add compost, manure and rock
    powders to the garden. </p>
    <p>If you can, till the soil six to eight inches deep. That
    will bring up insects and pupae that would normally spend the
    winter underground. Feasting birds and a couple of good cold
    nights will take care of most of them. At the same time,
    you'll bury alive those pests that usually dwell on the
    surface. </p>
    <h4>Plant a soil-improving cover crop after you have
    cultivated the soil:</h4>
    <p>I like a combination of Hairy Vetch and Winter Rye because
    they add a lot of nutrients and organic matter to the soil. </p>
    <p>Another soil improving cover crop to plant in fall is
    Ryegrass or Oats. During the cold weather they will die, and
    in spring you can rake off or till the dead plants under. </p>
    <h4>Blanket the garden with organic mulch if you don't have
    time to sow a cover crop:</h4>
    <p>Shredded leaves or spoiled hay (as mulch) protects the
    soil from erosion, keeps weeds from growing, and enriches the
    soil with nutrients released as the material decomposes. </p>
    <p>Mulch also encourages earthworms, prevents heaving of the
    soil, and allows an early start next spring. In the spring,
    you will need to pull the mulch back a week or so before
    planting to allow the soil to warm, or the mulch can be
    tilled into the soil. </p>
    <h4>Clear a new growing area:</h4>
    <p>Fall is the perfect time to expand your garden. To rid the
    new area of weeds or turf, spread a thick layer of paper -
    newsprint without color or cardboard- over the area you want
    to clear. Pile weeds, shredded leaves, grass clippings,
    straw, or compost on top. Come spring, the weeds beneath will
    have suffocated, and the paper material will be soft, nearly
    rotted, and easy to till. An added benefit is that the
    newspaper will attract earthworms. </p>
    <h4>Protect vegetables left for winter harvest:</h4>
    <p>Cover any vegetables left in the garden for harvest during
    the winter months with floating row covers, cloches, or
    straw. </p>
    <h4>Start fall compost: </h4>
    <p>Make more compost if the weather is warm enough, or get
    ready to start a new compost heap in early spring by piling
    up the materials in a dry place. </p>
    <p>Another way to compost is by sheet composting. Simply mix
    residues - garden, manure, leaves - into the soil with a
    tiller. This can be done quite late in the fall, as long as
    the soil can be worked. Leaves dumped right onto the sections
    of the garden (up to 6 inches deep) and sprinkled with ground
    limestone can be tilled under. The tilling initiates the
    breakdown process and a further tilling in spring completes
    it. </p>
    <h4>Spend time cleaning and winterizing hand tools and power
    equipment: </h4>
    <p>Wash, scrub, scrape and hose off the caked-on dirt that
    clings to your tools. Use a paint scraper or putty knife to
    remove the layer of matted vegetation that accumulates under
    mower decks and in the nooks and crannies of shredders and
    tillers. </p>
    <p>Sharpen your hand tools and give them a light coating of
    vegetable oil or paste wax to prevent rusting. Repair any
    broken handles and find a permanent place for them to rest.
    Rub linseed oil into wooden handles, taking special care to
    get plenty of oil into the areas where wood and metal meet. </p>
    <p>To make sure mowers, tillers and other equipment powered
    by small engines will start next year, add commercial gas
    stabilizer to the fuel in each tank and run the engine for a
    minute or two to make sure the stabilized fuel is in the
    system. Another method for over wintering small engines is to
    simply drain the gas from the tank and run the engine until
    all the fuel in the line and carburetor is gone. </p>
    <h4>Remove and store poles, support fences, trellises and
    portable frames:</h4>
    <p>Clean off all the dirt and repair them, if needed. When
    the spring rush comes, you will find it difficult to do these
    repairs. </p>
    <h4>Disinfect tools:</h4>
    <p>Prevent the spread of plant diseases. Pruning shears and
    loppers can be disinfected by soaking the cutters for a full
    minute in a solution of chlorine bleach and water (one part
    bleach to nine parts water). Then carefully wipe the metal
    dry and oil it to prevent corrosion. </p>
    <h4>Prepare equipment for winter:</h4>
    <p>Disconnect, drain and store all hoses, sprayers and
    sprinklers before winter sneaks up and freezes them. </p>
    <h4>Prepare for new seedlings:</h4>
    <p>Have soil, compost, and flats stored in a cool dry place
    for starting seedlings later in winter. Flats and containers,
    if recycled, should be washed with bleach solution to kill
    any diseases. </p>
    <p>When everything is finished, planning the next year's
    growing season begins. Looking ahead will help you see the
    value in the fall cleanup. </p>

    <h2><font size="5">My Russian Adventures<br>
    </font><font size="4"><em><strong><i>by Sylvia Ehrhardt</i></strong></em><em><strong>
    </strong></em></font></h2>
    <p>The life of an organic farmer may be hard at times, but it
    certainly is not dull. Since 1991, my husband and I have
    traveled in Russia on four occasions, meeting farmers and
    gardeners. In the process, we've had great adventures, met
    lots of really wonderful people and made dear friends. We
    volunteer our time for The Center for Citizen Initiatives
    (CCI), an exceptionally effective non-governmental
    organization in San Francisco. </p>
    <p>CCI has sent hundreds of tons of donated seeds to some 3
    million farmers and gardeners, and recruits volunteers to
    advise and assist them to raise food. Gardening in Russia is
    not just a hobby, it's a necessity. Food production has
    fallen 40 % since the old Soviet days, and with the new free
    market system it is also very costly. Fortunately, about 50%
    of Russians have access to garden plots, called dachas. Every
    inch of soil is cultivated, and the harvest is preserved for
    the long, cold winter. Dachas produce 30% of all food grown
    in this vast country. </p>
    <p>We have traveled from St. Petersburg and Moscow in the
    north, to the Caspian Sea in the south, giving lectures and
    workshops. Wherever we went, we found a surprising interest
    in organic and sustainable agriculture. Since the breakup of
    the Soviet Union chemical fertilizers and pesticides are very
    scarce and expensive. Many of the huge state farms have gone
    bankrupt and parcels of their land are being distributed to
    private farmers, who are former employees of the state farms
    and discharged servicemen with little agriculture experience.
    Farmers and gardeners are left with no fertilizers,
    pesticides or knowledge of how to grow without them.
    Knowledge of alternative approaches to agriculture does not
    exist, because in the former Soviet Union anyone who tried
    anything but the official approach could be imprisoned! Most
    farmers we met had not used chemicals for three years, and
    their crop yields are progressively lower each year. </p>
    <p><img src="../graphics/russia.gif" width="150" height="236"><br>
    While we were in Moscow in 1993, we made a major
    breakthrough. In Russia, no one works on the weekend, so it
    seems, for everyone is out at the dacha. So, we went
    sightseeing in nearby Sergiev Posad, one of the few remaining
    ancient cities. Here is the residence of the Patriarch of the
    Russian Orthodox church, a monastery, beautiful churches and
    museums. It also is the seat of the regional government, and
    we were invited to meet with the administrator in charge of
    agriculture, a request we couldn't refuse. He described the
    problems of declining production and the lack of supplies and
    equipment. We told him of our experience in teaching
    sustainable methods, which doesn't rely on chemical
    pesticides and fertilizer. He requested our assistance for
    the newly privatized farmers and pledged his support. CCI
    subsequently agreed to take this on as a major project. </p>
    <p>The administrator told us about the disaster of the 1993
    potato crop. It had been a good harvest, and the private
    farmers expected to sell their entire crop to the Federation
    government in Moscow, as was customary. However, with the
    economic reforms, the official said, the government had
    already purchased its potatoes from Poland. With no other
    market, and no transportation, hundreds of thousands of tons
    of potatoes rotted in the fields. </p>
    <p>The Sergiev Posad project has blossomed into a
    comprehensive program. In the winter of 1993-94, CCI sent 5
    University Ag instructors to lecture on sustainable
    agriculture to the faculty at the All Russian Ag College in
    Sergiev Posad. Their lecture notes and materials were
    translated by the College and distributed to 300 ag schools
    throughout the country. They also assisted in developing a
    four-year curriculum in sustainable agriculture which is now
    in place in all ag colleges. </p>
    <p>With CCI's help, the local farmers created the Farming
    Development Service (FDS). They wanted this because the
    farmers needed help with their problems and with information
    on low-cost, sustainable agriculture techniques. There was no
    support from government or the agriculture college for this,
    so a membership organization by and for the farmers began.
    Thus began the first ag extension service in Russia. </p>
    <p>In September, 1994 we were asked to return and help the
    regional farmers develop markets for their chemically free
    crops. Since they were in limbo between the old centralized
    system and the free market system, they had no experience in
    marketing their produce. We found out when we got there that
    the farmers hoped to sell their crops through a county fair,
    which had been suggested to them by one of the American
    instructors. They wanted us to help them to organize the
    fair, which was scheduled less than one month away, in
    October! </p>
    <p>Neither my husband nor I had ever put together a country
    fair before (especially in one month), but they were
    desperate for help. First we publicized the fair through the
    Russian and foreign press in Moscow, sent invitations by fax
    to food distributors, processors, wholesalers, and foreign
    embassies in Moscow that there would be pesticide-free food
    to buy in Sergiev Posad. We helped FDS to develop displays
    and written materials to be handed out to fairgoers. </p>
    <p>We returned home just before the event. After it was over
    we received a fax telling us that the farmers who exhibited
    at the fair sold all their 1994 harvest and received
    contracts for their 1995 crops. Everyone declared the
    exhibition a huge success and now plan to make it an annual
    affair. Word of this event has led to requests to form FDS
    organizations in many other communities. </p>
    <p>In 1995 CCI brought six members of the Sergiev Posad
    agricultural community plus an official of the Russian
    Ministry of Agriculture to participate in a month long
    training program in sustainable agriculture and extension
    service here in the US. Universities and extension services
    from four states hosted the CCI delegation to study farming
    techniques, sustainable agriculture, and extension service. </p>
    <p>We hosted the delegation at our farm for eight days, and
    arranged meetings for them with officials in Washington who
    are involved with agriculture. It was important for the
    Americans to hear the Russians taking hold of our agriculture
    ideas and fitting them to the Russian experience. </p>
    <p>In May 1995 we returned to Moscow, where we discovered
    another opportunity to help. We met with the director of an
    ag research institute which is receiving financial support
    from the World Bank and the Russian government to develop the
    Farmer Information and Advisory Service (FIAS) which will be
    located in all of the agriculturally important regions in
    Russia. FIAS has Russian agriculture specialists, offices,
    computer banks and telephones ready to help the farmers, but
    they lack outreach know-how since there is no tradition of
    extension services, thus posing a serious problem. We told
    the Director of CCI's work in Sergiev Posad and offered to
    assist FIAS with the wealth of information available in US
    universities and libraries. In June the Director officially
    requested assistance from CCI in: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>arranging visits of US extension specialists to train
            employees of FIAS to work in each of 37 agriculture
            regions as extension agents </li>
        <li>organizing visits of US specialists in sustainable
            agriculture to consult on adapting sustainable
            agriculture to Russian conditions </li>
        <li>assisting with the training of FIAS employees, both
            through seminars in Russia and internships in
            America. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>CCI has started this assistance in November by supporting
    an International Conference on Sustainable Agriculture in
    Sergiev Posad at the All-Russian Agriculture College.
    Organizations from Europe, US, and representatives from 300
    Russian ag colleges and 37 FIAS agriculture regions attended.
    Also the first Sustainable Agriculture Specialist has been
    sent to advise and train the Federal Center in Moscow as well
    as participate in the conference at Sergiev Posad. </p>
    <p>My husband and I are now Agriculture Advisors to CCI for
    the Sustainable Agriculture Initiatives in Russia. We believe
    that support for private farmers and agriculture businesses
    in Russia will save the private farming movement there. We
    hope this will create hundreds of change agents which will
    support private enterprise and democracy in Russia. We feel
    very fortunate to be part of this. Pretty exciting stuff for
    a couple of organic farmers from the Blue Ridge mountains of
    Maryland. </p>

    <h2><font size="5"><strong>Healthy Garden</strong></font><br>
    <font size="4"><em><strong><i>by Sylvia Ehrhardt</i></strong></em></font></h2>
    <p>Before turning your soil in the garden this year, take
    some time to think about what it takes to create a <i>healthy
    </i>garden. When I speak of a healthy garden I mean building
    good soil and nourishing crops to prevent most garden
    problems from ever occurring. I always heard &quot;healthy
    soil produces healthy plants&quot;, and I have found this to
    be true. With a little forethought, your garden can have
    productive soil and healthy plants as well. As Thomas
    Jefferson wrote, </p>
    <p>&quot;I suspect that the insects which have harassed you
    have been encouraged by the feebleness of your plants; and
    that has been produced by the lean state of your <b>soil</b>.&quot;
    </p>
    <h4><font face="Arial"><strong>Productive Soil </strong></font></h4>
    <p>Productive soil is loose, friable, evenly textured, and
    full of soil life. Here is how you can get your soil to be
    that way: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use compost, cover crops (green manure), crop
            residues, and animal manure to build humus<i>.</i>
            Humus improves the texture of the soil, makes
            nutrients available to plants, increases disease
            resistance and protects against drought and erosion. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b><i>Compost</i></b> is excellent for building humus in
    the soil. <b><i>Cover crops</i></b> and <b><i>green manure</i></b>
    raise organic matter content of the soil when incorporating
    crops such as rye, hairy vetch or buckwheat. <b><i>Crop
    residues</i></b><i> </i>are excellent long lasting sources of
    organic matter. <i>Well aged </i><b><i>animal manure</i></b>
    is effective for building humus. Fresh manure should be
    composted so that it will not burn the plants. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Air and water are essential elements of the soil for
            good plant growth. Soil with a high humus content has
            a structure that is better for movement of water and
            air through the soil particles. </li>
        <li>Soil texture can be affected by the way the ground is
            tilled or dug. Tillage practices should be designed
            to avoid compaction. I loosen my soil to a good depth
            and create an even texture in at least the top 8
            inches. Loose soil has several important functions: </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b><i>Aeration-</i></b>Roots need oxygen in order to grow.
    <b><i>Drainage-</i></b>Most garden plants don't like soggy
    soil. The deeper the soil is dug, the better the drainage. <b><i>Easy
    root movement-</i></b>With compact soil, roots must slowly
    pry their way down. In loose soil, the roots can move freely
    to get the water and nutrients they need. <b><i>Good seedbed-</i></b>With
    fine textured soil, seeds come in close contact with the soil
    and assure good germination. Remember not to work the soil
    when it is too moist as the soil can be damaged. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Soil Life is the community of living organisms in the
            soil. These microorganisms and worms digest organic
            matter and change it into humus, a form that plants
            are able to use. They also transform inert minerals
            into healthy living soil. I have found that building
            the life and organic matter in my soil is an ongoing,
            never ending garden activity. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4><font face="Arial"><strong>Healthy Plants </strong></font></h4>
    <p>Healthy plants have plenty of nourishment, are vigorous
    and have fewer disease, growth and pest problems. Here is how
    you can have healthy plants: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Try to keep your plants from becoming stressed.
            Plants subjected to conditions of cold and windy
            weather, lack of water, poor nutrients, and too much
            heat are prime candidates for insect damage. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b><i>Cold and windy weather</i></b><i> </i>can be
    controlled by cold frames, plastic covering, floating row
    covers, or windbreaks. <b><i>Water</i></b><b> </b>should be
    monitored (1 inch per week by rain or irrigation) so that
    plants are not stressed. <b><i>Compost</i></b><i> </i>enables
    plants to have a rich diet. <b><i>Mulch</i></b><i>,</i>
    covering the soil with a layer of organic material, reduces
    plant stress caused by water and weather extremes. Mulch
    helps moderate soil temperature, keeps the ground from
    drying, acts as a pest deterrent, and adds organic matter to
    the soil. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Buy resistant varieties of seeds. Certain plant
            varieties are less vulnerable to insect damage and
            diseases than others. Here are some examples: </li>

        <li>Rotate your crops to improve the health of your
            plants. Crop rotation is the practice of moving the
            locations of crops within the garden each season so
            that the same crop does not grow in the same place
            twice in succession. This rotation helps soil
            fertility and reduces problems with soilborne
            diseases and some soil dwelling insects. A three year
            crop rotation works well. It would have a <i>Nitrogen
            Fixer </i>the first year<i>, Heavy Feeder </i>the
            second, and<i> Light Feeder</i> the third. The fourth
            year would start with <i>Nitrogen Fixer</i> again.
            Here is an example for one bed or row: </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Year One - a <b><i>Nitrogen Fixer</i></b> (peas or beans)
    would follow a <i>Light Feeder </i>(potatoes or turnips). </p>
    <p>Year Two - a <b><i>Heavy Feeder</i></b><i> </i>(corn or
    tomatoes) would follow the <i>Nitrogen Fixer</i> </p>
    <p>Year Three - a <b><i>Light Feeder</i></b> (carrots, or
    peppers) would follow the <i>Heavy Feeder</i>. </p>

    <h2><font size="5"><strong>Teas for the Garden</strong></font><br>
    <font size="4"><em><strong><i>by Sylvia Ehrhardt</i></strong></em><em><strong>
    </strong></em></font></h2>
    <p><font color="#000000">I have long used an easy way to give
    my garden plants an extra boost, with my homemade fertilizer
    teas. They supply needed nutrients to my plants during the
    growing season. A tea is especially valuable for feeding
    hungry or stressed plants or when correcting soil
    deficiencies. The advantage of a tea is that the nutrients
    are<b> immediately </b>available to the plants. Some teas
    also help protect against blight, mildew, fungus and rust.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">These nutrient filled solutions -
    aged compost, manure, fish or plant matter mixed in water -
    supply enzymes, hormones, micro-nutrients and minerals to
    crops. Once made, they are poured on the soil, next to the
    seedling or plant. They can also be used as a spray on the
    plant leaves. This is known as <b>foliar feeding</b>. </font></p>
    <h3>Teas and how to make them</h3>
    <p><font color="#000000">Here are some ingredients for making
    teas: compost, fresh or old manure, fish, seaweed, comfrey,
    stinging nettle, chamomile and horsetail.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><b>Compost</b> - Compost tea is
    nutrient enriched water. It is used on plants during
    transplanting, flowering and fruiting and works to improve
    the overall health of the plant. Compost tea can be used
    immediately or stored and used at a later date. Spraying the
    tea on plants is an excellent way to prevent plant diseases,
    such as blight or mildew. It has a direct effect on
    disease-causing organisms. This tea is especially good for
    cucumbers and tomatoes. A weekly spray on foliage enhances
    plant vigor and protects the plant from blight. European
    studies have shown that a tea made from well-decomposed
    compost is a very effective treatment for strengthening the
    plant's resistance to fungal diseases.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><b>Manure</b> - Raw or aged manure
    can be used; however, the tea needs to stand for two weeks
    and be stirred every day before it is used. Caution: don't
    use dog or cat wastes. The use of liquid poultry and animal
    manure tea has many benefits; it helps foliage and stem
    growth as well as promotes root development.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Compost and manure teas are easy to
    brew. They are made by filling a container 1/4 full with
    compost or manure and the rest with water. I steep the
    ingredients in a large trash can or a 55 gallon drum. It also
    works in smaller containers. The brew is covered and stirred
    once a day to introduce oxygen, then the solids are strained
    and the liquid is used on the plants. If the steeping
    material is in a cloth sack, the brew doesn't have to be
    strained. When finished, the sack is emptied onto the compost
    pile.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000">The tea steeps until the water turns
    a rich, brown color. If the brew is dark brown or black, I
    dilute it with clear water. The tea can be used full strength
    on plants in the garden, as it will not burn. For greenhouse
    seedlings, dilute it to the color of weak tea. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><b>Fish</b> - Fish emulsion is
    concentrated fish protein. When mixed with water it supplies
    plants with nitrogen. I use it:-<b><i> </i></b><i>on
    seedlings</i><b><i>,</i></b> to produce good color and rapid
    growth; - <i>before bloom</i>, to increase flower size and
    fruit set; and -<i> when fruit is forming</i> to speed
    development. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><b>Seaweed </b>- Seaweed is sold in
    liquid or dry concentrated form and must be diluted with
    water. I use seaweed to help my plants throughout the season.
    It contains<i> over 50 micro nutrients </i>(trace elements)
    that plants need, as well as growth hormones. These hormones
    increase the efficiency of photosynthesis to stimulate
    growth. There are critical times when seaweed is most
    beneficial for the garden - protecting the plant from the
    stress of frost and heat. I spray seaweed on my plants once a
    week when my strawberries start to grow their leaves in early
    spring. This protects my plants from the late frost that
    damages the strawberry flowers. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><b>Comfrey </b>- The herb comfrey is
    used as a general tonic. <i>Rich in potash, calcium,
    phosphorus, magnesium and many vitamins</i>, this herb gives<i>
    tomatoes</i> a special lift. To make comfrey tea, fill the
    container half to three-quarters full with leaves, add water
    the rest of the way and let it ferment for 3 to 4 weeks. Stir
    the brew every day. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><b>Stinging Nettle</b> - The weed
    stinging nettle strengthens plants and helps resist rot.<i>
    Rich in iron</i>, this weed increases the oil in herbs.
    Nettle tea also activates microbial life in the soil. Be
    careful when gathering this weed. The tiny hairs on leaves
    and stems can inflict pain which lasts for days! Use clippers
    and wear gloves to be safe.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><b>Chamomile</b> - The herb
    chamomile, when used as a garden tea, <i>discourages
    damping-off disease.</i> Use the tea on seedlings or in the
    greenhouse. It is especially good where there is moist,
    humid, enclosed conditions. Chamomile has <i>calcium, sulfur
    and potash</i> in its brew. Steep the fresh or dry flowers in
    hot boiling water until the mixture cools, then strain and
    apply.</font> </p>
    <p><font color="#000000"><b>Horsetail</b> - Horsetail is a
    perennial flowerless plant related to the fern. When made
    into a tea it is said to protect plants from mildew, fungus
    and rust. Bio-dynamic growers believe the<i> silicon rich </i>plant
    resists these diseases by enhancing its light absorbing
    ability<i>. </i>To make horsetail tea, boil the plant (fresh
    or dry) with some water for 20 minutes. After it is cool,
    strain, and dilute to a weak solution and spray onto the
    leaves.</font> </p>
    <h4>Foliar sprays. </h4>
    <p><font color="#000000">Liquid fertilizers - compost,
    manure, fish, and seaweed teas - are especially effective
    when applied to plant leaves because they are quickly
    absorbed. Studies show that<i> foliar feeding is a quick way
    to correct mineral deficiencies</i>. Leaves are more
    selective than roots and will absorb only the minerals
    needed, thus preventing any imbalance from developing. It is
    best to feed your plants in the early morning, in the
    evening, or on an overcast day. Make sure all leaf surfaces
    are covered when sprayed. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Liquid feeding is used to supply
    short term nutritional needs to hungry or stressed plants and
    to correct deficiencies. Teas are especially valuable for the
    plants, but should not be considered as an alternative to
    building a rich healthy soil. </font></p>

    <p>Anyone who has enjoyed the taste of vine-ripe tomatoes or
    fresh juicy blackberries knows that nothing matches the
    flavor and aroma of just-picked, fully ripe fruits and
    vegetables. Unfortunately it is just about impossible to buy
    such fresh produce in any store. Most people know they could
    grow their own, but just don't have the time or inclination
    to do so. </p>
    <p>The availability of just-picked, fully ripe fruits and
    vegetables may change if the innovative marketing concept
    called Community Supported Agriculture takes hold. <b>Community
    Supported Agriculture</b> (CSA) links consumers with growers,
    thus connecting the consumers to the source of their food. </p>
    <p>While there are many variations of CSAs, the general
    concept is that the grower contracts with a group (community)
    of consumers to provide them with an agreed quantity and
    variety of freshly picked produce for the entire season. The
    consumers agree to pay in advance for the season's output.
    Each week, over the season, they receive a share of whatever
    is ready for harvest. This arrangement benefits both grower
    and consumer. </p>
    <p>Supporters of CSA hail this concept as a way to revitalize
    the vanishing family farm, to promote local agriculture, and
    to help consumers receive fresh nutritious food in the
    increasingly impersonal and detached world of agribusiness
    and supermarkets. </p>
    <h3><b>How did it start?</b> </h3>
    <p>Although fairly new in the United States, CSA began in
    Japan over 30 years ago. In 1965, a group of women approached
    a farmer with a proposition: they would pay him directly for
    his produce, and he would give them all of his harvest. At
    present, in Japan, about 50,000 families belong to these
    consumer/farmer clubs. One such club links 1,500 families to
    15 farmers who supply them with everything from vegetables
    and fruits to fish and tofu. </p>
    <p>Today, in the United States and Canada, there are more
    than 600 CSA farms that will feed an estimated 100,000 people
    this year. Most of these farms are organic. Many predict that
    by the year 2000 the number of farms will reach over 1,000. </p>
    <p>In 1990, our farm began selling vegetables, fruits, and
    herbs through the CSA marketing concept. We were one of a
    handful of growers, nationwide, experimenting with this idea.
    It has been so successful that today, 6 years later, we still
    sell much of our produce this way. Now, our farm is not
    ideally located for retail sales, situated 4 miles from the
    nearest highway. Still, we have members (shareholders) who
    live in Washington, DC, about 65 miles from our farm. In some
    cases we deliver to a drop-off point, but we encourage
    members to pick up at the farm. Most of our produce is picked
    the day of delivery. Members receive one or two shopping bags
    of produce each week, with no further payment after the
    advance payment is completed. The shareholders love the idea
    of just-picked, nutritious produce being available to them
    every week throughout the growing season. It's as if they
    went to their back yard and picked their own fruits and
    vegetables. </p>
    <p>Our experience with Community Supported Agriculture has
    demonstrated that large acreage, convenient location and
    expensive machinery are not essential to the success of this
    marketing method. </p>
    <h3><b>How does the Consumer benefit?</b> </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All produce is garden fresh and fully ripe; in most
            cases, picked just before delivery. </li>
        <li>The cost is about the same as in the supermarket, but
            substantially less than prices at organic produce
            counters. </li>
        <li>Adults - and especially children - benefit by seeing
            where and how their food is grown. </li>
        <li>This operation is convenient for everyone. The
            shopping bags are waiting for each member to pick up.
        </li>
        <li>Unlike most produce, which is shipped an average of
            1300 miles before it reaches the consumer, food from
            a local grower is fresh and is not depleted of
            nutrients, vitality, vitamins, and flavor. </li>
        <li>There is an assortment of fruits, vegetables and
            herbs not sold in grocery stores. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><b>What does the Grower gain?</b> </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Early cash flow at planting time rather than at
            harvest, giving ease to the buying of seeds,
            materials and labor. Many farmers customarily take
            out loans at planting time and repay the loan at
            harvest. </li>
        <li>Crops are sold and paid for before being planted. </li>
        <li>Crop planning is easier because the market is
            assured. </li>
        <li>The grower can concentrate on the horticultural
            aspects because the marketing is completed at the
            beginning of the season. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b><i>Perhaps the most important thing</i></b><i> is that
    the nature of the relationship between the grower and the
    consumer is changed, shifting from adversarial to
    cooperative. The greatest long-term benefit goes to the land
    itself. CSA encourages sustainable farming practices, which
    do not degrade soil and water. </i></p>
    <p>What began as an experiment in marketing for us, has shown
    itself to be a viable alternative to the traditional sales of
    produce. It is the answer not only for industrialized
    countries, but developing countries as well. Community
    Supported Agriculture can provide healthier produce to more
    people for less money, while at the same time sustaining the
    earth on which we live. I believe this marketing concept is
    the wave of the future. </p>

    <p>By now, the drought may be well on it's way to over. Just
    last night it rained almost two inches. However, several
    times during the drought I was contacted by the news media so
    that I could expound on the consequences of the drought as it
    related to our farm. My experience only proved what I had
    been told, and have suspected for quite a while, namely, that
    the media already knows what it's going to say, and they just
    want someone to which they can attribute the words. </p>
    <p>My first response when asked about the drought was, <b>&#147;What
    all farmers know about the drought is that it will eventually
    go away, but the government won't.&#148;</b> This response
    surprised those who asked enough, so that, I had to explain
    it in brief. I've had more time to think about it and will
    explain in more detail here my experience. Within the past
    ten years most farmers have had to become <i>certified
    pesticide applicators</i>, meeting education standards set by
    both the federal and state governments. They have also had to
    undergo the expense of training their employees in the same
    manner under regulations set by the federal government. Laws
    have become especially constrictive in the area if employing
    non-family labor. I know of one farmer that was fined for not
    putting in writing to his employees that they did not have to
    purchase sodas out of the soda machine located on the farm.
    Farms are in almost constant threat of being taken out of
    production due to a barrage of environmental laws.
    Agriculture has come under attack for a farm bill that is not
    meant, in reality, to make farmers wealthy but to ensure a
    stable, inexpensive food supply for the nation. The fact is
    that farmers are willing to take the risks of a free market
    system but consumers will have to pay the price for the
    option as well. Did the media mention any of this while
    covering the drought? </p>
    <p>I have spent a good deal of time over the past two years
    dealing with the widening of New Hampshire Ave. Explaining my
    concern over losing my farmland and trees to the state; I was
    told by an elected state representative that it was O.K. for
    me to lose my land because the state was making an effort to
    save farmland elsewhere in the state. Although government can
    pass laws restricting the development of land, it can't force
    people to farm. </p>
    <p>By now, you must be wondering what this has to do with
    growing a tree in your back yard. I recently heard that a
    person was able to build a house in Montgomery County with
    seven bathrooms, but he could not have a chicken in his yard.
    One day you may not be able to plant a fruit tree either.
    Government employees have the ability to enforce laws in ways
    that support their personal agendas and ignore the intent of
    the law. And once a law is passed, I have been told, it is
    easier to amend one than repeal one. </p>
    <p>I have followed, to an extent, the Mossburg situation.
    Ignoring their latest misfortune and realizing that I don't
    like the thought of a dump any more than anyone else. I have
    this to say about that. The Mossburgs were operating a dump
    in north Potomac. The county allowed the area to be built up
    around them and their new neighbors want the dump closed.
    Don't the people that live there now have a responsibility to
    handle their own trash instead of dumping it off elsewhere? </p>
    <p>I would like to make these points: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>It's easy for ninety-nine percent of the people to
            impose their will on the one percent, it takes
            courage for the ninety-nine percent to handle their
            problems before they destroy the one percent. </li>
        <li>Secondly, the Md. Dept. of Transportation must
            realize that mass transportation should have a higher
            priority than widening a road - <i>find a way to do
            more with what you have before you take from someone
            else.</i> </li>
        <li>It should be made as difficult to pass a law as it is
            to repeal one. The fact is the laws are probably on
            the books to remedy almost any problem and better
            enforcement directed to the intent of the law needs
            to be accomplished. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>One may ask, why is this farm, which seems to be under
    constant attack from the government, still here?<b> </b>The
    answer is simply that we have the most supportive and
    appreciative customers one could ever hope to have and once
    you get past dealing with the government, this is a really
    nice way to make living, in spite of the weather. </p>
    <p>Next month, I promise, something about fruit trees. (Oh
    yeah, make sure you pick the fallen fruit from your trees to
    eliminate disease problems next spring.) </p>

<blockquote>
    <h1><font size="6" face="Arial Black"><img

    </font><font size="5"><strong>April's Garden<br>
    </strong></font><font size="4"><em><strong>by Sherry Kitchen</strong></em></font></h1>
    <p><font color="#000000">Spring cleaning the garden is so
    much more fun than cleaning the house. Sun and fresh air
    improves the spirit. </font></p>
    <h4><font color="#000000">Lawn care</font></h4>
    <p><font color="#000000">Reseeding works well in early spring
    as long as adequate water is supplied. Careful selection of
    seed types for location plus a covering of straw to hold in
    moisture and shade seedlings helps a bit, too. Starter
    fertilizer rather than a general fertilizer prevents nitrogen
    burn on your new turf. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Older lawns need fertilizer, too.
    Healthy lawns are more drought, weed and disease resistant.
    Remember to service your mower before use. And each spring
    it's good idea to resharpen the blades. A clean cut keeps the
    grass healthy. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Area CES (Cooperative Extension
    Svc.) and US Arboretum IPM experts recommend applying a
    pre-emergent weed killer to lawns now. With a repeat
    application required after a 6-8 week interval. For addition
    information check with a good nursery or call your local CES
    office. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">The first cut should be after the
    grass is up 2.&quot; The recommended height to keep crabgrass
    in the shade is 3.&quot; So try to set the blade height at
    that level. </font></p>
    <h4><font color="#000000">Trees &amp; Shrubs</font></h4>
    <p><font color="#000000">Bare-root trees and shrubs are best
    planted by early in the month or wait till fall. They should
    be dormant or just breaking dormancy. For most trees and
    shrubs the planting depth is critical. Be sure the plant is
    at the correct level by mounding the soil into a small hill
    within the planting hole and spreading the roots around the
    hill. Though I haven't tried it, one resource suggests
    placing some rocks on top of the mounded earth to prevent
    sinking. If container grown plants are to be planted remove
    the potting medium from the roots and blend it with your
    backfill soil. Water well and continue to provide an inch of
    water per week. These newly set out plants need your special
    attention the first year. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Most plants are searching for
    nutrients during their spring growth spurt. If you can
    provide compost, great. If not find a slow- release balanced
    fertilizer that will continue to feed them throughout the
    season. Osmocote has an 8 or 9-month mixture for flowers and
    vegetables that provides good results. Ask at your favorite
    nursery what mixture they recommend or try blending your
    own.* </font></p>
    <h4><font color="#000000">Vegetables &amp; Fruits</font></h4>
    <p><font color="#000000">Begin to sow cool season vegies like
    lettuce, peas and radishes. Set out broccoli, cabbage and
    onions plants. Get your potatoes in, too. There are lots of
    interesting choices this year. Garlic can be planted in early
    spring although fall is probably a better time. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Herbs can be inter-planted in the
    vegetable garden. Annuals such as basil, cilantro, dill make
    good companions to vegetables. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Remember successive sowings stagger
    and length harvest times. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">Berry vines need their annual prune
    so detangle and re-tie them. </font></p>
    <h4><font color="#000000">Perennials</font></h4>
    <p><font color="#000000">Divide, thin and plant summer and
    fall blooming perennials in early spring. Whenever you plant
    or replant, it's an perfect opportunity to amend the soil.
    Try to have a bucket of compost, promix or leaf mold nearby
    and toss a handful in the hole before planting anything. This
    will also supply needed nutrients for the transplant. Herbs
    enjoy some attention this time of year. Lavender, thyme,
    hyssop, savory, and any of the woody herb plants can be
    pruned and thinned. Many suffered windburn and breakage this
    winter, go ahead and trim off foliage damage now so that new
    growth will replace the damaged area. Here are some custom
    fertilizer blends to try:* </font></p>

<title>Tulip Beds: Extend Your Flowering Season</title>

    <h2><font size="5"><strong>Extend Your Flowering Season</strong></font></h2>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#147;It comes so slowly and goes so fast...&#148; </p>
    <p>In our region, we often seem to go from dead-of-winter to
    blazing summer in a matter of weeks. Keeping spring-flowering
    bulbs going as long as possible is a real challenge, but with
    a little ingenuity, you can have a fine display right into
    early June. The secret is good planning and preparation, and
    the time to begin is right now! </p>
    <p>First, select a good location for your bulb bed. Choose an
    area of light, well-drained, fertile soil. Ideally, a bed
    placed to the north or northeast of a stand of trees, far
    enough away to avoid the heaviest roots, but near enough to
    benefit from the cooling, dappled shade of early spring is
    best for extending bloom. Design generous-sized beds&#151;at
    least 4 feet wide&#151;to allow for a solid, massed planting
    of bulbs, rather than narrow, straight rows. </p>
    <p>To plant a <b><i>Triple-Decker</i></b> bed, you'll need to
    excavate the entire bed to a depth of 8 inches, removing the
    soil and reserving it for later. As the soil is removed, work
    in plenty of rotted manure, bone meal, compost, and if
    necessary, sand. Level off the bottom of the bed and loosen
    it slightly with a rake or cultivator. Sprinkle in a layer of
    bone meal or bulb-food and begin planting. </p>
    <p>My own Triple-Decker tulip bed carpets the ground around
    several fine old flowering crabs. There is an ever-changing
    palette throughout the spring; beginning with a fiery splash
    of early color provided by <b>Kaufmannianas </b>in mid-March;
    gradually mellowing out with a succession of <b>Single and
    Double Earlies</b> and <b>Darwin Hybrids</b> that pick up the
    colors of the flowering crabs; then finishing off with
    cool-colored <b>Single Lates</b> that foreshadow and
    complement the flowering of a nearby lilac hedge. </p>
    <p>Plan carefully for both color and bloom time. You'll be
    planting from the bottom up, the <b>Darwins</b> and <b>Single
    Lates</b> going in first at the 8-inch depth; followed by the
    <b>Single and Double Earlies</b> at about 7 inches; and
    finally, the <b>Kaufmannianas</b> at 6 inches. </p>
    <p>To further extend the blooming period of each variety, you
    can also &#147;stagger&#148; the planting between layers. In
    other words, half the Darwins at 8 inches, half at 7 inches;
    half the Kaufmannianas at 6, half at 7. The deeper bulbs
    (within reason) will bloom later; shallower bulbs, earlier.
    By staggering the layers you'll avoid bare periods if one
    variety fades before the next is fully open. </p>
    <p>To get the succession of color I wanted for around my
    crabapple orchard, I chose a variety of hot-to-warm-to-cool
    shades. Known as `water lily tulips', flaming red and hot
    pink <b>Kaufmannianas</b> start the show off with a bang at a
    time when everyone needs a visual lift from winter's
    drabness. `Heart's Delight', `Showwinner', `Shakespeare',
    `Ancilla', `Stresa', and `Cherry Orchard' are top picks here.
    &#147;Kaufs&#148; are short, sturdy tulips, growing only
    about 6 inches high. They're very hardy, naturalize well, and
    prefer to be left alone. In Zone 6, they can make their
    appearance quite early, just after the first crocus. Most
    Kaufs have the added benefit of &#147;flamed&#148; petals,
    which are a different color inside and out; on cloudy days,
    when the cups are closed, the bed will be a slightly
    different shade than on a sunny day when the cups are wide
    open. </p>
    <p><b>Single</b> and <b>Double Early </b>tulips start to come
    on strong just as the Kaufmannianas fade, and just as the
    crabs begin to set their cerise-colored buds. A nice mix of
    red and deep pink from `Beauty Queen', `Christmas Marvel',
    `Abba', `Electra', and `Peach Blossom' provides a graceful
    transition from the more fiery shades of the Kaufs, and picks
    up the emerging color of the trees. Early tulips are about 12
    to 14 inches tall, and are often quite sweetly scented&#151;a
    bonus, since most tulips are either scentless or only very
    subtly fragrant. </p>
    <p>As the Earlies pass, the &#147;Queen of the Tulips,&#148;
    the <b>Darwin Hybrids</b>, take center stage. Darwins are big
    and sturdy, standing 24 inches tall, with magnificent
    chalice-shaped cups&#151;the classic tulip. Their statuesque
    height and large blooms perfectly mask the by-now petal-less
    Kaufmannianas and the fading Earlies. Since Darwins make
    their appearance just about the time the crabs reach full
    flower, I chose a selection of carmines, fragile pinks, and
    silvery whites to complement the trees. `Pink Jewel', `Tender
    Beauty', `Pink Impression', `Ollioules', `Cream Jewel', and
    the silvery-pink `Elizabeth Arden' all work spectacularly
    well here. </p>
    <p>The Triple-Decker bed makes its curtain call with the
    appearance of the <b>Single Late</b> tulips&#151;a
    late-flowering form of the Darwins, with all the
    prepossessing height and vigor of their sisters. Because they
    open about lilac-time, I chose a selection of lavender and
    ivory shades as well as pinks to round out a full season of
    bloom that extends from early March to late May: `Esther',
    `Aristocrat', `Menton', `Dreamland', and `Sorbet' in pink;
    `Bleu Aimable', `Dreaming Maid', `Lafayette', for lavender;
    and `Anne Frank', in pristine white. </p>
    <p>To get a really solid bed of color, plant tulips
    close&#151;no more than 4 inches apart&#151; up to 40 per
    square yard for Earlies, Darwins, and Lates; as many as 60
    per square yard for smaller Kaufs. To mask fading foliage at
    the end of the season, an interplanting of colorful,
    spreading annuals like petunias is ideal. I usually leave
    &#147;holes&#148; in the planting bed specifically for these
    &#147;masking&#148; plants. Remember, no matter how bad it
    looks, that dying foliage is essential to the tulip's health.
    Cutting or even tying or braiding the foliage in an effort to
    hide it will vastly weaken the bulb's ability to store enough
    nutrients for next year's bloom. Remove dead foliage only
    after it is completely yellowed and withered, never before.
    As an added aid to conserving the bulb's energy, snip off the
    top inch or two of stem after the petals have fallen to
    prevent the formation of seed pods. </p>
    <p>To keep your tulips going strong for years, keep in mind
    the five primary reasons most perennial bulbs fail after the
    first season: water-logged soil; inadequate sunshine; too
    shallow planting; too early planting; and premature removal
    of fading foliage. </p>
    <p>Give your tulips what they need and they'll reward you
    with years of faithful flowering. </p>

<h1><font size="6" color="#0000FF">VIRGINIA ROUND-LEAVED BIRCH</font><font
size="6"> </font></h1>

<hr>

<h2>Betula uber </h2>

<p> Virginia is uniquely positioned to accommodate a great
diversity of flowering plants. Its latitude, topography, and
climate allow plants primarily adapted to northern climates as
well as those adapted to southern climes to grow within its
borders. Virtually all plants native to Virginia can be found
growing in other states (plants tend not to respect political
boundaries). </p>

<p> But, Virginia lays claim to one plant that is found only
within its borders: the Virginia round-leaved birch, Betula uber.
This plant's relatively recent rediscovery in 1975 and its
inclusion on the Federal List of Endangered Species make it of
particular interest and worthy of selection as a true Virginia
Native. </p>

<p> The Virginia round-leaved birch is also known as Virginia
birch, or Ashe's birch in recognition of William Willard Ashe, a
forester who first described this species. It is a member of the
birch family, Betulaceae, which includes six genera, five of
which are native to North America. Familiar members of this
family include hop hornbeams, ironwoods, alders, birches, and
hazelnuts in the genera Ostrya, Carpinus, Alnus, Betula, and
Corylus respectively. Members of several of these genera are of
interest for their usefulness-hazelnuts for food, wood of birches
for furniture and boat building, and species of ironwood and
birches for plantings. </p>

<p> The genus Betula consists of 50 species of trees and shrubs
that are distributed throughout temperate and sub-arctic regions
of the northern hemisphere. Eight of 15 North American species
grow in a variety of environments from sea level to about 4000
feet elevation in the southern Appalachians. Birches tend to
prefer well-drained soils in cool areas, particularly along lakes
and streams. </p>

<p> in one locality in Smyth County in southwest Virginia. It
grows as a small tree to about 25 to 30 feet in height. The
plant, like cherry and yellow birch, produces a characteristic
wintergreen odor when its shoots or leaves are crushed. The bark
is typical of birches, being dark and covered with lenticels
which are openings that allow for gas exchange. </p>

<p> The plant's leaves are among its most distinctive traits,
measuring about 1-inch in length with an almost rounded tip and
base. Leaves are smooth over the blade, coarsely toothed along
the margins, and attached to stems in the alternating pattern
typical of other birches. </p>

<p> The tiny, clustered flowers form structures called catkins.
Male and female flowers are located on separate distinctive
catkins within an an individual plant. Male catkins, each
measuring 2.5 to 3 inches, appear in groups. Female catkins
produce erect fruits that measure 1 to 1.5 inches in length. </p>

<p> At present, no ornamental use can be recommended for this
plant because trade in endangered species is restricted. </p>

<p> The tale of the rediscovery of the Virginia round-leafed
birch reads like a scientific detective story. The plant had been
documented on herbarium sheets prepared by Ashe in 1914 and sent
to major herbariums. Ashe described the plant he'd found as a
variety of the sweet birch,<i> Betula lenta.</i> </p>

<p> In the 1940's, Dr. Merritt Lyndon Fernald, a prominent
botanist at Harvard, studied the American birches. After
examining the herbarium specimens prepared by Ashe, he elevated
the plant to the level of species and named it Betula uber. But,
in a subsequent attempt to study the species in 1953, a student
named Albert G. Johnson (and later, others) failed to find it in
the wild. </p>

<p> In the 1960s, Peter Mazzeo, a researcher (and eventually
herbarium curator) at the U.S. National Arboretum became
interested in the lost Ashe's birch and began a detailed study of
all materials he could gather related to the plant. In <b>Mazzeo's
painstaking research he </b>rediscovered an <b>overlooked set of
herbarium specimens of </b>Betula uber. The critical <b>clue they
held was the </b>collection locality typically noted, but in more
or less detail depending on the collector. Mazzeo found reference
to two streams, not one, along which the plant had been collected
</p>

<p> In the meantime, Mazzeo's writings about Betula uber sparked
the interest of Douglas Ogle, a biology instructor at Virginia
Highlands Community College. On his summer vacation, Ogle began
to methodically search for the plant in nature along the creeks
in Smyth </p>

<p> On August 22, 1975, Ogle discovered and marked a group of
plants he was confident were Betula uber. A call to Mazzeo
resulted in arrangements for a trip, and these two, joined by a
small contingent of interested colleagues, verified Ogle's
discovery of about 12 mature individuals and a few seedlings. </p>

<p> Following so closely after the 1973 passage of the Federal
Endangered Species Act, this discovery attracted national
attention. It was the first woody plant to be federally listed as
endangered Much concern for the species' persistence in the early
years has been relieved by the successful establishment of
seedlings in its native environment following fencing off the
small number of mature trees, with the cooperation of private
landholders. </p>

<p> Other measures to preserve the species included captive
propagation by foresters at Virginia Tech, who distributed
seedlings in groups of three to interested botanic gardens and
arboretums. </p>

<p> The Orland E. White Arboretum now exhibits its three
individuals of Virginia round-leafed birch in the birch family
collection east of Lake Georgette.-Chris Sacchi </p>

<hr>

<p>Super fertility factories, earthworms, use a combination of
muscular action and silt and fine sand particles to grind up
organic matter in their intestine so they can digest it. Their
manure of castings have long been known to be very rich in
nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium. Recently
it was discovered that in feeding they consume spores of
mycorrhizae, beneficial fungi which help roots take up nutrients.
These spores are deposited in their castings deep in their
burrows, where roots easily find them as they grow. </p>

<p>The most important lesson learned to date is that earthworms
thrive and build the soil most effectively when <b>tillage is
avoided</b>. No till - which means leaving plant residues on the
soil and adding more organic material as mulch - brought
earthworms back to gardens and farms in great numbers. Soil
structure and fertility are rapidly improved, fertilizer needs
are greatly reduced, and erosion is halted because rain drains
readily through the wormholes. </p>

<p>Turning and churning the soil with a plow or tiller breaks up
both the worms' burrows and their middens, mounds of moist
castings them from sun and birds while they pull down and digest
plant materials. </p>

<p>There's increasing agreement among soil experts that a trowel
and shovel should be the only tools to disturb the soil. Let the
worms do the tilling - as a soil scientist says, &quot;They are
nature's perfect no-till plow, doing everything an engineer would
like to have a plow do.&quot; Digging is best limited to
essential tasks such as planting, lifting bulbs and making raised
beds, and the soil should be constantly covered with a mulch,
preferably of varied materials. Rough (unfinished) compost,
incidentally, is one of the best worm-food mulches there is. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A garden devoted to flowers whose seeds attract birds is a
    beautiful addition to any yard or patio. Native and
    cultivated plants can be used to attract such birds as the
    White-throated Sparrow, the American Goldfinch, juncos,
    thrashers, towhees and cardinals to name a few. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Larkspur (annual, self-seeding) </li>
        <li>Cosmos (annual, self-seeding) </li>
        <li>Cornflower, Bachelor's Button (annual) </li>
        <li>Cleome (annual, easy to grow) </li>
        <li>Snapdragon (annual, self-seeding) </li>
        <li>Purple Coneflower (perennial)] </li>
        <li>Four O'Clocks (annual, easy to grow) </li>
        <li>Celosia (annual, easy to grow) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other flowers we recommend (some of which are incorporated
    into other theme gardens around our nature center) are: </p>
    <p>Sunflowers, Coreopsis (tickseed) - all varieties, Monarda
    (Bee Balm and Wild Bergamot), Ageratum, Asters, and
    Goldenrod. </p>
    <p>The flowers we plant can be found in either seed packets
    or as plants at local nurseries or through mail order
    catalogues. Late fall, winter or early spring are wonderful
    times to sit down with paper and pencil to plan new gardens
    and redesign old ones. Remember to check plant height, color
    and bloom time. If your garden is to be all perennials, make
    sure you have early as well as late blooming varieties for
    color all season long. If you are planning to plant all
    native species, please make sure they have been propagated
    and not collected from the wild. </p>
    <p>When at all possible, water should also be included into
    your garden plan. There are a number of different birdbaths
    available through garden or bird centers as well as through
    catalogues. Keep in mind that in winter water becomes
    especially critical for birds in our area. Other winter tips
    - don't cut your garden down until spring. Dried flower heads
    are an important seed source for birds and can be very
    beautiful to look at. For more information and helpful
    gardening tips, consult a naturalist at the nature center.
    And visit our gardens to see how we grow! </p>

<hr>

<p>Creating a butterfly garden is an exciting and rewarding
endeavor! It is easy to invite butterflies to your area by
gardening with their needs in mind. These beautiful insects will
add bright colors and entertaining antics to your garden display.
Use the following techniques to produce a delightful butterfly
garden in your own backyard. </p>

<h3>How to Create a Butterfly Garden </h3>

<p><b>LOCATE THE GARDEN IN A SUNNY AREA</b>. Butterflies and most
butterfly-attracting plants require bright sunshine. </p>

<p><b>PLANT NECTAR-PRODUCING FLOWERS</b>. Butterflies visit
flowers in search of nectar, a sugary fluid to eat. Many native
butterflies seem to prefer purple, yellow, orange, and
red-colored blossoms. Clusters of short, tubular flowers or
flat-topped blossoms provide the ideal shapes for butterflies to
easily land and feed. </p>

<p><b>SELECT SINGLE FLOWERS RATHER THAN DOUBLE FLOWERS</b>. The
nectar of single flowers is more accessible and easier for
butterflies to extract than the nectar of double flowers which
have more petals per flower. </p>

<p><b>USE LARGE SPLASHES OF COLOR IN YOUR LANDSCAPE DESIGN</b>.
Butterflies are first attracted to flowers by their color. Groups
of flowers are easier for butterflies to locate than isolated
plants. </p>

<p><b>PLAN FOR CONTINUOUS BLOOM THROUGHOUT THE GROWING SEASON</b>.
Butterflies are active from early Spring until late Fall. Plant a
selection of flowers that will provide nectar throughout the
entire growing season (e.g. Spring-azaleas, Summer-buddleia,
Fall-chrysanthemums). </p>

<p><b>INCLUDE HOST PLANTS IN THE GARDEN DESIGN</b>. Host plants
provide food for caterpillars and lure female butterflies into
the garden to lay eggs. </p>

<p><b>INCLUDE DAMP AREAS OR SHALLOW PUDDLES IN THE GARDEN</b>.
Some butterflies drink and extract salts from moist soil.
Occasionally large numbers of male butterflies congregate around
a moist area to drink, forming a &quot;puddle club&quot;. </p>

<p><b>PLACE FLAT STONES IN THE GARDEN</b>. Butterflies often
perch on stones, bare soil or vegetation, spread their wings and
bask in the sun. Basking raises their body temperature so they
are able to fly and remain active. </p>

<p><b>DO NOT USE PESTICIDES IN OR NEAR A BUTTERFLY GARDEN</b>.
Most traditional garden pesticides are toxic to butterflies. Use
predatory insects, insecticidal soap or hand to remove the pests
if problems occur. </p>

<p><b>BECOME A BUTTERFLY WATCHER!</b> Get to know the colorful
butterflies that visit your garden. They are easy to identify
with a field guide such as Butterflies and Moths--A Golden Guide
by R. T. Mitchell and H. S, Zim. </p>

<p><b>Native</b> Nectar Plants that are Most Attractive to
Butterflies in Mid-Atlantic Region: (ranked by relative
attractiveness from most to least) </p>

<hr>

<p>Do you design and decorate your home interior with comfortable
seats, lighting, and color schemes? Have you then added ornaments
for tables, walls, and floors? One could approach outdoor
landscaping and design using many of these same steps. </p>

<p>Start by evaluating the whole exterior space. On paper, note
where and what is outside. For homeowners a useful tool is the
surveyor plat. This can be copied, and using tracing paper, draw
in what you have now. </p>

<p>Things to note: </p>

<ol>
    <li>All existing structures, walkways, trees, plants, and
        driveways. </li>
    <li>Views from windows. </li>
    <li>Immediate vicinity around doorways and entry walkways.
        These get the most viewing from residents and visitors.
        Don't forget to locate patio doors. </li>
    <li>Consider the sun's path and its influence during the
        year. </li>
    <li>Usage of the different areas of your yard. Where's the
        garbage, compost bin, garage, shed, pool, and
        recreational areas? Can you move them to better places? </li>
    <li>Consider the lay of the land by noting hills, recessed
        and low areas. This will help in the determination of
        plant placement. </li>
    <li>Note the direction of prevailing seasonally winds. In
        this area winter howls in from the northern and western
        lands. Summer's hot wind usually comes across my property
        from the southwest. </li>
    <li>Once you compile what you have, you can then consider
        what you want and how you can get it. </li>

    <h2><font size="4"><em><strong><i>by Sherry Kitchen</i></strong></em><em><strong>
    </strong></em></font></h2>
    <p>My idea of a decent garden guarantees lots of visual
    diversity with little surprises tucked 'round every corner.
    This kind of variety requires quite an assortment of plants.
    The fuel which fires my enthusiasm for gardening is that
    continuing search and anticipated discovery of a new plant
    that can promise at least three seasons of visual delight.
    With the spring planting season finally arriving, it is a
    good time to add to your collection at least one plant that
    brings some new dimension. Buying a few new plants always
    provides that additional motivating factor to go out and get
    digging again. No matter what plant gets added to my garden
    it prompts a new focus of attention and that always has a
    positive affect on my disposition. Each gardener surely has
    their ever changing list of favorites. If one wanders my
    garden you can quickly discover a few probably overused
    favorites that many might consider pesky. Each to their own. </p>
    <p>I'm plant passionate about a few winter jewels that shine
    all season. Most are treasured for their foliage, bark, shape
    or seasonal durability. Without flowers to divert the senses
    these other attributes capture your attention. </p>
    <p>For a winter ground covering in the flower border, I'm
    partial to a <b>purple black ajuga, 'Bronze Beauty</b>,'
    because it recovers so quickly from having 10&quot; of snow
    dumped on it every three or four weeks. Another multi-colored<b>
    ajuga, 'Burgundy Glow'</b> is almost a day-glo fuchsia right
    now but it has not propagated well and seems to be reverting
    back to the other type. Ajugas sometimes self-seed so it's
    hard to tell what may have happened. As far as flowers, the
    dark leaf has a taller, longer lasting and deeper blue flower
    with the blooms coming in early spring about the same time as
    the azaleas. I'm always surprised that it manages to survive
    being smothered all summer by nearby leafy perennials.
    Another exciting groundcover slowly spreading itself around
    is a <b>black mondo grass, </b><b><i>Ophiopogon planiscapus</i></b>
    '<b>Arabicus'</b>. No flower to speak of just pure black
    leaves, similar to liriope but smaller and not as prolific a
    spreader. Its black leaves are especially striking next to
    emerald moss in late February even with all that ivy creeping
    into its space. <b>Fuzzy silver lamb's ears</b> next to this
    grass creates a contrast that jumps. Lamb's ears certainly
    doesn't thrive in shade as does the mondo but both will
    prosper if given morning sun. Few silvery grey plants like
    shade as they are specifically designed to withstand full
    sun. If you grow lamb's ears, <i>Stachys byzantina</i> in a
    sunny part of your yard you'll quickly need to thin its
    spread. When faced with where to put all those thinnings you
    may want to try some shady areas. </p>
    <p>Herbs were some of the first plants I ever tried to grow.
    Because of these plants my garden smells wonderful even in
    winter. Many remain respectable all winter given good
    drainage-sage, thyme, lavender. </p>
    <p>Ornamental grasses have done well enough in my yard to
    earn new locations. <b><i>Miscanthus</i></b><b> tops the list
    for its height, movement and golden winter hue</b>. Most
    specimens in the grass family need little if any care.
    There's two more variegated beauties: A striped sweet flag<b>,
    </b><b><i>Acorus gramineus</i></b><b> 'Variegatus' </b>that
    many think of as only a pond or marsh grass does fine even in
    my dry shade. It seems totally unaffected by weather and
    expands in an interesting semi-circular fashion. Another
    clump - forming shade lover that also looks well all winter
    is <b>variegated sedge grass, </b><b><i>Carex morrowii</i></b>.
    Both of these require no special care except to make sure the
    nearby traveling ivy doesn't strangle them. Two silver blue
    and spiky grasses that also deserve mention are: <b>Blue Oat
    Grass, </b><b><i>Helictotrichon,</i></b><b> and Blue fescue</b><b><i>,
    Festuca ovina var. glauca</i></b><i>.</i> Don't cut any of
    these back except the miscanthus. </p>
    <p>As for shrubs a<b> red twig, variegated leaf dogwood, </b><b><i>Cornus
    alba</i></b><b> 'Elegantissima'</b> has given me lots of
    enjoyment this winter. It's nice positioned with a evergreen
    culinary sage, a lavender or <i>Artemisia</i> 'Powis Castle'
    growing under and through its branches and very pretty coming
    up through the snow. <b>Nandina</b> is another excellent
    winter foliage plant-leaves range from scarlet to deep
    burgundy depending on variety. They are usually full of
    berries <i>in other people's yards</i>. Mine are eaten up
    before fall's end. </p>
    <p>Evergreen shrubs and trees give the garden structure. They
    can define the boundaries and enclose a space. A canopy of
    pruned up Pines or Cedars changes the feel of any garden
    path. The enclosure redirects one's attention to create a
    quiet safe retreat. Junipers, red cedars and native scrub
    pines are my favorite enclosures because nothing else has
    grown fast enough or as well. In addition to their scent they
    provide food and shelter for birds. In the mixed border
    garden a <b>dark green swirled hinoki cypress, </b><b><i>Chamaecyparis
    obtusa</i></b><i> </i>is a really fine looking tree. Four
    8&quot; plants marked <i>var. nana gracilis</i> planted four
    years ago now range from 4' to 6' tall. That makes them much
    bigger than the 'described' maximum height of 2-3'. One can't
    always trust the labels. </p>
    <p>Broad-leafed evergreens; mahonias, rhododrendrum, azaleas;
    do not grow well enough in my soil to get a favorable review.
    Amendments and wind protection would surely correct that but
    each will require more time to tell results. <b>Old English
    Box</b> from my family's home in Delaware fares the best of
    all but these are only 2 feet tall after 20 years! Their
    scent is a welcome reminder of another time. Now several
    cuttings have rooted and are growing at the rate of about
    1&quot; per year! My yard's still wanting a good holly to
    write about but the <b>mahonias </b>are ready to bloom for
    the first time. </p>
    <p>In winter another <b>red twigged beauty is the Japanese
    maple tree</b>. My red leafed varieties are all pretty small
    yet-less than 8'- and their branches are smooth, glossy and
    dark red. These small trees are available in all sorts of
    varieties. The best place to see your choices is a good
    nursery, arboretum or a look at the newest March issue of
    Horticulture. In an article by Bob Hyland, 12 varieties hardy
    to our area are featured with accompanying photos including
    descriptions as to name and special attributes. Though most
    are a bit pricey they are treasures and worth their cost. For
    the townhouse gardener who needs to select smaller specimens
    trees these are a good choice. </p>
    <p>Surely as my garden grows so will my knowledge of plants
    to add to my garden. Every spring new specimens are tucked in
    with the hope of having found a new all season favorite.
    Perhaps this spring you too will find just the right plant
    that will bring joy to your home gardens or even your window
    sill. If you do not have a yard do not despair, for many
    years all my growing was in pots on balconies or in window
    sills. I remember asking, &quot;<b>and which direction do the
    windows face</b>?&quot; </p>

    Bed Gardening<br>
    </strong></em></font></font><font color="#004080"><font
    size="4"><em>by Sylvia Ehrhardt</em></font></font></h2>
    <p>Gardening in raised beds instead of conventional rows is
    becoming more and more popular, and it is easy to see why -
    earlier crops in the spring and later crops in the fall, more
    produce in less space, less fertilizer needed, no costly
    machinery, better drainage, fewer weeds, elimination of soil
    problems, and better root crops. Gardeners who have tried
    raised beds discover that the soil is loose allowing air,
    moisture, warmth, nutriments and roots to penetrate more
    easily, and that this method of gardening helps correct the
    problems of poor, rocky or compacted soil and extends the
    shorter growing seasons. </p>
    <h3>When to Make Raised Beds?</h3>
    <p>There is no one set time of the year to make raised beds.
    Here are three possible times: </p>
    <p><b>Fall </b>- This is the most popular time for creating
    beds because it enables the gardener to plant extra early in
    the spring. </p>
    <p><b>Spring</b> - If the soil can be worked in early spring,
    raised beds allow you to plant earlier and to provide against
    too much rain, lengthy wet spells, and other bad weather. </p>
    <p><b>Summer </b>- Planting in raised beds helps fall crops
    produce longer. </p>
    <h3><img src="../graphics/raised_bed.jpg" align="bottom"
    width="340" height="151"></h3>
    <h3>Raised Beds Can Vary in Size.</h3>
    <p>Most bed are 3 to 5 feet wide, any length, and can be
    worked from either side. A good growing bed will be 4 to 12
    inches higher than the original surface of the soil. </p>
    <p>Till, hoe, or mound the soil, with the top raked, if you
    want an easy way to make raised beds, Compacted soil needs to
    be worked loose before shaping it into beds. </p>
    <p>Support the beds with concrete blocks, or rough sawn,
    untreated lumber to keep the shape the same from year to
    year. This works well for permanent beds and saves time and
    labor for the gardener, as the beds don't have to be rebuilt
    each year. </p>
    <h3>The Advantages:</h3>
    <p><strong>1.</strong> Extending the growing season, </p>
    <p>Beds can be planted earlier in the spring, and will
    produce later in the fall. With raised beds the soil mass
    warms faster and cools more slowly than at surface level. I
    sow my spring crops, such as peas, spinach, lettuce, onions,
    greens, cabbage, etc., at least 4 to 6 weeks before the rest
    of the garden. The beds are planted as soon as the soil
    temperature is over 50 degrees. </p>
    <p><strong>2.</strong> More crops grown in the same space, </p>
    <p>Raised beds save space by eliminating unnecessary paths. A
    garden can double or triple its average yields because a
    greater percentage of garden space is available for growing
    plants. </p>
    <p>Crops can be planted by broadcasting seeds or
    transplanting seedlings in &quot;offset&quot; diagonal style
    to fill the whole bed. </p>
    <p><strong>3.</strong> Less fertilizer needed, </p>
    <p>A bonus for raised beds is that the gardener can
    concentrate soil improving efforts on the growing area and
    not on the compacted soil in the paths, thus using less plant
    food. </p>
    <p><strong>4.</strong> No costly machinery , </p>
    <p>Machinery such as rototillers and plows become
    unnecessary. Right from the beginning the beds are loose
    enough to be easily turned by hand. </p>
    <p><strong>5.</strong> Better drainage and less mud in the
    garden after a rain, </p>
    <p>With raised beds, you can enter the garden right after a
    rain without worrying about compacting the growing area. When
    the soil is not compacted it is easier for crop roots to get
    air and water and easier to have better drainage. The looser
    soil allows water to penetrate the beds without washing the
    soil particles away. </p>
    <p>Gardening need not be a muddy chore in spring if the paths
    between the beds are mulched. The paths can act as troughs
    that hold the excess water and slowly filter it downward and
    sideward into the beds. </p>
    <p><strong>6.</strong> Fewer weeds, </p>
    <p>Weeds are less of a problem in raised beds. Most crops are
    planted closely, so that the leaves of the <i>mature </i>plants
    touch. This means that the crops themselves will shade out
    most of the weeds in the beds. The weeds that do appear are
    much easier to pull, and the entire weed root usually comes
    up out of the loosened soil. </p>
    <p><strong>7.</strong> Better root crops. </p>
    <p>There is no question that root crops, like carrots and
    beets, will grow straighter and larger in the loose soil of
    raised beds. If needed, sand can be added to beds creating a
    looser soil for carrots. </p>
    <h3>Problems to Correct:</h3>
    <p><strong>1.</strong> Soil dries and warms up too fast: </p>
    <p>The tendency for beds to dry faster and warm sooner
    becomes a problem when spring and summer are windy, hot and
    dry. <i>This means that frequent watering becomes necessary.</i>
    </p>
    <p><strong>2.</strong> Moisture and temperature fluctuations:</p>
    <p>Lack of soil moisture and temperature fluctuations can
    make sensitive crops develop problems - lettuce can turn
    bitter; squash, tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers will have
    more blossom end rot; and peas will stop flowering. This
    requires monitoring and appropriate action - watering and
    mulching - to eliminate these problems. </p>
    <p><strong>3.</strong> Reduced air circulation: </p>
    <p>The close planting within raised beds may lead to reduced
    air circulation and encourage diseases. Using intercropping
    and succession planting will help reduce this problem.
    Sidedressing with compost also helps. </p>
    <p><strong>4.</strong> Need to replenish soil each year:</p>
    <p>Beds sink approximately 3 inches each year and have to be
    filled or reconstructed. </p>
    <p>Adding 3 to 6 inches of compost or top soil will eliminate
    this problem. </p>
    <h3>How to Make Raised Beds More Productive</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Create super-fertile growing beds</i>. The
            fertility of the soil is improved by adding compost,
            rotted manure, and natural forms of minerals. </li>
        <li><i>Dig the soil,</i> in the beds, to a depth of about
            2 feet (double digging), so that the root growth and
            drainage penetrate the soil easily. </li>
        <li><i>Design the beds to your climate and soil type</i>.
            This can make a difference. Wet climates do better
            with higher beds; they dry faster because more soil
            is exposed. Sandy soils dry rapidly and needs to have
            lower beds. </li>
        <li><i>Mulch,</i> with grass clippings or straw, the beds
            to prevent changes in soil moisture or temperature.
            If bed sides are exposed, mulch them. Mulching also
            helps eliminate erosion problems. </li>
        <li><i>Monitor moisture levels in the beds</i>. Be ready
            to provide extra water to the crops during stressful
            time. </li>
        <li><i>Harvest or remove plants </i>as they begin to
            crowd each other or if they appear diseased. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I like raised bed gardening because I plant earlier and
    harvest later, produce more crops per square foot than
    conventional rows, and find it easy work once the beds are
    established. I believe the advantages of this method
    outweighs other ways of growing crops. The goal of raised bed
    gardening is not in the height of the bed, but in the
    looseness and structure of the soil, and that makes all the
    difference between a very productive garden and an average
    one. </p>

    </h2>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The <b>U.S. Botanic Garden and Ikebana International,
    Chapter 1</b> have merged talents to stage a Fall Flower
    Festival. Holly Shimizu of the Botanic Garden is quite
    excited about this unique venture. &quot;The club's
    dedication to quality and art, is just fantastic,&quot; she
    says. &quot;Ikebana is such a mediative process in its
    interpretation. What impresses me most is the arranger's use
    of negative space. Everyone should take time to see this
    exhibit! The whole conservatory has been transformed for this
    festival. In the East Gallery there will be an exhibit of
    work by the Japanese artist, Jiro Okura, plus lots of mums
    and fall colors. In the Orangerie we'll be hanging baskets,
    cascading mums and fall plant displays. It's in the West
    Gallery where you'll find the Ikebana exhibit.&quot; </p>
    <p>Ikebana is an ancient art of arranging flowers or beauty
    expressed in arranging materials which may include branches,
    fruit, vegetables, rocks, shells, weathered wood, etc. The
    art is believed to have begun in 810 AD in China with the
    custom of making floral offerings to Buddha. Buddhism came to
    Japan from China via Korea early in the 6th century. A priest
    by the name of Ono no Imoko became the guardian of a temple
    in Kyoto, Japan and lived near a pool in the garden. The
    dwelling was referred to as ike-no-bo, the hut near the pond.
    Since the first arrangements were made there in that
    dwelling, this was the beginning of the Ikenobo School of
    Ikebana. </p>
    <p>Early arrangements called &quot;tatebana&quot; were made
    for special events and ceremonial occasions with prescribed
    rules as to of the use of materials, shape and containers.
    Later the fundamental rules and principles of the Ikenobo
    School of Ikebana were established by Senke Ikenobo, the 12th
    Headmaster. Then the rikka style was developed which was a
    large complex arrangement suggesting a mountain arrangement
    landscape scene. Then a simpler and smaller form was
    developed called &quot;nagiere&quot;, and later
    &quot;seika&quot; and &quot;shoka&quot; forms. These two
    styles combined the dignity of &quot;rikka&quot; and the
    informal simplicity of &quot;nagiere&quot;, and could be used
    in Japanese homes. Up until this time most of the arrangers
    were men. By 1880 young Japanese women were being taught
    Ikebana. The emphasis was on the three main lines arranged in
    an asymmetrical triangle. </p>
    <p>In 1897 the Ohara School was founded by Ohara Ryu, and a
    new style developed called &quot;moribana.&quot; Even the
    water in the moribana container became part of the design.
    Creative originality became more and more important with all
    kinds of new materials available. A Japanese sculptor, Sofu
    Teshigahara founded the Sogetsu School in 1927. </p>
    <p>These three schools, Ikenobo, Ohara, and Sogetsu, are the
    three major schools of Ikebana, but there are over 2,000
    different schools today. One of the more popular schools is
    the Ichiyo School founded by Meiko and Ichiyo Kasuya, brother
    and sister. It was founded in 1937. Their focus is on
    arrangements for personal surroundings and public spaces. The
    Chiko School was founded by Mrs. Kao Naruse. Seasonal
    materials and art objects are combined in harmony to create
    scenes of &quot;ikebana-morimono.&quot; </p>
    <p>The spread of the interest and love of this beautiful art
    is largely due to Ellen Gordon Allen, the wife of an army
    general stationed in Japan. It was her idea to create an
    organization dedicated to the study of Japanese flower
    arranging and related arts, and to the cause of world peace
    and understanding. Ikebana International has spread to 57
    countries with over 10,000 members and 150 chapters around
    the world. Washington, DC has the distinction of being
    Chapter 1. They urge you to take advantage of this excellent
    opportunity to enjoy and learn more about the living art of
    Ikebana. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Walking and working in May's garden is pure enjoyment,
    everything is so vibrant green and colorful. What a pleasure
    to spend long stretches of time outside again after such a
    gruesome winter. </p>
    <p>In May and June, oodles of garden &amp; lawn chores can be
    done. Grass usually requires cutting every 10 days at
    minimum. Cleanup continues. The garden needs constant weeding
    since every time it rains they grow faster then anything
    else. By mid-June, it's a good idea to have mulch in place
    (after you've weeded!) to hold in the moisture. </p>
    <p>In the Vegetable garden, continued <b>lettuce</b> sowing
    in May will ensure successive harvesting. Most warm season
    vegetables can be planted by month's end. Sow seed or buy
    plants at your local nursery. This year try<b> marigolds</b>
    around the perimeter of the garden or <b>basil </b>around the
    base of some of your tomatoes. These are pretty good
    companions. <b>Chives</b>, <b>dill</b> and most herbs attract
    bees and other beneficial insects. Plant them throughout the
    garden. Don't forget to run out for chives to add to salads
    and as a topping for soups. Dill and other culinary herbs are
    great to add to the grill. The flavor smokes through the
    food. </p>
    <p>If you're moving, dividing, and planting perennials, woody
    shrubs or trees, they'll need special attention for at least
    2 seasons  larger shrubs and trees might need more. Always
    check newly planted out specimens when drought conditions
    exist. Remember a thorough watering, similar to a steady
    rainfall, is best. A downpour only delivers runoff. Around
    this area, it's about June when you had better start making
    the rounds to check for signs of wilting. </p>
    <p>As I sit here and contemplate the upcoming seasonal chores
    the one critical issue this year, <i>besides weeding</i>,
    seems to be to provide support and protection  support for
    leaning lilies &amp; protection from ravenous deer and
    woodchucks. This year my garden sports some interesting
    handmade devices whose purpose is two-fold. Rather than spray
    a garlic concoction or some other purchased deterrent or
    maybe sprinkle everything with cayenne pepper after each
    rain, this year the garden has a few experimental structures.
    First the tallest are 4 to 6' tepees of bamboo rods stuck
    into the soil to the depth of about 6-8 inches then fastened
    with a woven wreath wedged down to a tight point or twine
    wound tight around the top crossing point. To my amazement
    they were sturdy enough to withstand the recent 70 mph winds.
    These tepees will provide an anchor to which my growing
    lilies can be braced so as not to repeat last year's sagging
    bloom stalks. Some lily varieties, especially the aurelian
    trumpet types grow to 7' and need a strong brace to hold them
    once the blooms begin to open. If you're lucky enough have 10
    blooms on one stem, who wants them laying on the ground? The
    other rationale is to test the theory that deer will not
    bother gardens with these tepee-type structures (we'll see!).
    Since I am unlucky enough to have a bamboo grove in my
    backyard, this also utilizes the pruned remnants from an
    ongoing battle to curb its encroachment into what I deem <b>my
    space</b>. </p>
    <p>Another unwelcome scavenger chews up the `Moonshine&#148;
    yarrow, <i>Achillea millifolium</i>, &amp; `Veitch's Blue'
    thistle, <i>Echinops ritro</i>, along with the daylilies,
    sedums and coneflowers. My guess is the woodchuck family that
    has conveniently taken up residence in the side of a hill
    about 40' from my back door is dining on the various
    assortment of goodies in my backyard. Certainly they will eat
    just about anything and the very best solution is sure to be
    a trap. However, at this point my bamboo barriers seem to
    have convinced them to stay away. The yarrow and globe
    thistle both have 8 to 10 spikes of thin bamboo rods
    encircling the plants. These are poked in about 4&#148; and
    crisscrossed over the top of the foliage. This year I hope to
    have lots of flat yellow yarrow blooms to harvest and if I'm
    lucky enough, a handful of perfectly round purple globe
    thistles. Last year this same configuration of branches
    supported the heavy peony blossoms. With peonies the lush
    foliage growth eventually covers the support stems, which is
    of course the best solution. With lily stalks one cannot
    camouflage the support structure so the best option is to at
    least attempt to make it appealing. Perhaps planting some
    morning glory seeds, nasturtiums, sweet peas or maybe a
    clematis could help disguise and `dress up' the bare bamboo. </p>
    <p>May &amp; June are flower months. Lots of deadheading
    makes more blooms. Cut some extras for a table design or
    deliver to a friend. Here's 5 rules to try out on your next
    attempt at designing a gorgeous arrangement: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Flower colors should be compatible within the
            arrangement and with the decor of the room (if
            possible) Like warm colors or cool colors and their
            complements, cool blues with cool yellows and pinks,
            not coral; it's a warm color. Whites and silvers
            blend better with cool. Creamy is a warm shade. </li>
        <li>Height should be 11/2 times the height of the
            container. If it's a flat long container, use same
            rule to follow the width. For example, a 6&#148;
            container, goes to a 9&#148; flower height, if the
            container is only 2&#148; tall but 8 &#147; long, try
            a 12 &#147; height, it should look proportionately
            okay if you follow Rule #3. </li>
        <li>Small light colors go best on top and sides with the
            darker, large blooms in the center and bottom. A
            large peony should not be the tallest flower. Keep
            these in center or bottom with a lighter line
            material at top of arrangement. </li>
        <li>Attempt to give a flow or form to the overall
            arrangement. Like an elongated `S' curve, triangular
            or pyramid. &quot;Not just a big bunch stuck in the
            container!,&quot; said the instructor. </li>
        <li>Use odd numbers of same flower like 3 roses, 5 hosta
            leaves or 7 fuzzy brown kiwi vines. Vary the heights
            first, cut them before sticking them in the oasis or
            frog. Have some part over the container edge. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy! </p>

size="6"> </font></h1>

<hr>

<p> A landscaper can be any individual or company offering
services ranging from lawn care to maintenance, installation of
plant materials, the contractor offering site construction
services such as patios, desks, grading, or roadways, or the
licensed landscape architect that offers design services.
Generally, the businesses that offer landscape installation
services beyond the services normally offered by lawn care
businesses prefer to be called landscape contractors. Many
nurseries and garden centers offer installation services and
consider themselves landscape contractors, as well. Landscape
contractors are not licensed, but are usually members of one or
several organizations that set up standards for their industry.
These associations include a Landscape Contractors Association,
the American Association of Nurserymen, The Maryland Association
of Nurserymen and the National Landscape Association (Division of
the American Association of Nurserymen). </p>

<p> Landscape architects are licensed professionals in Maryland,
as well as 48 other states in the United States and offer
professional design services related to landscape improvements.
Skills offered by landscape architects include, but are not
limited to, grading, preparation of sediment and erosion control
plan; site layout for residential, business, commercial
structures retaining wall design; deck design; house and lot
layout; road alignment; and related utility design. Some of these
services are also offered by civil engineers, licensed land
surveyors, and architects, but landscape architects integrate all
of these skills together with an understanding and sensitivity to
land development issues.<i><b><font color="#0000FF"> </font></b></i>

<h1><font color="#008000"><font size="6">GARDENING</font></font><font
color="#000000"><font size="6">RIGHT</font></font> </h1>

<blockquote>
    <p>Another article of the greatest importance appeared in the
    September issue of 'THE GREEN SCENE' (<b>Pennsylvania
    Horticultural Society,</b> 325 Walnut Street, Philadelphia,
    PA 19106). </p>
    <p><b>Sara Stein</b> is perhaps America's most eloquent
    advocate of gardening with nature. In her best-selling book, <i>&quot;Noah's
    Garden: Restoring the Ecology of Our Own Back Yard&quot; </i>(Houghton
    Mifflin, $21.95), she showed how it is possible - as well as
    essential - to landscape with native ecosystems. </p>
    <p>As San Francisco landscape architect Gary Strang has said,
    for the past 50 years our landscapes from private gardens to
    public and commercial sites have developed as sterile
    non-ecosystems which are dependent on fertilizers,
    pesticides, watering systems and an array of mostly-motorized
    equipment. Sara Stein says we have literally &quot;groomed
    the life out of our land,&quot; sacrificing everything from
    the microbes in the soil and the animals on it to the
    beneficial insects and birds of the air, <b>all in the name
    of neatness</b>. </p>
    <p>The land has its own life support system, and everything
    is interconnected. Throw away your leaves and you throw away
    next year's butterflies and moths which over winter in leaf
    litter, as well as the wildflowers they pollinate. Cut down
    the rushes around a pond and you take away the home of the
    frogs and dragonflies that control mosquitoes. Eliminate any
    naturally adapted creature or plant, and you lose a part of
    the &quot;intelligence&quot; of the land. Remove enough of
    them, and you have problems with water, pests, pollution and
    climate. </p>
    <p>It's up to the most knowledgeable gardeners to be the most
    responsible. Even small properties can be arks of diversity.
    It requires only two things: recycling every plant residue by
    mulching and composting and replacing &quot;politically
    correct&quot; lawn-flower bed-foundation plantings with
    natural eco-systems. Even small beds and meadows of grasses
    and wildflowers, mixed borders, hedgerows, mini-woodlands and
    ponds restore the diversity and efficient functioning of the
    natural community. <b><i>A special tip</i></b><i>: </i>'Birds
    are a good indicator of a healthy landscape. Their
    disappearance was my first clue that we'd done something
    wrong. Their reappearance was my first evidence that we were
    getting it right.' </p>

<title>Growing Roses in Containers</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<body background="../graphics/backgrd5.gif" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<h1><font size="6">Growing </font><font color="#FF0000"><font
size="6">Roses</font></font><font size="6"> in Containers</font><font
size="7"> </font></h1>

<blockquote>
    <h3><font size="4">Selecting a Container</font></h3>
    <p>Choose containers made of wood or of unglazed ceramic,
    because they can &#147;breathe&#148; and stay cooler than
    metal or plastic containers. The pot must have drainage
    holes, and be large enough to comfortably accommodate the
    plant's roots. For miniatures or the smaller shrub varieties,
    a container 10 to 12 inches in diameter and 12 to 14 inches
    deep will generally suffice. For hybrid teas and floribundas,
    we recommend containers at least 16 inches in diameter and 16
    to 18 inches deep. </p>
    <h3><font size="4">Planting Mix</font></h3>
    <p>Use a planting mix of 3 parts sandy loam soil to 1 part
    organic matter (or use a potting soil available
    commercially). At time of planting, add about 1/2 cup bone
    meal or superphosphate fertilizer to the planting mix. </p>
    <h3><font size="4">Planting</font></h3>
    <p>Form a mound of planting mix on which the plant's roots
    will rest. Position the plant so that the crown (the base
    where the canes join) is an inch or two below the rim of the
    container. Then fill the container with planting mix up to
    the crown. Press it down gently, then water thoroughly. The
    planting mix should finally settle about an inch or two below
    the rim, leaving a reservoir to facilitate watering. </p>
    <h3><font size="4">Watering</font></h3>
    <p>During the growing season, a thorough watering twice a
    week should suffice. However, you should regularly monitor
    the moisture content by checking the planting mix. If you can
    feel no moisture an inch below the surface, it's time to
    water. </p>
    <h3><font size="4">Fertilizing</font></h3>
    <p>After the new growth is off to a good start, fertilize
    weekly with a liquid plant food. Use half the recommended
    amount until the plant is growing well, then increase to the
    full recommended amount and use according to label
    directions. </p>
    <h3><font size="4">Location</font></h3>
    <p>Keep the plants in a sunny place where they receive at
    least 4 to 6 hours of sun daily. Avoid placing the containers
    next to light-colored walls, as excessive reflective heat and
    light may burn the foliage. During the hottest part of
    summer, take precautions to keep the roots cool. This is less
    a problem with woody or pottery containers, but roses in any
    container will benefit by being placed where they are shaded
    during the hottest part of the day. </p>
    <h3><font size="4">Winter Care</font></h3>
    <p>Roses in containers can stand temperatures down to 28
    degrees F. without protection or covering. If the temperature
    drops below 28 degrees, move the containers into an unheated
    shelter. Be sure they are not placed near a window, where
    warm sunlight might start plants growing. Water very
    lightly&#151;only enough that the soil does not completely
    dry out&#151;and don't fertilize. When warm weather comes,
    put the containers outside and care for them as before. </p>

    <p>&#147;Most of all our current knowledge of companion
    planting is the result of research done by Dr. Ehrenfried
    Pfeiffer and Richard Gregg,&#148; according to Bob Flowerdew,
    author of &#147;Good Companions&#148;. He admits that it's
    not always possible to say <b>WHY</b> a particular companion
    affect is successful. But experienced gardeners <b>know</b>
    that certain combinations do not prosper. Observation is
    usually the scientific proof for most of the following
    information. For convenience we've differentiated plants,
    herbs, and flowers. In future articles we'll pursue facts on
    the mineral accumulation of plants, herbs, and weeds for this
    is reportedly the hard evidence supporting why plants make
    good allies or rivals. It's also the reason why fruits,
    vegetable, herbs, and flowers are so good for you. They
    accumulate from their environment (soil, air &amp; water)
    minerals and nutrients to nourish us. The basis of much
    ancient herbal and medicinal remedies is the body's ability
    to better assimilate trace nutrients from foods and beverages
    we consume. Gardening has taught me to acquiesce to the
    wisdom of nature &amp; its rhythms. Sometimes futile attempts
    at control are just a chuckle for in reality one pest or
    disease merely replaces another in another place. Plants
    display positive response to a supportive environment just as
    humans do when surrounded by encouraging friends. Here's some
    suggested combinations for your consideration. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>There are 342 species of hummingbirds in the world, but
    only the Ruby-throated Hummingbird spends the summer in the
    east and winters from Mexico to Panama. </p>
    <p>It's hard to believe that such little birds have the
    ability and stamina to migrate from the tropics, either over
    land through Texas or across the Gulf of Mexico, just to
    spend the summer in Maryland and other points east. The
    following tips will help you welcome these small tropic
    travelers to your backyard, and coax them to set up shop and
    stay awhile. </p>
    <p>Hummingbirds need food, shelter and water just like any
    other wildlife species. Providing a variety of habitat
    elements for them beyond a hummingbird feeder will increase
    the likelihood that hummers will frequent your backyard all
    summer. </p>
    <p>Hummers are the deepthroats of the bird world--at least
    when it comes to the kinds of flowers they love to visit for
    nectar. Planting conspicuous displays of trees, shrubs,
    perennials and annuals with tubular flowers will greatly
    enhance your yard. Plan your plantings so that something is
    blooming during the entire season that hummers are in
    Maryland--roughly April to September. If space is limited,
    use window boxes, container gardens and hanging baskets to
    attract hummers to a porch. Hummers supplement their diet by
    eating small insects found on these plants. </p>
    <p>Another habitat element for hummers includes providing
    adequate places for perching. Perches can consist of
    clotheslines, snags or bare tree branches. Hummingbirds use
    perches for surveying their territory, resting, preening and
    cleaning their bills after feeding. If you're lucky,
    hummingbirds may opt to nest in your backyard to be near the
    rich natural food supply you've offered. Rich food supplies
    are important for hummingbirds because they eat a tremendous
    amount for their small size. To illustrate how high their
    metabolism is consider that if an average man eats about
    3,500 calories in a day, a hummingbird the size of a man
    would consume 155,000 calories! </p>
    <p>Finally, water is an important part of any hummingbird
    habitat. Running or dripping water acts as a lure for
    warblers as well as hummingbirds for drinking and bathing.
    Fine spray sprinklers also work well as water attractants. </p>

    <h2>Fresh Food Storage<br>
    <font size="4"><em><strong><i>by Sylvia Ehrhardt</i></strong></em></font></h2>
    <p>With an abundance of harvest at this time of year, I
    always look for ways to stretch my fresh food through the
    winter months until spring returns again. As much as
    possible, I supplement our usual winter diet of canned,
    frozen and dehydrated foods with fresh, unprocessed fruits
    and vegetables that I have grown and stored. </p>
    <p>In addition to utilizing the garden, a coldframe, basement
    or root cellar are possibilities for storing produce. Even if
    you don't have a garden, you can profit with winter storage
    techniques by buying from markets or roadside stands during
    the fall when prices are usually lower. </p>
    <h3>Storage Methods</h3>
    <p>There are many areas that can be used for fresh food
    storage. Here are a few ideas you may wish to experiment
    with: </p>
    <p><b>In-Ground</b> <b>Storage.</b> This is one of the
    easiest methods of storing. Carrots, leeks, Brussels sprouts
    and parsnips store well if left in the soil where they grew.
    In late fall, when the ground begins to freeze, cover the
    crops with a heavy mulch of straw or leaves - about 12 to 24
    inches high. When the vegetables are needed, pull back the
    mulch and dig up just the vegetables you want to use. </p>
    <p><b>Cold frame or plastic cover</b>. Salad greens and other
    cool-weather vegetables will survive winter's blasts if they
    are covered with a cold frame, plastic sheet, or a floating
    row cover. Here on our farm, in October, I cover the beds of
    produce I intend to save. I particularly like Reemay, a
    spun-polyester floating row cover that looks like cheese
    cloth. Fresh spinach, kale, Swiss chard, parsley and chives
    are available for the dinner table until January. In March
    these vegetables begin to grow again to give me an early
    harvest in spring. </p>
    <p><b>Outside root cellar.</b> If you don't have a basement,
    or don't wish to give up basement space for fresh food
    storage, or if you have large amounts of fruits and
    vegetables to store, you might consider constructing a
    traditional root cellar. This storage area can be completely
    under ground or dug into a hillside. Below five feet, the
    soil temperature stays around 55 no matter how cold it is
    above ground - <i>Nature's refrigerator.</i> </p>
    <p><b>Basement storage.</b> A simple, but effective,
    insulated food storage room can be created in any basement.
    With minimal expense a corner of the basement can be
    converted into an indoor root cellar. An area 8 feet by 10 is
    ample for a family of four. If possible, chose the northeast
    corner, to minimize solar heat on basement walls. For best
    results, construct it with two separate compartments, and
    provide vents for both. The reason for this is to provide two
    storage environments. </p>
    <h3>Optimal Storage Environments</h3>
    <p>To get the longest storage and best quality, you need to
    know the conditions which are required for different fruits
    and vegetables. Roughly speaking, there are two classes of
    fruits and vegetables: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>those that require <i>cool</i> temperatures of
            45-65 F and <i>low</i> humidity (below 75 percent):
            onions, winter squash and sweet potatoes, prefer cool
            and dry conditions, </li>
        <li>those that keep best in <i>cold</i> temperatures of
            35-45 F and <i>high</i> humidity (over 80 percent):
            white potatoes, root crops and apples demand a cold,
            moist environment. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Perhaps the most important determinants of success are the
    close monitoring of humidity, temperature, and frequent
    inspection of the stored fruits and vegetables. </p>
    <h3>Maximizing Storage Life and Quality</h3>
    <p>By following simple procedures, you can ensure
    high-quality fresh produce during the winter ahead. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Select the most suitable vegetables and fruits for
            storage, which are the late maturing varieties. If
            you purchase your produce, it is best to buy in the
            fall. If you grow your own, select varieties for
            keeping quality. </li>
        <li>Pick or purchase produce that is not overripe or
            tough. </li>
        <li>Do not expose root vegetables to the sun after
            harvesting. </li>
        <li>Vegetables dug during dry weather keep better. </li>
        <li>Place only perfect specimens in storage. </li>
        <li>Inspect stored crops regularly to remove any
            vegetable or fruit that is spoiled. </li>
        <li>Wrap cabbage and other strong-smelling vegetables in
            newspapers and store in separate container. </li>
        <li>Keep the storage area dark. </li>
        <li>Keep storage facilities clean. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Fresh food storage can be very satisfying. Eating garden
    vegetables during the cold of winter is an added benefit of
    gardening; I especially like to have spinach salad during the
    winter holidays. It requires very little time and energy to
    save some of the vegetables, but it does require planning
    ahead. </p>

    <p>There's an extra bonus available for the gardener who
    grows herbs. In addition to their essential use in cooking,
    some of them have medicinal value. Being easy to grow, herbs
    can provide low-cost remedies for illnesses. </p>
    <p>Primitive peoples and ancient civilizations possessed an
    extensive herbal lore that evolved over centuries of
    pragmatic testing. Although hardly &quot;scientific&quot; by
    today's standards, the research was, to a great extent,
    completely valid, based as it was on trial, response and
    observation. </p>
    <p>Many of those herbal cures were forgotten and lost as
    medical science developed more potent and reliable medicines;
    however, modern science is taking a second look at herbal
    remedies. </p>
    <p>Laurence Cherry, writing in <i>American Health</i>,
    reports, &quot;A quarter of all drugs in our country already
    come directly from plant sources (example: digitalis, the
    heart stimulant, comes from foxglove leaves) the search for
    new herbal cures has intensified. Today the world's jungles,
    forests and rugged hinterlands are where the pharmacological
    action is.&quot; </p>
    <p>My search for healing plants took place much closer to
    home - just outside the back door in my herb garden. Herbs
    are easy to grow in most climates, even indoors, but
    gardeners should be cautioned that not all herbs are safe to
    eat. I choose those that were the safest and easiest herbs to
    grow in the garden. It was interesting to me to find that
    some herbs are particularly useful against colds and
    digestive problems or have been known to strengthen the whole
    immune system. Here are a few herbs that I found useful and
    that you might want to grow. </p>
    <p><b>Aloe vera.</b> As one of the herbs being rediscovered,
    aloe is included as an ingredient in a wide range of lotions
    and cosmetics. Scientists have found that the gel from the
    leaves have the ability to cleanse, seal, and repair damaged
    skin. Aloe provides immediate and soothing relief for minor
    burns and helps heal cuts. To apply, simply break off a leaf
    and use the gel inside. </p>
    <p><b>Caraway </b>My mother always made caraway seed soup
    whenever anyone in the family had an upset stomach. It tastes
    so good I have it even when well. It's also excellent to help
    soothe an infant when it has colic. </p>
    <p><b>Cayenne Pepper </b>While black pepper is an irritant,
    cayenne is not and has important healing qualities. It is
    believed to build the blood, aid in respiratory problems and
    stimulate the heart. Cayenne is a good general tonic for the
    body and contains Vitamins C, A, and E. </p>
    <p><b>Chamomile </b>This herb, with its apple-like aroma,
    soothes and relaxes. Its sedative quality makes it an
    appropriate nightcap. It also can help relieve indigestion
    and heartburn. Chamomile has long been used by mothers as a
    tea to calm cranky babies. </p>
    <p><b>Echinacea </b>This purple coneflower is appreciated for
    its ornamental value, but it is the roots that herbalists
    have valued for years. It acts as a natural antibiotic
    enhancing the body's immune system to fight off colds, flu,
    and sore throats. </p>
    <p><b>Fennel </b>Chewing the fennel seeds is said to dull the
    appetite, thereby helping to control weight. In olden times,
    fennel was saved for fasting days to relieve hunger pains. </p>
    <p><b>Garlic </b>The virtues of the &quot;stinking rose&quot;
    have been celebrated throughout the ages. It was provided to
    the Egyptian slaves who labored to build the pyramids and was
    rationed to Roman legions. Recently, Chinese researchers have
    hypothesized that garlic may prevent stomach cancer by
    inhibiting the growth of bacteria that convert nitrates into
    cancer-causing nitrosamines. </p>
    <p>Garlic contains a substance called allicin, a powerful
    antibiotic and natural antiseptic. In England during World
    War I, raw garlic juice was diluted with water and applied
    with sphagnum moss to wounds and infections. Today medical
    researchers, mostly in Germany, have found that garlic helps
    protect against cardiovascular disease by lowering blood
    pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol. </p>
    <p>Some other qualities and uses ascribed to garlic are: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>As a remedy for colds, coughs and sore throats. </li>
        <li>To deter scurvy. </li>
        <li>As a natural insect repellent. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Ginger </b>This well known spice has medicinal value.
    It helps remove excess water from the body, making it a
    popular herb with weight watchers. It also helps reduce gas
    in the stomach, bowels and intestines. </p>
    <p><b>Horseradish </b>The white, fleshy taproot of this herb
    can help simulate secretions in the nose and bronchial tubes.
    Nibbling on this root may relieve congestion and chronic
    sinus symptoms. </p>
    <p><b>Marjoram </b>This great-tasting herb can be made into a
    tea to alleviate indigestion and headaches. </p>
    <p><b>Mint </b>Fragrant and prolific, mint serves multiple
    purposes. I use a cup of peppermint tea to ease an upset
    stomach and nausea, or to help aid digestion. It is said that
    peppermint leaves repel rodents when the leaves are spread in
    storage bins or storage areas. Spearmint leaves, which are
    milder than peppermint, make a soothing tea that can help you
    unwind at the end of a long day. </p>
    <p><b>Parsley </b>Parsley serves to stimulate appetite and
    aid digestion. It also is great for relieving stomach
    discomfort. A little known secret is that parsley, when
    chewed raw, eliminates bad breath. </p>
    <p><b>Pennyroyal </b>When rubbed on the skin pennyroyal is a
    good repellent for insects and mosquitoes. </p>
    <p><b>Rosemary </b>This fragrant herb is not only a wonderful
    spice, but can be used as a mouthwash as well. Interestingly,
    rosemary contains antioxidants and compounds reported to
    prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine in the brain. It is
    said that one of the causes of Alzheimer's disease has been
    the deficiency of acetylcholine. </p>
    <p><b>Sage </b>Sage, when boiled in water, is effective as a
    dandruff-removing hair rinse. </p>
    <p><b>St. John's-Wort </b>This herb has been used
    traditionally as an antidepressant and, in very small
    quantities, seems to have a tonic or tranquilizing action in
    humans. </p>
    <p><b>Sweet basil </b>Basil, as a tea, is useful in
    controlling vomiting. It also can be applied to insect bites
    to relieve discomfort. </p>
    <p><b>Thyme </b>This herb is an excellent salt replacement
    for those on a salt-free diet. As a tea it also relieves
    indigestion, cramps, and calms an upset stomach. </p>
    <p><b>Valerian </b>This herb is useful for calming the nerves
    and promoting sleep. </p>
    <p><b>To me it is nice to think that as I add herbs to my
    food to enhance the flavor, I am also </b></p>
    <p><b>promoting my health.</b> </p>
    <p>This informational has been gathered and summarized from a
    variety of sources believed to be reliable. If you wish to
    pursue the subject further, consult any good herb book for
    specific uses and recommended dosages of each herb. </p>

    <p>Most gardeners put their gardens to bed too early in the
    year. I have found that I grow more and more crops later and
    later each year and am amazed at the produce that I
    harvest&#151;carrots in December, spinach for Christmas
    dinner, and lettuce until the end of January. Extending the
    growing season is an easy thing to do. Gardeners think only
    cool weather vegetables will grow in the fall garden, but
    warm season crops do as well. The last planting of snap beans
    and corn harvested in September and October seems to be extra
    tender and tasty. The time to start planning and planting for
    these crops is in July and August. </p>
    <h3>The Fall and Winter Garden</h3>
    <p>There are three types of crops harvested in the fall and
    winter: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>cool season crops </i>- broccoli, Brussel sprouts,
            carrots, cauliflower, lettuce, peas, radishes, and
            turnips. </li>
        <li><i>warm season crops</i> - beans, corn, cucumbers,
            peppers, squash, and tomatoes, </li>
        <li><i>crops for fall and winter harvest then wintered
            over for the following spring harvest</i> - green
            onions, kale, leeks, parsley, spinach, and Swiss
            chard. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Gardening Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Seeds for the fall and winter garden need to be
            started no later than mid to late summer to ensure
            success. </li>
        <li>Crops grown in the fall and winter are often more
            productive than the main Spring and Summer plantings.
            They also are easier to grow because there are less
            weeds, pests, disease, and garden labor, and plants
            do not bolt to seeds or become bitter tasting. </li>
        <li>Timing is important. Most crops yield best if they
            have good early growth and well established root
            systems. This enables them to bear in the cooler,
            lower-light months ahead. </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
        <p>For example: in order to harvest carrots throughout
        the winter, I make sure they have good growth and then I
        cover them with 8-10&quot; of straw and a floating row
        cover when frost begins. It is easy to push the snow and
        straw aside to dig out the carrots. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>The <i>days to maturity </i>information on seed
            packets usually applies to the average days until the
            vegetable is fully developed and ready for picking.
            For the fall harvest add a week or more to the time
            most vegetables need to mature. </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
        <p>This is important if you are growing broccoli,
        cauliflower, and cabbage, which need time to form
        decent-sized heads. It is less important with root crops,
        lettuce, and other greens which can be harvested when
        they are small and tasty. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Start transplants in the garden or containers, inside
            or outside, three or four weeks before the
            transplanting dates. </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Here in Maryland I plant seeds of cauliflower and
        broccoli in seedling trays outside in July and transplant
        them to their beds the first week of August. Harvesting
        begins around the time of the first frost in October and
        lasts into November. Because I use floating row covers,
        the frost does not damage the crops. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>When planting in July and August, sow seeds in an
            area with light shade, out of the strong, full
            sunlight, so the seedlings do not burn. </li>
        <li>Make sure that the seeds and seedlings have plenty of
            moisture, as they will dry out, die or become stunted
            if they do not have a constant amount of water. Mulch
            the plants to keep the soil cool and moist as the
            seedlings grow. </li>
        <li>Cover the seeds about twice as deep as in the spring.
        </li>
        <li>Seedlings are transplanted into the garden bed when
            they are 2 to 4 inches tall. They need to be planted
            in the cool of the evening, in a moist, well prepared
            bed. If planted during the heat of the day, the
            plants may not recover from transplant shock. </li>
        <li>Make sure that compost, compost tea, or fish and kelp
            are added at the time of transplanting to give the
            seedlings a boost. </li>
        <li>If the daytime temperature exceeds 80 degrees, the
            seedlings need to be protected from the hot sun for a
            few days until they are established. Shade cloth or
            floating row covers hung above the seedlings works
            very well. Once the seedlings have adjusted to their
            new environment, they will begin to grow. </li>
        <li>Broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, kale, and
            cabbage grow much better in the fall and winter and
            get sweeter with the early frost. </li>
        <li>Planting warm season crops helps prolongs the
            harvest. Heat-loving vegetables grow faster when the
            soil is well heated. </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Summer squash grows until the first frost kills the
        plants or longer, if the plants are protected from the
        early frost. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Grow tunnels, floating row covers and cold frames
            help extend the harvest. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have found the late garden a rewarding experience with
    an bountiful harvest and well worth the time and effort I
    have put into it. Here is a list of vegetables and herbs you
    may want to grow for your fall and winter garden. </p>

    <p>When we first planted our dwarf orchard we included
    several varieties of apples that we had not grown before. We
    tried Cox's <b>'Orange Pippin'</b> because it was a very
    popular in England<b>, 'Granny Smith'</b> because of its
    sales in local stores and <b>'Paula Red'</b> because it
    seemed to be a very good mid summer apple as grown in
    Pennsylvania. As it turned out, neither of the first two
    varieties has been a success for us. Cox's <b>'Orange Pippin'</b>
    are adversely affected by the growing conditions here and
    we've gotten very few apples to show for our effort. On the
    other hand the <b>'Granny Smith'</b> do very well but
    compared to the other varieties we grow they don't compare in
    flavor to those found in stores and don't look the same, so
    other than to local bakers, they don't sell well. </p>
    <p>We had two options as to what to do with these trees in
    our orchard. One, we could push the trees out and replant
    other varieties, or we could graft them over to other
    varieties. We actually did both. The Cox's <b>'</b>Orange
    Pippin' were doing so poorly that we pushed out all but five
    trees and have used the ground for other crops. The 'Granny
    Smith', on the other hand were doing so well that we
    basically saved the rootstock, trunk of the tree, and the
    cost of the new trees by grafting them over to more 'Paula
    Red', which turned out as we had hoped, and our <b>'Spencerville
    Red'</b> when we first wanted to see if they would do well in
    a commercial orchard. </p>
    <p>Grafting, as a matter of fact, has been done for centuries
    and it's a useful tool not only for the commercial grower but
    also for the home gardener. Grafts can be made on both fruit
    and ornamental plants, however grafts are only successful on
    the same kind or closely related plants. For example, a graft
    can be made between a silver maple and a sugar maple, but not
    with a silver maple and a dogwood, nor between an apple and a
    peach. Often, an interesting and useful thing to do with an
    overgrown but healthy fruit tree is to cut it back and graft
    onto it a more desired variety of that particular fruit and
    start over with a tree that is then easier to care for.
    Because the roots are well established, growth will be very
    strong and the tree will soon be back in production. </p>
    <p>Knowing the meaning of often used grafting terms helps
    make the task easier. The <b>stock</b> is the root, tree, or
    portion of the tree into which the graft is set. The <b>scion</b>
    is the piece of the tree that is grafted into the stock. (For
    <b>cleft grafting</b> the scion should be from the previous
    season's growth and contain three to five buds.) The <b>cambium
    layer</b> is a single layer of living cells that is between
    the bark and the sapwood. </p>
    <p>Of course, to do any grafting, tools and supplies are
    needed. A saw, grafting chisel or hatchet, grafting wax and
    tape are the few items needed to work with. Although garden
    centers should carry these items we get ours through A.M.
    Leonard, PO Box 816, Piqua, OH 45356-0818, (1-800-543-8955). </p>
    <p>Fruit growers use cleft-grafting for both young and mature
    trees. The trunk or branches to be grafted should not be more
    than 2  inches in diameter, but we have been successful
    with trunks up to four inches. In cleft-grafting, saw off the
    stock and split it to a depth of two or three inches. Insert
    a scion with a wedge shaped base. If the stock is large
    enough, use two scions. Be sure the cambium layers match up
    between the stock and scion pieces. Use the grafting tape to
    secure the scion to the stock then apply wax to the tape and
    any exposed cuts on the stock and scion, including the top of
    the scion. Although some of the buds on the scion should be
    left without wax, if they are covered they will push out
    through the wax anyway. Be sure to read the directions on the
    wax because it is very sticky and won't easily come off of
    anything. </p>
    <p>I usually heat the wax slowly in a pan that we use just
    for this purpose. At one time I did visit a school to
    demonstrate grafting. I heated the wax with a cover over the
    pan to ensure that it would be melted enough when I was ready
    to use it. Not only was it hot enough, but it burst into
    flames when I removed the cover. Fortunately, the hot plate
    was sitting on the floor and the flames didn't quite reach
    the ceiling and eventually died down to where the pan could
    be placed outside to smolder. The students let me know that
    this was much more interesting than the last speaker they
    had. </p>
    <p>On larger trees more than one variety can be grafted onto
    the stock. The difference in growth habits of different
    varieties will be noticed in a tree done in this manner. </p>
    <p>The best time to cleft graft is in the early spring, just
    before growth starts. In our orchard we will graft from mid
    February to mid March. </p>
    <p>Where two scion pieces were grafted into one section of
    stock come back next spring and remove the weaker scion. If
    both scions are allowed to remain, broken branches usually
    result. </p>
    <p>If you have any questions about grafting we will be happy
    to answer them. Apple tree grafting and pruning
    demonstrations are given by request until March when we begin
    pruning our peaches. For demonstrations on pruning peach
    trees you will find us in the peach orchard on Brown's Bridge
    Rd. the first two weeks of March. You are welcome there also.

    <h2><font size="5"><strong>March's Garden</strong></font></h2>
    <p>Well today marks the first ever hoof prints in my backyard
    gardens. The euonymus is now leafless and the ivy ripped from
    the west wall. Wonder what will be missing tomorrow. But on
    the positive side, the snowdrops are blooming. Almost missed
    them as they are only 4 inches tall and snow is still under
    their leaves. The crocus is up, though not blooming and the
    narcissus has finally broken ground. It's February 20th.
    Certainly by mid March the crocus will have begun blooming
    with daffodils soon after unless we're blasted with more
    snow, heaven forbid. </p>
    <p>In review of years past diary entries, this winter
    ranks&#133;well you know where it ranks. And with this in
    mind one's not sure when or what is safe to start in early
    March. Any bets on a normal spring? Around this region late
    winter/early spring weather can be erratic and gardening
    follows few pat rules. Though here's one golden one rule you
    can always count on: <b>Soil is ready to work if after
    squeezing a handful it crumbles instead of clumps!</b> So
    don't start removing mulch, tilling, or planting too quickly.
    The soil must dry out before you can plant or even walk
    safely! And waiting can be tedious when one's anxious to get
    something- anything started. <b>So if you want to play it
    safe</b>. Tidying up is usually one of the safest activities
    for now or maybe readying the mower and the tools for the
    season ahead. Then again how many gardeners play it safe in
    spring-maybe reckless gardening is in order. </p>
    <p><b>Cleaning up, raking and weeding is good idea</b>. Trim
    perennials that didn't get cut back last fall. Prune broken
    branches from shrubs and trees. Quite a lot of damage
    occurred from those winter storms. It can take some rather
    creative pruning to balance a shrub whose entire left side
    disappeared. Do keep the overall shape of the plant in mind
    when you start hacking away. </p>
    <p>If you need to repair prune any spring flowering shrubs or
    trees like forsythia, crabapples, or cherries save the
    branches. Some forcing can be done now. Dogwoods can be
    forced also. I admit to having much better luck with <b>forcing
    bulbs</b> and I feel better knowing I can plant them later
    instead of throwing them out. My attempts at forcing woody
    flower branches has produced puny faded flowers unless I
    contain myself to wait till the buds are bursting. They're
    bigger &amp; better left to Mother Nature. But not so with
    bulbs. The bloom seems no less satisfactory and the scent
    very welcome. </p>
    <p>It's an optimum time to <b>spread compost</b> on garden
    beds or <b>fertilize, lay sod</b> or work on <b>reseeding
    bare patches </b>in your lawn. </p>
    <p>Late March can be the time to <b>divide and conquer, plant
    a tree or shrub, and plant summer bulbs</b>. By month's end
    the soil ought to be sufficiently dried out to till the
    vegetable bed,<b> plant onion sets, start spinach or sweet
    pea plantings and maybe try a new variety of potatoes.</b> </p>
    <p>This could be the year to add a new dimension to your
    garden by laying a new stone path, building a trellis,
    starting an espalier or a new theme garden. Get out the graph
    paper it's time for a grand new plan. </p>
    <p>Of course you could forego your outside gardening
    altogether and ride off to a flower show, attend a lecture or
    visit your favorite store to see what's new. Bring home a
    hyacinth, a new tree or shrub, or maybe a new planter with
    flowers to fill it. You can keep it in the house on the cold
    nights and put it out on those sunny warm days we're all
    anxiously awaiting. </p>
    <p>Happy Spring Gardening! </p>
