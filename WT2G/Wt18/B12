NIRR's <FONT COLOR="#660000">Extended Search Options</FONT> allow for greater precision in locating the information you're looking for within the NIRR story archives.
<P>
<B>Features:</B>
<OL>
<LI><I>Full Boolean Searches</I><BR>
You can now use "AND", "OR", and "ANDNOT" and parenthesis "()" to fully customize your search. For example, to find all references to "promise" but avoid listings with "keepers" in them, use the following terms:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<CODE>promise ANDNOT keepers</CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI><I>Wildcard Searches</I><BR>
To find all references to "pray", "prayer", "praying", etc. use a "*" [asterisk] immediately (no spaces) after the partial term; for example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<CODE>pray*</CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI><I>Phrase Searches</I><BR>
You can now force the search engine to look for a phrase instead of just common words. Use '"' (double-quotes) around the terms that must be found together. Forexample, inputting <FONT COLOR="#660000">holy spirit</FONT> in the old search engine would have found all references to holy and/or spirit in a document. Now, to find only references to "holy spirit", use the following (make sure to use double-quotes!):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<CODE>"holy spirit"</CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Political and spiritual challenges face the church in Hong Kong as China's takeover approaches</B>. Christians see
opportunities for church renewal as well as openness to the gospel among their friends, co-workers, and society's
leaders, said David Wang of Hong Kong-based Asian Outreach (<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1996/041596.html">NIRR 4/15</A>). 
<BR><B>...Hong Kong residents are less fearful of the July 1997 takeover than Westerners are, said Sam Ling of the Institute
for Chinese Studies at the Billy Graham Center for World Evangelism in Wheaton, Ill</B>. Many of the younger
generation feel a connection to China and have adopted a pragmatic outlook, preparing to be regulated as well as
to minister to the mainland, he said.
<BR><B>...Christian leaders are grappling with political implications of the takeover</B>. China has asked church leaders to show
their support for reunification by participating in the selection of Hong Kong's new governor and involving their
congregations in China's National Day Celebration, Oct. 1. If the churches participate, the Chinese government will
gain a lot of recognition and respect, Wang told NIRR. But the Hong Kong church never has been political and
Christians are not sure how to proceed. Some see an opportunity to have a voice in the new government, but others
fear the church will be compromised. 
<BR><B>...China has promised not to interfere in internal affairs of the church</B>. But Communist officials will observe affairs
in Hong Kong, where more than half of the schools, hospitals, and social services are run by churches. Chinese
policy states that Hong Kong and mainland churches may not interfere in each other's business, which could put
limits on Hong Kong-based evangelism efforts, said Feliciano Carion of the Christian Conference of Asia. But
ministries that are sensitive, service-oriented, and adaptive to the changing social, political, and economic scene will
succeed, Wang said. 
<BR><B>...Hong Kong is thriving spiritually</B>. An unanticipated effect of the takeover is that many older leaders have left and
most of Hong Kong's 1,300 churches are led by pastors under 30. Most of their predecessors came from China after
the Communist takeover in 1949, while the younger pastors were born in Hong Kong and have more of a
commitment to it. They also are less denominational and more open to evangelistic cooperation, Wang said.
<BR><B>...More than 300 churches have formed in the past three years and cell groups have exploded, Wang said</B>. Churches
hold prayer rallies and minicrusades in each of Hong Kong's 19 districts. Capture Today is an ongoing city-wide
crusade sponsored by local churches that features speakers in Hong Kong's largest stadium. More than 800 churches
participated in the March for Jesus last year and churches are cooperating in an effort to mail gospel booklets to 1.5
million households, followed by visits from Christians. 
<BR><B>..."There are 1.2 billion people in China who share our culture and in less than 360 days that barrier to spread the
gospel will be removed," said Cecil Chan of the Hong Kong Baptist Convention</B>. Evangelism of mainland China
could be the beginning of a new wave of world outreach. Church-growth expert C. Peter Wagner predicted that
China will be the largest missionary-sending country in the world by 2025. "Few people are as open and aggressive
in their faith as the Chinese Christians," said Atlanta-based apologist Ravi Zacharias, who recently addressed 400
Hong Kong businessmen. "The way China goes will shape the world definitively for the next century." NIRR

<B>Seven hundred thousand people have attended services at Brownsville Assembly of God in Pensacola, Fla., since
a spiritual outpouring began there on Father's Day in 1995 (<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1996/031896.html">NIRR 3/18</A>)</B>. Some 25,000 people have made professions
of faith in Christ at the services, conducted Wednesday through Sunday each week, with a corporate intercessory
prayer meeting on Tuesdays. Dozens of people who become Christians at the services are baptized on Friday nights
at Brownsville AG and many neighboring churches. Those professing faith in Christ include the well-to-do, as well
as drug addicts, witches, prostitutes, and Satanists, who have attempted to curse the preacher and the congregation.
<BR><B>...Visitors continue to come from across the country and foreign nations</B>. Linda Fussel, a local travel agent, books
about 1,000 flights a week for people attending the Pensacola services.
<BR><B>...Each night, the crowd arrives several hours early, sitting or kneeling quietly until the 7 p.m</B>. service. After an hour
of praise-and-worship music, testimonies, and preaching, evangelist Steve Hill gives an invitation to profess Christ.
Others are invited to come forward for prayer and the laying on of hands. Unusual physical manifestations -- such
as falling down, head shaking, and jerking -- continue, but are neither downplayed nor encouraged, one observer said.
Some services end at midnight while others last until sunrise. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Many who have been "drenched in renewal rains" in Melbourne, Fla., are evangelizing others and helping the poor
(<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1995/061295.html">NIRR 6/12/95</A>)</B>. "The long-term fruit is definitely the finest I've tasted in 20 years of ministry," said Michael
Thompson, senior pastor at Tabernacle Church, an interdenominational, charismatic congregation. Special services
that began Jan. 1, 1995, continue on Friday nights.
<BR><B>....Nine churches run a sidewalk Sunday school and give away groceries and clothing at housing projects</B>. Nearly
$60,000 was given through the Melbourne Renewal organization to Habitat for Humanity and ministries that aid the
homeless, AIDS patients, and addicts. For the second year, pastors, musicians, and prayer teams will lead a
conference in Honduras.
<BR><B>...Unity across denominations continues to grow as a result of the services</B>. Last year, nearly 3,000 people attended
a prayer service led by pastors from 20 churches. Pastors meet monthly to pray for one another's ministries, and 40
pastors recently attended the fourth pastors' prayer summit. On Friday evenings, area pastors or a person involved
in renewal in another area of the world address the Melbourne Renewal group. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Nearly 862,000 men have attended the 17 Promise Keepers conferences so far this year; five more stadium events
are planned</B>. The largest 1996 conference drew 70,490 to the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich. (<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1996/062496.html">NIRR 6/24</A>). Nine of
the conferences include separate gatherings for the sons of PK conference participants. In addition to its stadium
conferences, PK also is holding 450 local and regional seminars, training sessions, and smaller "wake-up call"
conferences in all 50 states and seven Canadian provinces. The group has offices in 38 states and affiliations in
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.  
<BR><B>...The men's group confirmed it will hold a prayer meeting of a million men on the Mall in Washington, D.C., in
the fall of 1997</B>. No date has been set for the event, which has been under consideration for several years. Local
events, seminars, and stadium conferences also are planned for next year. 
<BR><B>...PK stopped marketing and distributing the controversial book The Masculine Journey: Understanding the Six Stages
of Manhood (NavPress) by Robert Hicks</B>. PK said Hicks' "core theology is consistent with orthodox evangelical
Christianity" but several passages "could be understood in more than one way." The book, which was given to every
man who attended the 1993 conference in Boulder, Colo., describes theories of spiritual growth and change.
Controversy surrounding it has been a distraction, PK said. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Greg Laurie's three-day Harvest Crusade drew 50,000 people to Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego, Calif., last

the speakers was former San Diego Padre Dave Dravecky. After he lost his pitching arm to cancer five years ago,
Dravecky founded a ministry to encourage cancer victims and amputees (NIRR 5/31/93). NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Thousands of people prayed for spiritual and moral revival in Costa Rica during A Cry to God, held at La Sabana
Park in San Jose</B>. Local church leaders, Christians, and U.S.-based evangelist Alberto Mottesi prayed for six hours.
<BR><B>...Mottesi later preached in nearby Turrialba</B>. Each night, 200-400 people became Christians in the town, which has
15 congregations and fewer than 2,000 believers, the Alberto Mottesi Evangelistic Association said. Homosexuals
and alcoholics prayed to receive Christ and lead new lives, and about 200 children became Christians during youth
services, the evangelist said. City streets were empty as 5,000 people, including the mayor and the town witch,
attended one evening service, according to local pastors. A local news reporter transmitted the crusade meetings live

<B>American evangelists used mime, dance, and music to tell the gospel story at Fiesta del Fuego, a Caribbean music
festival in Cuba last month</B>. Singers performed a Spanish version of Steve Green's He Holds the Key, while actors
portrayed Christ's victory over death. Since religious themes -- mostly voodoo and the occult -- were included in
the festival, the troupe felt justified in presenting the Christian faith, one team leader told NIRR. 
<BR><B>...An 18-member performing troupe associated with the Mansfield, Ohio-based Alliance for Renewal Churches spent
17 days performing in Cuba</B>. Because the evangelical church is under persecution (<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1996/072296.html">NIRR 7/22</A>), concerts could not
be arranged in advance, "but we were amazed how day by day we received invitations" to perform, the team leader
said. Since an aggressive evangelism team recently had been expelled from the country, the troupe toned down its
performances and "worked to make contacts so we could be invited back," the leader said. After performances, the
team handed out Bibles and talked individually with audience members about Christ. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Some 150,000 Christians are helping people in crisis through Stephen Ministries</B>. Developed in 1975 by Lutheran
pastor Kenneth Haugk, the St. Louis-based ministry is named after Saint Stephen, one of seven people commissioned
by the Apostles to care for the early Christians.
<BR><B>...Churches send a few members to a seven-day seminar to learn how to set up, administer, and maintain a local
ministry, news reports said</B>. Then they select others from their churches to become Stephen Ministers, giving them
50 hours of training in areas such as listening skills and hospital visitation. Stephen Ministers meet every week, or
as required with people in need. Everything said to a Stephen Minister is confidential.
<BR><B>...Stephen Ministers are not counselors and do not fix problems or manipulate people toward certain decisions, Haugk
said</B>. They mostly just listen and help the person reach a solution to their problem on their own.  NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Volunteers have prayed with 80,000 telephone callers since the Assemblies of God 1-800-4 PRAYER line began

jobs have been provided, physical healings have occurred, financial needs have been met, and people have been
delivered from drugs in answer to prayers, said Sandra Clopine, coordinator of the National Prayer Center. 
<BR><B>...Volunteers don't counsel callers, but simply pray with them</B>. They record only their first names and the state from
which they are calling. The most frequent topics for prayer are relationship problems and physical needs. Many
callers are involved with New Age beliefs, and some say they are Christians but live grossly immoral lifestyles,
Clopine said. Some have called the center from cellular phones while driving behind a car with a NPC bumper
sticker. Local Assemblies of God churches around the country are beginning to receive overflow calls from the
Prayer Center, located in Springfield, Mo. NIRR 08/05/96

<BR><B>...In Washington, the UW increased the number of agencies it funds from 260 to 850, giving a smaller slice of the

<B>Assemblies of God volunteers are giving away groceries and preaching to impoverished people in several Western

at crusades where the altar call is given and people respond, but you wonder whether or not their salvation
experience is long-lasting or sincere," said Hal Donaldson, president of the ChurchCare America ministry. "As I
wandered through the people who flocked to the altars, the number with tears flowing was remarkable." The convoys
also include praise-and-worship music and gospel messages. In Fontana, Calif., 19 churches worked together to make
the outreach a success. Volunteers cheered when they learned that 2,000 decision cards were turned in. NIRR

105,075. Africa showed the greatest increase in that time, from 3,470 seminarians to more than 17,000. In Southeast
Asia, seminary enrollment nearly doubled to 23,943; the number of South American seminarians tripled to 17,808;
and in Central America the number doubled to 8,435. The numbers in Europe declined from 33,971 to 29,511, and

<B>Three of the 10 fastest-growing congregations in the United States belong to The International Churches of

John Vaughn. The Los Angeles ICCB church grew by 2,520 members to 7,711, and the New York church by 1,609
to 6,010 in that period, Vaughn reported in his newsletter Church Growth Today. Chicago Church of Christ grew
by 933 members, to 3,982, during that same period. 
<BR><B>...The ICCB, formerly known as the Boston Church of Christ, is an offshoot of the traditional Churches of Christ</B>.
The network moved its international center from Boston to a facility in inner-city Los Angeles that also serves as

<B>God was invoked by female as well as male imagery during the United Church of Christ's national women's meeting
June 26-30 in Boston</B>. Some 1,600 women attended the convention. Workshops dealt with earth religions, goddess
worship, and animism as well as more traditional themes.
<BR><B>...Sharp criticism of the event came from the Biblical Witness Fellowship, a theologically conservative group within
the UCC (<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1996/040196.html">NIRR 4/1</A>)</B>. Liz Claver, a BWF member who attended the convention, said that in a forum on Gaia Rising,
leader Sea Raven tried to communicate with the Greek earth goddess Gaia. In the forum on RE-Imagining, traditional
Christianity was termed "religious McCarthyism," Claver said. "A harvest of souls, requested in the opening liturgy,
happened here, but not by the Triune God of biblical Christianity." 
<BR><B>..."I don't believe we are calling up spirits," said Mary Susan Gast, a UCC official</B>. "This was not gnostic and
pagan." She defended the integrity of the convention, saying it reflected diversity within the denomination. The UCC
is not "monolithic," but encompasses "basic tensions because it is a church that accommodates a lot of viewpoints,"
Gast told NIRR. "I am a monotheist. We are talking about one God and Jesus Christ, Who loves us beyond merit." 
<BR><B>...Gast, an ordained UCC minister, officiated at a communion service while wearing an apron attached to her stole,
symbolizing "taking the ordinary and lifting it to God, tying our experience with the sacramental realm</B>." A pot of
dirt added to the traditional elements at the communion table symbolized connection to the earth. "Things look
different when women plan worship for women," Gast said. "But it doesn't mean it's corrupt or pagan." NIRR

cannot use their religious beliefs to refuse to rent to an unmarried couple. The court said the state's ban on housing
discrimination based on marital status did not create a "substantial burden" on the property owner's freedom of
religion. Evelyn Smith could have avoided the conflict by getting out of the real estate business, the court said.
Telling religious people that it is not a substantial burden to give up a right, such as the right to be a landlord, is a
"very dangerous concept," Smith's attorney, Jordan Lorence, told NIRR.

<B>The freedom of religion amendment is back before the House of Representatives after languishing for seven months</B>.
House Majority Leader Dick Armey's proposed amendment forbids the federal government and state governments
to "deny equal access to a benefit, or otherwise discriminate against any person on account of religious belief,
expression, or exercise." It would allow religious charitable groups, daycare centers, and schools to be eligible for
public funds or vouchers, the National Association of Evangelicals' Forest Montgomery told NIRR. The proposal
also specifies that the amendment does not authorize the government to "coerce or inhibit religious belief, expression,
or exercise."
<BR><B>...Supporters will push for a vote before the end of the session this summer, Montgomery said</B>. Armey proposed the
amendment after legislators failed to reach a compromise between competing proposals submitted by Reps. Henry
Hyde (R-Ill.) and Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) last year (<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1996/030496.html">NIRR 3/4</A>).

<B>The abortion pill could be legal in the United States within six months as the result of a Food and Drug
Administration advisory panel recommendation approving it</B>. Tests of RU-486, also known as mifepristone, in France
and the United States show the drug induces abortion more than 95% of the time when taken within the first seven
weeks of pregnancy, the FDA was told.

<BR><B>...Surveys show that some doctors who shun surgical abortions might offer mifepristone, but how many would
administer the drug is uncertain</B>. Two days after taking mifepristone, women must take a second drug to cause uterine
contractions that expel the fetus. They then need another doctor's exam to catch failed abortions so they can be
finished surgically. FDA advisers said they were concerned that some women, especially the poor, might skip that
exam because they can't afford it, can't miss work, or can't find childcare. NIRR 08/05/96

coordinated activities with the campaigns of former President George Bush, former U.S. Senate candidate Oliver
North of Virginia, U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia. To retain
its tax-free status, the coalition must refrain from promoting candidates.

<B>The sexual abstinence movement will reach high school and college campuses this fall</B>. True Love Waits, a
movement started by the Southern Baptist Convention in 1993 and used by numerous denominations and groups,
is providing materials for Christian club members to organize abstinence campaigns before schools open in the fall.
School clubs can sponsor events that offer students a chance to express their commitment to sexual abstinence and
its benefits, the group said. Club leaders also will collect True Love Waits commitment cards to display in schools
on Valentine's Day. "The whole idea is for young people to share the message of abstinence," said Nancy Boehmer
of True Love Waits. For more information, call 1-800-LUV WAIT. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Colombian pastor Manuel Amador was shot to death in Chigorodo, Uraba, apparently by one of several guerrilla
groups</B>. Amador died near his Foursquare church in the small town. His wife, Miriam, heard the shots from their
home and rushed to him. "I picked him up hoping he had some final words for me," she said. "To this day I don't
know who the killers are." 
<BR><B>...Christians often are the targets of warring guerrilla groups in the area, Compass Direct news service said</B>. Although
they take no sides, Christians are accused of belonging to opposing factions, threatened, kidnapped, and murdered.
Rural churches have been forced to close when members disappear or are killed. Church services must be completed
by 5 p.m. for safety reasons.   
<BR><B>...Amador was one of several pastors who pledged to stay despite the difficulties</B>. In his pockets when he died were
several notes concerning the situation. "Many [violent] sectors wonder why we do not join them. It is because we
have been warned by Jesus Christ that many people will come, apparently with godly purposes and pious acts, but
in reality deny the power of God," one note said. "We are neither judges nor God to deplore and condemn the
horrible deaths inflicted on our brethren, missionaries, and pastors. We only ask God that He, in His infinite love
and mercy, grant forgiveness to those who raised their hands to kill our brothers." NIRR 08/05/96

<B>The relationship between gambling and crime and gambling's social and economic impact is the subject of a bill sent
to President Clinton (<A HREF="/newnirr/archives/1996/020596.html">NIRR 2/5</A>)</B>. The bill establishes a nine-member commission to give communities information
they can use to make informed decisions about gambling, said Sen. Dick Lugar, (R-Ind.), co-author of the legislation.
The commission would have two years to report its findings to the president, Congress, the nation's governors, and
Indian tribal governments. It gives the commission authority to hold hearings and limited power to subpoena
documents and written answers to questions, but bars it from public disclosure of confidential information in order
to safeguard privacy and protect trade secrets. There are 500 casinos in 27 states, twice the number of five years ago,

<B>Radiocarbon tests on artifacts from Jericho may lend credence to stories in the Book of Exodus</B>. Grains from the
ancient city were dated to the early 16th century B.C., possibly near the time of events in Exodus, including the
plagues in Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, and the Israelites' 40-year wanderings in the desert. That's according
to archaeologists Hendrik Bruins, a professor at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, and Johannes van
der Plicht of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. Geologists have suggested Egypt's plagues and the
Hebrew escape from Pharaoh's army could be attributed to the eruption of a volcano in the Mediterranean Sea in
1628 B.C, news reports said. 
<BR><B>...The dating shows that the fall of Jericho could have taken place about 45 years after the eruption</B>. "This time
difference is rather striking, as it could fit the desert period of 40 years separating the Exodus from the destruction
of Jericho mentioned in ancient Hebrew texts," the archaeologists wrote in the journal Nature. Other scholars said
the conclusions lack evidence. "The science was all fine," but Bruins and van der Plicht are "archaeologically naive
by trying to fit it all together," said Stuart Manning of the University of Rading in England. NIRR 08/05/96

<B>Turkish Christians and Jews are concerned about the Islamic-led coalition that gained control of Parliament last

group that has advocated amending the constitution to declare Islam the state religion.
<BR><B>...Christians do not expect an Islamic dictatorship like Iran, news reports said</B>. One church leader said the danger is
exaggerated since the country has a "very solid secular foundation" and the military is "very vigilant." Religious
minorities in the 98% Muslim country also are heartened by Erbakan's statement that his government recognizes
freedom of religion, conscience, and thought. 
<BR><B>...Turkey is more tolerant of religious expression than other Islamic-influenced states, but repression occurs, the
Rutherford Institute said</B>. In April, a Christian was arrested, beaten, and interrogated for distributing copies of the
Gospel of John in an airport. Although distribution of Christian material is not illegal, he and his family were

<B>United Methodist minister Nathaniel Grady is free after spending 10 years in prison for sexual abuse of children</B>.
Grady was released on bail from Fishkill Correctional Facility in New York while his appeal is heard. The Bronx
District Attorney did not say whether he would retry Grady if the appeal succeeds.
<BR><B>...Grady consistently maintained his innocence, and church friends collected money to finance his defense fund</B>. A
judge ruled that Grady's previous lawyer failed to make a crucial argument. During the trial, the children had trouble
identifying their attacker, and one even pointed to the judge, news reports said.
<BR><B>...Grady started a ministry behind bars</B>. "I was grateful to God for the opportunity to be in a place where I could help
others," he told reporters. Since he never was suspended by the UMC, Grady conducted services and gave
communion, preached, and counseled. Grady, a husband and father of two, said he was not bitter. "I cannot carry

related to the Whitewater Development Corp. Huckabee has faced criticism for leaving the pastorate for politics, but
based his decision on "a compelling conviction that we were losing our country because people with convictions
refused to get involved in the political process," Baptist news sources said.

<B>Jews for Jesus is encountering organized opposition to its evangelism campaign in New York City</B>. The group put

and its leader, Patriarch Maxim, of being stooges of Bulgaria's former Communist government. The rebel priests,

affairs said the church seeks "world domination and the destruction of our society." Another government official said
Scientologists should be barred from government and teaching jobs, and the postal service has objected to delivering

meeting, hoping to dispel tensions over what the Orthodox Church sees as overzealous missionary work by Catholics
in Russia -- and possibly to plan a historic papal trip to Moscow. Aleksy II turned down the invitation because
conservative Orthodox leaders feared the pope was trying to extend Catholic influence over their church, news reports
said.

<B>The Communist defeat in Mongolia's national elections will increase religious
freedom and opportunities for Christian evangelization -- a milestone for the
country</B>. "It has taken many miracles to do this," said Craig Lawrence of Sioux
Falls, S.D.-based AMONG, a ministry to Mongolia. Communists lost almost 50
legislative seats, and two democratic parties now control 48 of the 76 seats.
Lawrence formed AMONG to take the gospel to Mongolia at the urging of
Campus Crusade for Christ founder Bill Bright.
<BR><B>...A television station AMONG started in Ulan Bator played a key role in the
elections</B>. The station, purchased last year at the request of democratic leaders,
airs news and religious programming. As the election approached and it became
clear a Communist victory would result in more restrictions on Christians,
AMONG let democrats run campaign ads on the station. To increase viewership,
AMONG bought the rights to broadcast the highly popular National Basketball
Association playoffs. "I hate mixing politics and Christ, but in this case we were
specifically directed by the Lord," Lawrence said. 
<BR><B>...The leader of the democratic coalition is a follower of Christ and is likely to
be named speaker of the Parliament</B>. Gonchigdorj, who uses only one name,
prayed to receive Christ after watching the Jesus film in 1992, Lawrence told
NIRR. Gonchigdorj annually attends the National Prayer Breakfast in
Washington, D.C., and has publicly declared faith in Christ, news reports said.
Several other members of the new Parliament have attended the prayer breakfast.
<BR><B>...AMONG also helped draft portions of Mongolia's constitution</B>. In 1992,
Lawrence led 24 American businessmen, politicians, and ministers to the
fledgling democracy as it struggled to institute reforms and draft a constitution.
They arranged the showing of the Jesus film and held seminars on democracy,
free enterprise, and religious freedom. 
<BR><B>..."Can your Jesus help us write our constitution?" a member of the constitutional
committee asked Lawrence</B>. For three days, AMONG member Randy Austad, a
former South Dakota state legislator, helped the Mongolians draft the religious
freedom portion their Constitution, obtaining advice from the office of South
Dakota Sen. Larry Pressler. On the day the team left Mongolia, the
Constitutional Congress approved the religious freedom language. 
<BR><B>...Other Christians have prayed with Mongolia's president, Punsalmaagiyn
Orchibat, a Buddhist</B>. Lawrence, accompanied by Mary Irwin, the widow of
Apollo 15 astronaut Michael Irwin, gave the president a Mongolian flag that had
been to the moon. The president embraced Irwin's adopted 22-year-old
Vietnamese son Joe and kissed him on both cheeks, an indication that he
accepted Joe as a son, Lawrence said. Joe then prayed for the president and the
country. "It would not have been appropriate for any of us to ask except Joe,
because he identified with the people," Irwin said. 
<BR><B>...The Mongolian church is growing</B>. Battle Brown, a U.S. businessman who
visits the country regularly, estimates there are 6,000-10,000 believers, up from
a few hundred in 1992. A dozen U.S. evangelistic agencies, as well as Korean,
German, Danish, Japanese, and Swedish groups, have sent missionaries.
Mongolian believers are beginning to assume church leadership, and one church
of 450 members in Erdenet is led by an indigenous pastor and has planted five
daughter churches. "Mongolians are natural evangelists," a missionary said. NIRR

<B>Five thousand youth from 60 countries are doing missions work in Brazil,
Canada, Mexico, and the United States as part of Target World '96, a Youth
With A Mission initiative July 8 to Aug</B>. 4. The youth, 10-18 years old, gathered
in Atlanta for a weeklong conference and celebration, then left to share their
faith through performing arts, sports programs, and work projects. House Speaker
Newt Gingrich praised the effort for "challenging, motivating, and
equipping...leaders of tomorrow," YWAM said. Target World is the second of
three youth missions gatherings organized by King's Kids, a YWAM discipleship
and evangelism ministry. The first took place in Barcelona, Spain, during the
1992 Olympics and another is planned for 2000. Sixteen American and Canadian
teens biked across the United States to attend the event. NIRR 7/22/96

<B>"Either all Christians are bananas or it's the coolest thing you can imagine," a
member of the Jesus Freaks of Hamburg told a crowd of youth in Dresden,
Germany</B>. "Cool," he said as hands rose in response to his call to become
Christians. The scene took place during Christival '96, a five-day gathering in
May for young Christians to celebrate Christ, renew their spiritual lives, and
evangelize. The first Christival attracted 10,000 to Essen in 1976, and about
20,000 to Nuremburg in 1988, organizers said. This year, more than 40,000
young people from 35 countries attended the festival, held in former East
Germany, where only one in four people claims to be a Christian. 
<BR><B>...Each morning at Dresden's fairgrounds, the crowd separated into 1,500 groups
of 10 to 15 people for Bible study and discipleship</B>. Then participants packed into
vans, cars, and streetcars to attend one of 46 worship services throughout the
city. Some 10,000 people visited 210,000 homes, distributed Christian literature,
and invited people to attend services. The Christival Mile, leading to the main
railway station, included 10 stages with Christian performances and numerous
booths with information about the Christian life and the work of the church
around the world. The youth also contributed money to help inner-city families
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and food for 500 Bosnian families.
<BR><B>...In the evenings, the crowd came together in the nearby soccer stadium for
worship, preaching, and celebration</B>. The final meeting was broadcast live on TV.
Thousands of youth rededicated their lives to God and hundreds more made
first-time decisions to become Christians, event organizer Roland Werner said.

<B>American evangelist Marilyn Hickey preached in Ruse, Bulgaria, last month</B>.
Some 1,200 people heard the charismatic preacher, who also conducted three
days of evangelism training for 300 church and ministry leaders. Bulgaria was
the last stop on a weeklong evangelistic trip that also included Romania, Ukraine,
and Turkey. A ministry team of 200 people accompanied Hickey.
<BR><B>...In Izmail, Ukraine, a crowded bar became the scene of a revival meeting when
team workers began witnessing to customers</B>. In Bulgaria, the group ministered
to Gypsies in street meetings in Braila and delivered 100 suitcases full of
bedding materials, shoes, clothing, toys, and snacks for the City of Hope
Orphanage in Bucharest. NIRR 7/22/96

<B>Billy Graham's June 19-23 crusade broke attendance records at the Metrodome
in Minneapolis, crusade organizers said</B>. At the final meeting, 95,000 people,
including 25,000 who watched a Jumbotron screen outside, heard Graham's
sermon and music by Amy Grant. Some 82,000 attended a youth program June
22 featuring contemporary Christian artists dc Talk and Michael W. Smith as
well as Graham's preaching. Graham had advertised the event on MTV, the FOX
network, rock radio stations, and at movie theaters. A total of 348,000 people
attended during the week, and 33,194 came forward at Graham's invitation to
confess their sins and profess faith in Christ.  
<BR><B>..."Racism, loneliness, boredom, unemployment, AIDS, murder, divorce, suicide
are everywhere," said Graham, 77</B>. The basic problem is "that the human heart
is not right with God. We're alienated from God and we need to come back to
Him, through His Son, Jesus Christ." The race problem "will never be solved
until we have the love of God in our hearts," Graham said. Families are in crisis
because "we are not following God's laws." NIRR 7/22/96

<B>Korean-American students and young professionals prayed for revival in the
United States June 29-July 4 at Colorado State University in Fort Collins</B>. The
2,300 delegates at the conference, called Jesus Awakening Movement for
America '96, came from across the country, with a few from Korea and several
other nations. They expressed deep gratitude for the influence of American
missionaries in Korea and the desire to be used by God to bring revival in the
United States. An estimated 400-500 delegates came forward to commit their
lives to full-time service for Christ, and more than 100 made first-time
professions of faith in Christ.
<BR><B>...Delegates entered into prayer, confession, repentance, and testimonies after an
address by evangelist Sammy Tippit</B>. "The vibrancy, eagerness, transparent
honesty, freedom, and earnestness of these young people was unlike anything I
have witnessed in many years of revival ministry," conference speaker Nancy
Leigh DeMoss of Life Action Ministries told NIRR. Several prominent Korean
pastors spoke, as did conference chairman Joon Gon Kim, president of Korean
Campus Crusade for Christ. Speakers also included Campus Crusade founder Bill
Bright; Concerts of Prayer International leader David Bryant; Luis Bush of the
AD 2000 and Beyond Movement; former U.S. Secretary of Interior and Energy
Don Hodel; and youth evangelist and author Josh McDowell. NIRR 7/22/96

<B>Some 14,800 people professed faith in Christ during Greg Laurie's Harvest
Crusade at Anaheim Stadium July 4-7</B>. They included a drug dealer released
from prison two days prior to the crusade, three teens on their way to Mexico
"looking for girls and parties," and a Baptist deacon who said he had been
"running from God for three years," the ministry said.
<BR><B>...About 160,000 people attended the crusade meetings</B>. In addition to Laurie,
speakers included Franklin Graham and Elizabeth Dole, wife of GOP presidential
candidate Bob Dole, who said she once let success crowd out "life's most
important priorities." High-volume Christian contemporary music preceded each
night's message, and a fireworks show capped the first night of the crusade.
<BR><B>...Laurie also preached at Disneyland May 9, and 400 people responded by
professing faith in Christ</B>. "Frontierland became holy ground," Laurie's ministry
said. "Why not? Jesus did not command the whole world to go to church," but
commanded His church to go to the world, Laurie said. NIRR 7/22/96

<B>Rob Parsons is known as "the man who reinvented fatherhood" in England</B>. His
book, The Sixty-Minute Father (Broadman & Holman), which encourages fathers
to work less and spend more time with their children, has received media
attention and a receptive audience among leaders in business, Parliament, and the
church. The book "is full of Christian faith, but is written so people who aren't
Christians can understand it," Parsons told NIRR. Parsons is executive director
of Care for the Family. The "sister organization" to Focus on the Family formed
after James Dobson suggested the idea to British church leaders. Like its
American counterpart, Care for the Family holds seminars on marriage,
parenting, and the family from a Christian perspective. Parsons teaches about 100
seminars a year.
<BR><B>...Parsons holds business-management seminars advising clients to avoid
overworking themselves and their employees</B>. "Stable home lives mean more
productive workers," he said. People who spend too much time at work are
neglecting their families, causing stress, a major cost to businesses, he said.

<B>The volatile issue of homosexual ordination dominated the 208th General
Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) this month in Albuquerque, N.M</B>.
Commissioners voted 313-236 to change the church's constitution, called the
Book of Order, by banning homosexuals and lesbians from serving as ministers,
deacons, or elders. The standards for ordination would be "fidelity within the
covenant of marriage of a man and a woman, or chastity in singleness." The
proposed policy also prohibits ordained, unmarried heterosexuals from having
sex. After the vote, about 1,000 of the 3,500 people marched through the
assembly hall at the Albuquerque Convention Center to signal their support for
the ordination of gay and lesbian Presbyterians. The policy is being sent to the
171 presbyteries, or local clusters of churches, for ratification. 
<BR><B>...About 20 pastors have told their congregations they are gay or lesbian, and 73
Presbyterian congregations have declared themselves More Light (NIRR 3/7/94)
churches, willing to ordain gay and lesbian members to church office, news
reports said</B>. Those ordained gays potentially could be charged and expelled from
the 2.7-million-member denomination if the chastity requirement is adopted into
the Book of Order, PCUSA Communications Director Gary Luhr told NIRR.
<BR><B>...Delegates elected John Buchanan, considered a peacemaker in the faction-torn
denomination, to a one-year term as moderator</B>. The Chicago pastor said he
believes homosexuals should be allowed to be ordained, but will let individual
churches decide whether they want to allow homosexual clergy to serve in their
congregations. 
<BR><B>...In a surprise vote, delegates fired -- or refused to confirm for a second
four-year term -- James D</B>. Brown as head of the church's ministry programs.
Jerry Van Marter of the Presbyterian News Service called Brown's rejection as
executive director of the PCUSA General Assembly Council "the most stunning
vote in many years" and a reflection of discontent with denominational
leadership. Van Marter noted a perceived lack of firm leadership at the council,
dissatisfaction with the denomination's debate over ordaining homosexuals, and
fallout from the controversial RE-Imagining conference in 1993 (NIRR 1/10/94).
Brown's term ends in September. The PCUSA also: voted to proceed with
participation in the Consultation on Church Union, or COCU (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/042996.html">NIRR 4/29</A>); gave
more responsibility to commissioned lay pastors; and elected Clifton Kirkpatrick,
director of international ministries, as stated clerk, or top ecclesiastical officer.

<B>The Episcopal Church's largest traditionalist organization told its supporters to
refuse Holy Communion from bishops and priests who accept homosexual priests
or same-sex unions (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/052796.html">NIRR 5/27</A>)</B>. The 21,000-member Episcopal Synod of
America adopted a formal resolution last month in Belleville, Ill., stating that
those "who knowingly ordain practicing homosexuals, authorize the blessing of
same-sex unions, or teach the same, have broken communion with orthodox
Christians until they publicly recant."
<BR><B>...Bishops and priests "sow false doctrine" when they support same-sex unions
or homosexual priests, said the ESA, which is composed of bishops, clergy and
laity</B>. Traditionalists should not participate in any functions led or sponsored by
such people, and should redirect contributions to groups that "hold to the
scriptural standards and the orthodox and catholic faith," ESA said. NIRR

<B>The Cooperative Baptist Fellowship voted not to break away from the more

motion to form a new denomination. However, a lengthy CBF report showed that
most fellowship members believe a formal split from the SBC is inevitable. The

<B>Blacks must become more politically active, delegates to the African Methodist
Episcopal Church's General Conference said</B>. A position paper issued at the
quadrennial meeting in Louisville promoted continuation of affirmative action
programs, saying they have benefited women and minorities, but noted that some
modifications are necessary to make programs more effective. The predominantly
African-American denomination also urged its members to vote, saying that in
light of the "discrimination and injustices our foreparents had to endure" to make
black suffrage possible, "non-participation in the election process is
unconscionable."
<BR><B>...The AME also said premarital sex is wrong and homosexual practices "violate
both biological design and God's intent</B>." In addition, the denomination elected
three new bishops to serve the AME Church in Africa. The AME has 3.5 million
members worldwide, including 1.5 million in the United States. NIRR 7/22/96

<B>Abortion, divorce, homosexuality, and sex outside of marriage are sins, delegates

in Indianapolis, the 230,000-member denomination criticized euthanasia and the
use of tobacco, alcohol, and drugs, and reaffirmed its longstanding support for
the ordination of women. Delegates also promised to strive for "complete racial
reconciliation." The church called on political parties to "cease their petty
bickering" and help rebuild society. NIRR 7/22/96

<B>United Methodist disagreement over homosexuality continues at the local level</B>.
Despite the reaffirmation by the General Conference of the UMC that
homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/042996.html">NIRR 4/29</A>), the
Wisconsin and the Oregon-Idaho conferences adopted resolutions declaring
themselves "reconciling" conferences. As such, they accept people of all sexual
orientations into membership and try to fully include gays and lesbians in church
life. Four UMC conferences are members of the Reconciling Congregation
Program, a network of churches, conferences, and agencies that officially express
their acceptance of gays and lesbians (NIRR 9/7/92).
<BR><B>...Meanwhile, 43 UMC pastors in the Wisconsin Annual Conference issued a
declaration saying they will not be bound by the decision of the Wisconsin
conference to welcome gays and lesbians into their churches</B>. And delegates to
the annual meeting of the West Ohio Conference voiced support for the
denomination's action in April, thus contradicting West Ohio Bishop Judith
Craig, one of 15 bishops who issued a statement during the April meeting
unsuccessfully urging the church to drop its current doctrinal stance. NIRR

<B>The Cumberland Presbyterian Church banned ordination of practicing

a resolution opposing abortion as a means of birth control, saying it is
"inconsistent with the revealed will of God." It was the first time the

<B>The United Methodist Church's method of appointing ministers may change after
New England Bishop Herbert Skeete compromised with an Andover, Mass.,
congregation, giving it veto power over his choice for pastor, the Boston Globe
said</B>. Skeete had faced an exodus from the 200-member North Boston Korean
Methodist Church, whose members insisted on appointment of a Korean-speaking
pastor. In Korea, Methodist churches operate under a system involving
negotiation and compromise in choosing a new minister. But in the UMC's
central appointment system, the bishop makes the decision. 
<BR><B>...Skeete lost one Korean flock, the former Korean United Methodist Church of
Boston, which dropped "united" from its name and adopted a charter from the
Methodist church in Korea</B>. Concerns are rising in the 13 other Korean New
England United Methodist congregations, a church spokesman said. 
<BR><B>...The UMC regularly debates the central-appointment system, and how long it
will continue churchwide is "hard to say," Skeete said</B>. District Superintendent
James Todd said, "I shudder to think how other churches, Anglo or Korean, will
react when they learn what we did in Andover." NIRR 7/22/96

<B>The Christian Reformed Church in North America refused to back down from

decision-making body, decided last month in Grand Rapids, Mich., to reject 24
petitions that challenged the right of regional church groups to ordain women.
After the vote, CRC leaders encouraged unity, but some delegates said they
planned to leave the church. Also, CRC delegates restricted ties with the
denomination's mother church, The Reformed Church of the Netherlands, over
its policy of allowing homosexuals to be pastors, which the CRC does not allow.

<B>Russian security chief Alexander Lebed pledged to tighten visa restrictions on

Lebed, who finished third in the first round of Russia's presidential balloting, to
head the country's Security Council. Lebed created a furor last month with an
angry denunciation of Western cultural influences in Russia.

Aum Shinri Kyo cult (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/103095.html">NIRR 10/30/95</A>), which prompted calls for censure by
President Clinton and members of the U.S</B>. Congress. Lebed's failure to list
Judaism as a traditional religion is a signal of "a changing Russia," American
Jewish Committee executive director David Harris said. Many Russians equate
Jews with Western influences, and during the presidential campaign several
parties exploited anti-Semitic feeling, said Adrian Karatnycky of Freedom House,
a human rights group. Last month the government closed several regional offices
of the Jewish Agency, which has organized the emigration of more than 430,000
Russian Jews to Israel since 1989. NIRR 7/22/96

pre-divorce counseling when a couple has children under 12 years of age</B>. Kasich

<B>Robert Hussein will remain in Kuwait to appeal his conviction for apostasy and
death sentence issued by an Islamic court, according to the Jubilee Campaign,
a human rights organization in Britain</B>. Hussein (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/062496.html">NIRR 6/24</A>) has been hiding
since December and would be granted asylum in the United States if he
requested it, Rutherford Institute International Director Pedro Moreno told NIRR.
"He's obviously a well-qualified case for political asylum," he said. Rutherford,
which defends religious liberty, drafted a seven-page appeal memorandum that
Hussein filed with the court June 29. A hearing is scheduled for Sept. 15. 
<BR><B>...The government of Kuwait said Hussein is not in danger since the country's
constitution guarantees religious freedom</B>. The government tolerates Christian
churches and there is no official sanction against converts. But Kuwait has two
legislative systems, the civil law and Muslim Sharia law, and confusion exists
as to which has precedence, according to Jubilee. "The Kuwaiti government must
state that the judgment of the Sharia court was unconstitutional and illegal to the
extent that it encourages people to commit murder," the group said. 
<BR><B>...International pressure in support for Hussein is growing</B>. Human rights groups,
religious organizations, and political leaders have petitioned the U.S. State
Department and the Kuwaiti government to protect him. The Southern Baptist
Foreign Mission Board, more than a dozen national evangelical alliances in
Europe, and 48 members of Congress are among those who have expressed
concern. Churches in 24 European countries have been urged to pray for
Hussein's protection. "I am living because of your prayer," Hussein said. NIRR

<B>Cuba is increasing its pressure on evangelical house churches</B>. "The oven has
been heated seven times more than what we are used to...threats are pouring in
from every side," said one pastor, whose church was closed recently. At least
nine house churches in Holguin province were closed in the last four weeks,
according to Tom White, U.S. director of the Bartlesville, Okla.-based Voice of
the Martyrs. Several churches were destroyed. In Cuatro Caminos, a police
brigade tore down a newly built church, and in Buenaventura police leveled a
house where church members had gathered for services. No reasons were given
for the actions. "No pretext is even needed anymore," a U.S. church official with
ties to the island told NIRR.
<BR><B>...The crackdown has been under way for months, the official said</B>. Seven
churches were closed in Havana this year and all evangelical churches are
endangered, he said. The total number of closures is difficult to determine.
Visitors to the country cannot preach unless they obtain a religious visa, and
house churches in some areas can no longer meet in groups larger than 10.  
<BR><B>...Pastors are not backing down from the police as they have in past decades, said
a Cuban pastor who presides over 34 house churches</B>. In Mao, where a house
church was closed, 200 to 400 Christians protested outside a station house until
police threatened to shoot them. Pastors are not complying with closure orders,
forcing the authorities to do it themselves. They also preach to the police,
although they have been warned by the authorities not to. "We share Christ with
the police and many are coming to God," the pastor said. NIRR 7/22/96

<B>There does not appear to be a conspiracy at work in recent black church arsons,
President Clinton said</B>. The fires have occurred mostly at black churches, but
statistics also show an increase of fires at white churches, synagogues, and
mosques across the country, he said. Racism is to blame for many, but not all,
of the black-church arsons, U.S. Justice Department official Deval Patrick told
delegates to the annual convention of the NAACP.
<BR><B>...Clinton designated $6 million for police to use in combatting the wave of
burnings, and signed a law doubling jail sentences for adults convicted of the
crime</B>. He met with religious leaders to build cooperation against the violence
and told the NAACP the burnings attacked "the whole idea of America."
<BR><B>...Although people of all races are helping the congregations rebuild, NAACP
President Kweisi Mfume said his group wants their help on other issues, too</B>.
"Church burnings are the tip of the iceberg," he said. Issues needing to be
addressed include efforts to gut affirmative action programs, court rulings against
minority voting districts, and cuts in education funding, Mfume said.
<BR><B>...The insurance industry, reacting to criticism that black churches torched by
arsonists have been denied coverage, said it will help find insurance for any
previously covered house of worship destroyed in such an attack</B>. Meanwhile,
more organizations contributed money and labor to rebuild the churches. Pledges
have come from various denominations, parachurch groups, foundations, and
labor unions. Promise Keepers pledged $1 million and "thousands of man-hours
of labor" to rebuild the churches. The biggest fund is $7.7 million in cash and
materials donated to the National Council of Churches. NIRR 7/22/96

<B>Americans have confidence in the financial credibility of churches, a Barna
Research Group study found</B>. Some 47% of donors interviewed said donations
to churches are used more productively than money given to other nonprofit
organizations, and an additional 38% said the money is used with equal
effectiveness. In a typical month, 45% of Americans give money to a church or
other place of worship, 41% to a nonprofit organization other than a church, and
23% to both, the survey found. Most Americans give only a small part of their
income, according to Barna. Three-quarters of adults gave less than $500 yearly
to nonprofit groups. NIRR 7/22/96

<B>Several thousand people say they have been healed of physical, emotional, or
spiritual problems after drinking water blessed by a nondenominational
Pentecostal pastor in Detroit</B>. Since mid-December, Bishop Wayne Jackson, 42,
of the Great Faith Ministries International has had large crowds at his church,
prompting him to book the city's Cobo Hall for special meetings. Healing has
come to people with AIDS, heart disease, cancer, and other ailments, as well as
to drug addicts and alcoholics, Jackson told NIRR. 
<BR><B>...People came "in droves" to services at the church after the Detroit Free Press,
local talk shows, Charisma magazine, CNN, and The National Enquirer spread
news of the healings, Jackson said</B>. Visitors brought bottled water to be blessed,
some lugging in hundreds of gallons at a time. When inquisitive nonbelievers
came for relief of pain, they heard the gospel, and "hundreds and hundreds have
been added to the kingdom of God," Jackson said. "It may sound foolish, but the
result glorifies God." 
<BR><B>...Some who drink the water are not healed</B>. Jackson makes no promises, but
notes that some of the healings have been documented by physicians. He refuses
to sell the water, and insists he is not a healer but "just a believer who believes
in the Healer. God is sovereign." NIRR 7/22/96

<B>Charities that lost money in the Foundation for New Era Philanthropy collapse
could recover 60 to 65 cents for every dollar they lost under a plan being
reviewed by a federal bankruptcy court, news reports said</B>. The plan, submitted
by bankruptcy trustee Arlin Adams and set for a hearing Aug. 1, could preclude
scores of lawsuits. "We've negotiated a fair deal. There's pain for everyone,"
Adams told The Chronicle of Philanthropy. Adams also has sued Prudential
Securities for $145 million. The brokerage company invested millions of dollars
in New Era donations, but denies it knew or should have known New Era's
activities were fraudulent. If that suit is successful, charities could recover all the
money they lost.

<B>The Cult Awareness Network will shut down because of a $1.1 million jury

mother, kidnapped him and tried to deprogram him on the advice of a CAN

<B>Exodus International, a ministry that treats homosexuality as curable, hosted 575
people at its annual conference in suburban Boston last month (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/022095.html">NIRR 2/20/95</A>)</B>.
Workshops topics included roots and causes of lesbianism, ministering to sex
addicts, and reconciliation of children and parents. Speakers describing
themselves as "ex-gays" or former lesbians, testified they are happier now that
they are leading a heterosexual lifestyle. Meanwhile, 40 Massachusetts and New
Hampshire clergy and laity signed a statement saying homosexuality "is not
sinful and does not need to be cured."  The world's largest cathedral for
homosexuals may be built in Dallas, news reports said. The proposed $20-million
Cathedral of Hope (NIRR 3/8/93) would seat 2,500, said celebrated architect
Philip Johnson, 90, who is resolutely irreligious and openly gay. Dallas'
Metropolitan Community Church commissioned the design and hopes to raise the
money to build the church.
<BR><B>...The Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches bought a
$3.8-million building in West Hollywood, Calif., to use as its first permanent
headquarters</B>. The complex will be a symbol of the "decency and permanence of
the gay-lesbian community," UFMCC founder Troy Perry said. The
32,000-member denomination has 300 congregations.
<P>
<B>The nation's largest seminary, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, is off
probation</B>. The Association of Theological Schools had imposed probation on the
Forth Worth, Texas, school in January 1995 after its theologically conservative
trustees fired former president Russell Dilday (NIRR 3/21/94). In its
investigation, the ATS determined that the seminary's trustee board failed to
provide regular evaluation of the president, deal sensitively with various seminary
constituencies, or maintain the seminary's "integrity and freedom." The seminary,
whose accreditation the ATS reaffirmed, must report by April 1997 about
policies that deal with the commission's concerns.

<B>The Unitarian Universalist Church has endorsed legalization of same-sex

marriage from another state. It also changes federal law to define marriage as a
legal union only "between one man and one woman as husband and wife." The
bill now is on the fast track in the Senate.

<B>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America said its membership was nearly

<B>At least 400 of the 10,000 athletes competing in the Olympic Games are committed Christians eager to share their
faith, according to Edward Waxer of the International Sports Coalition, who initiates and monitors sports ministries
worldwide</B>. Three billion people will watch the Games on television, giving some of these Christian athletes the
spotlight to describe their motivations, including their faith, he said. "We're more than athletes; we're Christians,"
Leroy Burrell, gold medalist who set 10 world records in track, has told reporters. 
<BR><B>...An extensive Christian witness will be taking place in Atlanta, site of the Olympic Games July 19-Aug</B>. 4. Many
Christians plan to model the gospel through practical service to fans from 198 countries attending the games. They
also will look for opportunities to befriend nonbelievers.
<BR><B>...Fifteen hundred Atlanta churches from 28 denominations are cooperating on a variety of evangelistic initiatives</B>.
Olympic visitors will receive flyers inviting them to attend concerts at 23 churches, where 250 Christian music
groups from 40 countries will perform. Forty sports-evangelism clinics, led by Athletes in Action, Youth With A
Mission, and Lay Witnesses for Christ, will take place during the Olympics. 
<BR><B>...In what has been described as the world's biggest bed-and-breakfast, the athletes' family members are being offered
free housing and one meal a day during the Games</B>. Some 3,000 families are opening their homes to the visitors. The
effort, begun by Atlanta churches, is "an enormous gift" in a city where residents are getting top dollar to provide
food and lodging, Waxer said.
<BR><B>...The Salvation Army and area churches will distribute 6 million cups of free, cold water at Olympic parking sites,
and other Christians will erect tents along highways to hand out refreshments</B>. Christians also will staff free day
camps at hotels where parents can leave their children while attending Olympic events, and are building 33 homes
through Habitat for Humanity. Churches will hold joint, interracial worship services and initiate community
development projects, and many Christians will be praying for a peaceful and safe Olympics. 
<BR><B>...Youth With A Mission is sending 5,000 volunteers from 80 nations</B>. Some 4,000 will participate in drama,
evangelism, sports clinics, and community projects, while 1,000 act as security for the Olympic Village and sports
venues.
<BR><B>...Thirty-seven volunteer chaplains from six faith groups will oversee religious services for the athletes</B>. "Because
of their being in a place where they know they need strength, guidance, and wisdom, many athletes...seem to have
a reverence for the things of God," said chaplain Keith Johnson, a United Methodist pastor from Minneapolis who
has been a Minnesota Vikings chaplain.
<BR><B>...Nine Christian organizations have prepared resources for evangelism in homes and communities around the country</B>.
Videos, magazines, cassettes, and a pocket guide to the events are meant to help believers plan sports clinics or break
the conversational ice with nonbelievers as they watch the Games together. An estimated 10,000 U.S. churches are
using the resources, available through Grand Rapids, Mich.-based Discovery House Publishers. Churches in a dozen
other countries also are using the materials in outreaches. In India, 15,000 Christian churches are using vacation Bible
school material centered on the Olympics, and in Bangladesh, Christians are holding athletic events to raise money
for the poor. For a catalog, call (800) 653-8333. NIRR 6/24/96

<B>Some 418,000 men attended Promise Keepers' first seven rallies this year, the men's ministry said</B>. The largest of
those rallies have been in Detroit (70,000), Kansas City (67,000), and in the seventh city, Atlanta (65,000).
Thousands of men have made professions of faith in Christ or rededicated their lives to God during the conferences.
Last year, 720,000 men attended 13 events, the group said. Promise Keepers' 22 events this year will conclude with
an Oct. 25-26 rally in Dallas. 
<BR><B>...Speakers this year are lashing out against racism</B>. PK founder Bill McCartney told a crowd in Kansas City that the
"insidious sin" of racism is "so engraved in society that it is not going to go away until we wake up and realize the
tremendous pain we have caused men of color." The reconciling power of the gospel is "the only thing that can bring
healing," he said. But efforts cannot be "reconciliation hype," PK Vice President Raleigh Washington said at the
Detroit conference. "Just a surface effort would be counterproductive in the end." 
<BR><B>...Interdenominational Christian unity is another of this year's themes</B>. The Saturday evening session at the Kingdome
in Seattle ended with a time of fellowship as clergy in attendance distributed 13,000 loaves of bread to the rest of
the men in celebration of Christian unity. Men taking loving responsibility as fathers and husbands has been another
conference topic. NIRR 6/24/96

<B>A total of 10,110 people made public commitments to Christ during Say Yes Chicago, Luis Palau's two-month
crusade (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/052796.html">NIRR 5/27</A>)</B>. About 44% of those made first-time professions of faith, the Luis Palau Evangelistic
Association said. Cumulative attendance at the events, which included several rallies in stadiums as well as 55
smaller events, was 129,000. 
<BR><B>...The LPEA had hoped for a much larger attendance, a spokesman said</B>. The campaign failed to draw large crowds
to the stadiums. For example, during 16 nights of meetings, the large University of Chicago Pavilion usually was
less than half full. A Memorial Day finale drew a disappointing 6,000 at an outdoor amphitheater in Grant Park as
several hundred people stood on a wet, windy, and cold day. Smaller events, which focused on specific topics such
as family life, were better attended, the LPEA said. 
<BR><B>...Although crowds at some events were small, "the gospel was very powerful in Chicago," said John Warton, Jr.,
LPEA chief operating officer</B>. Response to the messages of the various evangelists was good during all events,
Warton said. For example, a homeless man named Sammy came forward early in the crusade and made a profession
of faith. Within a week, three of his sisters attended a crusade event and became Christians. They said they had seen
such an incredible, unexpected change in Sammy that they, too, had to find out what he had heard. The "truly
multiracial" nature of the crusade also was heartening, Warton said. NIRR 6/24/96

<B>A tribe of Ethiopian nomads was not surprised when a missionary arrived in their village</B>. "They had a vision that
a man would come with a book and that they should listen to him," Ves Sheely of the Worldwide Leadership Council
said. When the missionary, known as Bekele, first met with the tribe's chief, he was given permission to stay and
later given a plot of land to build a church. 
<BR><B>...Bekele said a dream led him to the tribe</B>. In the dream, he saw Jesus' blood flowing over Ethiopia to the Omo river
and heard a voice telling him to walk for 10 days until he could go no farther, he said. Bidding farewell to his
family, he began walking south. Ten days later, Bekele reached the confluence of two rivers and could not cross.
Looking up, he saw the huts of the Tarra people and asked their permission to stay.   
<BR><B>...But Bekele faced opposition from the tribe's witch doctors, who threatened his life and tried to drive him away,
said Sheely, who visited him at the Tarra village this month</B>. The witch doctors would not let Bekele have the land
to build his church, and instead began construction of a "high place" on the site for their own worship. But on the
day the temple was completed, wind and lightning destroyed it and the witch doctors left, he said. The church then
was built, but the burned-over plot remains "as a reminder of the powers of God," Sheely said. About 70 tribe
members became Christians in the past year.
<BR><B>...In Ethiopia, Sheely participated in a leadership-training seminar conducted by the Addis Ababa-based Evangelical
Theological College and the Fellowship of Evangelical Churches in Ethiopia</B>. The three-day seminar attracted 570
pastors and church leaders, he said. Representatives from the Catholic Church and Orthodox Church attended, as well
as members of FECE, whose denominations represent some 5 million believers in Ethiopia. NIRR 6/24/96

<B>More than 18,000 people attended a four-night crusade in Nilopolis, a neighborhood of Rio de Janiero, Brazil,
Sammy Tippit Ministries said</B>. Organizers were concerned about using the Beja Flor convention center because it
is in a high-crime area, but overflow crowds filled the center the last two nights as people stood for two and a half
hours to hear the evangelist share the gospel message. More than 1,000 people accepted Christ or rededicated their
lives to God during the crusade. 
<BR><B>...The crusade was part of a larger plan to reach Rio de Janiero</B>. The Home Mission Board of the Brazilian Baptist
Commission, the Carioca State Baptist Convention, the Fluminese Baptist Convention, and Sammy Tippit Ministries
are planning a series of evangelistic crusades to cover the entire city by the year 2000. Tippit, who has preached
semiannual crusades in Brazil since the 1980s, was asked by Brazilian church leaders to focus his efforts exclusively
on the city of 11.7 million people between now and the turn of the century. NIRR 6/24/96

<B>A church with a 22-year-old pastor is running a hospital for the soul in inner-city Los Angeles</B>. Matthew Barnett
leads the Los Angeles International Church in the former Queen of Angels Hospital off the Hollywood Freeway.
Some 120 ministries, embracing the homeless, unwed mothers, gang members, drug addicts, alcoholics, immigrants,
homosexuals, and a host of others, have fanned out through the building, a 400,000 square-foot structure with 1,600
rooms. In addition, trucks carry aid from the ministry to housing projects throughout the city. Hundreds of needy
people live in the building, and 30 men live on the seventh floor and work full time refurbishing the structure. The
combined ministries reach 20,000 people a week, said Barnett, who opened the church a year and a half ago. "It's
like a '90s City of Hope," he told NIRR, referring to Mother Teresa's Calcutta outreach.
<BR><B>...A church drama, which included a professional wrestling match, scored a body slam with neighborhood onlookers
and was typical of the church's innovative ministry</B>. The Empty Ring was performed in the church parking lot and
included music, 50 motorcycle riders in full regalia, numerous actors dressed as demons, and a powerful testimony
by former professional wrestling champion turned-evangelist Jake "The Snake" Roberts (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/103095.html">NIRR 10/30/95</A>). Roberts'
testimony of childhood abuse was "the most gut-wrenching thing I have ever heard," Barnett said. Ironically, all of
this occurred while police helicopters buzzed the neighborhood during a real-life drug bust. Some 1,000 people,
including many gang members, made professions of faith in Christ during the drama.  The drama is "pretty radical.
But the church needs to be radical sometimes." The play also has been produced at Phoenix First Assembly of God,
pastored by Barnett's father, Tommy. The Empty Ring actors hope to perform it around the country. NIRR 6/24/96

<B>The Southern Baptist Convention again picked a conservative president</B>. Tom Elliff, 52, pastor of the First Baptist
Church of Del City, Okla., was elected to a one-year term on a show of hands from more than 13,000 delegates in
the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. He succeeds Jim Henry, an Orlando, Fla., pastor who completed his
second term June 13. Although largely an honorary position, the president has influential appointive powers.
<BR><B>...It was the first uncontested SBC presidential election in decades</B>. Theological conservatives control the SBC, having
won the past several elections for the presidency, whose appointments have extended the conservative orthodoxy deep
into the convention's agencies, seminaries, and publishing organs. Moderates now have little impact on the
denomination, and largely stay away from the annual meetings, news reports said. In 1991, they formed the
Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, which is theologically distinct from the Southern Baptists in their view of the Bible,
but is not a separate denomination. 
<BR><B>...Delivering his final message as president, Henry warned the conservative movement that carried him to power not
to supplant its original goal of restoring biblical fidelity with a desire to consolidate power</B>. The delegates also: Urged
members to boycott Walt Disney Co.'s parks, movies, and products to protest the company's departure from
its "family values" image (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/121195.html">NIRR 12/11/95</A>); voted to proceed with the streamlining of the denomination, which
will reduce agencies from 19 to 12, saving $34 million to $41 million in five years; condemned same-sex
marriages, saying "whatever the stakes" Baptists will never obey any law legalizing such partnerships, "so help us
God;" passed a resolution deploring the church arsons in the South. The SBC also has raised $281,000 to help the
churches and has set up a fund to collect more contributions; call (615) 244-2355. SBC volunteer construction crews
are working to rebuild some of the African-American churches. They also urged more evangelization of Jews, a
move that Jewish leaders called offensive, and criticized President Clinton, a Southern Baptist, for vetoing the
partial-birth abortion bill and for saying he prayed about the veto. After Henry and 10 former SBC presidents
complained, Clinton wrote June 7 strongly defending his veto. NIRR 6/24/96

<B>The Florida Baptist Convention expelled two churches considered to have charismatic tendencies</B>. The convention's
board of missions ruled that the churches advocated speaking in tongues and being "slain in the Spirit," in which a
worshiper faints and falls on the floor. A decision about a third church was delayed pending further investigation.
The ousted churches are Trumpets of Truth International Church in Homosassa Springs,formerly the First Baptist
Church of Homosassa Springs, and Riverside Christian Church in Hernando, formerly the Riverside Baptist Church.
<BR><B>...The churches were ousted for holding views contrary to those cited in The Baptist Faith and Message, a 1963
doctrinal statement, said John Sullivan, executive director of the Florida Baptist Convention</B>. It is thought to be the
first time a state convention has used the doctrinal statement to exercise discipline against a church. The statement's
preamble specifies it was not intended to be used as a creed but for "general instruction and guidance" of Baptists
and others. Charles Brannon, pastor of Riverside Christian Church in Hernando, said his congregation will try to
affiliate with like-minded Baptist churches. "There are a lot of Southern Baptist churches going the way we are
going," he said. NIRR 6/24/96

<B>The 10 Episcopal Church bishops who accused Bishop Walter Righter of heresy for ordaining a non-celibate
homosexual man (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/052796.html">NIRR 5/27</A>) said they would not appeal a church court's decision in his favor, but would create
"a fellowship of Episcopal parishes and dioceses" to resist gay ordinations</B>. The court found that there is "no Core
Doctrine prohibiting the ordination of a non-celibate, homosexual person living in a faithful and committed sexual
relationship with a person of the same sex." But bishops who knowingly ordain non-celibate gays or permit the
blessing of homosexual unions "do so without the authority of Scripture," the 10 bishops said at a news conference.
The group also said it will take its case to the denomination's General Convention next year. NIRR 6/24/96

<B>Twenty liberal Catholic groups began a drive to gather 1 million signatures in support of a more democratic church</B>.
The petition backs the right of priests to marry, of women to be ordained, and of lay people to participate in the
selection of pastors and bishops. The groups want more freedom for those who dissent from Church teaching and
the right of married couples to use artificial birth control, which the Vatican opposes. A Gallup Organization survey
of Catholics released May 30 found that most want the next pope to let women be ordained, priests marry, and the
laity elect their bishops, all barred under present Church rules. The petition drive is being considered a test of the
liberal groups' ability to mobilize the laity.
<BR><B>...National Conference of Catholic Bishops leader Anthony Pilla warned the petitioners, saying he supports dialogue,
but opposes "continued challenges to the teachings and the authority of the Church</B>." The National Committee of
Catholic Laymen, a Washington-based group that supports Catholic orthodoxy, accused the petition organizers of
not being Catholic because they "have probably not seen the inside of a Catholic church in years -- if ever." But
Linda Pieczynski, president of Chicago-based Call to Action, one of the organizing groups, said, "If you exclude
people like us from being Catholic, you'd see 80% of the people in the pews disappear." NIRR 6/24/96

<B>Lane County, Ore., prosecutor Doug Harcleroad said he was "wrong to authorize the taping" of a jailhouse
conversation between murder suspect Conan Wayne Hale and Timothy Mockaitis, a priest, and will not use the tape
in court (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/052796.html">NIRR 5/27</A>)</B>. Their April 22 conversation was part of the church's Sacrament of Reconciliation, also known
as confession. Hale was later indicted for murder, even though prosecutors did not use information from the tapes
against him. The tape and transcripts have been turned over to a judge and sealed, Harcleroad said. Only a sheriff's
investigator, two deputy prosecutors, and a secretary have heard the tape, he said. "Our intention was to find the truth
about the murder of three young people. This is still our intention, but this method was wrong," Harcleroad said.

<B>Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole angered pro-life leaders by advocating changes to the abortion plank of
the party's platform</B>. Dole wants to insert a "statement of tolerance" acknowledging that Republicans may disagree
on the abortion issue.
<BR><B>..."When it comes to killing children, there's really no room for tolerance," said Focus on the Family President James
Dobson</B>. Pro-life leaders had indicated that a general tolerance statement addressing all issues in the platform would
be acceptable in its preamble, but Dole insisted that a specific statement regarding abortion should be inserted into
the plank. Pat Buchanan promised to oppose the move at the party's convention in August and Dobson said he
foresees "a confrontation." The Christian Coalition's Ralph Reed added that "there will be opposition from members
of our organization." Pro-life Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) said he felt "blindsided" by Dole's comments and even
considered quitting his position as chairman of the party's platform committee, but did not resign, according to news

another state. Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) introduced a Senate bill that is similar but includes an amendment
that would outlaw discrimination against gays and lesbians in the workplace. President Clinton said he would sign

<B>An hour-long weekly news program covering religion and ethics is planned for public television next year</B>. Religion
and Ethics News Weekly "is unlike anything on television," said Tamara Robinson of public television station WNET

publications, and establish a World Wide Web site. Former NBC religion correspondent Bob Abernathy will host
the series, scheduled for an initial run of 39 weeks. The intent is to report "the most interesting and important stories
we can find each week. We value the importance and sensitivity of this area of people's lives," Abernathy said.

<B>The U.S</B>. Small Business Administration has rewritten its rules to make it clear that the manufacture, sale, or
provision of religious goods and services is not a deterrent to SBA loan guarantees (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/103095.html">NIRR 10/30/95</A>). The SBA
provides loan guarantees to some 7,000 banks that lend to small, for-profit businesses. At a news conference, SBA
Administrator Philip Lader cited examples of firms eligible for consideration of SBA loan guarantees. They include
a for-profit daycare center that begins the day with prayer and conducts an occasional Bible class; a firm that
produces religious software for computers; a Christian bookstore; and companies that manufacture religious artifacts,
news reports said. NIRR 6/24/96

<B>A Mississippi woman won her battle against prayers being said over the intercom and Bible classes at her children's
public school June 3 (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/050195.html">NIRR 5/1/95</A>)</B>. U.S. District Court Judge Neal Biggers, Jr., issued a permanent injunction
against the activities. Lisa Herdahl said her five children, who were baptized as Lutherans and attend a Pentecostal
Sunday school, were taunted for not participating in the activities at rural North Pontotoc Attendance Center in Ecru.
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution allows objective study of the Bible or religion as part of a
secular program of education, but North Pontotoc's classes were not objective, Biggers ruled. The school's religious
practices had continued for decades after a 1962 U.S. Supreme Court decision outlawed officially sanctioned school
prayer. NIRR 6/24/96

the schools, but listening to people who hold minority religious views gave him a different perspective. "I reach the
conclusion that it is better for us to reverently honor prayer as individuals, in our places of worship, in our homes,
and in our hearts," Chiles, a Democrat, said in his veto message. NIRR 6/24/96

<B>A mob of Muslims destroyed 10 church buildings and crippled a pastor in Surabaya, Indonesia</B>. The 1,000-strong
mob attacked during Sunday services June 9 and stoned and violently tore apart most of the churches, Baptist Press
reported. None of the churches were Baptist. At one church the mob stormed the sanctuary and dragged the pastor
from the platform, then began burning motorcycles and other vehicles outside. When police arrested several members
of the mob, they found a list of some 50 churches targeted for destruction in Surabaya. The government-controlled
media did not report the incidents, possibly to prevent further violence, BP said. Officials in the Christian division
of Indonesia's Religion Department said churches that don't have police protection should suspend meetings, but it
is unclear whether police protection has been offered at the local level. Government and Muslim leaders have been
working to counter the rapid spread of Christianity in the country (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/051396.html">NIRR 5/13</A>). NIRR 6/24/96

<B>Robert Hussein, a Kuwaiti Muslim who became a Christian, is guilty of apostasy and must be executed, an Islamic
court has ruled</B>. Any apostate "who is born of two Muslim parents...must be killed," the Shiite court said, adding that
his wife should be divorced from him and all his possessions distributed to his heirs. The religious court's ruling
violates Kuwaiti civil law, so any Muslim who kills Hussein could be guilty of a criminal offense, according to news
reports. But some may try anyway, Hussein believes. The sentence "gives anyone the green light to kill me on the
street."

he spoke publicly of his conversion to Christ (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/051396.html">NIRR 5/13</A>)</B>. No lawyer would defend him, and Hussein's request to
have the case tried in a Kuwaiti constitutional court was denied. The Kuwaiti constitution guarantees freedom of
religious belief. Hussein is in hiding and has 30 days to appeal the verdict. The Charlottesville, Va.-based Rutherford
Institute has asked U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to intervene on his behalf. NIRR 6/24/96

<B>Whatever the outcome of the June 30 Russian election runoff, missions organizations are expecting more restrictions
on foreign religious groups working in the country</B>. A resurgence of nationalism and the antipathy of the Russian
Orthodox Church is creating an atmosphere of intolerance, they say.
<BR><B>...At least 19 regional and city governments have laws that restrict missionary work, violating the Russian
Constitution's religious freedom provisions, the International Law Group's Lauren Homer told NIRR</B>. Some laws
are so restrictive that even Russian nationals not born in particular regions are considered foreigners and denied
permission to do religious work. Most ministries cannot afford to appeal their case to higher levels, so the laws
remain. 
<BR><B>...The Russian Orthodox Church increasingly is wielding its political clout to influence more such laws</B>. The 1,000
year-old church, a powerful force in Russian history, is a symbol of nationalist sentiments, and most political leaders
try to ingratiate themselves with its leaders, Homer said. "There has been a tremendous propaganda campaign from
the highest levels against foreign missionaries and for the Orthodox Church." 
<BR><B>...This month, Moscow Patriarch Aleksy II asked Parliament to ban the work of all foreign religious groups not
specifically invited by the ROC</B>. Earlier, he asked officials in the Komi Republic and Perm to strictly regulate foreign
religious organizations "that have nothing in common with Russia's Orthodox traditions," news reports said. In
Moscow, customs officials seized a shipment of Bibles bound for Pentecostal congregations, but released them after
discovering that they had been produced in cooperation with the Orthodox Church. 
<BR><B>..."We have always kept in mind that we are only there temporarily," said Russian Ministries Director Peter Deyneka</B>.
"We are there to prepare nationals to expand their ministries, train new leaders, and build an infrastructure so they
can survive and grow." The ministry has helped train more than 1,000 indigenous church planters in five years. Other
groups agree. "As long as people have been trained to witness, then the only ones who can muzzle the gospel are
the messengers," said Jews for Jesus Executive Director David Brickner. JFJ recently concluded a three-week
outreach in Russia, passing out more than 1 million tracts and converting 400 people to Christ. NIRR 6/24/96

<B>Messianic Jews and evangelicals in Israel are concerned about recent political gains by Orthodox Jewish religious
groups</B>. In the past, such groups have worked to restrict foreign-based evangelical ministries and to limit the rights
of Jews who profess faith in Christ, said Chosen People Ministries President Sam Nadler. The groups may pose "a
tremendous threat to Jewish believers in Israel," because their gains in recent elections made them an influential part
of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government, he said. 
<BR><B>...Messianic Jews fear Netanyahu will appoint an Orthodox party member as Minister of the Interior, the position
governing religious affairs, visas, and determining who is considered to be Jewish</B>. Orthodox parties have supported
laws stripping Messianic Jews of their Jewish identity, preventing them from returning to Israel, according to CPM.
"The Orthodox hate the Messianics here with a passion," said one Messianic Jew ministering in Israel. Orthodox in
the Interior Ministry tried to expel a number of Messianic families from the country several years ago (NIRR
1/15/90), he said. Evangelicals fear their ministries also will be hampered, since the Orthodox view evangelical
ministries with suspicion and may try to make it harder for them to get work visas, news reports said. NIRR 6/24/96

<B>"If God can forgive you, then I surely ought to be able to forgive someone who merely burned down the church,"
pastor Alfred Baldwin told his congregation at First Missionary Baptist Church in Enid, Okla., three days after their
sanctuary was destroyed by an arson fire</B>. An arsonist "did not burn down the church, he just burned down the
building," Baldwin said. 
<BR><B>...Mixed with calls for forgiveness were emotions of outrage and fear, and calls for justice</B>. "If we don't work
together, there is a very good chance we'll all be destroyed," said Myrlie Evers-Williams, national NAACP
chairwoman. Thirty-eight ministers of burned and vandalized black churches, together with the National Council of
Churches, went to Washington and accused investigators of focusing on church members and being reluctant to
consider race as a motivating factor. Federal agents said they weren't discounting any theories about the fires,
including ideas that they are a conspiracy against blacks or copycat crimes.
<BR><B>...President Clinton opened a toll-free hot line for tips (1-888-ATF-FIRE), supported legislation to make it easier to
prosecute church arsons, and created a new FBI supervisory job to focus solely on church arsons</B>. GOP presidential
candidate Bob Dole also decried the burnings.
<BR><B>...Ralph Reed, whose Christian Coalition is opposed by many black leaders because of its conservative politics,
pledged to raise $1 million to aid the burned churches</B>. The Coalition will ask more than 100,000 congregations to
take up a special collection July 14 to raise the money. Reed said on NBC's Meet The Press that white evangelicals
are seeking "repentance and reconciliation" because they have failed to embrace civil rights in the past. News reports
said some black leaders remain wary of Reed, wondering if he will try to push the Coalition's conservative agenda
if he wins acceptance in the black community.

a priest pours water over them, a news report said. Though the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) approved such
baptisms and later Church documents referred to them as the preferred way to baptize young people and adults, the
idea has been slow to take hold in some parishes. Priests in Los Angeles find that people like it once they see what

<B>Nearly 1,000 volunteers spent a weekend behind bars with 15,000 criminals in
a dozen prisons in the Huntsville, Texas, area last month</B>. The volunteers came
from 34 states and various walks of life, donating their time and paying all trip
expenses. They were organized by Bill Glass Ministries of Cedar Hill, Texas.
BGM also organized a large outreach this month in 18 prison yards in the
Fresno, Calif., area. Some 468 counselors ministered to 16,000 inmates during
the weekend there.
<BR><B>...The outreach weekends involve group and individual ministry</B>. Professional
athletes and entertainers talk about their faith, then the volunteer counselors visit
the inmates one-on-one in prison cafeterias, recreation areas, and some living
areas. In Huntsville, 3,727 inmates made decisions to become a Christian or to
recommit their lives to Christ, and in Fresno the number was 2,096, Christian
Henderson of Bill Glass Ministries told NIRR. Those who make commitments
to Christ are referred to the prison chaplain for an eight-week Bible study. Last
year, BGM went into 201 correctional institutions and held 21 similar but smaller
events, the ministry said.
<BR><B>...Glass, a former defensive end for the Cleveland Browns and a graduate of Fort
Worth's Southwestern Theological Seminary, has ministered in more than 1,000
prisons in 25 years</B>. The ministry operates on a $2.1 million budget, $1.8 million
of which goes to the prison efforts, the rest to youth events. The ministry's
spokesman is Jack "Murph the Surf" Murphy, who spent 21 years in prison for
stealing the J.P. Morgan gem collection that included the Star of India sapphire.
Executive director is Jim Lang, a former Air Force officer and real estate
developer who spent three years in prison for securities violations. NIRR 5/27/96

<B>Most Americans take grocery stores for granted -- but a supermarket opened
largely by Christians in one of the country's poorest inner-city neighborhoods has
been like manna from heaven, residents say</B>. Residents of the Central Ward area
in Newark, N.J., worked through a community development corporation to bring
a Pathmark supermarket to their neighborhood, an area deserted by major chains
after the 1967 riots. New Community Corporation, established and chaired by
William Linder, pastor of Newark's St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church, worked
for 10 years to cut red tape so the land could be cleared and dilapidated
buildings on the site torn down.
<BR><B>...New Community owns two-thirds of the store</B>. It funnels its share of the profits
from the 53,000-square-foot store, which grosses yearly sales of $21 million, into
community projects. New Community owns 18 housing developments in four
cities and runs an employment services center, credit union, nursing home,
job-training program, and child-care center. Upcoming ventures include a factory
for manufacturing low-income rental housing and a program to train young auto
mechanics.
<BR><B>...The supermarket reduced grocery bills by 38% as compared with high-priced
convenience stories, a study showed</B>. The Pathmark created 240 union jobs with
health benefits and potential for upward mobility in the chain.
<BR><B>...The Pathmark has become a community center for the 98,000 Central Ward
residents who live within its one-mile radius, Linder said</B>. "There was no place
where people could gather that was their own," he told NIRR. Some 50,000
people a week shop at the store or go there just to chat with friends, and "there
is a tremendous sense of community," said the priest, who almost daily strolls
through the store talking with people. 
<BR><B>...The Central Ward has had a "renaissance" of church construction in the last
three years, Linder said</B>. Churches are growing, almost every congregation in the
neighborhood has a capital improvement project, and several Baptist and African
Methodist Episcopal churches are considering starting schools. "There is a lot
more hope here, and a sense that there is a future," he said. NIRR 5/27/96
<P>
<B>Some 5,000 drug addicts are getting help through One Church-One Addict
(NIRR 3/21/94)</B>. The 2-year-old interfaith program, founded by Catholic priest
George Clements, mobilizes churches -- as well as some synagogues and
mosques -- to "adopt" one drug addict. "Drugs are no respecter of
denominations," Clements told NIRR. "I have yet to meet the first pusher who
wanted to know your religious identity before he sells you drugs."
<BR><B>...Each team of five or six volunteers functions as a support group for one addict</B>.
OCOA trains the volunteers, who then get involved with a recovering addict and
"stay involved over the long haul for as long as it takes," Clements said. The
volunteers help the addict find job training, psychological or spiritual counseling,
and referrals to professional treatment. Team members meet regularly with the
addict and make themselves available at all times for emergencies, particularly
if there are signs of relapse, Clements said. 
<BR><B>...One Church-One Addict has sponsored 30 "recovery revivals" during which
groups of churches hold a service for addicts and their families</B>. The services use
a crusade format -- including a choir, preacher, and altar call -- and emphasize
recovery from addiction, Clements said. More than 3,000 people attended one
such service in New Orleans in January 1995. Six of those attending "refused to
go home" and signed up on the spot to commit themselves to treatment centers,
he said. Other revivals have been held in Miami, Milwaukee, Chicago, and
Baltimore. One Church-One Addict is active or developing programs among
congregations in 31 states. NIRR 5/27/96
<P>
<B>Public schools need help from their communities, and Christians are beginning
to respond</B>. Church members are giving their prayers, friendship, and time to
public school children, teachers, and administrators through two programs
sponsored by the Christian Educators Association International. Volunteers in
Adopt A Teacher and Adopt A School pray for the schools. They also provide
assistance to teachers, coaches, principals, nurses, librarians, school board
members, and guidance counselors by doing anything from correcting spelling
tests to organizing the schools' tutoring programs. This provides assistance that
overworked teachers and staff are hard-pressed to give. 
<BR><B>...Involved Christians "earn the right to be heard and be an influence" in the
schools, where more than 90% of the country's students attend, CEAI Executive
Director Forrest Turpen told NIRR</B>. The 6,000-member group offers liability
insurance and various resources as alternatives to the more liberal National
Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers. CEAI is
planning a convention July 31-Aug. 4 in Memphis and a national consultation
next spring. For more information, contact the CEAI at (818) 798-1124. NIRR

<B>Christians in 170 nations participated in the annual March for Jesus May 25</B>. The
worldwide festival began in New Zealand and spread westward as nation after
nation began marches "following the sun around the globe," MFJ Americas
coordinator Tom Pelton told NIRR. As many as 100,000 marchers from 100
cities and towns in New Zealand were expected to participate, organizers said.
In America, more than 600 cities planned to hold marches with a total of 1
million participants, Pelton said. 
<BR><B>...Marches also were scheduled in Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Europe</B>. Tiny
island nations such as Malta, Sri Lanka, and Reunion, off the coast of
Madagascar, were holding marches, according to MFJ. In England, where the
first March for Jesus was held nine years ago, marchers in 45 cities released
balloons symbolizing the spread of the gospel. Each site released 233 balloons,
one for every nation in the world, Pelton said. In China and other countries
where marches could not be held, Christians were planning silent prayer walks.
Before the event, organizers predicted 10 million people would march. NIRR

<B>Some 125,000 people attended rallies, luncheons, and various other events
through the third week of May during Luis Palau's two-month Say Yes Chicago
evangelistic campaign (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/040196.html">NIRR 4/1</A>)</B>. Events included a gathering of 18,000 young
people and adults April 27 at the Rosemont Horizon. Some 1,000 people
attended parenting seminars conducted by youth evangelist Ron Hutchcraft, and
79 indicated they had prayed to commit their lives to Christ.
<BR><B>...Palau has been leading callers to profess faith in Christ during a nightly radio
call-in show he is hosting during the crusade</B>. One caller confessed she had an
abortion and made a profession of faith. Two days later, she came to a crusade
event along with six of her family members, who all made professions of faith
in Christ, campaign spokesman Jerry Vreeman said.
<BR><B>...There has been "phenomenal participation and mutual respect, love, and
support" among the city's ethnic church leaders during the crusade, Vreeman told
NIRR</B>. But it will take time before that unity "filters down" and Chicago's laity
begin working together in large numbers across racial lines, said Vreeman, noting
that attendance at some Say Yes Chicago events fell below expectations.
"Chicago is an apartheid town," he said. "We are struggling with all those
culturalisms in order to truly demonstrate the unity of the body of Christ." NIRR

<B>Twenty-six teen-age gang members in Costa Rica made professions of faith after
a minister preached to them</B>. Ronald Villalobos, a Christ For the Cities
missionary, confronted gang members after learning they had killed a man.
Although he could not locate the abandoned house where they lived, "God told
him where to find it," CFC's Paul Landry told NIRR. Villalobos and a colleague
befriended the boys, all under 14 years old, and eventually led them to Christ.
Of the 26 boys, 14 are "walking with the Lord," according to Landry.   
<BR><B>...Villalobos operates the Zoe Youth Project and Children's Home in San Jose
for homeless boys and girls</B>. More than 45,000 young people, mostly aged 8-13,
are involved in drugs and prostitution in San Jose. Villalobos builds relationships
with them by providing food and medical care. The street kids are encouraged
to visit a "drop-in center" for daily devotions, meals, and activities. Those who
respond move into the ministry's group home, where they receive Christian
teaching and discipline, until a Christian family adopts them. Some 45 Christian
churches participate in the project, and about 50 children have been placed with
families, Landry said. NIRR 5/27/96

<B>The last words of a Salvation Army officer are influencing hundreds of
thousands of people, according to news reports</B>. Major Tony Kistan was a victim
of the gunman who killed 35 in Port Arthur, Tasmania, last month. Kistan was
shot fatally after he jumped in front of his wife, Sarah, and as he lay dying, he
told her, "I'm going to be with the Lord." At a news conference, the words were
repeated to journalists who could not understand Kistan's assurance of salvation.
Members of the press corps reportedly were moved as his son Nesan, also a
Salvationist, explained his father's life and belief in salvation through Christ's
crucifixion and resurrection, according to the Australian Religious Press
Association. The story was carried throughout the Australian press and in South
Africa, where Kistan lived earlier. NIRR 5/27/96

<B>Church leaders praised the Billy Graham World Television Series (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/041596.html">NIRR 4/15</A>)</B>.
Among the responses: 
Starting Over, broadcast April 14, reportedly was the most-watched program in South Africa's history after
the inauguration of President Nelson Mandela.  
Five people at a television station in Mexico became Christians after the broad- cast. The program generated
more calls than any other in the past, officials said. 
At a maximum-security prison in Ukraine, 16 convicts became Christians through the show. "Eight times
I have been imprisoned for crimes, but now I have gained real freedom," a prisoner
said.  
In a city in Moldova, a local coordinator asked the mayor to arrange for several city districts to receive
uninterrupted electrical power during the broadcast; due to rationing, the power usually is cut off part of each day.
Seekers packed the local church after the program. 
Christians in Bosnia said the program's broadcast on the national network was a historic event and thanked
the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association.
<BR><B>...Because of the positive response, government officials and network executives
are asking the ministry to rebroadcast the program and translate it into more
languages, the BGEA said</B>. NIRR 5/27/96

<B>An Episcopal Church ruling opens the door for homosexual ordinations and
threatens to split the denomination further</B>. In a decision May 15, a church court
ruled 7-1 that Episcopal doctrine does not bar ordination of practicing
homosexuals. Until now, only married heterosexuals, celibate single
heterosexuals, and celibate homosexuals could be ordained.
<BR><B>...The ruling spares Bishop Walter Righter a heresy trial</B>. Righter ordained Barry
Stopfel as a deacon in 1990 even though he knew Stopfel was involved in a
long-term homosexual relationship. The court said Righter, 72, now retired, can
continue to perform priestly duties. Had he been tried and found guilty of heresy,
he would not have been allowed to perform priestly duties. The bishops, meeting
in the sanctuary of the Cathedral Church of St. John in Wilmington, Del., said
a heresy trial would be a poor way to resolve the issue of homosexual ordination.
They suggested the issue should be dealt with by the full membership, possibly
at its next general convention, scheduled for July 1997 in Philadelphia. Those
delegates might enact a canon, or law of the church, making it clear whether
noncelibate homosexuals could be ordained. 
<BR><B>...The bishops made no judgment about whether homosexual relationships are
moral or whether the church should ordain people in open homosexual
relationships, they said</B>. Instead, they decided the narrower issue of whether a
bishop "is restrained from ordaining persons living in a committed same-gender
sexual relationship," Delaware Bishop Cabell Tennis announced in the nearly full
church. 
<BR><B>...Righter said he hoped the decision meant there are "no outcasts" in the
Episcopal Church</B>. "We're making too much out of bedrooms. The question isn't
gay. It's what kind of relationship do they have. Is it monogamous?" Bishop
John Spong of Newark said the church should realize that gays "are not evil."
<BR><B>...Only Bishop Andrew Fairfield of North Dakota dissented in his vote, arguing
that the Bible forbids homosexual activity</B>. He read aloud from his opinion as
Stopfel and companion Will Stecke, who were sitting in the third row, shook
their heads in disapproval. "Currently it is popular to speculate that Jesus would
treat homosexual people in the same way he treated tax collectors and other
outcasts -- that he would go to their homes, identify with them," Fairfield said.
"This is probably so. But he would not bless their activity, just as he would not
bless the activity of [dishonest] tax collectors and others such as the woman
caught in adultery."
<BR><B>...Observers said the decision could lead additional members to leave the
denomination, which has dropped to 2.5 million from a high of 3.6 million in the
1960s</B>. The decision will result in "still more anarchy and conflict" in the
denomination, said Todd Wetzel, executive director of Episcopalians United,
which says it represents 25,000 conservative church members. Now that the
church "denies the sanctity of marriage, on what basis will it ask priests to honor
the sanctity of marriage?" Wetzel asked. The only major Christian church that
allows ordination of noncelibate homosexuals is the United Church of Christ.

<B>Nebraska Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz said the mass excommunication of members
of his diocese succeeded in "unmasking some people who previously had a very
questionable relationship with the Catholic Church</B>." The bishop said he won't
formally record who was included in the May 15 excommunication (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/040196.html">NIRR 4/1</A>)
or notify them individually. Bruskewitz, head of the conservative Lincoln
diocese, said he has no way of knowing if someone is heeding the ban on
receiving the sacraments, which will be left up to the person's conscience. An
unknown number of Catholics, possibly hundreds, were included in the bishop's
decree because they refused to give up membership in 12 groups that he deemed
"perilous to the Catholic faith." NIRR 5/27/96

<B>The Supreme Court's decision to strike down a Colorado state constitutional
amendment banning gay-rights laws (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/030695.html">NIRR 3/6/95</A>) does not necessarily pave the
way for other homosexual victories, news reports said</B>. Government still will be
able to make a case that some restrictions on homosexuals -- barring sodomy,
same-sex marriages, and homosexuals in the military -- serve a legitimate
governmental interest. The ruling also does not declare that homosexuals are a
separate, protected class, as are blacks.
<BR><B>...But the decision was the first Supreme Court ruling sympathetic to homosexual
rights</B>. It upholds laws in many communities that prohibit discrimination against
homosexuals. And it could slow a movement by groups to repeal those laws,
though opponents said they remain undaunted. "We'll redouble our efforts," said
Jim Woodall of Concerned Women for America.
<BR><B>...The Colorado measure, called Amendment 2, placed homosexuals "in a solitary
class" in violation of the U.S</B>. Constitution's equal protection guarantee, said
Justice Anthony Kennedy. He was joined in the 6-3 majority by Justices Stevens,
O'Connor, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer. Suzanne Goldberg of the Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund said the court had rejected "gay-bashing by
referendum."
<BR><B>...Petitions to place a referendum like Colorado's on the November ballot are
circulating in Idaho, Ore., and Washington</B>. Voters in Maine defeated a similar
proposal last year. City governments in Florida, Oregon, and Ohio have taken a
similar approach through local ordinances. Last year, a federal appeals court
upheld a Cincinnati ordinance that stripped homosexuals of civil rights
protections in a case that is on appeal to the Supreme Court.                       
<BR><B>...Justice Antonin Scalia scolded the court for "taking sides in the culture wars."
The ruling has "no foundation in American constitutional law, and barely
pretends to," he said, taking the unusual step of reading his dissent aloud in
court</B>. Justices Rehnquist and Thomas joined the dissent, saying the Colorado

<B>Catholics are outraged that jail officials secretly taped an inmate's confession to
a priest, saying the sacrament of reconciliation must remain private</B>. The priest,
Timothy Mockaitis, heard the confession of Conan Wayne Hale in the visiting
area of the Lane County, Oregon, jail April 22. Both men were unaware it was
being taped. Hale is a suspect in the shooting deaths of three teen-agers, and is
awaiting trial on related burglary and theft charges. Prison officials have not said
what is on the tape. Prosecutor Doug Harcleroad, who arranged the taping, said
his office is thinking about using the tape in court but also is considering the
archdiocese's request that it be destroyed. Harcleroad said it is the first time his
office tried to listen to such a conversation.
<BR><B>...At issue is whether the conversation is privileged</B>. Church law "forbids any
confessor to betray a penitent by any means for any reason whatsoever," Bishop
Kenneth Steiner said, denouncing the taping. Oregon law says conversations
between clergy and their followers are confidential, but another state law allows
taping of jail conversations except those between lawyer and client. NIRR

<B>The city of Edmond, Okla., cannot continue to display a Christian cross on its
official seal, the U.S</B>. Supreme Court said. Justices let stand a federal appeals
court ruling that said using the symbol is unlawful because the "average
observer" would perceive it as an endorsement of Christianity. The seal, in use
since 1965, is divided into quadrants containing a covered wagon, train and oil
well, the Old North Tower of the University of Central Oklahoma, and a cross,
which officials say represents the significance of early churches in Edmond. 
<BR><B>...The Supreme Court never has granted a full hearing to settle conflicting lower

endorsement of the veto (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/051396.html">NIRR 5/13</A>). "He has placed himself firmly on the side

<B>Federal legislation to outlaw homosexual marriage is being considered in the

marriages performed in another state. The law also would make gay and lesbian
couples ineligible for federal benefits such as Social Security.
<BR><B>...The legislation is legally sound and should be enacted promptly, Jay Sekulow

Fellowship of Mission Agencies, Maryknoll Brothers and Fathers, U.S. Catholic
Mission Association, and Wycliffe Bible Translators met with the staff of the
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. They represented more than 75% of all
missions work originating from the United States, said Richard Cizik of the
National Association of Evangelicals, who arranged the meeting. The

In some developing countries "many people believe there are CIA infiltrators

allowed to initiate contacts with religious workers and that missions groups could
not associate with the agency, even to receive help for the recovery of hostages,
Cizik said. They also signed a statement with other missions agencies calling for

blackmail and no to kidnapping," said Abderrahmane Fahmane. 
<P>
<B>Germany: A 25-member Methodist church in Wismar helped gather and
distribute $1 million worth of relief goods, medicine, agricultural supplies, and
religious materials for needy villages in Albania</B>. The church's pastor said he
wanted to begin helping the country in the early 1980s, but could not begin until
East Germany fell in 1989. The church hopes to send a permanent missionary. 
<P>
<B>Italy: Mobsters in Sicily tried to kill an outspoken parish priest by putting
tincture of iodine in the communion wine</B>. As he celebrated Mass, Don Vittorio
Casella, who has spoken out against criminal activity and Satan worship, became
suspicious of the wine's odor. He ordered it replaced and later sent it to the
police lab. In recent months, Casella's church and car have been damaged in
attacks and he has received many threatening phone calls, according to news
reports. 
<P>
<B>Russia: The Russian and Eastern Orthodox Churches have reconciled</B>. The
question of jurisdiction over Orthodox congregations in Estonia divided the
groups (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/041596.html">NIRR 4/15</A>). This month, they agreed to share jurisdiction and let
Orthodox believers decide which branch to join. Of the country's 45,000
Orthodox, 25,000 speak Russian and probably will remain in the ROC; the
Estonian speakers probably will join the Eastern branch, news reports said.
<P>
<B>Russia: Edwin Louis Cole held a series of meetings for men last month</B>. More
than 2,000 from across the Commonwealth of Independent States came to St.
Petersburg to learn biblical principles regarding their responsibilities to God, their
families, and their countries. A televised program, directed to mafia members,
said that "manhood and Christlikeness are synonymous," Cole's Christian Men's
Network reported. CMN ministers to men in 93 nations. 
<P>
<B>Wales: Individual membership in the Evangelical Alliance of Wales has
increased from 300 to 2000 since 1990</B>. About 75 churches and Christian
organizations also have joined EAW. Its activities include yearly conferences for
ministers and youth and translating the Bible into modern Welsh, the World
Evangelical Fellowship reported.
<P>
<B>Publisher's note: The next issue of National & International Religion Report will
be published June 24</B>. We will produce 22 issues of NIRR in volume 10. All
subscribers will receive the number of issues for which they paid.

<B>Christianity is gaining popularity in Indonesia</B>. The church has
grown at least 10% in five years, to almost 25% of the nearly
200 million population, said an Assemblies of God mission
executive, who did not want to be identified in print. The AG
has about 1,000 pastors in some 800 churches there, he said. 
<BR><B>...All Christian groups are growing, but Pentecostals and
charismatics are having particular success, a 10-year AG
missionary to the country told NIRR</B>. The Pentecostal Church of
Indonesia "has churches everywhere," he said. In five years, the
Pentecostal Holiness Church grew from one pastor and 10
members to more than 3,000 members in 31 churches. In
Surabaya, a charismatic denomina- tion is erecting a 25,000-seat
building. And in a Jakarta AG church, membership increased
from eight to 500 since 1989, the congregation gave $1 million
to missions work, and members started 30 churches.
<BR><B>...Pentecostals and charismatics are especially effective among
followers of "folk Islam," a mixture of Islamic beliefs, animism,
and spiritism, the AG executive said</B>. Their belief in spirits
"makes it easier for Pentecostals to reach them." Pentecostal and
charismatic churches are attracting mainline Protestants who find
a "spiritual reality" they had not known before, the missionary
said. 
<BR><B>...Evangelization has resulted in a backlash against Christian
ministries</B>. The government has reacted to Christian growth by
limiting visas for foreign religious workers and denying church
building permits. Since most Indonesians are Muslim, "President
Suharto is trying to make peace with the leaders to win
re-election," the AG official said. Churches in outlying areas
have been targets of mob violence and many have been burned
by Muslim radicals, he said. NIRR 5/13/96

<B>Unprecedented responses are resulting from Trans World Radio's
broadcasts into Africa, Asia, and Latin America, Senior
International Director William Mial told NIRR</B>. A 38-year
veteran with TWR, Mial has been involved in almost every
aspect of the ministry's development. 
<BR><B>...Broadcasts to India generate 75,000 information requests a
month, Mial said</B>. Six hours of programming are broadcast in 40
languages every day from a transmitter in Sri Lanka. About 500
workers, cooperating with churches, visit those who respond.
Usually the ministry steers converts into existing churches, but in
remote or underevangelized areas, TWR helps them start new
ones. About 300 such congregations have begun in 20 years,
Mial said.
<BR><B>...More than 300 churches have been started through TWR
broadcasts among the Macua people in Northern Mozambique,
who were formerly unreached and do not have the Bible in their
language</B>. Through broadcasts produced by Grand Rapids,
Mich.-based Word of Hope, "an incredible move of the Spirit"
had led thousands to Christ, Mial said.
<BR><B>...Several hundred young people in eight Latin American
countries became Christians through a new broadcast to the
region</B>. Via satellite, stations in 40 cities are receiving TWR
broadcasts that are linked directly to follow-up centers. "When
you combine radio with a foot soldier, it is the most effective
way to do ministry," Mial said. NIRR 5/13/96

<B>More than 100 prayer-walkers started out from Germany's
Cologne Cathedral last month on a three-year journey to the
Holy Land</B>. The Reconciliation Walk aims to express sorrow to
Muslims and Jews for Christians' crimes during the Crusades.
Muslims consider that era as "the great betrayal" and it is a
primary reason they are "alienated and suspicious of
Christianity," Youth With A Mission Europe Director and walk
organizer Lynn Green said.
<BR><B>...On the first leg of the trip, the walkers stopped at a Turkish
mosque and read an apology to the imam and 200 men and
boys</B>. "Whoever had this idea must have had a visit from God
Himself," the imam said. Some Muslims are beginning to
examine their sins against Christians and Jews, he told Green.
The imam promised to distribute the apology to 250 mosques in
Europe. More than a thousand Christians are to participate in
various legs of the march, which should reach Antioch, Turkey,
in June 1998 and Jerusalem in July 1999. The journey ends on
the 900th anniversary of the Crusaders' victory over Jerusalem.

<B>Hope For Europe is fostering partnerships to evangelize the
continent</B>. The networking organization is active in 30 countries
and involves scores of evangelical ministries. Much like the AD
2000 and Beyond movement, HFE coordinates national and
global evangelism. Cosponsored by the European Evangelical
Alliance and the Lausanne Europe Committee, HFE also
strategizes with AD 2000 and other networking groups, HFE's
Ron Kernahan told NIRR. 
<BR><B>...The group has no timetable for the complete evangelization of
Europe</B>. "We felt it best to work toward the emergence of
national strategies" rather than establish an overall goal, an HFE
report to AD 2000 said. HFE cosponsored church-planting
consultations in several European nations under the leadership of
Discipling A Whole Nation. It also helped promote and
coordinate the European Evangelical Association's week of
prayer, which involved hundreds of churches in at least 25
countries. HFE sponsors prayer conferences by the European
Prayer Link, and last year cosponsored a European Youth Forum
in Prague. NIRR 5/13/96

<B>The conversion and persecution of a Kuwaiti man has made
church leaders aware of other converted Muslims who kept their
faith private, according to the Compass Direct news service</B>.
After Hussein Qambar Ali (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/010896.html">NIRR 1/8</A>) publicized his conversion,
four Kuwaiti men, using false names, told a newspaper about
their conversion experiences. One journalist said he knows
several Kuwaitis from prominent families and others in
influential government positions who are Christians. A
businessman reported that he knows a number of men who have
converted in the last few years. "They have not announced
themselves, but...their families and friends are starting to ask
what has changed their lives," he said. 
<BR><B>...Kuwait is more tolerant of Christianity than other Persian Gulf
nations</B>. Public evangelism is forbidden, but Christians can meet
in public and are granted permits to build churches and import
literature. But Christian converts face social ostracism and
Islamic law has no penalty for killing an apostate. Ali is accused
of offending Islam by several lawyers, who want to have his
civil rights stripped. His case is scheduled to be heard May 29.

<B>"We are a society perched on the brink of self-destruction," Billy
Graham told 700 congressional, diplomatic, and religious leaders
in the U.S</B>. Capitol Rotunda May 2 as he and his wife, Ruth,
received the Congressional Gold Medal. Graham, 77, said earlier
recipients of the award, including George Washington, would not
recognize the society they sacrificed to establish. "We have
confused liberty with license -- and we are paying the awful
price." Mrs. Graham, 75, who is recovering from spinal
meningitis, was brought into the Rotunda in a wheelchair and
briefly stood beside her husband for the presentation ceremony.
Later, President Clinton was among those speaking at a
$500-a-plate dinner for the Grahams. The event was a
fund-raiser for the Ruth and Billy Graham Children's Health
Center at Memorial Mission Hospital in Asheville, N.C.
<BR><B>...Graham spoke as Americans gathered in churches, synagogues,
and other public assemblies for the National Day of Prayer
(<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/041596.html">NIRR 4/15</A>)</B>. There were more than 12,000 such assemblies in
all 50 states, according to the NDP's organizing committee. "The
problems we face are too overwhelming. They are problems of
the heart, and only God can change the heart," said NDP
Chairman Shirley Dobson, wife of Focus on the Family founder
James Dobson.
<BR><B>...While society deteriorates, the Christian church is "strangely
silent" and people are looking to "secular prophets," said Thomas
Wang, head of the AD 2000 & Beyond Movement</B>. Wang spoke
during the National Concert of Prayer, an annual three-hour,
interdenominational prayer meeting. The event was broadcast by
television and radio from suburban Washington, D.C., across
North America, Central America, and parts of South America;
the broadcast was translated simultaneously into Spanish. As the
Christian leaders prayed, hundreds of thousands of viewers in
churches and homes did the same. 
<BR><B>...God created America to be a "light to the nations," but, in
God's view, the United States has "prostituted" itself by
consuming the wealth that God intended to bless the world,
Avery Willis of the Southern Baptist Convention's Foreign
Mission Board said during the broadcast</B>. "I want My church
back. I want My people back. I want My country back," God is
saying, Willis said. "Repent or I will leave you desolate."
<BR><B>..."We've marginalized Christianity in this country," said Charles
Colson, founder of Prison Fellowship International</B>. He was
among evangelical, Catholic, and Jewish leaders who spoke and
prayed in the Cannon Office Building on Capitol Hill. Others
included Cardinal William Keeler of Baltimore, Rabbi Daniel
Lapin of Seattle, David Stevens of the Christian Medical &
Dental Society, and Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council.
<BR><B>...Many prayed for President Clinton, including pastor E.V</B>. Hill
at a May 1 prayer rally in Lafayette Park, across from the White
House. The president "is a human being. He is like one of us.
He has his own fears, strengths, and weaknesses," Hill said.
Clinton "is not capable of performing all that is expected of his
office" without God, he said. 
<BR><B>...There was a near-tragedy at Focus on the Family May 2 when
a gunman entered the ministry's administration building in
Colorado Springs and threatened to blow it up</B>. Kerry Dore, 43,
who reportedly has an extensive psychiatric history, entered the
lobby brandishing a handgun, took two men and two women as
hostages, ordered remaining employees to leave the building, and
threatened to detonate a bomb he said was strapped to his chest.
Dore released the hostages after 90 minutes, then surrendered
two-and-a-half hours later to a Colorado Springs SWAT team.
No one was injured and no bomb was found. Dore, a Denver
construction worker and father of four, had been angry with his
employer's worker's compensation settlement but blamed Focus
on the Family, police said. He was injured by a metal rod in
1992 while helping build the Focus headquarters, FOF
spokesperson Caia Mockaitis told NIRR.
<BR><B>..."I don't think there is any business, any ministry, any church
that is not under threat," James Dobson told Religion News
Service</B>. Focus on the Family, which has 200,000 visitors a year,
will continue to open its headquarters to public tours despite the
incident, he said. Dobson said he believed the gunman's peaceful
surrender was a direct answer to prayer. NIRR 5/13/96

<B>In a decision that affects churches and charities nationwide, the
8th District Court of Appeals in St</B>. Louis ruled May 6 that
donations to a church may not be confiscated by creditors of the
donor if he later goes bankrupt. Bankruptcy trustee Julia
Christians had demanded that Crystal Evangelical Free Church of
New Hope, Minn. (NIRR 10/3/94), return $13,450 in donations
by Bruce and Nancy Young during the year before they filed for
bankruptcy. The Youngs had operated an electrical contracting
business for a number of years until they faced the 1990
recession and health problems. Two lower courts had ruled
against the church and the Youngs, holding that the tithes were a
"fraudulent transfer," meaning nothing of value was received in
exchange for the money.
<BR><B>...At stake in the case was the autonomy of church funds, said
Steven McFarland, director of the Christian Legal Society's
Center for Law and Religious Freedom</B>. The court ruled that the
bankruptcy trustee's demand violated the Religious Freedom
Restoration Act because confiscating the church's offerings
would substantially burden the free exercise of religion. The
court also held that the trustee's interests in collecting all
available money for the Youngs' creditors was not sufficiently
important to outweigh their religious liberty. "RFRA is not a
toothless tiger after all," McFarland said. 
<BR><B>...If the church had lost, congregations and charities would have
to hold donations for a year or until they were sure that each
donor was solvent and not likely to go bankrupt within a year,
McFarland said</B>. Being forced to return large donations could
"shut down many charities, and running credit checks on your
major donors is not conducive to warm donor relations," he said.
The ruling "keeps the government's hand out of what rightfully
belongs to the church," Crystal Evangelical Free Church pastor
Stephen Goold said.                                         
<BR><B>...The ruling will "have an impact" on about two dozen similar
cases in the lower courts, said attorney Kenneth Corey-Edstrom,
who argued the case for the church</B>. Attorney Dick Thompson,
representing the creditors, is considering appealing the decision
to the U.S. Supreme Court, news reports said. NIRR 5/13/96

Christian musical groups and some two dozen speakers, who
urged people to maintain sexual purity, to forge strong family
ties, and to serve the church and country. Most speakers came
from charismatic or Pentecostal traditions, but fundamentalist
pastor Jerry Falwell also spoke. He began a mock trial, declaring

<B>Promise Keepers is planning a series of regional rallies for
pastors as follow-ups to its Atlanta clergy conference (NIRR
2/19)</B>. About six such rallies are planned for the fall of 1997,
although dates and locations are not finalized.
<BR><B>...Many pastors who experienced renewal during the conference
have been meeting regularly and formulating strategies for
revival in their cities, said PK's Dale Schlafer, who organized
the Atlanta event</B>. The regional rallies will build on the
enthusiasm and recommitment to the ministry generated in
Atlanta and allow pastors who did not attend to experience those
things. After PK's initial sponsorship of the regional rallies,
future meetings will be organized by pastors without direct PK
sponsorship, the group said. The goal is for pastors of various
denominations and races to befriend each other, hold concerts of
prayer together, and cooperate in ministry efforts. The
conferences will resemble a "sacred assembly" of the church,
involving "glorious worship," brokenness and repentance for
sins, and prayer for "the awakening of the lost," Schlafer said. A
12-minute video with highlights from the Atlanta conference is
being produced and will be sent to those who attended, PK said.

<B>Seminaries often fail to teach leadership skills, said George
Barna of the Barna Research Group</B>. Schools prepare seminarians
to teach and preach, but "set people up for failure by causing
them to believe that being a good teacher is the same as being a
good leader," he said. According to Barna's research, most
seminary graduates give their alma maters poor grades in areas
such as creating a ministry vision, managing people, and
fund-raising. He delivered his comments at a conference that
included Alban Institute founder and President Loren Mead. The
two prominent church consultants spoke April 29 at Eastern
Baptist Theological Seminary in Philadelphia.
<BR><B>...Most seminaries operate on an outdated paradigm of ministry
developed during an era when society was largely christianized
and the laity left the work of the ministry to professional clergy,
Mead said</B>. But today, ministry increasingly is understood as the
responsibility of the laity, he said. It is vital for seminaries to
reflect this trend, Mead and Barna said. Barna predicted that
other training institutions could be founded to compete with
seminaries by offering alternative services. Seminaries should
admit students in light of God's calling and the spiritual gift of
leadership, as well as good grades, Barna said. NIRR 5/13/96

<B>Some 175 representatives of Christian denominations and
parachurch groups met May 1 in Alexandria, Va., at a
conference on evangelism strategies sponsored by Mission
America (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/122595.html">NIRR 12/25/95</A>)</B>. The movement's goal is that, by the
year 2001, Christians will have prayed for everyone in the
country and shared the gospel with them in a way they were able
to understand. 
<BR><B>...Conference participants heard about Celebrate Jesus 2000, an
ambitious Southern Baptist strategy available to other ministries
and denominations</B>. The initiative includes praying, sharing the
gospel individually and in group settings, and helping new
Christians become disciples and evangelists. Sterling Huston,
North American director for the Billy Graham evangelistic
crusades, detailed the plan. He noted it would not succeed unless
local churches undertake it, because it is "not top-driven except
for materials and concepts." The SBC Home Mission Board is
planning to develop a manual to help churches and communities
participate in the program. The strategy can be adapted for
different cultural groups and can include various approaches to
witnessing. For information, call Mission America at (612)
853-1762. 
<BR><B>...Mission America also is planning for church leaders in 1,000
U.S</B>. communities to meet next March to develop cooperative
evangelism strategies. Such meetings would continue to grow
each year so that within four years leaders in 4,000 communities
would be participating, MA's John Quam said. 
<BR><B>...The church has wrongfully tolerated disunity, said Joseph
Stowell, president of Moody Bible Institute</B>. Christians often act
like "kids in the back seat on a long trip, bickering and picking."
Unity must not be simply "oneness for oneness' sake," but based
in Christ and centered on truth, Stowell said. "A few things are
more important than unity, and truth is one of them." NIRR

<B>Cincinnati-area conservative Christians are mobilizing to talk

members, who also plan to hold a prayer service at the park, will
wear white shirts in contrast to the red shirts of homosexuals.
The purpose is to "show them in a very nonconfrontational way
that Christians don't hate them," Jackson told NIRR. "If they're
not open to what we're saying, we don't want to be in their face
any more than we want them to be in our face." NIRR 5/13/96

About 50 churches, including Alliance, Armenian Evangelical,

<B>Coptic Christians in Egypt are purchasing many deserted
Orthodox and Catholic churches</B>. About 100 buildings were
abandoned by Eastern and Armenian Orthodox members and
Catholics who fled the oppressive regime of Gamel Abdel
Nasser in the 1950s. They remained empty until the 1980s, when
President Anwar Sadat decreed that Coptic churches could not be
built or repaired without presidential permission. Since such
requests are rarely granted, congregations are forced to worship
in dilapidated buildings or caves (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/042996.html">NIRR 4/29</A>). 
<BR><B>...Of some 100 abandoned churches, about 50 have been
purchased and the rest are up for sale, news reports said</B>. The
Copts like Eastern and Armenian Orthodox churches because the
altars face east, just as in Coptic churches. The Orthodox and
Catholic leadership sell the buildings at reasonable prices
because they don't want them used for secular purposes. NIRR

<B>Leaders of the United Methodist Church apologized to Cheyenne
and Arapaho tribes for the 1864 massacre of 200 Indians by a
lay preacher</B>. Meeting in Denver (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/042996.html">NIRR 4/29</A>), the church's
General Conference approved the so-called Sand Creek Apology
for the actions of Col. John Chivington. He led a cavalry unit in
the slaughter at the eastern Colorado encampment, whose
residents mostly were women and children. Although Chivington
was condemned by a congressional committee for having
"deliberately planned and executed a foul and dastardly
massacre," Coloradans and Methodists honored the so-called
Fighting Parson as a hero at his death in 1894. Sand Creek "is a
deep wound, even today," said Alvin Deer, an American Indian
pastor from Oklahoma. NIRR 5/13/96

<B>The Christian Coalition's Ralph Reed reiterated the group's
opposition to any substantial changes to the Republican Party's
pro-life platform</B>. Questions arose about the group's commitment
to the platform after the New York Times reported that Reed
reluctantly would agree to exceptions for rape and incest in a
constitutional amendment banning abortion. The Human Life
Amendment in the current platform makes an exception only if
the mother's life is at risk. The story "completely
misrepresented" the organization's position, the Christian
Coalition said. The Times later clarified the story, explaining
that Reed was referring to laws banning abortions, not the party
platform.
<BR><B>...Questions were raised anew after an excerpt from Reed's
forthcoming book appeared in Newsweek</B>. Saying that pro-lifers
don't have enough votes in Congress to pass a pro-life
amendment, Reed suggested new language for the platform.
While promising to use "all legal and constitutional" means to
protect the unborn, the proposed language makes no call for a
Human Life Amendment, news reports said. Reed said he was
expressing his personal views and not Christian Coalition policy.
He said the group will oppose "with every fiber in our being"
any effort to include a rape or incest exception or drop a call for
constitutional and legal remedies such as an amendment to the
Constitution. NIRR 5/13/96

<B>Some two dozen Protestant, Jewish, and Unitarian leaders
praised President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth abortion ban
(<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/042996.html">NIRR 4/29</A>)</B>. In response to the U.S. Catholic cardinals'
denunciation of the veto, the leaders said they hold human life
sacred, "yet we cannot respectfully agree" with the ban. Signers
included Edmond Browning of the Episcopal Church, James
Andrews of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Rabbi Alexander
Schindler of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, and
Paul Sherry of the United Church of Christ. 
<BR><B>...However, in a May 1 meeting with Clinton, Billy Graham told
the president he was wrong to veto the bill, news reports said</B>.
Graham, who has been criticized in the past for not speaking out
against abortion, has said his focus is on preaching, not politics.
In a departure from protocol, Clinton's ambassador to the
Vatican, Raymond Flynn, a Catholic, said he opposes the
president's veto. NIRR 5/13/96

<B>Liberal religious leaders gathered to propose an alternative to the
policies of the religious right</B>. "A growing number of American
Christians are feeling a fresh commitment to apply spiritual
values to vexing questions in our public life and, where
necessary, to offer an alternative to the Christian right," said Jim
Wallis of Sojourners. Attending the Summit on Ethics and
Meaning were numerous liberal and secular groups, as well as
Jewish editor Michael Lerner, and Catholic, Muslim, and Jewish
leaders. To contrast the Christian Coalition's Contract With the
American Family, the group offered the Progressive, Ethical
Covenant With American Families. The document calls for
protection of abortion rights, recognition of gay and lesbian
unions, a higher minimum wage, a reduced work week, and one
year of paid leave in special family circumstances. NIRR 5/13/96

<B>Students around the country were involved in a simultaneous
effort to share the gospel during two days last month</B>. Students
from 40 denominations and parachurch groups participated in 48
Hours, which spanned April 12-14. Its purpose was to seek out
nonbelievers rather than expect them to come to Christians, said
Dan Finley, who coordinates youth evangelism for the Southern
Baptist Convention. The emphasis of 48 Hours was to "go out
on the highways and byways and seek people out."
<BR><B>...Young people used creative ways to meet people</B>. In Roanoke,
Va., 11 youth took religious surveys downtown, did chalk
drawings, and handed out tracts. Youth in Liburn, Ga., ran a
three-day sports and religion camp with basketball and softball,
contacting 230 children. In Nashville, youth invited
non-Christian friends to sleepovers, then took them to church the
next day. A number of youth added their conversion stories to a
videotape containing testimonies by several contemporary
Christian musicians. NIRR 5/13/96

<B>North Korea's underground church has survived because it has
Bibles, a missionary to the country said</B>. By preserving and
copying Korean Bibles, the church ensured its existence after the
communist crackdown began in the 1950s, he said. The
communists make a diligent effort to round up and destroy
Bibles.
<BR><B>...A woman told the missionary how her third-grade class was
told to look secretly for Bibles at home and bring them to class</B>.
She brought in her mother's Bible and was praised before the
whole class, but never saw her mother again, she told the
missionary. One group of Christians showed him their
handwritten Bible. "It had been written in the dark and was
scribbled. It was horrible, but they had one," he said at a
conference sponsored by Bartlesville, Okla.-based Voice of the
Martyrs. The trip convinced him to begin smuggling Bibles into
the country and funding church leaders, the missionary said. Last
year, his organization brought 50,000 Bibles to the country and
supported 257 church leaders. NIRR 5/13/96

<B>The U.S</B>. Supreme Court refused to review a ruling that struck
down a South Dakota law requiring parental notification for girls
under 18 seeking abortions. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals voided the law because it included no opportunity for
"judicial bypass" in special cases, such as if the minor is able to
persuade a judge that an abortion is in her best interest.
<BR><B>...A federal judge temporarily blocked a Wisconsin law requiring
a waiting period</B>. It requires women to consult with a doctor in
person at least 24 hours before an abortion, except in certain
cases of rape and incest. Judge Barbara Crabb said the law
exposes doctors to great risk of penalty, without clearly
specifying what they can or cannot do. A hearing is scheduled
May 20 to consider a Planned Parenthood request for a
temporary injunction. Under the new law, doctors must discuss
abortion with their patients, giving women a booklet with
pictures of fetuses and providing oral and written information
about the procedure, risks, alternatives, and social service
programs. NIRR 5/13/96

<B>An abortion doctor is suing a Roman Catholic priest for $50
million, charging he endangered his life by saying it is justifiable
homicide to kill abortionists</B>. Bruce Lucero of Birmingham, Ala.,
said in a civil trial April 23 that statements by David Trosch
(NIRR 8/22/94) on two television programs, Geraldo and The
Shelly Stewart Show, are forcing him to spend $50 million on
security for his clinic and staff over the next 20 years. During
the Oct. 5, 1994, Geraldo show, Trosch described Lucero as a
"mass murderer" who "should be dead." Lucero also showed the
judge photos of his clinic and home that Trosch had published in
his organization's literature. Trosch has been removed from
church duties and heads Life Enterprises Unlimited, based in
Mobile, with a mailing list of about 1,000 people, the priest said.
<BR><B>...Lucero said he fears Trosch as well as those who have heard
the priest's positions</B>. Lucero's civil suit claims Trosch violated
the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances law. Under
questioning, Trosch repeated that it is acceptable to kill abortion
doctors. NIRR 5/13/96

and are demonstrating "timidity and cowardice" when it comes
to the Nation of Islam leader, he said in Urban Family magazine.
Too many black Christians are suffering from "theological and
biblical illiteracy" because their churches emphasize emotion
more than doctrine, leaving them vulnerable to the ideas of
Farrakhan, who often quotes Scripture. Some black ministers
practice a "new radicalism," placing racial loyalty above
"seeking and telling the truth," he said. Potter also said black
Christians are not doing enough to demonstrate the gospel
through good works.

<B>Transforming Congregations supports homosexuals who want to
leave the gay lifestyle</B>. An unofficial United Methodist ministry,
the group considers homosexuality a sin and believes God can
transform people involved in the lifestyle, United Methodist
News Service said. Robert Kuyper, pastor of Trinity UMC in
Bakersfield, Calif., founded the group. Referring to the parable
of the Prodigal Son, Kuyper said the church should choose to be
"the loving father" rather than "the condemning older brother"
toward homosexuals.

<B>Prayer evangelism is proving to be effective in California</B>. Last
year, Christians from 400 families in Yuba and Sutter counties
made commitments to introduce themselves to their neighbors,
ask if they needed prayer, and pray for them (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/072495.html">NIRR 7/24/95</A>).
They also flooded the area with neighborly help, giving food to
medical and police workers, doing landscaping, painting over
graffiti, donating clothing, and washing cars. As a result, church
attendance grew 26% since February 1995 at the congregations
reporting results of the efforts, said Greg Burnett of Harvest
Evangelism. The San Jose, Calif.-based group is testing prayer
evangelism in California after it was effective in Argentina.

<B>The church must help answer ethical questions about
biotechnologies, U.S</B>. Catholic bishops say. Scientists "cannot
shoulder the whole burden" of answering the inevitable questions
such technologies raise, the bishops said. Biotechnology is "an
important tool," but "many will suffer if wisdom and sound
morality do not guide" its use, the bishops warned in the
statement, Critical Decisions: Genetic Testing and Its
Implications. Questions regarding genetic testing include whether
a predisposition to a disease should be disclosed to prospective
insurance companies, employers, and spouses.

<B>Some 2,000 people from around the world attended the five-day
World Conference on Love, Life, and the Family in Cincinnati
April 10-14</B>. The convention is sponsored by Human Life
International, founded in 1981 by Benedictine monk Paul Marx,
a sociologist and the group's chairman. HLI said it is not an arm
of the Catholic Church, although its representatives said its
positions on issues are consistent with Catholic teachings. HLI
operates 84 branches in 56 countries, with 12 U.S. chapters.
Conference discussion topics included abortion, contraception,
euthanasia, infanticide, "Genetics: The New Auschwitz," and
pornography.

<B>A fledgling nationwide group is promoting a message similar to
that of Promise Keepers, but for Catholics</B>. St. Joseph Covenant
Keepers, which began about four years ago, has 2,000 newsletter
subscribers and has held several conferences in various states,
the Rocky Mountain News said. The two organizations share
convictions about creating strong families, but differ in their
understanding of how people come to Christ, said Troy Hinkels,
a 30-year-old director of religious education at St. Mary's parish
in Greeley, Colo. Hinkels and Steve Wood, a Catholic convert
and former Presbyterian minister from Florida, helped found
Covenant Keepers.

<B>Several Colorado state representatives walked out of the House
chamber in Denver May 6 to protest a morning prayer asking for
God's forgiveness for abortion and homosexuality, the Rocky
Mountain News said</B>. The prayer, by Rep. Mark Paschall
(R-Arvada), quoted a Bible passage honoring Jesus Christ, then
touched on other subjects (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/021996.html">NIRR 2/19</A>).
<BR><B>..."We have endorsed perversion and called it an alternative
lifestyle</B>. We have developed legal plunder into an art and called
it social justice. We have killed our unborn and called it
expedient, compassionate choice," said Paschall, who has
described himself as a nondenominational Christian. Morning
prayers ordinarily are given by ministers, but occasionally a
House member delivers the prayer, the newspaper said.

Russian-American University in Moscow (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/051595.html">NIRR 5/15/95</A>) so
students can learn business, medicine, and politics with a

board of directors and 10 U.S. colleges, Bernbaum developed a
curriculum and obtained resources for training students in
computer literacy, free-market and democratic values, English,
and biblical ethics, he told NIRR. "Our thrust is evangelical, but
we try very hard to be interdenominational." So far, the
university has offered only night and summer courses in
management training principles, English, and Christian
apologetics. The first full class will begin in the fall with 50
full-time students. The four-year school will offer the equivalent
of a bachelor's degree.

<B>A group of church leaders in China is trying to preach the gospel
all the way back to Jerusalem</B>. "It is a common goal, a loud and
clear proclamation," David Wang of Asian Outreach told NIRR.
He met with 42 leaders of a charismatic house-church
movement, representing 21 million believers in 11 provinces.
<BR><B>...No one is sure where the idea originated</B>. Short-term
missionary Neil Johnson said Chinese believers see it as their
mission to "complete the circle" of the gospel's westward spread
around the globe. "They feel it's their job to take the gospel
back to where it started." 
<BR><B>...China has a special place in last-days theology, according to
Sid Roth of Messianic Vision, a ministry to Chinese Jews (NIRR
12/11/95)</B>. A prophetic passage in Isaiah 49:12 refers to Jews
returning to Israel from the land of Sinim, which is China, Roth
contends. The country once had a thriving Jewish community
centered in the ancient city of Kaifeng, which had a population
of 20,000 Jews and was known as the Jerusalem of China, Roth
said.
<BR><B>...Chinese church planters are setting up "stepping-stone"
churches in countries along the ancient Silk Road trade route,
Wang said</B>. Two missionary teams have been sent to Tajikistan
and Uzbekistan. "They are the pioneers, the vanguard" in
planting churches along the path back to Jerusalem, he said. The
missionaries probably are ministering to the large numbers of
Chinese expatriates in those countries, said Ronald Yu of the
U.S. Center for World Mission.
<BR><B>...A Korean missionary is planning a prayer walk along the Silk
Road from Beijing to Jerusalem that will have 24 marchers, two
for each tribe of Israel</B>. Asian missionaries to China will make
the journey, but no Chinese will go because they would not be
issued passports, Johnson said. The walk's goal is to "open
spiritual doors" for Jews to return to Jerusalem.
<BR><B>...The walkers also will pray against "spiritual strongholds" in
cities they travel through and make contacts with underground
Christian leaders for future church-planting missions</B>. They will
travel by bus, boat, and foot from Beijing, to Xian, Lanzhou,
Urumqi, and the Asian republics. They will go from Kazakhstan,
to Uzbekistan, back through Kazakhstan, then across the Caspian
Sea to Azerbaijan, into Armenia, through Ankara, and to the
Turkish port of Mersin, where they will sail to Israel. The whole
prayer-walk journey should take three to four weeks, Johnson
said.
<BR><B>...Chinese Christians had tried to make the trip earlier this
century but failed, Johnson said</B>. In the 1930s, indigenous
missionaries trained by Hudson Taylor's China Inland Mission
planted churches from southeastern China to the far western
reaches of the country. They intended to press through into the
neighboring countries, but many died from the harshness of the
trip. Some who remember the mission trip still live in Urumqi.
"When they heard of what we have planned, they wept," Johnson
said. NIRR 4/29/96

<B>Christians in Japan have "a real hunger and thirst for the Holy
Spirit," Toronto pastor John Arnott said after his visit there this
month</B>. Harvest Fellowship, a Pentecostal/charismatic group,
invited Arnott to hold a series of meetings on the Toronto
Blessing, which began at his Toronto Airport Christian
Fellowship church in 1994 and has since spread around the
world (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/122595.html">NIRR 12/25/95</A>). Arnott said he did not expect such
powerful meetings in the largely Shinto-Buddhist country.
Instead, "I was amazed at how receptive the Japanese are" to the
Holy Spirit, he said. "They are so easy to minister to and God is
powerfully touching them." About 3,400 attended the five
meetings, and about twice that many were turned away because
the meeting hall would not hold them, Japanese Christian
publisher Yoshida Yashuda told NIRR. NIRR 4/29/96

<B>A Guatemalan church supports itself by running a coffee
plantation</B>. The pastor oversees the operation in Lampocoy a rich
coffee-growing region. The effort employs eight people and
brought in $300 last year. The church, located nearby, was
begun in 1989 by York, Pa.-based People for Missions, which
also raised money to buy the plantation. "It dawned on me that
this would be a great way to make the church self-supporting,
rather than dependent on income from the United States," People
for Missions' Colin Fullilove said. The ministry has planted 13
churches among hard-to-reach groups in the country's
mountainous regions since 1989. 
<BR><B>...Mission Coffee is sold in the United States, last year bringing
in $7,000, Fullilove told NIRR</B>. The gourmet coffee is sold in
specialty stores and Christian bookstores and by Christian school
students for fund-raisers. All proceeds from U.S. sales go to The
House of Hope, an orphanage the ministry is constructing in
Tapaca. It will be the largest orphanage in Guatemala, housing
up to 144 children in 12 houses on the 22-acre property. NIRR

<B>Grassroots peacemaking efforts may be the way to stop the civil
war in Sudan, Christians in the southern part of the country say</B>.
The 10-year war has created a volatile atmosphere among
villages, which often leads to violence. Church members are
trying to stop the trend by acting as "peace scouts" to mediate
conflicts between villages. The Christians hear complaints,
confront wrongdoers, and act as bridges between warring
villages, according to the Mennonite Brethren Herald.               
<BR><B>..."Later we will go to the [rebel] faction leaders" who have
fought among themselves, causing civilian casualties, said Peter
Lual of the Akobo Presbyterian Church</B>. Ultimately, the
Christians hope to play a role in seeking peace between the
north's Islamic forces and the south's Christian army, the
publication said. NIRR 4/29/96

<B>One thousand eighty-four people made first-time professions of
faith in Christ during Easter services at Saddleback Church in
Lake Forest, Calif</B>. Pastor Rick Warren preached at seven
services -- three on Saturday and four on Sunday -- and a youth
pastor preached a sunrise service. Some 104 out-of-town
relatives invited by their families made decisions to become
Christians, Warren told NIRR. Hundreds of others rededicated
their lives to Christ or decided to join the church or be baptized.
Attendance totaled 21,988.
<BR><B>...Warren's sermons described Jesus' trial, crucifixion, and
resurrection</B>. "Jesus is still on trial in the minds of many of you,"
he told the audience, saying he was turning the auditorium into a
courtroom, impaneling them as jurors and calling witnesses.
"And then you must come to a verdict."
<BR><B>...Saddleback members invited an estimated 8,500 non-Christians
to the services</B>. Warren had told congregation members not to
attend on Easter unless they brought at least one unchurched
person. It was Saddleback's first Easter in its own building,
which was recently constructed on a 74-acre campus. The church
was founded on Easter in 1980 and had used 89 different
facilities in five cities, including schools, country clubs,
warehouses, tents, and mental hospitals (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/101695.html">NIRR 10/16/95</A>). 
<BR><B>...Saddleback is a Southern Baptist church, although it dropped
the denominational label from its name several years ago</B>. Those
making decisions to become a Christian during the services do
not leave their seats and come to the altar, but instead turn in
cards indicating their decision. Baptism is considered the public
acknowledgment of a new believer's faith. Warren baptized
1,365 people in 1995, when the SBC named Saddleback its
church of the year. The congregation has grown in 16 years from
one family of seven members to nearly 12,000 attendees, making
it the fastest-growing SBC church in American history.
<BR><B>...The church is growing primarily by adding new Christians, not
by luring members from other congregations, Warren said</B>. Some
81% of the people who joined Saddleback in 1995 did so by
being baptized. Most people in the congregation are relatively
new believers: Warren baptized more than 75% of the current
members himself. They often are active in witnessing because
"they aren't afraid of nonbelievers." Generally, the longer a
believer has been a Christian, the fewer non-Christian friends he
or she has and "the less they think like an unbeliever," Warren
said. 
<BR><B>...Saddleback focuses on five basics -- what it describes as
getting warmer through fellowship, deeper through discipleship,
stronger through worship, broader through ministry, and larger
through evangelism</B>. Its statement of purpose balances those
areas so that no one thrust outweighs the others. The statement
calls for results that can be measured and evaluated, and Warren
leads a two-hour meeting each month to do so. Sunday-morning
services and a Wednesday-night class for new believers are
meant to be sensitive to the concerns of those who are seeking
God, and only contemporary music is played. "When God wants
[to nurture] baby Christians, he looks for the warmest incubator
He can find," said Warren, describing the seeker-sensitive model
the church follows. Warren leads new believers along a clearly
defined track of maturing through discipleship and training, and
commissioning for evangelism, he said. NIRR 4/29/96

<B>More than 750 New Englanders, many of them unchurched,
became Christians during a Christian film festival</B>. The annual
Merrimack Valley festival (NIRR 5/3/93), now in its fourth year,
was held free of charge March 31-April 7 at a Salem, N.H.,
cinema. Ten movies, rotated continuously, were shown from 11
a.m. to 9 p.m. They included features for adults, films for youth
and teenagers, and the Jesus film, which also was shown four
times in Spanish.
<BR><B>..."I have never seen so many people weeping" as during the
invitations given at the front of the stage after each show, said
organizer Thomas Saab</B>. He started the festival in 1993 and takes
off about three months from his Methuen, Mass., real estate
agency to plan each year's events. Attendance has dropped
somewhat over the years, but the number of professions of faith
has increased, he told NIRR. Saab gives some of the invitations,
during which he doesn't "pull any punches." He tells those who
come forward that they must "stop living the way of the world."
Saab tries to make sure that those who come forward understand
the seriousness of their decision, and urges people to return to
their seats if they are not ready to make a commitment to Christ.
<BR><B>...A group of Massachusetts junior-high public school students
came to the festival, and 45 came forward for salvation, Saab
said</B>. In another instance, a man became a Christian when his car
broke down near the cinema and he wandered in to watch a film;
the next day, he brought his wife, who became a Christian. The
leader of a Laotian youth gang also came forward.
<BR><B>...The new believers were referred to one of 80 churches where
"the gospel is preached," Saab said</B>. Nearly 2,000 people have
become Christians during the festival's four years, and many
others have come forward to rededicate their lives to Christ, as
some 300 did this year, Saab said. A total of 8,600 people
watched the movies this year. The 300 volunteers who help plan
the festival say the sacrifice of time, money, and effort is well
worth the effort, Saab said. "Nobody has been able to tell me
that there is anything more important than reaching the lost for
Christ." NIRR 4/29/96

<B>A year after a bomb shattered the Alfred P</B>. Murrah Federal
Building in Oklahoma City, Christian relief groups are among
those still at work (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/050195.html">NIRR 5/1/95</A>). The Salvation Army, Feed the
Children, Catholic Charities, and a coalition of area churches
called Interfaith Disaster Recovery continue to collaborate with
the American Red Cross to minister to people's physical,
emotional, and spiritual needs. The April 19 tragedy killed 168
people and injured more than 600.
<BR><B>...The Salvation Army, which sprang into action minutes after
the blast, has five full-time staff members and many volunteers
who are helping some 800 families affected by the tragedy</B>. One
victim, Nancy Fulmer, is receiving material aid as well as
counseling for "my continuing nightmares of the horrors I saw."
Fulmer, a nurse, was hit by falling debris as she worked at the
site. She is confined to a wheelchair and unable to work.
<BR><B>...The anniversary was traumatic for many of the survivors, their
families, and rescue workers</B>. It is "almost like going through it
again" for some people, Salvation Army Maj. Marshall Gesner
told NIRR. Reliving the experience may help in the long run, but
"in the short run it is very difficult," said Gesner, who helps
coordinate the efforts of relief agencies. Memorial anniversary
services were held at the site and the Myriad Convention Center.
The Army provided a free retreat at a recreational camp for
survivors and their families March 26-28. Various forms of
assistance for people will be needed for at least another year,
Gesner said. The Army has committed $3.5 million for
long-term projects such as helping downtown businesses rebuild
after major structural damage. 
<BR><B>...Meanwhile, militia proponents, conspiracy theorists, and
anti-government groups held a three-day convention in Waco,
Texas, to remember the deaths of David Koresh and his
followers</B>. The Branch Davidians, including 21 children, died in
a fire April 19, 1993 (NIRR 5/3/93). Voice of Liberty, a
Kentucky-based group that said it has a radio program that deals
with political issues and Christianity, organized the event.
<BR><B>...Koresh is considered to be a "latter-day Messiah," said Clive
Doyle, one of nine survivors of the fire and the unofficial leader
of three dozen Branch Davidians still in the Waco area</B>.
Authorities say the fire is one of the events that enraged and
motivated Oklahoma City bombing suspect Timothy McVeigh,
news reports said. NIRR 4/29/96

<B>United Methodists have decided that people should become full
members when they are baptized rather than waiting until they
are old enough to publicly profess their faith, usually about age
12</B>. The nearly 1,000 delegates to the denomination's General
Conference unanimously agreed to the policy change during their
meeting in Denver this month. The conference is the governing
body of the 8.6 million-member UMC, the nation's
second-largest Protestant denomination, and sets the church's
direction for the next four years (NIRR 6/1/92). 
<BR><B>...The new policy moves the UMC closer to its theological roots</B>.
John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, taught that in infant
baptism, a child is cleansed of original sin, initiated into a
covenant with God, and admitted into the church. The policy
also moves the UMC closer to Lutheran, Episcopal, and Catholic
churches and away from evangelical churches that require
individuals to make their own decisions to join the church.
<BR><B>...Delegates also voted to adopt a "covenanting proposal" of the
Consultation On Church Union (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/112795.html">NIRR 11/27/95</A>)</B>. With the
661-288 vote, the UMC becomes the sixth denomination to
approve COCU. The ecumenical document promotes closer ties
among mainline Protestant members including Methodists,
Presbyterians, and United Church of Christ members.
<BR><B>...Fifteen UMC bishops called on the denomination to allow
ordination of homosexuals to the ministry</B>. But they also pledged
not to ordain homosexuals unless the church law that declares
active homosexuality "incompatible with Christian teaching" is
changed. The current law bars self-avowed, practicing
homosexuals from the ranks of the clergy. The UMC's council
of bishops reaffirmed the church's traditional principles, but did
not denounce the bishops' protest, news reports said. 
<BR><B>...The UMC also voted 767-45 to explore unifying with
predominantly black Methodist denominations</B>. The Commission
of Pan-Methodist Union will formulate a plan with the
3.5-million member African Methodist Episcopal Church, the
1.2-million member African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church,
and the 720,000-member Christian Methodist Episcopal Church.
The plans will be submitted at the general conferences of three
of the churches in 2000 and at the CME conference in 2002.
"The time is right for us to openly confess sins of our past and
to realize these brothers and sisters belong in one church," UMC
Bishop Melvin Talbert said. NIRR 4/29/96

<B>Methodist leaders in England are seeking solutions to the
church's membership decline</B>. From 1992-1995 membership
dropped from 408,107 to 380,195, or 6.8%, and attendance at
services decreased 9.6%, Ecumenical News Service said.
Attendance by those under age 26 dropped by 19%. Out of 6,678
churches, 272 closed in the three-year span. The church is
surveying former members to determine their reasons for
leaving. The Methodist Church, the third-largest in England, is
discussing unifying with the largest, the Church of England.
<BR><B>...Even though overall membership is down, about 25% of
churches showed an increase</B>. The growing churches, which are
located in all areas of the country and have a variety of worship
styles, reportedly emphasize worship and have an ability to adapt
to meet members' needs, news reports said. NIRR 4/29/96

<B>St</B>. Matthew may have seen Jesus in person rather than
constructed an account of His actions much later, according to
German scholar Carsten Peter Thiede. He believes that three
fragments of papyruses containing snippets from Matthew 26 in
Greek, housed for more than 90 years at Oxford University, date
from 66 A.D. or earlier.
<BR><B>...His theory startled biblical scholars who have assumed that the
ragged-edged papyruses, known as the Magdalen Papyrus, were
written in the mid to late-2nd century</B>. Handwriting on the
fragments is in a style known as uncial, which began to die out
in the middle of the 1st century, Thiede said. The fragments are
from a codex, in which writing is found on both sides of the
papyrus. Contrary to the views of most biblical scholars, Thiede
says, codices were widely used by 1st-century Christians. Thiede
has published his arguments in the recent book Eyewitness to
Jesus (Doubleday). NIRR 4/29/96

<B>Landlords can't use their religious beliefs as a reason not to rent
to unmarried couples, the California Supreme Court ruled</B>. The
case involved Chico landlady Evelyn Smith, a Presbyterian, who
refused to rent to unmarried couples out of fear that God would
judge her (NIRR 9/25/89). In 1987, she refused to rent to Gail
Randall and Kenneth Phillips. The couple filed a complaint with
the state's Department of Fair Employment and Housing. It ruled
that Smith violated California's open-housing law prohibiting
landlords from asking prospective tenants their marital status. A
state appeals court overturned the ruling, finding that the
Religious Freedom Restoration Act supersedes state
open-housing laws.
<BR><B>...But in its ruling, the California Supreme Court said the state's
ban on housing discrimination based on marital status did not
create a "substantial burden" on the property owner's freedom of
religion, news reports said</B>. The court also found that Smith
could get out of the rental business if her morals did not enable
her to comply with state law. Smith said the ruling will not deter
her from refusing to rent to unmarried couples. "I'm going to do
it my way because it's the Lord's way," she said. Her attorney,
Jordan Lorence, said he would ask the U.S. Supreme Court to
review the issue, which has divided state courts around the
country. NIRR 4/29/96

<B>Dramatizing the entire Bible on videotape is the goal of Cape
Town, South Africa-based Visual Entertainment</B>. The Gospel of
Matthew and Acts are the first in the series, The Visual Bible.
By 2010, the company hopes to create word-for-word dramatic
reproductions of all 66 books, news reports said. The series is
designed for a video generation that would rather watch a story
than read it, executive David Seibert said. "It's kind of like
Gutenberg when he came out with the Bible in print. This is a
new generation where we have it on video." Actors such as
Richard Kiley, Dean Jones, Jennifer O'Neill, and James Brolin
appear in the four-hour films Matthew and Acts. Producers
started with those books because the stories are easy to tell on
video; books such as Leviticus and Deuteronomy, with their
detailed descriptions of Hebrew laws, will be harder to make
interesting, Seibert said. NIRR 4/29/96

<B>Teen-agers use computer know-how to enhance worship services
at First Baptist Church in Bethalto, Ill</B>. They operate a $10,000
computer-operated audio-visual system that displays sermon
outlines, Scripture passages, videos, and music lyrics to the
congregation. Using Microsoft's PowerPoint Software, they are
responsible for displaying the right images at the right time,
according to Baptist Press. As pastor Charles West preaches, his
key points are displayed on the video screen. During worship,
lyrics are shown "so people aren't buried in the hymnbook,"
West said. The "very simple" system allows 14-year-old Adam
Edelen to "put my talents to use" for God, he said. The teens
take turns programming and displaying the material. Giving them
so much responsibility requires trust, because West can't see the
display behind him, he said. NIRR 4/29/96

<B>Macedonian evangelicals are fighting for religious freedom</B>. The
country is a democracy, but laws restricting religious freedom
still exist from its communist era. Protestant and Orthodox
churches can't register with the government, which prevents
them from legally renting buildings or employing ministers or
priests. Since the clergy are not officially employed, they cannot
receive government-supplied health and retirement benefits,
Macedonian believers told NIRR. 
<BR><B>...Sometimes laws are enforced selectively against evangelicals
by officials sympathetic to the Orthodox Church</B>. The
evangelicals are denied outside humanitarian aid, can't import
Bibles, and have had their evangelistic meetings closed (NIRR
12/25/95). Evangelical leaders have been told there is a new law
guaranteeing religious freedom, but it hasn't been enacted. They
are asking Christians worldwide to write to the Macedonian
government on their behalf. The address for the Ministry of
Justice is: Do, Ministerstvo za Pravda na, Republika Makedonija,

<B>Jews for Jesus is one of four Jewish groups to receive bomb
threats in Buenos Aires, Argentina</B>. A worker found a threatening
note on the office door, and moments later a caller said the
office would be blown up. Argentine police are taking the threats
seriously because two Jewish schools and a synagogue in the
same neighborhood also were threatened. "Ironically, we have
been accused by Jewish counter-missionary groups of forsaking
our Jewish identity, yet anti-Jewish groups have no problem
recognizing who we are," JFJ Argentine Director Guillermo Katz
said. JFJ offices are under 24-hour police protection, but the
workers said they will continue their ministries of street
evangelism and Bible study. A 1994 bombing attack on a Jewish
community center in Buenos Aires killed almost 100 people.
Intelligence agents said the recent threats may be due to the
Israeli-Hezbollah conflict, JFJ said. NIRR 4/29/96

<B>Most American missionaries have been evacuated from Liberia</B>.
Missions and relief agencies, including the Southern Baptists, the
Assemblies of God, the United Methodist Church, World Relief,
and World Vision, removed expatriate staff members from the
country. Looting and killing are commonplace in the fighting
between rival government factions. World Relief, World Vision,
and the SBC report their compounds were ransacked and
vehicles were stolen. 
<BR><B>...World Relief's Brian Johnson endured "the worst night of my
life" when armed rebels assaulted him and his family numerous
times</B>. He and 70 other U.S. citizens were given an armed escort
to an evacuation area, where their helicopter was fired on as it
lifted off. Southern Baptist missionaries rushed out the back gate
of their compound as armed men stormed through the front. The
convoy sped through the streets of Monrovia at up to 90 miles
per hour, sometimes encountering sniper fire, as it fled to a
secured airfield. World Relief and World Vision workers plan to
return once the situation stabilizes. Liberian nationals will
continue their programs in the meantime, the organizations told

<B>"I do not hate people because their skin is white," Nation of
Islam leader Louis Farrakhan told followers April 15</B>. "What I
hate is evil and injustice and exploitation, whether a black does
it, whether a white does it, whether a Jew, a Muslim, or a
Christian does it." During a two-hour speech to followers at his
Chicago mosque, he said he is willing to speak in a synagogue
"because I do not want Jewish children to believe that they have
somebody who, if he comes into great power, will put them in
ovens," referring to the Holocaust.
<BR><B>...Farrakhan has made similar overtures before</B>. Several Jewish
leaders said Farrakhan has refused their requests to soften his
rhetoric and retract past offensive statements, including
comments that Jews are "bloodsuckers." When national attention
focuses on Farrakhan, he tries to put on some facade of good
will, but "that is so transparently false that it cannot be
accepted," said Phil Baum, executive director of the American
Jewish Congress.
<BR><B>...Farrakhan told followers that he went to Iraq, Iran, and Libya
"so America could not isolate us," news reports said</B>. He told
CBS' 60 Minutes that the U.S. government is trying to "muzzle"
him, and rejected the idea of registering as a foreign agent. U.S.
officials repeatedly have criticized Farrakhan's travels to the
nations and are looking into possible violations of federal law
during the tour (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/021996.html">NIRR 2/19</A>). 
<BR><B>...Farrakhan also claims he may be part Jewish</B>. In an interview
in the New Yorker, he said he thinks his father's ancestors were
Portuguese Jews. He was born Louis Eugene Walcott, the son of
immigrants from Barbados and Jamaica, and his father was
light-skinned and had straight hair. Farrakhan's mother told him
that his father's father was a white Portuguese. Harvard
sociologist Orlando Patterson told the New Yorker that nearly all
persons of Iberian origin in Barbados and Jamaica are of
Sephardic Jewish ancestry. NIRR 4/29/96

<B>The evangelical church is slipping into heresy, a group of 80
Baptist, Congregational, Lutheran, and Reformed theologians,
pastors, and parachurch leaders warned</B>. Many Protestants, once
anchored by Reformation principles, now are adrift in error,
according to their statement, The Cambridge Declaration.
Delegates signed the document April 20 in Cambridge, Mass.,
during a four-day meeting hosted by The Alliance of Confessing
Evangelicals (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/040196.html">NIRR 4/1</A>). "As evangelicals, we call ourselves to
repent of this sin," the statement reads. 
<BR><B>...Evangelicals must "recover the historic Christian faith," the
declaration says</B>. Its signers asserted that Scripture is the
sufficient authority for church life, that faith alone in Christ
saves people, and that God's grace is freely given, not earned.
Many evangelicals assent to Reformation principles but have not
practiced them, substituting techniques that excite people but
blur the gospel message, the signers said. It's not hard to gather
a crowd if you're running a circus, "but we've run a circus and
still lost the crowd," said W. Robert Godfrey, president of
Westminster Theological Seminary in Escondido, Calif.
<BR><B>...One repercussion is that the church is weakening, the signers
said</B>. "Earlier in this century, evangelical churches sustained a
remarkable missionary endeavor and built many religious
institutions to serve the cause of biblical truth and Christ's
kingdom," their statement says. But today, the evangelical world
is losing its "missionary zeal," it adds.
<BR><B>...Evangelicalism has turned into a "fearful and cowardly
church," said Robert Norris, senior pastor of Fourth Presbyterian
Church in Bethesda, Md</B>. "At the very moment when the culture
is so vulnerable, the evangelical church is losing its nerve," said
David Wells, a professor at Gordon-Conwell Theological
Seminary in South Hamilton, Mass. 
<BR><B>...Another consequence is that evangelical unity is vanishing, the
leaders said</B>. Beliefs that once formed "a bond of unity between
Christians from a wide diversity of church traditions" are no
longer commonly held, the declaration stated. "We face the peril
of losing the unity it has taken centuries to achieve," it added.
But the signers said they could not join with those who accede
to what they consider aberrant doctrine. The word evangelical
has "died the death of a thousand qualifications," author R. C.
Sproul told NIRR. "It has become so inclusive as to be in danger
of being totally empty."
<BR><B>...Rather than confronting the hard truths of Scripture, some
churches apply "therapeutic technique," signers said</B>. Yet
Scripture "must take us beyond our perceived needs to our real
needs." Often, Christians do not reason thoroughly, instead
allowing their hearts to guide their conduct, speakers said. Yet
"my heart is the problem. My heart has committed sins that my
hands haven't gotten around to yet," according to Michael
Horton, president of Christians United for Reformation.
<BR><B>...Trends in the church amount to "the dumbing-down of
Christianity," said David Scaer, professor at Concordia
Theological Seminary in Fort Wayne, Ind</B>. Christian apologist
Ravi Zacharias, who often speaks on secular college campuses,
said that many students he meets don't know how to think
clearly, making them gullible to lies.
<BR><B>...Although "angry and inconclusive discourse is today's style,"
Christians must speak with civility and act with love, said Ervin
Duggan, a Christian layman who is president and chief executive
officer of the Public Broadcasting Service</B>. Christians must not
be "coercive or arrogant," he said. "Could it be that our attitude
provides a barrier that makes outreach very unlikely?" asked
former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. Evangelicals should
develop a "new collegial rapport with academia," an approach
that is "winsome," not confrontational. 
<BR><B>...The future of evangelicalism and Western culture remain
unclear, participants said</B>. "Civilizations do die, and they are
overcome," Wells said. It is possible that "our fabric has so
rotted" that society will disintegrate, he said. Relativism "must
give way to nihilism," said R. Albert Mohler, Jr., president of
Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky. Yet,
Koop said, Christians should not despair. "God is sovereign."

<B>For the first time, the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter Day Saints ordained a president not descended from
Mormon leader Joseph Smith</B>. W. Grant McMurray, 48, was
ordained April 15 as the 245,000-member church's
president-prophet. Wallace B. Smith designated McMurray as his
successor to broaden the base of potential church leaders. The
RLDS, a 136-year-old church based in Independence, Mo., is the
second-largest of dozens of Mormon groups that trace their
identity to Joseph Smith, Jr. McMurray's selection was seen as
an attempt by RLDS leaders to move toward mainstream
Protestantism.

<B>Dallas televangelist W.V</B>. Grant, Jr., admitted filing a false
income tax return for 1990, news reports said (NIRR 12/16/91).
U.S. Attorney Paul Coggins said Grant, pastor of The Church of
Compassion, formerly known as Eagle's Nest Family Church,
pleaded guilty to one count of willfully filing a false tax return.
His wife, Brenda, pleaded guilty to knowing about the crime and
not reporting it. Sentencing is set for June 24.
<BR><B>...The charges stem from Grant's use of $75,000 from church
operations to pay for his personal residence and another
investment property, and his failure to report it as income on his
1990 tax return, Coggins said</B>. "We're not saying he was
embezzling from the church. He's being prosecuted for not
paying his taxes," said Assistant U.S. Attorney Phillip Umphres.
In addition, the Grants agreed to pay $353,000 in back taxes,
interest, and penalties that were not part of the criminal case
against them. Grant has said he "ceded" the church's 28-acre site
and broadcast and print facilities to West Virginia evangelist
Bishop T.D. Jakes, news reports said.

<B>Timothy Leary, 75, may be planning a public suicide on the

Leary, who lives in Beverly Hills, Calif., has been "actively
exploring" the idea. "I told him, `Tim, this is your best act so
far,'" said Ken Kesey, the '60s author and friend of Leary. "He
said, `Yeah, but what do I do for an encore?'"
<BR><B>...Leary has been promoting "hi-tech designer dying" on his

Americans use the Internet, many are getting on the World Wide

Leary's video.

perform 130,000 abortions a year, about 10% of the national
total. Feldt was married at 15 and had three children by the age
of 20. She called on the group to renew its fight for abortion

than she had as a teen-ager.
<P>
<B>Diana Garland, former dean of the Carver School of Church
Social Work at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in
Louisville, Ky., resigned from the seminary's faculty, saying the
school can no longer offer quality instruction in social work</B>.
SBTS President R. Albert Mohler, Jr., removed Garland, 45,
from her post as dean in March 1995 after she disagreed with
him about the hiring of a prospective faculty member, David
Sherwood of Gordon College, who supported women's
ordination. Garland had criticized Mohler, who opposes women
serving as senior ministers, for evaluating faculty using
"absolutely restrictive" criteria. Trustees have voted to close the
Carver School in May 1997 and transfer it to Campbellsville
College, a Kentucky Baptist Convention-supported school.

several weeks creatively investing the money and returned
$69,043, a net gain of $51,463, news reports said. A 14-year-old
boy turned his $10 into $80 by selling candy bars at school, a
woman used her family's four $10 bills to make aprons, selling
them for $250, and a 38-member Sunday school class pooled its
money to make tapes featuring the church's soloists, selling them
for almost $2,000. The money will reduce the church's $14.6
million debt (NIRR 1/1/90).

<B>President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth abortion ban (NIRR
3/18) moves the United States "one step closer to infanticide,"
the country's eight Catholic cardinals and the leader of the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops said</B>. Richard Land of
the Southern Baptist's Christian Life Commission questioned the
president's assertion that he vetoed the bill because it failed to
protect women's health. He quoted testimony by Pamela Smith,
director of medical education for the Department of Obstetrics
and Gynecology at Chicago's Mount Sinai Hospital, that
"absolutely no obstetrical situations" in this country require a
partially delivered fetus to be killed to preserve the health of the
mother.

<B>Hands for Christ donates Christian libraries to churches around
the world</B>. Each month, the ministry ships thousands of books,
audiotapes, videotapes, and tracts on Christian teaching. Some
8,500 churches and prisons in 93 countries have received the
materials in 28 years. The Roanoke, Va.-based ministry has sent
2,000 libraries to churches in the Commonwealth of Independent
States since 1994. For each library, Hands for Christ paid for the
printing of about 100 Russian-translated books by Christian
leaders such as Billy Graham, Josh McDowell, and Bill Bright.
U.S. churches, individuals, Christian publishers, and ministries
donate many of the materials. Topics range from Christian
classics to contemporary issues in Christian life, HFC founder
Bob Bowers said.

<B>Global evangelization plans fail because of poor planning and
leadership, and "empire building," according to the Global
Evangelization Movement</B>. GEM President David Barrett and
James Reapsome of World Pulse newsletter researched and
evaluated such plans implemented since AD 30 for their book,
700 Global Plans to Evangelize the World, GEM's Justin Long
told NIRR. A critical failing has been lack of cooperation and
communication among leaders. Some 14 denominations and
church movements declared global evangelism goals in 1990, yet
most did not network with others, Long said. But the AD 2000
and Beyond Movement, Campus Crusade's Jesus Film Project,
and Every Home for Christ have set examples of how to work
together, he said.

<B>As many as 2.5 billion people saw the Billy Graham World Television Series this month, the
Billy Graham Evangelistic Association said</B>. The gospel message was aired in more than 200
countries, most on prime-time television. 
<BR><B>...The April 14 Starting Over program took the gospel to more people on a single day than
possibly any other day in history, the BGEA's Bob Williams said</B>. National networks in about
120 countries, including 250 markets in the United States, aired it in prime time, and satellites
beamed it to 45 nations in Asia and Europe. Other countries saw the show on various days
this month. 
<BR><B>...Congregants from more than 1 million churches worldwide were to host house parties so
friends and relatives could view the event</B>. A training program called Operation Matthew
encouraged Christians to invite others to watch the program and discuss the message. An
average of 19 homes per church were to have had parties with three to 30 guests.  
<BR><B>...In South Africa, 50,000 home cell groups were planning parties, David Molapo, the
BGEA's committee chairman there, told NIRR</B>. The event brought the country's ministers
together, he said. Some 467 religious groups of all races, political parties, and denominations
were cooperating. "It is a blessing that men and women of God are forgetting our differences
and coming together to promote the gospel," he said. Youth for Christ and Every Home for
Christ planned to videotape the program and travel to rural villages with a TV, VCR, and
generator, Molapo said. Others intended to make audio tapes of the show and ask bus and
taxi services to have them played on regular routes.
<BR><B>...Other countries also made effective use of the program</B>. A Nicaraguan pastor's wife
convinced a school to have its 2,000 students prepare a report on the program, said Edwin
Martinez, a missionary to Latin America cooperating with the BGEA. In Cochabamba,
Bolivia, Christian radio and TV stations aired daily shows promoting personal evangelism. In
Costa Rica, 5,000 homes enlisted in Operation Matthew; in Mexico, 10,000 churches
participated; and in Argentina 17 church councils coordinated efforts. In Angola, a Christian
broadcasting company aired discipleship-training programs prior to the event. In Moldova,
100 churches cooperated to reach their communities.
<BR><B>...Foreign television network executives jumped at the opportunity to air Starting Over
because of its appeal to young people and extensive translation, Williams said</B>. Most
international programs are translated into eight or 10 languages, but the Graham broadcast
was translated into 48, allowing more people to watch. Excited at the prospect of the wider
prime-time audience, some executives planned to show it more than once.
<BR><B>...The program was different from anything the BGEA has done</B>. Unlike a typical crusade
broadcast, the one-hour program used strong visual images, drama, and music to emphasize
Graham's message. "MTV-style" visual techniques, such as switching between color and
black-and-white images and rapidly shifting scenes, were meant to reflect people's desperate
search for happiness. "It is designed to hit you right between your eyes," Williams said. The
program was intended for the cynical who would never attend a Billy Graham crusade. One
video editor became a Christian after viewing hours of the tape because he identified with a
character who was successful but felt something missing in his life. "I realized that I am
existing, not really living," he told Williams. 
<BR><B>...The World Television Series also included the BGEA WorldWide Pictures films Cry from
the Mountain and Power Play, which were aired in most of the countries prior to April 14</B>.
The series was scheduled for Eastertime because some countries will air Christian material
only during a holiday season, according to Williams.
<BR><B>...Graham is "willing to take risks for the gospel and won't rest on his laurels," Williams said</B>.
The satellite ministry allowed the 77-year-old evangelist to keep having an impact without the
physical drain of a crusade, he said. NIRR 4/15/96

<B>A Bhutanese evangelist said a warning from God led to his release from prison and the start
of a new church</B>. "Brother Phillip" was falsely accused of murder after a young child fell into
a river and drowned while watching him baptize new Christians, Asian Outreach's David
Wang told NIRR. The 23-year-old was kept in a small cell and shackled to an iron ball for 14
months as he awaited trial. One day, while staring at a dry river bed from his cell, Phillip
said, God told him to leave the prison. He requested and was given a transfer to a nearby
hospital, and that night a dam broke, flooding the jail and killing 100 prisoners. When he told
his story to prison authorities, they immediately released him, said Wang, who recently
returned from Bhutan. Phillip then began a church that has grown to 800 members in five
months. There are about 1,500 Christians in house churches across the country, Wang said. 
<BR><B>...The traditionally Buddhist country is easing restrictions on Christian worship and
evangelism, Wang said</B>. Bhutan, in the eastern Himalayas, has strictly forbidden evangelism,
proselytism, and worship for a thousand years. But the country's new king was educated by
Anglican and Catholic missionaries in India and believes that a stronger Christian influence
will help society. Bhutan's first Catholic priest, the king's cousin, was ordained in January.

<B>The Kwasizabantu Mission of South Africa "is as close to heaven you can find on Earth</B>."
About 1,200 tribal people live at the complex, where they receive Christian teaching and learn
farming techniques, Bill Bathman of Arizona-based In Touch Mission International said. The
mission, located outside Durban, includes a school, radio station, and conference center that
attracts ministers and other Christian workers. Last month, the Kwasizabantu pastors'
conference brought together 1,000 clergy from 14 African nations and 50 denominations. The
eighth annual conference, titled Revival and Reformation, produced a document calling
individuals, churches, and governments to repentance.
<BR><B>..."Evangelism is when you go out to people, but revival is when they come to you," Bathman
said</B>. Since 1976, the 800-acre farm has been in revival and ministered to hundreds of
thousands of tribal people, the mission's Kjell Olsen told NIRR. People from surrounding
areas come to its evening services and every year thousands become Christians. The ministry
teaches them to break with spiritism and ancestor worship, Bathman said. Before people are
baptized, they are required to burn all witchcraft and other religious paraphernalia during a
public service. Afterward, they are trained in farming techniques to make them
self-supporting. Many of the mission's former residents minister among the 10 tribal nations
in South Africa and others have made missions trips to Russia, Romania, Canada, and South
American countries, he said. NIRR 4/15/96
<P>
<B>Christians in Southern Sudan welcomed short-term missionaries with singing, dancing, and a
lavish feast last month</B>. The team from Capetown, South Africa-based Frontline Fellowship
was the first group of outsiders to visit the Mundri district in years, Frontline's Peter
Hammond said. They came to address an Episcopal Church conference, conduct pastors'
training courses, and hold services for Sudan People's Liberation Army forces. Because other
church gatherings have been bombed by Khartoum's Islamic government forces, the
conference was held at a compound constructed in the jungle. Hundreds of Christians
converged on the compound from all directions, Hammond said. 
<BR><B>...The area, known as Moruland, has had a strong Christian influence</B>. More than 80% of
Morus say they are Christian, and the area has a high literacy rate and low incidence of
leprosy and other diseases, Hammond said. The 300,000-member Episcopal Diocese in
Moruland is large and vigorous, having 24 parishes, 130 preaching centers, 45 pastors, and 65
lay preachers. The missionaries were "literally mobbed" by eager Morus when they began
passing out Bibles and other devotional literature, Hammond said. SPLA forces in Maridi
sang Christian hymns and cheered as Hammond preached, he said. NIRR 4/15/96

<B>An independent Pentecostal church movement is growing in Naples, Italy</B>. Since 1981, Tonio
and Michele Romeo have planted 25 churches in the harbor city, some in areas frequented by
drug dealers and prostitutes. Their method of "friendship evangelism" has worked well in the
heavily Catholic country, news reports said. The ministry first sends teams of about a dozen
people to hold open-air worship services or simply perform music. They are there to be
"present as Christians and point to God's presence," Discipling A Whole Nation reported. 
<BR><B>...After two months, they begin preaching on the streets, handing out tracts, and building
relationships</B>. In the Quartiere Spagniole, Naples' red-light district, their first convert donated
a shop to use as a church. Romeo recently completed Citadella Evangelica, a ministry center
that has a 2,000-seat auditorium, Bible school, guest house, and huge pizza oven to feed
guests. NIRR 4/15/96

<B>About 30 missionary families banded together during the violence that overtook Monrovia,
Liberia, at Easter</B>. They sought refuge at the home of Brian Johnson on the grounds of a
missionary radio station on the outskirts of the city (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/080795.html">NIRR 8/7/95</A>). Johnson is Liberian
director for World Relief, an aid and development arm of the National Association of
Evangelicals. Johnson described the situation as "a meltdown." Gunfire, widespread looting,
and banditry was continuous, he said. 
<BR><B>...Three United Methodist missionaries were trapped at their compound April 6 as fighting
raged outside, the denomination said</B>. On Easter, they were able to travel to the U.S. Embassy
for evacuation, Zebediah Marewangepo of the church's Board of Global Missions said. Two
days later, the U.S. State Department approved a full-scale evacuation plan and 150 Special
Forces troops were flown in to provide security. About 15,000 civilians, including foreign
diplomats, missionaries, and Liberian nationals, flooded the U.S. Embassy. About 470
Americans lived in Liberia at the time of the uprising. The announcement of a cease-fire five
days after the uprising may convince some missionaries to remain in the country, news
reports said. NIRR 4/15/96

<B>Young Methodist and Wesleyan clergy in the United States who are interested in evangelism
are forming The Order of the Flame network</B>. Organized by the World Methodist Council, the
group includes clergy who "are out there feeling alone, wondering if there is anyone else"
with the same fervor for spreading the gospel, according to Eddie Fox, WMC world director
of evangelism (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/122595.html">NIRR 12/25/95</A>).
<BR><B>...An initial group of 70 such clergy, all in their first five years of ministry, met March 4-7 in
Nashville</B>. Under the auspices of the WMC, clergy from African Methodist Episcopal, African
Methodist Episcopal Zion, Christian Methodist Episcopal, Nazarene, United Methodist, and
Wesleyan churches came together. They heard revival reports from Methodist evangelists who
minister in North and South America, Africa, Europe, and Australia. Worldwide, Methodism
has grown by 1 million people a year for seven years, Fox told NIRR. 
<BR><B>..."How assuring to find bishops and leaders in the Methodist movement who make
evangelism the top priority in their ministry," one pastor said after the conference</B>. "I was
beginning to believe that no one else, or at least a very few in my denomination, had a
passion for sharing the gospel anymore. I have been assured that there are many who share
[John] Wesley's zeal." 
<BR><B>...The WMC will help expand the evangelism network, Fox said</B>. Tentative plans include
offering various kinds of training, a newsletter, and international travel to mission fields. For
information about the network, call the WMC at (615) 340-7541. NIRR 4/15/96

<B>Hundreds of Christians are preaching the gospel on the streets and giving away food and
clothing this month in three impoverished, high-crime neighborhoods of Washington, D.C</B>.
The pastors and laity, organized by 400 workers from the South Tampa (Fla.) Christian
Center, began five weeks of outreach late last month. About 200 residents of the Stanton
Dwellings project in the Anacostia area came forward to receive Christ during an altar call.
Prayer teams are filtering through the neighborhoods, and thousands of other Christians
around the country are fasting and praying for Washington residents.
<BR><B>...The outreach leads up to Washington for Jesus '96, a massive, two-day rally on the Capitol
steps</B>. On April 30, Pentecostal, charismatic, evangelical, and other Christians from around the
country will pray against persecution of believers, homosexuality, abortion, racism, addictions,
occultism, and AIDS, organizers said. That will be preceded by a youth rally in front of the
Capitol from noon to 11 p.m. April 29. Previous WFJ rallies drew half a million people in
1980 and one million in 1988, the group said. The organizer is John Gimenez, co-pastor with
his wife, Anne, of the Rock Church of Virginia Beach. For information call (800) 495-5288.
The internet site is http://www.universe.digex.net/~talon/WFJ. 
<BR><B>...Observances for the National Day of Prayer, May 2, are planned around the country</B>.
Government leaders and ministers will pray from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the Caucus Room of
the Cannon House Office Building next to the Capitol. A citywide, multiethnic gathering for
prayer, praise, and reconciliation is planned for the Capitol steps from 5-8 p.m.
<BR><B>...Christian television and radio networks will broadcast a Concert of Prayer (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/051595.html">NIRR 5/15/95</A>)
from 8-11 p.m</B>. Eastern Daylight Saving Time. Christians across the country have been
encouraged to gather with members of other congregations to watch the broadcast, thus
forming a single prayer meeting from coast to coast. In another event, evangelism leaders
who are involved in the Mission America movement will meet May 1 in Washington to detail
plans for evangelizing U.S. cities (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/122595.html">NIRR 12/25/95</A>). NIRR 4/15/96

<B>Membership in a number of mainline Protestant denominations continues to decline,
according to the National Council of Churches' 1996 Yearbook of American and Canadian
Churches</B>. The biggest mainline decline since last year's edition was suffered by the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). It lost 98,630 members, a 2.6% drop. The United Church of
Christ lost 28,868 members (1.89%), and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), lost
20,373 members (2.13%). 
<BR><B>...Churches that grew include: the Catholic Church, up 332,563 members (.56%); Southern
Baptist Convention, up 215,418 (1.4%); Mormon Church, up 93,000 (2.1%); Assemblies of
God, up 52,897 (2.3%); Jehovah's Witnesses, up 19,376 (2.1%); and Seventh-day Adventist
Church, up 13,646 (1.8%)</B>.    
<BR><B>...Contributions rose, even in churches that are losing members</B>. Nearly all of those providing
contribution figures for the 1996 yearbook showed increases. The Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A.) had a 4.8% increase, to a total of $2.1 billion. The United Church of Christ reported
a .3% increase for a total of $623.8 million. The Disciples of Christ registered a 3.3% rise, to
$385.5 million. The 47 U.S. church bodies that gave financial data reported $18.5 trillion in
total contributions, an average of $413.66 per member.
<BR><B>...The Roman Catholic Church remained the nation's largest religious body, with 60,190,605
members</B>. It is followed by the Southern Baptist Convention, 15,614,060; the United
Methodist Church, 8,584,125; the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., Inc., 8,200,000;
Church of God in Christ, 5,499,875; and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America,
5,199,048.
<BR><B>...Four of the 10 largest U.S</B>. denominations have predominantly African-American
membership. They are the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., Inc.; Church of God in Christ;
National Baptist Convention of America, Inc. (3.5 million), and African Methodist Episcopal
Church (3.5 million).
<BR><B>...The number of women students in theological schools in the United States and Canada
increased to 31.6% of the 65,174 total, the yearbook said</B>. NIRR 4/15/96

<B>Lesli van Milligen became the first woman ordained into The Christian Reformed Church in
North America</B>. As an evangelist, van Milligen can administer sacraments and preside at
marriages, but cannot be appointed as the senior pastor or sole pastor of an organized
congregation, according to the United Reformed News Service, an independent agency. She
was ordained by Classis Lake Erie, a regional body in the denomination, and will serve as
co-pastor with her husband, Tom, at North Hills Christian Reformed Church in Troy, Mich. 
<BR><B>...The issue of women's ordination threatens to create a schism in the conservative
292,000-member denomination, whose headquarters is in Grand Rapids, Mich</B>. The
denomination's Synod, or top decision-making body, voted in 1995 to allow regional bodies
to ordain women (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/080795.html">NIRR 8/7/95</A>). Thirteen of the 46 regional bodies have made such
declarations, the news service said. NIRR 4/15/96

<B>A decade after the Jesus Seminar began its search for the historical Jesus, it is struggling to
find a new direction</B>. The seminar's 75 self-appointed scholars asked two questions: What did
Jesus really say? What did Jesus really do? They concluded that Jesus was a teacher who did
not walk on water, resist Satan in the desert, or raise Lazarus from the dead (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/082195.html">NIRR 8/21/95</A>).
The scholars said they doubt whether Jesus said many quotes attributed to him and believe
the resurrection could have been an act of mass hysteria by Jesus' followers unable to come
to terms with his death. Their findings first were published in 1993 as The Five Gospels: The
Search for the Authentic Words of Jesus (Macmillan). A follow-up, The Acts of Jesus: The
Search for the Authentic Deeds of Jesus (Little, Brown and Co.), is to be published next year.

conclusions the seminar reached. Other plans include producing a new history of the gospel
tradition and continuing a new translation of the letters of Paul.

secular news magazines had cover stories raising questions about what can be believed in the
gospels. "Some scholars are debunking the Gospels. Now traditionalists are fighting back.
What are Christians to believe?" asked Time Magazine. Newsweek said people are

The city of St. Louis subpoenaed one church's records and said it may do the same to other
congregations to verify the residency of municipal employees, who are required to live in
town. City counselor Tyrone Taborn said city employees agree when they are hired to allow
such investigations.
<BR><B>..."I was just appalled and couldn't believe it," said pastor Rudy Pulido of Southwest Baptist
Church, who organized a protest against the policy</B>. A coalition of pastors, the American Civil
Liberties Union, and Americans United for Separation of Church and State told the city in a
letter that its action was "a serious breach" of First Amendment rights. St. Louis did not show
a "compelling interest" in getting the records from churches since it had other ways to get the
information, including using data from public utilities, banks, voter registrations, and public
schools, Pulido told NIRR. In a letter responding to Pulido, Taborn agreed to subpoena
church records "only as a last resort" to seek residence information and "not to inquire about
their religious beliefs and activities." He promised to consult with Pulido's attorney before
any such subpoena. NIRR 4/15/96

<B>Christian music is gaining influence in the recording industry</B>. In 1990, gospel music
accounted for 2.5% of all music sales. By 1994, that increased to 3.3%, amounting to $390
million -- about the same as classical and jazz, according to news reports. A Gospel Music
Association study showed that from 1991-1995, Christian music sales averaged 22% growth
per year, Religion News Service said. Other popular music averaged 5% annual growth, CMA
said. 
<BR><B>...Recognizing the sales potential, major music companies have purchased the largest gospel
music labels, including Sparrow, StarSong, and Reunion</B>. The added distribution power has
enabled Christian music to be sold in mainstream stores such as Wal-Mart and Target. As a
result, Christian artists have gained a higher profile in mainstream society. Albums by
Michael W. Smith and DC Talk opened at No. 16 on the Billboard charts last year; DC Talk
also won a Grammy. Their recent single, Jesus Freak, is shown on MTV. NIRR 4/15/96

<BR><B>...Currently, the only penalty the IRS can impose is to revoke a charity's tax exemption, an

amount found to be excessive. Failure to comply can result in fines of 200% the amount,
according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy.

tax returns</B>. Under the new provisions, charities would have to provide copies of the returns to
anyone who requests them, and to send them within 30 days to those who make written
requests. Currently, charities are required only to show the forms, not provide copies, to those
who request them in person. The proposals include higher fines for noncompliance. NIRR

<B>Another federal court has ruled in favor of the right-to-die movement</B>. The 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals ruled that New York state's ban on assisted suicide violates the Constitution
by failing to treat individuals equally. Judges said it made no sense to allow doctors to
disconnect life-support systems from some patients while forcing them to preserve the lives of
others. The ruling by the 2nd Circuit gave more credibility to a decision by the 9th Circuit in
San Francisco, which voted to strike down Washington state's assisted-suicide ban (NIRR
4/1). Observers said the issue is likely to reach the Supreme Court by the end of the year.
<BR><B>...The rulings have left legal and medical ethicists stunned</B>. The courts have "short-circuited
the societal debate and created the right almost overnight," Arthur Caplan, director of the
Center for Bio-Ethics at the University of Pennsylvania, told the press. The centuries-old
prohibitions on assisted suicide are meant to hold the line against self-destructive acts due to
depression, despair, exhaustion, or misguided compassion, Americans United for Life said.
<BR><B>...The ruling jeopardizes "over 2,000 years of medical, legal, and moral protections," the
Christian Medical and Dental Society and the Christian Legal Society said in a joint

<B>Anti-government militia groups such as the Montana Freemen teach a racist 19th-century
theology called Christian Identity</B>. Adherents of its ideas say that white Christians have
displaced the Jews as the "true Israelites," that the United States is the new Promised Land,
and that it should belong solely to white Christians, according to Kenneth Stern's new book,
A Force Upon the Plain: The American Militia Movement and the Politics of Hate (Simon &
Schuster). Adherents of Christian Identity say that Jews dominate the government, which must
be taken back by struggle. Jews are considered the offspring of Satan, and blacks are
considered their lackeys, a sub-human species created before Adam and Eve.
<BR><B>...Christian Identity claims 35,000 members in the United States</B>. It also taps into a broader
discontent with the government, spawning a patriot/militia movement estimated at 5 million
members. Only a small fraction of the movement advocates armed struggle against the
government, observers say. The 31 paramilitary training camps linked to the movement
operate in 22 states, according to Morris Dees, a lawyer for the Southern Poverty Law Center.
Militia members communicate through electronic mail, faxes, publications, 70 World Wide

<B>Abortion providers say they anticipate that the U.S</B>. government soon will approve
drug-induced abortions, and they want doctors to be ready to perform them, news reports said.
A two-drug combination, designed for ending pregnancies before the ninth week, induces
abortion over several days (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/090895.html">NIRR 9/8/95</A>). The method can be performed in a doctor's office
without special equipment. It involves an injection of methotrexate, which interferes with cell
division, killing the fetus. Several days after the injection, a second drug, misoprostol, brings
on uterine contractions, causing the fetus to be expelled, usually within a day. A third visit to
the doctor is required to confirm that the abortion was complete. The Food and Drug
Administration has not yet approved such abortions.
<BR><B>...Meanwhile, a nonprofit research group finished testing the French abortion pill RU-486 on
2,100 American women and asked the FDA to allow it for sale in the United States</B>. The
FDA's review could take six months or longer. RU-486 blocks development of progesterone,
a hormone that is essential for maintaining pregnancy. There can be side effects, including
heavy bleeding and nausea. Federal health officials have said RU-486 won't be available over

bodyguards took over a Sofia candle factory</B>. Patriarch Maxim said that the factory is illegal
because it is run by priests who are in rebellion against him. The clerics accused Maxim of
being a puppet of the old Communist regime. Led by Metropolitan Pimen, the priests split
from the Eastern Orthodox Church after the government collapsed in 1989. 
<P>
<B>England: Hindus are praying for the protection of cattle that may be slaughtered because of
mad cow disease</B>. The Eastern religion considers cows sacred.  As officials debated whether
to kill the herds, Swami Ramesh Mashru urged their protection. "The cows should be allowed
to reach a natural death," he said. About 140,000 Hindus live in England, news reports said.
<P>
<B>Germany: The Evangelical Church in Germany may begin ordaining practicing homosexuals</B>.
"If such a step is necessary for the sake of truth and love, then we must dare take it," reads
Living With Tensions, ECG's 55-page report on the subject. The ECG comprises 24 church
bodies and represents most Protestants in Germany, news reports said.
<P>
<B>Moldova: A leading finance company is paying a group of Eastern Orthodox monks to pray
for its prosperity</B>. Exiton Finance Group signed a contract with the monks at Noul Neamt
monastery, promising to support its operation and help recover lost icons in return for the
prayers. After signing the contract, company executives and monks prayed together.  
<P>
<B>Portugal: The first Portuguese edition of the Full Life Bible Study, an Assemblies of God
publication, "is a significant milestone," said missionary Linda Stamps, whose husband wrote
many of the study's notes</B>. More than 100,000 copies of the book have been sold in three
months, the AG reported. Copies of the study also have been released in Brazil.  
<P>
<B>Russia: The Communist Party has removed its official doctrine of atheism from its charter</B>.
But the act is merely a ploy to gain the support of the Russian Orthodox Church, observers
said. Both democratic and communist politicians are trying to ingratiate themselves with the
church "in a cheap attempt to get its blessing and more votes from believers," said former
priest Gleb Yakunin (NIRR 4/18/94), once a member of the Duma. The country is in the
midst of a presidential election campaign, which will culminate in June. 
<P>
<B>Russia: The Russian Orthodox Church expressed a desire to mend its break with the Eastern
Orthodox Church</B>. Two priests were appointed negotiators at a meeting of the ROC's Holy
Synod last month. The Constantinople-based Eastern Church said it would cooperate in
discussions, news reports said. The rift developed when Orthodox churches in Estonia were
removed from the Russian church's jurisdiction (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/031896.html">NIRR 3/18</A>).

<B>Renewal is occurring in mainline Protestant churches, but its outcome remains in question</B>.
Can renewalists rouse enough people in the pews to make a difference? Is the liberal
establishment too entrenched for reform efforts to succeed? Are denominations headed for the
graveyard of irrelevance anyway? Should renewal focus instead on creating new alliances that
will in effect replace the denominations and better reflect biblical concepts of Christian unity?
Those were some of the questions raised at last month's annual meeting of leaders of renewal
groups in the historic Protestant denominations. Churches represented included the Episcopal
Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the
United Church of Christ, the United Methodist Church, and the United Church of Canada.
<BR><B>...Denominations are in crisis because they have ignored their theological and spiritual roots,
the two dozen participants at the two-day meeting in Washington, D.C., agreed</B>. Renewal
endeavors, whether confrontations with ecclesiastical bureaucrats over issues or efforts to
awaken people in the pews, must be based on theology and spirituality, they said.
<BR><B>...The renewal leaders noted several trends in mainline denominations that are fostering
renewal or show the need for it</B>.
<BR><B>...There is a proliferation of new renewal groups and evangelical fellowships in some
denominations, they said</B>. For example, evangelical fellowships have sprouted in more than
half (40) of the regional conferences in the 8.6-million-member United Methodist Church,
according to James Heidinger of Good News, an evangelical movement in the UMC.   
<BR><B>...Broad-based groups of moderates and conservatives known as "confessing church"
movements are forming</B>. These movements are rallying around core statements of doctrine.
Some are calling their denominations to scriptural accountability for what is promoted by
their agencies and taught in their seminaries. They address such issues as neo-pagan worship,
sexuality and the family, and ecumenism, said UMC theologian Tom Oden of Drew
University (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/101695.html">NIRR 10/16/95</A>). A former liberal himself, he is a leader in the new, fast-growing
confessing church movement within the UMC.    
<BR><B>...Partnerships of like-minded churches from different denominations in networks or "strategic
alliances" are developing</B>. Such alliances are the wave of the future, and are beginning to
replace denominationalism in New England, said David Runnion-Bareford of Biblical Witness
Fellowship, a group in the United Church of Christ. At the local level, the alliances are
uniting networks of pastors, youth ministries, women's groups, and mission cooperatives
across denominational lines, he said. For many churches, he added, the annual Congress of
the Boston-based Evangelistic Association of New England has replaced the annual
conference or synod of their own denominations (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/020596.html">NIRR 2/5</A>). Some 1,100 congregations
belong to the EANE. A number of churches reportedly are forwarding less money to
denominational headquarters and directing the rest to projects closer to their theological
liking, often closer to home.   
<BR><B>...There is a drift of some denominations toward de facto Unitarianism</B>. Several leaders
warned that arch-feminists, gay rights advocates, and other "radicals" in positions of power
are shaping agendas and influencing church pronouncements. Church agencies are focusing
more on political correctness than on the mission of the church, they complained. NIRR

<B>Chicago's largest crusade in 25 years is taking place during April and May</B>. Say Yes Chicago
with Luis Palau, a regionwide outreach, includes some 125 rallies, banquets, seminars, and
other events in Chicago and nearby Libertyville, Waukegan, Elgin, Oak Brook, Aurora,
Lincolnshire, Winnetka, Naperville, Arlington Heights, and Palatine. Larger rallies will be
held in the Rosemont Horizon, University of Illinois at Chicago Pavilion, and World Music
Theater. Evangelists Palau, E.V. Hill, and Tony Evans, and Chinese, Hispanic, and Korean
speakers will target various ethnic groups. The crusade's finale, on Memorial Day in
downtown Chicago's Grant Park, is expected to draw up to 300,000 people. The crusade is
the largest in the city since Billy Graham came there 25 years ago, organizers said.
<BR><B>...Members of nearly 2,000 churches, including Asians, blacks, Hispanics, and whites, are
cooperating, as are dispensationalist and charismatic groups</B>. Every major African-American
denomination is participating in the crusade, according to Mark Anderson, chairman of the
executive committee that has worked for three years planning Say Yes Chicago. While
acknowledging that "differences are significant and important to us," crusade organizers
"learned that those things that bind us together are more important than what divides us," said
Irwin Lutzer. He is senior pastor of The Moody Church and chairman of the crusade's
pastoral committee. The crusade will be preached in several languages, and Palau's messages
will be translated into Spanish, Korean, and Chinese.
<BR><B>...Organizers hope the crusade will ease ethnic tensions in the city</B>. "Chicago is more divided
than most cities," Anderson said. Many Chicago neighborhoods are "ethnically pure" and
residents know which streets divide their group from others. "The hate that has built up is a
lose-lose situation," he told NIRR. Anderson said he was stunned by the depth of anger that
surfaced among Christians during the crusade preparations. After working with Anderson and
becoming his friend, one black man told him that "six months ago I would have walked away
from you because I hated every white man." NIRR 4/1/96

<B>Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship announced formation of the International Renewal
Network</B>. Some 30 renewal leaders, including the TACF's John Arnott, Colorado Springs
pastor Ted Haggard, and Gerald Coats of Britain's Pioneer Churches network, are
spearheading the loose affiliation of church renewal movements around the world, TACF
pastor Fred Wright told NIRR. Most have been affected by the Toronto Blessing or similar
manifestations of the "renewing work of the Holy Spirit," he said. IRN's purpose is to
provide a point of contact for other renewal movements worldwide and encourage those
wanting to be involved. IRN is establishing a Home Page on the World Wide Web where
churches can post stories about renewal, find out about conferences, and explore new
directions with other churches. "It's a means of ongoing communication and can give new
churches a first level of contact," Wright said. NIRR 4/1/96

<B>Evangelicals who worry that their movement is more concerned with unity than truth are
convening a summit April 17-20 in Cambridge, Mass</B>. The Alliance of Confessing
Evangelicals will host some 100 pastors, scholars, parachurch leaders, and writers. The
summit will include presentations of academic papers examining evangelicalism and issuance
of a declaration. 
<BR><B>...Many conservative Protestant churches have "lost their faithfulness to the Bible in both faith
and practice," the Alliance said</B>. The ACE cited "accommodation" with secular culture, such
as the "pragmatism and consumerism of the church-growth movement"; the "therapeutic
worldview" that replaces classical Christianity; dependence upon "modern idols" such as
politics, sociology, marketing and psychology; and the "anti-intellectualism and
anti-theological sentiments of a relativistic age." ACE organizers seek to restore the concept
of a "confessing church" committed to written statements of faith and doctrine. NIRR 4/1/96
<P>
<B>A series of conferences for women is drawing overflow crowds</B>. About 50,000 women are
attending The Joyful Journey conferences this year, according to their sponsor, Minirth Meier
New Life Clinics. The Laguna Beach, Calif.- based mental healthcare provider planned
conferences in seven cities, but added three more after those sold out and women were turned
away. Plans call for more conferences in larger auditoriums and coliseums next year. 
<BR><B>...Conference speakers mix humor with wisdom, said Stephen Arterburn, chief executive
officer of Minirth Meier Clinics</B>. Speakers Patsy Clairmont, Barbara Johnson, Marilyn
Meberg, and Luci Swindoll all have "overcome some major life challenge" through faith in
Christ, Arterburn told NIRR. "Women are coming to Christ during the events as they hear the
message that He is the only source of hope." NIRR 4/1/96
<P>
<B>The Worldwide Church of God continues to emerge from theological isolationism toward
mainstream Christianity (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/052995.html">NIRR 5/29/95</A>)</B>. "More and more of the Christian community is
welcoming us and seeing us for what we are," WCG President Joseph Tkach told NIRR. The
WCG has had "very positive contacts with the greater Christian community."
<BR><B>...Skepticism about the WCG's transformation was understandable, Tkach said</B>. WCG founder
Herbert W. Armstrong insisted his was the true church while teaching doctrines that
contradicted historic Christianity. "We called other churches children of the devil," Tkach
said. "We completely repent of that."
<BR><B>...WCG doctrine began changing after Armstrong's death when church leaders re-examined
his ideas</B>. The WCG now teaches the doctrines of the Trinity and salvation by grace through
faith. But certain distinctives are maintained. Members still worship on Saturdays and observe
seven Holy Days based on the Old Testament, but the observances are no longer required.
<BR><B>...Tkach says he is "acutely aware of the heavy legacy of our past," including alienating
former members</B>. But friendly contacts with the larger Christian community have encouraged
him. "It's like thinking you are an only child, then waking up and finding you have houses
full of brothers and sisters." NIRR 4/1/96

<B>Teen Challenge programs are operating in Latin American prisons</B>. At Tacumbu Prison in
Asuncion, Paraguay, prison officials created an "unprecedented opportunity" for ministry to
inmates, Assemblies of God missionary Rodney Hart said. They allocated space for a Teen
Challenge center in the prison and gave permission for inmates to serve time there. Hart plans
to create a 50-bed rehabilitation facility where prisoners will be instructed in the faith and
receive counseling for addictions or emotional problems. Teen Challenge is an AG ministry
for those with life-controlling problems. 
<BR><B>...In Quito, Ecuador, prisoners are baptized in a 55-gallon drum as other inmates watch</B>. Some
are too big to fit in the drum, so "we put them in as far as they can and then pour a 5-gallon
bucket of water over their head," AG missionary Tim Anderson told NIRR. About 15-30
inmates are baptized every two months. Teen Challenge has a presence in two cellblocks at
the Quito prison, and about 150 of the 1,000 inmates -- "from check bouncers to international
drug dealers" -- are Christians, he said. Inmates are strongly evangelistic; they recently started
a Bible study in one of the worst cell blocks in the prison. NIRR 4/1/96

<B>Franklin Graham capped a 12-day Australian tour in Brisbane, where he preached to 82,000
people March 15-17</B>. More than 700 churches participated in Brisbane's Festival '96, and
volunteers visited 600,000 homes to personally invite people, according to the Billy Graham
Evangelistic Association. It was the first time that all the city's major denominations worked
together in an evangelistic event. Some 2,800 people responded to the message.
<BR><B>...Many Australians are seeking a relationship with God, said Gov</B>. Leneen Forde of
Queensland, who hosted Graham at a breakfast for 650 civic leaders. The trip included a
three-day festival in Sydney and one-night services in Cairns and Townsville (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/031896.html">NIRR 3/18</A>).
When Cyclone Ethel's rains marred the trip, Ruth Bell Graham, recovering from spinal
meningitis, faxed her son a letter. "Being flat on my back gives me plenty of time to pray for
you," she wrote. NIRR 4/1/96

<B>Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary plans to help troubled pastors</B>. The Fort Worth,
Texas, school's board of trustees approved a program in which a minister or staff member
facing termination would become an associate pastor or other staff member at a "refuge
church." The "offended church," or congregation asking the minister to resign, would agree to
pay his salary for six months. While at the new church, the minister would attend
Southwestern classes on conflict management, personal communication skills, and
husband/wife relationship issues. Housing for the minister and his family would be provided
at the seminary. Several other denominations have expressed interest in the program, Baptist
Press reported.
<BR><B>....The minister-restoration program, called The Antioch Affection, was proposed by SBTS
trustee Bob Anderson, pastor of Parkview Baptist Church in Baton Rouge, La</B>. His church has
brought in 250 church staff members for restoration over 22 years, and 107 of them are back
in service. Parkview Baptist has "played Barnabas and Paul with them, helping them come
back to good mental, spiritual, and physical health," Anderson said. NIRR 4/1/96

<B>The AD 2000 & Beyond Movement is organizing Americans to pray for their cities</B>. Under a
new interdenominational initiative, Christians will gather to pray in major U.S. cities each
April starting in 1997. The prayers are intended to be the American counterpart to AD 2000's
10/40 Window outreach held each October, which includes "prayer journeys" from the United
States to Islamic countries. Before praying, participants in Pray USA! will familiarize
themselves with demographic, historical, and spiritual information about their cities supplied
through AD 2000. For information, contact the U.S. Prayer Track of AD 2000 at (713)

<B>"Has the body of Christ forgotten us?" pastors in a Rwandan refugee camp asked an
American pastor there recently</B>. The refugees are living on faith in the seemingly hopeless
situation, according to Temple, Texas, pastor Gary DeSalvo, who ministered to 270 pastors
from 25 denominations in Goma, Zaire. Hopelessness is widespread because most relief
agencies have left the area and refugees fear no one cares, DeSalvo told NIRR. Yet their faith

<B>A prison where Saddam Hussein had thousands of Kurds killed now is a medical clinic run
by the Nashville-based Servant Group, President Doug Layton told NIRR</B>. About 1,000 Kurds,
grouped by family, live in the former Nizarkeh prison, where Christian seminars and outreach
services are held. Servant Group plans to build more than 100 houses for the people on
nearby land. Once they are relocated, the building will become a ministry center including the
clinic, a children's home, a school, and a business-and-technology center. The prison and land
was donated by the governor of Dihouk, the Kurdish province closest to Turkey. The

<B>Allegations of bribery surround the church trial of Greek Orthodox Church in Cyprus cleric
Archimandrite Pangratios Meraclis</B>. The priest is accused of immoral conduct, but has strong
support among the laity, many of whom don't believe the charges. It is widely believed that
Meraclis would have been elected Bishop of Morphou last month, but Archbishop
Chrysostomos suspended the priest, canceled the election, and brought the charges.

incident, the archbishop suspended the trial, which angered people further because they
believe it delays Meraclis' acquittal. The Cypriot attorney-general ordered an investigation
into the trial after two witnesses discussed receiving bribes. In their taped phone conversation,
the witnesses said they received about $32,000 apiece from a close friend of the archbishop to
testify against Meraclis, according to news reports. NIRR 4/1/96

<B>Volunteer prison chaplains from two Minneapolis congregations are suing in federal court
after being forbidden to discuss gospel passages concerning sexual morality</B>. The volunteers
often visit prisoners to listen, counsel, worship, and study. But Hennepin County official
Marilyn Schoonover told them in a letter that they would not be invited back to the Adult
Corrections Facility in Plymouth, near Minneapolis, if they continued to point out Bible
verses against homosexuality. Schoonover cited an incident in which the volunteers "told
residents that homosexuality is a sin."
<BR><B>...A lesbian prisoner reportedly was offended when a volunteer from a Church of God in
Christ congregation quoted passages from the Bible about homosexuality</B>. The jail must be
"free of comments or actions which may be offensive" to inmates, and volunteer chaplains
must speak to them "without judgment," Schoonover said in the letter, in which she
interpreted a Hennepin County diversity policy. 
<BR><B>...The volunteers say that teaching prisoners to adopt a godly lifestyle must include addressing
issues of sexual purity</B>. Attorney Jordan Lorence, who represents the volunteers, told NIRR
"the idea that the government knows what's best for us is very Orwellian." Alan Sears,
president of the Alliance Defense Fund, a Phoenix, Ariz., religious liberty group helping fund

<B>The U.S</B>. Supreme Court agreed to review whether "bubble" zones at abortion clinics violate
the constitutional free-speech rights of demonstrators (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/111395.html">NIRR 11/13/95</A>). Proponents of the
zones say that they help shield clinic patients and staff members from protesters. Thus, the
zones diffuse the potential for violence that could result from the aggressive speech and
tactics of some protesters, clinic operators say.
<BR><B>...Pro-life groups applauded the decision</B>. Bubble zones are the creation of people who can't
stand the idea of Christians "offering alternatives to death," said Flip Benham of Operation
Rescue National. "We are getting arrested on public sidewalks," Benham said. Vicki Saporta
of the National Abortion Federation said the bubble zones are necessary to prevent "violence
like John Salvi's." 
<BR><B>...The ruling under review involves a "floating" 15-foot zone imposed to protect Buffalo and
Rochester, N.Y., clinics</B>. Under a court order, protesters must stay at least 15 feet away from
patients and staff members as they enter and leave clinics. An exception allows one or two
protesters to do "nonthreatening counseling" within the 15-foot zone unless the listener

Second Baptist distributed materials that directed members to vote for specific slates of

<B>A pioneering Russian pastor in Grozny, Chechnya, has been kidnapped from his home</B>. Vasili
Luppof graduated from the Moscow-based Alpha and Omega Bible and Missionary School

thousands of rubles for the building, U.S. missionary to Russia Stan Williamson told NIRR.
But Luppof constantly received threats, and last month he was taken from outside his home

the customers were Christians and two were Muslims from a nearby village. The men then
pounded on nearby doors, claiming to be the police. When the doors were opened, the men of
the households were abducted and shot. Police said the attack was a deliberate assault on
Christians, as no Muslims live in the village. The Muslim governor of the province attended
the funerals to show his support for the community and a heavily armed security contingent is
stationed temporarily in the village. Residents of the village are poorly paid farm workers
who have traditionally lived in peace with the Muslims, Coptic priest Abuna Samuel said. He

<B>Argentina: A rift between the Catholic Church and the government is developing over
President Carlos Menem's economic policies</B>. Several bishops castigated Menem because the
unemployment rate reached record highs last year. Menem, a Catholic who converted from
Islam, called the bishops hypocrites and fools. The Church has been criticized for not
speaking against the human-rights abuses of past regimes (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/041795.html">NIRR 4/17/95</A>).
<P>
<B>Cuba: The government dismissed a statement by Catholic bishops condemning the shootdown
of two civilian planes (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/031896.html">NIRR 3/18</A>)</B>. Most Christians saw the act as a legitimate defense,
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said. The bishops said it was "excessive" and also
criticized the U.S. government for tightening economic sanctions.
<P>
<B>Ecuador: Cell groups are multiplying rapidly at a Quito church</B>. Three years ago, Assemblies
of God missionary pastor John Smith had 30 cell groups. Now there are 958. Attendance is
9,000 and the mother church has six services on Sunday, Smith's wife said. "They told us cell
groups wouldn't work here, but it's the Lord's time for this."
<P>
<B>Honduras: About 100,000 people attended three rallies in Tegucigalpa led by evangelist Luis
Palau</B>. About 6,000 people confessed Christ at the rallies, Palau's organization said. Palau met
with President Carlos Roberto Reina to discuss the impact of the gospel on society. The
president has promoted a "moral revolution" he believes will help the economy in Honduras,
one of the poorest nations in the Americas, Palau's group said.

<B>Bosnia: Missionaries promoting reconciliation between Croats and Muslims are in danger,
according to Novi Most, a charity based in the United Kingdom</B>. Three Novi Most workers
who arranged multiethnic activities in Mostar have received death threats, which the police
regard as serious. Two of the workers have fled the city and the other is in hiding, according
to the group. 
<P>
<B>Bulgaria: Government leaders are cooperating with the Orthodox Church to hamper
evangelical ministries and turn public opinion against them, news reports said</B>. Evangelicals
are barred from radio and television broadcasting, have been blocked from constructing or
renting buildings, and are falsely accused of killing babies (NIRR 11/14/94) and giving people
drugs, Baptist Press said.
<BR><B>...In Sofia, construction of a Union of Baptist Churches ministry complex has been delayed
more than a year because officials refused building permits and threatened to confiscate the
land (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/080795.html">NIRR 8/7/95</A>)</B>. A Sofia paper quoted a government agency accusing "non-traditional
religious societies" of trying "to disturb the national interest."
<BR><B>...In a letter to the World Council of Churches, the Bulgarian Evangelical Alliance accused
Orthodox leader Patriarch Maxim of demanding that non-Orthodox faiths be expelled from
the country</B>. Protestants want only equal treatment under the law, as the constitution requires,
said Sofia regional court judge Alexey Ivanov, an evangelical.                                 
<P>
<B>England: World Evangelical Fellowship is sponsoring several conferences in London April
9-13</B>. A Missions Commission will study ways to reduce missionary attrition, and a
theological commission will meet at London Bible College. In addition, the International
Council of Accrediting Agencies plans to hold its annual meeting at Moreland College. For
more information, contact WEF at (708) 668-0440.
<P>
<B>England: The head of the Baptist Union of Great Britain rebuked Prime Minister John Major
for saying that churches should support the national lottery and benefit from its revenues</B>. The
lottery symbolizes the country's "spiritual illness" and it is "profoundly wrong" to fund
charities with its proceeds, David Coffey commented. The number of people contributing to
charities has declined by 14% since the lottery began in 1994, according to news reports.
<P>
<B>Estonia: Thousands of Russian Orthodox Church loyalists marched in Tallin protesting
discrimination</B>. Estonian courts ruled that only the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church,
recently removed from Moscow's jurisdiction by the Eastern Orthodox Church (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/031896.html">NIRR 3/18</A>),
can take possession of existing Orthodox churches and buildings. "The state has committed a
colossal aggression against our church," ROC loyalists said. 
<P>
<B>France: More than 30 members of the Order of the Solar Temple were detained and
questioned by police</B>. Some 200 officers were involved in the operation, ordered by a
magistrate in Grenoble who is investigating the murder-suicide of 16 members there last year
(<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/010896.html">NIRR 1/8</A>). The raids may have been launched to counter a collective suicide, news reports
said.
<P>
<B>Germany: The federal parliament criticized the state of Brandenburg for failing to include
traditional religious education in its school curriculum</B>. Religious classes are generally
developed under the supervision of church groups, but the Brandenburg course,
Life-Ethics-Religion, relies on a secular model, news reports said.
<P>
<B>Germany: A 1541 document written by Martin Luther has been returned to Germany after 50
years in the United States</B>. The Concordia Historical Institute of St. Louis turned over the
80-page Wider Hans Wurst to representatives of the Kulturhistorisches Museum of
Magdeburg last month. An American soldier found the manuscript at the end of World War II
and gave it to Theodore Bornhoeft, a military chaplain. Bornhoeft kept it in his New Jersey
study until 1950, then sent it to Concordia requesting it be returned to Magdeburg, in the
former East Germany, after the communists left.    
<P>
<B>Ukraine: President Leonid Kuchma rejected calls for a state church and said he will mediate a
conflict between the country's two Orthodox denominations</B>. A breakaway branch of the
church has declared itself independent from the rule of the Russian Orthodox Church in
Moscow (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/031896.html">NIRR 3/18</A>). Kuchma said policies will be developed guaranteeing equal conditions
for all faiths and peace between all confessions, news reports said.
<P>
<B>Vatican: The Catholic Church of Rwanda can not be blamed for the slaughter committed by
its individual members in 1994, Pope John Paul II said</B>. Those who took part "must have the
courage to bear the consequences of the deeds they committed against God," the pope said.

<B>Many of the 39,024 ministers at the Promise Keepers Clergy Conference for Men in Atlanta
(<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/022096.html">NIRR 2/20</A>) last month are describing it as a spiritual high-water mark for themselves and
possibly a turning point for the church</B>. Diverse in color, ethnicity, and denominational
background, they seemed at the end united in commitment to personal repentance and
renewal, and to reconciliation and revival in the church. Their vows are summarized in the
Atlanta Covenant, a document being distributed by the Promise Keepers ministry.
<BR><B>..."I've seen nothing like it in 35 years of ministry," said Robert Short, 53, pastor of First
Alliance Church, Fort Myers, Fla</B>. A veteran religion reporter said the three-day conference
was one of the most significant events he's witnessed in 30 years of covering the church
scene. To pastor Charles Dixon, 49, of Western Heights Baptist Church in Waco, Texas, who
teaches a seminary extension course on church growth, the conference was "a defining
development in the life of the church." But pastors must work to spread the fire to their
congregations at home, or the convention "will have been just another waste of time and
resources," Short cautioned.
<BR><B>..."We are on the verge of the greatest spiritual revolution in the history of the church, and
you are called to be a part of it," Wellington Boone told the gathering</B>. Boone is an
African-American pastor who heads an urban ministry that emphasizes prayer and unity. "God
couldn't find a pastor to bring this group together; He had to use a football coach," he said,
referring to Promise Keepers founder Bill McCartney, former University of Colorado coach.
"Well, I have no intention of letting a college football coach be more serious about the things
of God than I am," Boone declared. The audience cheered and applauded.
<BR><B>...The pastors carry lingering images from the Georgia Dome indoor stadium: Men embracing
as they prayed for each other at the conclusion of John Maxwell's talk on accountability</B>. "We
don't need one more guy to fall off the edge," Maxwell said. Preachers on their knees after
Chuck Swindoll's sermon on brokenness and repentance, a few face-down on the floor,
weeping and praying. Steve Green singing Let the Walls Come Down, with everyone
standing, their hands held aloft and locked with their neighbors' hands. Sustained cheers and
applause for Max Lucado's wall-razing treatise on biblical unity. "Unity matters to God. It is
a priority item for Him and should be for us," he said. Maxwell, a former Wesleyan pastor in
suburban San Diego, heads Injoy, a ministry to ministers. Swindoll, a former Evangelical Free
Church pastor in Fullerton, Calif., is president of Dallas Seminary. Lucado is a San Antonio,
Texas, author and pastor in the traditionally separatist non-instrumental Church of Christ.  
<BR><B>...In a pivotal session on race, Raleigh Washington and Glen Kehrein, black and white
Chicago ministers, respectively, and co-authors of a book on reconciliation, discussed their
experiences at length</B>. After they finished, Tony Evans, the black pastor of interracial Oak
Cliff Bible Fellowship in Dallas, stepped to the podium and warned of making theology
subservient to sociology: "If you can't [identify] the cause of racism, you can't get at the
solution." The pulpits of America have failed to deal with the problem, he said. Racism, he
declared, "is a sin," and unrepentant racists in the church -- whether black or white -- need to
be disciplined just like any other unrepentant sinners. He received a standing ovation.  
<BR><B>...Next came California Foursquare pastor Jack Hayford, who has been working for racial
reconciliation in Los Angeles</B>. He said it had taken him three decades to discover
"unperceived racism." Addressing blacks, he requested forgiveness for a host of shortcomings,
from insensitivity to their pain to wrong attitudes. He added, "I don't know well how to be
different, but I ask for your help and understanding as I grow." Everyone stood and applauded
for a long time. Suddenly it was quiet. Then from the rear middle deck a voice cried out, "I
forgive you, my brother." Another from the left lower deck shouted, "Me, too." Others all
over the stadium echoed the words.
<BR><B>...Blacks and whites hugged each other and prayed together throughout the Georgia Dome
after worship leader Joseph Garlington, pastor of 1,700-member Covenant Church, a
multiracial Pittsburgh congregation, extended forgiveness on behalf of the assembled blacks</B>.
He called on his brethren to repent for bitterness, strife, separatism, and the like, and to
commit themselves to unity with other believers. Garlington asked all the black ministers to
stand as he prayed for them. As he did, whites sitting nearby quietly went to the black
ministers' sides and laid hands on their shoulders or heads. 
<BR><B>...There were more confessions, hugs, and tears as Hispanic, Asian, and Native American
representatives joined the others</B>. Finally McCartney took over. He urged the ministers to root
out racism and stand for justice. Amid a long standing ovation, he summoned all blacks to
come to the front. "We want to honor you," he said. From all over the stadium they streamed,
perhaps 1,800 altogether. On the main floor, whites left their seats and formed aisles through
which the blacks passed. All along the route, there were embraces, handshakes, and words of
appreciation and encouragement. Whites throughout the stadium continued their applause and
chanted, "We love you, we love you." The demonstration ended in prayer. "Let us be the
generation of love and reconciliation," McCartney urged.
<BR><B>...The coach had hoped that far more black pastors would attend</B>. Many were offered
scholarships. But in preparatory meetings across the country, he found many blacks to be
reluctant to join movements organized and controlled by whites. Although blacks hold
prominent offices and roles in PK, it still is a predominantly white group trying to recruit
black churches and churchmen, said Henry Lyons, president of the 8.5-million-member
National Baptist Convention U.S.A. "I see it as an attempt to put us back on the plantation,"
he was quoted as saying in USA Today on the opening day of the conference. Lyons has
launched a men's movement in black churches called Trusted Partners; some of its goals are
similar to those of Promise Keepers. PK officials did not comment on Lyons' quote, but held
out hope that the seeds planted in Atlanta eventually will result in racial harmony and
cooperation throughout the church.                                              
<BR><B>...Of equal concern to McCartney are denominational differences that impede unity</B>. "I am not
saying that we should dismantle our denominations and ignore our distinctives, but that we
should concentrate on the 95% where we agree," he told reporters. "If we do that, we'll see
positive change." At the final session, he invited everyone who could partake in communion
without violating his conscience to do so as a sign of unity in Christ. He noted the presence
of Catholic priests and others in the assembly with views that might bar them from taking
part. Hardly anyone left the building.
<BR><B>...Within the first two weeks back home, pastors were reporting they already had begun to
meet regularly with new prayer partners</B>. For example, John Hauck, 36, pastor of a United
Methodist church in Bradley, Ill., said he is meeting with a nearby Episcopal priest who
became his prayer partner while they were in Atlanta. In Waco, Texas, a post-Atlanta
"after-glow" report to 350 people, a number of them ministers, resulted in an Atlanta-like
session of racial reconciliation. At least one black pastor said he will join a weekly prayer
gathering of several of his white brethren. Others spoke of beginning cooperative,
community-wide outreaches in the days ahead. "We need repentance, revival, and
reconciliation," said Waco pastor Charles Dixon. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>A "Third Wave" church movement has begun in China</B>. Some 4,200 independent churches
with 1.2 million believers are opening across the country with the approval of local
government officials, according to Asian Outreach, a Hong Kong-based ministry. The
churches are registered as People's Organizations and are not part of the government-run
Three Self Patriotic Movement or the persecuted house-church movement. "We don't fight the
Three Self...we only preach Jesus and serve the local community," one pastor told Asian
Outreach's David Wang. City officials were among the thousands gathered to dedicate the
pastor's new church in central China last month. 
<BR><B>...Third Wave churches are not political and don't receive money or materials from outside
the country, Wang said</B>. The recently opened church was financed by Chinese Christians. By
avoiding conflicts between the Three Self and house churches, the ministers can develop
relationships with local Communist Party officials. The officials used to believe "one more
Christian, one less Chinese," but Third Wave pastors are trying to change that impression.
"Their message is `one more Christian, one better Chinese,'" Wang said. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>A missionary's prayer for rain in Thailand saved a village's harvest and convinced its people
to become Christians, according to the Hong Kong-based Sower's Ministry</B>. In Kalasin
province, 134 families became Christians when native missionary Lun Poobuanak and his
church prayed for rain. Poobuanak was holding services with his small congregation when the
village leaders interrupted. "If you ask your God to give us rain this month, all households in
our clan will worship your God and become Christians," said the leader. Skeptical at first,
Poobuanak told them they could not "play games with the living God." But the leader
repeated his vow and said, "If we do not, your God can send judgment on us." The Christians
immediately began to fast and pray.
<BR><B>...On the fourth day a storm came that filled the rice fields and saved their crops</B>. The rain
was so intense that "the villagers admitted that Jesus is the true and living God," Poobuanak
said. All the households in the village were converted and word has spread to many of the
surrounding districts. "This is a living testimony that helps us win souls easily in this area,"
Poobuanak said. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>About 100 pastors from 10 European countries went to Ljubljana, Slovenia, last month for the
International Congress on Revival, a weeklong conference on preaching, prayer, and ministry</B>.
"They share their burdens, needs, and victories so we can pray and rejoice with them,"
conference organizer Bill Stafford said. 
<BR><B>...Pastors who "have a heart for Jesus and their country" are invited to attend the congress,
Stafford, a Southern Baptist evangelist for 40 years, told NIRR</B>. ICR pays expenses for travel,
food, and lodging. "They go back refreshed and it is evident in their preaching. We get
reports of churches having revival after they return," Stafford said. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>"Structures of sin" account for trillions of dollars of the world's money consumption, the
Global Evangelization Movement, a Richmond, Va.-based research group, reported</B>. Financial
crimes, including fraud, tax evasion, and computer theft, add up to almost $2 trillion, while
gambling ($700 billion), organized crime ($600 billion), drug trafficking ($150 billion),
shoplifting ($90 billion), and pornography ($20 billion) account for the rest. A little more than
10% of the money consumed by such endeavors could provide food, shelter, and education
for the world's poor, according to GEM.
<BR><B>...The global church has the money to evangelize the world many times over, GEM said</B>.
Personal income of church members worldwide amounted to $11.1 trillion, of which $193
billion, about 2%, is given to Christian causes yearly. Parachurch groups, local churches, and
other groups received $194 billion last year. About 9.6 billion was lost to ecclesiastical crime,
GEM said. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>A 30-minute video has helped bring 10,000 teen-agers to Christ</B>. Some 400,000 teen-agers
have watched The Crossing since it premiered at Youth For Christ's DC-LA '94 convention
(NIRR 8/8/94), where it received three standing ovations. Since then, The Crossing has been
rented and shown at youth rallies, at youth group meetings, and in homes. YFC now is selling
the tape, which gives a clear presentation of the salvation message. The group also is
encouraging Christians to show it to their non-Christian friends. The video comes with a
booklet containing 30 suggested situations in which to show it.
<BR><B>..."Ten thousand kids is just a small indication" of what could happen when the video is
shown to large numbers of nonbelievers, said Bill Muir of YFC, who wrote the screenplay for

<B>A San Bernardino, Calif., church has been burglarized more times than pastor Robin Hyde
can remember, including nine times since last May</B>. Thieves have broken into the sanctuary,
office, nursery, fellowship hall, and restrooms at Cornerstone Church of the Nazarene, making
off with light fixtures, soap dispensers, coffee urns, vacuum cleaners, and musical
instruments. The congregation has done everything but put barbed wire around the sanctuary,
he said. Hyde spends a lot of time filing insurance claims.
<BR><B>...Nevertheless, the church continues to reach out to the community</B>. It feeds 300 poor people
each month and sends teams into surrounding neighborhoods to pray with people. "We are
not controlled by these things -- we can't be. We are a church," Hyde said. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>Some African-Americans have a "been there, done that" opinion about racial reconciliation,
according to Barbara Williams Skinner, president of the Skinner Farm Leadership Institute</B>.
Skinner, who is black, is the wife of the late evangelist Tom Skinner (NIRR 1/24/94).
<BR><B>...Blacks who are not enthusiastic about reconciliation with whites generally have four
reasons, Skinner said in The Reconciler magazine</B>. First, despite much talk, whites don't
understand blacks very well, she said. Second, reconciliation reminds blacks of the failed
integration movement of the 1960s, when blacks were asked to give up their heritage while
whites "didn't give up anything," she said. Third, blacks fear losing control of their churches.
Fourth, they detect racist attitudes among whites in the church. Yet blacks should not turn
these sentiments into "an obstacle course for whites," Skinner said. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>Churchgoers from some three dozen denominations raised $1 million Jan</B>. 28 to feed the poor

services. The money collected is being donated directly to local ministries to the poor.
<BR><B>...More than 3,500 churches, synagogues, businesses, and schools participated in the program,
called Souper Bowl</B>. The idea began in 1990 with Brad Smith, pastor of Spring Valley
Presbyterian Church in Columbia, S.C. He prayed on Super Bowl Sunday, "As we go home
to enjoy the Super Bowl, let us remember those who are without even a bowl of soup." Now,
100 volunteers work during the year compiling and distributing an informational brochure,
newsletter, and video, and maintaining a database. On Souper Bowl Sunday, 60 volunteers
answer telephones and tabulate donations. Smith spends 20% of his time on the project, he
told NIRR. For information, call (800) 358-SOUP. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>Activists are refining the language of a religious freedom amendment</B>. Reps. Henry Hyde
(R-Ill.), a Catholic, and Ernest Istook (R-Okla.), a Mormon, both proposed amendments
seeking to clarify the First Amendment. Hyde's resolution prohibits laws that discriminate "on
account of religious expression, belief, or identity." It says the First Amendment's prohibition
of an establishment of religion should not be construed to require such discrimination (NIRR
10/30/95). Istook's bill would prohibit laws that disallow "acknowledgments of the religious
heritage, beliefs, or traditions of the people, or prohibit student-sponsored prayer in schools." 
<BR><B>...But a debate over which proposal is better has kept both amendments bottled up</B>. Advocates
of Hyde's version say Istook's allows too much government involvement in religion, while
Istook criticizes Hyde's version for not directly addressing prayer in public schools. A
number of religious groups, including the Southern Baptist Christian Life Commission, the
Christian Legal Society's Center for Law and Religious Freedom, and the National
Association of Evangelicals, helped draft the original Hyde proposal and are refining its
language. A new proposal should be ready early this month. It is very close to the original
version, the CLS's Steven McFarland told NIRR. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>Television networks should make 8-9 p.m</B>. the "family hour" with programming suitable for
all ages, Media Research Council said. A survey by the Alexandria, Va.-based watchdog
group showed that obscene language and sexual content are increasingly prevalent then. In
four weeks last year during that time slot, the four major networks aired 72 obscenities and
73 sexual situations. NBC had the most obscenities, while the Fox network had the most
sexual content. ABC had the fewest in both categories, the group said.

American churches to help, Open Doors Communications Director Jeff Taylor said. Later, the
news service changed its name and established an independent board of directors, with Open
Doors remaining its largest contributor.
<BR><B>...Last year, the ministry ended its support for NNI partly because it had gone "a little outside
the vision and style of Open Doors," with an increased focus on human-rights issues rather
than persecution of Christians only, Taylor said</B>. Open Doors plans to start another news

similar ban on the use of journalists would be waived if "unique and specific threats to
national security" exist.

<B>Egypt: Eight Coptic Christians were killed last month in an ambush set by militant Muslims,
authorities believe</B>. The attack took place on a farm near Badari, about 200 miles south of
Cairo. Since 1992, Gama'a al-Islamiya (Islamic Group) has been waging a guerrilla war
aimed at undermining the government of Hosni Mubarak and creating an Islamic republic.
The group targets policemen, foreign tourists, and Egyptian Christians, according to news
reports.
<P>
<B>Guinea: More than 500 people became Christians during a Christian & Missionary Alliance
Church outreach in Gueckdou</B>. The church trained laymen, prepared materials, and prayed for
a year before starting the outreach in the heavily Muslim area. Two missionary pastors are
working among the new believers to establish churches, the C&MA reported. 
<P>
<B>Somalia: Lutheran World Relief is airlifting 600 tons of food, water, fuel, and soap</B>. The
supplies will aid 15,000 children in Mogadishu and 2,500 in the southern port of Kismaayo.
Poor harvests are contributing to instability in the country, according to news reports. 
<P>
<B>Sudan: The planned pullout of the U.S</B>. diplomatic corps, ordered by the State Department
because Sudan reportedly is aiding terrorists, will not hinder relief operations, news reports
said. Catholic Relief Services, Lutheran World Relief, and World Vision will continue efforts
in Southern Sudan, which add up to $30 million. A 10-year civil war has devastated the
region.
<P>
<B>Zaire: Mission Aviation Fellowship workers helped prevent the spread of a cholera epidemic</B>.
When the outbreak started, a MAF technician set up radio communications between a hospital
and local doctors, who ordered medicines. In five days, MAF pilots delivered the medicines
to a village where there were 600 cases of cholera, the ministry said.
<P>
<B>Zimbabwe: Catholic bishops condemned persecution of homosexuals</B>. They said
homosexuality is a disorder, but the government should not harass or torture homosexuals.
"We want to eliminate the disease...we do not want to eliminate those who suffer from it,"
they said. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, a Catholic, has called homosexuals perverts
and beasts and said they have no rights in the country (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/091395.html">NIRR 9/13/95</A>). 
<P>
<B>ASIA   China: Fifty house churches began in Peking after the government replaced Three
Self Patriotic Movement pastor Yang Yudong with someone more loyal to the
government-controlled church</B>. Disgruntled members left Yudong's congregation and started
the new churches.
<P>
<B>Indonesia: Margaret Stringer of The Evangelical Alliance Mission spent 20 years translating
the New Testament into the Citak tribal language</B>. Some 100,000 Citaks live in Irian Jaya.
Three thousand New Testaments have been distributed. 
<P>
<B>Israel: Pottery inscribed with Hebrew markings has been found near the caves where the Dead
Sea Scrolls were discovered</B>. The writing appears to be a shipping list and is dated "the year
2," a reference to the second year of the Jewish revolt against the Romans, which began in 66
A.D., scholars said. 
<P>
<B>Malaysia: Six hundred Christian churches have been started in the mostly Muslim country
since 1992, said Daniel Ho, director of the National Evangelical Fellowship</B>. Twenty-two
churches and organizations are involved in church planting.
<P>
<B>Russia: Russian Jews now can read the Talmud in their own language</B>. Earlier this year Israeli
Rabbi Adin Seinsaltz completed a version of the Talmud, an ancient collection of religious
and civil laws interpreted by Jewish teachers. 
<P>
<B>Thailand: The government will require Buddhist monks and candidates for monkhood to take
lie-detector tests</B>. Scandals involving monks are prompting background investigations. This
year, Yodchat Suapoo was convicted of murdering a British tourist. It was discovered later
that he had been convicted of rape before joining a monastery. Other monks have raped
children and broken their chastity vows (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/082195.html">NIRR 8/21/95</A>).
<P>
<B>Vietnam: Three American Christians and 20 Vietnamese Christians were arrested while
worshipping at a house church in Ho Chi Minh City</B>. The Vietnamese were released

<B>Brazil: The growth of Protestantism is changing the way people view themselves, EP News
said</B>. A poll of 2,000 Brazilians found they see themselves as more optimistic and hard
working than in the past. The churches are "a key component" in the new spirit, which
stresses organization, savings, and personal improvement, the poll found.
<P>
<B>Colombia: Drug-related corruption and crime have created a morally sick society, the Catholic
Bishops' Conference concluded</B>. People are "selling their souls to demon drug lords" and
honesty and righteousness have been destroyed, they said. The bishops met as President
Ernesto Samper was being charged with accepting campaign contributions from the
now-defunct Cali drug cartel. 
<P>
<B>Guatemala: The Catholic Church's 1995 Human Rights Report accuses rogue soldiers of
kidnap, murder, and terror</B>. An average of 10 people a day were executed in 1995 and more
than 150 people have been kidnapped this year, most by paramilitary groups, said Bishop
Juan Gerardi. "In the name of God I call for an end to this injustice," he said.

<B>Commonwealth of Independent States: Four years after the CoMission's ministry began, more
than 125,000 people have attended its biblical-values seminars (NIRR 2/8/93)</B>. Six million
pieces of Christian literature and New Testaments have been distributed in classrooms and
110,000 people have watched the Jesus film shown by CoMission teams.
<P>
<B>Commonwealth of Independent States: The Slavic Gospel Association is shipping 15 tons of
aid to needy families in the former Soviet Union</B>. About 20% of the shipment is clothes
donated by Land's End Direct Merchants. The SGA also sent thousands of bottles of vitamins
and stuffed animals to children suffering illnesses related to the Chernobyl disaster, and
theological books to pastoral students at Odessa Seminary.
<P>
<B>England: More than half of Evangelical Alliance churches grew last year, a survey shows</B>. Of
the 1,100 churches from 12 denominations that participated in the survey, 53% grew in
membership, 14% declined, and 33% remained steady.
<P>
<B>Germany: Government and religious leaders last month commemorated the 450th anniversary
of the death of Martin Luther</B>. President Roman Herzog honored the reformer, saying his
contributions were more than theological. "You can trace...his teachings to today's concepts of
freedom of conscience [and] equality in law," Herzog said. Luther died in Eisleben on Feb.
18, 1546. 
<P>
<B>Russia: A dispute between the Russian and Eastern Orthodox Churches resulted in schism</B>.
The conflict concerns jurisdiction over the Moscow-governed Estonian Orthodox Church,
which had been part of the Eastern Orthodox branch before the Soviet Union annexed Estonia
in 1940. Last month, Eastern Orthodox Patriarch Bartholomew reclaimed jurisdiction at the
Estonian Church's request. In response, the Russian Orthodox Church announced it was
suspending relations with the Istanbul-based Eastern Church, which is the head of all
Orthodox churches.

<B>Many of the 39,024 ministers at the Promise Keepers Clergy Conference for Men in Atlanta
(<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/022096.html">NIRR 2/20</A>) last month are describing it as a spiritual high-water mark for themselves and
possibly a turning point for the church</B>. Diverse in color, ethnicity, and denominational
background, they seemed at the end united in commitment to personal repentance and
renewal, and to reconciliation and revival in the church. Their vows are summarized in the
Atlanta Covenant, a document being distributed by the Promise Keepers ministry.
<BR><B>..."I've seen nothing like it in 35 years of ministry," said Robert Short, 53, pastor of First
Alliance Church, Fort Myers, Fla</B>. A veteran religion reporter said the three-day conference
was one of the most significant events he's witnessed in 30 years of covering the church
scene. To pastor Charles Dixon, 49, of Western Heights Baptist Church in Waco, Texas, who
teaches a seminary extension course on church growth, the conference was "a defining
development in the life of the church." But pastors must work to spread the fire to their
congregations at home, or the convention "will have been just another waste of time and
resources," Short cautioned.
<BR><B>..."We are on the verge of the greatest spiritual revolution in the history of the church, and
you are called to be a part of it," Wellington Boone told the gathering</B>. Boone is an
African-American pastor who heads an urban ministry that emphasizes prayer and unity. "God
couldn't find a pastor to bring this group together; He had to use a football coach," he said,
referring to Promise Keepers founder Bill McCartney, former University of Colorado coach.
"Well, I have no intention of letting a college football coach be more serious about the things
of God than I am," Boone declared. The audience cheered and applauded.
<BR><B>...The pastors carry lingering images from the Georgia Dome indoor stadium: Men embracing
as they prayed for each other at the conclusion of John Maxwell's talk on accountability</B>. "We
don't need one more guy to fall off the edge," Maxwell said. Preachers on their knees after
Chuck Swindoll's sermon on brokenness and repentance, a few face-down on the floor,
weeping and praying. Steve Green singing Let the Walls Come Down, with everyone
standing, their hands held aloft and locked with their neighbors' hands. Sustained cheers and
applause for Max Lucado's wall-razing treatise on biblical unity. "Unity matters to God. It is
a priority item for Him and should be for us," he said. Maxwell, a former Wesleyan pastor in
suburban San Diego, heads Injoy, a ministry to ministers. Swindoll, a former Evangelical Free
Church pastor in Fullerton, Calif., is president of Dallas Seminary. Lucado is a San Antonio,
Texas, author and pastor in the traditionally separatist non-instrumental Church of Christ.  
<BR><B>...In a pivotal session on race, Raleigh Washington and Glen Kehrein, black and white
Chicago ministers, respectively, and co-authors of a book on reconciliation, discussed their
experiences at length</B>. After they finished, Tony Evans, the black pastor of interracial Oak
Cliff Bible Fellowship in Dallas, stepped to the podium and warned of making theology
subservient to sociology: "If you can't [identify] the cause of racism, you can't get at the
solution." The pulpits of America have failed to deal with the problem, he said. Racism, he
declared, "is a sin," and unrepentant racists in the church -- whether black or white -- need to
be disciplined just like any other unrepentant sinners. He received a standing ovation.  
<BR><B>...Next came California Foursquare pastor Jack Hayford, who has been working for racial
reconciliation in Los Angeles</B>. He said it had taken him three decades to discover
"unperceived racism." Addressing blacks, he requested forgiveness for a host of shortcomings,
from insensitivity to their pain to wrong attitudes. He added, "I don't know well how to be
different, but I ask for your help and understanding as I grow." Everyone stood and applauded
for a long time. Suddenly it was quiet. Then from the rear middle deck a voice cried out, "I
forgive you, my brother." Another from the left lower deck shouted, "Me, too." Others all
over the stadium echoed the words.
<BR><B>...Blacks and whites hugged each other and prayed together throughout the Georgia Dome
after worship leader Joseph Garlington, pastor of 1,700-member Covenant Church, a
multiracial Pittsburgh congregation, extended forgiveness on behalf of the assembled blacks</B>.
He called on his brethren to repent for bitterness, strife, separatism, and the like, and to
commit themselves to unity with other believers. Garlington asked all the black ministers to
stand as he prayed for them. As he did, whites sitting nearby quietly went to the black
ministers' sides and laid hands on their shoulders or heads. 
<BR><B>...There were more confessions, hugs, and tears as Hispanic, Asian, and Native American
representatives joined the others</B>. Finally McCartney took over. He urged the ministers to root
out racism and stand for justice. Amid a long standing ovation, he summoned all blacks to
come to the front. "We want to honor you," he said. From all over the stadium they streamed,
perhaps 1,800 altogether. On the main floor, whites left their seats and formed aisles through
which the blacks passed. All along the route, there were embraces, handshakes, and words of
appreciation and encouragement. Whites throughout the stadium continued their applause and
chanted, "We love you, we love you." The demonstration ended in prayer. "Let us be the
generation of love and reconciliation," McCartney urged.
<BR><B>...The coach had hoped that far more black pastors would attend</B>. Many were offered
scholarships. But in preparatory meetings across the country, he found many blacks to be
reluctant to join movements organized and controlled by whites. Although blacks hold
prominent offices and roles in PK, it still is a predominantly white group trying to recruit
black churches and churchmen, said Henry Lyons, president of the 8.5-million-member
National Baptist Convention U.S.A. "I see it as an attempt to put us back on the plantation,"
he was quoted as saying in USA Today on the opening day of the conference. Lyons has
launched a men's movement in black churches called Trusted Partners; some of its goals are
similar to those of Promise Keepers. PK officials did not comment on Lyons' quote, but held
out hope that the seeds planted in Atlanta eventually will result in racial harmony and
cooperation throughout the church.                                              
<BR><B>...Of equal concern to McCartney are denominational differences that impede unity</B>. "I am not
saying that we should dismantle our denominations and ignore our distinctives, but that we
should concentrate on the 95% where we agree," he told reporters. "If we do that, we'll see
positive change." At the final session, he invited everyone who could partake in communion
without violating his conscience to do so as a sign of unity in Christ. He noted the presence
of Catholic priests and others in the assembly with views that might bar them from taking
part. Hardly anyone left the building.
<BR><B>...Within the first two weeks back home, pastors were reporting they already had begun to
meet regularly with new prayer partners</B>. For example, John Hauck, 36, pastor of a United
Methodist church in Bradley, Ill., said he is meeting with a nearby Episcopal priest who
became his prayer partner while they were in Atlanta. In Waco, Texas, a post-Atlanta
"after-glow" report to 350 people, a number of them ministers, resulted in an Atlanta-like
session of racial reconciliation. At least one black pastor said he will join a weekly prayer
gathering of several of his white brethren. Others spoke of beginning cooperative,
community-wide outreaches in the days ahead. "We need repentance, revival, and
reconciliation," said Waco pastor Charles Dixon. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>A "Third Wave" church movement has begun in China</B>. Some 4,200 independent churches
with 1.2 million believers are opening across the country with the approval of local
government officials, according to Asian Outreach, a Hong Kong-based ministry. The
churches are registered as People's Organizations and are not part of the government-run
Three Self Patriotic Movement or the persecuted house-church movement. "We don't fight the
Three Self...we only preach Jesus and serve the local community," one pastor told Asian
Outreach's David Wang. City officials were among the thousands gathered to dedicate the
pastor's new church in central China last month. 
<BR><B>...Third Wave churches are not political and don't receive money or materials from outside
the country, Wang said</B>. The recently opened church was financed by Chinese Christians. By
avoiding conflicts between the Three Self and house churches, the ministers can develop
relationships with local Communist Party officials. The officials used to believe "one more
Christian, one less Chinese," but Third Wave pastors are trying to change that impression.
"Their message is `one more Christian, one better Chinese,'" Wang said. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>A missionary's prayer for rain in Thailand saved a village's harvest and convinced its people
to become Christians, according to the Hong Kong-based Sower's Ministry</B>. In Kalasin
province, 134 families became Christians when native missionary Lun Poobuanak and his
church prayed for rain. Poobuanak was holding services with his small congregation when the
village leaders interrupted. "If you ask your God to give us rain this month, all households in
our clan will worship your God and become Christians," said the leader. Skeptical at first,
Poobuanak told them they could not "play games with the living God." But the leader
repeated his vow and said, "If we do not, your God can send judgment on us." The Christians
immediately began to fast and pray.
<BR><B>...On the fourth day a storm came that filled the rice fields and saved their crops</B>. The rain
was so intense that "the villagers admitted that Jesus is the true and living God," Poobuanak
said. All the households in the village were converted and word has spread to many of the
surrounding districts. "This is a living testimony that helps us win souls easily in this area,"
Poobuanak said. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>About 100 pastors from 10 European countries went to Ljubljana, Slovenia, last month for the
International Congress on Revival, a weeklong conference on preaching, prayer, and ministry</B>.
"They share their burdens, needs, and victories so we can pray and rejoice with them,"
conference organizer Bill Stafford said. 
<BR><B>...Pastors who "have a heart for Jesus and their country" are invited to attend the congress,
Stafford, a Southern Baptist evangelist for 40 years, told NIRR</B>. ICR pays expenses for travel,
food, and lodging. "They go back refreshed and it is evident in their preaching. We get
reports of churches having revival after they return," Stafford said. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>"Structures of sin" account for trillions of dollars of the world's money consumption, the
Global Evangelization Movement, a Richmond, Va.-based research group, reported</B>. Financial
crimes, including fraud, tax evasion, and computer theft, add up to almost $2 trillion, while
gambling ($700 billion), organized crime ($600 billion), drug trafficking ($150 billion),
shoplifting ($90 billion), and pornography ($20 billion) account for the rest. A little more than
10% of the money consumed by such endeavors could provide food, shelter, and education

<B>A 30-minute video has helped bring 10,000 teen-agers to Christ</B>. Some 400,000 teen-agers
have watched The Crossing since it premiered at Youth For Christ's DC-LA '94 convention
(NIRR 8/8/94), where it received three standing ovations. Since then, The Crossing has been
rented and shown at youth rallies, at youth group meetings, and in homes. YFC now is selling
the tape, which gives a clear presentation of the salvation message. The group also is
encouraging Christians to show it to their non-Christian friends. The video comes with a
booklet containing 30 suggested situations in which to show it.
<BR><B>..."Ten thousand kids is just a small indication" of what could happen when the video is
shown to large numbers of nonbelievers, said Bill Muir of YFC, who wrote the screenplay for
The Crossing and co-produced it</B>. The video has been dubbed into Spanish and will be shown
to groups and aired widely on TV in Latin America, Muir told NIRR.  
<BR><B>...Teen-agers identify with the video's youthful protagonist, Muir said</B>. In a dream, the young
man is presented with a computer printout of his sins and is found guilty in a courtroom. He
then is brought to watch Christ die for him and subsequently walks across a chasm with the

<B>A San Bernardino, Calif., church has been burglarized more times than pastor Robin Hyde
can remember, including nine times since last May</B>. Thieves have broken into the sanctuary,
office, nursery, fellowship hall, and restrooms at Cornerstone Church of the Nazarene, making
off with light fixtures, soap dispensers, coffee urns, vacuum cleaners, and musical
instruments. The congregation has done everything but put barbed wire around the sanctuary,
he said. Hyde spends a lot of time filing insurance claims.
<BR><B>...Nevertheless, the church continues to reach out to the community</B>. It feeds 300 poor people
each month and sends teams into surrounding neighborhoods to pray with people. "We are
not controlled by these things -- we can't be. We are a church," Hyde said. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>Some African-Americans have a "been there, done that" opinion about racial reconciliation,
according to Barbara Williams Skinner, president of the Skinner Farm Leadership Institute</B>.
Skinner, who is black, is the wife of the late evangelist Tom Skinner (NIRR 1/24/94).
<BR><B>...Blacks who are not enthusiastic about reconciliation with whites generally have four
reasons, Skinner said in The Reconciler magazine</B>. First, despite much talk, whites don't
understand blacks very well, she said. Second, reconciliation reminds blacks of the failed
integration movement of the 1960s, when blacks were asked to give up their heritage while
whites "didn't give up anything," she said. Third, blacks fear losing control of their churches.
Fourth, they detect racist attitudes among whites in the church. Yet blacks should not turn
these sentiments into "an obstacle course for whites," Skinner said. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>Churchgoers from some three dozen denominations raised $1 million Jan</B>. 28 to feed the poor

services. The money collected is being donated directly to local ministries to the poor.
<BR><B>...More than 3,500 churches, synagogues, businesses, and schools participated in the program,
called Souper Bowl</B>. The idea began in 1990 with Brad Smith, pastor of Spring Valley
Presbyterian Church in Columbia, S.C. He prayed on Super Bowl Sunday, "As we go home
to enjoy the Super Bowl, let us remember those who are without even a bowl of soup." Now,
100 volunteers work during the year compiling and distributing an informational brochure,
newsletter, and video, and maintaining a database. On Souper Bowl Sunday, 60 volunteers
answer telephones and tabulate donations. Smith spends 20% of his time on the project, he

<B>Activists are refining the language of a religious freedom amendment</B>. Reps. Henry Hyde
(R-Ill.), a Catholic, and Ernest Istook (R-Okla.), a Mormon, both proposed amendments
seeking to clarify the First Amendment. Hyde's resolution prohibits laws that discriminate "on
account of religious expression, belief, or identity." It says the First Amendment's prohibition
of an establishment of religion should not be construed to require such discrimination (NIRR
10/30/95). Istook's bill would prohibit laws that disallow "acknowledgments of the religious
heritage, beliefs, or traditions of the people, or prohibit student-sponsored prayer in schools." 
<BR><B>...But a debate over which proposal is better has kept both amendments bottled up</B>. Advocates
of Hyde's version say Istook's allows too much government involvement in religion, while
Istook criticizes Hyde's version for not directly addressing prayer in public schools. A
number of religious groups, including the Southern Baptist Christian Life Commission, the
Christian Legal Society's Center for Law and Religious Freedom, and the National
Association of Evangelicals, helped draft the original Hyde proposal and are refining its
language. A new proposal should be ready early this month. It is very close to the original
version, the CLS's Steven McFarland told NIRR. NIRR 3/4/96

<B>Television networks should make 8-9 p.m</B>. the "family hour" with programming suitable for
all ages, Media Research Council said. A survey by the Alexandria, Va.-based watchdog
group showed that obscene language and sexual content are increasingly prevalent then. In
four weeks last year during that time slot, the four major networks aired 72 obscenities and
73 sexual situations. NBC had the most obscenities, while the Fox network had the most
sexual content. ABC had the fewest in both categories, the group said.

<B>News Network International is out of business</B>. The news service, which focused on

attention to the plight of suffering Christians around the world and attempted to inspire
American churches to help, Open Doors Communications Director Jeff Taylor said. Later, the
news service changed its name and established an independent board of directors, with Open
Doors remaining its largest contributor.
<BR><B>...Last year, the ministry ended its support for NNI partly because it had gone "a little outside
the vision and style of Open Doors," with an increased focus on human-rights issues rather
than persecution of Christians only, Taylor said</B>. Open Doors plans to start another news

synagogues</B>. Richard Stevens was caught trying to break into a room at the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel, police said. He confessed to a string of burglaries since 1992 at synagogues and other
locations and to the theft of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of Torahs, art, and silver
objects, news reports said. There is a market in the United States and abroad for second-hand
scrolls, which are valued at as much as $15,000 each. None of the Torahs has been recovered.
<P>
<B>Some 250 evangelism leaders across the country formed an informal group called The
Network</B>. They use a monthly newsletter to share ideas. About 75% of the members are
Southern Baptists, but others also have joined. For information, call the group's director, Bob
Bailey of the Southeastern Indiana Baptist Association, at (812) 282-8777.
<P>
<B>The Catholic Church must pay $600,000 in punitive damages to a man molested by a priest in
1981</B>. It is reportedly only the third time the Church has been ordered to pay such damages,
imposed to punish offenders and deter others from similar conduct. A Hennepin County,
Minn., jury on Feb. 13 found the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis guilty of "willful
indifference to the rights and safety" of Dale Scheffler, 28. He had been abused by Robert
Kapoun, who had been kept in the ministry after acknowledging previous wrongdoing. The
jury also awarded $550,000 in compensatory damages to Scheffler.

<B>Egypt: Eight Coptic Christians were killed last month in an ambush set by militant Muslims,
authorities believe</B>. The attack took place on a farm near Badari, about 200 miles south of
Cairo. Since 1992, Gama'a al-Islamiya (Islamic Group) has been waging a guerrilla war
aimed at undermining the government of Hosni Mubarak and creating an Islamic republic.
The group targets policemen, foreign tourists, and Egyptian Christians, according to news

<B>Zimbabwe: Catholic bishops condemned persecution of homosexuals</B>. They said
homosexuality is a disorder, but the government should not harass or torture homosexuals.
"We want to eliminate the disease...we do not want to eliminate those who suffer from it,"
they said. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, a Catholic, has called homosexuals perverts
and beasts and said they have no rights in the country (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/091395.html">NIRR 9/13/95</A>).

<B>Germany: Government and religious leaders last month commemorated the 450th anniversary
of the death of Martin Luther</B>. President Roman Herzog honored the reformer, saying his
contributions were more than theological. "You can trace...his teachings to today's concepts of
freedom of conscience [and] equality in law," Herzog said. Luther died in Eisleben on Feb.
18, 1546. 
<P>
<B>Russia: A dispute between the Russian and Eastern Orthodox Churches resulted in schism</B>.
The conflict concerns jurisdiction over the Moscow-governed Estonian Orthodox Church,
which had been part of the Eastern Orthodox branch before the Soviet Union annexed Estonia
in 1940. Last month, Eastern Orthodox Patriarch Bartholomew reclaimed jurisdiction at the
Estonian Church's request. In response, the Russian Orthodox Church announced it was
suspending relations with the Istanbul-based Eastern Church, which is the head of all
Orthodox churches.

<B>It was possibly the largest gathering of clergy in the church's history</B>. Nearly 40,000 pastors
and other clergy, including 2,000 mostly English speakers from abroad, attended the opening
rally of the Promise Keepers 1996 Clergy Conference for Men at Atlanta's Georgia Dome
indoor football stadium Feb. 13. "This is biblical unity, this is historic stuff," PK founder Bill
McCartney, a former University of Colorado football coach, told scores of reporters. It's a
sign God is bringing revival to His church, added Bishop Phillip Porter of the Church of God
in Christ, the Colorado pastor who chairs PK's board.
<BR><B>...All the major denominations were represented, including the Catholic Church, organizers
said</B>. Few clerical collars or vestments were seen in the stadium; most participants dressed
casually, the majority in jeans. Participants ranged from retirement age to young men fresh
out of seminary. Whites seemed to outnumber blacks by 30 or 40 to 1, although Promise
Keepers is taking major steps to persuade black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American
ministers to join its movement, spending a reported $1 million to bring nonwhite clergy to the
Atlanta conference. Some 2,500 people of color received PK financial help to attend the
conference, said Raleigh Washington, a black minister who leads Promise Keepers'
Reconciliation Division.
<BR><B>...Strife in the church along racial and denominational lines is a major impediment to revival,
McCartney told participants</B>. If the church "had come together in harmony before God, racism
could never have taken hold," he said, prompting waves of applause. McCartney told of
having visited groups of black pastors in cities across America, where he discovered the hurt
and pain that keeps blacks away from white-run events and projects. He called on his listeners
to reach out to each other in love and forgiveness. Peppering his keynote talk with Bible
verses, McCartney appealed for commitment to Christ above all else, to unity in the church,
to love of the Bible ("every word is inspired by God"), and to prayer. He announced that PK
is calling for 1 million men with such commitments to go to a Washington, D.C., rally in
September 1997 to show concern for the nation's spiritual condition.
<BR><B>...The conference was meant to pump up America's pastors at a time when stress is high and
job satisfaction is low</B>. Studies show that many pastors struggle with their job and personal
life, and are isolated from the people they serve. "I needed this conference," said Allan
Austin, 30, a Free Will Baptist pastor from Marianna, Fla. He said he and his wife had lost
their 7-month-old son to a rare cancer in October, and in the process he had "lost the vision"
for ministry. "But tonight, I regained it. God has reconfirmed my calling." 
<BR><B>...From modest beginnings in 1991, when 4,200 men gathered, Promise Keepers has grown
into a 300-staff operation with a $64 million budget last year</B>. More than 725,000 men
attended 13 conferences in 1995. 
<BR><B>...Dates so far for the 1996 PK conferences are: Los Angeles, April 19-20; Seattle, April
26-27; Kansas City, Mo., April 26-27; Detroit, May 10-11; Minneapolis, May 10-11;
Washington, May 24-25; Boise, Idaho, June 7-8; Syracuse, N.Y., June 7-8; Charlotte, N.C.,

and Jacksonville, Fla., Oct. 18-19. The Minneapolis, Indianapolis, and Detroit events are sold

<B>Revival will sweep across America within the next few years and the current crop of young
people known as Generation X will be at its forefront</B>. That was the consensus among
speakers and strategists at the Atlanta '96 Youth Leaders Conference. The event brought
together more than 7,000 youth workers from more than 100 denominations and ministries
Feb. 11-12 in the Georgia Dome, making it the largest-ever such gathering of professional
and volunteer youth leaders, organizers said. Several days prior to the conference were
devoted to training sessions conducted at various hotels and convention sites around Atlanta
by three dozen denominations and ministries for their staffs and other youth workers.
Everyone joined together in the Georgia Dome for the final two days of the event. Hundreds
of ministries, colleges, publishers, service organizations, resort operators, and T-shirt vendors
set up display booths along the entire concourse that rings the stadium. 
<BR><B>...Participants rallied around a triple theme: awakening, renewal, and cooperation</B>. On the last
point, ministry leaders said they have agreed to work together to reach a common outreach
goal: Every Kid, Every Campus, Every Community. They have set up a database of 56,000
schools with students in the 6th grade or higher. As they identify schools where at least one
Christian club exists, they can coordinate Christian efforts on campus. 
<BR><B>...Personal renewal, with an emphasis on restoring relationships with God, one's spouse, and
family, was a prime topic in both the training tracks and main sessions</B>. The event concluded
as participants clustered in small prayer groups, led by Concerts of Prayer International
founder David Bryant, and with Los Angeles pastor E.V. Hill offering encouragement.
<BR><B>...Generation X youth have been misunderstood, abused, and oppressed, speaker after speaker
said</B>. "This generation has suffered more pain than any other before them," declared evangelist
Barry St. Clair of Reach Out Ministries. Yet they are the ones God will use to spark the
coming awakening, leaders said repeatedly. Revival expert Dann Spader of SonLife said
young people were involved in all five of America's great awakenings and led the last three.
<BR><B>...During the training-track phase, 80 United Methodist evangelical youth workers met
together for the first time</B>. Highlights included accounts of revival in some congregations. In a
joint meeting with 160 Catholic charismatics and a number of youth workers from charismatic
groups in mainstream denominations, the evening ended on a note of racial reconciliation.
Methodist renewal leader Gary Moore asked the blacks who were present to forgive white
Christians for the pain they have caused by their indifference and pride. Several blacks in turn
asked for forgiveness for their bitterness toward whites. Participants wept, hugged each other,
and prayed. 
<BR><B>...Nearly 10,000 teens and other young people flocked to a Saturday afternoon rally at the
Georgia Dome billed as a True Love Waits -- Thru the Roof celebration (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/091895.html">NIRR 9/18/95</A>)</B>.
Their leaders brought thousands of signed pledge cards from youth who have promised to
abstain from sex until marriage. The cards were added to almost 350,000 signed earlier by
others, about half from outside North America. Against a backdrop of cheers and music by
the Australian Christian pop group the Newsboys, the mounds of TLW cards were wired
together into a single snake-like stack and hoisted to the upper girders of the cavernous
stadium. The bottom of the stack was anchored to the stadium floor. A second stack reached
five stories high.
<BR><B>...True Love Waits founder Richard Ross, a Southern Baptist youth ministry executive,
announced a True Love Waits Goes Campus plan</B>. Under it, workers will train high school
and college students to use Christian clubs at their schools to coordinate abstinence campaigns
on their campuses. The campaign will culminate on Valentine's Day 1997, when students will
gather at a campus flag pole or some other meeting point and display the abstinence
commitment cards signed by those in their school, Ross said. NIRR 2/19/96
<P>
<B>A 50-day course is helping Christians to form good spiritual habits</B>. Some 450,000 Christians
in the United States, Canada, India, and Nepal are taking part this winter and spring in the
study, called a Spiritual Adventure. The Chapel Ministries, the Wheaton, Ill.-based parachurch
group formerly known as The Chapel of the Air, provides the materials and prepares pastors
at day-long conferences to guide their congregations in the studies. Starting Feb. 18,
participants will spend a total of at least 15 minutes a day praying, reading the Bible,
memorizing Scripture, and keeping a spiritual journal.
<BR><B>..."We know it changes lives," said Randall Mains of The Chapel Ministries, which has run
the course for 3 million participants in 20,000 different churches since 1980</B>. The spiritual
habits ordinarily are established within 50 days and often become a lifelong commitment, he
said. As discipline emerges, it replaces "spiritual apathy," he said. Also, hundreds of people
each year become Christians during the studies. 
<BR><B>...This year's theme is how to trust Christ when life gets confusing</B>. Many Christians are
hurried by modern life and don't leave enough time for relationships, God, and church, Mains

<B>Three states are considering laws to invalidate same-sex marriages performed in another state</B>.
No state now recognizes such unions. But lawmakers in California, Washington, and Idaho
said they are alarmed that Hawaii is considering making same-sex marriages legal, since
states ordinarily recognize marriages performed in other states. In California, Assemblyman
Pete Knight (R-Palmdale) warned that without a clear law homosexual couples would go to
Hawaii, get married, then return to demand that California recognize their unions. But
assemblyman Philip Isenberg (D-Sacramento) said the proposed bill infringes on the U.S.
Constitution, which requires states to recognize contracts made in other states. Proponents of
the measure said they are willing to take the question to the Supreme Court in order to affirm
the value of heterosexual marriage.
<BR><B>...Hawaii's Supreme Court agreed with three homosexual couples in 1993 that they had been
unconstitutionally denied marriage licenses (NIRR 5/2/94)</B>. The justices said the state must
show a compelling interest in banning such marriages and sent the case to a lower court for
trial, scheduled for July 15.                     
<BR><B>...Republican presidential candidates Pat Buchanan and Alan Keyes signed a pledge to oppose
legal recognition of same-sex marriages, and Bob Dole, Lamar Alexander, and Steve Forbes
promised to sign it</B>. Phil Gramm, who has dropped out of the race, also had signed the

<B>Four San Francisco area American Baptist churches may be removed from a regional
denominational group for their practice of "welcoming and affirming" homosexuals, news
reports said</B>. On Jan 6, delegates of the American Baptist Churches of the West voted
457-127 to exclude San Leandro Community Church, Lakeshore Avenue Baptist Church in
Oakland, First Baptist Church in Berkeley, and the New Community of Faith congregation in
San Jose. The four churches all belong to the Association of Welcoming and Affirming
Baptists, a group of several dozen ABC congregations involved in outreach to homosexuals.
The exclusion is scheduled for a vote by the ABC West's board of directors. Many American
Baptists are caught in the middle on this issue, disagreeing with the acceptance of
homosexuality, but defending the right of churches to minister as they see fit, according to
ABC spokesman Richard Schramm. NIRR 2/19/96

<B>The Charismatic Episcopal Church has grown to 165 congregations with 35,000 members</B>.

located in Europe, Hong Kong, and Africa.
<BR><B>...The CEC combines charismatic ministry with sacramental worship, biblical values, and
orthodox, evangelical teaching</B>. The denomination is not a reconfiguration of Protestantism as
much as a copy of the early church, according to Ken Tanner, communications director of the
San Celemente, Calif.-based denomination, told NIRR. Individual CEC congregations choose
the worship style or emphasis that best suits them, he said.
<BR><B>...Independent charismatics, Pentecostals, Episcopalians, Methodists, Wesleyans, Lutherans
and others are becoming part of the CEC, which began in 1992</B>. Episcopalians often join the
CEC because they appreciate a more spontaneous style of worship. Those from independent
backgrounds appreciate the church traditions and fellowship among congregations, CEC

according to news reports. Thousands of evangelical Protestant churches are scattered
throughout Guatemala, and in some remote areas, evangelicals outnumber Catholics. The
fervor of evangelical believers and the proliferation of their radio and TV broadcasts,
combined with the acknowledged apathy of Catholic leaders, has created the situation, news

<B>The Hindu Kingdom of Nepal has been "saturated with the gospel" in the past five years,
according to Luis Bush, International Director of AD 2000 and Beyond</B>. There are
300,000-400,000 Christians worshipping in 2,000 churches in the tiny Himalayan country,
Bush said. In 1991, Nepal had an estimated 50,000 Christians; in 1961 there were 25 known
believers (NIRR 8/12/91).
<BR><B>..."We have experienced a supernatural visitation</B>. There is just no other explanation," a Nepali
church leader said at an AD 2000-sponsored conference in India last month. Some 2,000
Himalayan church leaders came to describe the success of the gospel and to form plans for
evangelizing beyond their borders. 
<BR><B>...During years of persecution, Christians "paid the price for our nation</B>. Now it rightfully
belongs to us," said Reshem Raj Poudel, a former Hindu priest who became a Christian in
1962. He has been arrested 22 times and served two years in jail for teaching about Christ.
From 1961 to 1991, some 300-400 Christians were imprisoned for converting Hindus or
baptizing converts. Although Hinduism remains the state religion, a 1991 constitution granted
religious freedom and amnesty for all religious prisoners (NIRR 7/15/91). Proselytism still is

<B>The world's population of Christians grew from 1.93 billion to 1.95 billion in 1995, according
to the Global Evangelization Movement, a Richmond, Va.- based research group</B>. The figures
include nominal, affiliated, and practicing Christians, GEM's Justin Long told NIRR. Some
1.7 billion people are members of, or have been baptized into, a Christian church. Of those,
1.3 billion attend services, watch them on television, or listen on radio, Long said.
<BR><B>...Catholics are the largest Christian group, with 979 million adherents, followed by
Protestants with 373 million</B>. The figures are obtained through census information,
denominational figures, and estimations of believers who practice their faith in secret, GEM
said. 
<BR><B>...One-fifth of the world's population has not heard about Jesus Christ despite the efforts of
4,500 hundred missions agencies, 3,200 Christian broadcasting stations, and $10.5 billion
spent annually on world missions, Long said</B>. If trends continue, 16% of the world will be
unevangelized by the year 2000. "Many have been striving for world evangelization by the
year 2000, but clearly we won't make it short of divine intervention," he said. About 600
million people will remain unevangelized in 2025, and evangelization of the entire world
probably will not occur until midway through the 21st century, he said. NIRR 2/19/96

<B>Catholics and evangelicals in the Dominican Republic are working together to achieve fair
elections, said Jose Gonzalez of Semilla, a Virginia Beach-based ministry to Latin America</B>.
The leaders are part of The Group for Democratic Action, a coalition opposing President
Joaquin Balaguer's illegal attempts to retain power. In 1994, Balaguer won a seventh
four-year term in an election ridden with fraud, Gonzalez said. Under pressure from the
United States and threats of civil war, Balaguer agreed to hold another vote this year. But
when he changed his mind, religious and social leaders stepped forward.
<BR><B>..."History is being written in the Dominican Republic," Gonzalez told NIRR</B>. More than 150
religious and political leaders attended Evangelical Leadership and Democracy, a seminar
hosted by evangelical groups in January. Speakers included the head of the Catholic Bishop's
Conference, the rector of the Pontifical University, the head of the country's largest bank, and
the chief justice of the nation's highest court. "This is the first time in the history of Latin
America that Catholics and evangelical Protestants cooperated to provide leadership to assure
clean elections for their country," Gonzalez said. If this becomes a pattern, "there could be a
massive shift toward democracy in these countries." NIRR 2/19/96

<B>Romania will restrict religious radio broadcasts in at least three major cities this year</B>. In
January, the government announced it will amend broadcast licenses to disallow material of a
"confessional, spiritual" nature in Bucharest, Clug-Napoca, and Constanza. In the spring, it
will grant a license for one station in each city to broadcast religious programming, according
to information released by Law and Liberty Trust, an Annandale, Va., religious rights group.
The stations will have one owner, and only the 14 denominations recognized by the
government will have access to the station and the license competition. 
<BR><B>...The move could be an attempt to give the Orthodox Church priority over other
denominations, Paul Negrut of the Romanian Baptist Union said</B>. A statement from the
Romanian government said the action will create "necessary radio space" for the Orthodox
Church, whose programming is "less offensive" than that of other denominations. Evangelical
television programming has been virtually eliminated on public stations because it is
considered distasteful, Negrut said. He is concerned that licensing laws might give less time

groups have had off-campus dances for several years.
<BR><B>...Dancing can be a wholesome activity that allows young people to meet in a friendly
environment, said President Robert Sloan, a former student who met his wife at an
off-campus dance</B>. Baylor will not allow alcohol or "obscene or provocative" dancing, he said.
"We will make sure the security is good."
<P>
<B>A judge returned the fee that a Virginia man paid to his psychic</B>. Warren Smith of Roanoke
paid palm reader Lola Rose Miller $65,724 for providing six lottery numbers, which turned
out to be losers. Smith withdrew $29,000 from his Individual Retirement Account and
borrowed the rest from his father to pay Miller. Smith also sued for the $3 million grand
prize and $350,000 in punitive damages, but Circuit Judge Robert Doherty said giving Smith
any more money would be rewarding him for being gullible. Miller was released from prison
recently after serving a year for tax fraud and obtaining money by false pretenses. 
<P>
<B>More than 30,000 people attended 14 performances of a Christmas musical at Overland
Christian Church in Kirkland, Wash</B>. The church recorded 2,375 decisions for Christ at the
performances. When Seattle's CBS affiliate, Channel 11, televised the Broadway-style
musical, the church received 1,800 calls in 90 minutes. Some 115 callers made first-time
decisions for Christ, the church said. The musical is The Spirit of Christmas: The Living
Christmas Tree.
<P>
<B>A federal judge barred enforcement of an Illinois law requiring notification of a parent,
grandparent, or legal guardian before a minor can have an abortion</B>. Under the Parental Notice
of Abortion Act of 1995, teen-agers could go before a judge and seek a waiver allowing them
to bypass parental notification. But U.S. District Judge Paul Plunkett ruled that the law does
not provide a timely and confidential process for appealing the denial of a judicial waiver.
<P>
<B>The Pew Charitable Trusts gave a $3.3 million grant to the Candler School of Theology at
Emory University in Atlanta</B>. The grant will provide financial aid to Hispanic students and

given by Pew, news reports said.
<P>
<B>Federal agents confiscated 300 computers and arrested 11 members of the Interreligious
Foundation for Community Organization and Pastors for Peace (NIRR 2/21/94) at the United
States-Mexico border near San Diego, Calif</B>. The activists were trying to take the computers,
which were bound for Cuba, into Mexico without a permit, saying they were intended as
humanitarian aid. Police said the activists were violating the U.S. embargo against Cuba. 
<P>
<B>Chicago's first new Catholic high school in 33 years will open in September</B>. Cristo Rey
Jesuit High School will be co-educational with a college preparatory emphasis. Students will

program at Chicago-area companies one day a week, news reports said.

believes to be the only church in Antarctica. The chapel serves the 1,000 Americans at
McMurdo Sound military base, where isolation and separation from loved ones creates a
"human drama," Smith said. The beauty of the surroundings often leads "even the most

They "look at the incredible ice floes and mountains here and say: `There really is a God,

<B>Christians in a Houston neighborhood have mobilized aggressively to bring the gospel to all
100,000 of their neighbors</B>. Members of 47 churches in Houston Heights, a largely Hispanic
and African-American area, are providing a model of cooperation for other areas of the
country. 
<BR><B>..."It's miraculous what has been going on," said Duncan Ragsdale, who runs the Heights
Outreach coalition, which began in 1993</B>. Ministry opportunities have opened in parks,
schools, shopping centers, churches, the business and leadership community, neighborhoods,
and individual homes, he said. 
<BR><B>...Christians "have taken the responsibility to see that everybody in the Heights is exposed to
the gospel," Ragsdale said</B>. Outreaches include free dinners, Bible studies, and preaching
weekly in Love Park, Stude Park, Cottage Grove Park, and Monte Beach Park. For youth
there are after-school clubs, mentoring, tutoring, and sports in 17 schools. Other outreaches
include preaching, drama, and worship in malls and outside grocery stores; pastors' prayer
luncheons at churches; and gospel presentations at meetings of the Houston Heights
Association, the Citizens Patrol, the Rotary Club, and the Optimists Club. 
<BR><B>...Thirty-one "houses of prayer" -- families who pray regularly for 100 homes in their
neighborhood -- dot the area</B>. "Prayer is what cuts through" to make things happen, Ragsdale
said. A three-day national prayer-evangelism conference, co-sponsored by Ed Silvoso of
Harvest Evangelism (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/111795.html">NIRR 11/17/95</A>), is planned for May. The conference will feature
teaching sessions by international speakers. The musical Heal Our Land, composed by Jimmy
and Carol Owens, also will be presented.  
<BR><B>...Ministering to young people is a primary focus, Ragsdale said</B>. When a student drowned
during a school trip, prayer teams went to Hogg Middle School to help classmates deal with
the trauma. When crisis psychologists arrived, they realized they weren't needed and left, he
said. Heights Outreach holds school assemblies to persuade students to stay in school, and
those who do drop out may receive a home visit from a Christian, acting under the authority
of the Houston Independent School District. Christians are teaching job skills to gang
members, including 30 members of one gang who came to Christ last summer at a Heights
Outreach camp in Marble Falls, Texas.  
<BR><B>...Taking the gospel to people in their homes is another goal</B>. Heights Outreach is working
with the International Bible Society and Campus Crusade for Christ to get a Bible and a Jesus
video into every home in the area. The group also added a volunteer urban planner and an
architect to its staff, and is scheduling a series of town meetings to plot a strategy for
neighborhood growth. Plans also include planting 100 churches. NIRR 2/5/96

<B>A record crowd of more than 8,000 people from 27 states and three Canadian provinces
attended New England's annual Congress Jan</B>. 19-20 in Boston. The event, an
interdenominational gathering for worship, instruction, and networking, is unique in the
country and provides a yearly snapshot of New England's church life (NIRR 2/22/93). 
<BR><B>...This year's Congress was "by far the most significant" in its 36 years, said Steven Macchia,
president of the Evangelistic Association of New England, which organizes the event</B>. EANE
is a network of Christians from 79 denominations and many independent churches throughout
Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont.  
<BR><B>...Speakers included pastor Bill Hybels of Willow Creek Community Church in South
Barrington, Ill., who led a preconference seminar for 1,000 pastors; songwriter Gloria Gaither;
pastor Tony Evans of Oak Cliff Bible Fellowship in Dallas; Joni Eareckson Tada, president of
JAF Ministries, an outreach to the disabled; author and radio host Elisabeth Elliot; Macintosh
computer designer Guy Kawasaki, who urged more creativity in evangelism; pastor Tommy
Barnett of Phoenix's First Assembly of God; and author-speaker Jill Briscoe</B>. 
<BR><B>...Ministries to men and youth and increased interest in prayer have caused "deep and
significant" spiritual change in the region, Macchia said</B>. New England "is not exploding with
growth in every corner," but incremental growth is "transforming people's lives from the
inside out," he said. There is "a genuine changing of the landscape." NIRR 2/5/96
<P>
<B>More than 300 Episcopalians dedicated their lives to Christ at their church in Paoli, Pa.,
during a service Jan</B>. 14. "I was stunned," said David Thomas, interim rector at Church of the
Good Samaritan. With 1,800 members, the church is one of only a few conservative parishes
in the predominantly liberal Diocese of Philadelphia, he said. At the conclusion of his
sermon, Thomas spontaneously asked if anyone wanted to start the new year with Christ as
"Lord and Savior of their lives." He expected only a handful of the 600 present to come
forward, but "it was a stampede. Many confessed sin, wept about their need for God, and
asked for renewal through the power of the Holy Spirit." Thomas, who has been rector at
other large parishes, said this was the biggest public response to the gospel he could recall in
his 30-year ministry. NIRR 2/5/96

<B>American troops in Bosnia are receiving Bibles and devotional materials sent from U.S.-based
ministries</B>. Campus Crusade for Christ's Military Ministry in Virginia Beach provided about
1,000 Rapid Redeployment Kits to chaplains and units that are part of the NATO
peacekeeping force. The kits include a 90-day devotional, a presentation of the gospel, a tract
explaining salvation, and a pocket-sized New Testament, including Psalms and Proverbs. The
Bibles, which have a camouflage cover, and other materials are designed to help the troops
maintain their relationship with God and "make Him known to others," Military Ministry's
Steve Taylor told NIRR.  
<BR><B>...Other ministries also are supporting the troops and their families</B>. Englewood, Colo.-based
Officer's Christian Fellowship provides members with a ministry kit consisting of Bible
studies, Scripture cards, and materials designed to keep family relationships strong. "We try to
deal with subjects like combat, stress, and separation," said Deputy Executive Director Dick

<B>Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox believers formed a partnership to broadcast Christian
television to the Middle East and North Africa</B>. SAT-7 is a satellite channel that aims to
strengthen the faith of Christians and help others in the mostly Muslim region understand the
Christian faith. Although less than 5% of the 340 million people in the region are Christians,
90% own televisions. 
<BR><B>...The broadcasts will make a "unique contribution to the life and witness of local Christians,"
said Abu Rashaad, SAT-7's U.S.-based project officer</B>. In addition to strengthening the faith
and witness of the 20 million Christians in the Middle East, the broadcasts will help them
form a common identity and give them a voice in society, Rashaad said. The presence of
many indigenous Christians on the board of directors will ensure that the programming is
culturally sensitive. Rather than Western-style televangelism, programming will reflect the
"true life of the Middle Eastern church and address the everyday lives of Christians there,"
Rashaad told NIRR. 
<BR><B>...Twenty-five Christian agencies from Europe, North America, and the Middle East are
participating in the project</B>. Beginning this spring, SAT-7 will broadcast two hours of
programming a week to the 23 countries and increase that to two hours a day by the end of

<B>The Anglican Church's Decade of Evangelism has halted a 30-year slide in church

the church's national adviser for evangelism, said 102 churches where planted in the first

20% over the last three years, the report said. 
<BR><B>...Evangelicalism is the "largest, richest, and most influential Christian movement in England,"
according to The Daily Telegraph of London</B>. There are some 450,000 evangelicals in the
Anglican Church and 60% of graduates from its theological colleges are evangelical, up from
10% in the 1950s. While evangelicals used to be associated with "impertinent, Bible-swinging
North Americans," they now are accepted in society, the report said. Most evangelicals are
educated, middle-class suburbanites, it concluded. NIRR 2/5/96

(<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/041795.html">NIRR 4/17/95</A>). Kathy McKown, the mother of 11-year-old Ian Lundman of Independence,
Minn., treated him with prayer in accordance with her belief in spiritual healing. Douglass
Lundman, Ian's father, sued his ex-wife, her husband, a Christian Science nurse, and another

if he had been treated medically. There was no history of diabetes in the family and the
condition was not detected until an autopsy was performed.

serious illness to the proper authorities, despite the family's religious beliefs.

<B>Fifth-grader Joshua Burton can bring his Bible to school as long as it doesn't interfere with

Burton denied the allegation. His attorneys at Liberty Counsel, an Orlando rights group, said
he was reading the Bible before class.

<B>The Republican Party is wavering over its pro-life platform</B>. The GOP is divided between
those whose primary consideration is economics versus those who are most concerned about
moral issues such as abortion, according to Gary Bauer, head of Washington, D.C.-based

<B>Homosexual characters are appearing in more movies and TV shows, according to the Tupelo,
Miss.-based American Family Association and the Media Research Center in New York</B>. The
two conservative groups evaluate the content of television shows. Over the last two years, the
greatest increase has been in prime-time programming, MRC's Sandy Crawford told NIRR.  
<BR><B>..."Almost every week there is a new gay or lesbian movie," said Ted Baehr of the Christian
Film & Television Commission</B>. In the last year, about 40 films were released that either
advanced homosexual themes or featured a homosexual character, he said. Contrary to
"typical propaganda" from homosexual organizations, the movies do not fare well at the box
office, Baehr said. According to the CFTC's 1996 Annual Report to the Film Industry (NIRR
1/8), the average homosexual-theme film grossed $912,000; films with some element of
homosexuality grossed $11.46 million. In contrast, the average film considered "moral" by
CFTC standards grossed $44 million. Baehr presents the statistics to film industry executives
every year. 
<BR><B>...Homosexual characters introduce the lifestyle to viewers in order to make them feel
comfortable about it, the media watchdogs said</B>. The theme is not portrayed as "an issue to be
debated, but treated as a normal lifestyle," AFA's Randall Murphree said. NBC's Friends and
ABC's Roseanne portrayed homosexual weddings on their shows this season. But while the
shows promote homosexual rights and portray homosexual relationships and marriage as
positive, they ignore promiscuity and AIDS, Crawford said. 
<BR><B>...In response, the MRC has founded the Parent's TV Council, a pro-family lobby in
Hollywood</B>. The group will press for family-oriented entertainment. "A lot of it is just having
a presence and being able to talk with executives about our values," Crawford said. The group
will give Christians and pro-family people in the industry support to express their views.
More than a dozen Christian fellowships in Hollywood pray for the industry, Baehr said.

January, resulting in the arrest of church leaders, closure of at least six house churches, and
confiscation of hundreds of Bibles and pieces of Christian literature. The new order came in

acknowledge and confront the problem (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/101695.html">NIRR 10/16/95</A>). The United States "is the most
dominant country in world and when the U.S. speaks on these issues the results can be very
encouraging," NAE president Don Argue told NIRR.  
<BR><B>...Argue related his concerns to Clinton in an Oval Office meeting one week before releasing
the statement of conscience</B>. He described the persecution of Christians, particularly in Islamic

the NAE's statement, which include appointing a special adviser to the president for religious
liberty and rescinding foreign aid to countries that do not act to stop religious persecution.
Clinton did not respond with any specific policy proposals, but Argue said the president
listened intently and at one point told an aide, "We need to go to work on this." At the end of
the meeting Argue invited Clinton to address the issue at the NAE's convention March 3-5 in
Minneapolis.

Sierra Sandman. The group acts as an advocate for farm workers' rights.
<P>
<B>Night Talk with Luis Palau, a weekly half-hour television program, has begun airing Sundays
on the Faith & Values Network and Mondays on the Inspirational Network</B>. Viewers call in to
discuss spiritual and family concerns, and the evangelist explains the gospel and prays with

in need, producers said.
<P>
<B>Beginning this month, The Christian Broadcasting Network will telecast a Sunday version of
The 700 Club on the Family Channel in nine U.S</B>. cities; the show also will be seen on The

<B>Canada: Judge Edmond Cronin overturned as too restrictive a British Columbia law banning
protests outside abortion clinics</B>. The law, passed after an abortion doctor was shot in his
home by a sniper, banned peaceful protests, prayer, sign-carrying, and counseling within 150
feet of abortion clinics, 30 feet of the office of abortionists, and 480 feet of workers' homes.
The government is entitled to stop intimidation of staff and patients, but prohibiting protests
violates the right to freedom of expression, he said. British Columbia has not indicated
whether it will appeal the decision.
<P>
<B>The U.S</B>. Supreme Court refused to review Nebraska's request to restrict Medicaid abortion
funding to cases in which the woman's life is in danger. The justices refused to hear a similar
request from Colorado in December, and have yet to act on challenges by Pennsylvania and
Arkansas. The refusals do not set precedent, but are a sign that the high court is content to let
lower courts reject challenges to federal regulations on Medicaid abortions, observers said.
<P>
<B>Federal agents suspect arson in the burning of three black churches in impoverished rural
western Alabama, news reports said</B>. All the churches are within a six-mile radius of Boligee.
Two of them -- Little Zion and Mount Zoar -- burned the night of Jan. 11, the day that the
Sumter County Journal published a story about the sentencing of two vandals for smashing
pews, windows, and kitchen equipment at three other black churches last year in Coatopa, 20
miles away. Authorities investigating the fires are exploring a possible connection with arsons
at black churches in Tennessee (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/012296.html">NIRR 1/22</A>).
<P>
<B>A national toll-free hotline to report domestic abuse will open and publicize its number in
March, reports said</B>. The hotline, based in Austin, Texas, is funded by a $1 million federal
grant from last year's crime bill and matching private donations. 
<P>
<B>The city of San Francisco distributed a $65,000 grant to the local Salvation Army chapter
(<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/012296.html">NIRR 1/22</A>) after the charity assured the Board of Supervisors that it offers services to
anyone who needs help, including homosexuals</B>. The money was held up for two weeks after
a homosexual newspaper published a letter from a Salvation Army officer describing
homosexuality as "a serious threat to...society as a whole." 
<P>
<B>Interest in angels is developing into interest in the devil, Newsday said</B>. Books about Satan,
the dark sides of angels, and the origins of evil are the "hot button" in book publishing, said
Phyllis Tickle of Publishers Weekly. She traced much of the new interest to the success of
Anne Rice's novel Memnock the Devil last year. Still, the most popular religious subject for
readers last year was prayer, a survey found.
<P>
<B>Heavy snow collapsed the roof at St</B>. Philip's Episcopal Church in Harlem, N.Y., last month
causing $1.5 million in damages but no injuries. The collapse destroyed most of sanctuary
and covered the interior with snow and soot. St. Philip's was built in 1911.
<P>
<B>Mormonism is growing fast in the 1990s, but more slowly than in previous periods, according
to Sunstone, an independent Mormon magazine</B>. If the growth rate for the 1990s continues,
the Mormon Church's overall gain this decade would be 46%, compared with 67% in the
1960s and 73% in the 1980s. The slowdown may be a pause between growth spurts or an
indicator of organizational problems, according to the newsletter Religion Watch. Even the
slower rate of growth is in line with sociologist Rodney Stark's projections that the Mormon
church will grow between 30% and 50% per decade, resulting in a membership of 265
million by 2080.
<P>
<B>Some 5,300 evangelistic parties took place around the country during the Super Bowl,
according to Tom Felton, editor of Sports Spectrum magazine</B>. The parties included a
12-minute video featuring Christian testimonies by Steve Wallace and Brent Jones of the San
Francisco 49ers. In some cities, churches collaborated to hold large parties, some with several
thousand people. 
<P>
<B>Tens of thousands of abortion protesters converged outside the U.S</B>. Supreme Court building
Jan. 22 to mark the 23rd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. U.S.
Park Police and Supreme Court officers estimated the crowd at 60,000, up from 35,000 last
year. Organizers estimated the crowd at 125,000. "If you believe it's wrong, you can't give
up," Dolores Miller of Seaside Park, N.J., said. The March for Life Fund has organized the
event since the court's 1973 decision. A White House spokesman said President Clinton
hopes Americans will "minimize hostility and violence and maximize understanding and
common ground" on the issue.

<P>
<B>Germany: Catholic priest and one-time theology professor Hans Kung retired from teaching

<B>Italy: A swindler on the run from police was found posing as a monk at a Naples monastery</B>.
The other monks began to suspect Constantine Drago because he kept a stereo and color
television in his room. When police searched the room, they found a wall safe full of other

eastern Romania, was founded in 1685. Closed for 30 years under Communist rule, the

<B>Vatican: Pope John Paul II reiterated his call for a dialogue among Christians regarding the
future role of the papacy</B>. He urged Protestant and Orthodox leaders to search for ways that
the role of the papacy can be "recognized by one and all." Christian unity does not mean "flat
uniformity" of religion, he said.

<B>Christians in racially polarized Fayetteville, N.C., shine candles in their windows all year to
"symbolize the fires of revival in their souls</B>." When they see other candles around town, they
pray for blessings on each others' homes. And at 8 p.m. each night, they pray for their city.
Larry Jackson, the local pastor who started the movement, said believers from 20
congregations are participating. They say they'll keep the lights burning until they illuminate
every part of Fayetteville, Jackson told NIRR. 
<BR><B>...A recent double murder deepened the resolve of local Christians to see revival and
reconciliation in their city</B>. Police said three white soldiers from the U.S. Army's 82nd
Airborne Division at nearby Fort Bragg drove into the predominantly black Campbell Terrace
section of Fayetteville last month to harass blacks. Specialist Randy Meadows waited in the
car as Privates Malcolm Wright and James Burmeister picked victims at random and shot
them, police said. Killed were Jackie Burden, 27, and her friend Michael James, 36. The
soldiers were arrested quickly, and in Burmeister's rented room police found white
supremacist literature and a pistol they believe was used in the killings. 
<BR><B>...Fayetteville could have exploded after the "appalling tragedy," said Lee Downing, pastor of
Friendship Baptist Church, located two blocks from the site of the killings</B>. But it didn't. The
quick arrests helped quell tempers, said Downing, who is African-American. And the unity
among black and white pastors in the city allowed them to work together to help keep
Fayetteville calm. Also, the NAACP organized a forum for community leaders and citizens.  
<BR><B>...Downing and a white pastor organized a reconciliation service the following Sunday</B>. Under
the glare of the network television lights, more than 800 residents from every denomination,
political party, and race in Fayetteville overflowed the church to air their emotions. "Three
came into the neighborhood for hate, but 800 came out for healing," said Michael Fletcher of
Manna Church, Downing's white colleague and friend who helped organize the service.
Georgia Burden, Jackie Burden's aunt, spoke of forgiving the young soldiers and not hating
them. "When those who were the most injured talked about forgiveness, that was the impetus
for reconciliation," Downing said. 
<BR><B>...One of the most important steps is renewal among Fayetteville pastors, a process that is
continuing</B>. The city's business community is paying travel and admission expenses for 95
pastors to attend the Promise Keepers' clergy conference in Atlanta Feb. 13-15. This month,
Promise Keepers videotaped Jackson's and Fletcher's story of the candles and their city's
revival, which will be shown to encourage the pastors who will gather in the Georgia Dome.
This spring, North Carolina pastors will meet in Charlotte to plan for a statewide revival.       
<BR><B>..."We are going to see revival come to Fayetteville or die trying," Fletcher said</B>. A year ago,
he began working with other churches to hold racial reconciliation rallies in Campbell
Terrace. They also built playgrounds and installed peepholes in doors. In July, Fletcher and
others began prayer walks through the complex. "God, either save the drug dealers or take
them out of our town," they prayed. Within a month, God acted, Fletcher said. "The cops
began rounding [the drug dealers] up and putting them in jail." Fletcher and Downing have
organized more evangelistic outreaches in the neighborhood, including an interracial block
party held a few days before the killings. NIRR 1/22/96

<B>MAD DADS has grown to 25,000 members at 45 chapters in 13 states</B>. The men patrol urban
neighborhoods late at night to minister to runaways, drug users, and gang members. MAD
DADS stands for Men Against Destruction, Defending Against Drugs and Social Disorder. 
<BR><B>...Most of the men patrol in pairs on Friday and Saturday nights</B>. In Omaha, Neb., where the
group originated in 1989 with 18 dads, they venture out in green and black T-shirts from 10
p.m. to 4 a.m., said John Gatus, who supervises the patrols. The men report crime and drug
sales to authorities and offer to talk with parents or school counselors about the young people.
In cold or rainy weather, the men drive rather than walk around the neighborhoods. 
<BR><B>..."We tell them we love them," Gatus told NIRR</B>. "A lot of kids are out there because they
need love." The men approach each situation with a smile and a "hello" rather than an
attempt to intimidate the young people, said Gatus, 56, who has been patrolling for six years.
Yet they are respected, and sometimes challenge the behavior of drug dealers and gang
members. "Boys respect men," Gatus said. 
<BR><B>...Most of the men are Christians</B>. "We know we can't do the work without Christ," Gatus
said. Each night before going out on the streets, the men hold hands in a circle and pray; they
pray again before returning home. No one has been killed during a patrol, said Gatus, who

<B>A Nigerian couple have become missionaries to Chicago, representing the fruit of missionary
work begun 68 years ago</B>. Sunday Bwanhot, who moved to Chicago with his wife, Grace, and
their three sons last summer, is the great-grandson of Aluwong Benyan, chief of a Kagoro
village when SIM missionaries first visited there in 1927. Bwanhot worked at the
headquarters of the Evangelical Church of West Africa, the denomination that grew out of
SIM work in Nigeria, before coming to Chicago.  
<BR><B>...Bwanhot resisted coming to the West</B>. "I had heard a bit about Chicago and I didn't like the
idea at all," he told SIM NOW. "Like Jonah, I found that the more I struggled to say no, the
more I did not have the peace of God." One problem was raising money. The average
Nigerian earns about $20 a month while airfare alone for the family was $4,000. They
continue to raise support. 
<BR><B>...African-Americans attempting to understand their roots "have been deceived" into believing
that Islam is the original religion of Africa, Bwanhot said</B>. "That's really something which
only we Africans can set straight." NIRR 1/22/96

Algeria, Indonesia, Turkey, Pakistan, and other predominantly Muslim countries. It provides
details about the Islamic faith and Ramadan -- the high point of the Muslim calendar -- in
order to help Christians understand what Muslims believe and help dispel simplistic and
prejudicial views about them. This year's prayer guide focuses on children and families,
especially appropriate in light of a United Nations report showing that most of the world's

<B>An influx of evangelical missionaries into Albania in this decade has resulted in many new
believers who are having a significant impact on society</B>. "Evangelical services have no
trouble drawing a large crowd," said Art Moore of International Teams, an umbrella agency
for 26 evangelical groups. In five years, 100 evangelical fellowships have formed with 8,000
regular attenders, a quarter of whom are committed believers, he said. The growth is the work
of 500 missionaries from 72 missionary societies, most from Western countries. They serve
through the Albanian Encouragement Project (NIRR 5/4/92), which provides resources for
missions work around the country. 
<BR><B>...The new believers have exercised influence in healthcare, education, law, and business,
Moore told NIRR</B>. For example, two evangelical lawyers helped form the country's new
judicial system.  
<BR><B>...Youth dominate the evangelical movement because "most parents say they are too old to
change," Moore said</B>. Groups such as Youth With A Mission, the Assemblies of God, and the
Albanian Bible Institute are developing young leaders for churches. Last year, churches and
schools across the country used the Alliance Youth Network's program for encouraging
young people to resist sexual immorality, he said.  
<BR><B>...Yet no evangelical church has been erected in the capital, Tirana, Moore said</B>. Presbyterian
missionary John Quanrud tried for months to gain permission to construct a church building,
but objections from a Muslim neighbor delayed the plan. While conceding the congregation's
legal right to build a church, a government official objected "from a moral point of view."
Some officials are calling for laws to restrain evangelicals while giving autonomy to Muslims,
the Orthodox, and Catholics. NIRR 1/22/96

<B>A minister is freeing slave girls from voodoo priests in Ghana</B>. Walter Pimpong, a native
Ghanian and graduate of Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Ill., travels on the
Volta River preaching and freeing girls who are shrine slaves of fetish priests. When a person
becomes sick or a village is troubled, the priest concludes there is a curse on them and
announces that the only way to appease the gods is to give him a vestal virgin as young as
age 12. There are hundreds of such girls and some bear as many as eight children by the
priests, a Ghanian newspaper said. 
<BR><B>...Pimpong risks physical harm and persecution as he brings the young women, many of
whom have been slaves for 15 years, to his school in Adidome</B>. There they are taught trades
such as dressmaking, mat-weaving, and baking, and learn the Bible. The goal is to liberate
them economically and spiritually from the priests. Last year, 23 women graduated from the
school. Family pressure forces some to return to the priests, but most remain free. Pimpong
hopes to build schools in areas where the priests are most active. One priest asked to hear
about Christ, but another offers sacrifices daily for Pimpong's destruction. NIRR 1/22/96

<B>Christians in China step up their evangelistic efforts from January to Chinese New Year, Feb</B>.
18, Jim Swanson of the Hong Kong-based Asian Outreach told NIRR. Swanson visited Henan
and Hunan provinces, key areas of Christian activity in the country, and met with 50
ministers and church leaders.  
<BR><B>...Some Chinese house churches compel members to evangelize during the Month of the
Gospel, Swanson said</B>. "Every church member is required during this month to win one
family to the Lord and bring them to church," he said. One church pastor said he will not
give communion to members who fail to convert a new family. The churches also
commission evangelists to plant new congregations during this time. People in their late teens
and early 20s are trained to be missionaries, sent out with a one-way ticket to wherever they
feel called, and expected to start at least one church in six months, Swanson said. Last year,
the young evangelists planted some 56 churches in Manchuria. 
<BR><B>...A pastor thought he should plant a church in the province, which is closed to the gospel</B>.
Later an opportunity arose for 15 evangelists to travel to a northern Manchurian city. Six
months later the city had 18 churches, with 38 more in the surrounding villages and cities.
The smallest church has 200 people and five Manchurians are being taught to train leaders for
the new churches. Most Chinese Swanson met have been Christians for only a few years and
have received little or no formal training, he said. When he asked them how they learned
principles of church planting and church growth, they told him, "The Holy Spirit reveals these
methods to us in prayer." NIRR 1/22/96

<B>Thousands of Brazilians took to the streets to protest a government investigation into their
church</B>. According to news reports, 100,000 to 200,000 supporters of the Universal Church of
the Kingdom of God in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Brasilia, the capital, marched, sang
hymns, and spoke out against the government and Globo TV, a Catholic-run television
station. Globo aired a videotape of UCKG leaders gleefully counting donations and instructing
others to intimidate followers into giving more, news reports said (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1996/010896.html">NIRR 1/8</A>). The videotape
was made by former UCKG minister Carlos Magno, who has been cooperating with tax
officials since 1991 in an investigation of the church. 
<BR><B>...The 3.5 million-member church has 1,800 temples in Brazil and 300 more in 30 other
countries, including the United States</B>. The church also owns a Brazilian TV network, a bank,
35 radio stations, and four newspapers. With the cooperation of Interpol, the international
police agency, Brazilian authorities also are looking into church business deals in Portugal,
Colombia, Japan, Mozambique, France, South Africa, the Cayman Islands, and the United
States. One of Magno's most serious allegations is that the church once solicited $1 million
from the Colombian Cali drug cartel to finance the purchase of its TV network.  
<BR><B>...Church officials have withdrawn their support from President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
because of the investigation</B>. The church supported the right-wing president's election in 1994,
but began seeking alliances with left-wing political parties earlier this month. Two parties
rejected the church's proposal, but another is considering it. The proposal was "a mixture of
opportunism and undue interference by religious organizations into affairs of state," a leader
of the Popular Socialist Party said. In Honduras, the government is seeking to expel 29
UKCG ministers because they are living illegally in the country and are "carrying out work
different from the tourism activities they declared when they arrived," a government official
said. The Brazilians are operating as pastors and participating in radio programs, they said.

<B>Older members of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) read the Bible more frequently than
younger members, a denominational poll found</B>. Fifty-two percent of church members 70 and
older said they read the Bible at least weekly in the past year, compared to 29% of members
under 40. As for the youngest generation, 6% said they regularly read the Bible to children
during the past year other than as part of a church class. Nearly all of those surveyed said
they read the Bible on their own during the past year, and about two-thirds of pastors said
they read Scripture daily or almost daily, according to poll findings reported by the
Associated Press. Twenty-one percent of church members said they occasionally read the
Bible or a Bible story book to a child during the past year, and 11% of households that have
other family members said they read Scripture together. 
<BR><B>..."The general paucity of family Bible reading is one of the more striking findings of this
study," said the church's Office of Research Services</B>. While that fact is "not all that
surprising," nevertheless it "tells us that the church cannot rely on family-based Bible study in
any significant way to reinforce the lessons it is trying to teach," the group said. NIRR

Protestant areas in the south "gave a lopsided vote for Kwasniewski," Doug Larson of Youth
With A Mission-Poland told NIRR. 
<BR><B>...Under communism, Protestants were regarded as collaborators with the government because
they often were given land to build churches and allowed to receive Western aid, Larson said</B>.
When Walesa was elected president in 1991, Protestants say he threatened to rid the country
of all sects and Protestant denominations. One Pentecostal pastor told Larson that he would
get a fair deal from Kwasniewski, who promised Protestants equal protection under the law. 
<BR><B>...Most Poles say the Catholic church has gained too much influence over government, and

<B>The United States may be "in an Abraham moment," Republican presidential candidate Alan
Keyes is telling audiences</B>. The moral state of the country is so precarious that the only thing
restraining God's judgment is the plea of the righteous, similar to Abraham's prayers for
Sodom, Keyes said. Violence in cities and schools, social engineering, and abuses of science,
such as medical research with human fetuses, reveal the moral corruption in America, he said.
<BR><B>...The arrogance of people who hold God's laws in contempt while asserting their own desires
has caused the situation, Keyes said</B>. "Satan's sin was to [try to] be better than God, to take
His place," he told NIRR. "That hubris is clearly evidenced in our time." 
<BR><B>...America's moral crisis can be corrected only by returning to principles found in the
Declaration of Independence, which states that human rights are granted by God, Keyes said</B>.
By denying God's authority "we deny the source of that which guarantees our freedom in the
eyes of men." The Declaration is a "political expression of Christianity" because it bases
justice and human rights on inalienable, God-given rights, he said. 
<BR><B>...Keyes' opposition to abortion initially motivated him to consider a bid for the presidency to
protect the pro-life plank in the Republican Party platform from being weakened or removed,
he said</B>. Keyes' message that abortion is a moral crisis that has "destroyed family life and
unleashed a curse of violence in the streets" has struck a chord with many conservative
Christians. After a speech on James Dobson's Focus on the Family radio program, thousands
of phone calls and letters flooded the Focus office and Keyes' home. He and his wife read the
letters together. "It was a spiritual experience to hear from people grieving for the country.
We felt God was moving," Keyes said. It confirmed his decision to run for president. 
<BR><B>...Keyes, who is Catholic, credits his mother for teaching him the faith</B>. "Her relationship with
Christ was important to her and she passed that along," he said. Resolving a crisis of faith in
graduate school solidified his relationship with God. Keyes, who earned a doctorate in
government affairs from Harvard University, said academic life is designed to challenge faith
and can lead to apostasy. His mother reminded him that "no matter how much knowledge you
have, you must not lose the simple wisdom of a relationship with God," he said. NIRR

<B>An outspoken California minister has been charged with assaulting a police officer by fax in
order to help a child</B>. Austin Miles (NIRR 3/21/94) was arraigned last month in Delta
Municipal Court in Pittsburg, Calif., on charges that he published a policeman's home
address, a form of assault in violation of a 1970 state law, news reports said. He pleaded
innocent and declined to comment on the charge as about 30 supporters gathered at the
courthouse to pray for him. A hearing is set for Feb. 1. 
<BR><B>...Miles sent a 26-page fax to several thousand people nationwide</B>. It describes the plight of
6-year-old leukemia patient Adrian Chavez. The boy was taken from his home in August by
Child Protective Service officials and Sheriff's Deputy Charles Mould. He was placed in
protective custody when county officials believed his mother, Elena Duarte, was refusing to
bring him for more chemotherapy at Oakland Children's Hospital. Duarte wanted to keep him
home and treat him with herbs and vitamins, reports said. Chavez was returned to his home
after Duarte agreed to take him for chemotherapy. He reportedly has been receiving
treatments when his immune system is strong enough. 
<BR><B>...The minister contends he was trying to save Chavez' life</B>. He is a prostate cancer survivor
who resisted doctors' pressure several years ago to undergo chemotherapy and radiation -- a
decision that he believes saved his life. He said he has performed two funerals for people he
believes were killed by chemotherapy. Miles, 62, a burly, white-bearded man who plays Santa
Claus at County East Mall every year, helped organize rallies for Chavez and published
information about the child in his nationally distributed newsletter, The Connecting Link. He
is former pastor of the now-defunct Oasis of Faith Church.   
<BR><B>...Miles is charged with publishing deputy Mould's home address</B>. News reports said the fax
also listed the names, home addresses, phone numbers, and political affiliations of a child
welfare worker and two juvenile court referees involved in the Chavez case. Mould has
received threatening messages and mail, police said. 
<BR><B>...Miles' attorney Neal Hogan said other people embellished the fax, which was not malicious,
and sent out doctored versions</B>. Hogan said his client's words constituted political speech and
that constitutional protections override the law banning publishing a police officer's address.

Blake. Gaines, who is black, said his ministry will emphasize racial reconciliation and cultural
diversity.

<B>Canada: The Toronto Blessing church has a new name</B>. After its separation from the
Association of Vineyard Churches (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/122595.html">NIRR 12/25/95</A>), The Toronto Airport Vineyard became
The Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship. The church is beginning a 15-minute daily radio
broadcast. Catch the Fire will feature testimonies, interviews, news of renewal,
announcements of upcoming events, and recordings of renewal services. The program will be
heard on WHLD 1270-AM in Grand Isle, N.Y., and on CJMR 1320-AM in Oakville, Ont.,
beginning Jan. 22; it is available for syndication. For information, call (905) 528-5375.

<B>It took a preacher to calm shoppers fighting over scarce supplies in a New Jersey supermarket
as a massive snowstorm hit the East Coast</B>. As the Bloomfield A&P ran out of milk and bread
Jan. 7, customers shouted and "started to get wild," store manager Louis Carlos said. The
incident could have been worse if not for a man who said he was a preacher and volunteered
to speak on the intercom, news reports said. "In his calm voice he soothed the angry crowd,"
the manager said. "We would have liked to thank him, but he disappeared." 
<P>
<B>Some 22.8% of pastors have been fired or forced to leave their churches at least once in their
career, and one in four of those has had the experience more than once, a study by
Leadership Journal and Christianity Today, Inc., found</B>. Sixty-two percent of the discharged
pastors said the church that let them go was a "repeat offender" and had fired at least one
previous pastor.
<P>
<B>A prayer liturgy for Christians and Jews to use in joint, informal services in homes, churches,
or synagogues aims to avoid diluting beliefs or minimizing differences</B>. The liturgy was
written by Leon Klenicki of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and Bruce Robbins
of the United Methodist Commission on Christian Unity. It is published by the Catholic
Archdiocese of Chicago.
<P>
<B>The 23rd annual March for Life was set for Jan</B>. 22 in Washington, D.C. Marchers planned to
rally on the ellipse in front of the White House, then proceed along Constitution Avenue to
the Capitol and Supreme Court. Sponsors estimated last year's attendance at 100,000. The
first March for Life was held in 1974 to protest the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing
abortion.  Eight historically black denominations called for a day of prayer and reflection to
mark the April 4 anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. This year, the
day falls on the Thursday before Easter. Leaders of the coalition, called the Congress of
National Black Churches, hope to make the observance an annual event.
<P>
<B>Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, Ga., a Presbyterian school, is beneficiary of a
$55 million trust</B>. Atlanta businessman J. Bulow Campbell established the trust 60 years ago
to provide for his wife and daughter when he died. It was bequeathed to the seminary this fall
after the death of his daughter, his sole heir. The income will add to the school's endowment,
staff a Center for New Church Development, and increase student scholarships and financial
aid.
<P>
<B>Pediatricians want a court order to block an abortion clinic from opening an office in their
suburban Chicago building</B>. Doctors from Pediatric Health Care Associates in Arlington
Heights, Ill., said opening the clinic would be "an exercise in bad taste" that would "greatly
disturb" their patients and families, news reports said. The doctors said they also are afraid
that protesters would pose a security risk to their patients.  
<P>
<B>The San Francisco Board of Supervisors held up $65,000 in federal funds earmarked for The
Salvation Army</B>. The cause was a letter written by local Army administrator Capt. Samuel
Southard to a local homosexual newspaper, the Bay Area Reporter. In it, Southard quoted a
Salvationist position statement calling homosexuality "deviant" and contrary to the Bible,
news reports said. "The Salvation Army does not discriminate, period," said Maj. Jerry
Gaines. He said Southard's letter confused the Army's social mission with its "internal
religious beliefs," reports said.    
<P>
<B>The Illinois Riverboat Gaming Council, a trade group that represents the interests of riverboat
gaming operators, said it is trying to promote responsible gambling</B>. Cost of the initiative was
not revealed, but $500,000 was donated to set up a help line for compulsive gamblers. 
<BR><B>...Critics called the initiative a trick to win favor with politicians and the public</B>. Doug
Dobmeyer, legislative chair of the Religious Task Force to Oppose Increased Legalized
Gambling, said the funding is "insufficient and meaningless for the growing needs of
compulsive gamblers in the state."

<B>Zimbabwe: Pastor Richmond Chiundiza started a church in Harare after attending a seminar
on church planting organized by Discipling A Whole Nation movement</B>. Soon 700 people
crowded into the rented theater where he held services, DAWN said. Fearing a catastrophe,
the fire chief ordered Chiundiza to restrict attendance. The pastor told 100 of his congregants
to plant a new church, but another 100 soon took their place, forcing him to send out 100
others to plant another church. So far, the main church has planted 11 congregations, DAWN
said.

<B>India: Abortions of healthy female fetuses have been banned</B>. The law is an attempt to stop
the widespread practice of aborting female fetuses in the male-dominated culture. The law
carries a three-year prison sentence and $300 fine for a first offense, and five years in prison
and a $1,500 fine for subsequent offenses. Mothers, doctors, and fathers can be prosecuted.
Males in India are more highly valued because they bring a dowry, news reports said.

<B>More and more Muslims are having dreams and visions of Christ, Christian ministries say</B>.
There is increasing evidence that the supernatural is playing a role in drawing Muslims to
Christ, they say. 
<BR><B>...Campus Crusade for Christ has received thousands of letters from Muslims, many of whom
claim to have had a similar dream of Christ, according to the ministry's radio broadcast office
in northern Africa</B>. In the dream, Jesus appears and tells people, "I am the way," Campus
Crusade founder and president Bill Bright said. Moved by the dreams, they contact the radio
ministry and "freely respond" to the gospel message, he said. In Algeria, an imprisoned
Muslim political radical said Jesus appeared to her in her cell. The woman now is a Christian
and works with Campus Crusade ministering to Muslims.                                      
<BR><B>...In one African Muslim country, a young man violently tore up a Bible tract and threatened
the life of the Every Home For Christ worker going door-to-door with the literature, Dick
Eastman of Colorado Springs-based EHFC told NIRR</B>. The next afternoon as the worker sat
in his home, he was shocked to see the man knock at his door. "I must have another booklet,"
the Muslim told him. He explained that the previous night two hands awakened him, and
when he turned on a light and asked who was there, a voice said, "You have torn up the
truth." The voice instructed him to acquire another booklet, directing him to the EHFC
worker's home, the young man said. There, the Muslim read the booklet and became a
believer. He has since been expelled from his wealthy family, lives with EHFC's Africa
director, and is preparing for ministry to Muslims.  
<BR><B>...In another incident, several EHFC workers were distributing literature in a marketplace</B>. A
man who received a booklet gasped and said he had a vision of the person pictured on the
cover in his dream the night before, Eastman said. In the dream, the man was in a deep pit
when a rope was thrown to him and two strong hands pulled him up. Upon climbing out, he
looked into the face of the man who helped him: Jesus. The workers explained the meaning
of the dream and the man was converted on the spot. Later, three other people recounted the
same dream and two of them became Christians, Eastman said. God is preparing Muslims,
and Christian workers follow through, he said.                                                   
<BR><B>...In Kawuri, Nigeria, a Christian was beaten nearly to death by his tribe for leaving Islam,
according to Open Doors With Brother Andrew</B>. As the man lay close to death, he asked God
to forgive his attackers, unaware that they were listening in the next room. That night, two
Islamic priests who participated in the beating had visions. One said Jesus showed him his
three greatest and most private sins. The next day, the two mullahs repented and led 80
followers to a church, the Santa Ana, Calif.-based group said. 
<BR><B>..."Increased prayer on the home front" has had a large impact, Assemblies of God missionary
Gordon Barnett said</B>. Supernatural incidents playing a part in conversion have increased over
the past 10 years due to more prayer, he said. Barnett, who has lived in the Middle East for
24 years, credited several prayer initiatives. They are the AG's Center for Ministry to
Muslims, which has 500,000 people who pledge to pray for the Muslim world every Friday;
AD 2000's Praying Through the Window (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/100295.html">NIRR 10/2/95</A>), which calls millions of Christians
to pray for several Muslim countries each October; and Youth With A Mission's 30 days of
prayer during Ramadan (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/020695.html">NIRR 2/6/95</A>). 
<BR><B>...Muslims who have such dreams or visions of Christ usually have had a Christian contact
and are looking for spiritual answers, said one Assemblies of God missionary and
anthropologist who has worked for 10 years in the Middle East and Northern Africa</B>. "It all
takes place in context -- dreams are one step, a link in the chain" that leads to conversion, he
said. God is using people as well as the supernatural to draw people to Him, he said.

<B>A total of 5,000 Christians in Washington state have signed covenants committing themselves
to pray for revival until it occurs</B>. They participated in meetings held during October in 23 of
the state's cities and towns. The gatherings, called Washington Awakening, were led by
Youth With A Mission Renewal Ministries leader Ron Boehme and David Bryant of Concerts
of Prayer International. The Life Action Singers presented the multi-media production
America, You're Too Young to Die! 
<BR><B>...Pastors involved in Washington Awakening plan to preach about revival to their
congregations</B>. "Momentum in prayer needs to be matched by momentum in preaching,"
Bryant told NIRR. Pastors must become "messengers of hope," giving their congregants a
sense that God is not yet finished with the United States, he said. 
<BR><B>...The pastors also will ask their congregants to sign the covenants</B>. The Washington
Consultation on United Prayer, an interdenominational leaders' prayer network, said it hopes
100,000 Christians in the state will be praying regularly for revival by the end of the year.
W-CUP also will encourage interchurch prayer meetings and involvement in other prayer and
revival movements. Ongoing 24-hour prayer chains began as a result of the campaign and are
expanding, Boehme said. 
<BR><B>...The intensity of response to the campaign surprised many people, including its leaders</B>. The
Northwest is one of the country's toughest spiritual areas, and the only region that never has
seen a historic revival, said Boehme, who organized Washington Awakening. The church
there is small but vibrant, and prayer movements have been expanding, he said. NIRR 1/8/96

<B>The Seventh-day Adventist Church will try to top last year's evangelistic effort with an even
larger campaign this fall</B>. Evangelist Mark Finley will preach during Net '96, a 26-day
campaign in October to be uplinked by satellite from the Forest Lake Academy auditorium in
Orlando, Fla. Finley has preached in Eastern Europe and directs the denomination's It Is
Written television ministry. 
<BR><B>...Two thousand Adventist churches in the United States and Canada will participate,
according to Monte Sahlin, assistant to the president for the North American Division</B>. The
program will be shown live on large screens in community centers, meeting halls, school
gymnasiums, and church sanctuaries. Pastors and lay leaders are training to counsel those who
respond to invitations during local crusade meetings. Also, neighborhood Bible studies will be
formed, with the goal of attracting 1 million unchurched people to small-group studies this
year, Sahlin told NIRR. Some 700 churches were involved in Net '95, resulting in at least
5,000 people being baptized, he said. 
<BR><B>...The campaign parallels similar outreaches in other denominations</B>. Adventists maintain some
contact with other Protestant groups, but are concerned that the ecumenical approach some
churches embrace "tends to water down the clear teaching of the Word," Sahlin said. Liberal
Protestant churches are "not oriented toward the kind of Bible preaching we do," and many
conservative churches hold views that conflict with Adventist teachings, he said. Two
prominent Adventist distinctives are the necessity for the observance of the sabbath on
Saturday and the belief that the souls of the deceased sleep in the grave until the resurrection,
he said. NIRR 1/8/96

<B>Reinhard Bonnke plans to reach 112 million homes in the United States and Canada with the

three years ago to cover Europe and North America with the gospel (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/061295.html">NIRR 6/12/95</A>). 
<BR><B>...Local church participation is key to the campaign</B>. In the United States, Bonnke hopes to
enlist 50,000 churches that will follow up on individuals who mail response cards. His
ministry will mail a letter to each respondent directing him or her to the nearest church
participating in the outreach. It also will send a letter notifying the pastor of the response.
Bonnke is relying on donations from churches to help defray the $67 million cost of paper,

<B>Some 1,000 high school students from 32 states gave up part of their Christmas vacations to

prayed, became familiar with various Christian organizations, and prepared themselves for
evangelism, said Chuck Klein, executive director of Campus Crusade's Student Venture,
which organized the event. Klein also directed Something's Happening USA. 
<BR><B>..."This generation is the most attacked and abused of the 13 generations we've had in
America," Klein told NIRR</B>. "God has a special plan for them -- that is why they are under
attack from the enemy." Speakers Josh McDowell, former San Diego Charger Miles
McPherson, and Kay Arthur of Precept Ministries challenged the students to give up
hindrances to their relationship with Christ and to honor their parents. They also participated
in a two-hour concert of prayer that leader David Bryant described as the most powerful
event he ever had witnessed involving high school students.  
<BR><B>...During the conference, a young white man from Alabama took the stage and repented to
Detroit pastor Haman Cross, who is black, for racism among his family and ancestors, who
had owned slaves</B>. In response, Cross got on his knees and asked for forgiveness for blacks
who had been "reactive racists," Klein said. Others also confessed racism, lust, and gossip. At
another point, students filled a 50-gallon trash can with CDs and other things they said were
hindering their spiritual growth. "It was as if they had been released and strongholds had been
broken," Klein said.

<B>April 14 will be world evangelism's landmark day, predicted Billy Graham</B>. That's the
culmination of the evangelist's Global Television Series, designed to spread the gospel to
nonbelievers in every country of the world. "I believe this will have a far greater impact than
anything we have ever done before," he said. 
<BR><B>...The GTS campaign begins early in April, when two Christian films will be broadcast
prime-time in 42 languages</B>. The Minneapolis-based Billy Graham Evangelistic Association
arranged for national television networks in more than 160 countries to air one of two
hour-long features produced by the BGEA's WorldWide Pictures: Cry From the Mountain
and PowerPlay. Many of the foreign nations bartered free air time for use of the films. Each
TV broadcast will include promotional announcements for an April 14 special program. 
<BR><B>...GTS peaks with a telecast featuring a prerecorded evangelistic message by Graham</B>. The
special will be hosted by British pop star Cliff Richard and will feature cameo testimonies by
former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, singer Glen Campbell, and onetime ambassador to the
United Nations Andrew Young. It also will include a musical performance by contemporary
Christian artist Michael W. Smith. This program will be aired not only on the national TV
networks, but will be broadcast on two of the world's largest intercontinental satellite
networks, with the potential to reach approximately two-thirds of the planet's population
including many lands traditionally closed to the gospel. "We anticipate reaching 2.5 billion
people, most of whom we could never reach in our usual crusade ministry," Graham said. 
<BR><B>...Local pastors and lay leaders play a major role, as in other Graham initiatives</B>. More than 1
million pastors and church leaders worldwide have committed themselves to continuing the
campaign, the BGEA reports. Participants "see it as a powerful tool to help their own church
members have a dynamic witness for Jesus Christ" and not just in major population centers,
said Bob Williams, BGEA's director for international ministries. They are encouraging their
congregants to take part in Operation Matthew, named for the disciple who invited friends to
his home to meet Jesus. Taking advantage of VCR technology and scarce TV programming,
Christians can videotape the movies and special for use at evangelistic houseparties. The
BGEA will coordinate translation and distribution of some 445 million pieces of literature,
including discussion guides for home studies and follow-up materials. The GTS signals a
move toward a 21st century model of more lay-empowered, interactive evangelism, said the BGEA.
<BR><B>...The outreach represents a natural progression in Graham's ministry</B>. Since 1989 the
evangelist has increasingly used media technology to spread the Word of God, notably with
his Global Mission crusade from Puerto Rico (NIRR  4/3/95), estimated to have reached more
than 1 billion people worldwide. But health concerns recently have curtailed Graham's
schedule. BGEA's Mary Becker said the prerecorded format of the Global Television Series
allows BGEA to exercise "good stewardship" of the 76-year-old evangelist's strength.

<B>Fourteen professors at Calvin Seminary want their local church body to condemn homosexual
activity as sin</B>. The professors at Calvin, the theological school of the Christian Reformed
Church, said the Grand Rapids East classis, or governing body, fostered discord in the
denomination when it failed to condemn homosexual activity. The classis adopted a report in
October saying ministries should integrate homosexuals into the church, but did not take a
stance on whether homosexual practice or orientation is a sin. Longstanding denominational
policy states that homosexual practice "must be condemned as incompatible with obedience to
the will of God as revealed in Holy Scripture." The Grand Rapids, Mich., classis is influential
in the church since the seminary and the denomination's headquarters are located there. 
<BR><B>...Sidestepping the question will provide more fuel "for those who stoke the fires of
secession," said John Bolt, one of the professors who signed the letter to the classis</B>. Last
summer, the CRC's synod, its highest decision-making body, adopted a resolution allowing
local churches to bypass church rules and ordain women, Religion News Service said. That
action has led to threats of schism within the 140,000-member denomination (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/080795.html">NIRR 8/7/95</A>).

consideration and debate Dec. 23. The amendment, sent to the House of Representatives in
November (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/111395.html">NIRR 11/13/95</A>), must pass both houses by a two-thirds vote before individual
states can debate and vote on ratification. 
<BR><B>...The amendment will clarify the role of religion in public life, said Hatch, a Utah
Republican</B>. "The nation benefits greatly from the participation of religious institutions in the
public square." Opponents argue that the amendment is unnecessary because the First
Amendment already guarantees religious liberty. Supporters say it is needed to curb the power
of judges and school officials who ban prayer and Bible activities from the classroom or deny
public benefits to people affiliated with religious groups.

WFUV-FM, because it broadcasts a Mass one hour a week out of 168 hours of programming</B>.
The U.S. Commerce Department subsequently modified its policy last month after Fordham
sued. Hatch also cited a Washington state blind man who was denied government assistance

work in the scriptorium, which is powered by solar energy and connected to the Web by

thousands of Christians (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/112795.html">NIRR 11/27/95</A>), was gunned down in a street last month</B>. Ruibal had
been instrumental in organizing the all-night prayer events which, he believed, helped bring
down the Cali drug lords. On his way to a meeting of the city's pastoral association, at which
he likely would have been elected president, Ruibal got out of his car while his daughter and
bodyguard looked for a parking space. Minutes later, they found him shot in the head, Charles
Train of the Miami, Fla., based-Julio C. Ruibal Foundation told NIRR. 
<BR><B>...A local leader of the drug trade is suspected of ordering the murder, Train said</B>. Ruibal's
church is adjacent to the man's property and its ministry began to impede his business, Train
said. "It's just a case of the presence of the gospel shining its light on evil." 
<BR><B>...Several disputes have erupted over nearby land</B>. Ruibal wanted it for his ministry, which
includes a radio station, a TV station, and a school, but the drug dealer also claimed it. When
courts decided in Ruibal's favor, "it was another instance of the church prevailing over him,"
Train said. The man had threatened several times to kill Ruibal and the pastor was told he
would be killed in December, Train said. Police had not made an arrest in the killing, one of
2,800 murders in Cali last year.  
<BR><B>...Ruibal's wife, Ruth, said she will carry on her husband's ministry</B>. God let him die as a
martyr so that a spiritual awakening would take place in Cali and all of South America, she
told Train. The Bolivian-born Ruibal, who was an American citizen, evangelized his country
in the early 1970s before attending Multnomah Bible College in Portland, Ore. He moved to

<B>Evangelicals in Russia are casting a wary eye to the June presidential election</B>. The
Communist electoral victory in the state Duma, or parliament, means it is almost certain they
will seek to restrict foreign religious groups, Peter Deyneka of Russian Ministries told NIRR.
The Communists, who now have the largest block in the parliament, 158 seats, ran a
campaign that fused nationalism and the Russian Orthodox faith. 
<BR><B>...It is unlikely a restrictive law would get past President Boris Yeltsin, who vetoed a similar
measure in 1993 (NIRR 8/23/93)</B>. The Communists probably could not gain enough votes to
override the veto, Deyneka said. But Yeltsin has been ill, the Russian people are tired of
reform, and they may opt for new leadership in June, news reports said. "It depends primarily
on the Almighty," whether Yeltsin is re-elected, said Rabbi Arthur Schneier, president of the
religious freedom group Appeal of Conscience Foundation. He served as an international
observer at the Dec. 17 elections.  
<BR><B>..."As long as Yeltsin is president, we feel democracy will prevail," Deyneka said</B>. But some
evangelical groups are preparing for change. Grigory Kommandant of the Evangelical
Christian Baptist Federation, the largest Protestant body in Russia, is setting priorities for the
next year. The group is asking Western ministries to help speed up the training of national
leaders, start replacing Western evangelical leaders, help construct Protestant churches, and
develop, translate, and print Christian books in Russian. Most Protestant congregations planted
in the former Soviet Union in the past five years don't own their own buildings, so if a law
were passed banning such fellowships from renting facilities it would "eliminate probably
95% of the meeting places," Deyneka said. NIRR 1/8/96

the Internal Revenue Service announced it is seeking $750,000 in back taxes from her
daughter and one of her sons</B>. O'Hair, 76, filed the lawsuit that led to the 1963 U.S. Supreme
Court decision outlawing school prayer. She founded Austin, Texas-based American Atheists,
Inc., and other groups. Her son Jon Murray is president of American Atheists, and her
daughter, Robin Murray-O'Hair, is executive secretary. The IRS alleges O'Hair's children
used income from some of the groups to buy cars, bonds, and an Austin home, press reports
said. Another son, William Murray, is a Christian evangelist.    
<BR><B>...O'Hair and her children disappeared in August amid speculation that she had died and her
followers were keeping it quiet fearing Christians would claim she had converted on her
deathbed, news reports said</B>. O'Hair's attorney Craig Etter rejected any suggestion that they
had fled to escape back taxes, although he had not spoken to any of them since September.

<B>Joan Brown Campbell, general secretary of the National Council of Churches since 1991, was
re-elected to a four-year term by the NCC's general board</B>. Campbell, a minister in the
Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and the American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A., is
chief executive and spokesperson for the New York City-based NCC. United Methodist
Bishop Melvin Talbert (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/121195.html">NIRR 12/11/95</A>) will be NCC president for 1996-1997. 
<BR><B>...The 2.5 million-member National Missionary Baptist Convention of America was accepted
as the 33rd denomination in the NCC, whose churches have 51 million total congregants</B>.

<B>Mable Dawe has been pastor at Faith Chapel in Albuquerque, N.M., for 54 years</B>. At 91, she
still counsels, teaches, and preaches in the 150-member interdenominational church, built on a
literal belief in the Bible. Dawe, who was ordained in 1941, has no formal theological
training. She has received criticism over the years about being a woman minister. "I didn't
pay any attention to it," she said. Dawe's associate pastor is Tom Salmon.

<B>Foundation for New Era Philanthropy misappropriated a total of $174 million between 1992
and its collapse in May 1995 (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/121195.html">NIRR 12/11/95</A>), according to Arlin Adams, trustee for the
bankrupt Philadelphia charity</B>. Original estimates were that New Era owed more than $500
million, but most of that was money New Era promised but did not pay to groups that
invested in the charity, news reports said. 
<BR><B>...New Era and founder John Bennett are under investigation by the U.S</B>. Attorney's Office
and the Pennsylvania Attorney General. Bennett also is the target of a civil fraud probe by the
federal Securities and Exchange Commission, which alleges he diverted $4 million of New
Era funds, much of which went to pay consulting firms he controlled, reports said.
<P>
<B>Some 16% of Americans believe they are at risk of becoming homeless, a survey conducted
by the Gallup Organization and the Los Angeles Mission relief agency found</B>. Nearly one
third said they felt more sympathy for the homeless than five years ago.
<P>
<B>Jewish young people will help Habitat For Humanity build 20 homes in the next three years</B>.
The North American Federation of Temple Youth, a division of the Union of American
Hebrew Congregations, became the first national Jewish group to enter a formal partnership
with Habitat, a nondenominational Christian group based in Americus, Ga. Habitat often
works with local non-Christian groups, news reports said.
<P>
<B>Many writers are turning to fiction to convey religious teachings</B>. The trend is evident among
evangelicals such as Frank Peretti, who wrote The Oath, Charles Colson, who wrote the novel
Gideon's Trumpet, and Pat Robertson, who wrote The End Of The Age, all from Word
Publishing. Also, New Age writers trying their hands at fiction include Deepak Chopra with
his novel The Return of Merlin and writer Starhawk with The Fifth Sacred Thing. Bantam
Books editor Linda Gross expects the New Age novels to interest mainstream readers.
<P>
<B>A lesbian can adopt the biological child of her partner, a New York Family Court judge
ruled</B>. Judge John Sweeney previously had ruled that Gail Messina could not adopt 5-year-old
Dana, the daughter of partner Patricia Irwin. He reversed himself after New York State's
highest court ruled that unmarried homosexual and heterosexual domestic partners can adopt
each other's children. The ruling made New York at least the fourth state to allow adoption
by an unmarried, live-in partner. Other states include Massachusetts, Illinois, and Vermont.
"My family is finally validated," said Messina, 52.
<P>
<B>The Christian country music genre is developing rapidly, the Washington Post said</B>. Christian
performers who prefer country music started the Christian Country Music Association three
years ago. Recently, Christian record companies added country divisions and hundreds of
Christian radio stations began giving the music air time. Christian country spurns the cheating
and drinking themes depicted in many country songs. 
<P>
<B>The Society of St</B>. Vincent de Paul collected three times as many donations of household
items as were destroyed in a fire at the Catholic charity's warehouse in Detroit Dec. 15. The
five-alarm blaze caused $1 million damage in one of the city's worst fires ever. The
warehouse held clothes, furniture, and toys for the 400 charities that serve 18 thrift shops
throughout Detroit. Cash donations will help the society rebuild the warehouse.
<P>
<B>A parents' guide to religious rights in public schools has been developed by the Freedom
Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University</B>. The 16-page guide addresses 15
topics regarding religious practices in public schools, including graduation prayers and
celebrations of religious holidays. The guide will be distributed to 30,000 PTA presidents and
regional workshops will be held after the distribution, said Charles Haynes of the
Nashville-based center. For information, call (615) 321-9588. Last year, the Clinton
Administration issued similar guidelines to every school district in the country (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/090495.html">NIRR 9/4/95</A>).
<P>
<B>Ministers spend at least a third of their workday in office administration at the expense of
counseling, study, sermon preparation, and community service, a study published in The
Review of Religious Research said</B>. Time pressure could be lessened by taking courses in
administration, enlisting volunteers, and paying laity, the study suggested.
<P>
<B>Bar and bas mitzvahs, traditionally reserved for Jewish youth as an initiation into adulthood,
have taken place regularly among adults in the last five years, the New York Times said</B>. The
ceremonies are attracting adults who never took part in them or went through them merely by
rote. An estimated half of the Reform, Conservative, and Reconstructionist synagogues in the
country regularly conduct bar and bas mitzvahs for adults. The rituals are not part of
Orthodox Jewish tradition. Half to three-quarters of participants are women, who were not
allowed or encouraged to participate in the ritual until the 1970s. 
<P>
<B>Yale University plans to retain its Divinity School but reduce the number of students and
faculty in an effort to improve its reputation</B>. The school's future had been in doubt after
being battered by high acceptance rates and crumbling facilities, news reports said. Yale
Provost Alison Richard affirmed support for the Divinity School's traditional mission of
training students to become ministers. 
<BR><B>..."Rumors about the demise of the school are over," said Dean Thomas Ogletree</B>. A review
committee recommended that the school reduce its student body from 350 to 280 and
decrease faculty members from 32 to 28 over six years. The committee also wants to swell
the student applicant pool by 50% in five years through aggressive recruiting. The acceptance
rate at the Divinity School has been about 80% while the rate at other Yale schools has been
far lower.
<P>
<B>Among the predictions for 1996 listed in U.S</B>. News & World Report is spiritual awakening.
"It is my conviction that we are going to see a great spiritual renewal in America," Billy
Graham wrote in the Dec. 25 edition of the magazine. 
<BR><B>...Despite "much discouragement, despair, and negativism" in the nation, "America is not
finished and it is not too late," Graham wrote</B>. "There are still hopes to be realized. There are
still goals to be attained. And all of this will be accomplished by men and women who
believe in God and in the future of America," he said.                   
<P>
<B>Few Americans feel that the country's major leaders and institutions closely share their
values, a Harris Poll found</B>. Eighteen percent of the survey's respondents said President
Clinton shares their values "a lot," and 9% felt that way about both Bob Dole and Newt
Gingrich. Two percent said the same about Hollywood, and 10% about television and
corporate America. However, 58% said their religion shares their values "a lot."

<B>Burundi: About 20 Christian church and relief workers were killed in escalating violence
between Tutsi government forces and Hutu rebels, news reports said</B>. The relief agency World
Vision said that workers with two of its partner organizations, Africa Revival Ministries and
Emmanuel Church, died last month. Government soldiers entered the ARM compound, which
houses a dispensary and maternity clinic, "got six of our staff, and shot them with machine
guns," according to Christine Chapman of ARM, based in the United Kingdom. Chapman
does not believe the workers were killed because they were Christians. "The military retaliates
and innocent people...get killed."

<B>Chechnya: The year-long war for independence from Russia has produced an Islamic revival
in the republic, news reports said</B>. Many Chechens are turning to Allah for comfort and
guidance after seeing their countrymen and families killed in fighting and artillery attacks.
Dozens of mosques have opened, more Chechen women are donning head scarves, and few of
the rebels still indulge in alcohol. Sharia law "has given us the moral strength to battle the
Russians, who get drunk all the time," one soldier said. Islam was prominent in the region
before control by the Soviet Union, which persecuted all religions. 
<P>
<B>Iran: A Christian-Muslim conference will be held in Tehran in October</B>. The World Council
of Churches announced the meeting after a year of talks with Iranian Muslim scholars.
"Religion and the Contemporary World" will examine the impact of secularization on society
and religion.
<P>
<B>Israel: Greek Orthodox Patriarch of the Holy Land, Deodorus I, gave PLO leader Yasser
Arafat symbolic custody of all Christian churches in Jerusalem, news reports said</B>. "I am the
heir of Sophronius and I am handing the keys (to the Christian sites) to the heir of Omar Ibn
al-Khattab," Deodorus told Arafat as he entered the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem on
Dec. 23. Omar was a Muslim caliph who wrested Jerusalem from the Byzantine Christian
empire in the 5th century. He gave Patriarch Sophronius custody of the Christian churches
and pledged to protect them. Deodorus's act strengthens Arafat's bid to make Arab East
Jerusalem the capital of a Palestinian state. Arafat attended a midnight Mass at the Church of
the Nativity.    
<P>
<B>Kuwait: Despite a court order, Hussein Qambar Ali, who is separated from his wife, has been
unable to visit his children since converting to Christianity</B>. When Ali began to talk about his
conversion, his lawyer dropped the case and his family removed him from the construction
business that he helped build. Also, Ali's house has been broken into, the International
Institute for the Study of Islam and Christianity said. Ali is in hiding.

<B>Brazil: The Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, which is the country's fastest growing
evangelical community (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/103095.html">NIRR 10/30/95</A>), is under investigation by Brazil's attorney general</B>.
Church leaders are suspected of evading taxes, defrauding followers, and accepting money
from Colombian drug traffickers, news reports said. 
<BR><B>...Charges stem from a videotape recorded 10 years ago by Carlos Magno, former assistant to
the church's leader, Edir Macedo</B>. The video allegedly shows ministers gleefully counting
money and ordering others to threaten followers with hell if they didn't contribute enough.
Magno said the Cali drug cartel loaned Macedo $1 million. Globo TV, a Catholic station and
competitor of Macedo's Record TV network, aired the video. Last year, a Universal Church
minister angered Catholics by punching a statue of The Virgin Mary on TV. The church has
3.5 million members in 34 countries.
<P>
<B>Cayman Islands: An American couple has been convicted of practicing witchcraft</B>. Walter and
Helen Johnson are members of the ESP Spiritual Center in Ocala, Fla., which they describe as
a non-denominational Christian church. Police raided their home and confiscated tracts on
numerology and oils that supposedly confer spiritual powers. The Caymans, a British territory
south of Cuba, forbid witchcraft, voodoo, astrology, and palm reading. A judge suspended the
Johnsons' one-year sentence and ordered them deported.  
<P>
<B>Dominican Republic: About 12,000 evangelicals worshiped and heard the preaching of
Brazilian-born evangelist Haje Andraus in Santiago in December</B>. Andraus challenged the
worshipers to take the gospel to everyone in Santiago and to double the number of Christians
and churches in the city. Andraus heads Houston-based International Vision, a ministry to
Latin America. He also preached in Nagua and Santa Domingo.
<P>
<B>Ecuador: Kidnapped Nazarene missionary Don Cox was rescued on Christmas and has
returned to the United States (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/122595.html">NIRR 12/25/95</A>)</B>. Cox was freed by Quito police, who killed
three of his abductors in a jungle north of the city. The captors had demanded a $500,000
ransom.
<P>
<B>Mexico: Authorities razed a village, including a church and school, in Santa Rosa, Baja
California</B>. About 40 of the 160 villagers are Baptists, American Baptist News Service said.
Many left the area, but about 80 have camped in tents and gathered every night for a
devotional service, said missionary Stan Crews. "We are the church. They can destroy our
buildings, but they cannot destroy us," he told the group. Crews surmised that the government
chased the villagers out because a wealthy landowner wanted the property.

<B>Croatia: The Catholic bishop of Banja Luka was released from house arrest</B>. Franjo Komarica
entreated people to practice tolerance during the ethnic cleansing in the Serb-occupied city.
Komarica was arrested during the terror, when 500,000 Catholic Croats and Bosnian Muslims
were forced to leave their homes. On his first day of freedom, Komarica visited the remains
of a bombed-out monastery and the graves of four clergy, news reports said. "The time of
destruction and expulsion is over. God bless the coming times," he said. 
<P>
<B>England: A divorce and remarriage would not prevent Prince Charles from becoming
Supreme Governor of the Church of England and Defender of the Faith when he assumes the
throne, news reports said</B>. Although the church officially opposes divorce and it is unlikely
Charles could remarry in an Anglican service, he probably would receive a blessing for a
second marriage. Queen Elizabeth II reportedly urged Charles and Princess Diana to divorce;
Charles has said he doesn't plan to remarry.
<P>
<B>France: The remains of 16 members of the Order of the Solar Temple were found in a remote
area near Grenoble last month</B>. The bodies, arranged in a star formation, had been burned,
news reports said. Most of the victims, including three children, had been drugged and shot,
autopsies showed; their clothes were soaked in paint thinner and set afire. The bodies of two
men who committed suicide were found apart from the group. Two French policeman were
among the victims and may have participated in the murders, the report said. The incident
mirrors the 1994 murder-suicide of 53 members of the cult in Switzerland and Canada (NIRR
10/17/94). 
<P>
<B>Russia: The Church of Scientology is gaining influence in politics, business, and the media,
news reports said</B>. The church's management-training courses are in high demand and
hundreds of factories and other businesses are adopting Scientology principles. The mayor of
Perm, a city of 1.5 million, reportedly converted to Scientology and has instructed city
employees to use a Scientologist administrative system.
<P>
<B>Scotland: Tony Campolo preached to 20,000 people at a five-day crusade in Glasgow</B>. Some
1,000 people, most under 25 years of age, made commitments to Christ, the Evangelical
Association for the Promotion of Education said. "I found intensity in those kids I don't find
in the United States," Campolo said. 
<P>
<B>Sweden: The Lutheran Church is giving up its status as the state religion</B>. As of Jan. 1,
children born to at least one Lutheran parent are no longer official members of the church. By
the year 2000, the church will begin appointing its own bishops, evaluating and dividing its
vast property holdings, and trimming its state supported budget. Deteriorating church
membership and an increase in immigrants and denominations in the country, forced the
church to give up its official status, which it has held since 1593.

<B>Key U.S</B>. Protestant leaders are working together in an unprecedented effort to evangelize the
country. At a gathering in Chicago Dec. 7-9, 154 denominational and parachurch leaders
agreed to mobilize the church so that every person in the United States will be prayed for and
have an opportunity to hear the gospel by the end of the decade. 
<BR><B>...The strategy would create many opportunities for Christian denominations, parachurch
groups, and individuals to collaborate</B>. The leaders are formulating a strategy that includes
training Christians to share their faith door-to-door in every home in America, possibly by
distributing the Jesus film; holding simultaneous revival meetings and crusades in every
community in the country; broadcasting a crusade nationally by satellite in 1999; following up
and discipling new believers; and planting churches. All efforts would be backed by prayer,
possibly including prayer marches through every community. A broad representation of
American evangelism leaders are expected to finalize the plan by February and begin
implementation.   
<BR><B>...The leaders knelt and prayed, admitting that any strategy they devised inevitably would fail
unless it is ordained by God</B>. "Let us speak plainly: no Holy Spirit, no evangelizing," said
Eddie Fox, world director of evangelism for the World Methodist Council. "What an
incredible moment, with tremendous possibilities and enormous responsibility."  
<BR><B>...They acknowledged that isolation limits ministry, but collaboration could enhance it</B>.
Southern Baptists cannot do this job alone said Larry Lewis, who suggested the outline of the
campaign. He is president of the Home Mission Board for the 15-million-member Southern
Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the United States. Daniel Weiss,
general secretary of the American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A., said Christians will have to
work with people they haven't been used to, rise above historic divisions and competitiveness,
and concentrate on "the One we share." Doing that "would blow the minds of many people in
this country," Weiss said. John Holland, president of the International Church of the
Foursquare Gospel, said that although the practical application is staggering, the results could
be "a thrilling thing." 
<BR><B>...An "authentic, holy desperation" is drawing denominations to work together, said Paul
Cedar, president of the Evangelical Free Church of America and head of the networking
movement Mission America, which organized the meeting along with The Billy Graham
Center's Institute of Evangelism</B>. While "the Book of Acts is being repeated in Third World
countries," the U.S. church is limping along, Cedar said. The United States "desperately needs
the authentic church of Jesus Christ to rise to the surface." These are not days for protecting
turf, "but for humbling ourselves," he said.  
<BR><B>..."It is not commission, or omission, but no mission" that is the church's greatest failing, Fox
said</B>. But now, "the people are given a new vision." The Chicago group of leaders "is about
the same number that gathered in the Upper Room, and about the same kind of people -rather ordinary," he said. "But something happened to them."  
<BR><B>...Denominations represented by leaders at the Chicago meeting included the African
Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, American Baptist Church, Assemblies of God, Baptist
General Conference, Christian & Missionary Alliance, Church of God in Christ, Church of
God of Prophecy, Conservative Baptist Association, Episcopal Church, Evangelical Covenant
Church, Evangelical Free Church of America, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Free
Methodist Church of North America, International Church of the Foursquare Gospel, Lutheran
Church-Missouri Synod, Mount Sinai Holy Church of America, North American Baptist
Conference, Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Pentecostal Holiness Church, Presbyterian Church
in Canada, Reformed Church in America, Salvation Army, Southern Baptist Convention,
United Church of Christ, United Methodist Church, and Wesleyan Church</B>. 
<BR><B>...Scores of parachurch groups also are involved</B>. Some of the larger ministries are the AD
2000 & Beyond Movement, Aglow International, American Bible Society, Billy Graham
Evangelistic Association, Campus Crusade for Christ, Concerts of Prayer International, Every
Home For Christ, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, Good News Movement (United Methodist
Church), Intercessors for America, International Bible Society, InterVarsity Christian
Fellowship, Luis Palau Evangelistic Association, March For Jesus, Moody Broadcasting
Network, National Association of Evangelicals, National Network of Youth Ministries,
National Religious Broadcasters, The Navigators, Operation Mobilization, Promise Keepers,
Skylight Satellite Network, U.S. Center for World Missions, Youth For Christ (U.S.A), and

<B>Arab and Israeli pastors from Galilee, who are ethnic enemies even though they are Christian
brothers, reconciled their fears and bitterness during four days of prayer and worship on
Mount Carmel, Israel</B>. Thirty-five pastors from towns around the Sea of Galilee spent Nov.
27-30 in a Pastor's Prayer Summit at the Stella Retreat Center. Mount Carmel is the site of
the Old Testament confrontation between Elijah and the prophets of Baal. 
<BR><B>...Most of the pastors had never been in the same room together, and approached the summit
with "great suspicion and hesitancy," said Joe Aldrich, president of Multnomah Ministries</B>. He
and Tom White of Frontline Ministries, the only Americans in attendance, acted as facilitators
for the event.  
<BR><B>...After two days of worship and prayer, the hurts, fears, and bitterness subsided, and by the
end of the summit the pastors were hugging, kissing each other on the cheek, and treating
each other as long-lost brothers</B>. Aldrich described the pastors as toughened by years of
isolation in small churches, by social pressure on their families, and persecution, which has
intensified recently since the religious community largely is blamed for the assassination of
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Aldrich said. Satanic worship, New Age and the occult, and a
population of Druse are increasing in the area. The pastors at the summit are "the Green
Berets" of Christendom in northern Israel, Aldrich said. 
<BR><B>..."The power of the Lord swept through the room, and the only place you could be was flat
on your face," Aldrich said</B>. At times, everyone lay prostrate on the floor, forehead to the
carpet, with no one daring to speak for 20 minutes, because the presence of the Lord was so
powerful, he said. 
<BR><B>...At one point, all of the Israelis knelt in the center of the room as the Arabs laid hands on
them and prayed for each of them</B>. Then the Arabs knelt and the Israelis prayed for them.
During one prayer session, the pastors "called out to Jesus to return in the Spirit to Galilee,
walk in their towns and villages, and call forth the harvest," said Frontline Ministries' White.
"They prayed, `Jesus, this is the land You loved, the towns You walked in. Come back and
open the eyes of the blind and set the captives free.'" 
<BR><B>...Since the summit, the pastors have met once a week and made plans to spend one day a
month together and hold a prayer summit next year</B>. "They are fully expecting there is going
to be a significant harvest" in Galilee, White said. "There is something very special about
what is building in the area." NIRR 12/25/95

<B>Evangelist Sammy Tippit's services were shut down and he was ordered not to preach during
recent trips to Macedonia and eastern Cuba</B>. Nevertheless, more than 100 people were added
to Macedonia's tiny Christian population and some 800 Cubans made decisions for Christ. 
<BR><B>...In Macedonia, where there are about 500 evangelical Christians, Tippit addressed 150 single
adults at a national youth conference in Strumica; 50 pledged to spread the gospel throughout
Macedonia, the San Antonio, Texas-based evangelist said</B>. But meetings in Stip and Ohrid
were closed by police who were frightened by the enthusiasm displayed by local citizens.
Despite radio announcements that the meeting was called off, 100 people came to a theater in
Stip to hear Tippit. When police wouldn't allow the theater to open, most of the group
walked two miles in the dark and cold to a church where Tippit gave his message. Over two
nights, 40 people came to Christ, he said. When meetings were closed in Ohrid, the group
held informal services in a rented restaurant. About 75 people came to the meetings, and 20
became Christians. 
<BR><B>...On Tippit's last evening in Macedonia, the leaders of five evangelical denominations in
Skopje, the capital, held a rally at a Baptist church</B>. It was one of the largest gatherings of
evangelical Christians, with more than 200 people in attendance. The rally energized the
church, Tippit said. "They didn't know they could get together and do something like that."
Some 75 people became Christians or recommitted their lives to Christ. 
<BR><B>...In Holguin, Cuba, Tippit was told to stop preaching or face a fine, deportation, or arrest</B>. He
had been invited by the Eastern Baptist Convention to preach in its churches and hold a
leadership conference for pastors and layworkers. But after preaching at the First Baptist
Church in Holguin, Tippit was summoned to the Immigration and Foreign Affairs Office,
where he was told he would have to stop because he entered the country on a tourist visa.
Told he could deliver a greeting from the pulpit, Tippit gave a 20-minute salutation the next
day and 75 people came forward to become Christians.  
<BR><B>..."The pastors there are very courageous -- they're getting into trouble because they're having
rapid growth," Tippit said</B>. First Baptist Church in Holguin has grown from 200 to 600
members since 1991. Tippit also preached in Santiago and Bayamo. NIRR 12/25/95

<B>The South Korean church is preparing to evangelize North Korea when the communist
country opens up</B>. More than 20,000 missionaries and Christian workers are prepared to
relocate to North Korea and begin church planting and personal evangelism, Isaac Lee of
Seattle-based Cornerstone Ministries told NIRR. "There will be a mass movement from South
to North once it opens up," he said (NIRR 6/28/93). Two denominations plan to plant
churches nationwide. 
<BR><B>...North Korea is on the brink of famine and will have to open soon, Lee said</B>. The cumulative
effects of 47 years of communism, coupled with last summer's floods that devastated crops
and left 50,000 families homeless, will cause a hard winter. "I am afraid that for the first time
there will be many deaths because of the famine."   
<BR><B>...The underground church in North Korea is growing rapidly, Lee said</B>. He estimates there are
60,000-100,000 believers who do not belong to the government-controlled Protestant and
Catholic churches. Cornerstone, which smuggles Bibles into the country, has seen a dramatic
increase in requests since 1994. From 1988 to 1993, the ministry brought 5,000 Bibles a year
into North Korea; last year it delivered 20,000 and expects to exceed 50,000 in 1995. 
<BR><B>...The growing number of believers is due partially to new leader Kim Jong Il's emphasis on
the strength of the family and its role in passing on values</B>. Under the leadership of his father,
Kim Il Sung, the concept of the family was derided as a threat to communist ideals. But as
Kim Jong Il seeks to take power, he is emphasizing his father's influence on him and their
strong familial bond. This re-introduction of the concept as the family of a transmitter of
values is leading many older Koreans to pass on to their children and grandchildren the faith
they learned from their parents, Lee said. NIRR 12/25/95

<B>Christians cannot worship in the American Consulate General in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, a
former foreign service officer said</B>. The Muslim country allows no places of worship other
than mosques, so expatriates could worship only at consulates that held services. But since
last year, American foreign service officers have told U.S. citizens in Saudi Arabia to worship
at the British consulate, which cannot hold all of them. American Christians are "in anguish
about not being able to worship," Tim Hunter, who served at the U.S. consulate from
1993-1994, told NIRR. During his assignment in Jiddah, Hunter said, worship at the embassy
was limited to 15 Catholics. Hunter, a Catholic, said he asked permission to hold services in
his home, but was denied. After he left in March, services were closed completely, he said. A
State Department source confirmed that services no longer are held at the consulate, but
declined to elaborate.  
<BR><B>...Pressure from Saudi security personnel, who objected to Western practices on embassy
grounds, closed the services, Hunter said</B>. The Saudis also wanted nightclubs on embassy
grounds closed because they serve liquor and hold dances, violations of Muslim beliefs. To
keep the nightclubs open, officials at the consulate compromised and closed the worship
services, he said. "They made the decision that the needs of American alcoholics were more
important than the needs of American Christians." Some of the incentive to keep the
nightclubs open was financial, since alcohol sales are "tremendously profitable" in the dry
country and officials can get $50 for a quart of whiskey, he said.                                  
<BR><B>...The State Department gives the impression that it's more interested in pleasing the host
countries than protecting and defending the rights of American citizens abroad, Richard Cizik
of the National Association of Evangelicals said</B>. "It's our experience in the [Persian] Gulf
countries that [State Department officials] can be less than helpful." NIRR 12/25/95

<B>The Toronto Airport Vineyard church has been expelled from its parent group, the
Association of Vineyard Churches</B>. AVC International Director John Wimber said that in the
last two years the congregation had moved away from the type of ministry the AVC is called
to pursue. The Canadian congregation is known worldwide for its ecstatic worship style
frequently called the Toronto Blessing (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/112795.html">NIRR 11/27</A>). Worshipers at the 1,000-member church
often swoon to the floor, laugh uncontrollably, or make animal noises during services. 
<BR><B>...The AVC has recognized that "we are not their leaders," Wimber said in a letter formally
withdrawing the association's endorsement</B>. Wimber and Vineyard administrators Todd
Hunter, Bob Fulton, and Gary Best traveled from AVC headquarters in Anaheim, Calif., to
Toronto to announce their action Dec. 5. The renewal has been "a blessing to many and a
wonderful work of God," the association said. But the AVC cannot support "any exotic
practices that are extrabiblical."  
<BR><B>...Differences centered on the importance placed on the phenomena and the administration of
worship services, said Hunter, the AVC's National Coordinator-U.S.A</B>. "We see the
phenomena as incidental; they see it as central." The phenomena should not be promoted or
"used as the basis for theologizing that leads to new teaching," Wimber's letter said. An AVC
statement faulted the Toronto church for failing to commit itself adequately to "test the spirits
or manifestations to sort out the good from the bad." In spite of the AVC's "many
expressions of concern," the Toronto church repeatedly violated guidelines detailed in a report
to Vineyard churches in September 1994, Wimber said. The AVC has received numerous
criticisms about the Toronto church, and reportedly felt it was appropriate to redirect them to
the church itself. 
<BR><B>..."We were removed without due process," said John Arnott, senior pastor at the Toronto
Airport Vineyard, although he accepted the decision to sever the relationship</B>. Arnott said he
felt the AVC leaders were "not getting an accurate picture of what was taking place at the
renewal meetings" and that differences could have been "explained or resolved." Arnott said
he has asked several leaders from around the world to help oversee the church until "such
time as new alliances are formed." Those leaders also would form an International Renewal
Network to help steer the Toronto Blessing renewal. The official separation from the
Vineyard is to take place Jan. 20, when the church is to announce a new name. The date also
is "the second anniversary of the outpouring of God's Spirit" at the church, Arnott said. 
<BR><B>...Arnott has said that critics should pay less attention to the dramatic phenomena and more
attention to how they change the lives of those involved</B>. Evangelism often "ends up being a
religious sense of duty without the motivation of God's love," Arnott said at a Pasadena
church this month, according to news reports. "If you will soak in the presence of the Holy
Spirit a couple of hours every day, it will so revolutionize your life you won't be able to stop
yourself from finding a place to serve God," he said.  
<BR><B>...Wimber and Arnott expressed admiration for each other</B>. "We will be parting on friendly
terms," Arnott wrote. God is "moving this stream of the Holy Spirit along a new tributary,"
Wimber said. "We love them and desire only the best for them as they pursue what they
believe to be God's intent." However, the split already is reverberating through charismatic
Christianity. Vineyard Christian Fellowship of Pasadena asked to leave the denomination after
the decision, Hunter told NIRR. The AVC has an annual budget of $800,000 and 200,000
members in 600 congregations. NIRR 12/25/95

<B>Seven religious nonprofits will be forced to return $500,000 donated by a convicted stock
swindler, the Supreme Court ruled Dec</B>. 11. The charities argued that they should not have to
return money they received innocently from Michael Douglas, mastermind of a Ponzi
investment scheme. Douglas, a former Chicago salesman, was sentenced to 12 years in federal
prison for creating corporations that sold limited partnerships and promised huge profits to
investors (NIRR 7/15/91). After Douglas pleaded guilty, a receiver appointed by a federal trial
judge recovered $12 million of the money Douglas took from investors. The appeal stemmed
from the receiver's efforts to retrieve money Douglas had given the charities before his legal
problems began in 1989. 
<BR><B>...Virtually all the money is spent, reports said</B>. African Enterprise received $166,000, Bethany
Evangelical Free Church, $26,880; Heart Cry International, $12,485; Hindustan Bible
Institute, $74,989.25; International Students, Inc., $120,000; Proclamation International,
$51,000; and World Vision, $57,500. Proclamation International said it is shut down
permanently because of the court's decision. 
<BR><B>...The 7th U.S</B>. Circuit Court of Appeals, upholding the ruling last May in African Enterprise
vs. Scholes, likened the case to a thief running into a church and dumping stolen money into
a collection plate. The theft victim, not the church, is entitled to that money, the court said.
But the more difficult case arises when the money's taint is not discovered until after it is
spent, the appeals court said.  
<BR><B>..."For the first time, a federal appellate court has ruled that charitable donations to an
innocent public charity, received in the normal course of charitable operations and duly
distributed for charitable purposes, may be voided as fraudulent transfers," the charities'
lawyers said</B>. They predicted dire consequences "on the entire nationwide charitable sector."

<B>Churches, ministries, and other nonprofits in Colorado are mobilizing to oppose a ballot

apparently has more than the 54,242 signatures of registered voters needed to place it on next
November's ballot, news reports said.  
<BR><B>...The ballot initiative divides nonprofits into two groups</B>. The tax-exempt group, which the
sponsors call "community duty charities," are nonprofits that house orphans, the disabled, the
elderly, the homeless, or prisoners. All others would have to pay.

Murphy, a member of the Madison, Wis.-based Freedom From Religion Foundation, hosts a

is not his motive. Two years ago, he demanded an apology from Pope John Paul II, claiming
a priest molested him when he was a boy, reports said.

executive director of the Colorado Association of Nonprofit Organizations</B>. Many programs
would be scaled back and some nonprofits would go out of existence, Reed said. If churches
can't afford taxes, "they'll have to sell their property to a church that can," Murphy said.

<B>Many homosexual activists are wrongly using federal AIDS-education money to lobby
politicians, raise funds, conduct explicit educational programs in public schools, and recruit
children into the homosexual lifestyle, Claire Connelly told Congress</B>. An avowed lesbian and
president of the Ojai, Calif.-based Gay & Lesbian Resource Center, Connelly testified at the
House Economic and Educational Opportunities Subcommittee on Investigations and
Oversight this month. 
<BR><B>..."I have seen horrendous things go on in the name of education, such as giving explicit
details on anal and oral sex and encouraging promiscuity," Connelly told NIRR</B>. Students age
12-18 are told they can have sex with as many people as they like as long as they use
condoms, and are encouraged to experiment sexually, she said. Connelly said students are
invited to private "educational classes" where alcohol and drugs are available, and are
"enticed into homosexual relationships." Connelly estimated that $3 billion in federal money,
much of it from the Centers for Disease Control, filtered down to about 8,000 homosexual
activist groups last year. There are no official figures, and the money is hard to track because
it is subcontracted through various levels, she said.  
<BR><B>...Connelly's center formerly received federal funds, but she refused to accept additional
money when told that its AIDS education classes had to include actual demonstrations of
condom use</B>. Connolly said she believes that no homosexual nonprofits should receive federal
funding. She said her testimony was intended to shed light on misuse of federal money by
homosexual rights and counseling groups.

local school boards eventually find that "their hands are tied because the buck stops at the

Women for America. CWA was one of several conservative Christian political groups,

the hearings. Parents, teachers, home school representatives, and former education secretary

<B>East Wenatchee, Wash., pastor Robert Roberson and his wife, Connie, (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/121195.html">NIRR 12/11</A>) wept as
a Waterville jury acquitted them Dec</B>. 11 of all charges in a massive child sexual abuse case
that critics called a witch hunt. The Robersons, who had been accused of multiple rapes and
molestations, regained custody of their 5-year-old daughter Rebekah, who was taken by
authorities although she said she was not abused.  
<BR><B>...The prosecution stemmed from a probe of two purported sex rings</B>. Prosecutors said abuse
occurred in ritualistic orgies at the East Wenatchee Pentecostal Church of God, where
Roberson, 50, is an unordained pastor. The lead investigator was Wenatchee detective Robert
Perez, whose 11-year-old daughter said she was sexually abused there by dozens of relatives
and neighbors. Of the 28 adults charged, five have been convicted, 14 pleaded guilty. Charges
were dismissed against five people, mostly because witnesses recanted or were unavailable to
testify; three were acquitted and one case is pending.  
<BR><B>...The Robersons say they were charged because they criticized investigators' motives and
methods in the larger probe</B>. Critics said overzealous investigators coaxed children into
making false accusations. At least four girls said to have been abused denied it during their
testimonies. The Robersons said they intend to file a civil suit against the state and seek the
release of those in prison. Attorney General Janet Reno has asked her civil rights division to
review the case under laws against misusing public office to deprive citizens of their
due-process rights. "I've never had an enemy in my life that I would ever want to be in a
position that Connie and I have been placed in," Roberson said. NIRR 12/25/95

<B>The FBI is investigating whether the largest chain of abortion clinics in Massachusetts rigged
ultrasound tests so clients would undergo riskier, more expensive, abortions, The Boston
Globe said</B>. The FBI and local police seized medical records and documents at the Brookline
office of clinic owner Dr. Howard J. Silverman as part of a criminal investigation, the paper
said. The investigation is focusing on whether ultrasounds were falsified in order to charge
higher rates for more invasive and expensive procedures required for later-term abortions, the
Globe said. Silverman charges between $300 and $500 for a first-trimester abortion. After 14
weeks, the procedure gets more complicated and can cost $650-$700, the paper said. At 22
weeks, it can cost $2,100. 
<BR><B>...Silverman's facilities perform about 10,000 abortions a year, approximately a third of the
35,000 performed annually in Massachusetts</B>. In 1984, the Board of Registration in Medicine
disciplined Silverman for sexual misconduct with an 18-year-old patient, news reports said.

<B>Billy Graham is recovering from a fracture of his right seventh rib and a severe contusion of
his right shoulder after slipping in his New York hotel room Dec</B>. 12. Doctors said the fall
was not related to Graham's Parkinson's disease. Graham was in the city to receive the
American Bible Society Award for his contributions in spreading the gospel. John Akers,
Graham's assistant, received the award on behalf of the evangelist and read Graham's
prepared address at a dinner at the New York Hilton Dec. 13. In June, Graham suffered a
bleeding colon and spent four days in the hospital during a long-planned crusade in Canada
(<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/062695.html">NIRR 6/26</A>). A month later, he suffered a back injury while vacationing in France. 
<P>
<B>Kweisi Mfume, new head of the NAACP, said the nation's oldest civil rights organization is
"not dead yet</B>." His tasks are to restore credibility and fiscal health to the group, news reports
said. Mfume will try to wipe out a $3.2 million debt, assemble a leadership team, streamline
the group's internal procedures, and assume a high profile on issues of concern to blacks. A
Baltimore Democrat in his fifth term in the U.S. House of Representatives, Mfume will leave
his seat to head the group. The $200,000-a-year job has been vacant since the board fired
Benjamin Chavis for alleged misuse of funds (NIRR 12/12/94). 
<P>
<B>More than one-third of 1,000 black American church members in five cities said they believe
the AIDS virus was created in a germ warfare laboratory and has been used to commit
genocide against blacks</B>. A third said they were unsure and the rest disagreed. The findings
were reported by University of North Carolina health educator Sandra Crouse Quinn at a
meeting of the American Public Health Association.  
<P>
<B>Roger Parrott, former president of Sterling College in Sterling, Kan., became president of
Bellhaven College in Jackson, Miss.; he succeeds Newton Wilson, who retired</B>. Carl Zylstra

John Hulst in summer, 1995.

<B>John Brown University in Siloam Springs, Ark., named David Shibley, president of Global
Advance, as 1995 Outstanding Alumnus of the Year</B>. Shibley, a 1973 graduate, founded the
Dallas-based ministry in 1990. The group has helped train 40,000 pastors in 40 nations.
<P>
<B>Watergate conspirator turned minister Jeb Magruder can vote again</B>. Kentucky Gov. Brereton
Jones restored the privilege to Magruder, convicted of obstruction of justice. He has pastored
at First Presbyterian Church in Lexington for five years, and worked with the governor's wife
on several Habitat for Humanity projects. Convicted felons ordinarily lose their voting
privileges for life.
<P>
<B>Episcopal church lawyers began preliminary arguments in the heresy case of retired Bishop
Walter Righter, 72, who ordained an acknowledged, practicing homosexual as a deacon</B>. The
denomination asked its lawyers, meeting in Christ Church Cathedral in Hartford, Conn., to
determine whether church doctrine is violated by ordaining noncelibate homosexuals. The trial
is set for Feb. 27. If found guilty, Righter could be admonished, suspended, or removed from
his priestly duties.

<B>The success of the Million Man March (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/103095.html">NIRR 10/30</A>) inspired its organizers to plan an
international Million Family March</B>. The event, planned for Oct. 16, one year after the initial
march, is to include simultaneous satellite-linked gatherings of black families around the
world, said Benjamin Chavis, the former director of the NAACP who helped organize this
year's march. Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan also will be involved in next year's
project, news reports said.
<P>
<B>The Christian Broadcasting Network is airing Micah's Christmas Treasure, an animated
program it produced, in 28 countries including Albania, Australia, China, India, Israel, South
Korea, and Zimbabwe</B>. The one-hour film relates the story of a 12-year-old shepherd and his
sister who follow a star to Bethlehem. "Nothing transcends cultural boundaries as well as
animation," Executive Producer Ben Edwards said. 
<P>
<B>A charity "toy store" for poor children in Memphis was wiped out by thieves</B>. Robbers struck
Dec. 3, taking hundreds of toys from the Christmas Store, run by the Metropolitan Inter-Faith
Association. For 20 years, the poor have visited the toy store to pick out free presents for
their children. Police arrested a man who was seen driving away in a car packed with $1,000
worth of toys. The man's wife and six children also were in the car, police said. Investigators
say a larger vehicle loaded with toys left the scene before police arrived. 
<P>
<B>Youth With A Mission is opening an International Center for Cultural Studies and
Development</B>. Located in Tampa, Fla., the center plans to teach foreign missionaries from a
biblical perspective to appreciate the good in their traditional cultures, YWAM said. Many
ethnic peoples believe that "their cultures are inferior and that they must abandon their
distinctive identity to be truly accepted by God," said founder Sosene Le'au of Samoa.
"Others have found their dignity solely in their culture. Nothing could be further from the
truth." Indigenous peoples have unique qualities from God that "were intended to be
contributed to the body of Christ," he said.

<B>Abortion is the worst way to deal with an unwanted pregnancy, 55% of Americans say,
according to a poll conducted for the Washington, D.C.-based Family Research Council</B>.
Chosen as better options: adoption (29%), marrying the child's father (24%), and single
motherhood (11%). The poll found that 75% of Americans age 18-30 say that the values
portrayed in movies, television, and music lyrics do not reflect their own. Also, 66% of
Americans do not want to increase welfare payments to women who have additional
illegitimate children. The poll was taken by the Voter/Consumer Research firm, which is
based in Bethesda, Md.

<B>Ghana: A clash between Christians and Muslims in Kumasi resulted in 17 arrests last month</B>.
Open-air services were banned in the town after Muslim youths destroyed an evangelist's
public address system and Christian youth retaliated by burning a temporary mosque. In the
northern town of Tamale, police canceled the last service of a five-day Christian crusade
when 4,000 Muslims gathered at the site with a large flag bearing the inscription Jihad. This
month, Muslims broke up an outdoor service at the Kumasi Methodist Church. About 43% of
Ghana's 16 million people are Christians and 12% are Muslim, news reports said. 
<P>
<B>Nigeria: More than 10,000 Christians attended three-day prayer conferences in 30 states</B>. The
conferences were organized by the Congress on Christian Ethics in Nigeria, a broad-based
movement of churches. They were designed to foster reconciliation and unity among Christian
communities, according to World Missionary Press. The CCEN plans to hold a Congress on
Christian Ethics next year to battle immorality in society. 
<P>
<B>Sierra Leone: Five Christian Reformed Church missionaries are returning to the country after
heavy fighting forced them out in 1994</B>. Paul and Mary Kortenhoven and Jan Kisselkoen, who
lost their homes in conflicts between tribal groups and government forces last year, returned
to Freetown, the capital. Another missionary couple will return early next year. Although the
U.S. State Department still classifies the country as "extremely hazardous," the Kortenhovens
advised other missionaries to begin returning.

<B>China: Tibetan Buddhists are protesting the government's intrusion in their religious affairs</B>.
In May the Dalai Lama proclaimed 6-year-old Gedhun Nyima the new Panchen Lama,
Buddhism's second-highest monk (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/052995.html">NIRR 5/29</A>). But last month Communist Party leaders
appointed Gyaincain Norbu, 6, as "soul boy" and recipient of the spirit of the Panchen Lama.
In a ceremony overseen by government officials, the new Panchen was advised to "continue
the tradition of patriotism" shown by his predecessors. The appointment overrides the Dalai
Lama's choice and is a move to block his efforts to have Tibet declared autonomous,
according to news reports. The Dalai Lama is exiled in India. 
<P>
<B>China: Three underground church members were sentenced for dissident activity, news reports
said</B>. Xu Yonghai, a leader in the Beijing Protestant Holy Spirit Association who signed an
anti-government petition this year, received two years. Liu Fenggang and Gao Feng each
received 2  years. 
<P>
<B>Israel: The government plans to renovate Nazareth for the 2000th anniversary of Jesus' birth</B>.
Some $100 million will be spent widening streets, turning 19th-century homes into cafes and
hotels, and restoring historic areas to attract tourists to the area where Jesus spent his youth.
The town, in the country's Arab sector, is the site of the Church of the Annunciation,
traditionally believed to be the spot where the angel Gabriel told Mary she would bear a
child.
<P>
<B>Israel: Some 50,000 worshipers were expected to fill the Church of the Nativity and Manger
Square in Bethlehem on Christmas Eve, Mayor Elias Freij said</B>. With peace restored and the
pullout of Israeli troops, more tourists were expected than in years past. Ten choir groups
from Europe and the United States were to perform in the square. 
<P>
<B>Japan: After revelations about plans for further terrorist attacks by the deadly Aum Shinrikyo
cult (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/103095.html">NIRR 10/30</A>), legislators passed a law bringing religious groups under the control of the
central government</B>. 
<BR><B>...When the law takes effect next year, religions that operate in more than two districts of the
country must register with the Minister of Education, submit financial information, and report
activities at the government's request</B>. Tens of thousands of religious groups operate in the
country and about 100 are added each year, news reports said.
<P>
<B>North Korea: After floods left hundreds of thousands of people homeless, the government is
allowing formation of the country's first nongovernmental agency in 50 years, ASSIST
Communications said</B>. The International Civilian Peace Cooperative and Promotional
Association was formed by MAP Asia, an affiliate of the Brunswick, Ga.-based MAP
International. The Pyonyang-based agency will operate as a cooperative of relief organizations
from the United States, Asia, and Europe to take humanitarian aid to North Korea. 
<P>
<B>Pakistan: A 14-year-old Christian girl accused of blaspheming Muhammad has been forced to
convert to Islam</B>. The alleged blasphemy took place at a Christian school in Sukkur during a
test, according to the International Institute for the Study of Islam and Christianity. Carol
Daphne allegedly defiled the name of Muhammad in one of her answers, her accusers said.
The girl, her family, and the headmistress of the school hid when militant Muslim groups
demanded they be punished for the crime, which carries a death sentence. All Christian
missionary schools in the region were closed until the girl publicly converted to Islam at a
mosque. 
<P>
<B>Philippines: Muslim rebels are ready to resume a war on the government if they are not given
an autonomous state covering 10 southern regions, news reports said</B>. The Moro Islamic
Liberation Front claims it has 80,000 soldiers on Mindanao and nearby islands. The area is
the traditional home of Filipino Muslims, but Christian migration has made them a minority.
Islamicists want Sharia law instituted for Muslims, but will let Christians be ruled by existing
laws. A cease-fire has been in place since the 1970s, but skirmishes occur. If talks fail, the
MILF said it will go to war to claim the territories. Another Islamic force, the Moro National
Liberation Front, is representing Muslims in talks with the government.

<B>Chile: More than 150,000 people attended a five-day Alberto Mottesi crusade in Santiago last
month</B>. Some 7,200 people, including drug dealers, criminals, and prostitutes, made
commitments to follow Christ, according to the Argentine evangelist's organization. Mottesi
also ministered to pastors and leaders of government and business during a weeklong
conference in Santiago. Other evangelistic rallies were held in La Serena, Rancagua, and Vina
del Mar, where 900 people came forward to profess faith in Christ during a rally of 15,000
youth, according to the ministry.
<P>
<B>Chile: Protestants are objecting to proposed legislation that they say maintains the privileged
status of the Roman Catholic Church while allowing the government to intrude in the affairs
of Protestant churches</B>. The law is a step backward from promises made by former President
Patricio Aylwin to downgrade the Catholic Church's official status and raise Protestant
churches to the same level, news reports said.
<P>
<B>Ecuador: A Nazarene missionary was kidnapped from the denomination's seminary in Quito</B>.
Don Cox, 51, from Illinois, was trying to sell his car. Witnesses reported seeing the car speed
off with Cox inside and someone else driving, news reports said. The car later was found
abandoned. Nazarene officials declined to comment. Cox and his wife, Cheryl, have worked
in Ecuador since 1991.

<B>England: Burrswood, a 35-bed hospital outside London, combines the Christian faith with
medical practice</B>. Nurses, doctors, chaplains, counselors, and administrators pray together for
their patients. "Bringing the healing of Jesus Christ to people through medical expertise
coupled with pastoral care and prayer is almost certainly unique in Britain," public relations
officer Jennie O'Keefe told the Canadian newspaper Christian Week. The hospital offers
post-surgical, acute physical, pediatric, and psychiatric care. 
<P>
<B>England: Youth With A Mission announced plans to add a fifth vessel to its fleet of Mercy
Ships</B>. The new ship will be supported by the recently established British board of Mercy
Ships, YWAM said. About 30 Britons serve on the YWAM ship Anastasis. YWAM's goal is
to have 10 ships serving 1 million people by the year 2003 (NIRR 5/16/94).
<P>
<B>Germany: The Bavarian parliament passed a law requiring crucifixes to be hung in school
classrooms to honor the historical and cultural character of Bavaria, a traditionally Catholic
state, news reports said</B>. The law is a response to the German Supreme Court's ruling in
August that crucifixes be removed from Bavarian schoolrooms (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/082195.html">NIRR 8/21</A>). 
<P>
<B>Holland: Seven thousand people from 48 nations will be in Utrecht Dec</B>. 28-Jan. 2 for

Association. TEMA hosts the yearly congress to encourage young people to enter missions
work. About 140 exhibitors will give information about mission fields worldwide and
seminars will educate youth about mission life. A Concert of Prayer is planned from 11 p.m.
to midnight Dec. 31.
<P>
<B>Italy: Pope John Paul II called on national leaders worldwide to be more diligent in protecting
and nurturing children, the Vatican said</B>. Children are forced to fight wars, become slaves and
prostitutes, beg for money, and are deprived of their parents' affection, the pope said. He
condemned ethnic cleansing, the practice of traveling to Asian nations to seek sex with
children, divorce, and a lack of moral guidance. 
<P>
<B>Portugal: The Catholic shrine at Fatima is preparing to receive Iranian Muslims</B>. In October,
Iranian television aired a program claiming that the daughter of Muhammad, not the Virgin
Mary, appeared to three shepherds in 1917. The foreign ministry in Lisbon reported an
increase in Iranians applying for visas and citing a pilgrimage to Fatima as the reason,
according to news reports. Any Muslim visitors to the shrine will be welcomed and treated to
a homily about Fatima, Catholic officials said. Some 4 million Catholics visit the shrine
annually.

Petersburg. An unconfirmed report by Reuters said the cause of the crash was suspicious and
that Savitsky may have been murdered.The Brussels-based Christian Democratic International,
the world union of Christian Democratic Parties, said the accident is suspicious and may have
been murder. Savitsky was killed 10 days before the Parliamentary elections, which his party
was participating in.

<B>Russian Communists are exploiting religion in an attempt to regain political leverage even as
a new report details the horrors of their persecution of religious believers, a Russian
government official said</B>. 
<BR><B>...Communists tortured and killed 200,000 clergy in the Soviet Union, according to the report,
which outlines religious repression from 1917 to 1980</B>. In addition, Communists persecuted
500,000 religious figures and destroyed "40,000 churches, half of the country's Muslim places
of worship, and more than half of the Jewish synagogues, after shooting thousands of church
followers," said Alexander Yakovlev, who released the report. He heads a Yeltsin
administration commission on victims of political repression.  
<BR><B>..."Clergymen were crucified on churches' holy gates, shot, strangled, doused in water in
winter until they froze to death," Yakovlev said</B>. Mass executions of religious leaders and
followers were common, he said. 
<BR><B>...The Soviet government seized church property in 1922, when it was worth 2.5 billion gold
rubles, ostensibly to feed starving people in the Volga River region, the report said</B>. But
Yakovlev said research showed that only 1 million rubles went to buy grain; the rest went to
foreign bank accounts of party officials or "for the needs of world revolution," news reports
said. 
<BR><B>...But after mercilessly repressing religion for 70 years, Russia's resurgent Communist Party is
"falling in love" with it to boost its public image, Yakovlev said</B>. After attempting to destroy
religion, "to fall in love with the church without repentance shows the very extreme of moral
decline." Yakovlev said he hopes the report will cause those in the party to "repent publicly,
as real men, to get on their knees." (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/121195.html">NIRR 12/11/95</A>)

<BR><B>...Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov called Jesus Christ the first Communist because
Jesus wanted justice and "sacrificed his life on the altar of lawlessness, malice, and treachery
to atone for other people's sins</B>." He is campaigning on a platform that fuses Russian
Orthodox faith, nationalism, and strong anti-government sentiments. The Orthodox Church
sees itself as the depository of Russian heritage and tradition, and it wants to protect that,
Andrew Semenchuk of Russian Ministries told NIRR. By aligning itself with the powerful
and not insisting on repentance for crimes against religion, the Orthodox Church can influence
laws that restrict Western religious groups, he said. 
<BR><B>...Few followers of the Communist Party seem bothered by the sudden switch from atheism to
increasingly popular Christian worship, news reports said</B>. Communists are expected to make
significant gains and pose strong opposition to Yeltsin's administration in the Dec. 17
parliamentary elections. NIRR 12/11/95

<B>North American evangelical leaders focused government attention on the plight of persecuted
evangelicals in Chiapas, Mexico, when they visited there last month (NIRR 1/24/94)</B>.
President Eric Perrin of the World Fellowship of Reformed Churches, Paul Gilchrist of the
Presbyterian Church in America, and Cecilio Lajara of Evangelism Explosion, as well as
Mexican evangelical leaders, met with the governor of Chiapas for the first time, Perrin said.
The governor promised to do what he could to help, Perrin said. The group also expressed its
concerns to Zapatista rebel leaders, who sometimes persecute evangelicals for not joining
their movement, and to Catholic Bishop Samuel Ruiz (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/071095.html">NIRR 7/10</A>). 
<BR><B>...Before the arrival of the Americans, evangelical groups in Mexico had failed in repeated
attempts to meet with officials of the Mexican government, Perrin told NIRR</B>. Catholic
leaders, some of whom condone and possibly orchestrate oppression against Mexican
evangelicals, meet regularly with government officials, said Perrin, who helped form the Latin
American Fellowship of Reformed Churches in September.  
<BR><B>...The evangelical population has exploded in Chiapas</B>. In the National Presbyterian Church
alone, membership has grown from 9,000 to 400,000 since 1970. But with the growth has
come persecution: pastors are murdered, churches burned, and private property confiscated on
the orders of caciques, Catholic bosses who control most economic activity in the state, Perrin
said. The caciques oppose evangelicals because they encourage residents to shun local
festivals and alcohol, main sources of their income. Evangelicals have had a "clear economic
impact on the region," he said. In the four days he was in Chiapas, six evangelicals were
murdered, Perrin said. NIRR 12/11/95

<B>After kidnappings, threats, and nearby bombings, the Summer Institute of Linguistics is

<B>Up to 3 million people in Kaifeng, China, watched a televised celebration of the Feast of the
Tabernacles last month</B>. Two local stations aired the events, which were staged at a park,
auditorium, and university. Participants in the celebration included Jewish dancers and singers
from the United States and Israel, and Brunswick, Ga.-based evangelist Sid Roth. 
<BR><B>...The celebration was a cultural event of interest to the several hundred families with Jewish
last names who reside in Kaifeng, in east-central China</B>. But it also clearly presented the
gospel, Roth said. "I explained how God can live inside of man, which is the message behind
the Feast of the Tabernacles." Roth was not permitted to issue an altar call at the events, but
said he believes the celebrations, attended by 3,000 people, and subsequent one-on-one
evangelism had an effect. "I know that a great many accepted Jesus Christ." A highlight of
the trip was an impromptu concert in a hotel, where the group spoke with local Chinese Jews.

<B>The All Japan Revival Mission is spreading the gospel across the country</B>. After 22,000
people became Christians at a 1993 rally led by Japanese evangelist Paul Ariga (NIRR
1/09/94), "God told me to be like a fire and spread the message through all of Japan," he told
NIRR. He and six other ministers have held rallies in six cities, attracting 150,000 people and
leading 31,000 of them to Christ, he said. More than 15,000 people support the rallies with
their prayers, which corporately total at least one hour for every person who attends each
evangelistic service. 
<BR><B>...Ten thousand Japanese made commitments to Christ at a four-day rally led by Carlos
Annacondia in Osaka in August</B>. The Argentine evangelist's emphasis on healing and praying
against spiritual oppression is what Japan needs, Ariga said. At his rallies, Ariga calls on the
Japanese to repent for practicing false religions and making the emperor into a god, and
emphasizes revival among the Japanese people and the reformation of society. 
<BR><B>...He also stresses reconciliation with other countries</B>. Japan has been like a sword destroying
other countries, but God wants to use it to bring reconciliation and revival, said Ariga, a
graduate of the Atlanta-based Haggai Institute. "We have received much prayer and many
missionaries from the world and we want to return those spiritual blessings." NIRR 12/11/95

<B>A Bosnian peace agreement opens the door for Christian ministries to expand their work in
the country</B>. "It's easier to plant churches when there are no bullets flying," Harold Matolka
of Pioneers, an Orlando-based missions agency, told NIRR. Working with Baptist and other
evangelical pastors in Croatia, Slovenia, and Serbia, Pioneers is launching Balkan Harvest, an
initiative to link Western ministries with indigenous church planters in Bosnia and the
surrounding republics. The idea has been dormant for years, but in the past few months it has
been resurrected. Pastors in the former Yugoslavia as well as Pioneers missionaries working
there "realized we were all moving in the same direction -- taking the gospel to Bosnia,"
Matolka said. Pioneers hopes that 25 evangelical ministries will work with each other and
existing churches to minister in the Balkan republics. 
<BR><B>...Samaritan's Purse, a Christian relief and development agency based in Boone, N.C., has

announced it was just wishing," said Ken Isaacs, director of projects. The ministry hopes to
foster small-scale economic activity such as agricultural and livestock development, resettle
refugees, rebuild towns, and assist the medical community. Since 1992, Samaritan's Purse has
supported a field hospital and distributed medicine and food in the region. The ministry will
ship thousands of gift-filled shoe boxes this month for Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian
children affected by the war. NIRR 12/11/95

<B>The Vatican said its ban on women priests is forever</B>. In an attempt to end the ongoing
debate, the Church declared that its stand on women's ordination is an infallible part of
Catholic doctrine, thus cannot be disputed or changed. Church sources said last month's
statement would make it virtually impossible for a future pope to reverse the policy, news
reports said. 
<BR><B>...The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which oversees doctrine, issued the
statement to clear up lingering doubts about the definitive nature of John Paul II's 1994 letter
on women priests</B>. Issued at the pope's request, the CDF statement said Catholics should see
the letter as applying "always, everywhere, and to all faithful" and declared it an
unquestionable part of the "deposit of faith." That stopped just short of the most solemn form
of declaring something infallible -- when the pope does it himself, speaking ex cathedra. This
distinction on forms of infallibility could lead to theological hairsplitting and more debate,
Church sources said. 
<BR><B>..."If this is indeed infallible, then a lot of Catholics are in trouble," Frances Kissling,
president of the U.S.-based Catholics for a Free Choice, told the Reuter news service</B>. The
dissident group said the move was potentially divisive, noting that polls say many Catholics
approve of women priests. The Vatican asserts that it lacks authority to allow women to
become priests because Christ chose only men as his apostles. Church leaders have rejected
assertions by women's groups who say that by choosing only men, Christ merely was acting
in accordance with the social norms of his times. NIRR 12/11/95

<B>U.S</B>. Catholic bishops issued a statement encouraging laity to lead alongside clergy in small
faith communities, parish councils, and theology schools. The church also must subsidize lay
ministries and establish groups on the parish, regional, and national levels to receive the
"wisdom of the laity," the bishops said. "We consider lay participation in church life at all
levels a gift of the Holy Spirit, given for the common good," the bishops said in Called and
Gifted for the Third Millennium. The statement encourages participation from laypeople who
are potential leaders but have become increasingly impatient with restrictions in the
traditionally hierarchical church, news reports said. NIRR 12/11/95

<B>A Southern Baptist missionary who encouraged his congregants to be open to charismatic
practices such as "falling out" under the influence of the Holy Spirit has been fired by the
Foreign Mission Board, news reports said</B>. Charles Carroll and his wife, Sharon, missionaries
to Singapore since 1980, were dismissed from the Community of Praise Baptist Church they
founded in 1990. The couple was encouraging practices "not consistent with what FMB
personnel" should be teaching, according to the dismissal letter, news reports said. 
<BR><B>...FMB president Jerry Rankin said the board gives missionaries leeway in their private
worship, but the Carrolls taught and advocated charismatic practices as normative</B>. "We love
the Foreign Mission Board...I'm not happy to play this thing out in the media," Charles
Carroll said in a Baptist Press report. 
<BR><B>...Southern Baptist missionaries don't have to "quench the Spirit...but you also don't have to
promote a specific experience such as this so that it causes dissension among the churches,"
Rankin said</B>. Rankin has been criticized in the past because he said he has "prayed in the
Spirit" (NIRR 6/28/93). Carroll, whose church grew from 24 to 400 people in five years, said
he was not aware of dissension and that demonstrations of God's power are vital to
evangelizing non-Western cultures. The SBC may miss a move of God by not being open to
charismatic revival, Carroll told Associated Baptist Press. NIRR 12/11/95

Supreme Court appeal</B>. Brittney Settle was given the failing grade after ignoring Dickson
County (Tenn.) Junior High English teacher Dana Ramsey's instruction not to write about
Jesus.  
<BR><B>...The paper was "not an appropriate thing to do in a public school," Ramsey said</B>. She had
told students they could pick any "researchable" topic, and other students wrote about
witchcraft, reincarnation, and magic, news reports said. But Ramsey later noted that Settle has
a strong personal belief in Christianity, making it difficult for her to write dispassionately, and
that students were supposed to research a topic unfamiliar to them. 
<BR><B>...Settle had appealed to the principal, superintendent, and school board, but to no avail</B>. Her
1991 lawsuit was thrown out by a federal judge. Later, that ruling was upheld by the 6th U.S.

<BR><B>...Evangelical church members are giving 2,200 refugees food donated by World Relief, the
aid and development arm of the National Association of Evangelicals</B>. The Lankan
Evangelical Alliance Development Service, an arm of the Lankan Evangelical Alliance, also
helps distribute the food among widows, orphans, and others "on the margin of society" who
have no family support, Bergstrom said. With the government's permission, World Vision
International shipped sleeping mats, blankets, lamps, and clothing into areas held by rebels.
The agencies will continue to send in supplies, spokesmen said. 
<BR><B>...The situation is "life and death," Bergstrom said</B>. He said he hopes that when the war is
over Sri Lankans will allow the church "the opportunity to spread its message." NIRR

<B>An apology left victims of the Foundation for New Era Philanthropy unsatisfied (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/100295.html">NIRR 10/2</A>)</B>.
Donors and charities that lost money to New Era received a 14-minute videotape mailed from
New Era founder John Bennett, Jr. In the video, Bennett says he is "remorseful" for the
losses, blaming them on his managerial weakness rather than evil motives, The Chronicle of
Philanthropy said. "Forgive me for the embarrassment I've caused you," he said in the tape.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged that Bennett ran an illegal scheme
using income from new investors to pay off promises to earlier investors. 
<BR><B>...Bennett said he could not offer specific details because his attorneys had only recently
obtained access to the organization's paperwork</B>. He said he is "committed to seeing that
every donor and charity alike are made whole."  
<BR><B>..."Most people were looking for answers that they did not get," said Paul Nelson, who heads
a coalition of 185 religious groups called United Response to New Era</B>. In the video, Bennett
was penitent and seemed sincere, but "didn't say anything of substance" about whether he
was misled or whether anonymous donors existed, Nelson told NIRR. 
<BR><B>...Christians have not sought retribution against Bennett, Nelson said</B>. "Very little time has
been spent looking backward." NIRR 12/11/95

<B>Some 10,000 Christian schools in India temporarily shut down in support of an effort to
reserve more government jobs for low-caste Hindus who have converted to Christianity</B>. Last
month's two-week campaign included marches, prayer meetings, rallies, and signature drives
all over India, news reports said. 
<BR><B>...Mother Teresa led a prayer meeting supporting the effort and became the object of criticism
from Hindu political leaders who claimed she was mixing faith with politics</B>. The nun, 85,
denied supporting a political agenda and said she was praying for equal rights for all.
Members of low castes are entitled to half of all government jobs, India's Supreme Court
ruled in 1993. Because Christians renounce the caste system, converts are disqualified from
getting the jobs. Of India's 25 million Christians, 16 million are converts from lower castes.

<B>Ernie Preate, Jr., has been spending his free time scrubbing toilets and helping out at a
Scranton, Pa., church</B>. The former Pennsylvania state attorney general, who resigned in June
after admitting that he filed false campaign finance reports to cover $20,000 in contributions
from video poker operators, has volunteered at St. Francis of Assisi Kitchen since October,
news reports said. 
<BR><B>..."It's about penance and starting over," said Preate, 55</B>. Four or five days a week he arrives
before the kitchen opens to prepare for lunch. Then he helps on the serving line, sweeps
floors, and stays afterward to help clean up. 
<BR><B>...Preate is awaiting sentencing of up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine after his mail
fraud conviction</B>. Prosecutors say he is trying to improve his public image. "I presume it's a
spiritual motivation," said Msgr. Constantine Siconolfi, who runs the kitchen. "No one can
know what is in one's heart." NIRR 12/11/95

and Maryland, and was chairman of World Vision-U.S. from 1956 to 1983. 
<BR><B>...Halverson had the "kindest, most loving words...for everyone," according to Sen</B>. Pete

Stanley said. The Stanleys have been married 40 years; they separated in 1992. The trial is
expected to begin in the spring.
<P>
<B>Billy Graham canceled crusades in Australia and New Zealand this February and March
(<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/101695.html">NIRR 10/16</A>)</B>. Doctors were concerned that Graham's long trip and months of separation
from his regular physicians would exacerbate his Parkinson's disease. Graham also was
reluctant to leave his wife, Ruth, who is in pain from a deteriorating lower back and other
medical disorders. 
<BR><B>...Franklin Graham (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/111395.html">NIRR 11/13</A>) will preach in his father's place in Queensland, and possibly
in Sydney, New Zealand, and Melbourne, according to Bob Williams of the Billy Graham
Evangelistic Association</B>. Whereas Billy was scheduled to preach one evening service in each
location, Franklin's youth and energy allows him to preach several nights in each place,
Williams said.  
<BR><B>...The elder Graham still will hold North American crusades, including those in
Minneapolis/St</B>. Paul in June and Charlotte, N.C., in September.

Hatch has taught at the South Bend, Ind., Catholic school since 1975.
<P>
<B>United Methodist Bishop Melvin Talbert, 61, who became president of the National Council
of Churches last month, said fighting racism will lead his agenda</B>. "I'll sound the trumpet, but
for my voice to have credibility the churches must be prepared to respond," he said. Talbert
said the NCC has overcome internal struggles and is ready to address national problems. 
<P>
<B>Cecil Sherman, who has led the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship since 1992 (NIRR 2/24/92),
plans to retire June 30</B>. Sherman, 67, is the first executive of the Fellowship, an alternative
missions agency for moderate Southern Baptists. The CBF has grown from 841 churches in
1992 to 1,405 through September 1995.
<P>
<B>Garner Ted Armstrong resigned as head of the Church of God International and left his
national weekly television program amid allegations that he sexually assaulted Suerae
Robertson, a licensed vocational nurse, during a massage session</B>. She sued in Texas state
court last month seeking unspecified damages from Armstrong, 64, and his church, news
reports said. Robertson, 48, said that after the first assault she secretly videotaped a
subsequent attack. Armstrong denied the allegations. 
<BR><B>...The church leader's father, Herbert W</B>. Armstrong, led the 80,000-member Worldwide
Church of God, based in Pasadena, Calif., until he died in 1986 (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/052995.html">NIRR 5/29</A>). The elder
Armstrong excommunicated his son in 1978 after a falling out. Since then, the younger
Armstrong has had a ministry in Flint, Texas.
<P>
<B>A minister and his wife are at the center of a sex-abuse case in rural Washington, news
reports said</B>. Unordained minister Robert Roberson of East Wenatchee Pentecostal Church of
God and his wife, Connie, are accused of abusing children, including their 5-year-old
daughter, as part of a ring of pedophiles who met in their church. They deny the charges.
Authorities say dozens of children were raped and abused by groups of adults in Wenatchee
and East Wenatchee. Fourteen adults have pleaded guilty and five more have been convicted
in two years, many allegedly connected to the sex ring. 
<BR><B>...But a 220-page study by an independent investigator and media reports pointed to
procedural lapses, inconsistencies in testimony, and apparent conflicts of interest that have led
many in the community to label the crackdown a "witch hunt</B>." U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno is investigating the case.
<P>
<B>The National Conference of Catholic Bishops named Bishop Anthony Pilla of Cleveland as
president</B>. Pilla, 63, is known as a champion of the poor and a bridgebuilder between liberals

presiding bishop Nov. 18 in a chapel at the University of Chicago.
<P>
<B>The National Council of Churches has picked Rodney Page to lead Church World Service, its
relief, development, and refugee assistance arm</B>. Page, a Christian Church (Disciples of
Christ) minister, had been executive director of Ecumenical Ministries of Oregon since 1982.
He was elected Nov. 15 to head the New York-based agency, which operates in 70 countries. 
<P>
<B>Fifteen National Council of Churches leaders prayed and "laid hands" on President Bill
Clinton during the recent government shutdown</B>. The budget was the topic at the Nov. 18
meeting, which lasted about 45 minutes. Then, Nathaniel Linsey of Cincinnati, a bishop of the
Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, led the delegation in prayer as members placed their
hands on Clinton. "This will be a difficult day" in his struggle with Republicans, Clinton told
the group. "This [prayer] is a fine way to begin it." 
<P>
<B>Gordon Hinckley, president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/032095.html">NIRR 3/20</A>),
and two other Mormon officials met with President Clinton Nov</B>. 13. The meeting, arranged
by Clinton, focused on the importance of families. It marked the first official visit of a
Mormon Church president to the White House since 1986, when Ezra Taft Benson met with
Ronald Reagan.
<P>
<B>Trooper Lane Jackstadt (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/052995.html">NIRR 5/29</A>) was fired after a Washington State Patrol investigation</B>.
The department said it discharged Jackstadt for ethics violations and conduct unbecoming a
trooper, news reports said. 
<BR><B>...Jackstadt, a Christian who opposes abortion, delayed a man and woman he had stopped
after discovering they were driving to an abortion clinic</B>. Despite his efforts, the woman had
the procedure the next day. Last spring, jurors failed to reach a verdict on charges of unlawful
imprisonment and official misconduct against Jackstadt. 
<P>
<B>Herschel Hobbs, 88, one of the Southern Baptist Convention's most prominent statesmen in
the last half-century, died Nov</B>. 28 of a heart attack in Oklahoma City. In 1953, Hobbs

doctrinal position. "This is what holds the Southern Baptist Convention together," he said. 
<BR><B>...Hobbs was pastor of First Baptist Church in Oklahoma City until 1972; SBC president in
1952-1953; preacher on The Baptist Hour radio program from 1958 to 1976; and author of

<B>Canada: The government denied applications by seven Christian organizations to operate
single-faith television stations</B>. A spokesperson for the Canadian Radio-Television and
Telecommunications Commission said the programs would not have given a "balanced
presentation of various points of view." Eight applications have been rejected and one
approved since the government allowed single-faith broadcasting (NIRR 9/20/93).

<B>The National Black Evangelical Association, the National Association of Evangelicals, and
the Zondervan Publishing House are asking churches to observe the Sunday before the Martin
Luther King, Jr., holiday each year as Racial Reconciliation Sunday</B>. The groups will help
churches start task forces to improve race relations, initiate interracial friendships, and adopt
sister churches whose members are predominantly of another race. The 1995 observance is
Jan. 14. NAE and NBEA members will be mailed information; others who are interested can
call 1-800-227-5444.
<P>
<B>The Supreme Court let stand a ruling in a Sacramento, Calif., case that requires five abortion
protesters to pay $100,000 in attorneys' fees owed by the operators of an abortion clinic they
targeted</B>. Clinic operators sued the activists, Operation Rescue, and others in a state court in
1989. Their suit sought to bar demonstrators from picketing near the clinic and to collect
lawyers' fees incurred by the operators.

<B>The U.S</B>. Justice Department ended its criminal investigation into Calvin Klein Inc.'s
controversial jean advertising campaign (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/091895.html">NIRR 9/18</A>) without bringing charges. The
Department found that minors had not been used as models in the photos, thus the ads, which
featured young models in provocative poses, did not violate child pornography laws.
<P>
<B>Societies that believe in hell do comparatively better financially, a study says</B>. Economics
professor Brooks Hull of the University of Michigan at Dearborn and Frederick Bold, an
economist in Henderson, Nev., found that societies with a strong belief in hell encourage
appropriate social behavior, and that saves money. "Look at children," Hull said. "It's not
effective to just reward good behavior or punish bad behavior. You have to do both." The
economists reported their findings in the Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics.
<P>
<B>The Salvation Army contacted the Guinness Book of Records hoping to be recognized for its
50-foot-tall steel kettle in St</B>. Paul, Minn. The giant pot, built and donated by a local welding
company and studded with more than 20,000 lights, is a replica of the smaller ones, The
Chronicle of Philanthropy said. The kettle dramatizes growing needs of the poor in order to
raise $1.3 million in St. Paul during the holiday season. If the charity reaches its goal, a bank
of yellow bulbs, suggesting a heap of gold coins, will light up atop the structure.

Bhopal, led the marchers, who blamed political leader Dilip Singhjudeo for arousing hatred
toward Christians and saying they should not convert Hindus.
<P>
<B>India: Catholic nuns in the southern Tamul Nadu region are learning karate</B>. Since 1990,
many priests have been assaulted and some nuns molested, the Union of Catholic Asian News
said. Most laypeople and church leaders approve of the karate lessons, while others say selfdefense is not in keeping with Christ's command to turn the other cheek. "You should prevent
such hits" on some parts of the body, one nun said.
<P>
<B>Japan: The Reformed Church in Japan and Christian Reformed Church missionaries formed
the Society to Promote Christian Education</B>. Students need a biblical worldview to better

<B>England: Chris Brain, whose rave Masses featuring rock music and light shows attracted
young people to Anglican church services (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/090495.html">NIRR 9/4</A>), resigned from the Church of England
priesthood amid charges of sexual misconduct</B>. In the United States, Brain's rave Masses had
attracted thousands of unchurched young people. Episcopalian priest Matthew Fox and Brain
had planned to create a Planetary Mass center in Oakland, Calif., but Fox dropped the idea
when the misconduct charges were leveled against Brain in August. 
<BR><B>...In a BBC documentary, Brain acknowledged "improper sexual conduct." The BBC quoted a
young woman as saying that Brain said their sexual activity was part of "discovering a
post-modern definition of sexuality within the church</B>."  England: Queen Elizabeth II attended
a Catholic Mass last month, making her the first British monarch in modern times to do so.
Protestant critics shouted at the queen as she greeted Cardinal Basil Hume and entered the
Westminster Cathedral in a celebration of its 100th anniversary. The Queen's visit is an
"affirmation" of Catholics in England, Hume said, according to news reports.
<P>
<B>France: Twenty thousand abortion-rights supporters clashed with 200 pro-life advocates prior
to an abortion-rights march in Paris last month</B>. Before the march, pro-life demonstrators
shouted and threw tomatoes at the crowd, according to news reports. The abortion-rights
group responded with bricks and bottles, prompting police to intervene.
<P>
<B>Germany: U.S</B>. Army Specialist Michael New, a professed Christian, was formally charged in
Wurzburg last month with disobeying an order to don a United Nations uniform (NIRR
11/13). His trial begins late this month. New reportedly considers the U.N. a "foreign power."
<P>
<B>Germany: The Bible that Martin Luther used to translate the Scriptures from Latin to German
has been discovered at the Wuerttemberg State Library in Stuttgart</B>. The Bible evidently had
been purchased unknowingly by the Duke of Wuerttemberg in 1784 as part of a larger
collection. Luther's translation is regarded as the cornerstone of modern German literature,
news reports said.
<P>
<B>Russia: The Voice of the Martyrs will ship three 40-foot containers of winter clothing to
Russian cities and neighboring countries, ASSIST Communications said</B>. The ministry has
received 1.5 tons of warm clothing a day since it began soliciting help for the Russians, it
said. The goods will be distributed by pastors who will tell the recipients about Christ. To
contribute to the project, send coats, sweaters, or blankets to Coats for Russia, The Voice of
the Martyrs, P.O. Box 443, Bartlesville, OK 74005-0443.
<P>
<B>Spain: About 100 people became Christians during a 13-day evangelism campaign by
Southern Baptist volunteers from the United States and local churches</B>. They distributed
literature and Bibles and held services for 3,000-4,000 people, news reports said. The number
of decisions for Christ was significant because many churches have no new converts for
months at a time, the Spanish Baptist Union said. About 70,000 of the country's 40 million
people are evangelicals.

<B>Thousands of Christians from across the United States and 90 countries converged at six
events Nov</B>. 13-19 in Los Angeles. The diverse groups of people prayed, fasted, reconciled
their differences, and shared strategies to spread the gospel. The simultaneous nature of the
events was unplanned. "God brought a lot of powerful prayer people together for His
purposes," said Debra Austin, an official of the women's group Aglow International. "We
may not understand it all, but there is a battle being waged" in heaven and "it is something
big." 
<BR><B>...Leaders and laypeople confessed their sins and wept over evil in America during Fasting &
Prayer '95, a conference of 3,500 people Nov</B>. 16-18 at the Los Angeles Convention Center.
In another part of the building, 1,500 people from 30 nations attended 50 workshops on
prayer's power to transform the world's cities. They were part of the first Global Conference
on Prayer Evangelism, sponsored by San Jose, Calif.-based Harvest Evangelism.  
<BR><B>...In nearby Long Beach, 8,000 women from 90 countries met Nov</B>. 16-19 at an Aglow
International conference. They prayed, worshiped, and learned how to improve their outreach
to prisoners, teen-agers, and women who have had abortions. Aglow International President
Jane Hansen spoke about the dignity of women and their changing roles in society and
ministry. "While reconciliation is necessary between people groups and nations," Aglow's
Austin said, "the first reconciliation, outside of our relationship with the Lord, needs to be
between men and women." 
<BR><B>...Meanwhile, 9,000 men were praying, worshiping, and studying biblical truths Nov</B>. 18 at the
Anaheim Convention Center. Seven Calvary Chapel pastors addressed the men at Wait
Training, a conference sponsored by Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa. Speakers focused their
remarks on Isaiah 40:31, which directs believers to look to the Lord to renew their spiritual
strength and vision. "Many men are at the end of their own devices and schemes," said Carl
Westerlund, a pastor and men's ministry leader at the church. Several hundred men came
forward to make first-time commitments to Christ or rededicate themselves during the
conference, Westerlund said.  
<BR><B>...In Van Nuys, Jack Hayford's Church On The Way hosted 1,500 pastors from 35
denominations across the United States Nov</B>. 13-16 at its annual pastors' conference. The
theme was prayer, according to Scott Bauer, senior associate pastor. To find that his church
was in "such great company" with praying Christians coming to Los Angeles from around the
world "was astounding," Bauer said. "It seems the Holy Spirit targeted L.A. for prayer after
our city has been so devastated over the last years," he said, citing the riots after the Rodney
King verdict, the O.J. Simpson verdict that "divided the city so badly," earthquakes, fires, and
floods. "The Lord is beginning a new work of His grace." 
<BR><B>...At Fasting & Prayer '95, leaders described the dire situation of the United States and
pleaded with God to withhold further judgment</B>. God has removed His "hedge of protection"
from the country, and the resulting natural disasters and various economic and social troubles
are just a taste of what America will suffer if it does not repent, said Adrian Rogers, pastor of
Bellevue Baptist church in Memphis, Tenn. Everyone must repent, he said. "We dare not
identify ourselves with any political party -- we need to tell all of them to repent," the former
Southern Baptist Convention president said. 
<BR><B>...Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ noted that Americans have turned to fasting and
prayer in times of great crises</B>. During the Civil War, when Americans were killing each other
by the hundreds of thousands, Abraham Lincoln issued a proclamation calling the country to
fast and pray for forgiveness of sins and healing of society, Bright noted.  
<BR><B>...God can work in seemingly impossible situations, Colombian Christian leader Julio Ruibal
told delegates</B>. He described how the infamous Cali cocaine cartel disintegrated after 22,000
Christians prayed all night in a stadium (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/082195.html">NIRR 8/21</A>). Although 150 people ordinarily die in
drug-related violence each weekend in Cali, on the day they prayed civil authorities reported
that there was not one murder, he said. Since then, every major Cali cartel leader has been
imprisoned and "the night life in Cali has totally changed." Subsequently, believers are
meeting in stadiums all over the country for all-night prayer. "I bear witness that nothing is
impossible for God," Ruibal said.  
<BR><B>...Repentance must begin with Christians, Nancy Leigh DeMoss of Life Action Ministries told
the delegates (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/080795.html">NIRR 8/7</A>)</B>. "Revival begins when we see God and cry out `woe to me,'" she
said. The church needs a "holy dissatisfaction with business as usual." Can Christians "get
honest enough to let God tear a hole in our 20th-century respectable Christianity" in order to
root out "hidden springs of pride and self-sufficiency?" she asked. Delegates wailed with grief
as Kay Arthur, co-founder of Precept Ministries, who wore a dark robe of repentance, led
them in an impassioned prayer. 
<BR><B>...Dozens of well-known speakers led the conference</B>. They prayed for the media, students,
and Christian athletes. Jerry Kirk of the National Coalition for the Protection of Children and
Families pleaded with God to turn back the tide of pornography in the land. Other speakers
included Tony Evans, president of Urban Alternative; Hayford; Joe Aldrich, president of
Multnomah Ministries; David Bryant, founder and president of Concerts of Prayer
International; Paul Cedar, president of the Evangelical Free Church of America; and Evelyn
Christenson, president of Evelyn Christenson Ministries. Others were evangelist and author
Peter Marshall; Randy Phillips, president of Promise Keepers; Pat Robertson, chairman of the
board of the Christian Broadcasting Network; Vonette Bright, co-founder of Campus Crusade
for Christ; Don Argue, president of the National Association of Evangelicals; and E.V. Hill,
senior pastor of Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church in Los Angeles. 
<BR><B>...Some events at the prayer evangelism conference were dramatic</B>. General sessions included
emotional times of repentance and forgiveness among individuals of various racial and ethnic
groups, including African Americans, Native Americans, and Asian Americans. Toronto
Vineyard pastor Randy Clark said that, in the excitement and confusion during the initial
outpouring of the Toronto Blessing (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/022095.html">NIRR 2/20</A>), he and his staff may have acted "naively
and rashly" about its impact on the body of Christ and failed to respond lovingly to criticism.
"In any move of the Spirit there is some fleshly stuff attached to it," Clark said. "If we made
anyone feel less than us, or not as good as us, I'm sorry." An unidentified Southern Baptist
pastor tearfully accepted the apology, then asked forgiveness for what he described as his
denomination's "pride and arrogance" toward the Toronto movement and the rest of the
church.  
<BR><B>...A black pastor asked Koreans, Hispanics, and whites who were harmed in the South-Central
Los Angeles riots after the Rodney King verdict to forgive his community for the "terror,
violence, and destruction of the city</B>." Those on stage wept as a Korean pastor, representing
95 congregants who lost their businesses in the riots, accepted the apology and confessed that
Asians have "taken economic advantage of our deprived brothers and sisters." A white man
whose father suffered serious injuries in the riots and was forced to retire from the sheriff's
department also accepted the apology. 
<BR><B>...A black police officer admitted that the Los Angeles Police Department harassed minorities,
planted evidence, and falsified reports</B>. He confessed "breaking our covenant and vows to
protect you, and becoming a law unto ourselves. To every race we have offended -- forgive
us," he said. The crowd rose and cheered as John Dawson of Youth With A Mission blessed
the police. Neil Anderson of Freedom in Christ Ministries in La Habra, Calif., repented on
behalf of clergy who have sexually abused female parishioners.  
<BR><B>...Also, 60 college students from 20 schools around the country met in a Los Angeles hotel to
relate stories about the effects of the dramatic renewal that occurred on their campuses last
spring (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/041795.html">NIRR 4/17</A>)</B>. Similar times of public repentance have occurred this fall at the
University of Illinois at Champagne-Urbana, King College in Bristol, Tenn., and at an Indiana
State Baptist Convention's business meeting, student leader Matt Yarrington of Wheaton
College said. At Gordon College and Biola University, renewal has prompted many students
to minister in the local communities and to consider missions careers, according to Gary
Stratton, dean of the chapel at Gordon, located in Wenham, Mass. Interest in prayer and
fasting is keen, and many more faculty and students are discipling newer believers, he said.  
<BR><B>...Community members joined delegates in a March for Jesus through a portion of
South-Central Los Angeles as the meetings concluded</B>. Then they returned to the Convention
Center for a joint communion service and joyous praise-and-worship celebration featuring
music and choreography led by Steve Fry and choruses by English musician Graham
Kendrick. 
<BR><B>...All week, believers from hundreds of Los Angeles churches were fasting and praying for
the city and for conference delegates</B>. Meanwhile, in an initiative organized by Lift L.A., an
interdenominational group, delegates joined local believers in early-morning "prayer
excursions." They walked and prayed quietly at more than 100 areas of greater Los Angeles,
including racially tense neighborhoods, motion picture studios, and government buildings.
Five to 100 people went on each of the excursions. Area pastors said the prayers focused on
the city heartened them. John Lo, pastor of the First Evangelical Church in Glendale, a
predominantly Chinese-American congregation, said, "It told us God has not given up on L.A.

<B>The evangelistic drama Heaven's Gates and Hell's Flames is playing in Bakersfield, Calif.,
and 42,552 people have streamed into the First Assembly of God to see it (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/090495.html">NIRR 9/4</A>)</B>. The
church said that 10,399 people signed cards indicating their decision to become Christians and
approximately 1,560 more people came forward but did not turn in cards. The play
dramatically depicts heaven and hell. 
<BR><B>..."It's a people's movement," pastor Robert Johnson told NIRR</B>. "The newly saved are
bringing others to be saved night after night." The drama is the talk of the city. When
Johnson goes to restaurants, waitresses tell him they accepted Christ because of the play, he
said.  
<BR><B>...The church has received many testimonials from people touched by the play</B>. Among the
stories: a 17-year-old girl who had tried to commit suicide three days earlier became a
Christian after attending a performance; converted drug dealers told a former customer, "this
is all we deal now," and gave him a flyer advertising the play; eight members of one family
were saved during the play; a TV cameraman covering the play was led to Christ; and a
couple who had been living together for four years asked to be married after attending the
drama.  
<BR><B>...A woman who came forward with help from friends said she was in the final stages of
AIDS and asked repeatedly to hear all the Bible's stories because she didn't know anything
about them</B>. Two heroin addicts, on their way to attend an Ozzy Osbourne concert, "somehow
arrived at Heaven's Gates instead." They sat on the front row and were "wonderfully
transformed," according to the church. After becoming a Christian, a crack user attended a
Narcotics Anonymous meeting and found that half the group had attended Heaven's Gates.

<B>Some 1,500 Christians from 34 states and three foreign countries attended the seventh annual
conference of the Christian Community Development Association Nov</B>. 8-12 in Denver.
CCDA links and supports 300 grass-roots urban ministries. Seventy workshops covered
evangelism, reconciliation, health care, housing, economic development, and welfare.
Pre-conference tracks on Hispanic and youth ministries offered additional training. 
<BR><B>...Conference speakers commended and critiqued the CCDA</B>. Jim Wallis, editor of Sojourners
magazine, said the nation is in a spiritual crisis that "politics as usual cannot touch."
Americans need "something deeper, and I believe that [CCDA] represents that alternative."
Promise Keepers founder Bill McCartney lauded attendees for their ministry and called on
them to pray. That exhortation was echoed by CCDA Chairman John Perkins and President
Wayne Gordon. 
<BR><B>...Professor Manuel Ortiz of Westminster Theological Seminary challenged the group</B>. "If a
movement is going to be a movement and not a moment, we have to have evaluation as well
as celebration," he said. Ortiz asked the leadership of CCDA to consider whether the
association is truly inclusive of all minorities. "We have got to talk about who makes
decisions. We have to believe in the inherent dignity of the people being developed, and we
all have to bring what we believe is essential to the table." Board members have begun to
consider ways to increase the scope and depth of Hispanic, Asian, and Native American
participation and responsibility in the association. NIRR 11/27/95

<B>Evangelical Christian political movements in Latin America increased from one to 20 in the
past five years, said Jose Gonzalez of Semilla, a ministry to the region (NIRR 5/31/93)</B>. A
demand by the growing evangelical population for more religious freedom in the heavily
Catholic countries has prompted the new political movements. 
<BR><B>...Evangelical politicians, pastors, businessmen, and political advisers are developing strategies
together to bring their faith to bear on government, Gonzalez told NIRR</B>. In 1992, Gonzalez
met with 4,500 such Christians during a tour of 18 Latin American countries. Their goal is to
"join politics in a way that does not politicize the Gospel, but brings the gifts of the body to
the functioning of government," he said. In September, 250 evangelicals from 20 Latin
American nations gathered in Miami for Encuentro '95, a forum for discussion, prayer, and
networking. "It was wonderful to be at a `political' gathering where spontaneous prayer
happened...and people laid hands on and blessed one another and their nations," Gonzalez
said. Campus Crusade founder Bill Bright and evangelist Alberto Mottesi were among 40
speakers.  NIRR 11/27/95

<B>A small Bible school in Seattle, Wash., trains immigrants and refugees to minister in the
United States</B>. Students at the International Bible School are of Ukrainian, Russian,
Vietnamese, and Hispanic origin. Many were pastors in their homelands, yet lack formal
theological training. At the school, they study the Bible in their own languages and learn to
plant, and pastor churches. 
<BR><B>...Students can work toward a certificate or study further and apply for credentials from the
Assemblies of God, according to Chris Thomas, IBS president</B>. Thomas, a missionary for 25
years, founded the school in 1990 and has been its only teacher until recently. With the help
of volunteer interpreters, Thomas has worked one-on-one with the students at Calvary Temple
and other Seattle locations. About 181 languages are spoken in the United States, and there
are great needs among ethnic people, he told NIRR.

<B>An evangelism strategy effective in rural India is beginning to take hold in the United States</B>.
Neighborhood Houses of Prayer are small Christian groups that meet to pray weekly for their
neighbors. They solicit prayer requests, then follow up with phone calls and small, tangible
acts of kindness. In India, more than 100,000 villages have prayer groups and 3 million
people have become Christians in the last 10 years as a result of the strategy, according to
Don Chapman, director of operations of Mission India 2000. Indian churches often are started
by students from the Grand Rapids, Mich.-based ministry's School of Evangelism, who travel
door-to-door. Each student starts 8-10 churches and sees 50-100 conversions in a year,
Chapman said. Most new converts were Hindus.  
<BR><B>...Neighborhood Houses of Prayer have formed in the United States in the last nine months,
Chapman told NIRR</B>. John DeVries, head of Mission India 2000, and Alvin VanderGriend,
head of the Christian Reformed Church's Office of Evangelism, wrote a curriculum and
produced a training video for churches and individuals. People in about a dozen cities have
used the idea because it helps them attract the unchurched rather than congregants from other
churches, Chapman said. For information, call (800) 217-5200. NIRR 11/27/95

<B>The Senate vote to send the partial-birth abortion bill (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/111395.html">NIRR 11/13</A>) to the Judiciary
Committee for hearings could weaken it, pro-life groups said</B>. In the House version of the bill,
the procedure is allowable if an abortion doctor can prove he reasonably believed the
woman's life was in danger. Opponents of the current bill want to expand the limit, saying
the procedure also should be allowed when the woman's health is in danger, an exception that
would give doctors carte blanche to perform the procedure, National Right to Life Committee
Legislative Director Douglas Johnson said. President Clinton said he will not support the bill
if it passes the Senate without safeguards for the health of the mother, news reports said.

<B>Evangelical leaders, seeking to protect religious nonprofits, are supporting key provisions in
the Senate's Welfare Reform Bill</B>. The provisions call for religious nonprofits to be eligible to
participate in state welfare programs without being forced to deny their religious identity.
Inserted by Sen. John Ashcroft (R-Mo.), the provisions would allow religious organizations to
participate in programs such as job training, housing, and drug counseling without sacrificing
"precisely that part of their program that makes them so effective," Evangelicals for Social
Action president Ron Sider said. It is likely that groups such as the American Civil Liberties
Union would oppose government funds going to religious organizations, ESA's Fred Clark
told NIRR. The provisions are important because "they are a safety against religious bias,"
Clark said. The bill is in Senate committee. 
<BR><B>...Growing evidence shows that "faith-based programs are often more successful" and more
cost-effective in correcting social problems than other programs, Sider said</B>. Groups such as
The Salvation Army, Teen Challenge, and Alcoholics Anonymous are successful because of
their faith-based components, Clark said. Social problems stem from spiritual, as well as
socio-economic, reasons and "money by itself won't solve the problem," Sider said. He also
pointed out that if the provisions are passed, they will provide an "acid test of whether
evangelical Christians truly believe" in helping the poor. NIRR 11/27/95

<B>Proposed congressional budget cuts in international aid -- some $1.2 billion -- will cause
enormous harm to the world's poor, Christian ministries and advocacy groups say</B>. About
$200 million of that had been earmarked for long-term development in Africa, which "will tilt
into greater disaster" without it, Tom Getman of World Vision told NIRR. By spending less
money on development, "the more fragile countries" will sink into civil conflict, necessitating
more relief funds, he said. For example, Liberia, where a civil war just ended, needs money
to resettle soldiers and help civilians rebuild.  
<BR><B>...To make up for the cuts, the average American donor would have to contribute 50% more
to his or her regular giving to relief agencies, said David Beckman of Bread for the World, an
advocacy group for the hungry</B>. "We are privately generous, but publicly stingy." Because
America is a world leader, the reductions tell other countries that cutting aid is an acceptable
action for them. "This speaks volumes to Germany, France, and England," Beckman said.

create a "communion of communions" called the Church of Christ Uniting among nine
mainline denominations. COCU churches would recognize one another's ordained ministries
and members could receive Communion in any of the churches, which would retain their own

<B>Jehovah's Witness leaders called for an end to forecasting the exact date of Judgment Day,
when the sect believes only its 144,000 true followers will be saved</B>. The Witnesses had
warned that the generation that was aware of events in 1914 -- purportedly the year Jesus
"returned," but only to rule in the heavenly realm -- would not die before seeing Armageddon
and the dawn of a new world. But the sect's leaders, cited in its official Watchtower
magazine, now say that re-examination of Scripture prompted them to see "this generation" as
the people of a historical era rather than the lifespan of certain individuals. The prediction had
added an urgency to the door-to-door message that time is short, observers said. Jehovah's
Witnesses number 4.7 million members including 900,000 in the United States. Charles
Russell, founder of the movement, first predicted the world would end in 1914. Two more
false alarms occurred in 1925 and 1975. NIRR 11/27/95

<B>Taize, an ecumenical communal prayer movement based in France, is taking root in the
United States</B>. Taize (Tez-EH) takes its name from a village in eastern France. There, in 1940,
Roger Schutz, a Calvinist pastor's son, and three friends established a community in hopes
that World War II would end if Christians united. Schutz now is an 80-year-old monk known
as Brother Roger. 
<BR><B>...Taize programs have proved popular among young people in Japan, India, England,
Germany, and Eastern Europe</B>. Large Taize events draw tens of thousands of young people;
an annual international Taize prayer gathering drew 110,000 adherents to Paris last winter
(<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/111395.html">NIRR 11/13</A>). Brother Roger, a recipient of the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion,
lives simply and reportedly is fond of saying that he and his fellow monks want to be seen as
"people who listen, never as spiritual masters." 
<BR><B>...Adherents say Taize is not a new religion but a way to renew spirituality and take it back to
their churches</B>. Taize takes the forms of monastic chant, simple silences, candles, and incense
burning. A Taize hymnal contains plain, repetitive melodies that are sung, harmonized, or
improvised. Whatever instruments are brought are used; there is no preaching. Taize "cell
groups" emphasize prayer, meditation, and community involvement.  
<BR><B>...In the United States, Taize has an increasing number of adherents</B>. Many are young, and
include Catholics and some Protestants. Bob Morrison of Cleveland Heights, Ohio, who
traveled to the Taize monastery with his wife, said, "The silences are so perfect, so
cleansing." He told the Cleveland Plain Dealer that "after 10 minutes, my head was
completely clear, and after the third or fourth prayer, I could hear God clearly." Morrison said
he regrets missing a gathering in India that interspersed mantra chants with Taize.

conservative Christian circles</B>. Families in which courtship is practiced usually restrict
exclusive male-female friendships until a couple is spiritually and financially ready for
marriage. That ordinarily eliminates dating during the teen years, they say. When a young
man wants to court a young woman, he contacts her father for permission. If the answer is
yes, he participates in their family activities as well as sees the young woman alone.  
<BR><B>...Courtship may seem impractical but it has advantages over dating, proponents say</B>. When
courting, young people can get to know each other gradually, without undue pressure.
Courtship also allows the family to get to know the young person who is interested in one of
their children. 
<BR><B>...Dating opens the door unnecessarily to heartache and disappointment, adherents of courtship
say</B>. It does not make sense "to train for a long-term marriage by pursuing what all too often
is a series of short-term relationships," said Jim Ryun in Focus on the Family magazine.
Baggage left over from dating can be frustrating and painful, he said. The former world
recordholder in the mile and his wife, Anne, have four adult children in their 20s, all of
whom adhere to the courtship model. "We have seen some very encouraging results," he said,
including his children's "desire to be available to the Lord." 
<BR><B>...The number of people considering courtship as an alternative to dating has increased,
especially in the last five years, Springville, Calif., minister Jonathan Lindvall said</B>. He has
conducted seminars on youth topics for 10 years in the United States and Canada.

<B>Five hundred sociologists and other scholars discussed women in church leadership during a
joint conference of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion and the Religious
Research Association Oct</B>. 27-29 in St. Louis. If trends continue, there will be as many
ordained women as men by 2024, said the `University of Connecticut's Edgar Mills, Religion
News Service reported.  
<BR><B>...Women seminary graduates have made gains in finding jobs, said researcher Patricia Chang
of the Institute for Church Life at the University of Notre Dame</B>. However, in mainline
churches, the shrinking job pool may create a backlash against women clergy as they compete
with men, said sociologist Paula Nesbitt of Denver's Iliff Theological Seminary. In the future,
clergy will tend to be older since women often enter the ministry later in life than men, as
well as more theologically liberal, Mills said. 
<BR><B>...African-American women gradually have moved into white mainline denominations where
they can serve as pastors, said Delores Carpenter, professor of religious education at Howard
University's Divinity School in Washington, D.C</B>. Black women pastors tend to be more
politically active and open to Pentecostal and charismatic practices than white pastors, she
said. NIRR 11/27/95

<B>Matthew Allen, the 13-year-old boy with AIDS whose story was told by his grandfather,
Jimmy Allen, a former president of the Southern Baptist Convention, died of the disease</B>.
Allen revealed his family's painful struggle, including their disappointment with the church,
in Burden of a Secret: A Story of Truth and Mercy in the Face of AIDS (Moorings). Matthew
Allen's mother, Lydia, contracted HIV from a blood transfusion hours before he was born.
The virus also passed on to his younger brother, Bryan, before the bad blood was discovered;
Bryan died in 1986, Lydia in 1992. 
<BR><B>...Churches had refused to help the family</B>. Matthew's uninfected father, Scott, was fired as
minister of education at his church in Colorado, and Matthew was dismissed from the
church's day-care center. When the family moved to Dallas to live with Jimmy Allen and his
wife, church after church refused to enroll Matthew in Sunday school, according to the book.
"Good churches. Great churches. Wonderful people. Churches pastored by fine men of God,
many of whom I had mentored. Nobody had room for a boy with AIDS," Allen wrote. 
<BR><B>...Matthew had said, however, that he felt accepted at the public Lakewood Elementary
School, where he attended the fourth grade until last December</B>. He said his classmates
supported him once they found out he had AIDS. NIRR 11/27/95

<B>When Will Harrison discovered a "long-lost cousin" with the same last name at Eastern
Mennonite University in Harrisonburg, Va., he didn't realize the unusual situation he would
encounter</B>. Will is white, his cousin Darrell is black, but both men trace their roots to the
same Virginia plantation, according to The Reconciler magazine. As their mutual ties to an
18th-century plantation-owning colonel emerged, Will struggled with guilt and Darrell with
anger, the publication said. Both are determined to make their brotherhood in Christ their
primary bond. "I think it's something God wants me to do," Darrell said of coming to terms
with his mixed-race heritage.

<B>Arkansas Southern Baptists chose President Bill Clinton's pastor, Rex Horne, to lead the
Baptist State Convention</B>. Horne (NIRR 9/19/94), pastor of Immanuel Baptist Church in Little
Rock, received 482 votes, beating conservative Stephen Davis, a Russellville pastor, who had
398. Fellow Baptists have criticized Horne for Clinton's policies on abortion and homosexual
rights, though he disagrees with the president on those issues, news reports said.
<P>
<B>Andy Stanley, 37, son of First Baptist Church of Atlanta pastor Charles Stanley and former
preacher at the church's satellite congregation in Dunwoody, Ga., will start a new church in
Atlanta's northern suburbs, news report said</B>. Stanley resigned from the satellite church in
August over concern about his father's leadership of the 13,000-member congregation during
a pending divorce (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/082195.html">NIRR 8/21</A>). Stanley told the Atlanta Constitution that resigning was hard
on his relationship with his father, but "we've moved on beyond that." He also said he has a
"great relationship" with his mother. The new church will be affiliated with the Southern
Baptist Convention and geared to people who feel disenfranchised by traditional churches,
Andy Stanley said.

federal district judge ruled</B>. Nobles, 70, swallowed cyanide in a San Francisco hotel room as
FBI agents closed in to arrest him. He suffered some brain disfunction in subsequent surgery.
Nobles also suffers from confabulation, a mental condition in which a person makes up
stories to fill in memory gaps, medical experts testified.

center. "The Lord has blessed me in so many different ways to have a few dollars and a little
bit of success," Johnson told the congregation. "It was all because of the Lord."

applies in Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Michigan, and could help military families fight
such rules elsewhere, news reports said.

<B>Episcopal Church leaders called for churchwide enforcement of a rule permitting the
ordination of women to the priesthood</B>. Under the resolution by the church's executive
council, meeting in Birmingham, Ala., bishops who oppose women's ordinations could refuse
to perform them, but would have to make sure ordination is available to women in their
dioceses, news reports said. The resolution follows similar action by the denomination's
House of Bishops (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/101695.html">NIRR 10/16</A>). The issue is to be decided by the church's General
Convention in 1997.

<B>A homosexual student group's attempts to gain official recognition at Texas Wesleyan
University have stirred controversy at the Fort Worth school, which is affiliated with the
United Methodist Church</B>. The Student Government Association and a Student Life
Committee approved the group Gays, Lesbians, and Extras. However, university president
Jake Schrum vetoed the decisions since the UMC does not sanction homosexuality or fund
homosexual groups. 
<P>
<B>A group of 10,000 Catholics says it will campaign for "open priesthood</B>." Call to Action,
based in Chicago, will use educational programs and prayer services in an attempt to persuade
church leaders to open the priesthood to women and married men. The priest shortage,
ordination of married men, the role of women in the church, low priestly morale, and the
quality of candidates being attracted to the priesthood must be discussed, the group said. If
trends hold until 2005, the U.S. Church will have undergone a 40% decline in the number of
priests and a 65% increase in the size of the Catholic population since 1955, the group said.
<P>
<B>The Church of God School of Theology in Cleveland, Tenn., created an Institute of Church

sexual misconduct, and accidents in church buildings, said Cecil Knight, president of the
theology school. Bill Watts, a lawyer who taught business law at the COG's nearby Lee
College, will direct the institute, which will feature workshops and classroom courses.

<B>Michael New, a Christian, is being tried by a U.S</B>. military court for refusing to serve under
the United Nations' authority. New, 22, the son of Wycliffe missionaries, is a medic with the
3rd Infantry Division of the U.S. Army in Schweinfurt, Germany.   
<BR><B>...When told that his unit was being deployed as part of a U.N</B>. peacekeeping force in
Macedonia, New refused to wear the U.N. beret and insignia or serve under its command,
according to his attorney, Col. Ronald Ray. New took an oath to defend the U.S. Constitution
and would serve anywhere for the U.S. military, Ray said. But he believes the U.N. is "a
foreign power" and does not regard the U.N. Charter and the U.S. Constitution as "compatible
documents," the attorney said. New indicated that he is concerned about serving under the
U.N. Charter rather than the Constitution, which is based on religious principles he believes
in, such as God-given rights. 
<BR><B>...New's superiors offered him a nonjudicial punishment, which is similar to a civilian
misdemeanor</B>. But New chose the court-martial proceedings, which would give him a public
hearing. Preliminary proceedings have begun in the trial. If convicted, New could serve six
months at hard labor, lose two-thirds of his pay for six months, and receive a bad-conduct
discharge. 
<BR><B>...New grew up in Texas, New Zealand, Papau New Guinea, and the Philippines and was
home-schooled for more than 10 years</B>. He has specialized in linguistic research and
community development and is a Gulf War veteran who was cited for meritorious service for
saving the life of one soldier and the sight of another. "Private First Class New embodies the
spirit of the American soldier...All the soldiers of...1st platoon look up to him and have
confidence in him as a combat medic," his commander wrote in the citation. 
<BR><B>..."It is every father's dream to have a boy who will be willing to stand up for the truth</B>. God
answered this father's dream," said Daniel New, Michael's father, who lives in Houston.

<B>Thousands of Christians of various denominations and races prayed together in some 200
American cities Oct</B>. 21 during the first National Concert of Prayer. Believers focused their
intercession on cities, pastors, the nation, and the unreached people of the world. 
<BR><B>...More than 800 people from 61 churches prayed together in Jacksonville, Fla</B>. In St. Louis,
300 took part, and there were 600 from 35 churches praying together in Grand Island, Neb.
Gatherings in other cities were smaller. "Who despises the day of small beginnings?" asked a
believer in Sylvester, Ga., one of three people from two churches who prayed. In Antelope
Valley, Calif., a homosexual-rights rally and a concert of prayer took place in the same park;
several of the activists asked believers about Christ because of the prayers they had heard
over the loudspeakers.  
<BR><B>...Unity was evident despite the variety of prayer and worship styles at many of the concerts</B>.
"We truly were one church for those few hours," an organizer in San Fernando, Calif., said. A
believer in New Iberia, La., credited "eagerness to work together for the advancement of the
kingdom of God" that resulted in a "special anointing of unity." 
<BR><B>...Many reconciled with their fellow believers</B>. At a concert of prayer among 38 people in
Kenton, Ohio, pastors asked forgiveness for failing to work together and committed
themselves to praying together regularly. In Harrisburg, Pa., 120 believers prayed in a high
school that had suffered racial tensions. A local pastor whose son was killed a few weeks
earlier said his family had a mission "to pray for the man who shot my son."  
<BR><B>...The rallies renewed enthusiasm to spread the gospel</B>. A highlight was "the joy on pastors'
faces as they spoke, expecting revival," said an organizer in Myrtle Beach, S.C. In Spokane,
Wash., "the Lord moved in our hearts when one man wept as he was leading us in prayer for
our city," an organizer said.  
<BR><B>...The rallies are being planned annually, according to its sponsors, Concerts of Prayer
International and March For Jesus</B>. "Many believe the acceleration of united prayer for
spiritual awakening and world evangelization is the key evidence that God is, in fact, ready to
pour out His Spirit in an unprecedented way," said COPI President David Bryant.

<B>Slowly but steadily, white and black Christians in Jackson, Miss., are getting to know each
other, said Jarvis Ward, executive director of Mission Mississippi (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/010995.html">NIRR 1/9</A>)</B>. In its three
years of operation, the group has helped members of 100 churches, many of whom had no
contact with other races, meet for events promoting racial and denominational harmony, he
said. 
<BR><B>...Building interracial friendships takes time, effort, and commitment, Ward told NIRR</B>.
Early-morning interracial prayer meetings conducted on Thursdays in Jackson churches
involve a long drive to an unfamiliar neighborhood for some people, but are drawing up to
150 participants, he said. Other events include pulpit-swaps, picnics, pastors' luncheons,
interracial dinners for couples at local restaurants, a Christmas party, a National Day of
Prayer service, an annual mayor's prayer breakfast, and the March For Jesus. An annual
two-day rally in the Mississippi Coliseum drew 13,000 people Oct. 18-19 to hear speakers
E.V. Hill and local pastor Frank Pollard, who shared insights from their long interracial
friendship. Former gang leader Joseph Jennings addressed the youth, and singer Kathy
Troccoli and the Mississippi Mass Choir performed. 
<BR><B>...Mississippi may seem like the least likely state for reconciliation to occur, Ward said</B>. Yet,
if racial violence breaks out in the United States, Jackson "probably would be the safest part
of the country" because Christians of various races are developing relationships with each
other, he said. In response to inquiries, Mission Mississippi plans to expand to other areas of
the country in the next few years. For information, call (601) 353-6477. NIRR 11/13/95

New Orleans Seminary classes. "When you have inmates taking seminary extension courses,

<B>Missionaries visiting Vietnam brought back first-hand accounts of the conversion of the
Hmong tribal people in the mountains (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/071095.html">NIRR 7/10</A>)</B>. More than 300,000 Hmong have become
Christians through Far East Broadcasting Company programs and the work of Hmong
evangelists, FEBC reported. 
<BR><B>...Two Laotian Christian & Missionary Alliance missionaries videotaped their visit to several
Hmong villages earlier this year</B>. The video shows multi-village worship services, a meeting
with hundreds of men and women weeping and praying for their loved ones to accept Christ,
a village chief's testimony of his conversion, and descriptions of government persecution of
the Hmong Christian leaders. 
<BR><B>...The conversion of the Hmong in Vietnam first came to light in 1991, when a Hanoi
newspaper reported that great numbers of them were abandoning traditional spirit worship and
accepting Christ</B>. The article blamed radio broadcasts from Manila, where FEBC has a
transmitter. Hmong villages stretch through the mountains of Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, China,
and Myanmar. About 560,000 Hmong live in Vietnam. NIRR 11/13/95

<B>Most French-speaking evangelicals in Quebec oppose the province's sovereignty despite the
fact that 58% of Francophone Quebecers voted for it in the Oct</B>. 30 referendum. In a survey
conducted prior to the vote, 68% of French evangelicals said they would vote "no," Glenn
Smith of Christian Direction, a parachurch ministry, told NIRR. Since most Protestant and
Catholic Christians opposed separation from Canada, the survey shows that "next to language,
the most indicative criteria of a `no' vote was church attendance," Smith said. Other results of
the survey, published in the newspaper Christian Week, showed that only 37% of
Francophones feel their faith affects their political opinions. Some 103 people were surveyed
for the study, conducted by Christian Direction.  
<BR><B>..."The operative word for the church is reconciliation," Smith said</B>. "It's time to take the
social implications of the gospel seriously and tell the country: `When we're reconciled with
God, we'll be reconciled to one another.'" NIRR 11/13/95

<B>A new shelter for homeless "ragpickers" -- teen-age boys who scour garbage dumps for
scraps of metal, plastic, or paper to sell -- is run by Youth for Christ International in Madras,
India</B>. Some ragpickers have families, but most have left home or been thrown out and have
come to the city to make money. But jobs are scarce and ragpicking pays at best $1 a day,
Art Deyo, YFC's International Liaison Director for the Asia-Pacific Area, told NIRR. Because
the boys work in dumps, many are filthy and sickly, he said. 
<BR><B>...YFC personnel have worked among the thousands of ragpickers for years but have been
unable to build relationships because "you never know when you'll see them again," Deyo
said</B>. The shelter gives workers an opportunity to gain the boys' trust and teach them about
Christ while providing food and job training, Deyo said. During their six-month stay, the boys
are taught marketable skills such as silk-screening, leather working, and hand crafts. The
home is part of the Englewood, Colo.-based ministry's emphasis on the poor. NIRR 11/13/95

<B>Ethiopia, the world's poorest country, has the fastest-growing church in Africa, Howard Foltz
of the Association for International Mission Services said</B>. Even the country's high jobless
rate facilitates the spread of the gospel because "people just go to work for the church" as
evangelists, he said. When Foltz and a team from Virginia Beach-based AIMS visited the
country to help the Ethiopian Evangelical Fellowship of Churches train 286 indigenous
evangelists, they found that the EEFC's 10 denominations are unified and committed to
evangelism, he said. 
<BR><B>..."They were so hungry to receive the teaching and ready to go anywhere," Nate Crandall, a
Regent University student who went on the trip, told NIRR</B>. "They were weeping and crying
to God" for their countrymen. 
<BR><B>...The AIMS outreach resulted from Denver pastor Charles Blair's visits to the country over
the past 15 months</B>. Blair, whose congregation includes many Ethiopian immigrants, has
visited the country several times to provide theological training. On his most recent trip, 220
people promised to disciple 10,000 Ethiopian leaders in two years. It shows the "ripple effect"
of the gospel, he said. NIRR 11/13/95

<B>The Southern Baptist Foreign Mission Board is intensifying its efforts in the former Soviet
bloc by adding $10 million of its 1995 budget to the White Harvest '95 campaign</B>. Citing the
"tremendous opportunity" in the countries, FMB Europe director John Floyd said more
resources are needed, Southern Baptist Press reported. A recent medical mission to Russia
registered 828 conversions in a two-week period, but 300-400 more people could have been
reached if more translators had been available, Floyd said. 
<BR><B>..."It's time for us to depart from our traditional way of doing missions and accelerate the
action," FMB President Jerry Rankin said</B>. The White Harvest money, to be raised as part of
the annual Lottie Moon Christmas Offering, will provide cars and houses for new
missionaries, as well as fund evangelism, new churches, Christian literature, and education.

<B>The United Methodist Church is walking a fine theological line concerning the proper
relationship between Christians and Jews, news reports said</B>. In a proposed statement, the
denomination affirms a Christian obligation to witness to Jews while also asserting that God's
"eternal covenant" with the Jewish people continues today. "While church tradition has taught
that Judaism has been superseded by Christianity as the `new Israel,' we do not believe that
earlier covenant relationships have been invalidated," the proposed statement says. 
<BR><B>...The UMC statement blames "uncritical use of anti-Jewish New Testament writings" for
forming "the basis of modern anti-Semitism</B>." The church "carries grave responsibility" to
counter the evils inflicted in the name of Christ against Jews, such as the Crusades, the
Inquisition, and the pogroms of Eastern Europe, the statement says. In the 20th century, there
is "particular shame" because most churches failed to challenge the governments responsible
for the Holocaust, it said. The statement will be considered at the General Conference in
April. NIRR 11/13/95

belonging to Ellen Cooke (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/051595.html">NIRR 5/15</A>)</B>. The former treasurer resigned in January after being
accused of embezzling $2.2 million. The church already had been given the title to a house in
Montclair, N.J., and a farm in Lancaster, Va., owned by Cooke and her husband. The New
Jersey house sold for $675,000, netting the church $280,000, and the Virginia farm is on the

<BR><B>...The two properties are the only assets Cooke has turned over voluntarily, the denomination
said</B>. It has filed a civil suit in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to
recover all the missing funds. "Mrs. Cooke has resisted all further efforts by the church to
secure additional restitution," the suit said. A grand jury in Newark, N.J., is hearing evidence
presented by the U.S. Attorney's office. The church announced that Stephen Duggan, a retired
certified public accountant, has been named treasurer of the church. NIRR 11/13/95

<B>An effort to teach the Bible as history and literature in public schools is growing nationwide
as the result of a campaign started by a North Carolina woman</B>. Public school districts in
North Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, and California are teaching a
course about the Bible because of the efforts of the nonprofit National Council on Bible
Curriculum in Public Schools. The group, founded 2  years ago by Greensboro resident
Elizabeth Ridenour, promotes the courses through direct mailings, informational meetings and
workshops, and appearances on Christian radio and television talk shows. 
<BR><B>...The curriculum, employed for 40 years in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg, N.C., School System,
covers the books of the Law and the life of Jesus</B>. According to the council's guidelines, the
Bible is to be taught only as an academic subject and not as devotional material. That
approach is constitutional according to U.S. Supreme Court guidelines set down in Abington
v. Schempp and other cases. The council advises teachers "to teach strictly according to
curriculum" and not to add personal or denominational viewpoints, Ridenour told NIRR.
Teachers are to be certified Bible instructors or certified teachers with a strong background in
the Bible. Each course should be monitored through intermittent classroom visits by school
board members and others, she said. 
<BR><B>...The movement has its critics</B>. "We don't object to teaching about religion," said Joseph
Conn of Americans United For Separation of Church and State. But Ridenour's group clearly
is advocating an evangelical agenda, he told NIRR. Its objective is "to smuggle religious
indoctrination into the public schools under the guise of objective study about religion," he
said. Ridenour denied the charge.

<B>For the first time since Roe v</B>. Wade, the U.S. House of Representatives has voted to ban a
specific abortion procedure. The lawmakers voted to outlaw partial-birth abortions unless they
are necessary to save the mother's life. In the procedure, doctors partially deliver a living
fetus before suctioning out its brain (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/072495.html">NIRR 7/24</A>). Abortion-rights supporters tried to halt the
bill by claiming the procedure is sometimes necessary to protect the mother's health. But
"there is no justification for this type of abortion, and [pro-life groups] proved that," Cathy
Deeds of the Family Research Council, told NIRR. FRC opposes all abortions except to save
the mother's life. 
<BR><B>...The House voted 288-139 to pass the bill on Nov</B>. 1. Several lawmakers who favor legal
abortion "experienced an authentic moral revulsion" after reading the eyewitness accounts of
nurse Brenda Shafer, said Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee.
Abortion-rights groups argued that the procedure is performed only in extreme cases, but
abortionists testified they commonly use the procedure after the 20th week of gestation. The
FRC, NRLC, Traditional Values Coalition, and Christian Coalition "were very effective in
educating people about the procedure," Deeds said. Despite a motion by Patricia Schroeder

he was troubled by the administration's "zigzag, flip-flop nature."  
<BR><B>...House conservatives advocate a bill that asserts parents' primary rights over the education,

Christian Coalition and The Family Research Council, is aimed at limiting what they consider
government intrusions, such as condom distribution and sexually explicit teaching in public
schools, teacher certification of home-school parents, and laws concerning corporal
punishment. Recent court decisions limiting the rights of parents amount to "an assault" on
them, said the bill's Senate sponsor, Charles Grassley (R-Iowa).

general deterioration of morality," said Dave Dolan, a Christian freelance journalist in
Jerusalem. "They were distressed, but felt they have an answer for the problem. The challenge
is to get out there and share their beliefs." 
<BR><B>...Most Christians in Israel did not participate in the heated debates surrounding the peace
process, sources said</B>. "The church here is composed of Jews, Arabs, and expatriates, and
these issues are very polarizing, so most of that stuff has to stay out of the pulpit," Dolan
said. While most Messianic Jews believe the government should not have compromised with
the Palestinians, no one condones Rabin's assassination, said Salim Munayer, a Messianic Jew
and director of Musalaha (NIRR 10/4/93), a ministry of reconciliation between Palestinians
and Jews who believe in Christ. Like all of Israeli society, the Messianic Jewish community
has been divided on the peace issue. "People let their end-time theology affect their politics,"
Thomas said. But there are many who say reconciliation and unity with Palestinian Christians
supersedes covenantal promises of the Old Testament regarding the land, he added. 
<BR><B>...Rabin was killed by an Orthodox Jew who was following an extreme interpretation of the
Halakala, a body of religious and social law based on the Talmud and interpreted by
Orthodox rabbis</B>. Although all Orthodox follow the Halakala, few believe it justifies killing in
the name of God, Dolan said. Orthodox Jewish groups wield a great deal of power in the
government, said Tom Hocutt, a Southern Baptist administrator in Ra'anana. With more than
20 political parties, the Israeli government consists of a coalition, some of which are
Orthodox political parties. "That's the reason buses and airplanes don't operate on Saturday
and theaters are closed," he said.   
<BR><B>..."I respected him greatly, but I also loved him like a friend," evangelist Billy Graham said</B>.
Rabin met with Graham several times while he served as Israel's ambassador to the United
States. Saying he, too, considered Rabin a friend, the Christian Broadcasting Network's Pat
Robertson called on Christians to pray for Israel. Jim Henry of the Southern Baptist
Convention, Henry Lyons of the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., Joan Brown Campbell
of the National Council of Churches, and Robert Schuller of the Crystal Cathedral were
among the American religious leaders who attended Rabin's funeral in Jerusalem.

<B>Dale Keel's congregation is a blur to him</B>. The 48-year-old Southern Baptist preacher suffers
from a degenerative eye disease that left him legally blind at age 15. But since 1984, he has
served as pastor of Prosperity Baptist Church, a small congregation in remote Rocky Comfort,
Mo. 
<BR><B>...Despite limited vision, Keel performs weddings, funerals, baptisms, and other typical
ministerial functions</B>. Using magnifying glasses, Keel can read large print held close to his
face. A device that enlarges print on a computer-like screen allows him to study religious
materials. For sermons, he writes notes in large letters on index cards. But Keel rarely uses
them, preferring to memorize as much as he can. He can't make out faces, but recognizes
many of his parishioners by their voices.  
<BR><B>...Much of his ministry is done over the phone</B>. With his wife, Judy, behind the wheel of their
car, the Keels logged more than 20,000 miles last year calling on church members in
hospitals. "Nobody knows how difficult it is for him," Mrs. Keel said. But Keel's efforts have
been rewarded. The 622,000-member Missouri Baptist Convention named him its
small-church pastor of the year, news reports said. NIRR 11/13/95

<B>Unscrupulous lawyers are out to make money from vulnerable churches, an attorney warned
seminarians Oct</B>. 19. Unwary ministers can be bankrupted by lawsuits, Mobile, Ala., attorney
Vaughan Drinkard told students at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest,
N.C., according to Baptist Press.  
<BR><B>...Counseling sessions should be held in glassed-in rooms where participants can be seen but
not heard, said Drinkard, a deacon at Dauphin Way Baptist Church</B>. Also, ministers should
not counsel others alone and should avoid using terms of endearment, he said. Ministers
should not fear lawsuits for offending people by preaching the Word of God, Drinkard said.
"If you're in the pulpit and you're preaching the Bible, you're constitutionally protected."

<B>Billy Graham has announced plans for the future of his ministry</B>. The Billy Graham
Evangelistic Association's board of directors elected his son Franklin to serve as first vice
chairman. That is a new position with direct succession to become chairman and CEO of the
BGEA should the evangelist become incapacitated. "The action settled within the organization
the question of succession," the BGEA said. Franklin Graham will continue his ministry with
Samaritan's Purse and World Medical Mission and also conduct crusades for the BGEA.

<B>The head of the nation's 1.5 million orthodox African-American Muslims said minister Louis

Mohammed, son of Nation of Islam founder Elijah Muhammad, said Farrakhan's focus on
past wrongs suffered by blacks may prevent them from progressing. Farrakhan "wants people
to believe that God talks to him. If God is talking to him, I don't like what He is saying,"
said Mohammed, who is a Sunni Muslim.

Fuller Institute's Canadian Ministries will double its activities this year. The institute has
planned 10 seminars on church growth and evangelism this year, director John Baergen said.
It also helps pastors network and expand their ministries, and has created a resource catalog
for church leaders.
<P>
<B>Canada: Billy Graham and his son Franklin shared the pulpit for the first time ever at a
four-day crusade in Saskatoon, Sask</B>. The Franklin Graham crusade brought 55,000 people to
SaskaPlace, a hockey stadium, and thousands more watched the crusade by satellite at venues
in Regina, Moose Jaw, Yorkton, Prince Albert, and Marwayne, Alberta. Some 200 churches
organized and participated in the crusade, during which several thousand people committed
their lives to Christ. Billy Graham, who turned 77 Nov. 7, preached the crusade's final night.

<B>Abortion protesters are the defendants in several recent court challenges</B>.
<BR><B>...A federal jury in Dallas ordered antiabortion groups Operation Rescue, Missionaries to the
Pre-Born, and the Dallas Pro-Life Action Network and their leaders to pay $8.6 million to
abortion doctor Norman Tompkins</B>. He had been stalked and harassed by abortion opponents
since 1992. Tompkins eventually closed his practice and moved out of town. 
<BR><B>...Planned Parenthood filed a $200 million class-action suit against two groups whose leaders
contend that killing abortionists is justifiable: American Coalition for Life Activists located in
Virginia, and Advocates for Life Ministries, based in Portland, Ore., according to news
reports</B>. "Unborn people deserve the same protections you and I deserve," according to Kathy
Ramey of ALF.  Courts upheld enforcement of Buffalo, N.Y., and Phoenix, Ariz., "bubble
zones" -- areas near clinics within which protests are limited. 
<BR><B>...."We are winning the battle in the streets," Operation Rescue leader Flip Benham said in an
interview with USA Today</B>. "So they are taking us to the only place in this land where they
can win -- the courtroom."

<B>Five evangelical relief agencies are working together for the first time in a domestic disaster:
Hurricane Opal, which hit the Gulf Coast in October</B>. They are Food for the Hungry in
Scottsdale, Ariz.; Operation Blessing in Virginia Beach, Va.; International Aid in Spring

dioceses, according to Religion News Service. 
<P>
<B>Sixty-six percent of American adults believe in Satan, and one-third say he has tempted them,
a Newsweek poll found</B>. Among evangelical Protestants, 85% say they believe in the devil;
59% blame him for crime, and 43% blame him for the homosexual-rights movement.
<P>
<B>What is important to Generation X? Twenty-two percent of Americans age 18-24 cite lack of
family structure and guidance as the nation's top problems, according to a poll by Ross
Goldstein of Generation Insights, which tracks trends</B>. These concerns take precedence over
AIDS and illiteracy (15% each), violence (14%), and drugs (9%). "The collapse of many of
our social institutions, like the family, has left its mark," Goldstein said.
<P>
<B>The publishing arm of Ted Turner's empire has produced a costly new edition of the Bible</B>.
The Holy Bible With Illustrations From The Vatican Library sells in bookstores for $395. The
1,312-page oversize book is printed in Italy using gold leaf and six colors. It draws from 30
illuminated Vatican Library manuscripts that rarely are seen. The new Bible allows laypeople
access to some of the library's treasures, according to Michael Reagan of Turner Publishing.
"You can't get a Vatican library card," he said.

<B>Fire destroyed historic St</B>. Paulus Lutheran church in San Francisco Nov. 5. The church once
had a congregation of 2,000, but now numbers 150. It feeds 55,000 people each year and runs
a shelter next door for homeless women. About 30 members stood in a circle, held hands, and
sang Amazing Grace over the noise of fire trucks, news reports said. The cause of the fire
was unknown.

<B>Donations to the 400 largest nonprofit organizations rose to $22.4 billion in 1994, up 6.3%
from a year earlier, according to a survey by The Chronicle of Philanthropy</B>. For the third
year, The Salvation Army received more donations than any other charity, $726 million, up
from $683 million a year earlier. The American Red Cross was in second place with $497
million; third was Second Harvest, a national network of food banks, with $425 million.
Others in the top 10: United Jewish Appeal, $382 million; YMCA of the USA, $376 million;
and Catholic Charities USA, $336 million.

<B>Kenya: A joint effort by MAP International and the Medical University of South Africa will
enable African physicians to receive specialty training in their own countries</B>. African doctors
usually have to travel to other countries for advanced education, and the training they receive
has little relevance to medical problems found in their home countries, MAP said. Under the
new program, doctors can learn through electronic communications, on-site visits by traveling
physicians, and new local resource centers. MAP is coordinating the network of hospitals that
will take part in the program.

more came to Christ in an afternoon service. At the evening service so many people came
that it was moved outside, according to DAWN. Among all 43 churches, 2,000 became
Christians on that Sunday.

<B>Indonesia: The unreached Komering people of Sumatra are starting to receive the gospel,
Indonesian Harvest Outreach said</B>. In September, a village chief claimed his paralyzed leg was
healed after IHO young people prayed for him, the Claremont, Calif.-based ministry said.
Soon other people asked for prayer and many became Christians. The gospel is spreading so
rapidly that the Komerings have asked that the ministry send more pastors, an IHO
representative said. 
<P>
<B>Indonesia: A Mission Aviation Fellowship pilot flew a pastor and two translators to make the
first Christian contact with the nomadic Tookeeni people</B>. The tribal chief and nine others
greeted the missionaries with handshakes and hugs but seemed reserved, MAF said. Churches
tried to reach the people for four years, but internal tribal disputes prevented contact. The
group plans to visit the tribe until it is ready to accept evangelists.

July 1.

<B>England: Despite a decision by the London High Court, Interior Minister Michael Howard
banned Unification Church leader Sun Myung Moon from entering the country from his home
in South Korea</B>. The court said Howard had no right to keep Moon out without a hearing. But
Howard ignored the ruling, saying that Moon's teachings tend to alienate young people from
their families, causing "very great misery," according to news reports. Moon canceled a trip to
England in 1981 under similar circumstances. The Unification Church has 700 members in
the country, news reports said.

<B>England: The Salvation Army has recovered $13.7 million in restitution, interest, and legal
fees from those who swindled $8.8 million from the charity two years ago</B>. Although no
criminal charges have been filed against the three men who were involved in the
"sophisticated commercial fraud," the Army won "substantial money judgments against them,"
news reports said. One Salvation Army official was fired for bad judgment when the fraud
was discovered.
<P>
<B>England: The Church of England and the Methodist Church have sold their shares in British
Satellite Broadcasting because it will soon carry the Playboy Channel</B>. Pornography degrades
and exploits human beings, a church spokesman said. According to news reports, Christie
Hefner of Playboy Enterprises said she was puzzled over the decision because the channel
"encourages relationships to last between couples." 
<P>
<B>England: Forward in Faith (NIRR 3/7/94), a group of 5,000 Church of England members who
resist its 1992 decision to ordain women, held its second annual conference this month</B>. The
"church within the church" commissioned 14 regional deans to provide pastoral care and
oversight for those opposed to ordaining women as priests. The group also plans to establish a
seminary to ensure a supply of what it calls "orthodox" ministers.

Teun Stortenbeker heard Cruz's message about drug addiction and the need for Christians to
help abusers. Stortenbeker later began De Hoop (The Hope) in Dordrecht. The center has 70

<B>Russia: An amendment to the religious freedom law has been proposed (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/062695.html">NIRR 6/26</A>)</B>. Foreign
missions groups would still have to obtain government registration, but the requirements
would be less restrictive, news reports said. The organizations could hold religious activities
as long as they presented a notarized charter from their home country, a statement of doctrine,
and their intentions in Russia.

<P>
<B>The Million Man March will help black churches in the United States, their leaders say</B>.
African-American Christian leaders stressed their theological differences with Nation of Islam
minister Louis Farrakhan. But they acknowledged that the march produced "positive energy"
that black churches can channel in constructive ways, said W. Franklyn Richardson, director
of the historically black National Baptist Convention, U.S.A. Farrakhan "belongs to our
community," he told Religion News Service. 
<BR><B>...Farrakhan spoke of moral and spiritual renewal</B>. Leading the Oct. 16 march in Washington,
D.C., he urged the hundreds of thousands of men to accept "the responsibility that God has
put upon us...to be good husbands and fathers and builders of our community." Farrakhan led
the men as they pledged to "love my brother as myself" and vowed to make a new start
spiritually, morally, mentally, socially, politically, and economically. 
<BR><B>...The Nation of Islam leader urged the men to come to God</B>. "Every one of you must go back
home and join some church, synagogue, temple, or mosque that is teaching spiritual and
moral uplift," Farrakhan said during his 2 -hour lecture. "I want you, brothers. There are no
men in the church, in the mosque," he said. "The men are in the streets and we've got to get
back to the houses of God." Although he called the march a holy day of atonement, most
marchers did not regard their participation as a religious statement, reports said.  
<BR><B>...The need for men to take responsibility is a theme heard from diverse sources recently</B>. The
message has been sounded by Promise Keepers speakers, Pope John Paul II, President Bill
Clinton, and religious broadcaster Pat Robertson, among others. There is a national consensus
that society must return to family values, said Jean Bethke Elshtain, professor of social and
political ethics at the University of Chicago. "From lots of different places on the political
spectrum and lots of positions doctrinally" there is "a tremendous convergence on themes
about love, care, responsibility, being responsible for your children, staying married, and
husbands being kind and decent to your wife," he told RNS. 
<BR><B>...Farrakhan said his outlook is the same as other religious leaders</B>. "We have that same frame
of reference: the Bible, Old and New Testaments and Koran," he said. "If there are
similarities in our speaking, it's because we're coming from the same frame of reference."
Speaking on The 700 Club television show, Robertson called Farrakhan "a demagogue," "a
monger of hate," an "anti-Semite" and a "racist," but acknowledged that the minister "is
embracing initiatives that we all applaud." 
<BR><B>...But Farrakhan's theology isolates him</B>. Three core tenets have set the Nation of Islam apart
from mainstream Islam. The Nation of Islam teaches that W.D. Fard, the founder of the sect,
was God incarnate, whereas mainstream Islam rejects the idea that God has ever taken human
form. Elijah Muhammad, who took over for Fard and led the Nation of Islam until 1975,
called himself a prophet and messenger of God. But mainstream Islam teaches that the
Prophet Muhammad, the seventh-century founder of the faith, was the last in the line of
God's prophets that began with Adam. Also, the Nation of Islam teaches that white people
were created some 6,650 years ago by a black scientist in rebellion against Allah. This belief
is the "fundamental premise upon which [the Nation of Islam] rests the whole theory of black
supremacy and white degradation," according to C. Eric Lincoln, retired Duke University
religion professor and author of The Black Muslims in America. Mainstream American
Muslims generally claim that Farrakhan and his followers are not Muslims. NIRR 10/30/95

<B>Nine thousand student athletes pledged to live free from drugs and alcohol and to hold each

Play -- Drug Free!, a Fellowship of Christian Athletes movement. The athletes, who are
junior-high through college age, signed the pledge cards during FCA summer camps, school
assemblies, and group meetings. Some 13,048 athletes, coaches, and their families attended
more than 100 FCA camps last summer, the group said. Camps, churches, athletic teams, and
schools also are offering the program. 
<BR><B>...The movement involves more than just saying "no," FCA said</B>. It is meant to instill values,
encourage goal-setting, stress individual responsibility, and establish accountability through
"positive peer pressure." The book One Way 2 Play! (Zondervan) includes comments from
athletes and coaches, ideas for group meetings, anti-drug commitment sheets, a toll-free

<B>Willow Creek Community Church, North America's largest congregation, went all out to
celebrate its 20th birthday Oct</B>. 14. Members and friends packed the 20,000-seat United
Center in Chicago -- normally used for Chicago Bulls and Blackhawks games and rock
concerts -- for a high-energy evening of contemporary music and drama. A sound system
bigger than Elton John's and a laser light show enhanced the two-hour celebration. President
Clinton, with whom senior pastor Bill Hybels has a pastoral visit once a month, sent a video
congratulating the church. 
<BR><B>...Started with 125 people in a suburban Chicago movie theater, the independent,
interdenominational, evangelical church now has a $34.3 million campus on 141 acres in
South Barrington, Ill</B>. Attendance tops 15,000 at three weekend services, and 5,000 attend two
midweek services. This year's budget totals $15 million. More than 95 outreaches help
members and the community in a variety of spiritual and physical areas. The Willow Creek
Association, a group of churches with similar philosophies, has 1,074 member churches in 60
denominations in 19 countries. More than 30,000 church leaders have attended Willow Creek
conferences. 
<BR><B>...Willow Creek's services include contemporary music, a short play, and a message on a
topic drawn from day-to-day life, such as friendship or finances</B>. Some services are designed
to reach and teach those who have lost interest in religion or never had it. Other services help
believers grow to maturity. Willow Creek officials call their weekend services Christianity
101 and 102, and midweek services are Christianity 301 and 401. NIRR 10/30/95

<B>A Christian couple provides a temporary home for families and friends visiting inmates at the
Texas state prison in Huntsville</B>. In nine years, 47,005 visitors from 45 states and 35 countries
have stayed at the 48-bed Hospitality House, according to Bob Norris, who founded and
directs the ministry. 
<BR><B>...Inmates' families often are angry and suffering emotional pain, said Norris, a Southern
Baptist minister</B>. About a third of the families are "from the criminal subculture" themselves
or not far removed from it, he said. Hospitality House has hosted the families of 43 of the
100 inmates executed at Huntsville since Texas reinstated the death penalty in 1982. 
<BR><B>...Family members often want to talk, and Norris and his wife, Nelda, do a lot of listening</B>.
Over the years, 425 people have made professions of faith in Christ, Norris said. The work is
emotionally draining, "but God gives compassion for the people." Other visitors just want
privacy and a safe haven from television cameras and pro- or anti-capital punishment
picketers. 
<BR><B>...Some 10-15 foreign visitors stay at the house each week</B>. They have corresponded with
death-row inmates through organizations such as Amnesty International and Life-lines, an
English group, and have come to encourage the inmates, Norris said. The foreign visitors
usually are cold to religion. "They have a lot of compassion, but not religion." Regrettably, it
often is the case that, when it comes to inmates, "Christians have a lot of religion, but not
much compassion," he said. NIRR 10/30/95

<B>The Jesus film is drawing viewers in some of New York City's toughest neighborhoods</B>. This
summer, Campus Crusade workers set up loudspeakers and two-way screens on sidewalks and
fire escapes in the densely populated neighborhoods of Washington Heights, East Harlem, the
Bronx, Queens, and Lower Manhattan. Crowds averaging 100-200 watched 20 showings,
according to Campus Crusade worker Bart Trowbridge. Some viewers came forward at the
end of the film to meet with volunteers from local churches.  
<BR><B>...Campus Crusade's Julie Wenzell said she has grown accustomed to the potential dangers of
showing the film, and constantly experiences God's protection</B>. In the summer of 1994, the
film was scheduled to be shown on the same street corner where police killed a Dominican
drug dealer, an act that brought charges of police brutality from the community. As the
Campus Crusade team began to set up equipment, police arrived and urged them, especially
the Caucasians, to leave the area. Instead, the film was shown and "there were many, many
people that came to Christ that night," Wenzell said. NIRR 10/30/95

<B>Nearly 2,000 people a night came forward to make commitments to Christ during Billy
Graham's five-day crusade in Sacramento, Calif., Oct</B>. 18-22. Crowds averaged 29,600 a night
at the 17,000-seat Arco Arena and three outdoor venues, which were connected electronically.
It was the first crusade in the United States this year for Graham, who still is feeling the
effects of a broken vertebra after a fall in July (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/101695.html">NIRR 10/16</A>).  
<BR><B>...Aimed to reach a bored and increasingly distracted society, the crusade was the most
technically complex program ever produced for a Graham campaign</B>. Fifteen television
cameras broadcast events on four stages inside and outside the arena. The programs used
interactive video and audio and giant screens. Translations into Cantonese, Hmong, Japanese,
Mandrin, Russian, Spanish, Urdu, and Vietnamese were meant to accommodate Sacramento's
large ethnic populations.  
<BR><B>...Racial reconciliation was one of Graham's themes</B>. Social injustice is "within the human
heart and the human heart has to be changed," he said. "We don't have the ability to love
each other as we should. But Jesus could change all that if we open our hearts to Him."

<B>"God is shaking the world" with the gospel, Association of International Mission Services
president Howard Foltz told some 300 pastors, missionaries, and evangelists at Regent
University's Ninth Annual Missions Conference Oct</B>. 19-21. Participants from 40
organizations attended plenary sessions and workshops covering China, Islam, the 10/40
Window, global evangelization, personal revival, African-American ministries, and health-care
agencies. General session speakers included Foltz, international evangelist Bob Weiner, and
missions leader David Shibley of Dallas-based Global Advance. AIMS and the Christian
Broadcasting Network co-hosted the event. 
<BR><B>...South Korean pastor David Yonggi Cho called the leaders to be people of prayer, vision,
and faith</B>. "Prayer is the foundation of revival," said Cho, who prays three hours a day. Cho,
who pastors Yoido Full Gospel Church in Seoul, the largest church in the world, with
700,000 members, said prayer is a struggle for him. "If I could build a church without prayer,
I would dance and shout." But after the first hour of prayer, "you overcome Satan and get
into the spiritual realm where you pray in union with the Holy Spirit." NIRR 10/30/95

<B>Latin America is sending Protestant missionaries to Muslim countries, Lee Edward Roy of
Bradenton, Fla.-based Missionary Action, a missions support agency, told NIRR</B>. Roy said he
knows of 15 missionaries from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, Chile, Argentina,
Brazil, and Nicaragua working among Muslims in Asia and northwest Africa. One group has
made 12 converts among the Muslim Soninke tribe of Senegal and Mali. "It creates the first
beachhead," Roy said. 
<BR><B>...Latin Americans are specially equipped to minister in Arabic countries, Roy said</B>. Moors
ruled for 750 years in Spain, where most present-day Latin Americans trace their ancestry, he
said. Many Latin Americans resemble North African Arabs in appearance. The two cultures
share common emphases on hospitality, extended families, and strictly defined gender roles.
Arabs are more likely to accept Latin Americans because of their Third World status and are
"not associated with the wealth and power of the United States," Roy said. NIRR 10/30/95

<B>As millions of Christians prayed for spiritual breakthroughs in Muslim countries this month
(<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/101695.html">NIRR 10/16</A>), thousands of believers traveled to key Muslim cities to pray on-site</B>. Colorado
Springs pastor Ted Haggard led prayer walks in Egypt, an undisclosed Muslim nation, and
Israel. The six-member group prayed quietly in mosques, asking God to reveal Himself to
Muslims. Christians in the Muslim nations had Praying Through the Window II prayer
calendars hanging secretly on walls everywhere the group went, Haggard said.  
<BR><B>...A group of 55 prayer walkers visited several cities and holy sites in Turkey</B>. Led by Marie
Umidi of the Association of International Mission Services, the group gave three multimedia
presentations on the life of Jesus. Some 1,000 people attended the events, held in churches
because police would not allow them in public. At one prayer site, the group was approached
by schoolchildren wanting to practice speaking English. "They reached out to touch us and I
would shake their hands and pray for them as I held it," participant Jean Bohnhoff told NIRR.
Other members witnessed to their bus drivers, and one accepted Christ. "He was so
transformed" after his conversion, Umidi said. NIRR 10/30/95

<B>Churches in the West African nation of Sierra Leone are attempting to meet the needs of
thousands of refugees left homeless and hungry by its civil war</B>. Because villages have been
devastated and husbands and fathers forcibly conscripted into the rebel army, women and
children must live in camps, where the churches distribute food and medicine. In the north,
"people have resorted to eating tree bark," said David Loudon of World Relief Disaster
Response, one of the groups helping refugees there. Cut off from humanitarian aid, the
refugees survive only because of churches in the area, Loudon said. Some 1,000 people from
the southern towns of Bo and Bonthe also are being helped. 
<BR><B>...Three thousand refugees fled from rural areas to the capital, Freetown, earlier this year</B>. The

He said the agency refuses to fund religious business because they "further the establishment

<B>The Senate held hearings on a proposed Religious Equality Amendment this month</B>. Backed
by a variety of religious groups, the amendment seeks to guarantee the right of religious
expression in public places. Equal treatment by the government "is often only a promise, not
a reality" for religious people, Steven McFarland of the Christian Legal Society's Center for
Law and Justice told the Senate Judiciary Committee. Supporters cited Supreme Court rulings
that restricted students' rights to pray and hold religious activities at school. But religious
speech is "fully protected by current law" and an amendment will cause unnecessary trouble,
Douglas Laycock of the University of Texas Law School told the senators.  
<BR><B>...The proposed amendment specifies that neither the federal nor state governments may
discriminate against persons "acting in a private capacity" on account of their religious
expressions, belief, or identity</B>. Furthermore, the exercise of such beliefs "shall not be
construed as an establishment of religion," it says. Opponents argued that the First
Amendment already guarantees freedom of religion, but Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch
(R-Utah), a Mormon, noted the potential for persecution of religious people. "I am concerned
that government not drive religion out of the public square and from our public dialogue."

<B>Jake "The Snake" Roberts -- all 6-foot-5 and 270 pounds of him -- has become an evangelist</B>.
As a professional wrestler, Roberts was notorious for his cruelty to opponents, his $500,000 a
year salary, and an enormous python he brandished around his neck. But Roberts' nastiness
wasn't just an act. Outside the ring his heart was full of hatred and his life was spinning out
of control because of deadly addictions, he told NIRR. After Roberts became a Christian four
years ago, he walked away from the ring at the top of his profession. He now travels around
the country relating the story of his salvation to young people at schools, churches, and
prisons. 
<BR><B>...Roberts has wrestled with the effects of sin most of his life</B>. His childhood was "one horror
scene after another," he said. Born to a 13-year-old mother, Roberts' parents divorced and he
was raised by his grandmother until she died of cancer. Roberts and his sister were reclaimed
by their father and stepmother, who abused them mentally and sexually. His sister became
pregnant at 13, had two more children by the time she was 17, married, and was kidnapped
and murdered by her husband's ex-wife. In an attempt to impress his emotionally distant
father, Roberts began to wrestle at age 19. When he lost his first match, his father said, "I'm
ashamed of you. You're gutless and you'll never amount to anything." 
<BR><B>...Full of hatred, Roberts made a literal pact with the devil</B>. He prayed to Satan, telling him
that if he could get him to the top, he would do anything Satan wanted. "I didn't believe in
God, but was sure there was a devil because my life was a living hell," he said. Roberts
became unstoppable in the ring. "People would bust chairs, baseball bats, and beer bottles
over me. What does it mean when you're so detached that you feel nothing?" he asked. But
fame and wealth left Roberts unsatisfied. He tried filling the emptiness with any drugs he
could find -- including amphetamines, marijuana, steroids, and alcohol -- food, and sex. He
was a crack cocaine addict for seven years, spending $3,000 a week on the drug, and tried
suicide four times. He took pills and alcohol before going to bed, and would "get mad when
I'd wake up the next day."  
<BR><B>...In 1991, Roberts attended an Easter play to please his wife, Cheryl</B>. She had hung on
through his failed drug treatments, pulling him toward her own beliefs in Christianity. During
the play, Roberts' chest tightened and he thought he was having a heart attack, he said. After
that, he turned to God and was overwhelmed at finding forgiveness for his many sins and a
way out of his self-destructive lifestyle. 
<BR><B>...Jake and Cheryl Roberts now deliver God's message across the country on a circuit far
from the celebrity status and big money of professional wrestling</B>. Roberts shuns speaking
fees, depending strictly on audience donations and sales of Jake "The Snake" merchandise to
cover expenses. He speaks out in schools and churches against drugs, alcohol, and premarital
sex. In public schools "they won't let me talk about God," but he tells the students to check
the local newspaper to see what church he's speaking at that weekend. 
<BR><B>...Roberts' message hits home, especially with young people who have been through rough
times</B>. "The last thing they need to hear is a guy in a suit and tie say `I never done nothing
wrong,'" Roberts said. After a speech at a high school in Kelowna, B.C., Canada, recently,
students gave him a 10-minute standing ovation and young people followed him out to the
parking lot to hear more. "There's a great thing happening" among youth, he said. "A lot of
kids whose parents are into drugs are saying to themselves `I don't want to wind up like that'
and are taking a different course," Roberts said. "In the '90s, we'll see a lot of parents
converted by their children," he said. "It will be wild." For more information about Roberts,
call Fred Baye (518) 477-2385. NIRR 10/30/95

<B>Former television evangelist Jim Bakker preached at a church this month in Rochester, Minn.,
the city where he was imprisoned after his fraud conviction (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/030695.html">NIRR 3/6</A>)</B>. "I'm back from the

<B>A Texas couple spent their savings to build a 190-foot-tall steel cross near Groom, a town in
the Texas panhandle</B>. Steve Young of Pampa and his wife, Bobby, who are Catholic, spent
$340,000 to have the cross built after Young had a vision of the end of the world. The cross
has a tubular-steel frame 16 inches thick and 19 stories tall with a span of 11 stories. Because
of the flat landscape, the cross is visible for miles, and motorists on Interstate 40 sometimes
stop to pray when they see it.

<B>Geralyn Wolf has become the second woman to head an American Episcopal diocese</B>. She
was chosen on a five-ballot vote in Providence, R.I. Wolf, 48, dean of Christ Cathedral in
Louisville, Ky., was praised as a woman of great spiritual commitment even by delegates who
voted against her. Her election must be approved by a majority of Episcopal standing
committees nationally before she can be installed. That process should take several months,
sources said.

<B>The heresy trial for retired Episcopal Bishop Walter Righter (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/090495.html">NIRR 9/4</A>) has been scheduled
for Jan</B>. 3-5 in Chicago. Righter ordained a non-celibate homosexual in 1990 while serving as
an assistant bishop of the Diocese of Newark, N.J. His trial will deal with the boundaries of
church teaching on homosexuality and how the church handles authority.

<B>Cuba: Four nuns are reviving Catholicism among Cuban refugees at Guantanamo Bay Naval
Base (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/052995.html">NIRR 5/29</A>)</B>. The Church sent them to counsel and teach classes among the 10,000

<B>The Madonna hands a white rose to baby Jesus in this year's Christmas stamp, introduced at
the National Gallery of Art, news reports said</B>. The 32-cent stamp is based on a Renaissance
painting by Giotto di Bondone; the rose symbolizes Mary's purity and Jesus' future sacrifice,
a curator said. The stamp went on sale this month, a year after the post office decided to
discontinue the Madonna and Child series based on famous paintings, concluding they had all
begun to look alike. An angel stamp had been planned as a replacement, but that decision
brought complaints from the public and President Clinton (NIRR 12/12/94).

<B>A rabbi, an imam, ministers, priests, and nuns said they will go to jail to protest a midnight-5
a.m</B>. curfew in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Members of A Religious Witness for
Homeless People said the curfew is inhumane to the homeless. Three months ago, the city
began a crackdown on crime in the park, where many people have been intimidated, beaten,
and robbed, Deputy Police Chief Frank Reed said. "The city may have gained a cleaner park,
but we have lost a little more of our soul," said Bernie Galvin, who heads the protest group.

<B>"Simple and dangerous fixes" to the welfare system could result in more abortions, Catholic
bishops across the country said in a letter to Congress</B>. They told Congress that cutting

<B>Ethnic religious leaders met in Colorado Springs Oct</B>. 2-3 to mobilize their congregations
against pornography. Conference sessions focused on ministry to Native, African, Asian, and
Hispanic Americans. Participants called pornography a breach of the rights of women and the
dignity of all people. Their resolution will be sent to lawmakers, denominations, and faith
groups. Black Family Ministries, an outreach of Focus on the Family, hosted the conference,
which was sponsored by the Ethnic Leadership Committee of the Religious Alliance Against
Pornography. For information on the committee, call (810) 545-7776.

<B>Oct</B>. 11, designated by homosexual activists as Coming Out Day, also was declared Coming
Out of Homosexuality Day by ministries. "Thousands of men and women have successfully
walked away from homosexuality," said Michael Johnston of Kerusso Ministries of
Anchorage, Alaska, one of 30 organizations that sponsored the event. Johnson, a former
homosexual who is infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, sharply criticized groups
that advocate homosexuality. Such groups are "as guilty of child abuse as the child
pornographer" because they twist the minds of young people, he told NIRR. "It's time to hold
them accountable." For more information, call the ministry at (907) 333-4673.

<B>A 24-foot bronze sculpture of Christ standing in a boat and calming the wind and waves was
unveiled Oct</B>. 23 in Corpus Christi, Texas. The statue, located on the waterfront at First
United Methodist Church, is meant to symbolize Christ's calming the storms of daily life.
<P>
<B>The Austin (Texas) Baptist Association expelled University Baptist Church for ordaining a
homosexual as a deacon last year</B>. The church could face further sanctions from the Southern
Baptist Convention. In 1992, the SBC amended its constitution to exclude churches that
approve of homosexuality. The man "is one of the best deacons I have ever seen and one of
the finest people I have ever known," University Baptist pastor Larry Bethune said. In a
letter, the church said it considered the ouster "an interference in the autonomy of our
congregation." Dale Gore of the Austin Baptist Association blamed the break in fellowship on
"the fact that the church had ordained as a spiritual leader a member of the church that was
disobedient to the Scriptures."
<P>
<B>The International Center for Christians and Jews is forming the Center for Judeo-Christian

pastors, including searching police records and financial histories as well as education and
ministerial experience (<A HREF="/nirr/archives/1995/082195.html">NIRR 8/21</A>). "It's sad it's that way, but we can't be too careful," said

the death of a friend, the man dreamed they drove together to a bright city. The day after his
dream, he said, a strange white bird circled above him while he was in the desert; later, he
traveled to Switzerland and saw a picture of the bird in the window of a Christian bookstore.
"It was the Holy Spirit," he said. When he then watched a video about the heavenly
Jerusalem and recognized the city as the one in his dream, he decided to convert.

<B>Lebanon: Some 180 Christians returned to their homes in Maasar Al Shouf after having been
driven out in 1983</B>. Their houses had been occupied by Druze families since the Christians
fled the village, located 20 miles from Beirut, during fighting. More of the thousands of
Christians who fled are expected to return soon, news reports said. In order to show his desire
for peace and reconciliation, President Elias Hrawi pardoned a Christian who killed Druze
citizens after his own family was massacred. Those returning to their homes were given
$7,500 to rebuild, and the departing Druze got $5,000 in compensation. Christian and Druze
leaders committed themselves to living together peacefully.

when it comes. It is only a matter of time before a Muslim convert is discovered, a pastor
said.

<B>Persecuted Third World Christians trying to flee to the United States face apathy and
insensitivity from U.S</B>. State Department and Immigration and Naturalization Service officials,
religious-rights activists say. "Christians are just getting beaten over the head...and no one
seems to care," Keith Roderick of the Coalition for the Defense of Human Rights Under
Islamization told NIRR.  
<BR><B>...In the heavily Islamic Middle East, U.S</B>. policy is meant to pacify fundamentalists, said
Steve Snyder of International Christian Concern. Christians there often hold progressive
beliefs about the rights of individuals and democracy. But rather than help promote these
values, U.S. government officials bow to Islamic leaders in the name of preserving national
stability, critics said. The result is that U.S. authorities look the other way where there is
religious oppression, such as exists in Egypt, Iran, Sudan, and Algeria, whose governments
pursue or allow persecution of Christians. The U.S. government is "conforming to policies of
other countries rather than upholding our own values of the rights of the individual and
religious freedom," Snyder said.  
<BR><B>...U.S</B>. policy also fosters economic cooperation over human rights, critics say. The subject of
religious freedom never came up when the United States re-established relations with Vietnam
this year, and America ignores China's record of brutal religious persecution to foster good
trade relations, said Michael Horowitz of the conservative Hudson Institute. 
<BR><B>...To gain religious asylum, Christians first must obtain refugee status to present their cases,
and that is often difficult</B>. Horowitz tried to help an Ethiopian pastor who had been arrested
and tortured 25 times gain refugee status in the United States. But immigration attorneys told
him the case would be virtually impossible to win because "nobody takes Christian claims
seriously," he said. In some cases, refugees are not allowed to present their cases to INS
officials. In Turkey, for example, the INS requires Iranians applying for refugee status to go
through the United Nations, whose officials allow Muslim Turkish security police to conduct
the investigations. "In the past two years I don't know of a single Iranian refugee that was
accepted" to the United States, said Abe Ghaffari of Iranian Christians International. 
<BR><B>...The situation is complicated by the fact that INS officials rely on State Department human
rights reports, which are "notoriously indifferent, superficial, and inaccurate about religious
persecution," Horowitz said</B>. Inaccurate information causes problems for asylum cases from
former Soviet Republics, said Ann Buwalda, an immigration attorney with the International
Law Group. Since communism fell, the State Department claims that organized persecution
no longer exists in these countries, but Orthodox and Muslim groups actively persecute
Christians there, she said. When presented with documentation, officials dismiss it as "random
violence," Buwalda said. "It is very difficult to get religious asylum cases approved for these
Christians."  
<BR><B>..."The system is fair," according to INS spokesperson Lisa Ross, who said there have been
no complaints of INS officers acting improperly</B>. The whole nation will be held accountable
for the silence of American Christians, Snyder said. Horowitz, who is Jewish, said that if
Jews were being so flagrantly persecuted there would be overwhelming protest. "But it is
going on among Christians and no one is raising a voice in the Christian community."

baptized in one day during an evangelism conference last year</B>. One hundred of the converts
committed themselves to spread the gospel full time among the Banjaras. That gave Christian
evangelists "a bit of fuel," Gary Nelson of Bezalel World Outreach, one of several Western
groups ministering to the Banjaras, told NIRR. Since Hindus believe in hundreds of gods,
they often accept Christ as just another deity to worship. Baptism is a symbol of their
decision to reject all other gods. "In India you are not considered a Christian until you've
been baptized," Nelson said. 
<BR><B>...Since the conference, 2,000 more people have been baptized and Madripurim -- site of the
conference and home of the evangelical Church of South India denomination -- has become
known as the "Christian center" of the state, Nelson said</B>. Hundreds of indigenous evangelists
are visiting Banjaran villages and leading people to Christ. Several dozen evangelists travel
by bicycle to 10 villages apiece every day, preaching and meeting with the leaders, he said.
Evangelists are converting four to eight people a month, Nelson said. Portable
evangelism-training schools go from village to village teaching the baptized converts how to
preach the gospel.  
<BR><B>...Traveling evangelists taught more than 90,000 children in 30 villages about Jesus Christ in
Vacation Bible School this summer</B>. Some 70,000 of the children, age 3 to 15, confessed
Christ. Careful records have been kept and the children will be discipled and, it is hoped,
baptized, Nelson said. Bezalel, Tampa Bay Community Church, and Youth With A Mission
assist the evangelists with funds, teaching materials, and transportation. NIRR 10\16\95

<B>Satanism is rampant among youth in Paraguay, evangelist Alberto Mottesi said after two
weeks of crusades there</B>. "I have never seen another Latin American country where the youth
is so involved in Satanism," he said. Suicides related to Satanism are common. At one school
where Mottesi's team ministered, seven people recently had killed themselves as part of devil
worship, the ministry said. The group held rallies and ministered in schools in several cities.
At a rally in the capital, Asuncion, 600 youth indicated decisions for Christ.  
<BR><B>...Mottesi's crusade in Argentina last month saw 3,000 people converted or rededicated to
Christ, the ministry said</B>. In the city of Roque Saenz Pe a evangelical congregations spent
more than a year preparing for the five-day crusade, and some attended a school taught by
members of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. The crusade, which drew 15,000
people on the final night, included a three-day leadership seminar and a banquet during which
Mottesi encouraged the city's business and political leaders to serve with integrity. Several
hundred leaders turned in decision cards indicating they had prayed to receive Christ. The
city's two television stations broadcast the services live, and one station plans to re-broadcast

Workers preach in train stations, on sidewalks, and in other public places. Hunger for God is
"incredible" and it is not uncommon for 50% of the audience to inquire further about the

<B>A Christian woman is helping strippers reform</B>. Carolyn McKenzie, a former nurse, began her
Memphis, Tenn., ministry "almost by accident" after touring the city's adult book shops and
speaking out against the public-health hazards they present. After a radio interview, a woman
asked McKenzie if she would help her daughter, who had become a stripper. "I had no idea
how I would help her, but I said if the girl would call me, I would do what I could,"
McKenzie told NIRR. She has helped 11 women leave the business, find jobs, and start new
lives.  
<BR><B>...McKenzie prays for the women and discusses spiritual matters, but doesn't push Christianity
on them, she said</B>. "They feel so bad about who they are that it takes people loving and caring
for them before they realize God does, too." Two of the women now are regular churchgoers
and another has become a Christian. They have to abide by certain rules such as no live-in
boyfriends, and no alcohol or drugs. McKenzie also requires them to promise never to return
to stripping and to attend any job interview she arranges for them.   
<BR><B>..."Working with these women with nothing to go on is proof that God will meet your needs,"
McKenzie said</B>. After borrowing money from her parents to help the first two, she has relied
on individual donations. "I talk to everyone about what I do -- in the park or in the grocery
line -- and God moves people to give." A doctor from her congregation volunteered to
provide free health services for the women, and a Christian counselor charges a nominal fee
to help them. The first woman McKenzie helped said she wanted a job as a leasing agent -"Guess what? My husband manages an apartment complex that a man in my church owns,"
McKenzie said. The woman got the job. 
<BR><B>...The strippers could be "any girl in my church," McKenzie said</B>. Most were sexually abused,
and often left home early to take jobs waitressing in topless bars because the money was
good. But after a few weeks the tips dry up, and, faced with growing bills, they are convinced
to strip. "It is a sort of brainwashing. They tell the waitresses how pretty they are and how
much more they could make than the girl on stage," McKenzie said. After the first time
stripping "they lose all self-esteem and just sink lower and lower," she said. NIRR 10\16\95

<B>"We are taking seriously the concept of the priesthood of all believers," said Robert Burkins,
pastor of Elmwood Presbyterian Church in East Orange, N.J</B>. The church, one of the
fastest-growing African-American congregations in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A), is
divided into groups headed by lay ministers who receive training from the pastor and outside
resources. The lay ministers maintain close contact with their groups, refer requests to the
pastor, help with each service, and conduct worship each fifth Sunday. The 15 members of
the board of deacons supplement the lay ministers by visiting the sick, shut-ins, and bereaved.
Since Burkins started the church in 1988, seven members have entered the seminary and the
church has grown from 300 to 800 members. 
<BR><B>...More men are attending and participating at the church, which had been "typical in being
led by females" but now is about 40% male, Burkins said</B>. "The estrangement that keeps men
away from the church can be bridged. Men want to be recognized and appreciated," he said. 
<BR><B>...Elmwood also formed the Harambee Initiative, a nonprofit corporation, which bought a
four-story office building that now houses an array of community services</B>. Among them are a

<B>Episcopal bishops voted to require all dioceses to ordain qualified women to the priesthood</B>.
At their national conference in Portland, Ore., the bishops voted 121-15 to end exemptions
from church rules for bishops who, in conscience, oppose women's ordination. The bishops
would not be required to ordain women priests themselves or receive communion from them.
They would have to find another bishop to ordain women within their dioceses and let
women priests lead parishes. Twenty bishops, including Presiding Bishop Edmond Browning,
abstained from voting. 
<BR><B>...Most bishops believe the dissenters are entitled to their beliefs, but many also say they are
causing undue hardship for the women in their dioceses, news reports said</B>. "The notion of
conscience has all too often been used to circumvent what we believe, and has been used as a
cloak to enable individuals to do whatever they think is right in their own eyes," Bishop
Robert Allen of Atlanta said. The 2.5 million-member Episcopal Church has allowed women
priests since 1976. 
<BR><B>...Four bishops who oppose women's ordination see the vote as a challenge to their religious
freedom</B>. They are Jack Iker of the Fort Worth, Texas, diocese (NIRR 11/14/94); John-David
Schofield, of the San Joaquin diocese, based in Fresno, Calif.; Keith Ackerman, of the Quincy
diocese, based in Peoria, Ill.; and William Wantland of the Eau Claire, Wis., diocese.
Wantland threatened to resign if the action taken Sept. 27 is formalized at the church's
governing convention in 1997 in Philadelphia. A group of six bishops, including the four
conscientious objectors, called the vote "a denial of the basic Anglican principle that the
church cannot demand that which cannot be proven from the plain teaching of Scripture."

She sued under the Equal Access Act after officials at San Diego's University City High

<BR><B>...The decision is binding in nine Western states and is likely to persuade courts in other parts

<B>Seventy-five Southern Baptist churches in Tuscaloosa, Ala., are using television, radio,
newspapers ads, and direct mail to saturate their community with the gospel</B>. For eight years,
the Tuscaloosa Baptist Association has "created an atmosphere of openness" to the church
among the county's 150,000 residents, TBA missions director Jerry Wilkins said. This year,
they mailed 45,000 pieces of Christian literature to homes and placed a full-page ad in the
Sunday newspaper that explains how people can have a personal relationship with Christ.
Since individual churches could not afford the extensive costs, the TBA splits expenses and
promotes all Southern Baptist churches in the area. "We are obeying the command to sow the
seed and leaving the results to God," Wilkins said. 
<BR><B>...The TBA will pay to air more than 400 Christian commercials in the next eight weeks on
local TV stations</B>. The commercials depict the gospel through real-life situations and invite
viewers to church. Other denominations will benefit from the ads as the area is "sensitized to
spiritual life," Wilkins said. The commercials are produced by the Tulsa, Okla.-based Ingram
Media Group. They are "high quality and much cheaper than what we could produce,"
Wilkins said. Tom Ingram, president, said he started the company to encourage churches to
take advantage of the "God-given tool" of television. With the help of an advertising agency,
Ingram conceptualized, designed, and produced nine 30- and 60-second spots for churches.

state constitutional amendment (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/030695.html">NIRR 3/6</A>). Amendment 2 banned all laws and ordinances
protecting homosexuals from discrimination in matters such as housing and employment. The

That ruling focused only on homosexual conduct. The Colorado case raises the broader issue
of how an individual's homosexuality affects his standing in society. No matter how the court
rules on the new question, it will likely affect arguments in pending cases nationwide over

"family of nations." Addressing the General Assembly's 50th anniversary session, he said the
need for the world body was even more obvious now than after its founding at the end of
World War II</B>. Greeted by enthusiastic applause from a crowded hall of delegates, the
75-year-old pontiff said the United Nations had the "historic, even momentous, task of
promoting this qualitative leap in international life." It should do this not only by serving as a
center for the mediation of conflicts, but by fostering values and initiatives that raise the level
of relations between nations "from simple `existence with' others to `existence for' others."
The visit to mark the U.N. jubilee was the central event of the pope's five-day visit to the
United States. It gave a much-needed boost to the beleaguered world body, which is under
increasing criticism, especially in the United States, news commentators said. 
<BR><B>...Calling for the nations of the world to find new ways of dealing with each other, the pope

shall see that the tears of this century have prepared the ground for a new springtime of the

<B>Many African-American Christians greeted O.J</B>. Simpson's acquittal with joy. A large crowd
gathered at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in Los Angeles, a politically
powerful, predominantly black congregation, to watch the verdict on big-screen television.
Congregants bowed their heads in prayer as the court clerk read the decision, then they
erupted in applause. "Black people have been on a downward spiral with a new mood in the
nation which is basically anti-black," said congregant Roland Lewis, Jr. "We were desperate
for any kind of victory, no matter what it was." Some said bitter personal experience made it
easy to believe that Simpson had been railroaded by police and the legal system. A USA
Today/CNN/Gallup Poll found that 66% of blacks believe the criminal justice system is racist,
compared with 37% of whites.

football star smiled, waved, and mouthed "thank you" to his jurors. "We went back and

note, the same way he had concluded his closing arguments. "I want to thank God," he said.
"He always directs our paths and He is worthy to be praised."  
<BR><B>...``I just lifted my head up and I said `Praise God,'" said Rosey Grier, the football star-turned

December was the subject of courtroom debate as prosecutors argued that Simpson may have
confessed to his friend. Judge Lance Ito ruled the conversation be kept private.

Noble as chairman</B>. Woody Phillips of United World Mission was named executive director
and Don Crane of GEM became field director. In its three years of operation, the alliance has
trained 1,500 nationals, who have planted 500 churches.
<P>
<B>Wallace Smith, 66, president of the 243,000-member Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints, plans to retire in April 1995</B>. He designated W. Grant McMurray, an
adviser, to succeed him. If he is approved at the 1995 World Conference, McMurray would
become the first president of the 135-year-old church not descended from its prophet, Joseph
Smith III. During Smith's presidency, which began in 1978, he announced a revelation
encouraging ordination of women into the Independence, Mo.-based church. 
<P>
<B>Drew School of Theology scholar Thomas Oden (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/022095.html">NIRR 2/20</A>) joined the board of directors of
The Institute On Religion & Democracy</B>. The Washington, D.C.-based IRD seeks reform and
renewal in mainline denominations. In addition to his scholarly works on systematic theology
and pastoral care, Oden wrote the controversial book Requiem: A Lament in Three
Movements criticizing mainline Protestant seminaries.
<P>
<B>Speaker of the U.S</B>. House Newt Gingrich addressed 8,000 religious leaders and students at
Liberty University's SuperConference '95. Speaking on the role of religion in public life,
Gingrich said that churches and synagogues should help re-establish a spiritual base in the
country. They should "reach out" so that "every child of God in America truly has life,
liberty, and the right to pursue happiness," he said. Other speakers at the four-day conference
included pastors E.V. Hill and Adrian Rogers.
<P>
<B>Deaths: Joseph Tkach, pastor-general of the Worldwide Church of God (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/052995.html">NIRR 5/29</A>), founded
by Herbert Armstrong; of bone cancer at 68</B>. His son Joseph Tkach, Jr., was designated
successor. 
<BR><B>...Steven Cook, the Philadelphia man who accused Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago of
sexually molesting him as a teen-ager and then retracted the charges in an emotional
encounter (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/012395.html">NIRR 1/23</A>), died of an AIDS-related illness at age 35</B>. "The reconciliation
between Steven and myself last December was a blessed event for both of us," Bernardin said
after Cook's death.

<B>Canada: Canadian Union College, a Seventh-day Adventist school, is investigating an
apparent series of forgeries that cost the school $672,000, according to AdventPress</B>. A
sub-contractor hired to upgrade the school's computer system allegedly forged checks on the
college's bank accounts, police said. 
<P>
<B>Most Christians have no idea what their spiritual gifts are, according to a nationwide survey
by Barna Research Group</B>. Although 88% of born-again Christians have heard of spiritual
gifts, only 39% can identify a spiritual gift they believe they possess. "A small proportion of
adults are actively seeking to minister in ways which capitalize upon their giftedness," pollster
George Barna said. 
<BR><B>...Three out of four adults have heard of the gift of tongues or about people speaking in
tongues, and 7% said they have spoken in tongues, the poll found</B>. 
<P>
<B>Some 62 teen-agers and 22 younger children made commitments to Christ during evangelist
Ralph Bell's Western North Carolina crusade Sept</B>. 24-27. The 4-day event, held in
Waynesville, included music, magic shows, entertainment in local schools, and sermons by
Bell, an associate with the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. More than 7,000 people
attended the crusade.  
<P>
<B>The process of relocating the United Methodist Church's Board of Global Ministries from
New York to a five-story building to be constructed in Reston, Va., would cost $72 million,
the church's site-selection committee announced</B>. Interest on a 15-year loan also would add
$30 million to the cost, according to the report, which will be taken up by the denomination's
General Conference at its April meeting. 
<BR><B>...Conservatives say that the present site tends to influence the denomination to be liberal and
out of touch with more conservative UMC members</B>. Liberals say the group's location in New
York makes it easier to work with various church groups and keep in touch with the
international community.
<P>
<B>The U.S</B>. Supreme Court refused to enforce a federal judge's order authorizing seizure of
Church of Scientology materials from former members who published them on the Internet
(<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/082195.html">NIRR 8/21</A>). The church had sought the materials, claiming they were copyrighted,
confidential scriptures of the religion that were written by founder L. Ron Hubbard. 
<P>
<B>Leaders of two of the nation's largest black denominations said they do not support Nation of
Islam leader Louis Farrakhan's call for 1 million black men to march on Washington (NIRR
10/2)</B>. Their statements contradicted Jesse Jackson's claim that they had endorsed the event.
Henry Lyons, president of the 8.2 million-member National Baptist Convention, and Bennett
Smith, Sr., head of the 2 million-member Progressive National Baptist Convention, said they
will not attend the Oct. 16 march. Lyons denounced Jackson's statement as "an outright lie,"
news reports said. 
<P>
<B>The Catholic Diocese of Toledo set up a special telephone number to field confidential
allegations of child sexual misconduct among clergy, lay employees, and volunteers</B>. If a
claim is supported by enough evidence, an alleged offender will be promptly relieved of
duties and referred for evaluation and intervention, the diocese said. 
<P>
<B>Conservative Judaism may split into East- and West-coast factions over the University of
Judaism of Los Angeles' decision to ordain rabbis, said Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, chancellor of
New York's Jewish Theological Seminary</B>. For 108 years, JTS has been the only school in
North America to ordain rabbis in Conservative Judaism, which stands between Reform and
Reconstructionist Judaism to its left and Orthodox Judaism to its right. The New York
seminary educates old-style scholars while the Los Angeles school produces rabbis suited to
reaching modern Jews alienated from the faith, Religion News Service said.
<P>
<B>The poor need the right attitudes even more than the right skills to succeed at entry-level
jobs, a survey found</B>. According to a Roper Starch poll of 305 employers, dependability,
honesty, and the ability to follow instructions are more important than technical skills.  
<BR><B>...The study "validates the role spirituality plays" in helping the poor, said Steve Burger,
executive director of the International Union of Gospel Missions, which released the study</B>.
To change attitudes, "you must change the heart," and that is done best through spiritual
regeneration, he said.  
<BR><B>...The IUGM represents 250 inner-city missions across North America, Australia, Guyana,
India, and South Africa</B>. In 1994, IUGM missions recorded 164,000 spiritual decisions, served
27 million meals, provided 9 million nights of shelter, and graduated 12,000 men and women
from long-term rehabilitation programs. God or baseball? Jewish ticket holders for
Cleveland's first postseason baseball games in 41 years had a tough choice. The Indians'
playoff series against the Boston Red Sox fell during observances of Yom Kippur, the holiest
of the High Holy Days of the Jewish faith, Oct. 3-4. 
<BR><B>...A lot of teeth-gnashing and handwringing went on, said Martin Plax, area director of the
American Jewish Committee</B>. One fan suggested petitioning the team to reschedule the games,
he said. "When entertainment becomes the focal point of our existence, we're in trouble,"
Plax told the Cleveland Plain Dealer. 
<BR><B>...Howard Groedel, who received his box-seat tickets by the time he noticed the conflict,
decided to sell them and donate the money to charity</B>. "I just couldn't have enjoyed it." The
Indians swept the series 3-0.
<P>
<B>Students ignorant about Christianity are increasingly common on college campuses, even at
schools affiliated with denominations, campus pastors say</B>. One student who came to a
candlelight service at Susquehanna University, a Selinsgrove, Pa., school affiliated with the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, told campus pastor Christopher Thomforde that she
didn't realize Joy To The World was a religious song. "It was just mall music to her," he told
The Lutheran. Some students in Thomforde's Literature and Culture class are surprised to find
the story of the Good Samaritan in the Bible, he said. 
<BR><B>...Looking for opportunities to work with students on issues of common concern, such as the
homeless or immigration rights, is effective, said Herb Schmidt, pastor of University Lutheran
Church at Stanford University</B>. As Christians form relationships with students, they "want to
find out what's involved for us as people of faith," he said.
<P>
<B>Conservative religious groups are supporting Rep</B>. Frank Wolf's (R-Va.) proposed commission
to study the impact of gambling on America (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/020695.html">NIRR 2/6</A>). Leaders of the American Family
Association, the Christian Coalition, Concerned Women for America, Family Research
Council, Focus on the Family, and the Traditional Values Coalition sent a letter to House
Speaker Newt Gingrich supporting H.R. 497, which calls for the commission. After a Sept. 29
hearing in the House, the bill was passed on for review by the Judiciary Committee.
"Gambling is becoming a bigger and bigger issue," an FRC representative said. The Coalition
will fund a full-time anti-gambling lobbyist, director Ralph Reed told reporters. 
<P>
<B>After nearly 16 years of meeting in schools, country clubs, warehouses, tents and mental
hospitals, Saddleback Valley Community Church (NIRR 12/12/94) moved into its own
facility</B>. Nearly 12,000 people filled three dedication services Sept. 17 for the Lake Forest,
Calif., congregation, Baptist Press said. The event included the baptism of 384 new converts
in Saddleback's outdoor pool as worshipers watched on three large video screens. The next
week, members opened the building to the community. Hundreds of unchurched neighbors
attended the services, resulting in 210 professions of faith and 64 baptisms. 
<BR><B>...Saddleback began in pastor Rick Warren's home in 1980 with seven members</B>. Over the
years, the church has met in 79 different facilities in five cities. "If you could figure out
where we were each week, you got to come," joked a member. Members attribute the growth
to Warren's emphasis on building people rather than erecting buildings.

<B>"I don't blame society for its problems, I blame the church," urban expert Raymond Bakke
told NIRR</B>. While American cities crumble, most white Christians isolate themselves in the
suburbs, said the author of The Urban Christian. Bakke heads the Chicago-based International
Urban Associates, which addresses issues of poverty and world urbanization. He has led
consultations on six continents, pastored churches in Seattle and Chicago, and coordinates the
Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization's outreach to large cities. 
<BR><B>...Many suburban white churches are "comfort zones" where pastors feed congregants a
"pablum diet" when it comes to the needs of those outside their social circles, he said</B>. Yet the
Bible contains 400 passages on the poor, 64 of which tell believers to help vulnerable people
such as immigrants, migrants, widows, and the jobless, Bakke said. A graduate of Moody
Bible Institute and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, Bakke said he is appalled that
"Scripture is ignored" when it comes to the needy. Christians can't fix everything wrong with
society, but they often rationalize their inactivity with the "pessimistic theology" that believers
can't do anything about society's problems and "will be Raptured out of it anyway," he said. 
<BR><B>..."Where are the evangelicals?" asked Bakke, who is white and raised his family in inner-city
Chicago, where he and his wife still live</B>. "Are we biblical, or are we just ideological?"
Entering the city for an evangelistic event and then going home to the suburbs is not enough,
he said. Some white evangelicals are "beginning to break out of their ideological mold" and
are making long-term commitments in communities where the needs are great and the
potential rewards of ministry are tremendous, Bakke said. NIRR 10/2/94

<B>Middle-class Christians in Fresno, Calif., have been insulated from the struggles of the poor</B>.
But for three years, Fresno pastors, laypeople, and civic leaders have served the needy in an
outreach being replicated in other cities. 
<BR><B>...Fresno's movement began in 1992 as fires burned in Los Angeles, 200 miles south, after the
Rodney King verdict (NIRR 5/18/92)</B>. Realizing that Fresno -- a city of 450,000 Americans of
European, Hispanic, African, and Asian descent -- was "tinder dry," about 40 pastors began
meeting to pray for God's guidance, Buse Karraker, pastor of Northwest Church, told NIRR.
Pastors of various ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds became acquainted and "reconciled
at the cross," pledging their mutual friendship, love, and cooperation.  
<BR><B>...The pastors then began seeking ways to keep Fresno from exploding in racial conflict</B>.
Joining with laypeople and Christian civic leaders, they started meeting once a month on the
top floors of buildings, where they could overlook the city and pray for its hurting people.
The informal group chose to call itself No-Name Fellowship to avoid ideological labels. They
met in a different location each month, including Fresno's City Hall, Rescue Mission, county
jail, high schools, school district office, International Trade Center, and Fresno Pacific
College. At each meeting, a representative of the institution explained his or her needs. "We
tried to wake our people up," Karraker said. 
<BR><B>...As the Christians "got out of the churches and into the community," they saw, understood,
and began to respond to its needs, said Jim Westgate, a professor at Mennonite Brethren
Biblical Seminary in Fresno</B>. During a No-Name Fellowship meeting at Juvenile Hall, where
young offenders are kept, a circuit court judge and a probation official challenged the group
to get involved with troubled youth. In response, 3,000 Christian volunteers are spending time
with young people or working in juvenile-system programs. "That's more volunteers than they
could imagine," Westgate said.  
<BR><B>...Civic and church leaders are revitalizing six of Fresno's most crime-ridden, drug-infested,
and impoverished neighborhoods</B>. First, police launch an offensive to drive out criminals.
"Then the police say, `OK church, where are you? Come to life,'" Karraker said. Volunteers
began teaching parenting classes, holding Bible clubs, and forming neighborhood
organizations. After police cleaned out a huge apartment complex "that was nothing but
trouble," volunteers befriended the residents, teaching them how to find and get a job.  
<BR><B>...In several of the city's poorest schools, Christians tutored students, monitored playgrounds,
and "did anything the schools needed," Karraker said</B>. As a consequence, reading levels rose.
One school, Lowell Elementary, which was close to being shut down, was removed from the
school system's "at-risk" list. Fresno inner-city schools, which once "tried to keep Christians
out, have invited the church in," according to Karraker. 
<BR><B>...Now that crime is down and hopes are up, indigenous leaders are emerging in impoverished
Fresno neighborhoods</B>. Economic revitalization is beginning, too, as new businesses move into
the area and offer employment, and banks make more loans. 
<BR><B>...All 6,000 volunteers involved in the No-Name Fellowship's Lovenet Network and its
offshoot, the nonprofit Fresno Leadership Corporation, are conservative Christians</B>. "That has
raised eyebrows in the liberal churches," said Westgate, who heads the nonprofit. "We're
getting criticism that evangelicals are trying to run the city. This is new for us." 
<BR><B>...Fresno Christians have "raised the whole level of community spirit," Karraker said</B>. Leaders
say their commitment is long term, and several have moved their residences to the inner city.
"Our goal is to change the community one school at a time, one block at a time, one person
at a time," Karraker said. Other No-Name Fellowships, based on Fresno's model, have begun
in Bakersfield and Modesto, Calif. NIRR 10/2/94
<P>
<B>Some 6,500 people -- including homosexuals, prostitutes, and those involved in black magic
and witchcraft -- have come to Christ at a church in Pensacola, Fla</B>. Services that began on
Father's Day at Brownsville Assembly of God have continued there five nights a week (NIRR
9/4). Lindale, Texas, evangelist Stephen Hill, who planned to preach only one service June
18, extended his stay when spontaneous revival broke out, and has moved into a Pensacola
apartment with his family. Since June, some 170,000 people have visited the "very
conservative, traditional, upper-middle-class church located in the worst neighborhood of
town," music minister Lindell Cooley told NIRR. The church fills its new sanctuary, old
sanctuary, and cafeteria each night as services last from 7 p.m. until 1 a.m.  
<BR><B>..."It's so much fun because the new believers are not religious and don't know how to act" in
church, Cooley said</B>. "I hope they never learn," he said. When Cooley plays a song about
taking another drink of living water, they "act like they're in a bar or concert, whistling and
yelling." 
<BR><B>..."I loved the Lord, but I was so tired of church," said Cooley, 32, formerly a worship leader,
composer, and producer at a large church in Nashville</B>. He confessed that over the years he
had learned to manipulate congregants' emotions with music. Now joy and spontaneity mark
his worship, he said. "We've done church so many years without God, that when He shows
up, it's wonderful. It's like it should have been." 
<BR><B>...Many pastors have been affected by the services</B>. Cooley said he believes "there is a
segment of us who have learned to love religion" and resist change, but "there is a larger
number of us who really want the Lord." Cooley said many pastors call him, and when he
describes what is happening at Brownsville AG, "I hear some of them weeping on the other
end of the line." NIRR 10/2/94

<B>Reaching 3 billion people with the gospel in the next five years is the goal of WorldReach, an
initiative of the Christian Broadcasting Network</B>. WorldReach will organize and coordinate
activities between CBN and other ministries. Through television, films, videos, printed
materials, and door-to-door evangelism, WorldReach aims to convert and disciple 500 million
people by the year 2000. It will emphasize starting fellowship groups, cell-group
congregations, and traditional churches. "We feel this is a key time for God to bring revival
to the world," The 700 Club's Ben Kinchlow told NIRR. "More people have come to the
Lord through CBN in the past two years than in all its history."  
<BR><B>...The campaign began with RevivalFest '95, tent-meeting-style revival services lasting seven
days on CBN's grounds in Virginia Beach</B>. National and international evangelists such as Oral
Roberts, James Robison, and Benny Hinn preached at evening services. Morning prayer
breakfasts featured evangelist Sid Roth, Crystal Cathedral pastor Robert Schuller, and Youth
With A Mission's Floyd McClung. Some 4,000 people attended nightly services and 40-50
churches participated in services and local outreach, CBN's Patty Richardson said. NIRR

<P>
<B>More than 2,000 Rwandans made commitments to Christ in the country's first evangelistic
meetings since last year's massacres</B>. Fort Worth, Texas-based evangelist Sammy Tippit
preached during four days of meetings to some 17,000 people in Kigali and Butare. For three
days in Butare, he preached to students at the National University of Rwanda, held
evangelistic services at a soccer stadium, and met with educators. In Kigali, he held one
service and attended a meeting between evangelical church leaders and government officials. 
<BR><B>...Brokenness and repentance marked the evangelistic services and a conference attended by
500 evangelical pastors, Tippit told NIRR</B>. "The pain and anger runs very deep" over last
year's atrocities, especially since some church leaders participated, Tippit said. Pastors wailed
as pain poured from their hearts, he said. They are "making things right between each other"
and their purpose now is to rebuild the nation. 
<BR><B>...The evangelical movement in Rwanda in growing as Tutsi pastors who lived outside the
country since before the massacre are coming back</B>. About 60% of the evangelical pastors are
new and their character is not questioned because they were not present during the massacres,

<B>Some 42,000 Christians attended an all-night prayer meeting in Cali, Colombia, Aug</B>. 20,
Nick Woodberry of Latin America Mission told NIRR. Pastors from a wide range of
evangelical denominations had held weekly prayer meetings, and on Maundy Thursday 20,000
people prayed all night in churches around the city as part of a Holy Week initiative. "But
things began getting worse, drug-wise," in the city, Woodberry said. Cali was home to one
the world's largest drug cartels before a crackdown last month led to the arrest of its leaders
(<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/082195.html">NIRR 8/21</A>). In order to make a public statement, the pastors decided to hold an all-night
meeting in a public place. Lacking money to rent a covered auditorium, they approached the
mayor of Cali, who is a Christian, for help. He secured a 55,000-seat soccer stadium without
charge and during the meeting publicly prayed for the city to be dedicated to Christ. NIRR

<B>Three Seventh-day Adventist women were ordained into the ministry last month, defying a

<B>United Methodists are considering ways to redefine church membership</B>. After seven years of

Mark Trotter, a San Diego, Calif., pastor, issued the document By Water and the Spirit: A
United Methodist Understanding of Baptism. Currently, individuals become members of the
church by professing their faith. But the proposed legislation calls for two types of church
members -- "baptized" and "professing." Baptized members are people of any age who have
received baptism. Professing members are baptized people who have professed their faith at
baptism, confirmation, or by transfer of membership from another congregation. Only the
professing membership roll would be used as the basis for financial apportionment and
statistical information. The report was sent to the churchwide Board of Discipleship on its

<B>The conservative agenda is "fundamentally incomplete" if it does not recognize the roles of
religious groups, private institutions, and individuals to nurture society, conservative leaders
said</B>. Renewing society through the "private institutions and ideals that nurture lives" is behind
Sen. Dan Coats' (R-Ind.) and Empower America co-director William Bennett's Project for
American Renewal. The plan includes 18 bills to strengthen the role of fathers and mentors,
bolster communities, and encourage charitable acts by private and religious institutions and
individuals.  
<BR><B>...Giving private and religious anti-poverty charities 7% of the welfare budget is one proposal
under the plan</B>. Under existing law, religious charities that receive government money cannot
use that money to finance religious programs. Coats' proposal would allow public financing
of religious programs, but forbid proselytizing. Some religious groups oppose any government
funding for their programs. Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs general counsel Brent
Walker said government should be neutral toward religion, and added, "Where government
money goes, so goes government regulation."

<B>A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit against a public high school and its choir director, ruling
that devotional music sung in school is not an "explicit religious exercise" (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/062695.html">NIRR 6/26</A>)</B>.
"Public schools are not required to delete from the curriculum all materials that may offend
any religious sensibility," Judge J. Thomas Greene ruled. The suit was brought by 16-year-old
Rachel Bauchman, a Jewish student at West High School in Salt Lake City, Utah. She
claimed that choir teacher Richard Torgerson, a Mormon, compelled students to sing Christian
songs and perform in churches, and berated those who objected. She plans to appeal the
decision.  
<BR><B>...The case galvanized promoters and opponents of school prayer, who are watching it as a
test of the boundaries of acceptable religious activity in public schools</B>. The conflict attracted

<B>The Internet is becoming a fund-raising tool</B>. Hundreds of nonprofit organizations have
electronic-mail addresses or home pages on the World Wide Web, and electronic fund raising
is the logical next step, news reports said. Some sites have pledge forms that Web users can
fill out and return via e-mail. In a few days the giver receives a bill by U.S. mail. Other
charities work with Internet banks. A user can call an Internet banking service and open an
account with a credit card; then a giver merely supplies an account number and the bank
charges the donation to a credit card, without the number going out over the Net. Some
groups even host online benefits, such as Cookin' on the Net, which plans to raise $25,000 by
selling the recipes of famous chefs for $12 donations.  
<BR><B>...Many people are wary of online giving, afraid that personal information will be tapped by

discovery and choose where they want the game to lead. "It's a journey game and the object
is to stir reflection," Swanson told NIRR. One path called "Faces of Jesus" explores various
artists' portrayals of Christ over the centuries and how they have been affected by the cultures
that created them. "We make Him look like us, but we need to remember that Jesus was
Jewish and not any of the cultural things we attach to Him," Swanson said. Another loop
deals with various forms of evil and how people perceive Jesus would confront them.

friends, teachers, parents, political leaders, and themselves. The annual See You at the Pole
(NIRR 9/19/94), a movement that began with a few Texas students in 1990, involves some 20
nations. Last year, about 2 million people participated at 75% of U.S. high schools, and
interest in the event has continued to grow. The demand for promotional literature was 50%
higher this year than last, said Doug Clark of the San Diego, Calif.-based National Network
of Youth Ministries, which promotes SYATP.    
<BR><B>...Praying publicly unifies and emboldens Christian students, Clark said</B>. Many students talk
about their faith after other classmates see them praying. The annual prayer rallies also have
given impetus to an ongoing prayer emphasis on campuses, Clark told NIRR. See You at the
Pole is part of "a sovereign move of God's Spirit that is historic among students" at an age
when they are most reachable with the gospel, Clark said. Some 90%-95% of all people who
accept Christ do so before age 21, the group said. In the United States this year, about 75
denominations, ministries, media, and legal groups promoted the movement.

scholarship money for Africa University, a UMC school in Zimbabwe (NIRR 5/16/94)</B>. The
so-called "pedaling parsons" collected $51,000 in pledges, stopping at churches along the
way. The pastors have raised $70,000 on previous rides for missions projects.

<B>United Methodists won't appeal a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that its clergy are not
self-employed for tax purposes (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/082195.html">NIRR 8/21</A>).</B> The Internal Revenue Service denied UMC
minister Michael Weber business deductions he claimed as a self-employed person. A tax
court ruled the IRS was correct, and a federal circuit court of appeals upheld the decision.
Many UMC ministers have defined themselves as self-employed for tax purposes. The
denomination will pursue amnesty with the IRS for pastors who filed in good faith as
self-employed.

<B>Homeless people get voice mail in Omaha, Neb</B>. Smart Data Connections donated 16 voice
mailboxes for clients of a local Rescue Mission. Each mailbox has its own telephone number
so that homeless people can record a message, giving them a better chance of success with a
potential employer or landlord. Voice mail "has helped our people present a better image to
the public," said mission staff member Dan Hovanec.

<B>Florida Baptists are dissolving a 112-year-old relationship with Stetson University over
differences between conservative religious views and liberal educational policies (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/051595.html">NIRR 5/15</A>)</B>.
Stetson refused earlier this year to rescind a student policy permitting drinking alcohol on its
campuses. The relationship between Florida Baptists and the university has been strained in
recent years due to school policies on abortion counseling, dorm visitation, and condom
distribution. The Florida Baptist Convention, meeting Nov. 13-15, is expected to officially
sever its relationship with the school. 
<BR><B>...Gifts and other financial assistance to the school have totaled $26 million since 1949,
Baptist sources said</B>. Stetson is the latest of a half-dozen Southern colleges that dissolved or
revised ties with the Southern Baptist Convention.

<B>Austria: Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer, still facing allegations of sexually abusing a boy
(<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/082195.html">NIRR 8/21</A>), retired last month</B>. The controversy, which began six months ago, precipitated a
crisis in the Austrian Catholic Church. Many congregants have left the Church and 500,000
signed a petition demanding reform, including an end to priestly celibacy.  
<P>
<B>Germany: Seven Catholic laymen, together with liberal Catholic theologian Hans Kung (NIRR
6/12), started a petition drive to challenge church teachings, news reports said</B>. Following the
lead of Austrian Catholics, the petitioners will ask bishops to give women a larger role in the
church, liberalize its teachings on sex, and do away with priestly celibacy.

<B>Lithuania: A Methodist congregation that was scattered more than 50 years ago has
re-formed</B>. During the 1944 Soviet invasion, the congregation was forced to disband as all the
clergy and most members fled the region. But a few stayed in the area. Recently, when they
learned only 20 people were needed to register as a congregation, the old members gathered.
The church reopened Aug. 30. The original members sang a hymn they had sung at their last
worship service. "It was a very moving moment," said S.T. Kimbrough, a United Methodist

new guidelines are "a little step in the right direction."

<B>Poland: Roman Catholic bishops are urging parishioners to vote ruling leftist government
officials, many of whom are former communists, out of office</B>. The party voted in parliament
to slow ratification of a treaty between Poland and the Vatican, an act the bishops said is war

the government said it will create a permanent Catholic influence in schools, the military, and
other areas.

<B>Poland: People are flocking to see Priest despite the Catholic Church's opposition to the film</B>.
Distributors say organized protests and a media onslaught by Catholic-supported groups

Since its debut last month, 75,000 people in the heavily Catholic country have seen the
movie, which depicts sexually active and homosexual priests.

<B>Russia: The head of the Russian Orthodox Church expressed concern about religious groups
sponsoring candidates in the country's upcoming elections for parliament, news reports said</B>.
The Union of Muslims of Russia has a slate of candidates who may "generate division"

faiths can become involved in politics, but a religious party may lead to "sad consequences,"
he said.

<B>Fifty students became Christians and 120 rededicated their lives to Christ in the first three
days of school at Jupiter Christian School in Jupiter, Fla</B>. "Never in my life have I seen
anything that compares to what has happened here," Steve Whitaker, principal of the K-12
nondenominational school, told NIRR. 
<BR><B>...A spiritual move began prior to the opening of school</B>. During a retreat among 24 seniors
and four adults at a camp near Lake Okeechobee, "most of us were expecting another series
of predictable lectures with a little recreation sprinkled in," said John Workman, student body
president. But the agenda changed as students vented "burdens, fears, frustrations, and anger"
caused by parental conflicts and divorce. One devotional session stretched to four hours as
students confessed deadness and dryness in their Christian lives. 
<BR><B>..."The hardest athletes began weeping under the influence of the Holy Spirit," Whitaker said</B>.
As students confessed, "relationships were mended, hearts were broken, and lives were
changed for all eternity," he said. At midnight, the group sang as three students were baptized
in the campground's swimming pool. 
<BR><B>...The retreat's influence spilled over to the rest of the student body</B>. The school year began
with three days of spiritual emphasis during which Bill Kallenberg, a speaker from Atlanta,
was to deliver several chapel messages. He invited the seniors to share what God did at the
retreat. One by one, the seniors left the bleachers and "confessed Jesus as their Lord and
Savior" in front of their 650 classmates who packed the gymnasium, Whitaker said. The
leading scorer on the basketball team confessed to his classmates that for years "my god has
been basketball," but that Jesus Christ had become pre-eminent in his life. As the young man
left the podium, he went into the stands where he "buried his head on his dad's shoulder and
wept," Whitaker said. Students also prayed publicly for Whitaker, who asked God to
strengthen and revitalize him in his work. 
<BR><B>...Jupiter students shared stories of their renewal at assemblies in seven local schools and
eight churches with other similar meetings planned</B>. Whitaker said he has received reports
from those schools of students praying to receive Christ after the presentations. This could
have been the start of just another school year "if not for the fact that we serve a
prayer-hearing and prayer-answering God who delights in hanging an `extra' on the
`ordinary,'" he said. NIRR 9/18/95

<B>Women who lead ministries say God is calling Christian women to higher levels of
responsibility in the church</B>. "The pendulum is swinging back" to an era when men and
women more freely shared leadership duties, author Evelyn Christenson told NIRR. "We had
a lot more freedom before women's liberation." Christian men reacted to the movement,
which began in the 1950s, by "getting very nervous, and removing women from leadership
and decision-making roles," she said. "We were getting along fine before." 
<BR><B>...Christian women have been uncertain of their roles in the church, they say</B>. "A woman can
be a vice president in the bank, but is not allowed to be treasurer in the church," said Lucille
Dunbar of Mission Aviation Fellowship. In secular jobs, women have found they have more
skills than they realized, she said. But if the church's male leadership discounts those skills,
"where does that woman go? Where does her energy get channeled?" Dunbar asked. "She
finds other ways of serving -- that may not be through the Christian church." 
<BR><B>...Evangelical women are not out to compete with or threaten men, the leaders said</B>. "Who's
in charge isn't the issue," Dunbar said. "The issue is, God has called us together to redeem a
lost world. We have gifts and talents, and each is necessary -- I don't see that as a threat
thing or a competition thing," she said. If men and women can put pride aside, they both can
use their spiritual gifts much more productively and cooperatively, Christenson said. "If you
don't care who gets the glory, you can get a lot done." 
<BR><B>...Wives who have prayed for their husbands to assume spiritual leadership say they are
delighted, not intimidated, when the men take that responsibility</B>. Promise Keepers has been
"a blessing and reward to women" who have prayed for their husbands, said Catherine
Hickem of Del Ray, Fla., who started Ministry Wives Network International. Men will return
the favor, she said. "As men of God become all they can become, they will be encouraging
women to do likewise," she said.  
<BR><B>...Cooperation among women leaders is increasing</B>. At an evangelism conference this summer,
some 400 women gathered at the Billy Graham Center at Wheaton College. The women, from
many denominations and parachurch groups, attended four days of workshops, where they
prayed together and built friendships. Hickem said she did not see egotism, competition, or
jealousy, but instead experienced a loving and humble spirit at the conference. NIRR 9/18/95

<B>More than 7,500 people responded to invitations to commit their lives to Christ during
pastor-evangelist Greg Laurie's San Diego Harvest Crusade last month (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/072495.html">NIRR 7/24</A>)</B>. The
three-day event drew 80,000 people to Jack Murphy Stadium for Christian rock music and
preaching. "I've heard it said that the MTV generation doesn't want to listen to somebody
stand up for 35 or 40 minutes and talk about the Bible -- but we have found the opposite to
be true," Laurie said. Dubbed the Preacher to the Boomers and Generation Xers, Laurie's
topics ranged from Jerry Garcia and Mickey Mantle to the admission that, in his past, "unlike
our president, I did inhale." NIRR 9/18/95

<B>Three hundred Namibian teen-agers pledged to abstain from premarital sex as Youth for
Christ Namibia launched a national abstinence movement</B>. Namibia's health, social services,
and education leaders endorsed the plan, according to Alison Alford, a Christian journalist in
southern Africa. It is based on True Love Waits (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/082195.html">NIRR 8/21</A>), an abstinence campaign that
has garnered commitments from 200,000 teens around the world. 
<BR><B>...Organizers plan to take the campaign to every school in Namibia</B>. "Kids need a compelling
reason why sex is worth waiting for," said Dave Scherrer of Worth Waiting For, a co-sponsor
of the campaign. Scherrer and Youth For Christ's Joe Holtzhausen hope to take the campaign,
the first of its kind on the continent, to teens in 20 other African countries. NIRR 9/18/95

<B>MAP International is providing a Christian response to the AIDS crisis in Kenya</B>. The
Brunswick, Ga.-based relief agency provides pastors with biblically-based materials to help
them teach their congregations how to prevent the disease and care for its sufferers. Pastors
welcome the materials since they have been unsure how to preach about the subject, MAP's
Michael Nyenhuis told NIRR. The program is run by MAP with funding assistance from
AIDS Care and Prevention, part of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Materials
include sermon outlines on abstinence and compassion, Bible-study materials on reaching out
to AIDS sufferers, and a testimonial video. 
<BR><B>...Four MAP regional directors are taking the materials to pastors throughout the country</B>. The
ministries are developing the Kenyan Christian AIDS Network to continue the work when
AIDSCAP ends next year. Kenya, a largely Christian nation, has been severely affected by
AIDS in recent years. NIRR 9/18/95

<B>The South Korean church is at the forefront of pledging to send missionaries to the largely
Muslim 10/40 Window countries</B>. Koreans are trying to reach each of the 2,085 groups on
AD 2000 and Beyond's least-evangelized people list, David Hargrove, a spokesman for the
movement, told NIRR. Korean churches in the United States have committed to send
missionaries to 300 of the people groups on the list, and the Korean AD 2000 coordinator
hopes churches in Korea can send missionaries to the rest. The recent Global Consultation on
World Evangelization (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/061295.html">NIRR 6/12</A>), held in Seoul, inspired and challenged the Korean church
in the initiative, Hargrove said. 
<BR><B>...Korea's location is ideal for reaching 10/40 Window countries</B>. Travel expenses for a
Korean missionary are about one-quarter of those of a Westerner, and the cultural adjustment
is much easier, Hargrove said. Many Koreans already live in Middle Eastern and Asian
countries, including Iran, Russia, China, and Uzbekistan. In one Middle Eastern country, 5%
of the 30,000-strong Korean community is comprised of witnessing Christians, AD 2000 said.
<BR><B>...Korea has emerged as one of the largest non-Western missionary-sending countries</B>. More
than 4,000 Koreans are serving as missionaries in other countries and one of every 5,000
Korean Christians is a missionary, Hargrove said. NIRR 9/18/95

<B>Cowboys for Christ is going great guns after 25 years of ministry to farmers, ranchers, and
rodeo cowboys, its founder says</B>. The Fort Worth, Texas-based nonprofit group conducts
church services, baptisms, and weddings wherever people in the livestock industry gather -including rodeos, horse races, and show-horse circuits. CFC has 50 chapters in the United
States and other countries, gives out literature at livestock events, and publishes a monthly
newspaper. 
<BR><B>...Founder and president Ted Pressley is a former rodeo cowboy</B>. "I was drunk. I fought. You
bet," he told the Dallas Morning News. He came to Christ after a gunfight with another man
over rights to grazing land. Pressley, 56, graduated from Southwestern Baptist Theological
Seminary and pastored two churches before God told him to start Cowboys For Christ, he
said. Rodeo cowboys are rough and rowdy, and "no one wanted to take them on -- and I
didn't either," he said. But Pressley, with his jeans, cowboy hat, and handlebar mustache, is
accepted by the group. NIRR 9/18/95

<B>The Southern Baptist Convention's apology for condoning racism (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/062695.html">NIRR 6/26</A>) came too late,
the president of a predominantly black Baptist convention said</B>. "There's been a whole lot of
time since [the end of] slavery for good Christian people to apologize," said E. Edward Jones,
president of the 4.5 million-member National Baptist Convention of America, Inc. Jones said
the unstated purpose of the resolution was to enable Southern Baptists to attract more
members and churches from the African-American community. "What I really think the
apology was about was a way to help Southern Baptists grow," he told the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram.  
<BR><B>...SBC Second Vice President Gary Frost, who accepted the apology at the convention on
behalf of black members of the denomination, said Baptists realize the apology is late</B>. He
asked Jones to give the denomination's leaders time to prove their sincerity with their actions.

<B>Some 200 bishops and officers from Methodist denominations around the world gathered in
Seoul, South Korea, to discuss the state of the church</B>. The leaders came from the United
Methodist Church, the Methodist Church in Malaysia, the Korean Methodist Church, and
other Wesleyan denominations. 
<BR><B>...Leaders gave formal reports from five regions</B>. UMC Bishop Kenneth Carder said the
church in North America "has become so captured by the culture that its ethos is
indistinguishable from the American way of life." He said the church is "culturally
marginalized" and less influential than ever before. Walter Klaiber, a UMC bishop from
Germany, said that while Western Europe has lost its missionary zeal, Eastern Europe is
experiencing a new awakening.  
<BR><B>...The Asian church is growing, but the economic success of many Asian countries creates a
tendency to neglect the poor, Dennis Dutton of the Methodist Church in Malaysia told the
group</B>. Churches are being established in Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, and although
many pastors are leaving Hong Kong, more than 5,000 congregations have been formed in
China over the past two decades, he said. The African Church is vibrant despite economic,
social, and political troubles, their representative said. Cuban believers have organized more
than 100 home churches in two years, a Latin American bishop said. NIRR 9/18/95

<B>A Southwest Baptist University theology student who sued Wal-Mart because he was required
to work on Sundays has reached an out-of-court settlement with the nation's largest retailer</B>.
Scott Hamby, who worked in the electronics department of a Bolivar, Mo., Wal-Mart, filed a
$5 million religious discrimination lawsuit in 1993. Hamby received an undisclosed payment.
The settlement, reached last month, calls for Wal-Mart to educate its 2,200 managers and
regional trainers about religious discrimination and employees' rights. 
<BR><B>...By law, employers must try to accommodate the religious convictions of employees unless
doing so would hurt the business, Baptist Press said</B>. Wal-Mart must include information
about worker rights in its employee handbook. A Wal-Mart spokesman called the store's
actions an honest mistake. 
<BR><B>...The case "could have far-reaching implications for other companies with weekend staffing
needs that conflict with workers' religious practices," The Wall Street Journal said</B>. Hamby,
23, said he hopes the case will encourage Christians to stand up for their beliefs. In recent
years, Christians "have kind of become known as pushovers," he said. Hamby has since
graduated from Southwest and is pursuing careers in law enforcement and evangelism. NIRR

<B>College football players who kneel to pray briefly after a touchdown won't be penalized, the
National Collegiate Athletic Association said</B>. Beginning this season, referees are increasing
enforcement of a rule requiring a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct against players
who remove their helmets to pose for television cameras, taunt and bait opponents, or practice
elaborate dances after touchdowns. But the NCAA clarified its policy to allow prayer after
Liberty University, its football coach Sam Rutigliano, and four players sued in U.S. District
Court in Western Virginia. They claimed the rule violated their right to freedom of religious
expression.  
<BR><B>...For years, many players at the Lynchburg, Va., school founded by Jerry Falwell have
celebrated touchdowns by kneeling in the end zone briefly or genuflecting on the field and
pointing upward</B>. "This stadium is a public place. Why should you -- the NCAA -- tell me
where I need to pray?" said Rutigliano, a former National Football League coach. NIRR

Board of Psychology for Washington state ruled that M. Douglas Anderson committed an act
of "incompetence, negligence or malpractice" when he divulged personal views to his client,
who broke into tears at the comment. The board fined Anderson $1,500 and placed him on
probation for a year, during which time his practice will be monitored. He must attend
sessions on ethics. Anderson said he felt concealing his beliefs would harm his client, and
that he was being candid with his client rather than pressuring her. NIRR 9/18/95

<B>One of the largest Hindu temples outside India is being built near Austin, Texas</B>. Set on about
200 acres in Hays County, the ashram -- named Barsana Dham after an Indian city -- will
include guest rooms, preacher's offices, classrooms, and a $2.5 million, 35,000-square-foot
Shree Raseshwari Temple. It is intended as a place of pilgrimage for worshipers across the
country as well as a worship site for Austin's nearly 1,000 Hindu families. 
<BR><B>...The temple is being built to last 1,000 years, news reports said</B>. A 90-foot tower is designed
to withstand tornado-force winds and concrete walls were built using a process that increases
strength and minimizes cracking. Also planned is a 20,000-square-foot temple complex on 11
acres of donated land in the hills northwest of Austin.

<B>The FBI is investigating whether a Calvin Klein advertising campaign violated federal child
pornography laws</B>. The campaign featured young people posing suggestively in underwear.
Ads include a picture of a boy in a vest and underwear and another shows a girl with the
crotch of her panties showing, news reports said. Some ads were shot by photographer Steven
Meisel, who worked with Madonna on her explicit book Sex. At issue is whether the models
were juveniles and if the pictures constitute a violation of the law. A youth does not
necessarily have to be naked to constitute a violation of the child pornography law, courts
have ruled. Patrick Trueman, former head of the Justice Department's child pornography and
exploitation division who works for the American Family Association, asked the FBI to
investigate the ads.  
<BR><B>...Calvin Klein spokesmen said the campaign, which it discontinued, was misunderstood</B>. They
said the ads conveyed "a positive message" encouraging the "spirit, independence and inner
worth of today's young people." AFA head Donald Wildmon said the campaign was
"soft-core child pornography that promoted pedophilia." The New York Civil Liberties Union
accused federal officials of misusing the law for political purposes. NIRR 9/18/95

<B>The Lord's Prayer begins, "Our Father-Mother in heaven" in a new version of the Bible</B>. The
New Testament and Psalms: An Inclusive Version also reduces the number of references to
God as Lord and turns the Son of Man into "the Human One." John 3:16 becomes, "For God
so loved the world that God gave God's only Child, so that everyone who believes in that
Child may not perish, but may have eternal life." The version, produced over five years, says
children should "heed" their parents rather than "obey" them, and wives should "be committed
to" their husbands rather than "submit" to them. Because of racial overtones, darkness is no
longer equated with evil. Oxford University Press, a major producer of Bible translations,
published the inclusive version this month. 
<BR><B>...Critics charge that the editors censored the Bible to make it fit the political trends of the
day</B>. Susan Brooks Thistlethwaite of Chicago Theological Seminary, one of the editors, said
the translation is aimed at people "who are thoughtful about the way the Bible includes

Throckmorton of Bangor Theological Seminary, and Barbara Withers, an educator. NIRR

About 60 Christian ministries and church-related businesses display their services on Web

specialist for Roanoke, Va.-based Media Management. In addition, more than 200 "links" to
other Christian home pages have been established. 
<BR><B>...The site is a joint effort of Media Management and Religion Today, publisher of National

for non-Christians unfamiliar with religious materials. "This will open up information to
people who never knew it existed," Religion Today President Stephen Wike said. "It will help
the news media and other professional communicators understand the large role Christians
play." Groups such as Zondervan Publishing House, Prison Fellowship International, Sammy
Tippit Ministries, and Concerts of Prayer International are on GOSHEN, along with "the most

"A lot of ministries can't afford to be on the Net, but they can benefit from the exposure,"

<B>"Politics for us is a mission field, not a smoke-filled room," Christian Coalition Executive
Director Ralph Reed told members at the group's fifth annual Road to Victory conference</B>.
More than 4,000 state and local activists attended the opening session of the Sept. 8-9
conference in Washington, D.C. Christians have "gained a place at the table" of American
politics, but must be careful to remain servants and not power-brokers, he said. Reed passed
out a pledge card similar to one Martin Luther King Jr., used during his civil rights
campaigns. The pledge includes promises to remain nonviolent, pray for one's foes, meditate
on Christ's teachings, and seek reconciliation and justice. In a speech, presidential candidate
Phil Gramm (R-Texas) referred to the Second Coming of Christ: "There's only one person
good enough to impose His values on America, and when He comes back He's not going to
need the government."

<B>Most Americans do not support the Christian Coalition's "Contract With the American
Family," a poll commissioned by People for the American Way found</B>. The survey, conducted
by Peter D. Hart Research Associates, showed that more voters oppose the majority of the
contract than support it. Of the poll's 1,252 registered voters, a majority opposed a religious
equality amendment; was not in favor of a school voucher program; did not want to reduce
the government's role in public education; rejected abortion restrictions and favored public
funding of family planning organizations: opposed doing away with public assistance and
substituting private charity; and did not want a ban on government funding of the arts and
public broadcasting.  
<BR><B>...The poll is "designed to get high negatives," Christian Coalition spokesman Mike Russell
told NIRR</B>. Questions were phrased to identify contract items with the Christian Coalition, a
group many Americans still are unfamiliar with, Russell said. "It is well known among
pollsters that people will not support an agenda by a group they don't know anything about."
Most Americans support issues such as a religious equality amendment, but if it is seen as
part of an unfamiliar group's agenda, they will reject it, he said. NIRR 9/18/95

<B>New federal rules regulating telephone appeals for charitable donations will not affect most
organizations, The Chronicle of Philanthropy reported</B>. Nonprofits that do their telemarketing
in-house are exempt, as are telemarketing companies hired by charities, as long as they do not
offer gifts of substantial value in exchange for donations. The rules seek to crack down on
telemarketers who misrepresent themselves as charities and offer prizes or other items of
value in exchange for donations.  
<BR><B>...The new rules require telemarketers: to name the charity and the reason for the call before
"making a pitch" for donations; to clearly state a donation is not required to win prizes; to
give the odds of winning; to not misrepresent the "nonprofit, tax-exempt, or charitable status,
purpose, affiliation, or identity" of the company or organization; to not make misleading
statements about the deductibility of contributions; to limit calls to between 8 a.m</B>. and 9
p.m.; and to get written or taped permission from donors before automatically deducting
money from their accounts. The rules will allow fraudulent telemarketers to be prosecuted in
federal court. Telemarketing scams swindle Americans out of $40 billion a year, the

<B>A Michigan state legislator is attempting to reform the state's no-fault divorce law, syndicated
columnist Mike McManus said</B>. The law is so lenient "it is easier to divorce my wife of 26
years than to fire someone I hired one week ago," said Michigan Family Forum President
Randall Hekman, a former judge. Before no-fault laws, any spouse who wanted a divorce had
to prove the other was to blame through adultery or some form of destructive behavior.
No-fault divorce laws allow a marriage to be dissolved for almost any reason, even if only
one party wants a divorce. According to a study in Journal of Marriage and the Family, the
divorce rate has increased in 45 states since no-fault laws passed. In Michigan they increased
by 36%. Citing a connection between rising juvenile crime and the divorce rate since 1950,
state Rep. Jessie Dalman has proposed reforms. If one partner wants to reconcile, then the one
who wants a divorce will have to prove fault. Also, the law would give more power over the
division of assets to the partner who wants to reconcile. If there are children, the parents
would have to prove that the divorce is in their best interests. NIRR 9/18/95

<B>Boulder, Colo</B>. -- a center of the New Age movement -- is experiencing a Christian renewal.
Four years ago, many Boulder County pastors were frustrated, angry, and on the verge of
leaving town because Boulder seemed impervious to the Gospel. Nearly half of the county's
200 churches were experiencing serious divisions, pastors told NIRR. 
<BR><B>..."We had our backs to the wall," Cornell Haan, pastor of Harvest Baptist Church, told
NIRR</B>. Then God blessed Boulder's pastors through Eric Amagada, a Nigerian graduate
student, Haan said. Amagada befriended the pastors and their families, prayed with each of
them, began weekly pastors' prayer meetings, and "just loved them," Haan said.  
<BR><B>...The prayer meetings were "nothing short of fantastic" as the ministers unashamedly praised
God and prayed for revival, Haan said</B>. Over time, God transformed their anger into love, said
Mark Tidd, pastor of Crestview Christian Reformed Church. Pastors who had been "praying
as if Boulder was Sodom" began seeing the city as Nineveh -- more in need of compassion
and aid than condemnation, Tidd told NIRR. "God wasn't going to change the city until He
changed the heart of the pastors," he said. 
<BR><B>..."Then the Lord led pastors to do something I have not seen before," Haan said</B>. The
ministers dedicated themselves to serving the city, and formed a group called City Vision.
They introduced themselves to Boulder's leaders -- the mayor, city council members, county
commissioners, chief of police, county sheriff, superintendent of schools, and others. The
pastors approached them with the attitude of servants, offering to pray with them and help in
practical ways. Civic leaders were "shocked and delighted," Haan said.  
<BR><B>...The pastors' new outlook touched Judith Albino, president of Colorado University</B>.
Addressing a City Vision meeting, Albino began to cry. "It's your faces -- you're so kind,"
she said, acknowledging personal struggles. She has since returned to her Christian faith and
attends a Vineyard church, often sitting near Bill McCartney, the former CU football coach
and Promise Keepers founder, with whom she had clashed publicly.  
<BR><B>...The pastors have made good on their offers to serve</B>. They helped start a drop-in center for
teens, and a ranch for troubled youth is in the works. The Boulder Valley Human Resources
Coordinating Council invited Haan to help coordinate social services in the area. When he
arrived at his first meeting, the group stood and applauded. "The faith community has been
absent for 30 years," said Boulder County Sheriff George Epp, the group's chairman.
Christian leaders at CU also are beginning to serve the city the way City Vision's pastors do. 
<BR><B>...Boulder still is overwhelmingly cold to Christianity</B>. It is a hub of witchcraft and satanic
worship, site of the largest Buddhist temple in the country, and home to a multitude of
"isms." But the faith is "beginning to get a hearing" for the first time in decades, Tidd said.
People pose intellectual questions, and Christians must be ready to answer in a truthful and
frank manner, he said. Boulder Christians are reaching out to the "spiritually bruised and
confused," many of whom do not feel comfortable in straightlaced churches, he said.
Congregations are growing, as is Tidd's, which has more than doubled in four years. Pastors
are revitalized, and the Lord is moving, believers say. "If it can happen in Boulder, it can
happen anywhere," Tidd said.  NIRR 9/4/95

<B>Five thousand people have come to faith in Christ at a Pensacola, Fla., church since revival
broke out there June 18</B>. Congregants at Brownsville Assembly of God had looked forward to
a Father's Day lunch after Texas evangelist Stephen Hill preached during the Sunday morning
service. But God had other plans, assistant pastor Richard Crisco said. Instead of concluding
around noon, the service stretched until 4 p.m. as a spiritual renewal gripped congregants,
who flooded the altar. "We didn't take Daddy out to eat that day," Crisco told NIRR. 
<BR><B>...Another outpouring occurred during a 5 -hour service that evening</B>. Congregants urged Hill
to extend his visit several more days, and he began canceling appointments, including a trip
to Russia. Crowds swelled to 2,500 a night, five days a week. Worshipers came from a
spectrum of denominations, including Methodist, Baptist, Episcopal, Nazarene, Catholic, and
Church of Christ. Buses brought visitors from around the Southeast and other areas of the
United States. Some came from overseas. 
<BR><B>...About 116,000 people, including 35,000 first-time visitors, have attended the Brownsville
AG since Father's Day</B>. On average, more than 100 people become Christians each night,
Crisco said. Many converts came directly from local bars to attend the services, which usually
last until 2 a.m. The church, comprised mostly of upper-middle-class congregants, is near
pawn shops and used-car lots. Several nightclub actors, performers, and musicians reportedly
have come to Christ at the services and testified they quit performing at the bars. Prostitutes
and drunkards stand next to men in three-piece suits at the services, one woman said. "It's the
very poor next to the very well off, all looking for prayer together," she told NIRR. 
<BR><B>...William McCaskill, pastor of Covenant Presbyterian Church in Columbus, Miss., attended
the Aug</B>. 18 service. McCaskill, who also has visited the Toronto Vineyard Church (NIRR
8/7), told NIRR that manifestations of the Holy Spirit in the two places are similar, but there
have been "a lot more salvations" in Pensacola. McCaskill has questioned the validity of some
emotional behavior that occurs during such services, but believes that "this is a genuine work
of God." When people have been addicted to drugs or alcohol, or involved in pornography,
the "interaction of the Holy Spirit with the unholy" may produce "strange forms of
deliverance," he said. 
<BR><B>...Brownsville pastors urged visitors to "take the anointing back to their churches," said
Crisco</B>. He receives telephone calls almost daily from visitors reporting that the Spirit of God
is moving powerfully during services at their churches. In particular, local Methodist churches
"are going bananas," Crisco said. Linda Smith, youth director at Pine Forest United Methodist
Church, said she has "never seen such fast-forward spiritual growth" in her 27 years of
discipling young people. Many in her 55-member youth group who visited the services have
repented of various sins and have "become so sensitive to the Holy Spirit," she told NIRR.
"God is raising an army in our children's generation to do great exploits. NIRR 9/4/95

<B>Another "Miracle in Modesto" is happening -- this time, in Santa Maria, Calif</B>. (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/030695.html">NIRR 3/6</A>).
Visitors are flooding the stage to accept Jesus Christ as the evangelistic drama Heaven's
Gates and Hell's Flames (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/071095.html">NIRR 7/10</A>) is performed at First Assembly of God. More than 200
people a night -- some 25% of those who attend the play -- have come forward for salvation
since the play opened Aug. 20, organizers told NIRR. Entire families, as well as the teen-age
children of pastors, have come to Christ. The play graphically depicts heaven and hell. 
<BR><B>..."I have never seen anything grab a hold of an entire community the way this has," Ben
Ellsworth, the church's pastor, told NIRR</B>. Each night of the play -- staged four times a week
-- lines form outside two hours before it begins. "Everywhere you go in town, people are
talking about this event," he said. Thirty churches of various denominations are working
together to produce the play. "One of the biggest miracles was the cooperative spirit,"
Ellsworth said. 
<BR><B>...Several months of planning have gone into the follow-up of new Christians</B>. They are
directed back to their home churches -- or to another area church if one is not specified on
response cards. Discipleship is carried out by 1,000 follow-up workers in various churches,
trained in the months before the play began through the Discipleship Institute of nearby
Morro Bay, Calif. Organizers are unsure how long they will stage the drama. NIRR 9/4/95

<B>The number of churches in Boston has increased dramatically, according to Emmanuel Gospel
Center, a parachurch group in the city</B>. In 1993, EGC counted about 500 congregations in
Boston, a 50% increase in 25 years. That means there have been more new churches started
in that time than any other period in Boston's 365-year history, said Doug Hall, who directs
EGC. Growth is occurring mostly among evangelical Protestant churches while a number of
mainline churches are shrinking and closing. 
<BR><B>...Foreign immigration into Boston and personal evangelism by local churches spurred the
growth, much of which occurred among non-whites, EGC said</B>. The city is so diverse that
worship services are conducted in 34 languages. 
<BR><B>...In addition, members of churches planted in Boston in the last 25 years have started other
churches in New England and around the world, said Hall</B>. First-generation immigrants
"network with their homelands" to plant churches in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, he said. 
<B><BR>...Most Christians don't understand the potential of cities, said Hall, who has studied Boston
churches for 30 years</B>. They consider urban areas "heathen environments" impossible to crack
with the gospel. Yet resources and networking potential make cities "the greatest asset you
could ever imagine for missions." NIRR 9/4/95

<B>Inmates at Lewes Prison call chaplain David Powe "Sky Pilot" because he directs them to
heaven</B>. The first question Powe asks inmates after he learns their names is, "Do you want to
know God?" An Anglican vicar, Powe became chaplain of the 500 inmates at the East
Sussex, England, prison 15 months ago. Since that time, 315 have become Christians.  
<BR><B>...Powe "doesn't pussyfoot around," Peter Walker, executive director of Prison Fellowship of
England and Wales, told NIRR</B>. He is outgoing and dynamic and has set a goal for daily
conversions, Walker said. "It's a thief-on-the-cross ministry here -- if I don't give them the
opportunity to accept Christ now, I've lost them," Powe told Alpha magazine. Lewes is
similar to a county jail and prisoners do not stay long before being released or transferred to
long-term prisons. One reason God is using Lewes is because transferred inmates "take their
new faith with them" to other prisons, Walker said.     
<BR><B>...Powe is "reaping the benefits of 10 years of intercessory prayer," Walker said</B>. A local PF
group has met monthly since 1985 to pray for Lewes' prisoners, and once held a prayer walk
around the jail. Some 2,000 PF volunteers work with the chaplains in 125 of the country's
132 prisons.  
<BR><B>...At Exeter Prison, what appears to be a "sovereign move of the Holy Spirit" is taking place,
Walker said</B>. Prisoners are experiencing Toronto Blessing manifestations and are falling to
their knees in repentance during chapel. At one service, chaplain Bill Birdwood did not even
speak. He had just opened the order of service book when men began to pray and repent.  
<BR><B>...More than 200 Exeter inmates have become Christians in a year, Walker said</B>. Birdwood has
been chaplain for several years, but had "seen little fruit" until God touched him during a
service, telling him revival was coming, Walker said. Prison authorities say they have seen
marked improvement in individuals and the overall atmosphere at their prisons. NIRR 9/4/95

<B>Because of social and political changes, more Jews are becoming Christians in South Africa
than anywhere else in the world outside the former Soviet Union, according to Jews for Jesus</B>.
Some 310 Jews have converted since the group began its South African outreach in 1989. A
Messianic congregation in Johannesburg attracts 75 believers for its Friday night services.
Three hundred converts in five years may not seem like great success, but "it's all
hand-picked fruit -- one by one," JFJ's David Brickner told NIRR. "We don't see a Billy
Graham type of response." People don't convert by street witnessing, but through one-on-one
relationships and the influence of family members, he said. Other ministries and churches are
developing a heart for Jewish ministry, and are praying for and witnessing to the 110,000
Jews in the country, Barron said.  
<BR><B>...The "tremendous social, political, and cultural churning" that accompanied the end of
apartheid created an environment that shook people out of their complacency and
self-sufficiency, JFJ Director for South Africa Andrew Barron told NIRR</B>. "There was
tremendous spiritual ferment going on and people were being pursued by God, and He let us
participate in that." One accountant became a Christian after he was beaten for doing work
for a black organization. He and his family lived in fear until his daughter became a Christian
and proclaimed she was no longer afraid. Six months later, after the rest of his family
converted, Barron led the man to accept Christ. Some 2,000 Jews, about 1% of the Jewish
population in South Africa, are Christians, Brickner said. NIRR 9/4/95

<B>Amid the violence of war, evangelical churches are starting in Bosnia-Herzegovina, World
Relief reported</B>. In the eastern city of Tuzla, where more than 30,000 people have taken
refuge, an evangelical church is providing relief and baptizing new believers, Baptist minister
David Lively told NIRR. Ten believers were baptized over one weekend recently. In the eight
months since it began, 23 people have been baptized and 45 attend regularly. "That may not
seem like a lot in a city of 100,000," Lively told NIRR. "But on the other hand, we are
seeing a steady stream of people coming to know Jesus, where there were no (evangelical)
believers before." Many converts are the children of "mixed-marriages" between any of the
three ethnic groups that are fighting. "If Mom is a Serb and Dad is a Muslim, where do you
fit?" said Lively. An assistant pastor at Northside Baptist Church in Atlanta, Lively has
ministered to Muslims, Croats, and Serbs in the former Yugoslavia for the past three years
through Agape ministries, a Croatia-based relief and evangelistic group. Another church
founded by Agape operates in Mostar (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/061295.html">NIRR 6/12</A>). 
<BR><B>...The churches were launched by Nikola Skrinjaric, a Croat who has "a vision to plant
churches all through Bosnia-Herzegovina," Lively said</B>. Skrinjaric began by delivering relief
supplies to Mostar, then helping found the church there. When a political organization in
Tuzla asked him to establish an Agape relief center, he agreed on the condition that he also
could start a church. Skrinjaric now is trying to establish a relief center and a church in Bijac,
which had been besieged until last month. He will go everywhere "because God gave him a
vision to reach all these open ears," Lively said. NIRR 9/4/95

<B>Christians are developing farming techniques that help missionaries assist indigenous farmers</B>.
The American Scientific Affiliation, an organization dedicated to serving the church through
research science (NIRR 8/28/93), discussed such methods at its annual meeting July 22-25.
"We are trying to think creatively about the needs of Third World countries and how to meet
them," ASA President Donald Munro told NIRR. Projects include developing more effective
methods for farming in dry areas and researching natural insecticides from indigenous plants.
One participant, Martin Price, executive director of the Educational Concerns for World
Hunger Organization, told members about velvet beans, a plant developed by his organization.
Planted with corn, the beans grow over the stalk and kill weeds. When the bean dies, it
creates a mulch that makes good soil for future planting. "Missionaries say their yield has
been increased two to three times by using it," Munro said. NIRR 9/4/95

<B>The tough Ravendale section of Detroit -- 38 blocks scarred by crime, drugs, and abandoned
and burned-out houses -- found new hope when local minister Eddie Edwards helped organize
residents to reclaim the area</B>. He put together a 55-question survey seeking input on
community problems. The response was small at first, but Edwards persisted. At several
dinner meetings, residents discussed the survey results, natural leaders began to emerge, and a
feeling of neighborhood unity formed. Now, teams of volunteers clean up alleys and paint
houses. An Adopt-a-Block program unites suburban churches with individual blocks of the
city. Edwards founded and runs a summer camp to get children away from the influences of
the inner city. He also helped establish the Ravendale Program, which assists people in

food with money from his oil business, contributions from United Methodist groups, and gifts
from the Sanders' local congregation, Moody Memorial First UMC.

<BR><B>...Newly elected Presiding Bishop H</B>. George Anderson, 63, president of Luther College in

<B>Retired Episcopal Bishop Walter

five years ago when he was assistant bishop of the church's Newark, N.J., diocese under
Bishop John Spong (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/022095.html">NIRR 2/20</A>). Ten diocesan bishops brought the charge against Righter,
and last month, Episcopal bishops nationwide gave their approval for a trial to proceed.
Conservative bishops who brought the charge said they also will charge four other bishops. A

<B>United Methodist Church youth voted to ask the denomination to drop its policy that
homosexuality "is incompatible with Christian teaching." Delegates, ages 12-18, met in Salt
Lake City at the biennial legislative meeting of the National Youth Ministry Organization</B>.
They urged the church to state that, "We affirm that God's grace is available to all." The
resolution also calls on the church to allow ordination of "self-avowed practicing
homosexuals" and to end a ban on using church funds to promote the acceptance of
homosexuality. The proposal will be submitted to the UMC General Conference next year. NIRR 9/4/95

<B>Baptist churches in the former Yugoslavia have split along the same ethnic lines as the rest of
the country</B>. Once united in the Baptist Union of Yugoslavia, Baptist congregations now are
represented by three organizations: the Union of Baptists in Serbia, the Baptist Union of
Croatia, and the Union of Evangelical Christians-Baptists of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia. Meeting at the recent Baptist World Congress in Buenos Aires, Argentina (NIRR
8/21), representatives of the three groups discussed their differences. The war has strained
relationships and Baptists are on different sides of the ethnic and political problems created
by the conflict, Baptist Press reported. Croatian Christian publications were politically
"inflammatory and one-sided" at the outset of the war, charged Dane Vidovic and Dragisa
Armus, respectively of the Serb and Yugoslav Baptist unions. 
<BR><B>..."Our only hope is to emphasize the message of Jesus Christ</B>. Only this can unite us," Armus
said. The others agreed, mentioning that the mass of humanitarian work distracts from
spreading the gospel. Christian infrastructures are suffering and, although the refugees are
cared for, no one is preaching to them, Vidovic said. "If we had more resources for
evangelism like Bibles and Christian literature before the war broke out, then perhaps
Christians would have been able to prevent the war," Croatian leader Branco Lovrec said. NIRR 9/4/95

<B>The Navy will not discharge Lt</B>. Commdr. Kenneth Carkhuff for expressing his personal
opposition to the policy of women in combat (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/062695.html">NIRR 6/26</A>). Carkhuff, an Episcopalian,
believes the Bible teaches that women should not be subjected to the violence of combat.
Secretary of the Navy John Dalton approved the recommendation of Adm. Jeremy Boorda,
Chief of Naval Operations, to reject the findings of two three-person panels that called for
Carkhuff's separation from the military. Boorda cited Carkhuff's fair treatment of those in his
command and his "impeccable" record. Some 35 members of Congress urged Dalton to
reinstate Carkhuff, and the office of the Secretary of the Navy was "inundated with calls"
after his case was discussed on James Dobson's Focus on the Family radio show, Dobson
said. "All I can say is praise God," Carkhuff said. "I trusted in God and I feel vindicated."
Carkhuff, who commanded a helicopter squadron, said his military career may be cut short.
The incident remains on his record and will probably affect any future promotions and
combat assignments, he said. NIRR 9/4/95

receives government funding</B>. AIDSCAP, sponsored by the U.S. Agency for International
Development, trains voodoo leaders to give contraception instruction, according to the New
York Times News Service. "They are, to me, religious leaders, the same as Protestant
pastors," said Eddy Genece, head of the Haiti office of AIDSCAP. Since believers in voodoo
don't see sex outside marriage as wrong, they are free to teach the people to use condoms,
unlike the Catholic Church and most Protestant churches in the country. The program is
supposed to help halt the spread of AIDS. About 15,000 voodoo leaders have been trained so
far. Many of the priests claim they can treat AIDS-related diseases by using the pit of a fruit
to attract healing spirits. But some voodoo rituals, such as the practice of making small cuts
on a sick person's body, may spread the disease. Some Haitians believe AIDS can be spread
by giving someone "the evil eye." NIRR 9/4/95

<B>As the new school year begins, superintendents across the country are receiving a letter from
the U.S</B>. Department of Education attempting to clarify what religious activities are allowed in
public schools. The letter details ways students may express religious views while schools
steer clear of endorsing religious activity or doctrine. Some superintendents welcomed the
directive, while others called it confusing. The educators also are receiving a letter from The
Rutherford Institute detailing its description of student rights. The conservative-oriented civil
liberties group said the DOE directive "contains inaccurate and misleading statements about
court rulings." NIRR 9/4/95

<B>Moscow's largest Pentecostal church has suffered bomb threats, disruption of worship
services, and economic harassment over the last six months</B>. The 1,200-member Emmanuel
Church has had to cancel Sunday services on 10 separate occasions because of bomb threats,
and pastor Aleksandr Purshova said he receives daily phone calls warning him to leave
Moscow or die, according to News Network International. In addition, Purshova's office was
set on fire, and a car belonging to the ministry was sprayed with bullets. Recently, several
branch congregations of the church have been evicted by landlords who found tenants willing
to pay higher rents. In mid-July, the landlord of one church's offices and ministry space
raised the rent beyond the congregation's ability to pay. The church must evacuate the
premises, but has nowhere to go. Emmanuel has 11 daughter congregations, a Bible school,
and a theological college. 
<BR><B>...Purshova said he is convinced that the Russian Orthodox Church is responsible for the
attacks, although not on an official level</B>. Callers tell him that Russia is an Orthodox country
and that he is spreading an "American ideology," NNI reported. "Our faith is not from
America, but from God," Purshova said. NIRR 9/4/95

<B>Priests are murdered, churches riddled by gunfire, and bodies left in front of churches in the
Sicilian mafia's attempt to deter a handful of Catholic clergy who oppose them</B>. About a
dozen priests, mostly in Palermo, are preaching against the Cosa Nostra, organizing
demonstrations, and publishing anti-Mafia newsletters, news reports said. They also are trying
to provide alternatives to criminal life through education and greater economic opportunity.  
<BR><B>...The priests represent a threat to the criminal organization because they are "removing the
moral consensus of the people toward the Mafia," Jesuit priest Bartolemo Sorge said</B>. In a
country that long has accepted the ways of the mafioso, and where politicians, even clergy,
are associated with such activities, this is a dangerous enterprise. In 1993, Giuseppe Puglisi
was killed after he increased his anti-mafia preaching. Puglisi had been inspired by Pope John
Paul II's denunciation of the mafia. But instead of deterring other priests, Puglisi's murder
forced them to examine their consciences, and more began to speak, Cosimo Scordato, a local
rector, said.  
<BR><B>...Several of the priests travel with police escorts and at least one church is guarded by the
army</B>. A dead junkie was dumped across the street from one church, and another priest found
a bloody lamb's head on his doorstep with a note saying he would meet the same fate. But
the Church's efforts slowly are having an effect -- one ex-mafioso agreed to turn in a top
boss after hearing one of the priest's messages on television. NIRR 9/4/95

<B>Ohio became the first state to pass a law barring late-term abortions</B>. The law forbids
abortions after 21 weeks of gestation if the fetus can survive outside the mother's body. A
test to determine fetal viability would be required unless the abortion is necessary to save the
mother's life or preserve her physical health. The law bans D&X abortions, called
partial-birth abortions (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/062695.html">NIRR 6/26</A>), in which the doctor removes the baby's body from the
womb feet-first and uses a suction device in the brain. Violation of the law is punishable by
five years in prison and a $2,500 fine. The doctor also could be liable in a civil suit. NIRR 9/4/95

<B>A group trying to bridge differences between people on different sides of the abortion debate
is promoting adoption as an alternative</B>. The Common Ground Network for Life and Choice
(NIRR 4/4/94), a loose-knit group organized in 1992, is active in about 20 cities. The network
is urging governments to encourage wider acceptance of adoption and shift some family
planning funding to programs that focus on adoption. The group also urged that the
foster-care system be streamlined so children can be placed in permanent homes more
quickly. Common Ground organizers are Andrew Puzder, who wrote Missouri's restrictions
on abortion, and B.J. Isaacson-Jones, former executive director of a St. Louis family-planning
clinic that sued to overturn the restrictions. In 1989, the suit resulted in the Webster v.
Reproductive Health Services decision, in which the high court allowed states to place
restrictions on abortion. NIRR 9/4/95

<B>Kneeling, praying, and holding hands, five Baptist missionaries prepared to die in a
wild-game park in Tanzania (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/082195.html">NIRR 8/21</A>)</B>. "I thought I was holding my wife's hand for the
last time," David Moreland told Baptist Press. A Bible verse from the book of Romans ran
through Sandy Harrington's head: "Nothing can separate us from the love of Christ -- not
even death." Ten-year-old Joanna Giddens said: "I wasn't scared
<BR><B>...because I knew that with God everything would be all right." As their kidnappers argued
whether to shoot them together or separately, the missionaries began to pray out loud</B>. 
<BR><B>..."Are you a padre?" a gunman asked Moreland</B>. When he replied that he was a Southern
Baptist missionary, the men ordered them to lie on a blanket and drink an orange liquid.
Moreland "felt like shouting" for joy upon seeing the juice, knowing that sometimes
kidnappers drug people instead of killing them, he said. Surviving the night without attack
from wild animals that roam the park, the missionaries awoke 18 hours later to the sound of
the search plane that rescued them. Harrington said, "We could be dead -- and God still
would be great, but He intervened, and I'm very grateful to Him." NIRR 9/4/95

<B>Archbishop Geron Iakovos, 84, who has led the Greek Orthodox Church in the Western
Hemisphere since 1959, will retire next July, church officials said</B>. The former president of
the World Council of Churches was an early supporter of the civil rights movement and has
worked for Christian unity. In 1959, Iakovos became the first Greek Orthodox emissary in
more than 400 years to meet with a Roman Catholic pope, John XXIII.
<P>
<B>Episcopal Bishop Clarence Pope has reversed his conversion to Catholicism (NIRR 11/14/94)</B>.
Less than a year ago, Pope became the first Episcopal bishop in a century to become a
Catholic. The retired Fort Worth, Texas, bishop left the Episcopal Church over his opposition
to the ordination of women. He reconverted partly because of a requirement that he be
reordained as a Catholic priest. Pope said that would mean rejecting his previous ordination.

<B>The Christian Coalition, made up mostly of Protestants, is forming a branch especially for
Catholics</B>. News reports said the Catholic Alliance will have a separate membership and
chapters in all 50 states, but will work with the coalition's state chapters on common
concerns. Regent University did not violate the contracts of three professors, a Virginia court
ruled. The judge declared the contracts did not constitute tenure and that the school had the
right to dismiss faculty regardless of reason. Regent, founded by Pat Robertson, did have the
obligation to compensate the faculty for the remainder of their three-year contracts.   A
California church gives its members a list of secular and religious leaders to pray for each
week. The Church on the Way, in Van Nuys, distributes Prayer, Praise and People Report
during its midweek service, the magazine Ministries Today said. The church sends copies of
the prayer guide each week to the leaders who are being prayed for. Many of them, including
Ted Turner, Dan Rather, and Ted Koppel, have written to express their thanks.

<B>Ministries that lost money in the Foundation for New Era Philanthropy scandal (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/072495.html">NIRR 7/24</A>)
are mistaken to focus donor attention on the situation since most donors are oblivious of it,
pollster George Barna said</B>. A survey by the Barna Research Group found only 18% of donors
knew anything about the situation. Spending "inordinate amounts" of time and money
discussing New Era "is likely to increase donor skepticism unnecessarily," Barna said.

Sherwin expressing sorrow over the attack and enclosed a check to defray cleaning expenses.
The church also offered support in the event of future incidents. The church's response "far

<B>Angola: Elias Augosto, a deacon and security guard for the Baptist Mission, knows the
biblical principle of "watch and pray," according to Baptist Press</B>. Because people in the city
of Luanda know missionaries have cars, food, and clothing, Augosto stands guard at night
with an AK-47 in one hand and a Bible in the other. He assumed the post in 1993 after gangs
looted one missionary's home and attacked another, attempting to shoot the lock off. Once,
when Augosto caught four men attempting to break into the compound, he shot above their
heads and all around them until they fled. "I didn't want to defile the compound by spilling
any blood," he said.

<B>Burundi: The Catholic Bishops of Burundi condemned warlords who recruit and arm
teen-agers to terrorize rival ethnic groups, news reports said</B>. "The search for power, the spirit

<B>Morocco: Four Christians who were tried last month for proselytizing have been released</B>.
One, Mehdi Ksara, 88, is a citizen of the United States and Morocco.  His arrest and
imprisonment gained international attention because of his age and the conditions he was held
in, Baptist Press said. Although Moroccan law forbids detention of anyone over 75 years old,
Ksara, who is in poor health, was kept in a cramped prison. Sources disagreed whether the
case signals a new tolerance or a crackdown on religious freedom.   
<P>
<B>South Africa: Religious and conservative groups condemned proposed legislation legalizing
abortion on demand during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy</B>. Current law allows for abortion
only if the woman proves she was the victim of rape or incest, if the fetus is deformed, or if
giving birth threatens the mother's physical or emotional health. The law would result in a
clash between the African National Congress, which officially supports abortion rights, and
the strong conservative community in South Africa, news reports said. The ANC, which
downplayed the issue during last year's elections, could split over the issue.

<B>Israel: Ten Jews were arrested and escorted from the Temple Mount, a holy shrine for Jews

illegal for Jews to pray at the site. About 20 Palestinians began scuffling and throwing stones
at them. The Jews are members of Chai V'Kayam, a group that wants to expel all Arabs from
Israel and the occupied territories. The group periodically attempts to pray at the Temple
Mount.

<B>Philippines: Legislators called for a ban on the American heavy-metal group Slayer, saying its

<B>South Korea: Some 22,400 female babies are aborted every year, the Union of Catholic Asian

the "culture of death."

<B>Thailand: Prime Minister Banharn Silparcha puts his faith in astrology and fortune-tellers,
adjusting appointments and scheduling to coincide with astrologers' advice</B>. Upon his
appointment as prime minister, Silparcha made a motorcade circle his house once because it
came earlier than the "auspicious time," according to news reports. At his first cabinet
meeting, Silparcha kept the ministers waiting for two hours so he would enter the building at
the most "auspicious time." He also had a carved elephant removed from a lounge in the

49-year-old law requiring crucifixes to be hung in school classrooms. The practice also is
guaranteed by an agreement between Austria and the Vatican, news reports said. Scholars say
the law may be reversed because religious neutrality is guaranteed in the constitution.

<B>England: Driving under the influence of the Holy Spirit can be hazardous to your health, a

<B>England: After allegations of sexual misconduct, an Anglican priest has been barred from
preaching, news reports said</B>. Chris Brain, a rock 'n' roll manager who became an evangelical

an unorthodox group in Sheffield, incorporated rock music and videos in his ministry. The
allegations came out after the evangelical group was brought under diocesan control.
<P>
<B>England: Restrictions on doing business on Sundays have been loosened over the past year</B>.
Traditionally days of rest for British workers, Sundays are becoming just another day of

<B>Russia: Moscow's Cathedral of Christ Our Savior held services for the first time in 64 years
last month</B>. The cathedral, once the spiritual center of the Russian Orthodox Church and the
largest church in the country, was ordered destroyed by Josef Stalin in 1931. Still under
reconstruction, it is a symbol of Russia's rebirth, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said. Some
believe the site is cursed because a convent was destroyed to build the cathedral in 1837.
Others criticize the cost of rebuilding the church, estimated at $250 million, while the Russian
economy is struggling to recover from communism, news reports said.

<B>As the strength of drug cartels declines in Colombia, the evangelical church grows stronger</B>.
Avarice aroused by monstrous drug profits had "dismembered all of society," Bogota pastor
Howard Biddulph told NIRR. But problems of immorality and corruption, combined with
insecurity caused by bloody narco-wars between police and cartel members, have "opened the
filters and made it easy to evangelize," he said. 
<BR><B>...Evangelicals represent 4% of the 6 million population in the mostly Roman Catholic
country</B>. But their numbers have grown substantially in recent years, Nick Woodberry of
Christ for the Cities said. A turning point was 1991, when a new constitution removed the
Catholic Church's official status and guaranteed religious freedom for everyone. 
<BR><B>...Several countrywide evangelical initiatives are under way</B>. Luz Y Vida -- "Light and Life"
-- is house-to-house evangelism and discipleship sponsored by The Bible League, which
merged with World Crusades, Inc., of Colombia last year (NIRR 1/24/94). In five months this
year, 320,000 Scripture portions were distributed and 21,000 people made commitments to
Christ, TBL said. 
<BR><B>...The National Plan of Evangelization '95, an initiative of Latin American Ministries' Christ
for the Cities, works regionally</B>. In July, 45 pastors and 12 regional coordinators conducted
simultaneous evangelistic campaigns. 
<BR><B>...The CFC campaign stems from the work of evangelical churches in Medellin</B>. For
two-and-a-half years, evangelical Christians there have conducted house-to-house evangelism
and targeting the city with all-night prayer meetings. On the nights they pray, the number of
murders in the city declines, one pastor told Woodberry. The number of evangelical
Christians and churches in Medellin has doubled in the past nine years, Woodberry told
NIRR. 
<BR><B>...The change in Medellin began when the assassination of a presidential candidate in 1989 by
a drug cartel sparked a "semi-civil war" between the government and narcotics dealers, said
Woodberry, who spent eight years in Medellin</B>. People became more open to the gospel
because of fear and insecurity. 
<BR><B>...Colombia, one of the most violent countries in the world, has been ruled by drug cartels
since the early 1980's</B>. But fear of violence is not the only reason for evangelical church
growth; people are seeking spiritual answers. "There is a genuine interest among people to
discover what the Bible is teaching -- everyone is not afraid of getting shot," Bible League
Director of Latin American Ministries Edward Meyer told NIRR. NIRR 08/21/95

<B>Christian hostels in Thailand are saving tribal girls from becoming Bangkok prostitutes</B>. New
Horizon Hostel, in the northern city of Chiang Ri, helps girls from poor families, which may
be tempted to sell them. The girls are easy prey to pimps who promise them they'll get rich
or will have jobs as nannies or teachers. Bangkok, the "sin capital of Asia," has 700,000
female prostitutes, Operation World said. 
<BR><B>..."We beat them to the punch," New Horizon spokesman Don Rutland told NIRR</B>. The
Orange City, Fla.-based ministry has a "cadre of Christians" under its national director, an
Akha tribesman. When ministry workers realize a family is destitute, they persuade them to
let their daughter stay at the hostel. Food, clothing, and education, which are supplied free,
cost the ministry $50-$75 a month per child. Many of the girls leave after high school to take
jobs as seamstresses or mechanics, and some attend college, Rutland said. All the girls have
become Christians at some point, he said. One, whose father is the village witch doctor, wants
to bring the gospel to her village, he said. NIRR 08/21/95

<B>Some 220,000 Baptist youths worldwide have pledged to remain sexually pure until marriage</B>.
The True Love Waits pledge cards were on display at the 17th Baptist World Congress, held

for the True Love Waits Campaign in America, said events are being sponsored all over the
world to encourage teens and young adults to remain chaste.  
<BR><B>...Most of the pledges were collected at a True Love Waits rally in July 1994 in Washington,
D.C</B>. (NIRR 8/8/94). About 10,000 youth in Cameroon, Angola, Uganda, Nigeria, Philippines,
Jamaica, Slovakia, Hong Kong, Romania, Germany, Canada, Argentina, Chile, and Cuba also
made pledges in the last year, Ross said. In Cuba, 2,000 youth made the commitment.

Fanini said. Baptists should work together in their countries and coordinate worldwide, even

<B>Some 500 volunteers from the United States participated in the Greater Nairobi Evangelistic

Kenya and the Southern Baptist Convention. Kenyan Baptists and the Baptist Mission, a
group of SBC missionaries in the country, invited the volunteers, who worked in two-week
stints, training and assisting pastors and lay people in evangelization and discipleship. 
<BR><B>...At least 11,000 Kenyans prayed to receive Christ from among 136,000 people who attended
crusades in 12 areas of the capital, partial figures show</B>. Jim Hooten of the SBC Foreign

Uhuru Park, where President Daniel Arap Moi, an evangelical Christian, addressed the crowd
before the service (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/051595.html">NIRR 5/15</A>). Moi also hosted a two-hour prayer and worship meeting for

<B>A filmed interview with Texas death-row inmate Stephen Nethery is having far-reaching
effects</B>. Nethery gave a dramatic, intense testimony May 25, just 37 hours before he received
a lethal injection for murdering a Dallas police officer in 1981. In the interview, Nethery
discussed his faith in Christ, which he gained shortly after his incarceration and developed
during 13 years on death row. Nethery, 32, had spent his time on death row developing "an
intimate relationship between himself and his Lord," Rosser McDonald, a Baptist Radio and
Television Commission producer, told NIRR. McDonald, who met Nethery during a 1990
interview, also conducted the final interview with him. Nethery did not ask God to deliver
him from the death penalty, but "prayed for God to use him, and for whatever time period he
wanted," McDonald told Baptist Press. The interview became a 30-minute television special
called Rejoice Evermore, which aired on ACTS and FamilyNet, the cable and broadcast
television services operated by the Southern Baptist Convention.  
<BR><B>...Prison ministries in Florida, Louisiana, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio, North
Carolina, Texas, and Virginia have used the video version of the interview to reach prisoners
and young people for Christ</B>. Recently, an evangelical group in Germany received permission
from the Southern Baptists to translate McDonald's film so it can appear on German
television. 
<BR><B>...Prisoner reaction to Nethery's testimony has been phenomenal, said Jerry Spicer, who runs
a prison ministry based in Altamonte Springs, Fla</B>. When Spicer shows the video in prisons,
he doesn't even have time to preach. "After seeing the video, guys would be on their knees
crying and giving their hearts to Christ." Nethery "comes across as honest and sincere," and
as coping well because of his relationship with Christ, Spicer said.

<B>Charles Colson, a long-time opponent of capital punishment, has changed his mind</B>. Colson,
who has stated there is no evidence that execution is a deterrent, now believes there are
instances when it is the "only possible punishment," he told Religion News Service. Had
Colson been the judge, he probably would have sentenced to death Susan Smith, convicted of
drowning her two children in a South Carolina lake. "No one is secure when your own parent
would kill you," said the founder of Prison Fellowship, a Christian group that helps prisoners,
ex-prisoners, and their families. The group's national and international boards of directors
have not taken a position on capital punishment because they have not reached a consensus. 
<BR><B>...During Prison Fellowship's International Convocation Aug</B>. 7-13 in Washington, D.C.,
speakers voiced strong opinions for and against the death penalty. The convocation involved
800 delegates and guests from 69 countries, including ex-prisoners, prison chaplains,
corrections officials, clergymen from a number of church traditions, and prison volunteers.

<B>Russ Ford and Joe Vought minister to prisoners waiting to die</B>. Ford, a Southern Baptist
pastor, and Vought, an Evangelical Lutheran Church in America pastor, drive 100 miles from
Richmond, Va., to Mecklenburg Correctional Center one day each month to visit inmates on
death row. The pastors crouch at the portholes of cell doors so they can see each man and
grasp his hand while they talk. "Sometimes the porthole is a confessional," but other times the
men just need to laugh or hear the status of their cases, Vought told NIRR. Most of the 54
condemned men are poor, and some are mentally ill. Death row is "society's garbage heap,"
he said. Ford and Vought often become close friends with the condemned men -- and pay a
personal price in doing so. Ford suffered flashbacks and stress for two months after he first
watched an execution.  
<BR><B>...Although many death row inmates are lost and confused, some have transformed their lives</B>.
Amid the despondency and death -- Vought and Ford have witnessed numerous executions -are many success stories. In the last five years, 13 of the 16 men executed in Virginia came
to salvation in Christ before their deaths, Ford told NIRR. For the first few years of his
20-year involvement with prisoners, Ford's approach was purely clinical and unspiritual,
which he attributes to liberal educational training. But "after five years and six men dying
miserably, thank God He allowed me to wake up," Ford said. 
<BR><B>...Vought and Ford also reach out to victims' families through Gateway Parish, Inc., a group
they started a year ago</B>. Little spiritual help is available for victims and families touched by
violent crime, Vought said. Victims feel "a seething rage and despair" that needs to be dealt
with, he said. 
<BR><B>...More Christians are needed to "visit those who sit in the shadow of death" and bring a
message of hope to forlorn people, Vought said</B>. NIRR 08/21/95

<B>Messianic Jews in Brooklyn face opposition from "countermissionary" Jewish groups</B>. The
groups are waging a tug-of-war over the 60,000 former Soviet Jews flooding the New York
City borough. Because religion was suppressed for 70 years under communism, the
immigrants often are strangers to Judaism and vulnerable to theological persuasion, news
reports said. 
<BR><B>...Concerts of Russian music, Sabbath dinners, or free English classes are sponsored by the
Messianic Christian groups</B>. But Jewish "counterprograms" warn the immigrants about
evangelistic Christian activity. When Messianic Jews try to approach the immigrants on the
street, Orthodox Jews sometimes surround the Christians to prevent them from passing out
literature. In one case, 400 Orthodox Jews tried to shout down Passover services led by
messianic Chosen People Ministries, according to Stewart Weinisch, the group's area director.

<B>Congressional hearings into the 81 deaths at the Branch Davidian compound near Waco,

<BR><B>..."The FBI was paying lip service" to the advice of religious experts during the 51-day siege
of the compound in 1993, J</B>. Philip Arnold of the Houston-based Reunion Institute told The
Associated Press. There was little effort by law enforcement officials to learn about the
Branch Davidians' religious beliefs, Arnold said. "Such an attempt could have saved lives, but
I'm not sure the government has learned that lesson," he said. Justice Department spokesman
Carl Stern called the criticism incorrect. Stern cited the FBI's creation of a "critical incident
response" unit, which trains agents in hostage negotiations and teaches methods for dealing

<B>A United Methodist minister is not self-employed, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled,
upholding a tax court decision (NIRR 10/3/94)</B>. The case involved Michael Weber, pastor of
five UMC churches in the Stonewall, N.C., area. The ruling may prompt some clergy to fill
out Schedule A, the tax form for employees, rather than Schedule C, used by those who are
self-employed -- which could affect the amount of taxes they must pay, church officials said.
Clergy still are classified as self-employed for Social Security and Medicare taxes, and thus
are exempt from withholding requirements, although they may participate voluntarily, a UMC
official said. The case's effect on other denominations is uncertain, observers said. NIRR

government during World War II, church leaders said</B>. Christian churches participated in
emperor worship and extreme nationalism, collected money to build fighter planes, and kept
silent about atrocities against prisoners of war, representatives from Catholic, evangelical, and
mainline churches said.

<B>Charles Stanley will relinquish his administrative duties at the 14,000-member First Baptist
Church of Atlanta in a dispute over his pending divorce</B>. Stanley will remain in the pulpit for
now, but told the church he will resign if "my wife divorces me," news reports said. Stanley,
62, and his wife of 40 years, Anna, have been separated since 1992. She filed for divorce in
1993, later sought a legal separation, but refiled for divorce in March, saying attempts at
reconciliation failed. "I'm trusting God to put this back together," the pastor said. 
<BR><B>...Stanley's son Andy resigned as pastor of the church's northside congregation in Dunwoody

they would lose membership if they did not make good on pledges by July 30. Members
deleted from the church rolls still can worship at the church but cannot vote at meetings, the
church said. Ronnie Northam, the pastor, and Delbert Smith, chairman of the deacon board,
said the church is in good financial shape. People who cannot afford to pay what is owed can
get a clean slate by talking to a deacon about their problems.

<B>Canada: The 200,000-member Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada disavowed the
anti-semitic writings of Martin Luther</B>. The  church must "acknowledge with pain the
anti-Judaic diatribes" of its founder's later writings, a resolution adopted at the

<B>Tanzania: Bandits kidnapped Southern Baptist missionaries near Mikumi National Park
outside Morogoro</B>. Three men with guns approached the group during a rest stop. Bill
Harrington of Richmond, Va., had stepped away from the car and saw the men beating David
Moreland of Monroe, La., and forcing the others into the car. After chasing them, Harrington
returned to Iringa and notified the police, who began an intensive search. Moreland, his wife,
Mildred; Harrington's daughter, Christine; and Joanna Giddens, the daughter of SBC

Four man-made caves were discovered last year, but the secret was kept to prevent them from

the ruling. 
<P>
<B>Pakistan: At the request of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, female lawmakers from 35 Islamic
countries gathered in Islamabad</B>. The 120 delegates affirmed their belief that Islam teaches
sexual equality and religious tolerance. They blamed discrimination against women on archaic
traditions and ignorance. The lawmakers vowed to counter Islamic terrorism, help oppressed
women, and promote tolerance among faiths. Representatives included women from secular
Turkey and Egypt as well as from fundamentalist Sudan and Iran. It is easier to "work
through women to unite the Muslim world than through men," a delegate said.

<B>Ten thousand charismatics and Pentecostals prayed, sang, danced, clapped, and cheered under
the common bond of the Holy Spirit during a four-day ecumenical convention last month</B>.
About half of the participants at the Congress on the Holy Spirit and World Evangelization,
held July 26-29 in Orlando, were Catholics; the rest came from a spectrum of mainline
Protestant, classical Pentecostal, and nondenominational churches. The congress included
keynote sessions and more than 100 workshops. Among the many speakers were broadcasters
Pat Robertson and Paul Crouch; Raniero Cantalamessa, a Catholic priest who often preaches
at the Vatican; Church of God in Christ Bishop Gilbert Patterson; healing evangelist Benny
Hinn; COGIC Bishop Ithiel Clemmons; Assemblies of God General Superintendent Thomas
Trask; and Episcopal Bishop John Howe. It was the fourth such rally in the last 18 years. 
<BR><B>...The Holy Spirit wants to break down walls between Catholics and Protestants, said Vinson
Synan, Regent University's theology dean who chaired the congress</B>. The Holy Spirit
empowers Christians to trust each other despite their differences, he said. According to
conference speaker Jack Hayford, pastor of the Church on the Way in Van Nuys, Calif., such
relationships can form without a "meltdown of ideologies." It is the nature of the Holy Spirit
"to blend and to bond without sacrificing uniqueness and individuality," he said. 
<BR><B>..."There will always be ecumenical problems," Synan told NIRR</B>. "We're all out trying to win
people to the Lord and we bump into each other. I'm willing to cope with the problems of
growth." A statement issued by conference organizers acknowledged that churches,
denominations, and ministries should aspire to address their "real differences" in matters of
doctrine "in a spirit of brotherly love and mutual understanding."  
<BR><B>...The numbers of spirit-filled converts are growing rapidly in the Third World</B>. Synan,
quoting missions researcher David Barrett, said the Pentecostal/charismatic movement adds
54,800 adherents a day. It comprises 25% of the world's Christians, 460 million people,
including 100 million Catholic charismatics. A highlight of the conference was a conga
procession through the aisles by Haitian Catholic charismatics. "The Haitians just set that
place on fire. The joy and exuberance was overwhelming," Synan said. 
<BR><B>...Leaders called for a continued push toward world evangelism</B>. Then, Synan said, "we'll get
together again at the end of the decade for the biggest birthday party in history" celebrating
the year 2000 and the centennial of the modern Pentecostal movement. NIRR 08/07/95

<B>Tribespeople are converting in North India, missionaries say</B>. After speaking to several
missionaries and other ministries in India, John Gilman, president of the Virginia Beach,
Va.-based Dayspring International, a missions agency, told NIRR: 
<BR><B>...In the Katihar district of Bihar, 150 people, mostly former Muslims, were baptized in one
village</B>. 
<BR><B>...In Punjab, hundreds of Sikhs became Christians as the result of "much prayer and faithful
witnessing" from local independent churches, the Arpana Prayer Network, a local ministry,
told Gilman</B>. Violence and terrorism in the region is creating an openness to the gospel,
according to Arpana. 
<BR><B>...In Rajastahn, 95 Bhalai people were converted by an indigenous ministry</B>. 
<BR><B>...In the Southern state of Kerala, Catholic charismatics are ministering to thousands of people
(<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/071095.html">NIRR 7/10</A>)</B>. At a center in Athirampuzha, hundreds of people from all religions come for
services. In Muringoor, the Divine Word Center attracts 10,000-15,000 people for weeklong
programs, the Union of Catholic Asian News reported.  
<BR><B>..."There has been real evidence on many fronts that the harvest is ripe in India," Don Atkin
of Resurrection Churches and Ministries, who trains church planters, told NIRR</B>. Several
churches in Southern India have been started through the Pennsylvania-based organization.

<B>The Chinese city of Kaifeng will celebrate the Jewish Feast of the Tabernacles with
Messianic evangelist Sid Roth</B>. Local government leaders are helping sponsor the October
festival, Roth told NIRR. He visited the southern city because thousands of Chinese with a
Jewish heritage live there. Some 700 heads of families have Jewish last names, he said.
During lunch with the Communist Party leader of Kaifeng, Roth proposed the idea of having
a festival to "celebrate the relationship between China and Israel." The idea "had to have been
God's" because he offered it without even thinking about it, Roth said. 
<BR><B>...The festival of Jewish singing and dancing will be held at three sites, including an outdoor
park, during the city's annual Chrysanthemum Festival, which attracts thousands of people
from around the country</B>. Roth will speak at each event, explaining the significance of the
Feast of the Tabernacles "past, present, and future," he said. The celebration commemorates
God's care and protection of the Israelites during their trek in the desert. Although Roth
preaches to all people, his ministry, Brunswick, Ga.-based Messianic Vision, follows the
principle that converting the Jews opens the door for reaching others. NIRR 08/07/95
<P>
<B>Canadian evangelicals are committed to outreach, but need better follow-through, according to
EvangelTrends, a report issued by Vision 2000 Canada</B>. The group surveyed 1,214 church
leaders and ministers, about half the number that attended its eight evangelism consultations
across Canada last year (NIRR 5/1/95). The study found that, while growth is evident,
churches "have to do better," sociologist Reginald Bibby said. Some 80% of respondents said
their churches are "attempting to evangelize," but only 68% said they have a plan for
evangelism, and only about 45% have budgets for those plans. Other findings show that
almost 40% of the leaders don't believe their churches are sensitive to their communities'
needs. About 37% said the number of people converted by their church in 1994 totaled five
or fewer. Bibby said it is disturbing that a large percentage of the churches' new members are
not necessarily new converts. About 90% transferred from other churches or are children of
members. The results present a "hard reality" that must be addressed, Vision 2000 Executive
Director Don Moore said. 
<BR><B>...Religious belief among Canadians is declining overall, the Princeton Religious Research
Center reported</B>. Belief in God slipped from 87% in 1985 to just 70% in 1995, and belief in
heaven fell from 71% to 61%, according to a Gallup poll of 1,004 adults in March.
Furthermore, 33% of Canadians say religion is very important in their lives, while 31% rate it
not very important. In the United States, those numbers are 58% and 12%, respectively.

<B>Hundreds of Campus Crusade for Christ staff workers publicly repented of personal sins
during the group's biennial national staff leadership meeting in Fort Collins, Colo., July
20-26</B>. The phenomenon of people lining up at microphones to confess their sins was
reminiscent of events that occurred among students on numerous college campuses this spring
(<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/071095.html">NIRR 7/10</A>). The Fort Collins meeting was the most significant in the 50 years of his
ministry, Bill Bright, founder of Campus Crusade, said in a radio interview on the Moody
Broadcasting Network.  
<BR><B>...After Nancy Leigh DeMoss of Life Action Ministries urged broken- heartedness over sin,
many of the 3,800 people in Moby Arena at Colorado State University came forward to
repent</B>. The confessions by Campus Crusade workers, who counsel college students across the
country, lasted 13 hours on July 24 and six hours the next day. After each disclosure, 15-30
people walked -- and in some cases ran -- to pray for the person who had spoken. A number
of sins were described, including bitterness, an observer said. The gymnasium became a
virtual sanctuary as those still seated in the stands prayed quietly while the numerous
revelations continued. The pattern recurred the next day after Southern Baptist leader Henry
Blackaby spoke, emphasizing confession and repentance. 
<BR><B>...The outpouring postponed scheduled events at the conference</B>. Speeches and workshops
finally resumed Wednesday afternoon, followed by a three-hour celebration and worship
service to end the conference. Many Campus Crusade staffers had prayed and fasted over the
last year in preparation for the meeting. After it ended, participants said they felt emotionally
drained but joyous because they knew they had encountered God. NIRR 08/07/95

<B>Encouraging women to foster vital relationships in Christ is the goal of Morristown,
Tenn.-based Renaissance Ministries</B>. Five conferences in the spring of 1995 will focus on
women's godly roles and how they can fulfill them, founder and President Deborah Tyler told
NIRR. A graduate of Moody Bible Institute and a church lay leader, Tyler expects the
conferences to "provide a springboard...for God's Spirit" to change women's lives.  
<BR><B>...Renaissance is similar in concept to Promise Keepers (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/061295.html">NIRR 6/12</A>) but the two are not
connected, she said</B>. Renaissance's Keys for Abundant Living conferences are designed for
smaller audiences. "Women don't herd like men," Tyler said. "You can't pack 70,000 of them
into a stadium." Yet, many men who have attended Promise Keepers, and their wives, have
expressed a desire for a similar ministry for women, she said. Tyler hopes each conference
will attract about 2,000 women to hear speakers such as Luci Swindoll, Ann Graham Lotz,
and Gloria Gaither. Small-group ministry sessions will focus on topics such as effective
parenting and stress management. 
<BR><B>...The 1995 conferences are scheduled for Birmingham, Ala.; Little Rock, Ark.; Dallas, Texas;
and Nashville, Tenn</B>. In addition, a one-day Saturday conference will be held in Greenville,

<B>Thousands of evangelicals in the United Kingdom gather annually for a Christian vacation</B>.
Spring Harvest allows believers from all denominations to "get away from their local
churches and get teaching, worship, and holiday facilities," spokesperson Jeremy Wheightman
told NIRR. A national chain of camps rents the sites to Spring Harvest for four weeks every
year. Groups of participants enjoy six days of teaching and worship, then leave to make room
for the next group, he said. Founded in 1979 by Clive Calver of the Britain Evangelical
Alliance and other evangelical leaders, the first Spring Harvest attracted 3,000 people. 
<BR><B>...This year's events were held at two campsites in England and one in Scotland; some 70,000
people attended</B>. Morning teaching sessions offer everything from "deep theology to practical
Christian living," while evening celebrations feature well-known speakers and an extended
time of worship, Wheightman said. Speakers have included Harvest Evangelism's Ed Silvoso,
evangelist Luis Palau, and former Youth With A Mission Executive Director Floyd McClung.
<BR><B>..."Believers are experiencing a new awareness of what worship means" and a new intimacy
in worship at the event, Wheightman said</B>. The spirit of Spring Harvest is captured in the
modern music, which includes guitars and drums, he said. This is a radical departure from
traditional worship styles, a trend reflected in the church as a whole, Britain Evangelical
Alliance spokesman Keith Ewing told NIRR. "There is a worship revolution in terms of
music." NIRR 08/07/95

<B>Jews for Jesus handed out more than 1 million gospel tracts on the streets of New York City
during the group's 1995 Summertime Witnessing Program in July</B>. Some 516 people, more

local New York ministries and churches will contact gentiles. In a similar campaign in

<B>Relief agencies are scrambling to meet the needs of refugees from United Nations "safe
areas" that have fallen to attacking Bosnian Serbs</B>. Some 30,000 women and children fled
Srebrenica and thousands more left Zepa, according to World Vision. The ministry has sent
110,000 liters of milk and 50 metric tons of fruits and vegetables to Tuzla, where many
refugees are staying. However, "there are simply no facilities in Tuzla for them," said Stevo
Dereta of the LIFE Center in Croatia, a refugee ministry associated with World Relief, an arm
of the National Association of Evangelicals. Food and medicine are in short supply and the
situation is critical, he said. Given the worsening situation, aid must be channeled into Bosnia
now, "while we know it will reach the refugees who need it," World Relief's European liaison
Martin Hartog told NIRR. If a major confrontation develops and Croatia is pulled into the
war, "there will be mass starvation," he said. Croatia is the entry point for supplies into
war-torn Bosnia, where evangelicals are carrying and distributing the aid. 
<BR><B>...Church leaders in Croatia "continue to exercise their faith in a remarkable way," Hartog
said</B>. Though physically fatigued and emotionally drained, they demonstrate "incredible
resiliency." Muslim refugees are "at first suspicious" of Christians who offer to help them, but
the practical aid and sincerity of the believers prevails, Hartog said. "Christians to them do
not represent a lot of goodness and love," he said, referring to the attacking Serbs, many of
whom are Orthodox. "But the gospel does." NIRR 08/07/95

<B>The 239,000-member Presbyterian Church in America took its sister denomination, the
215,000-member Christian Reformed Church, to task over women's ordination</B>. The CRC's
rules forbid ordination of women as pastors or elders, but a number of churches have defied
the ban and appointed women as pastors. In June, the CRC approved a compromise allowing
its regional clusters of churches to declare parts of the denomination's rules "inoperative" as
they apply to ordaining women. The Atlanta-based PCA warned the CRC that if it does not
"repent and rescind" its action, the PCA will seek its ouster from the North American
Presbyterian and Reformed Council. 
<BR><B>...Meanwhile, the CRC's regional unit in Southern California called a special assembly for
November</B>. It has invited other regional groups, churches, and congregational officers who
oppose women's ordination to take part. The meeting has been called to protest the CRC's
June action and to seek ways to "protect" congregations in areas where the local governing
body allows women to be ordained, organizers said. NIRR 08/07/95

PCUSA to restudy the COCU proposal. Many commissioners objected to the office of bishop
as called for by the plan, and also expressed concern that no separate denominational
ordinations would be allowed after it is implemented. The Office of Theology and Worship
was instructed to prepare a study guide of the plan "identifying salient issues and evaluating
the terms of participation in COCU from the perspective of Reformed theology and polity." 
<BR><B>...In other action, the commissioners voted 517-20 to rebuke "all divisive people and groups
in our church," and to urge them to repent and forgive each other</B>. Although homosexual and
feminist activists in the PCUSA caused dissention in recent years, the evangelical
Presbyterian Layman newspaper was seen as one of the main targets of the measure, sources

<B>Religious bigotry was behind the demotion of two Christians at the Resolution Trust Corp.,
the Rutherford Institute contends</B>. The religious rights organization sued the federal agency in
behalf of the pair on July 24. A superior repeatedly referred to Lindsey Fouts, former deputy
regional counsel for the RTC, as a "damn Christer," a "born-again jerk," and a "religious
zealot," the suit alleges. He later removed Fouts from his supervisory position. Other alleged
harassments included cutting Fouts off from his voice-mail and secluding him and his
paralegal assistant, Charlotte Roach, in isolated offices.  
<BR><B>...The two "were sent a very clear message they were not part of the team," lead counsel Gary
Simpson of the Rutherford Institute told NIRR</B>. When the RTC revamped its Dallas office in

desks notified them of their demotions, and managers refused to discuss the matter with them,
Simpson said. Both Fouts, a veteran of 15 years with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and
the RTC, and Roach had received excellent ratings on previous performance appraisals.
Preceding RTC managers said the southwest office performed more efficiently because of

<B>The House Appropriations Committee approved proposed legislation aimed at restricting
taxpayer-funded lobbying by nonprofit organizations</B>. Under its terms, nonprofits could spend
only 5% of non-government money they receive on political activity, down from 20%.
Present law already prohibits them from spending federal money to lobby. Groups that exceed
the 5% limit could not receive federal grants. Some conservatives in Congress claim
nonprofits receive $39 billion in federal subsidies annually, some of which is spent
improperly on political advocacy. 
<BR><B>...A coalition of several hundred nonprofit advocacy and charitable organizations, including

ECFA sources said. The CBN board restructured and no longer consists mostly of Pat
Robertson's family members and employees.

<B>Membership in the 8.6-million United Methodist Church dropped by 56,000 during 1994,
according to figures reported by the UMC's 68 regional conferences</B>. The tally showed 51 of
the conferences suffered net losses, continuing a 30-year decline in UMC membership. The
Texas and Alabama-West Florida conferences led in gains, with more than 3,000 new
members each.

<B>Relatives and friends of the 913 followers of cult leader Jim Jones said they will erect a
memorial wall at Evergreen Cemetery in Oakland, Calif</B>. Spearheading the effort to raise
$35,000 for the project is Jynona Norwood, pastor of the Family Christian Cathedral Church
in Los Angeles. She lost her mother and 26 other relatives in the mass suicide-murder in
Guyana 17 years ago. Names of victims will be inscribed in a polished stone wall 6 feet high
and 20 feet long, she said.
<P>
<B>The American Bar Association committed sacrilege, according to the Rutherford Institute</B>. The
cover of the summer edition of Human Rights, an ABA publication, features a pregnant
woman about to receive an abortion. She is strapped to an operating table in a crucifix-like
pose, the religious rights group said. The group has demanded an apology from the ABA.
<P>
<B>A Christian writer's group is training believers to apply biblical principles to current issues</B>.
The Amy Foundation's Church Writing Group Movement is designed to help believers write
letters to the editors of their local newspapers. A video, 12-step lesson plan, and bimonthly
journal will help writers take advantage of the "powerful method by which people can
disciple thousands in their community," the group said. About 60%-80% of newspaper
subscribers read letters to the editor, the foundation said.
<P>
<B>The Illinois Appellate Court ruled in two separate cases that state law allows homosexual
couples to adopt children</B>. The court said that nothing in state law suggests sexual orientation
is a relevant consideration for adoption. Each case involved a lesbian who adopted her
partner's biological child.
<P>
<B>The media industry's proposed "v-chip," which would allow people to block violent and
sexually explicit programming from their TV sets, is not enough, Morality in Media said</B>. It
places too much responsibility on parents, the group said. The entertainment industry must
curb "gratuitous, destructive violence and sleaze at its source, and for the government to be
vigilant in enforcing obscenity and indecency laws," the New York-based advocacy group
contends.

<B>Liberia: The Association of Evangelicals in Liberia and World Relief, the Wheaton, Ill.-based
evangelical aid agency, brought together 1,000 leaders of the country's government, churches,
and warring factions to discuss peace and reconciliation</B>. There were confessions, apologies,
and a recognition that the church must lead the way to national healing, World Relief
representative Brian Johnson said. AEL previously sponsored two smaller reconciliation
conferences (NIRR 12/12/94), but some of the worst massacres of the six-year civil war were
committed after both of them, news accounts said.

<B>Nigeria: Most Nigerians are hungry and have been reduced to picking crumbs from public
garbage bags in a country that is predominantly agricultural, according to the Christian
Association of Nigeria</B>. CAN, which is comprised of Catholics and Protestants, said that the
military government has brought the nation to the brink of chaos. CAN called for a return to
true democracy. "Nothing short of divine intervention" will be successful in ending the
suffering, according to the group's statement.

<P>
<B>Malaysia: The government banned a controversial Malay translation of the Koran, newspapers
reported</B>. It is part of a drive to wipe out unorthodox Islamic teaching by the year 2000. The
volume, published in Singapore, lacks a parallel copy of the original text in Arabic, and some
of its contents deviated from mainstream Islamic teachings, officials said. The government
also has targeted at least 17 "deviant" Muslim groups it wants to stamp out.

<B>North Korea: Schoolchildren who are learning English as a second language should be able to
study the Bible as a "classic of English literature," an official told a group of American
educators</B>. The man told Dale Kietzman, president of Intermission International, that the Bible
should be printed in both English and Korean. Kietzman, who headed the group of visiting
educators, has had ongoing conversations with North Korean officials about such a possibility,
journalist Dan Wooding reported.

<B>South Korea: Where is Ahn Seung-un?  South Korean officials claim Ahn, 50, a missionary
from the Full Gospel Church in Seoul, was kidnapped in China and taken to North Korea</B>.
Ahn, who had been working in an ethnic Korean area of northeastern China for several years,
disappeared July 9 while walking with converts in Yanji, church sources said. North Korea's
official news agency insisted Ahn defected. Chinese investigators reportedly arrested one of
the alleged kidnappers. The area is populated in part by North Korean defectors. Officials in
Seoul said South Koreans working in the area are the targets of kidnapping attempts because
North Korea believes they have been helping others defect.

<B>Sri Lanka: Authorities deported United Methodist mission intern Kenneth Mulder, 25, of Ada,
Mich., after detaining him almost a week</B>. Police said they found artwork and text, which he
had created on a computer, opposing government policy in the civil war with minority Tamil
rebels in the north. They discovered the materials during a search of the offices of the
National Christian Council, where Mulder worked. Church leaders also said that the police
suspected Mulder of smuggling explosives to the rebels. Reuters quoted Mulder as saying his
only mission was to promote peace. Church leaders said Mulder's ouster was unjust.

<B>Argentina: A door-to-door salesman last year persuaded Hector Arce to buy an expensively
bound Bible on an installment plan</B>. Shortly afterward, Arce lost his job as a public servant
and bought an oven to make pizzas so he could support his three young children. But it
wasn't enough, and when he fell behind on his Bible payments, the firm sued. Last month,
court officials and police confiscated Arce's furniture, worth $1,500, and the pizza oven. Arce
said he tried to return the Bible, but was told it wouldn't cover legal costs incurred by the
book firm.

<B>Uruguay: Middle- and upper-class Montevideans are showing openness to spiritual matters,
missionaries say</B>. The country is probably the most secularized in South America due to an
anti-Catholic backlash at the turn of the century, Dick Young, a Baptist General Conference
missionary, told NIRR. "The past two or three generations were taught that they were beyond
religion," he said. Disillusionment in the past decade has induced many to consider spiritism
and mysticism, but they also express an interest in Christianity. Because of the reports, CB
International is planning to begin an outreach in the capital city next year.

<B>Austria: Four of the country's 16 Catholic bishops denied allegations by a gay rights activist
that they have homosexual tendencies</B>. At least two said they were initiating lawsuits to force
Kurt Krickler to retract his statement. Krickler and his group, Opus Lei, reportedly staged the
outing as part of a campaign to lower the age of consent for homosexual sex from 18 to 14 in
line with the law for heterosexuals. He said the church was targeted first because it is partly
responsible for creating the moral climate in the predominantly Catholic country.
<P>
<B>Bulgaria: The Sofia city council voted 56-1 to permit Baptists to proceed with construction of
an orphanage</B>. The action partially reversed a vote in February rejecting the project and
halting work. Council leaders at the time cited "negative effects" the Baptists might have on
the predominantly Orthodox population. In reconsidering, the council eliminated a proposed
Bible school and church from the plans. Baptist leaders attributed the council's turn-around to
prayers and an international pressure campaign.

<B>England: Anglican leader Brandon Jackson, 60-year-old dean of the 900-year-old Gothic
cathedral in Lincoln, located in eastern England, was acquitted of adultery</B>. Verity Freestone,
a 32-year old lay worker, alleged that they had an affair after he seduced her. She described
details of the dean's bedroom for the four male jurors, two laymen and two clergy. Jackson
acknowledged he may have been overly friendly toward her, but denied having committed
immoral acts. Jackson lashed out at church authorities, accusing them of a conspiracy to
retaliate for his criticism of certain church policies. Church leaders, under pressure to reform
the centuries-old disciplinary procedures, predicted it will be the last such trial.

Protestant churches are sprouting in Islamic Asian republics of the former Soviet Union. A
church planted in Uzbekistan four years ago has grown to 3,000 members. It attracts 700-800
people to each of four Sunday services, holds daily morning services, and has planted 55
other congregations -- 22 of them in neighboring Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and
Turkmenistan. "I was thrilled when I found them. I wept," said Slavic Radchuk, a missionary
for Christian Aid Mission, a Charlottesville, Va., agency that supports indigenous Christian
workers. Radchuk revisited the region this year after traveling some 30,000 miles throughout
the former Soviet Union during 1984 while planting a number of churches.  
<BR>...About half the new believers are former Muslims, as is 95% of the general population,
CAM said. Conversion to Christianity causes family strife, and even violence. "My father
received Jesus and I wanted to kill him," said a former Muslim who now assists his father in
pastoring 250 people at three churches in Tajikistan. They have planted five other churches in
the country where some 400 people worship, CAM said.  
<BR>...For the first time, the Kyrgyz are responding, according to a Russian pastor in Kyrgyzstan.
Two churches began in Talis, Kyrgyzstan, after rallies by American evangelist Brent Regis.
He told NIRR that 20,000 Kyrgyz attended seven days of services, and about 25% of them
made commitments to Christ. Rick Lewellyn, who teaches at The School of Christ in
Tokmak, Kyrgyzstan, told NIRR that his students attend classes for three months, then go out
to make new converts and plant churches. "They don't get their diplomas until three months
later when they come back," Lewellyn said. The school averages 25 students a semester;
some 200 former students have started more than 50 churches, he said. Also, Kazakhstan has
a Bible school with about 80 students. 
<BR>...Tools of communism are being used to spread the gospel, CAM said. Christian ministries
use powerful radio transmitters built to spread communist propaganda, and empty Communist
Party cultural halls are available to local Christians as churches. For years only Russian was
taught in the Soviet republics, although many republics are beginning to teach their local
language in the schools. Thus, for now, Christians need only one language to preach.

Fifteen thousand people committed their lives to Christ during Greg Laurie's Anaheim, Calif.,
crusade July 13-16. Some 164,000 people attended the Riverside, Calif., pastor's 6th annual
crusade in Anaheim Stadium. Members of 640 churches coordinated and staffed the event,
which was organized by Laurie's Harvest Ministries.  
<BR>...Nearly 20,000 children and their parents attended Harvest Kid's Crusade on Saturday
morning, July 15. After a program with Psalty, the Singing Songbook, more than 3,200
children and 400 adults committed their lives to Christ, Laurie's ministry said. Saturday
night's program focused on teen-agers, and most of the 55,000 attendees were young people
who came to hear Laurie's preaching and several Christian rock bands. Laurie quoted lyrics
from the rock group The Police: "There's a hole in my life, shadow in my heart that's tearing
me apart. I hate this disease, God help me please." He told the crowd that if they felt the
same emptiness, "you've come to the right place tonight." Some 5,000 people responded to
the invitation to become believers. 
<BR>...Laurie is holding additional crusades this summer in Eugene, Ore., San Diego, Calif.,
Colorado Springs, Colo., Rochester, N.Y., and Fort Lauderdale, Fla. For information, call
(909)687-6595. NIRR 07/24/95

Christians are taking the initiative to befriend and pray for their unbelieving northern
California neighbors. Four hundred homes in Yuba and Sutter counties have become "prayer
houses." Christians promise to introduce themselves to their neighbors, ask if they have prayer
needs, and, if so, pray for them, according to Greg Burnett of Harvest Evangelism. In Yuba
City alone, Christians knocked on doors of 75% of the houses in the town of 35,000. The
Christians, from 31 congregations, also handed out 5,400 videos titled Are You Going to
Heaven? and many Billy Graham booklets titled Steps To Peace With God, Burnett said. 
<BR>...The San Jose-based group is testing the "prayer evangelism" in California after its effective
use in Argentina; Harvest Evangelism branched off from Argentine-born evangelist Luis
Palau's organization in 1983. Response has been "amazing," Burnett said. "People are open to
prayer. They appreciate the concern." When Christians show sincere interest in forming a
relationship with neighbors, it "builds bridges and gives God an opportunity to work," he said.
<BR>...Flooding the area with neighborly help was also part of the northern California outreach,
organizers said. This spring, Christians blitzed Yuba and Sutter counties with kindness, giving
pizzas to workers in hospital emergency rooms and police departments, spraying herbicides
and doing landscaping for cities, painting over graffiti, conducting clothing giveways and free
car washes, and giving away hot dogs in front of the local WalMart. 
<BR>..."The whole spiritual climate of the community has shifted," Burnett said. "The city now is
looking at the churches and saying `we didn't know that you were relevant and that you
cared.'" Mayors, city administrators, fire and police departments "know they are being prayed
for," he said. NIRR 07/24/95

Some 4,000 Christians from a variety of cultures, denominations, and races celebrated
Pentecost together in Greensboro, N.C., last month. BondFire `95 was a "spiritual firestorm"
that will ignite reconciliation efforts, said Vinson Synan, dean of the Regent University
Divinity School in Virginia Beach, Va. Synan spoke at the rally along with bishops Ithiel
Clemmons of the Church of God in Christ and B.E. Underwood of the International
Pentecostal Holiness Church. The three men helped found the Pentecostal/Charismatic
Churches of North America (NIRR 10/31/94) in Memphis, Tenn. The PCCNA, an interracial
association, began a new era of cooperation in Pentecostalism, which has been divided along
racial boundaries for 70 years. NIRR 07/24/95

The choice in America's culture wars "is between virtues and nihilism," William Bennett,
co-director of Washington, D.C.- based Empower America, told the International Congress on
the Family. Some 3,000 Christian counselors, pastors, and lay workers attended the July 5-9
conference in Denver co-sponsored by Focus On The Family and The American Association
of Christian Counselors. One hundred twenty-one workshops emphasized practical aspects of
family life, parenting, and counseling. Other speakers included Kay James, Adrian Rogers,
and E.V. Hill. 
<BR>...James Dobson lashed out at a United Nations conference on the rights of women, to be held
in Beijing in September. The FOF founder said conference leaders want to eliminate gender
distinctions, and that constitutes "the greatest threat to the family that I've seen in my
lifetime." American delegates to the conference could be imprisoned if they take Bibles into
China for distribution or engage in unauthorized religious activities, State Department officials
warned. NIRR 07/24/95

A Christian group is helping broker peace between warring factions in Liberia's civil war. A
three-person delegation from the St. Joseph, Mo.-based Agency for Holistic Evangelism and
Development played a major role at a conference in Abuja, Nigeria, in May. Romeo Horton,
a native Liberian and former government official, led the delegation as it met with
representatives of the six warring factions and nine African nations affected by the five-year
conflict. In one meeting, Muslims, Hindus, Christians, and members of warring factions
joined arms as Horton prayed for peace, Charles Oakes of AHEAD told NIRR. At the end of
the conference, the warlords agreed the war has to end and asked that AHEAD send a
delegation to a subsequent meeting in Monrovia. 
<BR>...The Liberians were impressed with a plan for rebuilding the country through the resources
of Christian ministries, AHEAD founder Augustus Marwieh, a Liberian minister, told NIRR.
Marwieh, who had become nationally known through a television ministry, was forced to flee
Liberia in the early '90s because of the war. A church planter for 17 years, Marwieh formed
AHEAD to help churches and ministries become self-sufficient through entrepreneurship,
hands-on skills, and academic education. The Liberian church is too dependent on Western
funding for its survival, Marwieh said. NIRR 07/24/95

Christians in Hong Kong are struggling with fears, anxieties, and hopelessness in light of the
British protectorate's impending absorption into China in 1997. Despite that, hundreds of
them joined together with other Christians to "foster a citywide prayer movement for revival,"
said David Bryant, president of Concerts of Prayer International. Bryant led local pastors and
church leaders in a concert of prayer in Hong Kong July 1-3. 
<BR>..."I don't believe there is any city more strategic for Christ's global cause than Hong Kong
right now," Bryant said. About 500 pastors and church leaders attended a three-hour training
session and an estimated 10,000 came to a prayer rally in Hong Kong Stadium, according to
COP. The leaders were inspired by the prospect of how God could bless China if the Hong
Kong church enters 1997 unified, prayerful, and "joyful in hope," Bryant said. He hopes to
hold a Concerts of Prayer rally on the mainland next year. NIRR 07/24/95

Twenty-somethings in Israel may be more responsive to the gospel than any other generation,
conferees at the Fifth International Conference on Jewish Evangelism, held near Bethlehem,
agreed. About 175 evangelists, pastors, and church leaders came to the conference, hosted by
the Lausanne Consultation on Jewish Evangelism, part of the Lausanne Committee for World
Evangelization.  
<BR>...Jewish youth are spiritually adrift, sexually promiscuous, taking illegal drugs, and generally
embracing the hedonistic lifestyle of American popular culture, Southern Baptist Convention
representative Jim Sibley said. "If we're not in the midst of a full-blown hippie movement,
we're on the verge of one." Yet this generation is more likely to accept the gospel because
they are "curious enough and open enough" to explore spiritual things, Sibley said.

Another financial scandal has swept American colleges -- including  Christian colleges. The
Common Fund, which oversees $20 billion entrusted to it by colleges and other schools,
announced that a securities trader at a firm that manages its money lost $128 million by
engaging in "unauthorized trading." Weeks earlier, Christian colleges were among nonprofits
suffering larger losses in The Foundation For New Era Philanthropy bankruptcy (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/071095.html">NIRR 7/10</A>).
<BR>...The trader, Kent Ahrens, 39, worked at First Capital Strategists in York, Pa. Ahrens lost a
"relatively small amount of money" three years ago when he speculated with funds that were
not supposed to be risked, Fred Spar, a spokesman for Westport, Conn.-based The Common
Fund, told NIRR. When Ahrens tried to conceal the loss by speculating with more money, he
compounded his error, Spar said. Ahrens' actions violated "very clear and strict guidelines"
established by First Capital and The Common Fund. The losses were discovered when "things
got too hot for Ahrens and he told his boss," Spar said.  
<BR>...The Common Fund, which has an excellent investment record, handles the investment
programs of a number of Christian colleges, although how much money each school lost, if
any, was not immediately clear. Only a few of First Capital's funds suffered losses, and it is
not clear which investors had money in those funds. The losses are reductions in interest
income only, and no principal is threatened, Spar said. 
<BR>...Most schools investing in The Common Fund are too small to afford professional fund
managers, so they pooled their money. According to Spar, among the long list of schools that
invested in the fund, but which did not necessarily suffer losses, are: Abilene Christian
University, Biola University, Westmont College, North Park College, Trinity College, Trinity
Christian College, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, Taylor University, Asbury College,
Eastern Nazarene College, Calvin College, Houghton College, and Dallas Theological
Seminary. Wheaton College said it had invested in The Common Fund, but did not lose any
money. 
<BR>...Messiah College in Grantham, Pa., had invested $60 million in The Common Fund, The
Philadelphia Inquirer said. As a result, the school's expected income from its investments this
fiscal year fell significantly. Messiah also deposited $2 million with New Era last fall. As one
of the later arrivals in that alleged scheme, Messiah was to receive its contribution plus $2
million in matching funds, but the pyramid collapsed and the money disappeared.

Three creditors in the New Era bankruptcy case filed a class-action suit against Prudential
Securities. They contend that Prudential broker Stuart Bianchi of Kenosha, Wis., conspired
with New Era founder Jack Bennett to defraud charities and individual donors. Bianchi issued
letters indicating that Prudential had placed participants' money in escrow accounts, the suit
alleges. In reality, according to a suit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission
against Bennett, virtually all the money placed with Bianchi was commingled in a single
account that Bennett controlled. The SEC says Bennett diverted the funds to companies he
controlled, and used them as collateral on a margin trading account to pay early depositors in
a purported matching-grant program. Prudential hastened New Era's bankruptcy when it
seized the account to cover $45 million New Era had borrowed. 
<BR>...The class-action suit seeks to recover the $45 million. If successful, it would fatten New
Era assets to $75 million, against estimated losses of about $107 million. The suit was filed
by the Rescue Mission Alliance, Sacred Works, and Wesley Skinner, all of the Syracuse,
N.Y., area. Prudential spokesman Charles Perkins said the suit was without merit. But he
acknowledged that an assistant to Bianchi had issued letters over six months in 1994
inaccurately stating that escrow accounts had been established for charities. It was an innocent
error that was corrected by her superiors, he said. Bennett used the letters to help allay
questions by prospective depositors. 
<BR>...Bennett's lawyers filed motions seeking dismissal of the SEC suit and another filed by the
Pennsylvania attorney general. They argued that the SEC has no jurisdiction in the case since
agreements between New Era and nonprofit participants were not securities, and deposited
funds were not investments.  
<BR>...New Era is the single largest bankruptcy in the nonprofit sector in U.S. history, attorney
Michael Bloom said at a meeting of creditors in Philadelphia last month. Bankruptcy judge
Bruce Fox this month confirmed the election of former federal judge Arlin Adams as trustee
in the case. Adams called for another meeting of creditors July 24 in Philadelphia.

A ministry to Moscow's poor and homeless fights government bureaucrats and criminals to
remain in operation, according to Keston News Service. "If it weren't for my faith in Christ, I
wouldn't even think of living this way," said Aleksandr Ogorodnikov, founder of the
Christian Mercy Society. CMS is an indigenous, independent Christian organization that runs
a soup kitchen and homeless shelter. Its operation is housed in a 17th century building that is
under reconstruction. Though Ogorodnikov deems the building unfit for human habitation, he
began housing former prostitutes there when they begged him to get them off the streets. 
<BR>...City bureaucrats evicted Ogorodnikov from his modern offices in central Moscow and
others demanded bribes to let him continue his programs. Once, his soup kitchen was shut
down for several weeks until an international protest from British and American legislators
forced the local government to let it reopen. The local bureaucrats are trying to take the

An effort to tie Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) standards of clergy sexual conduct more closely
to the Bible and historic confessions of faith has failed. At issue was a proposed change to
the 2.7-million-member denomination's Book of Order. The new wording said the life of the
ordained should "be a demonstration to the church and the world of the Christian faith and
life as defined by Scripture and the Confessions." The wording is similar to the present rule
with the addition of "as defined by Scripture and the Confessions." Proponents said the
change would bar practicing homosexuals from the ministry. The proposal needed the votes of
86 of the 171 presbyteries, but garnered only 82. NIRR 07/24/95

Disciple Renewal, an evangelical group in the mainline Christian Church (Disciples of

The General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Church rejected a request from its

The Netherlands, rejected the idea by a vote of 1,481 to 673. North American president

"seriously disillusioned" by a vote opposing ordination. Most backers of the proposal were
from North America and Europe, while opponents were primarily from Africa, Asia, and

Vietnam's communist government "is to be held accountable for many things, but the people
of Vietnam should be reached out to with love and healing," war veteran and evangelist Dave
Roever told NIRR. The Clinton Administration officially recognized the country this month.
Roever, whose ministry runs medical clinics and provides clothing and educa- tional
assistance to Vietnamese children, said economic freedom will spawn religious freedom.  
<BR>...Reconciliation with Vietnam can heal the "deep and lasting wounds" of the war, said World
Vision President Bob Seiple, a former Marine captain who flew 300 missions over Vietnam.
"By reaching back to help," veterans are healed of scars from the war, Dave Ohlerking of
Children's Cup International told NIRR. The relief-and-development organization gives
veterans the opportunity to help Vietnamese children (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/062695.html">NIRR 6/26</A>). Del Wantland, executive
director of Point Man Internation- al, a ministry of and for veterans, said that a veteran who
recently made a ministry trip there came back a different person. "It changed all the tapes in
his mind," Wantland told NIRR. Wantland did not favor recognizing Vietnam. Veterans want
to see the Vietnamese people helped, but suspect that Vietnamese officials will benefit more
from the new relationship, he said. NIRR 07/24/95

Older adults who practice their faith are healthier. They have lower blood pressure, fewer

Harold Koenig, a professor at Duke University Medical Center, and Andrew Weaver, a

coronary artery disease was twice as high among non-religious men, they said in an article in

What race was Jesus? The answers to that question, and others regarding race, are influenced
by the race of the people asking and answering the question. That is one of the findings of a
survey of black adults, said political scientist Lynn Sanders of the University of Chicago. One
question in the survey asked what color Jesus Christ was. Nearly a third (31%) who thought
they were being interviewed by an African American said Jesus was black, compared with
17% who thought they were being interviewed by a white. The percentage who said they
didn't think of Jesus as either black or white increased from 55% for those who thought they
were being questioned by blacks to 74% for those who assumed they were being interviewed
by whites. All interviewers were black. NIRR 07/24/95

President Clinton's order instructing administration officials to clarify for public school
officials the religious rights of students is "symbolism without substance," said Michael
Whitehead, general counsel of the Southern Baptist Christian Life Commission. The president,
who announced the directive in a speech at a Virginia high school this month, said he was
"deeply troubled" that many Americans believe their religious beliefs are endangered by the
government. He listed 10 activities in public schools that are protected by the Constitution.
But he also said school officials had, on occasion, wrongly prohibited students from such
practices as reading the Bible silently in study hall and praying over their lunches. Whitehead
said the directive lacks enforcement power and noted that no executive order or proposed
legislation was issued to stop the violations. Jay Sekulow of the American Center for Law
and Justice said the president was just "playing politics" with the issue to shore up re-election
support with a disenchanted constituency. 
<BR>...In contrast, the Baptist Joint Committee, which represents other Baptist denominations,
endorsed Clinton's approach. Informing teachers and other educators about the issue is
important, BJC officials said. NIRR 07/24/95

Islamic extremists are using the Internet for planning strategies, according to the International

censorship laws in their countries and communicate with like-minded organizations in other
countries, the group said. Algeria's Armed Islamic Group issues regular e-mail communiques,
one which threatened to kill the relatives of Algerian soldiers and police. Other groups have
posted manuals on military training and methods for smuggling weapons across borders. Ease

A registered nurse who witnessed three partial-birth abortions said it was "the most horrifying
experience of my life." Brenda Shafer of Franklin, Ohio, was working for a nursing agency in
September 1993 when she accepted a three-day assignment to the Women's Medical Center,
an abortion clinic in Dayton. "I was at that time very pro-choice," and even told her two
teen-age daughters that if they got pregnant she would make them have an abortion, Shafer
said in a July 9 letter to a congressman. 
<BR>...One of the three late-term abortions Shafer saw involved a woman who was six months
pregnant, she said. As Martin Haskell, the doctor who runs the clinic, delivered the body and
arms up to the neck, the baby's "little fingers were clasping together. He was kicking his
feet," Shafer said. "All the while his little head was still stuck inside." Haskell then "took a
pair of scissors and inserted them into the back of the baby's head. Then he opened the
scissors up. Then he stuck the high-pow- ered suction tube into the hole and sucked the
baby's brains out," she said. Haskell delivered the rest of the body and "threw the baby in a
pan along with the placenta and the instruments he'd used. I saw the baby move in the pan,"
she said. The baby, which had Down's syndrome, "had the most perfect, angelic face I have
ever seen," she said. The two other partial-birth abortions Shafer saw involved babies that had
no defects, she said.

abortions. The bill is expected to go to the full House. NIRR 07/24/95

Susan Smith's pastor said the confessed murderer found God during her months in solitary
confinement. Mark Long, the United Methodist Church minister at Smith's mother's church in
Buffalo, S.C., heard Smith's confession of faith and baptized her at a maximum-security
prison in Columbia, S.C., in February. Smith faces a possible death sentence for the Oct. 25
drownings of her 3-year-old son Michael and his 14-month-old brother, Alex. She confessed
to letting them drown when she sent her car into a lake. Smith attended services at the
Buffalo UMC once a month before her children's fate became known. 
<BR>..."She has found forgiveness from God," said Long, who also helped officiate at the Smith
boys' funeral last year and has met regularly in prison with Smith. The 23-year-old is far
more troubled by life than by the prospect of death in the electric chair, Long said. That
would probably change as Smith "is afforded the opportunity to grow in faith and to know
that she is not alone, that God is with her." Smith, whom doctors have testified is suicidal, no
longer writes desperate letters to her dead sons seeking their forgiveness, Long said. 
<BR>...Smith's defense lawyers fought to have her confession excluded as evidence. They said
Sheriff Howard Wells, a Christian, acknowledged lying to Smith in a church gymnasium Nov.
3 in order to elicit her confession. Wells then prayed with her, the lawyers said.

Jeanne Audrey Powers, a United Methodist executive, announced she has been a lesbian all
her life. She made the statement before preaching at a Minneapolis meeting of the
Reconciling Churches Convocation. The RCC includes nearly 100 UMC churches that
welcome homosexuals. UMC law forbids ordination of "practicing homosexuals," but does not
define the term or compel people to so identify themselves. Powers said she will not resign,
surrender her ordination papers, or reveal whether she is a practicing lesbian. She is associate
general secretary of the UMC's General Commission on Christian Unity and Interreligious
Concerns and helped organize the 1993 RE-Imagining conference (NIRR 11/14/94) that paid
homage to Sophia, goddess of wisdom. 
<BR>...Leaders of Good News, a UMC evangelical caucus, called for Powers to be reprimanded or
removed. They accused her of a premeditated attack on UMC standards. However, confusion
over the term "practicing" may mean an ineffective response by the Minnesota regional UMC
conference, the leaders told NIRR. Fallout from the case may force next year's UMC General
Conference to deal definitively with the issue, they said. NIRR 07/24/95

Two teen-age clients of an abortion clinic can sue pro-life protesters for invasion of privacy,

garbage can in the Detroit suburb of Livonia in 1991 (NIRR 11/29/93). Lois Mitoraj, who is a
nun, and Lynn Mills, a spokeswoman for Operation Rescue, inscribed the girls' names on

overturned a 1993 lower-court decision in a $350,000 lawsuit against the protesters. That
decision found privacy rights were not violated because the names were found in the clinic's
garbage. Mills said she will appeal the decision.

College students on summer vacation are spreading news of their campus revivals 
(<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/051595.html">NIRR 5/15</A>) and are looking with hope toward the fall. Of the thousands of Christian students who
repented and publicly confessed deep personal sins this spring, many are testifying in local
churches, at Christian camps, and in smaller settings about their changed lives. 
<BR>...Some have told their stories to the media. Wheaton College professor Lyle Dorsett and
recent Howard Payne University graduate James Hahn taped a Donahue show, which is
expected to be aired this summer. Hahn credited "much prayer cover" for allowing the two
Christians to present the gospel clearly during their interview. Television talk-show host Phil
Donahue was "very respectful," he told NIRR. 
<BR>...The revival already has impacted churches across the country, although their number is
difficult to quantify. Hahn is traveling wherever God leads him to talk about the revival, he
said. He and fellow HPU graduate Shelly Southerland have spoken at 20 churches of various
denominations across Alabama, Tennessee, and Florida. "Incredible things have happened" as
family members tearfully reconcile long-standing disagreements, husbands repent of failure to
assume spiritual leadership, and wives confess bitterness and anger, Hahn said.  
<BR>..."I believe the best is yet to come," John Avant, pastor of Coggin Avenue Baptist Church in
Brownwood, Texas, told NIRR. "There is no sign of letup" in the hunger for revival on
college campuses, said Avant, who pastors a number of students from Howard Payne, where
the revival began. Gary Stratton, dean of the chapel at Gordon College in Wenham, Mass.,
said students at other colleges are praying for a similar touch from God. In Santa Barbara,
Calif., Westmont College students were "weeping and crying out to God" recently when
Stratton described his school's revival, he told NIRR. Matt Yarrington, a student leader at
Wheaton, said that when revival meetings ended this spring, "the fervor was never dimmed
and only increased." Many students "may still be hungry for this kind of movement," he said.
Yarrington was one of the students from several schools who spent much of the spring
visiting other campuses to describe their experiences. At almost every college they visited -including the Ivy League's Yale University in New Haven, Conn., Dartmouth College in
Hanover, N.H., and Columbia University in New York City -- similar events occurred, he
said. The revival has touched at least 50 colleges, some leaders estimate; others say the
number is much higher.  
<BR>...However, "a couple of days of meetings does not an awakening make," Stratton said. "I'm
looking to see a movement of God's Spirit grow and touch millions of students," said
Stratton, who fasted and prayed for 40 days prior to the spiritual outbreak at Gordon this
spring. Last spring's revival -- some say it is more accurately called a renewal -- may have
been "God's warning shot across the bow to say `get ready,'" Stratton said. "A very small
percentage of the church is prepared" to handle the influx of new believers if wide-scale
revival does occur, he said. Prayer, clear teaching, and "genuine, biblical discipleship" are
necessary to sustain the blessings, Stratton said. The history of revivals is filled with stories
of people "deeply and profoundly touched, but never brought into discipleship."  
<BR>...Students continue to mature spiritually, leaders say. Speaking at their home churches helps
students "process what is significant for them," according to Kevin Engle of Wheaton's Office
of Christian Outreach. Many students say they are learning to "keep shorter accounts with the
Lord -- getting right with God every day instead of waiting for a big annual audit," he said.
Students also say they have a new desire to be more vocal about sharing their faith. Many
expressed regret over failing to share Christ with unsaved family members. Some students
have "just melted in a puddle of tears of remorse over not sharing," Engle said. 
<BR>...Other students have begun to fast, some as long as 40 days, Engle said. Last spring,
Wheaton students snapped up 680 copies of Bill Bright's book on fasting as a key to revival.
The Campus Crusade founder had contributed the books with the stipulation that students read
them over the summer. Wheaton officials even have discussed making special financial
arrangements for students who will be fasting in the fall rather than eating in the school's
cafeteria. 
<BR>...College leaders and students are planning a three-day conference to fast, pray, and plan
strategy concerning the campus revival. For information on Where Do We Go From Here,
call Stratton at (508) 927-2300, ext. 4215. NIRR 07/10/95

A church in which 95% of the members once were on welfare and food stamps has become a
model of economic success and spiritual hope. In 1977, the 200 members of Christ Temple
Church in Meridian, Miss., took stock of themselves and their impoverished situation. Many
had a long history of running up credit at the general store and faced a future of owing more
than they made. Bishop Luke Edwards, pastor of the Pentecostal church, was getting tired of
congregants "shouting all over the church on Sunday, then going back home just as broke as
those who never came to church at all." 
<BR>...The congregants pooled their resources and bought peanuts in 50-pound sacks, then resold
them for 25 cents a bag on the streets and in the stockyards. In four months, the church had
enough money to make a down payment on the purchase of a supermarket. Eventually, the
congregation formed a nonprofit organization that added numerous other enterprises over the
years. The businesses now include three motels, a gas station, three restaurants, two chicken
farms and 3,000 acres, a 54-acre housing development, a construction company, 1,000 cattle,
a hog operation with 300 brood sows, two meat-processing plants, a K-12 school with
dormitories, an auto dealership, and an auto repair and parts shop. Members of the church
work in the businesses, which employ a number of other people. Today, no one in the
congregation receives welfare or food stamps and everyone is employed. 
<BR>..."Welfare is a disease that made us invalids," Edwards, the son of a sharecropper, told
NIRR. Government has allowed blacks to be entrapped, he said. The church falls short, too,
by overspiritualizing Christianity while overlooking people's physical needs, Edwards said.
Success has turned Edwards' congregants into "completely different persons." They no longer
are "standing around," but are "part of the American Dream, part of this country, the greatest
country in the world. They are proud and happy." NIRR 07/10/95

Churches in Modesto, Calif., and surrounding areas have grown significantly in membership
as a result of the so-called Miracle in Modesto (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/030695.html">NIRR 3/6</A>). Some 33,000 people committed
their lives to Christ early this year during Reality Outreach Ministries' fire-and-brimstone play
Heaven's Gates and Hell's Flames. Although "not all those people connected" with one of the
250 churches that divided names and addresses of the new converts, many area congregations
did grow as a result of the play, said Glen Berteau, pastor of Calvary Temple Worship
Center, the Assemblies of God church where the play was staged. 
<BR>...The influx of new members has brought changes to the churches. The new believers, some
of whom come from lower-income backgrounds, have a vibrant faith and yearn to grow in
Christ, Berteau told NIRR. "The person saved from much loves much. They're so
appreciative." The play also revitalized the faith of older believers. "People realize God
visited. They'll never be the same again," he said. "People have a tendency to go back to the
way it used to be -- I won't allow that." 
<BR>...Calvary Temple, which reluctantly halted production of the play after 28 performances to
allow time to assimilate new believers, plans to stage it again next February. A group of 50
Santa Maria, Calif., area churches will cooperate to stage the play beginning next month for
an indeterminate amount of time; Berteau met with the churches to help them plan their
performances. 
<BR>...Although Modesto's production of Heaven's Gates and Hell's Flames is the largest in the
play's 16-year history, there have been a few other large-scale successes, and many on a
smaller scale. Last year, 18,000 people came to Christ in response to the play at the Bethany
World Prayer Center in Baker, La., according to Frank Pauls of Reality Outreach Ministries.
Last year alone, some 136,000 people became Christians as a result of watching the play,
Pauls said. The ministry subsequently has stopped counting decisions for Christ because "that
sounds like bragging," he told NIRR. Response to the play is particularly striking for an
amateur production, many say. "It's the simple gospel," Pauls said. "That's all we preach:
heaven and hell." 
<BR>...With headquarters in St. Catherine's, Ontario, Canada, the ministry sends out
husband-and-wife teams that train members of local churches to act in the roles. Eighteen
such teams are active in North America and four in Europe. The ministry supplies team
members with a "very modest salary" and a 34-foot motor home for equipment. For more
information about the play, contact Reality Outreach Ministries at (905) 641-2114.

Two hundred "heroes of communism" in Minsk, Belarus, heard the gospel when Baptist
preacher John Avant and a group from his Texas church visited in May, he told NIRR. The
retired Communist Party members questioned the Christians about the theory of evolution and
were "astounded there was any other position," Avant said. Although two people angrily left
the meeting, about 150 accepted Christ, he said. One of the men who prayed to become a
Christian, an adviser to high government officials during communism, asked if he could be
forgiven for killing people. During a later trip to a military base, the group reported 750
soldiers converted to Christ. 
<BR>...A church is being built on the site of a Nazi death camp in the Minsk suburb of Shabaniy.
About 2.5 million people -- more than 25% of the population of Belarus -- died there during
Nazi occupation in World War II, Avant said. When anything is built in Shabaniy "they have
to relocate the bones," he said. The church's founder is a former member of parliament who
became a destitute alcoholic before turning to Christ. People wait in line more than two hours
to attend the service at a theater where the church meets, Avant said. NIRR 07/10/95

Pastors and church leaders will try to train 500,000 Christian workers by the year 2010. The
10-year plan, beginning in 2001, would be accomplished by 5,000 pastors who train 10
pastors a year for 10 years, evangelist Ramesh Richard told NIRR. 
<BR>...The need for trained leaders is great. Of the approximately 2 million pastor-evangelists
worldwide, only 5% are trained, Richard said during AD 2000 and Beyond's Global
Consultation on World Evangelism (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/062695.html">NIRR 6/26</A>). After AD 2000 completes its goal of
reaching every people-group with the gospel, pastors must be trained to nurture the new
congregations, Richard said. NIRR 07/10/95

Creditors and claimants involved in the Foundation for New Era Philanthropy  bankruptcy -many of them Christian groups -- elected a former federal appeals judge as permanent trustee
(<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/062695.html">NIRR 6/26</A>). He is Arlin Adams, 74, of Philadelphia, who is Jewish. Interim trustee John
Carroll III, a bankruptcy lawyer, said he might challenge the election. At stake, among other
things, is the trustee's fee, based on 3% of the assets over $1 million. New Era's assets are
about $31 million. Adams has indicated he will donate some of his services. 
<BR>...Their meeting was the first of creditors in the case. Carroll described New Era as a Ponzi
scheme, with "matching fund" grants to early participants paid for by deposits of later
participants. There were 163 "losers," 74 "winners," 11 who broke even, and 13 who had not
yet submitted figures, he reported. The net loss is $107 million, but may increase when all the
figures come in, he said.  
<BR>...Carroll indicated winners would have to return their money, either voluntarily or by court
action. Asked what will happen in instances where groups already have spent the money and
can't repay, he replied: "We haven't gone that far yet." He also held out hope that funds
placed in New Era by individual donors could be counted as donations and not be included as
debt. Distribution of the assets could begin by the end of the year, he predicted.                 
<P>
<BR>...Some 110 Christian nonprofits met the night before at a briefing chaired by federal Judge
Rollin Van Broekhoven, chairman of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability,
and Paul Nelson, ECFA president. The informal meeting was held under the auspices of
United Response to New Era, which ECFA aims to keep ministries informed and coordinate
strategy. The group agreed on the need to avoid litigation in resolving the case.

U.S. Air Force cargo planes are flying relief supplies -- some donated by Christian groups -around the world. MAP International, a Christian agency that transports medicine to needy
areas, is coordinating the efforts of various secular and religious relief groups. A late-1980s
law authorized military training flights to carry supplies rather than concrete blocks, which
formerly served as "cargo" on the trips. The practice was suspended during the Gulf War and
resumed only recently, Michael Nyenhuis, a spokesman for Brunswick, Ga.-based MAP, told
NIRR. Air Force planes filled with supplies make about 20 flights a month to locations
including Guatemala, Haiti, Belarus, and the former Yugoslavia. 
<BR>...The flights also are helping Mexico. MAP hopes to transport medicine regularly for 12
clinics that Mexican Medical, Inc., a San Diego-based Christian ministry, operates throughout
that country. The 18 Mexican doctors who run the clinics get help from 200 American
physicians who volunteer every year to perform more-specialized tasks, Mexican Medical
President Mel Peabody told NIRR. Last year the clinics treated 45,000 people at little or no
cost, he said. Church groups also visit to minister for weeklong periods. Through Vacation
Bible School classes and Christian films, they witness to some 30,000 people a summer;
about 1,000-2,000 become Christians, Peabody said. NIRR 07/10/95

Pope John Paul II and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, spiritual leader of the world's
150 million Orthodox believers, signed a statement pledging to seek improved relations
between their churches (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/020695.html">NIRR 2/6</A>). "We believe that more concerted and active cooperation
will also facilitate the influence of the Church on peace and justice in the areas of political
and ethnic conflict," the statement said, apparently in reference to former Yugoslavia. 
<BR>...The signing followed a colorful mass at St. Peter's Basilica, where both leaders talked to
the congregation. Bartholomew condemned divisions among Christians as a threat to
humanity. The pope said the start of Christianity's third millennium represents a "great
challenge" for humanity and especially for Christians. "We cannot, therefore, remain
separated," he said. The mass ended a three-day visit by the patriarch, only the third Orthodox
leader to meet with a pope since the Great Schism of 1054. NIRR 07/10/95

Southern Baptists approved the most extensive organizational overhaul in SBC history.
Meeting June 20-22 at the 150th annual convention at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, delegates
merged the Home Mission Board in Atlanta, the Brotherhood Commission in Memphis,
Tenn., and the Radio and Television Commission in Fort Worth, Texas, into a new North
American Mission Board, to be based in suburban Atlanta. In addition to approving a
resolution repenting of past racism (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/062695.html">NIRR 6/26</A>), SBC "messengers" called on Congress to
adopt a Constitutional Amendment to protect religious exercises, including voluntary prayer
and religious speech by public school students. They also gave a standing ovation to closing
speaker Billy Graham, who had been hospitalized only a week earlier for internal bleeding.
Graham urged his listeners to become the kind of people God will use for the unfinished task
of reaching the world for Christ. NIRR 07/10/95

Mainline Protestantism is aging rapidly, and two denominational studies show little hope that
young adults will repopulate the pews. In the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), just 13% of
members are in the 18-to-34-year-old group, compared with 36% in the general population, a
study found. It also found that a third of Presbyterians are 65 or older, nearly double the
percentage of older Americans. In the United Methodist Church, a recent profile showed the
percentage of church members 50 and older has risen from 49% in 1986 to 61% in 1994. A
third of UMC members are 66 or older. NIRR 07/10/95

A delegation of conservatives who belong to mainline denominations will lobby for family
values at the United Nations World Conference on Women in Beijing in September.
Organizers are not confident that the official delegations from Presbyterian, Episcopal,
Methodist, and other churches "will represent the views of the vast majority of women in
these denominations," said Terry Schlossberg of the Ecumenical Coalition on Women and
Society. The Washington, D.C.-based Institute on Religion and Democracy organized ECWS.
Schlossberg also heads Presbyterians Pro-Life.  
<BR>...The U.N. plan that representatives from 175 nations will consider in Beijing attempts to
promote equal educational and employment opportunities, but ignores the role of the family,
IRD head Diane Knippers said. It is an "arrogant, intrusive, and comprehensive experiment in
social engineering and restructuring society." The ECWS will emphasize the family as the
essential "building block of society" and support "the fundamental rights of women, including
their religious rights," she added. NIRR 07/10/95

The U.S. Supreme Court acted in several religion-related cases as it cleared its docket for the
current term:
<BR>...The University of Virginia was wrong when it refused to subsidize a student-run religious
magazine while it gave money to other student publications, the court ruled. The school's
refusal was a denial of the right of free speech, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote. It "would
risk fostering a pervasive bias or hostility to religion," he added. At issue was the school's
rejection of a $5,800 subsidy request from student activity fees for Wide Awake (NIRR
11/14/94). Several evangelical students founded the magazine in 1990. Jay Sekulow of the
American Center for Law and Justice, who represented the students, called the 5-4 decision a
"major victory for religious freedom." He predicted the ruling will "energize other religious
liberty issues, including the government subsidizing of tuition vouchers for religious schools."
<BR>...Ohio made a mistake in trying to bar the Ku Klux Klan from displaying a cross in a public
park next to the state capitol in Columbus in December 1993 (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/030695.html">NIRR 3/6</A>), the court said. The
park had been decorated during holiday seasons with a state-supplied Christmas tree and a
menorah. The Klan won the right to erect a 10-foot cross, but it was torn down by vandals. A
church then erected a similar cross, which remained in place. In the 7-2 decision, the justices
said the park was a public forum. "The court reaffirmed that the government may not pick
and choose what message private citizens can display in a public park," said Steven
McFarland, director of The Christian Legal Society's Center for Law and Religious Freedom. 
<P>
<BR>...The court side-stepped a dispute over graduation prayers at an Idaho public school (NIRR
11/28/94). At issue was a Grangeville High School policy that allows senior-class members to
vote whether to have a graduation prayer. Lower courts upheld the policy, but the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled it unconstitutional. The Supreme Court told the Circuit Court
to dismiss the suit as legally irrelevant since the students already have graduated; the high
court's action lifted the ban on student-led prayers in nine Western states. Advocates on both
sides of the church-state controversy said the Supreme Court's failure to give guidance in the
issue was a disappointment that will lead to further disputes. School officials around the
country are confused because federal courts have made conflicting rulings on graduation
prayers. 
<BR>...Religious groups for students may meet at school after hours. The court let stand a federal
appeals court decision against the Ladue, Mo., school district (NIRR 7/25/94). At issue was
whether school officials could bar a parent-led junior high Bible club from meeting there
although they permitted scout groups to meet. The appeals court said the school district's
1992 access policy amounted to "viewpoint discrimination" and a violation of religious
students' free-speech rights. Last November, the district banned all outside groups from using
school facilities between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. "This case is good news for religious student
groups everywhere," said Rutherford Institute attorney Tim Belz. NIRR 07/10/95

Television and newspaper ads run by the Christian Action Network during the 1992
presidential campaign were not subject to federal election laws. They did not "expressly
advocate" President Clinton's defeat, a federal judge ruled. The ads highlighted Clinton's
position on homosexual rights (NIRR 10/31/94). One ad showed a shouting man sporting a
T-shirt reading "Gay Father." A voice-over asked viewers if this was their vision of a better
America. 
<BR>...Corporations and groups that distribute ads supporting or opposing the election of
candidates must register with the Federal Election Commission as political action committees;
they are then subject to financial disclosure requirements. An FEC lawsuit against the Forest,
Va., policy group could have expanded the government's authority to restrict political speech,
observers said. "It's going to send a clear message to both parties" that they can't use the
FEC as a tool to censor conservative groups, CAN President Martin Mawyer said.

Wisconsin lawmakers made their state the first to give vouchers to impoverished parents so
they can send their children to private religious schools. They voted to expand a pilot
school-choice plan in Milwaukee to include sectarian schools. The 5-year-old plan now
involves 11 private schools and 800 voucher students. But under the expansion, up to 7,000
pupils could attend religious schools this fall, with an increase to 15,000 next year. Cost
estimates are $17 million and $39 million respectively, with the typical voucher worth about
$2,800. To qualify, students must come from a family whose income is at or below 175% of
the poverty level (about $26,000 for a family of four). Many of the city's 100 Catholic
schools are gearing up for participation in the program. Gov. Tommy Thompson said dropout
rates and low test scores in the public schools justify the experiment. NIRR 07/10/95

Conservative groups pushing for a constitutional amendment to allow school prayer presented
petitions with more than 800,000 signatures to House Speaker Newt Gingrich at a Capitol Hill
news conference. "The freedom of religion was never designed to be translated into the
government becoming an instrument of anti-religious enforcement," the Georgia Republican
said. Groups represented included the Traditional Values Coalition, the Christian Action
Network, William J. Murray Report, Liberty Counsel, American Family Association, and the
League of Prayer. Evangelist Tim Todd of Baton Rouge, La., said he gathered 200,000
signatures, many at revival meetings. About 150,000 came from Gingrich's district, he said.

Cuban authorities are subjecting 81 house churches in Camaguey to review rather than
immediate closure (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/061295.html">NIRR 6/12</A>), church officials said. When police arrested pastor Orson Vila
in May for refusing to close his church, government officials issued a declaration regarding
the other house churches in the region and began to scrutinize them more closely, an
Assemblies of God official in contact with the church there said. Ten churches have been
closed so far, he told NIRR. "It could be that the government is rescinding" its threat or that
eventually all the churches will be closed, the AG official said. Vila is in a work camp where
he is "doing what Orson does -- witnessing to everyone and praying for the sick," he said.
Cuba's Catholic bishops' conference asked the government to reconsider Vila's imprisonment.

Mubarak permits some persecution, Christians officially are protected, according to the
I.I.S.I.C. Bulletin. However, they are relegated to second-class status and often denied
government permission to build churches. In addition, fundamentalist militias prevent them
from traveling to existing churches. The government often turns a blind eye to such
persecution to appease Islamic fundamentalists, the publication said.  
<BR>...The status of Christians "would change dramatically if Mubarak is ousted" and Egypt were
ruled by the Muslim fundamentalists who tried to kill him last month in Ethiopia, Darling
said. Radical Muslims wish to establish an Islamic state in Egypt, similar to those in Saudi
Arabia and parts of the Sudan. In those countries, believers are subject to arrest,
imprisonment, and death. Although it is not clear if Ethiopian Muslims were involved in the
assassination attempt, they "have a considerable voice" in their own government and warm
relations with Islamic groups in neighboring countries, Darling said. NIRR 07/10/95

Sex education in America is not working, researcher William Masters told a gathering of the
American Academy of Clinical Sexologists in Washington, D.C. Masters, 79, is a
gynecologist and co-author with his ex-wife Virginia Johnson of pioneering works on
sexuality. Masters challenged the therapists and educators to target adults in addition to
children so that knowledge can filter down. Other therapists agreed that change is needed.
They pointed out that the United States has one of the highest rates of teen pregnancy and
infant mortality in any industrialized society. After all these years, "we haven't had a drop in
the teen pregnancy rate," said academy President William Ganzig, a University of Florida
medical school professor. Even medical residents in their 30s and 40s ask basic questions
about sex, he said. NIRR 07/10/95

Homosexual couples may adopt a child under District of Columbia law as long as the
adoption is in the child's best interest, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Court of Appeals ruled.
The decision overturned a lower court finding in a case where a mother waived rights to a
girl born in 1991. D.C. law does not ban adoption by unmarried couples, the judges said,
adding: "We conclude that unmarried couples living together in a committed personal
relationship, whether of the same sex or of opposite sexes, are eligible [to adopt]."

"We were connected in the very real electronic network of cyberspace and in the power of the
Holy Spirit," Nazarene pastor Daniel Elliot said after Nazarene elders participated in an
on-line healing service. Held in an America Online "chat room" -- an area where people have
conversations -- supplicants typed their prayer requests and the elders responded with their
prayers, Nazarene News Service said. Organizers notified participants of the time and place of

Missions officials and friends eulogized slain missionaries Stephen Welsh and Timothy Van
Dyke on June 26. The men are "not victims, they are victors," New Tribes Mission's
Executive Secretary George Davison said at Van Dyke's service at the ministry's Sanford,
Fla., headquarters. Welsh was memorialized at his home church in North Platte, Neb. 
<BR>...In Bogota, Colombia, more than a thousand people came to a memorial service during
which U.S. Ambassador Myles Frechette spoke, New Tribes spokesman Scott Ross said. Sen.
Jaime Ortiz, an evangelical member of Colombia's legislature, organized the service along
with local pastor Hector Pardo and prayer groups from both legislative houses, Paul Landrey
of Latin American Mission told NIRR. At Villavicencio, a village near the slayings, a service
attracted so many people that it had to be moved to a larger site, Macon Hare, Jr., New
Tribes' former field representative to Colombia, told NIRR. 
<BR>...The men's bodies were found after a firefight between their rebel captors and the
Colombian army (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/062695.html">NIRR 6/26</A>). The men were shot repeatedly in the head, according to news
reports. Hare doubted the report, but Ross said there were indications the men were
assassinated. Kidnapped in January 1994, the missionaries were being held for a ransom
reported to be $2 million to $3 million, according to news reports. Four missionaries still are
hostages. NIRR 07/10/95

Some 25% of clergywomen and 20% of clergymen have been divorced at least once, a survey
of clergy in a wide range of denominations found. The figures approximate the national
divorce rate. The national survey, conducted by Hartford Seminary in 1993 and 1994, found
that clergywomen were much more likely to have been divorced before entering the ministry
than male clergy. At the top of the divorced-clergy list were the Unitarian-Universalists (47%
of women and 44% of men) and the Episcopal Church (30% and 25% respectively). Among
Southern Baptists, it was 17% of women and 4% of men. Many conservative denominations
rarely permit divorced persons to be pastors. NIRR 07/10/95

Three prayer ministries are joining to form a World Prayer Center in Colorado Springs. The
center will "network existing networks" globally, New Life Church pastor Ted Haggard told
NIRR. The three ministries plan to have a separate but cooperative relationship. They are:
The Christian Information Network, sponsored by Haggard's church; Global Harvest
Ministries, led by C. Peter Wagner, a Fuller Theological Seminary professor and director of
the A.D. 2000 United Prayer Track in Pasadena, Calif.; and the Sentinel Group of Lynnwood,
Wash., led by researcher George Otis, Jr. Construction of a $3 million building for the center
on the grounds of New Life Church is set for September. Wagner also will teach at Fuller's
extension school, which is expected to open in the World Prayer Center in spring 1997.

A church can give away condoms in a  park as part of its annual basketball tournament, a
New York state judge ruled. The judge restricted distribution by All Saints Lutheran Church,
located in the Bronx, to youths over 16 who requested them. He prohibited advertising and
the use of an anatomically-correct model to demonstrate condom use. City officials had
banned the giveaway. 
<BR>...There are acts that are offensive to some people and shouldn't be pushed on them in public
places, city attorneys argued. Pastor David Kalke said he is concerned about the spread of
AIDS and wants to convince young people that condom use is socially acceptable.

A pastor was arrested and detained overnight after intervening in a brawl between police and
some 100 churchgoers. It started when neighbors petitioned police to do something about the
double and triple-parking in streets around Elim National Fellowship Church in Brooklyn,
N.Y. After police began ticketing the cars during a Friday-night service, worshipers streamed
out of the church to protest. Several women assaulted the officers, and reinforcements were
called in. Officials said four officers received minor injuries. Pastor H. Curtis Douglass said
police roughed him up when he refused to move. He was charged with harassment and
resisting arrest. 
<BR>..."We have nowhere else to park," Douglass said. City officials said the incident underscores
a worsening problem in neighborhoods that have large churches. Illegal parking not only
inconveniences residents but impedes emergency vehicles, they noted.

An Orange County, N.Y., prosecutor violated a woman's rights when he forced her to swear
on a Bible in a Catholic Church that she didn't sexually abuse her son, a federal judge ruled.
That amounted to a government-sponsored religious exercise, the judge said. He refused to
dismiss a lawsuit the woman brought against the prosecutor, Gerald D'Amelia, and ordered
the case to trial. The woman's estranged husband had accused her of abusing her teen-age
son; she and the son denied the allegation. D'Amelia told her to take the oath or face trial. He
dropped the charges after the woman's pledge, made in the presence of relatives and two
priests.

The four Oklahoma City churches damaged by the April 19 bombing are not eligible for
federal aid, officials said. However, churches and religious nonprofits that incurred expenses
to aid the response or that perform essential services of a governmental nature might qualify
for reimbursement, they suggested. Among the churches denied aid was First United
Methodist, which served as a morgue after the bombing (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/050195.html">NIRR 5/1</A>). The church requested
funds to replace its lobby carpet and to fill holes in its parking lot where officials drove tent
stakes to erect operations centers. Officials told pastor Nick Harris that they could not help
because of the separation of church and state.

A threat to Liberty University's accreditation has ended. The Southern Association of
Colleges and Schools withdrew the "warning" status placed on Liberty a year ago because the
school's financial resources were inadequate. An accreditation board member said recent
erasure of a $30-million debt influenced the group's decision. Two supporters of the
university forgave that amount after purchasing bonds at discount prices from Liberty
creditors (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/020695.html">NIRR 2/6</A>).

Family guests at Disney World on June 2-4 got a surprise. Some 35,000 homosexuals and
lesbians attended an event known as the Fifth Annual Gay and Lesbian Days. Although
Disney does not subsidize the event, in previous years it had posted signs at the gates
announcing the presence of the group, which is sponsored by the Gay and Lesbian
Community Services of Central Florida. But there were no signs this year, and families with
young children ventured in unaware, according to World magazine. The publication said
pressure from homosexuals, who claimed they were singled out, convinced Disney to omit the
signs.

The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a challenge to a child-pornography law that aims to prevent
use of minors in sexually explicit films, videotapes, and photographs. The law imposes
record-keeping and disclosure requirements on producers of such material. Although Congress
passed the Child Protection Restoration and Penalties Enhancement Act in 1990, it never was
enforced because of several legal challenges. However, the Supreme Court's action has
cleared the way for enforcement.

Jews for Jesus volunteers are handing out 1 million gospel tracts on the streets of New York
City this month. The tracts invite people to respond directly, by writing, on the telephone, or

advertising campaign on the subways and on secular radio. In the 1994 New York campaign,
413 people became believers. Volunteers, who are used to being ignored or insulted as they
hand out tracts on the streets, are "getting a lot more serious questions" in the last few years,
spokesperson Susan Perlman said.

U.S. Catholic bishops urged Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) to retain welfare

Indonesia: Scores of attackers broke into a parsonage in Binjai in northern Sumatra and
severely beat a clergyman and his wife and three children. Church officials linked the attack
to violence between two factions in the 2.5-million member Batak Protestant Church (NIRR
6/27/94). At issue is the 1992 appointment of P.W.T. Simanjuntak as bishop, a move opposed
as a government choice by supporters of the incumbent, S.A.E. Nababan. Ten people have

France: The National Assembly voted to exclude abortion protesters from an amnesty bill
proposed by the government. Such measures traditionally pardon petty lawbreakers following
presidential elections. Under this year's amnesty, about 1,500 people will be released from

attacks on abortion clinics. They said releasing such protesters would only encourage further
assaults on clinics.

Germany: Parliament passed a compromise measure that declares most abortions illegal but
permits it in the first trimester if a woman seeks counseling first. It also allows abortions in
cases of rape and physical danger to the prospective mother. The measure meshes the strict

the former East Germany.

Greece: Two leaders and a "high priestess" of a satanic cult that conducted human sacrifices
on the outskirts of Athens were sentenced to life imprisonment. They were found guilty of

ceremonies. The three, all in their early 20s, confessed they led a 20-member satanic cult.
They testified that the devil was behind all the evils they performed. They also said they had

The church in Cambodia -- ripped apart by decades of regional strife, genocide, and civil war
-- has begun the process of reconciliation. Fifty religious leaders from 10 provinces gathered
in Phnom Penh to participate in "holistic prayer" for the nation, John Robb of World Vision
International told NIRR. The method involves praying for economic, political, and spiritual
needs, and for the church. During the two-day conference, the participants -- who were
supported by a team of 11 intercessors from seven nations -- prayed for unreached people in
Cambodia, unity among churches, and healing for war victims. 
<BR>...Many leaders confessed sins dating back to the "killing fields," one of the most savage eras
of the century. In the mid-1970s, the Marxist Khmer Rouge slaughtered former military
personnel, civil servants, educated or wealthy people, and their families, then turned the
nation into a vast labor camp. Cambodians also suffered greatly during the Vietnam War and
a civil war that raged between four contending armies until 1991. At the prayer summit,
"there was a lot of weeping and ready acceptance and forgiveness," Robb said. He said that in
the weeks after the conference, he has seen an encouraging amount of reconciliation among
Christian workers. Leaders are "thrilled with joy and anticipation about what God is doing,"
and are considering forming a national evangelical fellowship, he said. 
<BR>...Prayer-walks through Phnom Penh and several other regions of Cambodia followed the
prayer summit. Pastors, supported by the prayer team, laid a map of Cambodia on the ground
and poured water on it as a symbol of cleansing. As they prayed over the map, curious
children came and knelt nearby. "I felt as if the Lord was saying, `I want this generation to
experience My peace and reconciliation, and be free from the curse of idolatry and war,'"
Robb said. NIRR 6/26/95

Vietnamese government leaders, foreign diplomats, doctors, and teachers heard Christian
opera performed at the Hanoi Opera House May 26. About 500 people attended the event
hosted by Children's Cup International, a relief and development agency. Although the
concert was "clearly, openly Christian," there was "zero negative response," Children's Cup
President Dave Ohlerking told NIRR. One official requested more concerts, he said. All
proceeds and donations benefited the pediatrics ward of Hanoi's Viet Duc Hospital. 
<BR>...Donations, many of which came from American Vietnam War veterans and their families,
covered the costs of the concert. Many veterans help Vietnamese children because it fosters
healing of scars from the war, Ohlerking said. One veteran donated money to help children in
the same region where North Vietnamese soldiers tortured him. "He found that the best way
to end the war in his own heart was to help the children there go on living," Ohlerking said.
Founded in 1992, the Eagle Grove, Iowa-based ministry has shipped about $500,000 worth of
medical supplies and relief equipment to developing countries. Vietnam is important to
Ohlerking, a former Assemblies of God missionary, because he was in Saigon in April 1975
when it fell to the Communists. "I made a commitment to come back," he said. NIRR 6/26/95

Despite his earlier illness, Billy Graham preached well during the final two nights of Mission
Ontario and "did not seem at all diminished," Jack Charleson, chairman of the executive
committee for the crusade (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/061295.html">NIRR 6/12</A>), told NIRR. The crusade "in many ways exceeded our
expectations," he said. More than 260,000 people attended the five-day crusade, setting a
Toronto Skydome record of 68,500 the final night, Charleson said. Some 60% of the 16,000
people who responded to the altar calls were under age 25. Ralph Bell, an Ontario native and
associate evangelist with the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, preached the first three
nights.  
<BR>...Doctors still are unsure what caused Graham to bleed internally during the recent crusade.
The serious bleeding weakened Graham, 76, who required multiple blood transfusions. The
Associated Press quoted Graham's son Franklin as saying his father was "the sickest he's
been in recent years" and that he lost "about a third of his blood" before being hospitalized.
On Graham's release from Toronto East General Hospital June 14, doctors said there was no
sign of cancer in the colon or stomach, but further tests were needed to rule out other
diseases of the small intestine. Doctors speculated that aspirin consumption may have
contributed to the gastrointestinal bleeding. They recommended Graham be re-examined next
month by his regular doctors and that he cancel most speaking engagements for the next three
months. 
<BR>...Graham's hospitalization enhanced media coverage of Mission Ontario, Charleson said. One
television station that Charleson said is "generally against" publicizing such events conducted
interviews at the crusade. The Toronto Star ran full-color photos of Graham, pushing
coverage of the upcoming provincial elections off the front page, Charleson said. Even at the
hospital, Graham's illness had an impact. Thirty nurses attended the Saturday service at the
evangelist's request, the BGEA said. One nurse's son became a Christian, Charleson said.

The prayers of 40 children added an unusual dimension to the Global Consultation On World
Evangelism, May 17-25 in Seoul, South Korea (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/061295.html">NIRR 6/12</A>). The children came from around
the world to pray for revival. 
<BR>...The children were the youngest delegates. Ages 6 to 15, they sometimes prayed for four
hours at a time, Esther Ilnisky of Esther Network International, a ministry to children, told
NIRR. They laid hands on adult leaders and prayed over them, she said. Many of the children
had visions, according to Ryan Collins, 11, a delegate from Houston, Texas. They were
"commissioned to give children (in their countries) the anointing" to pray and preach, he told
NIRR. Subsequently, Collins has spoken at Houston-area churches, where has told children
"they should not let older people look down on them, but do exactly what adults do." Collins
said his blessing from Korea "is getting stronger." 
<BR>..."All children who love the Lord and whose spiritual potential is nurtured would be like
this," Ilnisky said. "Few adults recognize what is in the children." In three years, the Esther
Network International has mobilized 1 million children ages 12 and younger around the world
to pray for their generation. Parents or Sunday school teachers return forms to the West Palm
Beach, Fla., ministry indicating the child's commitment to pray regularly. The group supplies
educational and motivational materials. For information, call (407) 832-6490. NIRR 6/26/95

Most churches aren't prepared to handle the societal changes occurring in their backyards,
Jack Dennison of Discipling A Whole Nation Ministries told NIRR. The Colorado Springs
group, known for developing church-planting strategies in foreign nations, also is focusing on
the United States. Many U.S. congregations, particularly those 20 years old and older, are
"too inbred to change with the changing needs of the community," he said. For example,
churches often use a standard approach that emphasizes content at a time when young people
respond more readily to a relationship approach, he said. 
<BR>...Christians must expand their concept of the church to include house churches, cell churches,
satellite churches, and multi-congregational churches, Dennison said. In some places,
small-group ministries fizzled when they became "ingrown and non-evangelistic" or failed to
provide the "depth of community that many wanted." By contrast, the house-church
movement, in which groups meet in homes and lay people take responsibility for ministries,
"provides the best expectation of community and evangelism," he said. NIRR 6/26/95

An expected 30 million people will focus their prayers in October on 100 key cities in the
region known as the 10/40 Window. Praying Through the Window II, part of the AD 2000

21 million Christians resulted in "significant breakthroughs" for evangelism in 60 countries,
coordinator Mark Wilson of The Christian Broadcasting Network told NIRR. Targeted nations
stretch from West Africa to East Asia, between 10 and 40 degrees north of the equator. The
area is overwhelmingly Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist. Only 8% of Christian missionaries
work in the area. 
<BR>...Prayer teams will fan out to spiritually, economically, and politically strategic cities.

Creditors in the multi-million-dollar collapse of the Foundation for New Era Philanthropy
(<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/061265.html">NIRR 6/12</A>) planned to meet for the first time June 26. They include hundreds of evangelical
ministries and colleges, dozens with more than $1 million each in net cash losses. On the
agenda at the Philadelphia meeting: a vote to retain or replace the interim bankruptcy trustee;
accounting reports; and determination of a method for judging who is owed how much.
Interim trustee John Carroll, III, released an initial list of winners and losers in New Era's
alleged pyramid scheme of matching grants. Investigators said New Era made grants to early
depositors with funds from subsequent depositors. New Era head John "Jack" Bennett, Jr.,
said the grants came from anonymous donors. New Era lawyers say the donors never existed. 
<BR>...Carroll used a method that dramatically restructures the list of creditors and their voting
power. If a nonprofit received grants from New Era totaling more than the current amount on
deposit, it is not owed any money, he theorized. Those remaining were listed with a net cash
loss: deposits minus grants received. Grants promised but not received were excluded as
debts. Carroll also suggested that individual donors who had placed money in the New Era
program should be removed from the creditors list, since their funds were intended to go to
charities anyway. Under his suggested plan, groups in a positive cash position would be asked
to return the difference between what they deposited and what they received. Lawyers for
some former creditors said they will object to Carroll's methodology. Carroll insisted the plan
is fair, simplifies matters, and will preserve assets from excessive litigation costs.  
<BR>...Creditors with a net cash loss on Carroll's initial list include: Christian Camps and
Conferences ($500,000); Conservative Baptist Home Mission Society ($1.13 million); The
Evangelical Alliance Mission ($1 million); Haggai Institute ($1.5 million); Harvey Cedars
Bible Conference ($750,000); International Missions ($1.62 million); International Teams
($2.5 million); Luis Palau Evangelistic Association ($1 million); Mission Aviation Fellowship
($1.47 million); Operation Mobilization ($1.55 million); Ravi Zacharias International
Ministries ($525,000); Rescue Mission Alliance ($1.2 million); The Salvation Army ($1
million); Scripture Union ($1.7 million); Send International ($1.5 million); SIM USA ($1
million); United World Mission ($1.45 million); Walk Thru the Bible Ministries ($1 million);
World Concern ($2 million); World Harvest Mission ($1.1 million); World Radio Missionary
Fellowship ($1.2 million); World Vision ($1 million); Young Life ($2.5 million). 
<BR>...Schools on the list include: Biblical Seminary ($1.18 million); Covenant College ($1.15
million); Eastern Baptist Seminary ($1 million); Eastern College ($750,000); Gordon-Conwell
Seminary ($1 million); Houghton College ($1.5 million); John Brown University ($2 million);
Messiah College ($2 million); Phila. College of Bible ($1.34 million); Spring Arbor College
($1.1 million); United Seminary ($1.75 million); Wheaton College ($1.55 million). 
<BR>...A number of Christian organizations announced they will return New Era money, even
funds already spent, because it is the moral thing to do. However, some groups said they are
in dire straits, with no hope of making paybacks. For example, Market Street Mission in
Morristown, N.J., spent its promised grant for expansion projects before receiving the money.
Now it can't make loan payments on the new facilities. "We don't have enough money to
keep going," director David Scott told The Wall Street Journal. 
<BR>...Still other groups are taking a wait-and-see approach. Hans Finzel, foreign missions chief at
Conservative Baptist headquarters in Wheaton, Ill., acknowledged that his agency had a net
gain of more than $2 million. But it's gone now, and it will be difficult to raise payback
funds, he told NIRR. Finzel said he hopes the payback will be prorated and payable over
several years. Under federal law, all money received in the year prior to the bankruptcy filing
must be returned. Pennsylvania law in the New Era case covers funds received in the
preceding two years. 
<BR>...Christian broadcaster David Mains of Wheaton said his ministry entered into a joint
arrangement with Scripture Union. In anticipation of a New Era grant, his group spent
$225,000 on new projects. To help finance the outlay, he took out a mortgage on his home.
The New Era bankruptcy in mid-May resulted in a crisis at Mains' headquarters, forcing
cutbacks in staff and outreach. But creditors and supporters have been understanding and
gracious, he said. "It's been painful, but I'm trusting in Christ as never before. He has a way
through this maze." NIRR 6/26/95

Dozens of waiters, waitresses, bartenders, hostesses, cooks, and restaurant managers have
come to faith in Christ in Lexington, Ky., because of the evangelistic fervor of Pete Hise.
Four years ago, he started a Bible study among young men working at a local Applebee's
Neighborhood Bar and Grill, where he waited on tables while attending Asbury Theological
Seminary. "They were smoking, chewing, and drinking beer -- it was an interesting Bible
study," Hise told Alliance Life magazine. The group began meeting weekly, and "before long
we had a room full of Christians." 
<BR>...Hise still focuses much of his ministry on restaurant workers, even though he left the
Applebee's job when he took the pastorate at First Alliance Church. He often dines at
Lexington restaurants in order to witness, and has established a reputation as "someone who
has answers and who is willing to listen," said Scott Burson, director of communications at
Asbury. Six study groups Hise started meet at apartments, and his wife, Jacki, leads a
women's study. Some 50-60 people have come to Christ in the last year as a result of their
ministry, Burson said. There is one danger in the ministry, Hise told the magazine. "I've
gained 30 pounds." NIRR 6/26/95

Only 5% of physically disabled people attend church -- and the church is incomplete without
them, said Michael Lynch, executive director of JAF Ministries (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/041795.html">NIRR 4/17</A>). "God intends
disabled people to know Christ and be involved in the body of Christ," Lynch said. Spiritual
gifts -- including those of evangelist and teacher -- are as diverse among disabled people as
they are among the general population, he said. When churches reach out to them, the
congregations almost always receive more blessings than they give, Lynch said. 
<BR>...More than 80% of marriages in which there is a disability in the family end in divorce,
usually because extreme emotional, physical, and financial pressures provoke the husband to
leave, Lynch said. In the resulting single-parent family, members tend to shy away from
church and stay home on Sundays unless some congregation reaches out to them.

deplorable sin...lament and repudiate historical acts of evil such as slavery...apologize and ask
forgiveness of our African-American brothers and sisters...and commit ourselves to eradicate
racism in all its forms from Southern Baptist life and ministry." The resolution also addressed
the failure of many Southern Baptists to support the "legitimate initiatives to secure the civil
rights of African-Americans" in more recent times. 
<BR>...A roaring standing ovation greeted passage of the resolution. Gary Frost, a vice president of

A Boston veterans group should be allowed to decide what messages to include and exclude
in its St. Patrick's Day Parade, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled. The court said the South
Boston Allied War Veterans Council, sponsor of the parade since 1947, should not have been
forced to let a homosexual group participate (NIRR 3/8/93). The sponsor canceled the 1994
parade after court orders forced it to open the event to gay and lesbian groups in 1992 and
1993. This year, the sponsor adopted new standards: participation would be by invitation only,
and the Catholic-oriented parade would commemorate the role of traditional families in Irish
history. The 1995 parade was an expressive activity protected by association and free-speech
rights, the court said. 
<BR>...Also, the court rejected a challenge to the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act,
saying the law does not infringe on free-speech rights. The case involved Concerned Women
for America member Joyce Woodall, who was arrested after kneeling to pray at a door to a
Falls Church, Va., abortion clinic. Eight trial judges and two appeals courts upheld FACE, but
a Wisconsin judge declared it unconstitutional. The court also let stand an Arkansas decision
against a Little Rock couple who displayed millions of lights as part of their Christmas

Salt Lake City high school students and their parents defied a federal appeals court order and
sang a religious song at graduation. A lawsuit by sophomore choir member Rachel
Bauchman, who is Jewish, had prompted the Denver-based court to bar West High School's
choir from singing The Lord Bless You and Keep You and Friends, traditionally performed at
the school's commencements. Instead, the choir sang two secular pieces. 
<BR>...But then, graduating senior Will Badger, a Mormon, took the microphone and asked
everyone to sing Friends, which includes the line, "Friends are friends forever if the Lord is
the Lord of them." Badger said, "We sing it not as Christians, Jews, or Muslims. We sing it
as it was meant to be sung, as friends." As the principal tried to hush the crowd, most choir
members, graduating students, and audience members sang the lyrics, which students
distributed in advance, news reports said. A police officer escorted Badger from the podium.

reeling from debt. According to Christianity Today, the organization lost more than $1 million
after the failure of two costly initiatives: the Church Satellite Network, which recruited
"magnet" churches to receive satellite telecasts of seminars, and Data Mirror, a computerized
consulting system. The association owes $1.5 million to creditors, CT said. The Pasadena,
Calif.-based firm has dismissed two of its top executives.

Some 10,000 Christians are expected to participate in three days of fasting and prayer for the
nation Nov. 15-18. Campus Crusade for Christ founder Bill Bright and other leaders are
hosting the event in Los Angeles. Bright, who fasted for 40 days last summer, wrote The
Coming Revival, which describes the benefits of an extended fast. 
<BR>...During a meeting of 700 Christian leaders in Orlando, Fla., last December, Bright asked the
group to pray for 2 million Americans to fast for 40 days (NIRR 12/26/94). For information

Trampolines and techno music were among the attractions that drew thousands of people to
hear the gospel this spring in 60 towns across California, Oregon, and Colorado. Between 500
and 1,000 people a week made commitments to Christ during the outreach, part of Youth
With A Mission's Impact World Tour, a six-year initiative to take the gospel across the
country. Local churches work with YWAM teams to stage meetings in schools and
community centers. Plans are under way for similar evangelistic tours in Australia, India, and
Scandinavia. The program included martial arts and speakers. "There is no gift God has given
He doesn't want us to use," extrampoline champion Max Dempsey said.

An Illinois woman who sought counseling from a Catholic priest, and later from a retired
Lutheran minister, said she was seduced by both, according to news accounts. Barbara
Colarelli sought counseling with James Chang, a Benedictine monk regarding her relationship
with her daughter. Chang seduced her in 1985, she said, convincing her that sex would be
therapeutic. When the relationship ended in 1987, she began counseling with Paul Swanson,
and soon confided in him about Chang. Within months, Swanson had sex with her, she said.
Colarelli settled lawsuits against both men.

In addition to the nationally televised prayer meeting at Moody Memorial Church (NIRR
5/15), two other important gatherings took place in Chicago in May. Some 110 prominent
church leaders discussed evidences of a coming revival and their plans for the future at the

Egypt: A Cairo appeals court annulled the marriage of a university literature professor. The
court said Nasr Hamed Abu Seid's writings showed he was an apostate from Islam and
therefore could not remain married to a Muslim. Among other things, Abu Seid's writings
accuse Muslim clerics of quoting the Koran out of context and making factual errors. Abu
Seid said he and his wife are happily married. The couple must live apart.

South Africa: Ten thousand Christians marched in Cape Town protesting a proposal to declare
the country a secular state, Ecumenical News International said. Christian fundamentalists
called for a "Bible-based" constitution, while other Christians want no preference given to any
group. The state should "affirm those of different religions and those who have none," said an
aide for Desmond Tutu, the Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town.

China: House-church Christians will receive 5 million Bibles over the next five years from a
joint effort between East Gates Ministries International and China's official church. EGMI, a
ministry to Chinese Christians since 1979, signed an agreement with the Chinese Christian
Council, an arm of the Three Self Patriotic Movement, for its Amity Press to produce the
Bibles. EGMI will cover costs and distribution, President Nelson Graham told NIRR. 
<BR>...The Bibles will be printed in Nanjing and shipped to distribution points in 22 of China's 30
provinces. Of the 35-50 million Christians in the country, about 15 million have Bibles. For
every Bible EGMI provides, there are four to 10 more requests, Graham said. 
<BR>...Since smuggled Bibles are illegal, it is important that house-church Christians have a "safer
and more efficient means of obtaining Bibles," Graham said. EGMI worked "openly and
transparently" with the government and the church, Graham said. By developing relationships
with those who oversee religious matters, EGMI persuaded them that "the Word of God is a
great asset" in China's changing society, he said.

Israel: Despite Orthodox Jewish protesters outside, the new McDonald's restaurant in
Jerusalem is doing brisk business, news reports said. The Orthodox oppose McDonald's
meat-and-cheese combos and other non-kosher dishes. McDonald's said the chain wants to

McDonald's surveys showed that many people wanted a regular McDonald's.

Pakistan: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said separate electorates for non-Muslim minorities
is a form of apartheid. She called for a more equitable method. The system isolates Christian
and other religious groups, preventing them from "having an effective voice in the political

Argentina: A proposed law would worsen inequality against Protestants, church leaders said.
Under the Worship Law, non-Catholic places of worship would be regulated in the same way
as businesses. Also, Protestants would have to provide detailed reports about pastors, church
activities, and finances. Church leaders said this would hamper expansion and subject
churches to the whims of bureaucrats. By law, the Catholic Church is exempt from regulation
by the government. Protestants account for 7% of Argentina's 2.5 million people.

Brazil: Evangelist Sammy Tippit called Brazilians to revival and evangelism. Some 28,000
people attended his two-day crusade in Rio de Janeiro last month, organizers said. It followed
a three-day spiritual-awakening conference for pastors and members of more than 100
congregations. At the meeting, Tippit emphasized holy living and personal evangelism. Some
1,000 people made decisions for Christ at the crusade, he said. In a similar event in Sao
Paulo, several hundred people became Christians, he said. Brazil is "one of the greatest
hunger spots in the world for the gospel," the San Antonio, Texas, evangelist told NIRR.
Tippit plans to preach at crusades in each state's capital by the year 2000 and crusades in
sections of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro every year.

6\12) and his sister, Ruth, stopped to ask directions in a small village. The woman who
answered the door immediately recognized them, and showed them a short-wave radio,
adorned with pictures of the Deynekas and their families. The woman became a Christian by
listening to Ruth's radio broadcasts from station HCJB in Quito, Ecuador, and corresponded
with her regularly. "Again and again people have told us" Christian radio was their "spiritual

Hungary: The country will restore millions of dollars of Jewish and Christian religious
property seized by Hungarian Nazi collaborators and later nationalized by the Communists.

<P>
Russia: Some Russian Orthodox priests are pressuring building owners to bar Protestants from
meeting on their properties, a Protestant radio producer who visited Moscow said. Those who
rent theaters or public auditoriums for evangelical services are threatened with "anathema," a
curse of excommunication, if they allow "heretics" to continue meeting there. Most owners
back down out of superstition, the producer said.

Russia: Crusade-like festivals in St. Petersburg and Moscow attracted 40,000 people to hear
the evangelistic message of Messianic Judaism, Hear O Israel Ministries (NIRR 11/28/94)
reported. Some 10,000, half of them Jews, prayed to become Christians, Ivy Hofmann of
HOIM told NIRR. The new believers will be discipled by local Messianic Jewish
congregations begun by similar outreach events in the past two years. The festivals consist of
"joyous praise and worship" followed by a gospel message. Jews in the former Soviet Union
are not biased against evangelistic preaching as are those in the West, said Jonathan Bernis, a
rabbi and executive director of the Rochester, N.Y.-based ministry.

Vatican: Catholic seminaries must do a better job of teaching future priests about marriage,

The church in Cambodia -- ripped apart by decades of regional strife, genocide, and civil war
-- has begun the process of reconciliation. Fifty religious leaders from 10 provinces gathered
in Phnom Penh to participate in "holistic prayer" for the nation, John Robb of World Vision
International told NIRR. The method involves praying for economic, political, and spiritual
needs, and for the church. During the two-day conference, the participants -- who were
supported by a team of 11 intercessors from seven nations -- prayed for unreached people in
Cambodia, unity among churches, and healing for war victims. 
<BR>...Many leaders confessed sins dating back to the "killing fields," one of the most savage eras
of the century. In the mid-1970s, the Marxist Khmer Rouge slaughtered former military
personnel, civil servants, educated or wealthy people, and their families, then turned the
nation into a vast labor camp. Cambodians also suffered greatly during the Vietnam War and
a civil war that raged between four contending armies until 1991. At the prayer summit,
"there was a lot of weeping and ready acceptance and forgiveness," Robb said. He said that in
the weeks after the conference, he has seen an encouraging amount of reconciliation among
Christian workers. Leaders are "thrilled with joy and anticipation about what God is doing,"
and are considering forming a national evangelical fellowship, he said. 
<BR>...Prayer-walks through Phnom Penh and several other regions of Cambodia followed the
prayer summit. Pastors, supported by the prayer team, laid a map of Cambodia on the ground
and poured water on it as a symbol of cleansing. As they prayed over the map, curious
children came and knelt nearby. "I felt as if the Lord was saying, `I want this generation to
experience My peace and reconciliation, and be free from the curse of idolatry and war,'"
Robb said. NIRR 6/26/95

Vietnamese government leaders, foreign diplomats, doctors, and teachers heard Christian
opera performed at the Hanoi Opera House May 26. About 500 people attended the event
hosted by Children's Cup International, a relief and development agency. Although the
concert was "clearly, openly Christian," there was "zero negative response," Children's Cup
President Dave Ohlerking told NIRR. One official requested more concerts, he said. All
proceeds and donations benefited the pediatrics ward of Hanoi's Viet Duc Hospital. 
<BR>...Donations, many of which came from American Vietnam War veterans and their families,
covered the costs of the concert. Many veterans help Vietnamese children because it fosters
healing of scars from the war, Ohlerking said. One veteran donated money to help children in
the same region where North Vietnamese soldiers tortured him. "He found that the best way
to end the war in his own heart was to help the children there go on living," Ohlerking said.
Founded in 1992, the Eagle Grove, Iowa-based ministry has shipped about $500,000 worth of
medical supplies and relief equipment to developing countries. Vietnam is important to
Ohlerking, a former Assemblies of God missionary, because he was in Saigon in April 1975
when it fell to the Communists. "I made a commitment to come back," he said. NIRR 6/26/95

Despite his earlier illness, Billy Graham preached well during the final two nights of Mission
Ontario and "did not seem at all diminished," Jack Charleson, chairman of the executive
committee for the crusade (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/061295.html">NIRR 6/12</A>), told NIRR. The crusade "in many ways exceeded our
expectations," he said. More than 260,000 people attended the five-day crusade, setting a
Toronto Skydome record of 68,500 the final night, Charleson said. Some 60% of the 16,000
people who responded to the altar calls were under age 25. Ralph Bell, an Ontario native and
associate evangelist with the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, preached the first three
nights.  
<BR>...Doctors still are unsure what caused Graham to bleed internally during the recent crusade.
The serious bleeding weakened Graham, 76, who required multiple blood transfusions. The
Associated Press quoted Graham's son Franklin as saying his father was "the sickest he's
been in recent years" and that he lost "about a third of his blood" before being hospitalized.
On Graham's release from Toronto East General Hospital June 14, doctors said there was no
sign of cancer in the colon or stomach, but further tests were needed to rule out other
diseases of the small intestine. Doctors speculated that aspirin consumption may have
contributed to the gastrointestinal bleeding. They recommended Graham be re-examined next
month by his regular doctors and that he cancel most speaking engagements for the next three
months. 
<BR>...Graham's hospitalization enhanced media coverage of Mission Ontario, Charleson said. One
television station that Charleson said is "generally against" publicizing such events conducted
interviews at the crusade. The Toronto Star ran full-color photos of Graham, pushing
coverage of the upcoming provincial elections off the front page, Charleson said. Even at the
hospital, Graham's illness had an impact. Thirty nurses attended the Saturday service at the
evangelist's request, the BGEA said. One nurse's son became a Christian, Charleson said.

The prayers of 40 children added an unusual dimension to the Global Consultation On World
Evangelism, May 17-25 in Seoul, South Korea (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/061295.html">NIRR 6/12</A>). The children came from around
the world to pray for revival. 
<BR>...The children were the youngest delegates. Ages 6 to 15, they sometimes prayed for four
hours at a time, Esther Ilnisky of Esther Network International, a ministry to children, told
NIRR. They laid hands on adult leaders and prayed over them, she said. Many of the children
had visions, according to Ryan Collins, 11, a delegate from Houston, Texas. They were
"commissioned to give children (in their countries) the anointing" to pray and preach, he told
NIRR. Subsequently, Collins has spoken at Houston-area churches, where has told children
"they should not let older people look down on them, but do exactly what adults do." Collins
said his blessing from Korea "is getting stronger." 
<BR>..."All children who love the Lord and whose spiritual potential is nurtured would be like
this," Ilnisky said. "Few adults recognize what is in the children." In three years, the Esther
Network International has mobilized 1 million children ages 12 and younger around the world
to pray for their generation. Parents or Sunday school teachers return forms to the West Palm
Beach, Fla., ministry indicating the child's commitment to pray regularly. The group supplies
educational and motivational materials. For information, call (407) 832-6490. NIRR 6/26/95

Most churches aren't prepared to handle the societal changes occurring in their backyards,
Jack Dennison of Discipling A Whole Nation Ministries told NIRR. The Colorado Springs
group, known for developing church-planting strategies in foreign nations, also is focusing on
the United States. Many U.S. congregations, particularly those 20 years old and older, are
"too inbred to change with the changing needs of the community," he said. For example,
churches often use a standard approach that emphasizes content at a time when young people
respond more readily to a relationship approach, he said. 
<BR>...Christians must expand their concept of the church to include house churches, cell churches,
satellite churches, and multi-congregational churches, Dennison said. In some places,
small-group ministries fizzled when they became "ingrown and non-evangelistic" or failed to
provide the "depth of community that many wanted." By contrast, the house-church
movement, in which groups meet in homes and lay people take responsibility for ministries,
"provides the best expectation of community and evangelism," he said. NIRR 6/26/95

An expected 30 million people will focus their prayers in October on 100 key cities in the
region known as the 10/40 Window. Praying Through the Window II, part of the AD 2000
and Beyond Movement, follows a similar event in 1993 (NIRR 11/1/93). Then, the prayers of
21 million Christians resulted in "significant breakthroughs" for evangelism in 60 countries,
coordinator Mark Wilson of The Christian Broadcasting Network told NIRR. Targeted nations
stretch from West Africa to East Asia, between 10 and 40 degrees north of the equator. The
area is overwhelmingly Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist. Only 8% of Christian missionaries
work in the area. 
<BR>...Prayer teams will fan out to spiritually, economically, and politically strategic cities.
Planners hope to send at least 100 intercessors to each city. For information, contact the
Christian Information Network at 11025 State Highway 83, Colorado Springs, CO, 80921, or

Christians in the United States, Canada, Latin America, and Europe will pray for revival in
their churches and cities, and for unreached parts of the world, on Oct. 21. March for Jesus,
Concerts of Prayer International, Mission America 2000, and other organizations are
co-sponsoring the simultaneous concerts of prayer. The concerts are part of the month-long
focus on cities in the Muslim world that is being sponsored by the AD 2000 and Beyond
Movement. 
<BR>...In the United States, Christians in up to 500 cities will hold prayer gatherings. Every South
American capital will hold a rally, and some rallies even are planned in Cuba, according to
David Bryant, founder of Concerts of Prayer. 
<BR>...A "spontaneous combustion" of desire to pray and to celebrate and worship God has taken
place, said Kai Adler, March for Jesus director of operations. "Everybody's longing for
revival. There is a sense of anticipation and excitement in the hearts of people." For an
information manual, training video, or brochure, call March for Jesus at (512) 416-0066.

Creditors in the multi-million-dollar collapse of the Foundation for New Era Philanthropy
(<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/061265.html">NIRR 6/12</A>) planned to meet for the first time June 26. They include hundreds of evangelical
ministries and colleges, dozens with more than $1 million each in net cash losses. On the
agenda at the Philadelphia meeting: a vote to retain or replace the interim bankruptcy trustee;
accounting reports; and determination of a method for judging who is owed how much.
Interim trustee John Carroll, III, released an initial list of winners and losers in New Era's
alleged pyramid scheme of matching grants. Investigators said New Era made grants to early
depositors with funds from subsequent depositors. New Era head John "Jack" Bennett, Jr.,
said the grants came from anonymous donors. New Era lawyers say the donors never existed. 
<BR>...Carroll used a method that dramatically restructures the list of creditors and their voting
power. If a nonprofit received grants from New Era totaling more than the current amount on
deposit, it is not owed any money, he theorized. Those remaining were listed with a net cash
loss: deposits minus grants received. Grants promised but not received were excluded as
debts. Carroll also suggested that individual donors who had placed money in the New Era
program should be removed from the creditors list, since their funds were intended to go to
charities anyway. Under his suggested plan, groups in a positive cash position would be asked
to return the difference between what they deposited and what they received. Lawyers for
some former creditors said they will object to Carroll's methodology. Carroll insisted the plan
is fair, simplifies matters, and will preserve assets from excessive litigation costs.  
<BR>...Creditors with a net cash loss on Carroll's initial list include: Christian Camps and
Conferences ($500,000); Conservative Baptist Home Mission Society ($1.13 million); The
Evangelical Alliance Mission ($1 million); Haggai Institute ($1.5 million); Harvey Cedars
Bible Conference ($750,000); International Missions ($1.62 million); International Teams
($2.5 million); Luis Palau Evangelistic Association ($1 million); Mission Aviation Fellowship
($1.47 million); Operation Mobilization ($1.55 million); Ravi Zacharias International
Ministries ($525,000); Rescue Mission Alliance ($1.2 million); The Salvation Army ($1

World Concern ($2 million); World Harvest Mission ($1.1 million); World Radio Missionary

<BR>...A number of Christian organizations announced they will return New Era money, even
funds already spent, because it is the moral thing to do. However, some groups said they are
in dire straits, with no hope of making paybacks. For example, Market Street Mission in
Morristown, N.J., spent its promised grant for expansion projects before receiving the money.
Now it can't make loan payments on the new facilities. "We don't have enough money to
keep going," director David Scott told The Wall Street Journal. 
<BR>...Still other groups are taking a wait-and-see approach. Hans Finzel, foreign missions chief at
Conservative Baptist headquarters in Wheaton, Ill., acknowledged that his agency had a net
gain of more than $2 million. But it's gone now, and it will be difficult to raise payback
funds, he told NIRR. Finzel said he hopes the payback will be prorated and payable over
several years. Under federal law, all money received in the year prior to the bankruptcy filing
must be returned. Pennsylvania law in the New Era case covers funds received in the
preceding two years. 
<BR>...Christian broadcaster David Mains of Wheaton said his ministry entered into a joint
arrangement with Scripture Union. In anticipation of a New Era grant, his group spent
$225,000 on new projects. To help finance the outlay, he took out a mortgage on his home.
The New Era bankruptcy in mid-May resulted in a crisis at Mains' headquarters, forcing
cutbacks in staff and outreach. But creditors and supporters have been understanding and
gracious, he said. "It's been painful, but I'm trusting in Christ as never before. He has a way
through this maze." NIRR 6/26/95

Dozens of waiters, waitresses, bartenders, hostesses, cooks, and restaurant managers have
come to faith in Christ in Lexington, Ky., because of the evangelistic fervor of Pete Hise.
Four years ago, he started a Bible study among young men working at a local Applebee's
Neighborhood Bar and Grill, where he waited on tables while attending Asbury Theological
Seminary. "They were smoking, chewing, and drinking beer -- it was an interesting Bible
study," Hise told Alliance Life magazine. The group began meeting weekly, and "before long
we had a room full of Christians." 
<BR>...Hise still focuses much of his ministry on restaurant workers, even though he left the
Applebee's job when he took the pastorate at First Alliance Church. He often dines at
Lexington restaurants in order to witness, and has established a reputation as "someone who
has answers and who is willing to listen," said Scott Burson, director of communications at
Asbury. Six study groups Hise started meet at apartments, and his wife, Jacki, leads a
women's study. Some 50-60 people have come to Christ in the last year as a result of their
ministry, Burson said. There is one danger in the ministry, Hise told the magazine. "I've
gained 30 pounds." NIRR 6/26/95

Only 5% of physically disabled people attend church -- and the church is incomplete without
them, said Michael Lynch, executive director of JAF Ministries (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/041795.html">NIRR 4/17</A>). "God intends
disabled people to know Christ and be involved in the body of Christ," Lynch said. Spiritual
gifts -- including those of evangelist and teacher -- are as diverse among disabled people as
they are among the general population, he said. When churches reach out to them, the
congregations almost always receive more blessings than they give, Lynch said. 
<BR>...More than 80% of marriages in which there is a disability in the family end in divorce,
usually because extreme emotional, physical, and financial pressures provoke the husband to
leave, Lynch said. In the resulting single-parent family, members tend to shy away from
church and stay home on Sundays unless some congregation reaches out to them. 
<BR>...A JAF manual on praying for disabled people, Interceding for a Handicapped World,
includes 31 days of devotionals, descriptions of debilitating diseases, and how to pray for
their sufferers. It also includes profiles of 12 disabled "prayer warriors" and notes obstacles

Southern Baptists apologized for separating from their Northern religious kin 150 years ago in
a bitter dispute over slavery. SBC representatives meeting in Atlanta before the start of their
138th annual convention said they "unwaveringly denounce racism, in all its forms, as
deplorable sin...lament and repudiate historical acts of evil such as slavery...apologize and ask
forgiveness of our African-American brothers and sisters...and commit ourselves to eradicate
racism in all its forms from Southern Baptist life and ministry." The resolution also addressed
the failure of many Southern Baptists to support the "legitimate initiatives to secure the civil
rights of African-Americans" in more recent times. 
<BR>...A roaring standing ovation greeted passage of the resolution. Gary Frost, a vice president of
the convention, who is black, said he accepted the apology and called on those assembled to

A Boston veterans group should be allowed to decide what messages to include and exclude
in its St. Patrick's Day Parade, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled. The court said the South
Boston Allied War Veterans Council, sponsor of the parade since 1947, should not have been
forced to let a homosexual group participate (NIRR 3/8/93). The sponsor canceled the 1994
parade after court orders forced it to open the event to gay and lesbian groups in 1992 and
1993. This year, the sponsor adopted new standards: participation would be by invitation only,
and the Catholic-oriented parade would commemorate the role of traditional families in Irish
history. The 1995 parade was an expressive activity protected by association and free-speech
rights, the court said. 
<BR>...Also, the court rejected a challenge to the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act,
saying the law does not infringe on free-speech rights. The case involved Concerned Women
for America member Joyce Woodall, who was arrested after kneeling to pray at a door to a
Falls Church, Va., abortion clinic. Eight trial judges and two appeals courts upheld FACE, but
a Wisconsin judge declared it unconstitutional. The court also let stand an Arkansas decision
against a Little Rock couple who displayed millions of lights as part of their Christmas
celebration (NIRR 12/26/94). The state supreme court ruled the display was a public nuisance
and ordered Jennings and Mitzi Osborne to forego most of the lights. He is a Baptist, she is a

The city of Clearwater, Fla., and several religious groups settled an 11-year legal battle over a
city ordinance. It required religious and other charitable organizations to maintain fund-raising
records that were subject to subpoena if 10 or more individuals accused an organization of

Many of the top donors to the Japan-based Aum Shinri Kyo cult are dead or missing,

group $165 million in real estate and cash. Former members say the cult pressured them to
hand over their money and possessions. The cult was implicated in the gas attack on Tokyo
subways in March that killed 12 people and sickened 5,000. It was involved in a string of
other crimes, including the serious wounding of the National Police Agency chief and a jet
hijacking, officials said. Many cult leaders, including guru Shoko Asahara, have been arrested,

he and SBC policy adviser Richard Land were the lone voices calling for retention of the
anti-abortion plank in the party platform. Colson said he told GOP leaders: "You leave us,

from requiring abortion instruction in obstetrics/gynecology training; and ban so-called

Salt Lake City high school students and their parents defied a federal appeals court order and
sang a religious song at graduation. A lawsuit by sophomore choir member Rachel
Bauchman, who is Jewish, had prompted the Denver-based court to bar West High School's
choir from singing The Lord Bless You and Keep You and Friends, traditionally performed at
the school's commencements. Instead, the choir sang two secular pieces. 
<BR>...But then, graduating senior Will Badger, a Mormon, took the microphone and asked
everyone to sing Friends, which includes the line, "Friends are friends forever if the Lord is
the Lord of them." Badger said, "We sing it not as Christians, Jews, or Muslims. We sing it
as it was meant to be sung, as friends." As the principal tried to hush the crowd, most choir
members, graduating students, and audience members sang the lyrics, which students
distributed in advance, news reports said. A police officer escorted Badger from the podium. 
<BR>...School administrators later said students who sang would be disciplined, and that they were
studying videotapes to identify offenders. But school board member Roger Thompson said
students had not violated the law because school authorities, not students, were under the

The church should abandon the phrase "living in sin" and tolerate couples who live together
outside of marriage, a Church of England study says. It acknowledges the centrality of
marriage in church teaching, and says this belief need not be modified just because more

marriage," living together in a lifelong, exclusive commitment "may be a legitimate form of
marriage." The report can provoke "debate and soul searching," but is not "the church's

Air Force Capt. Scott O'Grady, acclaimed for his survival skills and calm nerves during the

John Collins, a Catholic priest who is chaplain to the Air Wing at Italy's Aviano Air Force

"glaring, irreconcilable conflict with Navy policy." At his hearing, the government asked
Carkhuff about his relationship with the Promise Keepers men's movement. He told the board
his religious views require him to obey his superiors' commands as long as they don't

hunger spots in the world for the gospel," the San Antonio, Texas, evangelist told NIRR.
Tippit plans to preach at crusades in each state's capital by the year 2000 and crusades in
sections of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro every year.

Colombia: The bodies of New Tribes missionaries Stephen Welsh and Tim Van Dyke (NIRR
7/25/94) were found by a military patrol on June 19. They had been held hostage since Jan.
16, 1994. The soldiers found them after a skirmish with anti-government guerrillas. Four
other missionaries still are being held hostage by the guerrillas (NIRR 2/7/94), press reports
said.

Belarus: In search of their parents' birthplace, Peter Deyneka of Russian Ministries (NIRR
6\12) and his sister, Ruth, stopped to ask directions in a small village. The woman who
answered the door immediately recognized them, and showed them a short-wave radio,
adorned with pictures of the Deynekas and their families. The woman became a Christian by
listening to Ruth's radio broadcasts from station HCJB in Quito, Ecuador, and corresponded
with her regularly. "Again and again people have told us" Christian radio was their "spiritual
lifeline" during communism, Peter said.   
<P>
Hungary: The country will restore millions of dollars of Jewish and Christian religious
property seized by Hungarian Nazi collaborators and later nationalized by the Communists.
Prime Minister Gyula Horn said any of the more than 5,000 pieces of property that cannot be
returned over the next decade will be paid for within 20 years.
<P>
Russia: Some Russian Orthodox priests are pressuring building owners to bar Protestants from
meeting on their properties, a Protestant radio producer who visited Moscow said. Those who
rent theaters or public auditoriums for evangelical services are threatened with "anathema," a
curse of excommunication, if they allow "heretics" to continue meeting there. Most owners
back down out of superstition, the producer said. 
<P>
Russia: Crusade-like festivals in St. Petersburg and Moscow attracted 40,000 people to hear
the evangelistic message of Messianic Judaism, Hear O Israel Ministries (NIRR 11/28/94)
reported. Some 10,000, half of them Jews, prayed to become Christians, Ivy Hofmann of
HOIM told NIRR. The new believers will be discipled by local Messianic Jewish
congregations begun by similar outreach events in the past two years. The festivals consist of
"joyous praise and worship" followed by a gospel message. Jews in the former Soviet Union
are not biased against evangelistic preaching as are those in the West, said Jonathan Bernis, a
rabbi and executive director of the Rochester, N.Y.-based ministry.
<P>
Slovakia: Some 400 young people will pledge to remain chaste until marriage as a gift to
Pope John Paul II during his visit at the end of this month, Catholic officials said. An
estimated 70% of the population is Catholic.
<P>
Ukraine: Political authorities asked a CoMission team in Sumy to leave, the ministry reported.
Though legitimately invited in January, the team has been under "constant and severe
pressure" from the authorities since it arrived. The missionaries will join another CoMission
team elsewhere in the Commonwealth of Independent States.
<P>
Vatican: Catholic seminaries must do a better job of teaching future priests about marriage,
family, and sexuality, a Vatican study said. Interpretations of Church doctrine on the topics
often are faulty or non-existent, the Congregation for Catholic Education said. The study cited
a shortage of skilled seminary teachers.

Nearly 4,000 of the world's evangelical leaders have pledged to aggressively take on new
challenges and opportunities to evangelize mankind. The leaders, meeting May 17-25 in
Seoul, South Korea, at the Global Consultation On World Evangelism '95, affirmed the
ambitious goal of establishing a church-planting movement among every people group in the
world by the turn of the century (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/052995.html">NIRR 5/29</A>).  
<BR>...The massive scope of the task energized and unified delegates. "We came together around a
vision created in us by the command of Christ to make disciples of all nations," said Robert
Coleman of Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, reading from the conference declaration.
"This is the time for which we were born." As he read the declaration, Coleman began to
tremble with emotion, and the entire gathering "went wild" in a spontaneous response to the
contents, AD 2000 & Beyond Movement International Director Luis Bush told NIRR. 
<BR>...Brokenness, repentance, and reconciliation characterized the conference, Bush said. In the
plenary and working sessions, and in the prayer rooms, delegates from the 186 countries and
numerous denominations repented of sins and reconciled profound differences. Arab and
Jewish Christians repented of the hatred between their peoples, and embraced each other.
Delegates from Turkey and Armenia did the same. Japanese evangelist Paul Ariga knelt on
stage and asked forgiveness for World War II crimes against other Southeast Asians. Russian
Orthodox Bishop Christopher Tcamalaidze of Tbilisi, Georgia, asked forgiveness for his
church's persecution of evangelicals. "It was a miracle," said Thomas Wang, AD 2000's
international chairman of the board. "When things like that happen, you know it is a work of
the Holy Spirit." 
<BR>...Denominational leaders confessed their failure to work together and pledged more
cooperation in reaching GCOWE '95's goal. Leaders from the Southern Baptist Convention's
Foreign Missions Board pledged to share its research on 10,500 unreached people groups.
"We realized we can not do it by ourselves," Avery Willis of the board told NIRR. Other
leaders confessed to acting unilaterally, and promised to work together. 
<BR>...During the conference's 17 track sessions, leaders shared ideas for evangelizing people
groups, nations, regions, and continents. The priority is to plant at least one church for each
of the 2,300 unreached people groups in the 10/40 Window, Bush said. Leaders formed a
five-year evangelization schedule for churches and ministries, Wang said. Track sessions
became times for exchanging information and "rejoicing in what others were doing," said
Robert Bakke of the Evangelical Free Church of America. So much networking took place
that "it made the stock market look tame," Baptist Press said. NIRR 6/12/95

Six million Christians marched, sang, praised God, and prayed in the streets of 2,190 cities in
75 nations during the annual March for Jesus (NIRR 6/27/94). In Sao Paulo, Brazil, an
estimated 1.5 million people marched in April. In Guatemala, the number was 80,000, double
that of last year, organizers said. Thirty thousand marched in Papau New Guinea. In Burundi,
members of the opposing Hutu and Tutsi tribes marched side-by-side carrying banners
reading, "No Divisions in Jesus." In Canada, 90 marches drew 115,000 people. In Japan,
where people are "in the midst of darkness and insecurity" because of cultic terrorist attacks,
the march revealed "the differences between Christians, who live by the love of Christ," and
cultists, the coordinator said. 
<BR>...About 1 million believers marched in the streets of 600 U.S. cities. Most U.S. celebrations
took place May 27, but some were held on other days due to Memorial Day weekend. In
Atlanta, 87 people received Christ as more than 20,000 people marched. In Nashville, 40,000
marchers were led by a drum corps, community choir, 100 dancers, and hundreds of flags and
banners. Columbus, Ohio, had 20,000 marchers; Toledo, Ohio, 17,000; and Spokane, Wash.,
15,000. In Hilo, Hawaii, people came out of bars and wept as marchers passed, organizers
said. About 9,000 people marched in Oklahoma City, and a pastor whose church was across
the street from the site of the bombing spoke of "how the tragedy was being turned to glory
by the Lord." In Sioux Falls, S.D., a Satanist who came to Christ during the march two years
ago held a banner and led this year's march. In Ceres, Calif., young children led the march;
they wore white robes and waved palm branches. "Jesus was the glue that bound us together,"
said pastor David Nanod, march organizer in Kaukanakai, Hawaii. Marches are planned for
each year through the year 2000. NIRR 6/12/95

A May 26-27 Promise Keepers rally at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., drew 50,440 men
for 13  hours of spirited preaching, singing, and praying. Some 4,000 responded to evangelist
Luis Palau's altar call. Speakers challenged and inspired the crowd, and a men's band led the
mix of gospel, traditional, and salsa music. Men prayed together in clusters, and many wiped
tears from their eyes. At one point, thousands of pastors assembled in front of the stage and
up the aisles. Some wept as the crowd pronounced a blessing over them and let loose with a
thunderous, sustained ovation to encourage them. 
<BR>...Bill McCartney confessed to the crowd that for many years he had selfishly neglected the
needs of his wife, Lyndi, while obsessed with coaching football at the University of Colorado
and then with founding and running Promise Keepers. McCartney said he has repented,
received his wife's forgiveness, and dedicated himself to serving others. 
<BR>...Promise Keepers continues to pack stadiums (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/051595.html">NIRR 5/15</A>). The seven-point message at each
conference this summer is that "men of integrity" honor Jesus Christ; have close male friends;
practice spiritual, moral, and sexual purity; are faithful to wife and children; support the
church; defy racial and denominational barriers; and encourage the world to do the same.  
<BR>...PK attendance has grown from 4,200 men in 1991 to an expected 700,000 at 13 gatherings
this year. The staff and budget have doubled every six months for the last four years to $22
million yearly with 175 national staffers, seven state offices, and 11,000 local volunteers or
"point men," organizers said.  PK plans a rally of 1 million men on the Mall in Washington,
D.C., in 1997; the date was moved back from 1995 to avoid the appearance of political intent
in an election year. Also, the National Clergy Conference, a PK rally for 75,000 pastors at the
Georgia Dome in Atlanta, is set for Feb. 13-15, 1995. Scholarships for the pastors' conference
are available; for information, write Promise Keepers, P.O. Box 18376, Boulder, CO 80308.

Contemporary outreach events attracted 5,000 parents, youth, business and community
leaders, and singles during an April weekend in Hagerstown, Md. The interdenominational
effort among local churches, radio station WCRH, and New Jersey author, speaker, and radio
host Ron Hutchcraft resulted in 589 people coming to Christ. Events included contemporary
Christian music concerts, a workshop on practical parenting, and a seminar on how business
and community leaders can live peacefully in a stressful world. Hutchcraft spoke and gave
invitations at all the events. 
<BR>...Young people who accepted Christ during the weekend later watched a video containing
practical information about the Christian life. Adults who made commitments to Christ were
directed to local spiritual-issues discussion groups, Bible studies, and churches. For
information about Ron Hutchcraft Ministries, call (201) 695-2161. NIRR 6/12/95

Revival services in Melbourne, Fla., still are going strong (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/040395.html">NIRR 4/3</A>). Services started Jan. 1.
Since early April, 15,000 people have attended meetings held six days a week at the
1,000-seat Tabernacle Church, founded by the late Jamie Buckingham. Since then, about 200
people have become Christians as a result of the services, according to local church leader
Fred Grewe. Various pastors and worship leaders take turns leading the services, which
include physical healings and spontaneous "holy laughter." 
<BR>..."Everybody is exhausted, but God is manifesting His presence every night -- so we are
reluctant to stop," Grewe told NIRR. Participants are taking their renewed spiritual energy
back to their churches, observers said.  
<BR>..."A deep fraternity has grown in our community," Grewe said. Pastors from diverse
denominations join in worship, share testimonies, and pray for renewal at one another's
churches. Some 40-80 pastors attend a weekly prayer meeting. Congregants enjoy "seeing all
the pastors come together more than they enjoy the manifestations of the Holy Spirit," Grewe
said. NIRR 6/12/95

"A major step in bringing unity" to Northern Ireland is how an evangelical leader described
the May 16-21 Luis Palau crusade in Londonderry (NIRR 11/4/94). Howard Lewis of the
Evangelical Alliance in Northern Ireland said the crusade brought together churches "we
never dreamt would work together" and delivered an element of healing to a community
fraught with religious and political discord. Catholics and Protestants worshiped together in a
3,000-seat tent-pavilion on the bank of the Foyle River, which divides Protestant and Catholic
communities. Some 18,000 people attended the five-day crusade, which included a youth rally
and a service for senior citizens, Palau's evangelistic association said. About 450 people
prayed to become Christians during the crusade. NIRR 6/12/95

Christians in Russia, long prevented under communism from using the media, are learning to
use radio as a ministry. Some 75 ministers and church planters studied radio production
methods and other skills in three seminars conducted by Trans World Radio, Russia
Ministries Executive Director Peter Deyneka told NIRR. Deyneka's ministry recruits students
and coordinates the sessions. Under communism, "some did not even know how to operate a
tape recorder," Deyneka said. Yet they recognized its usefulness for spreading the gospel.
"Pastors came to us and said, `How can we use radio?'" 
<BR>...About a dozen new programs, mostly containing preaching, are on the air as a result,
Deyneka said. This summer the two ministries are opening a media center in Moscow,
complete with recording facilities and a library of radio broadcasts. Another goal is to form
an association of religious broadcasters to exchange ideas, socialize, and be represented as a
unified group. NIRR 6/12/95

House Speaker Newt Gingrich's plan to use churches and other charities to compensate for
budget cuts to social services will put too large a strain on their resources, ministry
representatives say. To make up for the $60 billion in cuts proposed in the House-approved
Personal Responsibility Act alone, each of America's 350,000 churches would have to raise
an additional $190,000 over the next five years, Bread for the World said. But the typical
congregation has fewer than 100 members and the $60 billion figure represents nearly the
total giving for all religious groups and causes in a single year, according to various studies.
Gingrich has suggested that every church and synagogue in the country can adopt a homeless
person for six months. 
<BR>...Charities can meet only a fraction of the needs, their leaders say. Dismantling America's
welfare system and relying solely on charities and volunteers would cause "a disaster of a
large magnitude," Stephen Burger, executive director of the International Union of Gospel
Missions, told NIRR. For example, the budget at Seattle's Union Gospel Mission already is
stretched to its limits, Herb Pfiffner, executive director of the mission, told The New York
Times. Union receives no public funds, and Pfiffner is reluctant to do so because the mission
might be forced to abandon its religious message, he said. But cuts in government services
will lead to more competition for private money and great needs among the poor, he said.     
<BR>...Christian groups helping the poor have more long-term success than the government
because the gospel "changes lives," Pfiffner said. The nation's 250 rescue missions served
75,000 meals a day, provided 24,800 beds per night, and gave 13,700,000 articles of clothing
last year. NIRR 6/12/95

Fifty churches are helping rebuild the poorest neighborhood in New York City's Harlem
section. They formed a development corporation called Harlem Congregation for Community
Improvement, an organizer told NIRR. Since 1989, the group has overseen construction of
more than 1,500 housing units in the area's Bradhurst section. The group has spent close to
$200 million on the construction. Most of the money comes from foundation grants and the
city. 
<BR>...The average yearly income per family in Bradhurst is $6,019, according to an analysis of
census data by the Program for Applied Research at Queens College. One in four households
consists of married couples, one in three adults is employed or seeking work, and three of
four people live below the poverty level, the study showed. By comparison, the average
yearly family income in the richest community in New York, bounded by 5th and Park
Avenues and East 86th and 91st Streets on Manhattan's Upper East Side, is $301,209 -- or 50
times that in Bradhurst. NIRR 6/12/95

Ministry leaders, accountants, and lawyers are making headway in charting an honorable way
out of the mess created by The Foundation for New Era Philanthropy bankruptcy, according
to Paul Nelson, president of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability. Hundreds
of evangelical organizations, colleges, and churches stand to lose tens of millions of dollars in
the New Era pyramid scheme (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/052995.html">NIRR 5/29</A>). About $200 million is owed to creditors against
about $30 million in assets, according to court records. 
<BR>...More than 100 groups, including some nonreligious charities, have joined the ECFA-created
United Response to New Era plan, Nelson said. The plan's intent is for affected groups to
conform voluntarily to bankruptcy provisions governing fraud cases, and avert the costs and
spectacle of litigation, he said. Nelson and other United Response leaders have met with the
bankruptcy trustee to fine-tune the unprecedented plan. The trustee reportedly is pushing all
creditors to become part of United Response. Creditors will meet formally for the first time
June 26 in Philadelphia. 
<BR>...A proposed agreement has been discussed with the bankruptcy trustee and other groups.
Charities that got more money from New Era "matching grants" than they lost in last month's
collapse would return the balance voluntarily, Nelson said. Charities that received less than
they had on deposit will be asked to give up their right to sue in exchange for the prospect of
receiving some of the money returned by other charities. A number of ministries have said
they will return funds, but it is not known how much money will be added to the assets,
Nelson said. The trustee would not initiate any litigation under the plan.  
<BR>..."It is likely that those in a negative cash position will remain so" once the proposal has
been accepted and the assets distributed, Nelson warned in a letter to United Response
members. The group will coordinate an effort for the evangelical community to help all
groups that may be harmed financially, he said. Some small ministries have been left in dire
straits by New Era's collapse, he told NIRR. 
<BR>...Almost 98% of major donors have less respect for the managerial skills of senior nonprofit
managers as a result of the New Era debacle, according to a survey by The Chronicle of
Philanthropy. And 74% said they planned to take a closer look at the groups they already
support. To avoid alienation, organizations must explain to their constituents what happened
and how, Nelson said. Charities that are candid with their donors will be more likely to
receive forgiveness and continued support, he added. NIRR 6/12/95

Croats, Serbs, and former Muslims worship together at the Church of the Good News in
Mostar, Bosnia, according to Agape, a relief organization based in Osijek, Croatia (NIRR
1/24/94). Some 200 people attend regular worship at the church, which was founded in 1985
and destroyed by artillery several years ago. "The building was gone and only a few people
left," Agape founder Peter Kuzmic told NIRR. But a couple from Agape took over the church
last year and have seen it grow as it assists those in need. Members are committed to doing
relief work and evangelism across Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kuzmic said.  
<BR>...Founded in 1991 to assist displaced Croats, Agape's ministry has spread throughout the
former Yugoslavia as the war creates more refugees. The ministry is "two-handed," Kuzmic
said: "With one hand we give them daily bread, and with the other hand we give them eternal
bread." In the last two years, Agape has fed 700,000 people, including 3,500 refugee families.
An additional 2,000 families receive clothing twice a month. The ministry also distributed
700,000 Scripture portions, but is careful to practice low-key evangelism. "We are dealing
with horrible pain. We have to be sensitive so as not to manipulate the Muslims who are
victims here," Kuzmic said. NIRR 6/12/95

Pope John Paul II said he is willing to seek agreement with other denominations on the future
role of the papacy. In his 115-page encyclical appealing for Christian unity last month (NIRR
5/15), he said that in the early church the papacy acted as a "moderator" to resolve
disagreements and preserve unity. The 75-year-old pontiff said he feels a "particular" personal
responsibility to make unity happen. He appealed to leaders and theologians of other
denominations to enter into "patient" dialogue with him. However, the pope made it clear he
would not accept a symbolic papacy lacking authority to issue infallible declarations regarding
the faith. And he insisted that the papacy must be based in Rome because Peter died there.
Catholics consider Peter the first pope. 
<BR>...Prominent Catholic theologian Hans Kung denounced the encyclical and said the pope
himself is the greatest obstacle to unity. The Swiss-born Kung, who teaches at the German
University of Tubingen, berated the pontiff for not relinquishing power. Instead, John Paul
wants unity totally on Roman terms, Kung said. The encyclical should have taken initiatives
such as rescinding the excommunication of Martin Luther and other Reformation leaders, and
recognizing the validity of Protestant clergy and religious services, he said. NIRR 6/12/95

Members of Assemblies of God and Southern Baptist churches give the most per capita,
according to a survey commissioned by the Lilly Endowment. The survey, described as the
most far-reaching of its kind, studied 625 congregations, 125 in each of five major church
bodies, across the nine census regions of the country. The other three churches surveyed: the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Presbyterian Church (USA), and the Catholic
Church. 
<BR>...Church size is not a big factor in giving, the study found. Also, feelings of alienation from
denominational leadership or from denominational moral teachings are statistically
insignificant. The study found that people in conservative Protestant churches give more:
People who tithe and those who plan their giving with pledges or other commitments give
more than others. Giving varies by age and marital status. Those between 45 and 65 and
those who are married and whose spouses attend the same church give the most.

Some 60 religious and secular groups formed a coalition to protect the Religious Freedom
Restoration Act in the courts. The new group calls itself the Coalition for the Free Exercise of
Religion. Members range from the U.S. Catholic Conference, the National Council of
Churches, and the American Jewish Congress to the American Civil Liberties Union, the
American Muslim Council, and the Church of Scientology.                                           
<BR>...Federal District Judge Lucius Bunton made a mistake in March when he ruled RFRA
unconstitutional (NIRR 4/3/95), the coalition argued in a brief filed with the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Bunton said RFRA intruded on the power of the
courts. The coalition said Congress passed the act to enforce a constitutional right, not to
usurp judicial power. 
<BR>...The case involves a Catholic church in Boerne, Texas, that wanted to demolish part of its
building to expand the sanctuary. City officials denied permission because the church is in a
historic district. The archdiocese of San Antonio sued, claiming Boerne had violated RFRA
by limiting the parish's free exercise of religion. NIRR 6/12/95

The Christian Legal Society and the American Jewish Congress asked the U.S. Supreme
Court to consider the case of a Seventh-day Adventist who was fired from the Tampa, Fla.,
Police Department. Recruit Ashton Beadle claimed his religious beliefs did not permit him to
take part in Saturday training exercises. The Tampa police said their training procedures could
not be altered to accommodate his views, a position supported by lower courts. The legal
watchdog groups cited the Civil Rights Act of 1954, which requires employers to
accommodate religious practices in the workplace unless doing so imposes "undue hardship."
The Tampa Police Department failed to offer proof that its procedures could not be varied
under any circumstances, they said. NIRR 6/12/95

There is "revival on the radio," a talk-show host says. Steve Solomon hosts Praise in the
Night, which originates from Dallas and is broadcast on 30 stations around the country.
Solomon, a Messianic Jew who once was involved in the occult, is a charismatic who teaches
from the Bible, plays praise music, and ministers on the air to callers. 
<BR>..."We are seeing signs and wonders through the airwaves," he said. Some 4,000 people a
month call the show. Some callers have become Christians, been delivered from drug
addiction, been physically healed, and experienced "holy laughter" on the air, he said. One
woman's left ear was healed as Solomon prayed for her on the phone, he said. "She screamed
as she held the phone to her ear." Phone counselors are available to talk and pray with those
who call. The call-in line is 1-(800)-727-7486. NIRR 6/12/95

Some 92% of Americans own at least one Bible, an equal number say the Bible is a good
source of moral teaching, and 87% believe it is the revealed Word of God, according to an
American Bible Society poll. Yet only 69% of respondents said they turn to the Bible for
advice. As for reading the Bible, 25% said they do it daily and another 23% read it weekly,
while 22% indicated they never read it. The survey found that Protestants are three times
more likely to read the Bible regularly than are Catholics, blacks more likely than whites, and
women much more likely than men. People over 50 are more likely than those in their 20s to
be regular Bible readers. 
<BR>...Nearly 40% of those surveyed said they have at least four Bibles in their homes. Overall,
66% of respondents said they own the King James version. The second-most-popular version:
The Living Bible (13%). Other surveys placed the New International Version in second place.

Cuba abruptly changed its policy toward house churches. The government closed at least 81
house churches in the last month and jailed a pastor, sources reported. Authorities sentenced
Orson Vila, an Assemblies of God pastor and presbyter of the AG churches in the Camaguey
area, to 18 months in prison after he refused to close his house church. Vila told local
authorities that they could close the church, but that he could not "turn his back on the flock
and tell the people not to come back," Barbara Cusack, a Cuban-American who spoke with
Vila's wife, told NIRR. More than 1,000 Christians sang and praised God outside the
courthouse during Vila's trial May 24, she said.  
<BR>...Vila "is like a Billy Graham," Cusack said. He attracts many people and "God uses him
mightily," she said. He was arrested in 1981 for holding a revival that attracted thousands, an
AG official who knows Vila told NIRR. The pastor reportedly is in good condition. Local
leaders are appealing on his behalf. 
<BR>...House churches in other denominations are being closed as well, Cusack said. They are seen
as a threat because they are growing fast and refusing to join the government-controlled
Ecumenical Council, according to the AG official who requested anonymity. The AG has
formed more than 800 house churches since they were legalized in 1992, he said. As more
people become Christians, they spend Sundays worshiping rather than meeting with their local
militia groups or attending Communist Party meetings, Cusack said. "In a system that thrives
on control, this is out of control." 
<BR>...The pastors are nonpolitical, Cusack said. Authorities have nothing to fear from the church:
"Only in intercessory prayer are they militant." NIRR 6/12/95

Nearly 10,000 Chinese attended an unauthorized Catholic mass in the village of Dong Lu,
130 miles southwest of Beijing, The Washington Post reported. Police turned away thousands
more, sources said. Large-scale masses are held annually there and on a hill outside Shanghai,
and smaller ones take place throughout the year elsewhere in the country. They are conducted
by underground priests faithful to the Vatican. About 400 such priests and 20 bishops labor in
China, church sources estimate. The Communist Party outlawed Roman Catholicism in favor
of the Catholic Patriotic Association, a national version independent of the Vatican. A number
of CPA bishops and priests have secretly sought and received Vatican approval, the church
sources said. 
<BR>...Private companies help fund the unofficial church and host meetings to spread Catholicism,
according to the Post. Itinerant missionaries visit rural villages. In some villages in the Tianjin
area, up to 90% of the people, including Communist Party members, are Catholics, the church
sources said. Various estimates place the number of Catholics in China at 6-12 million.

Provincial leaders in Laos are closing churches and forcing Christians to renounce their faith,
News Network International reported. In the northern province of Luang Prabang, seminar
leaders teach that Christianity contradicts Communist Party convictions. Hundreds of
Christians have been made to promise not to evangelize, attend church, or pray for the sick.
About 40 churches in Luang Prabang have closed since November, NNI reported.               
<BR>...About 10% of Laos' officially recognized church is evangelical, a source at Partners
International told NIRR. The Laos Evangelical Church was fading until 1990, when a church
leader taught principles he learned from an Evangelism Explosion seminar in Bangkok. Today
the church is experiencing renewal and establishing unofficial "preaching points" throughout
the country. A Christian barber in Laos told customers about Christ as he cut their hair. He
erected a cross outside and started a church in his shop that grew to 200 people in two years,
the PI source said. NIRR 6/12/95

Newborns with most of their brains missing should be allowed to be used as organ donors
before they are dead, a policy-setting committee of the American Medical Association said.
The proposal, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, calls for
changing state laws to allow such transplants. 
<BR>...The prospect of killing one patient to save another has divided the ranks of the AMA. Dr.
John Glasson, chairman of its Council of Ethical and Judicial Affairs, favors the procedure
since anencephalic newborns are doomed and "don't have any consciousness," he said.
Removing their organs would help ease a shortage for children needing transplants, he said.  
<BR>..."You can't kill babies to take their organs, no matter how many lives could be saved," said
George Annas, a Boston University professor of health law. Rabbi Lester Frazin of a
Sacramento, Calif., congregation, told Family Issues Alert that harvesting organs from living
human beings is "reminiscent of Nazi Germany." About 1,000-2,000 U.S. infants are born
each year with anencephaly, in which most of the brain, skull, and scalp are missing.

Seventeen alumni of Baylor University asked the school's president to remove the Baylor
name from the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. They objected to BCM's ties to
testing of RU-486, the so-called abortion pill. Baylor College of Medicine said that faculty
member Dr. Alfred Poindexter, and not the medical school, contracted to test RU-486.
Poindexter has tested RU-486 at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Houston since early this year.
<BR>...In response, BU president Robert Sloan, Jr., affirmed his opposition to abortion as a "great
social tragedy." But he said the medical college has the legal right "to use the Baylor name,
contingent only upon their retention of accreditation." The college's charter provides for 25%
of its board to be elected by Baylor University's board of regents; protesting alumni also
asked for that relationship to end. Apart from the trustee relationship and the Baylor name,
the Southern Baptist-related university and the medical school ended their ties in 1959.

Weakened by flu-like symptoms, Billy Graham collapsed during a speech in Toronto the day

Skipp Porteous, director of the religious-watchdog group Institute for First Amendment
Studies and a foe of the religious right, received a death threat when he supplied information
to investigators of the Oklahoma City bombing, reports said. Also, shots were fired at his
home. Porteous gave the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms a list of 4,500 names,
mostly of militia members, compiled by "a militia leader in a Western state," reports said.
Porteous said he got the list from an informant who infiltrated one of the militias. Porteous'
nonprofit organization doubles as an intelligence-gathering group. Much of its information
comes from informants in every state, he told NIRR. The former ordained minister publishes
the newsletter Freedom Writer, which promotes the separation of church and state.

The woman who shot Kansas abortion doctor George Tiller pleaded guilty to setting fires at
abortion clinics in four Western states. Rachelle Shannon of Grants Pass, Ore., is serving a
10-year prison sentence for attempted murder (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/052995.html">NIRR 5/29</A>). Federal grand juries in Oregon
and California indicted her last fall for attacks against nine clinics. Daniel Mathison, a
supporter of abortion rights, pleaded guilty to threatening to kill employees at a pro-life
counseling service. His arrest this year was the first time the 1994 Freedom of Access to
Clinic Entrances Act was used against a supporter of abortion rights. On a visit to the

A move to require Baptist churches to include the word Baptist in their names received little
support at the semiannual meeting of the San Diego Southern Baptist Association. Delegates

Elementary school children in Lubbock, Texas, can earn a pair of expensive athletic shoes for

Jurors deadlocked in the case of former
Washington trooper Lane Jackstadt
(NIRR 1/9/95). Justin Cooper and
Deanna Thomas accused Jackstadt of
stopping them for speeding, then coercing them to follow him to a pro-life counseling session. The pregnant teen-ager
and her boyfriend had been heading to
an appointment at a Planned Parenthood

Jackstadt, who was fired for allegedly

Abortions among New Jersey mothers
on welfare increased slightly after the

into effect, a state study showed. Under
the cap, mothers on welfare do not receive an increase in their monthly check
if they have another baby. In the eight
months after the cap took effect in August 1994, welfare abortions increased
from 7,619 during the same period a year
earlier to 7,932. That means the abortion
rate rose from 9.43 per 1,000 women to
9.78. Pro-life and pro-choice leaders alike

Christian leaders are scrambling to protect their organizations from
further damage after the collapse of the Foundation for New Era Philanthropy.
More than 300 nonprofits, many of which are evangelical ministries and colleges,
as well as scores of wealthy donors are affected. An unknown number of
churches also stand to lose large amounts. They placed tens of millions of dollars
with Radnor, Pa.-based New Era in a purported matching-grant program.
<BR>...New Era filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy this month after the Securities and
Exchange Commission declared its program a Ponzi scheme. The court listed an
estimated $80 million in assets and $551 in liabilities, half or more apparently in
matching-grant pledges. Financial analysts called it the biggest nonprofit collapse
in recent U.S. history and the worst to hit the evangelical community. 
<BR>...Early participants were paid by deposits of later investors, the SEC said.
Further, New Era's head, John "Jack" G. Bennett, Jr., had diverted at least $5
million in consulting fees to his private business accounts, bankruptcy trustee
John T. Carroll, III, told The Wall Street Journal. The Pennsylvania attorney
general filed fraud charges, and the FBI and IRS launched inquiries. Former New
Era workers said they will talk only if granted immunity. Carroll said funds had
been commingled, records were in shambles, and important documents were
missing. An audit to determine the true financial picture may take months.
Bankruptcy Judge Bruce Fox indicated he was trying to protect remaining assets
from lawyers duplicating each other's work.
<BR>..."Those of you who know us, know that we would never have done
anything other than enable you to grow and flourish," Bennett said in a letter to
New Era investors. "My sole desire is to do everything possible to see that the
obligations we have to you are fulfilled...I hope that an attitude of objectivity
will prevail, as distinct from the rush to judgment which has characterized much
of the media accounts and editorial comment." Miller, Alfano, and Raspanti, the
law firm representing Bennett, declined to speak to NIRR. 
<BR>...Christian groups and donors risk more than losing most of their money
on deposit, more than $100 million by some estimates. Under "fraudulent
conveyance" laws, they also face having to return the millions paid out in
matching and other grants, Paul Nelson, president of the Evangelical Council for
Financial Accountability, told NIRR. More than 100 of ECFA's 800 members
could be affected, he said. ECFA has organized a task force, United Response to
New Era, to coordinate legal and financial strategies for its member ministries.
Also at risk are ministries and churches that had no direct links to New Era, but
because of donor designations received unsolicited grants, which they may have
to repay. Some groups and churches listed as recipients said they never received
a dime from New Era and had never heard of the group.
<BR>...Within the Coalition for Christian Colleges and Universities, 14 of 80
schools deposited about $25 million in New Era, CCCU president Robert
Andringa said. The group put $350,000 of its own money in New Era, he added.
<BR>...The prospect of turned-off donors plus Christian organizations pitted
against each other in court is something to fear in the aftermath, donor consultant
Gordon Loux, a former ECFA head and ministry leader, told NIRR. He said he
hoped that givers will stand by the causes they've supported, and that ministry
boards will chart an honorable way out of the morass.
<BR>...Bennett, 57, an evangelical with a background in financial consulting,
set up New Era in 1989. Although "foundation" is part of its name, it was a
nonprofit charity, officials said. Its chief activity in the beginning was to dispense fund-raising advice to other nonprofits and corporate donors. The role
gained Bennett access to many prominent people of wealth, including mutual
fund wizard Sir John Templeton and his son John, Jr., a pediatric surgeon in
Philadelphia. Templeton invited Bennett in 1990 to serve on the boards of two
dozen mutual funds. In 1992, Bennett began spreading the word that an anonymous philanthropist was willing to back worthy causes with matching grants
through New Era, reports said. Applicants had to meet certain qualifications, put
up at least $25,000, and leave their money with New Era for six months, a New
Era prospectus said. In time, the anonymous donors grew to seven. Bennett told
his staff on May 13 that the seven donors did not exist, reports said.
<BR>...Among the first to test the waters was Glenn Blossom, pastor of 1,300member Chelten Baptist Church in suburban Philadelphia. Blossom, prominent in
the Conservative Baptist Association, was struggling to raise funds for a CBA
school he started, Seminary of the East in Dresher, Pa. He persuaded backers to
give $500,000; six months later, a check arrived from New Era matching the
amount. Blossom, 49, became one of the program's supporters. He set up a
foundation of his own as a conduit for the funds. (His foundation was listed as
being owed $27.5 million. Actual deposits are thought to be much less. Sources
say CBA missions and headquarters agencies have more than $2 million in the
program. Numerous CBA churches and donors account for millions more. Some
churches deposited entire building funds.)
<BR>...Word about New Era spread rapidly in development circles. Board
members of nonprofits who investigated found it had never missed a payment.
Its financial statements seemed in order. Other ministries issued glowing testimonials. Bennett certainly seemed to have ties to billionaire Templeton. Former
Treasury Secretary William Simon, financier Laurance S. Rockefeller, and other
prominent benefactors had turned to New Era to increase the amount of funds
they gave away. Matching grants were a familiar tool in fund-raising. Even the
Pew Charitable Trusts, the Maclellan Foundation, the Philadelphia Orchestra, and
other savvy groups joined the action. Many boards concluded it would be foolish
not to participate. New Era's 1993 IRS report showed $36 million was paid out.
Triple that amount flowed back into New Era during 1994, Bennett said.
<BR>...Then it all came tumbling down. Albert J. Meyer, 44, an accounting professor at Spring Arbor (Mich.) College, works part-time on the college's books. He
spotted a July 1993 entry of $294,000 that was deposited with a New Era
intermediary. Meyer says he investigated and concluded that New Era was a
Ponzi scam. College officials did not heed his warnings and put down $1 million. His letter to the SEC last month prompted that agency's investigation.
<BR>...Unknown to its clients, New Era had a brokerage account of about $60
million with Prudential Securities. Prudential said Bennett had an outstanding
loan balance of $44 million against the account. As a result of the SEC inquiry,
Prudential launched its own investigation of Bennett. After he refused to answer
questions, the brokerage liquidated the account to get back its loan. The Wall
Street Journal broke the story May 15 and a flood of news coverage followed.
<BR>...Many nonprofits declined to disclose the exact amounts they have on
deposit at New Era, or the amounts of grants, if any, they received earlier. Only
the amounts owed to those on the top-20 list of largest creditors were published.
In most cases, the actual amounts at risk are about half. For example, Lancaster
(Pa.) Bible College says that its real figure is "several million" below the $16.9
million listed. Some groups apparently subtracted grants already received from
the balance. Wheaton College says its "net" amount outstanding is $730,000, not
the $4.6 million listed. (It has $2.05 million on deposit, the school said.) Other
creditors and amounts listed by the court include: Gordon-Conwell Seminary,
$9.8 million; Maclellan Foundation, $8.5 million; Philadelphia College of Bible,
$8 million; Whitworth College, $7 million.
<BR>...Some actual amounts reported include: Biblical Seminary, $635,000;
Christian Men, $4.9 million; English Language Institute, $500,000; Inter-Varsity
Christian Fellowship, $1 million; International Teams, $2.5 million; Menno
Haven retirement home, $1 million; Mercy Corps, $100,000; Messiah College,
$2 million; World Vision, $1.5 million; Young Life International, $2.5 million.
<BR>...If the nonprofits obeyed New Era's restriction that only special project
funds could be used in the program, their operating budgets would not be
affected. One small ministry, World Christian, acknowledged it sent $50,000 -one-third of its annual budget -- to New Era, which had promised a $100,000
grant. Anticipating the grant's arrival in July, the ministry borrowed money,
added staff, and expanded programs. New Era's collapse is "devastating," a
World Christian spokesman said in an open letter on the Internet.

One hundred thousand South Korean university students dedicated themselves to global evangelism May 20. They sat in a pouring rain in the Seoul
Olympic Stadium and promised to bring renewal to their colleges, work toward
reunification with North Korea, and take the gospel to unreached people. The
event, called Student Mission 2000, was part of AD 2000 and Beyond
Movement's Global Consultation On World Evangelism (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/050195.html">NIRR 5/1</A>), the largest
conference on world evangelism ever held.
<BR>...The world must have "a church for every people and the gospel for
every person" by the end of the year 2000, insisted Luis Bush, international
director of AD 2000 and Beyond. Christian workers came from 200 nations to
hear fresh ideas, acquire new resources, and gain encouragement for the push
toward the goal. "It can be done, it ought to be done, it must be done," Bush
said, quoting evangelist D.L. Moody. 
<BR>...A "rapid acceleration of divine activity" is creating new opportunities for
the gospel, Bush told delegates. The fall of communism in Eastern Europe and a
waning of secular humanism in the West means "we are moving from an age of
unbelief to an unprecedented age of faith," he said. Evangelists will try to begin
church-planting ministries in each of the 2,500 least-evangelized ethno-linguistic
people groups by the end of the year 2000. They will focus on groups in the
heavily Muslim and Hindu nations in the 10/40 Window (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/012395.html">NIRR 1/23</A>). 
<BR>...Some 4,000 delegates, more "than any other gathering in Christian
history," attended GCOWE '95, Bush said. Not even during the 1988 Summer
Olympic Games were there "so many nations and so many distinguished guests,"
an organizer said. Two-thirds came from Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the
Middle East. Some 170 delegates came from India, sacrificing the equivalent of
several months wages to pay air fare. Women, who are playing an increasing
role in evangelism, comprised 25% of the participants. The South Korean church,
one of the "most vigorous and mature" in the world, organizers said, donated
$3.5 million to host the May 17-25 conference.

Revival is spreading through internment camps in Guantanamo Bay.
Tom Willey of World Relief told NIRR that 40% of the 19,000 Cubans in the
camps are evangelical Christians. Pastors and lay leaders are spreading the
"completely spontaneous" revival; relief workers are not allowed to evangelize.
An 18-year-old girl launched more than 15 congregations. Approximately 1,000
people have been baptized in two months, and on Sunday there are "hundreds
spread all over the field" outside the Protestant chapel, Willey said.
<BR>...Those who make it to the United States bring the excitement with them.
"You can tell who they are -- they glow," a pastor told Willey. He estimated that
3,000 evangelical Christians have come to Florida from the camps. Many of
them are doctors, engineers, and military officers who possess "leadership
potential" to bring awakening to churches in Miami, he said.

Churches in Haiti are experiencing "incredible growth," pastors and
missions leaders say. Repression by the former government and the U.S. embargo stirred political and social turmoil that is leading people to seek refuge in
God, Ignace Augustine told NIRR. He is a pastor and president of Bethany
Evangelical Mission of Haiti, an agency formed by Haitians who pastor churches
begun by the Minneapolis-based Bethany Mission. BEMH has grown from four
to 32 churches in 10 years. 
<BR>...Churches prayed ardently and God began to "manifest His power," said
Augustine, whose church grew by 200 people in three years. Often, entire
families convert, according to Rick Jacobsen, the Caribbean representative for the
mission. In Port au Piment, many politicians and businessmen became Christians
during a revival after church leaders prayed every night for a year, he said.
Belief in the occult remains strong, but some are leaving spiritism.

of the predominantly black, full-gospel Antioch Christian Church, said Christians
from various backgrounds were "weeping, crying, and pouring out their hearts
for unity," and speakers on the platform were "taking the mask off and getting
real." The service included brief prayers and exhortations by pastors, a citywide
choir, and a spontaneous foot-washing among those on the podium. Television
stations in Mobile and Montgomery broadcast the service live.
<BR>...Racism permeates the church in Mobile, leaders said. The attitude
among too many Christians has been that "blacks make good eunuchs in the
temple -- singing and serving, but are not good enough to speak on the platform," Nichols told NIRR. "Everybody who has that spirit is going to have to
confront it or move out of the Body," he said. Pastors who decry racism "behind
closed doors" can't be afraid to mention it from their pulpits, Nichols said.
Empty talk about reconciliation "eases the consciences," but fails to deter racism,
said Stuart Roth of Sonlight Broadcasting Systems, who led the event. 
<BR>...A group of area pastors and leaders is taking steps to bring the problem
into the open. Pastors plan to meet monthly, link their congregations as interracial sister churches, and hold joint worship services. Roth also is planning more
Gulf Coast Power of Prayer services. "There's a fire here that I believe is going
to be powerful," he said.

A spiritual renewal movement among pastors' wives is growing. International Renewal Ministries of Portland, Ore., which has run more than 200 of the
four-day Pastors' Prayer Summits (NIRR 3/20/95) in six years, also has begun
Pastors' Wives Prayer Summits. Seven such spiritual getaways have taken place
and others are planned. The conferences are times of "confession, brokenness,
repentance, forgiveness, reconciliation, restoration, renewal, and revival," according to Terry Dirks, IRM vice president.
<BR>...The wives are prone to mental, physical, and emotional exhaustion,
said Jane Brown, who facilitated a Pastors' Wives Summit in the Pacific Northwest this spring. "Some came with an anger toward God, some with deep
wounds, yet there was an honesty, an openness -- no resistance to the Spirit's
work," she said. IRM also led two Women in Ministry Leadership Prayer Summits to give women pastors and other ministry leaders "an extended time in the
presence of God," Dirks said. For information call (503) 251-6455.

The Oklahoma City bombing brought two downtown congregations closer
together -- literally. Members of Trinity Baptist Church invited the congregation
of the badly damaged First United Methodist Church to share Trinity's facilities.
It's a "tailor-made" fit, Trinity pastor Keith Arledge said. Trinity has a large
complex, but its aging congregation has been shrinking. Both churches are
evangelical, operate outreaches, decided to remain downtown, and have similar
praise-centered worship styles, he said.
<BR>...Each Sunday, the Methodists use the sanctuary while the Baptists are
in Sunday school -- then the Baptists use it while the Methodists are in Sunday
school. First Methodist also can use the facilities during the week, and a Methodist staffer attends Trinity staff meetings to coordinate schedules.

Korean-American Christians in New York City are disciplined and enthusiastic in their outreach to the city (NIRR 10/3/94). Most of New York's 450
Korean congregations hold prayer services early every morning, according to Hi
Seon Lee, assistant pastor of the nondenominational Korean Church of Queens.
At his church, 500 people pray from 5:30 a.m. to 6:30 a.m.. Each Friday, 100
members spend an additional hour handing out gospel tracts and singing in an
early-morning choir outside Main Street subway stations in the Flushing section
of the borough. Commuters in the multiracial neighborhood are more receptive to
the gospel before work than after, Lee said. "They meet us before they meet all
the pressures, noise, and depression of the day," he told NIRR.
<BR>...At least one member of Lee's congregation is praying every hour of the
day, all year long. Members choose a time to pray, then indicate their commitment on a large chart that divides the week into 168 hourly blocks.

Prison Fellowship is distributing its free newspaper for prisoners, Inside
Journal, to every prison in the country. The ministry publishes the 8-page
newspaper six times a year and distributes it to 362,000 inmates. The newspaper
offers practical advice, stories of Christian athletes and entertainers, and presentations of the gospel. Prisoners have sent 22,000 letters to Prison Fellowship in
response to the publication; a team of eight PF volunteers answers the mail.
Prison volunteers can get copies of Inside Journal to give to inmates by calling
circulation director Ron Humphrey at 703-478-0100, ext. 557.

Some 1,000 United Methodists denounced beliefs and practices they say
have created a crisis in their denomination. The self-described centrists, members
of the Confessing Movement in the UMC (NIRR 5/16/94), condemned "private
versions of the faith" that make the denomination "incapable of confessing with
one voice the orthodox trinitarian faith." The group said some members of the
church are "experimenting with pagan ritual and practice," enjoying wealth
without regard for the poor, and accepting sexual promiscuity, divorce, homosexual practice, and abortion.
<BR>...Organizers of the movement hope the manifesto will renew the church.
Some 13,000 people have signed it, they said. Retired bishop William Cannon of
Atlanta, President Maxie Dunnam of Asbury Seminary, and theologian Thomas
Oden of Drew University's School of Theology convened the meeting, which
was held in Atlanta.

A schismatic Episcopal congregation in Spokane, Wash., must give its
building back to the local diocese, a judge ruled in a preliminary injunction. Last
month, most of Holy Trinity Church's 212 members denounced their denomination for embracing liberal theology. This month they joined the Antiochian
Orthodox faith. Episcopal Bishop Jeff Terry sued to prevent church members
from worshiping any longer at Holy Trinity. Judge Kathleen O'Connor said civil
courts must accept decisions made by church hierarchy in such cases.

Another schism is racking the Worldwide Church of God (NIRR 3/20/95).
About 100 of the Pasadena, Calif.-based church's 350 pastors left and organized
a new denomination called the United Church of God. Many Worldwide Church
of God pastors have resigned or been fired because they cannot accept the
church's movement toward mainstream Christianity, the church said.
<BR>...Last year, the Worldwide Church of God repudiated teachings of its
founder, Herbert W. Armstrong, and embraced more mainstream concepts,
including the Trinity and salvation through grace alone. The departure of pastors
was viewed as a major setback to efforts to stem the loss of members and
money, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Students staged a protest after a court ordered removal of a portrait of
Jesus from their Bloomingdale, Mich., high school corridor (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/051595.html">NIRR 5/15</A>). In the
spot where the portrait had hung for 30 years, they placed a cloth adorned with
a dozen buttons containing a miniature version of the same picture. The ACLU,
which sued to have the portrait removed, threatened to take school officials to
court again. Principal Roger Tuinstra said he thought the student protest was
legal, but agreed to remove the buttons.

The Christian Coalition's Contract With the American Family aims to
"ensure that Washington values families," coalition leader Ralph Reed told a
Capitol Hill news conference. The contract calls for a constitutional amendment
to allow religious expression in schools and other public places. Among other
agenda items: eliminate the U.S. Department of Education and transfer most of
its money to local school boards; promote school choice through vouchers and
tuition tax credits; restrict pornography on cable TV and the Internet; limit lateterm abortions and curtail government funding of abortion; protect parental
rights; boost charities as an alternative to welfare.
<BR>...At a news conference a few blocks away, a separate group of opposition
leaders said the contract threatens religious freedom, families, and the poor. Days
later, 75 Protestant and Catholic leaders warned that ties between the religious
right and Republicans in Washington constitute "a dangerous liaison of religion
with political power." They called for "new solutions" rooted in local communities and moral values. Backers included heads of mainstream Protestant denominations, Catholic bishops, and evangelicals Tony Campolo and Ron Sider.

Only 18% of U.S. adults consider themselves part of the religious right,
but the label defies stereotypes, according to pollster George Gallup. In polls last
year, the label was claimed by a larger percentage of blacks than whites (30%
vs. 17%) and more often by females than males (21% vs. 15%). Although 24%
of Republicans said they were part of the religious right, so did 16% of all
Democrats. Only one-third of all respondents who described themselves as "bornagain" also professed a religious right connection.

A landmark Canadian court decision allowed four lesbian couples to

precluded homosexual couples from applying to adopt, violated Canada's charter

Citing sharp increases in violence, suicides, and poverty among juveniles, a study said America's most pressing domestic need is re-establishment of
a "culture of marriage." The report was released by a panel of educators, publicpolicy experts, and family advocates for the New York-based Institute for
American Values. It lists four goals aimed at shifting cultural values and public
policy toward strengthening marriages: (1) Reclaim the concept of permanent
marriages and affirm marriage as the best environment for raising children; (2)
Decide that out-of-wedlock child-rearing is wrong, that every child needs a father
in the home, and that divorce is too common; (3) Resolve to increase the number
of children raised in two-parent families and decrease the number who are not;
and (4) Resolve that parents will spend more time with their children.
<BR>...The worsening situation among juveniles corresponds with the increase
in nonmarital births, from 5.3% in 1950 to more than 30% today, the 22-page
report notes. It pronounces the divorce-and-nonmarriage culture a failure. For a

Islamic fundamentalists in northern Sudan are kidnapping Christian and
animist children, the Puebla Institute reported. Children are taken to camps and
given Islamic names, taught the Koran, conscripted into military service, and
forced to fight their own countrymen, the Catholic human-rights group said. The
actions are part of a "cultural cleansing campaign" conducted by the militant
Muslim government to Islamicize the children, Kevin Vigilante, a physician who
led the Puebla trip, told NIRR. Soldiers raid northern cities, picking up unaccompanied male children with darker, southern features. In one instance, radicals
kidnapped children from their homes while their parents were away. Because of
the civil war, many Sudanese from the south have relocated to the north.
<BR>...The children, most aged 11-15, are taken to re-education camps, Vigilante said. He interviewed clergy, relief workers, families of recovered children,
and government officials, and visited deserted camps. Radicals give the children
inadequate food, beat them for minor offenses, and beat them severely for trying
to escape, Vigilante said. The Sudanese government denied the charges.

The government of Turkey is intimidating Iranian Christians, an Americanbased ministry to Iranian Christians reported. Because of the intense persecution
of converts from Islam, Christians often flee to Turkey seeking refugee status
and resettlement in the West. But because of the "intimidation of Turkish
authorities," some Christians are afraid to apply for refugee status. Others stay in
Iran and "put up with the persecution," said a spokesman for the ministry, which
requested anonymity. Christians often are abused verbally during their exit interviews and forced to live in "fanatical Muslim towns" where they have to worship
in secret, he said. 
<BR>...The ministry provides food and clothing and helps prepare documents
for families awaiting rulings on their refugee status. During that process, which
can take eight months, the refugees cannot work or move freely within the
country. Several applicants have been refused and some repatriated to Iran, the
spokesman said. The U.S. State Department has been unresponsive to his requests to become involved in the process.

Gene patenting usurps "ownership rights of the Sovereign of the universe," Richard Land of the Southern Baptist Convention said. He was part of an
interfaith coalition of 187 religious leaders who urged the government to ban the
patenting of human genes and genetically engineered animals. The leaders
included Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, and Hindus. They said
at a Washington, D.C., news conference that they do not oppose genetic research,
biotechnology, or the patenting of drugs, but oppose ownership of life. "This is
the beginning of an historic discussion," social activist Jeremy Rifkin said. "Is
life God's creation, or is life a human invention?" 
<BR>...Biotechnology and drug companies said patents are essential if they
are to make progress in finding cures to diseases. Without patent protection,
companies could not fund the genetic research that has led to biotechnical drugs
that treat such diseases as cystic fibrosis and heart disease, an industry spokesman said. "An ill-thought-out scare campaign could stall a breakthrough and
doom us to further unnecessary suffering," said Joan Samuelson, president of the
Parkinson's Action Network.
<BR>...Patenting provides 17 years of protection from competitors seeking to
commercialize discoveries. The U.S. Patent Office announced in 1987 that any
genetically altered animal, human gene, cell, or organ could be patented. It
issued the first animal patent in April 1988 -- for a genetically engineered mouse
used for cancer research that contained genes found in human beings, chickens,
and other animals. The office reportedly has granted patents on nine animals and
has requests on another 200.

Researchers overcame some of the obstacles to transplanting organs
between animals and human beings. By altering the genetic makeup of a strain of
pigs, scientists at Duke University Medical Center fooled the immune systems of
three baboons into accepting pig hearts, researchers reported in the journal
Nature Medicine.
<BR>...The shortage of major organs from human donors motivated researchers
to consider transplants from animals, reports said. While some 40,000 people
wait on the national transplant list, there are only 5,000 donors a year, Time
magazine reported.

The Cincinnati referendum repealing special protection for homosexuals
in civil-rights legislation (NIRR 8/22/94) is constitutional, a three-judge panel of
the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled. People with a homosexual "orientation" don't comprise "an identifiable class," the panel said. The decision reversed
a lower court ruling. It was the first decision to uphold an anti-homosexual-rights
initiative, homosexual-rights lawyers told reporters.

Operation Rescue's leader and "Jane Roe" of the Roe v. Wade decision
have become friends. Every Thursday through Saturday, minister Flip Benham
leads OR protests against the abortion clinic in Dallas where Norma McCorvey
(a.k.a. Jane Roe) is marketing director. On Mondays and Tuesdays, when there
are no clinic appointments, they often sit together on a bench and chat, the Fort
Worth Star-Telegram reported. They joke, exchange pleasantries, and talk about
their beliefs. The Planned Parenthood clinic and OR are headquartered in the
same office building. When OR moved there in March, McCorvey told reporters
she feared there might be violence (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/041795.html">NIRR 4/17</A>).
<BR>..."I like her a lot. We come from the same era," said Benham, an alcoholic
and saloon owner in Florida before becoming a Christian. McCorvey was a 21year-old carnival worker when she became pregnant from a casual affair and
sought an abortion. (The Supreme Court decision came after she gave birth and
put the child up for adoption.) "I like Flip; he's doing his thing," she told the
newspaper. Pro-choice friends "can't understand how I can go over there and be
friendly," she added.

On May 4, Americans around the country prayed for God to send revival."There is no hope
other than divine intervention from the Lord," said Shirley Dobson, chairman of the National
Day of Prayer Task Force. At least 1.5 million believers prayed in 15,000 noontime and
evening rallies in churches, parks, and stadiums, Ken Waggoner, executive director of the
NDP Task Force, told NIRR. 
<BR>...In Chicago, a nationally televised prayer meeting gripped worshipers at Moody Memorial
Church. About 130 key denominational and parachurch leaders, as well as musicians Michael
Card and CeCe Winans, led the stirring concert of prayer. Chicago's WCFC-TV broadcast the
three-hour event, beamed by satellite to more than 2,000 cable companies and two-thirds of
the nation's Christian television stations. A thousand radio stations, as well as Armed Forces
Radio, picked up the feed from Moody Broadcasting Services, which collaborated with the
SkyLight Satellite Network. Meanwhile, in churches around the country, believers worshiped
as they watched the telecast. There has been "nothing like it in the history of the church in
the United States," said Paul Cedar, president of the Evangelical Free Church of America. 
<BR>..."We are going to struggle with God tonight on behalf of the land we love," said Robert
Bakke, head of National Prayer Advance, which initiated the event. Revival stalls when
Christians refuse to repent, speakers said. Those who are unrepentant misjudge the absolute
holiness of God, they warned. "When you and I sin, we trample under foot the Son of God
and we despise the Holy Spirit," said the Southern Baptist Convention's Henry Blackaby.
<BR>...Several speakers singled out racism as a particularly despicable and devastating sin. "Oh,
Lion of Judah, forgive us. Let the walls come down," prayed Raleigh Washington, pastor of
Rock of Our Salvation Church and a leader in the black community. Leaders also asked
forgiveness for their "denominational pride." Others spoke of the blight of abortion. Still
others asked God to protect families, the powerless, widows, orphans, and the elderly. Joseph
Stowell, president of Moody Bible Institute, called on Christians to pray that "God will be put
back in His proper place in the world of ideas" in culture and society. 
<BR>...During the service, those in the pews at Moody intermittently broke into small groups for
prayer. Host Bakke urged viewers to do the same. Meanwhile, computer users held a
simultaneous concert of prayer over CompuServe's Christian Interactive Network. They read
the text of the brief prayers and sermons, and shared prayers with each other.
<BR>...Some 1,200 people joined the national prayer observance in Washington, D.C. Speakers
from every branch of government, the military, the media, industry, business, and
youth-and-family ministries exhorted the nation to repent and pray. Americans must plead
with God for "His healing mercies," Dobson said. Yechiel Eckstein, head of the International
Fellowship of Christians and Jews, a rabbi, sounded the shofar, a horn used in the traditional
call to prayer of the Jewish people. Cardinal Anthony Bevilaqua, the Catholic Archbishop of
Philadelphia, also prayed.
<BR>...America may be on "the verge of the greatest spiritual awakening in history," pastor D.
James Kennedy said. He urged people to spend at least five minutes a day praying for revival.
Increasing participation in the National Day of Prayer "holds out hope for our nation," which
desperately needs revival. Americans have become "ashamed of God," he said. Echoing the
Gettysburg Address, he asked, "Can we long endure after turning our backs on God?"
<BR>...The country's spiritual hunger may lead people back to God, Focus on the Family's James
Dobson told NIRR. "I am ashamed before the Lord" for the country's moral wickedness, he
said. "We have forgotten what shame and guilt are about." Yet the seeds of revival plant
themselves in the despair and debauchery of society. Revival on college campuses (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/050195.html">NIRR 5/1</A>)
is a "hopeful sign, because revival often begins with the young," Dobson said. People of all
ages are searching for spiritual answers, which is good news, even if they look in the wrong
places initially, he said. 
<BR>...In Costa Mesa, Calif., 7,000 congregants from at least a dozen denominations gathered at
Chuck Smith's Calvary Chapel. The rift between Smith and Vineyard Church leader John
Wimber created years ago by philosophical differences between the two closed further.
During the service, members of Calvary Chapel and Anaheim Vineyard, which was a Calvary
Chapel 16 years ago, worshipped together for the first time.
<BR>...Florida coordinator Pam Olsen prayed with Gov. Lawton Chiles in his office after a service

Mainline Protestant, charismatic, Catholic, and full-gospel churches are experiencing revival
in Ottawa, Ont., Canadian pastors report. "A stream of renewal" from the Toronto Vineyard
Airport church (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/022095.html">NIRR 2/20</A>) is touching a dozen churches, according to Ken Hall, leader of
the Ottawa Pastor's Fellowship, a prayer and support group. "Anglican, Catholic, Pentecostal,
charismatic, Covenant Congregational -- it's across the board," he told NIRR.
<BR>...Healings, reconciliation, and salvations characterize the services. The hubs of renewal are
The Life Center, a Pentecostal church in East Ottawa, and Our Lady of Perpetual Help, a
downtown Catholic church. Attendance at a Friday healing service has jumped from 60 to 500
since pastor Dennis Hayes of Our Lady of Perpetual Help visited the Toronto Vineyard last
year. "Things started happening" when he and others prayed after his visits, Hayes told NIRR.
He belongs to Companions of the Cross, an order open to the gifts of the Spirit. Although
outward manifestations of the Spirit are important, the church still focuses on "what the Lord
is doing in people," Hayes said.
<BR>...Churches are growing as drug addicts and prostitutes testify to God's grace at The Life
Center, pastor Barry Boucher said. Between November and April, he baptized 80 new
converts, "about 70 more than usual" during that time, he said. Sunday morning attendance
increased from 350 to 800, forcing the church to add a service. "Nothing has changed, but
everything is changed," Boucher said. The church service still has worship, announcements,
preaching, and offerings, but it is different "because the Lord has touched me so profoundly. I
feel He is saying, 'Now you're working with Me, rather than for Me'."
<BR>...Unity across denominations is strong. "It's as though there were an open heaven over our
city," allowing pastors and churches to work together, Boucher said. "There is certainly more
than tolerance of each other," Joe Muldoon, pastor of St. John the Apostle Catholic Church,
told NIRR. "There is a real support and appreciation for each other." While maintaining
doctrinal differences, the churches are cooperating "in ways we haven't seen before," Hayes
said. 
<BR>...The breakthrough came when Hall arranged for Mark DuPont and Ian Ross of the Toronto
Vineyard to hold a pastors' seminar. About 100 pastors and pastoral leaders attended the
conference at St. John the Apostle and 800 people came for open sessions in the evening,
Muldoon said. "It was very much Spirit blessed, with Catholics and Protestants praising the
Lord together," one attendee said. "I never saw such a significant display of spiritual unity,
Hall said. NIRR 5/15/95

Promise Keepers drew massive crowds in Detroit and Los Angeles. A rally April 28-29
attracted 72,280 men to the Silverdome, while a May 5-6 conference in the Los Angeles
Coliseum drew 72,548. The men's spiritual movement has a total of 13 events planned this
year, with half a million men expected to attend. Last year, 278,600 men attended rallies in
seven cities. 
<BR>...In Detroit, a plane circled the Silverdome during lunch on Saturday, towing a sign that read,
"Men Don't Own Women and Children" in a protest against Promise Keepers. Event emcee
Chuck Bolte commented on the sign later that afternoon, saying, "We couldn't agree more."
The ovation that followed indicated wide agreement among the attendees. Walk Through the
Bible President Bruce Wilkinson challenged the audience to move out of the "second chair of
lukewarmness" into the "first chair of holiness and commitment" to the cause of Christ.
Several men held folding chairs high in the air, symbolizing their acknowledgment of
Wilkinson's charge and their decision to move to the "first chair." Luis Palau's evangelistic
invitation elicited a response from some 7,000 men for new or renewed commitments to
Christ. NIRR 5/15/95

The college revival is moving through more schools and churches (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/050195.html">NIRR 5/1</A>). Among other

Arbor College in Spring Arbor, Mich.; Biola University in Los Angeles, Calif.; Bethel

<BR>...It touched Chico, Calif., when Texas pastor John Avant and two Howard Payne University
students spoke at meetings May 5-7. After Brandi Maguire and Kelly Parrish testified Sunday
morning, services at two local churches ran long as congregants formed lines to confess and
repent of their sins. Similar events occurred at Pleasant Valley Assembly of God, said Ron
Pate, an associate pastor at Esplanade Baptist Church. On Sunday evening, the students
testified at a Nazarene church in nearby Oroville, where 150 people from about 20 churches
gathered. The four-and-a-half-hour service "was the sweetest time," Pate said, as the crowd
"dealt with major issues and repented over serious sin problems." On Friday and Saturday, the
students spoke at gatherings of college students and student ministries, where similar events
occurred, Pate said. NIRR 5/15/95

Thirty-two million people have become Christians in the former Soviet Union through a series
of prime-time specials aired by the Christian Broadcasting Network (NIRR 5/16/94),
according to a poll commissioned by CBN. The poll, conducted by the Ostaniko Sociological
Research Company in Moscow, sampled 4,429 people across the Commonwealth of
Independent States. The method is similar to that used by pollster George Gallup, Jr., CBN
President Michael Little said. The ministry received 11 million requests for Christian
literature from those who watched the programs. More than 750,000 people are enrolled in a
Bible correspondence course through the CBN's Kiev, Ukraine, office. The high response rate
"is the reason we find these numbers so credible," Little said. The series, aired in December
1991, consisted of four one-hour specials. Two were geared toward reaching adults, one to
teen-agers, and one to children. Children saw animated stories with biblical characters, while
indigenous actors dramatized Christian concepts on adult programs, Little said. About 25
million adults viewed at least one show and prayed with the host, the poll shows, and 7
million children under 16 prayed. Other series led 3 million to pray in Argentina in 1990, 4.5
million in Romania in 1994, and 14 million in the Philippines in 1994, Little said. CBN will
air a similar series in Asia this year, Little said. NIRR 5/15/95

Vineyard Christian Fellowship in Boulder, Colo., gave away its weekly collection March 26.
The 1,000-member congregation donated the $77,924 to impoverished tenants of a nearby
mobile-home park. "People just unloaded cash, big- time," said church member Dale
Halbrook. The trailer park, an island of affordable housing for hard-luck families, was
rezoned, forcing the residents to move to make way for offices, retail space, and apartments.
There is no other low-income housing in Boulder, where the average home sells for $248,000,
the Rocky Mountain News reported. An average of four residents per trailer live in the 29
trailers, including renovated school buses and a van. Many cannot afford moving fees, and the
trailers are too old to move anyway, the paper said. 
<BR>...Vineyard members took the money to the trailer park that morning. Residents barely could
believe their eyes when some 300 members of the church assembled in the trailer-park lot and
announced the gift, Vineyard Christian pastor Walt Roberson said. When congregation
members told residents they "were there in the name of the Lord to bless them," many
residents wept, saying they thought no one cared about them. About a dozen people accepted
the Lord in the parking lot. Church members also passed out a truckload of groceries and
served lunch. The church will determine the needs of residents before it helps them find new
housing, employment, day care, and transportation. 
<BR>...Three years ago, Vineyard Christian gave another such gift. One Sunday, the mostly white
church took up a collection of $20,000. Then members traveled six miles to Casey Junior
High School, where Second Baptist Church, a predominantly black congregation, was meeting
during its building campaign. The chairman of the Second Baptist board had just announced
that they needed to raise $19,000 in 10 days. Otherwise, the purchase of a new building
would be canceled and a substantial down payment lost. After they prayed for the money,
Vineyard pastor James Ryle walked in. Hundreds of members of the Vineyard followed him,
filling the aisles and even the stage.
<BR>...Ryle went up front, where he addressed Second Baptist pastor Hansford Vann. "The Lord
told us to take our offering this morning and bring it over to you," Ryle told Vann, handing
him a check. When Vann announced the amount of the check to the congregation, "needless
to say, there was praise," he told NIRR. "You would have had to be there. The whole
building was vibrating." Vann said the Vineyard church knew about the building campaign,
but not about the urgent need for money. 
<BR>...Vineyard Christian's generosity has rebounded. Since the donation to Second Baptist, a
creditor has given the church 35 adjoining acres to add to its 5 acres. And since the gift to
trailer-park residents, the church experienced a "dramatic increase" in its income, Roberson
said. "That's how God responded." NIRR 5/15/95

Christians in Rwanda have lost confidence in churches, but not faith in Christ, World Vision
Rwanda Director Chalon Lee said. Churches where massacres occurred are filled every
Sunday with people "who praise God because they survived," Lee told NIRR. Many clergy
who sanctioned the massacres or kept silent live in refugee camps in Tanzania and Zaire,
where "there is a strange lack of remorse and guilt," Lee said. Those in the camps who
participated in the massacres feel they are being persecuted. "Using the term `reconciliation'
with the refugee population is like sticking them with a hot knife," Lee said. Believers in
Kigali need "new leaders to rise from the ashes." According to Lee, "they know the clergy
may be bad, but God is good."
<BR>...World Vision also is supplying blankets, health care, food, and transportation for those
affected by the recent massacre in a camp for displaced persons in Kibeho, Rwanda. United
Nations observers say 2,000 people died resisting government troops trying to force them
back to their villages. 
<BR>...World Vision is caring for 1,000 unaccompanied children in its four centers, but reports that
some 10,000 more children are without families. The relief agency will use its
Unaccompanied Children's Centers in Gikongoro and Kanazi to house 80-150 additional
children who were separated from their families, Lee said. Many stay with foster families
who take them in, while some are cared for by other ministries. World Vision provides food,
shelter, spiritual comfort, and emotional counseling. Children are encouraged to express their
anger and fear after witnessing the brutality of last year's massacres. Bible studies and prayer
are a "means of healing," Lee said. NIRR 5/15/95

An auditors' investigation shows the former treasurer of the Episcopal Church
misappropriated $2.2 million, Presiding Bishop Edmund Browning said (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/030695.html">NIRR 3/6</A>). Auditors
found that Ellen Cooke deposited church money into her personal accounts, wrote
unauthorized checks, ran up personal expenses on a corporate credit card and other church
accounts, and improperly received money when she resigned in January. Cooke paid nearly
$1 million for a house and a farm and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to renovate
them. Money also went to private-school tuition for her sons, limousine services, jewelry,
clothing, and gifts, investigators said. Cooke also deposited $90,000 into the pastoral
discretionary account of St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Montclair, N.J., where her husband,
Nicholas, served as parish priest.
<BR>...Cooke said she would accept full responsibility for "any inappropriate use of funds" and

A federally funded study of the power of prayer is under way at the University of New
Mexico. The National Institutes of Health awarded psychiatry professor Scott Walker nearly
$30,000 to head the research project. At issue is whether prayers said by concerned but
uninvolved believers on behalf of specific individuals can improve chances of their recovery
from alcohol or drug abuse. Researchers will assemble a pool of "clients" from a substance
abuse-treatment facility. Protestants, Catholics, and Jews will pray for half of them. Urine
screens and psychological assessments will be used to measure results.
<BR>...Critics are having a field day: What if Protestant prayers carry more weight than Catholic
ones? Will it make a difference how seasoned one is at praying? What if a friend or relative
prays for someone in the no-pray-ers group? Will results be skewed if a client in the pray-er
group secretly prays for himself or herself? Americans United for Separation of Church and
State, which opposes government spending on religion, chimed in. Asked AU spokesman

Finland: Paavo Lipponen, the country's new prime minister, has been nicknamed Moses,
Ecumenical News International reported. During a debate in the general elections Lipponen
explained his slow speech by quoting Moses: "I am slow of speech and have a clumsy

Europe, "praying into some of the hurts" left behind in France, Belgium, and Germany after
World War II.
<P>
France: The government banned a book by a Muslim author, saying it could pose a danger to 
public order. The Licit and Illicit in Islam, by Youssef Qaradhawi, contains an "anti-western
tone and ideas contrary to the laws and fundamental values" of France, authorities alleged. A
spokesman at Al Qalam, the Paris publisher of the book, said the volume ex- plains the
Koran. "If this work is inflammatory for the West, then so is the Koran," he said.
<P>
Russia: Thirty students attended the first class of the Russian-American Christian University,

Mexico: At a conference of 75 Latin American Catholic bishops from 22 countries, leading
prelates said illegal drugs pose the biggest problem for their countries. Most of the blame
rests on America because uncontrolled U.S. consumption opens them to "the terrible
temptation of the dollar-god," the bishops said. They also protested U.S. support for family
planning efforts in the region. Some criticized evangelical Protestants, alleging they have
subverted the region's culture and divided its people. A conference statement condemned
unrestrained free markets for encouraging inequality, but rejected Marxism as a solution to
economic and social ills.
Mexico: President Ernesto Zedillo has not made any effort to help the 20,000 to 30,000
evangelical Indians living in virtual exile from the state of Chiapas, World Pulse reported
(NIRR 7/25/94). Aaron Lara, a pastor who belongs to an evangelistic association in Mexico,
said his group "has not achieved even the slightest contact with Zedillo." Former presi- dent
Carlos Salinas had worked to resolve the problems between evangelicals and Catholics in the
area, at one point helping obtain the resignation of a mayor who had expelled the rebels.

Peru: Christians in Tochache carry work tools with them when they go to church to fool
terrorists and drug dealers who dominate the region. The Christians meet for secret worship in
remote areas of the jungle. In worship they practice "silent singing" moving their mouths but

<P>
In the midst of trauma in Oklahoma City, God is at work. The catastrophic
April 19 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building opened a soulsearching dialogue among Americans about their spiritual condition.
<BR>...A number of the dead and presumed dead are Christians, active workers
in their churches. The dead include pastor Gilbert Martinez, 35, of Tabernacle of
Faith. He often took Spanish-speaking members of his congregation to the
building to help them fill out forms. A church member said Martinez had taken
Emilio Tapia, another blast victim, to the building to get a Social Security card.
The pastor is survived by his wife and five children, one who is two weeks old. 
<BR>...Survivors told stories of the testing of their faith. Jamie Norfleet dropped
the phone when a fellow member of her prayer circle at First Baptist Church,
Stillwater, asked her to pray for the victims of the explosion. "I knew my
husband was in there," she told Associated Baptist Press. Marine Corps recruiter
Randy Norfleet survived despite a 40% blood loss and 250 stitches to close his
wounds. He never lost consciousness in the ambulance because "I was concentrating on praying. It was a prayer of thanksgiving" for survival, he said. Doctors
said Norfleet would likely lose the sight in his right eye. "Losing an eye is a
small thing," Norfleet said. "Whatever brings you closer to God is a blessing.
Through all this I've been brought closer to God. I've become more dependent
on Him and less on myself."
<BR>...Some 5,000 people mourned for Mickey Maroney, 50, at Council Road
Baptist Church in suburban Bethany. As his widow and three children grieved
privately at home, members of his extended church family got on their knees in
the sanctuary and shared their grief with God over the man who had been a
beloved mentor to college-age men at the church. Maroney, a Secret Service
agent, had planned to attend a training session in nearby Norman that morning.
At the last minute, a friend Maroney had been ministering to in hopes he would
accept Christ went in his place. When the friend learned that Maroney had been
killed, he said he knew why Maroney died instead of him. "Mickey was ready to
meet God, and I'm not," the man told The Washington Post. Maroney's brother
Jimmy said that when he saw a photo of Timothy McVeigh, who has been
charged in the bombing, he did not react angrily. "The Lord is removing anger,"
Maroney said.
<BR>...A wrenching scene was playing out at First Christian Church as families
huddled awaiting word of loved ones still trapped in the wreckage of the building. Hopes faded with each passing hour. The death toll could climb past 200
once the search of the building's remnants is complete. More than 70 ministers
from many denominations were there to offer support for the families. 
<BR>...Anger often was met with love, even among Christians grappling with both.
Callers swamped Oklahoma City radio talk shows. Those callers who insisted
that the perpetrators be shot on sight were followed by others who pleaded for
prayers for the bombers' salvation. The desire to forgive rather than seek
revenge, which was expressed by many people in the Bible-Belt city, impressed
reporters. An atheist told a local pastor he had never experienced such love. 
<BR>...Several churches downtown, including First United Methodist Church and
St. Joseph's Cathedral, were heavily damaged. Rescue workers were using the
lobby of First Methodist as a temporary morgue. Pastor Nick Harris of 1,700member First UMC was in his office when the blast occurred and narrowly
escaped injury. The church sponsors a downtown Loaves and Fishes noon Bible
study and prayer ministry, and a number of members were affected by the blast.
His congregation met at a university campus auditorium April 23. The blast
shattered stained-glass windows at First Baptist Church.
<BR>...Suddenly, Christianity became a prominent theme in news stories.
Television viewers watched as people turned to the church for comfort and
struggled to answer the question: How could God have let this happen? There is
a mystery to suffering, and some questions defy easy answers, Billy Graham said
at a memorial service at the State Fair Arena. "I have to accept by faith that God
is a God of love and mercy and compassion, even in the midst of suffering. The
Bible says God is not the author of evil."
<BR>...The caring acts of local believers also took the spotlight. "People are
testifying to what they believe through helping out the people hurt in the bombing," Jim Tucker, pastor of Hillcrest Christian Church, told reporters. Hundreds
of ministers worked around the clock to comfort rescue workers. Others stationed
themselves near victims' families waiting for news, or made death-notification
visits to the families. Christian relief agencies, including The Salvation Army,
responded quickly. Baptist Medical Center gave free counseling.
<BR>...When Americans talked about their lost security, Christians explained
their broader perspective. "Here we are in a good Midwestern town, with good
neighbors, but you can be driving down at Fifth and Harvey and have it all end
in an instant," Gene Garrison, pastor of First Baptist Church, told Baptist Press.
"This just proves that we don't have any security in this world" outside of Christ.
<BR>...Prejudice against Muslims surfaced. Many, including some in the media,
jumped to the apparently erroneous conclusion that Islamic fundamentalists were
to blame. Muslim leaders repeatedly stressed that Americans need to understand
that Islam has a pluralistic tradition.
<BR>...Another potentially ominous trend emerged. Some reporters tenuously
linked last year's conservative election victory, partially driven by religious
conservatives, to the bombing. "The radical right" has an extremist component
that "plainly was a force in the 1994 elections," wrote Philip Weiss in Time
magazine. The "coalition," Weiss wrote, includes tax protesters, Christian home
schoolers, those who fear one-world government, gun-rights activists, and "selfreliant types" who resent the federal government. It is several steps from this
movement "to the extremist-fringe thinking that seems to have bred the Oklahoma City bombing," he said.

More than 4,000 Christian leaders from almost 200 countries will converge
on Seoul, South Korea, May 17-25 for the largest evangelism conference ever.
The Global Consultation on World Evangelism is part of AD 2000 and Beyond's
(NIRR 8/22/94) attempt to establish "a church for every people and the gospel
for every person" by the year 2000. GCOWE '95 will "mobilize and motivate
churches" in world evangelism, AD 2000 International Director Luis Bush told
NIRR. The eight-day event will include several plenary sessions. Participants will
break areas down by continents, countries, and people tracks so the leaders can
develop methods and strategies for evangelizing. 
<BR>...AD 2000's goals are attainable because emerging missions agencies in Latin
America, Asia, and Africa can help the "tired churches of the West," Bush cited
evangelical scholar John Stott as saying. Some 66% of GCOWE participants are
non-Western and will bear 75% of the conference's costs.

The "heartbeat of evangelism is very much alive" in Canada. So said the
executive director of Vision 2000 Canada, Don Moore, after a national evangelization consultation called Toward 2000: Vision and Challenge. More than 200
delegates attended the national conference, producing a declaration that voiced
hopes, confessions, and plans for evangelism in Canada. The Burlington Declaration includes a confession of unchristlike attitudes, a reaffirmation of the need
for evangelism, a call for renewal, and a commitment to make outreach and
discipleship central to the church's activities. The draft was written by the
leaders of six evangelical denominations and was amended by participants from
other denominations in round-table discussions. "There's nothing like this in the
history of Canada," Moore said of the declaration.     
<BR>...The national consultation capped eight conferences held in key provinces of the country. The series was designed to determine the organization's
progress toward making the gospel available to every Canadian by 2000.

Sudan's Islamic government is allowing Christian programming to air on
its national television station, International Media Ministries reports. IMM, a
missionary arm of the Assemblies of God Division of Foreign Missions, is
working with other Christian broadcast ministries to produce a television series.
The soap-opera format will deal with issues that "people in North Africa face in
their daily lives" and offer a Christian perspective, IMM director David Lee told
NIRR. He said the programs will present the gospel, but are not intended as an
rebuttal to Islam. Although IMM will provide training and technical assistance,
the Sudan project was launched by HS Radio in Finland. It also received production assistance from International Russian Radio/TV (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/030695.html">NIRR 3/6</A>).

In Ambur, India, about 700 people attended a well-publicized memorial
service for the wife of a highly regarded Indian Lutheran minister. Afterward,
some 50 came forward to get more information about the church, Johannes
Gedrat of the Lutheran Church (Missouri Synod) told NIRR. Gedrat, the LCMS'
area secretary for southern Asia, finished a 16-day tour of LCMS churches in 22
cities, villages, and towns in India and Sri Lanka. Gedrat saw 25 people baptized
together in one town, and 36 converted during another service. 
<BR>...The indigenous church in the two countries is missions-minded and is
reaching out effectively through social works "with the final objective of preaching the Word," he said. One example is a home for young girls who, lacking
schools in their districts, have to travel as much as 12 hours to attend school.
Some 350 girls are housed, fed, and cared for at the home by indigenous church
members. Other services include schools where young men and women can learn
skills such as tailoring, typing, and computing.

Billed as Nepal's first evangelistic crusade, Luis Palau's Good News Easter
Festival drew some 26,000 people over four days, the Luis Palau Evangelistic
Association said. At each meeting, hundreds of people responded to the gospel
message and decision cards indicated some 1,400 prayed to receive Christ,
LPEA's Mike Umlandt said. About 65 Christian churches are in Kathmandu, he
estimated, and most participated in the April 12-14 crusade. Although Christians
were granted freedom to worship in 1990, Nepal is a Hindu state where proselytism is forbidden. Those who convert to Christianity face persecution from their
families and community. The Easter festival was historic, said Robert Karthak,
pastor of Gyaneshwar Church in Kathmandu.

Muslim extremists attacked a predominantly Catholic town in the Philippines, possibly to start a religious war between Christians and Muslims, News
Network International reported. Fifty-three people were killed and 35 taken
hostage by the 200-strong guerrilla force that ransacked the southern town of
Ipil. According to one survivor, about a third of the hostages were killed on
April 15 when their captors beheaded them and mutilated their bodies. More than
20 Christian-owned businesses were destroyed and about 2,700 residents of the
town are without homes. Most of the dead are Catholics. The attackers apparently belong to two Muslim extremist groups, Abu Sayyaf (NIRR 8/22/94) and The
Islamic Command Council, which wish to make the southern island of Mindanao
an "Islamic homeland for Filipino Muslims," the news agency reported.

Operation Sea Legs is a Youth With A Mission initiative to create a mobile
unit for constructing and fitting artificial limbs for amputees in the developing
world. The facility, now under construction, can be loaded on a flatbed truck and
taken inland in countries where the YWAM ship Anastasis docks, project
director Paul Moehring told NIRR.
<BR>...The mobile factory will employ computer-aided designing and machining
to create the prosthetics. They will be constructed from thermoplastic -- a sturdy,
flexible material that allows users to participate in heavy work and sports. Of the
world's 3 to 4 million amputees, some 95% reside in the developing world,
where injuries mainly are due to farm accidents, violence, and a lack of medical
knowledge and facilities, Moehring said. For such people, an artificial limb can
mean the difference between begging and performing fruitful labor. Although
funds have been raised to build the inside of the facility and to buy the computer
equipment, the project still needs funds for the limbs. For more information, call (800) 424-SHIP.

Enthusiastic students experiencing revival on campuses across the
country say they are tired of being pegged as Generation X. "They want to be
known as the generation that turns this country around," said Woody Northcutt,
Colorado Christian University chaplain. A flood of repentance during services at
the Lakewood school this month mirrored similar phenomena on campuses
across the country (NIRR 4/17; NIRR 4/3; NIRR 3/20). One result of revival at
CCU is that more male students say they want to be morally pure and learn to be
leaders, Northcutt said. "Now we've got some men to train for leadership."
<BR>...Repentance by students and faculty broke down bitterness and divisions
at CCU that Northcutt characterized as "a spirit of oppression." CCU students are
so ardent about personal and corporate renewal on campus that 25 students who
had planned to drop out of the school decided to stay. "What happened in the
last two weeks has changed their lives, and they want to come back and see
more of what God is doing," Northcutt said.
<BR>...A similar reconciliation occurred at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky., which is enduring one of the most turbulent and bitter
times in its history. When the school announced that Brownwood, Texas, pastor
John Avant planned to speak during a chapel service, some on campus saw his
appearance as an administration ploy to divert attention from the school's
problems. A rumored student boycott of the service did not occur, but instead,
some 1,000 students attended the April 13 service. As the low-key, 45-minute
service ended, Avant dismissed the students, telling them they were free to return
to classes. Nevertheless, hundreds of students -- and some faculty and administrators -- came forward to repent of sins, including bitterness. Initially, because
microphones were not set up, students "started standing up where they were and
shouting their confessions," Avant told NIRR. A faculty member said there may
be "more pain before ultimate healing," but "the student atmosphere is so
different now."
<BR>...Teachers, students, and parents nationwide had prayed fervently for
campus revival. Barbara Blanchard, a 1954 Wheaton College graduate whose
daughter attends the school, is one example. Blanchard, a pastor's wife from
Sioux City, Iowa, said she had such a burning desire to see revival come to
Wheaton that she decided to "be radical." In November, Blanchard spent two
weeks at Wheaton praying and meeting with revival-minded students and faculty.
"It was something my husband understood I needed to do," she said.
<BR>...Then, Blanchard traveled to New York to seek prayers from Brooklyn
Tabernacle, which itself is experiencing revival. "I didn't know a soul. I didn't
know how to get there or anything," she said. Members of the multi-ethnic
church agreed to pray each night for 30 days for Wheaton, a largely white,
upper-middle-class school. "We are so needy as white people," Blanchard said.
"Sometimes others can teach us how to love." Revival later broke out at
Blanchard's Sioux City church when three Wheaton students spoke there. It was
"glorious" to see whole families, including small children, exhibit "great brokenness, love, and compassion," she said.
<BR>...Christian students at Iowa State University, in Ames, experienced revival
April 10. Some 300 members of several Christian organizations on campus
waited for several hours to come to the microphone and confess sin, repent, and
pray. The meeting, which started at 8:30 p.m. with testimonies from four
Wheaton students about similar events on their campus, lasted until 5 a.m.,
Campus Crusade for Christ director Mike Sutton said. "I sat there stunned. The
effects of sin on Christians' lives was so prevalent," he said. Leaders also
repented. "Our students don't often see our staff broken and honest," Sutton said,
noting that leaders must set the example by being vulnerable to others.
<BR>...More schools where revival broke out recently include Indiana Wesleyan,
Marion, Ind.; Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, S. Hamilton, Mass.; Judson
College, Elgin, Ill.,; George Fox College, Newberg, Ore.; and Multnomah Bible
College, Portland, Ore. Students who experienced revival spoke at churches and
high schools. Numerous similar phenomena also occurred.

Ex-criminals are giving frightened and frail elderly people a better life in
innercity Cleveland. For 15 years, the church-based program Community Re-Entry has screened, hired, and trained ex-offenders. They are sent out in Care
Teams to impoverished communities, where they escort the elderly to the bank,
store, or doctor. Senior citizens say it's a godsend to have the freedom to leave
their apartments without fear, program administrator Charles See told NIRR. He
employs about 80 workers and pays them up to $25,000 a year. Workers also
intervene to limit gang fights and other problems at public high schools. Organizers say that when the program started, they were concerned that ex-offenders
would be a bad influence, but that has not happened.
<BR>...Various denominations sponsor Community Re-Entry, which is administered by Cleveland's Lutheran Metropolitan Ministry Association. The city and
area foundations provide funding. Cleveland organizers have helped start similar

A Minnesota group is linking successful churches with those that desire to
grow. Minneapolis-based Teaching Church Network grew out of an idea by Leith
Anderson, an author, speaker, and pastor of Wooddale Church in Eden Prairie.
Anderson's Baptist General Conference congregation has helped many other
churches become more effective in their outreach, according to Paul Borden,
TCN executive director. Anderson's idea was to form a national network of
successful congregations from various denominations and ethnic backgrounds to
disciple churches that may "need an extra nudge," Borden said.
<BR>..."Sometimes I feel like a singles dating service," said Borden, whose job
is to match teaching churches with those to be mentored. The 12-church network
includes Episcopal, Baptist, Mennonite, Christian Church, and independent
congregations. Mentoring includes assessment of the church's strengths and
weaknesses, a forum on areas of growth and outreach, and an accountability
period with a two-year plan to change. For information, call (612) 942-9866.

More than half the baptisms performed in Southern Baptist Convention
churches are on people who have been baptized before, an SBC Home Mission
Board survey found. Only 40% of recently baptized adults in the study reported
a first-time commitment to Christ as the reason for being baptized. Another 40%
said it was part of rededicating their lives to Christ. Some 14% said they were
baptized as a requirement of moving their membership from a non-SBC church.
Among those baptized before, the median age for their first baptism was 10, and
33% were baptized at an SBC church.
<BR>...In reporting the study, mission board officials questioned whether the
pressure to achieve numbers was driving pastors to encourage rebaptism. They
suggested that pastors must spend more time on follow-up teaching and nurturing. In preparing for the survey, they found that churches already had lost
contact with about a third of the people they baptized in 1993.

In what may be a first, the Internal Revenue Service revoked a church's
tax exemption for engaging in partisan politics. It announced April 10 that
contributions to the Church at Pierce Creek in Binghamton, N.Y. (NIRR
12/14/92), no longer will be deductible. In a revocation notice earlier, it cited the
church for publishing a pre-election advertisement against Bill Clinton in USA
Today and The Washington Times. The "open letter" ad claimed Clinton supported abortion, distribution of condoms in public schools, and homosexuality. It
questioned how anyone could vote for "a man of this character." Pastor Daniel
Little said the church had the right to inform the Christian community of where
Clinton stood on moral issues. The nondenominational church has a nationally

Dangerous, totalitarian, and divisive religious groups will be banned from
Russia under an amendment passed unanimously last month by the parliament.
The measure represents a compromise proposal framed by evangelical legal
experts, sources said. It was introduced in the legislature by the Christian
democratic faction to head off sterner proposals by Russian Orthodox Church
leaders and nationalists, they added. Orthodox pressure already has resulted in a
new policy that requires foreign missionaries to leave the country and re-apply
for visas when their current ones expire, Baptist Press reported. Previously, visas
were renewable upon request within the country. 
<BR>...A Russian court banned the Japanese Aum Shinri Kyo sect from
Russian soil and airwaves, and ordered its Russian branch closed. The group is

to a higher court. Meanwhile, Russian Orthodox officials urged a media blackout

Medical researchers are taking a closer look at religious experience as a
possible cure for drug and alcohol addiction. Some 70 clinicians from around the
country explored the issue at Spiritual Dimensions in Clinical Research, a threeday conference in Virginia. Studies summarized at the meeting characterized an
addict's life as lacking meaning and purpose, craving pleasure, or reaching a
state of "joylessness." UCLA psychiatrist Frank Gawin cited studies showing the
success of religious groups in breaking addictions. Alcoholics Anonymous
members who make strong commitments to the spiritual basis of the AA program gain sufficient "meaning in life" to displace the need for alcohol, according
to data cited by William Miller, a research director at the University of New
Mexico. To ignore religion "is to violate scientific curiosity," he said.
<BR>..."Drug abuse is not a problem with drugs. It's a problem with pleasure,"
Duke University's Roy Matthews said. Since pleasure is the basis of addiction, it
could be the solution to it, he theorized. He pointed to differences between
selfish and selfless pleasure. The latter can produce a mood state, possibly
altering the brain's chemicals, he said. Selfless pleasure is found in religion, and
"the most pleasurable part of religion is the experience of God."

A federal judge ordered a northern Mississippi school district to stop
prayers and Bible reading over a school intercom. Members of a Bible club at
the 1,300-pupil North Ponotoc Attendance Center prayed and read each morning.
Although the exercises were student-initiated and student-led, use of the school's
public address system to reach into all classrooms implied an unconstitutional
seal of approval by the school, U.S. District Judge Neal Biggers ruled. The
practice resulted in segregation along religious lines, he said. He issued a
temporary injunction on the recitations, but said they could be held before classes
in the school gym. Trial was set for next March. The ruling came in response to
a complaint by Lisa Herdahl last December. She claimed five of her children

Germany: More than 1,000 independent churches have been established since 1980, idea
reported. According to Discipling A Whole Nation (DAWN), the majority of the churches call
themselves "charismatic," "free church," or "biblical," and are not part of a mainline church.
Approximately 300 free charismatic churches were established from 1988 to 1993, the group
said.
<P>
Romania: The Orthodox Church has experienced massive growth and gained increasing
influence since 1990. A survey by a sociological research group found that 82% of
Romanians described the church as "good or very good" and only 7% found it "not very
satisfactory." Another report claims that 87% of Romania's 22.8 million citizens are Orthodox
and that the church has begun building 382 new churches since 1989.
<P>
Netherlands: Some 500 Dutch Christians vowed during a multicultural service in Utrecht to
battle racism, Ecumenical News International reports. "We pledge to God and to each other to
be allies in the struggle against racism," said Karel Blei, secretary-general of the Netherlands
Reformed Church. The service was part of a multi-church crusade against racism in Dutch
society.
<P>
Slovakia: The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America has granted $150,000 for a seminary
building in Slovakia. Pastors are desperately sought in the formerly Communist country and
some 100 parishes are in need, according to Jan Holcik, head of the churchwide council of
the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession. The funds, together with $450,000 from
the Lutheran World Federation, will be used to construct an administration and classroom
buildings. 
<P>
England: Anglican Bishop of London David Hope, a target of a homosexual "outing"
campaign, was appointed to the Church of England's second-highest post, Archbishop of
York. Hope, 54, refused to define himself as either homosexual or heterosexual. He said he
has lived a celibate life in "a sort of gray area." He is a leader of the traditionalist
Anglo-Catholic wing of the church, which advocates reunion with Rome. Hope will succeed
John Habgood, who retires Aug. 31.

Bolivia: President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has ordered the military to allow Protestants to
worship at military facilities, News Network International reported. Last year the Supreme
Commander of the Armed Forces in Brazil, Gen. Reynaldo Caceres, banned Protestant clergy
from military installations, including hospitals. Although the president countermanded the
order, Caceres has refused to obey it and faces disciplinary charges.

<B>Joni Eareckson Tada won an essay
contest that will allow her ministry to
deliver 200 free wheelchairs to Ghana</B>.
Eareckson Tada's JAF Ministries, an
outreach to the disabled, had the chairs,
but lacked funds for transportation. When
an aide heard of a Royal Dutch Airlines
contest offering free airfare as the prize,
Eareckson Tada entered. Her winning
essay describes first-hand the freedom
that wheelchairs offer to those limited by
a disability. Eareckson Tada has been a
quadriplegic since a 1957 diving accident. She and two dozen JAF Ministries
staff members will fly free to deliver the
chairs to the West African country.

<B>Religious broadcaster Vic Eliason has
agreed to pay a former wire service reporter $255,000 to settle a lawsuit</B>. Reporter Julie Brienza claimed Eliason led
a successful radio campaign five years

International because she is a lesbian.
Eliason reportedly complained to UPI
after learning Brienza was researching a
free-lance article for a homosexual-oriented newspaper. The article was to explore
the influence of religious conservatives
on broadcasting. The wire service said
Brienza was fired for violating rules
against writing for other publications.

<B>Cadets no longer will be forced to
endure simulated rapes in a training program, the U.S</B>. Air Force announced. The
change comes after complaints by dozens of male and female cadets at the Air
Force Academy in Colorado Springs.
ABC's 20-20 suggested that some who
had undergone the training suffered serious emotional trauma similar to
symptoms reported by actual rape victims. The Air Force said its program was
aimed at training recruits to cope with
sexual assault in wartime prison camps,
as experienced by both male and female
U.S. personnel in the Gulf War. Training
now will be done by video.

<B>Children can display Christmas, Hanukkah, and Easter symbols on greeting
cards in post office lobbies, the U.S</B>.
Postal Service decided. A 1994 policy
prohibited such displays. The policy

<B>A Seventh-day Adventist lost his franchise on three Texaco stations because
he refused to keep them open on Saturday, the sect's day of worship</B>. At
Texaco's request, a District Court ordered Barry Davis to remain open seven
days a week. When he refused, the
franchise agreement was terminated. Davis argued that the contract did not require keeping the station open every day,
according to the Rutherford Institute,
which is representing him. Davis has appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
<P>
<B>United Methodists published a 384page hymnal in sign language</B>. Hymns for
Signing, which was developed for worship services, contains all the hymns in
the 1989 United Methodist Hymnal translated into American Sign Language. The
hymnal was developed by Illinois pastor
LeVerle Carrington. His wife, who is deaf,
expects the sign language hymnal will be
a breakthrough in worship for the deaf,
Carrington said. Call 1-800-251-3320 for

<P>
<B>More than 60 Salvation Army officers,
national advisory board members, and
their wives fell April 8 when the veranda
on which they were having a barbecue
collapsed</B>. Forty-three people were injured and at least 29 hospitalized with
broken bones and internal injuries. Board
member Betty Gerish was in critical condition. The dinner was held at the home
of B. Franklin Skinner, a former chairman
of the board, in Buckhead, Ga. 
A judge ordered three members of
Holy Cross Catholic Church in Youngwood, Pa., to stop their loud praying of
the rosary. The disruptions occurred during Masses, baptisms, hymn-singing, and
reflective prayer sessions. A lawsuit said
the women began disrupting services in
1993 and ignored pleas from the pastor
and local bishop. The suit also alleged
that the women splashed holy water
around the church. This month, the women took their rosary-shouting to a cathedral in nearby Greensburg, and the diocese went back to court.

<B>Pollster George Gallup found that 90%
of American adults believe in heaven</B>.
Nearly three-fourths of American adults
believe in hell, but very few think they will
end up there, Gallup found. Also, nearly
80% of American adults believe in miracles; 95% of American adults say they
believe in God or a universal spirit; 3%
say they don't believe in God; and 65%
of American adults believe in the devil.

<B>Lay evangelist Kara Michelle BynumBuster, 28, was fatally shot by an errant
bullet outside the Lighthouse Church of
God in Christ in the Watts area of Los
Angeles</B>. She died of a head wound in
the arms of her father, Edward, pastor of
the church. Police said she had scooped
up her niece from harm's way after a
shootout erupted nearby between a
would-be car thief and the owner of the
car. They said the fatal rifle bullet was
fired by the suspected thief, who eluded
capture. Bynum-Buster commuted daily
to the church from Redlands, two hours
away, to participate in social and evangelistic outreach among the poor.
<P>
<B>Operation Rescue moved its national
headquarters office next door to an abortion clinic in Dallas</B>. The clinic, known as
A Choice for Women, and the pro-life
group are separated by a wall in the
same two-story office building. The location was a coincidence, OR Director Flip
Benham told reporters. But, he added, it
is a great place for the church to be -- "at
the gates of hell." The clinic's marketing
director is Norma McCorvey, the "Jane
Roe" in the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme
Court ruling that legalized abortion.
McCorvey said clinic officials are concerned about guaranteeing the safety of
their patients and doctor. She also complained that the office complex had
raised the clinic's rent by $35,600. Managers of the complex said they needed
the extra money to pay for higher insurance premiums. They also said the
clinic's broker had not accurately represented the nature of its business.
Mississippi stripped Thomas Tucker, a
leading abortionist, of his medical license
March 16, EP News reported. The Board
of Medical Licensure revoked Tucker's
license, which had been suspended last
year after state officials found him guilty
on 32 charges, including unprofessional
conduct and mishandling drugs. Tucker
had performed 60% of Mississippi's more
than 7,000 abortions annually. During his
suspension in Mississippi, Tucker lost his
medical license in Alabama when a patient died. A jury awarded $2 million to a
woman injured as a result of an abortion
he performed. He also faces a lawsuit
from a former client who says a botched
abortion left her sterile and disfigured.

<A NAME="THOUSANDSMORESTUDENTS,"><H3>THOUSANDS MORE STUDENTS, FACULTY EXPERIENCE REVIVAL</H3></A>
<P>
<B>The powerful, national revival that began in Brownwood, Texas, continues
to jolt American college campuses (NIRR 4/3; NIRR 3/20)</B>. Thousands more
students -- as well as some faculty and administrators -- have participated in
public confession, restitution, and reconciliation.
<BR><B>..."In 25 years of teaching I've never seen anything like this," church
historian John Woodbridge, a Trinity Evangelical Divinity School professor, told
NIRR</B>. "It is a wonderful work of the Spirit of God." Phenomena have occurred
on campuses of various sizes and denominations, but are so similar that "it is
uncanny," he said. Students are waiting in chapel lines late into the night to
publicly uncover long-hidden sins, many schools say. Students disclosed problems with bitterness, laziness, sexual immorality, pornography, alcohol, drugs,
hypocrisy, materialism, past sexual abuse, and broken families. They then
committed themselves to the Lord for forgiveness and deliverance.
<BR><B>...Professors and staff members who attend the meetings say their lives
have been changed, too</B>. "It's not just the students, but we all have come to a
fork in the road in terms of our spiritual walks," said Taylor University Provost
and Executive Vice President Daryl Yost. "We have to acknowledge the Holy
Spirit is doing a unique piece of work."
<BR><B>...Schools where revival has broken out in the last few weeks are Trinity
College and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Ill.; Asbury
College in Wilmore, Ky.; Illinois Baptist College in Galesburg, Ill.; Gordon
College in Wenham, Mass.; Eastern Nazarene College in Quincy, Mass.; Taylor
University in Upland, Ind.; Northwestern College in St</B>. Paul, Minn.; Crown
College in St. Bonifacius, Minn.; and Cornerstone College (formerly Grand
Rapids Baptist College) in Grand Rapids, Mich. 
<BR><B>...The dramatic manner in which the revival is unfolding surprised almost
everyone, but many students and faculty have been pleading with God for years
to begin a revival</B>. At Gordon College, where students and faculty had been
fasting and praying, "the kindling was stacked high" and waiting for the right
spark, one leader said. Prior to a large, scheduled chapel service, faculty and
student leaders met for prayer March 29. "The sweet stillness of God's presence
filled the room" as students began weeping and confessing sins, Dean of the
Chapel Gary Stratton told NIRR. Ironically, the meeting took place in "an upper
room" at the school as winds with gusts of 60 mph howled outside, Stratton said.
"We were waiting for tongues of fire," he joked.
<BR><B>...The revival continues to be contagious</B>. Students, chaplains, college
administrators, pastors, and Christian media have begun spreading the news.
Meetings scheduled in advance -- such as The National Student Leadership
Conference at Taylor University April 7-9, which was attended by student
leaders from 22 schools, and Beacon '95, a New England student conference
held the same days -- seemed to have been providentially timed to maximize
news of the revival, participants said. The Francis Asbury Society said requests
for its video depicting the 1970 Asbury College revival increased steadily. The
group now is sending 100 videos a week to churches, Christian colleges, campus
ministries, and Christian student organizations on secular campuses.
<BR><B>...This is not just some fad, but a genuine movement of God, those who
experience the revival say</B>. There may be a "temptation to get on the bandwagon,
but this is not the case of the majority," Taylor University's Yost said. According
to Trinity's Woodbridge, "This is not about students trying to compete with
bigger and better sins." Eastern Nazarene President Kent Hill told NIRR that
meetings he attended there have been so "awe-inspiring" that he finds it difficult
to describe them. "You feel like it's almost blasphemous to convey in words the
power that you've sensed in the remarkable openness of the students." Unlike
revivals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, "there was nothing voyeuristic
or in any sense inappropriate. Yet, clearly, students were talking about the most
important issues in their lives, those things they are most ashamed of, afraid of,
or struggling with," he said. This generation has been "so hyped," one leader
said, "that they know when something is phony and when it is real." 
<BR><B>...Although the revival touches deep emotions, it is not being driven by
emotionalism, leaders say</B>. During some services, such as one at Gordon College,
students sit in "such complete and total stillness that you would almost think they
have fallen asleep," Stratton said. Leaders agree that confessions are not being
manipulated. Stratton told students they were free to confess private sins publicly, but only sins against the community required such a confession.
<BR><B>...Follow-up is crucial, leaders say</B>. The immediate, cathartic experience of
deep, public repentance can begin long-term change for many people. "When
God does something like this, He marks people for life and they'll never be the
same again," Wheaton College Chaplain Tim Beougher told NIRR after revival
occurred there. Many students who have testified at the services say they desire
to be held accountable for living a faithful Christian life. To meet those needs,
college chaplains and deans are busy forming accountability groups and Bible
studies, and increasing the availability of psychological counseling. Eastern
Nazarene, for example, formed student groups that meet with faculty members
about specific issues such as pornography, family problems, or anger at God.
<BR><B>..."My main concern is that those who shared from the bottom of their
hearts will be ministered to in a sincere and ongoing manner," Yost said</B>. "What
do we do from this point forward? How are we going to treat individuals who
have confessed deep, deep sins?" Some of the struggles that were confessed will
take time, effort, and help to overcome, he said. It's not just someone else's
problem anymore, Yost said. "It is our problem because we were there and they
shared it with us." 
<BR><B>...The repentance and renewal being experienced on college campuses may
be a prelude to "a major movement of the Spirit," Hill said</B>. Without repentance,
revival "is blocked up." Students are "glowing over the experience" and a "mood
of anticipation" fills campuses, he said. "My hope is that pastors all over the
country will invite students into their churches to speak about reconciliation,"
Woodbridge said. "One of the things that really is holding back the evangelical
church is lack of reconciliation between members. These young people are
leading the way for reconciliation."

<B>Some 500,000 charismatic Catholics gather at the Luneta Park in Manila for
a weekly Mass and healing rally, according to Russell Mask, a doctoral candidate
who lived there</B>. Worshipers are members of El Shaddai, a fast-growing charismatic movement in the Philippine Catholic Church, he said. A central purpose of
the El Shaddai message is to bring nominal Catholics to a personal relationship
with Christ through a born-again experience similar to Protestant conversions.
The group diverges from some traditional Catholic teachings, such as seeking
mediation of the saints. 
<BR><B>...In its 10 years, El Shaddai has started 900 chapters and mission centers
in the Philippines and 33 international chapters</B>. Some 4 million attended its ninth
anniversary celebration in 1993, the group estimated. Members report physical
and psychological healings and deliverance from vices and financial problems.
<BR><B>...Millionaire Mariano Velarde started the group after a born-again experience in 1984</B>. Through the preaching, rallies, and radio broadcasts, 7 million

<B>Ethiopia's first evangelistic crusade in decades was held in Awasa (pop</B>.
36,000) and more than 100,000 people attended one of the five services, according to a spokesman for Reinhard Bonnke Ministries. Tom Henschke told NIRR
that people traveled by bus from as far away as 750 miles to hear the gospel and
some 100,000 prayed to accept Christ during the Feb. 7-11 crusade.
<BR><B>...Ethiopia suffered religious repression for decades under the former
Marxist government and "when you give a starving person a meal, they jump for
it," Henschke said</B>. The German evangelist's ministry coordinated efforts with
seven local churches, mostly Pentecostal and evangelical, which distributed
follow-up materials for converts. Churches will have a hard time helping all the
converts, Henschke said. A Christian workers' seminar attracted 5,000 pastors

and their needs, the preachers were allowed into restricted areas.
<BR><B>...The trio preached to groups of soldiers at bases, in camps along the
border, and in the trenches and foxholes, Thompson said</B>. At one meeting when
Thompson asked if anyone wanted to receive Christ, a major stood up and said,
"Yes, we do. Don't we men?" All 35 soldiers then stood up to pray. "Of course,
they weren't all sincere, but that major was," Thompson said. Thompson also

help them adjust to 20th century life. Saint, his wife, and four children will leave

North Korea estimates 25,000 Christians among its 22 million people.

spread the gospel to North Korea and to Koreans in China, Russia, and Mongolia. Lee told reporters he and other Cornerstone workers met with underground
North Korean church groups in recent trips. To avoid raising suspicion, the

Hispanic leaders and other critics in the SBC contended that neither the document nor recent clarifications by its signers went far enough in pointing out

The Christian Science Church won't have to pay $9 million in punitive
damages, the Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled. A jury awarded the sum two
years ago in the death of a diabetic 11-year-old boy (NIRR 4/4/94). Christian
Science teaches that healing should be sought through prayer rather than conventional medicine. Douglass Lundman said his son Ian could have been saved with
insulin. He accused the church, a Christian Science nurse, a practitioner, and
Ian's mother and stepfather of negligence. The court said the Constitution forbids
imposing punitive damages on a church because of what it teaches. However, the
court retained compensatory damages of $1.5 million.

<B>Schools must teach ethics along with academics, beginning at the elementary level, the Princeton, N.J.-based Carnegie Foundation said</B>. In a landmark
study of schools released this month, Carnegie President Ernest Boyer said
schools often are hesitant to do so because of ideological controversies and fear
of violating church-state policies. But the result is students confused about what
behavior and conduct is expected, he said. "And sadly, the vacuum is being filled
with negative signals." Although public schools can't teach religion, they can
teach about religion's influence throughout history, Boyer said. He pointed to a
coalition of 275 schools in St. Louis that worked with parents to develop teachable ethics, including honesty, responsibility, cooperation, and commitment. A

<B>A district in the Indian state of Orissa erupted into violence after the

Radical Hindus vented their anger in retaliation for the removal from office of
the Hindu mayor of Badapada, who supported their causes. K. Anand Paul of
Gospel to the Unreached Millions, a Houston-based outreach to Indians, told
NIRR that the mayor had canceled a March 28 Christian crusade planned for
Badapada and arrested its leaders. He feared the spread of Christian fervor after
another crusade, in neighboring Andhra Pradesh, drew more than 400,000 people.
At that crusade, 52,461 agreed to be baptized and join the church, and many
were miraculously healed of blindness and deafness, Paul and American layman
Doug Dodson said.
<BR><B>...The Hindu mayor reluctantly agreed to allow a ministers' seminar to
take place in a nearby Baptist church</B>. But when reports of healings in the
seminar spread, and thousands of citizens gathered outside the church, police
arrested the pastors and began beating the crowd with sticks, wounding 100
people, Dodson said. At least seven police were wounded. Police arrested nine
American and 35 Indian Christians, Dave Yanez of GUM said.
<BR><B>...During their six-day imprisonment, the Christians witnessed to their
guards, 10 of whom accepted Christ</B>. One guard prayed with "one hand holding
mine and the other holding a bayonet," Dodson said. Under pressure from Paul
and the U.S. Embassy, Orissa Chief Minister J.B. Patnaik, a Hindu, ordered the
Christians released and paid their $30,000 bail with government funds. After the
Americans left the country, the mayor reinstated the arrest warrants for the
former prisoners. Patnaik then had the mayor transferred, resulting in the Hindu
demonstrations.

people who refused to sell their property to casinos were destroyed in arsonrelated fires. More people went on welfare and shelters were jammed.

Tony Campolo apologized to Jerry
Falwell and fired his public-relations consultant David Virtue, according to Christianity Today. The Eastern College sociology professor took action after Virtue
made "demeaning" comments about
Falwell in the midst of a disagreement
over Falwell's sales of videotapes that
raise allegations about President
Clinton (NIRR 02/6/95). In a letter to
Falwell, Campolo said he was appalled at
Virtue's reference to Falwell as "some
podunk preacher from Virginia." Virtue
also apologized. Falwell accepted Campolo's apology and said that despite their
philosophical differences, he has high
regard for Campolo.

Nearly 14 million American adults -more than 7% of the population -- have a
problem with alcohol, federal researchers
said. In its study of latest figures (1992),
the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse
and Alcoholism classified well over half
that number as alcohol dependent, the
others as abusers. Young white males
are more likely to have an alcohol problem than others, the study found.

The founder and four members of Jesus-Amen Ministries were charged with
murder in Oakland, Calif. Authorities said
they beat a Korean woman to death during a six-hour exorcism that was taperecorded. The victim arrived from Korea
several months ago showing signs of
mental illness, authorities said. Fearing
she was demon-possessed, relatives referred her to the group, they added.

A man tossed a bloody butcher knife
on a table near the altar during a revival
meeting. He told the stunned congregation at Beulahland Baptist Church in
Cordele, Ga., he had just killed his girlfriend. "I'm sorry. I done wrong. And I
want you to call the law," deacon Bonnie
Shorter quoted Norman Lewis, 30, as
saying. Police charged Lewis, whose
relatives attend the church, with murder.

Planned Parenthood of Seattle started
support groups for women who have had
abortions. Participants meet two hours a
week for six weeks to discuss thoughts,
feelings, and "life-changes since their
abortion experience," the group said.
Over the last five years, Jackson,
Tenn., businessman Henry Harrison has
given 25 convicted felons a second
chance. He hired the felons at his business, Concrete Products. Harrison, a
United Methodist layman and Sunday
school teacher, wanted to practice what
he teaches in business. Some parolees
steal company equipment, but there have
been "marvelous successes," according
to The United Methodist Reporter.
<P>
Passover and Easter will be celebrated
this year on the same weekend, April 15
and 16. That is "an opportunity too good
to be missed," said Yechiel Eckstein, a
rabbi and president of the Chicago-based
International Fellowship of Christians and
Jews. Eckstein called for a weekend of
Christian-Jewish fellowship including sermons, teachings in religious schools, and
participation in seders.

American Leprosy Missions received
$95,000 from the United Methodist Committee on Relief for leprosy programs in
India, Zaire, Burma, and other countries.
The money will provide drug therapy,
sparing thousands of patients from the
devastating effects of leprosy, according
to Christopher Doyle, president of the
Greenville, S.C.-based ALM.

The Clinton administration said it will
join in an appeal of a federal judge's
ruling that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is unconstitutional (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/032095.html">NIRR 3/20</A>).
Judge Lucius Bunton said in a Texas
case that RFRA usurps powers that traditionally are granted to courts. It was the
first such ruling against RFRA since its
passage in 1993. A White House spokesman said the Justice Department is supporting the law in four pending federal
court cases. RFRA requires that government have a "compelling interest" to interfere with religious practices. Analysts
say the Supreme Court eventually will
rule on the law.

Kenya: Gun-toting bandits overpowered
guards at Africa Nazarene University in
Nairobi. They cut electricity to the campus, stole all the electrical switchboxes,
and took items from the women's dorm, a
spokesman said. None of the 55 students and staff on campus was injured,
he added. It was the fourth such incident
within eight months, he said.
<P>
Sierra Leone: Rebels freed seven Catholic nuns. The six Italians and a Brazilian
were workers in a polio hospital in
Kambia. They disappeared after a raid on
the town Jan. 25. The women said they
were treated "fairly," but were fed only
once a day and had to wear the same
clothes for two months. One of the nuns
told Vatican Radio that their lives had
been threatened often. But, she added,
some of their rebel captors befriended
and prayed with them.

Cambodia: Baptist churches have grown
from zero to 43, with more than 1,400
believers in less than three years, Southern Baptist officials said. A national association was formed last month at a
meeting in Phnom Penh. Christians account for fewer than 15,000 of the Buddhist nation's 9.5 million population.
<P>
China: Authorities announced a new
crackdown on Buddhist temples and
monks in Tibet. New regulations limit the
number of monks in each temple, forbid
the building of new temples without government approval, prohibit aggressive
proselytism, and outlaw altars in homes
and the display of pictures of the exiled
Dalai Lama. There were 1,643 temples in
Tibet in 1993, along with 40,670 monks
and nuns -- 1.77% of the entire population, The Tibet Daily noted.
<P>
China: Five people, including two Chinese evangelists and two Hong Kongbased missionaries, were beaten and
arrested when police broke up a house
church meeting in Bei Xing. Also arrested
was the homeowner's wife, Chen Qun Yi.
During a Saturday service, police burst
into the house claiming the meeting was
illegal, according to the International
Christian Association in Australia. When
police began to beat the evangelists, the
two missionaries snapped pictures and
loudly protested. Police took them into
custody. After several hours, police destroyed the film and released all four
men, but continued to hold Chen Qun Yi.
<P>
Iraq: The Vatican said it is time to end
U.N. trade sanctions against Iraq. "Innocent citizens" are being hurt by the embargo, it said. The statement came during a meeting between Pope John Paul II
and Iraq's deputy prime minister.
<P>
Japan: The Toronto Blessing is making
its way through Japan, a publication of
the Toronto Airport Vineyard said. Spread
the Fire reported that 200 Japanese pastors visited Toronto in 1994 and "carried
the blessing back with them" to their
congregations. Some 700 other people
attended three conferences sponsored by
Japan Renewal, an evangelistic group.
According to Tsugumichi Ohkawa, president of Calvary Bible Seminary in
Yamato, renewal is moving through Japan -- especially in small, country churches -- resulting in a new desire to hear
preaching and openness to teachings
about healing.

Palestine: In the Israeli-occupied town of
Ramallah, Anglicans, Lutherans, Roman
Catholics, and Greek Catholics will celebrate Easter on April 23, the day Orthodox believers celebrate the resurrection.
The Gregorian calendar, which Protestants and Catholics follow, puts Easter on
April 16. Eastern Orthodox churches
follow the Julian calendar.
<P>
Philippines: Islamic extremists planned
to kill Pope John Paul during a visit to
the Philippines in February, former Muslim rebel leader Edwin Angeles told a
Manila news conference. The plan was to
use a suicide bomber who believed he
would enter paradise by blowing up the
pope. However, "there was no opportunity." Police said that Angeles was an officer of the Abu Sayyaf fundamentalist
group (NIRR 8/22/94), which was operating on the country's southern islands.
<P>
Philippines: Christian missionaries meet
with some 1,000 public high school students every week to discuss values from
a biblical perspective, CBInternational reported. Discussions take place during
values-education classes in San Fernando, La Union. Because they are free
to say what they want, the missionaries
explain that "a relationship with Jesus
Christ" is necessary for honesty, discipline, and true friendship.

England: One of the first women that the
Church of England ordained, Ros Hunt of
Cambridge, revealed publicly that she is
a lesbian. The Sunday Times reported
that the disclosure heated up a national
controversy over homosexuality and the

the homosexuality of several bishops,
vowing to continue doing so until the
church changes its positions against homosexual practice and ordination.
<P>
Ireland: Seventy-three percent of the
citizens of the Republic of Ireland and
Northern Ireland are church members,
down from 77% in 1980, according to the
Mission Advanced Research Communications Center. In the Republic of Ireland, membership dropped in all
churches except independents, which
grew by 38%. Declines occurred among
Catholics (-5%), Anglicans (-3%), and
Presbyterians (-10%). In Northern Ireland, membership grew among the Baptists (+18%), Catholics (+3%), and Pentecostals (+83%). Independent and Methodist churches declined by 6% and 18%,
respectively. 
<P>
Norway: Olav Hope, 15, is the first Norwegian student to win the right to drop a
compulsory Christian education class. All
Norwegians are considered members of
the state-supported Lutheran Church at
birth. Public schools include mandatory
classes on Christianity for church members. Hope asked to withdraw from the
church and enroll in a general class on
human values offered to non-church
members. Authorities refused, saying he
was too young to make the request. A
court ruled he was old enough because
the age of adulthood in the church is 15.

Poland: Franciszek Gajowniczek, Auschwitz survivor, died at age 93.
Gajowniczec was one of 10 men set for
execution when Maximilian Kolbe, a
Franciscan priest, offered to die in his
place because Gajowniczek had a family.
Pope John Paul II canonized Kolbe in
1982 for his "martyrdom of charity."
<P>
Sweden: Pastors in the state-financed
Lutheran Church asked their flocks to
resist government plans to send Bosnian
Croats back to their homeland. Some
clerics also called on members to hide
refugees while opponents of expulsion try
to win a change in policy. Up to 5,000
people who fled war and ethnic cleansing
could be affected. The first three families
were deported last month. Immigration
officials said that since the Croatian government has welcomed the Bosnian
Croats back, they no longer can be considered refugees.
<P>
Vatican: Jesuit leaders backed off from
quarrels with church hierarchy and charted a new course. They said their activistminded order will focus on justice issues
for women and on recruitment of lay people to help Jesuit social and education
programs around the world. Delegates

the 23,000-member order's tradition of
independence and liberalism.

<P>
A wave of spiritual revival continues to spread across college campuses
and churches in several states (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/032095.html">NIRR 3/20</A>). Students from Howard Payne
University in Brownwood, Texas, spent spring break telling "the story of what
God is doing," as one student said.
<BR>...Almost identical experiences happened within a few weeks at The
Criswell College in Dallas; Houston Baptist University in Houston; Moorehead
State University in Moorehead, Ky.; Murray State University in Murray, Ky.;
Wheaton College in Wheaton, Ill.; and Olivet Nazarene University in Kankakee,
Ill. At all the schools, students are coming forward during lengthy services to
repent of pride, lust, bondage to materialism, bitterness, and racism. Many relationships have been mended, school leaders say.
<BR>...At Wheaton College, a March 19 service at Pierce Chapel lasted from
7:30 p.m. to 6 a.m. as students formed lines at the microphone to confess sins.
After each person spoke, friends gathered to embrace the person and pray for
him or her, said Timothy Beougher, an assistant professor. Students filled five
garbage bags with bottles of alcohol, pornography, and secular music. Days later,
lengthy services continued, involving half the school's 2,200 students. At The
Criswell College, 150 students prayed and repented for four hours after hearing
the testimony of Howard Payne students. Similar events occurred at Houston
Baptist University and Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, La.
<BR>...Other campuses reported similar activities after showing a video about
the 1970 Asbury College revival. At Olivet Nazarene, Chaplain Bill Bray played
an eight-minute video clip at a Feb. 23 chapel service. As Bray concluded,
students and faculty began seven hours of sharing, praying, singing, and exhorting each other to live holy lives. At one point, 25 members of the football team
came to the podium en masse to confess and pray for each other. As the service
continued, word spread off campus and members of the community also came to
experience the move of God, Bray said. At Moorehead State and Murray State,
many students responded to showings of the Asbury video with prayer, singing,
and confession of sins. (Copies of the video When God Comes are available from
the Francis Asbury Society at (606) 858-4222.)
<BR>...Congregations that hear of the events also are experiencing waves of
repentance and prayer. Doug Munton, pastor of First Baptist Church in Corinth,
Texas, said his church experienced revival for weeks after a visit from Howard
Payne students. When John Avant, pastor of Coggin Avenue Baptist Church in
Brownwood, Texas, described these events to an evangelism conference for the
Illinois Baptist State Convention, more than 500 people stayed for four hours to
pray and repent. In the next week "at least a half dozen" accounts of similar
events were reported by those who went out from the conference.
<BR>...Expectation of revival has been growing on other college campuses.
"Everywhere I go, more students have been involved in small groups," said Gary
Stratton, dean of the chapel at Gordon College in Wenham, Mass. "There is an
anointing for prayer on this generation." Gordon canceled classes for an April 11
day of prayer. Roy Fish, a professor at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, offered a "guiding principle" for confession. "The
circle of one's sin, as a rule, should be the circle of one's confession," he said.
When confessing sexual immorality, "extreme discretion should be used."

Churches of various denominations are experiencing revival in Melbourne, Fla. Since Jan. 1, an estimated 50,000 people from a number of different
churches attended services held six days a week at The Tabernacle, a Vineyard
church. Pastors and musicians from 15 area congregations -- including Presbyterian Church of America, Southern Baptist, Episcopal, Methodist, Assemblies of
God, and independent charismatic churches -- take turns hosting the services.
Miraculous physical healings and phenomena such as "holy laughter" have
characterized the services, pastors said. Some 600 people have become believers
or rededicated their lives to Christ since the meetings began.
<BR>...Revival began when Randy Clark, a Vineyard pastor from St. Louis,
spoke at the church. On Jan. 6, Melbourne pastor Fred Grewe drove with Clark
to Vero Beach, Fla., an hour south of Melbourne, to speak on Christian radio
station WSCF. During their interview, the disc jockey "went down under the
power of the Holy Spirit," fell on the floor, and was unable to continue the
interview, Grewe said. The same thing happened to the general manager, so
music was aired because "there was nobody to operate the station."
<BR>...Love, respect, and a lack of competition among pastors -- nurtured
through regular prayer together -- have been hallmarks of the revival, Grewe
said. "No single church is going to take this community for Christ. We've got to
do it together. Everybody wants everybody else to do well."                                        
<P>
True Love Waits, a celibacy movement launched by the Southern Baptist
church, has come to Mexico City. About 40 single people at upscale Anastasis
Baptist Church took a course and signed pledges to wait until marriage before
becoming sexually active. They are taking the message to 1,200 other churches
in the National Baptist Convention of Mexico. They hope to get 2,000 other
youths to sign commitment cards by July, missionaries Larry and Susan Gay told
Baptist Press. The campaign is an outgrowth of spiritual renewal at Anastasis
affecting young and old alike, they added.

An "old-fashioned-style revival meeting" rocked a Catholic Church in the
District of Columbia. Parishioners at St. Augustine -- the oldest African-American Catholic church in the city -- danced in the pews, shouted amen, and sang
praises to God, the National Catholic Reporter said. Catholics need to be more
passionate about worship, said evangelist Chester Smith, a Catholic priest.

Christian ministries can find open doors to China by helping the country's
57 million handicapped citizens. According to Brent Fulton, U.S. director of
China Ministries International, about two dozen ministries outside China are
providing resources for the elderly, mentally retarded, and orphans. The indigenous church long has cared for the handicapped, who often are regarded as nonpersons. Fulton said the church also cares for the elderly, takes in abandoned and
orphaned children, and provides rehabilitative services for the deaf and mute.
<BR>...Recently, short-term missions teams from the United States went to
China to communicate God's love to the handicapped. Although proselytizing is
illegal in China, "there are no prohibitions against personal relationships," Fulton
told NIRR. He said ministries for the handicapped are "well received by officials" because Deng Pufong, son of Premier Deng Xiaoping, is a paralytic who
works in the government for the handicapped. Bureaucrats pursue benevolent
policies toward the handicapped to gain political favor, Fulton said.

Miami Mayor Stephen Clark presented Luis Palau with a key to the city
during his multicultural crusade there March 4-12 (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/032095.html">NIRR 3/20</A>). Clark said the
Argentine-born evangelist's message of racial and spiritual reconciliation is badly
needed in Miami. Palau, an American citizen, considers himself a bridge between
the Anglo and Hispanic cultures. 
<BR>...More than 78,000 people attended the crusade during three days of
English events and five days of Spanish events, the Luis Palau Evangelistic
Association said. Some 3,200 people made commitments to Christ. Among those
converted was a professed witch who said she recently tried to commit suicide.
The crusade coincided with Carnival Week, an annual celebration by the Cuban
community. At the street festival, which drew more than a million people, Palau
preached from a stage and prayed with several people who were converted.

The CoMission is only "negligibly affected" by the Russian Education
Ministry's cancellation of its agreement allowing the group's Christian Morality

King Crow. "The only issue is whether we do it on school property or not."
Crow said at least two-thirds of the CoMission's workers still are instructing
teachers on campus, and the rest instruct them off campus. Local officials are
encouraging the CoMission to continue its activities, he said.
<BR>...The Russian Orthodox Church "leaned on" a vice premier to influence
the Ministry of Education to abrogate the agreement, the CoMission's Mark
Bullock told NIRR. The CoMission has done all it could to befriend Orthodox
priests, he said. In many cities the priests support the CoMission.

The divided, fledgling Christian community in Mongolia formed The Evangelical Alliance of Mongolia. People from 14 churches signed the alliance's
doctrinal statement at a meeting in Ulan Bator last month. More than 300
believers at the meeting explored ways of working together in evangelistic
outreach. The first churches in the once-isolated country emerged in 1990 with a
handful of believers. Since then, an influx of Western missions groups and others
caused division, but the meeting was a big step toward unity, said John Gibbens
of the Bible Society of Mongolia.

Christianity is communicated by "people messages" not "word messages,"
Charles Kraft told a gathering of 200 missionaries, missions executives, professors and students. The Fuller Theological Seminary missions professor was a
keynote speaker at the Unreached Peoples Conference March 13-15 in Norfolk,
Va. The event is presented annually by the Regent University Divinity School
and the Association of International Mission Services to help missions agencies
discuss new strategies.
<BR>...Jesus' incarnation was "an incredible strategy by God," Kraft said,
because Jesus communicated His message by who He was. He "earned respect,
not demanded it," Kraft said. Christians need to do likewise, earning their way
into people's private worlds, he said. 
<BR>...The event consisted of addresses by missions experts and groupstrategy sessions covering Muslims, tribal groups, Hindus, Buddhists, Chinese,
and a track for missions executives. Other keynote speakers included Sid Roth of
Messianic Vision, a broadcast ministry to Jews, and Abu Wasiim, founder and
director of Middle East Media, a publishing and broadcast ministry.

The television cameras are gone from Rwanda, "but the need is still
tremendous," U.S. Ambassador to Rwanda David Rawson told members of the
National Association of Evangelicals in March. Rawson, the son of missionaries
to Burundi, was invited to the group's convention by World Relief. The humanitarian arm of the NAE is one of the organizations still at work in the refugee
camps. World Relief President Art Gay told NIRR he visited a refugee camp on
the Rwanda-Zaire border, where 425,000 people live in makeshift shelters on a
bed of lava rock. Gay preached to several congregations in a church built
of wooden sticks and plastic sheeting. 
<BR>...World Relief will shift from disaster response to development so people
can "get on with their lives," Gay said. The group received a $230,000 grant
from the U.S. Agency for International Development to rebuild a hospital in
Kigabura and set up clinics in surrounding areas. Rwanda is politically unstable
and the church has been compromised, yet the group is committed to moving its
headquarters to Kigali and setting up long-term assistance programs. "My hunch
is God wants us there for the next ten years," Gay said.

Leaders of religious and other groups complained that a United Nationssponsored conference on world poverty last month made no progress toward
ending global impoverishment. Officials from some 170 countries attended the
World Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen, Denmark. They took
positions favoring reliance on free-market economies as a chief means of ending
poverty. General Secretary Konrad Raiser challenged that approach, saying open
markets and economic growth cannot be advanced as a panacea for social ills.
<BR>...Some 600 voluntary organizations held an unofficial summit nearby and
issued an Alternative Declaration. Their statement rejects emphasis on economic
growth as a cure-all. Social policy in developing countries has been reduced to a
"safety net" for the poor, it said. Signers included World Vision International and
agencies of the United Methodist Church, the United Church of Christ, and the
Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).

The National Council of Churches announced it has recovered $5 million
of the $8 million it lost last year in a fraudulent international investment scheme
(NIRR 4/4/94). General Secretary Joan Brown Campbell told a New York news
conference the NCC will keep pursuing the other $3 million through court action
in Boston. New York attorney Richard Lawler is heading the recovery effort. He
said he expects to gain full recovery "plus damages" through the Boston suits.
He declined to identify those targeted for legal action.
<BR>...The $5 million came from assets frozen by a British court. The assets
belonged to two banks named in the scheme, including bankrupt Banka Bohemia
in the Czech Republic. Officials of the Czech bank were involved, including one
who is now a fugitive, Lawler told reporters.

The national ministries board of the American Baptist Churches severed
ties with the Baptist Peace Fellowship of North America over the BPFNA's
position on homosexuals. At a February meeting in Fort Worth, Texas, the
BPFNA's board adopted a resolution welcoming "gay, lesbian, bisexual, and
transgendered persons," and pledging support for their goals. ABC officials said
they cut off funding and staff support because the BPFNA action was partisan
and inconsistent with ABC policies. Seven Baptist denominations have affiliated
with the BPFNA since its founding in 1984.

In most Southern Baptist churches, 12% of the members give 80% of the
money, and 50% give nothing at all, according to a new book, Partners With
God: Bible Truths About Giving. Also, 80 cents of every dollar appears to come
from people over 55, co-author Bob Eklund says. Eklund directs stewardship for
Texas Southern Baptists.

Many taxpayers are having trouble getting required receipts from
churches and charities for contributions of $250 or more, so the IRS has eased
its new rule. The rule requires a receipt that includes the amount of the donation,
along with the value of any goods or services received in exchange for the
donation. For 1994 returns only, the IRS now says a good-faith effort to get the
receipt by Oct. 16 will do. One such effort would be writing a letter to the
charity asking for the documentation, the agency said.

A U.S. judge in Milwaukee struck down the Freedom of Access to Clinic
Entrances Act. Judge Rudolph Randa ruled that the part of the 1994 federal law
that bans "non-violent, physical obstruction" of clinics is unconstitutional. His
decision came in a case involving six defendants who attached themselves to cars
in front of an abortion clinic last September. They faced up to six months in
prison and $10,000 in fines, but Randa dismissed the charges against them. The
ruling sets up a possible Supreme Court review of FACE.
<BR>...Seven other federal judges and a U.S. appeals court in Richmond, Va.,
have upheld FACE as constitutional. This limits the importance of Randa's
ruling, analysts said. The U.S. Attorney's office in Milwaukee said it will
continue to enforce the law aggressively. Planned Parenthood said it plans to
appeal Randa's decision.

Chicago's public schools can close on Good Friday, a federal judge said.
U.S. District Judge Ann Williams ruled last summer that the schools could not
do so because it was a religious holiday. But last month the school system said a
survey showed that 90% of its teachers would not work on Good Friday. It asked
the court for permission to close schools that day. Williams provided a loophole:
officials have the power to close schools for non-religious reasons on any day,
she said. The officials reclassified Good Friday as an emergency closing day that
will not have to be made up at the end of the school year.

Operators of a Monsey, N.Y., commuter bus catering to Orthodox Jews
agreed to remove a curtain separating passengers by gender. The curtain had
been hung in the aisle so men would not be in sight of women passengers during
prayer. A Jewish woman, Sima Rabinovicz, complained when a group of men on
a December 1993 trip asked her to move so they could expand their area to the
women's side of the bus. She refused, the men got out to pray on the street, and
the bus driver reprimanded her, she said. In negotiations with the bus company,
her lawyers argued that the government-subsidized bus is a public conveyance,
not a synagogue. Under the settlement, passengers may fashion their own
personal prayer curtains as long as they don't interfere with other passengers or
pose a safety problem.

Legislation to let low-income parents receive federal funds to send their

a pilot project in some 20 school districts. A spokesman for the National Association of Evangelicals applauded the bill. But Barry Lynn of Americans United
for Separation of Church and State said it would force people to pay a "religion
tax." A similar bill was defeated in the last Congress.

It's being called a truce in the bitter "culture war" over the role of religion
in public schools. U.S. Education Secretary Richard Riley and leaders of 17
religious, civil liberties, and education groups agreed to improve communication,
respect each other's positions, and work to avoid lawsuits. The groups ranged
from the Christian Coalition and National Association of Evangelicals to People
for the American Way, the National Council of Churches, and the National
Education Association.
<BR>...The NAE's Forest Montgomery described the agreement as "not easy,"
but "a first step." Several prominent groups, including the American Civil
Liberties Union and Focus on the Family, declined to join the pact, according to
scholar Charles Haynes of The Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at
Vanderbilt University, which helped to bring the parties together.
<BR>...Among the six principles in a statement the leaders signed: "Public
schools should not promote or inhibit religion, but can teach about religion when
appropriate. They should treat religious conviction with respect." Another one
says "parents have primary responsibility for their children's education, and
schools and parents should work together" regarding issues of religion.

Lois Mitten can continue using the Bible in her five child-care centers in
Toledo and still qualify for a federal loan. Mitten sued the U.S. Small Business
Administration in 1992 after it rejected her application for a $1 million loan.
Officials cited a weekly 20-minute lesson in which children read Bible stories
and sing religious songs. They said a government rule forbids use of federal
funds to influence or impact religious opinions. Mitten said the voluntary lessons
do not endorse any particular faith. They are designed to teach children that they
are special to God, she said. Prodded by the American Center for Law and
Justice, which represented Mitten, the SBA settled the suit in her favor. A Justice
Department spokesman said the rule may be repealed.

Columbia Elementary School near Orlando violated a 10-year-old's constitutional rights by confiscating his Bible, a lawsuit filed in federal court alleges.
Several times, a teacher seized fourth-grader Joshua Burton's Bible, it says.
Another time, it adds, he was sent to the principal's office for having his Bible
on top of his desk with other school books. "He has the right to read his Bible to
himself during non-classtime, and to read it with someone else during nonclasstime," lawyer Mat Staver of the Liberty Council insisted.

When Japanese police implicated the Aum Shinrikyo Buddhist sect in the
Tokyo subway nerve gas attacks, it was no surprise to Johannes Aagaard. He
heads Dialogue Center International, a research center at Aarhus University in
Denmark that tracks various sects around the world. Aagaard had been warning
in writings and interviews that "this cult could explode." Its mission, based on a
philosophy of nihilism, is "the destruction of everything," he said. Unlike many
new cults attracting Japanese young people, Aum Shinrikyo is committed to "the
nothingness of everything" by the year 2000 or so, Aagaard said on CNN.
<BR>...To sect founder Shoko Asahara, 40, who is in poor health, there is honor
in being the one to carry out "this holocaust," Aagaard said. Asahara has been
dropping clues for several years in talks and writings about the group's mission,
news accounts said. He talked about death by sarin nerve gas a year ago. Lately
he has emphasized the Hindu god of destruction and creation, Lord Shiva.
Shiva's job is to destroy so that everything can be renewed. "Maybe he thinks of
himself as a living Shiva," Shinichi Nakazawa, a professor religious studies, told
The New York Times.

Bob Jones University said it is spending millions of dollars on a plan to

beginning this fall. The classes will be taught live, and the technology will allow
two-way communications between students and instructors, BJU officials said.
Courses will include advanced math, algebra, chemistry, physics, biology, and
Spanish. A 10-month subscription costs $9,900 and includes equipment and
maintenance. Schools would have to pay that much "just for one chemistry

Contemporary Christian dancing and Christian dance clubs are popping
up, Religion News Service said. Dance music can be found in some Christian
bookstores and heard on some Christian radio stations. Organizers use late-night
Christian "rave" dances for low-key outreach. Christian lyrics make "sanctified
dance music" different from secular songs, Christian broadcaster Ken Farley said.
<BR>...Suggestive clothing worn by outsiders at outreach dances prompt criticism
from church members, RNS said. At Club J in San Jose, Calif., run by Jubilee
Christian Center, bouncers wearing striped referee shirts monitor the dance floor.
"If dancers get too bump-and-grindish, then the bouncers blow a whistle or throw
a flag for a violation," singles pastor Adam Bernal said.
<BR>...Contemporary dancing "is very problematic at best for the Christian
because of the fleshly motive and pleasure that so often accompany it," a
spokesman for the Los Angeles-based ministry of conservative pastor-broadcaster
John MacArthur said. Scott Blackwell, 35, who owns N Soul Records in Los

Allstate Corp. acknowledged it hired a consultant who taught "unacceptable" Church of Scientology management principles to the insurance company's
agents and supervisors from 1988 to 1992. The company denied allegations that
some employees were hounded, intimidated, and wrongfully fired as a result of
the training program. More than 3,500 Allstate workers participated in seminars
that taught them to disregard ethics in the quest for greater productivity, The
Wall Street Journal reported. That part of the training "was wholly unacceptable
and inconsistent with our standards," company spokesman Al Orendorff said. He
defended other aspects of the training by Don Pearson of International Executive
Technology, a Scientology-affiliated firm promoting church founder L. Ron
Hubbard's management principles. These include rewarding without question the
most productive workers and unfailingly penalizing the least productive, the
Journal reported, citing training materials.

Rumblings in evangelical ranks may spell bad news for the Republican
Party in 1995. Leaders of the Christian right warned they may support a thirdparty effort if the GOP fails to act on moral and values-related social issues.
"Republicans Take a Walk on Moral Issues" lamented a headline on a newsletter
that Focus on the Family mailed to 2 million people. Leaders of 15 pro-life
groups met with House GOP leaders last month to press for action on abortion.
Other leaders warn that evangelicals have been too entangled in partisan politics. 
<BR>...Other evangelical leaders express worry that the GOP is pushing economic and social positions that will widen the breach between whites and

Many teen-agers don't understand why they shouldn't steal, Ohio State
University researchers found. Their study measured moral development among
adolescents, psychology professor John Gibbs said. More than 90% of the 323
teens studied, about half of whom were incarcerated delinquents, said stealing is
wrong, Gibbs said. But the most common reason for not stealing was that they
might get caught and punished. Other reasons included "the other person might
get even" and "you might not need the item," he said.
<BR>...A more mature perspective would be that stealing is wrong because it
hurts other people and society as a whole by damaging the sense of communal
trust, Gibbs suggested.

Donn Moomaw, Ronald Reagan's pastor for decades, resigned as pastor
of Bel Air Presbyterian Church in suburban Los Angeles in 1993 because of
"sexual contact" with five women, church officials said. At the time of his abrupt
departure, Moomaw said only that he had "stepped over the line of acceptable
behavior" and pleaded no contest to accusations brought before presbytery
officials. Presbytery official Charles Doak read the ruling against the former
pastor to about 1,000 church members. Moomaw was not present at the meeting.
<BR>...Doak said that Moomaw, 63, resigned after fellow ministers accused him
of breaking the church's informal agreement to stop counseling women. The
sexual activities took place from 1983 to 1992, Doak added. The presbytery has
barred Moomaw from performing any ministerial activities, including counseling,
until 1997.                                                                                        <P><A HREF="#MENU">Back to menu</A>

Last month's reception for about 150

A spontaneous spiritual revival has begun on college campuses in the
United States. The phenomenon, which includes open confession of personal
sins, began with a Howard Payne University student in Brownwood, Texas. Manifestations spread to other schools visited by Howard Payne students, including
Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Beeson School of
Divinity in Birmingham, Ala., and Olivet Nazarene University in Kankakee, Ill.
Some observers compare the phenomenon to the revival that began at Asbury
College in Wilmore, Ky., in 1970 and swept across the United States.
<BR>...Revival broke out when Howard Payne University student Chris Robeson
testified tearfully Jan. 22 at Coggin Avenue Baptist Church in Brownwood about
his life and the spiritual condition of his classmates. "People just started streaming down the aisles" to pray, confess sins, and restore seemingly doomed
relationships, pastor John Avant told Baptist Press. Since then, the church has
continued to hold three-and-a-half-hour services. "This is not something we're
trying to manufacture," Avant told NIRR. "It's the most wonderful thing we've
ever experienced."
<BR>...At nearby Howard Payne University, revival broke out during a Jan. 26
service. Then, during Feb. 13-15 meetings led by Southern Baptist revival leader
Henry Blackaby, some 35-40 young men and a number of young women openly
confessed sins of lust. As local pastors prayed and counseled them, about 200
more people, including adults from the local community, came forward to
become believers or rededicate their lives to Christ. "Once we saw the Spirit
move, we didn't want to leave," student Andrea Cullins said. 
<BR>...Howard Payne students began testifying at numerous churches and
schools about the events. On March 1, Avant addressed a packed Truett Auditorium audience at Southwestern Baptist. Avant's description of events in
Brownwood was followed by an outpouring of seven hours of confession and
prayer by students, faculty, and administrators, he said. At Beeson, Avant and
Robeson spoke March 7 at a "remarkable" three-hour service during which
dozens of people came forward to pray, confess pride and lust, and seek personal
reconciliation, Timothy George, the school's dean, told NIRR. This is something
"we have been praying and yearning for," George said. The phenomena is "a
genuine moving of God and the beginning of authentic spiritual revival," said
Ken Hemphill, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary president.

Although thousands of people from around the world have flocked to Toronto to observe the laughing revival (NIRR 7/11/94), some visitors reject the
phenomenon. After he heard people making animal sounds and saw them rolling
on the floor laughing, Southern Baptist executive Ron Owens declared, "It's demeaning to think Christ in me will be manifested in this way." During genuine
moves of God, there "always have been distractions and counterfeits," he said.
Cult watcher Hank Hanegraaff warned his radio audience that the movement is
not biblical. Philip Roberts, another SBC leader, said the laughter and animal
sounds also are hallmarks of some New Age and Eastern religious groups.

Pastors' Prayer Summits -- weekend retreats for pastors and board members -- continue to spread. There have been 38 such summits this school year,
with 24 more set for the spring. Nearly 2,250 people have participated in the
summits so far this school year, nearly as many as in all of last year. The
conferences often result in renewal among weary and discouraged clergy and lay
leaders, participants say. One pastor described the summits as "a sweet, gentle,
and awesome experience."
<BR>..."God has definitely moved through the pastors to the body of Christ, and
the fires are spreading," according to Terry Dirks, vice president of Portlandbased International Renewal Ministries, which sponsors the meetings. Pastors
across the country do not want to attend "more events, programs, seminars, and
conferences," but to slow down and spend time in God's presence, Dirks said.

A group of Christians began a 786-mile walk. The 23 "prayerwalkers" left
San Diego March 1 for San Francisco, where they are to arrive April 9. They
plan to pray for each community along the El Camino Real, the roadway formed
when Franciscan priests established 21 mission communities. The walkers, who
are members of various denominations, will be joined for briefer periods by
prayer walkers in various communities. Longer days will be covered by breaking
into two groups that walk simultaneously along different segments of the route.
As of mid-March, flooding had not delayed the walk, although the routes may be

The National Association of Evangelicals bid farewell to Billy Melvin, 65,

president when he succeeds Melvin April 1. Goals for the NAE are racial
reconciliation, more participation by women and young people, and inclusion of
more parachurch organizations and megachurches, leaders said.
<BR>...California pastor Jack Hayford called for "more than just toleration and
graciousness" among the races, but a "total obliteration" of those things that
separate them. Duane Liftin, president of Wheaton College, reminded the NAE
audience that it must be "deeply rooted in the One whom we preach." Morris
Chapman, president of the executive committee of the Southern Baptist Convention, said revival "can not be worked up, it must be prayed down." David Bryant

A Bible study that began in an unused funeral parlor has resulted in 12
"death metal" music fans becoming Christians. The Hard Core Bible Study,
which began a year ago near the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis,
reaches youth who are obsessed with death, study leader Mark Johnson told
Youth With A Mission News. Johnson said death metal is intense and filled with
growls and snarls. Christian rock concerts also were held at the parlor, with the
owner's permission. 
<BR>...Anarchists, skinheads, and "headbangers" study Scripture as they sit on
dusty furniture next to urns and coffins. "Everyone is welcome, nobody is condemned, and the gospel is boldly proclaimed," said Johnson, a 32-year-old, longhaired licensed minister. Several of the young converts take part in weekend
street evangelism. They perform a drama in which someone jumps out of a
coffin and espouses hopelessness and nihilism. At that point, bystanders often
cheer because "that's what they believe," Johnson told NIRR. Then, Johnson
begins a dialogue with the "dead" person, conveying the hope found in Christ.

Evangelicals are making inroads in Turkey, Baptist Press reported. The 99%
Muslim country long has resisted evangelical efforts and establishment of
churches. As recently as the late 1970s, there were no known Christian believers
among the ethnic Turks, mission experts say. Groups such as Operation Mobilization and Youth With A Mission fielded itinerant teams to evangelize secretly.
<BR>...But now there are at least 400 "tent-making" Christian workers and
about the same number of baptized believers, according to a Southern Baptist
worker who requested anonymity for security reasons. The worker told Baptist
Press that as many as 2,000 people attend Bible studies or worship services in
the nation of 60.8 million. Small congregations have been established in all
Turkey's major cities. However, only two have their own buildings in which to
meet. He described the baptism of 27 believers in one service last year as
possibly the biggest baptismal service there since Paul preached at Ephesus,
located near the present-day city of Izmir.
<BR>...There have been anti-Christian media campaigns recently, and people
still are brought to trial for converting from Islam, the worker said. Although
higher courts in Turkey eventually free them, they frequently undergo lengthy
persecution, including torture, while in jail awaiting trial, he said.

More than 12,000 Hungarian Christians attended the Holy Spirit Renewal

music, and preaching with the goal of reaching every village and city in Hungary
with the gospel. The church is raising funds to build a 12,000-seat church hall in
Budapest. In addition to starting Hungarian congregations, the church has planted

The Worldwide Church of God slashed programs and staff to cope with a
one-third loss in revenue and 10% loss of membership. The 56-acre site in
Pasadena, Calif., which is headquarters for the church of 95,000 baptized
members founded by Herbert W. Armstrong, is for sale. However, a spokesman
said the church is not headed for bankruptcy. Losses stem from a wholesale
revision of doctrine in the last five years. "We have been in error on several
points," including the doctrine of the Trinity, which the denomination once
rejected, but now espouses, spokesman Tom Lapacka told NIRR.
<BR>...The denomination still is in transition, but is holding together, he said.
Members are studying Scripture and learning more about salvation through grace,
and that is making "a profound positive change." Lapacka asked for prayers
because "it is a difficult time for us." The church is known for its magazine, The
Plain Truth, and its television and radio program, The World Tomorrow.

The Alliance of Baptists called for a change in dealings with Jews. At its
annual meeting the group said most recent Baptist overtures have been "reduced
to a theology of conversion." It called for genuine dialogue based on a respect
for Judaism. It also confessed to interpreting the Bible in ways that have "created
enemies of the Jewish people." The 121-congregation alliance split from the
Southern Baptist Convention in 1986.

The Christian Reformed Church of North America lost about 22,000 members in the last three years, or 7% of membership before the current secession
movement, which began in 1993. Current membership is 294,179. Most of the
loss is attributable to members joining conservative secession movements, which
have grown rapidly, according to Reformed Believers Press Service.

The New York Supreme Court ruled that a special school district created by
members of a Hasidic Jewish sect for handicapped children is constitutional. The
fact that only the group's members have taken advantage of the law does not
make it a segregated school, it said. Kiryas Joel school district previously was
part of an Orange County district, but the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the
arrangement last June on grounds it violated the Establishment Clause (NIRR
7/11/94). New York's legislature then passed a law in which any locality that
met certain criteria could form its own school district.

The Religious Freedom Restoration Act survived the first legal test of its
constitutionality. U.S. District Judge Helen Gillmor in Honolulu rejected
Hawaii's claim that Congress overstepped its authority in passing the 1993 law.
The claim arose from a ruling that state prison officials must show, under RFRA,
a compelling reason to infringe on a prisoner's religious practice.
<BR>...Days later, a federal judge in Texas ruled RFRA unconstitutional. The
ruling came in a case pitting the Catholic archdiocese of San Antonio against the
city of Boerne, Texas. City officials had refused to allow the archdiocese to
demolish part of an old church building in order to expand. The archdiocese
sued, citing the RFRA. Boerne's lawyers argued that Congress did not have
power to enact the measure, and Judge Lucius Bunton agreed.

The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule by late June on the University
of Virginia's refusal to allow funding of a student-run religious publication from
student activity fees (NIRR 11/14/94). The case was argued before the high court
this month by University of Chicago law professor Michael McConnell on behalf
of three students. He said the school's denial amounted to discrimination based
on religious speech. Questions by the justices suggested division and indecision
about church-state separation issues, analysts noted.

Former student Craig Rogers, 33, filed a $2.5 million sexual harassment suit
against California State University-Sacramento. It accuses professor Joanne
Marrow, a lesbian, of giving a graphic lecture in Psychology 100 class that
caused him "emotional distress." She told anecdotes about masturbation, made
jokes about male genitalia, and showed slides of female genitalia, Rogers said. 
<BR>...Rogers, a member of the Nazarene church, spoke with his pastor and
others at Sacramento First Church before deciding to take action. When he got
no response from the school or the California Board of Control, which hears
complaints against the state, he filed the suit. Marrow's lawyer accused Rogers
of being on "a religious crusade." Rogers said his religion has nothing to do with
the suit. His attorney said the lecture violated regulations that ban persistent
displays of sexually explicit pictures.

three Christian and three Muslim groups during this month's world anti-poverty
summit in Copenhagen, Denmark. U.S.-based Catholic Relief Services and

Vietnam is persecuting pastors who have formed relationships with churches
overseas. Ron VanderGriend, director of Asian Ministries for The Bible League,
told NIRR he was arrested in Danang last month by police who raided his hotel
room during a meeting with 18 Vietnamese house-church leaders. He was
detained for a week before Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) won his release.
VanderGriend said he knows of at least four similar incidents in the past two
months. House-church members left the government-sanctioned Protestant
church, Tin Lahn, because of restrictions on beliefs and meeting places.
<BR>...In rural areas, church members are fined and threatened. Fines average
$10 a person -- about a month's wages -- but have run as high as $200. Tran
Dinh Ai, an Assemblies of God minister with 100 congregations, told NIRR
those who can't pay are forced to work in government camps until the fine is
paid. Ai said the government rejected applications for recognition of his church
because of Pentecostal beliefs that are considered unorthodox. 
<BR>...Ai served two years of an eight-year sentence for church activities, then
was released in 1993 without explanation. He credits the prayers of believers for
his release, but also said Vietnam wanted to deceive the outside world into
thinking there is religious freedom, "but in fact it is very tight." VanderGriend
said once Vietnam got what it was after -- normalization of relations and the
opening up of trade with the United States in 1994 -- "persecution stepped up."
<BR>...Other informed sources disagree. They say the government is trying to
provide more religious freedom, but is wary of groups with ties to Western
countries because they could destabilize Vietnam.

A Washington state law barring doctors from helping terminally ill patients
die was upheld by a federal appeals court in San Francisco. The law protects the
poor and handicapped, and keeps doctors from becoming "killers of their patients," the panel said. The ruling, the first on the assisted-suicide ban, overturned
a lower court decision that said the law was unconstitutional.

Physician-assisted suicide is not a right protected by the U.S. Constitution,

United for Life President Paige Cunningham said. AUL, a pro-life public-interest
law organization, filed a brief in the case.

Abortion must be "brought back to the front burner of the nation's conscience and agenda," according to Pierre Bynum of Sound the Trumpet Ministries in Washington, D.C. The group monitors political, legal, and moral trends,
then dispatches prayer alerts through its network of members. The actions of
radicals have caused "legitimate pro-life leaders to become timid, hopeful only
for incremental change" during the current Congress, Bynum warned. He said
conservative political victories in the United States and renewal in the church
alone will not "nullify God's curses on America, earned by defiance of His
moral laws." Christians must advocate "genuine moral reform," he said.

Three "crucial choices" made by young adults influence the strength of
families, according to research cited by White House domestic-policy advisor
William Galston. The choices: to graduate from high school, to marry before
having children, and to wait until an adult to have children. Only 8% of children
born to people who have met all three indicators live in poverty, Galston told a
Southern Baptist-sponsored conference on the family in Knoxville, Tenn. But, he
added, 79% of children born to people who haven't met any of the three criteria
live in poverty. Government policies can help strengthen families, but not
without "moral commitments" by the people, Galston said.

The songs I Wanna Hold Your Hand, Pretty Woman, and Baby, I'm Yours
have been reborn. Now there's I Wanna Raise My Hands, Holy Spirit, and Jesus,
I'm Yours. The 1950s-era music with a Christian twist is the inspiration of
California guitarist and singer Ron Perry on the album Sanctified Oldies (Castle
Music). Perry once botched an opportunity for secular success when he missed
his own Hollywood contract-signing party because he was stoned on drugs.
When he entered a Teen Challenge recovery program, Perry was so damaged by
drugs -- including LSD -- that for months he had to be led everywhere he went.
Later, while staff members prayed for him, Perry said he experienced a complete
physical and mental healing.
<BR>..."Kids call him Daddy Ron," said Ben Ferell, who promotes Perry's albums,
which are popular with young teen-agers. At Happy Days Parties, young people
dress in '50s costumes, Perry sings, gives an invitation, and "kids come to Christ
right and left," Ferell said. For information, call Ferell at 1-800-743-4601.

The Story Keepers is an animated video series designed to give children a
historical perspective on the gospel stories and how they were transmitted by the
early church. The storyline is set in Rome during a time of persecution. The
gospel stories are presented from the viewpoint of a baker, who is an eyewitness
to the teachings of Jesus.
<BR>...The videos are "historically accurate and authentically reliable in showing
how the early church kept the story alive during its time of persecution," Executive Producer Dave Anderson said. Each segment presents three to four gospel
stories set against a backdrop of Roman persecution. Co-produced by Focus on
the Family and Zondervan Publishing House, the full series will consist of
thirteen 26-minute episodes.

Kids need fathers who are strong family leaders, said David Blankenhorn,
author of Fatherless America. The book contains evidence from sociology and
anthropology detailing societal consequences of loss of belief in fatherhood. Men
in America increasingly are viewed as "expendable or part of the problem," he
told USA Today. Blankenhorn, founder of the New York think-tank Institute for
American Values, criticized acceptance of what he calls America's "divorce
culture." He said couples worry more about "doing divorce better" than staying
married. Stepfamilies are unstable, said Blankenhorn, who also criticized single
mothers for relying on "nearby guys" -- such as scout leaders and boyfriends -as male role models for kids.
<BR>...Blankenhorn also chairs the National Fatherhood Initiative. It is sponsoring the National Fatherhood Tour to 25 U.S. cities to "start a national debate on
fatherhood." One of the goals of the tour is to encourage 10,000 men to commit
themselves to become better fathers. For information or to schedule a speaker,

Prominent evangelical John MacArthur is criticizing cooperation between
Protestants and Catholics. MacArthur, pastor of Grace Community Church in Sun
Valley, Calif., has been aggressively trying to woo away Catholics from what he
calls their "false religion," according to the Los Angeles Times. He also has
criticized the 1994 Catholic-Protestant document urging a truce on proselytizing
in each other's ranks and more cooperation in fighting common societal enemies.
MacArthur is president of The Master's College in Newhall and has a nationwide
following for his books, seminars and radio broadcasts.
<BR>...Gregory Coiro, a priest speaking for the Los Angeles Catholic
Archdiocese, said MacArthur has a long record of "Catholic bashing." Coiro said
it was "kind of cheeky" for him to say he wants to "lead Catholics to Christ,
considering we kept belief in Christ alive for over 1,500 years before an evangelical Protestant ever set foot on the planet."                                                      <P><A HREF="#MENU">Back to menu</A>

some black circles. He showed up uninvited last month at a black ministers'
political strategy session sponsored by
Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition. But
Willis was escorted out as soon as he

campaign funding activities are under
federal investigation. Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr reportedly is probing the large amounts of cash
President Clinton's state and national
campaigns distributed in the black community. The funds include money given
by Willis to black ministers, ostensibly as
part of get-out-the-vote efforts.

A recent Time story on Pat Robertson
and his Operation Blessing ministry was
"badly distorted" and a "cheap shot," said
Robert Fanning, OB's chief operating
officer. The Feb. 27 article criticized Robertson for befriending Mobutu Sese
Seko, dictator of Zaire for 30 years. A
Robertson organization working in Zaire,
the African Development Company,
formed to look into mining, lumber, agriculture, and transportation investments,
could not engage in these activities without help from Mobutu, William Harrop, a

<P>
More than 25,000 people became Christians in six weeks as the result of a
play staged in Modesto, Calif. The evangelistic Heaven's Gates and Hell's
Flames was performed 28 times at Calvary Temple Worship Center, filling the
3,000-capacity Assemblies of God church each night, several pastors told NIRR.
In addition to the 25,000, an estimated 8,000 people who did not submit decision
cards because of the crush of the crowd also became believers, ushers said.
<BR>...The play is produced by Toronto-based Reality Outreach Ministries,
Inc., which trains local church members to perform the vignettes. Depending on
their characters' decisions about Christ, actors either climb stairs to heaven or are
dragged away to hell. "It's not scare tactics, but reality tactics. Hell is a scary
place," Calvary Temple pastor Glen Berteau told NIRR. "But it's still God. God
has chosen to rest on this city." Among those stirred to become believers as a
result of the play were several generations of families, including 23 members of
one extended family. Productions in the United States and Canada by Reality's
16 teams reportedly resulted in tens of thousands of conversions in 1994.
<BR>...Revival continued when the play was not being staged. While Berteau
read announcements before a Sunday service, a man approached the podium,
stood with his arms folded, and asked to be saved. As the man waved for the
congregation to join him, 45 people came forward. When people become believers during the announcements, "there's got to be an anointing," Berteau said.
<BR>...Prayer and fasting by pastors in the area preceeded what some are calling
the Miracle in Modesto. Pastors from various denominations meet at noon on
Wednesdays for the past year "to draw closer to God and each other," said David
Seifert, chairman of the Modesto Ministerium Association and pastor of Big
Valley Grace Community Church. The meetings are an outgrowth of two
Pastor's Prayer Summits conducted by International Renewal Ministries of
Portland, Ore. (NIRR 5/30/94). More than 60 pastors gathered for four-day
prayer summits. As a result, other churches in the area are "rejoicing in
Calvary's successes" without envy or rivalry, said Phil Arendt, missions pastor at
Modesto's First Baptist Church.
<BR>...Berteau reluctantly agreed to halt performances late in February in
order to allow time for churches in the area to assimilate the new believers. Most
have been referred for discipleship and fellowship to churches of various denominations around the area.

Hundreds of Siberian teens turned to Christ during a January crusade to the
Yakutia Region of Russia, San Antonio-based evangelist Sammy Tippit said. The
greatest response occurred in the town of Chulman (pop. 30,000), where about
500 people, including 350 young people, were converted during two days of
preaching in the schools and a local theater. Similar crusades in the neighboring
cities of Yakutsk and Neriungi saw 500 people accept Christ. Intense follow-up
activities are built into the crusades, and the new converts are matched with local
churches, provided with Bibles, and invited to attend Bible study and discipleship
courses, Tippit told NIRR. Siberia always has been a fruitful region for his
ministry "because of the religious vacuum -- something has to rise up there,"
Tippit said. 
<BR>...Tippit was asked to preach at the prison where Georgy Vins, the imprisoned Russian pastor who became the subject of international attention in the
1970s, was held for a year and a half before his release. "It was a sobering
experience," Tippit said, "because I realized that much of the peoples' openness
is due to our martyrs" and the prayers of the persecuted for their persecutors.

More than 65,000 people in Costa Rica turned out Feb. 8-11 for a crusade

There is a deep spiritual hunger among people in Haiti, who are suffering
from an "identity crisis" in the wake of voodoo's failure to defeat the U.S.
invasion last fall, Youth With A Mission's Haiti Director Terry Snow told NIRR.
Before U.S. forces entered the country, voodoo priests, called hogans, conducted
animal sacrifices in military barracks and performed ceremonies to thwart the
invasion. The successful campaign discredited the religion, Snow said. "When
they lost voodoo, they lost their identity. But we are showing them they can have
a new identity in Christ." 
<BR>...After last month's annual Haiti for Jesus conference (NIRR 1/23/95),
more than 350 Haitians have made decisions for Christ, including 80 after one
drama presentation. "We've never seen anything like that," Snow said. During

A program that has a 70% success rate at helping rescue troubled marriages among Catholics has been adapted for a wider audience. Retrouvaille
(French for recovery), which began in Quebec in 1977, is used by Catholics in
36 states and seven countries (NIRR Special Supplement 11/1/93). Unlike
programs designed to improve basically sound marriages, Retrouvaille is for
couples "in misery" who are barely tolerating each other, said Angela Dunbar.
She and her husband, Loren, "translated" Retrouvaille materials, with the Catholic Church's permission, to a version suitable for Protestants. The Dunbars, who
are Protestant, learned about Retrouvaille after facing problems in their marriage.
<BR>...Retrouvaille starts with a group-weekend at a hotel or retreat center. But
participants are not expected to talk about their problems to the group. Instead,
they are asked 13 questions about communication, sex, money, in-laws, and the
like. For each question, the couple retires to their room to write answers individually. Then, if possible, they discuss the answers with each other before returning to the group.
<BR>...Six structured follow-up sessions over the next three months build on
communications skills and insights learned about each other during the initial
weekend. Retrouvaille doesn't ask couples to forgive each other until about the
fifth session, because doing so earlier is too hard for many people, Angela said.
For information, call the Dunbars at (505) 281-9576.

The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to decide whether a state can prevent
local governments from enacting measures aimed at protecting the civil rights of
homosexuals. At issue is a Colorado constitutional amendment that would forbid
the state or local jurisdictions from assigning protected status to homosexuals.
Voters in the state approved Amendment 2 in 1992, but the state Supreme Court
struck it down the following year. The ruling came after homosexuals and the
cities of Denver, Boulder, and Aspen challenged the measure. The court suggested last year that if the state wanted to protect the religious freedom of landlords

anti-discrimination laws. The court also said that although parents have a constitutional right to teach their own values to their children, there is no requirement
that the government endorse those values.

One of the most important free-speech cases in several years is coming
up before the Supreme Court, religious rights groups say. The high court is set to
review a ruling that forced Ohio officials to let the Ku Klux Klan exhibit a 10foot cross in a public park in Columbus for Christmas in 1993 (NIRR 12/13/93).
The state argued that a cross so close to the Statehouse would lead people to
think Ohio was endorsing Christianity. Lower courts in the case, Capitol Square
Review and Advisory Board v. Pinette, ruled for the KKK. They stressed the
government's duty to be impartial in allowing the use of any public forum. But
in similar cases, federal appeals courts have disagreed, stressing government
separation from religion. 
<BR>...The case "will finally deal with the issue of private displays of religious
symbols on public properties," said Jay Sekulow of the American Center for Law
and Justice. Mathew Staver of Liberty Counsel said losing the case would "open
the floodgates to censor religious speech."

Police arrested an Albuquerque, N.M., mother for slapping her teen-age
son after he defied her. Valerie Chino, who works at the private Christian school
her two boys attend, was charged with battery because she slapped Earl Chino,
13. The boy was fighting with his 12-year-old brother when she attempted to
break up the altercation. Earl then yelled that he did not have to obey her. After
she slapped him, he called Albuquerque police, who took his mother away in
handcuffs, according to her attorney, David Reynolds.
<BR>...Valerie Chino has a right to administer reasonable physical discipline
under common law and because of her religious belief in corporal punishment,
said Reynolds of the Rutherford Institute. A trial is set for late this month.

Throngs of angry Muslims protested in the streets of Lahore, Pakistan,
after an appeals court dismissed charges against two Christians. Salamat Masih
and Rehmat Masih had been sentenced to hang for allegedly insulting Islam in
graffiti (<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/022095.html">NIRR 2/20</A>). The two-judge Lahore High Court said there was insufficient evidence to hold them. The justices also warned against the spread of
Muslim extremism and called on the government to take actions to control it. In
the streets outside the court, militants vowed to kill the defendants, judges, and
lawyers in the case. Denmark offered the two Christians asylum, and a day later
they were whisked aboard a plane for Europe.

The activities of former TV evangelist Robert Tilton and his Dallas-based
Word of Faith ministry are protected by freedom of religion, an appeals court in
Oklahoma City ruled. It upheld a 1993 decision in a lawsuit by three Tulsa
women. Two of them claimed they suffered distress because Tilton kept sending
solicitations to their husbands after his ministry was notified that they had died.
The third claimed she lost her house because she sent Tilton money. James
Garrett, chief judge of the appeals court, said solicitation of funds "is the rule
and not the exception" in most denominations. The fact that letters kept coming
does not diminish Tilton's rights, he said.

A red cloth that once covered a painting of Jesus was left hanging on a
high school wall to protest a court order that brought the painting down. School
officials in Bloomingdale, Mich., removed the picture during a midnight prayer
ceremony last month. They have appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme
Court. A federal district court ordered the copy of Warner Sallman's Head of
Christ removed after an agnostic student, Eric Pensinger, successfully sued the
school district. He claimed the picture violated his rights. The court allowed the
picture to remain covered during two years of appeals (NIRR 9/19/94).

Several members of the 100-voice Swarthmore College chorus are
refusing to sing Johann Sebastian Bach's St. John Passion. They say it smacks of
anti-Semitism with its story of Jewish demands for the death of Jesus. The
chorus is scheduled to sing at a gathering next month. A Jewish religion major
first raised the objection after reading the English translation of the piece, news
reports said. Since then, debate about the issue has swept across the Quakerfounded liberal arts college outside Philadelphia.

The KGB is trying to thwart International Russian Radio/TV, according to
John Haukka, director of North American affairs for the group. The ministry
broadcasts the gospel on state radio and television networks to 300 million
people in the former Soviet Union. On Feb. 8, its Moscow office and equipment
were taken over illegally by its office manager, a Christian pastor, Haukka told
NIRR. Although the pastor later confessed betrayal and returned the equipment,
the building already had been sold.
<BR>...Judging from past experiences "the footsteps lead suspiciously to the
KGB," Haukka said. In 1990, a KGB agent posing as a Christian obtained
employment at the studio in Finland and began collecting information on the
ministry. The plan was exposed after he defected to Sweden, became a Christian,
and revealed everything to Haukka's brother, Hannu, founder and president of
the ministry. "Forgive me," the agent told him, "I was sent to destroy you, but
couldn't go through with it."  
<BR>...IRR/TV "has been a ministry of miracles since day one," Haukka said.
Originally producing underground videos, the ministry was offered a contract to
air its programming on Channel 1, the state supported network, after a brief clip
generated thousands of requests for similar shows. "We aired a whole year of
Christian programming with the Communists still in power -- that's the biggest
miracle of all," Haukka said. When communist leaders, vexed by the queries of
their watching grandchildren, tried to have the shows blocked, the entire programming department of Channel 1 threatened to quit, according to Haukka.

Victims of clergy abuse urged a panel of Catholic bishops to turn over
suspected pedophiles to police and stop trying to handle matters themselves.
"Bishops shouldn't be doing the investigation of criminals," said Barbara Blaine
of SNAP, the Chicago-based Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests.
SNAP also asked that every U.S. bishop give them names of abusive priests who
pleaded guilty or were permanently removed from ministry, according to Religion News Service. The group reportedly maintains a database of more than 550
abusive priests, culled from court records, media reports, and its 2,100 members.
<BR>...It was the first time representatives of SNAP met with the seven-member
sexual abuse panel, which reviews policy on clergy misconduct for the nation's
185 Catholic dioceses. The panel took no action on the SNAP requests.

being carried out under the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act.

Contemporary Christian music has become the fastest-growing form of
popular music in the United States, according to The Gospel Music Association.
Record sales and concert receipts total $1 billion a year. Recordings by Petra,
DC Talk, Sandi Patty, Michael W. Smith, and Steven Curtis Chapman all have
sold at or above a million copies. Outselling them all is Amy Grant, 34, who has
sold 15 million secular and religious records in her 17-year career. Ten years
ago, fewer than 200 stations played contemporary Christian music. Now there are
more than 500, Forbes magazine reported.
<BR>...Corporate executives have taken notice. Three years ago, all of the record
companies producing contemporary Christian music were independently owned,
The New York Times reported. They have since been bought out by large music
companies. Also, many prominent secular record labels and music-publishing
firms are creating contemporary Christian music divisions.

CBS-TV ordered a new batch of episodes of Christy, a series based on the
life of the mother of the late Christian writer Catherine Marshall (NIRR
11/28/94). The show's Hollywood producer, Ken Wales, an evangelical, said
high ratings accounted for the CBS move. The initial eight-segment series and a
Thanksgiving special garnered "Super Bowl numbers" in parts of the Midwest,
he told Religion News Service. New episodes may start airing this month.
<BR>...Religion, spirituality, and family issues increasingly will be common
themes on prime-time TV, NBC President Warren Littlefield predicted. NBC was
ready when actress Patty Duke last year proposed a show starring her as a
minister, he said. The series, Amazing Grace, will debut April 1.

A national poll of children 10 to 16 found that large numbers of kids are
concerned about the influence of the mass media on values. Among the findings:
66% of respondents said they think people their age are influenced by what they
see on TV; 65% said some TV shows encourage children to disrespect their
parents; 62% said that sex in TV shows and movies influences kids to have sex.
Yet 82% believed TV should help teach children right from wrong, according to
Children Now, the advocacy group that commissioned the survey.

An independent Christian movie producer is trying to demonstrate to
Hollywood that people want to see more wholesome movies. Sybil Robson left
Universal Studios and formed her own production company, Robson Entertainment, to make films that reflect positive values. Originally from Oklahoma,
Robson said parents are dissatisfied with movies. "When I go home and they
find out I'm a producer, they come out with their rolling pins," she told NIRR.
Her company's first production, Gordy, is for parents and children, Robson said.
The movie is about a pig who keeps his vow to save his family from the sausage
factory. "He is a promise-keeping pig," Robson said. The movie is scheduled to
open in 1,000 theaters May 5, but free previews will be shown in 100 cities
March 25. Robson encouraged people who wish to show Hollywood they want
more family entertainment to come to the free screenings. To find the nearest

Pat Robertson sold his two Washington, D.C.-based radio news services,
StandardNews and ZapNews, to Major Networks, Inc., of Chicago. The two
services were owned by Broadcast Equities, Inc., a subsidiary of U.S. Media
Corp., part of Robertson's Virginia Beach-based Christian Broadcasting Network.
StandardNews, started in January 1993, has a staff of about 50 and provides
hourly newscasts to some 600 stations across the country. ZapNews, acquired in
September 1993, has about 10 employees and serves 300 broadcast-outlet
subscribers, according to CBN spokesman Gene Kapp. Under the agreement, BEI
laid off about 20 members from the staffs, said Roy Simpson, vice president of
radio for Major Networks.

Marijuana use among American youth is increasing. Twice as many juveniles tried pot last year than in 1992, according to a University of Michigan study.
"It's time to sound the alarm," said Lee Brown, director of the White House
Office on Drug Control Policy. The potency of today's marijuana is five to 10
times that of the marijuana of the 1950s, Brown said. A popular new way to
smoke marijuana is with "blunts," gutted cigars stuffed with pot.

Religious leaders are taking sides over Dr. Henry Foster, Jr.'s nomination
as U.S. Surgeon General. Officials of the 8.2-million-member National Baptist
Convention USA, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Church of God in
Christ, the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, and the Progressive National
Baptist Convention last month issued statements backing him. Opposing Foster
are leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention and a number of pro-life and
other groups, including Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council.
They cite a past that included more abortions than he initially reported as well as
controversial medical procedures.

The Bible Roadmap Series is a correspondence course for Bible study
over the Internet. The course, written by Monroe Hawley of Michigan Christian
College, is a 30-lesson study that takes readers through the Bible. Jim Hill, a
systems engineer at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, decided to
introduce the course after more than 60,000 people signed up for another study
program on the Internet. Participants will receive the materials free through their
electronic mail boxes. They also will be paired with an "instructor," a volunteer
layperson who will offer assistance and grade the material. Thirty people volunteered to be instructors. Hill anticipates the program will be ready early this
month. For more information contact Hill at (205) 731-9570 or through the
Internet at jim@jsf.uab.edu.

A Connecticut pastor performed the wedding ceremony for his son's
killer. Walter Everett, pastor of The United Methodist Church of Hartford,
Conn., officiated at the nuptials of Michael Carlucci last November. Carlucci
pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the second degree for shooting Scott Everett to
death in 1987. He received a 10-year sentence, which was suspended after five.
While Carlucci was in prison, Everett corresponded with, and eventually visited
him. Carlucci told him that, after receiving Everett's first letter, he knelt in his
prison cell and asked God for forgiveness. In the prison, after an hour-long
discussion, the two men stood, shook hands, embraced, and cried, Everett said.
Christians "won't be able to understand why Jesus came and what Jesus is all
about unless we forgive," he said. Carlucci runs a trucking business and spends
his spare time speaking to inmates about what God has done in his life.
