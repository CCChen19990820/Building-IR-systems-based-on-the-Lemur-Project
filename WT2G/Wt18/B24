<h3>Repeated Sequence Elements in Zebrafish and Their Use in
Molecular Genetic Studies  </h3>

<p>

	Although zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) has many advantages over other organisms for studies in
developmental genetics (1, 2), certain well-developed methodologies for genetic analysis are
lacking. Repetitive sequences in general, and transposable elements in particular, have been
found in all metazoan genomes in which they have been sought (3). Transposons have many
potential applications in genetic research and are routinely used for insertional mutagenesis, gene
mapping, gene tagging and gene transfer in other well-established model systems. These
methods, once developed for zebrafish, would greatly facilitate the identification and mapping of
genes involved in vertebrate embryogenesis and to investigate the evolutionary processes that
have been shaping eukaryotic genomes (4, 5). Accordingly, we decided to characterize repetitive
elements from zebrafish.<p>

	The first repetitive elements characterized in the zebrafish genome were the AluI repeats (6, 7).
These satellite-like, high copy-number elements form long, tandem arrays. They come in two
types. Type I is A+T-rich and composes 5-8% of the zebrafish genome whereas Type II is
G+C-rich and composes about 1% of the <i>Danio rerio</i> genome. Both types are highly
polymorphic, are suitable for identifying individuals within a species, and can be used for
mapping genes and other DNA sequences. We attempted to use these sequences to enhance
integration of transgenic DNA constructs through homologous recombination, but were
unsuccessful (6). Therefore, we investigated two other types of repetitive elements that are
mobile in genomes, elements that move directly through DNA copies and elements that
transpose through an RNA intermediate, retroposons. Figure 1 shows the various families of
repeated sequences that have been found in zebrafish; microsatellite (simple) sequences such as
poly(A) and TG/CA sequences are not shown or discussed. We use the terms "transposon" and
"retroposon" if the respective element has structural and/or sequence characteristics of known
and active transposable elements, regardless of whether the particular sequence has been shown
to transpose in the laboratory.<p>

	We first examined Tc1-like transposable elements (TCEs) which had been identified and
characterized in salmonid fish species and zebrafish (8). TCEs transpose directly via a DNA 
intermediate, similar to P elements and hobo from <i>Drosophila</i>. In nematodes, Tc1 is widely used
for insertional and deletional mutagenesis, transposon-tagging and enhancer trapping. In an
attempt to employ such an element in zebrafish for the same purposes, we characterized the
zebrafish Tdr1 element (9). Tdr1 was successfully amplified about 1000-fold in the zebrafish,
constituting a little less than 0.1% of the haploid genome. However, all of the isolated copies
isolated so far (and the search has been intensive) are mutated and do not encode an active
transposase. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the zebrafish genome contains multiple TCE
families, e.g., Tdr2 (10). Analysis of several copies of Tdr1 and TCEs isolated from other fish
species (10) helped us to reconstruct a consensus sequence of a fish TCE transposase gene
which, when expressed as a protein, has many of the known enzymatic activities of the
transposases (11). The synthetic Tc1-like element should prove useful as an efficient vector for
delivery of transgenes as well as for insertional mutagenesis and enhancer/promoter trapping and
gene mapping.<p>

<img align="left" src="fig1.gif">	We have identified a third family of repeated elements in the zebrafish genome, the  DANA
elements (12). DANA is a retroposon (retroelement) that lacks long terminal repeats and
apparently transposes by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate. DANA is specific for the
genus Danio, and was the first retroposon isolated from zebrafish. DANA exhibits all the
hallmarks of a tRNA-derived SINE (<u>sh</u>ort <u>in</u>terspersed element). In contrast to generic SINE
elements, DANA appears to have been formed by insertions of short sequences (Cv blocks in
Fig. 1) into a progenitor, tRNA-derived element, and amplified further as a transposable unit.
DANA can be particularly suitable as a genetic marker because it has high copy-number
(comprising about 10% of the zebrafish genome), has an apparently random distribution in the
genome, and has a Mendelian segregation pattern suggesting that the elements are stable in the
genome. With DANA-specific PCR-primers (12), the method of SINE-PCR (13) can be used for
genome mapping, fingerprinting and YAC cloning. Association of DANA with
microsatellite-like repeats permits the combination of SINE-PCR and microsatellite marker
mapping (13). "DANA-PCR" can be employed in combination with RAPD markers (14) for
genetic and phylogenetic analyses.<p>

	Transposable elements are capable of inserting into each other to form composite elements that
can be amplified. Evidence for one such event has been found in zebrafish; a DANA-related
element apparently inserted into another sequence that subsequently was amplified and inserted
into the zebrafish ntl  gene (15). The particular composite element that integrated into the ntl
gene is amplified about 80- to 100-fold in the genome (16), although the mechanism by which
the element spread is not known. Other, unidentified, composite elements surely exist in the
zebrafish genome; their structures and modes of amplification remain to be determined. Their
importance is demonstrated by the observation that the DANA-composite element is responsible
for one of only three spontaneous phenotypic mutants that have been characterized at the
sequence level.<p>

	A fourth type of repeated element, named Oops (17), has been found in the zebrafish genome.
Oops is a short repetitive  sequence with the potential to form a cruciform structure. These
fold-back-like elements, similar to the Tourist/Stowaway families, have heretofore been found
only in fungi and plant genomes (18). Oops was found to accompany other repetitive elements
such as DANA, thereby forming complex structures. Oops is found in and around expressed
genes such as growth hormone, eIF-4E, and ntl. Like other repeated elements (19), Oops may be
able to influence expression of nearby genes.<p>

	In conclusion, about 15-20% of the zebrafish genome has been characterized in terms of several
types of repeated elements. Understanding the dynamics and evolution of these sequences will
allow us to harness them, or derivatives thereof, for further genetic manipulations and analyses in
zebrafish.<p>

<h3>WHOLE-MOUNT <i>IN SITU</i> HYBRIDIZATION OF THICK
TISSUE SECTIONS</h3>
<p>

By Qiling Xu and David Wilkinson; Randall Institute, King's College London, 26-29 Drury
Lane, London WC2B 5RL, UNITED KINGDOM<p>

<p>

	This is a method involving RNA <i>in situ</i> hybridization of unmounted tissue sections by a
whole-mount procedure.  It is suitable for large embryos, but may be difficult to carry out with
small pieces of tissue that can easily be damaged or lost during the washes. It provides more
sensitivity for detection of RNAs than obtained using thin tissue sections mounted on slides, and
avoids the penetration problems with whole-mounts of large embryos.<p>

1.  Fix embryos in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4 C. <p>

2.  Rinse in PBS, then process for sectioning as described below. We have used embryos
embedded in paraffin wax, but it is likely that cryostat sections work at least equally well. Cut
~50m sections. <p>

3.  If wax sections have been cut, dewax with Histoclear 3 times for 5 min, then wash in 100%
methanol 3 times for 5 min, and go to step 5. <p>

4.  If cryostat sections have been cut, dehydrate in 5 min washes of 25%, 50%, 75% methanol in
PBS, then twice in 100% methanol. <p>

5.  Rehydrate in 5 min washes of 75%, 50%, 25% methanol in PBS and 3 times in PBT.<p>

6.  Treat with 10g/ml proteinase K in PBT for 10-15 min at room temperature.<p>

7.  Rinse briefly with PBT and then refix with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min.<p>

8.  Wash 4 times for 5 min each with PBT.<p>

9.  Prehybridize in hyb mix at 65 C for 2-3 h.<p>

10. Replace with hyb mix containing DIG-labelled probe and hybridize overnight at 65 C.<p>

11. Wash for 10 min each at 65 C in:<p>

       <b>Solution 1</b><br>
       3:1 solution 1: 2 x SSC<br>
       1:1 solution 1: 2 x SSC<br>
       1:3 solution 1: 2 x SSC<br>
       2 x SSC<br>
<p>

12. Wash twice for 30 min each at 65 C in 0.2 x SSC<p>

13. Wash for 10 min each at room temp in:<p>

       3:1 0.2 x SSC: PBT<br>
       1:1 0.2 x SSC: PBT<br>
       1:3 0.2 x SSC: PBT<br>
       PBT<br>
<p>

14. Block with blocking solution for 60 min.<p>

15. Replace with 1/5000 diluted AP-coupled anti-DIG antibody in blocking solution and incubate
at 4 C overnight.<p>

16. Wash in TBT 6 times for 20 min each.<p>

17. Equilibrate with NTMT, 3 times for 5 mins.<p>

18. Stain with NBT/BCIP in NTMT.<p>

19. After appropriate amount of staining has been obtained, wash three times with PBT.<p>

20. Equilibrate in 70% glycerol in PBT and mount under a coverslip. The sections may appear
wrinkly, but by placing them on a slide in a minimum amount of liquid and gently unfolding any
creases, they can be nicely flattened under a coverslip (use silicon grease to support the edges of
the coverslip). <p>

<p>

<b>Solutions</b><p>

<p>

PBT: PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100<p>

<i>Hyb mix</i>: 50% formamide, 5 x SSC, pH 6.0, 0.5 mg/ml yeast RNA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 g/ml
heparin (This is the hyb mix we have used, but your favorite hyb mix for whole-mounts should
also work)<p>

<i>Solution 1:<b> </b></i>50% formamide, 5 x SSC<p>

<i>Blocking solution</i>: 2 mg/ml BSA, 5% sheep serum, 1% DMSO in PBT<p>

<i>TBT</i>: 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100.<p>

<i>NTMT</i>: 100mM NaCl, 100mM TrisHCl pH 9.5, 50mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100.  Make from
concentrated stocks on day of use (because the pH will decrease during storage due to the
absorption of carbon dioxide).<p>

<p>

<i>NBT</i>: 75 mg/ml in 70% dimethylformamide (store at -20 C); use 4.5l per ml NTMT.<p>

<i>BCIP</i>: 50 mg/ml in dimethylformamide (store at -20 C); use 3.5l per ml NTMT.<p>

<p>

<b>Preparation of wax sections</b><p>

1. After fixation and washing in PBS, dehydrate by washing for 30 min each in 25%, 50%, 75%
methanol in PBS, 3 times in 100% methanol, then 2 times in Histoclear.<p>

2. Incubate for 20 min at 60 C in 1:1 Histoclear: paraffin wax, then 3 times in paraffin wax.<p>

3. Transfer to suitable mould, orientate as required and allow wax to set.<p>

4. Cut 50m sections on a microtome. Continue the hybridization protocol at step 3.<p>

<p>

<b>Preparation of cryostat sections</b><p>

1. After fixation and washing in PBS, embed in 5% sucrose, 1.5% LMP agarose (Sigma) and
then leave the blocks in 30% sucrose, 1% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 C to equilibrate.<p>

2. Cut 50m thick sections on a cryostat, incubate in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min,
then continue hybridization protocol at step 4.<p>

<h3>CONSTRUCTION OF ZEBRAFISH SPAWNING CAGES</h3>
<p>

By P. Ham and K. Cheng; Department of Pathology, C7804, Hershey Medical Center, 500
University Drive, Hershey, PA 17033, USA<p>

<p>

	We have received several requests for detailed instructions for construction of durable,
autoclavable, economical spawning cages, which we summarize here.  We use a design similar to
one described by Solnica-Krezel et al. (<i>Genetics</i> 1994, <b>136</b>:1404).  The end-product is an opaque
cage with a wire-mesh bottom, placed inside of a transparent cage.  As the fish spawn, eggs drop
through the mesh to a space in the outer cage that the adults cannot reach.  <p>

	Tools required include pliers, glue gun, medium steel shears, hotplate stirrer, large file, razor
blade, and carbide-tipped blade on a table saw.  Materials include stainless steel wire mesh
(McMaster-Carr, 9226T79; 8 x 8 per inch),  9 3/8 x 5 7/16 x 5 1/8" polycarbonate (Nalgene
6602277) and polypropylene (Nalgene No. 6621177) animal cages.  Melt the plastic to the mesh
in a fume hood, in case of smoke.<p>

<p>

The steps: <p>

<p>

1) Slowly and precisely remove the bottoms of the polypropylene cages using a carbide-tipped
blade on a table saw. <p>

<p>

2) Remove large burrs with the razor. <p>

<p>

3) Create a template and cut wire-mesh bottoms from the stainless steel mesh using sheet metal
shears.  The edges of the mesh should meet the outer edges of the cage walls for a proper fit.  <p>

<p>

4) With a hot glue gun, temporarily glue the wire-mesh to the polypropylene cage bottom in
about six places.  We suggest liberal glue application in six spots: in the middle of one of the
shorter sides, and 3-4 cm. away from each corner along the long sides.  Excess glue provides a
handle for subsequent glue removal.  <p>

<p>

5) Melt the wire-mesh into the bottom of the polypropylene cage on the unglued end using a
hotplate.  We use a Corning PC-320 hotplate stirrer at a setting of about 4, and hold the cage at
both sides at an angle of  approximately 30 .  Softening of the plastic proceeds from the edges
towards the middle; continue to press down until the two flows meet.  Cooling may be
accelerated on a cold surface.  When a lip of melted plastic forms on the outside edge of the cage,
one can push the plastic over the edges of the wire using a flat tool.  <p>

<p>

6)  Melt the other sides one half length at a time, removing the temporary hot glue beforehand
(remaining glue will smoke).  <p>

<p>

7) File protruding sharp edges towards the cage openings to prevent dislodging the mesh from
the cages.<p>

	While using these cages for spawning zebrafish during the past three years, we have found that
plastic "greens" appear to miminize trauma by providing refuge, and cloth covers help to
minimize distraction of the fish by lab personnel.<p>

<h3>HOW YOU CAN HELP BUILD THE ZEBRAFISH DATABASE</h3>
<p>

A group of us were appointed at the 1994 Cold Spring Harbor meeting on zebrafish genetics and
development, to establish an on-line database of information for zebrafish researchers. We have
obtained funding from the National Science foundation and The Zebrafish Database Project is
underway. We are currently in the process of implementing the database which will run over the
Internet. We need two kinds of help:<p>

<p>

1. We ask that you help us with this project by making suggestions for the kinds of data that will
be included in the database.<p>

<p>

2. We hope you can tell us how you use the current Fish Net WWW server
<a href="http://zfish.uoregon.edu">http://zfish.uoregon.edu</a> and what sort of things you would like to be able to do with an on-line
database.<p>

<p>

Please send suggestions to either Monte Westerfield <a href="mailto:monte@uoneuro.uoregon.edu">monte@uoneuro.uoregon.edu</a> or
Wolfgang Driever <a href="mailto:driever@helix.mgh.harvard.edu">driever@helix.mgh.harvard.edu</a>.<p>

<h2>The Zebrafish Science Monitor, Vol 3 (6)</h2>
<h3>AN ECONOMICAL ZEBRAFISH GENETICS FACILITY</h3>
<p>

By E.G. Gestl and K.C. Cheng; Division of Experimental Pathology and Department of
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033 USA.<p>

<p>

<b>General Description</b><p>

	Our goal was to set up a zebrafish facility at minimum cost that would support a mutant hunt,
maintain healthy fish with minimum effort, and offer modular flexibility and the greatest
efficiency with regard to feeding, water changes, and system maintenance.  We have just finished
construction of a facility with a capacity of 51 ten gallon tanks and 144 five gallon tanks at a cost
of about $36,000.  The water temperature is regulated by a mixer valve and by room temperature,
and is usually set at 28C.  A light/dark cycle of 14h/10h is achieved using electronic timers. 
System water recirculates at a rate of up to 5 water changes per hour with standard use being 3-4
changes per hour.  The system was designed to fit in an existing room in the Animal Facility at
the Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey Medical Center, and was slowly brought to 50%
capacity over about 6 months.  Our fish appear to be very healthy.  <p>

<p>

<b>Tanks and Stands</b><p>

	The tanks were made by All-Glass Aquarium to be 1" shorter than the standard 10- and 5-gallon
tanks (11" and 9", respectively) to allow more working space above the tanks.  The tank
walls are approximately 1/8" thick with a 1" hole drilled in an upper corner (centered at 1"
down from the plastic lip and 1" in from the side) into which a " bulkhead (Aquatic
Eco-Systems, TFK1) is siliconed in place.  The lids consist of 2 overlapping glass pieces sliding
on a plastic rail purchased from Tropical Isle.  Each glass lid has a corner cut off, the rear lid for
a water inlet into the tank and the front lid for liquid feeding such as brine shrimp.  <p>

	The stands are constructed of grade 304 #4 polished stainless steel (Staco).  Other labs would use
local metal companies to minimize shipping costs.  The structural supports for the stands are
made of 1" square tubing and the shelves from 18 gauge stainless steel sheet metal.  The
shelves have a " lip and a " hole in one corner so that in the case of an overflowing tank the
water is contained and exits through the hole into the drain.  Each leg also has a 2" square
footplate to distribute the weight evenly.  The  stands for the five gallon tanks have 4 rows of
tanks with 3, 4, or 5 tanks in a row, while the ten gallon tank stands have 3 rows of tanks with
either 3 or 4 tanks per row.<p>

<p>

<b>Description of the Recirculation System</b><p>

	Water leaving the tanks exits through the bulkhead by gravity and enters an angled 1" common
drainage pipe through open tees.  These lead to vertical 1" drainage pipes which in turn exit
into  90 gallon fiberglass sump tanks (Aquanetics, 18" D x 16" W x 75"L).  Before entering the
sumps the water passes through DSL pad filters (Aquanetics) to eliminate large particles.  Two of
the sumps are interconnected via a 2" PVC pipe which is below the water line.  To make efficient
use of the available space, tanks had to be placed on either side of a walkway.  The sumps on
each side are connected by a siphon system (3" PVC pipe) which transports 25 gpm or 40% of
the system's water back to the side of the room containing the pump.  This inverted "U" also has
a small peristaltic pump which pumps out the air that accumulates at the top of the "U."  This is
necessary for maintaining the siphon.  <p>

	Operating only one of two M1000-H pumps (Aquanetics), the water then goes through two sets
of two filters (Aquanetics, 420) each set containing a 150 m and 25 m bag filter (Aquanetics,
400-150 and 400-5).   The water is then sterilized using 2 ultraviolet (UV) sterilizing units placed
in series (Aquanetics, Q480IL and Q240IL).  The sterilizing power of the large unit at the
maximum flow rate is 45,000 wsec/cm2, 3-fold the killing power needed for viruses and
bacteria (15,000 wsec/cm2) so that many fungi, protozoa, and spores are also destroyed
(Aquacultural Engineering, Fredrick Wheaton, 1985).  The UV units are installed in series so that
when bulbs burn out, water will still be sterilized.  Therefore, the small unit has an output of at
least 15,000 wsec/cm2 and is placed in series with the first to ensure that the water is sterilized
at a minimal level.  The water leaving the UV system enters a network of PVC piping whose
pressure is equalized by circular loops throughout the system.  The water flow into the individual
tanks is controlled by no kink style globe valves (Aquatic Eco-systems, VK-2), and the cycle
begins again.  <p>

	The aeration system uses a 1/6 H.P. turbo-blower (Aquanetics, 104P) with silencer and filter. 
Air hose leads to every tank, and is plumbed in circular loops to yield equal pressure.  The air
exits the PVC pipe from plated brass valves (Aquatic Ecosystems, VN2), goes through 1/8"
silicone tubing (McMaster- Carr, 51135K16), and enters the water through Jungle glass-beaded
airstones (Jungle Laboratories, NJ297).  The usual rate of aeration per tank is 0.7 L/min while
4L/min is its maximum rate.  <p>

<p>

<b>Water Changes</b><p>

	To ensure that ammonia and other harmful toxins do not accumulate, the system is designed for
continuous automatic water changes; we exchange about 10% of the system volume per day. 
Waste water exits the system through a valve which is located between the filtration and UV
systems.  The temperature of the replacement water is regulated using a mixing valve.  This
water then passes through a pressure reducing valve and two carbon filters (Aquanetics, model
220) in series before entering the sump.  The flow rate is regulated by two parallel float valves
(AREA, FLV550-050) in one sump.  <p>

	In our second fish room, we wished to have automatic water changes in tanks in which babies are
raised.  Because babies are fed powdered food and paramecia, we did not want small food to plug
the particulate filters.  Therefore, we raise babies in the flow-through portion of our system.  To
keep things simple, we decided to use "conditioned" water from the recirculating system in the
flow-through system.  We also use flow-through tanks for quarantine purposes when new fish are
brought into the system.  The water leaving the tanks in the flow-through system goes to waste
drains.  In our basement system, 28 five-gallon tanks are used as flow through tanks. Another 44
five-gallon and 33 ten-gallon tanks will have this capability in the future.  The flow through of
these tanks represents from 0 to 100% of the water exchange in the system, with the remainder
draining from the recirculating portion of the water flow. System water pressure is adjusted using
two lines which bring water directly back to the sump either after the filter bags or after the UV
system.  <p>

	In order to maintain the maximum number of fish per volume of water, the dissolved oxygen
level of greater than 96% saturation is obtained using a bioreactor trickle filter (Aquanetics,
B126) which draws about 20% of the system flow following the bag filters, and returns aerated
water to the sump.<p>

<p>

<b>Individual Adult Tank System</b><p>

	In the recirculation section of our separate fish room, we recently added 160 one liter tanks, of
polystyrene.  These tanks (model T49F) were purchased from Alpack Inc. for $1.25/tank.  The
unhinged lids were drilled with 2 holes, one 3/8" in diameter in a back corner for a water inlet
line and the other 1 3/8" in diameter in the front center for feeding (we would recommend using a
1' hole next time, since fish occasionally jump out of the 1 3/8" holes).  A 1/8" wide, 1" deep slit
was cut in the front center of each tank for water to exit.  The shelf frame was constructed of
materials previously mentioned and has a pitch of " over the length of 51" to aid in drainage. 
The shelves are constructed of " thick acrylic with 1" high by " thick acrylic sides.  Each
shelf contains 2 rows of 10 tanks with access from either side of the rack.  <p>

	UV-sterilized water is pumped through 1" PVC pipe to the individual adult tank system where it
is regulated by a ball valve for each shelf.  The water exits the common water inlet by a 1/4"
threaded adapter with a 1/8" barbed end (Aquatic Eco-Systems, 62001).  A pipette tip attached to
1/8" tubing transports the water to the tank.  Water flows onto the acrylic shelf through the tank
slits, where gravity takes the water to one end of the shelf.  It then exits through a pair of 1/2"
bulkheads, enters a common drainage pipe, and empties into a sump which is connected to the
recirculation system.<p>

<p>

<b>Other Features of the System</b><p>

	An important advantage of the system is its flexibility.  First, back-up systems are important for
flood prevention and to ensure continuous running.  The room is divided into 4 zones with the
ability to isolate and stop water or air flow to that zone when the need arises.  The water pump,
bag filtration, and UV systems all have bypass routes which can be activated without stopping
water flow when damage occurs or routine maintenance is required.  For example, when the
siphon action in the inverted "U" siphon is broken, there is a back-up pump (Aquanetics,
TE-6-MO-SC) activated by a seesaw switch (AREA, LP19), which returns water to the other side
of the room.  In addition, when the
water level of the sumps becomes abnormally high for any reason, two parallel condensate pumps
(McMaster-Carr, 9907K11), each capable of pumping 100 gph, are activated.  The sterilization power
of the UV system was designed to be higher than normally used, with two UV sterilizing power units
in series.  This decreases the possibility of cross-contamination when bulbs inevitably burn out.<p>

	Monitoring of the system is eased by plumbing T's and valves so that water can be collected and
chemically analyzed at critical points.  Valves between and after the carbon filters allow us to test their
efficiency.  At other locations, branches have been added to allow measurement of water exchange and
bioreactor trickle flow rates.  True unions and true union ball valves were used in many areas to create
easy access to many parts of the system.  The low cost of this system must be balanced against the time
needed for design and construction.  However, the knowledge gained from setup has already helped us
to make changes and correct problems as required. <p>

	<I>her1</I> is a zebrafish cDNA encoding a bHLH protein with all features characteristic of members of the<I> Drosophila </I><I>hairy-E</I>(<I>spl</I>) family. During late gastrulation stages, <I>her1</I> is expressed in the epibolic margin and in two distinct transverse bands of hypoblastic cells behind the epibolic front. After completion of epiboly, this pattern persists essentially unchanged through postgastrulation stages; the marginal domain is incorporated in the tail bud and, depending on the time point, either two or three paired bands of expressing cells are present within the paraxial presomitic mesoderm separated by regions devoid of transcripts. Labeling of cells within the <I>her1</I> expression domains with fluorescein-dextran shows that the cells in the epibolic margin and the tail bud are not allocated to particular somites. However, allocation of cells to somites occurs between the marginal expression domain and the first expression band, anterior to it. Moreover, the <I>her1</I> bands and the intervening non-expressing zones, each represents the primordium of a somite. This expression pattern is highly reminiscent of that of <I>Drosophila</I> pair-rule genes. A possible participation of <I>her1</I> in functions related to somite formation is discussed. <P>

Corley-Smith, Institute of Molecular Biology & Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C.,	 CANADA</H4>	Coho salmon ovarian fluid can be used for delayed in vitro fertilization of zebrafish eggs.  Thus, it can be useful for sequential fertilization of small batches of eggs or for procedures where manipulations of eggs prior to fertilization are desired.<P>	Eggs can be squeezed from a female zebrafish, placed in a small amount of coho ovarian fluid, and held at room temperature, with fertilization rates of up to 85% still obtainable after one hour.  Various batches of ovarian fluid have varying abilities to preserve zebrafish eggs in a fertilizable state.<P>	To make coho ovarian fluid available to other zebrafish researchers, we have supplied it to a commercial distributor in the USA.  We collected coho ovarian fluid in Vancouver, B.C., Canada.  We tested individual batches and shipped it to SeaTech Bioproducts, who are now selling it for $20 /ml.  This alleviates the difficulties we were experiencing with sending the ovarian fluid through customs to zebrafish labs in the USA.<P>References below indicate how ovarian fluid is used.<P><ADDRESS><B>Supplier:</B>	<BR>SeaTech Bioproducts	<BR>141 California Street	<BR>Newton, Massachusetts 02158-1023 	USA	<BR>Telephone: (617) 965-5092	<BR>Voice: (617) 630-5145	<BR>e-mail: none yet	<BR>www: not yet</ADDRESS><P><LI>Cat # SOF-870-1  ( 1 ml for $20)<LI>Cat # SOF-870-5  (5 ml for $90)<P>	Ovarian fluid is presently shipped by SeaTech on dry ice.  As freeze dried samples are much cheaper to mail, we have freeze dried some coho ovarian fluid and will test it shortly for its efficiency in delaying fertilization of zebrafish eggs.  We are also working towards developing a defined medium in collaboration with Derek Stemple in Wolfgang Driever's Lab.  We have performed an extensive chemical analysis of coho ovarian fluid and hope by the summer of 96 to have a defined medium that has the ability to delay fertilization of zebrafish eggs .  At that time we will make the formulation available to the zebrafish community.  We presume most researchers would rather buy a relatively cheap mixture than make the mixture from scratch. Thus, if and when we develop such a mixture, we hope a company such as SeaTech will distribute it at a reasonable cost.  Until then, coho ovarian fluid is available, at least in a limited supply.<P>	I do not have any affiliation with SeaTech.  Collection and testing was performed at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, free of charge so that the coho ovarian fluid could be made available to other zebrafish researchers at as low a fee as possible.  Derek Stemple has received and tested coho ovarian fluid.  It worked for him.<P>References:<FONT  SIZE=-1><LI>    Corley-Smith, G.E., C.J. Lim and B.P.

<H2>ZEBRAFISH NOMENCLATURE</H2>
<FONT  SIZE=-1>Adapted from: Mullins, M. (1995) <I>TIG Genetic Nomenclature Guide: Zebrafish</I>.  Cambridge, UK: Elsevier Trends Journals, p. 31-32.</FONT><P>

By M. Mullins, University of Pennsylvania, Dept/Cell & Developmental Biology, 605 Stellar-Chance, 422 Curie Blvd., Philadelphia, PA 19104-6058 USA; (215) 898-2644/ FAX (215) 898-9871; <FONT SIZE=-1>MULLINS@MAIL.MED.UPENN.EDU</FONT><P>

<H3>Conventions</H3><P>

	Zebrafish gene names are lower case and italicized.  Abbreviations should be three Roman (no Greek) letters, or three letters with a number (no hyphens) italicized.  Names are not preceded by "z" or "zf".  Examples: <I>cyclops, cyc, engrailed2, eng2</I>.<P>

<H3>Genes and Other Loci</H3><P>

	For genes identified by mutation, the name chosen for the gene reflects the mutant phenotype, e.g. <I>floating head</I>, <I>no tail</I>.  When mutations in different genes confer similar phenotypes, the genes should be given distinct names.  Names identical to those used in other species should be avoided unless the genes are known to be homologous.  <P>
	Genes identified by cloning are named according to the same principles except that gene families identified in this way may be distinguished by letters following the name, e.g. <I>eng1, eng2, eng3</I>.
	Genes cloned by homology with genes in other organisms should be given the same name as their counterpart in the other organism, but designated according to the zebrafish conventions, e.g. the zebrafish homologue of the mouse <I>Wnt1</I> gene would be <I>wnt1</I>.  <P>

<H3>Alleles</H3>

	Wild-type alleles are designated by a superscript plus symbol, e.g. brs<SUPER>+</SUPER>.  Mutant alleles may be designated generically by a superscript minus, e.g. brs<SUPER>-</SUPER>.  Specific mutant alleles are denoted by superscripts following the gene name.  Dominant mutant alleles are designated by a "d" in the first position of the superscript.  There follows a letter designating the laboratory in which the allele was identified, and unique characters for the particular allele. Thus, each mutant allele has a unique designation.  For example, <I>cycb16, cycb13</I>, and <I>cycb229</I> are recessive alleles of <I>cyclops</I> identified in Eugene, Oregon (laboratory designation "b").  Some other laboratory designations are "m" for MGH, Boston; "t" for Tübingen; "n" for Newcastle.

<H3>Chromosomes and Linkage Groups</H3>

	Cytological definitions of chromosomes are not yet available.  The numbering system of linkage groups (I-XXV) should be used for now (Johnson et al., <I>Genetics</I> <B>142</B>:1277-1288, 1996).

<H3>Nomenclature Committee</H3>

	Mary Mullins (chair, see address above), Chuck Kimmel (University of Oregon, USA), José Campos-Ortega (University of Cologne, Germany), John Postlethwait (University of Oregon, USA), Nigel Holder (The Randall Institute, King's College, University of London, UK).<P>
	The full nomenclature guidelines are available in Mullins, M. (1995) Genetic methods: conventions for naming zebrafish genes, T<I>he Zebrafish Book: A Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish (Danio rerio),</I> Edition 3, M. Westerfield, ed., Eugene, Oregon: University of Oregon Press, p.p. 7.1-7.4.

<H2>PREPARATION OF DNA-NLS COMPLEXES FOR MICROINJECTION INTO FERTILIZED ZEBRAFISH EGGS</H2>

<FONT  SIZE=-1>By P. Collas and P. Aleström, Department of Biochemistry, Norwegian College of Veterinary Medicine, PO Box 8146 Dep., N-0033 Oslo, Norway</FONT>

<H3>Introduction</H3><P>

	We have previously reported the binding of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of SV40 T antigen to plasmid DNA, and the induction of transgene expression following injection of DNA-NLS complexes into the yolk of fertilized zebrafish eggs (Collas et al., 1996). NLS peptides were bound to DNA by simple ionic interaction at a 100:1 molar ratio of NLS:DNA. NLS peptides bound to plasmid DNA efficiently target DNA-NLS complexes to nuclei. Transient reporter gene expression with 104 plasmid copies injected per egg using this system is similar to that with 106-107 copies injected without the NLS peptide (see, e.g., Stuart et al., 1988; Culp et al. 1991; Collas et al. 1996). Binding NLS peptides to 106 plasmid copies or more is detrimental to transgene expression and zebrafish embryo survival (Collas et al., 1996).<P>
	We present here the procedure used in our laboratory to prepare plasmid DNA-NLS complexes for cytoplasmic injection into zebrafish eggs. Complexes are prepared at a ratio of 100 moles of NLS per mole of DNA. It is assumed that 10,000 plasmid copies are injected per egg, in a volume of 250 pl. Note that plasmid DNA can be in supercoiled or linear form.  The recipe is  for the following NLS peptide: CGGPKKKRKVG-NH2 (Collas et al., 1996a).<P>

<H3>Procedure</H3>

<LI>1. Calculate the intended concentration of plasmid DNA in the injection solution, taking into account DNA copy number and volume to be injected per egg. Prepare a DNA solution at 100x this concentration in H<SUB>2</SUB>O.

<LI>2. Calculate the number of moles of NLS peptide required to obtain a final NLS:DNA molar ratio of 100:1. Calculate the corresponding number of grams of NLS (M = 974), and prepare a 5x NLS solution in H<SUB>2</SUB>O (from an initial frozen stock dissolved in ddH<SUB>2</SUB>O at 1 mg/ml). 

<LI>3. Prepare 1 ml of 1 M KCl in H<SUB>2</SUB>O, and 1 ml of 1% phenol red in H<SUB>2</SUB>O.

<LI>4. Prepare the injection solution by mixing together:<P>

<TABLE>
<TR><TD>Sterile H<SUB>2</SUB>O</TD><TD></TD><TD>68  ul</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>1 M KCl</TD><TD></TD><TD> 50  ul</TD></TR>

</TABLE><p>

and incubate for 30 min at room temp.<P>
			
<LI>5. Filter the solution and proceed with injections (Collas et al., 1996b). This solution can be stored for at least two weeks at 4<SUP>o</SUP>C.

<H2>TEMPERATURE-SENSITIVE MUTATIONS THAT CAUSE STAGE-SPECIFIC DEFECTS IN ZEBRAFISH FIN REGENERATION
</H2>
<FONT  SIZE=-1>By S.L. Johnson and J.A. Weston, Institute of Neuroscience, 1254 University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon 97403-1254 USA
</FONT><p>
	When amputated, the fins of adult zebrafish rapidly regenerate the missing tissue. Fin regeneration proceeds through several stages, including wound healing, establishment of the wound epithelium, recruitment of the blastema  from mesenchymal cells underlying the wound epithelium, and differentiation and outgrowth of the regenerate.  We screened for temperature-sensitive mutations that affect the regeneration of the fin.  Seven mutations were identified, including five that fail to regenerate their fins, one that causes slow growth during regeneration, and one that causes dysmorphic bumps or tumors to develop in the regenerating fin.  <I>reg5</I> mutants fail to regenerate their caudal fins, whereas <I>reg6</I> mutants develop dysmorphic bumps in their regenerates at the restrictive temperature. Temperature shift experiments indicate that <I>reg5</I> and <I>reg6 </I> affect different stages of regeneration.  The critical period for <I>reg5 </I>occurs during the early stages of regeneration before or during establishment of the blastema, resulting in defects in subsequent growth of the blastema and failure to differentiate bone forming cells.  The critical period for <I>reg6</I>  occurs after the onset of bone differentiation and during early stages of regenerative outgrowth.  Both <I>reg5</I> and <I>reg6</I> also show temperature-sensitive defects in embryonic development or in ontogenetic outgrowth of the juvenile fin.

<H2>ZEBRAFISH STOCK CENTER PLANNED</H2>

<FONT  SIZE=-1>By. W. Driever, MGH East 4, 13th Street, Bldg. 149, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA</FONT><P>

	Following on the heels of discussion at the Cold Spring Harbor meeting, a committee has begun contacting various funding agencies who may be able to support a zebrafish stock center in North America.  Currently, groups from Boston and Eugene are working with both the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health.<P>

	Based the results of the survey which was conducted during the meeting, this group is compiling statistics about the need for and potential use of a stock center.  If you did not attend the meeting or did not have a chance to fill out this survey, please do so now.  A form is included with this issue of the <I>Monitor</I>.<P>

	It will also be extremely important for success of the funding applications to receive letters of support from you.  Please take a moment to write a short note to Wolfgang Driever.  State your view on the importance of establishing a centralized stock center that can maintain a collection of mutant and wild-type zebrafish and that can distribute these fish to the scientific community.<P>

	The committee would also like to hear from anyone else who is interested in planning the stock center or who may also be thinking about establishing a stock center so that efforts can be coordinated for highest efficiency and for best meeting the needs of the community.<P>

Please address your letters to:<P>

<H2>POSTER VIEWING AS A CONTACT SPORT</H2>

<FONT  SIZE=-1>By B. Jones, Cancer Research Labs, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario K7L 3N6, CANADA</FONT><P>

	The recent zebrafish development meeting at Cold Spring Harbor was, from my point of view, very successful, an intellectual feast served up against the background of spring on Long Island.  To northerners still experiencing the final assault of winter at home, the sight of tree blossoms and flowers, the sound of birds and frogs, and the feel of the warm spring sunshine, is seductive.  It is hard to imagine that in this idyllic setting danger lurks, but it does.  You may be thinking of the devastating allergic reactions brought on by those innocent blossoms, and all the itchy eyes and palates and noses you saw or heard or experienced, but the most dangerous thing at Cold Spring Harbor actually is poster-viewing.<P>
	Once in the crowded aisles of the Bush Lecture Hall between the posters, you are in immediate danger of being stepped on, tripped up, elbowed, jostled, speared, or overcome by heat or claustrophobia.  It is particularly difficult in this group dominated by tall Americans and northern Europeans, if you happen to be short and are caught in a group of people single-mindedly pursuing disparate routes to target posters in different parts of the room.  It is that awful feeling of being trapped in the hypoblast while the epiblast walks all over you.<P>
	Successful poster viewing, is best treated as a contact sport.  The following tips will help you reach your poster destinations, get you within range of the presenter, and provide you with a view of the written material.<P>

<LI>Do not wear open-toed sandals.  There may be many viewers out there who are taller and heavier and wearing sturdier footwear (fortunately stiletto heels are not in vogue for poster-viewing).  Remember when you are trodden that the offenders are probably not malicious, they just have a poor view of the floor through the thicket of legs.<P>
<LI>Drink plenty of liquids before the poster session (this is particularly important if you have been training in the bar the previous night; see item 6).  It will be hot and sweaty and it may be some time before you are able to navigate out to the drinking fountain.  Also, a well-lubricated throat has a better chance of projecting sound above the general din.<P>
<LI>Do some stretching and flexibility exercises before attempting to view the posters.  You will be in much better shape to twist and squat and take advantage of gaps at any level in front of your chosen poster.<P>
<LI>As with other spectator sports, it may be useful to bring a pair of small binoculars in case you are unable to work your way in to close range. Note that meeting decorum calls for confining binocular use to the posters.<P>
<LI>If you're not nimble enough to avoid being knocked off your feet, bring along a couple of sure-footed friends to block for you.<P>
<LI>The best form of cross-training may be a few sessions in the bar when the evening talks have ended.  There you will have plenty of practice squeezing into small open spaces, moving against the body tide, and attracting the attention of the distant bartender.  If you have perfected the "elbows out" technique and have survived without spilling a drink, you are ready for the poster hall.<P>
<LI>And finally, if you wish to resort to trickery to clear a space for yourself, just ask loudly if it is expressed in the nose.<P>

She was born in   Philadelphia on September 19, 1911.  After graduating from Bryn Mawr College in   1932, where she majored in zoology, she became a graduate student at Yale   University.  There she was influenced by John Spangler Nicholas, her Ph.D. advisor,   whom she credits with focusing her intellectual interests on both embryology and its   history, and by Ross Granville Harrison, director of the Osborn Zoological   Laboratories, the leading American embryologist of the day.  She received her Ph.D.   in zoology from Yale University in 1935.  The work she began as a graduate student   formed the basis for her experimental career. Nicholas introduced her to the embryo   of the common minnow or killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus. Nicholas had previously   devised a method for dechorionating the embryo, thus making it possible to perform   precise experimental manipulations on teleost embryos for the first time.  Miss   Oppenheimer independently pursued the work on Fundulus, while Nicholas pursued   his own interests in rat embryology and nervous system function.  <p>   Dr. Oppenheimer joined the faculty of Bryn Mawr College in 1938 as an   instructor in Biology.  She retired from the College faculty in 1980 as the William R.   Kenan, Jr. Professor of Biology and History of Science.  She belonged to numerous   professional and scholarly societies.  She was president of the American Society of   Zoologists (1973) and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of   Science.  Her many honors included election to the American Philosophical Society,   of which she was secretary from 1987 to 1992, and the Academy of Arts and Letters.    Among her national and international awards were the Otto H. Hafner Award from   the American Association of the History of Medicine and Medical Library   Association, the Karl Ernst von Baer Medal from the Estonian Academy of Sciences,   and the Wilbur Lucius Cross Medal from the Yale Graduate Alumni Association.    Bryn Mawr College recognized her teaching with the Christian R. and Mary F.   Lindback Award for distinguished teaching in 1976.  Professor Oppenheimer was   named a "Distinguished Daughter of Pennsylvania" in 1981.<p>   Dr. Oppenheimer made a number of important contributions to teleost   embryology.  A group of seven papers published from 1934 to 1937 is especially   noteworthy.  She showed that induction of a secondary axis including neural   structures can and does occur in Fundulus when grafts of vitally stained dorsal lip   material from young gastrulae are implanted into hosts the same stage as the donor.    Those grafting experiments demonstrated that the dorsal lip of the fish embryo   showed the same organizer activity as did the dorsal lip of amphibian embryos. Dr.   Oppenheimer also performed fate mapping experiments of the fish embryo   blastoderm and described cell movements of gastrulation.  She published a staging   series for Fundulus embryos.  These early papers provide a wealth of information   about the early development of the fish embryo of interest to contemporary workers.    Throughout her career as an embryologist, Dr. Oppenheimer continued to exploit the   methods of experimental embryology to explore questions of inductions,   differentiation capabilities and regulation.  One of her last Fundulus  projects   involved sending embryos into space to study the effects of zero gravity on   embryonic development.  She participated in the first joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperative   venture; Fundulus  embryos were included on the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz space shuttle   mission.<p>   As an historian of science and medicine, Dr. Oppenheimer wrote numerous   articles and reviews, many on the origins of embryology.  She enjoyed intellectual   history and was motivated to write about her library discoveries believing that "life in   our laboratories is made more meaningful to us when we know something about our   intellectual forebears."  A topic of special interest to her was the relationship of   embryological data to evolutionary theory.  She also relished telling dramatic stories   about early physiological and surgical discoveries.  Her biographical work included   some of the great historical figures in embryology such as Karl E. von Baer, Curt   Herbst and Ross Harrison. The influence of her work can be seen in a number of   disciplines including developmental biology and the history of science, anthropology,   evolutionary biology and psychology. Professor Oppenheimer's writings will   continue to be a source of valuable information and inspiration for others similarly   interested in following threads of modern ideas to their historical precedents,   especially for more recently educated American scientists whose lack of foreign   language training will prevent them from reading original sources.<p>   Jane M. Oppenheimer was an exacting scholar whose attention to detail was   noteworthy; she was also a prodigious book reviewer with more than 400 published   reviews.  She respected others who were erudite and had little patience for those who   lacked rigor in scholarship. Colleagues who were creative and imaginative as well as   rigorous gained her admiration.  In recent years, she was delighted by the resurgence   of interest in teleost embryology, and she followed modern work on zebrafish   development with considerable interest.  As much as she appreciated the recognition   given her once overlooked Fundulus embryological work done more than one-half   century ago, she would have been dismayed by the incorrect attributions and   bibliographic errors which occur not infrequently in modern journal articles. As an   historian and a scientist, she took pains to get all her facts right and to place them in   the context of a broader conceptual framework.  Borrowing a sentence from one of   her own book reviews:  "The qualities of her work are inseparable from those of her person."<hr><h3><I>The Zebrafish Science Monitor</I>, Vol 4(1)</h3>Return to <a href="cont.html">Contents</a><p><p><hr><p><A HREF="/index.html">The Fish Net <img src="fish_net.gif"></A></BODY></HTML>

<H3>ABSTRACT</H3>
We describe a series of stages for development of the embryo of the zebrafish, <i>Danio (Brachydanio) rerio</i>.  We define 5 broad <i>periods</i>  of embryogenesis - the zygote, cleavage, blastuIa, gastrula, segmentation, pharyngula, and hatching periods.  These divisions highlight the changing spectrum of major developmental processes that occur during the first three days after fertilization, and we review some of what is known about morphogenesis and other significant events that occur during each of the periods.  <i>Stages</i> subdivide the periods.  Stages are named, not numbered as in most other series, providing for flexibility and continued evolution of the staging series as we learn more about development in this species.  The stages, and their names, are based on morphological features, generally readily identified by examination of the live embryo with the dissecting stereomicroscope.  The descriptions also fully utilize the optical transparancy of the live embryo, which provides for visibility of even very deep structures when the embryo is examined with the compound microscope and Nomarksi interference contrast illumination.  Photomicrographs and composite <i>camera lucida  </i>line drawings characterize the stages pictorially.  Other figures chart the development of distinctive characters used as staging aid signposts. <p>

<b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b>
During the past 20 years a very large number of our colleagues at the University of Oregon have been most generous in sharing their findings, and insights, that have helped immeasurably in our being to assemble this series.  Walter K. Metcalf, Eric Hanneman, and Rachel Warga did the first staging work at Oregon at particular periods of embryogenesis.  Many others, including Cosima Fabian, Robert Kelsh, Beth Morin-Kensicki, Mark Fishman, Beatte Schmitz, J. P. Trinkaus, and Rachel Warga have shared unpublished information, and Monte Westerfield criticized several versions of the text.  Jerry Gleason and Greg Kruse helped technically, and Pat Edwards located many of, and entered all of the references.   Reida Kimmel made the photographic prints, and helped in multitudinous other ways including giving her unfailing encouragement throughout the project.  The more recent work and the writing were supported by NIH grants HD22486 and 5T32 HD07348.

<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
A staging series is a tool that provides accuracy in developmental studies.  This is because different embryos, even together within a single clutch, develop at slightly different rates.  We have seen asynchrony appearing in the development of zebrafish, <i>Danio (Brachydanio) rerio</i>, embryos fertilized simultaneously <i>in vitro</i>  (C. Walker &amp; G. Streisinger, in Westerfield, 1994) and incubated at an optimal temperature without crowding (28.5C, 5-10 embryos/ml).  Asynchrony arises at the earliest stages, and it becomes more pronounced as time passes.  Comparisons reveal more of this variability among embryos from different clutches than from within a single clutch.  Genetic uniformity may alleviate but does not eliminate this problem; even embryos of a clonal strain of zebrafish (Streisinger et al., 1981) develop asynchronously.	<p>
As for other kinds of embryos, staging by morphological criteria partly resolves this problem.  For example, primary trigeminal sensory neurons in the head (Metcalfe et al<i>.</i>, 1990) and primary motoneurons in the trunk (Eisen et al<i>.</i>, 1986) both initiate axogenesis during stages when somites appear successively along the body axis.  Staging by somite number more accurately predicts where these neurons will be in their development than does staging by elapsed time after fertilization (personal communications from W. K. Metcalfe and J. S. Eisen).  Recording one's experiments with reference to a staging series provides a good way to ensure reproducibility, and to allow subsequent incorporation of new observations and details.  A series based on morphology can also facilitate communication; the descriptor "18-somite embryo", has more meaning than "18-hour old embryo", particularly in cross species comparisons.	<p>
An earlier staging series for zebrafish, although less complete than the present one, fairly accurately portrays the first third (or first day) of embryonic development, and includes useful sets of photographs (Hisaoka &amp; Battle, 1958; Hisaoka &amp; Firlit, 1960).  Warga &amp; Kimmel (1990) briefly described stages of the blastula and gastrula.  Preliminary versions of this series were circulated and published in <i>The Zebrafish Book</i> (Westerfield, 1994).  The present version substantially revises, corrects, and expands the earlier ones.  Hard copies of the figures can be obtained from Bonnie Ullmann: <I>ullmann@uoneuro.uoregon.edu</I>.

<H3>ORGANIZATION</H3>

	We have named the stages rather than numbering them as in most other series, because named stages are more flexible and easier to remember or recognize than numbered ones.  A stage defines more than an instant in time, it is merely a device for approximately locating a part of the continuum of development.  With named stages one can easily add detail as it is learned, and intercalate new stages into the series as necessary for a particular study without resorting to cumbersome devices like decimal numbers, minuses, and pluses.  For example, here we describe a 5-somite stage, and next a 14-somite stage, but a particular study might use eight stages in between (6-somite, 7-somite, and so on), and one will immediately understand their meaning.  We emphasize that we do not mean to exclude these extra stages, wherever they are in the series, by ignoring them.<p>
	As an aid to communicating a broader perspective towards development, we group the stages into larger time-blocks called periods <A HREF="figs/table1.html">(Table 1)</A>, and summarize in the text the principal events during these periods.  Specialized terms are defined in the glossary, and <b>bold-face type</b> in the text highlights terms important for staging.  <A HREF="figs/table2.html">Table 2</A> collects brief descriptions of all the stages, and <A HREF="figs/fig1.html">Fig. 1</A> shows corresponding sketches.  One can use these two sources to locate approximately a stage of interest, and then find additional detail as necessary in the text and other figures.

<H3>PROCEDURES</H3><b><p>
Staging	</b><p>
One can determine the approximate developmental stage of a living embryo by examining it with a dissecting stereo-microscope, generally with transmitted (not epi- or incident) illumination and high magnification (about 50x).  During the segmentation period the tail elongates, and if the embryo is left within its chorion, the tail eventually curves over the trunk and head so as to obscure the view.  When this has happened, one must remove the embryo from its chorion to stage it, either manually with #5 watchmaker's forceps, or by treatment with a proteolytic enzyme (Westerfield, 1994).  Late in the pharyngula period the embryo, if removed from the chorion, swims away in response to touch; this can prevented by anesthesia in 0.003% tricaine (3-amino benzoic acid ethyl ester; Sigma Chemical Co.) at pH 7 (Westerfield, 1994).  Repeated anesthesia and rinsing appears to slightly but significantly retard subsequent development (see legend to Fig. 2).<b><p>
Nomarski Optics	</b><p>
A compound microscope equipped with Nomarski diffential interference contrast optics and objectives in the range of 25x to 40x reveals details otherwise not visible in the live preparation, and permits the most critical staging.  For instance, Nomarski optics permits the most accurate counts of cells in the blastula and of somites during segmentation.  Moreover, 'prim' stages refer to the position of a structure, the <i>prim</i>ordium of the posterior lateral line, that one must use Nomarski optics to see for the sharpest determination of stages during much of the pharyngula period.  The embryo is anesthetised, removed from the chorion, and mounted between bridged coverslips (Westerfield, 1994), for observation and later recovery. 	<p>
It is always better to stage embryos while they are alive rather than after killing and fixation.  For example, staging during the straightening and hatching periods calls for a comparison of sizes of the head and the yolk mass, and differential shrinkage during fixation distorts the normal relationship.  Nevertheless, if preservation is good enough, one can fairly reliably stage fixed and whole-mounted embryos (e.g. immunolabeled ones) using other criteria.  One cannot easily stage an embryo after it is sectioned.<b><p>
Photographs	</b><p>
The accompanying photographs are of living embryos, anesthetized for the later stages.  The original photographs were made as color slides (Kodak Ektachrome 160T DX), and the black and whites plates are reproduced from internegatives.  Sets of copies of the original color slides are available at cost from the authors.  The lower magnification views, showing the entire embryo, were made using a Zeiss STEMI stereo dissecting microscope: The embryo is mounted on a depression slide, without an overlying coverslip, in standard embryo medium (Westerfield, 1994) containing 1.5% -3% methyl cellulose to allow positioning as desired.  The higher magnification views, showing parts of embryos, were taken with Nomarski optics (generally a Zeiss 40x water-immersion objective) using a Zeiss UEM compound microscope.  The embryo was mounted between coverslips, sometimes in 1% agar, for positioning.

<Title>Temperature</title>
<b>TEMPERATURE AND STANDARD DEVELOPMENTAL TIME</b>	<p>
We convert staging information to 'standard developmental time', as designated by the letter 'h', and defined as normalized <i>h</i>ours after fertilization at 28.5C, an optimal temperature of incubation (G. Streisinger, unpublished experiments).  Incubation at another temperature will change developmental rate, as may be useful in particular studies, e.g to bring embryos to two different stages at the same time for heterochronic transplantation.  Comparisons of embryos raised at different temperatures should be made with caution, because there is no assurance that all features of the embryo coordinately change their rates of development when the temperature is changed.  Nevertheless, embryos appear to develop normally if they are kept within a range of about 8C, between 25C (perhaps a few degrees lower; see Shiorone and Gross, 1968) and 33C.  Incubating them for long periods above or below these extremes may produce abnormalities.  <A HREF="figs/fig2.html">Figure 2</A> shows the rates of development at the extremes, and the legend to this figure provides a simple formula permitting one to estimate when an embryo developing at any temperature within this range will reach a given stage.

<Title>Zygote Period</title>
<H3>ZYGOTE PERIOD (0-3/4 h)</H3>
	<p>
The newly fertilized egg is in the zygote period until the first cleavage  occurs <A HREF="figs/fig3.html">(Fig. 3)</A>, about 40 minutes after fertilization.  The zygote is about 0.7 mm in diameter at the time of fertilization.  We include only a single stage, however many changes are occurring, and one could easily subdivide the period (see Hisoaka &amp; Battle, 1958).
<p>
<b>Stages During the Zygote Period<p>

1-cell stage (0 h):</b>  The chorion swells and lifts away from the newly fertilized egg <A HREF="figs/fig3.html">(Fig. 3A)</A>.  Fertilization also activates cytoplasmic movements, easily evident within about 10 minutes.  Non-yolky cytoplasm begins to stream towards the animal pole, segregating the blastodisc from the clearer yolk granule-rich vegetal cytoplasm <A HREF="figs/fig3.html">(Fig. 3B)</A>.  This segregation continues during early cleavage stages.

<Title>Cleavage Period</title>
<H3>CLEAVAGE PERIOD (0.7- 2.2 h)</H3><p>
	<p>
After the first cleavage the cells, or blastomeres, divide at about 15 minute intervals (<A HREF="figs/fig4.html">Fig. 4</A>, <A HREF="figs/fig5.html">Fig. 5</A>).  The cytoplasmic divisions are meroblastic; they only incompletely undercut the blastodisc, and the blastomeres, or a specific subset of them according to the stage (Kimmel and Law, 1985a), remain interconnected by cytoplasmic bridges.  The six cleavages that comprise this period frequently occur at regular orientations (<A HREF="figs/fig6.html">Fig. 6</A>, <A HREF="figs/fig7.html">Fig. 7</A>) so that one can see how many blastomeres are present are by their arrangement; counting them is unneccessary.
<p>
One can be quite accurate about staging during this period, as well as the early part of the next one, by using Nomarski optics to subdivide each cell cycle.  All the cells of the blastodisc procede through their cell cycles synchronously, or nearly so.  Nuclei are present and visible during about the first half of each cycle, i.e., during interphase, and the nuclear shapes change systematically (see below, <A HREF="figs/fig10.html">Fig. 10</A>).  The nuclei are globular during very early interphase, become spherical by late interphase, and then, as the cells enter mitosis, their nuclei take on an ellipsoidal shape shortly before disappearing during prophase.  The long axis of the ellipsoid predicts the orientation of the following cleavage.  Mitotic chromosomes, present during the other half of the cleavage cell cycle, are more difficult to visualize.  Near the end of mitosis, and heralding the cytoplasmic division, the blastomeres become more rounded in shape.<P>

<Title>Cleavage Stages</title>
<H3>Stages During the Cleavage Period</H3>	<b><p>
2-cell stage (3/4 h)</b>:  The first cleavage furrow, ending the first zygotic cell cycle, is vertically oriented, as is usual until the 32-cell stage.  The furrow arises near the animal pole and progresses rapidly towards the vegetal pole, passing through only the blastodisc and not the yolky region of the egg <A HREF="figs/fig4.html">(Fig. 4A)</A>.  Near the bottom of the blastodisc the furrow changes to a horizontal orientation to undercut the blastodisc in the fashion described originally by Wilson (1889) for the sea bass, but still leaves the cells only partly cleaved from the underlying yolky region.  The two blastomeres are of equal size and appear otherwise undistinguished from one another.  	<p>
The following several cleavages are strictly oriented relative to the first one.  However, the eventual axes of body symmetry (i.e. the dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior axes) apparently cannot be predicted with any certainty from the orientation of the cleavage (Kimmel and Warga, 1987, Abdelilah et al., 1994, Helde et al., 1994), despite some reports to the contrary (Strehlow and Gilbert, 1993; Strehlow et al., 1994).<b>	<p>
4-cell stage (1 h):</b>  The two blastomeres cleave incompletely  <A HREF="figs/fig4.html">(Fig. 4B)</A> and in a single plane that passes through the animal pole at right angles to the plane of the first cleavage.  Hence, cycle 3 begins with 4 blastomeres in a 2x2 array.  A view from the animal pole ("animal polar view", cartooned in <A HREF="figs/fig6.html">Fig. 6</A>) reveals that the blastodisc is ellipsoidal in shape.  The second cleavage plane is oriented along the longer axis.<b>	<p>
8-cell stage (1 1/4 h):</b>  Cleavages ending cycle 3, still incomplete, occur in two separate planes, parallel to the first one, and on either side of it.  They cut the blastodisc into a 2x4 array of blastomeres.  As the dechorionated embryo usually lies in a dish, the 4-cell aspect, rather than the 2-cell aspect, faces the observer.  This "face" view (Kimmel and Law, 1985a) is along the odd numbered cleavage planes (furrows 1 and 3 are visible; <A HREF="figs/fig7.html">Fig. 7</A>).  The dechorionated embryo tends to lie in the same orientation through late blastula stages and this view is the one shown in the first part of <A HREF="figs/fig1.html">Fig. 1</A> (through the high stage), <A HREF="figs/fig4.html">Fig. 4</A> (except for Fig. 4B), and <A HREF="figs/fig7.html">Fig. 7</A>.  <b>	<p>
16-cell stage (1 1/2 h):</b>  The fourth set of cleavages also occur along two planes, parallel to and on either side of the second one, and produces a 4x4 array of cells.  Use care to distinguish this stage from the 8-cell stage, because they look similar in face view (<A HREF="figs/fig4.html">Fig. 4C, D</A>).	<p>
For the first time some of the cells now become completely cleaved from the others.  These 'complete' cells are the 4 most central blastomeres, the quartet that is entirely surrounded by other cells in <A HREF="figs/fig6.html">Fig. 6E</A>.  Their complete cleavage occurs near the end of the 16-cell stage because of the way the cleavage furrows undercut the blastodisc from the center, going outwards towards the blastodisc margin.  Indeed, the undercutting furrows still do not reach the margin, and the 12 cells surrounding these 4 central ones, the so-called marginal blastomeres, remain connected to the yolk cell by cytoplasmic bridges (Kimmel and Law, 1985a).  From this stage onwards until the midblastula period the cleavages completely partition most or all of the nonmarginal blastomeres, but still incompletely partition the marginal ones.<b>	<p>
32-cell stage (1 3/4 h):</b>  The cleavages ending cycle 5 often occur along four parallel planes, rather than two, lying between those of the first and third cycles.  However, oblique orientations of the furrows are now common.  Frequently the 32 blastomeres of this stage are present in a 4x8 array, but other regular patterns, as well as irregular ones involving one or more of the blastomeres also occur (Kimmel and Law, 1985b).  In a side view one usually sees two <b>tiers</b>, or horizontal rows, of blastomeres between the margin and the animal pole (<A HREF="figs/fig4.html">Fig. 4E</A> and <A HREF="figs/fig7.html">Fig. 7</A>).  This is because the plane of the blastodisc is curved; marginal cells are more vegetal, and they lie partly in front of the nonmarginal ones positioned closer to the animal pole.<b>	<p>
64-cell stage (2 h):</b>  Cleavages ending the sixth cycle pass horizontally, so that in an animal polar view the blastomere array may look similar to the 32-cell stage, although the cells entering cycle 7 are smaller.  From the side the cell mound looks distinctly higher (<A HREF="figs/fig1.html">Fig. 1</A>, <A HREF="figs/fig4.html">Fig. 4F</A>, and <A HREF="figs/fig7.html">Fig. 7</A>).  For the first time some of the blastomeres completely cover other ones.  The buried cells, or deep cells, each arise as one of the two daughters of the 4 central blastomeres that were present at the 32-cell stage.  The other daughter remains superficial, in the top-most tier of what is now the enveloping layer (EVL) of the blastodisc.  During the same cleavage the horizontal divisions of marginal blastomeres present at cycle 6 produce two EVL sister cells, and in a face view of the 64-cell stage one sees three tiers of EVL cells (<A HREF="figs/fig7.html">Fig. 7</A>).

<Title>Blastula Period Description</title>
<H3>BLASTULA PERIOD (2 1/4 - 5 1/4 h)</H3>
	<p>
We use the term blastula to refer to the period when the blastodisc begins to look ball-like, at the 128-cell stage, or 8th zygotic cell cycle, and until the time of onset of gastrulation, ca. cycle 14.  Important processes occur during this blastula period; the embryo enters midblastula transition (MBT), the yolk syncytial layer (YSL) forms, and epiboly begins.  Epiboly continues during the gastrulation period.  	<p>
"Stereoblastula" would be more a appropriate term than blastula to describe the period, for it means no blastocoele is present, which is the case <A HREF="figs/fig8.html">(Fig. 8)</A>.  Only small irregular extracellular spaces exist between the deep cells of the blastodisc.  The orientation of the cleavage planes is indeterminate, and they are much less regularly arranged than they were during the cleavage period.  The daughter cells from these later cleavages slip out of what have been rather neat rows, in either side or top views, so that blastomere size is more useful than blastomere position in determining the stage during this period. The blastodisc looks slightly ellipsoidal in animal polar view (particularly during the early part of the period).  		<p>
Early on, the cells of the blastula continue to divide synchronously, at the same rhythm as before (<A HREF="figs/fig5.html">Fig. 5</A> and <A HREF="figs/fig9.html">Fig. 9</A>).  More accurately, the cleavages during the early blastula period are "metasynchronous" because the mitoses do not all occur at quite the same time.  Instead, a wave crosses the blastodisc at the end of each cell cycle.  Cells near the animal pole enter the wave first, and the marginal cells enter the wave last.  Generally the wave passes through the blastodisc obliquely, such that, from a face view, one can observe the wave pass across the field of cells along the long axis of the blastoderm, as it also passes from the animal pole to the margin. 	<p>
Cell cycle lengthening marks the onset of the midblastula transition (MBT; Kane and Kimmel, 1993; <A HREF="figs/fig9.html">Fig. 9A</A>).  Not all of the cycles begin to lengthen synchronously or to the same extent <A HREF="figs/fig9.html">(Fig. 9B)</A>, and at any time point after MBT some cells are in interphase, and have nuclei easily visualized with Nomarski optics <A HREF="figs/fig10.html">(Figs. 10A, D)</A>, while other cells are in mitosis (and have no nuclei; <A HREF="figs/fig10.html">Figs. 10C, E</A>): asynchrony among the blastomeres is thus immediately apparent from the morphology. The MBT begins during the tenth cell cycle (512-cell stage), two cycles earlier than in <i>Xenopus</i> (Newport and Kirshner, 1982a; 1982b), but otherwise the essentials of the MBT, its features and how its onset is controlled,  appear the same in the two species (Kane and Kimmel, 1993).  As interphases lengthen, cells become motile, and RNA synthesis increases over background levels.		<p>
Time lapse analysis reveals that after the onset of the MBT the deep cells are motile during their longer interphases (Kane and Kimmel, 1993).  The deep cell movements appear to be unoriented, at least as seen from the surface.  	<p>
The marginal tier of blastomeres in the early blastula have a unique fate.  They lie against the yolk cell and remain cytoplasmically connected to it throughout cleavage.  Beginning during cycle 10 (Kimmel and Law, 1985b), the marginal cells undergo a collapse, releasing their cytoplasm and nuclei together into the immediately adjoining cytoplasm of the yolk cell.  Thus arises the <b>yolk syncytial layer (YSL)</b> a feature prominent with Nomarski optics, and important for staging <A HREF="figs/fig10.html">(Fig. 10)</A>.  After the YSL forms, the EVL cells that were in the second blastodisc tier now lie at the marginal position.  They look like their former neighbors did, but with the important difference that these new marginal blastomeres are nonsyncytial:  For the first time, none of the blastomeres have cytoplasmic bridges to other cells, except those present for a short time between newly divided sibling-cell pairs.	<p>
Although the YSL forms just at the time of the MBT, the regulatory control of these two events appears to be distinct; MBT alone depends on the nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio (Kane, 1991).  The YSL nuclei continue to undergo mitotic divisions in the midblastula, but the nuclear divisions are unaccompanied by cytoplasmic ones, and the yolk cell remains uncleaved and syncytial.  As in the blastodisc , the YSL division cycles lengthen during the midblastula period, but not as much, and the YSL nuclei continue to divide metasynchronously, not asynchronously.  After about three cycles, and coinciding with the beginning of epiboly, the YSL divisions abruptly cease (Kane et al., 1992; see also Trinkaus, 1992).  The YSL nuclei now begin to enlarge; possibly meaning that they are actively transcribing RNA.	<p>
The YSL, an organ unique to teleosts, may be extraembryonic, making no direct contribution to the body of the embryo.  At first the YSL has the form of a narrow ring around the blastodisc edge <A HREF="figs/fig10.html">(Fig. 10)</A>, but soon (within two division cycles) it spreads underneath the blastodisc, forming a complete "internal" syncytium (the I-YSL), that persists throughout embryogenesis.  In this position, between the embryonic cells and their yolk stores, the I-YSL might be presumed to be playing a nutritive role.  Another portion of it, the E-YSL, is transiently "external" to the blastodisc edge during epiboly.  Indeed, work with the teleost <i>Fundulus</i> shows that this region, the E-YSL, appears to be a major motor for epiboly (Trinkaus, 1984).
	<b><p>
Epiboly</b>, beginning in the late blastula (Solnica-Krezel and Driever, 1994), is the thinning and spreading of both the YSL and the blastodisc over the yolk cell, as you might model by pulling a knitted ski cap over your head.  Eventually, at the end of the gastrula period, the yolk cell becomes engulfed completely.  During the early stages of this morphogenetic movement the blastodisc thins considerably, changing from a high-piled cell mound <A HREF="figs/fig8.html">(Fig. 8B)</A> to a cup-shaped cell multilayer of nearly uniform thickness <A HREF="figs/fig8.html">(Fig. 8F)</A>.  This is accomplished by the streaming outwards, towards the surface, of the deepest blastomeres.  As they move, they mix fairly indiscriminately among more superficial cells along their way (Wilson et al<i>.</i>,1993).  Active cell repacking by these so-called "radial intercalations" (Keller, 1980) may be a part of the driving force of early epiboly.  The intercalations do not drive deep cells into the EVL, which remains a compartmentalized monolayer (Kimmel et al., 1990b).  Additionally, deep blastomeres at the margin mix together to a considerably lesser extent than do the central ones (Helde et al., 1994), where, as can be seen from <A HREF="figs/fig8.html">Fig. 8</A>, the pile is much thicker before epiboly begins.  This relative lack of mixing among marginal blastomeres may have significance with respect to how pattern is established during early development.  This is because the mesoderm will arise from these nonmixing marginal deep cells (see the fate map below, <A HREF="figs/fig14.html">Fig. 14</A>).  Presuming that events specifying mesoderm begin to occur before epiboly, as they seem to do in <i>Xenopus</i>, then lack of mixing in the marginal deep cell population during epiboly could be important to maintain regions with different cellular "specifications" (Kimmel et al., 1991) or  identities.<p>
 	The yolk cell prominently changes shape at the same time that the radial intercalations occur.  The I-YSL surface bulges or "domes" towards the animal pole, this change in shape being the clearest sign that epiboly is beginning (Fig. 8E), and serving to substantially increase the area of contact between the I-YSL and the blastodisc's inner surface.  As the yolk cell domes, it occupies territory simultaneously vacated by the deep blastomeres during their radial intercalations; yolk cell doming could exert force that drives the deep cells outwards.  Whatever its cause, epiboly clearly involves the blastodisc and yolk cell alike, and begins quite rapidly.  As epiboly continues during the next several hours, the E-YSL continues to advance across the yolk ahead of the cells that are riding upon it.  In <i>Fundulus</i>, at least, desmosomes serve to attach the E-YSL to the EVL margin (Betchaku and Trinkaus, 1978), and the spreading YSL appears to pull the EVL along behind it.	<p>
Epiboly appears to depend on functional microtubules (Str&auml;hle and Jesuthasan, 1993) and might be under control of early-acting zygotic genes (Kane, 1991). The earliest-expressed genes identified so far code for regionally localized putative transcription factors, and begin expression in the late blastula (e.g. the gene <i>no tail</i>, Schulte-Merker et al., 1992; <i>goosecoid</i>, Stachel et al., 1993; <i>snail1</i>, Thisse et al., 1993). 	<p>
 Changes also occur in the EVL during the blastula period.  At the end of the cleavage period there are more EVL cells than deep cells, but with successive divisions the EVL cells become vastly outnumbered.  The EVL flattens, its cells thinning and stretching markedly to eventually form a tightly sealed (Bennett and Trinkaus, 1970) epithelial monolayer that becomes increasingly difficult to see.  By the late blastula period, EVL cell cycles are longer and less synchronous than deep cell cycles (Kane et al., 1992).  At the same time the EVL cells become lineage-restricted; their cell divisions generate daughters that are always within the EVL (Kimmel et al., 1990b).  However, their developmental potential does not seem to be restricted during the late blastula period; if they are transplanted singly among the deep cells, their descendants acquire new fates (Ho, 1992a).<p>

<Title>Blastula Stages</title>
<H3>Stages During the Blastula Period	</H3>
<b>128-cell stage (2 1/4 h):</b>  The eighth cycle begins with 128 blastomeres arranged as a high mound of cells, a solid half ball perched on the yolk cell.  In contrast to earlier cleavages, the cleavage furrows that bring the 64-cell stage to an end generally occur so irregularly that with few exceptions one cannot after this time deduce a blastomere's cellular ancestry from its position.  One can, however, distinguish whether a view from the side corresponds to a view along the earlier odd numbered cleavage planes (the face view, described above) or the even numbered ones because of the oblong shape of the blastodisc, which remains as described for the 4-cell stage.  As seen from a face view, the EVL cells line up in about five irregular tiers between the animal pole and the margin. <b>	<p>
256-cell stage (2 1/2 h):</b>  A face view <A HREF="figs/fig8.html">(Fig. 8A)</A> at the end of the eighth set of cleavages reveals the EVL cells in about seven irregular tiers.  The EVL cells thin out considerably during the interphase of this ninth cycle.  The deep cells substantially outnumber those of the EVL.  The ninth cleavage divisions are the last highly synchronous, or metasynchronous, ones to occur. 	<b><p>
512-cell stage (2 3/4 h):</b>   Here begins midblastula transition; cell cycles lengthen gradually during the next several divisions <A HREF="figs/fig9.html">(Fig. 9A)</A>.  In face view, about nine somewhat irregular tiers of EVL blastomeres occur between the margin and animal pole.   During the last part of this stage and particularly as they enter the tenth mitosis, the marginal blastomeres (the first-tier EVL cells) begin to lose their lower borders where they join the yolk cell <A HREF="figs/fig10.html">(Fig. 10A, B)</A>.  This morphogenetic change signals the beginning of formation of the YSL; the marginal cells specifically do not undergo cytokinesis following the tenth mitosis.  This mitosis occurs with enough synchrony that one can still find a minute or so of time when all cells, including the yolk cell, are in mitosis (i.e., the cells have no interphase nuclei; <A HREF="figs/fig10.html">Fig. 10C)</A>.  The 512-cell stage is the last cycle when this is possible.<b>		<p>
1k-cell stage (3 h):  </b>One can usually, but not always, see a YSL <A HREF="figs/fig10.html">(Fig. 10D)</A>, irregular in form and containing a total of about 20 nuclei within a single ring around the blastodisc margin.  There are fewer than 1024 blastomeres after division 10 because the first-tier (marginal) EVL cells from the previous stage joined together in the YSL.  Moreover, because of the manner of YSL formation, the cells making up the first EVL tier at this stage are descendants of those that were in the second tier a stage earlier.  	<p>
In some embryos, the YSL forms over the course of two cycles, sometimes beginning a stage earlier and other times a stage later than the 1-k stage.  	<p>
About eleven tiers of cells occupy the EVL.  The eleventh set of mitoses occurs as a discernable wave passing through the blastodisc, and is the last one to do so.  During this wave, for the first time, many of the cells can be seen to be out of phase with their neighbors; some have and some don't have interphase nuclei. 	<b><p>
High stage (3 1/3 h)</b>:  This stage marks the end of the period during which the blastodisc perches "high" upon the yolk cell <A HREF="figs/fig8.html">(Figs. 8B, C)</A>.  There is still a pinched ring, a constriction, where the marginal cells meet the YSL.  One distinguishes the high stage from earlier ones by the appearance and numbers of both blastodisc cells and YSL nuclei.  In side view there are substantially more than 11 tiers of EVL cells visible between the margin and the animal pole.  In any region of the blastodisc throughout this whole stage there are some cells in interphase and others in mitosis.  Most blastodisc cells complete zygotic cell cycle 12 whereas a few complete cycle 13 during this stage.  	<p>
The YSL still has the form of a thin ring, but its outer edge, i.e. the edge away from the blastodisc, is now much smoother in contour.  The YSL nuclei reappear from their second division without cytokinesis (their eleventh zygotic division) generally all still external to the blastodisc margin, and more tightly packed together <A HREF="figs/fig10.html">(Fig 10F)</A>.    	<b><p>
Oblong stage (3 2/3 h):</b>  The animal-vegetal axis of the blastula shortens, with the blastodisc compressing down upon the yolk cell, as one could imagine to result from a uniform increase in tension at  the surface.  The constriction at the blastodisc margin that has been present since the elevation of non-yolky cytoplasm during the 1-cell stage diminishes <A HREF="figs/fig8.html">(Fig. 8C)</A> and then disappears.  Eventually the blastula acquires a smoothly outlined ellipsoidal shape, as viewed from the side, and the stage is named for this oblong shape.  The blastomeres are dividing highly asynchronously, many of them being in cycle 12 or 13.  The EVL is by now extremely thin, and careful observation with Nomarski is needed to detect its presence.  	<p>
The YSL is spreading deep underneath the blastodisc, and spreading away from it as well.  During their interphases the YSL nuclei form several rows, some nuclei invariably in the I-YSL.	<b><p>
Sphere stage (4 h)</b>:  Continued shortening along the animal-vegetal axis generates a late blastula of smooth and approximately spherical shape.  The overall shape then changes little the next several hours, well into the period of gastrulation, but cell rearrangements that begin now seem to occur more rapidly than at any other time in development.  One distinguishes this stage from the dome stage that comes next by the appearance, at a very deep plane of focus, of the face between the lower part of the blastodisc and the upper part of the yolk cell, the I-YSL.  At sphere stage specifically this interface is flat, or nearly flat <A HREF="figs/fig8.html">(Fig. 8D)</A>.  	<p>
Many of the cells of the blastodisc are in cycle 13, and in the EVL this cycle is often extremely long, such that mitoses occur very rarely in the EVL.  The E-YSL is often noticeably thinner than earlier, and most YSL nuclei are internal. The last of the YSL nuclear divisions occur.  Frequently, dechorionated embryos begin to be oriented animal pole-upwards, rather than lying on their sides as earlier.<b>	<p>
Dome stage (4 1/3 h)</b>:  Deep to the blastodisc the I-YSL surface begins to dome towards the animal pole <A HREF="figs/fig8.html">(Fig. 8E)</A>.  This prominent and rapidly occurring change in the interface between the yolk cell and the blastodisc represents the first sure sign that epiboly is beginning.  EVL cells are in a long cycle 13 and many deep cells enter cycle 14.    The E-YSL begins to narrow  (Solnica-Krezel and Driever, 1994).  The YSL nuclei are postmitotic; i.e., in contrast to when they were in mitotic cycles just preceding dome stage, the nuclei are now always visible.  They begin to enlarge, and one can see them quite easily.<b>	<p>
30%-epiboly stage (4 2/3 h)</b>:  Epiboly, including doming of the yolk cell, produces a <b>blastoderm</b>, as we may now call it, of nearly uniform thickness <A HREF="figs/fig8.html">(Fig. 8F)</A>.  It now consists of a highly flattened EVL monolayer (hard to see except by focusing exactly in the plane of the blastoderm surface with Nomarski optics), and a deep cell multilayer (DEL) about 4 cells thick.  	<p>
The extent to which the blastoderm has spread over across the yolk cell provides an extremely useful staging index from this stage until epiboly ends.  We define <b>percent-epiboly</b> to mean the fraction of the yolk cell that the blastoderm covers;  percent-coverage would be a more precise term for what we mean to say, but percent-epiboly immediately focuses on the process and is in common usage.  Hence, at 30%-epiboly the blastoderm margin is at 30% of the entire distance between the animal and vegetal poles, as one estimates along the animal-vegetal axis.  	<p>
The blastoderm thickness is not exactly uniform in many embryos at this stage.  Observing the marginal region from a side view, as the blastula is rotated about the animal-vegetal axis will reveal one region along the margin that is noticeably thinner and flatter than elsewhere.  This particular region will become the dorsal side of the embryo (Schmitz and Campos-Ortega, 1994).  We observe the asymmetry most easily using low-mahtmlication Nomarski optics.  To distinguish the dorsal side with absolute confidence, however, one needs to await shield stage (6 h).

</head><body><TITLE>Gastrula Period</TITLE>
<H3>GASTRULA PERIOD (5 1/4 - 10 h)</H3>	<p>
Epiboly continues, and in addition, the morphogenetic cell movements of involution, convergence, and extension occur, producing the primary germ layers and the embryonic axis. 	<p>
The beginning of involution defines the onset of gastrulation, and, so far as we have been able to tell, this occurs at 50%-epiboly (<A HREF="figs/fig11.html">Fig. 11A)</A>.  As a consequence, within minutes of reaching 50%-epiboly a thickened marginal region termed the <b>germ ring</b> appears, nearly simultaneously all around the the blastoderm rim (<A HREF="figs/fig11.html">Fig. 11B, arrow in C</A>).  Convergence movements then, nearly as rapidly, produce a local accumulation of cells at one position along the germ ring, the so-called <b>embryonic shield </b>(<A HREF="figs/fig11.html">Fig. 11D, arrow in E</A>).  During these events, epiboly temporarily arrests, but after the shield forms, epiboly continues; the margin of the blastoderm advances around the yolk cell to cover it completely (<A HREF="figs/fig11.html">Fig. 11F-L</A>).  The advance occurs at a nearly constant rate, over an additional 15% of the yolk cell each hour, and providing a useful staging index during most of gastrulation <A HREF="figs/fig12.html">(Fig. 12)</A>.
<p>
Just as there was no blastocoele during the blastula period, there is no archenteron in the gastrula.  Neither is there a blastopore; DEL cells involute at the blastoderm margin, which thus plays the role of a blastopore.  Involution produces the germ ring by folding the blastoderm back upon itself.  Hence, within the germ ring there are two germ layers, the upper, the epiblast, continues to feed cells into the lower, the hypoblast, throughout gastrulation.  Note that these terms, epiblast and hypoblast, are also used to describe layers of the avian embryonic blastoderm, but the layers so-named seem to be altogether different in these two kinds of vertebrate embryos.	<p>
As a morphogenetic movement, involution at the blastoderm margin seems particularly well documented for the rosy barb (Wood and Timmermans, 1988), a small teleost that develops in many ways very similarly to the zebrafish.  However, recently J. P. Trinkaus has obtained evidence (unpublished) that in <i>Fundulus</i>, a somewhat larger embryo, involution may not occur at all; rather, cells near but usually not just at the margin move from shallow to deeper positions as individuals, rather than in a rolling cell layer.  This movement, termed ingression, could also happen in zebrafish (J. Shih and S. E. Fraser, unpublished observations), an issue for further study by high-resolution time-lapse analysis of whole cell fields of the sort done by Wood and Timmermans.	<p>
As a consequence of the inward movement, a fissure, Brachet's cleft (Ballard, 1980), becomes visible with Nomarski optics <A HREF="figs/fig13.html">(Fig. 13)</A>, or in sectioned material, between the epiblast and hypoblast.  We point out the location of the cleft in the drawing of the 75%-epiboly stage in <A HREF="figs/fig1.html">Fig. 1</A>, although one cannot always locate it easily with the dissecting microscope (compare <A HREF="figs/fig11.html">Fig. 11</A> and <A HREF="figs/fig11.html">Fig. 13</A>).  Cells may not normally mix between the epiblast and hypoblast across Brachet's cleft (although they are able to so mix an experimental situation; see below).  Cells in the two layers are streaming in different directions.  Except for the dorsal region (see below), the epiblast cells, generally stream towards the margin, and those reaching the margin move inwards to enter the hypoblast.  Then, as hypoblast cells, they stream away from the margin (Warga and Kimmel, 1990).   The cells remaining in the epiblast when gastrulation ends correspond to the definitive ectoderm and will give rise to such tissues as epidermis, the  central nervous system, neural crest, and sensory placodes.  The hypoblast gives rise to derivatives classically ascribed to both the mesoderm and endoderm; Thisse et al<i>.</i> (1993) call the same layer "mesendoderm".  Both names emphasize the absense of three separate germ layers at any stage during the gastrula period, only two are present.  The hypoblast is only about one or two cells thick around most of the circumference of the embryo <A HREF="figs/fig13.html">(Fig. 13)</A>, and it  is presently unknown how this layer subdivides into endoderm and mesoderm. 		
<p>
In the manner of lineage restrictions to the EVL that occurred at sphere stage at 4h, about an hour later many but not all DEL cells become lineage-restricted to one or another tissue or organ-specific fate.  The restriction occurs about the time gastrulation begins (Kimmel and Warga, 1986; Kimmel et al., 1990b, 1994), and as for the earlier EVL restriction, this restriction of DEL cells in the early gastrula seems unaccompanied by cell commitment (Ho and Kimmel, 1993):  If DEL cells are transplanted, as single cells, from the marginal region that normally generates mesodermal or endodermal fates, to the animal pole region that normally forms ectodermal fates, they plastically regulate both their morphogenetic movements and their eventual fates; appearing indistinguishable from their new neighbors in both respects.  The ability to developmentally regulate may involve dynamic regulation of the activities of zygotically expressed patterning genes:  Marginal cells specifically express the gene <i>no tail (ntl)</i>, the homologue of mouse <i>T/Brachyury,</i> that codes a nuclear protein  (Schulte-Merker et al., 1992) essential for normal notochord development (Halpern et al., 1993; Schulte-Merker et al., 1994).  Cells transplanted from the margin to the animal pole rapidly turn off <i>ntl</i> transcription, and cells transplanted in the opposite direction just as rapidly turn it on (Schulte-Merker et al., 1992).  However, by the middle of gastrulation the ability of the cells to regulate so plastically seems to be lost, because single cells transplanted from the hypoblast to epiblast at this stage will rapidly leave their new positions, re-enter the hypoblast, and develop a hypoblast-derived fate appropriate for just where they end up.  To exhibit this behavior, the transplanted cells have to cross Brachet's cleft, and time-lapse analysis reveals that they accomplish this unusual relocation apparently without impediment (Ho and Kimmel, 1993).	<p>
 An organ- and tissue-level fate map is available for the onset of gastrulation <A HREF="figs/fig14.html">(Fig. 14)</A>.  The map is made by injecting single cells with lineage-tracer dye, and later ascertaining in what region of what organ the labeled descendants of the injected cell lie, and generally what differentiated type or types they have formed, as determined from the cell shapes, sizes, and positions.  Topologically the fate map is broadly equivalent to fate maps of other chordates, notably amphibians (Keller, 1975; 1976; Dale and Slack, 1987), and also birds (Hatada and Stern, 1994) and mammals (Lawson et al., 1991).  Within the DEL, primary germ layers are mapped according to latitude (position relative to the animal pole and the margin), and tissue rudiments can be located with reference to both cell latitude and longitude (the position relative to the dorsal midline).  Another notable feature, not apparent in the figure, is that position along the dorsal-ventral (DV) axis of the gastrula generally corresponds to later position along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of the pharyngula.  This is the case for all three germ layers; eventual AP cell positions in the spinal cord (ectoderm), muscle (mesoderm) and gut wall (endoderm) all correlate with DV cell position in the early gastrula.  Morphogenesis to make this DV-AP transform is complicated and largely not understood.  Consider the neurectodermal fate map:  We see complexity in that not only do the more anterior neural fates map to the dorsal side of the gastrula, but also the more the<i>ventral</i> cell types of the neural tube, the motoneurons and floor plate, map to the same region -- the dorsal side of the gastrula (Kimmel et al., 1990b).  We discuss later how dorsal cells in the gastrula eventually become ventral cells in the neural tube, but just how dorsal versus anterior fates sort out in this region of the fate map is simply unknown.  Scattering of clonally related cells  (and hence positionally related cells) during morphogenesis during and after gastrulation generally precludes very fine-grained mapping, but this is not always the case.  For example, Stanier et al. (1993) have shown that single late blastula cells contribute projeny to either the heart's atrium or ventricle but not do not scatter such that a single clone encompasses both chambers.  		<p>

EVL cells neither divide (Kimmel et al., 1994) nor involute, nor do they appear to converge, at least very much, during gastrulation.  They continue to flatten, and they relocate by epiboly towards the vegetal pole.  Irrespective of their early positions, the EVL cells differentiate directly as periderm, an extremely flattened protective outer single-cell layer covering the entire embryo.  The position of an EVL cell in the early gastrula fairly reliably predicts just where in the periderm of a later embryo a descendent clone will be located, which is useful for certain cell lineage and fate map analyses (Kimmel et al., 1990b).	<p>
Near the time that involution begins, other DEL cell movements and rearrangements occur both within the epiblast and hypoblast.  During convergence, cells stream from all sectors of the blastoderm towards the dorsal side.  Intercalations repack the cells in both layers.  In the late blastula the intercalations were radial, and accompanied blastoderm thinning (epiboly).  The new intercalations are mediolateral (Keller and Tibbetts, 1989); they effect convergent extension, a narrowing and elongation of the primary embryonic axis.  As gastrulation proceeds the cells undergo many such directional intercalations, such that single labeled clones descended from marked blastula founders become markedly spread apart.  They form into long discontinuous strings of cells, oriented longitudinally (Warga and Kimmel, 1990b; Kimmel et al., 1994).	<p>
Formation of the embryonic shield visibly indicates that rapid convergence movements have begun.  The shield is an accumulation and condensation of DEL cells along a local stretch of about 30 degrees of longitude of the germ ring, and marks the future dorsal side of the embryo.  Hence, when the shield forms one can reliably distinguish the orientation of the embryo's eventual DV axis.  Cells involuting at the shield form the so-called "axial" hypoblast.  Expression of the gene <i>goosecoid</i> is a reliable marker of where the shield will form, and appears to label the earliest cells to involute in the axial hypoblast (Stachel et al., 1993).  These first cells, expressing <i>goosecoid</i>, stream anteriorwards, and appear to correspond to precursors of the tetrapod prechordal plate.  A principal derivative of the prechordal plate is the hatching gland, and the endodermal lining of the pharynx comes from the same region.  <A HREF="figs/fig14.html">Figure 14</A> does not show these fates; they lie at the margin just beneath the notochord region.  Cells of the notochord rudiment, the chorda mesoderm, then begin to involute at the dorsal midline only shortly after these earliest prospective prechordal plate cells, as the embryonic shield becomes more easily visible.  	<p>
Convergence and extension, involving cell mixing, and anteriorwards cell migration is extreme within the embryonic shield and surrounding region.  DEL cells in both layers of the early shield distribute along the entire length of the  AP axis, from the pericardial region, ventral to the head, to the end of the tail.  For example, axial cells in the shield epiblast can relocate anteriorwards to form ventral forebrain (K. Hatta, unpublished observations), becoming new neighbors of cells originally located at the animal pole, for much of the forebrain fate maps to the animal pole of the early gastrula (Kimmel et al., 1990b).   Anteriorwards movement in the axial hypoblast of cells deriving from the shield is similarly remarkable:  To form the hatching gland, located on the pericardium (on the yolk sac ventral to the head), prechordal plate cells must first move anteriorwards along the dorsal midline.  Then they move under and in front of the forebrain anlagen, where, as gastrulation ends, they form a prominent pile known as the polster (arrow at the bud stage in <A HREF="figs/fig1.html">Fig. 1</A> and upper arrow in <A HREF="figs/fig11.html">Fig. 11L</A>).  Eventually the hatching gland forms on the pericardial membrane, ventral to the head (arrow at the prim-6 stage in <A HREF="figs/fig1.html">Fig. 1</A>).  However, this last change, from a rostral to a ventral location, probably comes about with no real ventralwards movement of these cells at all.  Rather, head straightening that begins during the segmentation period (discussed in detail below), would serve to lift the head rudiment upwards dorsally and away from the position of the hatching gland primordium, where these axial mesodermal cells might passively remain.	<p>
Axial mesoderm appears to have the potential to induce a second embryonic axis, as revealed in transplantation experiments involving cells of the embryonic shield of the early gastrula (Ho, 1992b).  Hence,  the embryonic shield, in terms of its inductive role demonstrated in these experiments, its dorsal marginal position in the embryo, and the fates it eventually generates, is broadly equivalent to the amphibian organizer region of Spemann.	<p>
As epiboly resumes (roughly an hour and a half after the beginning of gastrulation) and the shield extends towards the animal pole, one can clearly see that the blastoderm is prominently thicker on the dorsal side than on the ventral side <A HREF="figs/fig11.html">(Fig. 11F-H, J)</A>.   This seems to be due to the presence dorsally of axial hypoblast, for sections through the gastrula reveal that the epiblast does not appear regionally distinctive until late in the gastrula period (Schmitz et al., 1993; R. M. Warga, unpublished observations).  About midway through gastrulation, the axial hypoblast becomes clearly distinct from paraxial hypoblast, that flanks it on either side <A HREF="figs/fig11.html">(Fig. 11I)</A>.  Anterior paraxial hypoblast will generate muscles to move the eyes, jaws, and gills.  More posteriorly, much of the paraxial hypoblast is present as the segmental<b> </b>plate that will form somites.  	<p>
The dorsal epiblast begins to thicken rather abruptly near the end of gastrulation, the first morphological sign of development of the rudiment of the central nervous system rudiment, the neural plate.  The thickening occurs anteriorly, and initially just at the midline, where the epiblast overlies axial mesoderm.  The lateral borders of the neural plate remain morphologically indistinct at this time, in sectioned material (Schmitz et al., 1993) as well as in the living embryo.	<p>
We define the gastrula period as ending when epiboly is complete, and the tail bud has formed <A HREF="figs/fig11.html">Fig. 11</A>.  However, this is purely operational, because gastrulation movements seem to continue in the tail bud after this time.  DEL cells typically pass through cell cycle 15 and enter cycle 16 during gastrulation.  The YSL is postmitotic, and the EVL cells typically are in a long interphase of cycle 14.

<TITLE>Gastrula Period Stages</TITLE>
<H3>Stages During the Gastrula Period</H3>
50%-epiboly stage (5 1/4 h):</b>  Epiboly displaces the blastoderm margin to 50% of the distance between the animal and vegetal pole.  The margin remains at about this same position for about an hour <A HREF="figs/fig12.html">(Fig. 12)</A>, the duration of this stage and the next two.  Hence, it is important to distinguish these early gastrula stages by examining the thickness at and along the marginal region of the blastoderm.  At this 50%-epiboly stage radial intercalations have produced a blastoderm that is very uniform in thickness <A HREF="figs/fig11.html">(Fig. 11A)</A>.   In particular, an animal polar view with a dissecting microscope will reveal that the blastoderm rim is <i>not</i> yet distinctively thickened.  Many DEL cells are in late cycle 14.  <b>	<p>
Germ-ring stage (5 2/3 h)</b>:  The germ ring forms as a thickened annulus at the blastoderm margin, as one can discern in an animal-polar view (<A HREF="figs/fig1.html">Fig. 1</A> and <A HREF="figs/fig11.html">Fig. 11C; arrow</A>).  The germ ring appears nearly uniform in structure around the entire circumference of the blastoderm.  Nomarski inspection, or sections of fixed embryos, reveal that within the germ ring the blastoderm consists of two layers, in addition to the EVL.  The epiblast is uppermost, and is about three cells thick.  The hypoblast lies beneath the epiblast,  directly adjacent to the YSL.  It is only about one to two cells thick.   The yolk cell remains about half covered by the blastoderm (i.e epiboly remains at 50%).  Many DEL cells are completing cycle 14.<b>	<p>
Shield stage (6 h)</b>:  An animal polar view most easily reveals the embryonic shield, as well as the germ ring, if one is using a dissecting microscope (arrows in <A HREF="figs/fig1.html">Fig. 1</A> and <A HREF="figs/fig11.html">Fig. 11E</A>).  A side view reveals that both the epiblast and hypoblast are locally thickened at the shield <A HREF="figs/fig11.html">(Fig. 11D)</A>.  Epiboly remains at 50% until late shield stage, when the yolk cell can be judged to be more than half-covered by the blastoderm.  Many DEL cells are beginning cycle 15.	<p>
Because the embryonic shield marks the eventual dorsal side of the embryo, and because cells at the animal pole will develop into head structures, one can reliably determine both the AP and DV axes for the first time.  From this stage onwards, because we can distinguish dorsal from ventral views, we use "side view" specifically with reference to the definitive embryonic axes.  <b>	<p>
75%-epiboly stage (8 h)</b>:  Between about 60%- and 100%-epiboly we estimate the extent of epiboly for the staging index, and determine the standard developmental age from the relationship in <A HREF="figs/fig12.html">Fig. 12</A>.  As epiboly continues the shape of the embryo itself becomes more along the animal-vegetal (approximately the AP) axis <A HREF="figs/fig11.html">(Fig. 11F-J)</A>.	<p>
The embryonic shield becomes less distinctive, as compared to shield stage, as its cells repack to elongate the shield along the AP axis and narrow it mediolaterally.  A ventral view reveals that the anterior axial hypoblast that will develop as the prechordal plate reaches the animal pole <A HREF="figs/fig11.html">(Fig. 11G; arrow)</A>.   A side view shows that the blastoderm is thinner than elsewhere on the ventral side, above the margin <A HREF="figs/fig11.html">(Fig. 11H; arrow)</A>.  This region is the evacuation zone; cells leave it by both epiboly and convergence (Ballard, 1981).  In dorsal view, the boundaries in the hypoblast between the axial chorda mesoderm and paraxial segmental plate mesoderm become visible <A HREF="figs/fig11.html">(Fig. 11I; arrows)</A>.<b>	<p>
90%-epiboly stage (9 h)</b>:  The bit of uncovered yolk cell protruding from the neighborhood of the vegetal pole may now be considered a <b>yolk plug </b><A HREF="figs/fig11.html">(Fig. 11I-K)</A>.  The dorsal side of the blastoderm is very distinctively thicker than the ventral side <A HREF="figs/fig11.html">(Fig 11J)</A>.  Careful inspection with the dissecting microscope reveals Brachet's cleft between epiblast and hypoblast layers, particularly near, not just at, the dorsal midline.  Cells have left the ventral region by epiboly and by convergence towards the dorsal side, leaving behind an enlarged cell-depleted evacuation zone (located approximately at 10:00 o'clock in the side view shown in <A HREF="figs/fig11.html">Fig. 11J</A>).  The dorsal epiblast thickens anteriorly to form the neural plate (at 1:00 o'clock in the same panel), representing the brain anlagen.  The prechordal plate extends just past the animal pole by 90%-epiboly <A HREF="figs/fig11.html">Fig. 11K</A>).  Many DEL cells are in cycle 16, and the earliest postmitotic cells are present, including cells that will form the notochord, axial somite-derived muscles, and specific neurons in the hindbrain (Mendelson, 1986).<b>	<p>
Bud stage (10 h):</b>  Epiboly comes to a close as the blastoderm completely covers the yolk plug, defining 100%-epiboly.  Convergence and extension movements have spread the blastoderm across the yolk cell faster on the dorsal side than on the ventral side, and because of this asymmetry, the point at which the yolk plug disappears is not at the vegetal pole of the yolk cell, but somewhat ventral to it.	<p>
Just dorsal to the site of yolk plug closure, and usually within 10-15 min of the closure, the posterior or caudal end of the embryonic axis develops a distinct swelling, the <b>tail bud</b>, for which we name the stage <A HREF="figs/fig11.html">(Fig. 11L, arrowhead)</A>.  The region of cells may also contribute to posterior trunk, but the contribution is not a dramatic one, whereas a labeled cell in the tail bud at 10 h invariably will contribute progeny to the tail.  	<p>
Along the dorsal side, anterior to the tail bud, the neural plate is now thickened along the entire embryonic axis; its more posterior cells will contribute to trunk spinal cord.  The thickening is most prominent near the animal pole in the prospective head region, where the head will form,  and here the surface of the plate has a shallow midsagittal groove.  Prechordal plate hypoblast accumulating deep to the anterior-most neural plate now forms a prominent bulge, or <b>polster</b> ("pillow"; arrow in <A HREF="figs/fig11.html">Fig. 11L</A>) of postmitotic hatching gland cells, and possibly also giving rise to other fates.  The polster, along with median epiblast cells of the neural groove begin to indent the yolk cell's surface in the embryo's midline, as can be seen by looking along the embryonic axis.

<TITLE>Segmentation Period</TITLE>
<b>SEGMENTATION PERIOD (10-24 h)</b>	<p>
A wonderful variety of morphogenetic movements now occur, the somites develop, the rudiments of the primary organs become visible, the tail bud becomes more prominent and the embryo elongates <A HREF="figs/fig15.html">(Fig. 15)</A>.  The AP and DV axes are unambiguous.  The first cells differentiate morphologically, and the first body movements appear.
<p>
We  might have called this period the "tail bud period" because the tail bud appears at the caudal end of the lengthening axis during the whole time.  Indeed, because tail morphogenesis is so prominent during this period of development, simply noting the overall shape of the embryo is a surprisingly effective way to determine its stage.  Furthermore, as the tail extends, the overall body length of the embryo very rapidly increases, reasonably linearly, such that length is a fairly useful staging index after about 15 h <A HREF="figs/fig16.html">(Fig. 16)</A>.<P>
  <b>Embryo length (EL)</b>, at any stage, refers to the embryo's longest linear dimension.  This is important to understand, for reference to <A HREF="figs/fig1.html">Fig. 1</A> and <A HREF="figs/fig15.html">Fig. 15</A> will show that the tail does not extend directly opposite to the head.  Rather, the extending axis (on the dorsal side) curls around the original vegetal pole, incorporating cells that were ventrally located in the gastrula, and eventually the tail bud grows towards the head.  The direction reverses during the latter part of the segmentation period, for as the tail lengthens it rapidly straightens <A HREF="figs/fig15.html">(Fig. 15L-N)</A>.  Straightening of the head occurs later, for the most part during the next developmental period, the pharyngula period.
<b><p>
Somites</b> appear sequentially in the trunk and tail, and provide the most useful staging index <A HREF="figs/fig17.html">(Fig. 17)</A>.  Anterior somites develop first and posterior ones last.  The earliest few somites seem to form more rapidly than later ones, and we approximate the rate at 3 per hour for the first six, and 2 per hour thereafter at our standard temperature (Hanneman &amp; Westerfield, 1989).  <A HREF="figs/fig18.html">Figure 18</A> shows the curve, but if one keep in mind that 18 somites are present at 18 h and two form per hour over most of the period, then the figure is unneccessary.  To accurately determine somite number use Nomarski optics, and include in the total the last (posterior-most) somite that appears to be fully segmented <A HREF="figs/fig17.html">(see Fig. 17)</A>.  The earliest furrow to form is the one posterior to the first somite, not anterior to it as as one might think.  The anterior margin of the first somite becomes visible not long afterwards, roughly coincidentally with the formation of somite two.		<p>

Shortly after each somite forms, its surface appears epithelial.  The epithelium surrounds a more mesenchymal region (e.g, the third somite in <A HREF="figs/fig17.html">Fig. 17A</A>, the last two somites in <A HREF="figs/fig17.html">Fig. 17D</A>).  The large majority of the interior cells in each somite will develop as a myotome (sometimes termed a myomere), or muscle segment (<A HREF="figs/fig17.html">Fig. 17C</A>; see also below, <A HREF="figs/fig34.html">Fig. 34B</A>).  Myotomes retain the metameric arrangement of the somites, adjacent myotomes becoming definitively separated by a transverse myoseptum consisting of connective tissue. 	<p>
In some vertebrates, including some teleosts, the earliest somites seem to be transient structures.  However, a cell marked with lineage tracer dye in an early zebrafish somite (e.g. at the 3-somite stage) produces a muscle clone in the corresponding myotome later <A HREF="figs/fig19.html">(Fig. 19)</A>.  Thus there are no transient somites in the zebrafish; the first somite forms the first definitive myotome and so on.		<p>

The earliest cells to elongate into muscle fibers appear to derive from a part of the medial somitic epithelium, the "adaxial" region (Thisse et al., 1993) adjacent to the developing notochord, and in the middle, dorsoventrally, of each somite.  The precocious subset of adaxial cells may include a special cell class, the muscle pioneers (Felsenfeld et al, 1991), recognizeable by enhanced expression of specific markers (Hatta et al., 1991a).  The muscle pioneers are so named because of their early development, and the name does not imply they play any necessary morphogenetic role such as shown for muscle pioneers in insects (Ho et al., 1984), which have many different features from the muscle pioneers in zebrafish.  As the muscle pioneers elongate, the myotome takes on a chevron shape. The V points anteriorly, with the muscle pioneers present at its apex <A HREF="figs/fig17.html">(Fig. 17C)</A>.  Later a horizontal myoseptum develops at the same position.	<p>
A second derivative of the somite is the sclerotome, giving rise to vertebral cartilage.  In a young somite, the sclerotome cells develop ventromedially in the somitic epithelium.  Late in the segmentation period the sclerotome cells delaminate, take on a mesenchymal appearance, and migrate dorsally, along a pathway between the myotome and notochord (personal communication, B. Morin-Kensicki).  	<p>
We do not know if a dermatome also develops from somitic cells.	<p>
Pronephric kidneys develop bilaterally deep to the third somite pair.  They are difficult to visualize in the live preparation until later in development when they enlarge and hollow out, but their ducts, the pronephric ducts, are easy to see <A HREF="figs/fig20.html">(Fig. 20)</A>.  Each pronephric duct primordium, at first without a lumen, grows posteriorly during the early part of the period, and ventrally around the posterior end of the yolk sac extension (see below), to reach the ventral midline site near the future anus where the bilateral pair of ducts will join together.  The lumen appears, and eventually the ducts open to the outside.  		<p>

The notochord differentiates, also in an AP sequence.   Some of its cells vacuolate and swell to become the structural elements of this organ (<A HREF="figs/fig21.html">Fig. 21</A>, and compare with <A HREF="figs/fig34.html">Fig. 34C</A> below), and others later form a notochord sheath, an epithelial monolayer that surrounds the organ.		<p>

The endoderm becomes morphologically distinctive at about the onset of the segmentation period, as revealed in sections through the trunk (personal communication from R. Warga).   At first, only a few rather disorganized-looking cells can be identified as being endodermal by their positions; they contact the YSL at or near the midline on the dorsal side of the embryo deep to the main part of the hypoblast.  During this period more endodermal cells appear, and form a more compact and orderly-looking epithelial arrangement.  Endoderm may develop on only the dorsal side of the embryo, beneath the axial and paraxial mesoderm.	<p>
The epiblast, now exclusively ectodermal, undergoes extensive morphogenesis during the segmentation period.  As gastrulation ends, the primordium of the central nervous system, the neural plate, is already fairly well delineated, because of its prominent thickness.  Indeed, expression of putative patterning genes, e.g. <i>krox20</i> (Oxtoby and Jowett, 1993) and <i>pax2</i> (Krauss et al., 1991) show that the neural plate is already regionalized as the segmentation period begins.  The anterior region where the brain will form is particularly thick <A HREF="figs/fig15.html">(Fig. 15B and C)</A>.  Whereas the epiblast of the early and midgastrula appears several cells thick <A HREF="figs/fig13.html">(Fig. 13)</A>, labeling studies (Papan and Campos-Ortega, 1994) reveal that by the late gastrula period the epiblast becomes a monolayer,  a pseudostratified epithelium.  The thickness of the neural plate is due to the fact that its cells take on a columnar shape, whereas the more lateral and ventral ectodermal cells, in the epidermal primordium, remain cuboidal (diagrammed in <A HREF="figs/fig22.html">Fig. 22A</A>).  Formation of the neural tube then occurs by a process known as "secondary neurulation", as recently studied in the zebrafish by Papan and Campos-Ortega (1994).  Seondary neurulation contrasts with "primary" neurulation, the textbook version of neurulation in vertebrates where a hollow tube forms from the neural plate by an uplifting and meeting together of neural folds.  In teleosts the lumen of the neural tube, the neurocoele, forms 'secondarily', by a late process of cavitation.  An intermediate and transient condensed primordium with no lumen, the neural keel, forms first <A HREF="figs/fig15.html">(Fig. 15E)</A>.  The neural keel rounds into a cylindrical, still solid neural rod<b> </b><A HREF="figs/fig15.html">(Fig. 15K, 21A)</A>, and only afterwards hollows into the neural tube (<A HREF="figs/fig15.html">Fig. 15</A> and  <A HREF="figs/fig21.html">Fig. 21B</A>). 		<p>

More covertly, primary and secondary neurulation are similar to one another (Papan and Campos-Ortega, 1994).  The neural plate transforms topologically into the neural tube in fish in the same way it does in amphibians, as revealed by fate mapping in salmonids (Ballard, 1973) and zebrafish (Kimmel et al., 1990b), where it has now been studied in detail (Papan and Campos-Ortega, 1994).  The medial part of the neural plate (originally from dorsal epiblast in the gastrula) forms ventral structures in the neural tube, and the lateral part of the plate (from lateral and ventral gastrula gastrula epiblast) forms dorsal tube.  The similar transformation occurring in primary and secondary neurulation is due to what seems to be fundamentally similar morphogenesis; the neural keel develops by a process of epithelial infolding at the midline, equivalent to the folding of the plate in primary neurulation of amphibians (Papan and Campos-Ortega, 1994).  The cells remain epithelial throughout neurulation in both types.  They converge towards the midline, and then, in the zebrafish, they tip obliquely on both sides of the midline in a manner that indicates infolding <A HREF="figs/fig22.html">(Fig. 22B)</A>, paralleling the neural folds in primary neurulation.  The original outer surfaces, the apical ones, of the epithelial cells from the left and right sides of the neural plate then meet to form the midline of the developing neural keel, and subsequently the midline of the neural rod <A HREF="figs/fig22.html">(Fig. 22C)</A>.  It is then that these apical surfaces, rather late during the segmentation period, pull away from one another to form the neurocoele.  This process begins at the floor plate <A HREF="figs/fig21.html">(Fig. 21)</A>, a distinctive row of cells occupying the neural primordium's ventral midline (Hatta et al., 1991b).   	<p>
Because the times of neurulation and segmentation overlap so extensively the zebrafish does not have a distinct "neurula period" of development, such as occurs largely before segmentation in amphibian embryos.  Another prominent difference between zebrafish and <i>Xenopus</i>, revealed by labeling studies, is that in the amphibian one side of the neural plate forms the corresponding lateral wall of the neural tube, whereas in the zebrafish cell divisions occurring in the midline during keel formation (typically division 16; Kimmel et al., 1994) often distribute sister cells originating from one side of the neural plate to both sides of the neural tube.  We presently do not understand the significance of this redistribution.	<p>
Even before cavitation, the anterior part of the neural keel that will form the brain undergoes regional morphogenesis.  At the beginning of the segmentation period, the brain rudiment, although larger than the spinal cord rudiment, appears uniform along its length <A HREF="figs/fig23.html">(Fig. 23A)</A>.  Then, during the first half of the segmentation period, about ten distinctive swellings, termed neuromeres, form along it <A HREF="figs/fig23.html">(Fig. 23B)</A>.  The first three are large, and become prominently sculptured.  They correspond to the two forebrain subdivisions, the diencephalon and telencephalon, and the midbrain or mesencephalon.  Additionally, the rudiments of the eyes, the optic primordia, develop very early from the lateral walls of the diencephalon (<A HREF="figs/fig15.html">Fig. 15D</A> and <A HREF="figs/fig24.html">Fig. 24</A>), eventually giving a very lovely arrowhead-like shape to the brain rudiment in dorsal view <A HREF="figs/fig15.html">(Fig. 15K)</A>.  During the last part of the segmentation period the ventral diencephalon expands as the primordium of the hypothalamus, and the primordium of the epiphysis appears as a small, well-delineated swelling in the midline of the diencephalic roof <A HREF="figs/fig23.html">(Fig. 23C)</A>.  The midbrain primordium subdivides horizontally to form the dorsal midbrain (optic) tectum and the ventral midbrain tegmentum (see below, <A HREF="figs/fig30.html">Fig. 30</A>).		<p>

The remaining seven neuromeres, termed rhombomeres (r1-r7), subdivide the hindbrain (<A HREF="figs/fig23.html">Fig. 23B &amp; C</A> and <A HREF="figs/fig25.html">Fig. 25</A>).  The primordium of the cerebellum forms near the end of the period as a very prominent dorsal domain in the region of the hindbrain-midbrain boundary.		<p>

Associated with the neural primordium are changes in its periphery.  Neural crest, its early position indicated by expression of the homeobox gene <i>dlx3</i> (Akimenko et al., 1994),  delaminates and migrates from the dorsolateral wall of both the brain <A HREF="figs/fig26.html">(Fig. 26)</A> and spinal cord primordia, beginning at neural keel stage, and continuing well after the tube has appeared.  Just adjacent to the keel, thickened ectodermal placodes appear bilaterally at specific locations, also predicted by <i>dlx3</i> expression (Akimenko et al., 1994) within the head region, and which later form sensory tissues (<A HREF="figs/fig26.html">Fig. 26</A> and <A HREF="figs/fig27.html">Fig. 27</A>).  They include the olfactory placode overlying the telencephalon, the lens placode, associated with the optic primordium, and the otic (ear) placode overlying rhombomere 5 of the hindbrain (<A HREF="figs/fig25.html">Fig. 25</A> and <A HREF="figs/fig27.html">Fig. 27</A>).   		<p>

Following closely upon the early morphogenesis of the neural tube, the first neurons begin to differentiate, and in comparison with what will come later the pattern of cells and axonal pathways is not overwhelmingly complicated.  So far as we know all of the early developing cells, termed "primary neurons" (Grunwald et al., 1988), develop large cell bodies, and extend long axons that project between different regions of the neural tube (e.g. between the hindbrain and spinal cord), or, in the cases of sensory neurons and motoneurons, between the neural tube and the periphery.  Early sensory neurons, that will mediate tactile sensibility, are located bilaterally both in a discontinous dorsal column in the spinal cord (Rohon-Beard cells) and in a ganglion (trigeminal) in the head.  Beginning at about 16 h the peripheral sensory axons extend to blanket the skin and the central axons from the same neurons pioneer a single long tract located dorsolaterally along the wall of the neural tube (Metcalfe et al., 1990).  Motoneurons differentiate in the ventral spinal cord only slightly later (Eisen et al., 1986; Myers et al., 1986).  A marvelous feature of their development is that as individual motor axons grow out to meet the developing myotomal muscle cells, the axons elicit contractions in the muscle, presumably by transmitter release from the growth cones (Grunwald et al., 1988).  Hence at this time an observer can very easily appreciate just where these neurons are in their development.  The primary motoneurons have been particularly well-studied.  There are three, sometimes four (Eisen et al., 1990) of them in each spinal hemisegment, and their axons grow without error along precise pathways to innervate restricted domains within the overlying myotome (Myers et al., 1986).  By carrying out meticulously timed transplantions of single postmitotic cells to new locations in the ventral spinal cord, Eisen (1991) has shown that position of the motoneuronal cell body  plays a crucial role in specification of its identity, which becomes fixed 1-2 hours before axonogenesis.  	<p>
The centrally-located interneurons form a relatively simple pattern at first, one that is clearly related to the neuromeric organization of the neural tube:  Bilateral pairs of single interneurons or small clusters of them begin to differentiate at the centers of each of the brain neuromeres indicated in Fig. 23B (reviewed in Kimmel, 1993), and in each segment of the spinal cord (Bernhardt et al., 1990).  Primary interneurons in both the spinal cord and hindbrain are individually dentifiable.  The timing of interneuronal development is generally not known as precisely as for the sensory neurons and motoneurons, but the earliest central axons appear at nearly the same stage as the peripheral ones.  These central axons form a simple scaffold,  organized orthogonally (Wilson et al., 1990; Chitnis and Kuwada, 1990; Metcalfe et al., 1990):  A primary bilateral pair of ventral longitudinal tracts extend through the length of the brain and spinal cord, with the two sides connected by commissural axons crossing the midline.  Each set of interneurons, or in the hindbrain and spinal cord each individual interneuron, pioneers a part of this system or joins to it in a way that is highly stereotyped (e.g. Wilson and Easter, 1991), apparently matching the precision of motor axonal pathfinding in the periphery.  Notably, when and where the cells develop and where their axons extend correlate closely with the spatial domains and temporal patterns of expression of regulatory genes, including  genes of the <i>pax, krox, eph, forkhead</i> and <i>wnt</i> families (Macdonald et al., 1994; Krauss et al., 1991; Oxtoby and Jowett, 1993).	<p>
Function follows upon morphological development of the neuronal systems, and the early pattern of synaptic interconnections between the neurons seems also to be very precise.  In a particularly clear example, an identified dendrite of a specific interneuron, the Mauthner neuron located in the hindbrain's fourth rhombomere, begins to extend late in the segmentation period (18 h), nearly simultaneously with the arrival to it of a set of axonal growth cones coming from trigeminal sensory  neurons.  As the dendrite begins its outgrowth it tightly envelops the small bundle of growing sensory axons, and at that location specifically, just at the base of a dendrite which eventally  becomes quite long, synapses are made  (Kimmel et al., 1990a).  This connection appears to be a key one in a reflexive relay between primary sensory neurons in the head and primary motoneurons in the spinal cord, to which the axon of the Mauthner cell projects.  The behavioral reflex, a motor response to a light touch to the head, becomes apparent a few hours later.	<p>
Ventrolaterally to the brain primordium, and largely posteriorly to the eye, a primordium appears that will form the series of pharyngeal or visceral arches.  Including an inner epithelial lining of pharyngeal endoderm, the pharyngeal arches derive from all three germ layers, head neural crest contributing prominently to the arch mesenchyme (Schilling and Kimmel 1994).  Both morphogenesis and differentiation of the pharyngeal walls occurs most dramatically later, during the hatching period. 	<p>
The pharyngeal arches and rhombomeres are visible components of the head segments, as the somites are compontents of the trunk and tail segments.  Early head mesoderm might also be segmentally organized, but we have no evidence for it.  Head mesodermal condensations and vesicles, such as described classically as "preotic somites" from sections of embryos of sharks and other kinds of fish, have not been found in teleost embryos, as confirmed in a recent reinvestigation (Horder et al., 1993).  On the other hand, head mesodermal  "somitomeres" were characterized in an SEM study of the medaka, <i>Oryzias</i> (Martindale et al., 1987), a teleost fish distantly related to the zebrafish.  Head mesodermal segments, if present in early zebrafish embryos, are not readily visible in live material.<P>

<b>1-somite stage (10 1/3 h)</b>:  The first somitic furrow forms, usually, but not invariably, after both completion of epiboly and the initial appearance of the tail bud <A HREF="figs/fig15.html">(Fig. 15A)</A>.  This furrow marks the boundary between what will become the first and second somites.  Viewing the embryo along the axis from the anterior pole reveals the now very prominent polster deep to the neural plate <A HREF="figs/fig15.html">(Fig. 15C, arrow)</A>.<b>	<p>
5-somite stage (11 2/3 h):</b>  The first 5-6 somites appear at the rate of about 3 per hour.  The length of the embryo is about 0.8 mm, the same as the zygote.	<p>
The brain primordium has now distinctively thickened into the neural keel <A HREF="figs/fig15.html">(Fig. 15E, F)</A>, and beginning at the 4- or 5-somite stage one can first distinguish the <b>optic primordium</b> from a side view (<A HREF="figs/fig15.html">Fig. 15D</A> and <A HREF="figs/fig24.html">Fig. 24</A>) or a dorsal view.  In the trunk the neural plate is still present, and sections reveal that it has three pronounced thickenings at this stage, a bilateral pair flanking a median one.  Neural keel formation occurs in the anterior trunk between the 6- and 10-somite stages (Schmitz et al., 1993).	<b><p>
Kupffer's vesicle</b> makes its appearance deep to the tail bud (<A HREF="figs/fig15.html">Fig. 15F</A>, arrow; <A HREF="figs/fig28.html">Fig. 28B</A>)  This structure, found only in teleost embryos, is transient, and its significance has been debated in the older literature.  Kupffer, who discovered it, thought it might be an allantoic rudiment (see Brummett and Dumont, 1978).  Recent fate mapping studies show that the epithelial cells lining the vesicle will later form tail mesodermal derivatives, including notochord and muscle (Melby et al, 1993).		<p>

By the 8-somite stage Nomarski optics reveal the early rudiment of the pronephros, and migration of cephalic neural crest cells.  <b>	<p>
14-somite stage (16 h)</b>:   Extension of the tail rudiment barely begins to elongate the embryo (<A HREF="figs/fig15.html">Fig. 15H, 15I</A>, <A HREF="figs/fig16.html">Fig. 16</A>); its length (EL) is about 0.9 mm.  The small trigeminal placode <A HREF="figs/fig26.html">(Fig. 26A)</A> and more distinctive <b>otic placode</b> <A HREF="figs/fig27.html">(Fig. 27A)</A> are present beside the hindbrain rudiment, the latter about midway between the optic vesicle and the first somite.  One can readily distinguish four prominent subdivisions of the brain, the telencephalon, diencephalon, midbrain and hindbrain.  The fourth ventricle barely begins to inflate the dorsal hindbrain, and five rhombomeres, r2-r6, become visible in a dorsolateral view <A HREF="figs/fig25.html">(Fig. 25)</A>.  Rhombomere r5 lies deep to otic placodes.  In the trunk the neural keel rounds into the neural rod, still without a cavity, but now overridden by adjacent epidermis (Papan and Campos-Ortega, 1994).  Neural crest migration is underway in both the head (<A HREF="figs/fig26.html">Fig. 26</A>; Schilling and Kimmel, 1994) and the trunk (Raible et al., 1992; Raible and Eisen, 1994).  	<p>
Somites now form at a rate of about 2 per hour <A HREF="figs/fig28.html">(Fig. 18)</A>, and older ones begin to develop the myotomes.  They take on the V-shaped appearance that indicates the future division of the myotomes into the dorsal (epaxial) and ventral (hypaxial) muscle masses <A HREF="figs/fig17.html">(Fig. 17C)</A>.  In the center of the anterior myotomes a view with polarized light reveals early birefringence, due to myofibrillar development, of 2-6 elongated differentiating muscle pioneer cells (Felsenfeld et al., 1991).  	<p>
The notochord becomes more distinguishable from the ventral part of the neural keel, as can be appreciated in a dissecting microscope view along the axis.  With Nomarski optics one can see that the notochord cells show a characteristic 'stack-of-pennies' appearance (<A HREF="figs/fig21.html">Fig. 21</A>, also see <A HREF="figs/fig28.html">Fig. 28C</A> for the tail tip at a later developmental stage).	<p>
 A characteristic constriction that is important for staging appears in the posterior region of the yolk, where the tail bud ends, and gives the yolk a kidney-bean shape <A HREF="figs/fig15.html">(Fig. 15H)</A>.  The constriction rapidly becomes more prominent <A HREF="figs/fig15.html">(Fig. 15J)</A> and squeezes progressively more anteriorwards <A HREF="figs/fig15.html">(Fig. 15L)</A>. The constricted region develops into the thinner and cylindrically-shaped posterior elongation of the yolk sac, the <b>yolk extension</b> (Milos and Dingle, 1978).  The shape of the yolk extension will continue to distinguish it from the anterior region, the <b>yolk ball</b>. 	<p>
The tail bud now begins to protrude away from the body of the embryo, and Kupffer's vesicle is a prominent feature at its base (<A HREF="figs/fig15.html">Figs. 15 H, J (arrow), K</A>, <A HREF="figs/fig28.html">Fig. 28B</A>).	<b><p>
20-somite stage (19 h)</b>:  Morphogenesis associated with the constriction of the yolk begins to straighten out the posterior trunk, and this, along with continued development of the tail, produces a marked increase in the length of the embryo to an EL of 1.4 mm <A HREF="figs/fig15.html">(Fig. 15 M)</A>.  The length of the yolk extension is now more than half the diameter of the yolk ball.  The lens placode appears and the otic placode hollows into the <b>otic vesicle</b> (<A HREF="figs/fig15.html">Fig. 15</A>M (arrow), <A HREF="figs/fig25.html">Fig. 25</A>, and <A HREF="figs/fig27.html">Fig. 27B</A>) which contains two otoliths that are so tiny at this time it requires Nomarski optics to see them <A HREF="figs/fig25.html">(Fig. 25)</A>.  The brain now also becomes a hollow structure, with ventricles present along its length, and with Nomarski optics one can first recognize the rudiment of the cerebellum.  Seven rhombomeres are much more prominent in some embryos than others (compare <A HREF="figs/fig25.html">Fig. 25</A> with <A HREF="figs/fig30.html">Fig. 30A</A>, below).  Hollowing from the neural rod into the neural tube is also now nearly complete throughout the length of the trunk.  The primordium of the postotic or posterior lateral line resides as an ectodermal placode between the otic vesicle and the first somite.  A substantial part of the primordium will soon begin to migrate posteriorly, and will be important for staging, as we describe below.  Neurons, including spinal primary motoneurons, trigeminal ganglion neurons <A HREF="figs/fig26.html">(Fig. 26B)</A>, and Rohon-Beard neurons, have growing axons.	<p>
Nearly all of the trunk somites now exhibit the myotomal chevron shape, and the trunk myotomes produce weak <b>muscular contractions</b>.  Nomarski reveals that anterior muscle pioneers have cross-striations.  The first contractions, occurring at the 17-somite stage, involve individual (unilateral) myotomes, and, as mentioned earlier, are correlated with the ingrowth of axons from first developing primary motoneurons (Hanneman and Westerfield, 1989).  Progressively the contractions begin to involve series of myotomes and become stronger, more coordinated, and more frequent.  	<p>
Anterior notochord cells have vacuoles <A HREF="figs/fig21.html">(Fig. 21)</A>.  The pronephric duct extends through the whole length of the trunk and curves ventrally around the yolk extension, showing where the anus will eventually develop in the ventral midline at the level of somite 17, and serving to define the boundary between the trunk and tail.  (Later, due to morphogenetic rearrangements, the position of the anus shifts to the level of somite 15).  	<p>
Just posterior and dorsal to the end of the pronephric duct  in the ventral tail rudiment, mesenchyme accumulates in a so-called intermediate mass of mesoderm, the early forerunner of the hematopoietic blood island (<A HREF="figs/fig17.html">Fig. 17D</A>, and <A HREF="figs/fig20.html">Fig. 20A</A>).	<b><p>
26-somite stage (22 h)</b>:  EL = 1.6 mm.  Straightening of the posterior trunk is nearly complete, but the elongating tail still curves ventrally <A HREF="figs/fig20.html">(Fig. 15 N, O)</A>.  The yolk extension is now nearly the length of the yolk ball.  The cerebellar primordium is prominent, and one can recognize the rudiments of both the epiphysis and hypothalamus in the diencephalon <A HREF="figs/fig23.html">(Fig. 23C)</A>.  The olfactory placodes thicken anterior and dorsal to the forebrain, and one can now easily see the two otoliths in each otic vesicle with just the dissecting microscope.  With Nomarski optics the early posteriorwards migration of the posterior lateral line primordium is evident; the advancing tip of the primordium is located over the third somite (hence, as will be explained below, we might call this stage the prim-3 stage).  	<p>
The last somites of the series form more slowly than the others (not shown in the idealized curve of <A HREF="figs/fig18.html">Fig. 18</A>), and the total number that eventually forms is variable, from 30 to 34 pairs.  The blood island is now a distinctive nest of dividing and differentiating blood cells.  The rudiment of the unpaired median finfold appears in the dorsal midline, along the length of the tail <A HREF="figs/fig28.html">(Fig. 28C)</A>, sometimes at 22 h, but more frequently at 23 h (28-somite stage).  	<p>
The spontaneous myotomal contractions now produce a lashing from side to side, and their frequency increases transiently upon dechorionation.

</head><body><TITLE>Pharyngula Period</TITLE>
<H3>PHARYNGULA PERIOD  (24-48 h)</H3>
Ballard (1981) coined the term "pharyngula" to refer to the embryo that has developed to the phyolotypic stage, when it posesses the classic vertebrate bauplan.   According to von Baer's famous laws (discussed by Gould, 1977) this is the time of development when one can most readily compare the morphologies of embryos of diverse vertebrates, and for the zebrafish we approximate the period as the second of the three days of embryonic development <A HREF="figs/fig29.html">(Fig. 29)</A>.  The embryo is most evidently now a bilaterally organized creature, entering the pharyngula period with a well-developed notochord, and a newly-completed set of somites that extend to the end of a long post-anal tail.  The nervous system is hollow and expanded anteriorly.  With the rapid cerebellar morphogenesis of the metencephalon <A HREF="figs/fig30.html">(Fig. 30A)</A><b>,</b> just preceding the pharyngula period, the brain is now sculptured into 5 lobes <A HREF="figs/fig23.html">(Fig. 23C)</A>.		<p>

The period name focuses attention on the primordia of the pharyngeal arches, present but at early times difficult to distinguish individually.  The pharyngeal arches develop rapidly during this second day from a primordial region that can be visualized ventral to, and about twice as long as the otic vesicle <A HREF="figs/fig31.html">(Fig. 31)</A>.  Seven pharyngeal arches in all develop from this primordium, a prominent boundary within it (arrow in <A HREF="figs/fig31.html">Fig. 31</A>) occurring between pharyngeal arches 2 and 3.  This boundary is important, for later the arches anterior to it (the mandibular and hyoid arches) form the jaws and the operculum, and arches (branchial arches) posterior to it will form the gills. 		<p>

The cells of the hatching gland, with their brightly refractile cytoplasmic granules, are prominent features of the pericardial region throughout the pharyngula period <A HREF="figs/fig32.html">(Fig. 32)</A>. 		<p>

During the first few hours of the pharyngula period the embryo continues the rapid lengthening that started at 15 h, but then the rate of lengthening abruptly decreases.  The time of the change, at 31-32 h, correlates approximately with the end of the rapid morphogenetic straightening of the tail, discussed above.  The new rate of lengthening is maintained throughout the rest of embryogenesis <A HREF="figs/fig16.html">(Fig. 16)</A>.<p>
 	The head also straightens out.  It lifts dorsalwards fairly rapidly during the pharyngula period and then more slowly, and one can use this change to quickly determine the approximate stage of the embryo <A HREF="figs/fig33.html">(Fig. 33)</A>.  We imagine two lines from a side view:  One, a line through the middle of the ear and eye, is the head axis. The other, along the notochord, and parallel to the horizontal myosepta at about somites 5-10, is the trunk axis.  A way to estimate the angle between the two lines, the <b>head-trunk angle (HTA)</b>, is to position the embryo in its dish with its tail pointing towards the observor, and mentally superimpose a clock face upon it.  One of the hands of the clock, the trunk axis, points towards 6 o'clock.  The position of the other hand, the head axis, changes with developmental time as as shown in <A HREF="figs/fig33.html">Fig. 33</A>.		<p>

The morphogenesis accompanying head-straightening dramatically shortens the head, in absolute terms, making it more compact along the anterior-posterior axis.  As can be seen from <A HREF="figs/fig1.html">Fig. 1</A>, the rudiments of the eye and the ear approach one another rapidly, thus providing a second new staging index.  Simply estimate the number of additional otic vesicles that could fit between the eye and the otic vesicle.  We term this number "<b>otic vesicle length (OVL)</b>".  It decreases from about 5 at the beginning of the pharyngula period to less than 1 at the end.	<p>
During most of the period, until about 40 h, the most precise staging method, and the most difficult, depends on using Nomarski optics to locate the leading tip of the migrating portion of the posterior lateral line primordium, as it moves steadily along the length of the trunk and tail <A HREF="figs/fig34.html">(Fig. 34A)</A>.  It leaves behind cells that form the ganglion of the lateral nerve, and as it moves it deposits cells that form the neuromasts along the nerve.  The primordium migrates in the skin, superficially to the horizontal myoseptum <A HREF="figs/fig34.html">(Fig. 34B)</A>, on each side of the body, at an approximately linear rate of 100 &#181;m/hour (Metcalfe, 1985), or 1.7 myotomes/hour.  Determine which myotome, from 1-30, the advancing  (posterior) tip of the primordium overlies.  We define <b>primordium ("prim") stages</b> by this index <A HREF="figs/fig35.html">(Fig. 35)</A>.  The method is tedious, and the migrations of the primordia on both sides of a single embryo are not always synchronous.  After 40 h the primordium is far posterior, small, and indistinct.		<p>

In addition to these general features, and novel ones that characterize particular stages, there are several important developments during the pharyngula period that we now outline below, and then, following the same order of presentation and setting each topic off into a paragraph of its own, we add details in the stage descriptions.	<p>
The fins begin to form. The median fin fold, barely present at the onset of the period, becomes prominent, and forms collagenous strengthening fin rays, or actinotrichia <A HREF="figs/fig28.html">(Fig. 28D)</A>.  The rudiments of the bilaterally paired pectoral fins begin their morphogenesis:  Mesenchymal cells gather together to form fin buds that serve as probably the single-most useful staging feature during the second half of the pharyngula period (<A HREF="figs/fig36.html">Fig. 36</A>, and <A HREF="figs/fig37.html">Fig. 37</A>).  As the buds develop, an apical ectodermal ridge becomes prominent at their tips.  Whether the ridge plays a morphogenetic role similar to that of the limb bud of tetrapods is unknown, but a hint that it might do so comes from the fact that it is positioned at the exact boundary of the ventrally located expression domain of the <i>engrailed1 </i>gene (Hatta et al., 1991a; Ekker et al., 1992).  A most significant connection between the zebrafish fin bud and the tetrapod limb bud is the domain posterior mesenchymal domain of <i>sonic hedgehog</i> gene expression in both, corresponding to the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA; see Krauss et al., 1993). 		<p>

Pigment cells differentiate.  They are easy to see and we use them for staging landmarks. The pigmented retinal epithelium, and the neural crest-derived melanophores begin to differentiate at the onset of the period, and pigmentation gets rather far along during the period <A HREF="figs/fig29.html">(see Fig. 29)</A>.  The melanophores begin to arrange themselves in a characteristic pattern that includes a well-defined set of longitudinal body-stripes (Milos and Dingle, 1978).	<p>
The circulatory system forms (Reib, 1973).  The heart begins to beat just at the onset of the period, and forms well delineated chambers.  Blood begins to circulate though a closed set of channels.  A bilateral pair of aortic arches appears just at the outset of the pharyngula period, this is aortic arch #1, the earliest and most anterior arch of the eventual serial set of six.  The others develop rapidly near the end of the period.  The blood flows into each side of the head from the anterior two arches via the carotid artery and returns via the anterior cardinal veins.  The more posterior aortic arches (arches #3-6) also connect to the left and right radices (roots) of the dorsal aortae, which anastomose in the trunk to form an unpaired midline vessel lying just ventral to the notochord.  The dorsal aorta is renamed the caudal artery as it enters the tail (Reib, 1973).  At a point along the tail the channel makes a smooth ventrally directed 180 degree turn to form the caudal vein, returning the blood to the trunk.  The vein continues in the posterior trunk as the unpaired median axial vein, lying just ventral to the dorsal aorta.  Just posterior to the heart, the vein then splits into the paired left and right posterior cardinal veins.  In turn, each posterior cardinal joins with the anterior cardinal to form the common cardinal vein (or duct of Cuvier) that leads directly to the heart's sinus venous.  The name sometimes used for the common cardinal as it crosses the yolk sac, the vitelline vein, is not very appropriate, because the vessels named vitelline veins in other fish have different connections (see Reib, 1973).  The common cardinal veins, at first very broad and not very well-defined, carry the blood ventrally across the yolk. As development continues the common cardinals become narrower channels, and relocate to the anterior side of the yolk.  	<p>
Finally, there is marked behavioral development.  Tactile sensitivity appears, and the flexions that occurred in uncoordinated individual myotomes during the late segmentation period become orchestrated into rhythmic bouts of swimming.<P>

</head><body><TITLE>Pharyngula Stages</TITLE>
<b>Stages During the Pharyngula Period	<p>
Prim-5 stage (24 h)</b>:  EL = 1.9 mm, HTA = 120 degrees, and OVL = 5.  The advancing end of the lateral line primordium overlies myotome (somite) 5.  There are about 30 somites, 13 of them in the tail.  The length of the yolk extension just equals the greatest diameter of the yolk ball.  	<p>
The median fin fold is easily recognized <A HREF="figs/fig28.html">(Fig. 28C)</A>.  By 26 h (prim-8), mesenchyme gathers specially at the paired locations where the pectoral fin buds will form, lateral to the third somites.  The buds first appear as mounds by 28-29 h.	<p>
Pigment formation begins in cells of the pigmented retinal epithelium and then in melanophores dorsolaterally in the skin.  Melanophores appear in an approximate AP gradient, first just posterior to the otic vesicle.  At the prim-5 stage the pigmentation is so light that a compound microscope may be required to see it.  Use bright field, not Nomarski, transmitted illumination so that background contrast will be minimal.  The pigment cells develop rapidly, such that within a few hours they are a prominent feature of the embryo <A HREF="figs/fig30.html">(Fig. 30A)</A>; readily apparent at low magnification by the prim-12 stage (28 h; <A HREF="figs/fig29.html">Fig. 29B</A>).  From a dorsal view at the same stage <A HREF="figs/fig29.html">(Fig. 29C)</A> one can see that melanophores now migrate to reach the dorsal and more anterior part of the yolk sac.	<p>
The heart is first visible as a cone-shaped tube deep to the brain, seemingly more dorsal than its later location, and prominently occupying a pericardial sac on the anterior-most region of the yolk.  The heart begins to beat just prior to this stage, at first with no apparent direction to the beat, and the rhythm may be interrupted.  By 26 h (prim-7), the heart tube is elongated and the contraction occurs as an AP-going wave.  Most blood cells are in the blood island (<A HREF="figs/fig17.html">Fig. 17D</A> and <A HREF="figs/fig20.html">Fig. 20A</A>), and by 24-25 h some of them move more anteriorly and dorsally, into the region between the yolk and notochord, where the major vessels supplying the trunk and tail are forming.  Blood cells also occupy the the yolk ball, over very ill-defined and broad regions that herald the development of the common cardinal veins.  The blood cells will begin circulation very soon after the stage when they first appear on the yolk ball.	<p>
The prim-5 embryo continues to exhibit spontaneous side-to-side contractions involving the trunk and tail.  The contractions often occur in bursts, at a rate of about 8 episodes per minute (Grunwald et al., 1988).  Sensory-motor reflexive circuits are becoming functional.  At the prim-5 stage one cannot clearly distinguish responsiveness to light touches to the head or body of the dechorionated embryo, possibly because of a fairly high background level of spontaneous contractions.  However, by 27 h (prim-10), this background lowers (it remains transiently high just after dechorionationation), and the first consistent tactile responses appear.  The reflexive movements have approximately the same nature as the spontaneously occurring ones.<b>	<p>
Prim-15 stage (30 h)</b>:  EL = 2.5 mm, HTA = 95 degrees, OVL = 3.  The yolk extension is just longer than the yolk ball.  In dorsal view the yolk ball appears about twice as wide as the head.	<p>
The ventral portion of the median fin fold extends anteriorly, to underlie the yolk extension.  The pectoral fin buds have the form of shallow domes, each with a height less than a third of the diameter at its base. 	<p>
The embryo now begins to slow its overall rate of lengthening as tail morphogenesis comes to an end.  A distinctive tail bud is no longer present, rather, some degenerating cells, evident by their bright appearance with Nomarski optics, occupy its position.  The cell death may represent a natural process of elimination of the excess cells remaining  in the bud after tail somitogenesis is complete (Kimmel <i>et al.</i>, 1989).	<p>
Cells throughout the pigmented layer of the retina develop visible pigment granules.  One can now very readily distinguish many of these pigmented epithelial cells, as well as the mesenchymal-looking melanophores in the skin by their dark pigmentation.  A distinctive dorsal clustering of melanophores presages the formation of the median <b>dorsal stripe</b>, lengthwise and overlying the tops of the myotomes, and at this stage extending posteriorly to about somite 12.  Other melanophores have appeared anteriorly in the head; a few of them are present overlying the dorsal midbrain and occasionally the forebrain.  Yet others have migrated ventrally and begin to fill in a <b>ventral stripe</b> of pigmentation that underlies the myotomes bilaterally, but still is dorsal to the yolk.  This ventral stripe is now very ill-defined and incomplete, particularly in the tail.  Other melanophores migrate superficially to the myotomes but are not yet organized into a lateral stripe that will eventually overlie the horizontal myosepta.  Melanophores also continue to accumulate on the dorsal yolk sac.  Migration proceeds faster anteriorly than in more posterior regions, and results in a ventrally projecting <b>anterior horn</b> subregion of the ventral stripe containing broad, smoothly outlined melanophores extending to the bases of the eyes on each side of the midline  <A HREF="figs/fig29.html">(Fig. 29E, arrow in F)</A>.	<p>
The heart is still a straight tube, and its beat is becoming more  prominent.  Each heart-beat is in two parts, the first indication of development of chambers.  There is a single aortic arch and complete arterial system between the pharynx and the tail, through which blood slowly circulates.  A bit more than half-way along the tail a labyrinth-like network of channels connect between the caudal artery and vein. An apparently specialized set of very refractile cells line these particular channels <A HREF="figs/fig38.html">(Fig. 38)</A>.  We term the elements the tail reticular cells, because they very rapidly take up latex beads injected into the circulatory system (unpublished observations of CBK and BU), in the manner of reticulo-endothelial elements of the adult blood vascular system.  		<p>

The frequency of spontaneous body contractions now diminishes to 1-2 episodes per minute.  A light touch placed anywhere on the body or head usually elicits a robust reflexive side-to-side bout of wriggles.  However, the embryo cannot yet effectively move its body through the water. <b>	<p>
Prim-25 stage (36 h)</b>:  EL = 2.7 mm, HTA = 75 degrees, OVL = 1.  The length of yolk extension now markedly surpasses the diameter of the yolk ball.  In dorsal view, the width of the yolk ball exceeds that of the head by a factor of about 1.3.  	<p>
Actinotrichia develop posteriorly in the median fin fold where they can be revealed by Nomarski optics <A HREF="figs/fig28.html">(Fig. 28D)</A>.  Each pectoral fin bud is a dome-shaped mound raised about three-fourths as high as its width.  As the bud grows outwards it loses the symmetrical appearance it had earlier, beginning to form an apical tip posterior to the center of the bud <A HREF="figs/fig37.html">(Fig. 37B)</A>.  The apical ectodermal ridge is now present at the tip, and easily visible with Nomarski optics if the orientation is correct, because the ridge runs obliquely across the bud, in a ventroposterior to dorsoanterior direction (Hatta et al., 1991a).  	<p>
Pigmentation is prominent in the eye, but is still light enough so that one can readily visualize the unpigmented cell nuclei in this retinal epithelium.  Melanophores on the body elaborate a bolder and longer (but still not sharply defined) dorsal stripe; now usually extending from the diencephalic region of the head to the tip of the tail, excluding the fin fold.  There are still gaps along this dorsal stripe.  Melanophores also appear laterally on the trunk and tail, some of them lodged in the region of the horizontal myoseptum where the lateral stripe will form.  Others fill in the ventral stripe, making its anterior horn more readily apparent <A HREF="figs/fig29.html">(Fig. 29 H, I)</A>, and extending the ventral stripe posteriorly to about about half way to the tip of the tail.  Melanophores are also present on the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the yolk sac.  Beginning at this time it be useful to examine the embryo with epi-illumination, using either the dissecting or compound microscope, not just with transmitted light.  This is because the first reflective pigment cells, iridophores, soon appear on the eye.  However, one cannot identify them at 36 h. 	<p>
The pericardial cavity is not yet prominently inflated.  Blood circulation is strong.  The heart, previously a straight tube, now bends slightly.  There is still but a single pair of aortic arches.  The circulatory loop connecting the caudal artery and vein has moved to about 3/4 of the way to the end of the tail.  Returning blood through the trunk and across the yolk, the pathway that includes the axial vein, the posterior cardinal vein and common cardinal vein are well-defined channels.  	<p>
Spontaneous episodes of lashing activity of the embryo are now infrequent, occurring at less than one episode per min.  The reflexive escape response to a touch lasts longer than before, and now effectively serves to displace the embryo, usually up to several body-lengths.  The wriggles still occur slowly enough that one can easily resolve their rhythm; later the reflex is snappier and individual swimming beats occur so quickly that they simply cannot be resolved by eye.     	<b><p>
High-pec stage (42 h)</b>:  EL = 2.9 mm, HTA = 55 degrees, OVL = 3/4.  The name for this stage, as well as for the next two, draws attention to the appearance of the rudiments of the pectoral fins.  Now, at the high-pec stage, the fin bud's height is about equal to the width of its base.  The apical ridge is readily visible using just the dissecting microscope.  The ridge has increased prominence because it now incorporates, in addition to ectodermal epithelium, an underlying loose mesenchyme that will participate in development of the blade of the fin.	<p>
The yolk extension retains a distinctly cylindrical shape along most of its length, but its posterior end begins to taper, to take on a more conical appearance.  Its length is about 1.5 times the diameter of the yolk ball.  A dorsal view reveals that the yolk ball is about 1.3 times wider than the head. 	<p>
The migrating primordium of the posterior lateral line gets smaller as it migrates, making it harder to identify (its identification never was particularly easy), and by 42 h it has reached the posterior end of the axis, so that its position can no longer be used as a staging index. The mandibular and hyoid arches (the first and second pharyngeal arches) are well defined.  Inspection of the olfactory pits with Nomarski optics reveals the first formation of cilia by the epithelial cells.  There is little or no ciliary beat.  The same method also reveals a thickening in a dorsolateral region along the inner side of the otic vesicle's epithelial wall, that preludes development of the semicircular canals.  	<p>
The primordia of the liver and probably the swim bladder make their appearances along the gut tract, posterior to the pharynx in the region of the anterior yolk ball.  However, they are rather hidden by the dorsal part of the yolk ball; sectioned material reveals endodermal morphogenesis much more readily rather than do views of the living embryo.  Hindgut endoderm is now recognizeable (first at the prim-28 stage at 39 h) as a solid plug (not a hollow tube) of midline cells in the anal region, thicker than the adjacent pronephric ducts.	<p>
The dorsal stripe of melanophores now is very well filled out to the end of the tail.  The ventral stripe, now filled out anteriorly from the eye, also may contain pigment cells to the end of the tail.  However,  gaps along it in the tail region are conspicuous, one of these persisting at its posterior end.  At this stage the dorsal and ventral stripes come together at the end of the tail to make an incompletely pigmented posteriorly pointed V.  Melanophores along the lateral aspect of the myotomes now begin to organize distinctively along the horizontal myosepta as the <b>lateral stripe </b><A HREF="figs/fig29.html">(Fig. 29H)</A>.  Only a very few cells are in it, 3 or so on each side of the body.  The first few melanophores also reach the ventral surfaces of both the yolk ball and yolk extension, and will later organize into a yolk stripe that joins the ventral stripe at the level of the anus.  Very bright illumination will for the first time reveal that the head has a very pale yellow cast, marking the first appearance of <b>xanthophores</b>.  Also for the first time, bright incident illumination occasionally reveals a very few faintly reflective pigment spots, <b>iridophores</b>, scattered in a disorganized fashion on the eye.  Iridophores are not yet apparent elsewhere on the body.  Both xanthophores and iridophores will be much more easily and consistently recognized at the long-pec stage (48 h).	<p>
The bend in the heart is now prominent and marks the division between the atrium and ventricle, and Nomarski optics reveals an endothelial cushion between them.  The heart beats (about 180 per minute) with the atrial beat preceding the ventricular one.  There is still only one pair of aortic arches.  The  common cardinal vein on the yolk sac is very broad and prominent.  Segmental arteries and veins are present along the trunk and tail.  These vessels are deep to the myotomes, and are most easily recognized overlying the spinal cord near each transverse myoseptum.  Those in the anterior tail begin to carry circulating blood. 	<p>
Dechorionated embryos lie on their sides when at rest, yolk sac obliquely upwards.  A touch elicits a vigorous and rapid response, with a wriggling rhythm just slow enough that its beat is still barely discernable.  The response propels the embryo from a few body lengths in many cases, or up to the whole width of a 5 cm dish in others.  At the end of the bout of swimming the embryo comes to rest on its side, not dorsal-up.

</head><body><TITLE>Hatching Period</TITLE>
<H3>HATCHING PERIOD (48-72 h)</H3>
The time of hatching is not useful as a staging index for the zebrafish, in contrast to some other types of embryos, because individuals within a single developing clutch hatch sporadically during the whole third day of development (at standard temperature), and occasionally later.  Whether or not an embryo has hatched, its development progresses, hour by hour, and generally  individuals that have spontaneously hatched are not more developmentally advanced that ones remaining in their chorions.  We arbitrarily call the creatures "embryos" until the end of the third day, and afterwards, "larvae", whether they have hatched or not <A HREF="figs/fig39.html">(Fig. 39)</A>. 		<p>

During the hatching period the embryo continues to grow at about the same rate as earlier <A HREF="figs/fig16.html">(Fig. 16)</A>.  Morphogenesis of many of the organ rudiments is now rather complete and slows down considerably, with some notable exceptions including the gut and its associated organs.  However, these endodermal structures are difficult to visualize in the living embryo because of their deep positions, and we do not consider them completely here.  Much easier to see are the rapidly developing rudiments of the pectoral fins, the jaws, and the gills.<p>
 	Pectoral fin development continues to be a useful feature for staging, especially during the early part of the hatching period.  At the onset of the period the paired fin rudiments are elongated buds, each already containing centrally-located mesenchymal condensations that will form the girdle cartilages (arrowheads in <A HREF="figs/fig37.html">Fig. 37C</A>).  The distal epithelial fold capping the bud, that developed from the apical ectodermal ridge, now expands into the blade of the fin proper and strengthening actinotrichia appear.  At the same time a circulatory channel appears as a continuous loop at the base of the enlarging fin, i.e. its position is proximal to the actinotrichia but distal to the cartilage.  This channel will develop both as artery and vein.  The subclavian artery takes the blood outward into the fin from the paired portion of the dorsal aorta posterior to the last aortic arch.  The subclavian vein returns the blood again, connecting proximally near the origin of the common cardinal.	<p>
Prominent changes occur in the pharyngeal region.  During the early part of the hatching period the small open <b>mouth</b> can be located with Nomarski optics in a midventral position, between the eyes <A HREF="figs/fig40.html">(Fig. 40)</A>, a position that seems surprising, at first, because it is so far posterior in the head.  Then, especially during the last 12 hours of embryogenesis, a dramatic repositioning of the mouth occurs.  Jaw morphogenesis moves the position of the mouth anteriorwards, and just at the end of the hatching period the mouth protrudes beyond the eye, where it gapes wide open.  Rapid jaw and mouth morphogenesis will continue in the early larva. 		<p>

Examining cartilage development in the <b>jaw </b>primordia is also useful for staging, especially during the last part of the hatching period.  As noted above, the two anterior-most pharyngeal arches (the mandibular and hyoid arches) that form the jaw and associated supportive apparatus are always distinctive from the more posterior arches, collectively termed branchial arches.  Cartilage development in the jaws lags behind cartilage development in the pectoral fin and behind formation of the first cartilages of the chondrocranium (the latter, basal cartilages located deep beneath the brain, are rather difficult to see in the living preparation and we do not describe them here).  On the other hand the jaw cartilages develop ahead of the branchial cartilages.  Mesenchymal precartilage condensations appear in both the mandibular and hyoid arches near the beginning of the hatching period and distinctive cartilages, ventral and dorsal elements, develop in each arch by the end of this period <A HREF="figs/fig41.html">(Fig. 41)</A>.  The ventral cartilage of the mandibular arch (the mandibular or Meckel's cartilage) and the ventral element of the hyoid arch (the ceratohyal cartilage), are large supportive structures of the lower jaw, beneath the pharyngeal or oral cavity.  The dorsal elements, the quadrate of the first arch and the hyosymplectic (also called the hyomandibular) of the second, are more delicate and more elaborate in their shapes.  A complex set of jaw muscles accompany development of the cartilages (e.g. the adductor of the mandible in <A HREF="figs/fig41.html">Fig. 41</A>).  		<p>

Earlier, during the pharyngula period, a single bilateral pair of aortic arches formed, and they occupied the jaw primordial region.  Now, when the hatching period begins, a second aortic arch has joined the first one on each side of the embryo in the region of the jaw.  The first aortic arch passes dorsally just anterior to the promininet ceratohyal cartilage, and the second aortic arch passes just posterior to the same cartilage <A HREF="figs/fig41.html">(Fig. 41)</A>.  The two vessels join together beneath the eye to form a single artery that dives into the interior of the head  as the internal carotid artery.	<p>
The next four pharyngeal arches, <b>branchial arches</b> 1-4 (corresponding to pharyngeal arches 3-6) will bear gills.  These house prominent aortic arches 3-6, such that the whole series of six pairs of aortic arches is present and carries circulating blood early in the hatching period.  A gill slit forms posterior to the hyoid arch and between each branchial arch, making five in all.  The rudiments of gill filaments develop late in the hatching period as buds along the posterior walls of the four branchial arches facing the slits <A HREF="figs/fig42.html">(Fig. 42A)</A>.  	<p>
The last arch of the pharyngeal series (branchial arch 5 or pharyngeal arch 7) does not develop gills.  There is no gill slit behind it, nor does there appear an aortic arch within it.  However, in the fashion of the other branchial arches it does make a supportive cartilage.  Pharyngeal teeth develop in association with this particular cartilage, the only teeth in fact that the zebrafish will ever have.  		<p>

The cartilages of the branchial arches begin to develop morphologically about a half day after the jaw cartilages.  Each branchial arch initially develops a single simple linear element, a ceratobranchial cartilage, not dorsal and ventral elements developing nearly together as discussed above for the jaw arches.  Moreover, the series of ceratobranchial cartilages does not develop synchronously; the first and cartilages (ceratobranchials 1 and 5) develop ahead of the others (Fig. 42 B &amp; C).  The cartilages of middle branchial arches in the series, particularly ceratobranchials 3 and 4, are still undifferentiated by end of the third day.<P>

<H3>Stages During the Hatching Period</H3>
<b>Long-pec stage (48 h):</b>  EL = 3.1 mm, HTA = 45 degrees, OVL = 1/2.  The OVL changes only little hereafter, so this value of 1/2 is a good initial indication that the embryo has reached some stage during the hatching period, vs. some earlier stage.  	<p>
As the stage name indicates, the pectoral fin buds now are quite elongated, stretching to a height-to-width ratio of about 2 <A HREF="figs/fig37.html">(Fig. 37C)</A>.  The buds curve posteriorly and have a prominently pointed shape, with the apical ectodermal ridge at the point. They still do not look fin-like, and the apical ridge is yet more prominent than earlier, its expansion accounting for a considerable portion of the lengthening of the bud.  More proximally, the central region of the bud forms forms a compact mesenchymal condensation, visible in <A HREF="figs/fig37.html">Fig. 37C</A>, that heralds development of the supportive girdle of the fin.  Here, the first cartilage in the embryo begins to differentiate morphologically at this stage, and with Nomarski optics the chondrocytes may be recognized by their cobblestone arrangement and bright appearance.	<p>
Because of both yolk depletion and growth of the head, now, as viewed from the side, the yolk ball approximately equals the volume of the head.  However, in a dorsal view the yolk ball is slightly wider than the head; the widths become about equal at 51 h.  The yolk extension has a taper along nearly its whole length, giving it a shallow conical rather than a cylindrical shape.  	<p>
The olfactory placodes are at the anterior borders of the eyes, and Nomarski reveals they have beating cilia.  Morphogenesis in the dorsal part of the otic vesicle produces the rudiments of the semicircular canals.  Hair cells have differentiated in the sensory maculae of the otic vesicle, and neuromasts, complete with protruding sensory hairs, have differentiated in the head (a prominent one is positioned between the ear and the eye), and along the posterior lateral line.  The notochord has vacuolated differentiating cells to its caudal tip.  With some difficulty one can visualize early precartilage condensations in the developing mandibular and hyoid arches, but not in the branchial arches. 	<p>
The dorsal stripe of melanophores is now very well defined and densely populated, present along the midline of the anterior trunk and tail, but as bilateral rows of cells in the posterior trunk.  In the head the dorsal stripe also avoids the midline, where over the brain a dorsal view reveals that it takes the form of an open posteriorly pointing V.  A side view reveals that the dorsal and ventral stripes join together at the tail tip into another posterior-pointing V that is rather completely filled with pigment, save for a small ventral gap.  Further, a second component of the ventral stripe now forms in the tail medially to the earlier stripe, and associated with the caudal (and the axial) vein.  At this stage melanophores only sparsely populate this median ventral stripe, but by the early larval period the two parts of the ventral stripe will neatly frame the vein.  Over the yolk ball, the bilateral ventral melanophore rows join in the midline as a distinctive patch at the location of the developing swim bladder.  The lateral stripe along the horizontal myoseptum is now quite clear, and contains a small and variable number of melanophores (as described in detail by Milos and Dingle, 1978).  Xanthophore differentiation gives the head a very distinct but still very pale yellow cast <A HREF="figs/fig39.html">(Fig. 39A)</A>.  The dorsal aspect of the trunk and tail is a fainter yellow.  The iridophores are scattered over the retina, as earlier, but now many more appear, some arranged in a discontinuous ring of individual cells or small reflective cell groups around the lens, where the iris will develop.  Most long-pec embryos have other iridophores associated with the dorsal stripe in the tail, and occasional feebly reflective ones that appear on the dorsolateral yolk sac.  These foreshadow development of distinctive iridophore patches ("lateral patches") that flank the position where the swim bladder forms. 	<p>
The shrinking yolk sac makes the pericardial cavity conspicuous.  The vigorous beat of the heart easily shows that the heart tube is bending to bring the atrium to a position dorsal to the ventricle.  Nomarski optics reveal that the definitive six pairs of aortic arches are now all present, but typically at the long-pec stage not all of them are carrying circulating blood.  Generally, the more anterior arches, especially aortic arches 1-3, join the circulation earlier, but participation varies.  Circulation is now strong in most segmental vessels along the trunk and tail.  There is a single channel associated with each segment, but, as can be determined by following the course of the blood flow, an artery in one segment leading from the dorsal aorta alternates with veins in the adjacent segments leading to the axial vein.  There is no blood circulation in the pectoral fin bud until about 52 h, more consistently at 54 h.  At this point one can find the <b>subclavian</b> vessel looping around the bud at the base of the ridge, and without a clear distinction between the arterial and venous side of the loop.  The common cardinal vein on the yolk ball is fan-shaped, narrower at its origin and broadening more ventrally.	<p>
When at rest, dechorionated embryos are beginning to assume a dorsal-up body position.  Some come to rest dorsal-up upon completion of a swimming episode.<b>	<p>
Pec-fin stage (60 h)</b>:  EL = 3.3 mm, HTA = 55 degrees.  The pectoral fin now has a flat flange or blade.  The blade is confined to the distal part, where the ridge was earlier, and now it makes the distal part of the rudiment considerably wider than the base, opposite to the situation at the long-pec stage.  The fin is held back along the side of the body, and extends posteriorly to cover more than half of the yolk ball. <b> </b>Nomarski optics reveals the presence of actinotrichia in the pectoral fin, as well as continued differentiation of cartilage in the proximal part of the rudiment.  	<p>
A dorsal view reveals that the width of the head at the eyes, but not the ears, now exceeds the width of the yolk ball.  The taper of the yolk extension is more prominent and meets the yolk ball without a sharp angle being present where the two regions of the yolk cell join, such as was present at earlier times.	<p>
A ventral view shows that the mouth is open to the exterior <A HREF="figs/fig40.html">(Fig. 40)</A>, but not gaping.  It lies entirely behind the anterior limit of the eye at this stage.  Precartilage condensations are distinctive in the mandibular and hyoid arches, and short stretches of differentiating cartilage cells can be identified in these arches as well, particularly in Meckel's cartilage and the ceratohyal cartilage.  Jaws muscles are also differentiating.  The earliest mesenchymal precartilage condensations now appear in the first one or two branchial arches (pharyngeal arches 3 and 4), but probably distinctive cartilage cells are not yet present in this region.  The rudiments of the gill filaments now appear as shallow buds along the posterior surfaces of the anterior gill arches.	<p>
A partition is forming in the otic vesicle that will separate two otolith-containing chambers, ventral to the more well-formed semicircular canals.  In a side view with the dissecting microscope the gut tract can now be visualized along part, but typically not all, of its length. A lumen appears within the hindgut. 	<p>
Pigmentation of the retina is now so dense that, using transmitted illumination, its opacity nearly hides the lens.  Iridophores in the eye fill out a rather complete brightly reflective ring around the lens (e.g. <A HREF="figs/fig39.html">Fig. 39G</A>).  Other reflective regions occur outside of the ring, mostly as contiguous patches of cells rather than as scattered individual cells.  	<p>
On the trunk and tail, up to about ten melanophores occupy each lateral stripe <A HREF="figs/fig39.html">(Fig. 39C)</A>.  Where the dorsal stripe is bilateral, in the posterior trunk and anterior tail, the melanophores now neatly flank reflective iridophores present in the midline.  Bilateral patches of reflectivity, the <b>lateral patches</b>, also have formed on the dorsal yolk sac, just to either side of the median black patch marking the location of the developing swim bladder.  A few scattered iridophores appear elsewhere on the yolk sac, but only variably in a distinctive ventral median row that accompanies the melanophore <b>yolk stripe</b> at the same location.  Xanthophore development continues, producing a rich yellow color on the head, and a still somewhat paler yellow cast to the dorsal trunk and tail  <A HREF="figs/fig39.html">(Fig. 39C)</A>.	<p>
The heart is prominent, beating strongly, and full of circulating blood.  Blood flows in all of the aortic arches and through the subclavian loop.  The common cardinal vein no longer has a fan-shape, but remains narrow along its length, as it takes a direct course, anterior to most of the yolk, towards the heart.	<p>
Most dechorionated embryos now rest in a dorsal-up attitude and nearly always finish a bout of swimming in this attitude.  The contractions during the escape response occur so rapidly that one cannot resolve them by eye.<b>	<p>
Protruding-mouth stage (72 h)</b>:  EL = 3.5 mm, HTA = 25 degrees.  The mouth is wide open and it protrudes anteriorly just beyond the eye.  	<p>
The blade of the pectoral fin continues to expand, now extending posteriorly over most of the length of the diminishing yolk ball <A HREF="figs/fig39.html">(Fig. 39F)</A>.  	<p>
With Nomarski optics one can see gill slits, and prominent buds of developing gill filaments <A HREF="figs/fig42.html">(Fig. 42A)</A>, sometimes including a blood vessel that carries circulating blood.  Cartilage cells are distinctive in branchial arches 1, 2 <A HREF="figs/fig42.html">(Fig. 42B)</A>, and 5 <A HREF="figs/fig42.html">(Fig. 42C)</A> but not in branchial arches 3 and 4.  The primordium of the operculum extends posteriorly to cover the first or even the second branchial arch.  The first visible bone in the zebrafish, the transversely-oriented <b>cleithrum</b> <A HREF="figs/fig43.html">(Fig. 43)</A> now appears, superficial to, and at the boundary between the first two myotomes.  At this location, posterior to the otic vesicle and last pharyngeal arch, it extends ventrally into the pectoral region, where it serves as an anchor of the pectoral fin girdle.  Nomarski optics are required to see it at this stage; in the young larva it becomes more prominent.  Histological sectioning shows that the cleithrum is lined with osteoblasts, but these bone-forming cells are not easily visualized in the living embryo.  		<p>

A side view with the dissecting microscope now reveals the whole length of the gut tract behind the pharynx. 	<p>
Melanin accumulates in the patch overlying the swim bladder rudiment, making this region very distinctively darkened.  Iridophore coverage of the eye has expanded to more than half its surface, except for radial stripes, where black melanin shows between the golden patches.  Iridophores accompany each of the melanophore stripes, including the yolk stripe.  Shortly, the latter will become a rather solid reflective band. The yellow cast of the whole dorsal aspect of the body has increased, so that the hue of the trunk now matches that of the head. 	<p>
Circulation in the pharyngeal arch region is becoming more complex with the advent of gill filament development. A subintestinal vein (Reib, 1973) is variably present, ventral to the gut tract.

<H3>EARLY LARVAL PERIOD</H3>
By day 3 the hatched larva has completed most of its morphogenesis, and it continues to grow rapidly.  Prominent changes during the next day include the inflation of the swim bladder and the continued anterior-dorsal protrusion of the mouth <A HREF="figs/fig39.html">(Fig. 39G, H)</A>.  During the same time the reflective strips of iridophores brighten and lengthen, the ventral yolk band extending in both directions.  The gut tube drops more ventrally, where it can be seen more easily, and the yolk extension nearly empties.  Whereas during the hatching period the embryo is usually at rest, the early larva gradually begins to swim about actively, and moves its jaws, opercular flaps, pectoral fins, and eyes.  These developments produce swift escape responses, and herald respiration, the seeking of prey, and feeding.

Fig. 1.   Camera lucida sketches of the embryo at selected stages.  The animal pole is to the top for the early stages, and anterior is to the top later, except for the two animal polar (AP) views shown below their side view counterparts for germ-ring and shield gastrulas.  Face views are shown during cleavage and blastula stages.  After shield stage, the views are of the embryo's left side, but before the shield arises one cannot reliably ascertain which side is which. Pigmentation is omitted.<p>
Arrowheads indicate the early appearance of some key diagnostic features at the following stages: <b>1k-cell</b>: YSL nuclei. <b>Dome</b>: the doming yolk syncytium.  <b>Germ ring</b>: germ ring. <b>Shield</b>: embryonic shield.  <b>75%-epiboly</b>: Brachet's cleft.  <b>90%-epiboly</b>: blastoderm margin closing over the yolk plug.  <b>Bud</b>: polster.  <b>3-somite</b>: third somite.  <b>6-somite</b>: eye primordium (upper arrow), Kupffer's vesicle (lower).  <b>10-somite</b>: otic placode. <b>21-somite</b>: lens primordium.  <b>Prim-6</b>: primordium of the posterior lateral line (on the dorsal side), hatching gland (on the yolk ball).  <b>Prim-16</b>: heart.  <b>High-pec</b>: pectoral fin bud.

Fig. 2.   Rates of development for embryos incubated at 25C (closed circles) and 33C (open circles).  <b>A</b>: Development showing selected stages through the bud stage (occurring at 10 h at the standard temperature of 28.5C).  <b>B</b>: Development through the end of embryogenesis, the protruding-mouth stage (occurring at 72 h at the standard temperature).  	<p>
The stages (<b>8c</b> through <b>b</b> for panel A, and <b>s</b> through <b>pm</b> for panel B)  are positioned along the ordinate according to when they occur at 28.5C, the standard incubation temperature.  Because of this presentation, a plot of development at 28.5C would be expected to yield a straight line passing through the origin, and with a slope of 1.0.  We determined this to be the case, in fact, by watching sets of control embryos developing at 28.5C during collection of the data for this experiment (not shown).  Notice in the figures that developmental rates at both 25C and 33C are also approximately linear, and that the slopes of the lines at each temperature are the same in A and B.  Hence developmental rate varies as a linear function of incubation temperature, and a simple calculation allows one to determine approximately when embryos developing at any temperature between the extremes will reach a desired stage of interest:<p>
<b>	<p>
HT = h / (0.055T- 0.57)</b><p>
<p>
where HT =  hours of development at temperature T, and h = hours of development to reach the stage at 28.5C, as set out in Table 1.   For example, computation of development to the 20-somite stage (occurring at 19 h at the standard temperature) yields 23.6 hours at 25C, and 15 hours at 33C.  These times not not differ significantly from those observed (23.5 hours and 14.5 hours).  	<b><p>
Stage abbreviations </b>(and hours of development to reach the stage at 28.5C in parentheses).  <b>8c</b>: 8-cell (1.25 h),  <b>64c</b>:  64 cell (2 h), <b>1kc</b>: 1k-cell (3 h), <b>d</b>: dome (4.3 h), <b>s</b>: shield (6 h), <b>75%</b>: 75%-epiboly (8 h), <b>b</b>: bud (10 h), <b>1s</b>: 1-somite (10.3 h) , <b>14s</b>: 14-somite (16 h), <b>20s</b>: 20-somite (19 h) , <b>p5</b>: prim-5 (24 h), <b>p15</b>: prim-15 (30 h), <b>p25</b>: prim-25 (36 h), <b>hp</b>: high-pec (42 h), <b>lp</b>: long-pec (48 h), <b>pf</b>: pec-fin (60 h), <b>pm</b>: protruding-mouth (72 h).	<b><p>
Method</b>:  Observations were on embryos developing from several natural spawnings, separated in each case into groups at each of the temperatures (25.0C, 28.5C, and 33.0C)  <u>+</u> 0.2C.  Each group generally included 20-30 embryos, never less than 6.  They were incubated in covered 150 ml beakers, in water baths regulated so that the temperatures within the beakers themselves were as desired.  We assigned a time point for a particular stage when we judged that the majority of embryos in a given group had reached that stage.  We used several defining characteristics for the stage, not just the most obvious one, and discarded malformed embryos.  Further, we took care to assure that embryos taken at intervals from the beakers for staging were not developing differently from control embryos kept separately without being disturbed.  This is because staging, particularly at the later time points, necessarily involves some handling of the embryos that could retard development (e.g., pipetting, dechorionation, tricaine anesthesia, mounting in observation chambers), particularly if done repeatedly.  In fact during these studies we observed that repeated anesthesia and rinsing (3 times over the period between 20 h and 48 h) significantly retards development: treated embryos looked 2-6 h younger than control embryos at the long-pec stage.<p>

Fig. 7.   Camera lucida drawings of face views during cleavage, showing lineal relationships of the blastomeres from the 4-cell stage through the 64-cell stage.  Blastomere names are according to cell lineage, and also indicate cell positions.  Each name represents two cells in the embryo, one visible in the figure and one that would be visible by rotating the embryo through 180 degrees about the animal-vegetal axis (i.e. only 2 cells are shown here at the 4-cell stage).  Cell L is to the left of the first cleavage plane and cell R is to the right at the 4-cell stage (Hence the designations L and R are not with reference to the future left and right sides of the embryo; see text).  Cell L divides to generate L1, by convention the sister closer to the animal pole, and L2.  L1 divides to generate L11 (closer to the animal pole) and L12, and so on.   The deep cells are not in the drawing for the 64-cell stage.  From Kimmel and Law (1985a).<p>

Fig. 13.   The dorsal side of the blastoderm in a midgastrula embryo, at the 75%-epiboly stage.  Nomarski optics.  We positioned the embryo with its vegetal pole up, slightly flattened it between coverslips, and focused to obtain this optical section roughly midway between the animal and vegetal poles.  Hence the view here is along the embryonic axis with midline structures at the center.  The cellular blastoderm, above, covers the yolk cell, below.  The EVL, vanishingly thin at this stage, is invisible (but easily visible in surface view).  The arrows indicate Brachet's cleft, the distinctive boundary between the epiblast and hypoblast.  The epiblast seems to be a multilayer of cells of nearly uniformly thickness, but actually at this time it must be forming a single-cell layered pseudostratified epithelium (Papan and Campos-Ortega, 1994).  The hypoblast is sandwiched between the epiblast and YSL.  Away from the dorsal midline (e.g. in the region near the arrows) the paraxial hypoblast looks to be a monolayer of cuboidal cells.  Specifically in the region of the midline Brachet's cleft is less distinct, the axial hypoblast is thickened, and it might consist of more than a single cell layer.  Later, axial hypoblast will contribute to both the mesoderm (e.g. the notochord) and endoderm.  Scale bar: 50 &#181;m.<p>

Fig. 14.   Fate map of the deep cell layer (DEL) at gastrula onset,  at the 50%-epiboly stage before formation of the germ ring and hypoblast.  The blastoderm now has the shape of an inverted hemispherical cup overlying the yolk cell (see Figs. 1 and 11B).  EVL cells contribute exclusively to the periderm, and no embryonic fates have been rigorously shown to derive from the yolk cell, including its YSL.  Hence all known embryonic fates derive from the DEL, and we do not know if there is mapping at this stage according to cell depth within the DEL.  Ectodermal fates map nearest the animal pole, mesoderm maps in a broad marginal ring, and endoderm overlaps this ring just at the blastoderm margin.  Not all organ rudiments are shown for the sake of clarity; e.g. the hatching gland maps to a dorsal marginal positon overlapping that of the pharynx. Muscle is widespread along the lateral and ventral blastoderm near the margin, and endothelium derives from a still wider mesodermal domain including all longitudes - dorsal, lateral, and ventral.  Stomach, pancreas, and swim bladder map laterally, near the liver, and smooth muscle maps near the heart.  The median and pectoral fins both map to or near the same ventral location.  The basic outline of the map is from Kimmel et al. (1990b); see also Kimmel et al. (1987) for ectodermal fates and changes along the DV axis, and see Stanier et al. (1993) for the heart.  R. Warga contributed unpublished fate map locations for all of the endodermal organs, smooth muscle and the fins.<p>

Fig. 15.   Development during the segmentation period.  Left side views, except where noted, with anterior up and dorsal to the left.  <b>A</b>: 2-somite stage (10.7 h).  Somite 2 is the only one entirely pinched off at this time, the arrow indicates its posterior boundary; somite 1 is just developing a clear anterior boundary at this stage.  <b>B</b>: 2-somite stage, dorsal view.  The notochord rudiment shows between the arrows, just anterior to the level of somite 1.  <b>C</b>: 2-somite stage, ventral view.  The arrow indicates the polster.  <b>D</b>: 4-somite stage (11.3 h).  Somite 1 now has an anterior boundary.  The optic primordium begins to show (arrow).  <b>E</b>: 4-somite stage, dorsal view,  focus is on the notochord at the level of the boundary between somites 2 and 3.  Note at the top how the brain rudiment and underlying axial mesoderm prominently indent the yolk cell in the midline.  <b>F</b>: 5-somite stage (11.7 h), ventral view,  focus is on the newly forming Kupffer's vesicle (arrow).  <b>G</b>: 8-somite stage (13 h).  The optic primordium has a prominent horizontal crease (arrow).  The midbrain rudiment lies just dorsal and posterior to optic primordium.  The segmental plate, developing paraxial mesoderm posterior to the somite row, is clearly delineated.  <b>H</b>: 13-somite stage (15.5 h).  Somites begin to take on a chevron shape.  The yolk cell begins to look like a kidney-bean, heralding formation of the yolk extension.  The tail bud becomes more prominent and Kupffer's vesicle shows from the side (arrow). <b>I</b>: 14-somite stage (16 h), dorsal view, and positioned so that the first somite pair is at the center.  Note at the top the shape of the brain primordium, at the level of the midbrain.  <b>J</b>: 15-somite stage (16.5 h). The arrow shows Kupffer's vesicle.  <b>K</b>: 15-somite stage from a dorsal-view to show the optic primordia. Kupffer's vesicle is also nearly in focus.  <b>L</b>: 17-somite stage (17.5 h).  The otic placode begins to hollow.  The yolk extension is now clearly delimited from the yolk ball as the tail straightens out.  <b>M</b>: 20-somite stage (19 h). The arrow indicates the otic vesicle.  <b>N</b>: 25-somite stage (21.5 h).  The telencephalon is prominent dorsally, at the anterior end of the neuraxis.  <b>O</b>: 25-somite stage, dorsal view.  The hindbrain's fourth ventricle shows at the top.  Scale bars: 250 &#181;m.<p>

Fig. 16.   Embryo length as a function of time of development (at 28.5C).  Embryo length, at any stage, refers to embryo's longest dimension.  Approximately no change in length occurs during the first 16 hours (through the 14-somite stage).  Tail and then head straightening produce a lengthening of about 125 &#181;m/hr between 16 and 32 h.  Then lengthening, due to growth, occurs at an approximately constant rate of about 20 &#181;m/hour through the remainder of embryogenesis (and into the early larval period; not shown).  We took the measurements with an ocular graticle, using a dissecting microscope.  Each data point represents the mean length in groups of embryos (generally 5-15; not less than 3) developing together.  Data from several separate experiments are included this figure. <p>

Fig. 17.   Somite morphogenesis.  Left side Nomarski views, dorsal to the top, anterior to the left.  <b>A</b>: The anterior-most somites (somites 1-3), at the 9-somite stage (13.5 h).  <b>B</b>: The posterior-most somites, somites 8 and 9, at the same stage.  The tenth somite is just beginning to form and appears as a circumscribed region, that might be called a "somitomere" (Martindale et al., 1987), within the paraxial mesodermal segmental plate.  Pinching off of the posterior border of this nascent tenth somite is not yet evident; we do not count the somite for staging purposes until pinching off seems complete.  <b>C</b>:  Myotomes 1-3 have developed from the first three somites (compare with A) and hence we give them corresponding numbers.  Prim-15 stage (30 h).  Transverse and horizontal myosepta are prominent, and differentiated muscle fibers run obliquely through the entire length of a myotome; their cross-striations are evident.  More posterior myotomes are much more prominently V-shaped (e.g. as in  Fig. 34B).  <b>D</b>. The last three somites at the 19-somite stage, compare with B.  Somite 20 begins to pinch off; notice that the segmental plate is more epithelial-looking than earlier.  The most anterior somite visible here, somite 17, is already taking on a chevron shape.  The somites lie just dorsal to developing red blood cells in the blood island, which in turn is just above the rudiment of the pronephric duct at the arrow (and which does not have a lumen at this stage).  The duct will open to the exterior just beneath the position that somite 19 now occupies.  However, as the somites develop into myotomes they elongate considerably along the AP axis:  This brings myotome 17 into the position above the end of the pronephric duct (and later the anus), by the prim-5 stage (24 h), and it brings myotome 15 to the same location by the end of embryogenesis.  Scale bar: 50 &#181;m.<p>

Fig. 18.   Idealized rate of somitogenesis (at 28.5C; from the data of Hanneman and Westerfield, 1989).  It is useful to remember that there are 18 somites at 18 h, and the usual increase is two per hour.  However, at first (between 10 and 12 h) three somites form per hour.   Count only the number of fully-formed somites to obtain the total.<p>

Fig. 27.   Morphogenesis of the otic vesicle.  Left side Nomarski views, dorsal to the top, anterior to the left.  <b>A</b>: The primordium (outlined by arrows) of the inner ear appears as a solid otic placode beside the hindbrain by the 9-somite stage (13.5 h).  <b>B</b>: At the 19-somite stage (18.5 h) the placode has hollowed out intthe otic vesicle.  The arrow indicates the boundary between rhombomeres 4 and 5 along the dorsolateral wall of the hindbrain.  <b>C</b>: Otoliths become prominent in the otic vesicle by the prim-6 stage (25 h).  <b>D</b>: Pec-fin stage at 60 h.  Morphogenesis of the walls of the vesicle have formed the primordia of the semicircular canals dorsally, separated from otolith-containing chambers ventrally.  By this time the vesicle is becoming housed in a refractile cartilaginous capsule.  The dark shadows tthe bottom are out-of-focus melanophores.  Scale bar: 50 &#181;m for A-C, 100 &#181;m for D.<p>

Fig. 28.   Tail development.  Left side Nomarski views, dorsal tthe top, anterior to the left. <b>A</b>: Overview at the 21-somite stage (19.5 h).  Notice how the primordia of the notochord (white arrowhead) and the spinal cord just dorsal tit spring from the tightly packed tail bud mesenchyme.  These tissue primordia lie medially tthe segmental plate paraxial mesoderm.  The arrow shows the pronephric duct near its end, just posterior tthe yolk extension.   <b>B</b>: Kupffer's vesicle, in the midline at the 16-somite stage (17 h).  The arrowhead shows the boundary between the primordia of the notochord (below) and spinal cord (above, not hollow at this time).  <b>C</b>: By the prim-5 stage (24 h) the tail bud is very small, and is surrounded by the tail fin primordium, the median fin fold.  The notochord primordium (n) has the characteristic transient "stack of pennies" appearance.  The spinal cord floor plate (f) is a distinctive midline cell row sandwiched between the notochord and the neural tube lumen (the central canal).  <b>D</b>: The tail bud disappears entirely (high-pec stage at 42 h).  The tail spinal cord narrows ta blind-ended tube with a simple cuboidal lining.  The cuboidal cells have cilia (not visible here) that are motile and protrude intthe central canal.  The notochord presents a neat developmental sequence of vacuolization, beginning with the stack of pennies stage at its posterior end.  A distinctive midline hypochord underlies the notochord.  Rays of actinotrichia are present in the fin fold that surrounds the entire structure, and melanophores (black) are differentiating.  Scale bar: 125 &#181;m for A, 50 &#181;m for B-D.<p>

Fig. 30.   Neural structures predominate in the head during the pharyngula period.  Left side Nomarski views, dorsal to the top, anterior to the left.  <b>A</b>: The prominent transverse brain subdivision at the cerebellar (c) primordium shows here at the prim-13 stage (29 h), separating the midbrain (m) and the hindbrain (h).  All but the posterior part of the midbrain is sculptured by a distinctive horizontal furrow that separates the midbrain (or optic) tectum (dorsal tthe furrow) and the midbrain tegmentum (ventral).  Rhombomeres give the dorsal surface of the thinner-looking hindbrain a lumpy appearance, although less sthan at an earlier stage (see Fig. 25).  The hindbrain's fourth ventricle shows above the hindbrain wall.  The eye, with the retina surrounding the lens, is well shown.  <b>B</b>: By the prim-25 stage (36 h) the brain walls thicken substantially, but the same subdivisions present earlier are evident.  At this stage rhombomere boundaries are indicated by doubled transversely oriented stripes (arrow), formed by developing glial fibers and bundles of commissural axons (Trevarrow et al., 1990).  Scale bar: 50 &#181;m.<p>

Fig. 31.   The pharyngeal arch primordial region at the prim-25 stage (36 h).  Left side Nomarski view, dorsal to the top, anterior tthe left.  The plane of focus is more lateral than for Fig. 30, to show the mesenchyme of the pharyngeal arch primordial region that fills most of the field of view between the otic vesicle (to the upper right) and the yolk sac (at the bottom right).  Transversely oriented grooves (arrowheads) cut the mesenchymal mound intseparate fields for the individual pharyngeal arches: The most prominent groove, at the arrow, subdivides the whole region into the anterior jaw-forming mandibular (m) and hyoid (h) arches, and the posterior set of 5 branchial (b) arches.	<p>
Pigmented melanophores show at the right, posterior to the otic vesicle, and at the left the posterior-most part of the the darkly pigmented eye is included.  The brain is at the top; the ventral part of the boundary between the midbrain and hindbrain lies just at the upper left.  Two cranial sensory neuronal ganglia, the trigeminal ganglion (t) and the anterior lateral line ganglion (a), show between the eye and the ear.  Scale bar: 50 &#181;m.<p>

Fig. 33.   Head-trunk angle as a function of hours of development (at 28.5C)  The head-trunk angle is the angle between a line drawn through the middle of the ear and eye, and a second line parallel tthe notochord in the midtrunk region (myotomes 5-10).  The head-trunk angle increases between 20 h and 70 h, as a consequence of straightening of the embryo.  Mentally superimposing the embryo upon a clock face, as shown in the lower drawing, is convenient way to estimate the head-trunk angle.  Set the trunk axis t 6 o'clock, and the head axis changes with developmental stage.  The head axis of the embryin the drawing (at the prim-17 stage corresponding t31 h) points to about 9 o'clock. <p>

Fig. 34.   The posterior lateral line primordium, and underlying structures along the flank of the pharyngula.  Left side Nomarski views, dorsal to the top, anterior to the left.  Three focal planes at the same position are shown:  <b>A</b>: The lateral line primordium (p), outlined by arrows, is in focus most superficially.  The right-most arrow shows its posterior, leading, boundary that we use to obtain the prim stage.  Out-of-focus transverse myosepta are visible (compare with B, where they are in sharp focus).  They mark off myotomes 10 and 11, that fill most of the field, and the anterior-most part of myotome 12, present tthe far right.  Myotome 12 underlies the leading edge of the lateral line primordium, hence the embryo is at the prim-12 stage (28 h).  The embryis slightly tipped so that the focus at the top of the field is more superficial, and the focal plane to the bottom is deeper. At the top, periderm cells are present.  These flattened cells, developing from the EVL, have a characteristic cobblestone appearance, with their most superficial face uplifted into fine folds or rugae.  The star shows one of two mesenchymal cells present in the ventral part of the field.  They lie deep tthe periderm, as does the primordium itself.  <b>B</b>: Myotomes (10 and 11) are in focus.  Cross-striations are apparent.  The horizontal myoseptum crosses the field of view at the center, the muscle cells at this location, muscle pioneers, are horizontally flattened such that they look thinner from this viewpoint.  Other fibers, those more dorsally and ventrally, run obliquely across the myotome, pointing towards the chevron apex.  <b>C</b>: The focus is at the midline, deep tthe myotomes.  From top to bottom the following structures are visible; the spinal cord's central canal (c) and floor plate (f), the notochord (n), and the dorsal aorta (a).  Scale bar: 50 &#181;m.<p>

Fig. 35.   Prim number as a function of hours of development (at 28.5C).   Prim number is the number of the myotome (equivalent to somite) that the leading, posterior end (see Fig. 34) of the posterior lateral line primordium has reached during its migration from the head to the tip of the tail.  The rate of migration is roughly linear.  Points represent measurements from individual embryos; data are pooled from different experiments.<p>

Left side Nomarski view, dorsal to the top, anterior to the left, at the protruding-mouth stage (72 h).  The quadrate (q) and more ventral and anterior Meckel's (m) cartilages of the mandibular arch meet at the arrowhead, the primary jaw articulation.  The adductor mandibulae muscle (a), that closes the mouth, runs ventral tthe eye.  It inserts on both of these mandibular arch cartilages.  The posterior end of the quadrate overlaps with the anterior end of the dorsal cartilage of the hyoid arch, the hyosymplectic (h).  The field of view includes only a small portion of the ventral cartilage of the hyoid arch, the ceratohyal (c).  The ceratohyal is the thickest cartilage present in the embryo; at first one might mistake it for Meckel's cartilage.  The first aortic arch (1) passes just anterior to the ceratohyal.  The second aortic arch (2) passes just posterior to it.  Dorsal to the same cartilage these two arteries join together to form the internal carotid artery (i).  Scale bar: 50 &#181;m.<p>

To avoid confusion, keep in mind that in fish (but not necessarily in tetrapod species that do not develop gills) branchial arch and pharyngeal arch numbering systems differ.  By convention, branchial arch 1 is the same as pharyngeal arch 3 and contains ceratobranchial cartilage 1 and aortic arch 3.  <b>A</b>: A superficial view of the four gill-bearing branchial arches (branchials 1-4) to show the clefts between them and developing buds of gill filaments (the arrowhead indicates a bud emerging from the posterior surface of branchial arch 2).  The third aortic arch (3) is in focus within the first branchial arch.  <b>B</b>: A deeper plane of focus reveals a gradient of cartilage development in branchial arches 1-3.  To the left, branchial arch 1 includes a long stretch of differentiated cartilage (this cartilage being ceratobranchial 1).

Aortic arches (numbered 4-6 in the figure) are in focus dorsally above the precartilage masses.  The fifth branchial arch does not possess an aortic arch (that would be numbered aortic arch 7, were it to exist).  Neither will the fifth branchial arch bear gills.  Scale bar: 50 &#181;m.<p>

<h1>CHAPTER 1<br>
GENERAL METHODS FOR ZEBRAFISH CARE</h1>
<H2>Fish Diseases</H2>
<i>(Source: C. Walker)</i>
<P>
For any large colony of fish, precautions should be taken to prevent the spread of epidemic disease.  The easiest strategy for combatting disease is prevention by minimizing contact between fish and water in different tanks. Avoid mixing fish from different tanks as much as possible.  Sterilize all equipment that comes in contact with the fish or tanks.  For example, use fish nets, siphons, and cleaning sponges on only one tank at a time and autoclave them before using them in a different tank.  Sterilize the water (i.e. with a flow-through ultra-violet sterilizing lamp) before adding it to the tanks.  Remove sick fish from tanks as quickly as possible.  Quarantine fish from pet stores before adding them to the colony (see Quarantine Room Procedures, page 1). Wash hands and arms thoroughly if they come into contact with tank water.  The two most common diseases that affect zebrafish are velvet disease and fish tuberculosis (mycobacteriosis).
<P>
<H3><a name="1">Velvet disease</a></H3>

Zebrafish are highly susceptible to velvet disease, Oodinium pillularis, a parasitic dinoflagellate algae.  This oval-shaped parasite attaches to the fish near the fins, especially the dorsal fin, and around the gills.  You can see it under a dissecting microscope.  When the parasite is mature, it drops off the fish and multiplies 60 times on the bottom of the tank.  These new parasites then reinfect the fish.  Fish with velvet disease have the characteristic behavior of rubbing their sides and flipping around in the corners of the tank.  As the disease progresses, fish become lethargic, the fins (particularly the dorsal fin) are held close to the body, and the fish stop producing eggs.  Most fish from pet stores or dealers carry velvet disease.
<p>
<H4>Symptoms of velvet disease:</H4>
	<UL>
	<LI>rubbing behavior
	<LI>lethargy
	<LI>fins held close to the body
	<li>parasites near fins and gills
</ul><p>
Although velvet disease is extremely contagious, it can be cured with minimal damage to the fish using a 3-day treatment with Atabrine (Quinacrine hydrochloride).<p>
<H4>Treatment for velvet disease:</H4>
<DIR>
	<LI>Day 1
		<UL>
		<LI>Turn off incoming water.	
		<LI>Slowly drip 2 liters of sea salts into an infected 10-gallon tank.
		<LI>Add 3.3 ml of the Atabrine stock solution.
	</UL><BR>
	<LI>Day 2 
		<UL>
		<LI>Add 3.3 ml Atabrine stock.
	</UL><BR>
	<LI>Day 3
		<DIR>
		<LI>Add another 3.3 ml Atabrine stock for a total of 9.9 ml.
		<LI>At the end of the 3-day period, clean the bottom of the tank thoroughly and slowly dilute out the salt and the Atabrine with fresh water.  
		<LI>Continue cleaning the bottom of the tank daily for several days.
	</DIR>
<LI>Solutions:
<ul>
	<li>Atabrine Stock:10 mg/ml dH2O. Store in light tight bottle.
	<li>Salt Stock: 20 tablespoons (280 g) Instant Ocean Sea Salts (Aquarium Systems, Inc.) dissolved in 2 liters distilled water
</ul></ul><p>
<p>
<H3><b><a name="2">Mycobacteriosis</b></a></H3>

Fish tuberculosis or mycobacteriosis is also a common disease.  The agent, Mycobacterium marinum, is a rod-shaped, gram positive, non-motile, non-spore-forming bacterium1.  Fish are infected by ingesting the bacteria in unpasteurized food or through abrasions in the skin.  Snails often harbor the bacteria.
<ul>
Symptoms of Mycobacteriosis:
	<ul>
		<li>listlessness; the fish may isolate itself from other fish and refuse to eat
		<li>emaciation; hence, the name "skinny"
		<li>skin ulcers
		<li>spinal curvature
		<li>pigment change
		<li>grey-white nodules in internal organs
</ul></ul>
Definitive diagnosis should be made by a pathology lab.  There is no known effective antibiotic to treat mycobacteriosis.  Some level of disease control can be obtained by eliminating sick fish, by sterilizing tanks routinely and all equipment that comes in contact with the fish or the tank water, and by reducing stress caused by moving fish between tanks or by changes in temperature, water flow, or feeding regimen.
<p>
A word of caution regarding fish tuberculosis:  Some cases of transfer of fish tuberculosis to humans has been documented.  Precautions should be taken by wearing disposable gloves and washing hands with betadine (providone iodine) when handling sick fish.  Persons with immuno-deficiency problems should not handle fish with TB.
<p>
Other diseases that occur less frequently include raised scales, tumorous eyes, and hemorrhages.  In these instances, remove the diseased fish as soon as they are seen and clean the tank.

<H3><b><a name="3">Intestinal Capillariasis</b></a></H3>

(Source: M. Pack, J. Belak, C. Boggs, M. Fishman and W. Driever)
<p>
Capillarids are thin and transparent worms that can reach one centimeter length. The eggs have a characteristic oval shaped appearance with a plug-like structure at either end and are visible in the adult worm, and the gut or feces of infected fish.  Photographs and a good description of Capillarids at
different developmental stages can be found in the <i>Handbook of Fish
Diseases</i>, Dieter Untergasser, Editor (TFH publications, 1989, p. 104-105).
Worms in the intestinal bulb of adult zebrafish are motile and can be easily
seen when the dissected gut, in egg water (0.03% Instant Ocean), is viewed with transmitted light using a high power (50X) dissecting microscope.  Outside the fish gut Capillarids are no longer motile.
<p>
A combination of two drugs, Trichlorfon and Mebendazole ("Fluke-tabs"; Aquarium Products, 180-L Penrod Court, Glen Burnie, M.D. 21061) has been
reported to be extremely efficacious for removing monogenetic trematodes from
fresh water fish.  Trichlorfon is an insecticide with anti-cholinergic activity
that is considered toxic to humans.  Mebendazole, a common anti-helminthic used to treat human intestinal infections, inhibits glucose uptake and is cidal for
adult helminths and embryos.
<p>
Use the dosage recommended by the supplier; one tablet per 38 liters once
trials to assess toxicity are completed.  Add the drugs as a slurry (100
tablets per one liter water-let stir 10 minutes) because they are poorly
soluble in water.  Repeat the treatment after 24 and 48 hours with a 10% water
change every day thereby increasing the effective concentration. Remove carbon filters during treatment.  Wear plastic gloves to avoid contact with water.
Reinstall carbon filters at 72 hours to remove the drugs from the system.
Repeat the treatment protocol at 10 days because the cidal effect of these
drugs on freshly fertilized eggs or dauerlarvae is not reported.
<p>
	Continue testing fish at regular intervals and retreat if necessary.

<H1>CHAPTER 7 - GENETIC METHODS</H1>
<H2>DELAYED <i>IN VITRO </i>FERTILIZATION USING COHO SALMON OVARIAN FLUID </A></H2>
<p>
 (Source: G.E. Corley-Smith, C.J. Lim, and B.P. Brandhorst, <i>submitted for publication</i>)<p>

 <b>Overview of technique:</b>
<p> 
For successful <i>in vitro</i> fertilization, zebrafish eggs must normally be fertilized almost immediately after being collected from the female. However, zebrafish eggs can be held in coho salmon <i>(Oncorhynchus kisutch) </i>ovarian fluid for periods exceeding 1.5 hours with high subsequent fertilization rates. Eggs can be successfully held for periods exceeding 6 hours, although the fertilization rate is compromised. For a general discussion of <i>in vitro </i>fertilization, please see 
<A HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt2/2.8.html">Embryo Production by <i>in vitro</i> Fertilization</A>.
<p>
To delay fertilization of eggs after they are extruded from the female zebrafish, eggs are held at room temperature (18-22C) in the ovarian fluid (the fluid that surrounds mature eggs) of coho salmon. In collecting ovarian fluid, contamination by broken salmon eggs, blood and water should be minimized. The female salmonid from which ovarian fluid is collected should be mature and ready to deliver eggs but should not be overly ripe with broken eggs and watery ovarian fluid. Ovarian fluid from a non-ripe females may be useable, but the volume of ovarian fluid from a non-ripe female is smaller. We collect ovarian fluid at a salmon hatchery.
<p>
As batches of ovarian fluid vary, we test individual batches of ovarian fluid. When a batch (ovarian fluid collected from one fish) is identified that allows for holding zebrafish eggs for 1.5 hours with high subsequent fertilization rates, we aliquot this batch into 1.5 ml screw cap microcentrifuge tubes and store frozen at -20C or -80C. Coho salmon ovarian fluid is robust and can undergo repeated freezing and thawing and can be left for several days at room temperature and still function. However, for optimal fertilization rates we suggest more careful storage.<p>
High fertilization rates can only be achieved when good quality zebrafish eggs are obtained. It is possible that females produce and resorb eggs on a daily cycle and eggs may be in peak condition for fertilization for only a short period of time. Some good zebrafish facilities routinely collect eggs in the first few hours after the fish are exposed to the light phase of the photocycle. However, some of our best eggs are collected later in the day. When we desire high fertilization rates, we perform the following time consuming procedure. Shortly after the beginning of the light part of her photocycle, the female is placed in a small tank with at least one male. The fish are observed and as soon as breeding activity commences the female is removed from the tank and squeezed for eggs. Good eggs are slightly granular and yellowish in color. Although not always completely spherical, the best eggs look full. The best batches contain few, if any, broken eggs and no whitish or withered eggs. The chorion of good eggs can be observed under a stereoscopic dissecting microscope to elevate up away from the plasma membrane when ovarian fluid is diluted with water. An elevated chorion indicates that the egg is no longer capable of being fertilized. Thus, we often test a few eggs from each female by adding water to them. Some of the batches of milt we view under the microscope include many sperm that have a short knobby tail. These sperm are usually poor swimmers and are suspected to give poor fertilization rates. We do not use batches of milt containing such sperm.<p>
Sperm held in sperm extender (recipe is provided at end of this article) at 4C for up to 8 hours are still capable of a low rate of fertilization. Thus, it is possible to collect sperm at the same time eggs are collected; however, we have observed that fresh sperm yields higher fertilization rates. Sperm can usually be collected at any time of day. When milt is diluted with water, the sperm become motile for about one minute, during which time they can fertilize eggs. The capacity of sperm to be activated with water can be monitored. Place a few ul of sperm in extender on a microscope slide and place a cover slip over it. Use phase contrast or DIC under high power to visualize sperm. Add a few drops of water along the edge of the cover slip, and observe if the sperm actively swim as the water streams under the coverslip.<p>
The order in which eggs and sperm are collected will vary depending on the experiment. Eggs and sperm are collected initially into glass microcapillary tubes. Gentle suction can be applied by several methods, including mouth pipetting.<p> <b>Collection of Coho Salmon Ovarian Fluid:</b>
<p> 
Coho salmon are terminal spawners; thus eggs are normally collected at hatcheries immediately following lethal cranial trauma. The euthanized female coho salmon is immediately hung by its tail and all the gills on both sides of head are slit to drain blood. Pushing a wad of paper towels under the operculum will help soak up blood and impede coagulation. After 5 minutes, dry the fish with a towel so that no water can drip into eggs and ovarian fluid when they are collected. Have an assistant hold the fish by its head and tail, with its belly downward over a clean dry bowl, and slit the fish from anus to the front of the body cavity. Eggs and ovarian fluid will fall into bowl. Release eggs from skein (ovarian connective tissue) and remove pieces of skein from bowl containing free eggs and ovarian fluid. Remove approximately 75% of ovarian fluid to 50 ml conical plastic tube. A non-abrasive kitchen strainer or colander, stainless steel or plastic, is useful for separating eggs from ovarian fluid. Handle eggs gently at all times to prevent breakage. Give the eggs to hatchery staff and put the ovarian fluid on ice. Back at the lab, centrifuge the tubes of ovarian fluid at 5500g for 5 min at 4C to sediment cellular debris. Remove the supernatant and freeze.<p>
<p> 
<b>Collection of Zebrafish Eggs for Delayed <i>In Vitro</i> Fertilization </b>
<p>
 1. Place approx. 100 ul salmon ovarian fluid in 50mm diameter petri dish at room temperature. It should form a small dome near the centre of the dish. 
<p> 2. Anaesthetize a female zebrafish. 
<p> 3. Place female belly up under dissecting scope, resting in a V-shaped slit of a damp sponge. 
<p> 4. Carefully dry belly and genital pore with Kleenex or Kimwipe.
<p> 5. Draw some of the ovarian fluid from the petri dish up in a silanized glass capillary tube (Kimax-51, Kimble Products Art. No. 34502, ID 0.8-1.1mm, length 100mm) and expel back into the dish. This is done to pre-wet the tube, reducing friction and lessening the chance of breaking eggs.
<p> 6. Squeeze fish gently and gently draw eggs up into the glass capillary tube.
<p> 7. Observe eggs under dissecting scope and assess quality by appearance.
<p> 8. Gently expel eggs into ovarian fluid on the petri dish. Try to avoid placing eggs on dry dish, which may reduce subsequent fertilization rates.
<p> 9. Return fish to water.
<p> 10. Place lid on petri dish to reduce evaporation. Although perhaps not necessary, we place black plastic sheets over the dishes to shield out light.
<p> 11. Eggs are held at room temperature until fertilization is desired.<p>
<p>
 <b>Collection of Sperm for Delayed <i>In Vitro </i>Fertilization</b>
<p> 1. Put 50ul sperm extender (see recipe at end of this article) into 500ul microcentrifuge tubes in ice.
<p> 2. Perform steps 2 through 4 as described above for female.
<p> 3. Squeeze fish gently and take up milt into a 2 or 5ul glass capillary tube (Drummond Microcaps) by capillary action. This tube does not need to be silanized.
<p> 4. Gently expel milt from one male into microfuge tube containing sperm extender which is on ice: typically 1-2 ul/50 ul sperm extender.
<p> 5. Gently swirl to mix sperm and sperm extender.
<p> 6. Store on ice until needed.<p>
<p> <b><i>In Vitro</i> Fertilization</b>
<p> <b></b>1. First remove most of the ovarian fluid from the eggs with a sterile pipette to a clean 0.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Later when time permits, centrifuge at 5500g for 5 min at 4C, decant supernatant and freeze. Ovarian fluid can be reused several times.
<p> 2. Spread 5-15 ul of sperm extender containing sperm evenly over all the eggs in the petri dish.
<p> 3. Immediately add 0.5 ml fish water and swirl very gently to mix.
<p> 4. After 1 minute, very gently add 28.5C water to 3/4 fill petri dish and leave at 28.5C for 1 hour. To promote gas exchange, make sure there is a space between top of water and petri dish cover.
<p> 5. After 1 hour, add 0.02% stock solution of methylene blue for a final concentration of 0.3 PPM. This helps to inhibit fungal growth. Make sure eggs do not touch each other, to reduce the spread of fungus that may grow on dead eggs from attacking developing embryos.
<p> 6. Place in 28.5C incubator.
<p> 7. After 24 hours, remove dead embryos and flush out methylene blue.
<p> <b>Updates to protocol</b>

<H2>PRODUCTION OF ANDROGENETIC HAPLOIDS AND DIPLOIDS</H2> (Source: G.E. Corley-Smith, C.J. Lim, and B.P. Brandhorst, <i>submitted for publication</i>)
<P>
 <b><i>Overview of procedure:</i></b>
<P>
 Androgenetic haploids can be produced by holding zebrafish eggs in coho salmon ovarian fluid, irradiating them with 10,000 R of x-rays, and then fertilizing them with normal sperm. To produce diploid androgenotes, the same procedure is followed as for haploid androgenotes, but is followed by inhibition of the first mitotic division. The first mitotic division can be inhibited by various methods. We use heat shock because it is easy to perform and control. We will keep updates of the protocols on our www zebrafish server. <A HREF="http://darwin.mbb.sfu.ca/imbb/brandhorst/zfish.html">http://DARWIN.MBB.SFU.CA/IMBB/BRANDHORST/ZFISH.HTML</A>. 
<P>
 <b>Equipment Required to Produce Haploid Androgenotes:</b>  
<P>
 1. <i>Irradiation source</i>. If using an x-ray source, it should produce at least 150 KV. We purchased a Torrex 150D cabinet style x-ray inspection system (Faxitron X-Ray Corp., Buffalo Grove, IL., USA. phone: 708 465-9729). Based on research we have performed using salmon eggs, we believe gamma rays should also work well for zebrafish eggs. 
<P>
 2. <i>In vitro fertilization supplies</i> (see 
<A HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt7/7.52.html">Delayed <I>In Vitro</I> Fertilization Using Coho Salmon Ovarian Fluid</A>)
<P>
 <b>Additional Equipment Required to Produce Diploid Androgenotes</b>:
<P>
 1.  <b>Hot water bath</b>. Set to maintain fish water in a beaker at 28.5+/-0.5C. Fish water is a term we apply to the water we use for raising fish. If desired, embryo water (refer to Recipe Section of this book) can be used in this protocol, wherever fish water is indicated. Since timing of the first mitotic division is temperature dependent, accurate temperature control of this hot water bath is particularly important for producing diploid androgenotes.
<P>
 2. <b>Second hot water bath. </b>Set to maintain fish water in a beaker at 41.4+/-0.05C. A calibrated thermometer is required for this accuracy (e.g. Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. 15041A). Inside both hot water baths we have beakers containing fish water. To promote heat transfer, the water in the beakers is constantly stirred using either a stir paddle or a magnetic stir bar. Temperatures should be measured in the beakers, since water temperatures in the beakers are usually slightly lower than in the surrounding water baths due to thermal loss from evaporation.
<P>
 3. <b>Heat Shocking Tubes. </b>To transfer eggs between hot water baths and allow for abrupt thermal changes to be applied to the eggs, we use uncapped 50 ml polypropylene conical tubes from which the bottoms have been sliced off and a fine mesh melted on. We use 153um pore size Nitex mesh on these heat shocking tubes. 
<P>
 <b>Collection of Eggs:</b>
<P>
 We collect eggs into approximately 100ul coho ovarian fluid located in the center of a 50mm diameter petri dish.
<P>
 <b>Irradiation of Eggs:</b>
<P>
 We irradiate eggs at 23 cm from the focal point of the x-ray beam of the Torrex 150D (shelf 8). Settings used are 145 KV and 5 mA. X-ray dosimetry indicates that at this distance and electrical setting, the x-ray output is 12.2 R/sec. Thus, we irradiate for 820 sec to achieve a total dose of 10,000R. Eggs are irradiated in coho ovarian fluid at room temperature. We attempt to have a monolayer of eggs with as thin a layer of ovarian fluid over eggs as possible. The Torrex 150D has a built in 1.2mm beryllium window. We use no extra filters, as they extend the time required to deliver 10,000R. If an x-ray machine with sufficient output is used, a 0.5mm aluminum or copper filter will help to selectively remove soft x-rays. Soft x-rays (low KeV) are suspected of causing more cytological damage than hard x-rays which are more selective in targeting DNA.
<P>
 <b>Fertilization of Eggs and Production of Haploid Androgenotes:</b>
<P>
 Proceed as described in <A HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt7/7.52.html">Delayed <I>In Vitro</I> Fertilization Using Coho Salmon Ovarian Fluid</A>.
<P>
 Embryos that subsequently develop and exhibit the haploid syndrome are putative haploid androgenotes. No embryos having diploid appearance should be observed.
<P>
 <b>Heat shocking to produce diploid androgenotes:</b>
<P>
 <b></b>1. Start timer as soon as 0.5 ml of 28.5+/-0.5C fish water is added to milt and eggs. This is time = 0.0 minutes.
<P>
 2. Place petri dish in a 28.5C incubator or on a shallow ledge in a beaker containing 28.5C water. After 1 minute, very gently add 28.5C water to 3/4 full petri dish. 3. At 5 min, transfer eggs to a heat shocking tube (50ml tube with net bottom) and suspend tube in beaker containing 28.5C fish water that is in water bath. Tubes should be suspended, not rested on bottom of beakers and should be left uncapped.
<P>
 4. At 13 min, transfer heat shocking tube containing eggs to beaker containing 41.4C fish water.
<P>
 5. At 15 min, very gently transfer heat shocking tube containing eggs back to 28.5C beaker and leave there undisturbed for 1.5 h.
<P>
 6. After 1.5 h, transfer eggs very gently into petri dishes 3/4 full of water and place in a 28.5C incubator.
<P>
 7. At 24 h, view developing embryos under dissecting microscope. At 24 hours, if many haploid and no diploid embryos are observed in the irradiated and nonheat shocked group, any embryos in the irradiated and heat shocked group that have a diploid appearance should be diploid androgenotes.
<P>
 <b>Assessing Putative Haploid and Diploid Androgenotes:</b>
<P>
 When attempting to produce diploid androgenotes, it is advantageous to have at least three groups of eggs: 1) normal diploid control group; 2) irradiated and not heat shocked (putative haploid androgenotes); 3) irradiated and heat shocked (putative diploid androgenotes).
<P>
 After collecting eggs, put a small group of eggs aside (control group) and irradiate the rest. Fertilize all eggs at same time. Part of the irradiated group can go into 28.5C incubator (potential haploid androgenotes), and the rest are heat shocked (potential diploid androgenotes). The control group is to ensure that delayed <i>in vitro</i> fertilization is working and to allow for the visual comparison of putative haploid and diploid androgenetic embryos with normal diploid embryos, as well as for genetic analysis.
<P>
 Two phenotypes that must be recognizable by the researcher are the diploid phenotype and the haploid phenotype. Haploid embryos exhibit what is called the haploid syndrome: shortened body, small melanocytes. The haploid syndrome can be seen at 24 hours as a shortened body phenotype (Figure 1). At 48 hours, the shortened body is easily noticeable and the difference in melanocyte size starts to become noticeable (Figure 1) and is pronounced by 96 hours (not shown). The development of androgenetic diploid embryos is initially retarded in relation to diploid control embryos (Figure 1). However, by the end of the first month, the androgenetic diploids achieve approximately the same size as the diploid control fish.  
<HR>

<HR>
We originally determined the irradiation dosage based on the Hertwig effect (Hertwig, 1911). To ensure that the irradiation dose is adequate to destroy the maternal genome in each experiment, we always include an irradiated and non-heat shocked group. No diploid phenotypes should ever be observed in this group. If no diploid phenotypes are observed in the irradiated and non-heat shocked group, then it is likely that diploid phenotypes in the irradiated and heat shocked group are androgenetic diploids.
<P>
 Confirmation of exclusive paternal inheritance requires investigating the inheritance of parentally polymorphic DNA markers to putative androgenetic progeny. The lack of homozygous maternally specific markers in the progeny is strong evidence supporting sole paternal inheritance, although it does not rule out the possibility of some maternal leakage.

<p>
5. Add 4 ul DNAse and incubate 30 min at 37C
<p>
6. Add 40 ul H20DEPC
<p>
7. Prepare push column device: 
	<ul>

	<li>Push probe through column.   
	<li>Push 70 ul TNE through column.

	</ul>
<p>
8. Precipitate with 0.5 vol 7.8 M NH4Ac and 3 vol 100% EtOH at -20C for 30 min
<p>
9. Wash with 80% EtOH
<p>
10. Redissolve in 25 ul H20DEPC
<p>
11. Remove 1 ul and analyze on a 1% agarose gel. To check for incorporation you can blot and stain the gel or just do a dot blot.
<p>
12. Add 76 ul HB4-H20 and store at -20C
<p>
13. First try 1 ul probe in 100 ul HB4 for <i>in situ</i> hybridization
<p>
<b>Comments</b>
<p>
If you get high background with this probe concentration after a short
staining time, dilute your probe.  If you get no staining at all, this usually
means the probe is not very good.  Make a new one.
<p>
T7 RNA-Polymerase from Promega usually works and will produce about 10 ug of RNA. In my hands T3 RNA-Polymerase from Promega for some strange reason often gives a very low amount of RNA. But with good templates like krx-20 you still get a very good probe. For difficult templates try T3 RNA-Polymerase
from Boehringer which appears to produce more RNA. All in all it is better to
use T7 RNA-Polymerase to produce antisense RNA.
<p>
Wizard Miniprep DNA can be used to make the templates.  Dissolve in H2ODEPC.  It is best to use 1 ug of template.  More than 2 ug does not increase the amount of RNA significantly and less than 0.5 ug is not very effective.
<p>
You can also precipitate with NaAc instead of NH4Ac.  If you omit the push
column and just precipitate with NH4Ac, to save time you will also get a good
separation of nucleotides. However, precipitation with LiCl only is not very
effective in removing free nucleotides. Hydrolysis of the probe is not
advisable because this reduces the sensitivity of the probes.  Probes from 0.5-2.5 kb can be used without hydrolysis. Probes longer than 1 kb work best. If you
want to combine different fragments of the same gene to get a stronger probe,
mix them before the push column step.
<p>

17. Embryos may be fixed for at least 30 min and stored at 4C in PBSTw
(add NaNO3).
<p>
18. Mount in glycerol.
<p>
Do not clear embryos in alcohol because Fast Red precipitate is purported to be
unstable in ethanol.
<p>
<b>Comments</b>
<p>
To detect two different RNA transcripts in whole embryos make one RNA probe using Fluorescein-UTP and the other using Digoxigenin-UTP. Both probes are hybridized at the same time and detected one after another in two rounds of detection.  The crucial step is the inactivation and removal of the first applied Fab-AP conjugate using the low pH step after the first staining round. Inactivation of the first applied Fab-AP conjugate by heating is not recommended, since incubation at 65C for 20 min or at 80C for 10 min causes fading of the red precipitate resulting in a weaker and more diffuse signal. In contrast, the blue precipitate darkens resulting in an increased background in the embryo and a nearly black yolk. 
<p>
Because Fast Red is less sensitive than BCIP/NBT (5-10x) the stronger probe is always visualized in red. Because the second round of detection is less sensitive than the first, stain the red first. Nevertheless, if necessary, it is also possible to do the purple staining first. Fluorescein labeled probes are slightly less sensitive than digoxigenin probes. Therefore the stronger probe is usually detected in red using a fluorescein probe. To detect transcripts of a single gene use just one probe and one round of detection with BCIP/NBT as substrate.
<p>
<b>Antibodies, Stock Solutions and Reagents</b>
<p>
<i>Preadsorption of antibody with zebrafish embryos</i>
<p>
Zebrafish embryos need not to be dechorionated. The number of embryos you use for preabsorption depends on the amount of antibody you want to preabsorb. The stages used for preabsorption should include the same or older stages you will use in your <i>in situ</i> hybridizations. 2-3 d embryos work well.
<p>
1. Fix embryos in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4C overnight.
<p>
2. Wash 4 x 5 min in PBSTw.
<p>
3. Store embryos in 100% methanol at -20C.
<p>
4. Rehydrate 1 ml of embryos by rinsing 3 x 5 min in PBSTw.
<p>
5. Transfer embryos to a 2.0 ml Eppendorf tube.
<p>
6. Homogenize embryos with a pestle and adjust to about 1.0 ml with PBSTw.
<p>
7. Add 10 ul antibody (final 1:100).
<p>
8. Preabsorb antibody by shaking at least overnight or store for a few days at 4C.  Spin down embryonic debris and sterile filter (Millex-GV 0.22 um, Millipore) supernatant.
<p>
9. Resuspend embryonic debris in PBSTw and sterile filter again.
<p>
10. Fill up with PBSTw to a final 1:2000 dilution of antibody.
<p>
11. Store preabsorbed antibody (20 ml) at 4C.
<p>
12. The antibody preabsorbed with zebrafish embryos works well also for
staining of <i>Drosophila</i> embryos.

<H1>CHAPTER 3 - EMBRYONIC AND LARVAL CULTURE</H1>
<H2><A NAME="3">Simple, Quick Methods For Raising Paramecia</A></H2>
(Source: R. Kimmel and S. Johnson)
<p>
<i>Paramecia multimicronucleatum</i>  can be obtained from Carolina Biological Supply or Connecticut Valley Biological.  This strain of very large paramecia promotes rapid growth of the fish larvae.  The following method of growing the paramecia is simple, quick, and very suitable for small, low-budget, fish-raising as well as for a large facility.
<p> 
Grow seed cultures in 150 x 25 mm plastic petri dishes at 28.5C. In addition, grow several small batches of seed cultures in other rooms at room temperature as a back-up in case of a (rather rare) "crash" in the fish facility's paramecia population.  These cooler cultures grow slowly and need care only every four or five weeks.
<p>
<b><i>Paramecia seed cultures</i></b>:<p>
<p>
To petri dishes:<p>
<p>
1. Add 175 ml double distilled water, about 10 boiled wheat seeds (animal feed wheat or health food store "wheat berries"), 1/5 of one 7.5 grain standard brewer's yeast tablet, and approximately 10 mls from a good clean young paramecia culture.
<p>
2. Stack the petri dishes 3 or 4 high and store at 28.5 in a lighted place. The cultures will be ready to use in 2 days and will keep for several weeks. One seed culture will start 10 new seed cultures or six 2-liter pots for baby fish feed.
<p>
<b><i>Standard paramecia recipe</i></b>
<p>
1. Fill each 2 liter amber mouse cage (actual capacity 2,750 ml) with 2 liters of system water
<p>
2. Add approximately 30 seeds of boiled wheat, 1/2 tablet of brewer's yeast, and 1/6 of a petri dish of paramecia seed culture
<p>
3.Cover and stack the mouse cages and store in the light at approximately 28.5.
<p>
The cultures will be ready for use in 4 days and will keep for about 3 weeks.
<p>
<p> <b><i>Growing small batches of paramecia</i></b>
<p>
1. Use glass finger bowls filled two-thirds full with system water.  
<p>
2. To each bowl add 8-9 grains of boiled wheat, 1/5 of one 7.5 grain brewer's yeast tablet, and 8 ml from a paramecia seed culture.  
<p>
3. Stack the finger bowls 6 or 8 high, cover, and store at 28.5C on well-lit shelves.
<p>
4. After 14 days, the paramecia are ready to feed to the fish larvae. Cultures remain useable and healthy for 3 weeks or more.

<H1>Chapter 2 - Breeding</H1>
<H2>Method For Maximal Embryo Production</H2>
                                (Source: E. Sullivan)<br>
<br>
        This method requires more work, but is especially well suited for
production of large numbers of embryos (upwards of 1000 embryos per tank)
once or twice a week.  A continuous supply of embryos can be obtained with this
method by adding more tanks of fish and rotating the schedule among the tanks. 
Although zebrafish reach sexual maturity in 10-12 weeks, the breeding fish should be between 7 and 18 months of age for maximum embryo production.  Keep males and
females in separate tanks with up to 8 females or 16 males per 10 gallon tank. 
The tanks should be cleaned at least once per day by siphoning, replacing about
1/3 of the water.  Feed the fish 2-3 times per day.  On the day before you want
embryos, 1-2 hr before the end of the light period, feed the fish and clean the
tanks.  Then transfer the males into the tank with the females at a ratio of 1 male
to 2 females (excellent results come from 4 males and 8 females).  Add marbles
to cover the bottom of the tank a single layer deep.  After the beginning of the
next light cycle, collect the embryos by siphoning the bottom of the tank (see <A HREF="2.3.html">Embryo Collection</A>).<br><BR>
        After collecting the embryos, transfer the males back into their tank, scoop
out the marbles with a net and clean them thoroughly by autoclaving or by
soaking them for 4 hr in a 10% solution of bleach followed by a 4 hr rinse in
running water.  Do not collect embryos more than two days in a row from the
same fish and remove the marbles for at least a week between embryo collections. 
Transfer all fish to new aquaria every 10 days and scrub and bleach the old
tanks.

<H3>The Zebrafish Database Project</H3>
<HR>
<b>1. PROJECT SUMMARY</b>
<p>
To obtain a comprehensive understanding of development, we need to
characterize the anatomical, physiological, developmental, and molecular
genetic properties of a wide range of different types of cells. However
systematic organization of this information into databases and methods for
rapid and easy access to such databases are still lacking; progress will be
greatly promoted by solutions to this problem.<p>
<p>
We propose to develop a relational database system and a widely accessible user
interface to this database for genetic and developmental information from
studies of the zebrafish.
Zebrafish offer special advantages for this type of analysis at 
single cell resolution.
 The zebrafish,
nearly unique among commonly studied vertebrates, contains large numbers of
identifiable cells, some of which have already been characterized in terms of
their detailed anatomical, physiological, developmental and genetic properties.
Specifically, we propose: <p>

To establish a database system for neuronal, genetic, and developmental
zebrafish data. This will provide meaningful ways of relating various 
properties thus facilitating an understanding of their functions.
To develop a WWW user interface to the database making it universally
accessible for data submission and queries.
<p>
To integrate genetic and developmental information, we must share
scientific results both within and between research communities.  It will
require the establishment of a collaborative group of labs to develop a common
data model and the seamless integration of independent databases into a single logical data resource.
<p>
As a first step, help has already been solicited from a small number of labs
that are willing to represent the zebrafish and mouse research communities to
plan and implement this database system and we have tested initial designs for
a user interface. The data for this system are already being generated by
separately funded research projects. 
<p>
The implementation of the database system will be coordinated with the mouse
and human brain database projects. This will aid in understanding relationships
among different vertebrates. Linking data describing synteny
relationships, mutant phenotypes and gene expression patterns among species
will provide tools for identifying new developmental genes and the molecular
mechanisms of disease.
<p>
Our goal is to design this database system as a model which can also be used to
organize information from other organisms. <p>

<HR>
<B>THE PROBLEM STATEMENT</B> <p> To obtain a comprehensive understanding of
embryonic development, we need to characterize the anatomical, physiological,
developmental, and molecular genetic properties of a wide range of different
types of cells and test hypotheses that relate these properties functionally: How
do genes regulate the specific properties of cells?  For example, in the case of
neurons, what determines the shape of a neuron and how does shape affect
function? Do specific genes regulate where the first neuronal axons grow?
Presently there is no straight forward method for obtaining all the data relevant
to answering these questions. 
<p> 
Information about these diverse properties of
embryos is being obtained from a variety of organisms. However, systematic
organization of this information into databases and methods for rapid and easy
access to such databases are still lacking; this hampers relating one property to
another. Moreover, this is a world-wide problem [Fox94]: to integrate information
from diverse labs in a timely fashion and to make it easily accessible to
everyone in a meaningful manner that will truly promote scientific discovery.
Such databases have been established for the gene sequence data generated by
molecular biologists, but none adequately integrate the image data types required
to characterize the morphology, antigenicity, and gene expression patterns of
developing embryos. Progress will be greatly promoted by solutions to this
problem.

<p>
The zebrafish is a vertebrate in which embryonic development can be studied with
very high precision; yet there is still a complete lack of a comprehensive
database for  zebrafish. Although zebrafish use in genetic research is relatively
new, the number of labs and the amount of data generated by these labs are
increasing at a phenomenal rate; the information already far exceeds the ability
of individual scientists to track and organize it (Table 1). Moreover, the
absence of a consensus for representing different types of data is leading to
inconsistencies in the way that data is stored by different labs. An organized
and concerted effort is desperately needed to establish a database for the
zebrafish community.<p>

<b>2. SPECIFIC AIMS</b>
<p>
We propose to develop a relational database system for developmental and genetic 
information from the zebrafish
and a user interface to this database accessible over the
Internet. Our goals are:
 a) to provide meaningful ways of relating developmental
information; this will facilitate understanding their regulation and functions. For
example, by knowing which genes are expressed along the pathway of a growing neuronal
axon, which mutations affect expression of these genes, and how the axon grows
in these mutants, we can learn whether specific genes regulate where the axon
grows.  
b) To aid in understanding relationships among different vertebrates, we propose to coordinate implementation of the database with
the mouse and human brain database projects. Linking data describing synteny
relationships, mutant phenotypes, and gene expression between species will
provide tools for identifying new developmental genes and the molecular
mechanisms of disease. 
c) We will design this database system as a model which
can also be used to organize information from other organisms.
As a first step, we have already solicited help from a small number of labs
that are willing to represent the zebrafish and mouse research communities to
plan and implement this database system and we have tested initial designs for
a user interface. The data for this system are already being generated by
separately funded research projects. We propose 2 specific aims:
<p>
1. <i>We will establish a database system for neuronal, genetic, and
developmental zebrafish data</i>. We will integrate into the database a variety
of different kinds of data including morphological (image), physiological
(graphical/spatial), genetic (graphical/spatial, text), and informational
(text) data. Use of a database system will allow meaningful queries based on
the relationships among various data, even data of different types. This
requires that we develop a logical data model which will define the various
data types and the attributes that describe them. This model will be developed
collaboratively by representatives from the zebrafish community, working
together with computer scientists and representatives from human, mouse, and
fly labs.  The zebrafish research community has already appointed a small consortium of labs (in Eugene, Boston and London) who are willing to serve as test sites for development of the database system. Each lab generates a particular type of data that will be entered and maintained in its local database. To make the data widely available to the entire community, we will establish database servers at these sites, linked via the Internet. Each site will implement the same logical data model. We will employ many labs to test the performance of the system; we will evaluate our progress and plan further development of the system at biannual meetings of the consortium labs.
<p>

2. <i>We will develop graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for creating,
maintaining, querying, and displaying database information. </i> We will
establish methods to allow world-wide access to the database system over the
Internet. We will develop a World Wide Web (WWW) and Internet access interface for entering data, submitting queries, and downloading data records to labs everywhere. The user interface will ensure the security, integrity and
compatibility of the data; users will submit new data to and query the database
using terms that are well understood by biologists.

<HR>
<b>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED WORK:</b>
<p>
Zebrafish offer special advantages both for characterizing embryonic development and for designing a database system. The zebrafish embryo, nearly unique among commonly studied vertebrates, contains large
numbers of identifiable cells, some of which have already been characterized
in terms of their detailed anatomical, physiological and developmental
properties (Table 2). In embryos, the zebrafish nervous system, for example, is relatively
simple [Kimmel90], all neurons are visible in living specimens [Westerfield93],
individual identified cells can be transplanted and followed over time with
fluorescent labels [Eisen91a,b], and gene expression can be be monitored and
altered in individual cells [Westerfield92]. Zebrafish also provide a unique
opportunity to apply genetic analysis to the study of development because efficient methods are available for generating, isolating, and
characterizing mutations [Kimmel89, Mullins93]. With the recent advent of a
genetic map [Postlethwait94], methods for generating transgenic zebrafish
[Stuart88], and large scale screens that have generated many thousands of
mutant zebrafish [Mullins93], it is now possible to study the functions of
particular genes. A final important
advantage of zebrafish is that their use as an experimental animal is still
new; relatively few labs are actively studying zebrafish, and communication
among these labs (provided by a newsletter and an Internet news server) is
excellent. At the first open meeting of the entire zebrafish research community
last spring, the pressing need for a unified database was recognized and there
was unanimous agreement to work together to establish an on-line database
system. Implementation of a database system will
significantly enhance our ability to study the functional relationships among
various neuronal properties.

Our goals also have significance for computer science database research: <p>
<UL>
<LI>Using the Internet to connect databases
<LI>Creating a logical data model through collaboration among research
scientists
<LI>Using the WWW client/server model for querying the data
<LI>Integrating multimedia into a relational database system for scientific
research
<LI>Developing a GUI interface with techniques for browsing and querying,
including image/spatial data querying
</UL>
<p>
We plan to use the Internet to create a system of database servers
located initially at two sites linked by the Internet to each other and to
public databases such as GenBank and MEDLINE. We will meet on a biannual basis,
and more frequently by video conferencing, to design the system. The
implementation of the database will be coordinated with the mouse and human
brain database projects. This will aid in understanding relationships among
different vertebrate nervous systems. Linking data describing synteny
relationships, mutant phenotypes and gene expression patterns among species
will provide tools for identifying new developmental genes and the molecular
mechanisms of disease. We intend the database system to serve as a prototype
for other scientific communities.

<TITLE>Zebrafish Database</TITLE>
<H3>The Zebrafish Database Project</H3>
<HR>
<b><i>Specific Aim 1. A Multi-media Database. </i></b>We
envision several kinds of data that will need to be included in these
databases:<UL>
<LI><u>Image data</u>:  neuronal morphology, neuroanatomy, antibody staining
patterns, gene expression patterns, anatomical and developmental atlases.
<LI><u>Text data</u>:  lists of zebrafish wild-type and mutant strains,
laboratory methods, information on DNA libraries and antibodies, gene protein
sequences, addresses of researchers, complete list of zebrafish research
publications, newsletter, general news.
<LI><u>Graphical/spatial data</u>:  zebrafish genetic map, neuroanatomical and
morphological summary diagrams, physiological records.
</UL>
Presently, we have examples of these three data types on-line. For example,
photos illustrating the zebrafish developmental staging series are presently
available as images on our existing WWW server [<a href=""></a>], as
are various text files of methods, descriptions of mutants, addresses etc.
Similarly, information about genetic linkage and the genetic map are available
as graphical/spatial data on our ACeDB server (contact ernest@lenti.umn.edu).
<p>
<a name="1"><b><i>Limitations of present systems. </i></b></a>A major limitation of our current
servers is that they can be accessed only by browsing, e.g. looking through a
list of information like the names of cloned genes. Ultimately we will want to be able to make much more
meaningful queries, like: What are all the genes known to be expressed by
neurons in the nucleus of the posterior commissure at 24 hours of development,
and what are the mutations known to perturb the expression of these genes?
Such queries, that search across data in essentially unlimited combinations,
require the full power of a relational database. Presently, such queries can be
done only by consulting several separate data lists at different sites, and
even if all the sites are known and consulted, it is unlikely that all the
relevant data could be found because the mechanisms for searching these data
lists are so primitive.

the nucleus of the posterior commissure (oval), stained with HNK-1 antibody

same nucleus [Akimenko95].
<HR>
<b><i><a name="2">Example of how the proposed system will work.</a></i> </b>We propose to develop a
database that will facilitate complex interdependent searches. For example, to
learn whether genes guide axons, we might want to know which developmental
regulatory genes particular neurons express as they differentiate. Thus,
descriptors of these neurons in one anatomical record (Fig 1, left) would need
to be shared with the corresponding brain region in another record which shows
patterns of gene expression, part of a completely different data set (Fig 1,
right). We might then want to know more about the genes that these neurons
express. From the expression pattern (Fig 1, right) we would want to find the
gene sequence (Fig 2, upper right), information that could lead into public
databases like GenBank. Knowing the location of the gene on the genetic map
could lead to identification of mutations affecting the gene (Fig 2).

the brain region of interest as it appears in the mutants (Fig 3).

In practice,
all these databases should be linked in a manner allowing information to flow
in any direction. For instance, the information flow outlined here could just as well proceed in the opposite direction, starting with a newly identified mutant
phenotype, mapping it to a chromosomal location, identifying the corresponding gene, and retrieving the
wild-type expression pattern of this gene and information about neurons in the
affected region. Descriptors should also be shared with related data in human,
mouse, and invertebrate databases.

<H3>The Zebrafish Database Project</H3>
<HR>
<b>Specific Aim 2. WWW Graphical User Interface.
</b>We will develop a set of tools for interacting with the
database via Internet. Our goal is to provide easy access to the database for
researchers with little or no knowledge of how the database operates. We also
want to make it possible for people everywhere to access the database over the
Internet using standard, inexpensive hardware and software. We presently favor
the use of a WWW browser like Mosaic or Netscape. We will design and build an interface to communicate with the database, initiating and receiving the
results of queries. The interface will pass this information back and forth to
the researchers through their local WWW clients using a series of forms. The
interface will also act as the arbitrator between the research labs and the
database ensuring uniformity of the data types and the assignment of proper
descriptors (attributes) to data records, thus enforcing a data model.

Researchers will use forms to interact with the database. To submit image data,
the scientist would first transfer the image (e.g. via ftp) to a temporary file
on the server. Then, after providing the name of the file and appropriate
password and account information, various attributes of the data record would
be chosen from pre-determined lists. For example, to submit the image shown in <a href="fig1.gif">Fig 1</a>, the form would be filled out as shown below, specifying that
it is a whole-mount stained with the HNK-1 antibody, labeling cells of the
diencephalon, etc. 
<hr>
<img src="fig4a.gif">
<hr>
After the attributes are checked by the user interface
program to make sure that they conform to the data model, the image would be
entered into the database. To search for particular data records, a query would
be initiated using a form as illustrated in the form below.
<hr>
<img src="fig5.gif">
<hr>
Various data attributes
could be combined to make a complex query. For example, <b>Development AND Morphology AND Probes</b> could be selected to bring up the Image viewing tool shown below. By filling in the form with specific attributes like HNK-1, Diencephalon, etc., the record shown in the form below would be retrieved.
<hr>
<img src="fig4b.gif">
<hr>
Additional tools will be developed for submitting and viewing the other data
types.
This type of database querying is novel because it is based on
graphical/spatial information within an image. Nevertheless, several groups are
starting to develop methods for integrating images into biological databases
[Fox94]. The Jackson Lab is coordinating the design of a database for mouse which will include 3D reconstructions and links to gene expression patterns [Ringwald94]. With these people as consultants we can build upon the tools they have already developed and ensure semantic compatibility of zebrafish data with those from other species [Robbins94,Fox94].

<HR>
<b>5. The Implementation Statement:</b><p>
We propose a "distributed" database system, ZfishDB, accessed and maintained over the Internet by the zebrafish research community. Here we describe the
implementation of our three aims. <p>
<p>
<b><i>Implementation of Specific Aim 1. A Multi-media Database. </b></i><p>
<b><a name="1">Limitations of Existing Systems.</a></b> The type of database system we
propose to implement must support image and spatialized graphical data in
addition to text information (<a href="prob.html#1">Table 1</a>). One strategy might be to adapt or
expand an existing system. We have reviewed two possible candidates and found
both lacking. First is our WWW server for the zebrafish research community at
the University of Oregon [<a href=""></a>]. It includes information on
stocks of mutant fish, developmental staging, addresses of researchers, a
bibliography of zebrafish research, etc. Although this system provides a
valuable service, it has significant limitations when compared to a true
database system. Because there is no data model, WWW client-server software (or
any HyperText Markup Language (HTML) based browser) offers only simple file
contents browsing, not querying. Additionally, all data must be tediously
entered and linked by hand in the HTML source files. The zebrafish community
needs model-based data organization and searching that only a true database
system will provide.
<p>
Second, we adapted the ACeDB system [Durbin92] used by the worm community.
ACeDB is a "home-grown" system specifically optimized for genetic map
information. ACeDB lacks the full power of a relational database because it
does not provide ad hoc querying like Structured Query Language (SQL
[Robbins94]). Moreover, ACeDB does not store images within its database
structure; the UNIX version can call an external viewer for image presentation,
however the image and viewer are both external to the system, only the filename
of the image is in the database thus precluding relational queries. Finally,
ACeDB is not a complete DBMS because it lacks standard DBMS features like
concurrency control, recovery, and transaction control.
<p>
<b><a name="2">Needed Approach:  An Object-Oriented Relational Database System.</a></b>Ê Because no suitable biological database systems exist, the DBMS
must come from a commercial source and support:
<UL>
<LI>User defined data types
<LI>A standard language for relational queries
<LI>Image, spatial and temporal data types
<LI>Security, query optimization, and data integrity
</UL>
To satisfy these requirements, we propose to use an Object-Oriented Relational
Database Management System (ORDBMS). A relational database system supports an
abstract data model that separates the logical data model from the low-level
data structures and forms the foundation for relational querying. Adding
object-oriented modeling [Gray92] to a relational database creates important
advantages including inheritance and class structures; and its user-definable
types, functions, and methods seem well-suited to the description of
multi-media biological data. Moreover, an ORDBMS will provide traditional DBMS
support for security, query optimization, data integrity and recovery.
<p>
<img src="fig6.gif">
<br>
Fig 6 shows a preliminary data model for the ZfishDB, a multi-media ORDBMS. The
hierarchical object structure provides a data representation that is easy to
communicate; we will develop the final data model collaboratively with the
database users. The ZfishDB stores images and text documents as natural types.
Although image and other multi-media data can be added to relational databases
by using uninterpreted Binary Large OBjects (BLOBs), we favor an ORDBMS because
object-oriented technology can easily add new data types (e.g. image, spatial,
video), to traditional relational databases, as first-class data types .
<p>
<b><a name="3">Proposed DBMS<//a></b>. We propose to implement the ZfishDB in an ORDBMS
called Illustra (Illustra Information Technologies, Inc.) which we have used
previously [Shoop94]. Illustra is the commercialization of UC Berkeley's
POSTGRES database research project under Michael Stonebraker [Stonebraker93].
Illustra provides direct support for all the database requirements we have
specified above; it has extensible data typing and allows traditional
relational data types defined in SQL-89 such as character strings, integers,
floating point numbers, etc. In addition, Illustra supports image, 2-D and 3-D
spatial objects, text and HTML document data types. The image data type
provides image and edge enhancement, edge detection and matching, and a variety
of internal image formats. The 2-D and 3-D spatial data types support point,
box, circle, polygon, and directed graph objects, efficiently accessed using
R(quad)-trees. The text document data type allows the storage of journal
articles, notes, manuals, etc. Functions are available for automatic indexing
of documents and for searching all words and phrases in a large text library
using a D-tree access method. We will use all these data storage types.
<p>
We also require the specialized software tools for handling image creation,
editing, and scanning provided by Illustra, which support X11 data viewers
(e.g. XVIEW, XV). Images may be manipulated in Illustra by scaling,
enhancement, composition of images into a single image, and other image
analysis. Illustra also allows us to write our own C and C++ routines to extend
the functions and methods of the data types as well as to create new data
types. Illustra provides an ANSI SQL-92 query language interface closely
aligned with the emerging SQL-3 standard for object-oriented relational
database queries. Illustra's SQL support provides querying for all types
including natural data types like images. Illustra also provides the standard
features of a relational database system that we require: concurrency control,
data recovery from transaction failure, transaction control,  reports and
alerts to the supervisor of arbitrary database events, user authentication, and
automatic backups.
<p>
<b><a name="4">Challenges and Limitations. </a></b>Our implementation will need to
define the object-oriented data model, modify and extend the data types for the
multi-media demands of the ZfishDB, and create GUI interfaces to update and
query the Illustra databases. The existing WWW and ACeDB servers will continue
to provide some level of data support during the transition period.

<title>Zebrafish Database</title>
<H3>Database System Architecture:</H3>

<img src="fig7.gif">
<br>
<B>Fig 7 </B> Functional architecture of the database system. Querying:  users interact with the WWW Server via a WWW Client Submitting data: Users submit and maintain data through the WWW Server; additionally, users at database sites can use the local Supervisor Module to enter and maintain their data without using the Internet. 
<HR>
<b><i><a name="1">The WWW Server and Clients.</a></i></b> All interaction between end users
(e.g. Neuroiologists, Fig 7) and the ZfishDB is via the <i>WWW Server</i>.
Users may use any WWW client (MOSAIC, Lynx, Netscape, etc.) on any platform,
like SUN, Silicon Graphics, IBM PC and Macintosh workstations, that can run
this client software. The <i>WWW Server</i> extracts user input, either
database queries or new data submissions, from the data stream transmitted by
the WWW client and passes it to the <i>Data Retrieval and Processing
Engine</i>. It then waits for the <i>Data Retrieval and Processing Engine</i>
to return an appropriate response, formatted as an HTML page. Forcing all
database access through the <i>WWW Server</i> achieves two important
implementation goals. First, it supports ubiquitous and uniform access; users
need only have a viable (i.e. capable of HTML form handling) <i>WWW Client</i>
to access the database. No special purpose software is required. Second, the
data cannot be entered or retrieved except through the <i>WWW Server</i>. This
enforces the common logical data model and dictionary.
<p>
We plan to use an essentially unmodified HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
server as the <i>WWW Server</i> for the ZfishDB. HTTP server software is
publicly available from both CERN and NCSA; commercial versions (e.g. Netscape)
are available as well. We will implement this module of the ZfishDB by writing
scripts to extract and decode user input, interact with the underlying
processing components of the ZfishDB, and return results to the client. 
<p>
<i><a name="2">Challenges and Limitations.</a></i> Submitting image data presents a
particularly interesting challenge given the WWW front end to the ZfishDB;
there is (currently) no support in HTML, the markup language interpreted by WWW
clients, for passing anything but text strings from a WWW client to a WWW
server. There are a number of possible solutions to this problem; to avoid
necessarily extending the HTML language and creating special-purpose WWW
clients for all possible computing platforms, we propose a low-tech solution.
The user interface allows researchers to transfer (e.g. using ftp) image files
to a special directory on the server. They then formally submit the data using
an HTML form (see <a href="fig4.gif">Fig 4</a>) specifying the image file name, and the interface
integrates the image and its corresponding descriptive information into the
database. We believe this will be a non-issue soon; requests to extend the HTML
standard to support a "file" input type are currently under review by the HTML
standards committee.
<p>
Another challenge arises because HTTP is a stateless protocol, based on
discrete data retrieval operations. Thus, as a query is constructed,
information is not maintained as the user moves from one HTML page to the next,
setting various constraints. In one solution, the system could embed (e.g. in a
TEXTAREA field) the state information within the HTML pages it dynamically
generates and returns to the user. This information would then be returned to
the system when the user submits the forms contained in those pages.
Alternatively, the server could create a unique "state" file for each user. The
name of this temporary file would be embedded in all transactions; after some
interval of inactivity, the file would be purged.
<p>
Another potential limitation is that the use of a single WWW server will affect
<i>reliability</i> and <i>performance</i> if the server goes down or is
overloaded by requests. The parallel processor on which the system will be developed and tested, will serve
as a backup for failures and the WWW servers at the other
database sites will provide additional access points to the system, thus sharing
the load.
<p>
<b><i><a name="3">Data Retrieval and Processing Engine</a></i></b>.  Queries or
data submissions passed to the system via the <i>WWW Server</i> are processed
by the <i>Processing Engine </i>(Fig 7). Processing differs according to the
user's action: a broad database query, a request for a specific record, or a
data submission.<p>
<UL>
<LI><i><a name="4">Query Processing:</a></i> For general queries, the constraints specified by
the user are processed into an appropriate SQL database query by the <i>SQL
Generator</i>. This query is then passed to the <i>Distribution Manager</i>,
which contacts a remote site and submits the query to the databases at that
site. Importantly, this component is based on a "lazy" strategy in the
interest of efficiency; the returned values are merely a list of record
(object) identifiers rather than the complete data records. In general, we can
expect the user to refine the search several times to narrow down the set of
returned records. Only when the user requests to view particular data items,
are the requested data retrieved. The results from the site is
passed to the <i>Results Integration</i> module and integrated
into a single result. Record identifiers from the database are augmented to
identify site of origin, sorted by data type, and then passed to the <i>HTML
Synthesizer</i> for formatting into HTML output. For instance, each record
identifier could be instantiated as a hypertext link to actual data.
<p>
<LI><i> <a name="5">Viewing a specific record: </a></i> After querying, further
constraining, and requerying the database several times, the user may want to
browse the resulting data set, viewing individual records. When the user
selects a specific record, a request is sent to the <i>Record Manager</i>,
which parses the request into a database request and sends it to the
<i>Distribution Manager</i> which passes it to the appropriate database. As
before, the returned record passes through the <i>Results Integration</i>
module and is then formatted (e.g. <a href="fig4.gif">Fig 4</a>) by the <i>HTML Synthesizer</i>.
<p>
<LI><i><a name="6">Submitting New Data:</a> </i> The <i>Processing Engine</i> also
supervises submissions of new information. Data extracted from the <i>WWW
Client</i> data stream by the <i>WWW Server</i> is passed to the <i>Input
Manager</i>, where it is checked for authenticity by verifying the submitter
name and password. Equally important, the data are checked for correctness and
consistency; although the rigid interface provides for syntactic correctness,
semantic errors are possible and must be detected. For example, if an image is
described as both a whole-mount and a reconstruction, the submission should be rejected and the user notified of the contradiction. If everything is in order,
the submission is passed to the <i>Distribution Manager</i> and submitted to
one of the site databases for incorporation. The site at which the data are
actually stored is irrelevant to end-users; the <i>Distribution Manager</i> can
heuristically decide where to place the data based on load at
individual sites, etc. 
<p></UL>
The bulk of the <i>Data Retrieval and Processing Engine</i> will be implemented
in C++ by developing logical objects corresponding to the various components
(e.g. <i>SQL Generator</i>, <i>HTML Synthesizer</i>, Fig 7). The <i>Processing
Engine</i> acts as an interpreter, translating the inputs received from the
<i>WWW Server</i> into various database access requests, integrating the
results, and formatting them as HTML output. We have extensive experience
[Fickas89;Douglas92] with the programming tools and techniques required to
implement such interpreter functionality. 
<p>
<i><a name="7">Challenges and Limitations.</a> </i> Implementing the <i>Distribution
Manager</i> is a key challenge. The <i>Distribution Manager</i> must interact
with the database components at the various sites, distributing database
queries and collecting the results. Because these interactions are primarily
file transfers between UNIX hosts, we propose to use a well-understood IP
protocol like UUCP. Alternatively we could use a custom network file server as
we have previously developed.
<p>
<b><i><a name="8">Supervisor Module. </a></i></b>The <i>Supervisor Module</i> provides tools to
assist the site supervisor in maintaining the system. For example, the site
supervisor might need to remove erroneous data from the system or restructure the database
in response to changes in the logical data model as determined by the zebrafish
community. The <i>Supervisor Module</i> automates integration into the ZfishDB
of data posted to public databases like GenBank and MEDLINE. It provides
bookkeeping operations for collecting and reporting database access activity.
We will also implement an auxiliary X-Window based interface to the ZfishDB
logically equivalent to the interface provided by the <i>WWW Server</i>. Thus,
data submission for local researchers can be streamlined, bypassing the <i>WWW
Server</i>. This is particularly sensible because we propose to place sites in
the labs producing the most data. 
<p>
We plan to implement most of the <i>Supervisor Module</i> in C++ using OSF
Motif to create the user interface. Interfacing with the Illustra database will
be straightforward because Illustra provides an API for C/C++.
<p>
<b><i><a name="9">Databases. </a></i></b>The database components of the ZfishDB store, organize
and provide access to the submitted data. During initial system development,
the ZfishDB will begin with a single database at the Eugene site. We will also
use a parallel processor in the Computational Science Institute for testing the client/server WWW software and as backup for the
database. Later, other sites will be added to expand the system and to
streamline submission of data to the database. The sites are
distributed geographically, making the ZfishDB is a "distributed
database", a single database system distributed over a number of nodes. Each
site in the ZfishDB implements the identical logical data model of the Illustra
database system.  The
homogenous view of the ZfishDB presented to the user is constructed by the
<i>Distribution Manager</i>. This architecture contributes significantly to
system robustness and performance:
<UL>
<LI><i>Performance and Robustness:</i>  Query optimization [Andleigh92] is
greatly simplified because related objects and tables are not distributed
across sites. This modularity of function yields similar advantages for
transaction management.
<LI><i>Security Risks:</i>   Because most transactions are mediated by the <i>WWW
Server</i>, there are only two users the database must accommodate, the <i>Site
Supervisor</i> and the system process associated with the <i>Distribution
Manager</i>. This greatly reduces security risks. 
<LI><i>Site Failure and Recovery:</i>  Because each site is independently
viable, network or site failures affect the system only by making query results
temporarily unavailable from that site. 
<LI><i>Expansion:</i>  New sites can be added easily; each becomes an independent
storage component.
</UL>
We expect system performance to be limited primarily by the bandwidth, traffic
patterns, and transfer rates of the Internet. This limitation will affect
primarily image data. We plan to keep most in-line images under 20k, allowing
users to download higher resolution images on demand.

<HR>
<b>Implementation of Specific Aim 2. WWW Graphical User
Interface</b><p>
Our reasons for using a WWW (HTTP) server as the primary user
interface to the ZfishDB, rather than a more powerful X11 based graphical user
interface include:
<UL>
<LI><i>Generic and ubiquitous access:</i>  Because a variety of users on a wide
range of computing platforms must be accommodated, we propose that all users
access the ZfishDB via a WWW interface. This reduces maintenance cost and time
because we need to maintain only one interface rather than separate clients for
each platform (e.g. Mac, IBM PC and UNIX). WWW clients, like Mosaic, provide an
easy to learn and use GUI which has become universally available and popular.
<LI>
<i>Support of non-technical, non-expert users:</i>  The end users of the
ZfishDB cannot be expected to learn the intricacies of composing queries to the
database directly in SQL, nor can they be expected to memorize the details of
the logical data model implemented by the system. Consequently, the system must
provide an interface that allows users to query the database in terms that are
well understood by biologists. 
</UL>
Although developed specifically for the <i>browsing</i> model of user
interaction, WWW clients allow two other models of user interaction,
<i>symbolic  </i>and<i> visual image querying.</i>
<p>
<i>Browsing</i> allows examination of information retrieved by stored links or
related by contiguity (i.e. consecutive pages). We intend to use the Illustra
HTML data type to store hypertext documents such as journal articles,
abstracts, etc. These documents will be loaded from the databases dynamically
into the <i>WWW Server</i> providing extensive document browsing.<p>
<p>
The recently developed form-filling mechanism in HTML provides a more general
interface for implementing a GUI version of the <i>symbolic querying</i> model
for database retrieval. We will use forms to construct queries from users which
are then processed into SQL queries to the Illustra database. One challenge of
this approach is that although conjunctive logical queries (<a href="fig5.gif">Fig 5</a>) will be easy
to interpret, full logical querying of SQL may not be possible (see
<i>Challenges,</i> below). 
<p>
An innovative aspect of the user interface we propose is <i>visual image
querying</i>. For instance, the user might ask to see all information on genes
expressed in some area of a currently displayed anatomical image, specifying
the area by pointing and clicking (<a href="aim1.html#10">Fig 1</a>). Although selecting coordinates
within the image is simple (using the HTML clickmap), mapping those coordinates
to biological regions (e.g. diencephalon) is non-trivial. Ideally, the system
would apply advanced image analysis to deduce the region of interest. Although
the Illustra "image" supports features like edge detection, we propose a
simpler approach;the submitter of the image annotates it graphically,
demarcating the various regions as polygons in an Illustra spatial data type
based on simple non-ambiguous landmarks identified according to a standard
anatomical model. As the image is added to the database, a spatial map of the
region boundaries is constructed based upon these standard landmarks. This map
defines the clicked regions which also have text labels that refer to other
information in the database [Chang87, Douglas87b]. We will write a dictionary
of terms describing this anatomical model which are semantically compatible
[Fox94] with those being developed for the human (Carlis letter, Section I) and
mouse ([Ringwald94] letter, Section I) databases. If we coordinate design of
the zebrafish data model and dictionary with their mammalian counterparts,
extensive querying across species may eventually be possible.
<p>
<i><a name="1">Challenges and Limitations.</a> </i>An important constraint that affects
interface design is the inherently limited reactivity of the WWW interface. As
mentioned above, HTTP interactions are based on discrete exchanges of
information rather than on the continuous, reactive connections available in
conventional computing contexts. In particular, the interface cannot
continuously and autonomously respond to user action; to get a response, the
user must click on a link or submit a form. Thus, the interface is limited in
its ability to react gracefully to ongoing data entry, graying out items when
they become inappropriate, offering context-sensitive help, etc.
<p>
Another limitation arises from the distributed character of the system. Because
query results must potentially traverse the Internet twice (database-to-system
and system-to-user), some delays will be inevitable. However, we have
purposefully designed the system to minimize network traffic; the "lazy"
retrieval strategy described earlier avoids downloading complete data records
until the user specifically requests to view them. We will also use small
low-resolution "thumbnail" versions of images for most transactions, providing
the user with the option of explicitly downloading the full-size image. With
these methods, the response time can be comparable to that provided by most WWW
servers today.
<p>
Embodying the full power of SQL querying in an HTTP interface designed for
non-technical users presents another challenge. For instance, in the interface
described in the <i>Solutions</i> section (<a href="fig4.gif">Fig 4</a>), only <i>conjunctions</i> of
constraints on the desired data can be specified (e.g. <b>brain
region=diencephalon AND lab name=UOneuroscience AND</b> etc.). This limitation
is pragmatic not fundamental; for advanced users, we can provide an interface
that allows direct SQL queries. We will need to find the best balance between
power and simplicity.
<p>
Finally, mapping spatial input to image queries presents a difficult challenge.
Several forms of visual image querying have been developed including a) Query
by Pictorial Example (QPE); the user formulates a query using a schema of
pictorial data in graphic and tabular form [Roussopoulos88]; b) Query by Visual
Example (QVE) where similarity retrieval is supported; the user draws a rough
sketch of image contents used as a visual key [Hirata92; DelBimbo94]. c) Visual
icon-based systems; the user specifies target image contents by placing icons
in appropriate positions of the graphic display [DelBimbo92; DelBimbo93]. We
propose to explore these innovative forms of image retrieval as future
alternatives to our current implementation using the HTML click-map. This
effort will be coordinated with development of the human (Carlis) and mouse
(Ringwald) databases which have similar goals .

<b>6. The Cost-effectiveness Statement: </b>
<p>
 The biological data for the proposed database system is already being generated by separately funded research projects in our labs and other zebrafish labs who have agreed to contribute data (letters, Section I). Considerable resources, however, are required to plan, design, and implement a database system that will aptly serve the entire research community (see Budget). 
<p>
To judge the cost-effectiveness of this particular solution, we can consider at least these three alternatives:  1) Do nothing at this point. 2) Establish several lower cost data servers, like the existing Mosaic server. 3) Establish a more traditional, single centralized system either by adapting an exiting system, like ACeDB, or by creating a new database system and custom GUI. 
<p>
Alternative (1) is completely unreasonable for the reasons outlined in the Problem Statement (above) including the amounts of data that are being generated at an increasing pace. Without adequate means for catagorization, storage, and retrieval, much of these data will be lost or forgotten. Neither solutions (1) or (2) will ensure data compatibility among different sites and neither provides true querying capabilities or a realistic way to make global searches among different data types at different locations. Option (3) precludes the advantages of distributing the databases to the sites generating data. Moreover, for world-wide access, we would need to write, distribute, and maintain specific client software for all the platforms used by the zebrafish research community to access the GUI. Although adapting an existing system might be cheaper than our proposed solution, none of the existing systems support true relational queries and none incorporate images with other data types. Most existing systems use X-terminals for the client software, whereas the majority of zebrafish labs use Macintosh or PCs and do not have access to UNIX machines. Finally, to ensure consistency in the data types, considerable funds will be needed to develop a common data model anyway; so why not implement that data model in a state-of-the-art database system?

GENERAL METHODS FOR ZEBRAFISH CARE</h1>

<H2>Availability and simple care</H2>
Zebrafish are available at pet stores throughout the world.  They can be most easily maintained in 10 gallon (45 liter) aquaria heated to 28.5C (above 31C and below 25C, zebrafish probably won't breed and development will be abnormal) with 25 fish per tank.  If you replace 1/3 of the water each day by siphoning up debris from the bottom of the tank, a separate tank filtering system will not be necessary.  Otherwise use a filter and replace about half the water at least once a week.  Tap water, aged a day or more in an open (heated) tank to release chlorine, is adequate although more consistent conditions may be obtained by adding commercial sea salts to deionized or distilled water (60 mg of Instant Ocean per liter of water, for example).  Adults should be fed 1-2 times per day with a variety of food (see below).  It is a good idea to clean the tank by siphoning after the second feeding.

To keep fish in good breeding condition it is best to feed them a variety of foods.  Feed manually ground dry or moist trout pellets (Ranger 1/4 inch brood food or Oregon wet pellets) as well as dry flake food like Tetra brand (available at most pet stores).  Add enough food to each tank so that all the fish get some and all the food is eaten within 5 minutes.  Feed adults at least twice a day although multiple light feedings allow the fish better opportunity to utilize the food.  The best possible food for breeding adults is live adult brine shrimp. Brine shrimp.i.Brine shrimp; eggs can be purchased at most pet shops.  To make baby shrimp, add 10 ml of shrimp eggs to 2000 ml of salt water (or Instant.i.Instant Ocean; Ocean, Aquarium Systems Inc.).  Aerate vigorously.  After 48 hr at 28.5&degree;C, filter the shrimp through a cloth, wash with fresh water and dilute into dH2O at a ratio of 1 volume shrimp to 3 volumes water.  Feed 1 pasteur pipette of diluted shrimp per 8 adult fish.  Other possible foods are daphnia, Drosophila and Drosophila larvae.  Beware of tubifex worms which may carry diseases (also, see

GENERAL METHODS FOR ZEBRAFISH CARE</h1>
<H2>Water</H2>
<i>(Source: M. Westerfield)</i>
<p>
Several different types of water are used for procedures described in the following sections.  These solutions have been adapted to balance ease and cost of production with the changing needs of zebrafish during their life cycle.
<p>
In general, adults can be maintained in tap water, conditioned by letting it set.  This depends critically on the quality of the local water source and on the demands for embryo production.  Poor water quality will adversely affect the health of the fish, their susceptibility to disease, and their breeding potential.  If there is any question about water quality, deionized or distilled water should be used to which a small amount of salts and minerals are added.  If an adequate supply of deionized water is unavailable, a closed-system which recirculates the water after purification can be used.
<p>
Embryos and young larvae have stricter requirements and should be raised in egg water.  Embryos removed from their chorions require additional calcium and should be maintained in embryo medium.
<p>
System (or tank) water:  water out of the facility's water system. This water is dripped into clean tanks and is used for setting up pairwise crosses.
<p>
Egg water:  Used for in vitro fertilization and raising young embryos.
<DIR>
Stock salts: 40 g "Instant.i.Instant Ocean; Ocean" Sea Salts added to 1 L distilled water
<BR>Egg water = 1.5 ml stock salts added to 1 L distilled water = 60 &#181;g/ml final concentration.

Embryo medium:  Don't confuse with "egg water" above.  Used in handling dechorionated embryos and storing young embryos in dishes.  This is basically 10% Hank's with full strength calcium and magnesium.

<H2>Quarantine Room Procedures</H2>
<i>(Source: S. Russell)</i><P>
Fish brought in from the outside world (i.e. not born in the facility) must be isolated in a quarantine room to reduce the risk of contaminating the existing stocks with infectious diseases.  The following procedures are designed to prevent the accidental spread of diseases from the quarantine area.<p>

1.  Only pre-authorized people are allowed in the quarantine room.
<P>2. All incoming fish are examined and, if necessary, treated for velvet disease.
<P>3. All new fish are to be checked daily for two weeks for signs of illness.  Any potential sickies are removed.
<P>4. Dead fish.i.Dead fish; are transported in a plastic bag and flushed down the sink in the quarantine area with lots of water.
<P>5. No live adult fish are to be moved from the quarantine room unless they leave the building entirely.
<P>6. Embryos obtained in the quarantine room (after the initial 2 week period) must be treated in bleach before leaving the room.  To bleach eggs, prepare two beakers of bleach solution, containing 0.1 ml of 5% sodium hypochlorite in 170 ml of system water.  Mix thoroughly.  Place the eggs in the first beaker, and allow them to stand for 5 min.  Pour off the bleach solution, and rinse the eggs with system water.  Allow the eggs to stand in system water for 5 min.  Place the eggs in the second beaker of bleach solution for 5 min.  Rinse the eggs with system water.  Place the eggs into a small disposable petri dish.  Eggs that have been properly bleached can be removed safely from the quarantine room.
<P>7. No equipment can leave the quarantine area without being bleached or autoclaved.  Equipment is transported, cleaned and stored in containers that are kept separate from the central facility containers and are labeled "Q-room".  No equipment is to be moved in or out of the Q-room without prior approval.
<P>8. Always wash hands (and arms) carefully in the local sink using antiseptic soap after working in the quarantine room. 
<P>9. When working in the quarantine area, assume that everything (including yourself) is contaminated.  Think about what you're doing!

<h1>CHAPTER 1<br>
GENERAL METHODS FOR ZEBRAFISH CARE</h1>
<H2>Cleaning Tanks</H2>
<i>(Source: T. Montgomery)</i> <P>
Siphon (cleaning by "vacuuming") the bottoms of all tanks at least once per week.  Use siphon tips with a length that corresponds to the size of the tank: tips for 5-gallon tanks are 12" long; the 10-gallon tips are 18" long; and the 30-gallon tips are 26" long.  Each tip is made of 0.5" I.D. x 1/16" Wall Plexiglas tubing (Port Plastics, Portland, Oregon).  Cover one end with a one inch tip of 3/8" I.D. x 3/32" Wall Amper Latex tubing at one end (VWR Scientific Co.). (See Embryo Collection,  for a diagram.)  The siphon tips, which are attached to the hoses, are the only parts of this apparatus that can be immersed in the tank.  Use each tip in only one tank and then sterilize it by soaking in a bleach solution (solution is 20 parts water to 1 part bleach) followed by a rinse in a pipette rinser.
<p>
Scrubbing (removal of algae from sides, front, and back of tank) is done on an "as needed" basis.  (If you can't see into the tank, it's past time to scrub.) Make scrubber handles from 0.5" x 1.5" Plexiglas Plastic (Port Plastics, Portland, Oregon).  The heads are made by sewing Scotch Brite Pads (United Grocers, Eugene, Oregon) with 20 lb test monofilament fishing line so they slip tightly over the scrubber handles.  Use each handle and head assembly in one tank only and then sterilize by bleaching as described above for the siphon.  The scrubber.i.Scrubber; heads can be autoclaved.  Use two lengths of scrubber handles.  The size for 5 and 10 gallon tanks is 0.5" x 1.5" x 16" and for the 30 gallon tanks use 0.5" x 1.5" x 24" handles.  Heads are the same for both size handles.
<p>
Tanks that are emptied of fish need to be cleaned and sterilized before another batch of fish can be introduced.  Drain the tank and remove it from the rack.  Remove and discard all tape, air pipettes, and siphon tube netting.  All other parts (lid, back, and water fittings) are kept with that particular tank.  Clean all parts with brushes and a scrub pad.  Clean the tank thoroughly with a scrub pad, taking care not to damage the silicon water seals on the inside (algae should be left if very gentle rubbing will not remove it).  Once the tank and parts are clean they need to be sterilized in bleach.  Place all parts except the lid into the tank and cover them with about 3" of water.  Add 1/4 cup (~65 ml) of bleach to a 10-gallon tank (125 ml to a 30-gallon tank; 30 ml to a 5-gallon tank). Wash the bleach water thoroughly around the inside of the tank by hand, using a pad, sponge, tank back, or other means to expose all inside portions of the tank to bleach.  Immerse the lid in the bleach water and then place it on top of the tank to trap the fumes inside.  Leave the tank overnight.  The next day, rinse the tank thoroughly with tap water and then rinse with dH2O.  Allow the tank to dry completely.  After drying, reassemble the tank, fill with system water, and let it sit overnight before adding fish.

<h1>CHAPTER 1<br>
GENERAL METHODS FOR ZEBRAFISH CARE</h1>
<H2>Shipping Fish</H2>
<i>(Source: S. Russell)</i>
<p>
Fish and embryos can be shipped anywhere around the world.  The following is a list of materials needed:
<ul>
<li>Styrofoam box with tight-fitting lid
<li>Matching cardboard box
<li>Plastic garbage bags
<li>One quart plastic bags (for adult fish)	
<li>Rubber bands
<li>Clean system water
</ul>
<p>
<H3><b>Packing adult fish</b></H3>

Line styrofoam box with garbage bag.  Fill quart bags half full of system water.  Use two bags, one inside the other.  Put the adult fish into the bags, and label the inner bag.  Tie off both bags individually with the rubber bands.  Be sure to trap as much air as possible in the bag.  Place the bags of fish in the styrofoam box.  Close the box, and seal it with tape.  Place the styrofoam box in the cardboard box, and seal it.  Address the box, and place a notice on it stating that the box contains live fish.  Be sure to include a return address.
<p>
<H3><b>Packing embryos and very young fish</b></H3>
Even very young embryos can be shipped, but a disadvantage with shipping embryos is that collecting the eggs and sending the fish must be carefully timed.  Since the fish must be fed beginning on the fourth day after fertilization, the embryos should be collected and sent on the day they are fertilized.  This is often impractical.  Instead, the fish can be sent the following day.  This still leaves three days for the fish to arrive at their destination.  Appropriate foods (e.g., paramecia) must be provided immediately upon arrival.
<p>
Fish that are to be sent as embryos should be placed in 250 ml tissue culture flasks (e.g. Falcon #3024; Fisher Scientific).  The flask should be filled with approximately 150 ml of system water.  The flasks are then packed in a styrofoam box for shipment.  Packing no more than 25 eggs per flask yields minimal loss of eggs in transit.
<p>
The same packing procedure can be used to ship young (~3-4 weeks) fish.

<p>
<H3><b>Domestic Shipping</b></H3>
It is best to use a well established shipping company to transport fish. Expeditors International, with offices in Portland, is an excellent company. These folks know the details of making plane connections and customs intricacies, and are very good at avoiding delays.  They also are familiar with our special needs, and have taken the time to tour the facility to learn about us.  Shipping fish through Expeditors is merely a matter of giving them a call and telling them where and when the package is to be shipped.  They have a courier pick the package up at the facility, and can even arrange to have the fish delivered to the door of the recipient (although it is usually faster to have the consignee pick up the package at the airport).
<P>

Attn: Amy Pratt
</address>
<p>
As an alternative, fish can be shipped by the US Postal Service Express Mail or by Federal Express.  Federal Express is not the preferred choice, because they often ship their packages in unpressurized compartments.
<p>
<H3><b>Overseas shipments</b></H3>

Shipping fish overseas is trickier because of customs regulations.  A letter stating that the fish are disease-free is almost always required.  It should be printed on Institute letterhead.  Official-looking stamps can be helpful in speeding through customs.  The shipping company will provide information  about the requirements for shipments to specific countries.
<br>Because overseas shipments take longer than those sent within the States, it is important to stress that the package contains live animals, and should be expedited.  Label the container that it should not be x-rayed.
<p>
<H3><b>Record Keeping</b></H3>
It is important to keep track of which fish are sent where.  Fish to be shipped should receive stock numbers, in the event that the information is needed in the future.  A record is kept for each shipment, and includes:
	<ul>
	<li>Name, address, and phone number of the recipient
	<li>Stock number, genotype, age, and number of males and female fish sent
	<li>Shipping particulars:
	<ul><li>	Departure, arrival times and locations
		<li>Airline and flight information
		<li>Cost of shipment
		<li>Shipping company used
	</ul>Any special instructions given to the recipient.
</ul>
<p>
<H3><b>Examples of Paperwork</b></H3>
The following are examples of the paperwork needed to send fish overseas.  A waiver needed by Expeditors International is also included.

GENERAL METHODS FOR ZEBRAFISH CARE</h1>
<H2>Keeping Track of Stocks</H2>
<i>(Source: S. Russell)</i>
<p>
An easy and efficient way to keep track of zebrafish stocks is to use a computer database.  The following is a description of a database which runs on a Macintosh computer and that is presently being used at the University of Oregon.  It is available on computer disk.
<p>The database was written using FileMaker Pro, an easy to use flatfile database program (Claris Corporation, Customer Relations, 5201 Patrick Henry Drive, Box 58168, Santa Clara CA 950528168, Phone (408) 7278227, FAX (408) 9873932).
<p>
<H3><b>The zebrafish database system</b></H3>
The database is composed of three separate databases (files) that interact with each other, the Zebrafish Database, the Tank Status Database, and the Users Database.  The Zebrafish Database contains most of the information about the individual fish stocks.  The Tank Status Database allows users to check easily the status, size, and location of any tank in the facility.  The Users database explains the various user codes used in the main database.
<p>
The Zebrafish Database contains the following fields:
<ul>
<li>ID - A few words identifying the fish. A descriptive name
<li>Tank # - Tank identification number 
<li>Stock # - Stock # of the fish 
<li>Status - Status of the fish and tank. Either "Alive", "Dead", or "Empty" 
<li>User code - Code identifying the fish user
<li>Unsexed fish - Number of unsexed fish in the tank
<li># females - Number of female fish in tank 
<li># males - Number of male fish in tank 
<li>Total # fish - Total of all fish in the tank 
<li>Birthday - Date of birth for the fish 
<li>Age - Age of the fish in days 
<li>Mutant allele - Identified mutant allele carried by the fish 
<li>Transgenes - Any genetic material added in transgenic experiments 
<li>Update - Date of last change to the record 
<li>Priority - Days since last change in the record number (now largely obsolete)
<li>Mom's s# - Stock number of mother fish 
<li>Mother's id - Mother's descriptive name 
<li>Dad's s# - Stock number of father fish 
<li>Father's id - Father's descriptive name 
<li>Comments - Any additional information goes here 
<li>Tank Size - Size of the fish tank, e.g. 5 gallon, 10 gallon, etc.
<li>Reason for death - Explanation for death of fish 
<li>Original # males - Number of male fish at ~68 weeks of age
<li>Original # females - Number of female fish at ~68 weeks of age 
<li>Original # fish - Number of fish at ~68 weeks of age
<li>Initial sex ratio - Original # females to original # males 
<li>Sex ratio comments - Comments on fish at this age
</ul><p>
The Users Database contains the following fields:
<ul>
<li>User code - Code used to identify user 
<li>Name - Full name of user 
<li>User status - Status of user, e.g. currently with fish group, or no longer with fish group<p>
</ul>
The Tank Status Database contains the following fields:
<ul><li>Tank # - Tank identification number 
<li>Tank size - Size of the tank 
<li>Tank location - Location of tank, e.g. which room
<li>User - Current user of the tank 
<li>Status - Status of tank
<p>
</ul><H3><b>Example of Zebrafish Database layout</b></H3>
<img src="1-1.gif">
<H4><b>Startup and Shutdown</b></H4>
Under Macintosh System 7, aliases of the database files can be created. An alias is a small file that points to the location of the original file on the disk. Open the alias, and the original file is opened.  Aliases of the database files are placed in the "Startup Items" folder within the System Folder.  The database is then automatically loaded upon startup of the Macintosh.  The database is kept running continually during normal business hours.  Users can browse and enter data into the database from the main machine, or can use other FileMaker Pro-equipped Macintoshes on a local network.  Upon system shutdown, the database files are automatically backed up to a floppy disk using the CP Backup program in the MacTools package (Central Point Software, 3203 S.W. 154th Terrace, Beaverton OR 97006-9937, Phone (503) 690-8088).
<p>
<H4><b>Using the database</b></H4>
<H5>Layouts</H5>
Information about stocks is entered and viewed using different layouts.  To switch between layouts, click on the button in the upper left corner of the screen and select a layout from the popup menu.  The Data Entry layout is best for entering data and viewing single records.  The List View layout is good for viewing many records at once.  The Extended List displays a slightly different set of fields.  The Full List is good for viewing complete records as a list.  The Historical Data layout contains fields for recording the original ratio of males and females in a tank, and a field for recording the reason for death when a tank entry is deleted.
<p><H5>New Records</H5>
To create a new record for entering data, you will most likely want to use the Data Entry layout.  Use the Layout button (described above) or select the button labeled "Data Entry" on the Welcome screen.  Select "New Record" from the Edit menu.  To duplicate the contents of the current record into a new one, select "Duplicate Record" from the Edit menu.  When using the Data Entry layout, these commands are available as buttons located to the right.
<p>
<H5>The Fields</H5>
In most of the fields, data is entered in the usual manner. However, a few of the fields operate a little differently.
<br>The Update field is entered automatically whenever a record is changed.
<br>The Tank Size field is calculated for each tank number in the facility.  This field cannot be selected for data entry.
<br>The &Sigma;Fish field becomes whatever is entered into it, unless either the female or male fields have values.  If either of these fields are defined, &Sigma;Fish equals females plus males (see "special note" below).
<br>The Status field is calculated automatically, based on the values in the Tank# and &Sigma;Fish fields.  The Status field works like this:
<ul>	<li>If Tank# is defined and &Sigma;Fish is undefined, then Status equals "Empty". 
	<li>If Tank# and &Sigma;Fish are both defined, then Status equals "Alive".
	<li>If Tank# and &Sigma;Fish are both undefined, then Status equals "Dead".
</ul><br>To change the Status of a record from "Alive" to "Dead", select "Dead this tank" from the Scripts menu.  You will be asked to make an entry in the "Reason for death" field.  When you have done so, press the "Continue" button.  All the numbers in the females, males, and &Sigma;Fish fields will be deleted.  The tank number will also be deleted.  A new record with the old tank number and user code will be created for you.
<br>The mutant allele field should not contain punctuation of any kind.  Do not use commas, dashes, or any special symbols.  An example follows:
<p>
Correct = b1 b4 b5<br>
Incorrect  = b-1, b-4, b-5<br>
<p>A search on the mutant allele field must be carried out in a special way.  If you wish to search on b1, you will get b1, but you will also get any other mutant alleles with the characters "b1", such as b16, b104, etc.  To avoid this, use the "exact" button when you make your Find request.
<p>
<H5>Find and Sort</H5>
When browsing records, remember first to filter the database for the records you want by using the "Find" command.  The Data Entry layout is best for this.  The Find command is in the Select menu, and is available as a button on the Data Entry layout. When the Find window is open, enter your search criteria in the boxes, and push the Find button located on the left side of the screen.
<br>Next, order the records you have found using the "Sort" command.  The Sort command is also in the select menu, and is available as a button on the Data Entry layout.  The Sort window will appear.  Select the sorting order desired by moving the field you wish to sort into the box on the right.  The data must be resorted each time you filter the records.  The panel on the left has information regarding the current sort status.
<p>
<H5>Network Etiquette</H5>
When opening a file over the network, please remember that the performance of the database will diminish.  As a courtesy to other users, please finish your work quickly.  If you receive a message to close the file, comply with the request.  Always close any files you are no longer actively using.
<p>
<H5>Special note</H5>
If the "&Sigma;Fish" field looks funny, it may be because you entered numbers into the "males" and/or "females" fields and then forgot to delete the original number in the &Sigma;Fish field.  To update the &Sigma;Fish number, delete the old number.

<H2>Simple Method For Steady, Low-
Level Embryo Production</H2>
                               (Source: M. Westerfield)<br>
<br>
        Zebrafish are photoperiodic in their breeding</H1>, and produce
embryos every morning, shortly after sunrise.  For continuous production of a
relatively small number of embryos (30-50 per tank per day) use an equal number
of males> (longer, slimmer, and more yellow especially on the belly) and
females (plumper and more silvery).  Control the day-night cycle</H1>
with an automatic timer (14 hr light/10 hr dark) and keep the fish well fed with
a rich supply of food like liver paste and live brine shrimp
(see <A HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt1/1.2.html">Food</a>,
Chapter 1).  If the
tank is in a room that must be used during the "night", cover it with a black
plastic drape to keep out ambient light and provide a separate tank light, inside
the drape, that is controlled by the automatic timer.  Be sure to check the
temperature of the water with the tank covered; you may have to adjust the heater
to compensate for the light.  Cover the entire bottom of the tank with a single
layer of marbles to keep the fish from eating the newly spawned eggs.  Each
morning, siphon the bottom of the tank for embryos as described in <A HREF="2.3.html">Embryo Collection</A>. 
If you don't need embryos for a time, remove the marbles to let the fish "rest"
and feed much less food.  Otherwise the fish will get fat and breed poorly.

                               (Source: M. Westerfield)<br>
<br>
        Collect embryos by siphoning them up from among the marbles at the
bottom of the tank.  Make the siphon from a plastic or glass tube (1 cm i.d. and
30-50 cm long) covered at one end with a piece of tygon tubing to protect it from
breaking.  To catch the embryos, direct the stream of water, started by mouth
suction, through a medium-mesh nylon net.  After sweeping the bottom of the
tank from side-to-side with the siphon, invert the net over a petri dish or finger
bowl filled with 10% Hank's saline (see <a href="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt10.html">RECIPES</a>,
Chapter 10).  The embryos will fall off the net when they come into contact with
the saline.  To help prevent mold, clean the embryos right away by rinsing them
several times with fresh 10% Hank's.  Remove feces and other residue with
forceps.  If problems with mold are still encountered, the embryos can
be washed at this point for 2 min with a 0.5% solution of bleach.<br>

<H2>Detailed Methods for Breeding Over Marbles</H2>
                                 (Source: S. Russell)<br>
<br>
<B><I><H3>Fish and marbles</H3></I>
<br>
</B>            At the onset of the light cycle, zebrafish will generally initiate
breeding behavior that results in the laying and fertilization of eggs.  In a tank
that has been marbled, the eggs collect between the marbles and escape predation. 
However, when no marbles are in the tank, the fish will rapidly consume the
eggs.  By eating the eggs, the fish are cycling the protein within the tank,
reducing the energy loss experienced in egg production and breeding behavior. 
By marbling a tank, the egg protein source is denied and energy loss to a tank is
extensive, which is why fish should be put over marbles no more frequently than
once per week.  On days when the fish are not over marbles, they should be fed
several times per day with protein rich foods to compensate for their energy
loss.<br><BR>
        Marbles are used to cover the bottom of the tank the night before the user
expects to get eggs from the tank.  By covering the bottom of the tank with a
layer of marbles, breeding fish are unable to eat the freshly laid eggs because the
eggs sink down between the marbles to safety.<br>
<br>
<br>
<B><I>Marbling a tank</I><br>
<br>
</B>            The fish should be fed approximately 30 min before adding marbles
to give the fish sufficient time to consume the food.  When the fish have stopped
feeding, it is important to siphon excess food and debris from the bottom of the
tank.<br>
        Add marbles to a freshly siphoned tank by slowly dropping them through
the water to the bottom of the tank.  The tank bottom must be completely covered
with marbles.  Approximately one liter of marbles is enough to cover the bottom
of a ten gallon tank properly.  Marbles should be added to the tank slowly enough
so that the fish can avoid being hit by them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<B><I>Removing eggs from a tank</I><br>
<br>
</B>            Remove eggs from the tank using a siphon (see <A HREF="2.3.html">Embryo Collection</A>).  To
siphon eggs, prepare a container to receive the eggs and water.  Place the
container near the tank, and below the water line of the tank.  To operate the
siphon, place the glass tube into the tank.  Draw water by mouth into the siphon,
and quickly place the flexible tubing into the container.  Water should flow into
the container.  Siphon the bottom of the tank in a methodical manner to collect
the eggs.<br><BR>
        Siphons are to be used once.  When finished with the siphon, sterilize it
by bleaching and rinsing.  Never use a siphon in more than one tank.<br>
<br>
<br>
<I><B>Removing marbles from a tank</I><br>
<br>
</B>            Marbles should be removed from tanks promptly.  After siphoning,
use a net to remove the marbles.  Clean them with bleach and extensive rinsing. 
<br>
<br>
<B><I>Cleaning marble eggs</I><br>
<br>
</B>            Clean eggs obtained from marble tanks either by rinsing with clean
system water to wash away debris or by removing the debris with a pipette.  To
rinse, pour off dirty fish water with as much of the loose debris from the eggs as
possible.  Add clean system water and repeat the process.  With each addition of
clean water to the eggs, the debris is diluted and suspended in the water so that
it can be subsequently poured off.  Repeat this process three to six times. 
Finally, use a pipet to remove any remaining debris.  This method is fairly quick,
but often does not completely free the eggs from debris.  In addition, eggs can
sometimes be lost while pouring off the water.<br><BR>
        An alternative is to use a pipette to remove debris.  Place the eggs in a
small petri dish or a finger bowl.  Using a squeeze bottle, deliver a stream of
system water into the petri dish so that the eggs and debris swirl around the dish. 
Note that the eggs will gather in the center of the dish rather quickly, while most
of the debris will swirl around the dish for a longer time.  Before it swirls in to
meet the eggs, use a pipet to remove the debris.  System water can be squirted
directly on the eggs to dislodge stubborn debris.  Repeat the process until the
eggs are clean.  Finally, remove any heavy debris that survived the swirling with
the pipet.<br><BR>
        Once the eggs are cleaned, transfer them into clean beakers full of system
water.  Then place the beakers in a water bath or incubator.  Records are kept for
each tank of marble fish.  The number and quality of eggs collected are noted,
as well as the number of eggs that are used. 
<br>
<br>
<br><B><I>Fish used in producing marble eggs</I><br>
<br>
</B>            Fish used for embryo production over marbles are for the most part
reliable at egg production until they are about 2 years old.  Generally, marble fish
consist of 8 females and 4 males in a ten gallon tank.<br>
<br>
<br>
<B><I>Feeding marble fish</I><br>
<br>
</B>            Because fish producing eggs over marbles expend more energy than
regular stock fish, it is important to provide them with a diet that compensates for
the energy lost in egg laying and breeding and that is ample enough to allow the
fish to develop the reserves from which new eggs will be produced and
nourished.<br><BR>
        In general, it is better to feed the fish several times (four to six) lightly
than to feed them once or twice heavily.  Multiple light feedings allow the fish
better opportunity to utilize the food sources and preserves tank water quality by
minimizing the amount of food left rotting on the bottom of the tank.  As a "rule
of thumb", fish should not be given more food than they can consume in five
minutes.  If fish are still eating after five minutes, they are probably being
overfed, so reduce the amount next time.  If, after five minutes, there is uneaten
food in the tank, and the fish are no longer feeding, the excess food should be
removed either with a siphon or a fine net.<br><BR>
        Because marbles protect eggs from predation but also collect and
concentrate feces and uneaten food, it is wise to fast the fish while they are over
marbles.  This reduces production of feces and provides a healthier environment
for eggs;  therefore, the feeding information refers to times when the marbles are
not in the tank.<br>

<H1>Chapter 2 - Breeding</H1>
<H2>Pair-Wise Breeding of Individual or Natural Cross Fish</H2>
(Source: C. Walker)<br>
<br>
        Embryos can be obtained from individual fish by pair-wise
breeding>.  This method is especially well suited for screening individual
fish for genes or mutations but is also useful for generating stocks of common
fish or even for producing a modest number of embryos for routine work. 
Successful breeding can be obtained in relatively small containers (i.e. 500 ml
plastic containers with lids).  This method can be adapted for more than one
breeding pair by using a slightly larger container (i.e. a 5 l mouse cage).  
    The Natural cross</H1> is a method of choice because it produces less
stress on the fish than in vitro fertilization.
    The onset of light in the morning is a major stimulus for zebrafish to breed,
however, the fish may be inspired to breed at other times such as when the lights
go off at night.  Setting up fish in the late afternoon enhances the chance of them
waiting until morning to breed.<br><BR>
    The resulting embryos are quite clean and usually do not require sterilization
because the containers and water are clean.  However, extensive washing of
embryos after harvesting helps prevent mold.
<br>
<br>
<B><I>Natural crosses over marbles:</B></I><br><BR>

1.  Place pairs or groups of fish into clean plastic
        containers (i.e. mouse cages) with several inches of fish water and
        a layer of sterile marbles covering the bottom. 
<br><BR>
2.  Several hours after the lights come on the next
        day, remove the fish and return them to their
        tanks.<BR>
<br>
3.  Siphon the embryos from under the marbles
        (see <A HREF="2.3.html">Embryo Collection</A>), either into a collecting net or into another container.
<br>
<br>
<I><B>Natural crosses in false bottom containers:</B></I><br>
<br>
        A simple container system can be fabricated for efficient transfers of fish
 and embryos.  Obtain two containers, one a little smaller than the other so that
the smaller one fits inside, but above the bottom of the larger container.  Replace
the bottom of the smaller container with stainless steel or plastic mesh that has
holes larger than the diameter of the eggs.  Provide clean plastic "grass" or
netting as a hiding place for the fish.  This increases egg production.<BR>
<br>
  1.          Place a clean smaller plastic container with
                                a mesh bottom into one of the larger
                                containers.
<P>
2.          Fill with enough fish water to cover the
                                mesh with several inches of
                                water.
 <P>
3.          Transfer a pair or a group of fish into the
                                container.
<P>
        4.          Several hours after the lights come on the
                                next day, remove the fish and return them to
                                their tanks.
<P>
        5.          Remove the top container and collect the
                                embryos from the bottom
                                container.
<P>
        Wash the plastic containers in a large animal cage washer.  Sterilize the
marbles by bleaching.<br>
<br>
<br>
<B><I>Appropriate Uses of Natural Crosses:</B></I><br>
<br>
1. To identify mutation-bearing individuals.<BR>
<br>
2. To make outcross or intercross stocks of mutation-bearing fish.  (Most mutations are carried in heterozygous parents.)
<DIR>
<LI> An outcross of a heterozygous fish bearing a mutation to a wild-type or clonal line would produce progeny that are 50%
heterozygous for the mutation.
<>
<LI> An intercross between two mutation-bearing heterozygotes would produce &#188; diploid mutant offspring.  If the mutation is lethal as a homozygote, then <em sup>2</em>/<em sub>3</em> of the surviving progeny are mutation-bearing heterozygotes; an enriched stock with an increasingly inbred background.

        3.  To make a stock of fish where a large number of parents is not
            required.<br>
<br>
        4.  To produce embryos for study.<br>
<br>
        An average of 50-60% of fish set up for natural crosses will produce
embryos.  Any handling of fish produces stress so it is good to allow a week's
 rest between natural crosses with the same fish.  Females can produce eggs in
a natural cross shortly after being squeezed for eggs in an in vitro experiment.

<H2>Embryo Production By <I>In Vitro</I> Fertilization</H2>
                        (Source: C. Walker and G. Streisinger)<br>
<br>
<B><A NAME="1"><I>Overview of in vitro
fertilization</A>:</I><br>
</B><br>
        Large numbers of synchronously developing embryos can be obtained by
<em u></em><I>in vitro</I> fertilization.  Maintain breeding males and
females on a daily schedule as described in the Zebrafish Breeding Schedule
for Maximal Embryo Production (page 2.4).  Gametes are expressed from
breeding adults by gentle pressure.  The sperm are maintained in Hank's saline. 
The gametes are mixed together in a petri dish.  When water is added to the egg-
sperm mixture, fertilization takes place very rapidly in 20 to 60 seconds.  After
1 minute, the sperm are no longer active.  The clutch of embryos is fertilized
essentially synchronously and develops synchronously during the early cleavage
stages if maintained at constant temperature.<br>
<br>
1.  Transfer the males and females into separate
            holding tanks during the late afternoon of the day before beginning
            the <I>in vitro</I> fertilization.
<br><BR>
2.  One half hour before "dawn" for the females, collect sperm from the males.
<OL>
<LI>Anesthetize the male fish by immersion in
                         tricaine (see <a href="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt10.html">RECIPES</a>, Chapter 10). 
                         They can be lifted out of the anesthetic with a plastic
                         spoon.
<LI>Rinse in fish water, and place belly up in a slit
                         in a damp sponge.  
<LI>Gently blot the genital region with a kimwipe
                         so that no water is present (<B>very important:</B>
                         water activates sperm).
<LI>Stroke the sides of the fish gently but firmly
                         with smooth (Millipore) forceps.  
<LI>As the milky sperm come out of the genital
                         pore, collect them in a microcapillary using gentle suction. 
<LI>Pool the sperm from several males in ice-cold,
                full-strength Hank's saline.  Sperm from 5-10 males is
                adequate for fertilization of several hundred eggs.  Sperm in
                cold Hanks's will continue to fertilize eggs efficiently for up to
                90 minutes.  "Eyeball" the concentration of sperm, collecting
                enough to make a cloudy suspension.</OL>
 3.  When the normal light cycle begins in the morning,
            start collecting eggs. 
<OL>
<LI>Anesthetize a female in
                tricaine.
<LI>Rinse in fish water and blot "damp-dry" on a
                paper towel.  Excess water will swell the eggs and prevent
                fertilization.
<LI>Place the female in a 35 mm plastic petri dish
                and with damp (not wet) fingers, press gently but firmly on the
                belly.  If she is prepared to lay eggs, they will come out quite
                easily.
<LI>Gather the eggs with a spatula and return the
                female to water.  Good eggs are a yellowish, translucent color,
                whereas eggs that have remained in the female too long are
                white and watery (see below).  To ensure getting good eggs,
                collect them during the first 90 min after
                "dawn".</OL>
4.  Fertilize the eggs.
<OL>
<LI>Add 30-50 &#181;l of the sperm suspension in
                Hank's to the eggs.
<LI>Mix gently.
<LI>Add about 0.5-0.75 ml of system water and
                after 1-2 minutes, add 2 mls more water.  The actual time of
                fertilization is when the first water is added to the eggs. 
                Typically, 60-90% of the eggs are fertilized in an <I>in
                vitro</I> cross.
</OL>
    Depending on health and unknown factors, females will produce:<DIR>
<LI><I>good eggs</I> (slightly
                yellowish, granular-looking eggs);
                
<LI><I>bad eggs </I> (eggs already
                broken down, whitish and rather like baby cereal);
                
<LI><I>mixed eggs</I> (some good
                eggs mixed with bad eggs);
                and
<LI><I>no
                eggs</I><br>
</DIR>
        It is possible that females produce and reabsorb their eggs every day
and the majority of females are synchronized to lay their eggs at
"dawn".
        After being used in an <I>in vitro</I> experiment, males should be
rested for 3 weeks and females rested for 4 weeks before being squeezed again. 
They may be used for natural crosses during that rest time.<br><BR>
        Occasionally fish die in an <I>in vitro</I> experiment.  Care should
be taken not to leave fish in tricaine for too long.  Sometimes fish can be revived
from too long exposure to tricaine by irrigating their gills with water.  Also, extra
care should be taken not to damage the gills.  Handling fish "front-to-back" when
using spoons and spatulas is helpful.  One characteristic of sick fish is that their
gills hemorrhage easily and the fish die after exposure to tricaine.
<A NAME="2"><I><H3>General Procedures and Overview</H3></I></A></B>    <B>Why Do We Squeeze?</B> <br>
<br>
1.  To obtain large numbers of
            synchronously developing embryos. (Average
            clutch size: 100 embryos)<BR>
<br>
2.  To obtain haploid embryos, such as when
            identifying heterozygous mutants.<br>
<br>
        3.  To obtain embryos for Early Pressure. <br>
<br>
        4.  To obtain embryos for Heat Shock. <br>
 <br>
    <B>Setting Up For A Squeezing Experiment</B> <br>
<br>
        1.  Set up is done after 3:30 p.m. the afternoon before the experiment.
            <br>
<br>
        2.  Tanks of prospective fish for squeezing are chosen by:  <DIR>
<LI>Appearance of fish: Females should look large and fat in the belly. Males should look yellow and spry.
<LI>Elapsed time since fish have been squeezed: Fish should not be squeezed more than once/month.  Longer intervals between squeezing are better. 
</DIR>
        3.  Fish are separated during the night in
            holding tanks.  Males are put into tanks on a light cycle
            &#189; hour earlier than females to allow time for
            obtaining sperm in the morning.<br>
<br>
        4.  Materials to gather:<br>

<LI>Stereo microscope 
<LI>Sperm collection apparatus 
<LI>20 ml beaker of Hank's solution
<LI>Finger bowl with fish water
<LI>Lamp

<LI>Male fish 
<LI>A fish net 
</DIR>
    <B>Preparation</B><br>
<br>
        1.  Estimate the number of egg clutches to be obtained. <br>
<br>
        2.  Measure 0.05 ml of Hank's for every clutch of eggs anticipated.<br>
<br>
        3.  Put the measured Hank's in the small test
            tube, cover with cork and put in ice.<br>
<br>
        4.  Put some of the remaining Hank's solution
            into the 10 ml beaker.<br>
<br>
        5.  Put the capillary tube of the sperm
            collecting apparatus into the Hank's solution in the 10 ml
            beaker when not collecting sperm during the
            procedure.<br>
<br>
    <B>Procedure</B><br>
<br>
        1.  Remove two fish from the plastic holding
            container with net and place into the 250 ml beaker
            containing the tricaine solution.  Repeat this for the other
            250 ml beaker.<br>
<br>
        2.  When gill movement has slowed, remove
            one fish with the plastic spoon.<br>
<br>
        3.  Rinse this fish in the water in the finger
            bowl and place it upside down in the small sponge in the
            plastic dish.<br>
<br>
        4.  Gently wipe the region of the anal fin with
            the corner of a Kimwipe.<br>
<br>
        5.  Place the dish with the fish under the
            objective of the microscope, with the light illuminating the
            fish, especially the region of the anal fin.<br>
<br>
        6.  With the capillary tube of the sperm
            collecting apparatus, gently push aside the anal fins to
            expose the anus.<br>
<br>
        7.  Using the forceps gently squeeze the sides
            of the fish at a point just anterior to the anal fins, collecting
            the sperm with the capillary tube.  When finished return
            the fish to the finger bowl or recovery
            container.<br>
<br>
        8.  When you have collected sperm from 2-3
            fish, add them to the Hanks solution in the small test tube
            in the ice bucket.<br>
<br>
        9.  Repeat until you have collected the required
            amount of sperm.<br>
<br>
        10. Keep the small test tube with the sperm and
            Hank's solution in the ice.  This helps prolong the viability
            of the sperm.<br>
 <br>
<br><B><A NAME="4"><I><H3>Squeezing Females</H3></I></A></B>    <B>Materials Needed:</B><br>
<br>
        Tricaine solution in two 250 ml beakers <br>
        Sperm in Hank's solution <br>
        One package, 35 mm petri dishes <br>
        50 &#181;l micropipettes (Drummond Wiretrol)<br>
        Plungers for micropipettes<br>
        Egg Water<br>
        2 18mm x 150mm test tubes <br>
        2-1 ml pipettes and a 25 ml pipette in a liter beaker of fish water<br>
        Clean tank water <br>
        Female fish <br>
 <br>
    <B>Preparation</B><br>
<br>
        1.  Fill the large test tubes with egg water.<br>
<br>
        2.  Put one plunger into each test tube.<br>
<br>
        3.  Fill finger bowls with clean tank water.<br>
<br>
    <B>Procedure</B><br>
<br>
        1.  Place two females into the tricaine solution
            in each of the two 250 ml beakers.<br>
<br>
        2.  When gill movement has slowed, remove
            one of the fish with the plastic spoon.
            <br>
<br>
        3.  Rinse the fish in the water in the finger
            bowl. <br>
<br>
        4.  Gently place the fish on a paper towel to
            dry briefly. <br>
<br>
        5.  Using the spoon, transfer the fish into a
            small plastic dish. <br>
<br>
        6.  Slightly dampen your fingers. <br>
<br>
        7.  Place one finger of one hand on the dorsal
            side of the fish.  <br>
<BR>        8.  Using one finger of the other hand express
            the eggs by gently pressing on the ventral side of the fish,
            starting just behind the pectoral fins and moving toward the
            tail.  Only gentle pressure is needed. If the fish has eggs
            they will come out easily.  If gentle pressure fails to
            produce eggs do not continue to squeeze harder.  Extra
            squeezing may injure the fish. <br>
<br>
        9.  If eggs are obtained, use the metal spatula
            to gently move them away from the fish's body.  Then
            slide the fish out of the dish.<br>
<br>
        10. Put the fish into a recovery container to
            revive.<br>
<br>
        11. When eggs are obtained by squeezing,
            cover them with the lid to the dish.<br>
<br>
        12. Repeat this for the remaining
            fish.<P>
<A NAME="5"><I><H3>In Vitro Fertilization</I></A></H3></B>

    <B>Procedure</B><br>
<br>
        1.  Move to the fertilization station and remove
            a plunger from the water in the test tube.  Remove a
            capillary tube from its container and insert the plunger into
            the end of the capillary with the green mark.
            <br>
<br>
        2.  Push the plunger down almost to the end of
            the tube, leaving about 0.5 cm of air space.
            <br>
<br>
        3.  Remove the cork from the test tube
            containing the sperm and insert the capillary tube with the
            plunger into the sperm. <br>
<br>
        4.  Draw the plunger part way out of the tube
            to draw sperm up to the black line on the capillary.  Be
            sure to leave air space between the end of the plunger and
            the sperm. <br>
<br>
        5.  Expel the sperm onto the eggs by pushing
            the plunger all the way through the capillary so that the tip
            of the plunger extends out of the end of the capillary.
            <br>
<br>
        6.  Gently mix the sperm and eggs with the tip
            of the plunger. <br>
<br>
        7.  Using the 1 ml pipette, add 1 ml of egg
            water to the egg/sperm mixture.  This activates the sperm
            so that they can fertilize the eggs.  The time of fertilization
            occurs when the WATER is added, not when the sperm is
            added. <br>
<br>
        8.  Cover the dish with its lid.
            <br>
<br>
        9.  Allow a few minutes for fertilization to
            complete, then add more egg water, approximately 2
            ml.<br>
<br>
<br>
<I><B>Experiment Clean Up</I><br>
</B><br>
    When fish are returned to their tanks, they should be marked with a sticker
indicating the date used.  Rinse spatulas, wiretrols, and spoons with tap water. 
Put away all materials in original places.  Enter the number and quality
(G,B,M,N) of eggs obtained in <I>Experiment Done</I> notebook.<br>
<br>
<br>
<I><B>Follow Up of Embryos</I><br>
<br>
</B>        Embryos should be left alone for one hour after fertilization.

<title>Growing Zebrafish</title>
<H1>CHAPTER 3 - EMBRYONIC AND LARVAL CULTURE</H1>
<H2><A NAME="1">A Simple Method for Raising Babies</A></H2>
(Source: C. Walker)	<p>
For optimal growth during the first few days, keep the embryos in system water at least 3 cm deep (25-50 embryos per 100 ml in a 250 ml beaker, for example).  Embryos can also be raised 25 per 35 mm petri dish if the water is changed daily, although this method does not provide for optimal growth.  The best temperature for growth and for accurate staging is 28.5&#176;C.  Placing the beakers in a constant temperature water bath and covering them with watch glasses provides steady conditions.  The embryos normally hatch after about 3 days of development but do not need to be fed until 4 days after fertilization.  At that time, feed the larvae live paramecia or other microorganisms which can be prepared as an infusion.  Most pet shops sell infusion materials for feeding baby fish.  Paramecia raised in a mung bean culture reduce the chances of infection. At 9 days, the food can be switched to both paramecia and baby brine shrimp and finally adult-type fish food (see <b>Food</b>, page ).  As the larvae get larger, they can be moved to bigger containers.  For maximal growth keep the number of fish per container low, feed them often (twice daily) and replace about 1/3 of the water in each container daily.<b><i><p>
<H3>General method for raising babies:</H3></i></b><p>
1.	Keep 15-25 embryos in 100 ml system water in a 250 ml beaker.  The best temperature for growth and staging is 28.5&#176;C, but embryos survive temperatures between 24&#176;C and 33&#176;C.  Placing beakers in a constant temperature water bath and covering them with a watch glass provides steady conditions for accurate staging.  Embryos hatch in between 2 and 3 days.<p>
2.	At 4 days after fertilization, feed embryos live paramecia (or other microorganisms, available at most pet shops, which can be prepared as an infusion.  Feed large quantities of paramecia starting at 6 days because the yolk is mostly depleted by then.<p>
3.	At 9 days, move fry into 1-2 liter baby rearing containers and feed both paramecia and brine shrimp.  Clean containers care-fully twice daily, replacing with clean system water. Gradually increase the proportion of brine shrimp and phase out the paramecia.<p>
4.	At 21 days, move fish into tanks, still feeding them baby brine shrimp.  Feed adult foods as soon as the babies are big enough to eat it.

<title>Growing Zebrafish</title>
<H1>CHAPTER 3 - EMBRYONIC AND LARVAL CULTURE</H1>
<H2><A NAME="2">Raising Larvae in a Nursery</A></H2><b>
(Source: T. Mason)</b>	<p>
Raising babies under "nursery" conditions is relatively labor-intensive, but ensures that they receive lots of hands-on attention for maximal survival.<b><i><p>
<H3>General procedures</H3></i></b>	<p>
Fish must be raised in the Nursery from fertilization until they are big enough to live in regular tanks.  They enter the Nursery in beakers and graduate to larger containers, like mouse cages, as they grow.  Similarly, they require a changing diet as they grow.  Throughout this period they require daily cleaning and feeding.	<p>
The person in charge of the Nursery has the job of caring for the baby fish from the time they begin eating paramecia until they graduate to young adulthood. This means instructing new people on the current methods of placing babies into the Nursery, caring for the babies when they arrive, placing the babies into the main facility, and feeding the babies in the main facility until they become adults.	<p>
Zebrafish embryos must be prepared properly before they are transferred into the Nursery.  The user should separate the fertile embryos from the infertile ones and then meticulously clean the fertile embryos.  If the eggs are not too dirty, several rinses with system water are sufficient.  For extremely dirty eggs or when infection is suspected, bleaching the eggs may be necessary.	<p>
A solution of bleach water is made by placing 0.1 ml of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and 170 ml of system water into a 250 ml beaker.  To bleach the eggs, first rinse them with system water and then place 25 to 30 into the beaker of bleach solution.  Swirl the beaker and allow the eggs to separate and the entire surface of each chorion to come into contact with the water.  After one to two minutes in the solution, remove the eggs with a clean pipette and place them into a beaker of clean water.  Again, swirl the eggs and allow each one to receive a thorough rinse.  Repeat the rinse procedure and then place the eggs into 250 ml beakers at 25 to 30 eggs each.	<p>
A tough chorion can often be a by-product of the bleaching procedure. Thus, if the young fish do not hatch on their own, remove the chorions manually (See <b><A HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt4/4.1.html">Removing Embryos from Their Chorions</A></b>, Chapter 4).	<p>
To avoid problems with contamination that will arise if eggs are incorrectly prepared, the Nursery cannot accept beakers of embryos that have been improperly sorted or inadequately cleaned.  In addition, a beaker of over-crowded embryos (30 or fewer is the accepted number) cannot be allowed in the Nursery.	<p>
Baby zebrafish should be placed in the Nursery before the fourth day of life when they need to begin eating food.  (They grow using the nutrients in the <p>
yolk from day one to day four.)  If a beaker is placed in the Nursery before day four, it is the responsibility of the owner of the fish to clean the beakers and remove any dead babies.  After day four, the nursery person begins daily cleaning and feeding.	<p>
It is important that a proper label accompany every beaker of fish brought into the Nursery.  Each label should contain the name of the person who is responsible for the fish, the date the fish were fertilized, the name of the fish (strain), and the stock number of the fish.  If the fish are to be euthanized before they would normally go into a tank (e.g. to be used for an assay or histology) the number of days after fertilization that they are to be killed should be marked on the label (e.g. "14 dx").	<p>
After placing new babies in the Nursery, the person responsible for them should locate the Tank Sign-Up book and record the number(s) of the tanks(s) the fish will occupy in the main room.  Failure to do so could result in the loss of that group of baby fish.  The user should completely fill in all the information required in the Tank Sign-Up book.	<p>
The daily Nursery duties can be divided into three main categories:	<p>
<UL>
<LI>cleaning the baby fish containers
<LI>feeding the baby fish
<li>growing brine shrimp
</UL><b><i><p>
<H3>Cleaning the baby fish containers</H3></i></b>	<p>
Both types of baby fish containers, 250 ml beakers and mouse cages, need to be cleaned on a daily basis.<b><p>
Cleaning the 250 ml beakers</b>	<p>
Baby fish that are between four and nine days old are kept in 250 ml beakers at 25-30 fish per beaker.  These fish are fed paramecia, but sometimes fish die and need to be removed.  Use a pipette (5 3/4" disposable Pasteur pipette) to remove dead fish. Look into the beakers with baby fish and identify the dead fish. The paramecia will eat the dead fish, so a fish to be removed will be lying on the bottom of the beaker and will appear rough or fuzzy around the edges because it is covered with paramecia.  Use the pipette to remove the dead fish and record the death (on a piece of tape located on the side of the beaker).  Use only one pipette per stock number (type of fish) to minimize the chance of contaminating the various strains with a disease or protozoan infestation.  Follow this procedure once every day.	<b><p>
Cleaning mouse cages</b>	<p>
The baby fish are placed in a mouse cage nine days after fertilization when they become old enough to eat baby brine shrimp (small artemia).  The baby fish eat most of the brine shrimp they are fed, but some portion is always left and these brine shrimp die in the normal fish water.  Twice a day the fish are fed brine shrimp and twice a day the containers must be cleaned of old, dead shrimp.  This serves not only to remove the decaying brine shrimp, fecal material left by the fish, and any baby fish that might have died, but it also provides us with an opportunity to give the fish fresh water.	<p>
For the first three days after the fish are placed into baby fish containers (e.g. mouse cages), add only a few drops of brine shrimp and do not clean the container.  Beginning on the fourth day, use a clean egg siphon and a 5-gallon bucket and "vacuum" the debris off the bottom of the container.  Place one hand on the glass part of the siphon to direct it and the other on the hose part ready to pinch it off if a fish is inadvertently sucked up the tube. A moderate speed is required so the maximum amount of debris is removed, while at the same time leaving the fish in a comfortable volume of water.  When one mouse cage is finished, move on to the next one using the same siphon and bucket.	<p>
A wise technique for a novice cleaner is to check the bucket before going on to the next container.  If a live fish has been sucked up, it can be rescued and returned to its proper mouse cage.  If many mouse cages have been cleaned and a live baby is noticed in the bucket, it should be euthanized rather than returned to a mouse cage.  This will avoid the possibility of mixing different strains of fish.	<p>
After all the mouse cages have been cleaned, fill them back up with system water.  Keep a large tank of clean system water in the Nursery for filling the mouse cages.<p>
<b><i><p>
<H3>Feeding the baby fish</H3></i></b>	<p>
The baby fish are fed two types of food.  The smallest baby fish get paramecia and the bigger ones get brine shrimp.  The intermediate baby fish eat both kinds of food.	<b><p>
Paramecia</b>	<p>
Baby fish four to fifteen days old should be fed paramecia. The paramecia are cultured in finger bowls on a rack in the Nursery (see methods for growing paramecia in following sections of this chapter).  To collect <b>paramecia</b>, take a cloth handkerchief and place it in a 1-liter funnel.  Place the funnel in a ring stand on top of the paramecia rack and place a 1-liter beaker under the funnel.  Choose a stack of fingerbowls from the rack with the oldest brine shrimp and pour the contents of each fingerbowl through the handkerchief.  The empty fingerbowls should be rinsed and placed in the tub of dirty dishes to be washed before reuse. The handkerchief should be rinsed out and hung up to dry.  The 1-liter beaker contains the paramecia that are ready to be used for feeding the babies in mouse cages.	<p>
If the fish are receiving their first feeding in a mouse cage, they should get 50 ml of paramecia per mouse cage.  For every feeding after that, they should get 25 ml.  It should be noted that some strains are weaker than others and may require more paramecia per feeding.  In addition, some of the weaker strains may not grow as fast as others and the number of days they are fed paramecia should be lengthened accordingly.		<p>
To feed younger babies in the 250 ml beakers, the paramecia need to be filtered.  Start by following the procedure for collecting paramecia as outlined above.  Take one piece of filter paper (P8 qualitative; Fisher) and fold it 8 times so it becomes accordion-like.  Place the folded paper in a 1-liter funnel and place an empty 1-liter beaker beneath it.  Pour the beakers of collected paramecia into the funnel with the filter paper in it.  The waste water will collect in the beaker at the bottom and the paramecia will become concentrated in the top.  When approximately 500 ml of waste water has been collected, take a pipette or other long, clean object, and while holding the funnel over a clean, empty beaker, poke the bottom of the paper.  The concentrated paramecia will pour into this beaker.  This beaker of paramecia is ready to be fed to the babies in the 250 ml beakers.  	<p>
Use a clean 10 ml glass pipette to give each beaker approximately 5 ml of the paramecia suspension.  After all the beakers have been fed, check to make sure they are covered (e.g. with plexiglass) and then clean the paramecia-collecting equipment with tap water.  Discard the used filter papers.  Feed the babies in the 250 ml beakers once each day.	<b><p>
Brine shrimp</b>	<b><p>
The brine shrimp</b> are hatched in 5-gallon tanks.  To collect brine shrimp, choose the tank with the oldest shrimp and turn off the air lines that are used to aerate the shrimp culture.  Place a lamp in front of the tank and turn it on.  The brine shrimp will move toward the light and in five to ten minutes, they can be siphoned out.	<p>
To siphon the brine shrimp for a <i>morning feeding</i>, place a 2-liter flask with a funnel and a handkerchief on the floor in front of the tank.  Remove the lid from the tank and slowly lower the siphon into the water.  (A layer of unhatched eggs always covers the surface of the water and a small puff of air as the end of the siphon passes through this layer can clear the unhatched eggs so they do not go into the siphon.)  Position the end of the siphon directly in the thickest concentration of brine shrimp and start the siphon.  The shrimp will collect on the handkerchief and the salt water will collect in the flask.	<p>
A clean empty beaker should be standing by to receive the brine shrimp.  A 600 ml beaker works nicely; however, if there are a lot of brine shrimp, a 1-liter beaker is required.  The brine shrimp should be rinsed with fish water to remove any excess salt water before feeding.  Keep a squirt bottle near the clean water tank for this purpose.  To transfer the brine shrimp to the beaker, place one hand in the shape of a cup under the handkerchief and lift the shrimp out of the funnel.  With the other hand, use the squirt bottle to rinse them off the cloth and into the beaker.  If the concentration in the beaker is too thick, add more clean system water to thin it.  Take the flask of salt water and pour it back into the brine shrimp tank.  Locate the air lines and turn them on so the water is bubbling again.	<p>
Use a pipette (5 3/4" disposable Pasteur pipette) with a bulb to feed the baby fish in the Nursery.  Fish that are 9-11 days old need only a couple of drops of the brine shrimp.  Fish that are 12-17 days old can eat at least one full pipette and if they are between 17 and 21 days old, they will eat 1.5 to 2 pipettes full.	<p>
In addition to the fish in mouse cages in the Nursery, <b>babies in regular tanks (in the regular, non-nursery facility)</b> also need to be fed brine shrimp.  All the babies in the main facility should be labeled (e.g. with pink pieces of tape on their tanks that have the word "babies" written on them).  Simply start at one end of the main room and walk down each aisle looking for tanks with "baby stickers" on them.  A general rule for feeding is one pipette full per 10 fish, so a tank with 50 fish will get 5 pipettes of brine shrimp.	<p>
Some adult fish may also need a supplement of baby brine shrimp to help them grow better.  These tanks should be marked (e.g. indicated by round, green stickers) and should get one pipette per 20 fish.	<p>
After all the fish with either pink baby stickers or round green stickers have been fed, any extra food can be given to other adult fish (e.g. the fish in the largest stock tanks).  The beaker and the pipette can be rinsed with regular tap water and put on a paper towel to dry.	<b><p>
Afternoon feedings</b>	<p>
To collect brine shrimp for the <i>afternoon feeding</i>, obtain a clean, empty mouse cage and place the flask that will hold the salt water in the mouse cage.  Put the mouse cage and flask on the floor and siphon almost all the brine shrimp from the tank using the procedures outlined for the morning feeding.  Use two 1-liter beakers to hold the brine shrimp and pour the collected salt water back into the tank.  A larger amount of brine shrimp is required because the afternoon feeding includes a supplement of baby brine shrimp for all the fish in the facility.  The general rule for feeding adults labeled with green dots (see above) can be used as a guideline for feeding the adult supplement in the afternoon.  After all the fish have been fed, the beakers and pipette are cleaned as in the morning.<p>
<b><i><p>
<H3>Growing brine shrimp</H3></i></b>	<p>
New tanks of baby brine shrimp should be started on a daily basis.  Use a clean 5-gallon tank for the new batch of brine shrimp.  Begin by removing the old tank from its place by disconnecting its air lines from the metal valves and moving it aside.  Place the clean tank on the counter and connect its air lines to the valves.  Use clean system water to fill the tank almost full (approximately 4 gallons), add 500 g of rock salt, and turn on the air valves to begin stirring the water.  Add 15 teaspoons (75 ml) of brine shrimp eggs to the tank.  Cover the tank with a piece of plexiglass.  Label the tank with the present day of the week. 	<p>
The dirty tank should be taken into the kitchen and cleaned using tap water.  First, remove the bubbling apparatus and rinse it inside and out.  Second, dump the old brine shrimp and salt water down the drain, and third, rinse out the tank.  After the tank has been cleaned, place it in the Nursery to air dry.<b><i><p>
<H3>Transferring fish out of the Nursery</H3></i></b>	<p>
When the baby fish have reached 21 days of age, they are ready to be transferred out of the Nursery into a full-sized tank in the main zebrafish facility. To transfer fish, first update the nursery record book.  In the book, all entries are organized by stock number.  Find the stock number of the fish to be transferred out of the Nursery and fill in the columns for total number of live fish remaining and total number of dead fish recorded on the label.  Up to 50 baby fish can be placed in a 10-gallon tank.  Divide the total number of babies so that each mouse cage has approximately 50 fish.  Pour the babies from each mouse cage into a separate 10-gallon tank making sure all the babies have been transferred and none remain on the sides or bottom of the mouse cage.  Remove the label with the name of the fish from the mouse cage and place it in the upper left corner on the front of the tank.  All other labels on the mouse cage can be thrown away.  Make a label showing the total number of fish in the tank and place it so it can be seen easily.  Replace the lid on the tank and check to make sure the fresh water is dripping, place a piece of netting over the drain to keep the babies from escaping, and start the air bubbler.  The dirty mouse cage should be washed before reuse. Enter the new fish information into the computer database.  One form should be filled out for each stock number.<p>

<H1>CHAPTER 3 - EMBRYONIC AND LARVAL CULTURE</H1>
<H2><A NAME="4">A Semi-Sterile Method For Raising Paramecia</A></H2>
(Source:  B. Trevarrow) 	<p>
This method is a bit more tedious, but works if you have trouble growing paramecia with the simpler protocol.<b><i><p>
<H3>You will need:</H3></b></i>
Sterile fish water 24&#176;C<br>
Narrow necked clear glass bottles (500 ml tissue culture media bottles will do)<br>
Liquid Fry (available through pet shops)<br>
Wads of nylon filter wool<br>
A disposable syringe (10 or 20 ml)<br>
A productive healthy strain of paramecia (Connecticut Valley, Carolina Biological, etc.)<br>
<b><i>
<H3>Best temperature:</H3></i></b>21-24&#176;C. The culture grows more slowly at lower temperatures.<b><i><p>
<H3>To establish the culture:</H3></i></b><p>
1. Clean the bottles and fill with fish water about 3/4 full or until the bottle narrows. This should leave a relatively large surface area.	<p>
2. Sterilize the bottles by autoclaving.	<p>
3. Add several drops of liquid fry to each bottle (3 to 10 drops per 500 ml).	<p>
4. Add paramecia (about 1/4 to 1/8 of an aliquot per 500 ml). The culture will clear as the paramecia multiply, leaving mostly paramecia, flocculate material, and debris on the bottom. The paramecia can be seen as small specks. A dissecting scope can be used to ensure that the cultures are growing. <b><i><p>
<H3>To harvest:</H3></i></b>	<p>
1. Fill a narrow-necked bottle with the paramecia containing medium, if they were not grown there originally.	<p>
2. Add some water soluble vitamins to enhance the nutritional value of the paramecia a few hours before harvesting. They will absorb them directly from the medium.	<p>
3. If necessary, add deionized water to bring the fluid level up to the narrow part of the neck of the bottle.	<p>
4. Press a wad of nylon filter wool into the neck until it is beneath the surface of the water. Make sure no bubbles, which could block the passage of paramecia upwards, are trapped under the wool.	<p>
5. Fill the bottle to its top with sterile 10% Hank's saline or sterile fish water.	<p>
6. After a few hours, the paramecia will migrate up through the filter floss towards the air/water interface and into the small volume of clean 10% Hank's.	<p>
7. Remove the paramecia with a syringe or pour off and feed directly to the baby fish.

<H1>CHAPTER 3 - EMBRYONIC AND LARVAL CULTURE</H1>
  <H2><A NAME="5">Growing Paramecia Under Sterile Conditions</A></H2><b>
(Source: W. Driever and C. Boggs)<i><p>
<H3>Culture of Paramecia:</H3></i></b><p>
1.	Grow paramecia cultures under "cell culture" conditions.  Make passages in a sterile tissue culture hood.  <p>
2.	Use 500 ml or 1000 ml media bottles (e.g., with orange caps) and culture at 28&#176;C in the dark, for example in a cabinet in your fish room.  <p>
3.	Dilute the starter culture (a clear suspension of paramecia) 1:1 with fresh (milky) medium and incubate with the cap loosened one half turn to provide air.  After 2-3 days the culture will clear and you should be able to observe clouds of paramecia. <p>
4.	Expand the culture by diluting it 1:1 with fresh medium.  If you add twice the volume of fresh medium, it takes about 3 days to clear.  Use clear cultures for harvesting paramecia or store for 3 to 5 days at about 20&#176;C. <b><i><p>
<H3>Long term storage of paramecia:</H3></i></b>	<p>
Use Dryl's solution (1 volume clear culture to 5 volumes Dryl's) to prepare a backup stock in case the original culture becomes contaminated. Paramecia live about 10 days in this solution in the dark at 18-<p>
20&#176;C.  Prepare the solution from autoclaved components and add the CaCl2 last or it will precipitate.<p>
	<b><i>
<H3>Long term paramecia storage medium:</H3></i></b>	<b><p>
Component; Stock; Amount (ml)</b>
<DIR>
<LI>NaH2PO4; 0.01M; 10
<LI>Na2HPO4; 0.01M; 10
<LI>Sodium citrate; 0.1M; 20
<LI>CaCl2; 0.1M; 15
<li>dH20; ; 945
</DIR>
<b><i><p>
<H3>Harvesting paramecia from clear cultures:</H3></i></b>	<b><p>
Materials:</b>
<UL>
<LI>large funnel (<a href="http://www.bel-art.com"> Bel-Art</a>) with grooves
<LI>cotton handkerchief
<LI>24 cm fluted filter paper circles (Fischer 09-790-14G)
<li>24 cm Whatman No. 1 filter paper circles
</UL><p>
1.	Choose bottles of cleared paramecia cultures for harvest. Approximately 40-50 ml of culture will feed up to 100 larval fish per day.  <p>
2.	Place the funnel in a flask and filter the paramecia stock through the folded cotton handkerchief to remove precipitates of the Sch&ouml;nefeld's medium. <p>
3.	Filter the liquid through fluted circles until the flow decreases to a slow drip. <p>
4.	Rinse the paramecia off the filter paper into a flask using embryo medium. Repeat until all the stock is filtered. <p>
5.	Refilter the paramecia through fluted circles rinsing with embryo medium until most of the yellow color has disappeared. <p>
6.	Collect the paramecia in a clean bottle making sure that the yellow color is gone. Rinse again if necessary.  Some paramecia pass through the fluted filters. If they are needed for feeding, they can be collected by filtering through the Whatman No. 1 circular filter.  However, filtering through a Whatman 1 is very slow.  <p>
7.	Adjust the volume with embryo medium to equal 1/2 of the original culture volume.  Store in darkness at 20&#176;C until needed for feeding.

<H3>Preparation of paramecia culture medium:</H3></i></b>	<p>
The classical hay infusions are often unreliable (and tend to stink!) and some people have mixed results with mung beans or wheat.  The following is a modification of an axenic method for growing paramecia (Sch&ouml;nefeld et al. <i>J. Protozool. </i><b>33</b>:222).

<H2><A NAME="7">Purification of Paramecia</A></H2><b>
(Source: B. Trevarrow)</b>	<p>
Contamination is a recurrent problem with paramecia cultures. Here is a simple technique that allows the isolation of paramecia or other motile micro-organisms from non-motile or more slowly moving organisms that may contaminate the culture.<p>
1.	Prepare a number of small diameter glass tubes (about 5 cm long and 2-3 mm inside diameter) that are filled with loosely compacted glass floss. The floss should be inserted 3-5 mm in from each end (see below). To insert it, cut a strip about 2-3 mm wide and about 5 cm long and draw through the tube with a wire hook or tubing with a notch in it.<p>
<B>Figure 2.  Device for purifying paramecia</B>
<img src="3-19.gif">
<p>
2.	Sterilize the tubes.<p>
3.	Suspend a sterile floss-containing tube in a sterile 60 mm petri plate with a piece of tape. The tape does not need to be sterile. Avoid touching the ends of the tube.<p>
4.	Using a sterile pipette tip, add sterile 10% Hanks  to one end of the tube. Leave space (about 2-3 mm) in the end of the tube for the addition of the impure paramecia culture .<p>
5.	Add a droplet of the impure paramecia culture to the same end of the tube filling the 2-3 mm space.<p>
6.	Occlude the culture-containing end of the tube with a small piece of modeling clay (e.g. Plasticine).<p>
7.	Wait a few hours and the paramecia will appear at the open end of the tube where they are observable with a dissecting microscope and can be isolated with a sterile pipet tip. Do not wait too long or other slower moving organisms may catch up. <p>
8.	Add the isolated paramecia to a sterile culture and no other organisms should be present.

<H2><A NAME="8">Microworms as a Food Source</A></H2><p>
(Source:  B. Trevarrow) 	<p>
Microworms are a live food that some labs are using instead of brine shrimp. Here is a method for raising microworms adapted from techniques used in fly labs.<b><i><p>
<H3>You will need:</H3></i></b>
Clean plastic boxes with snap on lids (Tupperware-like)<br> 
Oatmeal (rolled oats or porridge)<br> 
A spoon for stirring the oatmeal<br> 
Deionized water<br>
10% methyl-p-hydroxybenzoate (also known as Tegosept or Nipagin-M, fungus inhibitor) in 95% EtOH<br> 
A productive strain of micro worms (commercially available through hobbyist magazines)<br> 
A clean Pasteur pipet<br> 
A clean, long handled paint brush with a brush approximately 1 x 2.5 cm<br> 
Two 50 ml plastic 'Falcon'-like tubes and a sieve that fits into the top of one of the tubes<br>
<b><i><p>
<H3>Establishing the worm cultures</H3></i></b><p>
1.	Make up the oatmeal in the approximate proportions of 150 ml of oatmeal to 400 ml of distilled water. The proportions should be adjusted to give a thick but not overly firm consistency. <p>
2.	Soak the oatmeal for about 5-10 minutes, then boil in a double boiler for about 5-10 minutes (until the oatmeal is evenly thick from the top to the bottom). <p>
3.	Remove the oatmeal from the heat and add 2.8 ml of 10% methyl-p-hydroxybenzoate in 95% EtOH for every 400 ml of oatmeal mixture, to yield a final concentration of 0.07%. Stir and pour into the clean plastic boxes. After the mixture cools, add an aliquot of microworms. <p>
5.	Check the new cultures in about a week for worms. They should be climbing out of the culture onto the sides of the container or squirming visibly in the culture medium. Some cultures may take longer to produce a good crop of worms. If they do not produce worms by the second week, rinse and bleach the containers before reusing. Old cultures which no longer produce worms should be discarded and the containers washed and bleached before reuse.<b><i><p>
<H3>Harvesting worm cultures</H3></i></b><p>
1.	Select box(es) to be harvested.<p>
2.	Fill one of the 50 ml tubes with approximately 20 ml of water.<p>
3.	Wet the brush in deionized water and use it to wipe worms off the top of a culture. Swish the brush in the water in the 50 ml tube until the worms fall off.<p>
4.	Repeat until enough worms are obtained or until the top is devoid of worms. If more worms are needed, wipe them from the sides of the box or from a new box.<p>
5.	Dump the worms that have been collected in the tube onto the sieve on top of the other tube.<p>
<p>
<B>Figure 3.  Sieve for collecting microworms</B>
<img src="3-23.gif">
<p>
6.	Add more water to the first tube and wash remaining worms onto the sieve.<p>
7.	Fill the second tube with additional water until the level just reaches the bottom of the sieve. Live worms will wiggle through the sieve into the water, dead worms and pieces of food are retained and should be discarded.<p>
8.	Let the live worms settle to the bottom (5-15 min).<p>
9.	Remove the worms from the bottom of the tube with a Pasteur pipet and transfer to a small tube for distribution to the fish tanks.<p>
10.	Live worms can be maintained for extended periods of time in the large or small tubes without any problems.

<H1>CHAPTER 3 - EMBRYONIC AND LARVAL CULTURE</H1>
<H2><A NAME="9">A Simple Method for Raising Larvae</A></H2>
(Source: W. Driever and C. Boggs)	<p>
The following is a relatively less labor intensive method for feeding and raising babies until they are big enough to live in regular fish tanks.<p>
1.	When the larvae have hatched, transfer them into a new dish or beaker and completely separate them from their chorions (see <b><A HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt4/4.1.html">Removing Embryos from Their Chorions</A></b>, Chapter 4). It is important to remove the chorions to reduce the growth of fungus and bacteria.<p>
2.	On day 5, transfer larvae into 1000 ml beakers (up to 100 larvae per beaker).  Fill the beakers with about 200 ml of Embryo Medium.  Feed 5 ml of the paramecium suspension (see above) three times daily on day 5 and 6, then 10 ml three times daily thereafter.<p>
3.	On day 9 or 10, when the larvae have nice "paramecium bellies", transfer them into "baby-tubes".  Pour the larvae from a 1 l beaker into each baby-tube.  At this age, their belly is big enough so that they will not pass through the mesh. <p>
4.	Exchange the water and aerate with a Pasteur pipette in the baby-tube attached to an air line.  One or two air bubbles every second is sufficient because more air will move the water too much and the fish will have to fight the current. <p>
5.	Feed 5-10 ml (for 20-100 larvae) of paramecium suspension 3 times per day.<p>
6.	Every second day, change the water with an aspirator, remove dead fish from the baby-tube, and add about 200 ml of Embryo Medium.  <p>
7.	Beginning on day 15 to 20, feed the fish with brine shrimp three times a day.  Be sure to remove dead brine shrimp daily. <p>
8.	When about 90% of the fish eat brine shrimp, transfer the baby-tubes into fish tanks (see Figure 6).<p>
9.	Continue feeding the fish 3 times each day for 5 to 10 days with the small size brine shrimp. In addition feed them each evening with about 10 ml of Spirulina (1 teaspoon of Spirulina slurry per 200 ml of fish water; Spirulina from Argent Laboratories).  It is unnecessary to clean the tubes as long as the water flow is adequate.  Fish can stay in these tubes until they are about 4-6 weeks old and are large enough to go into regular tanks.<b><i><p>
<H3>Construction of baby tubes:</H3></i></b>	<p>
The design of these tubes is based on a simpler version by C. N&uuml;sslein-Volhard from T&uuml;bingen.  Use acrylic tubes of about 10 cm diameter with 6-7 mm walls and about 15 cm long.  Close one end of the tubes by attaching a 0.5 mm nylon mesh with silicone glue.  Let the glue dry and rinse thoroughly.  On the other end of the tube, drill a small hole which allows you to run a small water line (e.g. 1/4 inch) into the tube.  The hole should be slightly smaller than the water line (e.g. 15/64 inch for a 1/4 inch line) such that the line can not slide out again.  Place a completed baby tube into a 2000 ml beaker. <b><i><p>
<H3>Fish tanks to hold multiple baby-tubes:</H3></i></b>	<p>
The tanks should have overflows or standpipes that maintain the water level at 10-12 cm.  Cover the bottom of the tanks with a wide mesh or an array of acrylic rods that hold the baby-tubes up off the bottom so that water and dirt can flow freely through the mesh in the bottom of the baby-tubes and into the tanks.  Attach the water line from each baby-tube to the water system pressure line and adjust the water flow to a slow, steady dripping.  We put several baby-tubes into one tank, and use a manifold (all plastic, e.g. Penplax) to distribute the water to the different baby-tubes.<p>

<H1>CHAPTER 4 - MICROSCOPIC OBSERVATIONS</H1>
<H2>REMOVING EMBRYOS FROM THEIR CHORIONS</H2>
(Source: M. Westerfield)<P>
  Some observations of zebrafish development can be made directly through the chorion.i.Chorion;, however for most procedures it is better to remove the chorion. When raised in Embryo Medium at 28.5&#176;C, zebrafish develop normally outside their chorions.  Chorions can be removed easily with sharp forceps (Dumont No. 5) by gently making a tear in the chorion and turning it upside down so that the embryo falls out.  To remove the chorions from young embryos (up to 15 h) care must be taken when opening the chorion because these embryos are easily damaged.<BR>  
<BR>
  Pretreatment with a dilute solution of pronase (2 mg/ml in Embryo Medium, 1 min, 28.5&#176;C) makes the chorions brittle and easier to remove.  Older embryos require longer in the pronase.  Be sure to rinse the pronase treated embryos thoroughly at least 3 or 4 times to remove all the enzyme.  Embryos usually fall out of their chorions with gentle swishing during the rinse.<BR>  
<BR>
  Embryos removed from their chorions can be transferred from one container to another by gently sucking them up with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette or by gentle pouring.  Small petri dishes (35 mm diameter) are adequate for holding up to 25 embryos during the first few days of development.  The embryos can be brought to the center of the dish for viewing by gently swirling the medium with a circular motion.

<A NAME="2"><H2>VIEWING CHAMBERS</H2></A>
(Source: M. Westerfield)<BR> 
<BR>  For higher magnification viewing with a compound microscope, mount the embryos between cover slips.  A simple, disposable viewing chamber can be made from two large cover slips (25x60 mm) spaced apart with 2 smaller cover slips (22x22 mm).  Using "Crazy Glue" (cyanoacrylate), glue one small cover slip near each end of one of the larger slips.  Position the smaller slips so that one edge is flush with the long side of the larger slip.  Then glue another small slip on top of each of the first two.  Transfer the embryo in a drop of saline to the space in the center of the large slip between the spacers and gently cover with the other large slip.  If the embryos need to be anesthetized, transfer them first to a small petri dish with tricaine and then into the viewing chamber.  The chamber can be placed on a standard microscope stage by taping it to a glass slide or by using a holder with a recessed edge and a central hole.<BR>
<BR>

  To remove embryos from the chamber, tip it vertically and dip one corner into a petri dish filled with embryo medium.  Direct a stream of medium into the space between the cover slips at the top edge of the chamber with a pasteur pipette.  The embryos will wash out into the dish and can be picked up with a fire-polished pasteur pipette.

<H1>CHAPTER 4 - MICROSCOPIC OBSERVATIONS</H1>
<H2>AGAR MOUNTING</H2>
(Source: J. Eisen)<p>

  For more precise orientation of zebrafish embryos and to keep them from floating around during long term observations, embed them in agar.

<H3>Mounting</H3>

<P>
1.  Prepare a 1.2% solution of agar in embryo medium (or Ringers solution if the embryos are to be injected or prepared for some other invasive procedure; see <a href="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt10.html">RECIPES</a>, Chapter 10) by heating in a boiling water bath or in a microwave oven.  This solution remains liquid at 37-40&#176;C, but quickly hardens when cooled.
<P>
2.  Keep a small amount of solution (5 ml) liquid in a test tube in a 42&#176;C water bath.
<P>
3.  Keep an extra glass plate from the stage of the stereomicroscope warm by immersing it in the water bath.
<P>
4.  Just before mounting the embryos, replace the room temperature glass plate with the warm one; be sure to dry it completely before using it.  
<P>
5.  Take the test tube containing the agar out of the water bath and transfer an embryo in a minimum amount of Ringers solution into it.
<P>
6.  Place a viewing chamber (1) on the warm glass plate on the stereomicroscope.  Quickly suck up the embryo in a small drop of agar and transfer it onto the chamber, keeping it clear of the cover slips that have been glued on.
<P>
7.  Using a fine minutien pin (0.10 mm diameter) mounted on a needle holder or on an applicator stick, position the embryo at the appropriate angle in the agar and allow the agar to harden.
<P>
8.  After the agar hardens, use a razor blade to cut out a small block of agar containing the embryo.  Slide the block, in the appropriate orientation, until it is pushed against the glued-on cover slips.  Remove residual liquid surrounding the agar block with a Kimwipe.  Place a small drop of liquid agar over the agar block to hold it in place.  When this hardens, cover the preparation with Ringers solution, as with embryo medium.
<P>

<H3>Removing embryos from agar</H3>
<P>

1.  To remove an embryo from the agar, place several drops of medium on top of the agar.
<P>
2.  Using a pointed scalpel or a minutien pin attached to a needle holder or applicator stick, create a "V" shaped cut in the agar with the point of the "V" aiming towards the embryo's head.<P>

3.  Hold the tips of a pair of sharp forceps closed and plunge them into the agar between the point of the "V" cut and the head of the embryo.<P>

4.  Gently open the points of the forceps creating a crack in the agar which will run along the length of the embryo.<P>

5.  The embryo will then float out of the agar into the saline and can be picked up with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette.

<P>
For a slightly less rigid mounting medium, use a lower concentration of agarose (0.1%) or 3% methyl cellulose.i.Methyl cellulose; (Sigma M-0387).  Methyl cellulose is especially good for orienting young embryos (less than 10 h old).
<P>
1.  Apply a drop of 3% methyl cellulose in embryo medium to a depression slide.
<P>
2.  Suck an embryo up into a pasteur pipette and position it near the opening in the pipette.
<P>
3.  Plunge the pipette into the methyl cellulose and gently expel the embryo with as little medium as possible.  The medium around the embryo will be quickly absorbed into the methyl cellulose.
<P>
4.  Use a fine loop of nylon fishing line to orient the embryo.
<P>
5.  Place a drop of saline over the well to keep the preparation from drying out and getting too sticky.
<P>
6.  To release the embryo, drop the entire slide into embryo medium for a few minutes.  The methyl cellulose will absorb the medium and become very soft so that the embryo can be teased free with the nylon loop.
<P>
  The methyl cellulose will swell and soften, and eventually the embryo will come free from the gel.  If you are in a hurry, be patient for 15-30 minutes of softening before scraping the methyl cellulose away from the embryo with the nylon hair loop.  Alternatively, embryos in methyl cellulose can soak overnight by leaving the slide in the dish containing embryo medium.  However, if you do this, you should add antibiotics to the medium (final concentration 2% penicillin/streptomycin in embryo medium, see

<b><i><H1>CHAPTER 5 - CELLULAR METHODS</H1></i></b><p>
<H2><A NAME="1">A Device to Hold Zebrafish Embryos During Microinjection</A></H2><p>
(Source: E. Weinberg)	<p>
This is an easy method for holding embryos while injecting DNA, lineage tracer dyes, etc., without removing their chorions.  The embryos are held in wedged-shaped troughs made with a plastic mold in 1.5% agarose.  Each trough can hold approximately 35 embryos (with chorions).  Embryos can be aligned by gently tamping them down with forceps.  Agarose is useful because pipette tips generally will not break if they accidently touch the surface.  As the pipette penetrates the chorion, the embryo is forced against the rear vertical wall of the trough.  The exact positioning of the pipette tip within the embryo is achieved by slight movement of the pipette with a micromanipulator or by movement of the stage.	<p>
If the pipette tip is thin and long enough, it can be withdrawn from the chorion without dragging the embryo out of the trough.  A problem with thin pipettes, however, is that they lack the tensile strength to penetrate the chorion and bend when forced onto the chorion surface.  Thicker pipettes do not easily slip out of the chorion, although the embryo can be held with forceps as the pipette is slowly withdrawn.  	<p>
Alternatively, a plastic cover can be used to impede the withdrawal of the embryo.  The plastic cover fits snugly into the indentation in the agarose created by the plastic mold.  The slits in the cover can be aligned with the somewhat narrower troughs in the agarose by sliding the cover from side to side.  (The width of the cover is 2.0 mm less than that of the mold allowing one to achieve the desired position for injection.)  The cover is 1.0 mm thick at the border, but only 0.7 mm thick between the openings so the embryos will slide off the pipette more readily.<b><i><p>
<H3>Making the chambers</H3></i></b><p>
1.	Pour approximately 20 ml of hot 1.5% agarose in embryo medium into a 100 x 15 Petri dish on a level surface.  Wait until completely solidified.  <p>
2.	Add an additional 20 ml of the 1.5% agarose to the dish.  Set the plastic mold (teeth down) into the liquid agarose overlay, tapping to eliminate any bubbles.<p>
3.	After the agarose sets, add a small amount of medium, wrap the Petri dish in parafilm, and store in the refrigerator.<b><i><p>
<H3>Injecting:</H3></i></b><p>
1.	Warm the Petri dish to the temperature you prefer for injection (embryos can tolerate 18&#176;C for about 1 hour, and the slower division rate allows more time to inject at the 1 and 2 cell stage).  <p>
2.	Remove the plastic mold.  <p>
3.	Position the dish on a microscope stage and adjust the angle of the pipette so that you can aim directly into the trough.  <p>
4.	Transfer embryos into the troughs and set the plastic cover with slits into the depression in the agarose.<p>
5.	Using forceps, align the embryos all in the same orientation. Add enough culture medium so that the level reaches the plastic edges of the slits.  Gently tamp the embryos down into the trough.  <p>
6.	Using controls on the micromanipulator, force the pipette through the chorion and the yolk cell, entering the embryonic cell(s) from the yolk cell.  (You might prefer to enter the embryonic cell directly; in this case, you would choose a different orientation of the embryo in the trough.)  <p>
7.	As the pipette goes through the yolk, move the Petri dish a bit so that the pipette is close to the plastic cover.<p>
8.	Inject the desired volume of solution and then withdraw the pipette with a slow steady motion.  The embryo will catch on the plastic cover and drop back into the trough.<p>
9.	Transfer the embryos into a dish with embryo medium and maintain at 28.5&#176;C for further development.<p>

<b><i><H1>CHAPTER 5 - CELLULAR METHODS</H1></i></b><p>
<H2><A NAME="2">Blastomere Lineage Analysis</A></H2><p>
(Source:  R. Warga and C. Kimmel)	<p>
This protocol provides methods for labeling blastomeres with tracer dyes and observing their clonal progeny in live or fixed whole-mounted embryos.<b><i><p>
<H3>Labels</H3></i></b>	<p>
Dissolve the dyes in 0.2 M KCl (at the concentrations specified below) and centrifuge through a 20 &#181;m pore filter before filling the pipettes.<b><p>
Tetramethyl-rhodamine Dextran</b> (10,000MW, neutral: Molecular Probes) make a 5% solution.  This is the standard dye used for fate mapping and lineage tracing.<b><p>
Fluorescein-isothiocyanate Dextran</b> (10,000MW, neutral: Sigma or Molecular Probes) make a 5% solution.  This dye is not particularly good for repeated observations.  It fades quickly,  and causes substantial photodamage to the cells during long exposures to fluorescent light.  Another disadvantage is that the embryo itself, particularly the yolk, has considerable autofluorescence at the wavelengths used to view fluorescein.<b><p>
BiotinDextran</b> (10,000MW, lysine fixable: Molecular Probes) make a 3% solution.  This dye is used as a fixable tracer, and can be included in the injection pipette along with the rhodamine dextran if permanent preparations are desired.<b><i><p>
<H3>Dye-filling the microinjection pipettes:</H3></i></b>	<p>
Make micropipettes from thin-walled Borosillicate capillary tubing, with the rapid fill glass fiber (e.g. Frederic Hear Inc. or Sutter Glass).  Pull a rather steep taper and a very sharp tip on the injection pipettes with a standard puller (e.g. a Flaming Brown programmable horizontal micropipette puller).  When determining the settings, check the point under a compound microscope at about 400x; it should be so sharp that the taper seems to disappear to nothing.  Later this tip will be broken off, and the taper largely will determine what the size of the tip will be after breaking it.  Backfill the injection pipette tips by placing a drop of the dye solution on their butt ends.  The fiber inside the pipette allows the dye to run up to the tips, where it accumulates.  Generally bubbles are present, but many will gradually disappear.  Hence, the pipettes can be filled the day before use, and stored in a refrigerator in a humidified container.<b><i><p>
<H3>The injection rig:</H3></i></b>	<p>
 Standard methods borrowed from electrophysiologists are used to label cells.  The basic setup includes a stimulator, an intracellular amplifier, and an oscilloscope, and you can learn how to hook the boxes together from a cooperative physiologist if you don't know how to do these things.  An audio monitor for hearing the voltage is also very useful.  The holder for the injection pipette is mounted on a micromanipulator (e.g. a Leitz manipulator, which gives lovely control and stability, and a hydraulic advance fitted in front of it, permitting very fine control of axial excursions of the pipette).  For blastomere injections, a relatively inexpensive Nomarski microscope with 10x and 20x objectives can be used.  Even though the lenses are corrected for a coverslip, the optics are adequate without.  The working distance for either objective is sufficient to position the injection pipette underneath, if you mount it with the manipulator so that the pipette comes in at a shallow angle, about 20&#176; from the horizontal, just clearing the microscope stage.  To position the pipette near the cell of interest use both the manipulator and microscope stage controls.	<p>
The holder for the injection pipette (WPI, Inc.) permits recording, passing current, and dye injection by pressure.  The pressure can be regulated with a commercial unit (e.g. General Valve, Corp.) or with a simple system built from individual parts.  It is important to regulate the pressure both up and down agreeably and without hysteresis, while the pipette tip is inside the cell.  A simple system is diagrammed in the accompanying Figure, and constructed from the following parts:<p>

The "air in" in this system can come from an in house supply of air, but a nitrogen or compressed air tank can provide higher pressures.  The "air out" goes directly to the pipette.	Just before use, backfill the pipette (i.e. from its butt end) with 0.2 M KCl applied behind the dye solution.  You can buy a long thin syringe needle for this purpose (Hamilton) or pull out a suitably long capillary from a Pasteur pipette.  Mount the pipette on the holder.  With another manipulator, advance a glass rod firepolished at the end to produce a ball about 3 mm in diameter.  This ball is used to break the point of the pipette by gently advancing it against the ball, under the 20x objective.  After breaking you will be able to see that the end is just a bit blunt.  A good pipette for injection, even in the small blastomeres of a late blastula, will have a resistance of about 80 megohms, as measured  in a bath of embryo medium.  The bath is grounded by an agar-bridged silver-silver chloride ground wire.	<p>
<b><i><p>
<H3><A NAME="bridges">Agar bridged ground wires</A></H3></i></b>	<p>
Plate silver wires electrolytically with chloride or dip into molten silver chloride.  (Dipped wires last longer than plated wires.)   Insert the silver chloride ground wire into a 15 cm length, small diameter PE tube filled with 3% agar in embryo medium; this is the agar bridge.  The ground wire should insert only about halfway into the agar.  Seal the agar bridge to the ground wire with epoxy and heat shrink tubing.  Store in the refrigerator with the tubing immersed in embryo medium. <b><i><p>
<H3>Preparing the Embryos</H3></i></b>	<p>
Collected the embryos about an hour after fertilization, stage, and clean. Under a stereo dissection microscope, remove the chorions with fine sharpened watchmakers forceps (Dumont no. 5) by gently teasing open a hole in the chorion, widening it sufficiently and carefully shaking out the embryo (see <b><A HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt4/4.1.html">Removing Embryos from their Chorions</A></b>, Chapter 4, for more details).  This is done in embryo medium, in agar-coated petri dishes (2% Difco Bactoagar). Once the embryos are free of the chorion, transfer with a fire polished pipette through several rinses in embryo medium to a clean agar dish.	<p>
Using both embryo medium and agar dishes greatly improves survival during and following dechorionation.  Embryo medium contains elevated Ca2+ which helps to keep the cells intact, and the agar provides a smooth nonsticky surface for the embryos to sit.  If you put a dechorionated embryo at cleavage or blastula stage directly on the plastic surface of a dish, and carry the dish around, you may end up with fragments or a dissociated suspension of dead cells.  After the injection, return the embryos to agar dishes for incubation, unless they are to be viewed immediately.	<p>
For the injection, mount the embryo in a depression slide in a drop of embryo medium, or if you need to orient it in a position in which it won't lie still, use 3% methylcellulose in embryo medium (see <b><A HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt4/4.4.html">Methyl Cellulose Mounting</A></b>, Chapter 4).<b><i><p>
<H3>Labeling the embryos</H3></i></b>	<p>
Use current injection to drive the electrode through the cell membrane. Blastomeres take an unusually high amount of negative current, driven by as much as 14 V with a duration of about 50 msec.  This method is vastly preferable to manually advancing the tip through the membrane or wiggling it through by capacitance "ringing".  Under visual control (20 x objective) advance the electrode against the cell of interest until you can see it dimple the cell surface. Then give it a blast of current and it should penetrate.  You often see the dimple disappear, and if you are monitoring voltage through the injection pipette you will see a negative 30 mV or so (as high as -70 mV) resting potential.  If you have damaged the cell, or if the electrode has passed completely through the cell into the small amount of extracellular space within the blastoderm, you will observe a positive change, not a negative one.  Deep cells can be penetrated by very prominently dimpling an EVL cell that has a deep cell positioned just beneath it. After the current injection, the pipette will have usually advanced through the thin EVL cell and into the underlying deep one.	<p>
Expel dye through the pipette by applying positive pressure, to lightly color the cell.  You can monitor the dye injection on a rig that is not equipped with fluorescence optics simply by watching the amount of color in the blastomere under Nomarski. The dye should diffuse throughout the whole cell, not brightly label a small dot-like inclusion within the cell.  If you can see the color easily with your eyes, you may have filled the cell too brightly.  You should not notice a volume change in the cell nor any evidence of damage (e.g. leaking cytoplasm) as you withdraw the pipette from the cell.  Generally you need fill the cell for only a few seconds.	<p>
If you are doing a clonal analysis and want to be sure that only a single cell is labeled, you need to look at the embryo immediately after the injection with fluorescence optics and image intensification.  There is no other way to be certain that dye has not spuriously labeled neighboring cells.<b><i><p>
<H3>Single looks at the clone</H3></i></b>	<p>
For a short-duration look at the labeled cells, as you might do in a fate mapping experiment, mount embryos in 3% methyl cellulose on a glass depression slide by gently inserting the embryo into a drop of methyl cellulose or by laying it on top of the gel, depending on how much methyl cellulose you wish to use.  Carefully orient the embryo using a nylon hair loop.  Add a thin film of embryo medium to cover the drop of methyl cellulose, and view it with no coverslip.  (See <b><A HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt4/4.4.html">Methyl Cellulose Mounting</A></b>, Chapter 4,  for more details.)	<p>
Screen the clones with the aid of an image intensifying camera (e.g. Videoscope) mounted on a compound microscope.  With signal intensification, one can detect very lightly labeled cells, using very low levels of exciting light, thereby avoiding photodamage to the labeled cells.  This is particularly important if you are going to view them repeatedly.   The camera output is sent directly to a video display monitor and also can be stored on a variety of storage devices, (e.g. a computer hard disk, an optical disk, or a VCR).<b><i><p>
<H3>Time lapse</H3></i></b>	<p>
The essential equipment for time lapse recording is the same as for single looks, with some additions.  Minimally a shutter and shutter controller are required for the fluorescence light source and a computer (or stimulator) to synchronize the timing of the shutters with storage of the image onto the storage device.  It is nice to have a similar control for the white light source.  The computer can also control the fine focus control of the microscope, and take 4-d video movies of the clone at multiple focal planes.  Additionally, the computer can control movement of the microscope stage, for X,Y excursion. An easy reliable system includes a MacII with a QuickCapture board running software to average and sometimes enhance images before storing them on a Panasonic OMDR.  The software was written by Paul Z. Myers and is available commercially as "Axovideo" by Axon Instruments.	<p>
For time lapse analysis, mount embryos in 0.1% agarose (dissolved in embryo medium) inside of a viewing chamber (see <b><A HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt4/4.2.html">Viewing chambers</A></b>, Chapter 4) with 3 spacers in between.  Pipette the embryo directly into a test tube containing several ml of warm agarose using a fire polished pipette, then pipette the embryo along with a small volume of agarose directly onto the bridged viewing chamber.  Orient the embryo with a nylon hairloop before coverslipping, the agarose will harden slowly and will never completely gel, but the coverslip will help immobilize the embryo in the desired position.  Seal the chamber with vaseline to keep it from drying.  Animals develop normally, albeit a little more slowly than normal in these chambers, and can be left as long as 24 hours.  (If a firmer agarose is used, the embryo will not develop normally for such a long time.)  To remove an embryo from a bridged coverslip chamber, immerse the chamber in a large volume of embryo medium and gently pry apart the two large coverslips.  If done gently, the embryo should pop out of the agarose and fall onto the bottom of the dish.<b>

(Source: T. Schilling)<p>
1.	Mount embryos in 1.2% agar (see <b><A HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt4/4.3.html">Agar Mounting</A></b>, Chapter 4).<p>
2.	Use a razor blade to cut flat faces in the agar approximately 1 mm from the embryos on the side to be injected and on the side directly opposite.<p>
<bMounting embryos for DiI labeling</b><br>  
<img src="5-12.gif"><p>
 3.	Slide the agar containing the embryos until it rests against the edge of the bridged coverslip. Glue it down with some extra agar and cover with Ringers.<p>
4.Remove wedges of agar with a platinum wire over the embryos so that the pipette has free access.  In older embryos (>24 h) use the wire to tease a small hole in the skin for the pipette to enter.<p>
5.	Place the embryos under a high-powered water immersion lens (e.g. 40x) with as large a working distance as possible and use Nomarski optics during the injection.<p>
6.	Dissolve 2 mg/ml DiI in dimethylformamide (or ethanol), in a microfuge tube.  Filter by centrifuging through an 0.2 &#181;m filter.  Store at 
4&#176;C.  This solution remains stable and can be used for months.<p>
7.	Backfill sharp glass micropipettes (tip resistances of approximately 100 megohms) with the dye.  When the tip is filled, backfill the remainder of the pipette with 0.2 M KCl.<p>
8.	Insert the pipette into a holder (e.g. WPI) attached to a current source.<p>
9.	Mount the pipette in the holder on a micromanipulator that allows you to bring it down to the embryo at an angle.  Once the embryo and the pipette are in focus, use the stage for the delicate movements.<p>
10.	Punch the pipette through the skin quickly. <p>
11.	Bring the tip into contact with the cell to be labeled.<p>
12.	Pass current through the pipette to an agar bridge ground electrode (see <b><i><A HREF="5.2.html#bridges">Agar bridged ground wires</A></i></b>,) gradually increasing the current until dye is emitted.<b><i><p>
<H3>For labeling neuronal processes</H3></i></b>	<p>
Monitor the labeling directly through the microscope. Labeled axons will become visible immediately near the injection site.   Wait 30 min or more to see more distant labeling.<b><i><p>
<H3>For lineage tracing</H3></i></b>	<p>
Monitor the labeling with an image intensifier and camera.  Labeled cell bodies will become visible slowly as ghost-like figures against the background. Initially, labeled cells seem to be very sensitive to illumination, but less so later.<b><p>

(Source: B. Melby and D. Raible)	<p>
This is a technique for intracellular labeling of small cells at gastrula stages or later.<b><i><p>
<H3>Electronics</H3></i></b>	<p>
The electronics set-up is used as a means to get the dye out of the electrode and into the cell.  Use an agar bridge (see <b><i><A HREF="5.2.html#bridges">Agar bridged ground wires</A></i></b>) for the bath ground.<b><i><p>
<H3>Pipettes</H3></i></b>	<p>
Success in single cell labeling lies primarily with the ability to make good pipettes.  Pipettes should be pulled the day of the experiment.  Allow at least 10 min for the tips to fill with dye.  Electrodes are pulled from glass capillaries (e.g. Sutter thick wall, O.D. 1.2 mm, I.D. .69 mm) with an inner filament for easy dye filling. 	<p>
The ideal pipette tip can be attained only by fine-tuning and testing.  The pipettes must be sufficiently sharp to pierce through the outer layer of the embryo, yet have a large enough tip diameter to pass dye.  They should have a long, sharp shank but a blunt tip.  An important feature of the pipettes is that they pass dye, either by current injection or by "ringing" the capacitance, and that they do not continuously leak dye.  The resistance of the pipettes provides a measure of reproducibility from one experiment to another.  Good pipettes usually have a resistance in the range of 100-300 M[[Omega]] when filled with 0.2 M KCl.  If the resistance is too high, it may indicate a problem with the dye, or with the bath ground, as well as with the pipette shape.	<p>
The dye should be dissolved in 0.2 M KCl and filtered (e.g. 0.2 &#181;m spin filters for the microcentrifuge).  A 3% solution of rhodamine dextran (Molecular Probes) works quite well.  Dye can be made in advance and stored at 4&#176;C in a sealed tube.  To fill pipette tips with dye, place a droplet of dye (about 0.5 &#181;l) at the back of the pipette.<b><i><p>
<H3>Labeling gastrula stage cells:</H3></i></b><b><p>
<H4>Embryo preparation and mounting:</H4></b>  Embryos should be removed from their chorions in agar-coated dishes using fine forceps.  After removing the chorions, transfer the embryos with a fire-polished pipet.  Experimental slides are made by painting several coats of nail polish in a ring of about 3 cm diameter, on a glass slide.  Mount embryos in methyl cellulose (see <b><A HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt4/4.4.html">Methyl Cellulose Mounting</A></b>, Chapter 4) to permit easy manipulation and reorientation.  Chilled methyl cellulose is stiffer, but tends to get bubbly as it warms up, therefore it is best to use methyl cellulose at room temperature.  <p>
1.	Spread a layer of methyl cellulose in the center of the experimental slide.  <p>
2.	Cover with embryo medium, being careful not to spill over the nail polish ring.<p>
3.	Transfer an embryo to the center of the slide.  Orient the embryo under the dissecting microscope by gently nudging it with a hair loop.  <p>
4.	When the embryo is in the preferred orientation, gently tamp it down into the methyl cellulose.  Over time, the methyl cellulose will become diluted with embryo medium and will become too fluid, so that the embryo may roll.  If this happens, remove the embryo and remount.  <p>
5.	Be sure to loosen the embryo from the methyl cellulose before trying to move it with a pipette.<b><p>
<H4>Labeling cells:</H4></b>  It is easiest to label cells if the embryo is oriented such that the surface to be labeled is at the top, lying flat.  The ideal situation is to have the embryo oriented so that the cells to be labeled are easily visible in reference to landmarks such as the embryonic shield or the margin. <p>
1.	Check the orientation of the embryo at low and then high magnification, to be sure that it is appropriate.  <p>
2.	Place a hanging droplet of embryo medium on the water immersion lens (e.g. 40x) and gently slide the lens into place over the embryo, to avoid rolling the embryo.  <p>
3.	Position the bath ground at the back of the slide, being sure that there is continuity between the agar and the embryo medium.<p>
4.	Raise the microscope objective so that there is plenty of space between the objective and the embryo.  <p>
5.	Backfill a pipette with 0.5 M KCl, place it in the pipette holder, and attach the holder to the amplifier probe which should be mounted on the micromanipulator.  There should be no large bubbles in the pipette or holder; they will cause electrical discontinuity.<p>
6.	Advance the pipette into the embryo medium and position it above the embryo using the white light and by viewing it from the side of the microscope.  <p>
7.	Locate the tip under magnification, and check to make sure that it isn't broken.  <p>
8.	Switch on the amplifier, this should only be turned on when there is a complete circuit (i.e. from probe, through the bath and bath ground, back to the amplifier).  <p>
9.	A good pipette will release a small puff of dye when the capacity compensation (usually a button, sometimes a dial) is turned on (i.e. "ringing the capacitance"), or when the pipette check is pressed (this injects a small amount of current).  A bad pipette will leak, or sometimes not release dye at all. Throw it away and get a new one, but be sure to turn off the amplifier before you pull the pipette out of the bath.<p>
10.	Carefully lower the pipette to the level of the embryo, keeping it in focus.  Superficial cells can be labeled by positioning the pipette above the cell and lowering the tip through the EVL layer until the cell membrane dimples.  <p>
11.	Monitor the fluorescence, and label the cell by ringing the capacitance, or by injecting current.  Ringing the capacitance causes the pipette tip to vibrate, enabling penetration and it will also cause a little bit of dye to be released.  <p>
12.	After a cell has been labeled, rapidly remove the pipette using the stage control or the micromanipulator, and turn off the amplifier.<p>
13.	To label cells in deeper layers, it is best to bring the pipette in from the side.  Focus on the cell layer of interest.  Bring the pipette into the same focal plane as this cell layer.  Advance the pipette up to the cell using a microdrive, or fine micromanipulator adjustment.	<p>
Sometimes cells along the pipette track tend to be labeled by dye leaking from the tip. The tip may appear to have passed through these cells, but there is still continuity with their membranes.  Single cell labels can be achieved by stopping dye injection as soon as one cell starts to label.  Because of this problem, it is important to check the fluorescence without Nomarski optics (it will be much brighter) in order to see all of the cells that have been labeled.<b><p>
<H4>Localizing the labeled cell:</H4></b>  For mapping purposes, it is best to check the cell's location using three different orientations of the embryo.  In the orientation in which the embryo was labeled, check the cell's distance from the margin under the 40x water immersion lens.  Then turn the embryo onto it's side and check the cell's radial depth at 40x.  It is important to have a fairly precise side orientation, or else the cell may appear deeper or shallower than it is.  The depth can also be assessed by focussing up and down in the original orientation, although this method gives no information about the relationship of the cell to the hypoblast. Finally, assess the position with respect to the dorsal midline by orienting the embryo animal pole up and looking at it under low power (10x objective).<b><i><p>
<H3>Labeling single cells in older embryos</H3></i></b><p>
1.	Mount embryos in agar as described in the section on <b><A HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt4/4.3.html">Agar Mounting</A></b> (Chapter 4).  Orient the embryo so that the cell of interest is visible with Nomarski optics and accessible with the pipette. <p>
2.	Focus on the cell of interest, and bring the pipette along side the embryo in the same focal plane.  <p>
3.	Using the stage controls, force the mounted embryo against the pipette until the skin springs back and the pipette tip enters the embryo.  <p>
4.	Move the embryo away with the stage controls until there is no compression of the embryo by the pipette.  <p>
5.	Then, using the fine control of the micromanipulator, move the pipette into position against the cell to be labeled.  For cells close to the surface, the pipette can be inserted into the embryo at a different focal plane.<p>
6.	Label the cell as described above, and quickly remove the pipette from the embryo by moving the embryo away with the stage controls.<b><i><p>

<b><H2><A NAME="5">Laser-ablation of Single Cells</A></H2></b>
(Source: J. Eisen)	<p>
In principle, almost any cell in the zebrafish embryo that can be visualized (e.g. with Nomarski DIC optics) can be ablated by laser-irradiation.  The power output of the laser and the type of optical system used to focus the beam onto the cell will determine whether, in practice, a particular cell can be ablated.  The following protocol has been used successfully to ablate single identified neurons in the spinal cord, individual floor plate, muscle, notochord, and neural crest cells, and entire ganglia.	<p>
Mount embryos either on microslides in 1.2% agar (see <b><A HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt4/4.3.html">Agar Mounting</A></b>, Chapter 4) in embryo medium or between bridged coverslips (see <b><A HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt4/4.2.html">Viewing Chambers</A></b>, Chapter 4) in embryo medium in such a way that the cell of interest is easily visualized with Nomarski DIC optics using a compound microscope.  Use a water immersion lens with as high a numerical aperture as possible.  A Zeiss 40xW lens with a 1.6 mm working distance is a good choice. A simple method for laser-irradiation is to focus the laser beam through the port of the vertical illuminator.  This set up is described in Sulston and White [Sulston, J.E. and J.G. White (1980) Regulation and cell autonomy during postembryonic development of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.  <i>Devel. Biol</i>. <b>78</b>:577-597].
 More detail about the design of such systems can be found in Berns, M.W. (1972) Partial cell irradiation with a tunable organic dye laser.  <i>Nature</i> <b>240</b>:483-485.	<p>
There are currently at least two types of pulsed lasers available that work well for single cell ablations: dye-pumped pulse lasers, such as those made by Phase-R and Candela, and pulsed nitrogen lasers with dye modules, such as those made by Laser Sciences.  The advantage of the first type is that it contains a Helium-Neon spotting laser for relatively easy alignment.  The advantage of the second type is that it is cheaper, smaller, and quieter.  In both cases, you can use coumarin 450 (made by Exciton Corp.) as the dye source; the dye is dissolved in high grade methanol (1 gram/4 liters for the dye-pumped laser and 17.5 mg/20 ml for the nitrogen laser).  	<p>
To ablate a cell, focus the laser microbeam onto the cell nucleus, or onto the cell membrane.  Depending on the cell, the condition of the dye, and the type of laser, from 1-100 pulses are needed to ablate a cell.  Cells may die instantly after irradiation, or they may take up to 15 min.  It is important to watch the cell die, or to have an independent measure, such as the loss of cell-specific antibody labeling.  As cells die, their nuclei typically become granular in appearance and often swell.	<p>
Once the cell of interest has been ablated, the embryo should be removed from the agar or the bridged coverslip and placed in a dish of embryo medium to continue development.<b>

<b><i><H1>CHAPTER 5 - CELLULAR METHODS</H1></i></b><p>
<H2><A NAME="6">Overview of Single Cell Transplantation</A></H2></b>
(Source: R. Ho)	<p>
Successful cell transplantation in zebrafish embryos requires a steady hand, a calm spirit, and a knowledge of embryonic anatomy.  In addition, concern for the continued good health of the embryos and addition of penicillin and streptomycin to all media are necessary. 	<p>
Unless one plans to perform transplantation of cells within an individual embryo, separate groups of donor embryos and host embryos are needed. Ordinarily, one should label one of the groups of embryos (usually the donors) so that after transplantation, the transplanted cells can be distinguished from host cells.  We have had great success with the family of highly fluorescent dextran compounds, in particular, rhodaminated-dextran, although fluoresceinated-dextran also works.  Donor embryos are labeled with glass micropipettes.  A pipette is filled with the dye solution and attached to an apparatus that forces the dye out of the pipette with air pressure.  The tip of the pipette is then gently broken off, generally by touching it to a pre-shaped glass rod, and inserted into the yolk cell of a donor embryo immersed in embryo medium in a depression slide.  A small amount of dye is then expelled into the yolk before withdrawing the pipette.  Dye injected before the third cleavage division will be distributed throughout the blastoderm via the cytoplasmic bridges between cells within the embryo.  See <b><A HREF="5.2.html">Blastomere Lineage Analysis</A></b>, for more detailed methods.	<p>
The technique of transplanting cells has taken us many years to perfect and involves the use of specialized transplantation pipettes formed from glass capillaries.  Considerable "hands on" skill is required for production of the transplantation pipette.  The capillaries are pulled to fine tips on a Flaming-Brown electrode puller.  The tips are either broken off at an angle using a hand-held razor blade or beveled with a commercial beveler and then fire polished with a micro-forge.  Frequently, a sharp 'spear-tip' is tooled onto the end of the pipette by briefly touching the pipette to the hot wire of the microforge and drawing out the molten glass into a shape resembling that shown in .  This sharp spear-tip is useful for penetrating the outer epithelium of the embryo.  A smooth and symmetrical pipette tip is required for successful transplantation.  Ideally, the inner diameter should equal the diameter of the transplanted cells.  For this reason, pre-formed transplantation pipettes with various diameters should be prepared.<p>

<img align=middle src="5-21.gif">
<B>  Spear-tip</B>	<p>
During cell transplantation, arrange the labeled donor embryos and unlabeled host embryos on a depression slide in 3% methyl cellulose or 1.2% agar dissolved in 10% modified Hank's medium and cover with just enough medium to keep them wet.  Fill the transplantation pipette with mineral oil and attach it to an oil-filled Hamilton syringe with polyethylene tubing. Mount the transplantation pipette onto a micro-manipulator and position within the labeled donor embryo.  Draw cells into the pipette with suction from the Hamilton syringe.  Withdraw the pipette, now containing labeled donor cells, and insert it into the unlabeled host embryo and expel the transplanted cells. Carefully withdraw the pipette from the host embryo and maintain this embryo with standard procedures.<b>

<b><i><H1>CHAPTER 5 - CELLULAR METHODS</H1></i></b><p>
<H2><A NAME="7">Detailed Procedure for Transplanting Single Cells</A></H2></b>
(Source: J. Eisen)<b><i><p>
<H3>Preparation of micropipettes</H3></i></b>	<p>
Three types of micropipettes are required for this operation, one for labeling donor embryos, one for dissecting a hole in the skin of embryos, and one for transplanting single neurons.  Prepare the micropipettes for labeling donor embryos the same way as those for labeling blastomeres for lineage studies (see <b><A HREF="5.2.html">Blastomere Lineage Analysis</A></b>).  Prepare the dissecting micropipettes the same way as those used for labeling single cells with lineage tracers (see <b><A HREF="5.4.html">Labeling Single Cells With Lineage Tracers</A></b>). Prepare the micropipettes for transplanting single cells as follows:  <p>
1.	On a programmable puller, such as the Flaming Brown, use a multistage pull to make a micropipette suitable for patch clamping.  It is important to use capillary glass which does not contain an internal filament, as this filament can destroy cells during the transplantation procedure.  <p>
2.	While watching under a stereomicroscope, break the tip to the desired diameter, typically 10-12 &#181;m, by pushing it lightly against the back end of a pair of forceps.  The break should be clean, so that the tip surface is flat and perpendicular to the long axis of the micropipette. <p>
3.	The tip can be fire polished in a microforge, or the micropipette can be used without fire polishing the tip.<b><i><p>
<H3>Labeling donor embryos</H3></i></b>	<p>
Label donor embryos at the 1-16 cell stage by injecting 5-10% rhodamine dextran in 0.2 M KCl into the yolk.  <p>
1.	Remove embryos from their chorions (see <b><A HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt4/4.1.html">Removing Embryos from Their Chorions</A></b>, Chapter 4).<p>
2.	Place them in embryo medium in the well of a depression slide.  <p>
3.	Inject rhodamine dextran into the yolk with pressure using a broken-tip micropipette, with the technique used to label individual blastomeres (see <b><A HREF="5.2.html">Blastomere Lineage Analysis</A></b>).<p>
4.	Transfer the labeled embryos to a 1.5 cm petri dish containing embryo medium and allow them to grow to the desired stage.<b><i><p>
<H3>Fabrication of chambers for mounting embryos</H3></i></b>	<p>
Chambers for holding embryos during transplantation can be made from microscope slides and cover slips.  It is advisable to clean the slides and cover slips with microsoap before beginning.<p>
1.	Glue two 22x22 mm cover slips together, so that one extends over the other one by 1-2 mm.  <p>
2.	Glue these cover slips onto a microslide so that the upper cover slip extends over the lower one and this overhang is positioned precisely at the center of the slide (see diagram).  <p>
3.	When the glue dries, paint a ring of nail polish around the slide to make a water resistant area.  <p>
<img src="5-24.gif"><br>
<b>Chamber for cell transplantation</b><p>

<b><i><p>
<H3>Agar mounting of embryos</H3></i></b><p>
1.	Mount embryos in 1.2% agar as described in the section on <b><A HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt4/4.3.html">Agar Mounting</A></b>, Chapter 4, using Ringers solution.<p>
2.	Place a drop of Ringers over the embryo in the agar.<p>
3.	Using a fine needle, cut a wedge in the agar and remove it, so that an appropriate region of the embryo is exposed.<p>
3.	Using two fine-tipped micropipettes, make a small hole in the skin of the embryo.<p>
4.	Mount a labeled donor and an unlabeled host embryo side by side.  Since many cells can be taken from one labeled embryo, it is often expedient to mount a single donor embryo and 3-4 host embryos in the same chamber.<p>

<img  src="5-25.gif"><br>
<B>Transplantation slide with agar-mounted embryos</B>

<b><i><p>
<H3>Transplantation apparatus</H3></i></b>	<p>
The transplantation apparatus is a 10 &#181;l Hamilton syringe connected to a worm gear drive or a micrometer drive.  This provides very fine control of the suction and pressure required to pick up and expel cells.  Fill the Hamilton syringe with light mineral oil and connect a length of mineral oil-filled polyethylene tubing to it.  Attach the tubing to a pressure fitting micropipette holder (available from WPI).  The holder must be firmly attached to a micromanipulator, so that the micropipette can be moved from embryo to embryo.  It is also important to use a holder with a gasket that tightens by screwing the holder tip, so that the micropipette can be mounted firmly.  It is useful to have a mineral oil-filled 5 ml syringe as a reservoir between the Hamilton syringe and the polyethylene tubing.  This reservoir can be used for bleeding air from the system, because it is essential that the mineral oil be entirely free of air bubbles.	<p>
Fill the micropipette holder with mineral oil.  Backfill the transplantation micropipette to within 5-7 mm of its shoulder with mineral oil using a 2.5 inch, 30 gauge needle, inserted into the micropipette holder.  Tighten the pipette into the holder.  The pressure of tightening the holder will force the mineral oil into the tip.  If mineral oil is expelled from the tip at this point, equalize the pressure by creating a small amount of suction with the micrometer or worm drive.<hr>

<img src="5-26.gif">
 <b><i><hr>
<H3>Transplantation</H3></i></b><p>
1.	Place the chamber on the stage of a compound microscope equipped with Nomarski optics and a long working distance water-immersion objective (preferably Zeiss 40xW).  It is best if the microscope has a fixed stage; otherwise the transplant-ation micropipette will need to be mounted on the stage.<p>
2.	Bring the cell of interest in the donor embryo into focus.  <p>
3.	Position the micropipette under the objective and suck a little of the Ringer solution into the tip.  It is essential that the oil/Ringer meniscus is visible; this is an important reference point and allows the amount of suction or pressure to be monitored visually by the movement of the meniscus within the micropipette tip.  <p>
4.	Once the meniscus is stabilized, move the micropipette to a position near the hole in the skin of the donor embryo, using the micromanipulator.  <p>
5.	Insert the micropipette into the donor embryo and position it so that it is nearly touching the cell.  <p>
6.	Suck the cell into the micropipette tip using the worm or micrometer drive.<p>
7.	Withdraw the micropipette from the donor embryo and move the chamber (this is most easily done using the stage controls) so that the micropipette is now located next to the hole in the skin of the host embryo.  <p>
8.	Insert the micropipette into the appropriate position of the host embryo.  <p>
9.	Expel the cell with gentle pressure, again using the worm drive or micrometer.  <p>
10.	Withdraw the micropipette from the host embryo.  	<p>
A word of caution, anesthetics such as tricaine (mesab; MS-222; ethyl-m-aminobenzoate methanesulphonate) will kill single cells during the transplantation procedure.  Therefore, if you need to transplant cells between embryos which are twitching, rather than using an anesthetic you should use a nonmotile mutant.<p>
<b><i>
<H3>Dismounting embryos</H3></i></b>	<p>
Remove embryos from the agar by gently  separating the sides of the agar where it has been cut to expose a portion of the embryo (see section on <b><A HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt4/4.3.html">Agar Mounting</A></b>, Chapter 4).  Move the embryos to fresh Ringer containing penicillin/ streptomycin (1% v/v pen-strep solution containing 5,000 units penicillin and 5mg streptomycin per ml in 0.9% sodium chloride in Ringer).  It is essentially that the embryos be maintained in Ringer until the hole in the skin heals, or else they will fall apart.

<H2><A NAME="8">An Inexpensive and Easy Microinjection Embryo-Tray</A></H2>
(Source: F. Argenton, S. Bitzur, and A. Yarden)	<p>
We have developed a new inexpensive and easy method to position zebrafish embryos for microinjection.  Our technique is a simplification of the method published by Eric S. Weinberg (<i>Zebrafish Science Monitor</i> <b>2</b>(1):4-5) and of the method taught by Manfred Schartl in the course "Gene Expression and Regulation in Laboratory Fish", W&uuml;rzburg Germany, Feb. 1993.	<p>
Embryos in their chorions are pushed into depressions in an agarose disk which are formed with 1 mm capillaries.  The depressions are round and gently "hug" the embryos in such a way that the embryos remain in the depression during microinjections and while the micropipette is pulled out after injection. There is, thus, no need to use a plastic cover  for impeding the movement of the embryos as described in the previous method.  In addition, once the embryos are positioned, the tray can be moved around without the embryos changing their positions.<p>
<img src="5-29.gif"><br>
<B>Microinjection embryo tray</B>	<p>
1.  Place a few 1 mm x 5-6 cm glass capillaries (W.P.I.) on the bottom of a 90 x 15 mm petri dish.  Pour 20 ml of warm 1.2% agarose (prepared in embryo medium containing 1 ppm methylene blue) over the capillaries (<b>Fig.-a</b>).  Once the capillaries start floating, push them back down to the bottom of the plate with fine forceps and arrange them in parallel rows (<b>Fig.-b</b>).	<p>
2.  When the agarose has solidified, reduce the diameter of the agarose disk by cutting around its perimeter with a razor blade (<b>Fig.-c</b>).  Turn the dish over and let the agarose disk containing the gel-coated capillaries fall onto another wet petri dish (<b>Fig.-d,e</b>).  Seal the dish onto the plate with more warm, liquid agarose (<b>Fig.-f</b>).	<p>
3.  Cover the capillaries with embryo medium and gently remove them from the agarose with fine forceps.  U-shaped grooves remain in the agarose. The plate can be stored in the cold  and reused for several injections.	<p>
4.  Gently squeeze the embryos, still in their chorions, into the grooves and orient them  towards the injection pipette with fine forceps hooded with a plastic tip.  We prefer to orient the embryos with their animal poles towards the pipette (<B>Fig.-bottom</B>).  More then 20 embryos can be lined up in each groove.	<p>
5.  For microinjection we move the petri dish by hand to position the embryo below the injection pipette.  We use a foot pedal controlled Eppendorf 5242 microinjector, position the micropipettes with a Leitz micromanipulator, and monitor the procedure with a Wild stereo-microscope at x32 magnification.	<p>
6.  Following injection, lift the embryos up out of the grooves.

<P>
Treat embryos with bleach (0.5% solution for 2 min) before removing the chorions.  Decant the bleach solution and rinse with 10% sterile Hank's saline. Remove the chorions with watchmaker's forceps or by soaking the embryos in pronase (see <A HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt4/4.1.html">Removing Embryos from Chorions</A>, Chapter 4).  Embryos that can move should be anesthetized by soaking in tricaine or by chilling on ice. Embryos can be dissociated with 0 Ca2+ up to about 16 h of development.  Older animals should be dissociated with the protease treatment or by dissection.

<title>Genetic Methods</title>
<H1>CHAPTER 7 - GENETIC METHODS</H1>
<H2><A NAME="conventions for naming zebrafish genes">Conventions for Naming Zebrafish Genes</A></H2>
<I>(Source: M. Mullins)</I>
<BR>Genetic designations vary immensely from organism to organism, and the zebrafish community recognizes the importance of agreeing upon conventions for naming mutants and genes.  The following conventions have been chosen by most labs to minimize confusion and maximize the utility of the nomenclature and the ease with which people outside (as well as those within) the field can follow the field.  It is very important that the entire zebrafish community adopt one set of conventions.
<p><H3>Naming genes identified by mutation</H3>
1.	The name of a gene identified by mutation should refer to the ostensible phenotype of the mutant without any inherent interpretation of the phenotype.  It should not be too specific. Determining the molecular mechanism by which a phenotype is produced can be a formidable task and should not be inferred by the name of the gene.  The name should be a mnemonic for the mutant phenotype.  For example, cyclops is an excellent name for the mutation isolated in Eugene1 which produces a cyclopic phenotype.
<p>2.	The name should be unique, one or two words, and italicized. Longer names tend to be impractical to use.  Avoid choosing an names identical to those used in other species.
<p>3.	For mutations in different genes that all have similar phenotypes, a single name followed by consecutive numbers should not be used.  This nomenclature makes the field less accessible to the outsider.  A mutation in a second gene resulting in cyclopia could be called fused-eyes, but should not be called cyclops2.
<p><H3>Naming cloned genes</H3>
1.	For nonhomologous "novel" genes identified by cloning, the conventions above apply with the exception of the use of numbers.  For a new gene family, it would be appropriate to name the individual genes in the family with a single family name followed by consecutive numbers.  The numbers would immediately follow the name with no hyphen or space between them.  No further letters would follow this number in the gene name.  For example, abc1, abc2, abc3 are appropriate; however, abc1A, abc1B, and abc1C are inappropriate.
<p>2.	For homologous genes cloned (rather than those with just some sequence similarity which are probably not true homologues), the same name as in the counterpart organism should be given to the zebrafish gene.  This would make it easier to follow "homologue" work in different organisms.  The fish gene should not be preceded with "Z" or "Zf", otherwise there will be thousands of zebrafish genes beginning with "Z....".  For example, a zebrafish homologue to the mouse Wnt1 gene becomes the zebrafish wnt1 gene.
<p><H3>Abbreviated name</H3>
A gene identified either by mutation or molecular analysis should be abbreviated by three lower case italicized letters or by three lower case letters and a number (no hyphen) italicized.  All letters should be roman, i.e. no greek letters.  The letters should be unique with respect to other named zebrafish mutants and genes and should be letters derived from the full name.  For example, the abbreviated name for cyclops is cyc.  Numbers should generally not be used in naming a gene only identified by mutation.  When a number is included in the name (see Naming cloned genes, above), there should be no hyphen or space between the letters and the number.  
<p><H3>Alleles</H3>
The allele-specific designation should be denoted by a superscript. Dominant mutations will be designated by "d" in the first position of the superscript.  All allele names without a "d" then indicate a recessive allele.  The next position of the superscript (this will be the first position if the mutation is recessive) will be a lower case letter that designates the laboratory in which the mutation was isolated.  This laboratory letter is then followed by unique numbers and/or letter(s) for the particular allele which completes the allele designation. Because "d" will denote "dominant", "d" cannot be used for a laboratory designation.  Each allele designation from a given laboratory would be unique. Because each laboratory has a different letter designation, all mutant alleles from all zebrafish laboratories would be unique and could be accessed easily by computer. 
<p>
	For example, in Eugene all allele names begin with "b" and are numbered sequentially, approximately in the order they were recovered.  cycb16 is an allele of cyclops that was isolated in Eugene (b).  b16 is a unique allele designation in Eugene.  No other mutant allele in Eugene or elsewhere will have this allele designation whether it be cyclops, spadetail, golden, etc.
<p><H3>Priority in names</H3>
1.	When mutations in the same gene are found independently in more than one laboratory and given different names, then the name that appears first in the literature will be given priority. Sometimes different mutant alleles of the same gene can have very different phenotypes and it may take a while before it is shown that the mutations are in the same gene.  The first published name would get priority and all other alleles would adopt this designation.
<p>2.	When a mutation is found in a previously cloned zebrafish gene (which has been published), then the mutant will take the cloned gene's name.  For example, if in Monte Westerfield's laboratory a mutation is induced in the engrailed1 gene, then the mutation in the gene would also be referred to as engrailed1.
<p>3.	If both the cloned gene and the mutation already exist with different names and at some later point they are found to be the same gene, then the name of the mutation takes priority even if the cloned gene was named first.  In this case the unique name of the mutation would probably be more relevant to the function of the gene than the cloned gene's name, and this unique mutant name would be easier to remember than the gene name.  If in the example above, a mutant named braindead (bdd) had been characterized, and it was later discovered to be a mutation in the engrailed1 gene, then the engrailed1 gene would now be designated bdd.
<p>	With these conventions, some changes have already been made in mutant designations. Two previously identified recessive pigmentation mutants golden-1 and golden-2 contain mutations in two different genes.  Charline Walker and Chuck Kimmel have decided to change the name of golden-2 to brass (brs) and golden-1 to just golden (gol).  This should avoid any future confusion about golden-2 being a second allele of golden.
<p>
<H3>An unsettled issue</H3>
In the case of zebrafish homologues where the nomenclature in the counterpart organism is contrary to our nomenclature, there is still no convention. The two schools of thought can be illustrated through the naming of the zebrafish homologue to the mouse Brachyury gene, abbreviated as T.
<p>	One nomenclature puts the importance of a common nomenclature between organisms above that of the nomenclature within zebrafish.  In this case the zebrafish homologue of the mouse T gene would also be named T in zebrafish. As discussed below, it would be against our conventions to capitalize the gene name and to use only one letter, however, since in mouse the abbreviated name is capitalized we would now capitalize the name in zebrafish.  
<p>	A second nomenclature puts the importance of the zebrafish nomenclature above that of a nomenclature common among organisms.  In this case, the zebrafish homologue to the mouse Brachyury or T gene could be named brachyury and abbreviated in zebrafish as bry to follow our nomenclature.

<H2>Suggested Guidelines for Maintaining Mutant stocks</H2> 
<I>(Source: M. Halpern)</I> 
<H3>Densities</H3>
<p>	With adequate water flow, stocks are routinely kept at densities of:
<BR><ul><LI>1 fish per 1/4 gallon `tanklet'
	<LI>25 fish per 5 gallon tank
	<LI>50 fish per 10 gallon tank
	<LI>150 fish per 30 gallon tank
</ul><p>
<H3>Intercrosses</H3>
<p>	To obtain maximal numbers of identified heterozygotes, keep mutant working stocks as intercrosses from identified heterozygous parents. The wild-type progeny from several intercrosses should be pooled to maximize the genetic diversity of the stock.  Use identified fish from one generation for experiments, while another generation of intercross progeny are growing towards sexual maturity.  On average, make a new generation every 4-6 months.
<p>+/m      X    +/m

<BR>+/+    +/m    m/m
<BR>1/3        2/3     (die)
<p>
<H3>Outcrosses</H3>
To maintain a mutant line, heterozygous fish should also be outcrossed to the wild-type main line. Ideally, the outcross stock should also be derived from group matings rather than a single cross.  Identified heterozygous males can be used for freezing sperm.
<p>+/m    X    +/+
<BR>+/m         +/+
<BR>1/2         1/2
<p><H3>Tank usage</H3>
Depending on the use of a given stock, estimate the number of tanks required for stock maintenance, mutant recovery, and experimental purposes:
<p>
<H4>Category 1:	Working stock for maintenance and low level usage
</H4>	
<BR>3 X 5 gallon:		
<ul>
<LI>2 for identified heterozygotes
<LI>1 for wild-type outcross
</ul><p>4 X 10 gallon:
<ul>
<LI>2 to identify heterozygotes
<LI>2 for growing fish to sexual maturity
</ul><p><H4>Category 2:	Recovering mutations from clonal fish</H4>
<ul><LI>F1:	1 tanklet for original female
<LI>1 X 10 gallon for first outcross (approximately 50 fish)
<p><LI>	F2:	4 tanklets to hold fish being identified
<LI>2 X 5 gallon initially for intercrosses
</ul><p>	<H4>Category 3:	Major working line</H4> 
<p>		Tanks are needed for 
<ul><LI>intercrosses
<LI>wild-type outcross
<LI>double mutant stocks
<LI>special backgrounds (i.e. golb1 for line-age or nicb1 for physiology)
<LI>extra females for squeezing purposes
<LI>identified single and double mutant heterozygotes
</ul>
<p>	This means at least:  10 X 5 gallon, 5 X 10 gallon and 2 X 30 gallon.

<title>Genetic Methods</title>
<H1>CHAPTER 7 - GENETIC METHODS</H1>
<H2>Overview of Methods for Parthenogenesis</A></H2>
<I>(Source: C. Walker)</I>
<p>
Zebrafish eggs are fertilized outside the body making it possible to manipulate the process to advantage.  For example, haploid embryos can be produced by fertilizing eggs with sperm that have been irradiated with ultra violet light (UV sperm) destroying the sperm DNA so that it cannot contribute genetically to the embryo but leaving the sperm intact and able to activate the eggs.  Haploid embryos develop from the female genetic complement only.  Any mutation carried by the female will be seen in her haploid offspring.  Additionally it is possible to make these haploid embryos diploid by application of pressure or heat shock during early developmental stages.  This section provides an overview of these genetic methods.  Detailed procedures follow in a later section.
<p>
<H3>UV Sperm</H3>
Sperm is collected and pooled into ice cold Hank's solution as described in Embryo Production By In Vitro Fertilization, page 1. It is important to keep the sperm solution relatively dilute because of possible shielding of the UV.
<p>	Ice is put in the bottom half of a 10 cm glass petri plate.  Sperm is pipetted onto a watch glass sitting on top of the ice taking care not to introduce bubbles.  Removing the glass lid under a UV lamp exposes the sperm to UV. Sperm is irradiated by a Sylvania 18 inch 15W germicidal lamp at 38 cm or 15 inches from the watch glass for 2 minutes with gentle mixing.  Wear latex gloves and glass safety glasses for your own protection from the UV.  Use a clean pipette to pipette the sperm into a clean glass tube and kept on ice.  It will fertilize eggs efficiently for up to 90 minutes (just as non-irradiated sperm) producing haploid embryos with only 25 chromosomes in each cell.
<p>
<H3>Haploid Embryos</H3>
<p>	Haploid embryos have a characteristic syndrome.  The body is shorter and thicker than a diploid; the brain is less clearly sculptured; the ears are variable in number; and the heart beats in a swollen pericardial cavity.  Haploid cells are smaller than diploid cells and there are problems with organogenesis.  For example, blood cells seem to be too large for the blood vessels and most haploid embryos have circulation problems.  Haploid embryos live only about five days.
<p>	For all their faults, haploids are consistent enough to be useful for identifying changes in early development caused by mutations.  The haploid mutant phenotype sometimes differs from the mutant phenotype observed in diploids (often the haploid phenotype is more severe), but one is alerted to the mutation and can do the appropriate crosses to produce a diploid.
<p>	Haploid embryos are used to identify new mutations in mutagenized females as well as to screen and identify mutation-bearing heterozygous females.
<p>
<H3>Production of Gynogenetic Diploid Embryos</H3>
There are two times during the first cell cycle of a UV-fertilized egg when there is a diploid complement of chromosomes from the female.  One is during the second meiotic division and the other is during the first mitosis.  Preventing chromosome separation at either of these times will restore the diploid number of chromosomes.
<p><H4>1. Early Pressure</H4>
When eggs are first laid, the chromosomes are condensed, ready to separate in the second meiotic division.  A pulse of hydrostatic pressure (EP) at the right time will break down the spindle, preventing chromosome separation and the extrusion of the polar body.  The then diploid set of chromosomes replicates and separates in the first mitotic division, producing a viable gynogenetic diploid embryo.
<p>		Eggs are squeezed from the female and fertilized with UV-irradiated sperm as described in Embryo Production By In Vitro Fertilization, page 1.  The timer is started when the first water is added to the egg-sperm mixture.  Eggs are quickly put into a pressure vial and the vial filled totally with egg water.  The vial is capped with a rubber sheet and plastic snap cap being careful not to leave any air bubbles in the vial.  The vial is put into the water-filled French pressure chamber and the chamber is put on the French Press.  At 1.4 min after fertilization, pressure is applied until the gauge reads 1800 (or 8,000 lbs per square inch).  At 6 min, the pressure is slowly released over a period of 1 min.  The vial is removed and the eggs left undisturbed in the vial at least an hour.  Then fertile eggs are sorted from infertile or dead eggs.

<p>	It is easy to stop the second meiotic division and one can anticipate 50%-80% of the offspring to be viable in an EP experiment.  The males and females which grow from an EP stock are fertile, but not quite as hardy as normal diploid fish.
<p>	Even though the genes from EP diploids all come from the female, they are not homozygous at all loci.  This is because sister chromatids in the 2nd meiosis have already undergone crossing over in the first meiosis.  Genes close to the centromere are likely to be homozygous; those far from the centromere are not.  In fact, EP is used to construct a crude genetic map of linkage of genetic loci to the centromere.
<p>	The vials used for EP experiments are 5 ml milk dilution vials covered with a rubber sheet and a plastic snap cap.  A hole is cut in the cap exposing the rubber sheet to the pressure.  Two vials fit comfortably in the French pressure chamber so two batches of eggs fertilized simultaneously can be pressure treated together.
<p><H4>	2.  Heat Shock</H4>
<p>		The aim of heat shock (HS) is to prevent chromosome separation and cytokinesis of the first mitotic division.  It is different from EP in that meiosis has occurred and the haploid set of chromosomes of the female have replicated themselves prior to the 1st cell division.  They are, therefore, homozygous for every gene.  Heat shock prevents the first cell division by some unknown mechanism, thus restoring diploidy in some embryos.  The second cell division becomes the "first" and so on.
<p>		Eggs are squeezed from the female and fertilized with UV-irradiated sperm.  After 5 min the eggs are transferred to heat shock cylinders (plastic cylinders with a mesh bottom described below) and put into a large beaker filled with egg water sitting in a 28.5&bull;C water bath. At 13 min after fertilization, the vial is moved quickly to a large beaker of water at 41.4&bull;C transferring as little of the 28.5&bull;C water as possible. After two minutes, the cylinder is moved back to the 28.5&bull;C water.  After sitting in the 28.5&bull;C beaker for 45 min, the eggs are transferred to a glass beaker and eventually the surviving embryos are sorted from the infertile or dead eggs.
<p>
T = 0				Fertilize eggs with UV-irradiated sperm<BR>
	T = 05 min			Transfer embryos to 28.5C<BR>
	T = 13 min			Move cylinder from 28.5 to 41C<BR>
	T = 15 min			Move cylinder from 41 to 28.5C<BR>
<p>
	It is very difficult to stop the first mitotic division.  Only 10%-20% of the embryos survive as diploids to grow to adulthood.  Homozygous diploids can be fertile males or females.
<p>	We make HS cylinders from Beckman Ultraclear centrifuge tubes by cutting off the bottom of the tube and attaching a nylon mesh bottom using methylene chloride as the "glue" (done in a hood).  The thin plastic of the cylinders transfers very little heat or cold.
<p>	The temperature of the 41C bath is held very accurately.  Too low a temperature produces haploids and too high a temperature kills embryos.  Different strains may require a slightly different temperature.  An immersible stirrer drives a magnetic stirring bar in the 41C beaker to keep the temperature uniform.

<I>(Source: R. Andrews and T. Ellis)</I>
<BR>This method allows the production of homozygous haploid embryos for the purpose of screening for recessive mutations.  Haploid embryos develop fairly normally for the first few days, but eventually develop bent tails and vacuolated body cavities.  They are inviable.
<p>
Overview of haploid production<BR>
1.  Maintain fish according to the schedule for Embryo Production By In Vitro Fertilization, page 1.<BR>
2.  Obtain sperm as described for Embryo Production By In Vitro Fertilization, page 1 and transfer them (in the 0.5 ml drop of full strength Hank's saline) to a watch glass.<BR>
3.  Irradiate sperm with an ultraviolet light (UV, e.g. 38 cm from a 43 cm long Sylvania germicidal tube) for 2 min.<BR>
4.  Proceed with in vitro fertilization as described.
<p>
<H3>Detailed procedure for UV sperm</H3>
<p>	This is a general procedure for making infertile sperm that can still activate eggs for production of haploid, early pressure (EP) or heat shock (HS) embryos.
<H4>Materials Needed:</H4><ul>

</ul><H4>Procedure:</H4>
<BR>1.	Fill the bottom of the glass Petri dish with ice. 
<BR>2.	Put watchglass on top of the ice in the dish. 
<BR>3.	Using a Pasteur pipette, transfer the sperm from the test tube onto the watchglass.  Be sure to get as much of the sperm into the pipette as possible without taking up any bubbles of air with it.  Also, do not bubble the sperm in the watchglass as you are expelling them from the pipette.  Expel sperm in a thin, even layer on watch glass.  DISCARD THIS PIPETTE.
<BR>4.	Cover the sperm with the top of the Petri dish. 
<BR>5.	Put on the Latex gloves and safety glasses. 
<BR>6.	Place the covered Petri dish under the UV lamp.
<BR>7.	Remove the cover of the Petri dish and start the stopwatch.

<H1>CHAPTER 7 - GENETIC METHODS</H1>
<H2>Production of Homozygous diploid embryos</A></H2>
<I>(Source: R. Andrews and T. Ellis)</I>
<BR>There are two basic methods for production of homozygous diploid embryos, Heat shock and Early pressure.  Both methods rely upon fertilization of embryos with <a href="7.4.html">UV inactivated sperm</a> as described above.
<p><H3><A NAME="heat_shock">Heat shock</A></H3>
<p>	The first method uses a heat shock to inhibit the first mitotic division of the embryo.  Streisinger et al. (1981) report that 10-20% of embryos treated with heat shock develop into adults.
<p><H4>	Overview of heat shock</H4>
<BR>1.	Proceed with in vitro fertilization using UV inactivated sperm as described above.
<BR>2.	At 13 min after fertilization (at 28.5C), heat shock the embryos for 2 min by transferring them to 41C water.
<BR>3.	Cool them rapidly to 28.5C.
<H4>Detailed heat shock procedures</H4>
<H5>Materials Needed:</H5>
<UL>
<LI>2 water baths, one set at 28.5&degree;C, one set at 41.4&degree;C 
<LI>		3 or 4 1-liter beakers filled with egg water 
<LI>		Distilled water 
<LI>		Egg water
<LI>		Heat shock vials 
<LI>		Electric stirrer that can be immersed 
<LI>		Thermometer 
<LI>		Timer 
<LI>		Data pad 
<LI>		Pasteur pipettes with narrow ends removed
</UL>          
	<H5>Preparation:</H5>
<BR>1.	Soak the heat shock vials over night in distilled water. 
<BR>2.	Fill water baths with distilled water.
<BR>3.	Place one 1 liter beaker in the 41C bath on a magnetic stirrer.
<BR>4.	Fill this beaker with egg water to the level of the surrounding bath water. 
<BR>5.	Place 2 or 3 1 liter beakers in the 28.5C bath and fill them with egg water to the level of the surrounding bath water.
<BR>6.	Remove the heat shock vials from the distilled water and allow them to dry on paper towels.
<BR>7.	Prepare data sheet. (see Example below) 	
<BR>8.	Place a few of the heat shock vials into one of the beakers in the 28.5C bath, beginning with the vial marked '1'.
<p><H5>	Procedure:</H5>
<BR>1.	Squeeze female fish as for Embryo Production By In Vitro Fertilization (see page 1) and activate them with UV sperm.
<BR>2.	As the 1 ml of egg water is added to begin activation, start the timer.  Mark this dish #1.  Each successive batch of eggs obtained should be marked in numerical order.
<BR>3.	Add more egg water to the fertilized eggs after about 30 seconds.
<BR>4.	About 8 minutes after fertilization, transfer embryos from their dish to the appropriately numbered heat shock vial in the 28.5C bath.  Each batch of eggs treated should be transferred to the vial marked with the same number as the number on the dish in which the eggs are fertilized.
<BR>5.	At 13 min after activation, transfer the vial containing the embryos to the 41C water bath.
<BR>6.	At 15 min after fertilization transfer the vial from the 41C bath to the 28.5C bath.
<BR>7.	Repeat this for the other batches of eggs.  This is different from EP in that you can continue squeezing females while you are waiting to transfer the embryos from one bath to the other. Because of this, you will not restart the timer for each fertilization.  For each subsequent fertilization simply record the time shown on the running timer as Time of Activation. At the time you transfer the eggs from the 28.5C bath to the hot bath add 2 minutes to that time to find the time to transfer the eggs from the hot bath back to the 28.5C bath. (Again, see Sample data sheet).
<BR>8.	Throughout the experiment you should be monitoring the temperature of the water baths, especially the 41.4C water bath.  Do this by putting the thermometer in the beakers themselves not into the surrounding water of the baths.  If the temperature is a little high you may want to add a little room temperature egg water to the beaker.  If the temperature is a little low, you can remove a little water from the beaker.  If the baths are holding steady at a temperature that is either too high or too low, you may need to adjust the temperature setting on the circulators of the baths.
<BR>9.	When you are done squeezing fish, leave the heat shock vials in the 28.5C bath until all the embryos have had time to divide at least once.  Then remove the first vial, and transfer the embryos to beakers or dishes for sorting the fertile eggs from the infertile eggs.  Record the numbers of both classes on your data sheet.  Repeat this for all the other vials in the bath.
</ul><p>
<H3><A NAME="early_pressure">Early pressure</A></H3>
<p>	The second method uses pressure to inhibit the second meiotic division of the embryo.  This method produces diploid embryos whose only genetic contribution comes from the mother.  They are not homozygous, however, due to recombination during the first meiotic division.  The frequency of appearance of any given trait in these gynogenetic diploid embryos can be used to calculate the frequency of recombination and the gene-centromere distance (Streisinger et al., 1986).  Carry out all procedures at 28.5C.
<p>	<H4>Overview of early pressure</H4>
<BR>1.	Proceed with Embryo Production By In Vitro Fertilization (see page 1) using UV inactivated sperm as described above.
<BR>2.	Immediately transfer the fertilized eggs to a glass vial (with a plastic snap cap) filled to the brim with egg water.  Cover the open end of the vial with a thin sheet of latex rubber and snap the top (into which a hole has been cut) onto the vial over the rubber.
<BR>3.	Place the vial in a hydraulic press and at 1.4 min after fertilization raise the pressure to 8,000 p.s.i.  (Note that many presses are calibrated to read the pressure exerted on a 2-inch diameter piston, and readings must be converted to p.s.i.)  
<BR>4.	Beginning at 6 min after fertilization, gradually release the pressure over a period of 1 min.
</ul><p>	<H4>Detailed early pressure procedure</H4>
<p>	<H5>Materials Needed:</H5>
		<UL>
<LI>French press 
<LI>		Pressure vials with rubber tops, and plastic lids 
<LI>		Pressure cylinders 
<LI>		Egg water 
<LI>		Pasteur pipettes with the narrow ends removed 
<LI>		Pipette bulbs
<LI>		Timer 
<LI>		UV inactivated sperm 
</UL><p><H5>
	</H5>Preparation:
<p><H6>	Procedure:</H6>
<BR>1.	Obtain eggs from the females as for Embryo Production By In Vitro Fertilization (see page 1).
<BR>2.	When eggs are obtained, activate them with UV sperm, starting the timer at the same time the 1 ml of water is added. 
<BR>3.	Allow a few seconds for activation. 
<BR>4.	Add more water, being sure to swirl the eggs to the center of the dish.
<BR>5.	Using the cut Pasteur pipette transfer the fertilized eggs to the pressure vials.   
<BR>6.	If needed, add more egg water to the vials so that they are almost overflowing, leaving a bead of water at the lip of the vials. 
<BR>7.	Place a rubber top over the bead of water and secure the plastic lid over the rubber.
<BR>8.	Place the vial(s) upside down in the pressure cylinder, adding more egg water to refill the cylinder.  Put the top on the cylinder securely. 
<BR>9.	Place the cylinder in the press with the plunger up and apply 8,000 lbs/sq. in.
<BR>10.	Steps 49 must be accomplished 1.4 min after fertilization.
<BR>11.	Leave the cylinder in the press until 6 min after the time of activation (for a total time of 4.6 min of pressure).
<BR>12.	At 6 min after activation, remove the cylinder from the press, and remove the vials from the cylinder.  Carefully dry the vials to prevent cooling of the embryos.
<BR>13.	Reset the cylinder at the #4 mark and refill it with egg water.
<BR>14.	Prepare the next vials by partially filling them with egg water as needed.
<BR>15.	Repeat for all the batches of eggs. 
<BR>NOTE:  The cylinder will take up to 3 vials at a time, so you may want to delay fertilization of eggs a few minutes to see if other females already in the tricaine give eggs.  This will help speed things up by treating more batches at one time.  Also, remember once the press is being used do not put any more fish in the tricaine until the treatment is completed. Allowing fish to stay in the anesthetic too long can kill them.   Secondly, if you squeeze fish while the press is being used, and get eggs, they may be too dry to be viable by the time the press can be used again.<BR>

<H2><A NAME="freezing sperm">Freezing Sperm</A></H2>
<I>(Source: C. Walker and G. Streisinger)</I>
<BR>Sperm may be frozen and thawed later for in vitro fertilization. This method is well suited for "backing up" genetic stocks against accidental loss or for reducing the number of tanks used to house different lines.
<BR>To Freeze sperm:
<BR>1.	Anesthetize and prepare the male as described in the section on Embryo Production By In Vitro Fertilization (see page 1).
<BR>2.	Collect sperm in a labeled micro glass capillary, being careful to exclude bubbles (i.e. use very little suction).
<BR>3.	Mix sperm thoroughly with a 5x volume of sperm freezing medium (see below or <a href="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt10.html"> RECIPES</a>, Chapter 10) being careful to avoid air bubbles.
<UL>
<LI>A simple way to do this is to mark the capillary at the end of the sperm droplet and measure the amount of sperm in mm.
<LI>Make a second mark on the capillary at 6x mm. 
<LI>Draw freezing medium into the capillary with the sperm up to the second mark.
<LI>Carefully expel most of the sperm mixture onto a clean watch glass and draw in and out 2 times to mix sperm and freezing medium. Work quickly, being careful not to introduce bubbles.
</ul><BR>4.  Draw the mixture into the capillary, transfer the capillary into a 7 ml screw cap tube, cap the tube, and put it into a 15 ml plastic conical centrifuge tube. Quickly plunge the whole works into crushed dry ice for 20 minutes. This configuration provides the proper freezing rate.
<BR>
<img align=bottom src="7-22.gif">

<BR>5.	After 20 minutes, remove the capillary from the screw cap tube and immerse in liquid nitrogen.
<BR>6.	The capillary can be stored for years open ended in a test tube on a wand in a liquid nitrogen freezer.

<BR>
<BR>1.	Obtain eggs as described in the section Embryo Production By In Vitro Fertilization (see page 1).
<BR>2.	Place a 70 &micro;l droplet of ice-cold 100% Hank's saline next to the eggs on the petri dish.
<BR>3.	Remove the capillary from the liquid nitrogen and thaw for a few seconds in air.

<H2><A NAME="fin amputations">Fin Amputations</A></H2>
<I>(Source: S. Johnson)</I>
<BR>Zebrafish fins may be amputated for a number of purposes, including screening individual fish for molecular, genetic or biochemical markers, or for studying the regeneration of the fin.  Fins regenerate within a few weeks, if amputated correctly.
	<P>
The caudal fin is the easiest to amputate.  Anesthetize the fish briefly in tricaine (Finquel MS222, see <a href="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt10.html"> RECIPES</a>, Chapter 10).  Pick up the anesthetized fish with a plastic spoon and place on the index finger of one of your hands. Slide a pair of scissors between your finger and the fin and cut.  Return the fish to fresh water.  Place the fin in the appropriate tube. 
<P>
The caudal fin will regenerate after amputation up to the level where the scales extend from the body.  For most regeneration studies, it is best to cut the fin half way between where the scales end and the tip of the fin.  If the fin is cut more anterior than the scales, regeneration is unreliable, either failing completely, or resulting in abnormally shaped regenerates.  The anal and dorsal fins are also easy to amputate, but their regeneration is less reliable than the caudal fin. The pectoral and ventral fins seem to regenerate reliably, but are more difficult to remove and to observe on swimming fish during regeneration.

<H2><A NAME="gamma ray mutagenesis">Gamma Ray Mutagenesis</A></H2>
<I>(Source: C. Walker)</I>
	<BR>Gamma rays are an effective mutagen for zebrafish embryos.  Gamma-rays are known to produce many kinds of chromosomal damage such as small deletions, large deletions, chromosome inversions and rearrangements.  We have used gamma-rays to produce mutations in three developmental stages of zebrafish: sperm, eggs, and 3 h blastulae.  In all cases, the mutagenized embryos are raised to adulthood and the germ line is screened for interesting new mutations.  The specific site mutation frequency is very similar for all three stages2,3.
<UL>
<LI>	Eggs				4 x 10-5/chromosome set/rad
<LI>	Sperm				4 x 10-5/chromosome set/rad
<LI>	Blastulae			1.2 x 10-5/chromosome set/rad
</UL>	Presently, we use gamma-rays to mutagenize at the sperm stage and at the blastula stage.
<H3>Gamma-rayed sperm</H3>
		Sperm are pooled from a number of wild-type males into Hank's solution at the same concentration used for Embryo Production By In Vitro Fertilization (see page 1).  Keeping the sperm on ice, the sperm is put into the chamber of a Gammatory-M irradiator with a cesium-137 source and given a dose of approximately 250-300 rads.  The irradiated sperm is used to fertilize wild-type eggs.  Approximately 25% of the embryos survive to adulthood.
	The advantages of gamma-irradiating sperm are:
<DIR>
<LI>The sperm does not have as much non-chromosomal material to be damaged by the gamma-rays as eggs.
<LI>The mutation is present in 25%-50% of the germ line of the mutagenized female and, therefore, can be recognized and recovered easily.
<LI>Gamma-ray sperm do not tend to produce male adults as frequently as gamma-ray embryos do.
</DIR>
<p><i>gamma-rayed 3 h blastulae</i>
<P>
Wild-type eggs are squeezed and fertilized by wild-type sperm.  The time of fertilization is noted.  At 120 min, the embryos are irradiated in a small glass vial at a dose of 250-300 rads.  Batches of eggs fertilized 4 min earlier and later can be pooled before irradiation.  Survival ranges between 25%-50%.
<P>
		A high percentage of males develop from gamma-irradiating blastulae.  The percentage is linear with the dose (250-300 rads produces about 75-80% males).  
		Blastula stage embryos contain several germ line progenitor cells, from 1 to 104, providing more chromosome sets as targets for mutagenesis.  The mutant clone size ranges from 5%-50% of the haploid germ cells.
		We have found that embryos older than 3 h are considerably more resistant to gamma-rays as a mutagen suggesting that there may be a repair mechanism at work after cleavage stages.
		It is presently unknown whether gamma-rays damage the sperm DNA in the same manner that they damage blastula DNA.

<H1>CHAPTER 7 - GENETIC METHODS</H1>
<H2>Chemical Mutagenesis</A></H2>
<I>(Source: S. Johnson, D. Grunwald, W. Driever, and M. Mullins)</I>

    <p>  Because chemical mutagens may be potent carcinogens, these agents which are used to induce mutations are potentially dangerous to the researcher using them as well as to the surrounding environment.  As a consequence, precautions must be taken to limit this risk.  We use several strategies to ensure safe use of chemical mutagens: (1) containment of the mutagen in a fumehood during the experiment, (2) inactivation of the mutagen after it is used, and (3) isolation of treated fish after mutagenesis to limit the number of workers potentially exposed to the mutagen.

<H3>Mutagens</H3>
      Currently, two chemical mutagens are used in zebrafish labs; EMS and ENU.  EMS is available as an oily liquid, which can be pipetted directly from the bottle.  Wrap the bottle with parafilm and store at 4C or -20C between experiments.  EMS is readily soluble in water, but may require vigorous shaking to get it into solution.  By contrast, ENU is a powder.  To avoid the hazards of weighing powdered mutagens, we use sealed one gram "isopacs"  (Sigma # N 3385).  Solvent is injected into the isopac with a syringe (100 ml H2O or 10 ml EtOH).  After the powder has dissolved, the required amount is drawn off in the syringe and the remainder disposed of as outlined below.
<P>
      Both EMS and ENU are alkylating agents, and can be inactivated similarly by treatment with high pH and sodium thiosulfate (10% sodium thiosulfate, 1% sodium hydroxide). The half-life of EMS in 10% sodium thiosulfate is 17 min at 37C and 1.4 hours at 20C, while the half-life of ENU in 10% sodium thiosulfate in basic solution is about 10 min at 37C.  Other means of inactivation may be required for other chemical mutagens. 
 <P>
Rules for containment and inactivation of mutagens
<BR>1.	Only handle mutagen in the fume hood. 
<BR>2.	Keep a hazardous waste bag in the fume hood. Dispose of most objects (gloves, towels, pipettes, etc.) in this bag (which might have come in contact with the mutagen). Arrange with Environmental Health and Safety for disposal of this bag following the experiment.
<BR>3.	Dedicate nondisposable equipment to mutagenesis. Keep these in the fume hood.  These include several mousecages, beakers, a 500 &#181;l pipetter, and a small dip net. These items are decontaminated (see below) after use, but left in the hood. 
<BR>4.	Cover the working surfaces of the fume hood and the floor in front of the fume hood with absorbent paper. Dispose of these papers in the hazardous waste bag after the experiment. 
<BR>5.	Wear gloves at all times and change them frequently. Specifically, change your gloves whenever you suspect contact with the mutagen or whenever you leave the fumehood.  Wash your hands (and face) periodically during the experiment. 
<BR>6.	Inactivate the mutagen following the experiment by pouring the mutagen and rinses into an equal volume of 20% sodium thiosulfate, 1% NaOH.  Make a separate inactivation bath to soak those items (beakers, mousecages, pipette tips, tubes, etc.) which came into direct contact with the mutagen.  Allow these baths to sit for 24 hr, then pour the liquid down the cup sink at the back of the hood.  
<H3>Treatment of animals during and after mutagenesis</H3>
<H4>	Embryos</H4>
1.	Mutagenize embryos either in beakers or petri dishes.
<BR>2.	Following mutagenesis, wash embryos three times, then transfer them into fresh beakers which have not been exposed to mutagen.
<BR>3.	Transfer the embryos into the nursery for normal rearing.

<H4>	Adults</H4>

1.	Mutagenize in beakers or mousecages. 
<BR>2.	Dispose of animals which die during the first 24 hr by placing them into the sodium thiosulfate inactivation bath (see rule 6, above). 
<BR>3.	Following mutagenesis, wash adults by catching them in a small dipnet and passing them briefly through two changes of clean water.
<BR>4.	Transfer mutagenized animals into fish tanks.  Label all tanks used with a prominent notice  e.g. "MUTAGEN-TREATED FISH, PLEASE DO NOT SCRUB, SIPHON, OR REMOVE DEAD FISH. PLEASE FEED NORMALLY".  Also, write your name and the date of treatment on the notice.  After the first 24 hr, dead fish can be disposed of in a normal manner. Keep a dedicated siphon and dipnet in the hood for this purpose.  After one month remove the notice and return the fish to normal care.
<BR>5.	Personally inform the workers who maintain the tanks of these changes.

<H2><A NAME="testosterone treatment to produce males">Testosterone Treatment to Produce Males</A></H2>
<I>(Source: C. Walker)</I>
	<p>Young zebrafish of mixed sexes can be treated with testosterone to yield predominantly males.  This is a useful procedure to ensure having enough males for breeding, particularly in lines which usually yield mostly females.
<H3>Source:</H3>
17-a-methyltestosterone; MW 302.5; Sigma #M-7252; final concentration = 1.7 x 10-7 M.
<H3>Stock solution:</H3>
150 mg testosterone in 50 ml Absolute Alcohol (very soluble).  Keep in -20C freezer.
<H3>Treatment solution:</H3>
Add 10 &#181;l of stock solution to 600 ml egg water slowly while stirring.  Stir ~10 min.
<H3>Procedure:</H3>
<BR>1.	Remove chorions from 24 h embryos
<BR>2.	Add ~25 embryos to 50 ml fresh testosterone solution in a 250 ml beaker; add as little water as possible (i.e. 1 drop).  Leave overnight.
<BR>3.	The next day, add 50 ml fresh testosterone solution.
<BR>4.	On each consecutive day, replace 1/2 of the testosterone solution with fresh testosterone solution.
<BR>5.	Feed embryos normally.
<BR>6.	Continue treatment until 15 days of development, moving fry from beakers to mouse cages at 9 days (see Raising Larvae in a Nursery, page 1).
<BR>7.	At 15 days, remove most of the testosterone solution and add system water.  Continue diluting during the regular daily cleaning.
<P>CAUTION:  Avoid contact with testosterone.  Rinse well if you get it on your skin.  Rinse glassware, etc. very well.
<P>NOTE:  Embryos need to be put in testosterone solution by 24 hrs.  If treated later, some will develop as females.

<H2>Agar Embedding for Cryostat Sectioning of Embryos or Larvae</H2>
(Source: R. BreMiller)
<P>
1.	Fix animals as desired.<P>

2.	Wash in fix buffer, 3 times for 5 min each wash.<P>

3.	Melt an aliquot of agar-sucrose solution (1.5% agar, 5% sucrose) and cool to 4C.<P>

4.	Transfer an animal with a drop of fix buffer to a flexible plastic well.  Remove excess fluid and add agar-sucrose to cover the animal.  Use a fine wire or toothpick to move the animal around so that it is well coated and to orient it.  Set aside until the agar has solidified (5 to 10 min).<P>

5.	Remove the block from the mold and trim with a razor blade on a hard surface according to the desired plane of sectioning. Leave at least 2-3 mm of agar around the tissue and 3-4 mm of agar below the tissue where it will be frozen to the cryostat chuck.<P>

6.	Place the trimmed agar block containing the animal into 30% sucrose and store at 4C until the block has sunk.  For 1 to 2 day old fish this may be as short as a few hours.<P>

7.	When ready to section, make a slightly raised platform by freezing a layer of OCT compound (Tissue Tek, Miles) to the cryostat chuck.  Add a drop of OCT to the platform, position the agar block and lower the whole unit slowly into a container of liquid nitrogen.  Gradual even freezing is necessary to avoid cracking the block.<P>

8.	Equilibrate the block to the cryostat temperature before sectioning.  Sections 10 to 40 &#181;m thick can be cut with this procedure.  Pick them up onto subbed slides and dry them on a 26C hot plate.<P>

<I>(Source: R. BreMiller)</I>
<P>
1.	To conserve the volume of solution needed for the staining reaction, circumscribe the sections with a ring of hydrophobic material.  A PAP pen (Research Products International Corp) is very effective for this purpose.<P>

2.	Vibratome sections may benefit from permeabilization by treating with 0.1% Triton in PBS/BSA/DMSO for 5 to 10 min.<P>

3.	Remove Triton solution if used and replace with 2% normal goat serum in PBS/BSA/DMSO for 20 min.  A pipette tip connected by tubing to an aspirator facilitates removal of solutions from the sections.<P>

4.	Replace blocking solution with primary antibody.  Treat sections overnight at 4C.  To prevent sections from drying out, place slides in large plastic petri dishes and cover the dishes with lids into which filter paper moistened with distilled water has been fitted.<P>

5.	Wash sections with PBS/BSA/DMSO 4 times for 5 min each.<P>

6.	Treat with secondary antibody diluted according to manufacturers recommendation with PBS/BSA/DMSO for 1 hr at RT.<P>

7.	Wash with PBS/BSA/DMSO as above.<P>

8.	Treat with peroxidase anti-peroxidase (PAP) diluted according to manufacturers recommendation with PBS/BSA/DMSO for 1 hr at RT.<P>

9.	Wash as above.<P>

10.	Repeat sequence with secondary antibody and PAP.  For frozen sections, the secondary antibody and PAP can be used for 2 hr each, in which case the sequence is not repeated. <P>

11.	Wash with 0.1 M PO4 buffer, pH 7.3, several changes. <P>

12.	Stain with DAB pre-soak solution for 5 min.  Plastic "mailers" make good disposable staining containers for five slides and hold 12 to 15 ml of solution.<P>

13.	Pour off the DAB solution.  Add to it 3% H2O2 in an appropriate volume to give a final concentration of 0.004% and return the solution to the staining containers.  Incubate, using a shaker if possible, until sections show color.  In most cases a staining time of 5 to 15 min is adequate.  Stop reaction by washing first in 0.1 M PO4, then in dH2O.<P>

NOTE:  The color of the end product of the DAB reaction may be altered by adding a heavy metal such as nickel or cobalt to the staining solution. Replace PO4 buffer with 0.1 M Tris buffer, pH 7.4.<P>

14.	Dehydrate sections through an alcohol series (50%, 70%, 95% twice, absolute alcohol twice, 3 min each).  Clear in xylene twice, 5 min each, and mount in Permount.

12.	Treat with PAP diluted with PBS/BSA/DMSO for 5 hr at RT or overnight at 4C.<P>

13.	Wash for a minimum of 60 min in several changes of 1% DMSO in 0.1 M PO4 buffer.<P>

14.	To stain for HRP, presoak tissue in DAB solution for 15 min.  Add H2O2.  Development of color can be monitored under a dissecting scope.  Reaction time is usually in the range of 5 to 15 min.  Stop the reaction by adding 0.1M PO4 buffer.  Wash in dH2O with several changes.<P>

15.	Dehydrate tissue through an alcohol series (50%, 70%, 85%, 95%, and twice in absolute EtOH, 5 min each) and clear in methyl salicylate.<P>

16.Mount tissue in Permount between two coverslips, using strips of teflon tape or pieces of glass to serve as spacers.  The tissue may also be stored in methyl salicylate and viewed using depression slides.<P>

17.	Instead of mounting in Permount the whole-mounts may be embedded in either epon or epon/araldite resin and sectioned:
<DIR>
<LI>Transfer tissue to fresh methyl salicylate for 10 min
<LI>Change to 1:1 methyl salicylate:resin overnight at RT
<LI>Two changes of fresh resin 2 hr each
<LI>Embed in fresh resin
<LI>Polymerize at 60C overnight
<LI>Cut 5 to 10 um sections with a glass knife
<LI>Dry down on a drop of dH2O
<li>Coverslip in Permount
</DIR>
NOTES:  To avoid tedious transfer of individual fish, use holders devised by cutting the end off BEEM capsules (used for embedding tissue for EM).  Cover the bottom with a circle of mesh cut from dacron or silk organza and tie in place with dental floss.  <P>

<img align=bottom src="8-7.gif">
<B>Holders for fixed embryos</B><P>

Plastic microwells (0.5 ml volume) can be used to hold solutions.  Add fresh solutions by pipetting them on top of the tissue. When transfer-ring holders from one well to the next, drain mesh bottom briefly on Kimwipes.  Small plastic petri dishes or Stender dishes can also be used, in which case several holders can be processed at the same time.  
<P>
The stained embryos can be transferred to glass spot dishes for dehydration, removing the yolk if desired while transferring through alcohols. It is also possible to leave the tissue in the BEEM capsule holders while dehydrating.
<P>
A certain amount of flexibility in the staining schedule is possible. Thorough washing seems to be the most important factor in reducing background and should not be minimized.
<P>
Staining of 30 h fish or older is improved by adding Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.1% to 0.5% to all solutions.

<H2>Photoconversion of Fluorescently Labeled Profiles for EM</H2>
<I>(Source: S. Wilson)</I>
<P>
<H3>Labeling cells with DiI</H3>
1.	Fix embryo for 2-4 hr in 0.1 M Pipes (disodium salt) buffer, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSO4 and 3.5% paraformaldehyde (or formalin). Adjust pH to 6.95 with concentrated HCl.  To this solution add a few drops of glutaraldehyde to give a final concentration of about 0.1% (this last step can be omitted if the preparation is not destined for EM).<P>

2.	Wash in 0.1 M PO4 buffer (pH 7.4) and dissect as much as possible to expose the cells that you want to label.<P>

3.	Dissolve diI in dimethyl formamide (DMF) or some other organic solvent and allow to dry on glass.<P>

4.	Using a sharp tungsten needle, pick up some of the diI crystals (they stick easily to the needle).  Put this needle into the bathing solution close to the embryo and using a second needle, pick off a crystal.  The diI is neutrally buoyant and will float in the buffer. Using the second needle, move the crystal onto the cell(s) of interest and leave it in place for several minutes.<P>

5.	Remove the crystal carefully.
	
6.	Allow the diI to label the cells. The time will depend upon the duration of fixation and the distance that the diI has to diffuse.
<H3>DAB photoconversion</H3>

1.	Make a slide with a well that can hold the embryo and can be coverslipped, for example, a 64 x 48 mm coverslip onto which two pillars of two or three 22x22 mm cover slips have been glued to form a well which sits between the columns.<P>

2.	Put the embryo and a drop of DAB (30 mg in 50 ml of PO4) into the well and place a coverslip on top.  This cover slip is held by surface tension and the whole slide can be turned upside down without spilling DAB to allow viewing of the embryo from either side.  Moving the top coverslip gently allows the tissue to be rotated.<P>

3.	Illuminate the labeled cells in the DAB solution with a compound microscope using the normal filters for exciting and viewing diI.  The fluorescence fades after a few minutes and a brown reaction product appears.  As soon as this happens, remove the specimen by adding a drop of buffer to one side of the well, wash it well, and fix it in 3% glutaraldehyde (buffered to pH 7.2) for 2-3 hr.  Do not photoconvert the profiles too long as this leads to spreading of the reaction product beyond the labeled cell and gives poor EM.  The reaction product also intensifies when it is osmicated so even if you can barely see the profiles with the light microscope, you should have no problem finding them with EM.<P>

	This photoconversion is the make or break step.  Two problems tend to arise:
<DIR>
a) Nothing photoconverts.  Try the following.  Label the cells as brightly as possible, make sure no extra filters are in the light path, use a strong fluorescence light source and use as high a magnification (and numerical aperture) as possible.  Allow a longer transport time so that the profiles get as bright as possible. Try using fresh DAB and increasing the concentration to 50 mg/50 ml.  Increase the time allowed for photoconversion.  You also want your tissue to be as superficial as possible; removing skin and muscle etc. helps.<P>

	 	b) Everything photoconverts and the background is high.  Make sure that the DAB is freshly dissolved (or at least not too old). DAB frozen as a concentrated solution eventually seems to lose its potency.  Try lowering the concentration of DAB.  Try lowering background fluorescence by keeping the application site out of the field of view, and removing the condenser lens (which reflects epi-fluorescence).<P>
</DIR>
7.	Photograph and draw the preparation.<P>

8.	Osmicate (1%) for one hr, then use a standard EM protocol to get the preparation into plastic.  Under a good stereomicroscope you will be able to see the photoconverted cells in the embryo even after it has been embedded in plastic.  This helps considerably when you try to find the profiles during sectioning.

<H1>CHAPTER 8 - HISTOLOGICAL METHODS</H1>
<H2>Gentle Fixation by Freeze Substitution</H2> 
<I>(Source: K. Griffin)</I>
<P>
Freeze substitution is a previously described technique for the gentle fixation and dehydration of tissue.  I originally employed it solely because it was reputed to result in minimal loss of antigenicity and had been used by other groups with similar research interests (Shiurba et al, 1991; Michael et al, 1984). However, I wish to draw it to the attention of other zebrafish workers because it gives such excellent histological results with zebrafish embryos which are far superior to other methods, such as paraformaldehyde fixation.
<P>
The main features of the technique are as follows.  By freezing the tissue at a temperature well below the eutectic point (-85C; the minimum temperature at which ice crystallization occurs), rapid and uniform ice formation occurs and tissue damage due to crystal formation is eliminated, so long as the tissue sample is small and the cryogen volume is large.  The cryogen recommended here, isopentane, has high specific heat and thermal conductivity, so that heat from the sample is conducted away fast and does not adversely affect the temperature of the cryogen.  After freezing, the tissue is transferred to methanol kept cold on dry ice.  The methanol slowly dissolves (substitutes) the ice from the tissue, but has very little fixative activity because fixation is indirectly proportional to the ambient temperature.
<P>
Freeze substitution is, therefore, a convenient method for generating high quality histological material without the use of cross-linking fixatives and with only minimal denaturation.  Since it is compatible with the use of wax sectioning, it is also more convenient than cryo-fixation.  It might also be the method of choice for the dehydration and embedding of previously fixed embryos, e.g. sectioning of whole-mounts or prior to sectioning for in situ hybridization or immunostaining.

<H3>Method</H3>

1.  Place 100 ml of isopentane in a small Duran bottle into an ice box or wide-mouthed thermos filled with dry ice.  When the temperature is equilibrated (1-2 hours), pour ~200 mls of liquid nitrogen directly over the bottle.  It is best to monitor the temperature of the isopentane with a thermo-couple, but a rule of thumb is to wait 10-15 min after pouring the nitrogen before freezing the tissue. It is a good idea to swirl the isopentane periodically to equalize the temperature. In a separate ice bucket, place as many 5-10 ml labeled vials of methanol as required on dry ice.  (Screw-top scintillation vials are ideal; flip-top lids are very difficult to remove when cold.)
<P>
2.  Pipette embryos (in their chorions) on to one end of a 5x1 cm piece of nylon gauze (or other suitable material).  Dab off excess water through the underside of the gauze; the embryos will adhere quite strongly to the gauze through surface tension.  Embryos can also be dechorionated and embedded in agarose (e.g. 0.8% low-melting point agarose for support; excess agarose should be trimmed with a scalpel prior to freezing.
<P>
3.  Hold the gauze by the other end with forceps and plunge the embryos into the center of the isopentane for 1 min.
<P>
4.  Transfer the embryos (now securely frozen onto the gauze) to the methanol.  Store at -70C (at least), preferably colder, for 5 days or longer.  
<P>
At -70C ice crystals will be able to form, but this does not seem to be a problem here, perhaps because zebrafish embryos dehydrate sufficiently before crystals form.  However, should material of higher quality be required, e.g. for EM work, then it is recommended to use 15% propylene glycol as a cryoprotect-ant during the freezing, and to freeze substitute in ethanol at -100C throughout. This is a slightly more complicated procedure but does not require expensive equipment; the temperature is attained using a slurry of dry ice and nitrogen kept in a thermos in the freezer with periodic monitoring and addition of more dry ice and nitrogen as required.  Consult Campbell et al (1991) for a description of the technique.
<P>
5.  When required, slowly warm the tissue by transferring it to -20C (freezer) for 2-3 hrs, the fridge for 2-3 hrs, and to room temperature for 2-3 hrs.
<P>
6.  The embryos are ready for embedding.  Polyester wax (BDH) is a good choice because this is molten at 37C and is gentler on the tissue.  It is also soluble in methanol or ethanol, avoiding the need for additional organic reagents. This wax can conveniently be cut in a cool room (20C).
<P>
A drawback of this method seems to be the short shelf life of the tissue. Tissue stored in the fridge for 2 months develops a considerable increase in non-specific nuclear staining (looks similar to toluidine blue counterstaining) and a decrease in signal.  However, the results are sufficiently good to offset this minor complaint.

<br>
1.        Remove embryos from their chorions by immersing them in 1 mg/ml
          pronase for 5 min, RT, in a petri dish.  Embryos younger than 24 h
          require shorter exposure to pronase (see 
	<a href="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt4/4.1.html">Removing 	Embryos from their Chorions</A>, Chapter 4).<br>
<br>
2.        Transfer them to a clean beaker filled with 10% Hank's saline and rinse
          several times with clean 10% Hanks.<br>
<br>
3.        Triturate gently with a pasteur pipette to expel the embryos from their
          chorions, if necessary.<br>
<br>
4.        Transfer embryos into microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 ml Eppendorf).  Remove
          as much water as possible with a pipette.<br>
<br>
5.        Add cold SDS sample buffer (63 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol,
          5% &szlig;-mercaptoethanol, 3.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate; see  below or <A
          HREF="/zf_info/zfbook/chapt10.html">RECIPES</A>, Chapter 10) at 1 &#181;l per fish.<br>
<br>
6.        Homogenize with pestle.  Add another 1 &#181;l of SDS sample buffer
          per fish to rinse pestle, homogenize a bit more.<BR>
<br>
7.        Immerse tube in boiling water for 1 min.<br>
<br>
8.        Spin in a microcentrifuge for 5 min.  Collect supernatant and apply to gel. 
          Alternatively, samples can be frozen at this point (-70&#176;C) for later
          analysis.

          1.                   Remove embryos from their chorions in
                                           batches of ~100 by placing in 1 mg/ml of
                                           pronase and swirling occasionally (5-10
                                           minutes for 24 h embryos, 10-20 minutes
                                           for 3 day embryos).  Finish dechorionation
                                           by gentle trituration using a Pasteur pipette. 
                                           The chorions float and can be decanted. 
                                           Rinse three times in cold Ringer's
                                           solution.  (See also <B>Removing Embryos
          from their Chorions</B>, Chapter 4).<br>
<br>
          2.                   Transfer the embryos to cold Ringer's with
                                           EDTA and PMSF.  Remove yolks by
                                           triturating with a glass pipette that has been
                                           drawn out to have a tip diameter approxi-
                                           mately the size of the
                                           yolk.<br>
<br>
          3.                   Transfer the dechorionated, deyolked em-
                                           bryos to fresh, cold Ringer's solution and
                                           rinse twice.<br>
<br>
          4.                   Embryos can be frozen in liquid nitrogen
                                           and stored at -70&#176;C at this point by
                                           transferring to a microcentrifuge tube and
                                           removing as much liquid as
                                           possible.<br>

          7.                   Immerse membrane in color development
                                           solution.  Proteins present at 100 ng or
                                           greater will immediately become visible as
                                           purple bands.  Lower amounts will take
                                           longer, but should be visible within 30 min. 
                                           Staining can continue up to 4
                                           hr.<br>
<br>
          8.                   Rinse membrane four times for 5 min each
                                           in dH<em sub>2</em>O.

<br>
<H3><B><I>Large sample number, very quick and dirty, adequate for
PCR</B></I></H3><br>
<br>
          This protocol is most suitable for samples consisting of 1-20, diploid, 2-3
day old embryos.  Embryos need not be removed from their chorions.  DNA
prepared with this procedure is only good for PCR analysis, but is unsuitable for
digests and Southern blots.  Because PCR does not require high-molecular-weight
DNA, samples can be vortexed and frozen.<br>
<br>
          1.                   Transfer embryo(s) into microfuge tube and
                                           remove excess liquid with drawn-out Pasteur
                                           pipette.<br>
<br>
          2.                   Add extraction buffer, 50 &#181;l or 10 &#181;l per
                                           embryo whichever is larger, and incubate at
                                           50-56&#176;C for 2-3 hrs (longer is ok).  Vortex
                                           occasionally.  <br>
<br>
<br>
          <I><B>PCR Extraction buffer</B></I><br>
<br>
10 mM Tris pH 8<BR>
2 mM EDTA<BR>
0.2% Triton X-100<BR>
200 &#181;g/ml Proteinase K<br>
<br>
<br>
          3.                   Boil samples in waterbath for 5-10 min to
                                           inactivate Proteinase
                                           K.<br>
<br>
          4.                   Spin in microfuge for 1 min, store at -
                                           20&#176;C.<br>
<br>
          5.                   Use 10-15 &#181;l to set up PCR reaction in a
                                           total volume of 50 &#181;l, proceed with your
                                           favorite PCR
                                           protocol.<br>
<br>
<H3><I><B>Large sample number, still quick but less dirty</B></I></H3>
<br>
          This protocol produces cleaner preparations and probably somewhat higher
yields per embryo.  DNA prepared with this method from single haploid embryos
is satisfactory for multiple-primer (multiplex) PCR reactions.  The protocol is
provided for the preparation of DNA from single haploid embryos, but, of
course, can be adapted for more embryos.<br>
<br>
          1.                   Remove the embryo from the chorion. 
                                           Sperm tends to stick to the chorion, and
                                           sperm DNA can be amplified in a PCR
                                           reaction; it is therefore essential to remove
                                           the chorion, especially if you expect the
                                           genotype of the haploid embryo to differ
                                           (i.e. mutant) from that of the UV-treated
                                           sperm (usually wild
                                           type).<br>
<br>
          2.                   Transfer embryo into microfuge tube,
                                           remove liquid with Pasteur pipette, rinse by
                                           adding some dH<em sub>2</em>O, and
                                           remove as much liquid as possible with
                                           drawn-out Pasteur pipette. 
                                           <br>
 <br>
          3.                   Add 50 &#181;l extraction buffer and incubate at
                                           50&#176;C for about 3 hr.  Mix occasionally. 
                                           <br>
<br>
          <B><I>DNA Extraction buffer</B></I><br>

<br>
<br>
          4.                   Add 100 &#181;l EtOH, mix, and place on ice for
                                           20-30 min.  <br>
<br>
          5.                   Centrifuge in microfuge for 10 min, remove
                                           supernatant and add 200 &#181;l 70% EtOH. 
                                           Spin again for 2 min, remove liquid and dry
                                           pellet.<br>
<br>
          6.                   Resuspend the DNA in 20 &#181;l TE, store at -
                                           20&#176;C.<br>
<br>
          7.                   Proceed with PCR reaction.  Usually 1/4 to
                                           1/2 (5-10 &#181;l) of the DNA preparation from
                                           one embryo is
                                           sufficient.<br>

<br>
          This protocol is essentially that of Sambrook et al. (i.e. Maniatis),
described on page 9.16 ff, of Vol. 2.  References, modifications, and alternatives
can be found there.  Genomic DNA prepared by this method can be used for all
purposes, including construction of libraries.  Care should be taken to carry out
all mixing and resuspension steps gently; do not vortex.  Store DNA at 4&#176;C, do
not freeze.<br>
<br>
          1.                   Place embryos, tissue or adult fish into
                                           suitable container, remove all liquid and
                                           quick-freeze in liquid nitrogen.  If desired,
                                           specimen can be stored at -
                                           80&#176;C.<br>
<br>
          2.                   Prepare extraction buffer.  About 10 ml per
                                           1 g of material or 10 volumes per volume of
                                           ground fish (see 3, below) is appropriate. 
                                           Have extraction buffer ready in 50 ml
                                           plastic tube or a small
                                           beaker.<br>
<br>
<br>
          <B><I>Genomic DNA extraction buffer</I></B><br>
<br>
10 mM Tris pH 8<br>
100 mM EDTA pH 8<br>
0.5% SDS<br>
200 &#181;g/ml Proteinase K<br>
<br>
<br>
          3.                   Grind material into a powder using a high
                                           speed blender or mortar and pestle, keeping
                                           it frozen in liquid nitrogen.  When finished,
                                           allow the liquid nitrogen to
                                           evaporate.<br>
<br>
          4.                   Slowly add powder to extraction buffer,
                                           allowing it to spread and wet on the surface
                                           of the buffer.  Then shake to submerge
                                           material.<br>
<br>
          5.                   Incubate at 50&#176;C for at least 3 hr (up to
                                           overnight) with occasional gentle
                                           swirling.<br>
<br>
          6.                   Cool solution to room temperature and
                                           extract two times with one volume of
                                           equilibrated phenol.  MIX GENTLY until
                                           an emulsion has formed; separate phases by
                                           centrifugation at 3000-5000xg for 10 min. 
                                           Remove aqueous phase carefully using a
                                           wide-bore pipette.<br>
<br>
          7.                   Extract a third time with
                                           phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol
                                           (25:24:1), centrifuge, then transfer aqueous
                                           phase into fresh tube and add NaCl to a
                                           final concentration of 200 mM.  Overlay
                                           with 2 volumes of ethanol by slowly letting
                                           it run down the side of the tube.  Swirl the
                                           tube gently until the solution is thoroughly
                                           mixed.  The DNA will precipitate
                                           immediately and should be easily
                                           visible.<br>
<br>
          8.                   Over a Bunsen burner, seal the end of a
                                           Pasteur pipette and melt it into a U-shape. 
                                           Remove the precipitated DNA using the
                                           Pasteur pipette and transfer it into a tube
                                           containing 70% ethanol.  Let DNA stand in
                                           70% ethanol for about 5 min and gently
                                           move it around from time to time using the
                                           Pasteur pipette.<br>
<br>
          9.                   Remove the DNA from the 70% ethanol
                                           with the Pasteur pipette, let excess liquid
                                           drip off, and place the Pasteur pipette with
 DNA sticking to it inverted into a microfuge rack.  Let the DNA air dry for 5
min. <br>
<br>
<B>NOTE:</B>                         If the DNA precipitate becomes fragmented in the 70%
                                     ethanol solution and fails to stick to the pipette,
                                     centrifuge the tube for 5 min at 5000xg to pellet the
                                     DNA.  Then remove as much ethanol as possible.  Let
                                     the DNA air dry until the last visible traces of ethanol
                                     have evaporated.<br>
<br>
          10.                  Resuspend the DNA in an appropriate
                                           volume (5-10 ml per gram of starting
                                           material) of 10 mM Tris pH 8, 5 mM
                                           EDTA and 100 &#181;g/ml (DNAse free) RNAse
                                           A.  Genomic DNA is hard to resuspend, this
                                           may take several hours.  Place DNA
                                           solution at 37&#176;C and gently mix and swirl
                                           from time to time.<br>
<br>
          11.                  Extract the DNA solution once with
                                           phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (as
                                           above) and transfer aqueous phase to fresh
                                           tube.<br>
<br>
          12.                  Add 0.1 volume of 7.5 M ammonium
                                           chloride and overlay with two volumes of
                                           ethanol.  Precipitate DNA by slowly
                                           inverting tube until solution is thoroughly
                                           mixed.  Repeat steps 8 and 9.  Rinse twice
                                           in 70% ethanol.<br>
<br>
          13.                  Resuspend DNA in TE, usually 1-2 ml per
                                           g of starting material is good.  Resuspending
                                           can be facilitated by warming the DNA
                                           solution to 50&#176;C.<br>
<br>
          14.                  Determine the concentration by measuring
                                           OD at 260 nm in a spectrophotometer. 1 OD
                                           unit is 50 &#181;g/ml.

<H2>Rapid Isolation of RNA from Zebrafish</H2>
                                              (Source: M. Westerfield)<br>
<br>
          This is a modification of the method of Chirgwin et al. (<I>Biochem</I>.
<B>18</B>:5294-5299, 1979) which can be used to obtain RNA from zebrafish embryos or
adults for northern analysis, etc.<BR>
<br>
1.        Homogenize embryos (or adults frozen in liquid N<em sub>2</em>) in
          GHCl buffer with 0.5% diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) added.  Use 0.5 ml
          GHCl buffer per 100 embryos, or 2 ml per adult.
<br>
<br>
          <B><I>GHCl buffer</B>:</I><br>
<br>
7.5 M guanidinium hydrochloride<br>
0.025 M NaOAc pH 7.0<br>
5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5% N-laurylsarcosinate.<br>
<br>

2.        Extract once with an equal volume of phenol-chloroform.<br>
<br>
3.        Transfer the aqueous (upper) phase into a new tube and precipitate the
          RNA by adding 2 &#181;l of 1 M acetic acid and 50 &#181;l ethanol for
          each 100 &#181;l of GHCl solution.  Incubate at -20&#176;C for at least
          3 hr.<br>
<br>
4.        Pellet the RNA by centrifugation for 5 min, 10k.<br>
<br>
5.        Remove the supernatant as completely as possible and redissolve the pellet
          in half the original volume (but minimally 50 &#181;l) GHCl buffer
          (without DEPC).<br>
<br>
6.        Reprecipitate the RNA as in step 3.<br>
<br>
7.        Wash (and store) the RNA pellet in 100% ethanol.  For northern analysis
          the RNA is best dissolved directly in northern sample buffer.

<H2>Extraction and Purification of RNA from Zebrafish Embryos</H2>
                                                (Source: A. Molven)<br>
<br>
1.        Homogenize 3 ml of zebrafish embryos (approximately 3000 embryos) in
          20 ml of GIT buffer.  Use an automatic tissue homogenizer (e.g. Dounce)
          and homogenize until all the embryos are totally disrupted (2-3
          min).<br>
<br>
          <B><I>GIT buffer</B>:</I><br>
<br>
4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate<br>
0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5<br>
1% &szlig;-mercaptoethanol.<br>
<br>
2.        Add N-laurylsarcosinate to 0.5% and mix.  Transfer the homogenate to
          two 15 ml Corex tubes, centrifuge 5k, 5 min (HB4 rotor) to sediment
          chorions and cell debris.<br>
<br>
3.        In ultracentrifuge tubes, layer 0.3 ml of GIT buffer onto a pad of 3.3 ml,
          5.7 M CsCl in 50 mM EDTA, pH 8.0.  On top, carefully layer 7.1 ml of
          the homogenate.<br>
<br>
4.        Centrifuge in a swinging bucket rotor (e.g. SW-41) for 20 hr, 30k,
          20&#176;C.<br>
<br>
5.        Carefully remove the supernatant without introducing any exogenous
          RNase contamination.  The RNA should now be visible as a glassy
          pellet.<br>
<br>
6.        Dissolve the pellet in 0.5 ml TES buffer (1% SDS 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM
          Tris-HCl pH 7.4) and transfer to a nuclease-free 15 ml Corex tube.<br>
<br>
7.        Heat to 65&#176;C to ensure dissolution of the pellet.  Washing the
          bottom of the ultracentrifuge tube with another 0.5 ml TES buffer will
          enhance the recovery of RNA.<BR>
<br>
8.        Determine the concentration of RNA and precipitate by adding 0.1 volume
          of 2 M sodium acetate, pH 7, and 2.5 volumes of ethanol.<br>
<br>
9.        Store the RNA at -20&#176;C.

<H1>CHAPTER 7 - GENETIC METHODS</H1>
<H2>Preparation of High Quality RNA from Zebrafish Embryos</H2>
(Source: S. Schulte-Merker and C. N&uuml;sslein-Volhard)<br>
<br>
          This procedure, which is adapted from Brown and Kafatos (<I>J. Mol.
Biol</I>. <B>203</B>:425-437), produces high yields and is fast (from
embryo to EtOH in less than 2.5 hours).  Also, it works well for all stages and
tissues and yields high quality RNA.  One drawback is the danger of working
with hot phenol; use extreme care to assure that the nitrogen has boiled off
completely.<BR>
<br>
          1.                   Cool a mortar on dry ice; use liquid
                                           nitrogen to cool other equip-
                                           ment.<br>
<br>
          2.                   Pour embryos (100 or more) into a small
                                           sieve and "dry" them by holding a paper
                                           towel against the sieve (or towel dry adult). 
                                           Transfer the embryos (or adult) to the
                                           mortar containing liquid
                                           nitrogen.<br>
<br>
          3.                   Homogenize the embryos (or the adult)
                                           carefully with a precooled pestle while there
                                           is still nitrogen present. This is best done by
                                           pounding, not grinding, with the pestle. 
                                           When the liquid nitrogen is gone, grind
                                           everything up to a fine
                                           powder.<br>
<br>
          4.                   Transfer the powder to a Falcon tube (50ml)
                                           containing liquid nitrogen.  Use a precooled
                                           spatula to transfer the powder as
                                           quantitatively as
                                           possible.<br>
<br>
          5.                   The powder can be stored at -70&#176;C for a couple of days. 
                                           Make sure that the powder never thaws
                                           before proceeding to step
                                           5.<br>
<br>
          6.                   Heat a 1:1 mixture of unbuffered phenol
                                           (pH 4-5) and 2xNETS (200 mM NaCl, 2
                                           mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1% SDS)
                                           to 95&#176;C (at this
                                           temperature, the mixture forms only a single
                                           phase).  <I><B>Beware:
                                           wear goggles, gloves,
                                           etc.</I></B><br>
<br>
          7.                   Take the Falcon tubes from step 4/5 and let
                                           the liquid nitrogen boil away <em
                                           u><B>completely</B></em>.</bl
                                           ockquote><br>
<br>
          8.                   Make sure the opening of the tube points
                                           away from you.  Immediately add about 10
                                           ml of the 95&#176;C hot
                                           phenol/NETS mixture to the
                                           powder.<br>
<br>
          9.                   Close the tube and vortex immediately for 1
                                           minute.  The RNA is safe now, and you can
                                           do as many samples as you
                                           wish.<br>
<br>
          10.                  After the samples have cooled, centrifuge
                                           for 20 minutes at 5,000
                                           rpm.<br>
<br>
          11.                  Remove the supernatant and re-extract the
                                           organic phase with 1 vol of 2xNETS. 
                                           <br>
<br>
          12.                  Combine the two aqueous phases and extract
                                           them once more with unbuffered
                                           phenol.<br>
<br>
          13.                  Centrifuge and extract the aqueous phase
                                           twice with phenol:chloroform and once with
                                           chloroform.  <br>
<br>
          14.                  Precipitate the RNA by adding 0.1 vol 3 M
 NaAC and 2.5 vol EtOH.  Highest yields are obtained by leaving the samples
for a couple of days at -20&#176;C.<br>
<br>
          15.                  After centrifugation, wash the RNA with
                                           70% EtOH and dissolve in DEPC-treated
                                           water.  Typical yields are around 1 &#181;g
                                           RNA per embryo.<br>
<br>
          This method can be scaled down if RNA from only a few embryos is
required.  In this case, collect embryos in an Eppendorf tube.  Remove as much
water as possible and put the tubes into liquid nitrogen.  With a precooled device,
grind the embryos to a fine powder.  Afterwards, follow steps 4-15 and scale
down the required volumes accordingly.

<br>
          1.                   Fix embryos with 4% paraformaldehyde in
                                           PBS overnight at 4&#176;C.<br>
<br>
          2.                   Wash twice in PBS, 5 min each, at
                                           RT.<br>
<br>
          3.                   Remove the embryos from their chorions
                                           using watchmaker forceps (easiest at this
                                           point).<br>
<br>
          4.                   Transfer embryos to vials with 100%
                                           methanol (MeOH), replace with fresh
                                           methanol after 5 min.  Use MeOH and not
                                           ethanol, since ethanol causes a higher
                                           background!<br>
<br>
<B>Note:</B>                    From this point on, the embryos remain in the same glass
                                vial until they are ready for prehybridization.<br>
<br>
          5.                   Cool
                                           the embryos to -20&#176;C for
                                           at least 30 min
                                           (embryos can be
                                           stored that way for
                                           months; this step is
                                           necessary for
                                           permeabilization of
                                           embryos even if you
                                           don't want to store
                                           them).<BR>
<br>
          6.                   Bring the embryos back to
                                           RT.<br>
<br>
          7.                   Imme
                                           rse 5 min in 50%
                                           MeOH in PBST and
                                           then 5 min in 30%
                                           MeOH in
                                           PBST.<BR>
<br>
          8.                   Rinse twice in PBST for 5 min
                                           each.<br>
<br>
<B>Note:</B>                    Embryos can also be removed from their chorions at this
                                point, but chorions are sticky after having been in
                                MeOH<br>
<br>
          9.                   Fix for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in
                                           PBS at RT.<br>
<br>
          10.                  Rinse
                                           twice in PBST for 5
                                           min
                                           each.
                                           
<br>
<br><B><I>Proteinase digestion and postfixation</B></I><br>
<br>
          1.                   Digest with proteinase K (10 &#181;g/ml in
                                           PBST) at RT for 5 to 12 min (depends on
                                           the stage; younger stages are more sensitive;
                                           depends, also, on the batch of enzyme; we
                                           test each new batch).<br>
<br>
          2.                   Rinse briefly in PBST; wash for 5 min in
                                           PBST.<br>
<br>
          3.                   Fix as above (4% paraformaldehyde in PBS,
                                           20 min).<br>
<br>
          4.                   Wash
                                           as above (2 times in
                                           PBST).</blockquote>
<br>
<B><I>Acetic anhydride treatment (optional)</I></B><br>
<br>
          1.                   Replace PBST with dH<em sub>2</em>O (as
                                           quantitatively as
                                           possible).<br>
<br>
          2.                   As quickly as possible, replace H<em
                                           sub>2</em>O with a fresh mixture of 2.5
                                           &#181;l acetic anhydride in 1 ml of 0.1M
                                           triethanolamine (pH
                                           7.0).<br>
<br>
          3.                   Incubate for 10-60 min at
                                           RT.<BR>
<br>
          4.                   Wash 2 times for 10 min each in
                                           PBST.<br>
<br>
          This treatment helps reduce background from endogenous phosphatases
 and is therefore only necessary in cases where background is a problem.  It is
also unnecessary if peroxidase-coupled anti-digoxigenin antibodies are used.<br>
<br>
<B><I>Prehybridization</I></B><br>
<br>
          1.                   Transfer embryos (up to 40) into small
                                           eppendorf tubes (0.8ml) in approximately
                                           300 &#181;l of HYB*.<br>
<br>
          2.                   Incubate 5 min at 55&#176;C;
                                           afterwards, replace HYB*
                                           with an equal volume of HYB+.<br>
<br>
          3.                   Prehybridize at 55&#176;C for
                                           1-48 hr in HYB+.<br>
<br>
<B><I>Probes</I></B><br>
<br>
          Prepare RNA Probes according to the Boehringer instructions (Cat.
#1175025).  About 5 to 10 &#181;g of digoxigenin-labeled probe is transcribed
from 1 &#181;g of a linearized plasmid.  Hydrolyze the probes to an average
length of 150-300 nucleotides following the protocol of Cox <I>et al</I>.
(1984; <I>Devel. Biol.</I> <B>101</B>:485-502).  After the final
precipitation, the hydrolyzed probe should be taken up directly in HYB+ and
stored at 20&#176;C.<br>
<br>
<B><I>Hybridization</I></B><br>
<br>
          1.                   Remove as much of the preHYB+ as possible without letting the embryos touch air.<br>
<br>
          2.                   Add 20 to 40 &#181;l of fresh HYB+ containing 20-100 ng of RNA
                                           probe (about 0.5-5.0 ng/&#181;l) so that all
                                           embryos are covered by the solution.  Heat
                                           the probe in HYB+ for 5
                                           min at 68&#176;C before
                                           adding to the embryos.  For some probes,
                                           signal intensity decreases below 10 ng;
                                           amounts higher than 100 ng don't usually
                                           give a higher signal intensity.  Probably the
                                           amount of probe to add depends upon the
                                           amount of RNA you want to detect and has
                                           to be titrated.<br>
<br>
          3.                   Incubate overnight at 55&#176;C.<br>
<br>
<B><I>Probe removal</I></B><br>
<br>
          Remove probe (probes can be reused twice; using them more often results
in weaker signals.  The probes in HYB+ are stable for at least
half a year).<br>

<br>
<B>IMPORTANT:</B>  For some probes, the RNAse treatment is
unnecessary and decreases the signal intensity.  For other probes, omitting the
RNAse leads to an unacceptably high background.  It is therefore advisable to test
whether the RNAse treatment is necessary for any given probe.  If you can do
without it, follow Option B; if not, use Option A.<br>

                                           overnight.<br>
<br>
          7.                   Wash in PBS.<br>
<br>
          8.                   Dehydrate with 100% MeOH twice (10 min
                                           each) and mount in a 2:1 mixture of
                                           benzylbenzoate:benzylalcohol.  This mixture
                                           has the same refractive index as yolk and
                                           clears the embryos very
                                           well.<br>
<br>
          If one uses alkaline phosphatase as a detection enzyme one has to be aware
that NBT/X-Phosphate will fade in anhydrous solutions.  Fixing the embryos after
the color reaction is necessary if you want to clear the embryos in alcohol.  After
 fixation (4% paraformaldehyde at RT for at least half an hour) even weaker
signals are reasonably stable in alcohol.  You can also overstain with careful
monitoring of the dehydration and clearing process.  Another alternative is to
photograph weak signals immediately after transferring the specimen to alcohol
or to clear them in glycerol.<br>

<br>
          1.                   Use embryos in which alkaline phosphatase
                                           has been employed as a detection enzyme. 
                                           For the best results it is important to
                                           overstain heavily the whole-mount
                                           preparation.<br>
<br>
          2.                   Postfix embryos in 4% paraformaldehyde in
                                           PBS.  The tissue can be stored in this
                                           solution for an extended period of time in
                                           the dark at 4&#176;C.<br>
<br>
          3.                   Wash embryos in dH<em sub>2</em>O and
                                           dehydrate quickly through a graded series of
                                           methanol (50%, 70%, 95% and twice 100%
                                           2 to 3 min each).<br>
<br>
          4.                   Replace the methanol with propylene oxide,
                                           two changes for 5 min
                                           each.<br>
<br>
          5.                   Replace with a 1:1 mixture of Epon and
                                           propylene oxide for 30
                                           min.<br>
<br>
          6.                   Replace with a 3:1 mixture of
                                           Epon:propylene oxide for 2 to 3
                                           hours.<br>
<br>
          7.                   Transfer tissue to pure Epon for 4
                                           hours.<br>
<br>
          8.                   Embed in fresh Epon.  Polymerize overnight
                                           in a 60&#176;C
                                           oven.<br>
<br>
          9.                   Cut sections 5 to 10 &#181;m thick with a
                                           glass knife.  Dry down on a drop of water. 
                                           Cover slip in Permount.  Alternatively,
                                           cover slip in Epon and polymerize at 60&#176;C.<br>

                                           on subbed slides and dry at room
                                           temperature 2 to 3
                                           hours.<br>

<H1>CHAPTER 7 - GENETIC METHODS</H1>
<H2>A Simplified Ribonuclease Protection Assay for Embryos</H2>
 (Source: G.M. Kelly and R.T. Moon)<br>
<br>
      This is a ribonuclease protection assay based on the methods of Thompson
and Gillespie (<I>Anal. Biochem.</I> <B>163</B>:281-291, 1987) and
Haines and Gillespie (Biotechniques 12:736-740, 1992).  This rapid technique,
which eliminates the need to isolate purified RNA, is extremely sensitive such
that an overnight exposure is sufficient to detect a <I>wnt1</I> signal from
ten 12h embryos (Kelly and Moon, in preparation).  In addition, with the
generation of a standard curve, this assay can also be used to determine the
abundance of a specific transcript.<br>
<br>
      1.  Collect embryos at particular developmental stages in 1.5 ml micro-
centrifuge tubes, and remove the medium.  Add 45 &#181;l of lysis buffer (4 M
guanidine thiocyanate, 25 mM sodium citrate and 0.5% sarcosyl) for every ten
embryos.<br>
<br>
      2.  Draw embryos and lysis buffer through a 22 gauge needle into a syringe,
expel and repeat three times, then vortex and store at -20&#176;C.<br>
<br>
      3.  Centrifuge the embryonic lysates for 1 min to pellet the broken chorions. 
For hybridization, transfer 45 &#181;l of each sample to tubes containing
1x10<em sup>5</em> cpm of <em sup>32</em>P-UTP-labeled antisense probe
diluted in 5 &Ecirc;l of lysis buffer.  Varying the amount of labeled probe may be
necessary to optimize signal to background.  We prefer the Maxiscript kit
available from Ambion (Austin, TX) for making the probes.<BR>
<br>
      4.  As a positive control and to generate a standard curve, hybridize 45
&#181;l of lysis buffer containing either 1.0, 0.1, 0.01, or 0.001 ng of synthetic
sense strand RNA with the radioactive antisense probe.  Similarly, hybridize the
antisense probe with 45 &#181;l of lysis buffer containing 10 &#181;l of
<I>torula</I> tRNA to ensure that the RNAse will digest any unprotected
single-stranded RNA molecules.<br>
<br>
      5.  After an overnight hybridization at 55&#176;C, mix the
sample with 500 &#181;l of RNAse cocktail (20 &#181;l RNAse A, Sigma R-5503,
previously boiled for 5 min, aliquoted and stored at -20&#176;C plus 500 U of RNAse
T1, Sigma R-1003, in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl and 5 mM
EDTA), and incubate at 37&#176;C for 1 hr.  Varying the hybrid-
ization temperature may have an effect of the sensitivity of the assay, we begin
at 55&#176;C and then, if necessary, alter the temperature in 5&#176;C intervals.<br>
<br>
      6.  To isolate nucleic acids after hybridization, digest the lysate with 10
&#181;l of 20% SDS and 5 &#181;l of 20 mg/ml proteinase K, for 45 min at
37&#176;C.  Add Isopropanol (500 &#181;l) and 3 ng of
<I>torula</I> RNA to each sample before centrifuging.  Air dry the pellets,
resuspend in 10 &#181;l of loading buffer (88% formamide, 10 mM EDTA, 1
mg/ml each of xylene, cyanol, and bromophenol blue), heat at 75&#176;C for 4 min,
then place on ice before loading onto a 5% polyacrylamide/urea/taurine gel
(details in the Sequenase kit, US Biochemical).  Electrophorese samples next to
2000 cpm of undigested probe and DNA sequencing reactions to provide size
markers, and process the gel for standard autoradiography.

4.After 10-14 days, the paramecia are ready to feed to the fish larvae.  Cultures remain useable and healthy for a month or more.<br>
<br>
  <A NAME="wptohtml39"><H2>Paramecia for Baby Fish (Streamlined Procedure):</H2></A>  <br>
1. Fill plastic mouse cage or equivalent with 2 liters of system water.<br>
2. Add a large pinch (about 40-50 grams) of boiled wheat, four 250 mg tablets of brewer's yeast, and 100 ml (or half the contents of a plastic seed culture dish) of paramecia culture to each mouse cage.<br>
3. Cover and store in a warm, well-lit place.  The covered mouse cages may be stacked three layers high with the highest layer closest to a warm light.  It will be ready to feed first.<br>
4. Brewer's yeast may also be added to the seed cultures (one half of a 250 mg tablet per 200 ml of seed culture).  The cultures are then ready to use in four days and are depleted after two weeks.<br><br>

<b>
Gastrula</b> - 5 1/4 - Morphogenetic movements of involution, convergence and extension form the epiblast, hypoblast and embryonic axis; through the end of epiboly<p>
<b>
Segmentation</b> - 10 - Somites, pharyngeal arch primordia, and neuromeres develop; primary organogenesis; earliest movements; the tail appears<p>
<b>
Pharyngula</b> - 24 - Phylotypic-stage embryo; body axis straightens from its the early curvature about the yolk sac; circulation, pigmentation, and fins begin development<p>
<b>
Hatching</b> - 48 - Completion of rapid morphogenesis of primary organ systems; cartilage development in head and pectoral fin; hatching occurs asynchronously.<p>

By M. Gerson and D. Stainier Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, UCSF School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA 94143-0554, USA
<p>
	Encouraged by the early report of Speksnijder and Bijmolt, we took advantage of local expertise (i.e. Liz Blackburn's lab) to optimize <i>Tetrahymena</i> culture conditions. <i>Tetrahymena</i> are pear-shaped, ciliate protozoa, about 30-100 micrometers in size.  Although they are not parasites, <i>Tetrahymena</i> can be associated with sick or weakened fish, found on skin lesions where they feed upon bacteria and fungi.<p> 
	As a baby food, <i>Tetrahymena</i> offer the advantage of being easier to
culture and maintain than paramecia since the media is much less complicated to
prepare, and cultures rarely crash.  <i>Tetrahymena</i> can be used as an
exclusive food source for babies until they start eating brine, or can be used
in conjunction with paramecia or rotifers.  The protocol we use is adapted from
one given to us by Cathy Strahl (Blackburn lab) and has provided us with a
reliable supply of <i>Tetrahymena</i> for the past 6 months.

Media Stock Solution (1 liter of 10X PPYS)
<pre>
<b>Component		   Amount  Source</b>

proteose peptone 		200.0 g	Fisher  #DF0120-17-6
yeast extract			 20.0 g	Fisher  #DF0127-17-9
sequestrene (NaFe form)	  	  0.3 g Ciba-Geigy
</pre>
1. Combine proteose peptone, yeast extract, and sequestrene in a large flask.
Adjust to 1000 ml with warm ddH20 and stir until dissolved.<p>

2. Spin at 7K gsA rotor for 20 min.<p>

3. Pour off supernatant into 200 ml aliquots. (Note: a small amount of solid
material in the media will not affect the culture.)<p>

4. Store at -20C.
<p>
Before use:<p>

1. Thaw one aliquot of media and adjust to 1000 ml with ddH20.  Aliquot into
smaller volumes if desired.  Autoclave 20 min.<p>

2. Add P/S/F  (10 ml for a 1000 ml culture; P/S/F not required for small
cultures). P/S/F = penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone (Gibco/BRL #15240-013,
100 ml bottles). This is 100x for use in PPYS.  Can be used at 5x to cure a
mold infection in <i>Tetrahymena</i> cultures.<p>

Note:  medium: 2X for growth +P/S/F 1X for stock tube (strain storage) (no P/S/F)
<p>
<i>Tetrahymena</i> Culture
<p>
Stock tubes<p>

	<i>Tetrahymena</i> can be obtained through Ward's Biology and Lab Supplies, Connecticut Valley Biological, and other biological supply companies.  The strain we use is <i>Tetrahymena</i> <i>Thermophila</i>. 
<p>
1. Maintain <i>Tetrahymena</i> in 10 ml stock tubes of 1X PPYS (no P/S/F).<p>

2. About 2x monthly take 0.2-0.5 ml from top of stock tube (healthiest cells) and transfer to ~5 ml 1X PPYS. Store at room temperature loosely capped for aeration.
<p>
Growth for Harvest<p>

1. Inoculate 0.5-1 ml stock into 50 ml.<p>

2. Grow at 30C O/N shaking at about 100 rpm (if no shaker is available, aerate/bubble at room temperature) for about 24 h.<p>

3. To inoculate a 1 liter culture, prepare a 50 ml culture ahead of time (about
15-25
ml is enough to inoculate a 1 liter culture). Incubate as for 50 ml culture. 
<p>
Harvest<p>

1. Prepare egg H2O (0.3 g Instant Ocean or similar salts/ 1000 ml ddH2O)<p>

2.  For small cultures, spin cells in 50 ml conical tubes, 5-10
minutes, 20C at 3000 rpm clinical centrifuge.  For large cultures, spin cells in 500 ml tubes, 10 minutes, 20C at 5000 rpm gsA rotor.<p>

3. Resuspend pellet in egg H2O and spin again<p>

4. Resuspend pellet in original volume in egg H2O.  Note that cells swim after spinning, so supernatant must be poured off immediately.<p>

Storage and Use<p>

	We dilute 1 liter of <i>Tetrahymena</i> into 2 liters of egg H2O since they
seem to keep better when less concentrated.  Storage at room temperature also
prolongs their life.  (Live <i>Tetrahymena</i> swim in the water column, while
the dead ones fall to the bottom).  We generally add 10 ml of
<i>Tetrahymena</i> per "100 ml" of babies.

Yesterday was momentous - We are now within 1,000 miles of the Wellington finish line and we can almost smell it!<P>

Good on <A HREF="http://www.group4securitas.com/index.html"><I>Group 4</I></A> for sailing another fantastic leg, though there is little sympathy round here while they are becalmed so close to the finish.  Every hour that they sit still in the water is another 7 miles closer for us!<P>

We are having to keep a weather eye open for the tail end of <B>Hurricane Fergus</B>,  but for the moment the albatrosses that have been with us throughout our Southern Ocean adventure, are still escorting  <I>Heath Insured II</I><P>.


On Boxing Day, the South Pacific continued with its never ending
change of moods. Suddenly the squalls, wind and steep seas disappeared, and by mid -day we were sitting on deck with the sun shining and hardly any wind!<P>

It was  a chance to dry out again.  Skipper Adrian Donnovan also took the opportunity to go back up the mast to fine-tune  some of the jury rigging,  but then of course, the wind and  swell started to increase and he had to come down again. <P>

The BT Global Challenge - the world's toughest yacht race - began on 29 September, 1996, when 14 identical 67 foot steel yachtsleave Southampton to start a ten month journey, against prevailingwinds and currents. On route the race will visit Rio de Janeiro,Wellington, Sydney, Cape Town and Boston before returning to the UK on the 15 July 1997.
<A HREF="art_pics/heath_onboard.jpg"><IMG SRC="art_pics/heath_onboard.gif"ALIGN=RIGHT HEIGHT=101 WIDTH=144 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5 BORDER=1></A>
<P>
This will be the second 'wrong-way' round the world race, the
brain child of veteran yachtsman Chay Blyth,the first person to sail solo, non-stop around the world 'the wrong way', but the first race to benefit from a four year sponsorship deal from BT.
<P>

<A HREF="art_pics/st_hea2.jpg"><IMG SRC="art_pics/st_hea2.gif"ALIGN=LEFT HEIGHT=74 WIDTH=144 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=7 BORDER=1></A>

On board the yachts will be over 200 apprehensive amateur yachtsmenand women, many of whom have little or no previous long-haul sailingexperience prior to signing up for the race. Each crew member will be paying up to &#163;18,750 to participate in the race. The volunteers, aged between 21 to 60 years, come from all over the world, from different walks of life and a variety of occupations from Oceanographers to Doctors. Alistair Burns (33), a Lab Assistant living in Lanton, Cardiff has shown just how committed he is to the BT Global Challenge by selling his car and remortgaging his house in order to fund his place on the race. <P>


Alistair commented on his reasons for participating :

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;I have always loved the sea and sailing. I enjoy pushing
myself and finding what I am capable of. The BT Global Challenge
provides me with the opportunity to push myself further than I
have been able to before, and, perhaps more importantly, the opportunityto fulfil a dream - that of sailing around the world.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

<B>The Save The Children Fund</B>
is the official charity of the BT Global Challenge, and all race
and yacht sponsors are delighted that monies raised through fund-raising activities relating to the race will be going to such a world-wide cause.

<P>

The trophy awarded to the winning yacht, <I>The Princess Royal
Trophy</I>, is the result of a competition sponsored by BT. This
competition was open to colleges of art and design as well as
recognised silversmiths, the main component of the trophy being
silver.<HR>

The fleet will set sail from Southampton, England through the
Bay of Biscay and the Doldrums to Rio de Janeiro, around Cape
Horn to Wellington, New Zealand, and then on to Sydney. From therethey will visit Cape Town and Boston before returning to Southampton in July 1997.
<P>
In order to facilitate PR and photographic opportunities two 'Corridors' have been created. The first is the Lisbon Corridor, where competitors must sail east of a line between Berlenga Light at 39.25&#176;N, 9.30&#176;W and 38.40&#176;N, 9.40&#176;W. This corridor is 45 miles long and about
4 days out of Southampton.

<P>
The second is between Tenerife and Las Palmas in the Canaries.
Waypoints on legs two and four will prevent the fleet from heading deep into the Southern Ocean.

<B>Nail-biting finish off Rio's Copacabana Beach</B><br>
<B><FONT SIZE=-1>By Barry Pickthall</FONT></B>


<BLOCKQUOTE>




Mike Golding and his Group 4 crew had expected to be sipping Cipirinhas on Copacabana's Strip on Thursday night, but instead spend the dark hours and much of Friday nervously biting finger-nails while becalmed within sight of the finish line.<P>


They eventually crossed the line at 14:52 GMT on Friday October 25 to take first place on this initial stage of the BT Global Challenge in record time. They completed the 5,000 voyage from Southampton in 26 days 3 hours 47 minutes, almost 3 days ahead of the previous best time set in the previous race by British Steel four years ago. Group 4's average speed for the voyage was 8knots.<P>
 

Throughout the time that Group 4 was becalmed,  Toshiba Wave Warrior,  their closest rival, was remorselessly closing in, and by the time Golding and his crew could give a collective sigh of relief, their lead had shrunk from 40 miles down to 12.<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>"That was a nightmare - an absolute nightmare. I never want to go through a 24 hours like that again."  Mike Golding told The Daily Telegraph's Michael Calvin afterwards.  "To sit there, flopping around for hours on end and seeing your lead reduced is terrible. I know it is part of ocean racing, but it's the aspect I find most difficult. The crew worked extremely hard to gain that advantage and to see it being whittled away is horrendous. The relief, when it's all over, is just tremendous."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

After taking 24 hours to complete the final 40 miles, their problems were compounded just short of the finish when Group 4's lightweight  spinnaker blew out under the pressure induced by the heavy Atlantic swells. It took the crew 3 minutes to gather up the remnants and hoist a headsail, and two more before the staysail was set and pulling them over the last few hundred yards to the finish.<P>


Andrea Bacon, who was taken to hospital today for treatment to friction burns on her left hand when a flailing rope caught her unawares, admitted "It's been a strange, unforgettable 24 hours. At first there was an end-of-term atmosphere. People began to think about a shower, about getting back on land. To be just sitting there, suddenly unable to do anything, was very hard to take."<P>


Golding and his crew have been the pace-setters on this first leg of the race ever since leaving the Solent at the end of September, thanks in part to the pre-race weather research provided by weather guru Vincent Geeke. Their big break  however, came when passing close to the Cape Verde Islands. <BLOCKQUOTE>
"Our pre-race research indicated that the statistically fastest route would involve being to the west, given the current north Atlantic weather pattern" Mike told the Daily Telegraph.
"The crunch point for us was deciding to take an unfavourable gybe out to the west when we were still north  of the Cape Verde Islands where we knew we would take a big loss of miles. But the weather fax images showed the pressure gradient would stay with us for longer and at better angles if we took another big west going hitch."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
And that is exactly as it panned out, for Group 4 was first through the Doldrums and into the South East Trades, and at one point held a 60 mile lead over the fleet.<P>



J&oslash;rgen Philip-S&oslash;rensen, the Chairman of Group 4, was on the quay-side to welcome his victorious crew. "Mike is one of the most determined people I've ever come across and he has turned out to be an exceptional manager and leader" He told The Times.<P>


Toshiba Wave Warrior skippered by Simon Walker, was on the horizon when Group 4 finally crossed the finish line and completed the last 10 mile distance 2 1/4 hours later.  Concert, skippered by Chris Tibbs finished 13 hours later to take third place early today, followed by 'Save the Children'. 
 20 miles behind, a close race has developed between Commercial Union, 3Com and Motorola for 5th place, while only a mile divided Heath Insured II and Ocean Rover in their battle for 8th place. These two have been racing neck-and-neck within sight of each other for the past two weeks.<P>


Adrian Donovan, skipper of Heath Insured II gave an insight to the rising tensions onboard:<BR>

"After sailing within sight of Ocean Rover for two weeks we thought we had finally shaken off 'The Dog' as we call her.  On Tuesday she was 9 miles astern but has since clawed back to within 1 mile of us.  It has been the same ever since we went into the Doldrums together, for each time we get her to heel, Rover has a habit of coming back and nipping at  our ankles again.<P>


We are obviously disappointed that a few of our game-plans for this first leg from Southampton did not work out exactly as planned and left us  trailing race leader Group 4 by 200 miles.  
But the Nuclear Electric crew, the pre-race favourites who are trailing in 10th place 30 miles behind us,  brought a smile to the fleet by playing "Fool - If you think it's all over" during the radio chat show,  dedicating it to Group 4!<P>


We have been slowed by a number of factors.<P>

<B>Sail damage:  -  </B><BR>

 A  blown 2.2oz spinnaker which tore  beyond repair during a 30 knot gust off the  Portuguese coast.<BR>

A tear in the main during the first 24 hours at sea  Loose stitching and chafe on our much-used  genoa.<P>



<B>Illness: -  </B><BR>

Andy Pilkington is down with sun-stroke.<BR>

 Susie Jardine has suffered from a bad arm   since the start and still has it in a sling.<P>



<B>Generator: -      </B><BR>
      
We have had various problems with this but  overcome by using the main engine and transferring the water pump  across to it.<P>

<H3><I>Hiscox  Zephyr policy offers first  class cover and service to quality owners of high value yachts and motor boats</I></H3>

</CENTER>

<H3>Why? .... Robert Hiscox explains:</H3>	



<P><IMG SRC="art_pics/robert-b.gif" ALT="Robert Hiscox" BORDER=0 HSPACE=8 VSPACE=5 ALIGN="LEFT">
The best yachtsmen only buy the best yachts, which they  look after and maintain to the highest standard. We have long insured owners who love their possessions with a passion. <I>Who</I> we insure is far more important than <I>what </I>we insure, so we are seeking to insure yachtsmen who make the extra effort to prevent their yachts being damaged.
<P>
We are delighted to be the insurers of all the yachts taking part in the BT Global Challenge, and we consider this a risk which fits all our requirements. The skippers have years of experience in ocean racing, and although many of the crew are new to round the world sailing, they have all undergone a very tough and demanding training schedule. The yachts themselves are well-made and extremely strong.
<P>
If you are a careful yachtsman and owner of a yacht, and do not want to pay a premium loaded to pay the losses of  careless owners, join our select band of insured yachtsmen by contacting us through the Zephyr Policy page or at our address below.

<H3>Adrian Donovan</H3>

<A HREF="art_pics/c_donovan2.jpg"><IMG SRC="art_pics/c_donovan2.gif"ALIGN=left HEIGHT=108 WIDTH=78 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5 BORDER=1></A>

Adrian Donovan, 38, from Plymouth brings a wealth of experience to Heath Insured II. An ex-Merchant Marine officer on tankers, Adrian took a degree in maritime studies at Plymouth Polytechnic which he passed with honours in 1987. Thereafter he trained as an Instructor Officer at Britannia Royal Naval College at Dartmouth before   pursuing a career as a professional sailing skipper.<P>


When not skippering Adrian has instructed extensively at sailing schools, taking students on RYA courses from Day Skipper to Yachtmaster Ocean and Astral Navigation. He is also a keen Etchells sailor.<P>

Adrian has something over 120,000 miles of sailing behind him, of which some 35,000 miles is ocean racing. He skippered an entry in the 1986 Two Star  two-handed transatlantic race, from Plymouth to Newport, Rhode Island and was nominated for a Silk Cut Seamanship Award for rescuing another yacht in mid-Atlantic, during an Antigua/Azores race.<P>
<A HREF="art_pics/c_donovan1.jpg"><IMG SRC="art_pics/c_donovan1.gif"ALIGN=right HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=90 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5 BORDER=1></A>

In 1992-3 Adrian was the skipper of Heath Insured during the British Steel Challenge Round The World Race.  At the BSC prizegiving Adrian was presented with the Chay Blyth Seamanship Award; his BSC crew won the Challenge Business Award for presenting the least problems to the technical department and Heath Insured herself

During 1995-6 Adrian was the Project Manager of Samantha BrewsterÕs westabout circumnavigation world record bid on board Heath Insured. This role included management of the refit for single-handed sailing, general  preparations for the voyage and mentoring Sam and advising her on overcoming the many technical problems she has encountered on her voyage.<P>


In addition to the above, since the beginning of 1996 Adrian has also run a comprehensive training and  team-building programme for his Heath Insured II crew.  They come from all walks of life and many had little or no sailing skills before their allocation to AdrianÕs crew at the London Boat Show in January. <P>


Following a summer of corporate hospitality sailing, the first leg of the BT Global Challenge starts at Ocean Village, Southampton, on 29 September 1996.<P>

Liz flew out to Rio on 10 November to fill an emergency slot on <I>Heath Insured II</I> for the remaining five legs of the world's toughest yacht race.<P>

Liz, who only received the call to join three and a half weeks earlier said:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Back in July when record-breaking solo yachtswoman <A HREF="http://wire.co.uk/ppl/sam">Sam Brewster</A> returned to Southampton, I told Greg Bertrant of Chay Blyth's company 'The Challenge Business" that there is something about sailing that facinates me and I'd love to get involved in the BT Global Challenge. I knew what the yachts were like as I had already crewded for Adrian Donovan onboard <I>Heath Insured</I> from Boston to Southampton when she returned from a promotional tour a couple of years ago''.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Liz replaces Suzie Jardine who badly injured a shoulder on the first leg and on medical advice reluctantly withdrew from the rest of the race.
<P>

Liz graduated with a BSc in Occupational Therapy and in June this year moved to Newcastle to take a post as a senior occupational therapist with the Freeman Group of Hospitals NHS Trust.

<BLOCKQUOTE>''The Trust has obviously been unable to keep my job open until I return next July, but they have wished me well and suggest that I repply when I get back''.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="art_pics/c_shuffle.jpg"><IMG SRC="art_pics/c_shuffle.gif"ALIGN=RIGHT HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=144 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5 BORDER=1></A>

Ex potteries manager John Shufflebottom (Shuff) has been racing yachts in the Irish sea for a good few years. The 47 year old is the third watch leader and his experience will be used in co-ordinating foredeck work and cockpit tasks. Management and driving the watch are well suited to John's temperament of determination built on his younger years of rugby playing and hard living.<P>

Aside from his watch leader responsibilities, 'Shuff' will assist the chief engineer and work with Julia on plumbing maintenance. John will also be part of the sail locker team and record video footage of the voyage.<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"The BT Challenge is a chance in a lifetime to measure myself against the elements, particularly of the Southern Ocean." said John. "Like 99.9% of people, I work in traditional employment and can only use my annual holidays for leisure and travel. Most people never get the opportunity to put their physical and mental abilities against real adversity. I believe that those who do, and succeed, emerge with greater self-esteem and confidence. The Challenge is likely to be the greatest adventure of my life, and I believe I will emerge from it having developed my character closer to its true potential. I would hate to face the rest of my life making excuses for not taking the opportunity."

<H3>Michael Babcock</H3>
<A HREF="art_pics/c_babcock.jpg"><IMG SRC="art_pics/c_babcock.gif"ALIGN=RIGHT HEIGHT=108 WIDTH=67 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5 BORDER=1></A>
An American by birth, Mike (31), set up home in London with his wife Rebecca a few years ago. Up until he joined the <I>Heath Insured II</I> crew full time, Mike was a practising solicitor, often concentrating on sports contracts, club rules and constitutions.
<P>
Mike has been working hard with Nigel Betts and 'one legger' Howard Thomas to design menus for the legs, calculating quantities, calories, weights and stowage. He is jointly responsible for the mast and rigging and will be the man behind the camera, providing the majority of still shots from <I>Heath Insured II</I>.<P>

Mike could be described as Leeds United's number one fan - so as long as he can get the latest football results via the BBC World Service he will be quite happy. (That is assuming the Leeds score is favourable, one crew member commented, "if Leeds United lose he may not be the easiest man to live with!")<P>



Mike has been sailing dinghies since he was a teenager, he's like a terrier on sail trim and boat speed, always looking for improvement and will be invaluable in keeping up the watch concentration.<P>



When asked why he took the decision to become involved in the BT Global Challenge, Mike said, 
<BLOCKQUOTE>"There comes a point in every day sail when the balance of the day shifts and it's time to return home. Precious few day sailors would not have heard that nagging internal voice: 'Don't turn, let's see what's over that horizon, then the next'.    For me the BT Global Challenge, when all else is said and done, is my chance to succumb to the lure of that siren voice." </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="art_pics/c_betts.jpg"><IMG SRC="art_pics/c_betts.gif"ALIGN=RIGHT HEIGHT=108 WIDTH=67 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5 BORDER=1></A>
Joining the <I>Heath Insured II</I> crew in April this year, Nigel was a late starter to the sailing game. This has not held the 48 year old back, in fact he is proving to be a natural sailor.<P>

The farm and property owner from Reading, is the reigning Southwest of England Croquet champion but has decided to leave his mallet on dry land to take on his toughest challenge yet. Nigel is the driving force behind food purchase and packing for <I>Heath Insured II</I>. He has a jovial and forthright nature which will ensure that his list of duties, which also include sail maintenance, looking after the yacht's water maker and perhaps one of the most 'fun' posts on the yacht, entertainment, will be performed efficiently but with essential good humour.<P>

Following the progress of <I>Heath Insured II</I> from home will be Nigel's wife Penelope and their two teenage children. Nigel has commented 
<BLOCKQUOTE>"I followed the experiences of the novice crews in The British Steel Challenge with great admiration and that particular race fired a personal ambition for me to participate in such an adventure if ever the opportunity arose.   I can appreciate there will be moments of sheer terror, fatigue and many more difficult situations, and I look forward to sharing and overcoming these challenges as part of a closely knit racing team." </BLOCKQUOTE>

Not so long ago, Dave was sitting behind a building society managers desk selling mortgages. The 29 year old single man from Surrey said:<BLOCKQUOTE> "I have now packed in my job, walked out of my suits and moved into T-shirts and shorts and I love it!"</BLOCKQUOTE>

David will be one of two house bosuns and will also share the responsibility for the yacht's sail locker. Primarily David will be at the sharp wet end where his 6ft 14 stone frame will add power and strength to the foredeck crew.<P>

Support is strong on the home front, David's Mum and twin sisters have installed a fax machine to record the progress of <I>Heath Insured II</I> around the world.<P>

David is totally committed to the BT Global Challenge, <BLOCKQUOTE>"Fundamentally, I want to turn my life on its head!   By leaving work, learning new skills, working with a new group of people, seeing exciting new places and taking part in such a physically and mentally demanding race in some very inhospitable seas.   I believe I will return an older, wiser and better person in every sense - and have a great adventure too!"</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Julia Gillespie</H3>

Julia Gilespie, a freelance artist based in Edinburgh will take charge of perhaps one of the most important pieces of kit on the yacht, the watermaker. At home, the 26 year old has worked extensively with the Ocean Youth Club, the experience she has gained will prove invaluable whilst working on the mast and fore deck. <P>

Julia is an active team player who will assist Sally Stewart with the flags and be part of the sail maintenance team. She will also be keeping everyone warm whilst <I>Heath Insured II</I> tackles the southern ocean, care and maintenance of the heating system will also be one of her duties.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"I am seeking an adventure with challenge, excitement and a demand on character and personality." Julia has said. "The elements of wind and water have bedevilled my artistic life in the past. Now to experience it in such depths and strength in the oceans of the world would fulfil or overwhelm my quest for such an experience."</BLOCKQUOTE>

Chief engineer and mast man Andy Pilkington will be in charge of engine maintenance. Andy, a 36 year old motor trader and diesel mechanic has all the experience to deal with the Perkiness engines on board <I>Heath Insured II</I>. His mechanical skills and newly acquired head for heights make him an ideal candidate for hoisting up the mast to check the rigging. <P>

Andy will be followed around the world by his wife Carol and their two young children Leanne and Alex. Competition will be high as Carol herself joins another BT Global Challenge yacht, <I>3COM</I>, in the race back to Southampton.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"I have always wanted to learn to sail since being a child, standing on the coast watching yachts sail over the horizon." Andy said. "Sadly, although involved in many sports, sailing has appeared almost elitist and unapproachable. Without committing
 myself to such a project as BT Global Challenge I feel that I would never gain the experience to become a competent sailor. At the same time I will be fulfilling a lifetime ambition to circumnavigate the world with crews trained professionally to a high standard, on board yachts of high calibre. Racing is an exciting added bonus."</BLOCKQUOTE>

Sally is a full-time nurse at Hinchingbrooke hospital and she will provide the medical expertise on the yacht. A non sailor before she signed up for the BT Global Challenge, Sally admits she is on a steep learning curve but is loving every minute!<P>
<A HREF="art_pics/c_stuart1.jpg"><IMG SRC="art_pics/c_stuart1.gif"ALIGN=LEFT HEIGHT=115 WIDTH=144 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=7 BORDER=1></A>
Aside from serving up the aspirins, Sally will be one of the radio operators, in charge of sending back crew messages each week. Alongside Dave Bracher, she will also be house bosun. Her list of duties on <I>Heath Insured II</I> does not end there, Sally is in charge of declarations and will work with Julia on the flags.<P>

Sally has the total support of her family. Her husband Keith, a GP in Godmanchester near Huntingdon will be holding the fort back home with the family dog Tess, whilst their children James and Mary are away at university.<P>

Commenting on why she has taken up the BT Global challenge Sally said, 

<BLOCKQUOTE>"My love of the sea and wish to sail has taken second place to my own family's needs and my commitment to my husband's	GP responsibilities, plus my nursing career. It is now the right time for 'my challenge' as family and working commitments would allow time."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="art_pics/c_vdhoff.jpg"><IMG SRC="art_pics/c_vdhoff.gif"ALIGN=RIGHT HEIGHT=108 WIDTH=75 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=7 BORDER=1></A>

Until recently, John was a broker with C E Heath. Having considered just doing one leg of the BT Global Challenge, the 48 year old single man from London decided to leave his job and commit himself totally to the race. Enthusiasm and a very competitive spirit will enable John to work long and hard on deck, and his terrier like attitude will make him invaluable as a crew member.<P>




John will be in charge of safety equipment, regularly checking lifejackets and yacht gear. In his down time he will run one of the two video cameras alongside John Shufflebottom.<P>

Why did he give up his job to join <I>Heath Insured II</I>? 
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Because it's there to be done; a once in a lifetime opportunity."</BLOCKQUOTE>

Adrian Whaley was appointed ships mate because, in the words of Adrian Donovan, skipper of <I>Heath Insured II</I>, "he knows the importance of tactics to win a race".<P>
<A HREF="art_pics/c_whall1.jpg"><IMG SRC="art_pics/c_whall1.gif"ALIGN=LEFT HEIGHT=111 WIDTH=144 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=7 BORDER=1></A>
Whaley (33) was a late arrival to the <I>Heath Insured II</I> team, but brings with him a wealth of experience in Sigma sailing. His team came third in their class during Cowes week, his skill in race start tactics and manoeuvres, plus team coaching methods will allow him to gel the crew and give advice on many aspects of the race, sailing, and getting on together.<P>

He and his wife Lyn are expecting their first child in mid February 1997, whilst Adrian is likely to be somewhere in the Southern Ocean!<P>

Adrian's job in the computer industry will be an advantage when it comes to compiling weather information and routing details to compute the optimum course. There are three positive reasons why Adrian has taken on the BT Global Challenge; 
<BLOCKQUOTE>"To experience the Southern Ocean!   To have something to be proud of to look back on when I'm 70!   To win the race!"</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<B>Report from Sally Stewart - 27 December 1996</B><P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<IMG SRC="art_pic1/santa.gif"ALIGN=RIGHT HEIGHT=83 WIDTH=67>

An article published in The Times on Christmas Eve,  headlined 'Donovan faces sack for rocking the boat'  in which <I>Heath Insured II</I> skipper Adrian Donovan is alleged to have been highly critical of Chay Blyth and the BT Global Challenge race organisers, has drawn the following response from the crew.<P>




In an open letter to the Editor of The Times, they write:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A copy of an article in the 24th December issue of the Times has been sent to the yacht via Inmarsat.  Although it is not our intention to get involved in any dispute, actual or alleged, between Adrian Donovan, Chay Blyth or the Heath Group we do wish to make the following two points:<P>


1.  It is simply not true that morale and motivation on board are
low. Despite a series of equipment failures, most worryingly involving the rigging, failures which have affected half the BTGC fleet and are as yet unexplained, and various injuries, two serious, crew spirits are high and we look forward to continuing on together from Wellington after a well deserved break.<P>


2.  We all have the utmost respect for Adrian Donovan as a seaman and skipper and would strongly oppose any attempt to replace him.<P>

We are concerned that your article will mislead family, friends and supporters of <I>Heath Insured II</I> and appreciate the opportunity to set the record straight.<P>

<P>


On the more mundane matter of racing to Wellington, Sally Stewart writes:

<BLOCKQUOTE>My watch has just come on to find Howard has propped himself in the galley and made us mince pies, which were very welcome.<P>

 It's hard to believe it's X-Mas especially as the Southern Ocean returned  yesterday with winds up to 30 knots and very confused seas. We're down to reefed mainsail and staysail trying to protect the rig. Looking ahead, the weather should settle again.<P>


Now, I'm off to get cold, wet  bounce around the deck,  -  An  Xmas to remember!!!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>24 hours later.............</B><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Well, we had a memorable X Mas - The sort we will probably all dine out on  for many years to come! <P>


The Southern ocean was on good form with the wind gusting up to 35 knots, but it was the seas that were worst. They were VERY steep with BIG waves. You sit on the top and look down into this valley below !<BR>

Lunch  was a bit different - a 'westerly ' Beef & dumplings, which in the conditions was most practical. This was followed by a lovely X-Mas pudding. <BR>
Otherwise we just trog on to Wellington. </BLOCKQUOTE>

We're still in the race; the weather is being kind and we're
sailing along on a reach with full main and headsails set.<P>

Yesterday was almost a almost a day of rest. This was added to by the fact Andy appeared with duck tape round the neck of his dry suit ( where he'd mended it ) looking just like a vicar. Being Andy he took this on board  and gave us (his watch) a 'sermon' while at the helm, Unfortunately he went rather off
course! We had tea and scones and  nearly choked on them with laughter. <BR>
After the experienced endured during the past week or so, it was much needed. <P>

Discussions on what we'd like for Christmas if at home have included, - a ballon ride, trip round a racing car circuit, quite weekend in Swiss chalet with log fire etc.  and for me a day at 'The Sanctuary'.  But we'll put up with the southern ocean this Year ! <P>

Happy Christmas to all our friends and followers - and keep up the messages.<P>

<B>Report from Sally Stewart - 21 December 1996</B><P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

<A HREF="art_pics/st_hea5..jpg"><IMG SRC="art_pics/st_hea5.gif"ALIGN=RIGHT HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=100 VSPACE=9 HSPACE=9 BORDER=1></A>


The series of problems that have effected <I>Commercial Union</I>, <I>Global Teamwork</I>, <I>Toshiba</I>, <I>3 Com</I> and <I>Save The Children</I> and resulted in <I>Concert</I>
being dismasted have now dealt <I>Heath Insured II</I> a major blow.<P>

In a fax to Heath  during the night skipper Adrian
Donovan advised that they had now identified 5 broken strands in the forestay (out of a total of 19 strands).<P>

The heavy wind and sea had prevented a full check as injuries on board meant that <I>Heath Insured II</I> has no fit mastman. <BR>
Adrian eventually managed to get up the mast despite the wildly pitching and rolling boat and discovered that there were three broken strands on the starboard stay together with a fractured bracket that joins the stay to the mast. <P>

If it had not been for the fast reactions of the duty watch who crash jibed the boat the instant the bracket broke and the mast went 2-3 feet out of line the mast would have broken in two above the second spreader.<P>

<I>Heath Insured II</I> could only continue in safety on a port tack and had to suffer the acute frustration of sailing due north away from Wellington and out of the second leg of the race.<P>

In the cold light of day Adrian had to start the long job of planning and executing a jury rig and re-rigging the mast to enable her to continue sailing. He is in constant touch with the Challenge Business technicians and his Heath shore team, but until all the options are explored and rigging plans agreed we will not know precisely when we can expect <I>Heath Insured II</I> in Wellington.<P>

There have been no crew injuries from this latest setback and messages from the yacht indicate that crew morale remains high, however, the crew are now struggling to come to terms with their problems in last place among the fleet,  some 500 miles behind race leader, <I>Group 4</I><P>

Sally Stewart adds 
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Morale is high just a bit disappointed that we will be in Wellington, New Zealand after New Year. We have just experienced yet another Southern Ocean storm which slowly abated as the day wore on. We were all fairly shattered by the news of  <I>Concert</I>'s dismasting, which has  become the main topic of conversation onboard, especially in view of our own forestay strands. But there's nothing to do but be careful, watch the rig and sail on. <BR>

Today is a new day, we'll see what it brings"</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Group 4</I>, skippered by Mike Golding, continues to press home their advantage on this second stage of the BT Global Challenge.  Now within 1,400 miles of the Wellington finish, they have opened up a 51 mile lead over second placed <I>Save the Children</I>, and leave <I>Toshiba Wave Rider</I>, their nearest rival for overall honours, more than 100 miles astern.<P>

Both <I>Save the Children</I> and <I>Toshiba</I> have been struck by the same rigging fatigue problems that led to <I>Concert</I> being dismasted earlier this week, and four other crews also reporting stranding stays.<P>

The damage list this weekend reads:  Concert (dismasted); Global Teamwork, Heath Insured II, Save the Children;  (stranding forestay and backstay); Commercial Union (stranding forestay and lower shroud) 3Com (stranding forestay);  Toshiba Wave Warrier (stranding cap shroud).<P>

Luckily, there have been no serious injuries, but the problems are uncannily similar to the time-bomb that beset this same fleet in almost exactly the same place, four years ago.<BR>
Then, <I>British Steel II</I> was dismasted and six others suffered serious rigging problems caused by fatiguing bottlescrews. <P>

The crew of <I>Concert</I>, who had finished third on the first leg of the race from Southampton to Rio, are now motoring to Chatham Island where they will take on more fuel for the remainder of the voyage to Wellington.<P>

Tim Jeffery, the yachting correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, who is sailing aboard <I>Courtaulds Int</I>.,  reported this week <BLOCKQUOTE>"Unlike four years ago, there is no pattern. Then the problem focused on the rigging screw anchoring the forestay to the bow. Now it seems to be the wire supporting the mast forwards, backwards and sideways. <P>

It is plain from the skippers that they will want answers, and a solution they have faith in, before they lead their crews into the Southern Ocean again."</BLOCKQUOTE>

Andrew Roberts, the race project director, is equally baffled by these breakages.  He told 'The Times' : <BLOCKQUOTE>"On other  Global Challenge yachts, this rigging has lasted more than 100,000 miles of sailing, but in this case, seems to have reached its fatigue life after just 10,000 miles. <BR>
We are trying to come up with a reason why.  One thing I've picked up is that the yachts have been on the same tack - starboard - for between 75 and 90% of the race so far, or close to 10,000 miles.  The strain may have been unusually acute on one side of the boat for days on end - which is something that cannot be replicated  in sea trials."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Heath Insured II</I> skippered by Adrian Donovan has become the 5th yacht within the BT Global Challenge fleet to suffer rig damage during the second stage of this round the world race from Rio to Wellington, New Zealand.<P>


Adrian Donovan reported last night:<BLOCKQUOTE> "A strand of wire has broken at the top of our forestay and if it goes anything like  it did on 3Com,  then the stay will break completely."</BLOCKQUOTE>

The damage could not have come at a worse time for the Heath crew, who had been working hard over the past week to overhaul <I>Ocean Rover</I> and move up into 10th place.<P>

They had to take down the headsail to relieve pressure on the stay and rig up safety lines to insure against being dismasted should the  stay part unexpectedly.<P>


The loss of the headsail dropped <I>Heath Insured</I>'s speed by  almost a knot   -  "It means that Rover will be through us within 3 hours" Donovan conceded mournfully.<P>


It may be possible to repair the stay by shortening its span, but the crew will need calm weather to do that,  and that is not on the menu at present.<P>


Yesterday, Donovan reported that the 'Furious Fifty' latitudes were living up to their reputation, giving them icy 50 knot headwinds, making it impossible for anyone to work for any time at the top of the mast. "We are just going to have to wait for things to calm down a bit - It s all very frustrating" said Donovan whose crew still have more than 2,000 miles to go before reaching Wellington.<P>

<B>Report from Sally Stewart - 16 December 1996</B><P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="art_pics/st_hea4.jpg"><IMG SRC="art_pics/st_hea4.gif"ALIGN=RIGHT HEIGHT=92 WIDTH=144 VSPACE=9 HSPACE=9 BORDER=1></A>
On the first leg,  <I>Heath Insured II</I> and <I>Ocean Rover</I> crews were in sight of each other for the last two weeks before reaching Rio.  The magnetic attraction continues.<P>

The two crews rounded the Concert waypoint mark on Sunday within sight of each other, and by early this morning, one mile was still all that divided them in 10th and 11th places.<P>

One advantage of being at the back of the fleet when going this way round the world, is that you know what to expect of the weather from the yachts ahead.  Yesterday, as <I>Group 4</I> and <I>Save the Children</I> were slugging it out to windward at the head of the fleet,  Adrian Donovan and his team on <I>Heath</I> were making the most of the more balmy conditions by taking scones and tea on deck!<P>

They were also celebrating the news that Chay Blyth and his race organisers have shortened the leg.  The decision to rescind the early 600 mile extension to the course off New Zealand was taken on Saturday, shortly before the leaders  rounded the Concert mark, in light of the fact that three of the 14-strong fleet have now suffered rigging damage.<P>

Sally Stewart onboard <I>Heath Insured II</I> reported back <BLOCKQUOTE>"Good sailing yesterday with sun and tonight it is quieter with a beautiful star filled sky - a sight we haven't seen for a while. Yesterday was filled with the good news of sailing straight to Wellington  especially for the bunk-bound, smiles all round"!</BLOCKQUOTE>

They were right to enjoy it while it lasted, for the weather forecast for the area today makes for grim reading. The Meteorological Office predicts:
<BLOCKQUOTE>'Deep depressions are progressing swiftly eastwards between 50 & 60 S latitudes (<I>Group 4</I>'s position this morning was 54 degrees S) Two such depressions are expected to pass just to the south of the route during Monday and Tuesday, producing some very strong winds with an active cold front approaching from the south later on Tuesday'</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>No one onboard can complain that they are not getting their money's worth!</B><P>

<B>Report from Sally Stewart - 13 December 1996</B><P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="art_pics/c_shuffle.jpg"><IMG SRC="art_pics/c_shuffle.gif"ALIGN=RIGHT HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=144 VSPACE=9 HSPACE=9 BORDER=1></A>

We continue in true Southern Ocean conditions: large waves, grey skies and the thud and crash as we go up a wave and down the other side. <BR>

We have had a busy night with squalls reaching up to 42 knots  coming through thick and fast and it is cold and wet!<BR>

But we are pushing on, really feeling we are making progress and everyone is working so hard to help each other.<P>



Life on board is very short handed with the injuries we have. I was cooking breakfast this morning when I was needed on deck for a sail change  and then poor Julia needed to be helped out of her bunk as nature calls -  improvisation is the latest game!  <P>



To pass the time when trying to keep warm on deck we have decided to make up limericks:  
	<BLOCKQUOTE>There was a old man called McPhie<BR>
	Who desparately wanted a Pee<BR>
	He came down to the galley<BR>
	To ask permission from Sally<BR>
	Who said not 'till you've cleared up your tea.</BLOCKQUOTE>

We will send further instalments if required !!!<P>


My patients are recovering slowly. I havenÕt done my ward round yet but yesterday  I managed to get Adrian Whaley comfortable and he has just woken now feeling much better, he is up and about but taking it gently,  he appears pain free at the moment.<P>

Andy ventured briefly on deck and was surprised how big the waves were since he last went out ! He has had to go off again, he tried to helm but then the wind got up, causing severe pain in his ribs, hopefully when it settles he'll be back on light duties. <P>

Howard's leg is improving but uncomfortable when he stands for long.  The problem now is he has punctured the inflatable sheep we were using to elevate the leg! <BR>
Julia's collar bone is more comfortable  and she is able to get out to use her 'Apricot pot' but is otherwise confined to her bunk. The two crew may be let out of the playpen to-day depending slightly on the weather!<P>


It was John Shuff's birthday yesterday and he came on watch at midnight to a chorus of  'Happy Birthday'. It was certainly a memorable birthday but perhaps not in the way he planned. We decided to make him a muffin cake. It was fine until we were looking to see how it was doing - as the oven door was opened <I>Heath Insured</I> hit a wave and out flew the baking tray, hit the surface, did a somersault and distributed the contents all over the floor!<BR>
We managed to salvage enough to make a small cake for him out of the top layer for when he came off watch, having weathered the squalls and more than half frozen.<BR>
Still, the episode will make a good story in the pub next year!<P>

Observation for the day, it never really gets dark at the moment but then it's nearly the longest day.<P>
Nigel is back on the helm. As for Sally, she thinks she might take up sailing!<P>

<B>Report from Barry Pickthall - 10 December 1996</B><P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="art_pic1/onboard16.jpg"><IMG SRC="art_pic1/onboard16.gif"ALIGN=RIGHT HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=90 VSPACE=9 HSPACE=9 BORDER=1></A>

<B>195 amateurs are bloodied at Cape Horn</B><BR>

It is one of the most fearsome places in the world, and certainly led to butterflies  causing more than a few upset stomachs as the 14-strong amateur crews competing in the BT Global Challenge including those aboard <I>Heath Insured II</I>, rounded Cape Horn last week, the big turning point in the second stage of this race from Rio to Wellington, New Zealand.<P>

<I>Save the Children</I> skippered by Andy Hindley took the honours of being first to feel the force of the Furious Fifties as they headed upwind into the teeth of the first depression to sweep in from the Pacific,  but the gap between first and last, amounted to no more than 110 miles - with another 4.900 to go!<P>

Two crew were not able to experience this highlight to racing around the world. 36 year old Austrian Knut Kinast, the mate on <I>Save the Children</I> had to be taken off the yacht for urgent medical treatment  by the crew of the Royal Navy frigate HMS Lancaster.<BR>
He was followed ashore by  Rhian Jenkins, 27,  who was airlifted off <I>Global Teamwork</I> with a suspected duodenal ulcer and flown to a hospital on the Falklands. <P>

<I>Group 4</I> skippered by Mike Golding was 3rd to round on December 3, three hours behind the leader, but  four days later, was leading the pack across the icy seas of the Southern Ocean.<P>

These are the conditions that Golding likes most.  In the last race four years ago, his <I>Group 4</I> crew lost 36 hours when forced to put into Florianopolis, Brazil to repair sails and replace a rigging screw which broke four days out from Rio,  but then made up enormous time  to set the fastest elapsed time between Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope.<P>

Golding set out from Rio this time with a 2 hour 9 minute lead in the overall standings over <I>Toshiba Wave Rider</I>  which trailed Round Cape Horn in 5th place and on December 7 was still trailing 53 miles astern.<P>

<I>Save the Children</I> and <I>Global Teamwork</I> in second place at Cape Horn, also offer little threat to <I>Group 4'</I>s overall lead at this stage. <I>Save the Children</I> finished the first stage of the BT race in 4th place 18 hours behind Golding's crew, while <I>Global Teamwork</I> has to make up more 3 days, 6hours 49 minutes after finishing in 11th place at the first stop-over. <P>

Andrea Bacon sailing onboard <I>Group 4</I> reported this week <BLOCKQUOTE>"Temperatures have dropped considerably and there is now an icy feel in the air. Heaters are on for the first time, making it toasty warm below decks.<BR>

It is now oh, so difficult to get out of that warm sleeping bag to go on watch"</BLOCKQUOTE>

But even at the back of the fleet, the excitement of Cape Horn and the Southern Ocean was shared in equal measure aboard <I>Heath Insured II</I> sponsored by the <A HREF="http://www.ceheath.co.uk/index.html">London Insurance Group</A>.  Her skipper, Adrian Donovan messaged home:
<BLOCKQUOTE> ''Well, we are all Cape Horners!<br>

<I>Heath Insured II</I> passed this infamous Cape at 08:52 GMT with 35 knots of wind on the nose.  This was very different to last time when we ran round under spinnaker and glorious sunshine.<BR>
It was near freezing this time - Four years ago the weather was warm enough for one of our number to attempt to become the first man to sail round naked, only he forgot about his bobble-hat, so failed to make it into the record books.<P>

This of course is my second passage round which makes me eligible I suppose to wear two gold earrings.  However, <A HREF="crew_gutsy.htm">Gutsy the Gorilla</A>, our mascot, has now been round three times and this time sat with his back to the bow in the hope that we might remember to pierce his second ear - Samantha Brewster, who sailed round with him alone last winter during her solo circumnavigation in <I>Heath Insured</I>, was too busy to attend to such fine details!<P>

We have our work cut out too,  because the blown spinnakers experienced since leaving Rio have cost us dearly.  But we won't be needing them for some time now as we head into the teeth of the 'Roaring Forties' and 'Screaming Fifties' across the Pacific to New Zealand. <P>

That means there is time enough for the Heath 'sewing circle' to complete the repairs while we are bashing our heads going to windward for the next month or so.<P>

Just another 4,900 miles to go!<P>

It is cold and tough, but as I have reminded my crew,  it is times like this that the tough get going!''<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Since rounding the Cape, a weather fax from the Chilean Navy predicting that the wind would come from  the north, led several to take the soft option and head upwards into warmer waters to meet it. Among them was <I>Save the Children</I> and third placed <I>Global Teamwork</I> , but all they found was a frustrating lack of wind.<P>


 <I>Group 4</I> on the other hand, soldiered on a more southerly course and gained 35 miles in 8 hours to take the lead.
Andy  Hindley summed up his feelings soon after reading the latest positions aboard <I>Save the Children</I>:
<BLOCKQUOTE> "I hate it when there's no wind... Where are we? Calmsville, South Atlantic. I thought it was calm, but that's nothing compared to now... why do we punish ourselves this way? We work for 3 or 4 years getting ready for this chance to sail a yacht in a round the world race, then subject ourselves to the torments and fickleness of nature..."</BLOCKQUOTE>

Onboard <I>Heath Insured II</I>, the lighter winds came as a mixed blessing:  
<BLOCKQUOTE>"The yacht is filled with mixed emotions" reports Sally Stewart. "On the one hand there is relief at the short respite we are enjoying from the 30 degree list that our world has taken since rounding Cape Horn. There are thanks too that the constant spray and and pounding has stopped and that we now have time to make repairs and clean the boat.  On the other hand, there is the frustration at finding that we have slipped to 12th place within the fleet and annoyance perhaps that this is not quite as Chay Blyth's brochure portrayed the Southern Ocean.<BR>
Perhaps we might get a rebate from him when we reach Wellington?"</BLOCKQUOTE>


No Sally, there will be no rebate but Blyth is adding value to the voyage in the form of an extra 600 miles to compensate for any disappointments to date.<P>

According to Race organisers in today's "Course Echo" which calls on all yachts to  leave  waypoint Echo (50 S, 170 E), to starboard was taken in view of the fleet's fast sailing time to date, and was taken now to ensure that all fourteen yachts could be informed  by satellite link or radio before they reach the first  of these gates  - the Concert waypoint - some 750 miles to the west.<P>

For the last three days, <I>Group 4</I> has set the fastest pace, covering  187 miles on Sunday and 203 on Monday - an average speed of 8.5 knots - which, should she maintain this pace, will see her round the Concert waypoint some time on Friday.<P>

Amateurs they my be, but having paid upwards of &#163;19,000 for the adventure, Chay Blyth cannot be accused of not giving the <I>Heath Insured</I> crew their money's worth!

<B>Report from Adrian Donovan - 5 December 1996</B><P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="art_pic1/onboard15.jpg"><IMG SRC="art_pic1/onboard15.gif"ALIGN=RIGHT HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=90 VSPACE=9 HSPACE=9 BORDER=1></A>



We march toward an army of waves armed only with a mighty weapon of steel, dacron and personal endeavour.  The scene of our constant battle is thinly lit by  the sun which appears fleetingly from behind a curtain of grey cloud. <P>

For the warriors, time on the battlefield is long, hard, cold and wet.  Rest and recreation below is also cold, wet and pitifully short, made worse by the constant threat of the call 'all hands on deck' should we need to make a sudden sail change or worse.<P>

Around us, low over the advancing waves, wheel albatrosses and giant fulmars; the Albert Balls and Red Barons of our fight. Or are
they perhaps, the James Camerons and Don McCullins?  Intimately involved yet seemingly so aloof.<P>

Later, when this makes more sense, we shall think again of loved ones at home and seek comfort in things familiar.  For now we are in a damned and threatening place and  must keep those thoughts which give us comfort, away and out of danger.<P>

And then...... life is brought back to reality with  tinned spotted dick for our tea!!'<P>


<B>News from Sally Stewart</B><BR>

We're begining to get used to doing everything at a steep angle. Even simple things like cleaning teeth become interesting because when we  crash off a wave the brush so often ends up in your ear or up your nose!<P>

As for typing !!!  Well, I would not be surprised if our e-mails did not finish up as total jibberishhhhh!<P>

We think we must have stowaways in the engine room, as every now & then the door flies open, and mysteriously, we lose a large portion of whatever is cooking on the stove. That's what the chefs tell us when we ask for seconds.<P>

My patients are recovering slowly. Nigel Betts is back at the helm again but still has to be careful.

<B>Report from Adrian Donovan - 4 December 1996</B><P>

Well, we are all Cape Horners!<BR>
<I>Heath Insured II</I> passed this infamous Cape at 08:52 GMT this morning with 35 knots of wind on the nose.  This was very different to last time when we ran round under spinnaker and glorious sunshine.<P>


It was near freezing this time - Four years ago the weather was warm enough for one of our number to attempt to become the first man to sail round naked, only he forgot about his bobble-hat, so failed to make it into the record books.<P>


This of course is my second passage round which makes me eligible I suppose to wear two gold earrings.  However, Gutsy the Gorilla, our mascot, has now been round three times and this time sat with his back to the bow in the hope that we might remember to pierce his second ear - Samantha Brewster, who sailed round with him alone last winter during her solo circumnavigation in Heath Insured, was too busy to attend to such fine details!<P>

We have our work cut out too,  because the blown spinnakers experienced since leaving Rio have cost us dearly.  But we wonÕt be needing them for some time now as we head into the teeth of the 'Roaring Forties' and 'Screaming Fifties' across the Pacific to New Zealand. <P>


That means there is time enough for the Heath Ôsewing circleÕ to complete the repairs while we are bashing our heads going to windward for the next month or so.<P>

<B>Just another 4,900 miles to go!</B><P>


It is cold and tough, but as I have reminded my crew,  it is times like this that the tough get going!

<B>Report from Sally Stewart - 30 November 1996</B><P>

<B>Bad news.</B><BR>
Our third spinnaker has just blown out. It went during a sudden gust, moments before we could trip the  guy and bring it down. The sail parted with a bang at the clew and the rip went up the entire length of the chute.<P>

It brought a communal groan from the <I>Heath Insured's</I> press-ganged 'sewing circle' which is already working round the clock to sew up the light weather spinnaker we lost within 3 hours of the start, and the flanker we lost earlier this week.<P>

The slightly better news is that Andy Pilkington is up and about again but not helped by his continued cough.  Andy is also feeling better since the wave washed everyone down the deck, though is still on light duties.<P>

We have to get these sails back in working shape before we can hope to start moving back up the fleet.<BR>
The only consolation is that we have our old rivals  <I>Ocean Rover</I> keeping us company.  This at least gives us something to judge our recovery by.<P>

We should be at Cape Horn within 3-4 days and then we will see who's the toughest crew.

<B>Report from Sally Stewart - 28 November 1996</B><P>

Wednesday was a day we will long remember - And was  no doubt, a taster of things to come.<P>

It began with the winds increasing suddenly from 5 to 25 knots as a 'Pampero' swept across our course. First there was a cry to change sail and five of us rushed forward onto the foredeck, which by now was pitching and heaving quite badly.<P>

Then, without warning, this 6ft high wall of green water came crashing over the boat, sweeping everyone along with it.  Howard Thomas was thrown 3ft into the air and twisted his leg badly against the forestay. Julie Gillespie was lifted up and thrown against the same stay. The weight of Andy Pilkington's not-so-heavy body has left its mark on the pulpit, while John van der Hoff and Adrian Whaley damaged the dorade box before landing up against the mast!<P>

As the wave carried on rolling down the deck, engulfing the boom, I was swept off my feet and landed up on the other side of the deck, followed in quick succession by the Yankee headsail wrapped up in its bag.  Angus McPhie, who was on the wheel at the time,  tried to hold on, but he too was swept back and flattened against the backstay.<P>

The wave took everyone's breath away, and as Medic, I was called on to sort out all the injuries.<BR>
Most of us suffered  only bruising, though Andy appears to have cracked a rib and Howard has damged the back of his right leg which is now bandaged up with a splint.<P>

24 Hours later, and liberal quantities of 'tender loving care'  and both appear to be on the mend, though still on light duties.<P>

Those 'light duties' include membership to the sewing circle running on a 24 hour basis to repair the spinnaker we blew out so early in the race.<P>

Everyone is working hard and morale is high as we creep up through the fleet.<P>

If only we could get rid of these bad colds that are now aflicting us all!<P>

It has been 'all hands on-deck' in an effort to repair the spinnaker we blew out within 2 hours of the start,  and make every effort to catch up with the leaders. <P>

Life is certainly improving since that wet, windless start from Rio, though the Fairway buoy, which held us like a magnet for so long, still haunts us.   But we are at least drying out in the strong sunshine and morale is high as we creep up on the fleet - Stealth  Insured is back in action!!<P>

Seasickness is still with us, though with some, we are not sure if it is more 'Rio Tum', alcohol withdrawal, or in <A HREF="crew_pilkington.htm">Andy Pilkington</A>'s case, a mixture of salt water agravating his infected ear. He got a total soaking while working on the foredeck and has been complaining of ear-ache and sickness ever since. Anti-biotics on an empty stommach have not helped, but since wearing his 'dry-suit', he says it is improving. At least he is dry!<P>


Another problem has been <A HREF="crew_betts.htm">Nigel Betts</A> who has a bad cough which has left the poor fellow somewhat disorientated.  Yesterday, for instance, he came and shook me awake  in my bunk just two hours after I had gone off watch - 3 HOURS ahead of time. <BR>
If that was not enough, that night,  he picked up a kit bag and threw it onto the top bunk while I was asleep in it, leaving me completely winded. <BR>
I have since  got my own back. As medic onboard, I have put him on anti-biotics!

<B>Report from Skipper Adrian Donovan - 23 November 1996</B><P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="art_pic1/onboard1.jpg"><IMG SRC="art_pic1/onboard1.gif"ALIGN=RIGHT HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=101 VSPACE=9 HSPACE=9 BORDER=1></A>
The first mile of this 7,000 mile leg from Rio to Wellington was one of the slowest I have ever sailed. With no wind and  the rolling South Atlantic swell killing whatever boatspeed our flapping sails might have produced, we sat for an hour within danger of hitting the Fairway buoy, the mark we had to round before heading south for Cape Horn.<P>

As the loom of Rio slowly melted into the evening horizon,  the winds steadily increased to 18 knots, but within 6 hours the gods handed down more problems. Our valuable 2.2oz reaching spinnaker blew out big time, and the remnants now sit limply in its bag. <BR>
This was a double frustration, for this was the same spinnaker that blew out off  Portugal soon after the start of the first leg.  It had been repaired locally during the last few days of the stop-over in Rio.<BR>
At the time it blew out, we were slugging it out toe-to-toe with Group 4.  When the head just let go, we then lost more time recovering the sail as it dragged astern of us like some giant sea anchor.<P>

We continue to lose time of the other boats because without this important sail, we are forced to sail different angles to the wind - wider when downwind with the Big Blue kite up, or more upwind if forced to reach under headsails. The difference is now 20 miles behind the race leaders <I>Time & Tide</I>, with <I>Group 4</I>  just 7  miles ahead.<P>


Routines onboard are slowly being re-established, but we are dogged by seasickness and tiredness. Various coughs and sore throats picked up during our last few days in Rio are incubating in the closed, humid confines below decks.<P>

Andy Pilkington, who suffered the embarrasment of being sick over the side just as the spectator boat carrying his wife Carol was passing close by, blames his 'mal de mare' on the sea creature that attached itself inside his ear while we were holidaying down at Ilhabeia.  The creature has now gone, but not the inflamation.<P>


We probably face 3 days more in these wind conditions, and will have to work out our sailing angles very carefully to minimise further losses on the fleet. <BR>
Losing this sail so early in the race is more of a blow than having no wind at the start!

<B>Report from Barry Pickthall in Rio de Janeiro - 21 November 1996</B><P>







<BLOCKQUOTE>





The crew from <I>Courtaulds</I> expected it to be a fire cracker of a start and their supporters had the rocket power to make it so, but a Brazilian rain storm coupled with no wind turned the start of the second stage of the BT Global Challenge into something of a damp squid!<P>



The rain came into every corner, down necks, cuffs and into boots, and with <I>Heath Insured II</I> and her 13 rivals barely able to make a headway against the rollingswells off Copacabana's Strip, there was no escape.<P>



Adrian Donovan and his crew were third across the line but then fell into the wind shadow of the Race leader <I>Concert</I> and drifted slowly back.<BR>

Coming up to the Fairway Buoy, <I>Heath Insured</I> was still well up, but then suffered the double blow of having to give way to <I>Courtaulds International</I> and then promptly fell into a private hole that held them at the mercy of the currents for the next hour.<P>



It was a bittler blow for the crew who had psyched themselves up for a good start to the 7,000 mile leg around Cape Horn to Wellington, New Zealand.<P>



All is not lost, however, for 20 hours into the race Heath was only 12 miles behind the race leader, with the fleet still tightly bunched off Cape San Diego.<P>



Despite the damp start, the crew was buoyed by the many good luck messages, not least the one sent by Sally Stewart's pet dog, warning her to be ware of the 'growlers'.<BR>

There should be no worries about those as  the 'growlers', as small icebergs are better known , are very low in the Southern Ocean this year and should not pose a problem.<br>



The crews must also pass a waypoint mid-way across the Pacific, put there to keep the crews from straying too far south.<P>



And if speeds are anything like the record pace set on the first stage of the race from Southampton, crews could be forced round a second waypoint south-east of New Zealand, that will add a further 600 miles to the course to keep the yachts at sea until after Christmas.

<B>Report from Sally Stewart in Rio de Janeiro - 19 November 1996</B><P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>


<B>What a month!</B><BR>
We may have finished the first leg of the BT Global Challenge back in 8th place, but the elation of beating <I>Ocean Rover</I> across the line after racing within sight of 'The Dog' as we call her, for the better part of two weeks, lasted several days.<BR>
Another lasting memory was that first fresh-water shower in our hotel on Copacabana's Strip, together with that first breakfast of fresh fruit and bread rolls. After five weeks at sea, it is amazing how the simple pleasures in life become so important.<P>

<B>Led astray ashore</B><BR>
And talking of pleasures, the local Ciapitania's - that lethal Brazilian drink, have helped to lead several of our number astray.<BR>
During our stay there have been several cases of crews being mugged but 'Commander' Nigel Betts and Angus 'The Admiral' McPhie, discovered a kinder side to Rio. Helping each other home after a night on the tiles, 'The Commander' lost his shoe, tripped up and landed in the gutter. 'The Admiral', now without his social prop, did his best to recover Betts' missing footware, which by now took the shape of three shoes, but was unable to connect until help arrived in the form of a street begger who got the two <I>Heath</I> men back on their feet and sent them on their way - without helping himself to their wallets!<P>

John Mackenzie-Green, Heath's MD, who made a flying visit out to Rio last week to gee up his crew, also contributed to the gaiety by taking his team out to a slap-up dinner - in a transvestites' bar! Unfortunately, our men were too far gone to realise something was wrong before making fools of themselves!<P>

<B>Voyage from Hell</B><BR>

We enjoyed a marvelous week-long holiday at a beach-side house in Marbela, but the 150 mile trip proved, in The Admiral's words ''to be the voyage from Hell''. We went down in <I>Ocean Rover</I>'s Land Rover which was taken as an open-hearted gift from our rivals, but proved to be our punishment for beating them.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>''The seats were without cushions and the canvas hood was full of holes which did not afford much protection in the torrential rain that fell on us'' Angus McPhie recalled. ''Our biggest hurdle, however, were the 'sleeping policemen' scattered indiscriminently between here and the resort. Ten sets of sleepers might have been acceptable - 50 would have been endurable, but the 100th became an uncomfortable joke and the 200th was just too much to bear'' said Angus, who is still suffering from 'Harken Arse' after perching on <I>Heath</I>'s main winches for too long during the first leg.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>May Day....May Day....</B><BR>
There was more excitement for the <I>Heath</I> crew early last Saturday while we were acting as nightwatchmen on the fleet moored out in the Bay. Suddenly, there was a 'May Day' call from a ship anchored close by off Cagarras Island. According to the radio operator, eight pirates had boarded his ship at 01:20am and taken the Captain and First Officer prosoner. It finished up with the radio operator providing a running commentary on the attack via a hand-held radio as he ran around the ship. The <I>Heath</I> crew did their best to alert the Port Authorities and Police, but it took 1/12 hours before any action was taken which left us to wonder what would happen if pirates had attacked one of the BT Challenge yachts instead!<P>

Well- by 3pm on Wednesday (17:00GMT) all this will be behind us. Instead, our minds will be focused on the terrors of Cape Horn and what lies ahead in the icy seas of the Southern Ocean.<BR>
<B>Is there no end to this adventure?</B>

<B>Report from Adrian Donovan in Rio de Janeiro - 27 October 1996</B><P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>


<I>Heath Insured II</I> and <I>Ocean Rover</I> had been fighting over 8th  position for the past two weeks, right up to within sight of the finish line. We then had to endure a tedious and tantalising final 48 hours as we both drifted in light airs.<P>


<I>Rover</I> managed to round the fairway buoy just opposite the Meridian Hotel about 100 yards ahead of <I>Heath</I> where they had just 1.8 miles of sailing parallel to the beach to go to the line.<P>



We decided to tack away from the surf and found just an ounce of breeze as <I>Ocean Rover</I> ran into a hole. We finally crossed the finish line to claim 8th place, 27 days 16 hours 32 minutes and 03 seconds after setting out from Southampton on 29th September. Ocean Rover finished less than two hours later.<P>



We all enjoyed our first real meal after four weeks of freeze dried food, with a beer to wash it down.<P>

We then have some time to relax and do some maintenance before preparing for the next stage of the race around Cape Horn to Wellington New Zealand, starting from Rio on November 24.<P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#EB0000">Shaking off 'The Dog' - Day 25</FONT></H3><P>


<B>Report from Adrian Donovan - 24 October 1996</B><P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>


Skipper Adrian Donovan, reports from onboard <I>Heath Insured II</I> as tension rises over the final 300 miles to Rio de Janeiro.<P>


"After sailing within sight of <I>Ocean Rover</I> for more than a week we have finally shaken off 'The Dog' as we call her.  <BR>
Yesterday she was 9 miles astern but seemingly sailing at a better angle to the wind and making a knot more than <I>Heath</I>. This morning, she is back to within 2 miles of us.  It has been the same ever since we went into the Doldrums together, for each time we get her to heel, <I>Rover</I> has a habit of coming back and nipping our ankles again.<P>



We are obviously disappointed that a few of our game-plans for this first leg from Southampton did not work out exactly as planned and left us  trailing race leader <I>Group 4</I> by 200 miles.  
But the <I>Nuclear Electric</I> crew, the pre-race favourites who are trailing in 10th place 48 miles behind us,  brought a smile to the fleet by playing "Fool - If you think it's all over" during the radio chat show,  dedicating it to <I>Group 4</I>!<P>



We have been slowed by a number of factors.<p>

<B>Sail damage: </B> - 	
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE><LI>A  blown 2.2oz spinnaker which tore beyond repair during a 30 knot gust off the Portuguese coast.
<LI>A tear in the main during the first 24 hours at sea
<LI>Loose stitching and chafe on our much-used genoa.
</UL><P>


<B>Illness: -</B>		
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE><LI>Andy Pilkington is down with sun-stroke
<LI>Susie Jardine has suffered from a bad arm since the start and still has it in a sling.
</UL>

<B>Generator: -</B>		
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE><LI>We have had various problems with this 			but  overcome by using the main engine and transferring the water pump 	across to it.
</UL><P>



It is blisteringly hot during the day.  Below decks it is like a sauna because we are reaching across the South East Trade winds with water  coming green over the decks so not able to have any of the hatches open. That makes it very uncomfortable below and difficult to sleep.<P>


Conditions in the galley beggar belief. When things are in full swing, there is no health and safety at work here!<P>


The one bit of shade comes from the Heath battle flag which we have rigged up above the helmsman. <P>


At 2:00am yesterday,  we had to make a sail change which typified all that is good and bad about sailing in the tropics. With sea temperatures around 30 degrees C.  it was like standing under a salty car wash which was very refreshing.<BR>

The trouble then was that everyone had sodden clothing and wet deck shoes which, when taken below, just added to the dank air.<BR>

This stuffiness is exacerbated by problems with the toilet holding tank which has left the front end of the boat smelling like a French sewer!<P>



Still - Just a couple more days at sea and we will be washing the taste away with a few beers on Copocabana's Strip!<P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#EB0000">Life onboard continues to surprise and amuse - Day 23</FONT></H3><P>


<B>Report from Adrian Donovan - 22 October 1996</B><P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>



We have finally shaken off the shadow of <I>Ocean Rover</I> - this morning they are 8 miles astern - after racing within sight of each other for more than a week.  Now it is a case of catching <I>Motorola</I> - 27 miles ahead - over the final 750 miles to Rio.<P>



That is not impossible, especially if the calms that concertinaed the fleet off the Brazilian coast in the last British Steel Challenge, prevail again for the BT event. We have made a good start with a 221 mile run during the past 24 hours. - 3 more than <I>Motorola</I>!<p>


Life onboard continues to surprise and amuse us. We had an interesting supper time yesterday when it was discovered that the duty 'mother watch' hadn't cooked it.   They had been told it was a simple case of 'boiling  a bag' and had been despatched below decks to prepare the feast.  The next thing we heard was an almighty crash followed by a flood warning in the galley. Not only had they left the rice in its bag, but had lent on the gambled stove to see how things were going!<P>


We did get supper eventually, and it was worth the wait.<P>


Another first.  One watch-leader who shall remain nameless made it up on deck 'on time' for the first time yesterday.<P>


Another of our number who made us laugh went below decks to put his oilskins on when told that we were thinking about making a sail change.  Two hours later we found him sound asleep!<P>


It's a tough life out here!

<P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#EB0000">Set to cross the Equator- Day 18</FONT></H3><P>


<B>Report from Adrian Donovan - 17 October 1996</B><P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>


Adrian Donovan and his crew have emerged from the Doldrums in 8th place within the 14 strong BT Global Challenge Fleet at early this morning  were rushing at 8.7 knots neck-and-neck with Ocean Rover towards the Equator, some 200 miles to the South.<P>


The Heath Insured II crew is still sailing within sight of Ocean Rover and working hard to close the distance on Motorola and 3Com some 40 miles ahead,  after they managed to sneak through the Doldrums quicker.<P>


Heath  trails Group 4, the fleet leader by 247 miles, but with Rio still 1,500 miles away,  a lot can happen yet, particularly when the yachts close on the Brazilian coast where calms can often concertina the fleet.<P>


The pace has been so fast that race organisers have had to revise their estimated arrival time.  The first yachts could reach Rio as early as October 25 and latest computations  show that Heath Insured II  could finish on September 27 - 2 days ahead of schedule!

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#EB0000">We are climbing up!- Day 15</FONT></H3><P>


<B>Report from Adrian Donovan - 14 October 1996</B><P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>


"Great news. Yesterday we had climbed up to 6th place, having sailed stealthily passed Ocean Rover during the weekend.  We are still in sight of them and constantly trading places which is strange after sailing for long without anyone around.  Another mile is all that divides us from overtaking 5th placed Motorola. It's certainly close racing out here! Sadly, we lost a bit overnight and we are now back in 9th.<P>

We  are now in the Doldrums which is something of a roulette wheel that can  spin  the winds for or against us within minutes.
It is also very hot which is making it difficult to track down who is sleeping where when it comes to waking the next watch.  This morning one was found in the forward sail compartment, another on the foredeck and others were sprawled out where ever they can find a cool spot. Those settling on a spot on deck do so in the hope that we don't have to gybe and disturb them, but anything is better than  being in the sauna below decks.<P>



<B>One-armed bandit</B><BR>

<A HREF="crew_jardine.htm">Suzie Jardine</A> has been nick-named the 'One-armed bandit'  after injuring her arm early in the race when it was hit by a sheet. The injury is still giving her pain even after the care and attention given to it by our medic, <A HREF="crew_stewart.htm">Sally Stewart</A>, who has put the arm in a sling for 48 hours, hoping that the rest will help.<P>



<B>It's flying fish with everything</B><BR>

The fish are flying in all directions. Suzie managed to get one up her shorts yesterday while winching in a sheet and  Mike  Babcock was attacked by a school of them. He bravely fought them off, but it was a losing battle."

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#EB0000">Catching up with the leaders- Day 12</FONT></H3><P>


<B>Report from Adrian Donovan - 11 October 1996</B><P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

"Still rocking and rolling downwind, averaging more than 10 knots for quite long periods as we work to catch up with the leaders. 70 miles ahead of us.<P>

Everyone is avidly studying the weather charts to look for the clearest path through the Doldrums and across the Equator next  week. Judging by the 300 mile span that the fleet now has across the Atlantic,  some crews have very different views on the best route to take.<P>

We are presently in 9th place. 17 miles behind <I>3Com</I> in terms of distance to Rio, our first port of call,  but have opened up a 20 mile cushion over 11th placed '<I>Save the Children</I>'  as we head south well to the east of the Cape Verde Islands.<P>

On board, life now has a pattern to it as one watch - marked by a meal time - rolls into the next.  More importantly,  everyone now has their sealegs at last. When we look at the rolling seas around us, it is hard to remember that these same waves made us so sick just a week ago. <P>

Wildlife has also started to appear. We saw squid, flying fish and a school of dolphins last night.  <A HREF="crew_pilkington.htm">Andy Pilkington</A>,  has suggested that we should install a pet tank in the galley to collect the smaller species.  Not sure yet whether this is to spice up meal times or to provide some hard evidence for the daily environmental log we are keeping!"

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#EB0000">Rocking and rolling under spinnaker - Day 9</FONT></H3><P>


<B>Report from Adrian Donovan - 8 October 1996</B><P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>


"We  have been battling with 3Com ever since we gybed round Bertinga Island last Friday.  They have closed to within a mile of us and dropped back as far as 5 miles.  It is great to have another boat so close to pace ourselves against.<P>



We find it hard to believe that it is only a week ago that we were battling towards Ushant. Now we are rocking and rolling under spinnaker breaking one speed record after another. Our best is 16.5knots!<P>



The fleet has now split into two groups as we head towards the Canaries, but we sail on with confidence because Baldrick (alias  Adrian Whalley) has a cunning plan!<P>


At night we are sitting on deck in T-shirts discovering shooting stars and also found a squid that had jumped aboard. Too small unfortunately to divide between 14 people for breakfast."

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#EB0000">Problems beginning to sort themselves out - Day 8</FONT></H3><P>


<B>Report from Adrian Donovan - 7 October 1996</B><P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

"Sorry for the lack of news, but we have had more than our fair share of problems including seasickness. Indeed, those responsible for communications have been our most regular customers at Heath's sidedeck pizzeria!<P>

While conditions during this first week have been a far cry from what everyone expects to meet in the Southern Ocean, the experience has certainly put paid in most minds to any thoughts that this first leg is a 'cruise in company'.<P>


It was a full three days before all the crew could eat lunch - and retain it!<BR>

We have also had problems with the generator, both heads,  the electric bilge pump and lifejackets, but after our initial problems with the rigging bottle screws undoing themselves, we are now beginning to pull together as a team.<P>


This is reflected in our improving position. Having been dog last at one point when repairing our sails,  we see that we are in 11th position this morning just 4 miles behind 3Com and 5 behind Courtaulds having averaged 8.6 knots overnight - 2 knots more than the leaders!"<P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#EB0000">Early problems slowing us up - Day 3</FONT></H3><P>


<B>Report from Adrian Donovan - 2 September 1996</B><P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>"It has been a trying first 72 hours.<BR>

<A HREF="art_pics/start_heath1.jpg"><IMG SRC="art_pics/start_heath1.gif"ALIGN=left HEIGHT=101 WIDTH=144 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=7 BORDER=1></A>

First we suffered some damage to <I>Heath</I>'s mainsail during our initial night at sea and had to spend far too long reefed down while Julia  and  John van der Hoff worked in the darkness standing on a wildly pitching deck to stitch it together again.<P>

Our second worry has been the nuts locking the bottlescrews that tension the rigging.  The screw holding the starboard lower shroud began to undo itself even before we had left the Solent  By the time we had cleared the Needles and on port tack, the thread was almost out of the barrel. We tightened it up hard to prevent movement, but that merely put a large bow in the mast when we went back on to starboard tack. We are now having to monitor each bottle screw in turn to check that others do not come undone.<P>

Together , these problems have slowed us considerably, though now we are beginning to fight back, having pulled up two places overnight.<P>

<A HREF="art_pics/start_heath_g4.jpg"><IMG SRC="art_pics/start_heath_g4.gif"ALIGN=RIGHT HEIGHT=91 WIDTH=144 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=7 BORDER=1></A>
<B>What a start!</B><BR>
Looking back to last Sunday, it was fantastic to see so many well-wishers and supporter boats out in such atrocious conditions. All we can say is thank you to everyone for making the effort to come and see us off.<P>

Conditions became much, much worse once we were outside the Solent which led to a lot of seasickness and a lot of extra work for those still on their feet as we changed down from one headsail to another.<P>

The following day saw us reaching hard under full mainsail and spinnaker at up to 10 knots and the crew who could  not hold down their stomachs, were looking forward to the Portuguese Trade Winds."<P>

<TD>
<BR><BR>
When a yacht or motor boat is offered for insurance on the Zephyr policy, the proposal form that the owner completes should contain all the information that the underwriter needs to make a decision on first whether to insure the craft at all, and then how much premium to charge.
<P>
Many factors come into the equation, but the four main considerations are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> The owner
<LI> The cruising range and location of the vessel
<LI> The type of boat
<LI> The age of the craft
</UL>

<P>
<B>The owner</B> is the most important factor, and there is no doubt that most claims that occur on yacht policies are caused by human error. This is obvious when thinking of accidents such as collisions and groundings, but it is equallly true when it comes to thefts and fires, two other major causes of losses. All too often, boats are left unsecured and open to thieves, and fires are usually started by the carelessness of someone on board.
<P>
So first and foremost the experience and claims record of the owner is studied. The experience shows the underwriter whether the sailing cover requested is within the ablities of the proposer, and by the claims record shows whether the owner is someone who takes good care of his craft.
<P>
<B>The cruising range</B> is considered closely for two reasons, first so that the underwriter is confident that both the owner and boat are capable of crusing in the area required, and second, so that the assured is only asked to pay for the area in which the boat will be used. All to often owners ask (and pay) to sail in vast areas of the world when all they really want to do is cruise in local waters.
<P>
<B>Location</B> is also important. If there is a problem with the vessel both the underwriter and the owner need to find repair yards and suppliers and surveyors who are readily available, so the problem can be solved easily and quickly with the minimum interruption to the sailing programme.
<P>
<B>The type of craft</B> is also a factor, and owners may find some types more difficult to insure on than others, such as racing boats and very fast speed boats. Underwriters may and do have their own personal likes and dislikes where types of craft are concerned, and these are usually based on experience of the vessel in the past ,or on infomation gathered form contacts in the yachting world.
<P>
<B>The age of the vessel </B> is also considered, for two reasons. To start with, it is often difficult to repair older boats, and therefore more expensive: parts are harder to find and may have to be made at extra cost. The second reason is that sometimes boats do suffer breakdowns and accidents just because they are old and tired.
<P>
<B>The unusual risk of course can still be insured</B> and underwriters have to be flexible and consider each risk on its merits. For this reason Hiscox and the <A HREF="http://hiscox.co.uk/insurance/"><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#FF00FF">Zephyr Policy</FONT></A> are delighted to be the insurers of all the yachts taking part in the BT 1996 Global Challenge, and we consider this is a risk which fits all our requirements. The yachts are well-made and extremely strong, they are skippered by people who have years of experience in ocean racing and although many of the crew are new to round the world sailing, they have all undergone a very tough and demanding training schedule during the past two years.
<P>
To encourage yachtsmen and women to improve their sailing skills, Hiscox have sponsored a training video to help attain the recognised RYA Yachtmasters Certificate, and holders of this certificate should find insurance easier to obtain. If you would like further details of this video please <A HREF="MAILTO:enquiry@hiscox.co.uk">e-mail Dave Garrett </A>or contact him at Hiscox on 0171-423-4000.</TD>

<A HREF="art_pic1/gutsy2.jpg"><IMG SRC="art_pic1/gutsy2.gif"ALIGN=RIGHT HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=93 VSPACE=9 HSPACE=9 BORDER=1></A>
This is actually the third circumnavigation for Heath Insured's  popular mascot Gutsy the Gorilla.<P>

He first wore the Heath colours during the 92/93 British Steel Challenge when, under skipper Adrian Donovan, Heath came 7th.<P>

The second time Gutsy went around 'westabouts' was last year when he kept <A HREF="http://wire.co.uk/ppl/sam">Sam Brewster</A> company during her solo circumnavigation which lasted  253 days, 1hour, 22 minutes and 35 seconds. Gutsy's biggest problem was the lack of fresh bananas, but he enjoyed the adventure all the same.<P>

Now Gutsy is spurring on the Heath crew on his third circumnavigation, which must surely be a record for a gorilla!

<A HREF="art_pics/c_jardine.jpg"><IMG SRC="art_pics/c_jardine.gif"ALIGN=RIGHT HEIGHT=108 WIDTH=71 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5 BORDER=1></A>
Susie Jardine comes from a sailing family and her experience is invaluable to <I>Heath Insured II's</I> novice sailors. Throughout the build up the start of the BT Global Challenge, Susie has been actively involved in coaching both in the cockpit and on the foredeck. Her enthusiasm has been rewarded by skipper Adrian Donovan who has made her one of three watch leaders.<P>
<A HREF="art_pics/c_jard1.jpg"><IMG SRC="art_pics/c_jard1.gif"ALIGN=LEFT HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=114 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=7 BORDER=1></A>
The 44 year old housewife from Aylesbury, will act as bosun in charge of deck gear maintenance, as well as looking after safety on board with John Van Der Hoff. Undoubtedly, her most important role is that of watch leader, this covers a number of vital tasks including weather forecasting, navigation and race tactics.<P>

Susie has two sons and two daughters who will be monitoring their mother's progress avidly from home. 

<BLOCKQUOTE>"The BT Global Challenge must be the ultimate opportunity for adventure and personal achievement but this is only part of the story. There is the race itself, where the skill and determination of the crew will be the only and final judge. The thrill of the chase, squeezing every last ounce from the yacht in a bid to motivate and encourage your fellow crew members and to collect first line honours must surely make this one of the world's greatest adventures. The adventure promises to deliver a cocktail of emotions and experiences beyond one's wildest imagination which will enrich my life and the lives of all those involved. Just thinking about it makes the stomach knot and the pulse rate rise.   Simply, there are things in life we just want to do - the desire is all consuming."</BLOCKQUOTE>

</b><h1>New Patient Bill of Rights Debuts<i></h1>
</i><p>

	Things just aren't like they were 10 years
ago. Any office without a computer is
obsolete, interest rates are down and there's
a coffeehouse on every corner. Everything
changes over time and hopefully it gets
better.<p>

	The practice of dentistry has certainly
seen some changes -- the most significant
ones dealing with dentist-patient
relationships, dental benefit coverage and
practice techniques. <p>

	Like anything else that's a decade old,
CDA's Dental Patient Bill of Right was due
for an upgrade. While the original patient
rights are still applicable, there are some
significant issues that affect you and your
patients that didn't exist in 1987.<p>

	The health care evolution has put a
spotlight on certain issues. One is a patient's
ability to make an appointment with your
office within a reasonable amount of time.
Appointments three weeks out for an
emergency do not work. And having to wait
three to four months for a prophy and exam
is a bit unreasonable, to say the least.
Patients have the right to schedule an
appointment in a timely manner.<p>

	If a patient has dental coverage, it's also
his or her right to have all treatment options
explained regardless of coverage or cost.
This means that you should explain all
options, regardless of what the insurance
plan will pay for. Not only does the patient
have the right to be given the pros, cons and
costs of each option, but you have the right
to tell them. All patients should be making
informed decisions as to what is the best
treatment is for them, not what's best for
their insurance company's bottom-line.<p>

	It's hard to believe, but 10 years ago
infection controls such as gloves and masks
were just beginning to be used. It seems like
we've been using them for years. And now
there's more -- plastic on the light handles,
jackets for the headrests, disposable
instruments, etc. These things signify to
patients that you are doing everything
possible to make their visit safe. The original
right stated that patients have "the right to
expect dental team members to use
appropriate infection controls such as
gloves." It's been revised to cover every
angle -- "appropriate infection and
sterilization controls." <p>

	Dentistry has come a long way in just 10
years. The new and improved bill of rights
makes a statement to all California patients
as they pursue quality dental care: CDA
members continue to uphold the rights of
their patients, value the dentist-patient
relationship and be in continual pursuit of
excellence.<p>

<title>Dental Health Facts - Sealants</title>
<body bgcolor="#ddeeff">
<img src="cdafacts.gif"align=left hspace=10>
<center>
<h1>Dental Health Fact Sheet</h1>
<br clear=all>

<hr>
<h2>SEALANTS</h2>
</center>


With the help of your dentist, preventing tooth decay can become even easier.  You may already be aware that daily 
brushing and flossing are the most important weapons against the formation of plaque, the primary cause of cavities.  
To supplement your regular routine of brushing and flossing, your dentist can apply a coat of plastic material -- called a 
sealant -- on the top, or biting, surfaces of your teeth.  This plastic coating creates a barrier between your teeth and the 
decay-causing bacteria that live in plaque.<P>

<B>	WHAT IS PLAQUE AND WHY DOES IT CAUSE CAVITIES?</B><P>

As you or your children eat and drink during the day, the food in your mouth combines with bacteria to produce a 
sticky film called plaque that attaches on and in between tooth surfaces (tooth enamel).  Plaque often is found on the 
chewing surfaces of the back teeth, from which it is difficult to remove by brushing and flossing alone.  If plaque is not 
removed regularly from your teeth, it can produce acids which will attack the tooth enamel and create pits or holes 
(cavities) in the tooth.  This is tooth decay.<P>

<B>	HOW CAN SEALANTS HELP PREVENT CAVITIES?</B><P>

Coating your teeth with a slippery plastic material makes it harder for plaque to stick to the tiny grooves on the biting 
surfaces of the teeth - reducing the risk of forming cavities and tooth decay.<P>

<B>	IS IT DIFFICULT TO APPLY SEALANTS?</B><P>

No.  Your dentist may use a special instrument to apply the plastic sealant on your teeth.  Most often, it is a painless 
treatment that lasts for many months.<P>

<B>	WHO SHOULD GET SEALANTS?</B><P>

Sealants are most effective in reducing cavities in children with newly formed permanent teeth.  They are useful in 
cutting down formation of decay in adult teeth, as well.  An application of sealants is a preventive measure to keep teeth 
healthy.  It is an effective way to reduce the need for fillings and more expensive treatment that may be required to 
repair the damage from cavities, so sealants can also save you money.<P>

Ask your CDA dentist whether sealants would be an appropriate treatment for you and your children.<P>

<title>Dental Health Facts - Baby Bottle Tooth Decay</title>
<body bgcolor="#ddeeff">
<img src="cdafacts.gif"align=left hspace=10>
<center>
<h1>Dental Health Fact Sheet</h1>
<br clear=all>

<hr>

<h2>	BABY BOTTLE TOOTH DECAY</h2>
</center>

Baby bottle tooth decay is a dental condition that can destroy the teeth of an infant or young child.  The upper front 
teeth are the most susceptible to damage, but other teeth also may be affected.<P>

<B>	WHAT CAUSES BABY BOTTLE TOOTH DECAY?</B><P>

Baby bottle tooth decay is caused by the frequent and long-term exposure of a child's teeth to liquids containing 
sugars.  Among these liquids are milk, formula, fruit juice, sodas, and other sweetened drinks.  The sugars in these 
liquids pool around the infant's teeth and gums, feeding the bacteria that cause plaque.  Every time your child 
consumes a sugary liquid, acid attacks his/her teeth.  After numerous attacks, tooth decay can occur, resulting in 
baby bottle tooth decay.<P>

Parents and care givers should be especially concerned with giving an infant a sugary drink at nap or night time.  
During sleep, the flow of saliva decreases, allowing the sugary liquids to pool around the child's teeth for an 
extended period of time.<P>

<B>	HOW TO PREVENT BABY BOTTLE TOOTH DECAY</B><P>

Parents sometimes do not realize that baby's teeth are susceptible to decay as soon as they appear in the infant's 
mouth. By the time the decay is noticed, it may be too late to save the child's teeth. You can prevent this from 
happening to your child's teeth by knowing how to protect them.<P>
<ul>
	<li>	After each feeding wipe the child's teeth and gums with a damp washcloth or small soft 
toothbrush to remove plaque. Begin brushing your child's teeth as soon as the first tooth erupts. 
Flossing should begin when all primary teeth have erupted, usually by age 2 or 2 1/2.
	<li>	Never allow your child to fall asleep with a bottle containing a sweetened liquid.
	<li>	If your child refuses to fall asleep without a bottle, simply fill it with water and nothing else.
	<li>	If your local water supply does not contain enough decay-fighting fluoride, check with your CDA 
dentist to see if your child should receive fluoride supplements.
	<li>	Start dental visits between six and twelve months of age.
</ul>

<B>	HOW SERIOUS IS BABY BOTTLE TOOTH DECAY?</B><P>

Baby bottle tooth decay can cause painful toothaches which can hinder eating. Severely decayed teeth can become 
infected and need to be extracted. If your child's teeth are infected or lost too early due to baby bottle tooth decay, 
your child may have some of these problems:<P>
<ul>
<li>	Poor eating habits
<li>	Speech problems
<li>	Crooked teeth
<li>	Damaged adult (permanent) teeth
<li>	Yellow or brown adult (permanent) teeth
</ul>
Keep your child happy and smiling by preventing baby bottle tooth decay.<P>

<title>Dental Health Facts - Clean Teeth & Gums</title>
<body bgcolor="#ddeeff">
<img src="cdafacts.gif"align=left hspace=10>
<center>
<h1>Dental Health Fact Sheet</h1>
<br clear=all>

<hr>


<h2>	CLEAN TEETH AND GUMS</h2>
</center>

Having a clean mouth is important.  In addition to being healthier, it gives you fresh breath and a nicer smile.<P>

When you eat, bits of food, some too small for you to see, remain in your mouth.  They feed bacteria that grow in a 
sticky film on your teeth.  This film, called plaque, is the main cause of tooth decay and gum disease.<P>

<B>	WHY BRUSH?</B><P>

Brushing your teeth after meals and between-meal snacks not only gets rid of the food particles that you can see, it 
removes plaque from your teeth.  Using a fluoride toothpaste is important because the fluoride can help kill 
bacteria, as well as make your teeth stronger.<P>

Ask your dentist to recommend the best toothbrush for you.  Generally, a brush with soft, end-rounded or polished 
bristles is less likely to injure gum tissue.  The size and shape of the brush should allow you to reach every tooth.  
Children may need smaller brushes than those designed for adults.  Remember: worn-out toothbrushes can not 
properly clean your teeth and may injure your gums.  Toothbrushes should be replaced every three or four 
months.<P>

<B>	WHY FLOSS?</B><P>

Flossing removes plaque and food particles from between teeth and under the gumline, areas your toothbrush can 
not reach.  Because tooth decay and periodontal disease often start in these areas, it is important to clean them 
thoroughly on a daily basis.<P>

Flossing is a skill that needs to be learned.  Do not be discouraged if you find it difficult at first.  With practice, you 
will find that flossing takes only a few minutes of your time each day.<P>

<B>	WHAT ABOUT MOUTHRINSES AND MOUTHWASHES?</B><P>

If used as directed, in addition to brushing and flossing, mouthrinses and mouthwashes can help to prevent tooth 
decay.<P>

<B>	HOW OFTEN SHOULD I SEE MY DENTIST?</B><P>

If possible, you should visit your dentist every six months for a preventive check and cleaning.  Infants should see a 
dentist at about 12 months of age.  <P>

<title>Dental Health Facts - Diet and Dental Health</title>

<h2>	DIET AND DENTAL HEALTH</h2>
</center>


You know that what you eat can make a difference in the way you feel and perform.  That is why you should try to 
choose foods that will help your body stay strong and healthy.  But did you know that your choice of foods and your 
eating patterns also may affect your dental health?<P>

<B>	HOW DOES DIET AFFECT DENTAL HEALTH?</B><P>

If your diet is low in certain nutrients, it may be harder for the tissues of your mouth to resist infection.  This may 
be a contributing factor to periodontal (gum) disease, the main cause of tooth loss in adults.  Although poor 
nutrition does not actually cause periodontal disease, many researchers believe that the disease progresses faster 
and is more severe in patients whose diet does not supply the necessary nutrients.<P>

To make sure that you are getting enough nutrients for good general and oral health, you should choose foods from 
the four basic food groups: fruits and vegetables, breads and cereals, milk and dairy products, and meat, fish and 
eggs.  When you do snack, avoid soft, sweet, sticky foods, such as cakes, candy and dried fruits, that cling to your 
teeth and promote tooth decay.  Instead, choose dentally healthy foods such as nuts, raw vegetables, plain yogurt, 
cheese, popcorn and sugarless gum or candy.  To have a diet that promotes dental health, you must develop 
sensible eating habits.   <P>
<B>	HOW CAN I GET ENOUGH FLUORIDE?</B><P>

If you and your family have a balanced diet, you will get all the nutrients you need for good dental health, with one 
possible exception - fluoride.  Fluoride is vital for strong, decay-resistant teeth.  If there is not enough fluoride in 
your community water supply, the level of fluoride can be adjusted to the right amount for good dental health 
(about one part fluoride per million parts water).  If your drinking water is not fluoridated, ask your dentist how 
you can get the fluoride you need.<P>

Fluoride toothpastes and mouthrinses that carry the seal of the American Dental Association's Council on Dental 
Therapeutics have been proven effective in helping prevent dental decay.  However, they do not contribute to your 
dietary fluoride.<P>

Together, a balanced diet, daily use of fluoride, brushing and flossing, and sensible eating habits, can reduce the 
risk of or even prevent dental disease.<P>

<title>Dental Health Facts - Smokeless Tobacco</title>
<body bgcolor="#ddeeff">
<img src="cdafacts.gif"align=left hspace=10>
<center>
<h1>Dental Health Fact Sheet</h1>
<br clear=all>

<hr>


<h2>	IF YOU CHEW, QUIT</h2>

</center>
Smokeless tobacco use in the United States continues to increase each year.  It may be smokeless, but it isn't 
harmless.  Why should you care?  Keep reading.<P>

<B>	SMOKELESS TOBACCO</B><P>

<B>TOOTH ABRASION</B> - Grit and sand in smokeless tobacco products scratches teeth and wears away the 
hard surface or enamel.  Premature loss of tooth enamel can cause added sensitivity and may require corrective 
treatment.<P>

<B>GUM RECESSION</B> - Constant irritation to the spot in the mouth where a small wad of chewing tobacco 
is placed can result in permanent damage to periodontal tissue.  It also can damage the supporting bone structure.  
The injured gums pull away from the teeth, exposing root surfaces and leaving teeth sensitive to heat and cold.  
Erosion of critical bone support leads to loosened teeth that can be permanently lost.<P>

<B>INCREASED TOOTH DECAY</B> - Sugar is added to smokeless tobacco during the curing and 
processing to improve its taste.  The sugar reacts with bacteria found naturally in the mouth, causing an acid 
reaction, which leads to decay.<P>

<B>TOOTH DISCOLORATION AND BAD BREATH</B> - Common traits of long-term smokeless tobacco 
users are stained teeth and bad breath.  Moreover, the habit of continually spitting can be both unsightly and 
offensive.<P>

<B>NICOTINE DEPENDENCE</B> - Nicotine blood levels achieved by smokeless tobacco use are similar to 
those from cigarette smoking.  Nicotine addiction can lead to an artificially increased heart rate and blood pressure. 
 In addition, it can constrict the blood vessels that are necessary to carry oxygen-rich blood throughout the body.  
Athletic performance and endurance levels are decreased by this reaction.<P>

<B>UNHEALTHY EATING HABITS</B> - Chewing tobacco lessens a person's sense of taste and ability to 
smell.  As a result, users tend to eat more salty and sweet foods, both of which are harmful if consumed in 
excess.<P>

<B>ORAL CANCER</B> - With the practice of "chewing" and "dipping," tobacco and its irritating juices are 
left in contact with gums, cheeks and/or lips for prolonged periods of time.  This can result in a condition called 
leukoplakia.  Leukoplakia appears either as a smooth, white patch or as leathery-looking wrinkled skin.  It results 
in cancer in 3 percent to 5 percent of all cases.<P>

<B>OTHER CANCERS</B> - All forms of smokeless tobacco contain high concentrations of cancer-causing 
agents.  These substances subject users to increased cancer risk not only of the oral cavity, but also the pharynx, 
larynx and esophagus.<P>

<B>DANGER SIGNS</B> - If you use smokeless tobacco, or have in the past, you should be on the lookout for 
some of these early signs of oral cancer:<P>
<ul>
<li>	A sore that does not heal
<li>	A lump or white patch
<li>	A prolonged sore throat
<li>	Difficulty in chewing
<li>	Restricted movement of the tongue or jaws
<li>	A feeling of something in the throat
</ul>

Pain is rarely an early symptom.  For this reason, all tobacco users need regular dental check-ups.<P>

<title>Dental Health Facts - Mouth Guards</title>
<body bgcolor="#ddeeff">
<img src="cdafacts.gif"align=left hspace=10>
<center>
<h1>Dental Health Fact Sheet</h1>
<br clear=all>

<hr>


<h2>	MOUTH GUARDS</h2>
</center>
Don't be the victim of a preventable injury: wear a mouth guard.  While mouth guards are not mandatory 
equipment in all sports, their worth is indisputable.  Dentists see many oral and facial injuries that might have been 
prevented by the use of a mouth guard.<P>

Facial injuries in nearly every sport can result in damage to teeth, lips, cheeks and tongue.  Mouth guards cushion 
blows to the face and neck.  A mouth guard should be part of every athlete's gear, no matter the sport.  It's better to 
play it safe than face a devastating and painful oral injury.<P>

Even adults are not free from the dangers of mouth injuries.  Dentists treat many trauma injuries in weekend 
athletes.  Whatever your age or sport, mouth guards are an important part of sports safety and your exercise 
routine.  Do what you can to protect your smile and preserve your health.<P>

<B>	DOS AND DON'TS</B><P>
<ul>

<li>	Do wear a mouth guard at all times when playing sports.
<li>	Do inform yourself about the most common oral injuries.
<li>	Do wear a mouth guard custom-fitted by your dentist, especially if you wear fixed dental 
appliances such as braces or bridgework.
<li>	Do not wear removable appliances (retainers, bridge, or complete or partial dentures) when 
playing sports.
</ul>

<B>	WHAT ARE YOUR CHOICES</B><P>

There are three types of mouth guards:  custom-made, mouth-formed and ready-made.  Custom-made mouth 
guards are professionally designed by your dentist from a cast model of your teeth.  Because they are designed to 
cover all back teeth and cushion the entire jaw, they can prevent concussions caused by blows to the chin.  Custom 
guards may be slightly more expensive than commercially produced mouthpieces, but they offer the best possible fit 
and protection.  They are more secure in the mouth and do not interfere with speech or breathing.  Calling plays or 
formations, for instance, will not be impeded by custom guards.<P>

Mouth-formed guards, also called "boil and bite," should also be fitted by your dentist.  This is generally done by 
shaping a soft pre-formed guard to the contours of the teeth and allowing it to harden.  However, these devices are 
difficult to design for athletes who wear braces and can become brittle after prolonged use.<P>

Ready-made, commercial mouth guards can be purchased at most sporting goods stores and are made of rubber or 
polyvinyl.  They are the least expensive but also the least effective.<P>

Keep your mouth guard in top shape by rinsing it with water or mouthwash after each use and allowing it to air-dry.  With proper care, it should last the length of a season or longer.<P>

<title>Dental Health Facts - Dental Emergencies</title>
<body bgcolor="#ddeeff">
<img src="cdafacts.gif"align=left hspace=10>
<center>
<h1>Dental Health Fact Sheet</h1>
<br clear=all>

<hr>


<h2>	DENTAL EMERGENCIES</h2>
</center>

Injuries to the mouth may include teeth that are knocked out (evulsed), forced out of position (extruded) or broken 
(fractured).  Sometimes lips, gums or cheeks have cuts.  Oral injuries are often painful, and should be treated by a 
dentist as soon as possible.<P>

<B>	EVULSED TEETH</B><P>

When a tooth is knocked out you should:<P>
<ul>
<li>	Immediately call your dentist for an emergency appointment.
<li>	Attempt to find the tooth.
<li>	Gently rinse, but do not scrub the tooth to remove dirt or debris.  
<li>	Place the clean tooth in your mouth between the cheek and gum.
<li>	Do not attempt to replace the tooth into the socket. This could cause further damage.
<li>	Get to the dentist as soon as possible. If it is within a half hour of the injury, it may be possible to 
reimplant the tooth.
<li>	If it is not possible to store the tooth in the mouth of the injured person, (e.g., young child) wrap the tooth 
in a clean cloth or gauze and immerse in milk.
</ul>
<B>	EXTRUDED TEETH</B><P>

If the tooth is pushed out of place (inward or outward), it should be repositioned to its normal alignment with very 
light finger pressure.  Do not force the tooth into the socket.  Hold the tooth in place with a moist tissue or gauze.  
Again, it is vital that the injured individual be seen by a dentist within 30 minutes.<P>

<B>	FRACTURED TEETH</B><P>

How a fractured tooth is treated will depend on how badly it is broken.  Regardless of the damage, treatment should 
always be determined by a dentist.<P>

<B>MINOR FRACTURE</B> - Minor fractures can be smoothed by your dentist with a sandpaper disc or 
simply left alone. Another option is to restore the tooth with a composite restoration. In either case, you should 
treat the tooth with care for several days.<P>

<B>MODERATE FRACTURE</B> - Moderate fractures include damage to the enamel, dentin and/or pulp. If 
the pulp is not permanently damaged, the tooth may be restored with a full permanent crown. If pulpal damage 
does occur further dental treatment will be required.<P>

<B>SEVERE FRACTURE</B> - Severe fractures often mean a traumatized tooth with a slim chance of 
recovery.  <P>

<B>	INJURIES TO THE SOFT TISSUES OF THE MOUTH</B><P>

Injuries to the inside of the mouth include tears, puncture wounds and lacerations to the cheek, lips or tongue.  The 
wound should be cleaned right away and the injured person taken to the emergency room for the necessary suturing 
and wound repair.<P>

Bleeding from a tongue laceration can be reduced by pulling the tongue forward and using gauze to place pressure 
on the wound area.<P>

<TITLE>Senior-Dent</TITLE>
<center>
<H1>Senior-Dent</H1>
<H3>A Special Program For Eligible Seniors<P></H3>
<H4>Sponsored by California Dental Association	<P></H4>
</center>
The California  Dental Association in 1979 established Senior-Dent, a program offering reduced dental fees to all qualified senior citizens. <P>

<STRONG>To qualify, seniors need only meet three eligibility requirements.</STRONG> <P>

<DL>
<DD>
They must:<P>

Be 60 years of age or over. <P>
Have an annual household income of $16,000 or less. <P>
Not be receiving dental benefits from Denti-Cal (the state welfare program for dentistry) or a dental insurance plan.<P>
</DL>
Thousands of licensed California dentists who are members of California Dental Association offer the Senior-Dent program. Their offices are located throughout the state, in both rural and urban areas.<P>
To find a Senior-Dent dentist in your neighborhood, simply call your local dental society (listed in the Yellow Pages under <I>Dentist Information Bureaus</I>) or dial California Dental Association's toll-free hotline (1-800-736-7071) where trained personnel are standing by to give you the telephone number of your local dental society.<P>
Your local dental society will give you names of participating dentists in your neighborhood. (If you'd prefer to visit  the office of a bilingual dentist, just let the dental society know.) From the list of names you'll receive, select a dentist and call that office for an appointment. <P>
Participating dentists offer a discount from their usual fees for all dental services. This includes examinations, cleaning and all other dental procedures. Financial arrangements, including the amount of reduction and financial terms, are handled privately between the patient and dentist.<P>
Eligible seniors are encouraged to take advantage of the Senior-Dent program for regular preventive care. Regular examinations and preventative care are necessary for individuals who already have dentures, as well as for those with some or all of their natural teeth. It's the best way to make sure your teeth and gums stay healthy and to prevent potential dental health problems from developing.<P>
<HR>
<center>To find a dentist, Call Your Local Dental Society (Listed in the YellowPages under Dentist Information Bureaus) or 1-800-736-7071, Extension 4220</center><P>

<TITLE>Peer Review Program</TITLE>
<H1>Peer Review Program</H1>

The California Dental Association and its 32 component dental societies, in keeping with their obligation of 
service to the public, have established a statewide peer review system. The purpose of the peer review system is to 
resolve disputes that may arise in the delivery of dental services to the public; in particular, disputes regarding the 
quality and/or appropriateness of dental treatment, utilization (problems related to dental insurance benefits when 
treatment is questioned), and/or potentially irregular billing practices.<P>

A peer review committee, comprised of CDA member-dentist volunteers, evaluates all available evidence 
pertaining to each dispute and follows specific procedures (listed below) to make a fair and impartial 
determination. The parties involved are then notified of a committees decision by a letter of resolution. If any 
party to a review can factually demonstrate that a procedural error may have occurred, or that the decision was not 
based on available facts, an appeal to the Council on Peer Review may be requested. This appeal must be mailed 
within 30 days of the date the letter of resolution is sent. Any decision of an appeal panel is final and binding.<P>


<H3>PEER REVIEW PRODCEDURES</H3>

All disputes that are evaluated within the peer review system must include the following procedures:<P>

<DL>

<LI>The responsibility for conducting a review will be that of the local component dental society of which the dentist is 
a member.<BR>


<LI>The patient must sign a Patient Agreement Form prior to review. (The dentist, by virtue of membership in CDA, 
has already agreed to be bound by a peer review decision.)<BR>


<LI>A Record Release Form must be signed by the patient so that a review committee may legally obtain a patients 
records.<BR>

<LI>Unless the treatment in question cannot be evaluated (i.e., treatment has been redone), the patient will be examined 
by a panel of at least three dentists.<BR>


<LI>The patient will be given an opportunity to present any additional comments, usually at the time of the patient 
examination.<BR>


<LI>The dentist must be invited to meet with the review committee if he/she chooses.<BR>


<LI>All other involved parties (second treating dentists, insuring entities) will be contacted for whatever 
additional evidence is available.<BR>

<LI>The peer review committee will evaluate all evidence available (patient examination, radiographs, 
statements from other treating dentists, etc.), and make a final determination. This will be communicated to 
all involved parties in the form of a letter of resolution which will provide adequate rationale for the 
decision.<BR>

<LI>All involved parties will be provided Appeal Criteria at the time the letter of resolution is provided<P>
</UL>
Although the peer review system can satisfactorily resolve the majority of complaints received, there are limitations 
which may make a complaint inappropriate for the system. <STRONG>The following types of complaints are 
NOT within the purview of peer review system:</STRONG><P>

<H4>Cases which do not meet "time" criteria </H4>

	 Excessive passage of time alters clinical conditions. Therefore, a complaint will not be reviewed if it is 
received more than three years from the date treatment was completed, or more than one year from the date the 
complainant became aware of the problem.<P>
<H4>Cases in litigation </H4>

	 The peer review system is designed to resolve patient/dentist disputes. Consequently, no matter will be 
accepted for peer review if either party has initiated litigation concerning any aspect of the dental services which 
might otherwise be directed to review.<P>

<H4>Cases petitioning for monetary awards  </H4>

	 Requests for reimbursement for time lost from work, pain and suffering, mileage and medical expenses 
cannot be accepted in the peer review system as it is not a punitive system, but rather an evaluative one.<P>

<H4>Cases about fees  </H4>

	 A peer review committee may not comment on a dentists fees. To do so may be construed as price 
fixing.<P>

<H4>Cases not related to treatment </H4>

	  Questions concerning matters other than dental treatment (e.g., a dentists attitude, communications 
problems, etc.) are outside the purview of the peer review system.<P>

<H4>   Preface</H4>
   This report, "Public Health Service Report on Fluoride Benefits and Risks" is a summary of the findings,   
conclusions, and recommendations of <I>Review of Fluoride Benefits and Risks: Report of the Ad Hoc   
Subcommittee on Fluoride of the Committee to Coordinate Environmental Health and Related Programs,   
</I>published in February 1991.  The full report was prepared by an ad hoc subcommittee of the United  
States  Public Health Service's Committee to Coordinate Environmental Health and Related Programs  
(CCEHRP) at the request of the Assistant Secretary for Health.  The full report can be obtained from the  
Public Health Service, Department of Health and Human Services.<P>
   <B>  Public Health Service Report on Fluoride Benefits and Risks</B><P>
   <B>BACKGROUND</B><P>
   In the early part of this century, researchers observed that persons with "mottled teeth," or dental  
fluorosis, experienced fewer dental caries than persons without that pattern of tooth discoloration.   
Naturally occurring fluoride in the drinking water was identified later as being responsible for this effect  
on tooth enamel.  Community studies conducted in the 1940s established that as the level of natural  
fluoride in the drinking water increased, the prevalence of dental caries declined.  These studies led to the  
public health practice of adjusting fluoride concentration levels in fluoride-deficient drinking water  
supplies to bring the total level of fluoride to approximately 1 part per million (PPM).  The optimal range  
of community water fluoridation (optimal with respect to reducing dental caries and minimizing the risk  
of dental fluorosis) has been determined previously by the United States Public Health Service to be 0.7- 
1.2 ppm.<P>
   Controversy over the purported adverse health effects of fluoride has been associated with community  
water fluoridation programs since widespread implementation began in the 1950s.  This controversy is  
related in part to evidence that exposure to fluoride in sufficiently high doses can produce toxicity in  
animals and humans.  In the 1970s, a limited number of studies reported increased cancer mortality in  
cities with adjusted water fluoridation relative to cities without adjusted water fluoridation programs.   
Although this claim subsequently was refuted by numerous investigators, the concern over a possible  
association between cancer and water fluoridation prompted the National Toxicology Program (NTP) of  
the United States Public Health Service (PHS) to conduct a long-term study of the toxicity and  
carcinogenicity of sodium fluoride exposure in rodents.  This study employed a standard rat and mouse  
bioassay that has been useful in evaluating the potential carcinogenicity or toxicity of numerous  
chemicals.<P>
   In the spring of 1990, NTP released the findings of its fluoride study.  Although the study found no  
evidence of carcinogenicity in female rats or in mice of either sex, it did find "equivocal evidence" of  
carcinogenicity based on a small number of osteosarcomas in male rats in the medium and high-dosed  
exposure groups.  The term "equivocal evidence" is one of five standardized categories used by NTP to  
describe the strength of evidence of carcinogenicity of individual experiments.  The category "equivocal  
evidence" is used to describe the results of studies in which an association between administration of a  
chemical and a particular tumor response is uncertain.<P>
   <B>ASSESSMENT OF THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF FLUORIDE</B><P>
   The PHS report concluded that fluoride has substantial benefits in the prevention of dental caries.   
Numerous studies have established a clear causal relation between use of fluoridated water and the  
prevention of dental caries.  Although the occurrence of caries can be reduced through the use of  
fluoridated toothpaste and mouth rinses, professional fluoride treatment, and fluoride dietary supplements,  
fluoridation of water is the most cost-effective method and provides the greatest benefit to those who can  
least afford preventive and restorative dentistry.  In the 1940s, children in communities with fluoridated  
drinking water experienced reductions in caries experience (as measured by decayed, missing, and filled  
tooth scores) of about 60% relative to those for persons living in nonfluoridated* communities.  Although  
studies conducted in the 1980s continued to demonstrate that caries scores are lower in fluoridated areas,  
studies show that the differences in caries scores between fluoridated and nonfluoridated areas have  
declined to 20%-40%.  This apparent change may reflect the presence and use--in nonfluoridated areas--of  
fluoride in beverages, food, dental products, and dietary supplements.<P>
   <B>ASSESSMENT OF THE HEALTH RISKS OF FLUORIDE</B><P>
   The PHS Subcommittee undertook a comprehensive review of the possible association between fluoride  
exposure and carious adverse health outcomes.  The report concluded that there is a lack of evidence of  
associations between levels of fluoride in water and birth defects or problems of the gastrointestinal,  
genito-urinary, and respiratory systems.  Three possible health effects-cancer, effects on bone, and dental  
fluorosis-were addressed in greater detail.<P>
   <B>Cancer</B><P>
   The two approaches used to determine whether there is an association between exposure to fluoridated  
water and cancer are: a) carcinogenicity studies of rodents and b) epidemiologic analyses to compare  
cancer incidence and mortality rates in communities with fluoridated water and in those with negligible  
levels of fluoride in drinking water.<P>
   <B>Animal Studies</B><P>
   The NTP study found that rates of osteosarcomas rose as the dose of sodium fluoride exposure for male  
rates increased, but not for female rats or for mice of either gender.  These findings were interpreted as  
"equivocal evidence" of carcinogenicity for male rats but no evidence of carcinogenicity for the other  
gender/species tested.  In another recent carcinogenicity study conducted by Maurer, Cheng, Boysen, and  
Anderson and sponsored by Procter and Gamble (P&G), no evidence was found for an association between  
the development of malignant tumors and exposure to sodium fluoride in rodents of either gender.  Taken  
together, the NTP and P&G studies fail to establish an association between fluoride and cancer.<P>
   <B>Epidemiologic Studies</B><P>
   The ad hoc subcommittee of the Committee to Coordinate Environmental Health and Related Programs  
reviewed the results from numerous epidemiologic studies of the relation between exposure to fluoridated  
water and cancer that have been conducted during the last 40 years.  In addition to the review of these  
studies, the Subcommittee reviewed the findings of a recent study from the National Cancer Institute  
(NCI), which updated and expanded an earlier county-specific analysis for cancer mortality in the United  
States in relation to water fluoridation.  This study evaluated cancer mortality data and examined patterns  
of cancer incidence from 1973 through 1987 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)  
program cancer registries.  The Seer registries were used to obtain data on incidence for all types of  
cancer, with special emphasis placed on trends in osteosarcomas.<P>
   The NCI study identified no trends in cancer risk that could be attributed to the introduction of fluoride  
into drinking water.  There were no substantial differences in cancer mortality rates among persons whom  
lived in counties that had initiated water fluoridation and those in persons who lived in counties without  
water fluoridation.  Similarly, there was no apparent relation between introduction and duration of  
fluoridation and the incidence of cancer, including bone and joint cancer and the subset of  
osteosarcomas.<P>
     The NCI also conducted a more detailed evaluation of osteosarcomas using nationwide age-adjusted  
incidence from the entire SEER database for the years 1973-1987.  During this time, the annual incidence  
of osteosarcoma among males &lt;20 years of age increased from 3.6 cases/106 population to 5.5  
cases/106 population.  The incidence among females decreased slightly during the same period (from 3.8  
cases/106 population to 3.7 cases/106 population).  Although the increase in rates of osteosarcoma for  
males during this period was greater in fluoridated than nonfluoridated areas, extensive analyses revealed  
that these patterns were unrelated to either the introduction or duration of fluoridation.  Consequently, the  
NCI report concluded that, while the explanation for the increase in rates of osteosarcoma among young  
males is unknown, it is not due to exposure to water fluoridation.  Both this report and the reports from  
previous international expert panels which have reviewed earlier data concluded that there is no credible  
evidence of any association between the risk of cancer and exposure to either natural or adjusted fluoride  
in drinking water.<P>
   <B>Effects on Bone</B><P>
   Although some epidemiologic studies have suggested that the incidence of certain types of bone 
fractures  may be higher in some communities with either naturally high or adjusted fluoride levels, other 
studies  have not detected increased incidence of bone fractures.  However, a variety of potentially 
confounding  factors must be examined to assess whether there is association between exposure to fluoride 
and bone  fractures.<P>
   Fluoride has a complex dose-related action on bone.  Although crippling skeletal fluorosis is more  
common in parts of the world with high natural fluoride (>10 ppm) levels in drinking water, its  
occurrence is affected by a variety of factors, including nutritional deficiencies, impaired renal function,  
and age at exposure.  Human crippling skeletal fluorosis is endemic in several countries of the world, but  
is extremely rare in the United States.<P>
    <B>Dental Fluorosis</B><P>
   Although the precise mechanism that causes dental fluorosis is unknown, the likelihood of dental  
fluorosis is related directly to the level of fluoride exposure during tooth development.  The clinical  
spectrum of dental fluorosis varies from symmetrical whitish areas on teeth (very mid) to secondary,  
extrinsic, brownish discoloration and varying degrees of pitting of the enamel (severe dental fluorosis).   
Among children, the prevalence of moderate and severe forms of dental fluorosis is estimated to be 1.3%  
nationally.  Although fluorosis has historically been considered to be a cosmetic problem, these forms of  
dental fluorosis do not produce adverse dental health effects, such as tooth loss or impaired tooth  
function.<P>
   In the 1940s and 1950s, the major sources of fluoride were from drinking water and food.  Since then,  
additional sources of fluoride have become available, including processed beverages and food, dental  
products containing fluoride (e.g., toothpastes and mouth rinses), and fluoride dietary supplements.  In  
appropriate use of these products can substantially increase total fluoride intake.<P>
   In the 1940s, approximately 10% of the population had fluorosis when the concentration of fluoride  
found naturally in the drinking water was about 1 ppm.  Since the 1950s, in nonfluoridated areas, the total  
prevalence of dental fluorosis has clearly increased.  During the same period, in areas where water  
fluoride concentrations have remained in the optimal range (about 1 ppm fluoride), the total prevalence of  
dental fluorosis may have increased.  Increases in the prevalence of dental fluorosis suggest that total  
fluoride exposure is increasing.  Because dental fluorosis does not compromise oral health or tooth  
function, an increase in dental fluorosis does not represent a public health concern; however, it indicates  
that total fluoride exposure may be higher than that necessary to prevent tooth decay.  In general, prudent  
public health practice dictates using no more than the amount necessary to achieve a desired effect.<P>
   <B>RESEARCH AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS</B><P>
   The report of the PHS Subcommittee includes a variety of recommendations regarding health policy and  
research about the risks and benefits of fluoride.  The policy implications pertain to federal, state, and  
local health agencies concerned with fluoridation of community water supplies.  The research  
recommendations on both the benefits and risks of fluorides provide direction and scope to investigators  
and agencies concerned with these aspects of exposure of populations to water fluoridation and fluoride- 
containing products.<P>
   <B>Policy Recommendations</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>The PHS should continue to recommend the use of fluoride to prevent dental caries.     The PHS  
should continue to support optimal fluoridation (i.e., 0.7-1.2 ppm) of drinking water.     The PHS should  
sponsor scientific conferences to assess both the optimal level of total fluoride exposure form all sources  
combined and the appropriate usage of fluoride-containing dental products in order to achieve the benefits  
of reduced dental caries and to minimize the risk of dental fluorosis.<P>
<LI>In accordance with prudent health practice of limiting exposure to no more than that necessary to  
achieve a desired effect, health professionals and the public should avoid excessive and inappropriate  
exposure to fluoride (e.g., health professionals should prescribe fluoride dietary supplements only when  
the fluoride level of the home water supply is known to be deficient.  Parents should educate young  
children to minimize swallowing of fluoridated toothpaste and to use only small amount of toothpaste on  
the brush).<P>
<LI>State health departments and drinking-water programs should continue to inform physicians,  
dentists, and communities about the fluoridation status of drinking water to enable the determination for  
the need for water fluoridation or for supplemental forms of fluoride.<P>
<LI>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should review its regulations concerning naturally  
occurring fluoride in drinking water on the basis of the outcome of the recommended scientific  
conference(s) and the information in this report.<P>
<LI>The FDA should review the labeling requiring for toothpaste and other fluoride-containing products  
to ensure that information is sufficient to enable the public to make informed decisions about their use,  
especially for young children (i.e., those >6 years of age).<P>
<LI>Manufacturers of toothpaste should be encouraged to clearly communicate the fluoride levels in their  
products.  Manufacturers should determine whether toothpaste can be dispensed in a dose-limited  
container for use by children.  Manufacturers of dental products should determine whether the levels of  
fluoride can be reduced while preserving clinical effectiveness.<P>
<LI>Communities with high natural fluoride levels in the public drinking water supply should comply  
with EPA regulations as mandated by the Safe Drinking Water Act.  The current primary and secondary  
maximum contaminant levels for fluoride are 4ppm and 2ppm, respectively.<P>
<LI>The PHS is to develop an action plan to implement research and policy recommendations.<P>
</UL>
   <B>Research Recommendations</B><P>
   <I>The following research recommendations are purposely broader than the policy recommendations 
to  invite participation by a variety of public and private agencies and organizations.</I><P>
   <B>Research on the Benefits of Fluorides</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>Conduct surveys to evaluate the prevalence of dental caries over time and accurately assess exposure  
to fluoride.<P>
<LI>Undertake studies to elucidate further the role of fluoride in preventing coronal and root decay of  
adult teeth.  Undertake studies to identify effective means of providing fluoride to individuals at high risk  
of dental caries.<P>
<LI>Continue long-term studies of caries scores in cities after defluoridation or the discontinuation of  
fluoridation as a supplement to past information that covers only 2-5 years of follow-up period.<P>
<LI>Document the marginal risks, costs, and benefits of providing multiple fluoride regiments in the  
prevention of dental caries.<P>
<LI>Determine the relationship among socioeconomic status, water-fluoridation status, and the use of  
fluoride products.<P>
<LI>In scoring dental caries, count individual surfaces rather than just the number of teeth because such  
scoring provides more information and greater sensitivity.  Express reductions in caries scores as the  
number of tooth surfaces saved from caries, in addition to the percentage of reduction.<P>
</UL>

   <B>Research on the Risks of Fluoride</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>   Continue studies to elucidate the mechanisms of fluoride action on bone and teeth at the molecular  
and physical chemical level.<P>
<LI>   Develop a method of quantitatively identifying dental fluorosis that is sensitive, specific, reliable, 
and  acceptable to the public.<P>
<LI>   Continue to study dental fluorosis to determine the etiology and trends in the prevalence of dental  
fluorosis.<P>
<LI>   Conduct analytical epidemiologic studies of osteosarcoma to determine the risk factors associated  
with its development.  Fluoride exposure and bone levels of fluoride should be included in the study  
design.<P>
<LI>   Evaluate the scientific merit of conducting further animal carcinogenicity studies that us a wide 
range  of chronic doses of fluoride.  Industries sponsoring studies of fluoride should be encouraged to 
make  their data publicly available to aid in this evaluation.<P>
<LI>   Conduct analytic epidemiologic studies to determine the relationship, if any, among fluoride 
intake,  fluoride bone levels, diet, body levels of nutrients such as calcium, and bone fractures.<P>
<LI>   Conduct studies on the reproductive toxicity of fluoride using various dose levels, including the  
minimally toxic maternal dose.<P>
<LI>   Conduct further studies to investigate whether fluoride is genotoxic.<P>

Welcome.  I'm Otto DeLeon, CDA's Public Relations Coordinator.  The following is CDA's on-line news clipping column.  It includes brief summaries
of news clippings of relative interest to organized dentistry.  The clips are culled from the Los Angeles Times, Sacramento Bee, San Francisco Chronicle and Wall Street Journal.  The goal
is to centralize dental-related news coverage for individuals who want to continually monitor
dental developments reported by the mainstream print media.  Clips are update weekly.  I
welcome your comments and suggestions.  Full-length articles are available upon request.  I can be reached at:<br>

Welcome.  I'm Otto DeLeon, CDA's Public Relations Coordinator.  You have reached the on-line
version of CDA's monthly publication for media spokespersons.  Each issue of Primer is devoted
to one dental subject, much like a position paper.  Each issue comprises at least three sections: a
general introduction, a bullet-listing of facts and Q &amp; A.<p>

<p>

The editorial calendar section lists back issues that are available upon request (free of charge). 
Don't hesitate to call and ask for back issues.  We are currently working on getting all back issues
on-line.<p>

<title>Oral Health Care for Seniors</title>

</head>
<body>
<h2>A Guide to Oral Health for Seniors</h2>
<p>

<h4>Straight Talk About Good Dental Care</h4>
<p>

Growing older often means adapting to change.  Good habits maintained for a lifetime help us
cope with change and help preserve a healthy, quality lifestyle.  Your daily brushing and
flossing routine and regular visits to the dentist are strong foundations for good oral and
overall health.<p>

<p>

<h4>How Does Growing Older Affect Oral Health?</h4>
<p>

The aging process often creates subtle or dramatic changes in the condition of teeth, mouth and
gums.<p>

<p>

<b>Keeping teeth clean and white may become more involved.</b>  The formation of plaque, a
colorless layer of bacteria that builds up on teeth, accelerates as we grow older.  Teeth also
may darken in color due to changes in dentin, the bone-like tissue underneath tooth enamel.  <p>

<p>

<b>Gums may begin to recede from teeth.</b>  This process exposes tooth roots to plaque and can
cause tooth decay.  In addition, older fillings may weaken and crack, allowing bacteria to
accumulate around the edges of fillings - causing cavities.  Unfortunately, many individuals
over the age of 50 have decay on both teeth and roots which may require clinical care.<p>

<p>

<b>"Dry Mouth" may develop.</b>  Caused by reduced saliva flow, dry mouth may lead to tooth
damage.  Reduced saliva flow may be a medical disorder or a side effect of medications such
as antihistamines, decongestants, pain killers or diuretics.  The reduced flow affects teeth
because saliva acts a cleaning agent in the mouth to wash away acids produced by plaque. 
When the mouth is not adequately lubricated and moistened by saliva, plaque forms more
quickly and produces cavities.<p>

<p>

<b>Gum disease develops more readily.</b>  Bacteria found in sugars and starches create toxins
which irritate the gums and cause gum tissue to separate from teeth.  Left untreated, gum
disease can cause unnecessary tooth loss.  It also may dissolve the bone that holds your teeth in
place.  Poorly fitted dentures, poor oral hygiene, illnesses and some medications may increase
the severity of gum disease and create chewing problems and pain in the jaw.  Fortunately,
visiting your CDA dentist regularly can help reduce the spread of gum disease and its
damaging effects.<p>

<p>

<h4>What Can Be Done To Keep My Mouth Healthy?</h4>
<p>

Visit your CDA dentist regularly.  Scheduling periodic check-ups is the best way to prevent
and detect problems resulting from the aging process.  Dentists are trained to detect changes in
the condition of gums and teeth as part of regular oral examinations.  Early treatment of gum
disease and cavities reduces the need - and the cost - for more extensive treatment that may be
required if problems of the mouth, gums and teeth go untreated.<p>

<p>

Good at-home care can help reduce the formation of plaque.  The sad fact is that brushing and
flossing alone cannot remove tartar (hardened plaque) from teeth.  See your dentist to have
tartar removed professionally.<p>

<p>

As part of the healthcare team, your dentist is able to diagnose life-threatening diseases that
require medical attention.  Early signs of diabetes, oral cancer or adverse drug reactions and
interactions often can be spotted by the dentist during a regular dental exam.<p>

<p>

It is important to note that your medical condition may have an impact on how your dentist
delivers dental care.  Dental patients with heart conditions or high blood pressure may require
pre-medication, or a change in their regular medication, before undergoing certain dental
procedures.  These conditions should be discussed with your dentist during regular check-ups.<p>

<p>

<h4>Can Dental Treatment Help Maintain My Lifestyle?</h4>
<p>

Yes.  You should be able to eat as you like and enjoy a beautiful smile.  Many dental
treatments are designed to restore your gums and teeth to their youthful good health.  Daily
use of fluoridated toothpastes and mouthwashes prescribed by your dentist can strengthen tooth
enamel and reduce tooth decay, especially around any exposed roots.<p>

<p>

Periodontal (gum) treatments can reduce gum sensitivity, recession and bleeding.  These
treatments also can strengthen the bones that hold teeth in place.  <p>

<p>

Implants, dentures and other tooth restorations are available options.  By filling in gaps from
lost teeth or by replacing diseased teeth, your CDA dentist can help you maintain good
chewing surfaces and bite alignments so that you can chew with ease, eat in comfort and smile
with assurance.<p>

<p>

<h4>Is Good Dental Health Worth The Expense?</h4>
<p>

Yes.  You should also consider what costs are involved in choosing not to take care of your
teeth, mouth and gums. <p>

<p>

With the help of your dentist, a treatment plan can be designed to help you achieve a quality
lifestyle at a reasonable cost.  Your visits to the dental office are the building blocks of good
oral and general health.  Remember that your dentist often is able to diagnose certain medical
problems before they're identified by a physician.<p>

<p>

<h4>What is <i>Senior-Dent</i>, And Can It Lower My Dental Costs?</h4>
<p>

In 1979, CDA established <i><b>Senior-Dent</b></i>, a program offering reduced dental fees for regular
preventive care to people over 60 with an annual household income of $16,000 or less, who
are not covered by Denti-Cal or dental insurance benefits.<p>

<p>

<p>

More than 7,000 licensed CDA dentists throughout California participate in Senior-Dent.  To
locate a participating dentist in your neighborhood, simply call your local dental society (listed
in the Yellow Pages under "Dental Referral Services") or call CDA toll-free at 1-800-736-7071.<p>

<p>

Your CDA dentist is your best resource on good oral care.  On your next visit to the dental
office, feel free to discuss your concerns regarding your oral health or available discount
programs.  With the help of your dentist, you can adapt to change while preserving your
healthy lifestyle.<p>

<title>What Sugar Can Do to Your Baby's Teeth</title>

</head>
<body>
<center><h2>WHAT SUGAR CAN DO TO YOUR BABY'S TEETH IS REALLY ROTTEN</h2></center>

<hr>


<h3>The Harmful Effects of Baby Bottle Tooth Decay</h3>

Good oral health begins when your child is an infant.  Health habits taught early will continue
to provide benefits throughout your child's life.  But without appropriate care and attention,
even babies can develop serious and painful dental disease.  The most common cause of tooth
loss in children isn't accidents or injuries - it's Baby Bottle Tooth Decay (BBTD), a pattern of
severe and rapid tooth decay in infants and toddlers.<p>


<h4>What Causes Baby Bottle Tooth Decay?</h4>

For a baby's tooth decay, three elements are needed: a tooth, plaque, and foods containing
sugar and starches.<p>

	Everyone's mouth has plaque, even an infant's with new "baby" teeth.  Plaque is a
sticky, colorless film of bacteria that constantly forms on tooth surfaces.  When it comes in
contact with sugar and sweets, the bacteria in plaque produces acids which attach and dissolve
the tooth enamel.  This breakdown of the enamel leads to the formation of a cavity.<p>

	Every time your baby consumes sugary or sweet liquids, the acids produced by the
plaque attack the baby teeth.  After numerous attacks by these acids, cavities can begin to
form.  In bottle-fed or nursing infants, the teeth most susceptible to BBTD are the upper front
teeth, but the molars or back teeth also can be affected.<p>

	Surprisingly, liquids that are good for your baby, such as formula, milk, breast milk
and fruit juices, all contain some form of sugar.  These nourishing liquids can be a primary
contributor to the development of cavities in your baby's newly formed teeth.  The sugary
liquids pool around your baby's teeth and gums.  The sugar acts as an energy source, or food
source, for the bacteria which produce the acids that attack the teeth and create cavities.<p>

<h4>Why Is Baby Bottle Tooth Decay So Bad For Children?</h4>

Baby bottle tooth decay not only can cause painful toothaches, it can create feeding and
nutritional problems and may lead to middle ear infections.  In very severe cases, decayed
teeth can become so infected that they may need to be removed.  If a child loses a tooth too
early, it can result in poor eating habits, speech problems and loss of self esteem.  Baby teeth
also play an essential role as space holders for permanent or adult teeth.  Premature loss of
baby teeth may create changes in the growth of the jaw.  If adult teeth cannot assume their
proper position in the jaw, extensive orthodontic repair may be required later on.<p>


<h4>How Can Baby Bottle Tooth Decay Be Prevented?</h4>

<b>Be vigilant.</b>  Because baby teeth are susceptible to decay almost as soon as they appear,
parents should be especially careful about <i>what</i> they feed their children.  It's important for
your baby to get the essential nourishment that comes form milk, formula and fruit juices even
though they contain sugar.  It's <i>when</i> you give your baby these foods that can make a big
difference in the health of your child's teeth.<p>

<b>Don't use a sugary liquid as a pacifier.</b>  Many parents will use a bottle with milk or
juice to pacify their baby at naptime, bedtime and long periods outside of regular meal times. 
While this can give short term comfort, it also can be damaging to your child.  These sugary
liquids pool around the teeth and gums, starting the formation of cavities.  Remember that
tooth decay is usually related more to the length of time the liquid is in the mouth than to the
amount of sugar in the liquid.<p>

<b>Don't put a bottle filled with sugary liquid in the crib.</b>  The best way to prevent
baby bottle tooth decay is to put your baby to bed <i>without</i> a bottle.  While your baby sleeps,
the natural saliva flow is reduced and the body does not wash away the sugary liquid.  This
allows plaque and acid to build up and attach the teeth as your baby sleeps.<p>

Instead of a bottle, try these simple tips: offer your child a security blanket, teddy bear
or pacifier (don't dip it in anything sweet); sing or play music; hold or rock your baby to
sleep; rub or pat your child's head and back; read or tell a story; or use an infant swing to
rock your baby to sleep.<p>

CDA dentists recommend that, if you must give the baby a bottle at nap or bedtime, <b>fill
it only with water.</b><p>

Be sure to consult your CDA dentist if your local water supply does not contain cavity-fighting fluoride.  A fluoride supplement might be advisable for your baby, and the entire
family.<p>

<b>Take an active role in preventing cavities.</b>  Always hold your baby when bottle
feeding and remove the bottle when bottle when your baby falls asleep.  After regular feedings
and snack times, make sure you wipe the child's teeth and gums with a damp washcloth or
gauze pad to remove plaque.  You can begin brushing your baby's teeth with a small soft
toothbrush as soon as the first tooth appears.  Check with your CDA dentist about beginning a
routine of regular flossing as well.<p>

To determine the most appropriate oral care program, make sure you have the baby
examined by your dentist.  The first appointment should be scheduled when your baby is
between six and twelve months of age.<p>

<b>Wean your baby from the bottle sooner, rather than later.</b>  Start to offer your baby
a cup at six months of age and wean your child from the bottle by about one year of age. 
Begin the weaning process by reducing the number of bottles given each day, offering liquids
to your baby in a cup instead.  At 10-12 months, gradually dilute the liquid in the bottle until
it contains only water.  However, make sure your baby continues to get adequate calories from
other foods.<p>


<h4>Good Care Now Means A Lifetime of Smiles</h4>

Good habits established today create a foundation for healthy smiles in the future.  Instilling
good oral hygiene habits from the very beginning - limiting intake of sugar-laden foods and
drinks, brushing and flossing regularly, and scheduling routine check-ups with the dentist - is
the best way to prevent dental disease and to help your children take a healthy bite out of life.<p>

<title>Choices:  Good Health Care Depends on What You Know</title>

</head>
<body>
<h2><center>CHOICES: Good health care depends on what you know</h2>
<p>

</center>
<b><center>by Citizens for the "Right To Know"</center></b><P>

<hr>

<center><h3>Would you...</h3></center>
<h4>buy a car without looking under the hood, checking the gas mileage or taking
it out for a test drive?  Of course not.</h4>

<hr>

<h3>Don't just "settle" for a health plan, "shop" for it!</h3>

Would you buy a car without looking under the hood, checking the gas mileage or taking it out
for a test drive?  Of course not.  Yet, every day, consumers buy health care coverage--one of
life's most critical purchase--without understanding what they are buying.<p>

Whether you're considering a new health care plan through your work during an open
enrollment period or seeking health care insurance on your own, you should know all the facts
about what is and isn't covered before you enroll.<p>

In this era of health care reform, personal responsibility is critical to receiving quality health
care.  You have a right to quality care, but you have a responsibility to investigate which
health care plan best meets your needs.<p>

It is difficult to find out exactly what a health care plan covers, but educating yourself and
asking the right questions before you sign up can help protect you and your family.<p>
<hr>
<h3>What are health care plans?</h3>

Before the advent of "managed care," health coverage was provided by insurance companies
who billed your doctor on a fee-for-service basis.  Today, fee-for-service insurance is still
available, but health care is becoming dominated by "managed" health care plans.  These plans
come in many forms, ranging from <b>Health Maintenance Organizations </b>(HMO) to <b>Preferred
Provider Organizations</b> (PPO).<p>

In an <b>HMO</b>, you will first see a primary care physician (family practice, obstetrics, general
practice, internal medicine or pediatrics) who will, if needed, refer you to a specialist within
the HMO system.  In most HMOs, the plan won't pay for a specialist unless you get a referral.<p>

In a <b>PPO</b>, you choose a primary care physician or specialist from a list of providers who
belong to the PPO.  If you want to see a specific physician outside the PPO, you will have to
pay an extra fee.  If you already have a family physician, you will need to make sure he or she
is part of the PPO network offered by the health care plan you are considering.  <b>Whether
you're considering a new health care plan through your work or seeking health care
insurance on your own.  You should know all the facts about what is and isn't covered
before you enroll.<p>

<hr>
</b><h3>ASSESSING YOUR NEEDS:</h3>


<h4>What do you Need from a health care plan?</h4>
<b>

</b>Health care coverage, just like cars, comes in different makes and models.  Choosing one
depends on your family's needs.  Ask yourself a few important questions to check what type of
plan you need:<p>

<h4>How old are you?</h4>

Men and women have different health care needs.  Women should make sure a prospective
plan covers annual diagnostic exams.  For men fifty years and older, colon and prostate cancer
screening tests are recommended annually.  Make sure these types of tests are included.  Many
seniors have prescription drug needs--compare several plans, "out-of-pocket" drug costs. 
Remember that cheaper is not always better if a plan doesn't cover your specific treatment
need!<p>

<p>

<h4>Do you have a family?</h4>
<p>

Any plan you choose should provide options for covering your children and your spouse. 
Does the plan cover annual checkups and immunizations?  What will it cost you "out-of-pocket" to bring a child to the emergency room?<p>

<p>

Does a family member have a specific chronic condition, like diabetes, which would require
special medicines, self-care education programs, medical equipment and supplies?  Not all
plans offer all of these programs and the costs can add up--ask before you make a decision!<p>

<p>

<h4>Do you have a re-existing condition?</h4>

Some plans simply won't cover any pre-existing condition you might have, or they will place a
moratorium on covering a specific illness for a set time period.  Also, in an attempt to control
costs, many plans may restrict access to more expensive but proven drugs and treatment
products.<p>

<p>

For example, if you or a family member have hemophilia, the types of blood products that are
covered are a major health concern and can have a huge financial impact on what you may
personally have to pay.  For any serious condition, talk to your physician or local disease
organization if you need to know more about what type of specific treatment questions to ask a
plan.<p>

<p>

<h4>Is there a history of specific illness in your family?</h4>
<p>

You need to evaluate if you may be likely to suffer from an illness that has historically shown
up in your family: For example, the tendency toward coronary disease can be inherited.  If
your family has a history of heart disease, look for a plan with good coronary illness
prevention and treatment coverage.<p>

<p>
<hr>
<h3>THE NEXT STEP-- Ask more questions!</h3>
<b><p>

</b>We recommend asking the following specific questions when you are shopping for a plan:<p>

<p>

Can I choose my own primary care physician?<p>

<p>

What is the process for obtaining a referral to a specialist?<p>

<p>

Does the plan include specialists trained for my condition?<p>

<p>

What type of services require prior authorization?<p>

<p>

Is my pre-existing condition covered?<p>

If so, are medicines, self-care education programs, medical equipment and supplies available
to treat my illness covered?<p>

<p>

Are prescription drugs covered?<p>

<p>

Are all drugs available or is there a limited list or formulary?<p>

<p>

Are checkups, immunizations and other prevention programs covered?<p>

<p>

Is there a cap on benefits?  What are the deductibles, premiums and co-payments?<p>

<p>

Who determines when I would be moved out of intensive care and/or discharged from the
hospital?<p>

<p>

What percentage of home-health care is covered by your health plan when you are discharged
from the hospital--50%, 75%, or 100%?<p>

<p>

<b>Remember that Cheaper is not always better if a plan doesn't cover your specific
treatment need!<p>

<p>
<hr>
</b><h3>How can you find out what a health care plan covers?</h3>

The first step is to ask each prospective plan the questions outlined on the previous page and to
factor in your own personal needs.  Oddly enough in many states, health care plans aren't
required to provide you with the answers.  Some states, like California, have disclosure laws,
but health plans still don't disclose what services aren't covered, and what restrictions are
placed on certain services.  But how they answer your questions can give you good idea of
how you will be treated once you are enrolled.<p>

<p>

<h4>Here are a few good tips to check on a health care plan:</h4>
<b><p>

</b>Ask friends and co-workers about the type of plan they use.  Are they satisfied?<p>

<p>

Ask your doctor or friend's doctor what they think of a plan, particularly regarding how a plan
would cover a chronic condition or specific treatment need.<p>

<p>

Call a disease support group and check to see if they have any references on health care plans.<p>

<p>

Ask your doctor's benefits coordinator.<p>

<p>

<b>For any serious condition, talk to your physician or local disease organization if you need
to know more about what type of specific treatment questions to ask a plan.<p>

<p>
<hr>
</b><h3>How to dig deeper</h3>
<b><p>

</b>You can find out how a plan makes certain decisions that will impact your coverage and
whether the plan has a process to make non-covered and whether the plan has a process to
make non-covered or experimental treatments available to you.  This will require you to ask a
number of questions and talk with the plan's manager.<p>

<p>

<h4>Ask these questions:</h4>
<b><p>

</b>Is there a procedure to appeal a decision regarding my coverage?<p>

<p>

Does my physician have a case manager to assist patient inquiries?<p>

<p>

If an experimental procedure is the best treatment for me, will it be covered?<p>

<p>

Does the plan include a point-of-service option?  How does it work?<p>

<p>
<hr>

<title>Consumer Guide to Dental Insurance</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2><center>What Everyone Should Know About Selecting And
Using Dental Benefits : A Consumer's Guide To
Dental Insurance</h2>
<hr>

</center>
<h3>It's Important To Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is</h3>

When most people think about health insurance, they think first about covering costs of
treatment for serious medical conditions or accidents.  That's a natural thing to do.  But there's
another type of insurance that's equally important to your well being--dental insurance. 
Because dental disease is so common, being protected by dental insurance and using it wisely
are essential safeguards for you and your family.<p>

<h3>There's A World Of Difference Between Medical And Dental
Disease...</h3>
<b>

</b>Unlike medical disease, which can be both unpredictable and catastrophic, most dental
ailments are preventable.  Preventive care, including regular checkups and cleanings, is the
key to maintaining your oral health.  With regular visits to the dentist, problems can be
diagnosed early and treated without extensive testing or elaborate and expensive procedures. 
That keeps the costs of dental care much lower than those of medical care.  In fact, total
spending for dental care is decreasing.  In 1970, it made up 6.3 percent of total health care
expenditures.  But in 1991, dental care's share of health care spending was only 4.9 percent.<p>

<p>

<h3>...And Between Medical And Dental Benefits</h3>
<b><p>

</b>Medical insurance is designed primarily to cover the costs of diagnosing, treating and curing
serious illnesses.  This process may involve a primary care physician and multiple specialists,
a variety of tests performed by doctors and laboratories, multiple procedures and masses of
medications.  Depending on the health, age and attitudes of people in the medical coverage
group, costs can fluctuate widely.<p>

<p>

Dental insurance works differently.  Most dental coverage is designed to ensure that the patient
receives regular <b>preventive</b> care.  High quality dental care rarely requires the complex,
multiple resources often required by medical care.  A thorough examination by the dentist and
a set of x-rays are all it usually takes to diagnose a problem.  By and large, dental care is
provided by a general practitioner, although some cases may require the services of a dental
specialist.  Because most dental disease is preventable, dental benefits plans are structured to
encourage patients to get the regular, routine care so vital to preventing and diagnosing the
onset of serious disease.<p>

<p>

In fact, most dental benefits plans require patients to assume a greater portion of the costs for
treatment of dental disease than for preventive procedures.  By placing an emphasis on
prevention, and by covering regular teeth cleaning and check-ups, Americans saved nearly
$100 billion in dental care costs during the 1980s.<p>

<p>

<h3>Dental Insurance Is Helping Keep America Healthy</h3>
<b><p>

</b>The availability of dental insurance is the single greatest factor in helping you get the dental
care you need.  More than 48 percent of all Americans--113 million of us--are covered by
privately financed dental insurance plans.  This compares with just 12 million people who had
such coverage in 1970.  As a result of increased access to regular care and the widespread use
of preventive measures, the incidence of dental decay has dropped sharply.  Half of today's
school children never have had a cavity.<p>

<p>

<h3>Different Plans for Different Needs--Know the Differences</h3>
<b><p>

</b>Consumers can choose from an assortment of dental benefits plans that accommodate a variety
of needs and expectations.  The following factors differentiate one plan from another:<p>

<p>

1.  the type of third party responsible for funding and administration of the plan;<p>

<p>

2.  the alternatives offered for selecting a dentist;<p>

<p>

3.  the structure used to compensate the dentist for services provided; and<p>

<p>

4.  the method by which benefits and payments are calculated.<p>

<p>

Understanding these differences is essential to making an informed decision when selecting a
plan and using the benefits.<p>

<p>

<h3>1.  Third Parties</h3>
<b><p>

</b>Regardless of the dental benefits plan, there are usually three parties involved: you, the
patient; the dentist providing care; and a third party with whom you or your employer
contracts for coverage.  If your options include a plan funded by your employer, you may
have an administrator responsible for processing and payment of claims.  The primary
responsibility of the third party is to provide the financial foundation for your dental benefits
plan.  There are three types of third parties.<p>

<p>

<b>Dental Service Corporations.</b>  These not-for-profit organizations negotiate and administer
contracts for dental care to individuals or specific groups of patients.  Delta Dental Plan and
Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans are examples of this third party type.<p>

<p>

<b>Insurance Carriers.  </b>These for-profit companies underwrite the financial risk of, and process
payment claims for, dental services.  Carriers contract with individuals or patient groups to
offer a variety of dental benefits packages, often including both fee-for-service and managed
care plans.<p>

<p>

<b>Self-Funded Insurers.</b>  These companies use their own funds to underwrite the expense of
providing dental care to their employees.  The company pays for the dental costs of its
employees, usually with limitations on services and fixed-dollar allocations.<p>

<p>

<h3>2.  Choosing a Dentist</h3>
<p>

Dental benefits plans can be categorized by the options offered for selecting a dentist.  Some
plans allow you the freedom to choose your own dentist, while others, in exchange for lower
rates, limit your choice.  These two alternatives are called open and closed panel plans.<p>

<p>

<b>Open Panel.</b>  This type of dental benefits plan allows covered patients to receive care from
any dentist and allows any dentist to participate.  Any dentist may accept or refuse to treat
patients enrolled in the plan.  Open panel plans often are described as <i>freedom of choice</i> plans.<p>

<p>

<b>Closed Panel.</b>  This type of plan allows covered patients to receive care only from dentists
who have signed a contract of participation with the third party.  The third party contracts with
a certain percentage of dentists within a particular geographic area.  There are two types of
closed panel plans.<p>

<p>

<b><i>Preferred Provider Organization (PPO)</i> - </b>This plan allows a particular group of patients to
receive dental care from a defined panel of dentists.  The participating dentist agrees to charge
less than usual fees to this specific patient base, providing savings for the plan purchaser.  If
the patient chooses to see a dentist who is not designated as a "preferred provider," that patient
may be required to pay a greater share of the fee-for-service.<p>

<p>

<b><i>Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO)</i></b> - This closed panel plan allows a particular group of
patients to receive dental care only from participating dentists.  Although there may be some
exceptions for emergency and out-of-area care, if a patient decides to see a dentist which is not
listed on the EPO panel, charges for service will not be covered by the plan.  Because
participating dentists are required to offer substantial fee reductions, many dentists elect not to
participate in EPO-type plans.  Under some benefits plans, participating dentists may be
salaried employees of the EPO.  An EPO contracts with a limited number of practitioners
within a geographic area.  Access to necessary specialized care can be restricted.  The EPO
also may limit the amount of services that a patient can receive in a given calendar year.<p>

<p>

<h3>3.  Paying The Dentist</h3>
<b><p>

</b>When choosing a benefits plan, it is important to know who pays what to whom.  Dental plans
can be categorized into three types based on the compensation and treatment provided.<p>

<p>

<b>Indemnity Plans.</b>  This type of plan pays the dentist on a traditional fee-for-service basis.  A
monthly premium is paid by the patient and/or the employer to an insurance carrier, which
directly reimburses the dentist for the services provided.  Insurance companies usually pay
between 50 percent and 80 percent of the dentist's fee for covered services; the remaining 20
percent to 50 percent is paid by the patient.  These plans often have a pre-determined
deductible, a dollar amount which varies from plan to plan, that the patient must pay before
the insurance carrier will begin paying for care.  Indemnity plans also can limit the amount of
services covered within a given year and pay the dentist based on a variety of fee schedules.<p>

<p>

<b>Capitation Plans.</b>  This type of plan provides comprehensive dental care to enrolled patients
through designated provider dentists.  A Dental Health Maintenance Organization (DHMO) is
a common example of a capitation plan.  The dentist is paid on a per capita (per head) basis
rather than for actual treatment provided.  Participating dentists receive a fixed monthly fee
based on the number of patients assigned to the office.  In addition to premiums, patient co-payments may be required for each visit.<p>

<p>

<b>Direct Reimbursement Plans.</b>  Under this self-funded plan, an employer or company sponsor
pays for dental care with its own funds, rather than paying premiums to an insurance carrier or
third party.  The patient pays the dentist directly and, once furnished with a receipt showing
payment and services received, the employer reimburses the employee a fixed percentage of
the dental care costs.  The plan may limit the amount of dollars an employee can spend on
dental care within a given year, but often places no limit on services provided.  Patients can
select a dentist of their choice and, in conjunction with the dentists, can play an active role in
planning the treatment most appropriate and affordable to ensure optimum oral health.<p>

<p>

<h3>4.  Calculating Payments</h3>
<b><p>

</b>A clear understanding of the methods used to calculate benefits and payments will allow you to
compare and evaluate the purchasing power of different plans.  The following are four
common payment schedules.<p>

<p>

<b>Capitation (per capita).</b>  This fee schedule is used by plans structured to provide a predefined
level of benefits.  Because dental care needs vary by individual, it is critical to have a thorough
understanding of the level or range of services "defined" or covered by the plan.  Under this
fee schedule, the patient is responsible to pay for treatment not covered within the scope of the
plan.  In some cases, the allocated payment a dentist receives from the benefits plan, including
patient co-payments, is less than the actual cost of providing care.  Patients often settle for
less-than-optimal treatment alternatives or postpone necessary services when their co-payments
do not cover all possible options.<p>

<p>

<b>Table of Schedule of Allowances.</b>  Plans using this form of benefits calculation establish a
maximum dollar limit for each covered procedure, regardless of the fee charged by the dentist. 
If you select a plan that uses this type of table or schedule, ask how often the table is adjusted
for inflation or for changes in accepted dental procedures.  In these plans, the difference
between the allowed charge and the dentist's fee is paid directly by the patient.<p>

<p>

Patients should understand that contracted fee reductions listed in some plan allowance
schedules can significantly diminish the level and quality of care delivered.  Contracted rates
are based on the size of the patient population and projections of the amount and type of
treatment performed within a given time frame.  Since cost control drives this payment
approach, your ability to choose your dentist or see a specialist may be limited.<p>

<p>

<b>Direct Reimbursement.</b>  In this self-funded plan, the patient pays the doctor for services. 
The employer or plan sponsor reimburses the employee for a predetermined percentage of all
costs.  Under this fee schedule, the employee has an incentive to work with the dentist to plan
healthy and economical solutions.<p>

<p>

<b>Usual, Customary &amp; Reasonable (UCR).</b>  Most indemnity (traditional fee-for-service) plans
use this payment schedule.  It allows patients to select their own dentist.  The UCR schedule
pays benefits based on a fixed percentage of the lesser of the dentist's fee or the fee determined
by the insurance carrier to be "usual," "customary" or "reasonable" for the service in the
community in which the service was delivered.  Wide fluctuations in UCR fees between
communities have made this payment system highly controversial.  Because many insurance
carriers set the UCR percentage too low in comparison to the area's usual professional fees,
patients may wind up paying more out-of-pocket.  Most payments are made directly to the
dentist, but in some instances they are made to the beneficiary.<p>

<p>

<h3>Dental Plans Do Have Their Limitations</h3>
<b><p>

</b>Today's health insurance, including your dental plan, is designed to help you get the care you
need at a reasonable cost.  Because each person's oral health is different, costs can vary
widely.  To control dental treatment costs, most plans will limit the amount of care you can
receive in a given year.  This is done by placing a dollar "cap" or limit on the amount of
benefits you can receive, or by restricting the number or type of services that are covered. 
Some plans may totally exclude certain services or treatment to lower costs.  Know specifically
what services your plan covers and excludes.<p>

<p>

There are, however, certain limitations and exclusions in most dental benefits plans that are
designed to keep dentistry's costs from going up without penalizing the patient.  All plans
exclude experimental procedures and services not performed by or under the supervision of a
dentist, but there may be some less obvious exclusions.  Sometimes dental coverage and health
insurance may overlap.   Read and understand the conditions of your dental plan.  Exclusions
in your dental plan may be covered by your medical insurance.<p>

<p>

The California Dental Association encourages consumers to choose plans that impose dollar or
service limitations, rather than those that exclude categories of service.  By doing so, you can
receive the care that's best for you and actively participate with the dentist in the development
of treatment plans that give the most and highest quality care.<p>

<p>

To help you stretch each dental benefit dollar, most plans provide patients and purchasers with
special administrative services.  Find out if your plan provides the following mechanisms to
help you budget, analyze and dispute, if necessary, the costs of your dental care.<p>

<p>

<b>Predetermination of Costs.</b>  Some plans encourage you or your dentist to submit a treatment
proposal to the plan administrator before receiving treatment.  After review, the plan
administrator may determine: the patient's eligibility; the eligibility period; services covered;
the patient's required co-payment; and the maximum limitation.  Some plans require
predetermination for treatment exceeding a specified dollar amount.  This process is also
known as preauthorization, precertification, pretreatment review or prior authorization.<p>

<p>

Although your dental benefits plan may not be bound to predetermined costs, this mechanism
can help you and your dentist plan and budget a treatment plan appropriate to your oral health
needs.<p>

<p>

<b>Annual Benefits Limitations.</b>  To help contain costs, your plan may limit your benefits by
number of procedures and/or dollar amount in a given year.  In most cases, particularly if
you've been getting regular preventive care, these limitations allow for adequate coverage.  By
knowing in advance what and how much your plan allows, you and your dentist can plan
treatment that will minimize your out-of-pocket expenses while maximizing compensation
offered by your benefits plan.<p>

<p>

<b>Peer Review for Dispute Resolution.</b>  Many plans provide a peer review mechanism through
which disputes between third parties, patients and dentists can be resolved, eliminating many
costly court cases.  Peer review is established to ensure fairness, individual case consideration
and a thorough examination of records, treatment procedures and results.  Most disputes can
be resolved satisfactorily for all parties.<p>

<p>

<b>Premium Adjustments and Reevaluations.</b>  Patients and plan purchasers should insist on
regular reviews of premium levels to ensure that UCR or Table of Allowances payment
schedules are equitable.  This analysis can help optimize your benefit levels, ensuring that
every dollar you spend is used wisely.<p>

<p>

<b>Coordination of Benefits.</b>  If you are covered under two dental benefits plans, notify the
administrator or carrier of your primary plan about your dual coverage status.  Plan benefits
coordination can help protect your rights and maximize your entitled benefits.  In some cases
you may be assured full coverage where plan benefits overlap, and receive a benefit from one
plan where the other plan lists an exclusion.<p>

<p>

<h3>Eight Things To Consider When Choosing Your Dental Plan</h3>
<b><p>

</b>What looks like a bargain today may not be a good buy in the long run.  While your out-of-pocket costs are, of course, an important part of your decision-making process when choosing
a dental plan, they are not the only criteria to use when evaluating your options.  Your
primary focus should be to determine whether the coverage will satisfy your dental care needs. 
Consider the following:<p>

<p>

<i>1.	Does the plan give you the freedom to choose your own dentist or are you restricted to
a panel of dentists selected by the insurance company?</i>  If you have a family dentist
with whom you are satisfied, consider the effects changing dentists will have on the
quality or quantity of care you receive.  Because regular visits to the dentist reduce the
likelihood of developing serious dental disease, it's best to have and maintain an
established relationship with a dentist you trust.<p>

<p>

<i>2.	Who controls treatment decisions--you and your dentist or the dental plan?</i>  Many plans
require dentists to follow treatment plans that rely on a Least Expensive Alternative
Treatment (LEAT) approach.  If there are multiple treatment options for a specific
condition, the plan will pay for the less expensive treatment option.  If you choose a
treatment option that may better suit your individual needs and your long-term oral
health, you will be responsible for paying the difference in costs.  It's important to
know who makes the treatment decisions under your plan.  These cost control measures
may have an impact on the quality of care you'll receive.<p>

<p>

<i>3.	Does the plan cover diagnostic, preventive and emergency services?  If so, to what
extent?</i>  Most dental plans provide coverage for selected diagnostic services, preventive
care and emergency treatment that are basic for maintaining good oral health.  But the
extent or frequency of the services covered by some plans may be limited.  Depending
upon your individual oral health needs, you may be required to pay the dentist directly
for a portion of this basic care.  Find out how much treatment is allowed in any given
year without cost to you, and how much you will have to pay for yourself.<p>

<p>

Every dental care plan is different.  It's your responsibility to be informed about what your
specific plan will cover.  As a basis of comparison, the following services should be covered
in full, with no deductible or patient co-payment:<p>

<p>

			<i>Initial Oral Examination</i>--once per dentist<p>

			<i>Recall Examinations</i>--twice per year<p>

			<i>Complete x-ray survey</i>--once every three years<p>

			<i>Cavity-detecting bite-wing x-rays</i>--once per year<p>

			<i>Prophylaxis or teeth cleaning</i>--twice per year<p>

			<i>Topical Fluoride treatment</i>--twice per year<p>

			<i>Sealants</i>--for those under age 18<p>

<p>

<i>4.	What routine corrective treatment is covered by the dental plan?  What share of the
costs will be yours?</i>  While preventive care lessens the risk of serious dental disease,
additional treatment may be required to ensure optimal health.  A broad range of
treatment can be defined as routine.  Most plans cover 70 percent to 80 percent of such
treatment.  Patients are responsible for the remaining costs.  Examples of routine care
include:<p>

<p>

			<i>Restorative care</i> - amalgam and composite resin fillings and stainless
steel crowns on primary teeth<p>

			<i>Endodontics</i> - treatment of root canals and removal of tooth nerves<p>

			<i>Oral Surgery</i> - tooth removal (not including bony impaction) and minor
surgical procedures such as tissue biopsy and drainage of minor oral
infections.<p>

			<i>Periodontics </i>- treatment of uncomplicated periodontal disease including
scaling, root planning and management of acute infections or lesions<p>

			<i>Prosthodontics</i>--repair and/or relining or reseating of existing dentures
and bridges.<p>

<p>

	Understand what routine dental care is covered by the plan, and what percentage of the
costs will come our of your pocket.<p>

<p>

<i>5.	What major dental care is covered by the plan?  What percentage of these costs will
you be required to pay?</i>  Since dental benefits encourage you to get preventive care,
which often eliminates the need for major dental work, most plans are not generous
when it comes to paying for major dental work, most plans cover less than 50 percent
of the cost of major treatment.  Most plans limit the benefits--both in number of
procedures and dollar amount--that are covered in a given year.  Be aware of these
restrictions when choosing your plan and as you and your dentist develop treatment best
suited for you.  Major dental care includes:<p>

<p>

			<i>Restorative care</i>--gold restorations and individual crowns<p>

			<i>Oral Surgery</i>--removal of impacted teeth and complex oral surgery
procedures.<p>

			<i>Periodontics</i>--treatment of complicated periodontal disease requiring
surgery involving bones, underlying tissues or bone grafts.<p>

			<i>Orthodontics</i>--treatment including retainers, braces and/or diagnostic
materials.<p>

			<i>Dental Implants</i>--either surgical placement or restoration<p>

			<i>Prosthodontics</i>--fixed bridges, partial dentures and removable or fixed
dentures.<p>

<p>

<i>6.	Will the plan allow referrals to specialists?  Will my dentist and I be able to choose the
specialist?  </i>Some plans limit referrals to specialists.  Your dentist may be required to
refer you to a limited selection of specialists who have contracted with the plan's third
party.  You also may be required to get permission from the plan administrator <b>before</b>
being referred to a specialist.  If you choose a plan with these limitations, make sure
qualified specialists are available in your area.  Look for a plan with a broad selection
of different types of specialists.  If you have children, you may prefer a plan that
allows a pediatric dentist to be your child's primary care dentist.  Since specialized
treatment is generally more costly than routine care, some plans discourage the use of
specialists.  While many general practitioners are qualified to perform some specialized
services, complex procedures often require the skills of a dentist with special training. 
Discuss the options with your dentist before deciding who is best qualified to deliver
treatment.<p>

<p>

<i>7.	Can you see the dentist when you need to, and schedule appointment times convenient
for you?</i>  Dentists participating in closed panel or capitation plans may have select
hours to see plan patients.  They may schedule appointments for these patients on given
days, or at specified hours of the day, restricting your access.  Some dentist's fees for
seeing you on weekends or during emergencies are high than those the plan allows. 
You may be required to pay additional costs yourself.  If you select these types of
plans, have a clear understanding of your dentist's policies as well as the plan's dentist-to-patient ratio.  It's the best way to ensure your access to care is not unduly restricted
and that you are not surprised by higher fees the plan does not cover.<p>

<p>

<i>8.	Will the plan provide benefits to patients who may also be covered by another dental
plan?</i>  It is not unusual to be eligible for dual benefits.  You may be covered under
your company's plan as well as under that of your spouse's employer.  In analyzing
your options, make sure to look for a plan that allows <b>coordination of benefits.</b><p>

  	You should be entitled to either 100 percent coverage or some form of premium credit. 
By coordinating benefits, you can eliminate being penalized or denied coverage when
the two plans have conflicting exclusions.<p>

<p>

<h3>Getting The Best And Most From Your Plan</h3>
<b><p>

</b><p>

To take full advantage of your dental benefits plan, visit the dentist regularly and get the
preventive care that will keep your mouth healthy.  Follow the treatment plan you and your
dentist have developed.  Do your dental homework--brush and floss regularly and maintain a
regular schedule of oral examinations and teeth cleanings.<p>

<p>

Should you need treatment for particular conditions, follow the procedure for predetermination
required by your plan.  Find out what your insurance will cover.  Feel free to discuss a
payment plan with your dentist for your portion of the treatment costs.<p>

<p>

<h3>Making An Informed Choice</h3>
<b><p>

</b>The law mandates that consumers with dental coverage receive a fully detailed patient
information handbook--a Description of Benefits--that clearly outlines coverage, limitations
and exclusions.  Before selecting a plan that best suits your needs, ask your carrier or company
benefits coordinator for a copy of the benefits handbook.  If you have questions about
coverage, exclusions, calculation of benefits or payment of benefits, ask before making your
plan selection.  Find out which plans your dentist participates in and why.  That's the best way
for you to get care from the dentist of your choice, and still take advantage of the costs savings
due to you.<p>

<p>

Selecting an insurance program wisely isn't simple.  But having the facts to make an informed
decision can make a difference.  No plan is perfect; each has its advantages and limitations. 
Read the fine print.  And by all means ask questions.  The more you know about dental
benefits, the better equipped you will be to select the best coverage for your dental health.<p>

<title>Is Your Dental Coverage Good Enough</title>

</head>
<body>
<h2><center>IS YOUR DENTAL COVERAGE GOOD ENOUGH ???</h2>
</center>
<hr>

The California Dental Association introduced the "Dental Patient Bill of Rights" to explain
individual patient rights and "Just The Facts, Please" to simplify complicated insurance
company terms.  This brochure is the latest in the series.  It is designed to help you secure the
best possible dental coverage.<p>

<h3><center>START WITH THE BASICS</h3>
</center>


<h4>What is Dental Coverage?</h4>

Dental coverage, or more correctly a dental benefits plan, reimburses you for certain dental
expenses according to written agreement.<p>

Dental benefits usually are provided under a contract between your employer or union (the
plan's "sponsor") and an insurance company, sometimes referred to as a third-party carrier.<p>


<h4>Why Do Rates Increase?</h4>

In general, rates go up to reflect rising costs, increased use of benefits, or an increase in the
fee charged by the insurance company.  Sponsors sometimes reduce your benefits to postpone
rate hikes.<p>


<h4>$$$ vs. Care</h4>

Some plans have not kept pace with advances in dentistry, so you may find certain common
procedures excluded or severely limited.  Also, a plan may allow the insurance company to
substitute a cheaper service that, in the carrier's opinion, is professionally adequate.<p>

Understandably, people make health care decisions based on how much their coverage pays,
assuming insurance will always take care of basic needs.  Since this is frequently not the case,
preventive measures and needed work are postponed.<p>

DON'T DO IT.  Prevention is the most efficient and least costly way to protect your oral
health.  Once dental disease develops, it will not heal without treatment.<p>


<h4>General Health Insurance vs. Dental Coverage</h4>

Unlike diseases of the rest of your body, problems that affect your oral health usually are
preventable, making catastrophic dental coverage generally unnecessary.  It is not valid to
justify increases in dental insurance premiums by comparing them to escalating health care
costs.  Be wary of this kind of explanation.  It's like comparing apples and oranges.<p>


<center><h3>SOME THINGS TO CONSIDER:</h3>
</center>

<h4>A Prevention-Oriented Program</h4>

A good dental plan should include 100 percent coverage for all diagnostic and preventive
procedures.  Any dental plan should respect your <i>right to choose your own dentist.</i><p>


<h4>The Doctor/Patient Relationship</h4>

People stay with a dentist whose skills they know and trust.  The relationship between a dentist
and a patient is threatened as new programs are designed to make group coverage less costly
for sponsors.  In some cases, the new policies don't cover treatment provided by your family
dentist.<p>

You are the best judge of dentists.  Neither an insurance company nor your employer knows
your individual preferences or needs.  They should not choose your dentist for you.<p>


<h4>Your Individuality</h4>

Your individual needs may not have been taken into consideration in defining group coverage. 
To create a picture of an "average" patient, you and your co-workers are reduced to a series of
numbers that reflect age, education, and marital status.  You can average numbers.  There is
no such thing as an average person.<p>


<h4>Your Best Interests</h4>

Your coverage may be negotiated by administrators whose primary concern may not be your
family's dental needs.  Have you ever wondered how your reimbursements are determined? 
Who judges the appropriateness of treatment agreed to by you and your dentist?  Where is that
person located?  Does that person have the dental training and education to make such
decisions?<p>


<h4>Your Influence As A Consumer</h4>

No matter who pays for your dental benefits, you have a right to be heard.  Dental coverage,
like salary and vacation time, is part of your total compensation package.  EXERCISE YOUR
RIGHT.  Discuss your concerns.  Voice your preferences.  Any reasonable employer will
listen.<p>


<center><h3>WHAT CAN I DO?</h3>
</center>

<h4>Read Your Benefits Booklet</h4>

Current federal law requires your plan sponsor to provide a full disclosure and description of
your benefits package upon your employment or enrollment into the program.  READ IT!<p>


<h4>Ask Questions</h4>

Once you've read your booklet, ask questions on anything you do not understand.  If your
benefits manager cannot answer your questions, call the insurance company.  If you still can't
get answers, you may want to talk to someone at the California Department of Insurance.  It
has a consumer hotline:  1-800-927-4357.<p>

If your coverage is valid only at employer-specified dentists or through service corporations
such as Delta Dental or Blue Shield, you will need to contact the State Department of
Corporations in Sacramento, rather than the Department of Insurance.<p>


<h4>Investigate Discrepancies</h4>

If you receive payment from an insurance company that is less than you expected, talk to your
benefits manager and/or the insurance company about your concerns.  You have the <i>right to
know</i> how your benefits are calculated.<p>


<h4>Know the Facts</h4>

Insist on a clear description of your dental coverage.  Know the different types (See our
brochure, "Just The Facts, Please") and their limitations.  To take advantage of your benefits,
you may have to stop seeing your family dentist.<p>


<h4>Do Your Homework</h4>

Insurance companies <i>can</i> create plans that satisfy both your needs and those of your employer. 
Ask your friends who work in other industries and companies about their benefits.  Compare
your plan to theirs.  Get information about programs you like and pass it along to your benefits
manager or your supervisor.  Talk to fellow employees about options.  A fringe benefit that
isn't used because it doesn't meet your needs wastes your employer's money.  Speak up!<p>


<h4>Draw Your Own Conclusions</h4>

What an insurance company pays on claims may bear no resemblance to the average dental
fees in your community.  Insurance companies can set rates which may not relate to actual
costs.  Consider that individual dentists' fees vary due to differences in training, overhead,
location and the time required to perform procedures.  If your claim was not paid in full, find
out why.  And if you do not agree, with the insurance company, challenge the reimbursement
in writing.  It's your right.<p>

Too many "no" answers mean changes are needed.  Changes will not occur unless you ask for
them. It's up to you.<p>

<h2><center>JUST THE FACTS, PLEASE ???</h2>
</center>
<hr>

While the roles you and your dentist play in maintaining your oral health are easy to
understand, the role of dental benefits is sometimes unclear.  Insurance industry jargon used to
describe your benefits often blurs the actual terms of coverage.  We encourage you to be
informed on how your dental benefit plans work so that you can make the most of your
coverage.<p>

This brochure contains important information to clarify sometimes confusing aspects of dental
coverage.  First, some definitions...<p>

<h4><center>WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?</h4>
</center>

<b>UCR:</b>  A widely used method, which may vary from company to company, for determining
benefit reimbursement levels.  The initials simply mean:<p>

<b>U</b>sual.  The fee that an individual dentist most frequently charges for a given dental
service.<p>

	<b>C</b>ustomary.  A fee determined by the insurance company based on the range of usual
fees charged by dentists in the same geographic area.<p>

<b>R</b>easonable.  A fee which is justifiable considering special circumstances of the
particular care rendered.<p>

<b>Table of Allowances:</b>  Assigns a specific dollar to each dental procedure.<p>

<b>Pre-determination:</b>  After the treatment plan is decided upon by the patient and the dentist,
the insurance company reports back on what portion of the treatment plan will be covered.<p>

<b>Freedom of Choice:</b>  Allows the patient to choose any dentist.  Coverage with this feature
allows you to receive full benefits for treatment provided by any dentist of your choice.<p>

<b>Limitations:</b>  Limits the benefits for procedures or the number of times a procedure will be
covered.<p>

<b>Exclusions:</b>  Denies benefit coverage for certain procedures.<p>

<b>Least Expensive Alternate Treatment:</b>  The insurance company's contractual arrangement
with the policyholder allows the insurance company to substitute a less expensive, but in the
insurance company's opinion, professionally adequate service.  <p>

<h4><center>HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW YOUR BENEFITS?</h4>
</center>

<b>1.</b>	What types of dental coverage are offered by your employer or union?<p>

<b>2.</b>	Which procedures does your dental plan limit or exclude?  Do certain procedures have
waiting periods?<p>

<b>3.</b>	How are your benefits calculated?  (UCR? Table of Allowances?)<p>

<b>4.</b>	Does your plan allow pre-determination of benefits?<p>

<b>5.</b>	Does your plan impose an annual maximum benefit level?<p>

<b>6.</b>	What are your co-payments?<p>

<b>7.</b>	Does your policy cover only the least expensive alternate treatment?<p>


<h4><center>TIPS ON GETTING THE MOST FROM YOUR DENTAL PLAN.</h4>
</center>

<b>1.	Read your benefits booklet.</b>  Dental health coverage is provided by your employer or
union to help you handle the costs of staying healthy.  Using them wisely is your
responsibility.<p>

<b>2.	Know your options.</b>  Be familiar with the exclusions and limitations of your coverage.<p>

<b>3.	Communicate with your dentist, employer and insurance company.</b>  Keep everyone
informed of your experiences.<p>

<b>4.	Practice good oral hygiene.</b>  Follow the hygiene habits prescribed by your dentist.<p>

<b>5.	Ask questions.</b>  Be a partner in your own dental health.<p>


<h4><center>SOME COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.</h4>
</center>

<b>Q:</b>  Why does my dental insurance pay only 50% of the charges when my policy says it will
pay 80%?<p>

<b>A:</b>  There are several possibilities.<p>

  <b>1.  </b>If your benefits are based on UCR calculation, it might indicate that the UCR data is out
of date or not specific to your local area.<p>

  <b>2.  </b>If you belong to a PPO, your full benefits will be paid only if you seek care from one of
the contracting dentists.<p>

  <b>3.</b>  If your benefits are calculated using a Table of Allowances, the table might be out of date
or set at an unrealistically low amount.<p>

  <b>4.  </b>If your policy provides for the least expensive treatment, you will be reimbursed the
stated percentage based on the cost, even if you choose alternate treatment.<p>

<b>Q:</b>  Why can't I go to any dentist?<p>

<b>A:</b>  Many employers will contract with a closed panel or preferred provider program to contain
the costs of insuring employees.  As a result, your dental benefits might only be available by
seeking care from a dentist who has contracted with that company.<p>

<b>Q:</b>  Why do my premiums keep going up?<p>

<b>A:</b>  Dental insurance premiums are in part based on the anticipated claims experience of your
group.  If that group experiences an unexpected high utilization of major dental services, the
premiums will go up.  Insurance company administrative costs and premium taxes also
contribute to the cost of dental coverage.<p>

<b>Q:  </b>Is my dentist overcharging when my insurance company reimburses me for only part of
the dental fees?<p>

<b>A:  </b>Insurance companies pay claims in various ways.  Many base reimbursements on UCR
rates.  However, even the UCR allowance may vary from company to company.  While these
reimbursements <i>usually</i> are based on what the majority of dentists in your area charge,
sometimes the figures used to calculate benefits may be out of date or not specific to your
location.  And, if the company uses a Table of Allowances, benefits assigned to specific dental
treatment may not relate to actual costs.<p>


<h4><center>WHAT DOES YOUR DENTAL BENEFIT PLAN DO FOR YOU?</h4>
</center>

Dental benefit plans help you pay for certain kinds of dental care.  Your dental care decisions
should take into account more than just what is covered.  Your dental health needs can only be
determined by you through consultation with your personal dentist.  Good dental care is your
right, and can best be attained by understanding your specific dental needs and how your
dental benefits plan relates to them.<p>

<h4><center>WHAT TYPE OF PLAN DO YOU HAVE?...NEED?...WANT?</h4>
</center>

  <b>Indemnity:</b>  Indemnity benefits are expressed as a covered fee-for-service.  This coverage
allows patients to choose their own dentist.  Limits and co-payments are set according to the
level of coverage purchased by the employer or union.<p>

<b>  Direct Reimbursement:  </b>Enables employers to offer cost-effective dental benefits while
allowing employees the freedom to choose their own dentists.  The patient receives prescribed
dental treatment and is reimbursed directly by the employer.<p>

  <b>Self Insurance:</b>  The employer assumes the role of an insuring agency.<p>

  <b>Dental Care Service Plan:</b>  A non-profit organization of participating dentists who agree to
charge enrolled patients fees which do not exceed a predetermined level.<p>

<b>  Closed Panel:</b>  Offers a limited number of facilities, and a limited number of dentists from
whom care MUST be obtained.<p>

  <b>Capitation Plan:</b>  You're assigned to a specific dental office where contracting dentists
receive a fixed monthly fee per patient regardless of whether treatment is performed.<p>

  <b>Preferred Provider Organization (PPO):</b>  A group of dentists who contract with an
insurance company to provide care at discounted fees.  ("Preferred" refers to a dentist who has
contractually agreed to provide services at discounted fees.)<p>

<h2>A PATIENT'S GUIDE TO THE DENTAL OFFICE</h2>
<p>

Information is important, so the California Dental Association has prepared this to answer your
questions about dentistry.  We suggest you keep it with your dental and medical records for
future reference.  On the following pages you can read about:<p>

<b>Dental Specialities<br>
Roles Of Dental Team Members<br>
What To Do In A Dental Emergency<br>
Your Rights As A Dental patient<p></b>

Most patients are familiar with the general dentist.  The general dentist is educated to provide
comprehensive services from dental examinations to dental surgery.<p>

  While most dental procedures can be provided by the general dentist, a patient may be
referred to a specialist if the general dentist feels special expertise is necessary.<p>

The American and California Dental Associations (ADA and CDA) recognize these eight types
of specialist:<p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Endodontist</h4>
Deals with the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease and injuries of the internal soft
tissue of the tooth (root canals).<p></li>

<li><h4>Oral And Maxillofacial Surgeon</h4>
Treats injuries and deformities, extracts teeth and performs surgery of the mouth, jaw and
face.<p></li>

<li><h4>Orthodontist</h4>
Prescribes and places corrective devices, such as braces, to align teeth and improve health and
appearance.<p></li>

<li><h4>Pediatric Dentist</h4>
Specializes in the dental health of children from birth to adolescence.<p></li>

<li><h4>Periodontist</h4>
Treats diseases of the gums.<p></li>

<li><h4>Prosthodontist</h4>
Designs and fits bridge-work and dentures.<p></li>

<li><h4>Public Health Specialist</h4>
Coordinates and administers community-wide dental care programs, including public education
on the prevention of dental disease.<p></li>

<li><h4>Oral Pathologist</h4>
Researches the causes, development and effects of oral diseases.<p></li></ul>

<h2>Members Of the Dental Team</h2>

<h3>... Who Does What</h3>

<ul><li><h4>The Dentist</h4>

The dentist is responsible and accountable for everything that goes on in the dental office. 
Only the licensed dentist is educated and trained to diagnose dental problems, plan treatment or
prescribe medication.<p>

  As long as the licensed dentist supervises, certain phases of dental treatment may be
delegated to other members of the dental team.<p></li>


<li><h4>The Dental Hygienist</h4>

The dental hygienist cleans teeth and performs other functions under the direction and
supervision of a licensed dentist.<p>

There are two categories of dental hygienist:<p>

1.  Registered Dental Hygienist (RDH)<p>

2.  Registered Dental Hygienist in Extended Functions (RDHEF)<p></li>


<li><h4>The Dental Assistant</h4>

Under the supervision of the licensed dentist, the job of the dental assistant is to help the
dentist at chairside, take x-rays, and perform other support functions.<p>

There are three categories of dental assistant:<p>

1.  Dental Assistant (DA)<p>

2.  Registered Dental Assistant (RDA)<p>

3.  Registered Dental Assistant in Extended Functions (RDAEF)<p></li>


<li><h4>The Receptionist</h4>

The receptionist generally greets you at the office, makes your appointments, takes insurance
information and serves as an information source for any questions you have about the office,
such as special hours or polices.<p></li></ul>


<h2>WHAT TO DO IN A DENTAL EMERGENCY</h2>

<h4>Toothache</h4>
Rinse the mouth vigorously with warm water.  Use dental floss to remove any trapped food. 
If swelling is present, place cold compresses to the outside of the cheek.<p>

DO NOT USE HEAT.  <p>

DO NOT place aspirin on gum tissue or aching tooth.  GO TO A DENTIST.<p>

<h4>Knocked-Out Tooth</h4>
DO NOT CLEAN THE TOOTH.  Place it in water or milk, or wrap in a clean wet cloth.  GO
TO A DENTIST IMMEDIATELY.  If you can't get dental treatment right away, rinse the
tooth (DO NOT SCRUB), then reinsert the tooth in the socket and stabilize.<p>

<h4>Broken Tooth</h4>
Use warm water to clean dirt and debris from the injured area.  Place cold compresses on the
face next to the injured tooth to minimize swelling.<p>

<h4>Object Wedged Between Teeth</h4>
Try to remove the object using dental floss.  DO NOT use sharp or pointed objects.  Guide the
floss in carefully so as not to cut the gums.<p>

<h2>DENTAL PATIENT BILL OF RIGHTS</h2>

Your dentist is the best source of information about your dental health, and wants you to feel
comfortable about services offered.  You have the right to ask questions. <b>And as an informed
dental patient you also have these important rights:</b><p>
<ul>
<li><h4>You Have A Right</h4>
to see the dentist every time you receive dental treatment.<p></li>

<li><h4>You Have A Right</h4>
to know in advance the type and expected cost of treatment.<p></li>

<li><h4>You Have A Right</h4>
to expect dental team members to use appropriate infection controls, such as gloves.<p></li>

<li><h4>You Have A Right</h4>
to ask about treatment alternatives and be told, in language you can understand, the advantages
and disadvantages of each.<p></li>

<li><h4>You Have A Right</h4>
to know the education and training of your dentist and the dental team.<p></li>

<li><h4>You Have A Right</h4>
to know what professional rules, laws and ethics apply to your dentist and the dental team.<p></li>

<li><h4>You Have A Right</h4>
to choose your own dentist.<p></li></ul>

<title>Brush, Floss & Paint</title>

<body>
<h2>BRUSH, FLOSS &amp; PAINT</h2>
<p>

<h4>Three Ways to Prevent Cavities</h4>
<p>

With the help of your dentist, preventing tooth decay can become even easier.  You may
already be aware that daily brushing and flossing are the most important weapons against the
formation of plaque, the primary cause of cavities.  In addition to your regular routine of
brushing and flossing, your dentist can apply a coat of plastic material - called a sealant - on
the top, or biting, surfaces of your teeth.  This plastic coating creates a barrier between your
teeth and seals out the decay-causing bacteria that live in plaque.<p>

<p>

<h4>What is Plaque and Why Does It Cause Cavities?</h4>
<p>

As you or your children eat and drink during the day, the foods in your mouth combine with
bacteria to produce a sticky film called plaque that attaches on and in between tooth surfaces
(tooth enamel).  Plaque often is found on the chewing surfaces of back teeth, from which it is
difficult to remove by brushing and flossing alone.  If plaque is not removed regularly from
your teeth, it can produce acids which will attack the tooth enamel and create pits or holes
(cavities) in the tooth.  This is tooth decay.<p>

<p>

<h4>How Can Sealants Help Prevent Cavities?</h4>
<p>

Coating your teeth with a slippery plastic material makes it harder for plaque to stick to the
tiny grooves on the biting surfaces of the teeth - reducing the risk of forming cavities and tooth
decay.<p>

<p>

<h4>Is It Difficult To Apply Sealants?</h4>
<p>

No.  Your dentist may use a special instrument to apply the plastic sealant on your teeth. 
Most often, it is a painless treatment that lasts for many months.<p>

<p>

<h4>Who Should Get Sealants?</h4>
<p>

Sealants are most effective in reducing cavities in children with newly formed permanent teeth. 
They are useful in cutting down formation of decay in adult teeth, as well.  An application of
sealants is a preventive measure to keep teeth healthy.  It is an effective way to reduce the
need for fillings and more expensive treatments that may be required to repair the damage
from cavities, so sealants can also save you money.<p>

<p>

<h4>Ask your CDA dentist whether sealants would be an appropriate treatment
for you and your children.</h4>

<h2>Cepillese, Use El Hilo Dental Sellese Los Dientes</h2>
<p>

<h4>Tres Maneras De Prevenir Las Caries</h4>
<p>

Con la ayuda de su dentista, resultara todavia mas facil prevenir el deterioro de los dientes.
Quizas usted ya sabe que cepillarse los dientes y pasarse el hilo dental a diario constituyen las
armas mas importantes contra la formacion de la placa dental, que es la causa principal de las
caries. Ademas de la rutina cotidiana de lavarse los dientes y pasarse el hilo dental, su dentista
puede aplicar una capa de material plastico - llamado sellador - sobre las superficies de los
dientes usados para morder. Esta capa de plastico crea una barrera entre sus dientes y los
acidos, y no deja entrar las bacterias que viven en la placa dental que causan el deteriroro de
los dientes.<p>

<p>

<h4>Que Es La Placa Dental Y Por Que Causa Caries?</h4>
<p>

Cuando usted o sus ninos comen o beben durante el dia, la comida se combina con las
bacterias que estan dentro de la boca para formar una pelicula pegajosa que se llama placa
dental, la cual se deposita entre los dientes sobre la superficie (esmalte). La placa se encuentra
mayormente sobre la superficie de las muelas traseras que se usan para masticar, de donde es
dificil quitarla con solo cepillarse y pasarse el hilo dental. Si la placa no es quitada
regularmente de los dientes, puede producir acidos que atacan el esmalte y dar lugar a hoyos y
cavidades (caries) en los dientes. Esto causa deterioro de los dientes.<p>

<p>

<h4>Como Pueden Los Selladores Prevenir Las Caries?</h4>
<p>

Al recubrir sus dientes con un material plastico resbaloso es mas dificil que la placa se pegue a
los pequenos surcos de las superficies para masticar - reduciendo asi el riesgo de que se formen
caries.<p>

<p>

<h4>Es Dificil Aplicar Selladores?</h4>
<p>

No. Probablemente su dentista usara un instrumento especial para aplicar el sellador plastico
sobre sus dientes. La mayoria de las veces es un tratamiento que no duele y dura muchos
meses.<p>

<p>

<h4>Quien Debe Usar Selladores?</h4>
<p>

Los selladores dan los mejores resultados para reducir las caries en ninos con dientes
permanentes recientement formados. Tambien son utiles en reducir la formacion de deterioro
de los dientes en adultos. Una aplicacion de selladores es una medida preventiva para mantener
su dentadura sana. Es una manera eficaz de reducir la necesidad de empastes y de tratamientos
mas caros que podrian ser necesarios para reparar los danos producidos por las caries, y por lo
tanto, los selladores le pueden ahorrar dinero.<p>

<p>

<h4>Preguntele a su dentista de la ADC si los selladores constituyen un
tratamiento adeuado para usted y sus ninos.</h4>

<h2>Selecting A Health Insurance Plan</h2>
<hr>
<p>

<i>by Kelley Lanahan, Health Insurance Counselor<br>
Washington Hospital</i> <br>
<br>
In this era of managed care, buying a health insurance policy should be given the same<br>
attention and research that you might take when buying a car or a home.  Will you be getting<br>
what you need?  How do you know what you need?  Who do I ask about my health insurance?<br>
<br>
For the lay person, becoming an informed consumer in the health insurance industry is not an<br>
easy task.  Most individuals receive their health insurance benefits from their employer. <br>
Choices tend to be limited and hard to change.  It is therefore vitally important that consumers<br>

know what they are getting before they need to use it.<br>
<br>
There are some basic steps that any health insurance consumer should take before signing up<br>
with a plan and above all, it is important that consumers take the time and energy to read<br>
everything available about their health plan - from the Summary of Benefits to Provider<br>
Listing.  Knowing a health plan inside and out will make for fewer misunderstandings and<br>
disappointments with the type of health care an individual can receive.<br><P>
<font size="+2">"Know what they are buying before they use it."</font><br><P>

<b>Step One: Self Evaluation</b><br>
<br>
What issues in your lifestyle might affect your health?  Are you fairly healthy?  Will you have<br>
dependents?  Basic questions like these will help form a rough structure of what types of<br>
health needs an individual might have.  <br>
<br>
<B>Step Two: What Services Are Needed?</B><br>
<br>
Once the self evaluation process is completed, decide what types of services might be needed. <br>
For example, for families with children, having the availability of pediatric specialists could<br>
be considered important.  Pay particularly close attention to areas of coverage that concern<br>
you most.  These are areas that may vary considerably from one plan to another.<br>
<br>
<B>Step Three: Who Can I Go To?</B><br>
<br>
Consumers are often confused by insurance terms such as "PPO" and "provider lists".  Are<br>
you limited to the doctors on the insurance company's list?  Can you choose outside the list? <br>
Are there additional "out of plan" costs?<br>
<br>
Access to these providers is another important issue that should be researched and understood. <br>
If you want to see a specialist, will you have to have a referral from a primary provider? <br>
Does the practitioner offer convenient office hours?  How long does it take to schedule an<br>
appointment?  How far is the doctor from where you live or work?<br>
<br>
<B>Step Four: Reputation</B><br>
<br>
Consumers should always review the performance of any insurance plan they consider buying. <br>
There are many organizations that rate insurance companies and their performance.  Just as<br>
with any other major purchase, consumers must "shop around" for the best value for their<br>
dollar.<br>
<br>
Of equal importance is word-of-mouth referrals.  Was the practitioner recommended by<br>
someone whose opinion you trust?  Did the office personnel do a good job when helping your<br>
family member sort out a billing issue?  It is important to remember that just as each<br>
individual's health needs are different are their perceptions of just exactly what is quality<br>
service.<br>
<br>
<b>Step Five: Cost</B><br>
<p>

When considering costs, it is important to look at what the total estimated cost will be.  Tally<br>
the total expected costs of co-payments, premiums, estimated share-of-cost payments and<br>
deductibles to arrive at a reasonable cost estimate per year.  Individuals should remember that<br>
most PPO and indemnity plans also have a maximum out-of-pocket cost that when met, will<br>
allow the individual one hundred percent coverage for all future expenses for that year of<br>
coverage.<br>
<br>
Also of importance to review what the maximum annual and lifetime coverages are.  While a<br>
maximum lifetime cap seems like a large sum, certain procedures may be expensive to treat<br>
and quickly deplete this amount.<br>
<br>
<b>Finally:</B><br>
<br>
Read everything.  Read the fine print.  Read it again.  Be certain you understand what are<br>
your covered benefits and how you can access those benefits.  Do not wait until you or a<br>
family member have an urgent need to do this.  If you need help understanding your policy,<br>
ask your human resources representative, your broker or the insurance company itself.  Be<br>
positive that you have the best coverage for you and your individual health needs.<br>

<b>TAX CREDIT PROPOSED FOR UNINSURED CHILDREN</b> from Washington Post<p>



<i>Sacramento Bee</i>, A17, 12/08/96<p>


Looking for a more measured way to expand health care to those without it, congressional
Democrats have decided to make medical coverage for uninsured children one of their top
legislative priorities in the new Congress.  The proposals, now being drafted by the Senate,
essentially could create a new class of federal social support.  Some of the initiatives would offer a
tax credit to help families buy their children health care policies, while others would offer a direct
federal subsidy.<p>

<b>MOST FEDS STICK WITH FEE-FOR-SERVICE PLANS</b> by Mike Causey<p>



<i>Sacramento Bee, </i>D2, 12/08/96<p>


Most federal workers and nearly all retirees are in fee-for-service health plans, even though they
have higher premiums and higher out-of-pocket costs than most health maintenance
organizations.  Unlike managed-care HMOs, fee-for-service plans offer greater choices of doctors
and hospitals and greater patient control.  Fee-for-service plans are good nationwide.  HMOs limit
out-of-area coverage to emergencies (such as heart attacks) or accidents.<p>

<b>MOVING 'ROUNDS'</b> by Yvonne Chiu<p>



<i>Sacramento Bee</i>, F1, 12/07/96<p>



When doctors make their rounds at Kaiser hospitals, it's not the usual group of clinic physicians
checking up on their patients.  Instead, they're members of Kaiser's own hospital staff -- and
they're in the forefront of a national trend aimed at limiting the role of primary care doctors in
hospitals.  Two of the area's largest physician groups -- Kaiser Foundation and Med-Clinic --
have been moving over in stages to this system as other medical groups and hospitals across the
country do so as well.<p>

London doctors fear they may have encountered a new "superbug" -- a bacterium that not only
resists antibiotics but thrives on them.  Doctors indicate that the bug has taken the ultimate
evolutionary step by  actually becoming dependent on an antibiotic.<p>

<b>SUPREME COURT TO RULE ON INTERNET FREE-SPEECH CASE</b> by Joan Biskupic<p>

<p>
<i>Sacramento Bee</i>, A1, 12/07/96<p>

<p>

Setting the stage for a landmark ruling on free speech and the Internet, the Supreme Court
announced Friday that it would decide the constitutionality of a new federal law that restricts
indecent materials on the computer network that connects millions of people around the globe. 
The court will consider reviving the Communications Decency Act, which passed Congress in
March but was ruled unconstitutional almost immediately on First Amendment grounds.<p>

<b>POWERFUL MEDICATIONS FOR CHOLESTEROL POSE A PARADOX FOR HMOS</b>
by Ron Winslow<p>

<p>

<i>Wall Street Journal, </i>A1, 12/06/96<p>

<p>

In recent weeks, Merck &amp; Co. and Bristol-Meyers Squibb Corp. (the two leading statin makers),
and Warner-Lambert Co. and Pfizer Inc. (which are awaiting regulatory approval to co-market a
new entry) have aggressively framed a heated debate with saturation-marketing campaigns.  One
new ad shows children's homemade cards for "Dad" and says: "You'd Give Your Life for Them. 
But That's Not What They Want.  They Just Want You to Stay Healthy."  The kicker:
"Pravochol From Bristol-Meyers Squibb . . . Proven to Help Prevent a <i>First</i> Heart Attack."  The
companies thus are bypassing doctors and health-maintenance organizations -- their usual
marketing channels -- to appeal directly to millions of consumers.  Sales, and profits, are surging.<p>

<b>CPI CHANGE WOULD AFFECT EVERYONE</b> by Kathy Kristof<p>

<p>

<i>Los Angeles Times</i>, D1, 12/06/96<p>

<p>

The consumer price index -- a pivotal gauge of inflation in America -- is likely to undergo
substantial technical revisions as the result of a detailed new study concluding that the index
consistently overstates the true rate of inflation.  If the index is changed as the report
recommends, there would be a dramatic effect on virtually every American, working or retired. 
As it pertains to health care, doctors and hospitals would experience income losses because
Medicare, the national health insurance system for the elderly, bases changes in medical
reimbursement rates on CPI changes.<p>

<b>LARGE CLAIMS IN GROUP MEDICAL INSURANCE REVEAL SOME SURPRISES</b><p>

<p>

<i>Wall Street Journal</i>, A1, 12/01/96<p>

<p>

More men than women are high-cost claimants, despite the fact that women spend more dollars
on health care than men do until about age 50, says a report by the Society of Actuaries,
Schaumbur, Ill.  The study, which defines large claims as those of $25,000 and higher, examined
171,000 claims paid by insurers from 1991 and 1992 that totaled $10 billion.  The society hopes
the data will help shape public policy on health care.<p>

<b>HEART MEDICATION COULD SAVE LIVES FOLLOWING SURGERY</b> by Ron
Winslow<p>

<p>

<i>Wall Street Journal, </i>B6, 12/05/96<p>

<p>

Aggressive use of an inexpensive blood pressure medicine could save the lives of thousands of
patients whose heart problems put them at high risk of death after surgery, a new study suggests. 
Some three million patients with heart disease undergo surgery for other reasons in the U.S. each
year and many of them suffer heart attacks in the weeks following their operations.  Researchers
at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center found that giving patients atenolol, a widely
used drug know as a beta blocker, to slow their heart rate reduced their death rate over two years
by more than 50% compared with patients given a placebo.<p>

Proposed federal regulations banning smoking in workplaces would devastate Nevada's tourism-driven economy, costing the state tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in lost revenue,
according to a study released yesterday.  "If this regulation is enacted, Nevada's economy could
lose between $1.9 billion and $3.5 billion in the next five years," Brian Herr, president of the

<p>

While trying to set last year's pay for HealthSouth Corp. Chairman Richard Scrushy, one director
fretted that the nearly $7 million in salary and bonus was making him the highest-paid chief in the
state.  Mr. Scrushy doesn't see it as a problem.  "I'd like to be the highest-paid CEO in the
world," he says.  His business strategy is fairly simple, but with a twist.  In a health-care climate
where low cost is king, HealthSouth has established a chain of rehabilitation and surgery centers,
mostly outpatient, that can perform a wide array of procedures more cheaply than hospitals can. 
HealthSouth is the first health-care company to own facilities in all 50 states.<p>

<b>WHO TO TRUST: DRUG COMPANIES OR YOUR DOCTOR?</b> By Philip Alper<p>

<p>

<i>Wall Street Journal</i>, A18, 12/04/96<p>

<p>

In the past, new drugs were introduced into physician armamentariums in a gradual way.  Doctors
read the literature, attended conferences, were "detailed," and checked with colleagues.  Some
used the new drug sooner than others, but rare complications often became known even before
many doctors had introduced it into their own practices.  All this has changed with the rapid pace
of new-drug introductions and their accompanying market blitzes.  The aim is to create consumer
demand even before the doctor would be willing to use the drug spontaneously.<p>

The growth in Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, elderly and disabled, has
slowed from recent double-digit levels and should average 7.4 percent through 2002, a study
sponsored by the Kaiser Commission on the Future of Medicaid said yesterday.  It predicts that
slower enrollment, slower growth per  beneficiary and reform in Medicaid payments to some
hospitals will reduce expected program growth.<p>

<p>

For the price of a phone call, people in Boston can now learn once-secret details about their
doctors, like how much money they have paid to settle malpractice suits or which hospitals have
restricted their privileges out of competency concerns.  In California, it is literally illegal for the
government to divulge this information to the public.  The same is true in every other state --
except for Massachusetts.  An extraordinary political event -- doctors lobbying legislators to
release more, not less, sensitive information about themselves -- has made this state an experiment
in openness that is being closely watched in California.<p>

<b>ERGONOMIC RULE WOULD BE PAIN WITH NO GAIN</b> by Shirley Knight<p>

<p>

Would you buy an expensive medicine just because the guy down the street said it was sure to
make you feel better?  Probably not.  But California is about to get a very expensive prescription,
with about the same assurance of results.  Physicians who treat injuries such as carpel tunnel
syndrome say we don't know what causes them or how to prevent them.  So we have a
"prescription," courtesy of professional bureaucrats, for a condition that medical professionals still
don't understand.  And when I say this prescription is expensive, I mean billion of dollars to
implement it.<p>

<p>

The Food and Drug Administration asked a federal court in Greensboro to turn down a tobacco

stunned the tobacco industry in August by giving the FDA extensive new regulatory powers over
cigarettes in a bid to curb smoking among children.<p>

Tobacco companies being sued by the state of Minnesota won't get state records about gambling
and its addictive qualities, according to a state court ruling last week.  Judge Kenneth Fitzpatrick,
in a decision late Friday, said the companies' current request is too broad.  He also denied a
tobacco company request to set the trial date for September 1998 and instead chose the state's
request for Jan. 19, 1998.<p>

<b>SHOULD WE GET OUR MONEY BACK IF DOCTORS FAIL?</b> by Stephen Cohen<p>

<p>

There's a new twist in the baby-making business, and it comes with a money-back guarantee.  In a
move that has some doctors up in arms, fertility clinics in Minnesota and California are offering to
guarantee that their patients will have babies -- or they'll get their money back.  It's an
unconventional concept, to say the least, and it highlights a growing trend in which the health-care
marketplace is beginning to resemble a one-day sale at Macy's.  In this case, fertility clinics are
offering substantial refunds to patients who do not get pregnant or who fail to maintain their
pregnancy for at least 3 to 6 months.<p>

Your medical records, the private history of your physical health, may be yours by right but not by
law.  "Only 28 states currently have laws granting people the right to see their medical records.  A
lot of states are silent on this," says Kathleen Frawley, vice president of the American Health

Investors have clobbered the shares of health-care information-service companies in recent
months because of big earnings disappointments in the September quarter.  But while Wall Street
analysts identify the factors  leading to these shortfalls as company-specific, they also say that the
sector's extremely rapid growth and high valuations help explain why the letdowns have been so

<p>

When you join a managed health-care plan, you can forget all about doctor's bills, insurance
forms and costly deductibles, right?  Wrong, at least for the growing number of people choosing
so-called point-of-service plans during the annual fall benefit-enrollment period at employers
across the country.  Many people like these plans, because they offer the savings of managed care
and the freedom of traditional insurance.  But because they're really two plans in one, it's
important that you and your insurer agree on which course you have taken.<p>

Republicans and Democrats both played exaggeration politics with Medicare during the
presidential campaign.  With the election over, both sides are talking cooperation.  But there's a
lack of any clear sense of how to proceed.  Even setting up a bipartisan commission to study ways
to put the program back on the path to solvency, which once seemed the ideal solution since it
was backed both Presidents Clinton and Bob Dole, is losing appeal.<p>

Summary:  Researchers have widely praised efforts in Woodridge, Ill., and scores of

Summary:  America's crusade against tobacco is losing ground on at least one front.  Cigar
smoking, which
fell steadily during the 1970s and 1980s, has become chic among a new and affluent class of
Americans whose growing taste for the big weed has caused a huge backlog of orders and, in
turn, higher prices.  Many people assume (wrongly) that because cigars are not usually
inhaled,
they're not harmful.  An affluent new generation sees cigars, like fine wines and elegant
clothing,
as a status symbol.<p>

<p>

Summary:  <u>Casper &amp; Bartin:</u>  As managed care spreads, it is imposing a
new law of the
jungle on health care: survival of the cheapest.  The pressures of cost
containment, the push to find short-term savings at the expense of long-term
investment, put at particular risk a vital segment of health care: university-based
research and teaching hospitals, which can never be the cheapest because they
invest so heavily in the future. <p>

<p>

          <u>Andreopoulos:</u>  The French have a saying, "Plus c'a change, plus
c'est la meme
chose."  The more things change, the more they are the same.  That seems to
be the case with the merger of Stanford and UCSF medical centers, promoted
as a novel idea and necessary for survival in the cutthroat health care market. 
Actually, Stanford and UC first tried to combine their medical schools and
hospitals in 1914.  Both schools faced severe fiscal problems, and a merger
seemed the right thing to do.  Talks went on for months.  They finally broke
down when both sides concluded that they could not legally combine a public
and private institution.<p>

Summary:  Bypassing a growing legal dispute over the organization of managed care health
plans, the Supreme Court on Monday refused to
hear a case on whether states can insist that networks open their doors to any doctor who
wants to practice within the group. 
These plans (PPOs) meet their cost-saving goals only if each doctor can maintain the high
patient load needed to make the
reduced per-patient fees economically attractive.<p>

medical treatment will be on the ballot Tuesday in California, and recent polls suggest that both are headed for easy defeat. 
Indeed, most Californians seem barely aware of the initiatives.<br>

<B> Network of Doctors, Touted as a Panacea, Develops Big Problems - Nikhil Deogun
</B><I> 

     The Wall Street Journal -- 9/26/96 -- A1</I><P>


     Steven Scott had a simple prescription for profiting from the changes roiling the
nation's health-care system: Gather together as many doctors as possible and let them run the
show.   They did - but the show flopped.  Coastal Physician Group Inc. was a pioneer in the
business of building networks of physician practices.  Dr. Scott, its founder, was hailed as a
visionary.  Today, his dream of a physician-led revolution has turned into a nightmare.  Major
clients and top executives have fled.  Coastal is abandoning many of its businesses, selling
clinics and trying to resuscitate its original activity, staffing hospitals.

<B>Big Deal For Bio-Dental  </B><I>

      The Sacramento Bee -- 9/19/96 -- D2</I><P>

      Bio-Dental Technologies Corp., a Rancho Cordova-based manufacturer and distributor
of dental supplies, said Wednesday it has signed a three-year agreement with California Dental
Health Plan, a division of Cypress-based Pacificare Health Systems.  Bio-Dental will provide
discounted dental supplies and technologies to California Dental's managed care network of
more than 3,500 dentists under the agreement.  The company said these dentists collectively
buy about $49 million in dental supplies annually.

<B>     Rinse Your Way to Health Teeth</B><I>

      The Sacramento Bee -- 9/18/96 -- D3</I><P>

        If you can't brush your teeth after a meal, rinse your mouth with water, advises the
Academy of General Dentistry.  The rinsing will neutralize acids that can erode tooth enamel
and will reduce decay-causing bacteria by 30 percent

<B>     Health Care Initiatives Lagging -- Sabin Russell</B><I>

      San Francisco Chronicle -- 9/17/96 -- A2</I><P>

      Two California initiatives taking aim at health maintenance organizations have made
little impression on state voters and have little support among those who are familiar with
them, according to a new Field Poll.  The poll by the San Francisco-based Field Institute
found that 69 percent of probable voters were unaware of either Proposition 214, which
backers call the HMO Patients Rights Initiative, or Proposition 216, which supporters call the
Patient Protection Act.  Among the 31 percent that knew of either measure, voters were
inclined to reject them by a 2-to-1 ratio.  But the informed voters represented only a fraction
of the electorate: 10 percent of the probable voters favor the initiatives, and 5 percent opposed
them.

<B>      HMO Mergers Brewing</B><I>

      The Sacramento Bee -- 9/17/96 -- C1</I><P>

      Two more merger deals involving big managed health care companies are in the works. 
California-based Foundation Health Corp., which runs HMOs and other health networks in 10
states serving 3 million people, said it is discussing a stock-swap merger but wouldn't name
the partner.  In the second deal, two of the most respectful nonprofit HMOs - Oakland-based
Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound said they have begun merger talks.

<B> `1201' Invites You to Open Wide and Say `Ahh' -- Mike Dunne</B><I>

     The Sacramento Bee -- 9/6/96 -- Ticket 12</I><P>

     The prospect of dining at a restaurant owned by dentists conjures up all sorts of
worrisome images.  Before being seated will we have to wait interminably in a lobby with
nothing but 4-year-old copies of Newsweek to amuse us?  Good grief, will they even serve
dessert at all?  Will the bill be accompanied by a sample packet of floss?
     Put your fears aside if your destination is the new Restaurant 1201 on the ground floor
of the downtown Sacramento skyscraper commonly know as the Ban Roll-on Building.  Both
the restaurant and the building are owned and operated by the California Dental Association. 
Before we get to the toothsome food - sorry - there's something else you need to know of
Restaurant 1201: Contrary to the image of dentists as a fairly conservative lot, this place bucks
the trend of quick, casual and cheap cafes.  For the first time in several years, a restaurant has
opened downtown with big tables, Chippendale-style chairs, damask linens and other formal
and stylish touches. They've assembled a busy and ambitious menu, with dishes ranging from
updated versions of the classics to more fashionable entrees out of the country's hottest
culinary region, the Pacific Northwest.  Clearly, this is no dental office, although awaiting
you in the restroom is a bottle of mint-flavored mouthwash presented prominently on a slab of
rough-cut marble.

<B>     Doctors' Pay Falls for the First Time on Record -- Associated Press</B><I>

     The Sacramento Bee -- 9/3/96 -- D1</I><P>

     After years of climbing salaries, physicians are seeing their earnings drop in large part
because managed care has worked to control costs.  "This is a remarkable turnaround," said
Carol Simon, an economics professor at the university of Illinois and co-author of a new
study.  "This is the first time we've seen a reduction in take-home pay." It hasn't gone
unnoticed by doctors, especially specialists, whose incomes have fallen the sharpest.  With an
average income of $187,000 in 1994, doctors were still among the highest-paid workers in
America.  But that was 4 percent less than in 1993, according to the report published in the
journal of Health Affairs.  It's the first decrease since statistics were first compiled in 1982. 
On average income has risen nearly 6 percent annually; 2.2 percent when inflation is taken
into account.  Managed care gets much of the blame - or credit - depending on the point of
view, for the drop.

<B> Drug Reaction Blamed for Boy's Death -- Marshall Wilson</B><I>

     San Francisco Chronicle -- 8/23/96 -- A30</I><P>

     The San Mateo County coroner has determined that a 5-year-old San Carlos boy died
in June from a rare reaction to drugs given before a dental procedure.  "It's one of those
one-in-a-million things that happen," Deputy Coroner Steve Hortin said yesterday. "There's
no
indication of negligence on (the dentist's) part."  Benjamin Shimshock died June 26 after being
given medications at a Burlingame oral surgeon's office.  The cause of death is respiratory
failure caused by "apparent idiosyncratic reaction to sedative medication," Hortin said.  The
boy was given the drugs Robinul, Versed and Brevital.  Dr. David Rothman, a pediatric
dentist and a spokesman for the California Dental Association, said the drugs are commonly
used.  He said the doses Benjamin was given were "very, very low," and that a reaction is
extremely rare.  Benjamin had no history of medical problems or allergies, Hortin said.  The
boy experienced a reaction in the dentist's chair at about 8:15a.m. and was rushed to
Peninsula Hospital, where he died.

     The nation's most prominent HMO watchdog group unveiled a plan Wednesday that it
said would provide Americans with a way to evaluate and compare health maintenance
organizations.  Under the "Quality Compass" program, the National Committee for Quality
Assurance has formulated written tables and computer programs to help evaluate 226 different
health care systems that currently serve 28 million people.

<B>     President Signs Modest Reform of Health Care -- Washington Post</B><I>

     In a gala ceremony on the White House lawn yesterday, President Clinton signed
health care legislation he said will "seal the cracks" that have allowed insurance companies to
deny coverage to Americans who get sick or lose their jobs.  The bipartisan Health  Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 makes it easier for workers to carry their health
insurance from job to job and strictly limits the ability of insurance companies to deny
coverage to Americans with pre-existing conditions.

<B> Television Ads Attack Pair of Anti-HMO Initiatives -- Carl T. Hall </B><I>

     San Francisco Chronicle -- 8/15/96 -- B1</I><P>

     The same folks who helped turn the Clinton health insurance plan into a laughingstock
are now trying to do the same to a pair of anti-HMO initiatives on the California ballot this
fall.  Attack ads ridiculing Propositions 214 and 216 began airing on television stations
throughout the state this week.  With three months to go before Election Day, the beleaguered
managed care industry promises a fierce self-defense campaign.  Backers of the two measures
-- which include labor unions, consumer groups and patient advocates - say they lack the
financial firepower to respond in kind.  Although some limited major media ads are planned,
they will come much closer to the election.  The message from the HMOs is simple: "No
matter what you think about managed care, these two initiatives make things worse," said
Janet Maira, spokeswoman for the industry-financed Taxpayers Against Higher Health Costs,
a coalition of health-care interests financing the new TV commercials.

 <B>    Bracing For Orthodontia -- Laurie Castaneda</B><I>

     San Francisco Chronicle -- 8/12/96 -- B1</I><P>

     Braces take a big bite out of a family's budget.  And to top things off, kids nowadays
are starting orthodontics earlier and getting treatment for longer periods of time.  When most
of today's parents were young, getting braces was a relatively simple process that usually
started around age 12.  To make more room for crowded teeth, the patient had some
permanent teeth pulled, then wore braces for about two years.  While some orthodontists and
parents still opt for the old one-step procedure, about 80 percent of cases now involve a
two-phase process that takes more time, money and office visits.  Instead of extracting
permanent
teeth, younger children's jaws are expanded using a variety of mouth appliances while they
still have all or most of their baby teeth.  This process starts around age 7 to 9 and takes about
1.5 years.  Next, patients wear a retainer or a holding wire until all or most their permanent
teeth have come in.  At that time, patients usually get a full set of braces and wear them for an
additional two years on average.

<B> Activists Protest Animal Research</B><I>

     The Daily Breeze (Torrance) -- 8/11/96 -- B4</I><P>

     Animal rights activists protested noisily outside Moscone Center on Saturday,
condemning Procter & Gamble for using animals in laboratory research.  About two dozen
protesters, including one in a bunny suit, held up signs that read "There's no excuse for
animal abuse" and "Demand Alternatives," as they handed out pamphlets to dentists and
dental health care workers attending an annual convention.  Procter & Gamble is one of the
participants in the three-day scientific meeting of dental health professionals, sponsored by the
California Dental Association.  Protester Joy Meininger has boycotted P&G products, which
range from laundry detergents to cooking oil, for more than 10 years.  She said she thinks
animal testing is not only cruel, but a waste of money as well.  But P&G spokesman Don
Tassone said animal testing is essential to ensure product safety for humans.

<B>     State Can Regulate Fillings -- Brett Johnson</B><I>

     Ventura County Star -- 8/10/96 -- A1</I><P>

     Signs warning of mercury levels in fillings might soon be a nerve-touching addition to
the normal angst of visiting your dentist's office, thanks to an appellate court ruling this week. 
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled Monday that the Environmental
Law foundation can file a suit to require warnings for fillings containing dental amalgam, a
mixture of mercury and adhesives.  The legal twist comes after years of studies and
controversy over amalgam fillings.  Health activists say the public deserves to know about
possible effects of mercury, which is on a state list of chemicals known to cause birth defects. 
Dental groups, however, say the danger to the public is minuscule.  Both sides cite various
studies.  The signs are unnecessary, said Caroline Turner, executive director of the
Santa-Barbara Ventura County Dental Society, which represents 600 member dentists in the
two
counties.

<B> House Approves Health-Insurance Bill as Both Parties Take Credit for
     Measure -- Laurie McGinley</B><I>

     The Wall Street Journal -- 8/2/96 -- A16</I><P>

     Long-awaited legislation to improve access to health insurance was approved by
the House, 421-2, as politicians scrambled to claim credit for the popular election-year
measure.  At an afternoon news conference, House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.),
said the legislation, which will make it easier for workers to keep coverage when they
change jobs or get sick, is a "direct descendant" of earlier Republican health proposals.

<B>     Health-Care Costs for Employers Slow Dramatically -- Robert
Rosenblatt</B><I>

     Los Angeles Times -- 8/1/96 -- D1</I><P>

     In a startling shift, health care is becoming a bargain for employers as inflation
disappears and more of health care's financial burden is shifted to workers, the Labor
Department reported Wednesday.  The cost of health care for business rose a
minuscule 0.1% during the year ending in June, the lowest medical inflation rate in 13
years of record-keeping, according to a social department study.

<h1><center>Do The Impossible...  Create A Dental
Plan That Makes Everyone Smile!</h1>
<hr>
<p>

</center>
<p>

Some people think that a dental benefit plan that pleases both employers and employees is
about as likely as turning a frog into a prince.  They've jumped to the wrong conclusion. 
Large and small employers across the nation are using a simple, cost-effective strategy for
providing dental benefits.  It's called Direct Reimbursement.<p>

<p>

<h2><center>Direct Reimbursement: It's Not The Traditional
Story</h2>
</center>
<p>

Traditional dental plans attempt to contain costs by limiting services, treatment and even
providers.  Direct Reimbursement, on the other hand, reduces costs by eliminating third-party
involvement in the benefits payment process.  It is self-funding strategy that allows employers
to administer their own in-house dental plan.  Here's how it works.  Employees covered by
Direct Reimbursement:<p>

<p>

1.  Go to the dentist of their choice, <p>

2.  Pay for the treatment.<p>

3.  Present a paid receipt to their employer.<p>

<p>

The employer then pays dental benefits directly to employees by reimbursing them for all, or a
portion of, expenses up to a predetermined maximum benefit allowance.<p>

<p>

<h2><center>Direct Reimbursement Everybody Wins</h2>
</center>
<p>

<h3>Direct Reimbursement Is Cost Effective</h3>
<p>

Direct Reimbursement often costs 25-35 percent less than fully insured dental plans.  That's
because Direct Reimbursement eliminates costly overhead expenses such as sales commissions,
insurance company profits and third party administrative fees.  And because employees are
reimbursed only for actual expenses, no premium monies are wasted on unused benefits.<p>

<p>

<h3>Direct Reimbursement Is Simple</h3>
<p>

With Direct Reimbursement there are usually no deductibles and few, if any, treatment
exclusions.  Benefits are generally stated as a percentage of actual dental expenses up to an
annual maximum benefit allowance.  Because employees understand how expenses will be
reimbursed, confusion and complaints are virtually eliminated.<p>

<p>

<h3>Direct Reimbursement Is Flexible</h3>
<p>

Employers can tailor a plan to meet the specific needs of their group and their budget. 
Companies converting to Direct Reimbursement can mirror the benefits of their previous plan. 
Groups that have never offered a dental plan can begin conservatively and increase benefits in
their second or third plan year.  <p>

<p>

<h3>Direct Reimbursement Allows Freedom of Choice</h3>
<p>

Direct Reimbursement preserves what surveys show employees feel is the most important
aspect of a dental plan - the right to choose their own dentist.<p>

<p>

<h3>Direct Reimbursement: A Common Sense Approach</h3>
<p>

Direct Reimbursement encourages employees to get involved in their own care.  It allows
employees and dentists to agree on treatment plans that are clinically appropriate and cost
effective.  Unlike traditional plan, Direct Reimbursement does not insulate employees form
dental care costs.  As employees save money, so do their employers.<p>

<p>

<h2><center>Look To Us For Help</h2>
</center>
<p>

Direct Reimbursement gets to the heart of what employees and employers want: Simple, cost
effective, non-restrictive dental benefits.  Remember, when you opt for Direct
Reimbursement, your dental benefit dollars <i>go directly to paying for care,</i> not for insurance
company overhead and profits.<p>

<h3>What is Direct Reimbursement?</h3>
Direct Reimbursement is a self-funding strategy that allows employers to provide dental benefits
without insurance company involvement.  Here's how it works:<p>

<b>Employees covered by Direct Reimbursement:</b><p>

1.	Visit the dentist of their choice<br>

2.  	Pay for treatment<br>

3.	Present a paid receipt to their employer who then reimburses them for covered expenses.<p>

<hr>
<p>

<h3>Does Direct Reimbursement reduce costs?</h3>
Yes!  If an employer provides benefits through a fully-insured dental plan, as much as one-third of
the premium may be applied to administrative costs.  With Direct Reimbursement, no insurance
company makes a profit, no sales agent makes a commission.  The elimination of such overhead
expenses often results in savings off 25 to 35 percent.<p>

<hr>
<p>

<h3>What are other advantages of Direct Reimbursement?  </h3>
<h4>Simplicity - </b>Employees are reimbursed for a portion for their expenses up to a maximum
benefit allowance.  Usually there are no deductibles and few, if any, excluded treatment
procedures.<b></h4>
<h4>Right to Choose - </b>Direct Reimbursement preserves employees' right to receive treatment from
the dentist of their choice.<b></h4>
<h4>Flexibility - </b>Employers tailor benefits to meet their budget allocations.  Many employers who
thought they could never afford dental plans are now offering attractive benefits through Direct
Reimbursement.<b></h4>
<hr>
<p>

<h3>How does Direct Reimbursement benefit dentists?</h3>
Direct Reimbursement eliminates insurance company intrusions.  You and your patients make
treatment decisions based on their individual needs.  Direct Reimbursement eliminates:<p>

<p>

	"pre-authorization of treatment" disputes<br>

	"least expensive alternative treatment" limitations<br>

	fee disputes resulting from out-dated UCR Tables<p>

<hr>
<p>

<h3>What do employees think of Direct Reimbursement?</h3>
Employees appreciate the ability to make their own decisions.  Direct Reimbursement allows them
the freedom to see the dentist of their choice and the ability to receive the treatment they feel is in
their best interest.  Since they are not insulated from costs, they have an incentive to ask questions
and explore treatment options.  This leads to healthy communication between patients and
doctors.<p>

<hr>
<p>

<h3>How can you help?</h3>
Because Direct Reimbursement eliminates insurance company profits, few insurance brokers
promote the concept.  Employers will not hear about Direct Reimbursement unless you tell them. 
Here's how you can help.<p>

1.	Keep Direct Reimbursement promotional materials in your office so you can share information
with interested patients.  If you need materials, contact CDA at 1-800-736-7071, ext. 4480. <p>

2.	Involve your office staff.  Discuss Direct Reimbursement in staff meetings on a regular basis. 
Encourage your staff members to recommend Direct Reimbursement to any patient experiencing
insurance company payment difficulties.  Post CDA's "Employer Referral" sticker on your phone
and instruct staff to contact CDA any time they speak to a DR prospect.<p>

3.	Identify patients and friends who are in decision-making positions where they work.  Recommend
they consider Direct Reimbursement the next time they review their employee benefits package. 
(Tip: One dentist gem-clips a Direct Reimbursement brochure into the chart of each patient who
is a business owner or manager.  This is his reminder to share information about Direct
Reimbursement during the patient's next office visit.)<p>

<h2>Direct reimbursement benefits dentists, too</h2>
<hr>
<p>

<p>

<h3>California dentists are introducing the concept of direct
reimbursement to patients and employers.</h3>
<p>

As some of the dentists in California are finding out, the concept of direct reimbursement
offers a viable alternative to traditional, dental-insurance plans.  And it is proving to be
effective in alleviating typical insurance headaches for patients, employers and dentists.<p>

<p>

Convinced of its benefits, California dentists like David Blende, William Van Dyk and Bill
Cannon are taking it upon themselves to introduce the concept of direct reimbursement to
patients and employers.  And the doctors are receiving strong support from organized
dentistry at local and state levels.<p>

<p>

<h4>The Concept Defined</h4>
<p>

As defined by Douglas Bush, director of Dental Benefits Consulting for the California Dental
Association, direct reimbursement is a self-funding strategy that allows employers to pay
dental benefits directly to employees by reimbursing them for dental expenses.  This
eliminates the middle man, namely the insurance company.<p>

<p>

In marked contrast to traditional plans, explains Bush, a direct-reimbursement plan usually has
a simple, easily-understood and administered benefits schedule, which often is a single
reimbursement rate, regardless of the type of dental treatment.  It also gives an employee the
right to choose his/her own dentist while allowing employers the flexibility to tailor benefits to
meet budget allocations without worrying about insurance-premium increases.<p>

<p>

A direct-reimbursement plan is more than just a self-insured plan, emphasizes Bush.  Some
benefit consultants call direct reimbursement the "purest form of self-insurance."  The fact is,
while most companies with more than 100 employees have self-insured dental plans, many are
administered by insurance companies and subject to traditional-insurance headaches.  All
direct-reimbursement plans are self-insured, but not all self-insured plans are direct
reimbursement.<p>

<p>

<h4>Dentists as Advocates</h4>
<p>

Mari Edgar, the controller at PTRL West, Inc. of Richmond, California, was looking for a
dental plan that could improve the health-benefits package the company was offering its 45
employees.<p>

<p>

PTRL's problems with its existing, traditional, dental plan are common to many employers,
including dental offices.  They included having to pay premiums for benefits that many
employees do not use; having a good portion of benefit dollars going to support insurance-company overhead, commissions and charges; and having to deal with an excess of frustrating
tape.<p>

<p>

"Our existing dental-insurance plan wasn't doing much with our dollars," says Edgar.  "Our
copayment costs were more than what the dental plan was paying out.  We were funding a lot
of money into the plan but were receiving less.  Out of the $9,000 we paid into the plan in one
year, only $1,200 was paid out in claims.  It got to the point where employees weren't using
the benefit."<p>

<p>

Edgar happened to ask her dentist, Dr. Van Dyk, if he knew of any plan that could improve
PTRL's situation.  He immediately took the opportunity to introduce her to the concept of
direct reimbursement.<p>

<p>

"I learned about direct reimbursement through meetings, magazines, newsletters and
information packets provided by the California Dental Association," says Dr. Van Dyk, a
CDA member.<p>

<p>

"I was convinced direct reimbursement provided a cost-effective and easy-to-manage
alternative.  I briefly outlined the concept and its benefits to Edgar and gave her an
information packet provided by CDA.  When Edgar expressed interest in exploring the
possibility of adopting direct reimbursement, I put her in touch with Doug Bush at CDA.  His
department provided free consultation and helped her set up a direct-reimbursement-based
dental plan at PTRL."<p>

<p>

Long &amp; Levit, a 200-employee law firm in San Francisco, came to learn about direct
reimbursement through Dr. Blende, a local dentist and a CDA member.<p>

<p>

Dr. Blende came across direct reimbursement about five years ago when it was a pilot project
of the Santa Barbara-Ventura County Dental Society.  When the direct-reimbursement
promotion later was expanded to a statewide program, he volunteered to participate in the
program.  "I was convinced that direct reimbursement was a winner," says Dr. Blende.<p>

<p>

It was during a sailing vacation short time later that Dr. Blende recommended the concept to
Howard Garfield, who then was the managing partner at Long &amp; Levit.<p>

<p>

"We talked about our businesses and the topic turned to health-care costs," Dr. Blende recalls. 
"I suggested that he look into direct reimbursement.  Howard took the idea back to the law
firm.  When the firm showed interest, I put them in touch with Doug Bush at CDA.  His
department helped the firm implement a direct-reimbursement dental plan."<p>

<p>

According to Vicki Arch, benefits director of the law firm, the plan has just under 200
participants and averages about 40-45 claims per month.<p>

<p>

The firm has not added any personnel to administer the plan.  Arch spends about an hour a
week to administer and evaluate claims.  The reimbursement checks are issued by the
accounts-payable department.<p>

<p>

Dr. John Rathbone, a retired orthodontist from the Santa Barbara-Ventura County Dental
Society, is among those who pioneered direct reimbursement in California.<p>

<p>

"We first heard about direct reimbursement about 10 years ago through the American
Association of Orthodontists," says Dr. Rathbone, who continues to be active in organized
dentistry and in promoting direct reimbursement.  "I initially was interested in direct
reimbursement because traditional insurance did not cover orthodontia and direct
reimbursement offered a way employers could offer this coverage to employees.  Once I
learned more about it, I was convinced direct reimbursement offered a cost-effective solution
to many employers' dental-insurance dilemmas.  In the last six years, I must have talked to 30-35 organizations about direct reimbursement, and many of them now are enjoying its
benefits."<p>

<p>

Dr. Rathbone urges dentists to "get out there and push it.  Talk to patients who are in
administrative positions.  In my experience, it works well for companies with 100-200
employees and for nonprofit organizations.  My greatest satisfaction comes when employers
tell me how well direct reimbursement is working for them."<p>

<p>

<h4>Direct Reimbursement Works</h4>
<p>

"Direct reimbursement does work," says Garfield of Long &amp; Levit.  "[With direct
reimbursement], the employer saves money.  The employees are more satisfied because they
get to choose their own dentist and can plan their own program of care that spreads the cost of
care over time.  So, it is a win-win situation for everybody: the employer saves money, it
doesn't significantly increase administrative costs and the employees are happy.  And that is
what a benefit program is supposed to do."<p>

<p>

For PTRL too, the switch to direct reimbursement is working.  "Although at $25 per
employee, per month, we spend only a few dollars less than before, our dollars are directly
benefiting employees and not any third parties," says PTRL's Edgar.  According to Edgar,
each employee has a $1,000 annual-expense allowance.  The first $100 in benefits is
reimbursed at 100 percent; the next $200 is reimbursed at 80 percent; thereafter, the plan
reimburses at 50 percent until the maximum allowance is reached."<p>

<p>

And for Tom Hopkins Construction Company in Santa Cruz, California, the switch to a
direct-reimbursement-based dental plan was one of the very best business decisions the
company has made, according to John Sabine, the company vice president.<p>

<p>

"Now that we are two years into the plan, all of the employees are enthusiastic," says Sabine,
whose company was introduced to direct reimbursement by Dr. Cannon, a local dentist and
CDA member.  "We have been able to expand a little on the actual dental coverage,"
continues Sabine.  "For example, we allow cosmetic work to be done and we don't have
lifetime cap on orthodontic care.  We do have a $750-a-year cap [per person].   Our savings
over two years has been 60 percent [compared to a third-party insurance plan].  With the
savings, our company now has introduced vision care, a service we did not have before."<p>

<p>

<h4>Benefits</h4>
<p>

According to Dr. Blende, "Dentists should realize that direct reimbursement is a sound
concept that works for patients, employers and dentists.  It is, perhaps, the last stand against
the encroachment of dentistry by third-party payers.  The concept preserves the patient's right
to choose.  With direct reimbursement, the dentists's office does not have to deal with any
insurance paperwork.  It allows dentists to have a solid, one-on-one relationship with patients,
the kind of relationship the profession enjoyed in the '40s and '50s when dentists and patients,
and not somebody else, were able to decide that was the best care for the patient."  As Dr.
Gordon J. Christensen, a prominent proponent of direct reimbursement, explains it, direct
reimbursement is the kind of concept that allows freedom and gives people the ability to
choose for themselves the kind of oral therapy they desire.  Direct reimbursement allows a
continuation of excellent oral care because a person may elect to start with something simple
and build over the years until his/her oral care reaches a point where only slight maintenance
is required.<p>

<p>

"Most dentists have had patients tell them they can't get certain dental care because their third-party payer will not reimburse for it," continues Dr. Christensen.  "That has impeded the
progress of proper oral therapy.  On the other hand, a dentist working with patients on a
direct-reimbursement-based plan does not have this impediment.  With direct reimbursement,
the election for the type of treatment to be performed is the patient's choice, based upon the
education the dentist gives the patient."<p>

<p>

Therefore, there is no lack of ability to do proper dentistry, Dr. Chistensen reasons.  It may
be spread over a number of years, but gradually the dentist will be able to provide optimum
care for the patient who is on a direct-reimbursement plan.<p>

<p>

Some dentists may be reluctant to introduce the plan to employers because they feel that it is
too self-serving.  Dr. Christensen disagrees.  "If we believe that the patient and the dentist
together can make an educated prognosis about what should be done for a given mouth, then it
is not restrictive in any way.  It is an open, free-enterprise approach to dental care," he adds.<p>

<p>

CDA's Bush, who has been promoting the direct-reimbursement concept for over six years,
firmly believes that direct reimbursement benefits employers and employees, as well as
dentists.<p>

<p>

For example, PTRL's success with direct reimbursement has been positive for Dr. Van Dyk.<p>

<p>

"More of their employees now are coming in for dental care because of the direct-reimbursement plan, and they all seem satisfied with it," says Dr. Van Dyk.  "In addition, we
do not have to fill out extensive, insurance-reimbursement forms for each employee who
comes to us.  Preauthorization is not required.<p>

<p>

"Dental-care decisions now are left to my patients and me, not to a third party," Dr. Van Dyk
continues.  "To facilitate payment and reduce the burden on the patient, we have arranged for
the company to pay us its share directly.  The patient pays his/her portion at the time of
receiving care, and we present a bill for the remainder to the company.  Instead of waiting 60-90 days for the insurance company to pay us, now we get paid in a matter of days.  They like
it; we like it.  They benefit; we benefit."<p>

<p>

<h4>Dentists Hold Key</h4>
<p>

As more and more California dentists introduce direct reimbursement to employers, success
stories are cropping up across the state.<p>

<p>

"I lost count of the success stories a long time ago," says Bush.  "Direct reimbursement really
does allow employers to simplify and improve benefits, while still realizing significant
savings.  One of the most satisfying aspects of my job is seeing employers who have had a
great experience with the concept refer other employers to us."<p>

<p>

Although employer-to-employer referrals are welcomed, Bush contends that dentists are the
real key to a successful direct-reimbursement-promotion program.  "In California, we receive
half of our employer contacts from our member-dentists, but these referrals result in 80
percent of our implemented plans," explains Bush.  "Almost all employers entrust their dental
care to their personal dentist.  It only makes sense that these employers also value their
dentists' input regarding quality dental plans.  That's why we encourage our members to be
proactive.  Don't wait for someone to complain about his/her dental plan. Instead, go ahead
and tell that person you've got information about a plan that he/she should consider."<p>

<p>

Despite the apparent advantages, many dental practitioners are hesitant to talk about the
concept.  Bush explains that most referrals can be traced to a relatively small percentage of
CDA's membership.<p>

<p>

"I think most dentists are familiar with the basic, direct-reimbursement concept, but they don't
understand the mechanics of how it works.  There is a natural resistance to recommending a
dental-plan concept, if they are unsure of how to respond to the questions that might follow,"
says Bush.  "That is why we encourage our members to play the role of prospectors.  They
don't have to understand all of the ins and outs of direct reimbursement to introduce a business
leader to the concept.  Once the employer contacts my office, we explain the concept in
detail."<p>

<p>

And Dr.  Blende agrees.  "Dentists need not know the 'nut and bolts' of how direct
reimbursement works in order to benefit form it.  They only need to understand the basic
premise.  Once dentists introduce employers to the concept, they can bring in the experts to
explain various aspects and help employers set up a direct-reimbursement-based plan."<p>

<p>

As managed care continues to influence how dental benefits are provided, Bush feels it is
imperative for dentist-input to be heard.  "I recently read an article in a major employee-benefits magazine that sang the praises of capitated dental plans.  It claimed that, when
compared to fee-for-service plans, capitation provided better quality assurance at safer dental
offices," says Bush.  "When employers read those kind of articles, it influences the dental
plans they choose for their employees.  Dentists must realize it is up to them to communicate
the advantages of fee-for-service dental plans that allow employees to choose their own
dentist.  Direct reimbursement is a great concept, but because it eliminates third-party profits,
few insurance agents or benefit professional promote the strategy.  If dentists don't promote
direct reimbursement, it is unlikely employers will ever hear about the concept."<p>

<p>

<h4>Organizing for Success</h4>
<p>

California's success with promoting direct reimbursement can be attributed to a coordinated
effort by dentists with the help of the California Dental Association.  In emulating California's
example, following are some basic steps other states can take to get the direct reimbursement
ball rolling:<p>

<p>

  <b>Involvement</b> - Involve your local dental society and the statewide organization.<p>

  <b>Education</b> - Educate dentists through organization newsletters, information packets,
seminars, meetings, etc.<p>

<b> Awareness</b> - Increase awareness through media coverage, speaking engagements at
business-association meetings, etc.<p>

 <b>Support </b>- Provide support to promotional efforts by offering free consulting services to
businesses, establishing an 800-number for easy access to information.<p>

<p>

<h2>Who Benefits Most From your Dental Plan?</h2>
<p>

Most employers don't know that up to a third of their dental premium may never benefit their
employees...it's applied to insurance company overhead and profits.<p>

<p>

That's why the California Dental Association promotes Direct Reimbursement.  DR is a self-funding strategy that allows employers to pay benefits directly to employees by reimbursing
them for their dental expenses.<p>

<p>

When compared to fully insured dental plan, Direct Reimbursement often results in savings of
25 to 35 percent.  This means more dental benefits for employees and big savings for
employers!<p>

<p>

Direct Reimbursement also preserves the employee's 'Right to Choose'.  Unlike dental plans
that limit providers, DR lets you have complete freedom of choice in selecting your dentist.<p>

<p>

Since DR eliminates the need for insurance, few agents are anxious to talk about the concept. 
That's why we're offering our help.<p>

<h1>Feel Threatened by Managed Care?</h1><img src="octo.jpg" align=right hspace=10>
<hr>
<p>

<h2>Do you feel your practice is threatened by managed
care?</h2>
<p>

If you do, you're not alone.  Tough economic times have forced many employers to drop their
fee-for-service dental plans for managed care plans - plans that may require your patients to
change dentists in order to receive dental benefits.<p>

<p>

<h2>What can you do?</h2>
<p>

You can join managed care plans as a participating provider, but there's a downside.  Some
plans require you to substantially discount your fees.  Others contractually obligate you to
treat the patients assigned to your office for a fixed monthly "capitation fee."  With this type
of plan, you assume the insurance risk.  If utilization is high, your overhead costs may exceed
the capitation fee you're paid to provide dental services.<p>

<p>

<h2>But what if I choose not to join managed care plans?</h2>
<p>

The decision to join or not to join a managed care plan is one that you must make for yourself,
after carefully evaluating the legal and financial impact it could have on your practice.  But
whether or not you choose to be a managed care provider, you can strengthen your base of
fee-for-service patients by helping promote Direct Reimbursement.<p>

<p>

<h2>What is Direct Reimbursement?</h2>
<p>

Direct Reimbursement is a self-funding strategy that allows employers to provide dental
benefits for employees without insurance company involvement.  Patients pay their dentist for
treatment on a fee-for-service basis.  They are then reimbursed by their employer for all or a
portion of their expenses up to an annual maximum allowance.<p>

<p>

<h2>What are the advantages of Direct Reimbursement?</h2>
<p>

Direct Reimbursement is simple to use and easy to understand.  Employees can receive
treatment form the dentist of their choice and can use their benefit allowance on the treatment
that they and their dentist feel best meets their dental needs.  Because insurance overhead and
profits are eliminated, the concept is extremely cost-effective.  Employers often report savings
of 20, 40 even 60 percent.<p>

<p>

<h2>How can you help?</h2>
<p>

We need you to help us introduce employers to the Direct Reimbursement strategy.  It's easy. 
Just keep copies of our informational brochure or audiotape in your office.  Share the
information with patients and friends, especially those who are decision-makers where they
work.  Recommend that they consider Direct Reimbursement when the next review their
employee benefit package.  Tell them that Direct Reimbursement allows them to provide
quality, cost-effective dental benefits, without sacrificing their employees' right to choose their
dentist.<p>

<p>

Use the attached reply card to put us in touch with an employer who you feel can benefit from
information about Direct Reimbursement.  We'll send him or her an information packet. 
We'll also offer sample plan designs, cost estimates and sample administrative forms and
documents.  Our assistance is free of charge, a public service of CDA.<p>

<p>

Help preserve fee-for-service dentistry by telling employers that Direct Reimbursement is an
attractive alternative to managed care.  For more information and sample promotional

<h2><center>Dental Group Recommends Direct Reimbursement</h2>

Reprinted from THE HERALD, Monterey, California<br>
March 1, 1992<br>
</center>
<p>

<p>

Imagine the perfect employee dental benefit plan: no deductibles, no excluded treatment
procedures and, best of all, no premiums.<p>

<p>

Impossible?  Not so--at least, not according to the dentists of the Monterey Bay Dental
Society.  They are actively promoting a totally new approach to group dental benefits, called
Direct Reimbursement.<p>

<p>

"This is a great concept that employers need to hear about," said Leon H. Cooper, D.D.S.,
president of the 333-member dental organization.  "I've made promoting this strategy to
employers in the Monterey Bay area one of the priorities in my term of office.  It's a
concept that benefits everyone involved: employees, employers, and the dentists providing
the dental care."<p>

<p>

According to Cooper, Direct Reimbursement greatly simplifies how benefits are provided. 
Instead of paying a premium to an insurance company, the employer keeps monies budgeted
for a dental plan, usually depositing them into an interest bearing checking account. 
Employees visit the dentist of their choice and receive treatment.  They pay the dentist and
present a receipt to their employer, documenting that an expense was incurred.  The
employer reimburses employees for all or part of the expenses, up to an annual maximum
allowance.<p>

<p>

"There are usually no deductibles, waiting periods or excluded treatment procedures," said
Cooper.  "The 'red tape' found in traditional plans is eliminated.  The plan makes benefits
easy for employees to understand and easy for the employer to administer."<p>

<p>

According to Cooper, one of the most attractive features of the plan if its cost-efficiency. 
Insurance agent commissions and insurance company profits are eliminated.  There are no
unused premiums because the employer incurs no expense until an employee visits the dentist
and requests reimbursement.<p>

<p>

John Sabine, vice president and chief operations officer of Tom Hopkins Construction
Company in Santa Cruz, is quick to endorse the costs-efficiency of the Direct Reimbursement
strategy.  Before joining Hopkins Construction he worked for a large company that was
exploring ways of improving cost efficiency.<p>

<hr>

<strong>"Employee Satisfaction is excellent . . . Benefits are clear and our employees receive faster payment."
</strong><hr>

"We looked at our dental plan and compared what we were paying in premium to what the
insurance company was paying back in claims," said Sabine.  "It was clear the insurance
company was doing very well, so we started self-funding our dental plan."<p>

<p>

The company eventually implemented a vision care plan and was able to pay both dental and
vision benefits for the same cost of their former dental premium.  It wasn't until two years
later, after joining Hopkins Construction, that a local dentist, Dr. Bill Cannon, recommended
Direct Reimbursement to Sabine.  It was the same self-funding strategy Sabine's previous
employer had used.<p>

<p>

"We thought we had invented the idea," said Sabine.<p>

<p>

With the help of consultants from the California Dental Association, Sabine implemented a
Direct Reimbursement plan for the 40 employees at Hopkins Construction which went into
effect in August 1991.  Their early experience with the plan has been very favorable.<p>

<p>

"Now, we are paying ourselves," said Sabine.  "The monies we would have paid in
premiums are deposited into a separate account.  We are building a significant reserve.  So
far only 35% of the monies deposited have been used to pay benefits."<p>

<p>

According to Sabine, they intend to use the reserve monies to enhance employees benefits in
other areas.  "We want to improve the overall medical care...perhaps start a vision care
program.  We have seven months to go for a first year review, but it would appear there will
be sufficient funds to do that."<p>

<p>

Marc Fearnehough, owner of Appliance Service Center in Santa Cruz, heard about the
concept from Sabine and Dr. Cannon.  The conversation prompted him to study the claims
experience of the plan that covered his 11 employees.  Getting the data was not easy.  His
insurance company would not give him the information.  After several months of persistent
inquiries, he got the claims data he was looking for.<p>

<p>

"Our former plan was not a good value," said Fearnehough.  "Only 46 percent of what we
paid in premiums was returned to employees in the form of benefits."<p>

<p>

Fearnehough adopted a Direct Reimbursement plan in August 1991.  Under the new plan, he
pays employees directly when they go to the dentist.  They present receipts documenting
their expenses and he reimburses them for 80 percent of their actual expenses, up to an $800
annual maximum benefit.<p>

<p>

"Employee satisfaction is excellent," said Fearnehough.  "Reimbursement is based on a set
percentage, we eliminated deductibles.  Benefits are clear and our employees receive faster
payment.  The plan has cost us 45.5% of our previous premium, so we're saving about
55%."<p>

<p>

Fearnehough feels an added benefit of Direct Reimbursement is reduced administrative costs
in the dental office.  "We've learned some dentists actually offer a discount if payment is
made in cash.  Direct Reimbursement apparently reduces their overhead costs."<p>

<p>

Doug Bush, director of benefit consulting for the California Dental Association assisted both
groups in establishing their plans.  He said he was not surprised by early savings the two
groups have experienced.<p>

<p>

"Most groups converting their traditional insured plans to Direct Reimbursement have a
potential savings of 25 - 35%.  The actual cost will vary from group to group and from year
to year, based on utilization of the plan.  Both these groups knew their utilization was low. 
They were paying premiums for a number of employees who weren't using their benefits. 
That made them ideal candidates for Direct Reimbursement."<p>

<p>

Bush works closely with local dental societies promoting the Direct Reimbursement concept. 
He aids employers in designing plans, projecting costs and preparing the plan documents
required for self-funded employee reimbursement plans.  His services are offered as a public
service by the California Dental Association.<p>

<p>

"Doug will be back in the Monterey area on March 12 and 13 to meet with employers
interested in learning more about Direct Reimbursement," said Dr. Cooper.  "This is nothing
we're selling: it's information we're sharing.  We think the business community will find the
information very helpful."<p>

<p>

Further information can be obtained by contacting the Monterey Bay Dental Society at
(408) 758-8406, or the California Dental Association at (800) 736-7071, extension 4400.<p>

</center>
<b>WHAT IS A PERIODONTIST?  $48.00 per 100 (includes shipping, handling; CA Resident
add 7.25% tax).   </b><p>

<p>

This brochure answers the questions of patients who are about to be, or have been referred to a
periodontist from a general dentist, specialty dental practice, or allied professional.  The brochure
dispels common apprehensions of both the referring dentist and patient about returning to the
'home' practice and discusses such concerns as insurance coverage, surgery, X-Rays and loss of
teeth.<p>

<p>

An excellent referral tool for all dentists, hygienists and medical professionals.  A great practice
building tool for specialists and general practitioners alike.  <p>

<p>

<p>

<b>WHEN TO SEE A PERIODONTIST $48.00 per 100 (includes shipping, handling; CA
Residents add 7.25% tax).</b><p>

<p>

An easily understood introduction to periodontal disease.  This brochure includes a definition of
gum disease and how it is diagnosed.  It reinforces that surgery is not always part of treatment.<p>

<p>

Recommended as a patient education handout in the general dental or specialty practice.  It is
also for periodontists to give to patients prior to or at their first appointment.  A good education
tool for direct mail or distribution at health fairs.<p>

<p>

<b>A WORD ABOUT YOUR NEW MEDICATION $48.00 per 100 (includes shipping,
handling; CA Residents add 7.25% tax).</b><p>

<p>

Though calcium channel blockers are among the most frequently prescribed drugs in the United
States, many patients and physicians are not aware of the relationship between these drugs and
Gingival Hyperplasia (enlarged gums).  This brochure provides important information for
patients who take calcium channel blockers such as Procardia, Calan, or Cyclosporine-A, as well
as Dilantin, a drug used to control convulsions.<p>

<p>

This brochure is appropriate for use in both medical and dental practices. It includes a list of
drugs by (trade and generic name) currently known to cause gingival hyperplasia, photos of both
healthy and hyperplasic gums, warning signs and tips on dental hygiene.  The publication can be
useful as a referral enhancing or building tool with physicians (particularly cardiologists and
cardiovascular surgeons), and dentists.  It can also be used in periodontal practices for patients in
active and maintenance stages of treatment.<p>

<p>

<b>WHAT EVERY WOMAN SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE FEMALE HORMONE
PROGESTERONE AND GUM DISEASE $48.00 per 100 (includes shipping, handling; CA
Residents add 7.25% tax).<p>

</b><p>

Women of nearly any age can be affected by increased levels of the female hormone,
Progesterone.  Progesterone levels not only increase naturally during pregnancy, they are often
used alone, or combined in oral contraceptives, in menopausal drugs, and to treat a number of
conditions related to female reproduction.<p>

<p>

An increase in progesterone levels can cause or irritate gum disease: a fact of which many
physicians and patients are unaware.  <p>

<p>

This brochure is an excellent education tool for obstetricians, gynecologists and female patients
as well as for use in community education programs.  It is recommended for distribution to
pharmacies and women's organizations, in addition to dental practices.<p>

<p>

The publication includes a definition of gum disease, a list of medications containing
progesterones, warning signs of gum disease, and tips on how to care for teeth and gums. <p>

</b><h1>New Patient Bill of Rights Debuts<i></h1>
</i><p>

	Things just aren't like they were 10 years
ago. Any office without a computer is
obsolete, interest rates are down and there's
a coffeehouse on every corner. Everything
changes over time and hopefully it gets
better.<p>

	The practice of dentistry has certainly
seen some changes -- the most significant
ones dealing with dentist-patient
relationships, dental benefit coverage and
practice techniques. <p>

	Like anything else that's a decade old,
CDA's Dental Patient Bill of Right was due
for an upgrade. While the original patient
rights are still applicable, there are some
significant issues that affect you and your
patients that didn't exist in 1987.<p>

	The health care evolution has put a
spotlight on certain issues. One is a patient's
ability to make an appointment with your
office within a reasonable amount of time.
Appointments three weeks out for an
emergency do not work. And having to wait
three to four months for a prophy and exam
is a bit unreasonable, to say the least.
Patients have the right to schedule an
appointment in a timely manner.<p>

	If a patient has dental coverage, it's also
his or her right to have all treatment options
explained regardless of coverage or cost.
This means that you should explain all
options, regardless of what the insurance
plan will pay for. Not only does the patient
have the right to be given the pros, cons and
costs of each option, but you have the right
to tell them. All patients should be making
informed decisions as to what is the best
treatment is for them, not what's best for
their insurance company's bottom-line.<p>

	It's hard to believe, but 10 years ago
infection controls such as gloves and masks
were just beginning to be used. It seems like
we've been using them for years. And now
there's more -- plastic on the light handles,
jackets for the headrests, disposable
instruments, etc. These things signify to
patients that you are doing everything
possible to make their visit safe. The original
right stated that patients have "the right to
expect dental team members to use
appropriate infection controls such as
gloves." It's been revised to cover every
angle -- "appropriate infection and
sterilization controls." <p>

	Dentistry has come a long way in just 10
years. The new and improved bill of rights
makes a statement to all California patients
as they pursue quality dental care: CDA
members continue to uphold the rights of
their patients, value the dentist-patient
relationship and be in continual pursuit of
excellence.<p>

<title>Dental Health Facts - Sealants</title>
<body bgcolor="#ddeeff">
<img src="cdafacts.gif"align=left hspace=10>
<center>
<h1>Dental Health Fact Sheet</h1>
<br clear=all>

<hr>
<h2>SEALANTS</h2>
</center>


With the help of your dentist, preventing tooth decay can become even easier.  You may already be aware that daily 
brushing and flossing are the most important weapons against the formation of plaque, the primary cause of cavities.  
To supplement your regular routine of brushing and flossing, your dentist can apply a coat of plastic material -- called a 
sealant -- on the top, or biting, surfaces of your teeth.  This plastic coating creates a barrier between your teeth and the 
decay-causing bacteria that live in plaque.<P>

<B>	WHAT IS PLAQUE AND WHY DOES IT CAUSE CAVITIES?</B><P>

As you or your children eat and drink during the day, the food in your mouth combines with bacteria to produce a 
sticky film called plaque that attaches on and in between tooth surfaces (tooth enamel).  Plaque often is found on the 
chewing surfaces of the back teeth, from which it is difficult to remove by brushing and flossing alone.  If plaque is not 
removed regularly from your teeth, it can produce acids which will attack the tooth enamel and create pits or holes 
(cavities) in the tooth.  This is tooth decay.<P>

<B>	HOW CAN SEALANTS HELP PREVENT CAVITIES?</B><P>

Coating your teeth with a slippery plastic material makes it harder for plaque to stick to the tiny grooves on the biting 
surfaces of the teeth - reducing the risk of forming cavities and tooth decay.<P>

<B>	IS IT DIFFICULT TO APPLY SEALANTS?</B><P>

No.  Your dentist may use a special instrument to apply the plastic sealant on your teeth.  Most often, it is a painless 
treatment that lasts for many months.<P>

<B>	WHO SHOULD GET SEALANTS?</B><P>

Sealants are most effective in reducing cavities in children with newly formed permanent teeth.  They are useful in 
cutting down formation of decay in adult teeth, as well.  An application of sealants is a preventive measure to keep teeth 
healthy.  It is an effective way to reduce the need for fillings and more expensive treatment that may be required to 
repair the damage from cavities, so sealants can also save you money.<P>

Ask your CDA dentist whether sealants would be an appropriate treatment for you and your children.<P>

<title>Dental Health Facts - Baby Bottle Tooth Decay</title>
<body bgcolor="#ddeeff">
<img src="cdafacts.gif"align=left hspace=10>
<center>
<h1>Dental Health Fact Sheet</h1>
<br clear=all>

<hr>

<h2>	BABY BOTTLE TOOTH DECAY</h2>
</center>

Baby bottle tooth decay is a dental condition that can destroy the teeth of an infant or young child.  The upper front 
teeth are the most susceptible to damage, but other teeth also may be affected.<P>

<B>	WHAT CAUSES BABY BOTTLE TOOTH DECAY?</B><P>

Baby bottle tooth decay is caused by the frequent and long-term exposure of a child's teeth to liquids containing 
sugars.  Among these liquids are milk, formula, fruit juice, sodas, and other sweetened drinks.  The sugars in these 
liquids pool around the infant's teeth and gums, feeding the bacteria that cause plaque.  Every time your child 
consumes a sugary liquid, acid attacks his/her teeth.  After numerous attacks, tooth decay can occur, resulting in 
baby bottle tooth decay.<P>

Parents and care givers should be especially concerned with giving an infant a sugary drink at nap or night time.  
During sleep, the flow of saliva decreases, allowing the sugary liquids to pool around the child's teeth for an 
extended period of time.<P>

<B>	HOW TO PREVENT BABY BOTTLE TOOTH DECAY</B><P>

Parents sometimes do not realize that baby's teeth are susceptible to decay as soon as they appear in the infant's 
mouth. By the time the decay is noticed, it may be too late to save the child's teeth. You can prevent this from 
happening to your child's teeth by knowing how to protect them.<P>
<ul>
	<li>	After each feeding wipe the child's teeth and gums with a damp washcloth or small soft 
toothbrush to remove plaque. Begin brushing your child's teeth as soon as the first tooth erupts. 
Flossing should begin when all primary teeth have erupted, usually by age 2 or 2 1/2.
	<li>	Never allow your child to fall asleep with a bottle containing a sweetened liquid.
	<li>	If your child refuses to fall asleep without a bottle, simply fill it with water and nothing else.
	<li>	If your local water supply does not contain enough decay-fighting fluoride, check with your CDA 
dentist to see if your child should receive fluoride supplements.
	<li>	Start dental visits between six and twelve months of age.
</ul>

<B>	HOW SERIOUS IS BABY BOTTLE TOOTH DECAY?</B><P>

Baby bottle tooth decay can cause painful toothaches which can hinder eating. Severely decayed teeth can become 
infected and need to be extracted. If your child's teeth are infected or lost too early due to baby bottle tooth decay, 
your child may have some of these problems:<P>
<ul>
<li>	Poor eating habits
<li>	Speech problems
<li>	Crooked teeth
<li>	Damaged adult (permanent) teeth
<li>	Yellow or brown adult (permanent) teeth
</ul>
Keep your child happy and smiling by preventing baby bottle tooth decay.<P>

<title>Dental Health Facts - Clean Teeth & Gums</title>
<body bgcolor="#ddeeff">

<h1>Dental Health Fact Sheet</h1>
<br clear=all>

<hr>


<h2>	CLEAN TEETH AND GUMS</h2>
</center>

Having a clean mouth is important.  In addition to being healthier, it gives you fresh breath and a nicer smile.<P>

When you eat, bits of food, some too small for you to see, remain in your mouth.  They feed bacteria that grow in a 
sticky film on your teeth.  This film, called plaque, is the main cause of tooth decay and gum disease.<P>

<B>	WHY BRUSH?</B><P>

Brushing your teeth after meals and between-meal snacks not only gets rid of the food particles that you can see, it 
removes plaque from your teeth.  Using a fluoride toothpaste is important because the fluoride can help kill 
bacteria, as well as make your teeth stronger.<P>

Ask your dentist to recommend the best toothbrush for you.  Generally, a brush with soft, end-rounded or polished 
bristles is less likely to injure gum tissue.  The size and shape of the brush should allow you to reach every tooth.  
Children may need smaller brushes than those designed for adults.  Remember: worn-out toothbrushes can not 
properly clean your teeth and may injure your gums.  Toothbrushes should be replaced every three or four 
months.<P>

<B>	WHY FLOSS?</B><P>

Flossing removes plaque and food particles from between teeth and under the gumline, areas your toothbrush can 
not reach.  Because tooth decay and periodontal disease often start in these areas, it is important to clean them 
thoroughly on a daily basis.<P>

Flossing is a skill that needs to be learned.  Do not be discouraged if you find it difficult at first.  With practice, you 
will find that flossing takes only a few minutes of your time each day.<P>

<B>	WHAT ABOUT MOUTHRINSES AND MOUTHWASHES?</B><P>

If used as directed, in addition to brushing and flossing, mouthrinses and mouthwashes can help to prevent tooth 
decay.<P>

<B>	HOW OFTEN SHOULD I SEE MY DENTIST?</B><P>

If possible, you should visit your dentist every six months for a preventive check and cleaning.  Infants should see a 
dentist at about 12 months of age.  <P>

<title>Dental Health Facts - Diet and Dental Health</title>

<h2>	DIET AND DENTAL HEALTH</h2>
</center>


You know that what you eat can make a difference in the way you feel and perform.  That is why you should try to 
choose foods that will help your body stay strong and healthy.  But did you know that your choice of foods and your 
eating patterns also may affect your dental health?<P>

<B>	HOW DOES DIET AFFECT DENTAL HEALTH?</B><P>

If your diet is low in certain nutrients, it may be harder for the tissues of your mouth to resist infection.  This may 
be a contributing factor to periodontal (gum) disease, the main cause of tooth loss in adults.  Although poor 
nutrition does not actually cause periodontal disease, many researchers believe that the disease progresses faster 
and is more severe in patients whose diet does not supply the necessary nutrients.<P>

To make sure that you are getting enough nutrients for good general and oral health, you should choose foods from 
the four basic food groups: fruits and vegetables, breads and cereals, milk and dairy products, and meat, fish and 
eggs.  When you do snack, avoid soft, sweet, sticky foods, such as cakes, candy and dried fruits, that cling to your 
teeth and promote tooth decay.  Instead, choose dentally healthy foods such as nuts, raw vegetables, plain yogurt, 
cheese, popcorn and sugarless gum or candy.  To have a diet that promotes dental health, you must develop 
sensible eating habits.   <P>
<B>	HOW CAN I GET ENOUGH FLUORIDE?</B><P>

If you and your family have a balanced diet, you will get all the nutrients you need for good dental health, with one 
possible exception - fluoride.  Fluoride is vital for strong, decay-resistant teeth.  If there is not enough fluoride in 
your community water supply, the level of fluoride can be adjusted to the right amount for good dental health 
(about one part fluoride per million parts water).  If your drinking water is not fluoridated, ask your dentist how 
you can get the fluoride you need.<P>

Fluoride toothpastes and mouthrinses that carry the seal of the American Dental Association's Council on Dental 
Therapeutics have been proven effective in helping prevent dental decay.  However, they do not contribute to your 
dietary fluoride.<P>

Together, a balanced diet, daily use of fluoride, brushing and flossing, and sensible eating habits, can reduce the 
risk of or even prevent dental disease.<P>

<title>Dental Health Facts - Smokeless Tobacco</title>
<body bgcolor="#ddeeff">
<img src="cdafacts.gif"align=left hspace=10>
<center>
<h1>Dental Health Fact Sheet</h1>
<br clear=all>

<hr>


<h2>	IF YOU CHEW, QUIT</h2>

</center>
Smokeless tobacco use in the United States continues to increase each year.  It may be smokeless, but it isn't 
harmless.  Why should you care?  Keep reading.<P>

<B>	SMOKELESS TOBACCO</B><P>

<B>TOOTH ABRASION</B> - Grit and sand in smokeless tobacco products scratches teeth and wears away the 
hard surface or enamel.  Premature loss of tooth enamel can cause added sensitivity and may require corrective 
treatment.<P>

<B>GUM RECESSION</B> - Constant irritation to the spot in the mouth where a small wad of chewing tobacco 
is placed can result in permanent damage to periodontal tissue.  It also can damage the supporting bone structure.  
The injured gums pull away from the teeth, exposing root surfaces and leaving teeth sensitive to heat and cold.  
Erosion of critical bone support leads to loosened teeth that can be permanently lost.<P>

<B>INCREASED TOOTH DECAY</B> - Sugar is added to smokeless tobacco during the curing and 
processing to improve its taste.  The sugar reacts with bacteria found naturally in the mouth, causing an acid 
reaction, which leads to decay.<P>

<B>TOOTH DISCOLORATION AND BAD BREATH</B> - Common traits of long-term smokeless tobacco 
users are stained teeth and bad breath.  Moreover, the habit of continually spitting can be both unsightly and 
offensive.<P>

<B>NICOTINE DEPENDENCE</B> - Nicotine blood levels achieved by smokeless tobacco use are similar to 
those from cigarette smoking.  Nicotine addiction can lead to an artificially increased heart rate and blood pressure. 
 In addition, it can constrict the blood vessels that are necessary to carry oxygen-rich blood throughout the body.  
Athletic performance and endurance levels are decreased by this reaction.<P>

<B>UNHEALTHY EATING HABITS</B> - Chewing tobacco lessens a person's sense of taste and ability to 
smell.  As a result, users tend to eat more salty and sweet foods, both of which are harmful if consumed in 
excess.<P>

<B>ORAL CANCER</B> - With the practice of "chewing" and "dipping," tobacco and its irritating juices are 
left in contact with gums, cheeks and/or lips for prolonged periods of time.  This can result in a condition called 
leukoplakia.  Leukoplakia appears either as a smooth, white patch or as leathery-looking wrinkled skin.  It results 
in cancer in 3 percent to 5 percent of all cases.<P>

<B>OTHER CANCERS</B> - All forms of smokeless tobacco contain high concentrations of cancer-causing 
agents.  These substances subject users to increased cancer risk not only of the oral cavity, but also the pharynx, 
larynx and esophagus.<P>

<B>DANGER SIGNS</B> - If you use smokeless tobacco, or have in the past, you should be on the lookout for 
some of these early signs of oral cancer:<P>
<ul>
<li>	A sore that does not heal
<li>	A lump or white patch
<li>	A prolonged sore throat
<li>	Difficulty in chewing
<li>	Restricted movement of the tongue or jaws
<li>	A feeling of something in the throat
</ul>

Pain is rarely an early symptom.  For this reason, all tobacco users need regular dental check-ups.<P>

<title>Dental Health Facts - Mouth Guards</title>
<body bgcolor="#ddeeff">
<img src="cdafacts.gif"align=left hspace=10>
<center>
<h1>Dental Health Fact Sheet</h1>
<br clear=all>

<hr>


<h2>	MOUTH GUARDS</h2>
</center>
Don't be the victim of a preventable injury: wear a mouth guard.  While mouth guards are not mandatory 
equipment in all sports, their worth is indisputable.  Dentists see many oral and facial injuries that might have been 
prevented by the use of a mouth guard.<P>

Facial injuries in nearly every sport can result in damage to teeth, lips, cheeks and tongue.  Mouth guards cushion 
blows to the face and neck.  A mouth guard should be part of every athlete's gear, no matter the sport.  It's better to 
play it safe than face a devastating and painful oral injury.<P>

Even adults are not free from the dangers of mouth injuries.  Dentists treat many trauma injuries in weekend 
athletes.  Whatever your age or sport, mouth guards are an important part of sports safety and your exercise 
routine.  Do what you can to protect your smile and preserve your health.<P>

<B>	DOS AND DON'TS</B><P>
<ul>

<li>	Do wear a mouth guard at all times when playing sports.
<li>	Do inform yourself about the most common oral injuries.
<li>	Do wear a mouth guard custom-fitted by your dentist, especially if you wear fixed dental 
appliances such as braces or bridgework.
<li>	Do not wear removable appliances (retainers, bridge, or complete or partial dentures) when 
playing sports.
</ul>

<B>	WHAT ARE YOUR CHOICES</B><P>

There are three types of mouth guards:  custom-made, mouth-formed and ready-made.  Custom-made mouth 
guards are professionally designed by your dentist from a cast model of your teeth.  Because they are designed to 
cover all back teeth and cushion the entire jaw, they can prevent concussions caused by blows to the chin.  Custom 
guards may be slightly more expensive than commercially produced mouthpieces, but they offer the best possible fit 
and protection.  They are more secure in the mouth and do not interfere with speech or breathing.  Calling plays or 
formations, for instance, will not be impeded by custom guards.<P>

Mouth-formed guards, also called "boil and bite," should also be fitted by your dentist.  This is generally done by 
shaping a soft pre-formed guard to the contours of the teeth and allowing it to harden.  However, these devices are 
difficult to design for athletes who wear braces and can become brittle after prolonged use.<P>

Ready-made, commercial mouth guards can be purchased at most sporting goods stores and are made of rubber or 
polyvinyl.  They are the least expensive but also the least effective.<P>

Keep your mouth guard in top shape by rinsing it with water or mouthwash after each use and allowing it to air-dry.  With proper care, it should last the length of a season or longer.<P>

<title>Dental Health Facts - Dental Emergencies</title>
<body bgcolor="#ddeeff">
<img src="cdafacts.gif"align=left hspace=10>
<center>
<h1>Dental Health Fact Sheet</h1>
<br clear=all>

<hr>


<h2>	DENTAL EMERGENCIES</h2>
</center>

Injuries to the mouth may include teeth that are knocked out (evulsed), forced out of position (extruded) or broken 
(fractured).  Sometimes lips, gums or cheeks have cuts.  Oral injuries are often painful, and should be treated by a 
dentist as soon as possible.<P>

<B>	EVULSED TEETH</B><P>

When a tooth is knocked out you should:<P>
<ul>
<li>	Immediately call your dentist for an emergency appointment.
<li>	Attempt to find the tooth.
<li>	Gently rinse, but do not scrub the tooth to remove dirt or debris.  
<li>	Place the clean tooth in your mouth between the cheek and gum.
<li>	Do not attempt to replace the tooth into the socket. This could cause further damage.
<li>	Get to the dentist as soon as possible. If it is within a half hour of the injury, it may be possible to 
reimplant the tooth.
<li>	If it is not possible to store the tooth in the mouth of the injured person, (e.g., young child) wrap the tooth 
in a clean cloth or gauze and immerse in milk.
</ul>
<B>	EXTRUDED TEETH</B><P>

If the tooth is pushed out of place (inward or outward), it should be repositioned to its normal alignment with very 
light finger pressure.  Do not force the tooth into the socket.  Hold the tooth in place with a moist tissue or gauze.  
Again, it is vital that the injured individual be seen by a dentist within 30 minutes.<P>

<B>	FRACTURED TEETH</B><P>

How a fractured tooth is treated will depend on how badly it is broken.  Regardless of the damage, treatment should 
always be determined by a dentist.<P>

<B>MINOR FRACTURE</B> - Minor fractures can be smoothed by your dentist with a sandpaper disc or 
simply left alone. Another option is to restore the tooth with a composite restoration. In either case, you should 
treat the tooth with care for several days.<P>

<B>MODERATE FRACTURE</B> - Moderate fractures include damage to the enamel, dentin and/or pulp. If 
the pulp is not permanently damaged, the tooth may be restored with a full permanent crown. If pulpal damage 
does occur further dental treatment will be required.<P>

<B>SEVERE FRACTURE</B> - Severe fractures often mean a traumatized tooth with a slim chance of 
recovery.  <P>

<B>	INJURIES TO THE SOFT TISSUES OF THE MOUTH</B><P>

Injuries to the inside of the mouth include tears, puncture wounds and lacerations to the cheek, lips or tongue.  The 
wound should be cleaned right away and the injured person taken to the emergency room for the necessary suturing 
and wound repair.<P>

Bleeding from a tongue laceration can be reduced by pulling the tongue forward and using gauze to place pressure 
on the wound area.<P>

<TITLE>Senior-Dent</TITLE>
<center>
<H1>Senior-Dent</H1>
<H3>A Special Program For Eligible Seniors<P></H3>
<H4>Sponsored by California Dental Association	<P></H4>
</center>
The California  Dental Association in 1979 established Senior-Dent, a program offering reduced dental fees to all qualified senior citizens. <P>

<STRONG>To qualify, seniors need only meet three eligibility requirements.</STRONG> <P>

<DL>
<DD>
They must:<P>

Be 60 years of age or over. <P>
Have an annual household income of $16,000 or less. <P>
Not be receiving dental benefits from Denti-Cal (the state welfare program for dentistry) or a dental insurance plan.<P>
</DL>
Thousands of licensed California dentists who are members of California Dental Association offer the Senior-Dent program. Their offices are located throughout the state, in both rural and urban areas.<P>
To find a Senior-Dent dentist in your neighborhood, simply call your local dental society (listed in the Yellow Pages under <I>Dentist Information Bureaus</I>) or dial California Dental Association's toll-free hotline (1-800-736-7071) where trained personnel are standing by to give you the telephone number of your local dental society.<P>
Your local dental society will give you names of participating dentists in your neighborhood. (If you'd prefer to visit  the office of a bilingual dentist, just let the dental society know.) From the list of names you'll receive, select a dentist and call that office for an appointment. <P>
Participating dentists offer a discount from their usual fees for all dental services. This includes examinations, cleaning and all other dental procedures. Financial arrangements, including the amount of reduction and financial terms, are handled privately between the patient and dentist.<P>
Eligible seniors are encouraged to take advantage of the Senior-Dent program for regular preventive care. Regular examinations and preventative care are necessary for individuals who already have dentures, as well as for those with some or all of their natural teeth. It's the best way to make sure your teeth and gums stay healthy and to prevent potential dental health problems from developing.<P>
<HR>
<center>To find a dentist, Call Your Local Dental Society (Listed in the YellowPages under Dentist Information Bureaus) or 1-800-736-7071, Extension 4220</center><P>

<TITLE>Peer Review Program</TITLE>
<H1>Peer Review Program</H1>

The California Dental Association and its 32 component dental societies, in keeping with their obligation of 
service to the public, have established a statewide peer review system. The purpose of the peer review system is to 
resolve disputes that may arise in the delivery of dental services to the public; in particular, disputes regarding the 
quality and/or appropriateness of dental treatment, utilization (problems related to dental insurance benefits when 
treatment is questioned), and/or potentially irregular billing practices.<P>

A peer review committee, comprised of CDA member-dentist volunteers, evaluates all available evidence 
pertaining to each dispute and follows specific procedures (listed below) to make a fair and impartial 
determination. The parties involved are then notified of a committees decision by a letter of resolution. If any 
party to a review can factually demonstrate that a procedural error may have occurred, or that the decision was not 
based on available facts, an appeal to the Council on Peer Review may be requested. This appeal must be mailed 
within 30 days of the date the letter of resolution is sent. Any decision of an appeal panel is final and binding.<P>


<H3>PEER REVIEW PRODCEDURES</H3>

All disputes that are evaluated within the peer review system must include the following procedures:<P>

<DL>

<LI>The responsibility for conducting a review will be that of the local component dental society of which the dentist is 
a member.<BR>


<LI>The patient must sign a Patient Agreement Form prior to review. (The dentist, by virtue of membership in CDA, 
has already agreed to be bound by a peer review decision.)<BR>


<LI>A Record Release Form must be signed by the patient so that a review committee may legally obtain a patients 
records.<BR>

<LI>Unless the treatment in question cannot be evaluated (i.e., treatment has been redone), the patient will be examined 
by a panel of at least three dentists.<BR>


<LI>The patient will be given an opportunity to present any additional comments, usually at the time of the patient 
examination.<BR>


<LI>The dentist must be invited to meet with the review committee if he/she chooses.<BR>


<LI>All other involved parties (second treating dentists, insuring entities) will be contacted for whatever 
additional evidence is available.<BR>

<LI>The peer review committee will evaluate all evidence available (patient examination, radiographs, 
statements from other treating dentists, etc.), and make a final determination. This will be communicated to 
all involved parties in the form of a letter of resolution which will provide adequate rationale for the 
decision.<BR>

<LI>All involved parties will be provided Appeal Criteria at the time the letter of resolution is provided<P>
</UL>
Although the peer review system can satisfactorily resolve the majority of complaints received, there are limitations 
which may make a complaint inappropriate for the system. <STRONG>The following types of complaints are 
NOT within the purview of peer review system:</STRONG><P>

<H4>Cases which do not meet "time" criteria </H4>

	 Excessive passage of time alters clinical conditions. Therefore, a complaint will not be reviewed if it is 
received more than three years from the date treatment was completed, or more than one year from the date the 
complainant became aware of the problem.<P>
<H4>Cases in litigation </H4>

	 The peer review system is designed to resolve patient/dentist disputes. Consequently, no matter will be 
accepted for peer review if either party has initiated litigation concerning any aspect of the dental services which 
might otherwise be directed to review.<P>

<H4>Cases petitioning for monetary awards  </H4>

	 Requests for reimbursement for time lost from work, pain and suffering, mileage and medical expenses 
cannot be accepted in the peer review system as it is not a punitive system, but rather an evaluative one.<P>

<H4>Cases about fees  </H4>

	 A peer review committee may not comment on a dentists fees. To do so may be construed as price 
fixing.<P>

<H4>Cases not related to treatment </H4>

	  Questions concerning matters other than dental treatment (e.g., a dentists attitude, communications 
problems, etc.) are outside the purview of the peer review system.<P>

<H4>   Preface</H4>
   This report, "Public Health Service Report on Fluoride Benefits and Risks" is a summary of the findings,   
conclusions, and recommendations of <I>Review of Fluoride Benefits and Risks: Report of the Ad Hoc   
Subcommittee on Fluoride of the Committee to Coordinate Environmental Health and Related Programs,   
</I>published in February 1991.  The full report was prepared by an ad hoc subcommittee of the United  
States  Public Health Service's Committee to Coordinate Environmental Health and Related Programs  
(CCEHRP) at the request of the Assistant Secretary for Health.  The full report can be obtained from the  
Public Health Service, Department of Health and Human Services.<P>
   <B>  Public Health Service Report on Fluoride Benefits and Risks</B><P>
   <B>BACKGROUND</B><P>
   In the early part of this century, researchers observed that persons with "mottled teeth," or dental  
fluorosis, experienced fewer dental caries than persons without that pattern of tooth discoloration.   
Naturally occurring fluoride in the drinking water was identified later as being responsible for this effect  
on tooth enamel.  Community studies conducted in the 1940s established that as the level of natural  
fluoride in the drinking water increased, the prevalence of dental caries declined.  These studies led to the  
public health practice of adjusting fluoride concentration levels in fluoride-deficient drinking water  
supplies to bring the total level of fluoride to approximately 1 part per million (PPM).  The optimal range  
of community water fluoridation (optimal with respect to reducing dental caries and minimizing the risk  
of dental fluorosis) has been determined previously by the United States Public Health Service to be 0.7- 
1.2 ppm.<P>
   Controversy over the purported adverse health effects of fluoride has been associated with community  
water fluoridation programs since widespread implementation began in the 1950s.  This controversy is  
related in part to evidence that exposure to fluoride in sufficiently high doses can produce toxicity in  
animals and humans.  In the 1970s, a limited number of studies reported increased cancer mortality in  
cities with adjusted water fluoridation relative to cities without adjusted water fluoridation programs.   
Although this claim subsequently was refuted by numerous investigators, the concern over a possible  
association between cancer and water fluoridation prompted the National Toxicology Program (NTP) of  
the United States Public Health Service (PHS) to conduct a long-term study of the toxicity and  
carcinogenicity of sodium fluoride exposure in rodents.  This study employed a standard rat and mouse  
bioassay that has been useful in evaluating the potential carcinogenicity or toxicity of numerous  
chemicals.<P>
   In the spring of 1990, NTP released the findings of its fluoride study.  Although the study found no  
evidence of carcinogenicity in female rats or in mice of either sex, it did find "equivocal evidence" of  
carcinogenicity based on a small number of osteosarcomas in male rats in the medium and high-dosed  
exposure groups.  The term "equivocal evidence" is one of five standardized categories used by NTP to  
describe the strength of evidence of carcinogenicity of individual experiments.  The category "equivocal  
evidence" is used to describe the results of studies in which an association between administration of a  
chemical and a particular tumor response is uncertain.<P>
   <B>ASSESSMENT OF THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF FLUORIDE</B><P>
   The PHS report concluded that fluoride has substantial benefits in the prevention of dental caries.   
Numerous studies have established a clear causal relation between use of fluoridated water and the  
prevention of dental caries.  Although the occurrence of caries can be reduced through the use of  
fluoridated toothpaste and mouth rinses, professional fluoride treatment, and fluoride dietary supplements,  
fluoridation of water is the most cost-effective method and provides the greatest benefit to those who can  
least afford preventive and restorative dentistry.  In the 1940s, children in communities with fluoridated  
drinking water experienced reductions in caries experience (as measured by decayed, missing, and filled  
tooth scores) of about 60% relative to those for persons living in nonfluoridated* communities.  Although  
studies conducted in the 1980s continued to demonstrate that caries scores are lower in fluoridated areas,  
studies show that the differences in caries scores between fluoridated and nonfluoridated areas have  
declined to 20%-40%.  This apparent change may reflect the presence and use--in nonfluoridated areas--of  
fluoride in beverages, food, dental products, and dietary supplements.<P>
   <B>ASSESSMENT OF THE HEALTH RISKS OF FLUORIDE</B><P>
   The PHS Subcommittee undertook a comprehensive review of the possible association between fluoride  
exposure and carious adverse health outcomes.  The report concluded that there is a lack of evidence of  
associations between levels of fluoride in water and birth defects or problems of the gastrointestinal,  
genito-urinary, and respiratory systems.  Three possible health effects-cancer, effects on bone, and dental  
fluorosis-were addressed in greater detail.<P>
   <B>Cancer</B><P>
   The two approaches used to determine whether there is an association between exposure to fluoridated  
water and cancer are: a) carcinogenicity studies of rodents and b) epidemiologic analyses to compare  
cancer incidence and mortality rates in communities with fluoridated water and in those with negligible  
levels of fluoride in drinking water.<P>
   <B>Animal Studies</B><P>
   The NTP study found that rates of osteosarcomas rose as the dose of sodium fluoride exposure for male  
rates increased, but not for female rats or for mice of either gender.  These findings were interpreted as  
"equivocal evidence" of carcinogenicity for male rats but no evidence of carcinogenicity for the other  
gender/species tested.  In another recent carcinogenicity study conducted by Maurer, Cheng, Boysen, and  
Anderson and sponsored by Procter and Gamble (P&G), no evidence was found for an association between  
the development of malignant tumors and exposure to sodium fluoride in rodents of either gender.  Taken  
together, the NTP and P&G studies fail to establish an association between fluoride and cancer.<P>
   <B>Epidemiologic Studies</B><P>
   The ad hoc subcommittee of the Committee to Coordinate Environmental Health and Related Programs  
reviewed the results from numerous epidemiologic studies of the relation between exposure to fluoridated  
water and cancer that have been conducted during the last 40 years.  In addition to the review of these  
studies, the Subcommittee reviewed the findings of a recent study from the National Cancer Institute  
(NCI), which updated and expanded an earlier county-specific analysis for cancer mortality in the United  
States in relation to water fluoridation.  This study evaluated cancer mortality data and examined patterns  
of cancer incidence from 1973 through 1987 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)  
program cancer registries.  The Seer registries were used to obtain data on incidence for all types of  
cancer, with special emphasis placed on trends in osteosarcomas.<P>
   The NCI study identified no trends in cancer risk that could be attributed to the introduction of fluoride  
into drinking water.  There were no substantial differences in cancer mortality rates among persons whom  
lived in counties that had initiated water fluoridation and those in persons who lived in counties without  
water fluoridation.  Similarly, there was no apparent relation between introduction and duration of  
fluoridation and the incidence of cancer, including bone and joint cancer and the subset of  
osteosarcomas.<P>
     The NCI also conducted a more detailed evaluation of osteosarcomas using nationwide age-adjusted  
incidence from the entire SEER database for the years 1973-1987.  During this time, the annual incidence  
of osteosarcoma among males &lt;20 years of age increased from 3.6 cases/106 population to 5.5  
cases/106 population.  The incidence among females decreased slightly during the same period (from 3.8  
cases/106 population to 3.7 cases/106 population).  Although the increase in rates of osteosarcoma for  
males during this period was greater in fluoridated than nonfluoridated areas, extensive analyses revealed  
that these patterns were unrelated to either the introduction or duration of fluoridation.  Consequently, the  
NCI report concluded that, while the explanation for the increase in rates of osteosarcoma among young  
males is unknown, it is not due to exposure to water fluoridation.  Both this report and the reports from  
previous international expert panels which have reviewed earlier data concluded that there is no credible  
evidence of any association between the risk of cancer and exposure to either natural or adjusted fluoride  
in drinking water.<P>
   <B>Effects on Bone</B><P>
   Although some epidemiologic studies have suggested that the incidence of certain types of bone 
fractures  may be higher in some communities with either naturally high or adjusted fluoride levels, other 
studies  have not detected increased incidence of bone fractures.  However, a variety of potentially 
confounding  factors must be examined to assess whether there is association between exposure to fluoride 
and bone  fractures.<P>
   Fluoride has a complex dose-related action on bone.  Although crippling skeletal fluorosis is more  
common in parts of the world with high natural fluoride (>10 ppm) levels in drinking water, its  
occurrence is affected by a variety of factors, including nutritional deficiencies, impaired renal function,  
and age at exposure.  Human crippling skeletal fluorosis is endemic in several countries of the world, but  
is extremely rare in the United States.<P>
    <B>Dental Fluorosis</B><P>
   Although the precise mechanism that causes dental fluorosis is unknown, the likelihood of dental  
fluorosis is related directly to the level of fluoride exposure during tooth development.  The clinical  
spectrum of dental fluorosis varies from symmetrical whitish areas on teeth (very mid) to secondary,  
extrinsic, brownish discoloration and varying degrees of pitting of the enamel (severe dental fluorosis).   
Among children, the prevalence of moderate and severe forms of dental fluorosis is estimated to be 1.3%  
nationally.  Although fluorosis has historically been considered to be a cosmetic problem, these forms of  
dental fluorosis do not produce adverse dental health effects, such as tooth loss or impaired tooth  
function.<P>
   In the 1940s and 1950s, the major sources of fluoride were from drinking water and food.  Since then,  
additional sources of fluoride have become available, including processed beverages and food, dental  
products containing fluoride (e.g., toothpastes and mouth rinses), and fluoride dietary supplements.  In  
appropriate use of these products can substantially increase total fluoride intake.<P>
   In the 1940s, approximately 10% of the population had fluorosis when the concentration of fluoride  
found naturally in the drinking water was about 1 ppm.  Since the 1950s, in nonfluoridated areas, the total  
prevalence of dental fluorosis has clearly increased.  During the same period, in areas where water  
fluoride concentrations have remained in the optimal range (about 1 ppm fluoride), the total prevalence of  
dental fluorosis may have increased.  Increases in the prevalence of dental fluorosis suggest that total  
fluoride exposure is increasing.  Because dental fluorosis does not compromise oral health or tooth  
function, an increase in dental fluorosis does not represent a public health concern; however, it indicates  
that total fluoride exposure may be higher than that necessary to prevent tooth decay.  In general, prudent  
public health practice dictates using no more than the amount necessary to achieve a desired effect.<P>
   <B>RESEARCH AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS</B><P>
   The report of the PHS Subcommittee includes a variety of recommendations regarding health policy and  
research about the risks and benefits of fluoride.  The policy implications pertain to federal, state, and  
local health agencies concerned with fluoridation of community water supplies.  The research  
recommendations on both the benefits and risks of fluorides provide direction and scope to investigators  
and agencies concerned with these aspects of exposure of populations to water fluoridation and fluoride- 
containing products.<P>
   <B>Policy Recommendations</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>The PHS should continue to recommend the use of fluoride to prevent dental caries.     The PHS  
should continue to support optimal fluoridation (i.e., 0.7-1.2 ppm) of drinking water.     The PHS should  
sponsor scientific conferences to assess both the optimal level of total fluoride exposure form all sources  
combined and the appropriate usage of fluoride-containing dental products in order to achieve the benefits  
of reduced dental caries and to minimize the risk of dental fluorosis.<P>
<LI>In accordance with prudent health practice of limiting exposure to no more than that necessary to  
achieve a desired effect, health professionals and the public should avoid excessive and inappropriate  
exposure to fluoride (e.g., health professionals should prescribe fluoride dietary supplements only when  
the fluoride level of the home water supply is known to be deficient.  Parents should educate young  
children to minimize swallowing of fluoridated toothpaste and to use only small amount of toothpaste on  
the brush).<P>
<LI>State health departments and drinking-water programs should continue to inform physicians,  
dentists, and communities about the fluoridation status of drinking water to enable the determination for  
the need for water fluoridation or for supplemental forms of fluoride.<P>
<LI>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should review its regulations concerning naturally  
occurring fluoride in drinking water on the basis of the outcome of the recommended scientific  
conference(s) and the information in this report.<P>
<LI>The FDA should review the labeling requiring for toothpaste and other fluoride-containing products  
to ensure that information is sufficient to enable the public to make informed decisions about their use,  
especially for young children (i.e., those >6 years of age).<P>
<LI>Manufacturers of toothpaste should be encouraged to clearly communicate the fluoride levels in their  
products.  Manufacturers should determine whether toothpaste can be dispensed in a dose-limited  
container for use by children.  Manufacturers of dental products should determine whether the levels of  
fluoride can be reduced while preserving clinical effectiveness.<P>
<LI>Communities with high natural fluoride levels in the public drinking water supply should comply  
with EPA regulations as mandated by the Safe Drinking Water Act.  The current primary and secondary  
maximum contaminant levels for fluoride are 4ppm and 2ppm, respectively.<P>
<LI>The PHS is to develop an action plan to implement research and policy recommendations.<P>
</UL>
   <B>Research Recommendations</B><P>
   <I>The following research recommendations are purposely broader than the policy recommendations 
to  invite participation by a variety of public and private agencies and organizations.</I><P>
   <B>Research on the Benefits of Fluorides</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>Conduct surveys to evaluate the prevalence of dental caries over time and accurately assess exposure  
to fluoride.<P>
<LI>Undertake studies to elucidate further the role of fluoride in preventing coronal and root decay of  
adult teeth.  Undertake studies to identify effective means of providing fluoride to individuals at high risk  
of dental caries.<P>
<LI>Continue long-term studies of caries scores in cities after defluoridation or the discontinuation of  
fluoridation as a supplement to past information that covers only 2-5 years of follow-up period.<P>
<LI>Document the marginal risks, costs, and benefits of providing multiple fluoride regiments in the  
prevention of dental caries.<P>
<LI>Determine the relationship among socioeconomic status, water-fluoridation status, and the use of  
fluoride products.<P>
<LI>In scoring dental caries, count individual surfaces rather than just the number of teeth because such  
scoring provides more information and greater sensitivity.  Express reductions in caries scores as the  
number of tooth surfaces saved from caries, in addition to the percentage of reduction.<P>
</UL>

   <B>Research on the Risks of Fluoride</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>   Continue studies to elucidate the mechanisms of fluoride action on bone and teeth at the molecular  
and physical chemical level.<P>
<LI>   Develop a method of quantitatively identifying dental fluorosis that is sensitive, specific, reliable, 
and  acceptable to the public.<P>
<LI>   Continue to study dental fluorosis to determine the etiology and trends in the prevalence of dental  
fluorosis.<P>
<LI>   Conduct analytical epidemiologic studies of osteosarcoma to determine the risk factors associated  
with its development.  Fluoride exposure and bone levels of fluoride should be included in the study  
design.<P>
<LI>   Evaluate the scientific merit of conducting further animal carcinogenicity studies that us a wide 
range  of chronic doses of fluoride.  Industries sponsoring studies of fluoride should be encouraged to 
make  their data publicly available to aid in this evaluation.<P>
<LI>   Conduct analytic epidemiologic studies to determine the relationship, if any, among fluoride 
intake,  fluoride bone levels, diet, body levels of nutrients such as calcium, and bone fractures.<P>
<LI>   Conduct studies on the reproductive toxicity of fluoride using various dose levels, including the  
minimally toxic maternal dose.<P>
<LI>   Conduct further studies to investigate whether fluoride is genotoxic.<P>

Welcome.  I'm Otto DeLeon, CDA's Public Relations Coordinator.  The following is CDA's on-line news clipping column.  It includes brief summaries
of news clippings of relative interest to organized dentistry.  The clips are culled from the Los Angeles Times, Sacramento Bee, San Francisco Chronicle and Wall Street Journal.  The goal
is to centralize dental-related news coverage for individuals who want to continually monitor
dental developments reported by the mainstream print media.  Clips are update weekly.  I
welcome your comments and suggestions.  Full-length articles are available upon request.  I can be reached at:<br>

Welcome.  I'm Otto DeLeon, CDA's Public Relations Coordinator.  You have reached the on-line
version of CDA's monthly publication for media spokespersons.  Each issue of Primer is devoted
to one dental subject, much like a position paper.  Each issue comprises at least three sections: a
general introduction, a bullet-listing of facts and Q &amp; A.<p>

<p>

The editorial calendar section lists back issues that are available upon request (free of charge). 
Don't hesitate to call and ask for back issues.  We are currently working on getting all back issues
on-line.<p>

<h4>Straight Talk About Good Dental Care</h4>
<p>

Growing older often means adapting to change.  Good habits maintained for a lifetime help us
cope with change and help preserve a healthy, quality lifestyle.  Your daily brushing and
flossing routine and regular visits to the dentist are strong foundations for good oral and
overall health.<p>

<h4>How Does Growing Older Affect Oral Health?</h4>

The aging process often creates subtle or dramatic changes in the condition of teeth, mouth and
gums.<p>

<p>

<b>Keeping teeth clean and white may become more involved.</b>  The formation of plaque, a
colorless layer of bacteria that builds up on teeth, accelerates as we grow older.  Teeth also
may darken in color due to changes in dentin, the bone-like tissue underneath tooth enamel.  <p>

<p>

<b>Gums may begin to recede from teeth.</b>  This process exposes tooth roots to plaque and can
cause tooth decay.  In addition, older fillings may weaken and crack, allowing bacteria to
accumulate around the edges of fillings - causing cavities.  Unfortunately, many individuals
over the age of 50 have decay on both teeth and roots which may require clinical care.<p>

<p>

<b>"Dry Mouth" may develop.</b>  Caused by reduced saliva flow, dry mouth may lead to tooth
damage.  Reduced saliva flow may be a medical disorder or a side effect of medications such
as antihistamines, decongestants, pain killers or diuretics.  The reduced flow affects teeth
because saliva acts a cleaning agent in the mouth to wash away acids produced by plaque. 
When the mouth is not adequately lubricated and moistened by saliva, plaque forms more
quickly and produces cavities.<p>

<p>

<b>Gum disease develops more readily.</b>  Bacteria found in sugars and starches create toxins
which irritate the gums and cause gum tissue to separate from teeth.  Left untreated, gum
disease can cause unnecessary tooth loss.  It also may dissolve the bone that holds your teeth in
place.  Poorly fitted dentures, poor oral hygiene, illnesses and some medications may increase
the severity of gum disease and create chewing problems and pain in the jaw.  Fortunately,
visiting your CDA dentist regularly can help reduce the spread of gum disease and its
damaging effects.<p>

<p>

<h4>What Can Be Done To Keep My Mouth Healthy?</h4>
<p>

Visit your CDA dentist regularly.  Scheduling periodic check-ups is the best way to prevent
and detect problems resulting from the aging process.  Dentists are trained to detect changes in
the condition of gums and teeth as part of regular oral examinations.  Early treatment of gum
disease and cavities reduces the need - and the cost - for more extensive treatment that may be
required if problems of the mouth, gums and teeth go untreated.<p>

<p>

Good at-home care can help reduce the formation of plaque.  The sad fact is that brushing and
flossing alone cannot remove tartar (hardened plaque) from teeth.  See your dentist to have
tartar removed professionally.<p>

<p>

As part of the healthcare team, your dentist is able to diagnose life-threatening diseases that
require medical attention.  Early signs of diabetes, oral cancer or adverse drug reactions and
interactions often can be spotted by the dentist during a regular dental exam.<p>

<p>

It is important to note that your medical condition may have an impact on how your dentist
delivers dental care.  Dental patients with heart conditions or high blood pressure may require
pre-medication, or a change in their regular medication, before undergoing certain dental
procedures.  These conditions should be discussed with your dentist during regular check-ups.<p>

<p>

<h4>Can Dental Treatment Help Maintain My Lifestyle?</h4>
<p>

Yes.  You should be able to eat as you like and enjoy a beautiful smile.  Many dental
treatments are designed to restore your gums and teeth to their youthful good health.  Daily
use of fluoridated toothpastes and mouthwashes prescribed by your dentist can strengthen tooth
enamel and reduce tooth decay, especially around any exposed roots.<p>

<p>

Periodontal (gum) treatments can reduce gum sensitivity, recession and bleeding.  These
treatments also can strengthen the bones that hold teeth in place.  <p>

<p>

Implants, dentures and other tooth restorations are available options.  By filling in gaps from
lost teeth or by replacing diseased teeth, your CDA dentist can help you maintain good
chewing surfaces and bite alignments so that you can chew with ease, eat in comfort and smile
with assurance.<p>

<p>

<h4>Is Good Dental Health Worth The Expense?</h4>
<p>

Yes.  You should also consider what costs are involved in choosing not to take care of your
teeth, mouth and gums. <p>

<p>

With the help of your dentist, a treatment plan can be designed to help you achieve a quality
lifestyle at a reasonable cost.  Your visits to the dental office are the building blocks of good
oral and general health.  Remember that your dentist often is able to diagnose certain medical
problems before they're identified by a physician.<p>

<p>

<h4>What is <i>Senior-Dent</i>, And Can It Lower My Dental Costs?</h4>
<p>

In 1979, CDA established <i><b>Senior-Dent</b></i>, a program offering reduced dental fees for regular
preventive care to people over 60 with an annual household income of $16,000 or less, who
are not covered by Denti-Cal or dental insurance benefits.<p>

<p>

<p>

More than 7,000 licensed CDA dentists throughout California participate in Senior-Dent.  To
locate a participating dentist in your neighborhood, simply call your local dental society (listed
in the Yellow Pages under "Dental Referral Services") or call CDA toll-free at 1-800-736-7071.<p>

<p>

Your CDA dentist is your best resource on good oral care.  On your next visit to the dental
office, feel free to discuss your concerns regarding your oral health or available discount
programs.  With the help of your dentist, you can adapt to change while preserving your
healthy lifestyle.<p>

<title>What Sugar Can Do to Your Baby's Teeth</title>

</head>
<body>
<center><h2>WHAT SUGAR CAN DO TO YOUR BABY'S TEETH IS REALLY ROTTEN</h2></center>

<hr>


<h3>The Harmful Effects of Baby Bottle Tooth Decay</h3>

Good oral health begins when your child is an infant.  Health habits taught early will continue
to provide benefits throughout your child's life.  But without appropriate care and attention,
even babies can develop serious and painful dental disease.  The most common cause of tooth
loss in children isn't accidents or injuries - it's Baby Bottle Tooth Decay (BBTD), a pattern of
severe and rapid tooth decay in infants and toddlers.<p>


<h4>What Causes Baby Bottle Tooth Decay?</h4>

For a baby's tooth decay, three elements are needed: a tooth, plaque, and foods containing
sugar and starches.<p>

	Everyone's mouth has plaque, even an infant's with new "baby" teeth.  Plaque is a
sticky, colorless film of bacteria that constantly forms on tooth surfaces.  When it comes in
contact with sugar and sweets, the bacteria in plaque produces acids which attach and dissolve
the tooth enamel.  This breakdown of the enamel leads to the formation of a cavity.<p>

	Every time your baby consumes sugary or sweet liquids, the acids produced by the
plaque attack the baby teeth.  After numerous attacks by these acids, cavities can begin to
form.  In bottle-fed or nursing infants, the teeth most susceptible to BBTD are the upper front
teeth, but the molars or back teeth also can be affected.<p>

	Surprisingly, liquids that are good for your baby, such as formula, milk, breast milk
and fruit juices, all contain some form of sugar.  These nourishing liquids can be a primary
contributor to the development of cavities in your baby's newly formed teeth.  The sugary
liquids pool around your baby's teeth and gums.  The sugar acts as an energy source, or food
source, for the bacteria which produce the acids that attack the teeth and create cavities.<p>

<h4>Why Is Baby Bottle Tooth Decay So Bad For Children?</h4>

Baby bottle tooth decay not only can cause painful toothaches, it can create feeding and
nutritional problems and may lead to middle ear infections.  In very severe cases, decayed
teeth can become so infected that they may need to be removed.  If a child loses a tooth too
early, it can result in poor eating habits, speech problems and loss of self esteem.  Baby teeth
also play an essential role as space holders for permanent or adult teeth.  Premature loss of
baby teeth may create changes in the growth of the jaw.  If adult teeth cannot assume their
proper position in the jaw, extensive orthodontic repair may be required later on.<p>


<h4>How Can Baby Bottle Tooth Decay Be Prevented?</h4>

<b>Be vigilant.</b>  Because baby teeth are susceptible to decay almost as soon as they appear,
parents should be especially careful about <i>what</i> they feed their children.  It's important for
your baby to get the essential nourishment that comes form milk, formula and fruit juices even
though they contain sugar.  It's <i>when</i> you give your baby these foods that can make a big
difference in the health of your child's teeth.<p>

<b>Don't use a sugary liquid as a pacifier.</b>  Many parents will use a bottle with milk or
juice to pacify their baby at naptime, bedtime and long periods outside of regular meal times. 
While this can give short term comfort, it also can be damaging to your child.  These sugary
liquids pool around the teeth and gums, starting the formation of cavities.  Remember that
tooth decay is usually related more to the length of time the liquid is in the mouth than to the
amount of sugar in the liquid.<p>

<b>Don't put a bottle filled with sugary liquid in the crib.</b>  The best way to prevent
baby bottle tooth decay is to put your baby to bed <i>without</i> a bottle.  While your baby sleeps,
the natural saliva flow is reduced and the body does not wash away the sugary liquid.  This
allows plaque and acid to build up and attach the teeth as your baby sleeps.<p>

Instead of a bottle, try these simple tips: offer your child a security blanket, teddy bear
or pacifier (don't dip it in anything sweet); sing or play music; hold or rock your baby to
sleep; rub or pat your child's head and back; read or tell a story; or use an infant swing to
rock your baby to sleep.<p>

CDA dentists recommend that, if you must give the baby a bottle at nap or bedtime, <b>fill
it only with water.</b><p>

Be sure to consult your CDA dentist if your local water supply does not contain cavity-fighting fluoride.  A fluoride supplement might be advisable for your baby, and the entire
family.<p>

<b>Take an active role in preventing cavities.</b>  Always hold your baby when bottle
feeding and remove the bottle when bottle when your baby falls asleep.  After regular feedings
and snack times, make sure you wipe the child's teeth and gums with a damp washcloth or
gauze pad to remove plaque.  You can begin brushing your baby's teeth with a small soft
toothbrush as soon as the first tooth appears.  Check with your CDA dentist about beginning a
routine of regular flossing as well.<p>

To determine the most appropriate oral care program, make sure you have the baby
examined by your dentist.  The first appointment should be scheduled when your baby is
between six and twelve months of age.<p>

<b>Wean your baby from the bottle sooner, rather than later.</b>  Start to offer your baby
a cup at six months of age and wean your child from the bottle by about one year of age. 
Begin the weaning process by reducing the number of bottles given each day, offering liquids
to your baby in a cup instead.  At 10-12 months, gradually dilute the liquid in the bottle until
it contains only water.  However, make sure your baby continues to get adequate calories from
other foods.<p>


<h4>Good Care Now Means A Lifetime of Smiles</h4>

Good habits established today create a foundation for healthy smiles in the future.  Instilling
good oral hygiene habits from the very beginning - limiting intake of sugar-laden foods and
drinks, brushing and flossing regularly, and scheduling routine check-ups with the dentist - is
the best way to prevent dental disease and to help your children take a healthy bite out of life.<p>

<title>Choices:  Good Health Care Depends on What You Know</title>

</head>
<body>
<h2><center>CHOICES: Good health care depends on what you know</h2>
<p>

</center>
<b><center>by Citizens for the "Right To Know"</center></b><P>

<hr>

<center><h3>Would you...</h3></center>
<h4>buy a car without looking under the hood, checking the gas mileage or taking
it out for a test drive?  Of course not.</h4>

<hr>

<h3>Don't just "settle" for a health plan, "shop" for it!</h3>

Would you buy a car without looking under the hood, checking the gas mileage or taking it out
for a test drive?  Of course not.  Yet, every day, consumers buy health care coverage--one of
life's most critical purchase--without understanding what they are buying.<p>

Whether you're considering a new health care plan through your work during an open
enrollment period or seeking health care insurance on your own, you should know all the facts
about what is and isn't covered before you enroll.<p>

In this era of health care reform, personal responsibility is critical to receiving quality health
care.  You have a right to quality care, but you have a responsibility to investigate which
health care plan best meets your needs.<p>

It is difficult to find out exactly what a health care plan covers, but educating yourself and
asking the right questions before you sign up can help protect you and your family.<p>
<hr>
<h3>What are health care plans?</h3>

Before the advent of "managed care," health coverage was provided by insurance companies
who billed your doctor on a fee-for-service basis.  Today, fee-for-service insurance is still
available, but health care is becoming dominated by "managed" health care plans.  These plans
come in many forms, ranging from <b>Health Maintenance Organizations </b>(HMO) to <b>Preferred
Provider Organizations</b> (PPO).<p>

In an <b>HMO</b>, you will first see a primary care physician (family practice, obstetrics, general
practice, internal medicine or pediatrics) who will, if needed, refer you to a specialist within
the HMO system.  In most HMOs, the plan won't pay for a specialist unless you get a referral.<p>

In a <b>PPO</b>, you choose a primary care physician or specialist from a list of providers who
belong to the PPO.  If you want to see a specific physician outside the PPO, you will have to
pay an extra fee.  If you already have a family physician, you will need to make sure he or she
is part of the PPO network offered by the health care plan you are considering.  <b>Whether
you're considering a new health care plan through your work or seeking health care
insurance on your own.  You should know all the facts about what is and isn't covered
before you enroll.<p>

<hr>
</b><h3>ASSESSING YOUR NEEDS:</h3>


<h4>What do you Need from a health care plan?</h4>
<b>

</b>Health care coverage, just like cars, comes in different makes and models.  Choosing one
depends on your family's needs.  Ask yourself a few important questions to check what type of
plan you need:<p>

<h4>How old are you?</h4>

Men and women have different health care needs.  Women should make sure a prospective
plan covers annual diagnostic exams.  For men fifty years and older, colon and prostate cancer
screening tests are recommended annually.  Make sure these types of tests are included.  Many
seniors have prescription drug needs--compare several plans, "out-of-pocket" drug costs. 
Remember that cheaper is not always better if a plan doesn't cover your specific treatment
need!<p>

<p>

<h4>Do you have a family?</h4>
<p>

Any plan you choose should provide options for covering your children and your spouse. 
Does the plan cover annual checkups and immunizations?  What will it cost you "out-of-pocket" to bring a child to the emergency room?<p>

<p>

Does a family member have a specific chronic condition, like diabetes, which would require
special medicines, self-care education programs, medical equipment and supplies?  Not all
plans offer all of these programs and the costs can add up--ask before you make a decision!<p>

<p>

<h4>Do you have a re-existing condition?</h4>

Some plans simply won't cover any pre-existing condition you might have, or they will place a
moratorium on covering a specific illness for a set time period.  Also, in an attempt to control
costs, many plans may restrict access to more expensive but proven drugs and treatment
products.<p>

<p>

For example, if you or a family member have hemophilia, the types of blood products that are
covered are a major health concern and can have a huge financial impact on what you may
personally have to pay.  For any serious condition, talk to your physician or local disease
organization if you need to know more about what type of specific treatment questions to ask a
plan.<p>

<p>

<h4>Is there a history of specific illness in your family?</h4>
<p>

You need to evaluate if you may be likely to suffer from an illness that has historically shown
up in your family: For example, the tendency toward coronary disease can be inherited.  If
your family has a history of heart disease, look for a plan with good coronary illness
prevention and treatment coverage.<p>

<p>
<hr>
<h3>THE NEXT STEP-- Ask more questions!</h3>
<b><p>

</b>We recommend asking the following specific questions when you are shopping for a plan:<p>

<p>

Can I choose my own primary care physician?<p>

<p>

What is the process for obtaining a referral to a specialist?<p>

<p>

Does the plan include specialists trained for my condition?<p>

<p>

What type of services require prior authorization?<p>

<p>

Is my pre-existing condition covered?<p>

If so, are medicines, self-care education programs, medical equipment and supplies available
to treat my illness covered?<p>

<p>

Are prescription drugs covered?<p>

<p>

Are all drugs available or is there a limited list or formulary?<p>

<p>

Are checkups, immunizations and other prevention programs covered?<p>

<p>

Is there a cap on benefits?  What are the deductibles, premiums and co-payments?<p>

<p>

Who determines when I would be moved out of intensive care and/or discharged from the
hospital?<p>

<p>

What percentage of home-health care is covered by your health plan when you are discharged
from the hospital--50%, 75%, or 100%?<p>

<p>

<b>Remember that Cheaper is not always better if a plan doesn't cover your specific
treatment need!<p>

<p>
<hr>
</b><h3>How can you find out what a health care plan covers?</h3>

The first step is to ask each prospective plan the questions outlined on the previous page and to
factor in your own personal needs.  Oddly enough in many states, health care plans aren't
required to provide you with the answers.  Some states, like California, have disclosure laws,
but health plans still don't disclose what services aren't covered, and what restrictions are
placed on certain services.  But how they answer your questions can give you good idea of
how you will be treated once you are enrolled.<p>

<p>

<h4>Here are a few good tips to check on a health care plan:</h4>
<b><p>

</b>Ask friends and co-workers about the type of plan they use.  Are they satisfied?<p>

<p>

Ask your doctor or friend's doctor what they think of a plan, particularly regarding how a plan
would cover a chronic condition or specific treatment need.<p>

<p>

Call a disease support group and check to see if they have any references on health care plans.<p>

<p>

Ask your doctor's benefits coordinator.<p>

<p>

<b>For any serious condition, talk to your physician or local disease organization if you need
to know more about what type of specific treatment questions to ask a plan.<p>

<p>
<hr>
</b><h3>How to dig deeper</h3>
<b><p>

</b>You can find out how a plan makes certain decisions that will impact your coverage and
whether the plan has a process to make non-covered and whether the plan has a process to
make non-covered or experimental treatments available to you.  This will require you to ask a
number of questions and talk with the plan's manager.<p>

<p>

<h4>Ask these questions:</h4>
<b><p>

</b>Is there a procedure to appeal a decision regarding my coverage?<p>

<p>

Does my physician have a case manager to assist patient inquiries?<p>

<p>

If an experimental procedure is the best treatment for me, will it be covered?<p>

<p>

Does the plan include a point-of-service option?  How does it work?<p>

<p>
<hr>
<h3>What is citizens for the "Right to know"?</h3>
<b><p>

</b>Citizens for the "Right to Know" is a network of hundreds of consumer and specific disease
organizations representing hundreds of thousands of patients across the country.  The members

<title>Consumer Guide to Dental Insurance</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2><center>What Everyone Should Know About Selecting And
Using Dental Benefits : A Consumer's Guide To
Dental Insurance</h2>
<hr>

</center>
<h3>It's Important To Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is</h3>

When most people think about health insurance, they think first about covering costs of
treatment for serious medical conditions or accidents.  That's a natural thing to do.  But there's
another type of insurance that's equally important to your well being--dental insurance. 
Because dental disease is so common, being protected by dental insurance and using it wisely
are essential safeguards for you and your family.<p>

<h3>There's A World Of Difference Between Medical And Dental
Disease...</h3>
<b>

</b>Unlike medical disease, which can be both unpredictable and catastrophic, most dental
ailments are preventable.  Preventive care, including regular checkups and cleanings, is the
key to maintaining your oral health.  With regular visits to the dentist, problems can be
diagnosed early and treated without extensive testing or elaborate and expensive procedures. 
That keeps the costs of dental care much lower than those of medical care.  In fact, total
spending for dental care is decreasing.  In 1970, it made up 6.3 percent of total health care
expenditures.  But in 1991, dental care's share of health care spending was only 4.9 percent.<p>

<p>

<h3>...And Between Medical And Dental Benefits</h3>
<b><p>

</b>Medical insurance is designed primarily to cover the costs of diagnosing, treating and curing
serious illnesses.  This process may involve a primary care physician and multiple specialists,
a variety of tests performed by doctors and laboratories, multiple procedures and masses of
medications.  Depending on the health, age and attitudes of people in the medical coverage
group, costs can fluctuate widely.<p>

<p>

Dental insurance works differently.  Most dental coverage is designed to ensure that the patient
receives regular <b>preventive</b> care.  High quality dental care rarely requires the complex,
multiple resources often required by medical care.  A thorough examination by the dentist and
a set of x-rays are all it usually takes to diagnose a problem.  By and large, dental care is
provided by a general practitioner, although some cases may require the services of a dental
specialist.  Because most dental disease is preventable, dental benefits plans are structured to
encourage patients to get the regular, routine care so vital to preventing and diagnosing the
onset of serious disease.<p>

<p>

In fact, most dental benefits plans require patients to assume a greater portion of the costs for
treatment of dental disease than for preventive procedures.  By placing an emphasis on
prevention, and by covering regular teeth cleaning and check-ups, Americans saved nearly
$100 billion in dental care costs during the 1980s.<p>

<p>

<h3>Dental Insurance Is Helping Keep America Healthy</h3>
<b><p>

</b>The availability of dental insurance is the single greatest factor in helping you get the dental
care you need.  More than 48 percent of all Americans--113 million of us--are covered by
privately financed dental insurance plans.  This compares with just 12 million people who had
such coverage in 1970.  As a result of increased access to regular care and the widespread use
of preventive measures, the incidence of dental decay has dropped sharply.  Half of today's
school children never have had a cavity.<p>

<p>

<h3>Different Plans for Different Needs--Know the Differences</h3>
<b><p>

</b>Consumers can choose from an assortment of dental benefits plans that accommodate a variety
of needs and expectations.  The following factors differentiate one plan from another:<p>

<p>

1.  the type of third party responsible for funding and administration of the plan;<p>

<p>

2.  the alternatives offered for selecting a dentist;<p>

<p>

3.  the structure used to compensate the dentist for services provided; and<p>

<p>

4.  the method by which benefits and payments are calculated.<p>

<p>

Understanding these differences is essential to making an informed decision when selecting a
plan and using the benefits.<p>

<p>

<h3>1.  Third Parties</h3>
<b><p>

</b>Regardless of the dental benefits plan, there are usually three parties involved: you, the
patient; the dentist providing care; and a third party with whom you or your employer
contracts for coverage.  If your options include a plan funded by your employer, you may
have an administrator responsible for processing and payment of claims.  The primary
responsibility of the third party is to provide the financial foundation for your dental benefits
plan.  There are three types of third parties.<p>

<p>

<b>Dental Service Corporations.</b>  These not-for-profit organizations negotiate and administer
contracts for dental care to individuals or specific groups of patients.  Delta Dental Plan and
Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans are examples of this third party type.<p>

<p>

<b>Insurance Carriers.  </b>These for-profit companies underwrite the financial risk of, and process
payment claims for, dental services.  Carriers contract with individuals or patient groups to
offer a variety of dental benefits packages, often including both fee-for-service and managed
care plans.<p>

<p>

<b>Self-Funded Insurers.</b>  These companies use their own funds to underwrite the expense of
providing dental care to their employees.  The company pays for the dental costs of its
employees, usually with limitations on services and fixed-dollar allocations.<p>

<p>

<h3>2.  Choosing a Dentist</h3>
<p>

Dental benefits plans can be categorized by the options offered for selecting a dentist.  Some
plans allow you the freedom to choose your own dentist, while others, in exchange for lower
rates, limit your choice.  These two alternatives are called open and closed panel plans.<p>

<p>

<b>Open Panel.</b>  This type of dental benefits plan allows covered patients to receive care from
any dentist and allows any dentist to participate.  Any dentist may accept or refuse to treat
patients enrolled in the plan.  Open panel plans often are described as <i>freedom of choice</i> plans.<p>

<p>

<b>Closed Panel.</b>  This type of plan allows covered patients to receive care only from dentists
who have signed a contract of participation with the third party.  The third party contracts with
a certain percentage of dentists within a particular geographic area.  There are two types of
closed panel plans.<p>

<p>

<b><i>Preferred Provider Organization (PPO)</i> - </b>This plan allows a particular group of patients to
receive dental care from a defined panel of dentists.  The participating dentist agrees to charge
less than usual fees to this specific patient base, providing savings for the plan purchaser.  If
the patient chooses to see a dentist who is not designated as a "preferred provider," that patient
may be required to pay a greater share of the fee-for-service.<p>

<p>

<b><i>Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO)</i></b> - This closed panel plan allows a particular group of
patients to receive dental care only from participating dentists.  Although there may be some
exceptions for emergency and out-of-area care, if a patient decides to see a dentist which is not
listed on the EPO panel, charges for service will not be covered by the plan.  Because
participating dentists are required to offer substantial fee reductions, many dentists elect not to
participate in EPO-type plans.  Under some benefits plans, participating dentists may be
salaried employees of the EPO.  An EPO contracts with a limited number of practitioners
within a geographic area.  Access to necessary specialized care can be restricted.  The EPO
also may limit the amount of services that a patient can receive in a given calendar year.<p>

<p>

<h3>3.  Paying The Dentist</h3>
<b><p>

</b>When choosing a benefits plan, it is important to know who pays what to whom.  Dental plans
can be categorized into three types based on the compensation and treatment provided.<p>

<p>

<b>Indemnity Plans.</b>  This type of plan pays the dentist on a traditional fee-for-service basis.  A
monthly premium is paid by the patient and/or the employer to an insurance carrier, which
directly reimburses the dentist for the services provided.  Insurance companies usually pay
between 50 percent and 80 percent of the dentist's fee for covered services; the remaining 20
percent to 50 percent is paid by the patient.  These plans often have a pre-determined
deductible, a dollar amount which varies from plan to plan, that the patient must pay before
the insurance carrier will begin paying for care.  Indemnity plans also can limit the amount of
services covered within a given year and pay the dentist based on a variety of fee schedules.<p>

<p>

<b>Capitation Plans.</b>  This type of plan provides comprehensive dental care to enrolled patients
through designated provider dentists.  A Dental Health Maintenance Organization (DHMO) is
a common example of a capitation plan.  The dentist is paid on a per capita (per head) basis
rather than for actual treatment provided.  Participating dentists receive a fixed monthly fee
based on the number of patients assigned to the office.  In addition to premiums, patient co-payments may be required for each visit.<p>

<p>

<b>Direct Reimbursement Plans.</b>  Under this self-funded plan, an employer or company sponsor
pays for dental care with its own funds, rather than paying premiums to an insurance carrier or
third party.  The patient pays the dentist directly and, once furnished with a receipt showing
payment and services received, the employer reimburses the employee a fixed percentage of
the dental care costs.  The plan may limit the amount of dollars an employee can spend on
dental care within a given year, but often places no limit on services provided.  Patients can
select a dentist of their choice and, in conjunction with the dentists, can play an active role in
planning the treatment most appropriate and affordable to ensure optimum oral health.<p>

<p>

<h3>4.  Calculating Payments</h3>
<b><p>

</b>A clear understanding of the methods used to calculate benefits and payments will allow you to
compare and evaluate the purchasing power of different plans.  The following are four
common payment schedules.<p>

<p>

<b>Capitation (per capita).</b>  This fee schedule is used by plans structured to provide a predefined
level of benefits.  Because dental care needs vary by individual, it is critical to have a thorough
understanding of the level or range of services "defined" or covered by the plan.  Under this
fee schedule, the patient is responsible to pay for treatment not covered within the scope of the
plan.  In some cases, the allocated payment a dentist receives from the benefits plan, including
patient co-payments, is less than the actual cost of providing care.  Patients often settle for
less-than-optimal treatment alternatives or postpone necessary services when their co-payments
do not cover all possible options.<p>

<p>

<b>Table of Schedule of Allowances.</b>  Plans using this form of benefits calculation establish a
maximum dollar limit for each covered procedure, regardless of the fee charged by the dentist. 
If you select a plan that uses this type of table or schedule, ask how often the table is adjusted
for inflation or for changes in accepted dental procedures.  In these plans, the difference
between the allowed charge and the dentist's fee is paid directly by the patient.<p>

<p>

Patients should understand that contracted fee reductions listed in some plan allowance
schedules can significantly diminish the level and quality of care delivered.  Contracted rates
are based on the size of the patient population and projections of the amount and type of
treatment performed within a given time frame.  Since cost control drives this payment
approach, your ability to choose your dentist or see a specialist may be limited.<p>

<p>

<b>Direct Reimbursement.</b>  In this self-funded plan, the patient pays the doctor for services. 
The employer or plan sponsor reimburses the employee for a predetermined percentage of all
costs.  Under this fee schedule, the employee has an incentive to work with the dentist to plan
healthy and economical solutions.<p>

<p>

<b>Usual, Customary &amp; Reasonable (UCR).</b>  Most indemnity (traditional fee-for-service) plans
use this payment schedule.  It allows patients to select their own dentist.  The UCR schedule
pays benefits based on a fixed percentage of the lesser of the dentist's fee or the fee determined
by the insurance carrier to be "usual," "customary" or "reasonable" for the service in the
community in which the service was delivered.  Wide fluctuations in UCR fees between
communities have made this payment system highly controversial.  Because many insurance
carriers set the UCR percentage too low in comparison to the area's usual professional fees,
patients may wind up paying more out-of-pocket.  Most payments are made directly to the
dentist, but in some instances they are made to the beneficiary.<p>

<p>

<h3>Dental Plans Do Have Their Limitations</h3>
<b><p>

</b>Today's health insurance, including your dental plan, is designed to help you get the care you
need at a reasonable cost.  Because each person's oral health is different, costs can vary
widely.  To control dental treatment costs, most plans will limit the amount of care you can
receive in a given year.  This is done by placing a dollar "cap" or limit on the amount of
benefits you can receive, or by restricting the number or type of services that are covered. 
Some plans may totally exclude certain services or treatment to lower costs.  Know specifically
what services your plan covers and excludes.<p>

<p>

There are, however, certain limitations and exclusions in most dental benefits plans that are
designed to keep dentistry's costs from going up without penalizing the patient.  All plans
exclude experimental procedures and services not performed by or under the supervision of a
dentist, but there may be some less obvious exclusions.  Sometimes dental coverage and health
insurance may overlap.   Read and understand the conditions of your dental plan.  Exclusions
in your dental plan may be covered by your medical insurance.<p>

<p>

The California Dental Association encourages consumers to choose plans that impose dollar or
service limitations, rather than those that exclude categories of service.  By doing so, you can
receive the care that's best for you and actively participate with the dentist in the development
of treatment plans that give the most and highest quality care.<p>

<p>

To help you stretch each dental benefit dollar, most plans provide patients and purchasers with
special administrative services.  Find out if your plan provides the following mechanisms to
help you budget, analyze and dispute, if necessary, the costs of your dental care.<p>

<p>

<b>Predetermination of Costs.</b>  Some plans encourage you or your dentist to submit a treatment
proposal to the plan administrator before receiving treatment.  After review, the plan
administrator may determine: the patient's eligibility; the eligibility period; services covered;
the patient's required co-payment; and the maximum limitation.  Some plans require
predetermination for treatment exceeding a specified dollar amount.  This process is also
known as preauthorization, precertification, pretreatment review or prior authorization.<p>

<p>

Although your dental benefits plan may not be bound to predetermined costs, this mechanism
can help you and your dentist plan and budget a treatment plan appropriate to your oral health
needs.<p>

<p>

<b>Annual Benefits Limitations.</b>  To help contain costs, your plan may limit your benefits by
number of procedures and/or dollar amount in a given year.  In most cases, particularly if
you've been getting regular preventive care, these limitations allow for adequate coverage.  By
knowing in advance what and how much your plan allows, you and your dentist can plan
treatment that will minimize your out-of-pocket expenses while maximizing compensation
offered by your benefits plan.<p>

<p>

<b>Peer Review for Dispute Resolution.</b>  Many plans provide a peer review mechanism through
which disputes between third parties, patients and dentists can be resolved, eliminating many
costly court cases.  Peer review is established to ensure fairness, individual case consideration
and a thorough examination of records, treatment procedures and results.  Most disputes can
be resolved satisfactorily for all parties.<p>

<p>

<b>Premium Adjustments and Reevaluations.</b>  Patients and plan purchasers should insist on
regular reviews of premium levels to ensure that UCR or Table of Allowances payment
schedules are equitable.  This analysis can help optimize your benefit levels, ensuring that
every dollar you spend is used wisely.<p>

<p>

<b>Coordination of Benefits.</b>  If you are covered under two dental benefits plans, notify the
administrator or carrier of your primary plan about your dual coverage status.  Plan benefits
coordination can help protect your rights and maximize your entitled benefits.  In some cases
you may be assured full coverage where plan benefits overlap, and receive a benefit from one
plan where the other plan lists an exclusion.<p>

<p>

<h3>Eight Things To Consider When Choosing Your Dental Plan</h3>
<b><p>

</b>What looks like a bargain today may not be a good buy in the long run.  While your out-of-pocket costs are, of course, an important part of your decision-making process when choosing
a dental plan, they are not the only criteria to use when evaluating your options.  Your
primary focus should be to determine whether the coverage will satisfy your dental care needs. 
Consider the following:<p>

<p>

<i>1.	Does the plan give you the freedom to choose your own dentist or are you restricted to
a panel of dentists selected by the insurance company?</i>  If you have a family dentist
with whom you are satisfied, consider the effects changing dentists will have on the
quality or quantity of care you receive.  Because regular visits to the dentist reduce the
likelihood of developing serious dental disease, it's best to have and maintain an
established relationship with a dentist you trust.<p>

<p>

<i>2.	Who controls treatment decisions--you and your dentist or the dental plan?</i>  Many plans
require dentists to follow treatment plans that rely on a Least Expensive Alternative
Treatment (LEAT) approach.  If there are multiple treatment options for a specific
condition, the plan will pay for the less expensive treatment option.  If you choose a
treatment option that may better suit your individual needs and your long-term oral
health, you will be responsible for paying the difference in costs.  It's important to
know who makes the treatment decisions under your plan.  These cost control measures
may have an impact on the quality of care you'll receive.<p>

<p>

<i>3.	Does the plan cover diagnostic, preventive and emergency services?  If so, to what
extent?</i>  Most dental plans provide coverage for selected diagnostic services, preventive
care and emergency treatment that are basic for maintaining good oral health.  But the
extent or frequency of the services covered by some plans may be limited.  Depending
upon your individual oral health needs, you may be required to pay the dentist directly
for a portion of this basic care.  Find out how much treatment is allowed in any given
year without cost to you, and how much you will have to pay for yourself.<p>

<p>

Every dental care plan is different.  It's your responsibility to be informed about what your
specific plan will cover.  As a basis of comparison, the following services should be covered
in full, with no deductible or patient co-payment:<p>

<p>

			<i>Initial Oral Examination</i>--once per dentist<p>

			<i>Recall Examinations</i>--twice per year<p>

			<i>Complete x-ray survey</i>--once every three years<p>

			<i>Cavity-detecting bite-wing x-rays</i>--once per year<p>

			<i>Prophylaxis or teeth cleaning</i>--twice per year<p>

			<i>Topical Fluoride treatment</i>--twice per year<p>

			<i>Sealants</i>--for those under age 18<p>

<p>

<i>4.	What routine corrective treatment is covered by the dental plan?  What share of the
costs will be yours?</i>  While preventive care lessens the risk of serious dental disease,
additional treatment may be required to ensure optimal health.  A broad range of
treatment can be defined as routine.  Most plans cover 70 percent to 80 percent of such
treatment.  Patients are responsible for the remaining costs.  Examples of routine care
include:<p>

<p>

			<i>Restorative care</i> - amalgam and composite resin fillings and stainless
steel crowns on primary teeth<p>

			<i>Endodontics</i> - treatment of root canals and removal of tooth nerves<p>

			<i>Oral Surgery</i> - tooth removal (not including bony impaction) and minor
surgical procedures such as tissue biopsy and drainage of minor oral
infections.<p>

			<i>Periodontics </i>- treatment of uncomplicated periodontal disease including
scaling, root planning and management of acute infections or lesions<p>

			<i>Prosthodontics</i>--repair and/or relining or reseating of existing dentures
and bridges.<p>

<p>

	Understand what routine dental care is covered by the plan, and what percentage of the
costs will come our of your pocket.<p>

<p>

<i>5.	What major dental care is covered by the plan?  What percentage of these costs will
you be required to pay?</i>  Since dental benefits encourage you to get preventive care,
which often eliminates the need for major dental work, most plans are not generous
when it comes to paying for major dental work, most plans cover less than 50 percent
of the cost of major treatment.  Most plans limit the benefits--both in number of
procedures and dollar amount--that are covered in a given year.  Be aware of these
restrictions when choosing your plan and as you and your dentist develop treatment best
suited for you.  Major dental care includes:<p>

<p>

			<i>Restorative care</i>--gold restorations and individual crowns<p>

			<i>Oral Surgery</i>--removal of impacted teeth and complex oral surgery
procedures.<p>

			<i>Periodontics</i>--treatment of complicated periodontal disease requiring
surgery involving bones, underlying tissues or bone grafts.<p>

			<i>Orthodontics</i>--treatment including retainers, braces and/or diagnostic
materials.<p>

			<i>Dental Implants</i>--either surgical placement or restoration<p>

			<i>Prosthodontics</i>--fixed bridges, partial dentures and removable or fixed
dentures.<p>

<p>

<i>6.	Will the plan allow referrals to specialists?  Will my dentist and I be able to choose the
specialist?  </i>Some plans limit referrals to specialists.  Your dentist may be required to
refer you to a limited selection of specialists who have contracted with the plan's third
party.  You also may be required to get permission from the plan administrator <b>before</b>
being referred to a specialist.  If you choose a plan with these limitations, make sure
qualified specialists are available in your area.  Look for a plan with a broad selection
of different types of specialists.  If you have children, you may prefer a plan that
allows a pediatric dentist to be your child's primary care dentist.  Since specialized
treatment is generally more costly than routine care, some plans discourage the use of
specialists.  While many general practitioners are qualified to perform some specialized
services, complex procedures often require the skills of a dentist with special training. 
Discuss the options with your dentist before deciding who is best qualified to deliver
treatment.<p>

<p>

<i>7.	Can you see the dentist when you need to, and schedule appointment times convenient
for you?</i>  Dentists participating in closed panel or capitation plans may have select
hours to see plan patients.  They may schedule appointments for these patients on given
days, or at specified hours of the day, restricting your access.  Some dentist's fees for
seeing you on weekends or during emergencies are high than those the plan allows. 
You may be required to pay additional costs yourself.  If you select these types of
plans, have a clear understanding of your dentist's policies as well as the plan's dentist-to-patient ratio.  It's the best way to ensure your access to care is not unduly restricted
and that you are not surprised by higher fees the plan does not cover.<p>

<p>

<i>8.	Will the plan provide benefits to patients who may also be covered by another dental
plan?</i>  It is not unusual to be eligible for dual benefits.  You may be covered under
your company's plan as well as under that of your spouse's employer.  In analyzing
your options, make sure to look for a plan that allows <b>coordination of benefits.</b><p>

  	You should be entitled to either 100 percent coverage or some form of premium credit. 
By coordinating benefits, you can eliminate being penalized or denied coverage when
the two plans have conflicting exclusions.<p>

<p>

<h3>Getting The Best And Most From Your Plan</h3>
<b><p>

</b><p>

To take full advantage of your dental benefits plan, visit the dentist regularly and get the
preventive care that will keep your mouth healthy.  Follow the treatment plan you and your
dentist have developed.  Do your dental homework--brush and floss regularly and maintain a
regular schedule of oral examinations and teeth cleanings.<p>

<p>

Should you need treatment for particular conditions, follow the procedure for predetermination
required by your plan.  Find out what your insurance will cover.  Feel free to discuss a
payment plan with your dentist for your portion of the treatment costs.<p>

<p>

<h3>Making An Informed Choice</h3>
<b><p>

</b>The law mandates that consumers with dental coverage receive a fully detailed patient
information handbook--a Description of Benefits--that clearly outlines coverage, limitations
and exclusions.  Before selecting a plan that best suits your needs, ask your carrier or company
benefits coordinator for a copy of the benefits handbook.  If you have questions about
coverage, exclusions, calculation of benefits or payment of benefits, ask before making your
plan selection.  Find out which plans your dentist participates in and why.  That's the best way
for you to get care from the dentist of your choice, and still take advantage of the costs savings
due to you.<p>

<p>

Selecting an insurance program wisely isn't simple.  But having the facts to make an informed
decision can make a difference.  No plan is perfect; each has its advantages and limitations. 
Read the fine print.  And by all means ask questions.  The more you know about dental
benefits, the better equipped you will be to select the best coverage for your dental health.<p>

<title>Is Your Dental Coverage Good Enough</title>

</head>
<body>
<h2><center>IS YOUR DENTAL COVERAGE GOOD ENOUGH ???</h2>
</center>
<hr>

The California Dental Association introduced the "Dental Patient Bill of Rights" to explain
individual patient rights and "Just The Facts, Please" to simplify complicated insurance
company terms.  This brochure is the latest in the series.  It is designed to help you secure the
best possible dental coverage.<p>

<h3><center>START WITH THE BASICS</h3>
</center>


<h4>What is Dental Coverage?</h4>

Dental coverage, or more correctly a dental benefits plan, reimburses you for certain dental
expenses according to written agreement.<p>

Dental benefits usually are provided under a contract between your employer or union (the
plan's "sponsor") and an insurance company, sometimes referred to as a third-party carrier.<p>


<h4>Why Do Rates Increase?</h4>

In general, rates go up to reflect rising costs, increased use of benefits, or an increase in the
fee charged by the insurance company.  Sponsors sometimes reduce your benefits to postpone
rate hikes.<p>


<h4>$$$ vs. Care</h4>

Some plans have not kept pace with advances in dentistry, so you may find certain common
procedures excluded or severely limited.  Also, a plan may allow the insurance company to
substitute a cheaper service that, in the carrier's opinion, is professionally adequate.<p>

Understandably, people make health care decisions based on how much their coverage pays,
assuming insurance will always take care of basic needs.  Since this is frequently not the case,
preventive measures and needed work are postponed.<p>

DON'T DO IT.  Prevention is the most efficient and least costly way to protect your oral
health.  Once dental disease develops, it will not heal without treatment.<p>


<h4>General Health Insurance vs. Dental Coverage</h4>

Unlike diseases of the rest of your body, problems that affect your oral health usually are
preventable, making catastrophic dental coverage generally unnecessary.  It is not valid to
justify increases in dental insurance premiums by comparing them to escalating health care
costs.  Be wary of this kind of explanation.  It's like comparing apples and oranges.<p>


<center><h3>SOME THINGS TO CONSIDER:</h3>
</center>

<h4>A Prevention-Oriented Program</h4>

A good dental plan should include 100 percent coverage for all diagnostic and preventive
procedures.  Any dental plan should respect your <i>right to choose your own dentist.</i><p>


<h4>The Doctor/Patient Relationship</h4>

People stay with a dentist whose skills they know and trust.  The relationship between a dentist
and a patient is threatened as new programs are designed to make group coverage less costly
for sponsors.  In some cases, the new policies don't cover treatment provided by your family
dentist.<p>

You are the best judge of dentists.  Neither an insurance company nor your employer knows
your individual preferences or needs.  They should not choose your dentist for you.<p>


<h4>Your Individuality</h4>

Your individual needs may not have been taken into consideration in defining group coverage. 
To create a picture of an "average" patient, you and your co-workers are reduced to a series of
numbers that reflect age, education, and marital status.  You can average numbers.  There is
no such thing as an average person.<p>


<h4>Your Best Interests</h4>

Your coverage may be negotiated by administrators whose primary concern may not be your
family's dental needs.  Have you ever wondered how your reimbursements are determined? 
Who judges the appropriateness of treatment agreed to by you and your dentist?  Where is that
person located?  Does that person have the dental training and education to make such
decisions?<p>


<h4>Your Influence As A Consumer</h4>

No matter who pays for your dental benefits, you have a right to be heard.  Dental coverage,
like salary and vacation time, is part of your total compensation package.  EXERCISE YOUR
RIGHT.  Discuss your concerns.  Voice your preferences.  Any reasonable employer will
listen.<p>


<center><h3>WHAT CAN I DO?</h3>
</center>

<h4>Read Your Benefits Booklet</h4>

Current federal law requires your plan sponsor to provide a full disclosure and description of
your benefits package upon your employment or enrollment into the program.  READ IT!<p>


<h4>Ask Questions</h4>

Once you've read your booklet, ask questions on anything you do not understand.  If your
benefits manager cannot answer your questions, call the insurance company.  If you still can't
get answers, you may want to talk to someone at the California Department of Insurance.  It
has a consumer hotline:  1-800-927-4357.<p>

If your coverage is valid only at employer-specified dentists or through service corporations
such as Delta Dental or Blue Shield, you will need to contact the State Department of
Corporations in Sacramento, rather than the Department of Insurance.<p>


<h4>Investigate Discrepancies</h4>

If you receive payment from an insurance company that is less than you expected, talk to your
benefits manager and/or the insurance company about your concerns.  You have the <i>right to
know</i> how your benefits are calculated.<p>


<h4>Know the Facts</h4>

Insist on a clear description of your dental coverage.  Know the different types (See our
brochure, "Just The Facts, Please") and their limitations.  To take advantage of your benefits,
you may have to stop seeing your family dentist.<p>


<h4>Do Your Homework</h4>

Insurance companies <i>can</i> create plans that satisfy both your needs and those of your employer. 
Ask your friends who work in other industries and companies about their benefits.  Compare
your plan to theirs.  Get information about programs you like and pass it along to your benefits
manager or your supervisor.  Talk to fellow employees about options.  A fringe benefit that
isn't used because it doesn't meet your needs wastes your employer's money.  Speak up!<p>


<h4>Draw Your Own Conclusions</h4>

What an insurance company pays on claims may bear no resemblance to the average dental
fees in your community.  Insurance companies can set rates which may not relate to actual
costs.  Consider that individual dentists' fees vary due to differences in training, overhead,
location and the time required to perform procedures.  If your claim was not paid in full, find
out why.  And if you do not agree, with the insurance company, challenge the reimbursement
in writing.  It's your right.<p>

See if you are getting the most from your dental coverage by answering the following
questions <b>YES</b> or <b>NO.</b><p>

YES __  NO __My dental plan provides benefits for a wide range of preventive procedures
and dental services.<p>

YES __  NO __  My coverage allows me and my dentist to develop a treatment plan best
suited to my personal needs.<p>

YES __  NO __  My employer offers at least one program which allows me to choose my
own dentist.<p>

YES __  NO __  My employer provides a clear and complete description of the benefits
programs and options available.<p>

YES __  NO __  My employer or union evaluates employee needs before selecting the
compensation package.<p>

YES __  NO __  My employer is available to discuss concerns or unmet needs in relation to
my dental benefits.<p>

YES __  NO __  I know the differences in indemnity coverage and managed care programs,
such as preferred provider organizations, dental care service plans, and capitation plans.<p>

YES __  NO __  I have documented and communicated with my employer or union my good
and bad experiences with the plan.<p>

YES __  NO __  I intend to review my options before plan renewal time.<p>

YES __  NO __  I talk and compare notes with co-workers, friends, family and my benefits
manager because I know that no company wants to pay for dental coverage that is not

A majority of "yes" answers probably means you are getting the most from your coverage. 
Too many "no" answers mean changes are needed.  Changes will not occur unless you ask for
them. It's up to you.<p>

<h2><center>JUST THE FACTS, PLEASE ???</h2>
</center>
<hr>

While the roles you and your dentist play in maintaining your oral health are easy to
understand, the role of dental benefits is sometimes unclear.  Insurance industry jargon used to
describe your benefits often blurs the actual terms of coverage.  We encourage you to be
informed on how your dental benefit plans work so that you can make the most of your
coverage.<p>

This brochure contains important information to clarify sometimes confusing aspects of dental
coverage.  First, some definitions...<p>

<h4><center>WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?</h4>
</center>

<b>UCR:</b>  A widely used method, which may vary from company to company, for determining
benefit reimbursement levels.  The initials simply mean:<p>

<b>U</b>sual.  The fee that an individual dentist most frequently charges for a given dental
service.<p>

	<b>C</b>ustomary.  A fee determined by the insurance company based on the range of usual
fees charged by dentists in the same geographic area.<p>

<b>R</b>easonable.  A fee which is justifiable considering special circumstances of the
particular care rendered.<p>

<b>Table of Allowances:</b>  Assigns a specific dollar to each dental procedure.<p>

<b>Pre-determination:</b>  After the treatment plan is decided upon by the patient and the dentist,
the insurance company reports back on what portion of the treatment plan will be covered.<p>

<b>Freedom of Choice:</b>  Allows the patient to choose any dentist.  Coverage with this feature
allows you to receive full benefits for treatment provided by any dentist of your choice.<p>

<b>Limitations:</b>  Limits the benefits for procedures or the number of times a procedure will be
covered.<p>

<b>Exclusions:</b>  Denies benefit coverage for certain procedures.<p>

<b>Least Expensive Alternate Treatment:</b>  The insurance company's contractual arrangement
with the policyholder allows the insurance company to substitute a less expensive, but in the
insurance company's opinion, professionally adequate service.  <p>

<h4><center>HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW YOUR BENEFITS?</h4>
</center>

<b>1.</b>	What types of dental coverage are offered by your employer or union?<p>

<b>2.</b>	Which procedures does your dental plan limit or exclude?  Do certain procedures have
waiting periods?<p>

<b>3.</b>	How are your benefits calculated?  (UCR? Table of Allowances?)<p>

<b>4.</b>	Does your plan allow pre-determination of benefits?<p>

<b>5.</b>	Does your plan impose an annual maximum benefit level?<p>

<b>6.</b>	What are your co-payments?<p>

<b>7.</b>	Does your policy cover only the least expensive alternate treatment?<p>


<h4><center>TIPS ON GETTING THE MOST FROM YOUR DENTAL PLAN.</h4>
</center>

<b>1.	Read your benefits booklet.</b>  Dental health coverage is provided by your employer or
union to help you handle the costs of staying healthy.  Using them wisely is your
responsibility.<p>

<b>2.	Know your options.</b>  Be familiar with the exclusions and limitations of your coverage.<p>

<b>3.	Communicate with your dentist, employer and insurance company.</b>  Keep everyone
informed of your experiences.<p>

<b>4.	Practice good oral hygiene.</b>  Follow the hygiene habits prescribed by your dentist.<p>

<b>5.	Ask questions.</b>  Be a partner in your own dental health.<p>


<h4><center>SOME COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.</h4>
</center>

<b>Q:</b>  Why does my dental insurance pay only 50% of the charges when my policy says it will
pay 80%?<p>

<b>A:</b>  There are several possibilities.<p>

  <b>1.  </b>If your benefits are based on UCR calculation, it might indicate that the UCR data is out
of date or not specific to your local area.<p>

  <b>2.  </b>If you belong to a PPO, your full benefits will be paid only if you seek care from one of
the contracting dentists.<p>

  <b>3.</b>  If your benefits are calculated using a Table of Allowances, the table might be out of date
or set at an unrealistically low amount.<p>

  <b>4.  </b>If your policy provides for the least expensive treatment, you will be reimbursed the
stated percentage based on the cost, even if you choose alternate treatment.<p>

<b>Q:</b>  Why can't I go to any dentist?<p>

<b>A:</b>  Many employers will contract with a closed panel or preferred provider program to contain
the costs of insuring employees.  As a result, your dental benefits might only be available by
seeking care from a dentist who has contracted with that company.<p>

<b>Q:</b>  Why do my premiums keep going up?<p>

<b>A:</b>  Dental insurance premiums are in part based on the anticipated claims experience of your
group.  If that group experiences an unexpected high utilization of major dental services, the
premiums will go up.  Insurance company administrative costs and premium taxes also
contribute to the cost of dental coverage.<p>

<b>Q:  </b>Is my dentist overcharging when my insurance company reimburses me for only part of
the dental fees?<p>

<b>A:  </b>Insurance companies pay claims in various ways.  Many base reimbursements on UCR
rates.  However, even the UCR allowance may vary from company to company.  While these
reimbursements <i>usually</i> are based on what the majority of dentists in your area charge,
sometimes the figures used to calculate benefits may be out of date or not specific to your
location.  And, if the company uses a Table of Allowances, benefits assigned to specific dental
treatment may not relate to actual costs.<p>


<h4><center>WHAT DOES YOUR DENTAL BENEFIT PLAN DO FOR YOU?</h4>
</center>

Dental benefit plans help you pay for certain kinds of dental care.  Your dental care decisions
should take into account more than just what is covered.  Your dental health needs can only be
determined by you through consultation with your personal dentist.  Good dental care is your
right, and can best be attained by understanding your specific dental needs and how your
dental benefits plan relates to them.<p>

<h4><center>WHAT TYPE OF PLAN DO YOU HAVE?...NEED?...WANT?</h4>
</center>

  <b>Indemnity:</b>  Indemnity benefits are expressed as a covered fee-for-service.  This coverage
allows patients to choose their own dentist.  Limits and co-payments are set according to the
level of coverage purchased by the employer or union.<p>

<b>  Direct Reimbursement:  </b>Enables employers to offer cost-effective dental benefits while
allowing employees the freedom to choose their own dentists.  The patient receives prescribed
dental treatment and is reimbursed directly by the employer.<p>

  <b>Self Insurance:</b>  The employer assumes the role of an insuring agency.<p>

  <b>Dental Care Service Plan:</b>  A non-profit organization of participating dentists who agree to
charge enrolled patients fees which do not exceed a predetermined level.<p>

<b>  Closed Panel:</b>  Offers a limited number of facilities, and a limited number of dentists from
whom care MUST be obtained.<p>

  <b>Capitation Plan:</b>  You're assigned to a specific dental office where contracting dentists
receive a fixed monthly fee per patient regardless of whether treatment is performed.<p>

  <b>Preferred Provider Organization (PPO):</b>  A group of dentists who contract with an
insurance company to provide care at discounted fees.  ("Preferred" refers to a dentist who has
contractually agreed to provide services at discounted fees.)<p>

<h2>A PATIENT'S GUIDE TO THE DENTAL OFFICE</h2>
<p>

Information is important, so the California Dental Association has prepared this to answer your
questions about dentistry.  We suggest you keep it with your dental and medical records for
future reference.  On the following pages you can read about:<p>

<b>Dental Specialities<br>
Roles Of Dental Team Members<br>
What To Do In A Dental Emergency<br>
Your Rights As A Dental patient<p></b>

Most patients are familiar with the general dentist.  The general dentist is educated to provide
comprehensive services from dental examinations to dental surgery.<p>

  While most dental procedures can be provided by the general dentist, a patient may be
referred to a specialist if the general dentist feels special expertise is necessary.<p>

The American and California Dental Associations (ADA and CDA) recognize these eight types
of specialist:<p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Endodontist</h4>
Deals with the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease and injuries of the internal soft
tissue of the tooth (root canals).<p></li>

<li><h4>Oral And Maxillofacial Surgeon</h4>
Treats injuries and deformities, extracts teeth and performs surgery of the mouth, jaw and
face.<p></li>

<li><h4>Orthodontist</h4>
Prescribes and places corrective devices, such as braces, to align teeth and improve health and
appearance.<p></li>

<li><h4>Pediatric Dentist</h4>
Specializes in the dental health of children from birth to adolescence.<p></li>

<li><h4>Periodontist</h4>
Treats diseases of the gums.<p></li>

<li><h4>Prosthodontist</h4>
Designs and fits bridge-work and dentures.<p></li>

<li><h4>Public Health Specialist</h4>
Coordinates and administers community-wide dental care programs, including public education
on the prevention of dental disease.<p></li>

<li><h4>Oral Pathologist</h4>
Researches the causes, development and effects of oral diseases.<p></li></ul>

<h2>Members Of the Dental Team</h2>

<h3>... Who Does What</h3>

<ul><li><h4>The Dentist</h4>

The dentist is responsible and accountable for everything that goes on in the dental office. 
Only the licensed dentist is educated and trained to diagnose dental problems, plan treatment or
prescribe medication.<p>

  As long as the licensed dentist supervises, certain phases of dental treatment may be
delegated to other members of the dental team.<p></li>


<li><h4>The Dental Hygienist</h4>

The dental hygienist cleans teeth and performs other functions under the direction and
supervision of a licensed dentist.<p>

There are two categories of dental hygienist:<p>

1.  Registered Dental Hygienist (RDH)<p>

2.  Registered Dental Hygienist in Extended Functions (RDHEF)<p></li>


<li><h4>The Dental Assistant</h4>

Under the supervision of the licensed dentist, the job of the dental assistant is to help the
dentist at chairside, take x-rays, and perform other support functions.<p>

There are three categories of dental assistant:<p>

1.  Dental Assistant (DA)<p>

2.  Registered Dental Assistant (RDA)<p>

3.  Registered Dental Assistant in Extended Functions (RDAEF)<p></li>


<li><h4>The Receptionist</h4>

The receptionist generally greets you at the office, makes your appointments, takes insurance
information and serves as an information source for any questions you have about the office,
such as special hours or polices.<p></li></ul>


<h2>WHAT TO DO IN A DENTAL EMERGENCY</h2>

<h4>Toothache</h4>
Rinse the mouth vigorously with warm water.  Use dental floss to remove any trapped food. 
If swelling is present, place cold compresses to the outside of the cheek.<p>

DO NOT USE HEAT.  <p>

DO NOT place aspirin on gum tissue or aching tooth.  GO TO A DENTIST.<p>

<h4>Knocked-Out Tooth</h4>
DO NOT CLEAN THE TOOTH.  Place it in water or milk, or wrap in a clean wet cloth.  GO
TO A DENTIST IMMEDIATELY.  If you can't get dental treatment right away, rinse the
tooth (DO NOT SCRUB), then reinsert the tooth in the socket and stabilize.<p>

<h4>Broken Tooth</h4>
Use warm water to clean dirt and debris from the injured area.  Place cold compresses on the
face next to the injured tooth to minimize swelling.<p>

<h4>Object Wedged Between Teeth</h4>
Try to remove the object using dental floss.  DO NOT use sharp or pointed objects.  Guide the
floss in carefully so as not to cut the gums.<p>

<h2>DENTAL PATIENT BILL OF RIGHTS</h2>

Your dentist is the best source of information about your dental health, and wants you to feel
comfortable about services offered.  You have the right to ask questions. <b>And as an informed
dental patient you also have these important rights:</b><p>
<ul>
<li><h4>You Have A Right</h4>
to see the dentist every time you receive dental treatment.<p></li>

<li><h4>You Have A Right</h4>
to know in advance the type and expected cost of treatment.<p></li>

<li><h4>You Have A Right</h4>
to expect dental team members to use appropriate infection controls, such as gloves.<p></li>

<li><h4>You Have A Right</h4>
to ask about treatment alternatives and be told, in language you can understand, the advantages
and disadvantages of each.<p></li>

<li><h4>You Have A Right</h4>
to know the education and training of your dentist and the dental team.<p></li>

<li><h4>You Have A Right</h4>
to know what professional rules, laws and ethics apply to your dentist and the dental team.<p></li>

<li><h4>You Have A Right</h4>
to choose your own dentist.<p></li></ul>

<title>Brush, Floss & Paint</title>

</head>
<body>
<h2>BRUSH, FLOSS &amp; PAINT</h2>
<p>

<h4>Three Ways to Prevent Cavities</h4>
<p>

With the help of your dentist, preventing tooth decay can become even easier.  You may
already be aware that daily brushing and flossing are the most important weapons against the
formation of plaque, the primary cause of cavities.  In addition to your regular routine of
brushing and flossing, your dentist can apply a coat of plastic material - called a sealant - on
the top, or biting, surfaces of your teeth.  This plastic coating creates a barrier between your
teeth and seals out the decay-causing bacteria that live in plaque.<p>

<p>

<h4>What is Plaque and Why Does It Cause Cavities?</h4>
<p>

As you or your children eat and drink during the day, the foods in your mouth combine with
bacteria to produce a sticky film called plaque that attaches on and in between tooth surfaces
(tooth enamel).  Plaque often is found on the chewing surfaces of back teeth, from which it is
difficult to remove by brushing and flossing alone.  If plaque is not removed regularly from
your teeth, it can produce acids which will attack the tooth enamel and create pits or holes
(cavities) in the tooth.  This is tooth decay.<p>

<p>

<h4>How Can Sealants Help Prevent Cavities?</h4>
<p>

Coating your teeth with a slippery plastic material makes it harder for plaque to stick to the
tiny grooves on the biting surfaces of the teeth - reducing the risk of forming cavities and tooth
decay.<p>

<p>

<h4>Is It Difficult To Apply Sealants?</h4>
<p>

No.  Your dentist may use a special instrument to apply the plastic sealant on your teeth. 
Most often, it is a painless treatment that lasts for many months.<p>

<p>

<h4>Who Should Get Sealants?</h4>
<p>

Sealants are most effective in reducing cavities in children with newly formed permanent teeth. 
They are useful in cutting down formation of decay in adult teeth, as well.  An application of
sealants is a preventive measure to keep teeth healthy.  It is an effective way to reduce the
need for fillings and more expensive treatments that may be required to repair the damage
from cavities, so sealants can also save you money.<p>

<p>

<h4>Ask your CDA dentist whether sealants would be an appropriate treatment
for you and your children.</h4>

<h2>Cepillese, Use El Hilo Dental Sellese Los Dientes</h2>
<p>

<h4>Tres Maneras De Prevenir Las Caries</h4>
<p>

Con la ayuda de su dentista, resultara todavia mas facil prevenir el deterioro de los dientes.
Quizas usted ya sabe que cepillarse los dientes y pasarse el hilo dental a diario constituyen las
armas mas importantes contra la formacion de la placa dental, que es la causa principal de las
caries. Ademas de la rutina cotidiana de lavarse los dientes y pasarse el hilo dental, su dentista
puede aplicar una capa de material plastico - llamado sellador - sobre las superficies de los
dientes usados para morder. Esta capa de plastico crea una barrera entre sus dientes y los
acidos, y no deja entrar las bacterias que viven en la placa dental que causan el deteriroro de
los dientes.<p>

<p>

<h4>Que Es La Placa Dental Y Por Que Causa Caries?</h4>
<p>

Cuando usted o sus ninos comen o beben durante el dia, la comida se combina con las
bacterias que estan dentro de la boca para formar una pelicula pegajosa que se llama placa
dental, la cual se deposita entre los dientes sobre la superficie (esmalte). La placa se encuentra
mayormente sobre la superficie de las muelas traseras que se usan para masticar, de donde es
dificil quitarla con solo cepillarse y pasarse el hilo dental. Si la placa no es quitada
regularmente de los dientes, puede producir acidos que atacan el esmalte y dar lugar a hoyos y
cavidades (caries) en los dientes. Esto causa deterioro de los dientes.<p>

<p>

<h4>Como Pueden Los Selladores Prevenir Las Caries?</h4>
<p>

Al recubrir sus dientes con un material plastico resbaloso es mas dificil que la placa se pegue a
los pequenos surcos de las superficies para masticar - reduciendo asi el riesgo de que se formen
caries.<p>

<p>

<h4>Es Dificil Aplicar Selladores?</h4>
<p>

No. Probablemente su dentista usara un instrumento especial para aplicar el sellador plastico
sobre sus dientes. La mayoria de las veces es un tratamiento que no duele y dura muchos
meses.<p>

<p>

<h4>Quien Debe Usar Selladores?</h4>
<p>

Los selladores dan los mejores resultados para reducir las caries en ninos con dientes
permanentes recientement formados. Tambien son utiles en reducir la formacion de deterioro
de los dientes en adultos. Una aplicacion de selladores es una medida preventiva para mantener
su dentadura sana. Es una manera eficaz de reducir la necesidad de empastes y de tratamientos
mas caros que podrian ser necesarios para reparar los danos producidos por las caries, y por lo
tanto, los selladores le pueden ahorrar dinero.<p>

<p>

<h4>Preguntele a su dentista de la ADC si los selladores constituyen un
tratamiento adeuado para usted y sus ninos.</h4>

<h2>Selecting A Health Insurance Plan</h2>
<hr>
<p>

<i>by Kelley Lanahan, Health Insurance Counselor<br>
Washington Hospital</i> <br>
<br>
In this era of managed care, buying a health insurance policy should be given the same<br>
attention and research that you might take when buying a car or a home.  Will you be getting<br>
what you need?  How do you know what you need?  Who do I ask about my health insurance?<br>
<br>
For the lay person, becoming an informed consumer in the health insurance industry is not an<br>
easy task.  Most individuals receive their health insurance benefits from their employer. <br>
Choices tend to be limited and hard to change.  It is therefore vitally important that consumers<br>

know what they are getting before they need to use it.<br>
<br>
There are some basic steps that any health insurance consumer should take before signing up<br>
with a plan and above all, it is important that consumers take the time and energy to read<br>
everything available about their health plan - from the Summary of Benefits to Provider<br>
Listing.  Knowing a health plan inside and out will make for fewer misunderstandings and<br>
disappointments with the type of health care an individual can receive.<br><P>
<font size="+2">"Know what they are buying before they use it."</font><br><P>

<b>Step One: Self Evaluation</b><br>
<br>
What issues in your lifestyle might affect your health?  Are you fairly healthy?  Will you have<br>
dependents?  Basic questions like these will help form a rough structure of what types of<br>
health needs an individual might have.  <br>
<br>
<B>Step Two: What Services Are Needed?</B><br>
<br>
Once the self evaluation process is completed, decide what types of services might be needed. <br>
For example, for families with children, having the availability of pediatric specialists could<br>
be considered important.  Pay particularly close attention to areas of coverage that concern<br>
you most.  These are areas that may vary considerably from one plan to another.<br>
<br>
<B>Step Three: Who Can I Go To?</B><br>
<br>
Consumers are often confused by insurance terms such as "PPO" and "provider lists".  Are<br>
you limited to the doctors on the insurance company's list?  Can you choose outside the list? <br>
Are there additional "out of plan" costs?<br>
<br>
Access to these providers is another important issue that should be researched and understood. <br>
If you want to see a specialist, will you have to have a referral from a primary provider? <br>
Does the practitioner offer convenient office hours?  How long does it take to schedule an<br>
appointment?  How far is the doctor from where you live or work?<br>
<br>
<B>Step Four: Reputation</B><br>
<br>
Consumers should always review the performance of any insurance plan they consider buying. <br>
There are many organizations that rate insurance companies and their performance.  Just as<br>
with any other major purchase, consumers must "shop around" for the best value for their<br>
dollar.<br>
<br>
Of equal importance is word-of-mouth referrals.  Was the practitioner recommended by<br>
someone whose opinion you trust?  Did the office personnel do a good job when helping your<br>
family member sort out a billing issue?  It is important to remember that just as each<br>
individual's health needs are different are their perceptions of just exactly what is quality<br>
service.<br>
<br>
<b>Step Five: Cost</B><br>
<p>

When considering costs, it is important to look at what the total estimated cost will be.  Tally<br>
the total expected costs of co-payments, premiums, estimated share-of-cost payments and<br>
deductibles to arrive at a reasonable cost estimate per year.  Individuals should remember that<br>
most PPO and indemnity plans also have a maximum out-of-pocket cost that when met, will<br>
allow the individual one hundred percent coverage for all future expenses for that year of<br>
coverage.<br>
<br>
Also of importance to review what the maximum annual and lifetime coverages are.  While a<br>
maximum lifetime cap seems like a large sum, certain procedures may be expensive to treat<br>
and quickly deplete this amount.<br>
<br>
<b>Finally:</B><br>
<br>
Read everything.  Read the fine print.  Read it again.  Be certain you understand what are<br>
your covered benefits and how you can access those benefits.  Do not wait until you or a<br>
family member have an urgent need to do this.  If you need help understanding your policy,<br>
ask your human resources representative, your broker or the insurance company itself.  Be<br>
positive that you have the best coverage for you and your individual health needs.<br>

<b>TAX CREDIT PROPOSED FOR UNINSURED CHILDREN</b> from Washington Post<p>



<i>Sacramento Bee</i>, A17, 12/08/96<p>


Looking for a more measured way to expand health care to those without it, congressional
Democrats have decided to make medical coverage for uninsured children one of their top
legislative priorities in the new Congress.  The proposals, now being drafted by the Senate,
essentially could create a new class of federal social support.  Some of the initiatives would offer a
tax credit to help families buy their children health care policies, while others would offer a direct
federal subsidy.<p>

<b>MOST FEDS STICK WITH FEE-FOR-SERVICE PLANS</b> by Mike Causey<p>



<i>Sacramento Bee, </i>D2, 12/08/96<p>


Most federal workers and nearly all retirees are in fee-for-service health plans, even though they
have higher premiums and higher out-of-pocket costs than most health maintenance
organizations.  Unlike managed-care HMOs, fee-for-service plans offer greater choices of doctors
and hospitals and greater patient control.  Fee-for-service plans are good nationwide.  HMOs limit
out-of-area coverage to emergencies (such as heart attacks) or accidents.<p>

When doctors make their rounds at Kaiser hospitals, it's not the usual group of clinic physicians
checking up on their patients.  Instead, they're members of Kaiser's own hospital staff -- and
they're in the forefront of a national trend aimed at limiting the role of primary care doctors in
hospitals.  Two of the area's largest physician groups -- Kaiser Foundation and Med-Clinic --
have been moving over in stages to this system as other medical groups and hospitals across the
country do so as well.<p>

London doctors fear they may have encountered a new "superbug" -- a bacterium that not only

<b>SUPREME COURT TO RULE ON INTERNET FREE-SPEECH CASE</b> by Joan Biskupic<p>

Setting the stage for a landmark ruling on free speech and the Internet, the Supreme Court
announced Friday that it would decide the constitutionality of a new federal law that restricts
indecent materials on the computer network that connects millions of people around the globe. 
The court will consider reviving the Communications Decency Act, which passed Congress in
March but was ruled unconstitutional almost immediately on First Amendment grounds.<p>

<b>POWERFUL MEDICATIONS FOR CHOLESTEROL POSE A PARADOX FOR HMOS</b>
by Ron Winslow<p>

<i>Wall Street Journal, </i>A1, 12/06/96<p>

<p>

In recent weeks, Merck &amp; Co. and Bristol-Meyers Squibb Corp. (the two leading statin makers),
and Warner-Lambert Co. and Pfizer Inc. (which are awaiting regulatory approval to co-market a
new entry) have aggressively framed a heated debate with saturation-marketing campaigns.  One
new ad shows children's homemade cards for "Dad" and says: "You'd Give Your Life for Them. 
But That's Not What They Want.  They Just Want You to Stay Healthy."  The kicker:
"Pravochol From Bristol-Meyers Squibb . . . Proven to Help Prevent a <i>First</i> Heart Attack."  The
companies thus are bypassing doctors and health-maintenance organizations -- their usual
marketing channels -- to appeal directly to millions of consumers.  Sales, and profits, are surging.<p>

<b>CPI CHANGE WOULD AFFECT EVERYONE</b> by Kathy Kristof<p>

<p>

<i>Los Angeles Times</i>, D1, 12/06/96<p>

<p>

The consumer price index -- a pivotal gauge of inflation in America -- is likely to undergo
substantial technical revisions as the result of a detailed new study concluding that the index
consistently overstates the true rate of inflation.  If the index is changed as the report
recommends, there would be a dramatic effect on virtually every American, working or retired. 
As it pertains to health care, doctors and hospitals would experience income losses because
Medicare, the national health insurance system for the elderly, bases changes in medical
reimbursement rates on CPI changes.<p>

<b>LARGE CLAIMS IN GROUP MEDICAL INSURANCE REVEAL SOME SURPRISES</b><p>

<p>

More men than women are high-cost claimants, despite the fact that women spend more dollars
on health care than men do until about age 50, says a report by the Society of Actuaries,
Schaumbur, Ill.  The study, which defines large claims as those of $25,000 and higher, examined
171,000 claims paid by insurers from 1991 and 1992 that totaled $10 billion.  The society hopes
the data will help shape public policy on health care.<p>

<b>HEART MEDICATION COULD SAVE LIVES FOLLOWING SURGERY</b> by Ron
Winslow<p>

<p>

<i>Wall Street Journal, </i>B6, 12/05/96<p>

<p>

Aggressive use of an inexpensive blood pressure medicine could save the lives of thousands of
patients whose heart problems put them at high risk of death after surgery, a new study suggests. 
Some three million patients with heart disease undergo surgery for other reasons in the U.S. each
year and many of them suffer heart attacks in the weeks following their operations.  Researchers
at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center found that giving patients atenolol, a widely
used drug know as a beta blocker, to slow their heart rate reduced their death rate over two years
by more than 50% compared with patients given a placebo.<p>

Proposed federal regulations banning smoking in workplaces would devastate Nevada's tourism-driven economy, costing the state tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in lost revenue,
according to a study released yesterday.  "If this regulation is enacted, Nevada's economy could

<p>

While trying to set last year's pay for HealthSouth Corp. Chairman Richard Scrushy, one director
fretted that the nearly $7 million in salary and bonus was making him the highest-paid chief in the
state.  Mr. Scrushy doesn't see it as a problem.  "I'd like to be the highest-paid CEO in the
world," he says.  His business strategy is fairly simple, but with a twist.  In a health-care climate
where low cost is king, HealthSouth has established a chain of rehabilitation and surgery centers,
mostly outpatient, that can perform a wide array of procedures more cheaply than hospitals can. 
HealthSouth is the first health-care company to own facilities in all 50 states.<p>

<b>WHO TO TRUST: DRUG COMPANIES OR YOUR DOCTOR?</b> By Philip Alper<p>

<p>

<i>Wall Street Journal</i>, A18, 12/04/96<p>

<p>

In the past, new drugs were introduced into physician armamentariums in a gradual way.  Doctors
read the literature, attended conferences, were "detailed," and checked with colleagues.  Some
used the new drug sooner than others, but rare complications often became known even before
many doctors had introduced it into their own practices.  All this has changed with the rapid pace
of new-drug introductions and their accompanying market blitzes.  The aim is to create consumer
demand even before the doctor would be willing to use the drug spontaneously.<p>

The growth in Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, elderly and disabled, has
slowed from recent double-digit levels and should average 7.4 percent through 2002, a study
sponsored by the Kaiser Commission on the Future of Medicaid said yesterday.  It predicts that
slower enrollment, slower growth per  beneficiary and reform in Medicaid payments to some
hospitals will reduce expected program growth.<p>

<p>

For the price of a phone call, people in Boston can now learn once-secret details about their
doctors, like how much money they have paid to settle malpractice suits or which hospitals have
restricted their privileges out of competency concerns.  In California, it is literally illegal for the
government to divulge this information to the public.  The same is true in every other state --
except for Massachusetts.  An extraordinary political event -- doctors lobbying legislators to
release more, not less, sensitive information about themselves -- has made this state an experiment
in openness that is being closely watched in California.<p>

<b>ERGONOMIC RULE WOULD BE PAIN WITH NO GAIN</b> by Shirley Knight<p>

<p>

Would you buy an expensive medicine just because the guy down the street said it was sure to
make you feel better?  Probably not.  But California is about to get a very expensive prescription,
with about the same assurance of results.  Physicians who treat injuries such as carpel tunnel
syndrome say we don't know what causes them or how to prevent them.  So we have a
"prescription," courtesy of professional bureaucrats, for a condition that medical professionals still
don't understand.  And when I say this prescription is expensive, I mean billion of dollars to
implement it.<p>

The Food and Drug Administration asked a federal court in Greensboro to turn down a tobacco

Tobacco companies being sued by the state of Minnesota won't get state records about gambling
and its addictive qualities, according to a state court ruling last week.  Judge Kenneth Fitzpatrick,
in a decision late Friday, said the companies' current request is too broad.  He also denied a
tobacco company request to set the trial date for September 1998 and instead chose the state's
request for Jan. 19, 1998.<p>

<b>SHOULD WE GET OUR MONEY BACK IF DOCTORS FAIL?</b> by Stephen Cohen<p>

<p>

There's a new twist in the baby-making business, and it comes with a money-back guarantee.  In a
move that has some doctors up in arms, fertility clinics in Minnesota and California are offering to
guarantee that their patients will have babies -- or they'll get their money back.  It's an
unconventional concept, to say the least, and it highlights a growing trend in which the health-care
marketplace is beginning to resemble a one-day sale at Macy's.  In this case, fertility clinics are
offering substantial refunds to patients who do not get pregnant or who fail to maintain their
pregnancy for at least 3 to 6 months.<p>

Your medical records, the private history of your physical health, may be yours by right but not by
law.  "Only 28 states currently have laws granting people the right to see their medical records.  A
lot of states are silent on this," says Kathleen Frawley, vice president of the American Health

Investors have clobbered the shares of health-care information-service companies in recent
months because of big earnings disappointments in the September quarter.  But while Wall Street
analysts identify the factors  leading to these shortfalls as company-specific, they also say that the
sector's extremely rapid growth and high valuations help explain why the letdowns have been so

<p>

When you join a managed health-care plan, you can forget all about doctor's bills, insurance
forms and costly deductibles, right?  Wrong, at least for the growing number of people choosing
so-called point-of-service plans during the annual fall benefit-enrollment period at employers
across the country.  Many people like these plans, because they offer the savings of managed care
and the freedom of traditional insurance.  But because they're really two plans in one, it's
important that you and your insurer agree on which course you have taken.<p>

Republicans and Democrats both played exaggeration politics with Medicare during the
presidential campaign.  With the election over, both sides are talking cooperation.  But there's a
lack of any clear sense of how to proceed.  Even setting up a bipartisan commission to study ways
to put the program back on the path to solvency, which once seemed the ideal solution since it
was backed both Presidents Clinton and Bob Dole, is losing appeal.<p>

Summary:  As Americans on Medicare and Medicaid switch to managed-care health
coverage, the Clinton
administration is moving to protect doctors from being penalized, as many are now, for
referring
patients to specialists.  Officials of the Health and Human Services Department are completing
regulations to take effect Jan. 1 that designers say will prevent doctors from having to choose
between sending a Medicaid patient to a specialist or possibly losing reimbursement
money.<p>

Summary:  America's crusade against tobacco is losing ground on at least one front.  Cigar
smoking, which
fell steadily during the 1970s and 1980s, has become chic among a new and affluent class of
Americans whose growing taste for the big weed has caused a huge backlog of orders and, in
turn, higher prices.  Many people assume (wrongly) that because cigars are not usually
inhaled,
they're not harmful.  An affluent new generation sees cigars, like fine wines and elegant
clothing,
as a status symbol.<p>

Summary:  Big families, even if everybody is healthy, need to be careful about picking a
health plan.  With multiple mouths to feed, the costs of premiums are
important.  So is what the plan does, and does not, cover.  Insurance
professionals urge shoppers to study the brochures of several plans, then run
them by their doctors to make sure they will get maximum coverage and

Summary:  Have millions of Americans suddenly lost interest in television?  If the numbers
from ratings provider Nielsen Media Research are to be believed, millions of
viewers have stopped watching TV this fall in favor of other pursuits.  As a
result, the six commercial-broadcast networks could wind up owing advertisers
$100 million in airtime in the fourth quarter alone for not delivering the
viewership they had pledged.  While Nielsen and its clients have been sniping at
one another for years over the accuracy of its data, the fight is reaching new

and have such poor credit, that they can't raise money on their own?  The

<p>

Summary:  <u>Casper &amp; Bartin:</u>  As managed care spreads, it is imposing a
new law of the
jungle on health care: survival of the cheapest.  The pressures of cost
containment, the push to find short-term savings at the expense of long-term
investment, put at particular risk a vital segment of health care: university-based
research and teaching hospitals, which can never be the cheapest because they
invest so heavily in the future. <p>

<p>

          <u>Andreopoulos:</u>  The French have a saying, "Plus c'a change, plus
c'est la meme
chose."  The more things change, the more they are the same.  That seems to
be the case with the merger of Stanford and UCSF medical centers, promoted
as a novel idea and necessary for survival in the cutthroat health care market. 
Actually, Stanford and UC first tried to combine their medical schools and
hospitals in 1914.  Both schools faced severe fiscal problems, and a merger
seemed the right thing to do.  Talks went on for months.  They finally broke
down when both sides concluded that they could not legally combine a public
and private institution.<p>

Summary:  President Clinton now needs Medicare "cuts" more than Republican do.  The
President campaigned on a

Medicare; he
knows his numbers don't add up.  With Medicare growing by 9.4% a year, spending $1.824
trillion over the
next seven years, the program will "blow a hole in the deficit," to borrow a famous campaign
