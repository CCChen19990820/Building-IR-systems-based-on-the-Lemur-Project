<h2 align=center>cytomegalovirus (CMV)</h2>

<h3 align=center>a Simple Facts Sheet from <A HREF="../index.html">The Network</A></h3>

<h5 align=center>For more information about clinical trials of treatments for CMV currently enrolling, as well as for other opportunistic infections, see the clinical trials page <A HREF="../trials/ois.html">Drugs for treating opportunistic infections</A>.</h5>

<HR size=3 width=50% align=center noshade>

<p>CMV stands for cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus is a member of the herpesvirus family. Viruses have been around for thousands of years and there are many kinds of viruses. A virus can't live on its own or spread on its own, but needs human cells to live and grow. Most people are infected with some kind of virus, but the immune system usually keeps them from causing active disease.</p>

<p>When the immune system is not working well, a virus like CMV can cause illness. T4 cell counts are one way to measure how well the immune system is working in people with HIV. The risk of developing illness due to CMV is greatest when theT4 cell count is less than 100.</p>

<p>The most common illness caused by CMV in people with AIDS is retinitis. CMV retinitis is an infection of the eye that can lead to blindness. Other forms of CMV disease are colitis (CMV in the intestine), esophagitis (in the mouth or throat), myelitis (spine), and sometimes encephalopathy (brain), and pneumonitis (in the lungs). Left untreated, CMV can spread throughout the body, infecting one or more organs at once and resulting in a great variety of symptoms.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b><br>
The signs of CMV retinitis are vision problems, such as moving black spots known as "floaters," or blind spots. These indicate an inflammation of the retina of the eye. A doctor that specializes in eye problems, called an ophthalmologist, can check for CMV by doing a simple eye examination. If you have a low T4 cell count, it's important to get regular eye exams to check for early signs of CMV retinitis.</p>

<p>The main symptom of CMV colitis is diarrhea. CMV colitis is diagnosed by biopsy, which means taking a small piece of tissue from the intestine and testing it for CMV in the laboratory. CMV esophagitis can make swallowing painful and difficult. A biopsy taken from the throat can diagnose CMV esophagitis. CMV myelitis can cause numbness at the base of the spine, which can spread to the legs and cause difficulty walking. A small sample of spinal fluid can be tested to diagnose CMV myelitis. Encephalitis and pneumonia are only rarely caused by CMV. CMV encephalitis causes symptoms similar to other brain infections such as personality changes, difficulty concentrating and headaches. CMV encephalitis can only be diagnosed for certain by biopsy, requiring surgery. CMV pneumonia can cause shortness of breath and dry cough, but it is extremely unusual for CMV to be the main cause of pneumonia in people with AIDS.</p>

<P><b>Treatments</b><br>
There are three drugs approved for the treatment of CMV retinitis, <a href="../access/drugs/ganc.html">ganciclovir</a>, <a href="../access/drugs/fosc.html">foscarnet</a> and <a href="cido.html">cidofovir</a>. Ganciclovir and foscarnet are also commonly used to treat CMV in other parts of the body. Ganciclovir, foscarnet and cidofovir have been shown to slow down the progression of CMV, although they cannot cure the illness. Until recently, all anti-CMV drugs had to be given by intravenous infusion, which means into a vein. With ganciclovir and foscarnet, intravenous treatment requires having a permanent catheter placed in the chest for daily infusions. The Network has information on the different types of catheters used for these CMV treatments. Cidofovir does not require a catheter, because it only requires infusions every other week.</p>

<p>Ganciclovir is now available in two other formulations. A <a href="cytovene.html">pill form</a> can sometimes be used after receiving two weeks of intravenous therapy, called induction therapy. Induction therapy is used to bring the CMV retinitis under control. The pill form of ganciclovir can then be taken daily for maintenance therapy. A device that releases ganciclovir directly into the eye is approved for the treatment of CMV retinitis. This device is called <a href="implants.html">Vitrasert</a>. Treatment with Vitrasert is localized, meaning it only treats the eye and can't be used for treating CMV in other parts of the body.</p>

<p>Other anti-CMV treatments are in <a href="../trials/cmvret.html">clinical trials</a>.</p>

<p><i>The side effects of ganciclovir can be neutropenia (a low number of white blood cells called neutrophils), nausea, vomiting, and lowered levels of a hormone called testosterone. Foscarnet can cause kidney problems due to dehydration and sodium depletion which can slow down the passage of fluid through the kidneys and cause decreased function and sometimes failure. Side effects from foscarnet should be watched for in the third week of treatment. Cidofovir can cause kidney problems and has to be given with a drug called probenicid to reduce the risk of kidney failure.</i></p>

<A NAME="cmvprev"><H3>Prevention of Exposure</H3></A>

(1) HIV-infected persons who belong to risk groups with relatively low rates of 
seropositivity for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and who anticipate possible exposure to 
CMV (e.g., through blood transfusion or employment in a child-care facility) 
should be tested for antibody to CMV (BIII). These groups include patients who 
have not had male homosexual contact and those who are not injection drug 
users.<P>

(2) HIV-infected adolescents and adults should be advised that CMV is shed in 
semen, cervical secretions, and saliva and that latex condoms must always be 
used during sexual contact to reduce the risk of exposure to this virus and to other 
sexually transmitted pathogens (AII).<P>

(3) HIV-infected adults and adolescents who are child-care providers or parents of 
children in child-care facilities should be informed that they--like all children at 
these facilities--are at increased risk of acquiring CMV infection (BI). Parents and 
other caretakers of HIV-infected children should be advised of the increased risk 
to children at these centers (BIII). The risk of acquiring CMV infection can be 
diminished by good hygienic practices, such as hand washing (AII).<P>

(4) HIV-exposed infants and HIV-infected children, adolescents, and adults who 
are seronegative for CMV and require blood transfusion should receive only CMV 
antibody-negative or leukocyte-reduced cellular blood products in nonemergency 
situations <A HREF="cmv.html#15">(15)</A> (BIII).<P>

<A NAME="cmvdis"><H3>Prevention of Disease</H3></A>

(5) Data on the efficacy and safety of oral ganciclovir have not yet been 
adequately reviewed; thus no recommendation concerning this drug can be made 
at this time. Acyclovir is not effective in preventing CMV disease (EII). Since no 
chemoprophylactic agent is currently available, the most important method for 
preventing severe CMV disease is recognition of the early manifestations of the 
disease. Early recognition of CMV retinitis is most likely when the patient has 
been educated on this topic and undergoes regular funduscopic examinations 
performed by a health care provider (CIII). Patients should be made aware of the 
significance of increased "floaters" in the eye and should be advised to assess 
their visual acuity regularly by simple techniques such as reading newsprint (BIII).<P>

<A NAME="cmvrec"><H3>Prevention of Recurrence</H3></A>

(6) CMV disease is not cured with courses of the currently available antiviral 
agents ganciclovir and foscarnet. Chronic suppressive or maintenance therapy is 
indicated. The presently approved regimens include parenteral or oral ganciclovir 
or parenteral foscarnet (AI). In spite of maintenance therapy, recurrences develop 
routinely and require reinstitution of high-dose induction therapy.<P>

<A NAME="cmvped"><H3>Pediatric Note</H3></A>

(7) The recommendations for the prevention of CMV disease and of its recurrence 
apply to children as well as to adolescents and adults. However, oral ganciclovir 
has not been studied in children.<P>

<HR size=3 width=50% align=center noshade>
<font size=2>
<P>Thrush is the most common and least serious fungal infection in HIV+ people. It can affect the mouth, throat, skin, stomach, and vagina. In a person with a weakened immune system, thrush can cause more serious problems. This condition is sometimes called candidiasis, because the germs that cause it are called candidiasis albicans. Other types of fungus have been discovered, however, so it may be necessary to try different drugs besides the ones that are used now. Some medications, such as antibiotics, steroids, and cancer medications, may cause thrush. </P>
<P><B>Oral Thrush</B> (in the mouth) looks like white or red patches. It can cause sore throat, pain when swallowing, and nausea. It can also take away your appetite, make eating painful, and make food taste different. Treatments for oral thrush include mouthwash and tablets called troches. Some people try baking soda or hydrogen peroxide mixed with water to rinse the mouth. If the thrush is advanced, this isn't likely to work. Treatments for thrush include clotrimazole, fluconazole, and ketoconazole. These drugs have different brand names. These drugs sometimes lose their effects when taken for long periods of time, but new ways to use these drugs, and new drugs are being studied. </P>
<P><B>Vaginal candidiasis</B> is a common yeast infection of the vagina.  A yeast infection may be the first sign that a woman is HIV+.  Symptoms include severe itching, burning, and a thick discharge, often white in color. It is possible that an infection such as unrecognized TB may be causing a vaginal yeast infection. Nystatin tablets are used for treatment. Clotrimazole ointment is another treatment, which is sold over-the-counter as Gyne-Lotrimin, Lotrimin, or Mycelex. Studies have shown that HIV-negative women may only have to take the drug DiFlucan one time to treat this condition. Always consult with your doctor before beginning treatment.</P>
<p><B>Cryptococcal meningitis</B> is a very serious fungal infection. It is caused by a fungus found mainly in dirt and bird droppings. Meningitis means swelling of the meninges. The meninges cover the brain and spinal cord. </P>
<P>Symptoms can be hard to recognize as being caused by cryptococcal infection. Watch for fever, vomiting, headache, nausea, fatigue, loss of appetite, and a general feeling of not being well. Other symptoms are a stiff neck and, infrequently, seizures. Pneumonia can be an early sign of infection. Tell your doctor about symptoms right away. </P>
<P>A common treatment for this condition is amphotericin B, which must be given by intravenous injection. A new treatment that can be given by pill, in some cases, or by intravenous injection is Flucanozole, or Diflucan. Most people prefer this treatment because it causes few side effects. </P>
<P><b>Histoplasmosis</B> can be a life-threatening fungal infection and commonly occurs in the Southwestern U.S. In the past, histoplasmosis was treatable only with intravenous amphotericin. Itraconazole is used today, although it may not be effective for treating histoplasmosis involving the central nervous system and  brain, since it does not penetrate well into the cerebrospinal fluid, which is the fluid that surrounds the spinal cord and brain.</P>
<P><B>Blastomycosis</B> is a fungal infection involving the lungs and occasionally spreading to the skin. The fungus is of unknown natural source. Most reported cases are from the southeastern states and the Mississippi River valley, and occur in men ages 20 to 40. When infection occurs in the lungs, a dry hacking or productive cough, chest pain, fever, chills, drenching sweats, and shortness of breath are initial symptoms. If untreated, the disease slowly causes death. Amphotericin B is highly effective. Improvement begins within a week, with rapid disappearance of organisms. </P>

<P><i>Treatments for thrush come in different forms like mouthwash 
or lozenges.  Studies are being conducted to see if HIV+ individuals can take medicines to prevent thrush. Some people try different home remedies. Using large amounts of garlic, and avoiding foods which contain sugar, yeast or dairy products are two proposed, although unproven ways to stop the growth of thrush.</I></P>

<A NAME="candis"><H3>Prevention of Disease</H3></A>

(2) Although data from a prospective controlled trial indicate that fluconazole can 
reduce the risk of mucosal (oropharyngeal, esophageal, and vaginal) candidiasis 
in patients with advanced HIV disease, routine primary prophylaxis is not 
recommended because of the effectiveness of therapy for acute disease, the low 
mortality associated with mucosal candidiasis, the potential for resistant Candida 
organisms to develop, the possibility of drug interactions, and the cost of 
prophylaxis (DII).<P> 

<A NAME="canrec"><H3>Prevention of Recurrence</H3></A>

(3) Many experts do not recommend chronic prophylaxis of recurrent 
oropharyngeal or vulvovaginal candidiasis for the same reasons that they do not 
recommend primary prophylaxis. However, if recurrences are frequent or severe, 
intermittent or chronic administration of topical nystatin, topical clotrimazole, or an 
oral azole (ketoconazole, fluconazole, or itraconazole) may be considered (BI). 
Other factors that influence choices about such therapy include the impact of the 
recurrences on the patient's well-being and quality of life, the need for prophylaxis 
for other fungal infections, cost, toxicities, and drug interactions.<P>

(4) Adults or adolescents with a history of documented esophageal candidiasis, 
particularly multiple episodes, should be considered candidates for chronic 
suppressive therapy with fluconazole (BI). <P>

<A NAME="canped"><H3>Pediatric Notes</H3></A>

(5) Primary prophylaxis of candidiasis in HIV-infected infants is not indicated (DII).<P>

<h2 align=center>HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)</h2>

<h3 align=center>a Simple Facts Sheet from <A HREF="../index.html">The Network</A></h3>

<blockquote>
<h5 align=center>For information about clinical trials for the treatmen of HIV currently enrolling, see the clinical trials page <A HREF="../trials/hiv.html">Drugs for treating HIV</A>.</h5>

<HR size=3 width=50% align=center noshade>

<font size=2><p>Viruses have been around for thousands of years and there are many kinds of viruses. Some viruses cause colds and illnesses like the flu, others can cause more serious illnesses like AIDS, hepatitis, or herpes. A virus can't live on its own or spread on its own. It needs human cells to live and grow. Most people are infected with some kind of virus. Usually, your immune system is able to keep viruses under control.</p>

<p>HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. The HIV virus infects cells of the immune system. Your immune system is what protects you from infections and disease. HIV uses cells of your immune system to grow. When HIV has used one of these cells to grow, the cell can no longer do its job, leaving your body without a part of its immune system. Pieces of the HIV virus go all over the body. Even pieces of virus can cause damage.</p>

<p>The blood test to find out if you're HIV-positive (HIV+) tells the doctor if your body is making antibodies. Antibodies are made by your immune system to fight infection. If your body is making antibodies to HIV, this means you've been infected with the virus. Once you've tested positive for the antibodies to HIV, you will always test positive.</p>

<p>Each day, HIV creates billions of new HIV viruses in the body. The body's natural reaction to infection is to produce a strong response. In response to HIV infection, the immune system of someone who is HIV+ produces billions of cells to fight HIV every day as well.</p>

<p>But HIV takes every chance it gets to produce faster than the body can attack it. Eventually, in most people, the virus can get the upper hand unless treatments stop it or slow it down. At this point, we know there are several treatments that can slow the infection down. We also know that a handful of people are able to fight off the virus for a long time. Doctors agree that HIV infection needs to be treated so that you don't get sick, or sicker.</p>

<p>Get regular blood tests to watch your immune system. Blood tests also show other important things like how well your liver is doing and whether or not you have <a href="../oisgloss.html#anemia">anemia</a>. Most people only go to the doctor when they're already ill. People with HIV can't wait until they're sick. Go over your blood test results with your doctor. You have the right as a patient to ask questions and have your test results explained to you in language you understand.</p>

<p>Some questions you might want to ask are: 

<ul>
<li>How is my immune system now? 
<li>Do I need any treatments right now? 
<li>What are the usual treatments used for where I am now? 
<li>Do I need to get any vaccines?
</ul>

<p>With HIV infection, your immune system may slowly get weaker or may become overactive. Either way, your immune system is out of balance. HIV starts a process that can be very hard to stop once it starts. With a weakened immune system, you can more easily get infections and cancers. You may not see any signs of these at first. Doctors can use blood tests to see how your immune system is doing. These tests can tell you and your doctor if there are treatments you need to help keep you from getting infections that can make you very sick.</p>

<p>You don't have AIDS as soon as you're infected with HIV. The disease process takes a while, around 10 years on average. The process goes from being HIV+ without any symptoms or signs of disease to being HIV+ with symptoms to having AIDS. AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Immune deficiency means that your immune system has been damaged by HIV. A damaged immune system can't protect you from infections as well as a healthy immune system.</p>

<p>Many doctors use your T4 cells to measure the current status of your immune system. T4 cells are cells that help control infection. The normal range for T4 cells is usually 500-1600 cells. For many people whose T4 cells fall below 200, the risk increases of getting certain infections. If you have less than 200 T4 cells, talk to your doctor about preventive treatment. Preventive treatments are also called prophylaxis. These treatments help keep you from getting infections as your T4 cell count drops. Tests can show which infections you've been exposed to. Your health care provider can tell you about treatments. Be sure to find out what the side effects and benefits are for each treatment. Preventive treatments can prevent or slow down illness so you stay healthy longer.</p>

<p><i>HIV is a kind of virus called a retrovirus. HIV uses the cells in your body to make more virus. Drugs that fight HIV are known as antiretrovirals. The most well known antiretroviral drugs are nucleoside analogues. These include the drugs <a href="../access/drugs/zido.html">AZT</a>, <a href="../access/drugs/dida.html">ddI,</a> <a href="../access/drugs/zalc.html">ddC</a>, <a href="../access/drugs/stav.html">d4T</a> and <a href="three.html">3TC</a>. Another class of drugs used to treat AIDS and HIV disease are called <a href="protease.html">protease inhibitors</a>. <a href="saquin.html">Saquinavir</a> (trade name Invirase) is the first protease inhibitor to be approved for the treatment of HIV infection. Call The Network for a fact sheet about any of these treatments.</i></p></font>

<h2 align=center>KS (Kaposi's sarcoma)</h2>

<h3 align=center>a Simple Facts Sheet from <A HREF="../index.html">The Network</A></h3>

<blockquote><h5 align=center>For more information about clinical trials of treatments for KS currently enrolling see the clinical trials page <A HREF="../trials/ks.html">Drugs for treating Kaposi's sarcoma</A>.</h5>

<HR width=50% size=3 align=center noshade>

<font size=2><p>Kaposi's sarcoma, or KS, is a type of cancer that men with AIDS may develop. It is rarely seen in women. Although KS mainly affects the skin, the mouth, and the lymph nodes, it can also involve the bowels and lungs. If it becomes severe, it may lead to swelling or breakdown of the skin. KS growths, called lesions or tumors, can show up in a wide range of colors, from pink to red-violet to brown to blue. Recent studies have shown that KS may be caused by a kind of sexually transmitted herpesvirus that has been called KSHV, or HHV 8.</p>

<p>Because KS can appear anywhere on the body, and may look like other skin lesions, a biopsy of the skin is generally required to confirm a diagnosis. A biopsy is when a small piece of tissue is removed for examination and is usually painless. When KS is suspected to involve the lungs, a test called a bronchoscopy is usually performed. KS involving the gastrointestinal tract is best diagnosed by a test called an endoscopy.</p>
 
<p>Skin lesions are generally flat, painless and do not itch or drain. They can look similar to a bruise, but do not blanche, or turn white, when pressure is applied to them like a bruise does. As the lesions progress, they may become elevated, patch-like, and flow together.</p> 

<p>Early on, these growths may be very small and innocent looking, causing no problems except for concern about their appearance. The pace of the disease varies from person to person. In some, tumor growth is slow with little change from month to month. In others, growth is rapid with new spots occurring almost every week.</p>
 
<p>It's important to bring new spots to the attention of your health care provider. If you have a small number of skin lesions, they do not have to be treated. However, if you prefer having something done about them, they can be treated by having them injected with anti-cancer medicine called vincristine. They can also be treated with x-rays or liquid nitrogen.</p> 

<p>If the KS has spread throughout your system, chemotherapy is necessary. Chemotherapies used to treat KS include combinations of anti-cancer drugs called vinblastine, bleomycin, vincristine, etoposide, and doxorubicin. If your T4 cell count is over 200, you may be treated with alfa interferon. Some people can tolerate alfa interferon, but others have a bad reaction with flu-like symptoms including chills, headaches, and fatigue.</p>

<p>Newer treatments called liposome drugs are becoming available for the treatment of KS. Liposome drugs are standard chemotherapy drugs used to treat KS that are put inside microscopic bubbles of fat called liposomes. When the drugs are used this way, it is hoped they will have fewer side effects and be more effective. One liposomal drug is called Doxil, and the other is called DaunoXome.</p> 

<p><a href="../news.html#daun">DaunoXome</a> has been approved as a first-line treatment for advanced KS. In a recent study comparing DaunoXome to standard combination chemotherapy, people taking DaunoXome responded better. Doxil is now approved for the treatment of advanced KS in people that have not responded to standard combination chemotherapy. It is also recommended if people can't take standard chemotherapy because of side effects.</p>

<p>Chemotherapy drugs can have many side effects. They can damage your heart, and also affect your bone marrow. Your bone marrow makes white blood cells. When you lose white blood cells, you are more likely to get bacterial infections. There are treatments to help make more white blood cells. If you're getting chemotherapy, your doctor will watch for symptoms that need treatment.</p>

<p>Other experimental drugs are in studies for the treatment of KS, including the anti-herpes drug <a href="../trials/ks.html#foscarnet">foscarnet</a> and some creams for lesions that are just on the skin. If you are interested in finding out more about experimental treatments, call The Network.</p>

<p><i>KS can be treated with radiation, chemotherapy and certain immunomodulators. These treatments often have severe toxic side effects such as suppression of bone marrow activity and white blood cell production. Additional side effects, such as hair loss and nausea, may impact quality of life during treatment. New liposomal therapies seem to have less  of these side effects.</p>

<p>Sequus Pharmaceuticals, the makers of Doxil, have set up a <a href="../access/pa/doxil.html">patient assistance program</a>. Patient assistance programs help people having difficulty paying for a treatment. Call (800) 375-1658 for more information.</i></p></font>

<TITLE>Simple Facts Sheets: MAC</TITLE>

<h2 align=center>MAC (Mycobacterium avium complex)</h2>
<h3 align=center>a Simple Facts Sheet from <A HREF="../index.html">The Network</A></h3>

<blockquote>
<h5 align=center>For more information about clinical trials of treatments for MAC currently enrolling see the clinical trials page <A HREF="../trials/mac.html">Drugs for treating MAC</A>.</h5>

<HR size=3 width=50% align=center noshade>

<p>Mycobacterium avium complex, or MAC, is a serious bacterial infection that HIV+ people can get. MAC is related to tuberculosis. MAC is also sometimes called MAI, which stands for Mycobacterium avium intracellulare.</p>

<p>MAC infection is usually found only in people with under 50 T4 cells. The symptoms of MAC can include weight loss, fevers, chills, night sweats, swollen glands, abdominal pains, diarrhea and overall weakness. MAC usually affects the intestines and inner organs first, causing liver tests to be high. Swelling and inflammation also occur.</p>

<p><font size="-0"><b>Preventing MAC</b></font><br>
 A multi-center trial has shown that <a href="../access/drugs/rifa.html">rifabutin</a>, or Mycobutin, can nearly cut in half the rate at which people develop MAC. The drug is approved for prevention of MAC. Recent information from studies of rifabutin show that the drug may also help people live longer. Taking the drug for MAC prevention reduced the risk of dying by 14&#37; in these studies. The most serious side effects of rifabutin are low white blood-cell counts and elevated liver enzymes. Very few people in trials had to discontinue the drug because of toxicity.</p>

<p><a href="../access/drugs/clar.html">Clarithromycin</a> (Biaxin) is the second drug to be approved for the prevention of MAC. In studies, it reduced the number of MAC infections by 69&#37;, or over two-thirds. In a recent study people taking this drug to prevent MAC lived longer on average than those receiving placebo (a fake or dummy pill used in clinical trials to see if a treatment really works).</p>

<p>A third drug called <a href="../access/drugs/azit.html">azithromycin</a> has now also been approved for preventing MAC. This drug can be taken once a week. A recent study found that azithromycin was better at preventing MAC than rifabutin. Azithromycin has not been directly compared to clarithromycin for preventing MAC.</p>

<p>A recent study comparing rifabutin, clarithromycin and a combination of the two drugs found clarithromycin to be clearly superior to rifabutin for the prevention of MAC.</p>

<P>However, clarithromycin is also thought to be the most effective treatment for MAC. Some doctors are concerned that if a person develops MAC while taking clarithromycin, the MAC infection will be resistant to the effects of the drug. This would make the infection much harder to treat. In studies, half the people that developed MAC while taking clarithromycin turned out to have MAC infections that were resistant to the drug. This might have been due to their having an undetected active MAC infection before starting preventive treatment. It is very important that you are properly tested for both active MAC and tuberculosis (TB) infection before starting any preventive treatment.</p>

<p><font size=+-0"><b>Treating MAC</b></font><br>
The recommendations of the <a href="../phs/mac.html">US Public Health Task Force on MAC</a> are that treatment for disseminated MAC should include at least 2 drugs, one of which should be clarithromycin or azithromycin. Effective treatment should continue for life.</p>

<p>The Task Force also noted that many doctors use <a href="../access/drugs/etha.html">ethambutol</a> as the second drug, and that other second, third or fourth drug(s) include: <a href="../access/drugs/rifa.html">rifabutin</a>, <a href="../access/drugs/rifam.html">rifampin</a>, <a href="../access/drugs/cipr.html">ciprofloxacin</a> and <a href="../access/drugs/amik.html">amikacin</a>. Due to a recent study, <a href="../access/drugs/clof.html">clofazimine</a> (trade name  Lamprene) is no longer recommended as a part of MAC treatment. The study found that poor survival was associated with adding clofazimine to MAC treatment. (See <a href="../news.html#clof">In the News</a>.) The recommendations do not support the use of <a href="../access/drugs/ison.html">isoniazid</a>
(INH) or <a href="../access/drugs/pyra.html">pyrazinamide</a> for MAC therapy.</p>

<p>A recent alert from the National Institutes of Health also notes that the
drug <a href="../access/drugs/clar.html">clarithromycin</a> (Biaxin) should never be used at dose higher than the approved dose of 500 mg twice a day.</p>

<p><font size="-0"><b>Some cautions</b></font><br>
 If you're taking AZT, rifabutin can reduce the amount of AZT in your blood. Lower amounts of AZT would make the AZT less effective against HIV.  Rifabutin also lowers the amount of clarithromycin in the blood.</p>

<p>The anti-fungal drug <a href="../access/drugs/fluc.html">fluconazole</a> (Diflucan) can increase the amount of rifabutin in the blood by up to 80&#37;. Increased levels of drug in the blood may lead to greater risk of side effects.</p>

<center><table width="90%">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#eaeaae"><font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1"><b>Side effects</b> of rifabutin can be kidney and liver damage, bone marrow suppression, rash, fever, gastrointestinal distress, and uveitis (a swelling of the eye). Early warning signs of kidney problems are decreased urination, increased thirst, or light-headedness after you stand up. Uveitis can cause eye pain, light sensitivity, redness and blurred vision. A harmless side effect of rifabutin can be an orange color that appears in the urine and other body fluids, and sometimes on the skin, too. Soft contact lenses can become permanently discolored. Side effects of clarithromycin can be diarrhea, nausea, and abnormal or metallic taste. Clarithromycin may cause severe abdominal pain at high doses. Side effects of azithromycin include mild GI symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea, dizziness, sensitivity to sunlight, and rare cases of hearing loss.</font></td>

<A NAME="macprev"><H3>Prevention of Exposure</H3></A>

(1) Organisms of the M. avium complex (MAC) are common in environmental 
sources such as food and water. Current information does not support specific 
recommendations regarding avoidance of exposure. <P>

<A NAME="macdis"><H3>Prevention of Disease</H3></A>

(2) Prophylaxis with rifabutin should be considered for HIV-infected adults and 
adolescents who have a CD4+ lymphocyte count of less than 75/uL, although 
some experts would wait until the count is less than 50/uL (BII). Disseminated 
MAC disease should be ruled out (by a negative blood culture) before prophylaxis 
is initiated. Because treatment with rifabutin may result in the development of 
resistance to rifampin in individuals with active tuberculosis, the latter condition 
should be excluded before rifabutin prophylaxis is begun. Drug interactions, 
partial efficacy, and cost are among the other issues that should be considered in 
decisions about whether to institute prophylaxis for MAC disease. Data on the 
safety and efficacy of clarithromycin, azithromycin, and combinations of 
clarithromycin or azithromycin with rifabutin have not yet been reviewed 
sufficiently to warrant recommendations concerning these regimens.<P>

(3) Although the detection of MAC organisms in the respiratory or gastrointestinal 
tract may be predictive of the development of disseminated MAC infection, no data 
are available on the efficacy of prophylaxis with rifabutin or other drugs in patients 
with MAC organisms at these sites and a negative blood culture. Therefore, 
routine screening of respiratory or gastrointestinal specimens for MAC cannot be 
recommended at this time (DIII). <P>

<A NAME="macrec"><H3>Prevention of Recurrence</H3></A>

Receive full therapeutic doses for life (BIII). The use of a macrolide, usually clarithromycin, is generally recommended in conjunction with at least one other drug, such as ethambutol, clofazimine, ciprofloxacin, or rifabutin. <P>

<p><b>Note</b>: a recent study has called into question the role of clofazimine in treating MAC. See <a href="../news.html#clof">In The News</a>. <font size=-1>(7/28/96)</font></p>

<A NAME="macped"><H3>Pediatric Note</H3></A>

(5) HIV-infected children less than 12 years of age also develop disseminated 
MAC infections. Prophylaxis should be considered similar to that recommended 
for adults and adolescents (BI). For children 6-12 years of age, a CD4+ 
lymphocyte count of less than 75/uL is a reasonable threshold for the initiation of 
chemoprophylaxis. Some adjustment for age is necessary in the interpretation of 
CD4+ lymphocyte counts of children less than 6 years of age (12). No pediatric 
formulation of rifabutin is currently available, but a dosage of 5 mg/kg has been 
used in pharmacokinetic studies.<P>

<A NAME="macpreg"><H3>Note Regarding Pregnancy</H3></A>

(6) Information is insufficient for recommendations concerning the use of rifabutin 
or clarithromycin during pregnancy.<P>

<blockquote>
<h5 align=center>For more information about clinical trials for preventing PCP currently enrolling, see the clinical trials page <A HREF="../trials/pcprev.html">Drugs for preventing PCP</A>.</h5>

<HR size=3 width=50% align=center noshade>

<HR size=3 width=50% align=center noshade>

<font size=-1><p>PCP stands for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. This serious infection mainly affects the lungs, but it can also affect other organs, including the skin. Without preventive medication, over 80% of people with HIV will likely get PCP. Early signs of PCP are trouble breathing, having a fever, and dry coughing. PCP can usually be treated with one of several different medications, including <a href="../access/drugs/tmp.html">TMP/SMX</a> (trade name Bactrim or Septra), <a href="../access/drugs/pent.html">pentamidine</a>, trimetrexate and <a href="../access/drugs/atov.html">atovaquone</a> (trade name Mepron). However, it's much better to avoid getting PCP in the first place.</p>

<p>Studies have shown that PCP can be prevented. People with under 200 T4 cells are most at risk to get PCP, but other HIV+ people can get it as well. Anyone who is HIV+ should talk to their doctor about preventing PCP.</p>

<p>There are several different medications to prevent PCP. The main one is called Bactrim or Septra (TMP/SMX). Studies so far show that this is the most effective drug for preventing PCP. It also helps prevent another common infection called toxoplasmosis.</p>

<p>Not everyone can take TMP/SMX because of side effects. Around 50% of people have allergies to TMP/SMX because it contains a substance called sulfa. Signs of an allergic reaction can be skin rashes and fever. If you are starting on TMP/SMX and experience any symptoms, report them to your healthcare provider immediately - in rare cases they can be a sign of a dangerous allergy called Stevens-Johnson  Syndrome.</p>

<p>Recent studies have found that many people can take TMP/SMX even if they have an allergy at first. A procedure called desensitization, where you build up the dose slowly, can help the body get used to the drug. The Network has several commonly used desensitization protocols in our treatment library, call if you need a copy. </p>

<p>When TMP/SMX was first used, the standard dose was one double-strength tablet every day. Several recent studies have found that one double-strength tablet taken three times a week is just as effective, and causes less side effects. Most doctors now use this less frequent dose when they prescribe TMP/SMX.</p>

<p>If you can't take Bactrim or Septra, you may be able to take <a href="../access/drugs/daps.html">dapsone</a>. Dapsone is an antibiotic similar to TMP/SMX, but it has less sulfa in it. Although it has not been studied as much as TMP/SMX, early results show that it is probably just as effective in preventing PCP. Dapsone may also be effective at preventing toxoplasmosis. Until this is known for certain, some doctors prescribe a drug called <a href="../access/drugs/pyri.html">pyrimethamine</a> along with dapsone if a person is at risk for toxoplasmosis.</p>

<p>Another preventive medication for PCP is aerosolized <a href="../access/drugs/pent.html">pentamidine</a>. Aerosolized pentamidine is a form of drug you breath through a special mask. The procedure takes 30-45 minutes and is done once every four weeks. This drug does not seem quite as effective at preventing PCP as TMP/SMX and dapsone. Also, it does not offer any protection against toxoplasmosis.</p>

<p>Newer drugs are under study for the prevention of PCP. Atovaquone (trade name Mepron) is being compared to aerosolized pentamidine in one study. There are also several studies enrolling that are looking at ways to help people take TMP/SMX. Call The Network for more information about these studies.</p>

<p><i><b>Side effects</b>: <br>TMP/SMX can, more rarely, have side effects other than allergic reaction. These can include minor fevers, nausea, low white blood cells, low platelets, and liver irritation. Dapsone contains less sulfa, although there is still the risk of allergic reaction similar to TMP/SMX. Dapsone has also been associated with mild nausea, fever, low white and red blood cells and liver problems. Aerosolized pentamidine can cause cough, dry throat, bad taste in the mouth, lung spasms, anxiety, headache and chills.</i></p>

<A NAME="pcpexp"><H3>Prevention of Exposure</H3></A>

(1) Although some authorities recommend that HIV-infected persons at risk for P. 
carinii pneumonia (PCP) not share a hospital room with a patient with PCP, data 
are insufficient to support this recommendation as standard practice (CIII).<P>

<A NAME="pcprev"><H3>Prevention of Disease</H3></A>

(2) Adults and adolescents with HIV infection (including those who are pregnant) 
should receive chemoprophylaxis against PCP if they have a CD4+ lymphocyte 
count of less than 200/gmL (AI), unexplained fever (greater than 100 F) for greater 
than or equal to 2 weeks (AII), or a history of oropharyngeal candidiasis (AII).<P>

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) is the preferred prophylactic agent 
(AI). TMP-SMZ may confer cross-protection against toxoplasmosis (AII) and many 
bacterial infections (AII). For patients with an adverse reaction that is not life-
threatening, treatment with TMP-SMZ should be continued if clinically feasible; for 
those who have discontinued such therapy, its reinstitution should be strongly 
considered (AII). Whether it is best to reintroduce the drug at the original dose or 
at a lower and gradually increasing dose or to try a desensitization regimen is 
unknown.<P>

If TMP-SMZ cannot be tolerated, alternative prophylactic regimens include 
dapsone (AI), dapsone plus pyrimethamine plus leucovorin (AI), and aerosolized 
pentamidine administered by the Respirgard II nebulizer (Marquest, Englewood, 
CO) (AI). Regimens including dapsone plus pyrimethamine are also protective 
against toxoplasmosis (AI) but not against most bacterial infections. Because data 
on their efficacy for PCP prophylaxis are insufficient, the following regimens 
generally cannot be recommended for this purpose: aerosolized pentamidine 
administered by other nebulization devices currently available in the United 
States, intermittently administered parenteral pentamidine, oral 
pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine, oral clindamycin plus primaquine, oral atovaquone, 
and intravenous trimetrexate. However, the use of these agents may be 
considered in unusual situations in which the recommended agents cannot be 
administered (CIII). <P>

<h3><a name="protease">Protease</a> Inhibitors</h3>

<p>The main goals of anti-HIV treatment are keeping the level of HIV as low as possible, preventing damage to the immune system, and slowing or stopping disease progression. There are now nine anti-HIV drugs approved for prescription which might help to do this. People will need to work with their doctors to decide if they need anti-HIV treatment, and if they do, find combinations of drugs that keep their levels of HIV low or undetectable without causing unwanted side effects. The decision about which combination of anti-HIV drugs may work best for an individual is usually based on several factors. Each of these questions may be part of the decision making process.</p>

<ul>
<li>Which combination has the best chance of reducing the amount of HIV in my body for the longest time?
<li>Which combination will best increase my T4 cell count or keep it stable and hopefully prevent disease progression?
<li>What are my options if this combination stops working?	
<li>What are the possible side effects of the drug combination?
<li>How many pills will I need to take?
<li>What symptoms do I have now?
</ul>

<p><b>Good news and strong warnings</b><br>
At the recent International Conference on AIDS in Vancouver, several studies of three-drug combinations were presented. These studies showed that is possible to reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to such low levels that sensitive tests cannot measure it. In one triple combination study, using AZT and 3TC along with a protease inhibitor called indinavir (Crixivan), most of the people have maintained very low or undetectable levels of HIV for nearly a year. Early evidence suggests that this may prevent disease progression, and give the immune system some chance of recovery - even if the T4 cell count has gotten low. Researchers have also found that when HIV is stopped from reproducing by these drug combinations, it is very unlikely that the virus will develop resistance to the drugs.</p>

<p>However, if a drug combination doesn't stop the virus reproducing effectively, drug resistance can develop. Researchers are issuing stong warnings that people should try and avoid the development of drug resistance.</p>

<p><b>About drug resistance</b><br>
It's important to understand what resistance is, and why it happens. That way, you can try and avoid resistance for as long as possible. Drug resistance is a major concern with protease inhibitors. Resistance to one protease inhibitor might mean that other protease inhibitors will not work.</p>

<p>HIV creates billions of new HIV viruses in the body every day. HIV mainly infects immune system cells called T4 cells, and uses them to produce more HIV. Anti-HIV drugs are designed to block certain parts of the virus. The nucleoside analog anti-HIV drugs (AZT, ddI, ddC, d4T and 3TC) block a part of HIV called the reverse transcriptase enzyme. Protease inhibitors block a part of HIV called the protease enzyme. HIV uses both the reverse transcriptase and protease enzymes to make more HIV.</p>

<p>HIV does not always make perfect copies of itself. There can be lots of small, random changes, or mutations, that occur. Mutations that change the reverse transcriptase or protease enzymes can cause drug resistance. For example, a person may have a few HIV viruses in their body that, by chance, have a mutation in their reverse transcriptase enzyme that stops AZT from blocking it. If that person takes AZT, a lot of the HIV in their body may be stopped from reproducing, because the reverse transcriptase enzyme will be blocked by the drug. But the HIV with the resistant reverse transcriptase keeps reproducing. The new viruses that get made will also be AZT resistant. Eventually, this AZT-resistant HIV will be the only type of HIV in the body, and there will be just as much as there was before the person started taking AZT. The same thing can happen with the HIV protease enzyme and a protease inhibitor drug.</p>

<p><b>Avoiding resistance</b><br>
It is thought to be very important to try and stop HIV from becoming resistant to the effects of protease inhibitors. If the virus becomes resistant to AZT, there are other drugs like it that may still work. But if the virus becomes resistant to one protease inhibitor, it might be resistant to other protease inhibitors. This would greatly limit someone's treatment options.</p>

<p>To try and delay or prevent resistance, it's important to stick to the correct dose and schedule for taking a protease inhibitor. Make sure to find out how the protease inhibitor should be taken, e.g., on an empty or full stomach. Also find out about side effects, and whether there are things you can do to help manage them. You may not want to start a protease inhibitor whose side effects will make it impossible to continue to take. The Network has a <a href="../sf.html">Simple Fact Sheet</a> on each of the approved protease inhibitors. Their potential side effects are described.</p>

<p>Combination therapy also seems to make resistance less of a problem. Due to this fact, researchers recommend that, if possible, protease inhibitors be taken in combination with at least one nucleoside analog anti-HIV drug (AZT, ddI, ddC, d4T or 3TC). Studies indicate that using two other nucleoside anti-HIV drugs with the protease inhibitor provides the strongest anti-HIV effect.</p>

<p><b>Can protease inhibitors slow drug resistance?</b><br>
Drug resistance doesn't happen because HIV is clever and works out how to get around the drug. Resistance mutations happen randomly - with billions of viruses being made in the body every day, there's a good chance that at least one new HIV virus will be drug resistant. The good news is that a strong combination of anti-HIV drugs can greatly reduce the amount of virus in the body. Less HIV means less chance of the random mutations that lead to drug resistance. This is why researchers think that strong anti-HIV drugs like protease inhibitors need to be taken on schedule, and at the right dose. Combinations of anti-HIV drugs are recommended for the same reason.</p>

<p><b>Can protease inhibitors be used alone?</b><br>
For people that cannot tolerate any of the nucleoside analog anti-HIV drugs (AZT, ddI, ddC, d4T and 3TC), using just a protease inhibitor may still be helpful. In studies of indinavir, better anti-HIV effects were seen in combination with AZT and 3TC, but people taking just indinavir did have significantly increased T4 cell counts and reductions in HIV viral load. Also, in a study of ritonavir which showed improved survival for people with less than 100 T4 cells, some people were taking ritonaviras their only anti-HIV drug. Saquinavir, the other protease inhibitor, is not approved for use alone, due to poor absorption.</p>

<p><b>Can protease inhibitors be combined?</b><br>
Unless someone has no other treatment options, it would seem a good idea to wait for more information before combining two protease inhibitors. There have been encouraging, although preliminary results from one study combining ritonavir and saquinavir, although side effects have been reported. A safety study of the combination of saquinavir with indinavir is underway in HIV negative people.</p>

<p>About sixty people in the ritonavir/saquinavir study have been followed for just six weeks. They were divided into two groups. One group is taking 400 mg of saquinavir twice a day, along with 400 mg of ritonavir twice a day. The second groups is taking 400 mg of saquinavir twice a day, along with the normal dose of ritonavir, which is 600 mg twice a day. After six weeks, T4 cell counts are increasing and the amount of HIV in the blood is decreasing in both groups.</p>

<p>Many side effects have been reported. Fifty-two of the sixty people on the study have had numbing sensations known as parasthesias. Diarrhea occured in forty-five people, fatigue in twenty-eight, nausea in twenty-four and flushing in twenty-four. Most of these side effects were throught to be caused by ritonavir. Abnormal blood tests have been seen in fourteen of the study participants, but none were serious.</p>

<p><b>Update on approved protease Inhibitors</b><br>
There are now three different protease inhibitors approved for prescription in the US. <a href="../simple/saquin.html">Saquinavir</a> (trade name Invirase), <a href="../simple/riton.html">ritonavir</a> (Norvir) and <a href="../simple/indi.html">indinavir</a> (Crixivan). Each protease inhibitor is different. The following pages cover some of the latest information about each drug. The Network also has constantly updated Simple Fact Sheets on each drug, in English or <a href="../lared/index.html">Spanish</a>. To request the latest fact sheet, call the Network at (800) 734-7104. </p>

<p><b>saquinavir (Invirase)</b></p>

<p>Saquinavir (trade name Invirase) has been approved for use by people with under 300 T4 cells, in combination with one or more of the approved nucleoside analog drugs (AZT, ddI, ddC, d4T and 3TC). The current recommended dosage is 600 mg, three times a day. A recently completed study compared the combination of saquinavir and the nucleoside analog drug ddC (trade name HIVID) to saquinavir or ddC taken alone. This study began in February 1994, and lasted for about a year and a half. The average T4 cell count of people in the study was 160-180. This study found that the combination of saquinavir/ddC reduced the death rate by two thirds - there were 28 deaths on ddC, 34 on saquinavir and 9 in the combination saquinavir/ddC group.</p>

<p>This study began a long time ago. Currently, the combination of saquinavir and ddC is not thought to be the strongest anti-HIV drug combination. Recent studies have reported stronger anti-HIV effects using other protease inhibitors with combinations of two nucleoside analog drugs. The results of this saquinavir/ddC study offer great hope that stronger anti-HIV drug combinations will help people with HIV and AIDS live much longer.</p>

<p>Saquinavir, in the current formulation, is not very well absorbed by the body. This is thought to be the reason why it is weaker than the other protease inhibitors. A new version of saquinavir is being tested that will hopefully be better absorbed. The new version of saquinavir is expected to replace the current pill when the testing is completed.</p>

<p>Hoffman-La Roche, the company that makes saquinavir, has set up an <a href="../access/pa/saqu.html">assistance program</a> for people that need help getting the drug. The number to call is (800) 282-7780. The hours are Monday to Friday, 9:00 AM to 8:00 PM EST.</p>

<p><b>ritonavir (Norvir)</b></p>

<p>Ritonavir (trade name Norvir) was the second protease inhibitor to be approved for prescription. In a six month study in people with advanced AIDS, ritonavir cut the death rate by half.</p>

<p>The major side effects seen in ritonavir studies were nausea, vomiting, weakness and diarrhea. Other side effects that have been associated with the drug are numbing sensations around the mouth and elevated liver enzymes.</p>

<p>Now that the drug is approved, people are reporting that these side effects may be very common and more severe than had been thought. This has led Abbott to recommend building up the dose of ritonavir slowly over a few days when first starting the drug. People can start at 300 mg twice a day, and then move on to 400 mg twice a day after a few days, continuing until you reach the recommended dose of 600 mg twice a day.</p>

<p>It is very important that you take no more than 14 days to build up the dose, as this could help HIV get resistant to the effects of the drug. If you can't take the full dose, the lowest dose that can be used is 500 mg twice a day, and this must be in combination with other anti-HIV drugs.</p>

<p>The drug should also be taken with a full high-protein, high-fat meal if possible. Anecdotal reports also suggest that taking ritonavir right after a meal with yogurt may help reduce side effects. If side effects continue and you cannot tolerate the drug, it may be an idea to consider another protease inhibitor.</p>

<p>Abbott Laboratories, the makers of ritonavir, have set up a <a href="../access/pa/rito.html">patient assistance program</a> for people having difficulty paying for the drug. Call (800) 659-9050 for more information.</p>

<p><b>indinavir (Crixivan)</b></p>

<p>Indinavir (trade name Crixivan) is the most recently approved protease inhibitor. Studies of indinavir have shown large reductions in the amount of HIV in the body and increases in T4 cells. In a small, ongoing study of indinavir in combination with the nucleoside analog drugs AZT and 3TC, the levels of HIV in the bloodstream have been greatly reduced. After 48 weeks, in most of the people on the combination, HIV levels are so low that they cannot be measured by the standard viral load test, which can't detect less than 500 copies of HIV.</p>

<p>The recommended dosage of indinavir is 800 mg every 8 hours. The drug should be taken with water on an empty stomach, either 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating. Alternatively, indinavir may be taken with other liquids such as skim milk, juice, coffee, or tea, or with a light meal, e.g., dry toast with jelly, juice, and coffee with skim milk and sugar; or corn flakes, skim milk and sugar. To avoid dehydration and kidney stones, it is recommended that you drink at least 1.5 liters (approximately 48 ounces) of liquids during the course of 24 hours.</p>

<p>To avoid developing resistance to the drug, it is very important not to skip doses. If you do miss a dose, stay on schedule and don't double the next dose. Try and stick as close to the 8 hour schedule as possible, as this keeps a constant level of indinavir in your body, making it harder for HIV to become resistant to the effects of the drug.</p>

<p>There are some concerns about supplies of the drug. A new factory is being built. For this reason, until at least October of 1996, indinavir will only be available via mail order from Stadtlanders Pharmacy. Your doctor mails or faxes Stadtlanders the prescription, and the drug is sent out via Federal Express. The number to call for more information is (800) 927-8888.</p>

<p><b>Experimental protease inhibitors</b></p>

<p>There are newer protease inhibitors that are in <a href="../trials/hiv.html">clinical trials</a>. Nelfinavir (trade name Viracept) is a protease inhibitor made by a company called Agouron. Early results have shown large reductions in the amount of HIV in the body using this drug in combination with the nucleoside analog d4T (Zerit). These results are only from a few people so far. The main side effects of this drug seem to be abdominal discomfort and diarrhea, which has been controlled with over-the-counter antidiarrheal medications.</p>

<p>A small study of nelfinavir in combination with AZT and 3TC was presented at the International Conference on AIDS. Eleven participants have received three months of treatment so far. None of the participants had taken anti-HIV drugs before. All participants have had the level of HIV in their blood reduced to less than 25 copies. Using another test called viral culture, researchers were unable to find HIV in the bloodstream of any participants. This study is ongoing.</p>

<p>At the same conference, encouraging information about HIV resistance to nelfinavir was presented. This was the first resistance information from people that had been taking the drug in studies. It appears that when HIV gets resistant to nelfinavir, it may not be resistant to the effects of other protease inhibitors. Further studies will be needed to confirm this. Larger clinical trials are ongoing. To find out about study sites in the New York area call the Network.</p>

<p>Another experimental protease inhibitor is VX478 (also known as 141W94). This drug is made by a company called Vertex. The drug seems safe and well absorbed according to early studies, but there is no information available about the drug's anti-HIV effects. Phase II studies are due to begin later in 1996.</p>

<h3><a name="paying">Paying</a> for protease inhibitors</h3>

<p>The approval of protease inhibitors has added a great deal of stess to an already overburdened healthcare system. Federal, state and city governments need to very carefully plan how they are going to support treatment programs on an ongoing basis. Stopping a protease inhibitor can very quickly create drug resistance - leaving someone with HIV with few other treatment options.</p>

<p>There have been some successes. The Clinton administration has successfully persuaded Congress to provide additional money to <a href="../access/index.html">AIDS Drug Assistance Programs</a> throughout the country. The ADAP programs help people who would otherwise not be able to afford effective and life-saving treatments to get them. This new money will help pay for the three recently approved protease inhibitors.</p>

<p>Thanks to the efforts of many community organizers and advocates, the strong support of the Clinton administration, Democratic and Republican members of Congress, New York State residents can now request coverage of protease inhibitors through ADAP.</p>

<p>Most of the money to pay for ADAP programs comes from the Ryan White Care Act, which was also recently approved by a bipartisan majority of Congress. This money helps to pay for ADAP programs, and many kinds of treatment programs for men, women and children with AIDS.</p>

<p>Medicaid is a program for low income or unemployed people without health insurance. Federal law requires that Medicaid pay for any new FDA approved drug in almost all states in the US. There are sometimes restrictions on the amount of prescriptions you can get each month, which can be a problem for many people with HIV and AIDS. If you're having difficulty getting a protease inhibitor covered by Medicaid, call the Access Project at (800) 734-7104 for information on your state's Medicaid policies.</p>

<p><b>Getting in touch with ADAP</b><br>
The New York State AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) can be reached at (800) 542-2437. The application process is simple, they ask that you earn less than $44,000 a year and have less than $25,000 in assets not including your home or car. A phone bill or other mail can be used to show that you are a New York State resident. For contact phone numbers for other state ADAP's, call the Access Project at (800) 734-7104.</p>

<p>The Network has been and will continue to be actively involved nationwide in helping people get information about, and coverage for, treatments for AIDS and HIV. Through our program, The Access Project, we have been advocating for coverage of the treatments that people with AIDS and HIV need. (This program is funded by contributions. Contact Richard Jefferys, Access Project Director, for more information at (800)734-7104.)</p>

<h3><a name="nnrtis">A</a> New Class of Anti-HIV Drugs</h3>

<p>Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are a new class of anti-HIV drugs. Reverse transcriptase is a part of HIV required to infect cells in the body and make more virus. NNRTIs stop the reverse transcriptase from working properly. The approved nucleoside analog drugs (AZT, ddI, ddC, d4T and 3TC) also work by stopping reverse transcriptase, but these drugs have to go through a chemical process in infected cells before they work. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors work against HIV in infected cells without any chemical processing, and this may help them have a stronger anti-HIV effect.</p>

<p><b>delavirdine (Rescriptor)</b><br>
Delavirdine (trade name Rescriptor) is one of the new class of experimental anti-HIV drugs called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Delavirdine is now available through an expanded access program for people with less than 300 T4 cells. Your doctor can call (800) 779-0070 for more information.</p>

<p>Delavirdine has been shown in clinical trials to be well-absorbed by the body. Drug concentrations can be achieved in the blood that are 100 to 1,000 times the concentrations needed to inhibit HIV in the test tube. So far, the major side effect seen with delavirdine has been a rash, which develops in 20 to 25 percent of people taking the drug. This side effect can be reduced by starting treatment at lower doses of the drug and escalating to a full dose.</p>

<p><a href="../trials/hiv.html">Clinical trials</a> of delavirdine are ongoing. Early results from two trials have been presented. One study divided participants into four groups. One group took AZT alone. The second group took AZT and 600 mg of delavirdine a day. The third group took AZT and 900 mg of delavirdine a day. The fourth group took AZT and 1200 mg of delavirdine a day. People in this study had an average T4 cell count of just over 300.</p>

<p>After 40-60 weeks, people in the higher dose (900 and 1200 mg a day) delavirdine groups had T4 cell counts 35-70 cells higher than people taking AZT alone. People in these higher dose groups also had a 70% or greater drop in the amount of HIV in the blood, known as viral load, for at least 60 weeks. This study is ongoing, so how long this reduction in viral load will be sustained is not yet known.</p>

<p>The second study compared ddI taken alone to ddI taken with delavirdine at a dose of 1200 mg a day. The average T4 cell count of people in this study was 135. There were no large increases in T4 cell counts in this study, although they remained above or near the baseline for at least a year. However, as in the previous study, a reduction in viral load of around 70% was sustained for at least 60 weeks.</p>

<p>Scientists also looked at information from these studies in another way. They matched the information about viral load to the actual health of the study participants. This was done to see if measuring the amount of virus in the blood can be used to monitor the health of a person with HIV. The results showed that viral load was very strongly linked to a person's health.</p>

<p>Note</b>: the following viral load information is based on the Upjohn/Pharmacia viral load test which gives results approximately five times higher than other viral load tests. As always, close consultation with your health care provider is important when trying to interpret and understand viral load test results.</p>

<p>People who began the studies with a viral load of less than 100,000 had only a 1% chance of experiencing any disease progression during the approximately 60 weeks for which information has been collected. People who started with a viral load of between 100,000 and 1,000,000 had a slightly higher chance of disease progression. People who started with a viral load of over 1,000,000 had a 24% chance of disease progression.</p>

<p>Treatment that reduced viral load was linked to improved health. Improved health was most noticeable in people who started the studies with a viral load of over 100,000. For these people, reduction in viral load of 70% or more for as little as 8 weeks reduced their chance of experiencing any disease progression by half during the study period of a little over a year.</p>

<p>Delavirdine can interact with other medications you may be taking. It is processed by a pathway in the liver that is used to process many other drugs, including the protease inhibitors. The following have been shown to reduce the levels of delavirdine in the body: rifabutin, rifampin, ddI and antacids. Several other drugs may interact with delavirdine, a list will be provided to those enrolling in the expanded access program. Also, it is recommended that delavirdine be taken on an empty stomach. The current dosage is 400 mg, three times a day.</p>

<p><b>nevirapine (Viramune)</b><br>
Nevirapine (trade name Viramune) is another non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Nevirapine has been approved for use in combination with nucleoside analog anti-HIV drugs in people who are failing their current treatment. Nevirapine will be available from pharmacies in August. Nevirapine is not approved for use with the protease inhibitor anti-HIV drugs (saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir) as it is not yet known how these drugs may affect each other in the body. It is possible that taking nevirapine with protease inhibitors could be harmful to the liver.</p>

<p><b>Trial results</b>: The largest study of nevirapine was done in people with less than 350 T4 cells. There were 398 people in the study. The average T4 cell count was 138. Everyone had taken AZT, ddI or ddC for at least six months before starting the study. People were divided randomly into two groups. One group took AZT and ddI. The second group took AZT, ddI and nevirapine.</p>

<p>After four weeks, the amount of virus in the blood was reduced by about 90% in people taking AZT, ddI and nevirapine. However, after 48 weeks both groups had less T4 cells than at the start of the study, but T4 cell counts were around 30 cells higher in the AZT/ddI/nevirapine group. The amount of virus in the blood, or viral load, was slightly lower in the AZT/ddI/nevirapine group. In terms of disease progression or survival, 17% of people on AZT/ddI/nevirapine had a progression of disease or died, compared to 14% in the AZT/ddI group. This difference was not statistically significant, which means it could have been due to chance. This study did not show a significant benefit from adding nevirapine to AZT and ddI therapy.</p>

<p>The most positive study of nevirapine that has been presented so far divided 151 participants into three groups. One group took nevirapine with AZT and ddI. The second group took AZT with ddI. The third group took nevirapine with AZT. The average T4 cell count was 376. No-one in this study had taken anti-HIV drugs before. After 52 weeks the 51 people in the nevirapine/AZT/ddI group had an average of 140 more T4 cells than at the start of the study. The AZT/ddI group had 30 more T4 cells than at the start of the study. The nevirapine/AZT group had the same number of T4 cells as they had started with. In this study, measurements of the amount of HIV in the blood are available after 28 weeks of the study. Both the AZT/ddI/nevirapine and AZT/ddI groups had a greater than 90% reduction in the amount of HIV in their blood after 28 weeks. The nevirapine/AZT group had a large drop in the amount of HIV in their blood after four weeks, but were nearly back to where they had started after 28 weeks on the study.</p>

<p><b>Resistance</b>: HIV seems to get resistant to the effects of nevirapine very quickly unless the drug is used with two other nucleoside analogue drugs. If a person is resistant to nevirapine, they will likely be resistant to the other NNRTI that will soon be available, delavirdine.</p>

<p><b>Side effects</b>: The major side effect of nevirapine is a rash, which happened to 22% of people in studies. 6% of people in studies had a severe rash. 6.7% of people had to stop taking nevirapine because of this problem. This problem can be reduced by starting treatment at 200 mg a day and escalating, or building up, to the higher dose of 400 mg a day. If nevirapine causes a severe rash and you have to stoptreatment, the company that makes the drug recommends that you DO NOT try the drug again. Other side effects can be elevated liver function tests, fever and muscle soreness.</p>

<p><b>Drug interactions</b>: Nevirapine is processed in the body by the liver, like many other drugs. It has the potential to interact with commonly used drugs such as rifabutin, rifampin and ketoconazole and researchers advise that people be monitored closely for interactions if they are taking other drugs with nevirapine. In studies, taking nevirapine with the antifungal drug fluconazole (Diflucan) increased the chance of getting a rash.</p>

<p>In addition to the expanded access programs, clinical trials of both delavirdine and nevirapine are enrolling. Another NNRTI called HBY-097 is also currently in clinical trials. Call The Network for a full listing of these clinical trials.</p>

<h3><a name="mac">MAC</a> Treatment Warnings</h3>

<p><b>Clarithromycin Warning!</b><br>
The government has issued a warning about the drug clarithromycin (Biaxin), often used for MAC treatment and prevention. The drug should not be used at doses greater than the approved dose, which is 500 mg twice daily. Higher doses have been associated with poor survival.</p>

<p><b>Clofazimine Warning!</b><br>
A recent study has found that the drug clofazimine (trade name Lamprene) should not be used as part of combination antibiotic treatment for MAC. MAC is a bacterial infection that can cause serious illness in people with AIDS. In a study comparing clarithromycin (Biaxin) and ethambutol (Myambutol) to clarithromycin, ethambutol and clofazimine for the treatment of MAC, people receiving clofazimine had poorer survival than people receiving just clarithromycin and ethambutol.</p>

<p>Standard treatment for MAC is clarithromycin (Biaxin) or azithromycin (Zithromax) along with ethambutol (Myambutol). Recent Public Health Service recommendations noted that many doctors add a third drug to this regimen, usually rifabutin, rifampin, ciprofloxacin, amikacin or clofazimine. Clofazimine should no longer be considered a possible third drug for MAC treatment.</p>

<h3><a name="viral">Viral</a> Load Test Approved!</h3>

<p>The PCR viral load test has been approved by the FDA. Viral load stests measure what's called HIV RNA. RNA is the part of HIV that knows how to make more virus. The PCR test has been approved by the FDA for checking the health of people with HIV, to see if they may be at risk for getting sick. The PCR test is also approved for checking the effects of anti-HIV drugs, to see if they are working against the virus.</p>

<p>Guidelines for using the viral load test are being developed. It seems clear that the risk for disease progression increases as the viral load gets higher. The decision to use anti-HIV drugs will probably need to be made by looking at the viral load and other factors like the T4 cell count and symptoms of illness. The Network has a <a href="../simple/viral.html">Simple Fact Sheet</a> with more information about viral load tests, call us at (800) 734-7104 for a free copy.</p>

<h3><a name="briefs">Treatment </a>Briefs</h3>

<p><b>F-ddA for HIV</b><br>
The drug F-ddA is related to the approved anti-HIV drug ddI, but is expected to be better absorbed and easier to take. The buffers in ddI pills can make the drug difficult to take, although a new formulation of ddI has recently become available. A trial of F-ddA for the treatment of HIV infection is being done at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Bethesda, Maryland. In the test tube, F-ddA is active against ddI resistant HIV. Study participants will be hospitalized for the first three days, but the remainder of the study will be done on an outpatient basis. You must have T4 cells between 100-400 and have been off all anti-HIV drugs for three weeks to take part in this study. The NCI will pay for airfare for every visit except the first. Call The Network for a referral.</p>

<p><b>Garlic for Cryptosporidiosis?</b><br>
Results of a trial of garlic for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis have beenannounced. Cryptosporidiosis is an infection of the gut caused by a parasite called cryptosporidium, the main symptom is prolonged diarrhea which leads to weight loss. The trial was conducted by a community-based research organization called the AIDS ResearchAlliance in California. The trial used a garlic concentrate called Allicin, which is available in the US in 30 mg glass vials that are imported from China. In this study, 30 mg of Allicin was mixed with 90cc of distilled water. This mixture was taken twice daily by participants.</p>

<p>Twenty people enrolled in the study. The only major side effect, as expected, was a strong garlic smell and taste. This side effect was a problem for about a third of the participants and led at least one person to drop out of the study. After six weeks, there were sixteen people remaining in the study. Ten of these people had less diarrhea and fewer watery stools, and had stable or increased body weight. The most significant finding of the study was that, in four out of eight people who chose to remain on the study for longer than eight weeks, stool tests have been repeatedly negative for the cryptosporidium parasite. The average T4 cell count of people in this study was less than 30, and most had tried and failed the standard cryptosporidiosis treatment, Humatin. Clearance of cryptosporidium has not been reported before in people with T4 cell counts this low. AIDS Research Alliance is planning a larger, phase II study of Allicin for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis. The AIDS Research Alliance can be reached at (310) 358-2423 for more information.</p>

<p><b>Treatments and Trials for Kaposi's Sarcoma</b><br>
Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a type of cancer that people with HIV may develop. KS is more commonly seen in men than in women. Although KS mainly affects the skin, the mouth, and the lymph nodes, it can also involve the bowels and lungs. If it becomes severe, it may lead to swelling or breakdown of the skin. KS growths, called lesions or tumors, can show up in a wide range of colors, from pink to red-violet to brown to blue.</p>

<p>A trial being conducted at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Bethesda, Maryland, is studying the drug <a href="../simple/thalid.html">thalidomide</a> for the treatment of KS. Thalidomide is thought to inhibit angiogenesis, which is the development of new blood vessels that can help KS lesions grow. To be in the study, you must have biopsy proven KS with evidence of progression during the two months prior to the study and at least 5 measurable lesions that have never received locally administered therapy. The NCI will pay for airfare for every visit except the first.</p>

<p>Another trial, being conducted at several sites around the New York City area, is studying a treatment called ARLT 1057 for KS on the skin. ARLT 1057 is a gel that is applied directly to the KS lesion. You can't have internal KS to be in this study. Call The Network at (800) 734-7104 for a referral to either of these studies.</p>

<p>A new treatment called <a href="../simple/daun.html">DaunoXome</a> has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced KS. DaunoXome is a liposomal drug. Liposomal drugs are standard chemotherapy drugs used to treat KS that are put inside microscopic bubbles of fat called liposomes. When the drugs are used this way, it is hoped they will have fewer side effects and be more effective. DaunoXome is a liposomal version of the anti-cancer drug daunorubicin. DaunoXome is given intravenously, which means via a tube placed into your arm or chest, once every two weeks. NeXstar, the makers of DaunoXome, have set up a <a href="../access/pa/daun.html">patient assistance program</a> to help people have access to the drug. Call (800) 226-2056 for more information.</p>

<p><b>Sorivudine for Kids</b><br>
A nationwide trial is studying sorivudine (formerly known as BV-ara-U) for the treatment of herpes zoster (shingles or chickenpox) infections in HIV infected children and adolescents. Herpes zoster consists of very painful blisters on the skin that follow nerve pathways. The infection must be unresponsive to standard treatments. A physician can enroll a patient by calling Scott Oshana at Bristol-Myers Squibb, (203) 284-7658.</p>

<p><b>Cidofovir for Genital Warts in Women</b><br>
Cidofovir is an antiviral drug being studied in a topical gel formulation for the treatment of external genital warts in women. The gel is applied directly to the warts. To take part in this study you must be over 18 and have a T4 cell count of over 100. You must also have failed previous treatment. The study is being done at Bronx Lebanon Hospital Center, call The Network for a referral.</p>

<dd><b>New Treatments Approved</b>: New AIDS and HIV treatments, and combinations of existing treatments have recently been approved. One treatment has been shown to greatly reduce the amount of HIV virus in the body, and to help people stay healthy and live longer. This issue of Treatment Review provides basic information about existing HIV treatments and the new drugs that are available. We've also included fact sheets about all three approved protease inhibitors, and the newly approved combination treatment of 3TC and AZT. 
<br>
<dd><a href="#combo">Combination Therapy</a>: Good, unexpected news about an entirely new class of drugs called protease inhibitors. A new protease inhibitor has been clearly shown to help prevent disease progression and death in people with low T4 cells. A new combination treatment reduces the amount of HIV virus in the body, and also raises T4 cells even in people who are already taking AZT. Another protease inhibitor, when taken together with other anti-HIV drugs, dramatically reduces the amount of  HIV in the blood.  
<br>
<dd><a href="#3tc">Epivir (3TC or lamivudine)</a> is a new treatment, approved by the FDA for combination therapy with AZT. Ongoing studies are testing 3TC in combination with other anti-HIV drugs, including protease inhibitors.
<br>
<dd><a href="#saquin">Saquinavir Fact Sheet</a>: The first protease inhibitor approved by the FDA. 
<br>
<dd><a href="#riton">Ritonavir Fact Sheet</a>: This protease inhibitor was recommended for approval by the FDA, then fully approved within 24 hours. It's a potent drug that has been shown to prolong life and decrease the amount of HIV virus in the blood. A drug that people with less than 100 T4 cells should consider taking. 
<br>
<dd><a href="#indi">Indinavir Fact Sheet</a>: Although this protease inhibitor has not been tested in a large number of people or for a long period of time, the study results were promising enough that the FDA recommended the drug for approval. 
<br>
<dd><a href="#viral">Viral Load Testing</a>: A new type of test is being studied as a way to better measure whether or not a treatment is actually working.  Researchers hope these tests will help show if an HIV treatment is working. They also hope the amount of virus in the blood may indicate if someone should start or change to a different HIV treatment.

<blockquote><a name="combo"><h3>Combination therapy advances</h3></a>

<p>Studies of anti-HIV treatment have been done, for the most part, in people with between 200 and 500 T4 cells. In the absence of any symptoms, this is thought to be a good time to start thinking about anti-HIV treatment.  The drugs most widely tested in this group of people are called nucleoside analogues. AZT, ddC, ddI, d4T and 3TC are drugs of this type. The body breaks down these drugs into chemicals that stop HIV from infecting uninfected cells in the body, but it does not help cells that have already been infected with the virus. As people with AIDS lose T4 cells - one of the immune systems main defenses - they become more likely to get infections and illnesses. </p>

<p>In the past, people took one of these types of drugs at a time. Now, however, it is known that a combination of these drugs work better, even in people who have under 200 T4 cells. There are several new drugs that can be used as part of combination treatment.  3TC, also known as Epivir or lamivudine, is in the same class of drugs as AZT, ddI, ddC and d4T. The combination of AZT and 3TC was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for people with less than 500 T4 cells. Several studies showed that people who took this combination, even if they were already taking AZT, had increases in their T4 cells, as well as a reduction in the amount of HIV virus in their blood. Studies are being done to find out if 3TC works as well with other anti-HIV drugs.</p>

<p>In addition, the combination of AZT and ddC (HIVID) was also recently recommended for full approval as combination therapy. Results of several studies showed that this drug combination slowed progression of HIV disease and improved survival, primarily in people who had never taken AZT before. </p>

<p><b>A new class of drugs</b>: Protease inhibitors are a long awaited, new class of anti-HIV drugs that block a part of the HIV virus called protease. Protease inhibitors force the HIV virus to make copies of itself that can't infect new cells. This is the first new class of anti-HIV drugs approved since nucleoside analogues (AZT, etc.). It seems likely that combination anti-HIV therapy will also include a protease inhibitor, although the decision to start taking a protease inhibitor should be well thought out.  Each recently approved protease inhibitor is described in this issue of Treatment Review. </p>

<p>Protease inhibitors appear to cause less side effects than AZT type drugs, but each individual protease inhibitor is different. Like any other drugs, they all have potential side effects and may effect the way other drugs work in the body. The newly approved protease inhibitor, ritonavir, for example, can not be taken with the drug mycobutin. It is important to discuss potential side effects and interactions with a health care provider before starting to take any new treatment. </p>

<P>Whether or not someone is able to take a protease inhibitor may also be determined by the kind of health insurance or assistance program a person uses to get medications. (Contact The Access Project at The Network if you need a referral to an ADAP in your state, or assistance accessing any treatment). </p>

<p>The first protease inhibitor to be approved by the FDA is saquinavir (Invirase). Although this drug is not very well absorbed by the body -  a new version of saquinavir that is better absorbed is being studied - studies show that  the drug lowers the amount of HIV virus in the body, and increases T4 cells. People who are already on combination therapy might consider adding this drug to their treatment regimen, especially if the benefits of combination therapy seem to be wearing off. According to the makers of the drug, Hoffman-La Roche, taking saquinavir is not likely to spoil the benefits of taking other protease inhibitors in the future. This has not yet been proven, however.</p>

<p>The protease inhibitor ritonavir (Norvir) was recently approved by the FDA. It is made by Abbott Laboratories. Studies show that ritonavir reduces the amount of HIV in the blood better than saquinavir. Ritonavir is the only protease inhibitor, so far, that has been shown to actually help people live longer. The study that demonstrated these benefits was conducted in people with less than 100 T4 cells. This is very good news for people already diagnosed with AIDS. It is not yet proven that the same effects will be seen in people with higher T4 cell counts.</p>

<p>The third protease inhibitor, recommended for approval by the FDA, is called indinavir (Crixivan). Like ritonavir, this protease inhibitor appears to be more potent than saquinavir. All of the study results of indinavir have shown increases in T4 cell counts and a reduction of HIV virus. Although the studies of this drug have been very small, the results have been very encouraging. Hopefully, further studies will show that the benefits of indinavir are seen for a longer period of time in a greater number of people.</p>

<p><b>Deciding which treatment to take</b><br>

The decision about which combination to take should be based on several factors, such as which combination has the best chance of reducing the amount of HIV in the body for the longest time, and which combination will best increase or keep the T4 cell count at its current number and hopefully prevent disease progression. Possible side effects of the drug combination, the number of pills that would need to be taken, and the kind of symptoms someone is experiencing, if any, should also be part of the decision making process. It is also important to think about what the other options would be if one combination stops working.</p>

<p>Those who are currently benefitting from combination nucleoside analog therapy, and those who have not yet started combination therapy, may want to wait for more information before starting to take any protease inhibitor. Different combinations of protease inhibitors and nucleoside analog drugs are being tested in clinical trials. The Network has a current information on all combination therapy trials in our area, and a free handbook about the potential risks and benefits of clinical trials called <a href="../shouldi.html">Should I Join An AIDS Drug Trial?</a>.</p>

<P>Protease inhibitors can have side effects. These seem to be seen less often than with the nucleoside analog drugs, but  some side effects can be serious. Ritonavir, for example, blocks a pathway in the liver that is often used to clear drugs from the body. This effects the way other medications are processed in the body, causing drugs to get backed up in the liver. It is important to be carefully monitored when taking any new treatment. Protease inhibitors may also have rare side effects that have not yet been seen. </p>

<p>Resistance is a big concern with protease inhibitors. It seems that the best way to avoid resistance is to take the drug on time, and not  to skip doses. Taking protease inhibitors in combination with other anti-HIV drugs has also been shown to slow down resistance. Researchers have been very clear about one thing: It is a very bad idea to stop taking a protease inhibitor once started.  Be well informed about the possible risks and benefits of any treatments.  If you have questions, ask your doctor or a health care provider, or call our national, toll-free phone number at (800)734-7104.</p>

<h3><a name="3tc">AZT</a> & 3TC</h3>

<p>Studies have shown that 3TC can raise T4-cell levels, and lower levels of HIV. More importantly, studies show that 3TC treatment may make AZT work better, even in people who have already taken AZT for a long time. 3TC has been approved by the government for use in combination with AZT in people with less than 500 T4 cells. The recommended dosage of 3TC is 150 mg twice a day.</p>

<p><b>Trial results</b>: One trial compared AZT plus 3TC to AZT alone. Participants started with T4 cell counts of 100-400 and had taken AZT for less than 4 weeks at any time. After the first 24 weeks all participants switched to 3TC plus AZT for 24 more weeks. Increases in T4 cell counts were seen in those taking both drugs together. T4 cell counts rose an average of 85 cells by week 8 and 80 cells by week 24. Smaller increases were seen in those taking AZT alone. </p>

<p>During the second phase of the study, T4 cell counts for those who had started on AZT alone and added 3TC increased by 40 cells. Participants who took both drugs from the beginning had an average of 49 more T4 cells by week 48. Levels of HIV measured in the blood were reduced by more than 90% by the combination treatment. Only 5 people withdrew from the study because of side effects. </p>

<p>Another trial compared AZT plus 3TC to AZT plus ddC in people who had taken AZT for an average of two years and had average T4 cell counts of 211. Participants taking AZT plus 3TC were divided into two more groups. One group took low-dose 3TC with the AZT, the other group took high-dose 3TC with the AZT. The participants in this trial had more advanced disease than those in the first trial. After 6 months of treatment, levels of virus measured in the blood were nearly the same in both groups on this trial. T4 cell counts rose an average of 32 for the low dose 3TC combination, 15 for the high dose 3TC combination, and went down 15 for those taking AZT and ddC. </p>

<p>Studies have also shown that 3TC reduces the amount of hepatitis B virus to where it can't be found anymore in all participants. Lasting results at the same dosage level were found in 6 of 22 patients over six months. </p>

<p><b>Side effects</b>: In studies, the side effects of headache, nausea and fatigue were all seen in more than a quarter of the people taking the combination of 3TC and AZT. Other side effects seen were nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhea, neuropathy (burning pain in the hands or feet), low white blood cells and anemia (low red blood cells). These side effects are sometimes seen when AZT is taken by itself. 3TC alone has few side-effects, mainly nausea, vomiting and headaches, and rare cases of hair loss. </p>

<p>In children, 3TC can cause a side effect called pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is a dangerous swelling of an organ in the body called the pancreas. Children taking 3TC should be carefully monitored for this side effect. </p>

<p><b>Resistance</b>:  HIV can mutate to try and resist the effects of 3TC within a few weeks after treatment starts.  But lab tests have shown that when the virus becomes resistant to 3TC, it is no longer resistant to AZT. It seems to take a long time for HIV to become resistant to both drugs. Virus that is resistant to 3TC may also reproduce less well than normal virus.</p>

<p><b>Access</b>: Glaxo Wellcome Inc. has a <a href="../access/pa/lami.html">patient assistance program</a> for people having problems getting the drug. The number to call is (800)  722-9294. People that have been receiving the drug through the expanded access program and who now need help with reimbursement should call (800)  513-3028.

<p><a href="../trials/hiv.html">Studies</a> of 3TC in combination with other anti-HIV drugs are enrolling. Call The Network at (800) 734-7104 for a referral.</p>

<h3><a name="saquin">saquinavir</a> (Invirase)</h3>

<p>Saquinavir (trade name Invirase) is the first protease inhibitor to be approved for the treatment of HIV infection. Protease inhibitors are a new class of anti-HIV drugs. They work by blocking a part of HIV called protease. When protease is blocked, HIV makes copies of itself that can't infect new cells. Saquinavir has been approved for use by people with under 300 T4 cells, in combination with one or more of the approved nucleoside analog drugs (AZT, ddI, ddC, d4T and 3TC). The current recommended dosage is 600 mg, three times a day.</p>

<p><b>Trial results</b>: In the largest clinical trial of saquinavir, the combinations tested were saquinavir/AZT, saquinavir/AZT/ddC, and AZT/ddC. After 48 weeks of treatment, people taking saquinavir/AZT/ddC had an average increase of 111 T4 cells. People taking saquinavir/AZT had an average increase of 74 T4 cells. People taking AZT and ddC had an average increase of 72 T4 cells.</p>

<p><b>Resistance</b>: Studies have shown that HIV can become resistant to the effects of saquinavir. This happens because HlV makes more of itself all the time, and each new HIV virus that gets made can be slightly different. The type of protease that the HIV virus creates may be slightly different than the one it made before. The new protease that the virus has made may not be affected by saquinavir.</p>

<p>If HIV becomes resistant to saquinavir, it may also be resistant to the effects of other protease inhibitors. There are two changes, called mutations, in HIV protease that saquinavir commonly causes. One of the mutations may make it easier for HIV to resist the effects of some other protease inhibitors. In one study, after a year of taking saquinavir, less than half the participants had any resistant virus.</p>

<p>Saquinavir, in the current formulation, is not very well absorbed by the body. A small study done in California showed that the drug could have more anti-HIV effect when taken in higher doses. However, the doses used in this study would be very expensive and involve taking many pills every day. A new version of the drug is being tested that will hopefully be better absorbed. This new version of saquinavir will replace the current pill when the testing is completed.</p> 

<p>Studies have looked at ways to help the body better absorb saquinavir. Taking the drug after a full meal is strongly recommended. A small study found that ordinary reconstituted frozen grapefruit juice could help increase the levels of saquinavir in the body. People in the study drank a small (150ml) glass of the grapefruit juice with their saquinavir, followed by another glass an hour later. Drug levels were increased by about 50 percent. When people made the grapefruit juice stronger by mixing it with half the amount of water, the levels of saquinavir in their bodies doubled.</p>

<p>There may be problems with using this method to try and increase the absorption of saquinavir. The grapefruit juice may affect other drugs you are taking, and this could be dangerous. The acidity of grapefruit juice may also irritate the stomach. If you are thinking of using grapefruit juice to boost the levels of saquinavir in your body, talk about it with your healthcare provider.</p>

<p><b>Side effects</b>: Compared to nucleoside analog drugs, saquinavir seems to have few side effects. In studies, the most common side effects, occurring in very few people, were diarrhea, stomach discomfort and nausea.</p>

<p><b>Drug interactions</b>: The antibiotics rifampin and rifabutin (Mycobutin) can greatly reduce the amount of saquinavir in the body. It is recommended that alternatives to these drugs are used if someone needs to take saquinavir. The anti-fungal drug ketaconazole slightly increases the amount of saquinavir in the body.</p>

<p>Hoffman-La Roche, the company that makes saquinavir, has set up an <a href="../access/pa/saqu.html">assistance program</a> for people that need help getting the drug. The number to call is (800) 282-7780. The hours are Monday to Friday, 9:00 AM to 8:00 PM EST.</p>

<p>Studies are ongoing of the new version of saquinavir. Call The Network if you would like more information about these studies.</p>

<p>Ritonavir (trade name Norvir, also known as ABT-538) is also one of the new group of anti-HIV drugs called protease inhibitors. Ritonavir is made by a company called Abbott Pharmaceuticals. </p>

<p><b>Trial results</b>: In a study in people with less than 100 T4 cells, ritonavir was found to help people live longer, and delay progression of disease. There were 1090 people in this study. The average T4 cell count was around 30. People were allowed to take any approved anti-HIV drugs while on the study. One group of people added ritonavir to the medications they were taking, the second group got a placebo or dummy pill.</p>

<p>After an average of six months of follow-up, 46 people taking the placebo had died compared to 26 people taking ritonavir. This means that for people taking ritonavir, the risk of death was greatly reduced - almost halved - compared to people taking the placebo. </p>

<p>The researchers also looked at the study results after just one month. At this point in time, 149 people taking the placebo had experienced a new opportunistic infection or died, compared to 69 people taking ritonavir. This seems to show that the drug can have an effect very soon after someone starts taking it.</p>

<p>Other studies of ritonavir in combination with other anti-HIV drugs are ongoing. The full results of these studies are not yet known, although early reports are encouraging.</p>

<p>The current recommended dosage of ritonavir is 600mg, twice a day. The drug should be taken with meals, if possible.</p>

<p><b>Side effects</b>: The major side effects seen in this study were nausea, vomiting, weakness and diarrhea. 91 people stopped taking ritonavir because of side effects, compared to 32 people taking placebo. Other side effects that have been associated with the drug are numbing sensations around the mouth and elevated liver enzymes. </p>

<p>Some of these side effects are thought to be caused by the bad taste of the current syrup formulation of the drug. This has now been replaced by a gelatin capsule.</p>

<p><b>Drug interactions</b>: Ritonavir can effect the way other drugs are absorbed by the body. There is a long list of drugs that may be affected on the package insert that comes with ritonavir. It is very important that anyone about to start taking ritonavir goes over this list thoroughly with their healthcare provider. Some of the potential drug interactions are potentially life-threatening. If you need help working out which drugs are on the interaction list (some drugs have several different names) call The Network.</p>

<p>Not all protease inhibitors interact with as many other drugs. You may also be able to switch a problem drug so that you can take ritonavir.</p>

<p><b>Availability</b>: Ritonavir is now approved for the treatment of HIV disease and AIDS in adults. A study of ritonavir for people recently infected with HIV, and a study for children are enrolling. Call the Network for a referral.</p>

<h3><a name="indi">indinavir</a> (Crixivan)</h3>

<p>Indinavir (trade name Crixivan, also known as MK-639) is another of the new group of anti-HIV drugs called protease inhibitors. Indinavir is made by a company called Merck Pharmaceuticals.</p>

<p><b>Trial results</b>: There is only limited information from trials of indinavir. All of the study results so far have been limited to changes in T4 cell counts and viral load (the amount of virus in the blood). The information that has been presented has also been from a small number of people.</p>

<p>A study of the combination of indinavir, AZT and 3TC is ongoing. People in this study had been taking AZT for at least six months before they joined the trial. Participants were randomly assigned to indinavir/AZT/3TC, indinavir alone, or AZT and 3TC. </p>

<p>After 16 weeks, 24 of the 26 people taking the triple combination of indinavir, AZT and 3TC had so little virus in their blood that it could not be found using the standard viral load test. This test cannot find less than 500 copies of HIV in a milliliter of blood. 13 out of 26 people taking indinavir alone also had less than 500 copies of HIV in their blood samples. No-one taking AZT and 3TC had the amount of HIV in their blood reduced below 500 copies.</p>

<p>Some people in this study have now been followed for 24 weeks. 6 out of 7 people on indinavir/AZT/3TC still have less virus in their blood than the viral load test can find. 4 out of 9 people on indinavir alone also have less virus in their blood than can be detected. No-one in the AZT/3TC group has undetectable virus.</p>

<p>The median increases in T4 cells after 24 weeks were 146 in the indinavir/AZT/3TC group, 77 for the people taking indinavir alone, and 22 for people taking AZT/3TC. Other studies of indinavir seem to confirm that it has a strong anti-HIV effect. A small study combining indinavir/AZT/ddI found that people had a median increase of 90 T4 cells after 24 weeks.</p>

<p>It's important to remember that these results are from only a few people, and it isn't known yet whether they will be confirmed by larger studies. It is not yet proven that the drug will help people live longer or stay healthy longer. However, recent studies have found that reducing the amount of virus in the blood can also reduce the risk of disease progression and death. This leads scientists to hope that drugs like indinavir will help people stay healthy and live longer.</p>

<p><b>Resistance</b>: HIV can become resistant to the effects of indinavir. This has been seen in people in early studies where the indinavir dose was lower than the one now recommended. In these people, after 24 weeks on the study, levels of HIV in the blood returned to where they were before the study began. However, T4 cell increases averaging 80 to 100 were sustained for at least 52 weeks. This may mean that indinavir-resistant HIV is less harmful to the immune system than normal HIV. Further studies are being done to investigate this.</p>

<p>Resistance seems to occur much more slowly at the dose now being used.  Using indinavir in combination with nucleoside analog anti-HIV drugs also seems to significantly delay HIV resistance to the drugs. Combinations of protease inhibitors are being studied, and should not be tried until results are known. Protease inhibitors could interact in ways that may be harmful to the body.</p>

<p><b>Drug interactions</b>: The antibiotic drug <a href="../access/drugs/rifa.html">rifabutin</a> (Mycobutin) can be affected by indinavir. It is recommended that people halve their dose of rifabutin when taking it with indinavir.</p>

<p><b>Side effects</b>: The most common side effects of indinavir are kidney stones and the temporary elevation of a liver enzyme called bilirubin. These have been seen in about 2-3% of people taking the drug so far. Bilirubin usually returns to normal levels on it's own. Kidney stones can be avoided by drinking plenty of water. It is currently recommended that people taking indinavir drink a quart of water a day.</p>

<h3><a name="viral">Viral</a> load testing</h3>

<p>There are two kinds of viral load tests. The two tests measure what's called HIV RNA. RNA is the part of HIV that knows how to make more virus. One test, called the branched DNA test (bDNA), is made by a company called Chiron. The other is the polymerase chain reaction or PCR test made by Hoffman-LaRoche. </p>

<p>Scientists have a good idea what some parts of HIV RNA look like. By creating a mirror image and matching it against what they find in someone's blood, they can find HIV RNA. The PCR test encourages the HIV RNA to make more of itself in a laboratory test tube. This makes it easier to measure the amount of HIV RNA that was in the blood sample. The bDNA test sets off a chemical reaction with the HIV RNA so it gives out light. Then the amount of light is measured in order to show how much RNA was found. </p>

<p>The results of these tests are usually given per milliliter (ml) of blood, like the T4 cell count. The PCR test may give the amount per 0.05/ml, so you need to multiply the number by 20 to get the standard result. Each virus carries two copies of RNA. If there are 100,000 copies of HIV RNA, that means 50,000 viruses (often called particles or virions) are present. Currently, the bDNA test can't find less than 10,000 copies of HIV RNA, but a recent improvement means it will soon be able to find anything down to 500 copies.</p>

<p>Test results can be different, or variable, when repeated on the same blood sample. Any test results should say how variable the test might be. For example if the result was 20,000 copies and the variability of the test was 5,000, you'd know that the result was somewhere between 15,000 and 25,000 copies.</p>

<p>There is still concern that there is a lot of virus in other places in the body, not just the blood. Only 2% of HIV is in circulating blood. The rest is in your lymph system and other body tissue. Also, measuring the good effect an HIV treatment has on the viral load doesn't take into account any bad side-effects the treatment might have on the body.</p>

<p><b>Using the Test to Study a New Drug</b>. Early viral load results from a large study of a drug called delavirdine have recently been released. This study found that the viral load test was a very good marker of disease progression. In this study of around 1,900 people, viral load was better than T4 cell counts at showing whether someone might be at risk for getting sicker. The study also found that if a treatment reduced the amount of virus in the blood by half, for as little as 8 weeks, the risk of disease progression was also halved. Scientists hope that this means that the kind of reductions in virus seen with newer treatments such as protease inhibitors will help people stay healthy and live much longer. With some protease inhibitors the viral load test has shown a 99.99% reduction in the amount of HIV virus.</p>

<p><b>A Test of the Viral Load Test</b>. A study of the viral load test is currently enrolling. People in the study will be divided into two groups. One group will make decisions about HIV treatments based on their viral load. The second group will make treatment decisions using their T4 cell counts and symptoms. In the guidelines for this study, it says that a viral load test result of over 100,000 copies may mean that someone is at a higher risk for disease progression. A result of less than 10,000 copies is associated with a lower risk for disease progression.</p>

<p>The guidelines also state that only a large change in viral load can be considered important. Anything less than a threefold change may be due to unimportant changes that occur with all kinds of tests. In addition, other infections such as a cold or the flu can cause a temporary increase in viral load.  If you are interested in taking part in the viral load testing study, call The Network for a referral.</p>

<p>Currently, viral load testing is still experimental. Doctors can order them at a cost of about $200. However, it's hard to get an insurance company to pay for them. Medicaid will not cover them. It is likely that the tests will be approved for general use during 1996, once more results from ongoing research are available. More information on the Hoffman-LaRoche PCR test is available by calling (800) 533-0567. The number to call for information on the Chiron bDNA test is (800) 642-4657 x2909. Reimbursement assistance for the Chiron bDNA test is available by calling (800) 775-7533.</p>

<h3><a name="briefs">Treatment</a> briefs</h3>

<p><b>Agouron protease inhibitor</b>: A new protease inhibitor called nelfinavir (trade name Viracept) is in clinical trials. One study is investigating nelfinavir in combination with d4T, compared to d4T alone. A second study will investigate nelfinavir in combination with AZT and 3TC, compared to AZT and 3TC treatment. Call the Network for a referral to the trial sites.</p>

<p><b>Oxandrolone</b>: The anabolic steroid oxandrolone (trade name Oxandrin) is available by prescription for the treatment of weight loss. This drug was approved in the 1960's for the treatment of weight loss due to chronic infection or trauma. In one study of oxandrolone as a treatment for AIDS-related wasting, weight gain was seen in people taking 15 mg a day for 16 weeks. In people taking 5 mg a day, weight remained stable. People taking a placebo (a fake pill used in clinical trials) experienced weight loss. Oxandralone is a pill. This drug is not usually toxic to the liver, which can be a problem with other oral anabolic steroids. The drug also seems less likely to have a masculinizing effect on women than other anabolic steroids. The drug must be obtained direct from the distributor, Quantum Express. The number to call is (800) 741-2698. Quantum Express can deal directly with your health insurance to help obtain reimbursement, and also has a compassionate access program for those that cannot afford to pay for the drug.</p>

<p><b>The Access Project</b>: If you're having trouble affording a treatment, the Network's Access Project has a database of federal, state and pharmaceutical industry programs that may be able to help. Call (800) 734-7104 for more information and referrals.</p>

<p><b>DOXIL</b>: DOXIL is a newly approved treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma, or KS. DOXIL is a liposomal drug. Liposomal drugs are standard chemotherapy drugs used to treat KS that are put inside microscopic bubbles of fat called liposomes. When the drugs are used this way, it is hoped they will have fewer side effects and be more effective. DOXIL is a liposomal version of the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin. The drug is given intravenously, which means via a tube placed into your arm or chest. The procedure takes 30 minutes, and is done once every three weeks. DOXIL has been approved for the treatment of advanced KS in people that have not responded to the standard treatment.  DOXIL is also recommended for people who can't take the standard treatments  for KS because of side effects. Very few people in DOXIL studies have had to stop treatment because of side effects. The main side effect is neutropenia, which is low white blood cells. Treatment with G-CSF, also known as Neupogen, can help lessen this side effect. Other side effects can be hot flushes, tight chest, difficulty breathing or swallowing and back pain. DOXIL can also cause heart problems, although this has not been seen as often as with standard chemotherapy. Sequus Pharmaceuticals, the makers of DOXIL, have set up a patient assistance program. Patient assistance programs help people having difficulty paying for a treatment. Call (800) 375-1658 for more information.</p>

<p>The FDA recently approved a new kind of CMV retinitis treatment called <b><a href="../simple/implants.html">Vitrasert</a></b>. This is the anti-CMV drug ganciclovir, which is usually given by intravenous infusion, put into small plastic pellets. The pellets are placed into the eye during minor surgery that can cause distorted vision for two to four weeks. The pellets dissolve and deliver the anti-CMV drug directly into the eye for five to eight months, after which they can be replaced with new pellets.  People with CMV retinitis who use the pellets will most likely still need other CMV treatments to prevent CMV in other parts of the body. For full information about the drug cytovene in pellet, intravenous or capsule form contact Joy Schmitt at Hoffman-LaRoche at (201) 562-2202. For information about the pellets contact Missy Lowery at Chiron Vision at (800) 352-1891.</p>

<h3><a name="combo">Combining drugs better than taking AZT alone</a></h3>

<p>The most commonly prescribed anti-HIV treatment is the drug AZT (brand name Retrovir), although there are other readily available anti-HIV drugs including ddI (Videx), ddC (Hivid) and d4T (Zerit). In addition, the anti-HIV drug 3TC (lamivudine) has been given to over 30,000 people nationwide through a special Expanded Access program. Recently completed studies clearly show that taking AZT in combination with another anti-HIV drug such as ddI or ddC is better than taking AZT alone.</p>

<p><b>The DELTA Study</b> - This DELTA study included over 3,000 people. The participants had T cell counts between 50 and 350. The medications given were either AZT alone, AZT with ddI or AZT with ddC. The DELTA study was divided into two groups, DELTA 1 and DELTA 2.  About two thirds of the total participants in the DELTA study had never taken AZT before and made up the DELTA 1 group. In this group, combinations of AZT with ddI and AZT with ddC were much more effective than AZT taken alone at preventing new symptoms and death. The death rate in DELTA 1 in people taking the drug combinations was reduced by 38% (over a third) compared to people taking AZT alone. Participants in the DELTA 2 group had been taking AZT before. In this group, there were no significant differences between people taking AZT alone and people taking the drug combinations.  In both DELTA 1 and DELTA 2 groups, combination therapy was shown to be no more likely to cause serious side effects than taking AZT alone. In France, the results of the DELTA study have led the government to recommend that prescriptions for combination therapy be accepted at all hospitals.</p>

<p><b>The ACTG 175 Study</b> - The second combination therapy study (ACTG 175) was done in the U.S. and included 2,467 people with T cell counts between 200 and 500. People were followed by the researchers for an average of three years.  The people in this study were randomly assigned to one of four different treatments. One group took AZT alone. The second group took AZT with ddI. The third group took AZT with ddC. The fourth group took ddI alone. When the researchers looked at the study results overall, they found that both AZT with ddI and ddI alone were better than AZT alone at preventing an AIDS diagnosis or death. Unlike the DELTA study, the benefits of AZT with ddI or ddI alone were most clearly seen in people that had already been taking AZT. Because no one in the DELTA study took ddI alone, ACTG 175 leaves some unanswered questions about the benefits of ddI taken alone. The study did clearly show that taking a combination is better than taking AZT alone. A little less than half the people in ACTG 175 had never taken AZT before. There were not enough cases of people progressing to AIDS in this group to give a clear idea of what drug or combination of drugs works best for people who are starting anti-HIV therapy. The results of the DELTA study give a much clearer answer to this question. In the ACTG 175 study, AZT with ddI caused slightly more side effects than either AZT alone, ddI alone or AZT with ddC.</p>

<p><b>The Two Studies Together</b> - Many researchers and doctors feel that the results of the DELTA study give the best, most reliable proof of the benefits of combination therapy verus monotherapy. The reason for this is that very few people in the DELTA study dropped out or stopped taking their medications before the study finished. About half the people that started the ACTG 175 study had dropped out or stopped taking their medications before the study finished, which means that the results may not be as reliable as those from DELTA. The DELTA study clearly showed that people that haven't taken any anti-HIV therapies do better starting with combination therapy. In ACTG 175, people that had been taking AZT before did better taking AZT with ddI or taking ddI alone. Neither study was designed to find out when people should start anti-HIV therapy. However, it's encouraging that people in the DELTA study, who had T cells between 50 and 350, all seemed to benefit from combination therapy even if they already had symptoms or an AIDS diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>3TC and AZT</b> - More information from studies of AZT used in combination with 3TC is about to be released. It shows that increases in T cells and decreases in the amount of HIV in the blood have now lasted for up to two years in people in the study. 3TC is expected to be approved for prescription in the U.S. before the end of 1995. Federal reviewers (the FDA) are deciding for what uses the drug combination should be approved. 3TC is currently available through an expanded access program for people with less than 300 T cells. Doctors can call Glaxo-Wellcome at (800) 248-9757 for more information.</p>

<h3><a name="protease">New Protease Inhbitor Studies</a></h3>

<p>Protease inhibitors are a new class of anti-HIV drugs. They work by blocking a part of HIV called protease. When protease is blocked, HIV makes copies of itself that can't infect new cells. So far, protease inhibitors appear to be potent anti-HIV drugs.  Studies have shown that protease inhibitors can reduce the amount of virus in the blood and increase T4 cell counts. In some cases these drugs have improved T4 cell counts even when they were very low. Several different drug companies are testing different brands of protease inhibitors. Two new protease inhibitor studies are enrolling at Columbia Presbyterian in New York. The protease inhibitor is called saquinavir (also known as Invirase) and is made by a company called Hoffman-La Roche.</p>

<p><b>For people with T4 cells between 150 and 500</b> -  If you have between 150 and 500 T4 cells, and have not taken anti-HIV drugs before, you may be eligible for this study.  The drugs being studied are the protease inhibitor saquinavir in combination with AZT and 3TC. This study last four weeks. All participants can continue taking study medications after the trial is finished.</p>

<p><b>For people with T4 cells between 100 and 500</b> -  The second trial will study a new soft gelatin capsule formulation of saquinavir. The current hard gelatin capsule formulation is not very well absorbed by the body. It is hoped that the new soft gelatin capsule will be better absorbed. The study will compare the old and new formulations. You must have between 100-500 T cells to be in this study. Previous anti-HIV therapy is allowed. This study lasts four weeks. All participants can continue taking study medications after the trial is finished.</p>

<h3><a name="briefs">Treatment</a> Briefs</h3>

<p><b>Treatment for weight loss, tuberculosis and AIDS?</b></p> 

<p>The drug thalidomide, which is known to have led to the birth of hundreds of seriously deformed babies around the world, is now being tested as an anti-HIV drug, a weight loss treatment, an immune system regulator, a tuberculosis treatment supplement, and a treatment for microsporidiosis. It is also an effective sleeping pill. Recent studies have also shown thalidomide is  an effective treatment for aphthous ulcers, the painful sores that can form on the tongue and other tissues in the mouth (possibly as the result of taking an anti-HIV drug). This drug still has the potential to cause serious birth defects. The decision to use thalidomide obviously requires careful consideration, and consultation with a medical professional. There are currently four clinical trials for different uses (indications) now enrolling, and an Expanded Access program for the drug. Two buyers' clubs in the United States, PWA Health Group in New York City at (212) 255-0520 and the Healing Alternatives Foundation in San Francisco at (415) 626-4053 are importing the drug from Brazil where it is widely used for the treatment of leprosy. The Network has a Simple Fact Sheet about the drug, its possible uses, and how to get it (English or Spanish). Call the Network at (800) 734-7104 for the Simple Fact Sheet.</p>

<p><b>New Type of HIV Drug</b></p> 

<p>To block HIV's infection of new cells, a class of drugs called NNRTIs (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) is being developed. NNRTIs stop the reverse transcriptase which is the part of HIV required to make new virus and infect more cells. However, HIV has quickly developed resistance to the effects of the NNRTIs that are currently being studied. A new anti-HIV drug in this class, called HBY 097, is being studied at New York University Medical Center. Laboratory studies of HBY 097 suggest that HIV may weaken itself when it becomes resistant to HBY 097. This weakened HIV may not be as harmful to the body as normal HIV. The new study will last 12 weeks. To be eligible participants cannot have taken any anti-HIV drugs, and have T cell counts between 200 and 500. Study participants will be divided into three groups. One group will receive their assigned dose of HBY 097 alone. A second group will take their assigned dose of HBY 097 and AZT. A third group will take AZT alone. Neither the doctor nor the person taking part in the study will know which treatment is being taken. If you are interested in taking part in this study, call the Network at (800) 734-7104, or in New York City you can call (800) 448-2775.</p>

<p><b>Vitamin A type drug for Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)</b></p>

<p>Kaposi's sarcoma is a kind of cancer that can cause lesions or marks on the skin. It can sometimes also spread inside the body. Although no treatment is 100% effective at controlling this cancer, some treatments produce benefits. NYU Medical Center is studying a drug which is derived from vitamin A . The drug, 9-cis-retinoic acid, is similar to Retin-A, the drug commonly used for acne (pimples). 9-cis-retinoic acid is a  topical cream that is applied directly to KS lesions. It  will be given to all participants enrolled in the study.  Participants will apply the cream to their lesions twice a day for the first two weeks and then four times a day for the next two weeks.  If the cream is effective, participants may be permitted to remain on the study drug.  To be eligible for this trial, you cannot have systemic (inside your body) KS or be taking any other treatments for KS.</p>

<p><b>Herpesvirus treatment for KS</b></p>

<p>Foscarnet is currently approved for the treatment of a herpesvirus infection called CMV.  Because research has connected a type of herpesvirus to this cancer, foscarnet is now being studied as a treatment for KS.  In a recent issue of Treatment Review, we mentioned the possibility that the drug acyclovir, commonly and safely used for treating herpesviruses, may be useful for treating KS if it was actually caused by a herpesvirus. This doesn't appear to be the case, although the same study that determined this suggests that two herpesvirus drugs, foscarnet or ganciclovir, may be helpful.  Eligibility for this foscarnet study is limited to participants with early KS.  Participants will have had KS for no longer than six months and will have received no prior treatment for KS.  To apply for either of the studies described above call NYU Medical Center at (212) 263-6565, or The Network at (800) 734-7104.</p>

<p><b>Some good news about preventing PCP pneumonia</b></p>

<p>PCP pneumonia is a serious lung infection that people with less than 200 T cells can get. There are several different medications that can prevent PCP pneumonia. The most effective is Bactrim (also known as Septra). Bactrim is often given once a day, but a recent study done in Spain has shown that Bactrim can be given three times a week instead of once a day. The study found that the drug works just as well, and causes less side effects when taken only three times a week. Some of the side effects Bactrim can cause include: allergic reaction, rash, nausea, vomiting and a condition called neutropenia. Neutropenia is a low number of important white blood cells called neutrophils. The Spanish study confirms several previous small studies done in the US. In fact, many doctors are already using Bactrim three times a week. </p>

<p><b>New treatment for cryptosporidiosis</b> - Cryptosporidiosis is an infection of the gastrointestinal tract. The most common symptom is diarrhea along with cramping abdominal pain. A new trial at Cornell Medical Center in New York City is studying a drug called nitazoxanide (NTZ) for the treatment of this infection. For a referral call the Network at (800) 734-7104, or in New York City you can call (800) 448-2775.</p>

<p><b>New Trial for CMV Retinitis</b></p>

<p>CMV retinitis is a disease caused by a herpesvirus with which most people have been infected sometime during their lifetime. CMV retinitis can lead to blindness.  Only two treatments  are currently approved for this infection. A new study of CMV retinitis treatments is being conducted by the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG).  This trial will study the antibody MSL 109 given in combination with either foscarnet or ganciclovir, the two drugs currently approved for the treatment of CMV retinitis.  MSL 109 has fewer side effects than either ganciclovir or foscarnet and was tolerated well by participants in earlier studies.  MSL 109 is a human anti-CMV antibody that specifically targets CMV infection in the body.  It is believed that combining one of the standard treatments for CMV retinitis, ganciclovir or foscarnet, with the anti-CMV antibody will be a more effective treatment. Upon entry into the trial, all participants will be administered either ganciclovir or foscarnet through an IV tube.  Participants will then be given one dose of MSL 109 or a placebo also administered through an IV tube.  A second dose of MSL 109 or a placebo will be administered after two weeks. For a full description of this study or a referral to call The Network at (800) 734-7104.</p>

<p><b>MAC Prevention Increases Survival</b></p>

<p>MAC is a kind of bacterial infection that people with low T cell counts, usually under 50, can get.  Symptoms can include fever, weight loss and chronic diarrhea.  MAC can also affect many different areas in the body. Two recent studies have found that preventing MAC can help people live longer. One study followed people that had been taking the drug rifabutin to prevent MAC. After 18 months, those taking rifabutin had a 14% less risk of death than people not taking the drug. Another study of the new drug clarithromycin for MAC prevention also found that people taking the drug lived longer than people taking only a placebo (a dummy pill). Contact us and we'll send you the new MAC treatment and prevention guidelines. These guidelines can also be found on the Network's Internet home page at http://health.nyam.org:8000/public_html/network</p>

<p><b>Kids Studies</b></p>

<p>There is a great deal of excitement about a new type of drug called protease inhibitors. Kids have not been able to participate in treatment programs of this kind. Now, however, eligible kids may be able to join new studies at the National Cancer Institute. The protease inhibitors being studied are MK-639 (also known as Crixivan) and ritonavir (also known as ABT-538). For a full description of any of these studies, or a referral to the NCI, call The Network at (800) 734-7104. </p>

<p><b>Warts Treatment</b></p>

<p>A cream called imiquimod is being studied at New York University Medical Center as a new treatment for anal and genital warts. The cream stimulates the body to produce a substance called alpha-interferon where the cream is applied. Alpha-interferon is a natural substance called a cytokine that may help the body get rid of the warts. For a referral to this study, call the Network at (800) 734-7104, or in New York City call (800) 448-2775. </p>

<p><b>CMV Drug Approved</b></p>

<p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved oral ganciclovir as a preventive treatment for CMV disease. CMV is a herpesvirus that can become active when someone's T cell count gets low, usually under 50. It can cause a disease called CMV retinitis that can lead to blindness. In one 10 month study of 725 people with less than 100 T-cells, oral ganciclovir cut the rate of CMV disease from 30% to 16%, a reduction of about 50%. In this study CMV disease was measured by an eye doctor looking for CMV in the eye. Another recent study of this drug for CMV prevention did not find any benefit to the drug. However, in this study, CMV disease was measured by people reporting symptoms, and eye examinations were carried out by normal doctors not eye specialists. The decision whether to take oral ganciclovir for prevention of CMV is a difficult one. You should discuss your risk for CMV with your doctor. There is a possibility that if you develop CMV while taking oral ganciclovir the CMV will be harder to treat because of resistance. The company that makes the drug says that after 10 months of preventive treatment only 1 percent of people became resistant to ganciclovir. It is known that one person on the CMV prevention study developed CMV disease that could not be treated with any anti-CMV drug, including the experimental drug HPMPC (cidofovir).</p>

<p><b>Young Adults</b></p>

<p><b>New Treatment Guidelines</b></p>

<p>The US Public Health Service has issued new guidelines to assist health care providers and clinicians to prevent and treat a broad range of the infections that take advantage of a weakened immune system and can cause illness in  people with AIDS and HIV. These guidelines describe the symptoms that these different opportunistic infections can cause, as well as the more common treatments for them. The guidelines include infections such as PCP pneumonia, which is the most common AIDS-related infection. This condition is both treatable and preventable, and there are different treatment options available depending on how tolerant and responsive an individual is to these medications. In addition to PCP pneumonia, the guidelines also include less common but equally important infections such as toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis (TB), candidiasis (Thrush), and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). Several dozen infections altogether are included in the guidelines. For the complete guidelines, which are free of charge, call the CDC AIDS Clearinghouse at (800) 458-5231.

<H4><A NAME="protease">Protease Inhibitors</A></H4><P>

Protease inhibitors are a new type of anti-HIV drug. Protease inhibitors are meant to inhibit, or block, a piece of HIV's machinery called protease. When this protease is blocked, HIV makes defective copies of itself. Protease inhibitors are different from nucleoside analogues (AZT, ddC, ddI, d4T, and 3TC) in a number of ways. They are more specific in what they do. Protease inhibitors block infected cells from producing new virus, while drugs like AZT cannot prevent the production of new virus. Because of their specific activity, protease inhibitors most likely do less damage to cells than nucleoside analogues. <P>

Studies have shown that protease inhibitors reduce the amount of HIV virus that is measurable in the blood. In some cases, protease inhibitors have increased T4 cell counts even when they were low. These results have encouraged two drug companies that make protease inhibitors to start long-anticipated treatment programs for people with low T4 cell counts. <P>

Most researchers believe that any protease inhibitor will need to be taken with one or more other drugs such as 3TC (an AZT- like drug expected to be approved by the FDA very shortly) to get the most benefit. It is also believed that protease inhibitor monotherapy - taking one protease inhibitor at a time - won't produce the best results, but no clinical studies are presently testing any protease inhibitor combinations. Testing one protease inhibitor at a time may, however, get at least one or more of them approved more quickly. <P>

Studies have shown that, in some cases, the beneficial effects of protease inhibitors used alone quickly wear off, most likely due to the development of resistance. Resistance occurs because HlV makes billions of copies of itself every day. Each new HIV virus that gets made is slightly different, which means that the protease part of the virus might be slightly different, too. This new kind of protease may not be affected by a drug meant to stop the old kind of protease. Signs of resistance have already been seen in people taking all three of the protease inhibitors that are currently in the final stretch of development. Test tube studies have also shown that newer protease inhibitors like Agouron's AG1343 may not be effective in people who have developed resistance to other protease inhibitors. No one yet agrees on the extent or significance of resistance, but there are different opinions.<P>

Many questions about protease inhibitor are still unanswered. Despite concerns about resistance, this class of drugs could be a promising treatment for HIV- infected people. Combining two or more protease inhibitors, or combining them with other anti-HIV drugs may slow down the development of resistance. Protease inhibitors are still experimental drugs. The more data that is collected from people who are actually taking them alone or in combinations, the more answers we'll be able to provide.<P>

<H4><A NAME="crix">Merck Expanded Access Program</A></H4><P>

A new program for people with less than 50 T4 cells has been announced. Register before August 11, 1995 to be considered for Crixivan, the protease inhibitor made by a drug company called Merck. Registration is by calling 1.800.497.8383. You can call between 8 a.m. and 11p.m., 7 days a week, in English or Spanish. Due to limited supplies of the drug, if more than 1,100 people apply before that date, a lottery will be necessary to determine who gets to participate. <P>

To participate in this program you must be at least 18 years old, and have less than 50 T4 cells. You can be taking, or already have taken 3TC, d4T, ddI, ddC or AZT, alone or in combination. You must have a platelet count greater than 50,000. You cannot have acute hepatitis, and you cannot be pregnant . You are not permitted to take any other another protease inhibitor during the study.<P>

Other required blood values include: hemoglobin greater than 6.5; absolute neutrophil count greater than 500; creatinine less than 6 times the upper limit of normal; and blood urea nitrogen less than ten times the upper limit of normal.<P>

You must also live in the United States and have an address where you can be reached by mail. (Someone else can register for you, and even can receive mail for you if you give your permission for them to do so.) <P>

Anyone not selected will be placed on a waiting list in case some of the selected people decide not to take part in the study. The study may also be expanded to include those on the waiting list as more drug becomes available. <P>

<H4><A NAME="prot2">Another Option for under 50 T4 Cells</A></H4><P>

Crixivan is also being studied in a clinical trial. Like the expanded access program, less than 50 T4 cells are required to participate in this program. The trial will study 3 different drugs in combination and alone for the treatment of HIV infection. The drugs are Crixivan (MK-639), AZT and 3TC. You must have taken and tolerated AZT for more than 6 months at the standard dose to be eligible to participate. Participants will be divided into three groups. The first group will take AZT and 3TC. The second group will take the protease inhibitor. The third group will take all three study drugs together.<P>

There is also a special, open label arm of this study for people who can't take AZT, have used AZT for less than six months, or have taken 3TC before. <P>

<H4><A NAME="cmv">CMV Treatment</A></H4><P>

CMV retinitis is a condition caused by a herpesvirus called cytomegalovirus (CMV). It can affect many parts of the body. When it affects one or both eyes, it's called CMV retinitis. CMV retinitis usually causes blindness if left untreated. Treatment should start as soon as the disease is detected. Treatment does not cure the disease, but does usually get it under control for several months or longer. Two drugs are approved to treat this condition: ganciclovir (Cytovene) and foscarnet (Foscavir). <P>

Both treatments are given by intravenous infusion. Both drugs require a catheter. A catheter is a small tube that is placed in a vein. This allows the drug to easily go into the vein. It also avoids having to find a new vein every time the drug needs to be given. Sometimes a catheter is placed in the arm. Powerful drugs like ganciclovir and foscarnet, however, can wear out the veins in the arm, so almost everyone who needs to take these drugs on an ongoing basis gets a permanent catheter. <P>

Researchers are looking for treatments for CMV retinitis that aren't so demanding to take. A pill form of ganciclovir was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for maintenance treatment of CMV retinitis. It is expected that this pill will also be approved for the prevention of CMV. <P>

Studies have also shown that ganciclovir implants - small pellets of drug that are placed directly into the eye during a typically uncomplicated surgical procedure - are effective at treating CMV retinitis, although they are still being investigated. At this point it appears that the pellets only need to be inserted about once every six months - an obvious benefit over daily infusions. <P>

One very important reason clinical trials are conducted is to determine the safety of a drug, including what side effects a drug might cause in the short and long term. Only one in ten experimental drugs makes it through the clinical trial process because testing shows that the drug is too toxic, or has other problems. Yet, many drugs used to treat cancer (chemotherapy) have well known toxicities. The FDA approves them, doctors prescribe them, and people with cancer are sometimes cured by them. <P>

The seriousness of the problem for which the drug is being tested, such as life- threatening cancers or potentially fatal AIDS-related opportunistic infections, gives researchers license to push toxicity limits. Although few patients are eager to tolerate harsh or severe side effects, some are willing to tolerate the side effects if the benefit is great enough. There are also sometimes ways to lessen or eliminate the side effects of drugs. When foscarnet was first approved there were very real concerns about kidney toxicity. Doctors are often able to reduce possible side effects, however, by first giving infusions of saline solution (salt water) to hydrate the kidneys.<P>

<H4><A NAME="hpmpc">Cidofovir (HPMPC)</A></H4><P>

The drug cidofovir, also known as HPMPC, is now in clinical trials. In earlier studies, this drug caused kidney damage (renal toxicity). It also demonstrated strong activity against CMV, for an extended period of time. When the effect of the first infusion wears off - in about 7 days - the second infusion appears to have the same effect, and last the same amount of time. At this point it is not known whether the drug actually ever stops working against CMV. Both foscarnet and ganciclovir eventually stop working, and CMV progresses after about 6 months. <P>

The first studies of cidofovir indicate that the best way to give the drug is once a week. The new study that is described below will give the drug once a week for the first two weeks, then once every two weeks. If this turns out to be an effective way to give this drug, it would certainly be more convenient and less invasive than the usual once or twice a day infusions of the already approved drugs. <P>

To participate in this trial you must have failed previous treatment. Requirements for failing previous treatment vary according to the location of the CMV infection in your eye. All participants are treated with cidofovir. After the two week induction period, participants are randomized to 2 different doses. Treatment is once a week for 2 weeks and once every other week after that. Clinic visits may require two days of visits, all outpatient. All participants receive probenicid and saline hydration at the same time. Probenicid helps protect the liver from possible side effects due to treatment with cidofovir. Probenicid is a pill. Cidofovir is given by intravenous infusion.<P>

To participate, you must be 18 years or older with CMV retinitis that has progressed while on foscarnet or ganciclovir for at least a 4 week period. You may not have been treated with ganciclovir or foscarnet within 2 days of starting the study. You may not have ever been treated with cidofovir. You must do a one week washout from anti-CMV investigational agents. If you have an intravitrial implant with ganciclovir, the implant will have to be taken out before starting the study. For more information about this study, or the treatment or prevention of CMV, call The Network at (800) 734-7104.<P>

Although there is no guarantee that the drug cidofovir will not cause side effects, researchers and some people with AIDS support the continued testing of this drug because it holds great promise. By adding the drug probenicid to the study, researchers hope that the kidneys will not be damaged. This drug has been used for this purpose with other drugs.<P>

<H4>Treatment Briefs</H4><P>

<a NAME="fos"><B>New Use For Foscarnet</B></A> - The drug foscarnet has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating herpes infections that are resistant to the standard treatment, acyclovir (also known as Zovirax). Herpes infections include herpes simplex, which can cause nerve pain and sores around the mouth and genitals, and herpes zoster (commonly known as shingles), which causes painful lesions on the body. <P>

Up until now foscarnet was only been approved for the treatment of one specific kind of herpesvirus infection called CMV retinitis. It has been commonly used to treat other herpesvirus infections that haven't responded to acyclovir. <P>

The Network has heard from people in the past that have had to go into hospital to get foscarnet treatment for their acyclovir-resistant herpes infections, because their insurance wouldn't pay for the drug otherwise. Now that the drug has full approval for acyclovir-resistant herpes, people in this situation will be able to receive treatment at home.<P>

<A NAME="alben"><B>Albendazole Correction</B></A> - Gargoyles slipped into our printer's shop and changed the number we had listed for the compassionate use program for the drug albendazole. This drug is available through a compassionate use program for the treatment of microsporidiosis. The right number is (800) 877-7074, extension 3909. <P>

<A NAME="$"><B>$ for Young Adults Study</B></A> - A new information gathering study called Teams Linking Care (TLC) has opened. This project focuses on improving the health and quality of life of 14 to 23 year olds. Young adults meet in small groups with others living with HIV or AIDS, and also meet individually for interviews every three months. TLC pays you $20 each time you complete an interview and $10 for each group session you attend. The three parts of the group meetings are: Staying Healthy, Acting Safe, and Keeping Up. Each series is 12 two hour group sessions held weekly with a three month break between series. Younger people will also be considered. Groups are conducted in Spanish and English.<P>

<A NAME="dana"><B>Dana Consortium</B></A> - This error was our fault. In last month's issue of Treatment Review, the article about the vitamin E-like drug on the front page mistakenly referred to the Dana Farber Institute. This trial for a treatment for HIV-related dementia is part of the Dana Consortium, a university consortium devoted to investigating treatments for AIDS Dementia Complex. The Dana Consortium is not related to the Dana Farber Institute in any way, and we apologize for the misprint.<P>

<A NAME="3tc"><B>3TC Expanded Access Program Changes Again</B></A> - The experimental anti-HIV drug 3TC has been available through an expanded access program for some time now. 3TC is a nucleoside analog like the other approved anti-HIV drugs AZT, ddI, ddC and d4T. Studies seem to indicate that it has less side effects than the approved drugs, and works particularly well in combination with other anti- HIV drugs.Doctors have been able to obtain the drug for their patients directly from the company that makes it, Glaxo Wellcome. Due to problems with drug supply, the entry criteria for this program were recently restricted so that only people with under 100 T cells could be enrolled, and a maximum of 350 people could enter the program each week. Glaxo Wellcome has now announced that as of August 15th, 1995 people with less than 300 T cells can ask their doctor to enroll them in the program by calling 1.800.248.9757. The number of people that can be enrolled each week has also been increased to 650.<P>

<A NAME="d4t"><B>Good Results for Stavudine (d4T)</B></A> - In June, 1994 the FDA approved the drug d4T, a nucleoside analogue similar to 3TC, AZT, ddI, and ddC. A randomized trial comparing AZT and d4T, the preliminary results of which were originally presented to the FDA for approval, was recently concluded and presented along with data from the d4T parallel track program. In the first study, participants who took d4T developed fewer opportunistic infections and sustained T-cell counts over those who continued on AZT. This benefit has not been seen in clinical trials involving a switch from AZT to ddI or ddC. Quality of life was also improved in participants who switched to d4T. In terms of side effects, the rate of peripheral neuropathy was higher in participants who switched to d4T, whereas the rate of anemia and neutropenia was higher in participants who remained on AZT. <P>

The open label parallel track trial in 12,551 participants compared a dose of 40 mg. twice daily of d4T to a lower dose of 20 mg. twice daily. The trial concluded that both doses are safe and that the higher dose is slightly superior to the lower dose in prolonging survival. Increased weight and fewer hospitalizations were also seen in the higher dose. More data will be required to learn more about the effectiveness in HIV+ people who have no previous AZT therapy. Furthermore, the impact of d4T on viral load and the possibilities of combination therapy will also need to be studied further.<P>

<H4><A NAME="protein">Nutrition study pays</A></H4><P>

An information gathering study that looks at the way the body uses protein has 
just one spot left for someone to enroll. The study is taking place at 
NYU/Cornell. No drugs are given in this study. To participate you must be HIV+ 
and weight stable. You will be randomly assigned to either a normal or 
restricted protein diet. There are two dietary periods during the study. Each 
dietary period lasts for 5 days, during which time you will be in the hospital. You 
will receive $200 per dietary period.<P> 

<H4><A NAME="vitamin">Vitamin E Drug</A></H4><P>

The Dana Farber Institute has been sponsoring an information gathering study 
about HIV-related dementia. They have now added a vitamin E-like compound, 
OPC-14117. This drug may protect nerve cells from damage due to HIV 
infection. Two of the sites conducting this study will add this drug to see if it 
treats changes in thinking associated with HIV infection. To participate, you 
must be HIV+, 18 years or older, and experiencing problems with short term 
memory, concentration, and feeling slowed down. If you're taking antiretrovirals, 
you must be on an unchanged dose for 6 weeks or more. You cannot have a 
seizure disorder, opportunistic infection of the central nervous system, serious 
liver or kidney dysfunction, Kaposi's sarcoma requiring systemic chemotherapy, 
or take more than 2 drinks of alcohol per day. You cannot be getting 
chemotherapy for any malignancy.<P> 
Participants will be divided into two groups. 
One group will take the study drug. The other group will take a placebo. For the 
first 12 weeks neither the participant nor the doctor will know which treatment is 
being given. After that, open-label drug will be provided for 12 weeks. 
Seventeen clinic visits are required during the 24 weeks of the study. A stipend 
is provided for the first visit, and to cover transportation costs for following visits. 
Clinic visits will include tests for neurological, neuropsychological, medical and 
functional status.<P>


<H4><A NAME="protease">New protease inhibitor studies</A></H4><P>

Several new studies of the Merck protease inhibitor, now called MK-639, are 
enrolling. To participate in any of these studies you must have blood test results 
that are within a normal range. The results of a test for indirect bilirubin is 
especially important. Indirect bilirubin is a common blood test that gives an idea 
of the health of your liver. Several Network members who would otherwise have 
been eligible for the MK-639 protease inhibitor study were not enrolled because 
they had a history of elevated indirect bilirubin tests. Because the only real side 
effects seen with MK-639 so far have been associated with an increase in 
indirect bilirubin, the principal investigators of the trial are very closely reviewing 
everyone who is screened for these studies. If you have a history of elevated 
indirect bilirubin you will not be allowed to participate. The researchers have 
been willing to consider people if other blood values were slightly outside of the 
required range. Retesting sometimes shows that the values do fit the study 
requirements. The three new MK-639 studies are:<P>

<B>A study of MK-639 and AZT</B>. Participants will be divided into 3 groups. The first 
group will take MK-639 alone. The second group takes AZT alone. The third 
group takes both drugs together. You must be HIV+, 18 years or older, and have 
a T4 cell count of 50 to 500. You cannot have an active opportunistic infection. 
Pregnant women or nursing mothers are not allowed. You cannot be intolerant 
to AZT, or have ever taken any protease inhibitor. You cannot have taken any of 
the nucleoside analogues - AZT, ddI, ddC, d4T - for more than 2 weeks.<P> 

<B>A study of AZT, 3TC and MK-639</B>. Participants will be divided into three groups. 
The first takes AZT and 3TC. The second group takes MK-639 alone. The third 
group takes all three drugs together. To participate you must be HIV+, 18 years 
or older, and have a T4 cell count of between 50 to 400. You must have taken 
and tolerated AZT at 600 milligrams for six or more months. Pregnant women 
and nursing mothers are not allowed. You cannot be hepatitis B surface antigen 
positive, or have ever taken 3TC or any protease inhibitor. Chronic therapy for 
an opportunistic infection and other drugs are not allowed. Although this study 
has already filled up quickly, it's possible that everyone on the list will not 
qualify . You will be called if this is the case.<P>

<B>A study of AZT, 3TC and MK-639 in people with under 50 T4 cells</B>. Participants 
will be divided into three groups. The first group will take AZT and 3TC. The 
second group will take MK-639. The third group will take all three study drugs 
together. Those who cannot take AZT or 3TC will be assigned to receive open-
label MK-639. To participate in this study, you must be HIV+, 18 years or older, 
and have taken and tolerated AZT for more than 6 months at the standard dose. 
Pregnant women and nursing mothers are not allowed. You cannot be hepatitis 
B surface antigen positive, or have ever taken 3TC or a protease inhibitor. 
Ongoing therapy for an opportunistic infection, and other drugs which the study 
coordinator will go over with you are also not allowed. This trial is not expected 
to start before June. You may be able to get on a waiting list now.<P>

<H4><A NAME="know">What we know about anti-HIV drugs</A></H4><P>


Since AIDS was first identified, the average time that people live after their 
AIDS diagnosis has more than doubled. It is not yet clear how much of this 
improvement is due to anti-HIV drugs, however AIDS treatment does seem to 
be improving. By carefully monitoring blood work, taking drugs to prevent and/or 
treat AIDS-related infections, and by working with a doctor to decide on the right 
anti-HIV drugs to take, someone who is living with AIDS today can probably 
improve their chances of living a longer and healthier life.<P>

There are three kinds of drugs used to treat people with HIV/AIDS: antiretroviral 
drugs, drugs to treat and prevent opportunistic diseases, and therapies that treat 
specific symptoms of AIDS, such as wasting or anemia. Antiretroviral drugs 
block reproduction of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.<P>

The HIV virus is a complicated virus, known as a retrovirus. It contains two 
copies of RNA, which can be thought of as a blueprint for making new viruses. It 
also has protein spikes called gp120 on its surface. gp120 is used by the virus 
to bind with a protein on immune system cells in order to permit HIV to infect 
those cells. The viral RNA is then injected into the cell where it is converted to 
DNA. DNA is the main way the body stores information to make new cells. The 
conversion of RNA into DNA is accomplished by an enzyme called reverse 
transcriptase. Available antiviral drugs all work by blocking this enzyme, and 
thereby preventing the virus from infecting new cells.<P>

In clinical trials or studies to determine whether these drugs work, researchers 
look at three different things: how long people live while taking the drug, 
whether the drug can keep them from getting sick, and whether the drug can 
improve markers of disease and immunity in their blood. At this time there are 
five available drugs to treat HIV. Each drug has several names, which can be 
confusing. They are called AZT (Retrovir), ddI (Videx), ddC (Hivid), d4T (Zerit), 
and 3TC (lamivudine).<P>

<B>AZT</B><P>

AZT is the drug most frequently used to treat HIV disease. AZT is usually given 
as pills, and people often take 600 mg every day. This means they will take six 
pills, split up into either two pills three times a day, or three pills two times a day. 
A new time-released version, called AZTEC, is being tested in clinical trials 
now. AZTEC reduces the number of pills that need to be taken.<P>

In a study looking at the effects of the drug in very sick people over the short 
term, AZT appeared to delay death.<P>

Researchers then tried to give AZT to healthier people with HIV to see if the 
drug would delay the development of serious AIDS-related infections. Two early 
studies suggested that AZT did help people maintain health. People taking AZT 
developed fewer infections than people who were taking the placebo. A 
placebo is a sugar pill used for comparison to see how well the treatment works.<P>

However, two more recent studies have cast some doubt on the usefulness of 
AZT in delaying the onset of AIDS. A study by the Veterans Administration found 
that, while AZT could slow the rate at which HIV-infected persons got AIDS-
related infections, the drug did not make people live longer than people who 
were taking the placebo. More recently, the Concorde Study was a large study 
of early treatment with AZT. It also found that, while early AZT could slightly 
reduce AIDS-related infections, the drug did not extend life.<P>

People with HIV are sometimes prescribed to take several AIDS drugs at once. 
This is called combination therapy.<P>

When AZT was first used to treat AIDS, people were commonly given very high 
doses of the drug. Side effects were common and severe, including nausea, 
vomiting, headache, muscle wasting and anemia. While these side effects are 
sometimes seen in people taking only 600mg of AZT per day, they are much 
less frequent, and usually less severe.<P>

AZT is also used to treat dementia which affects some people with AIDS, and a 
blood disorder called thrombocytopenia, which means low levels of the cells 
that allow blood to clot.<P>

Recently, an important study showed that pregnant women treated with AZT 
were only one-third as likely to pass HIV on to their babies as women who didn't 
take AZT. In another study, children taking AZT alone did not do as well as 
those taking a combination of AZT and ddI or ddI by itself. ddI is described 
below.<P>

AZT does not work forever. HIV is capable of changing rapidly, or mutating. This 
allows the virus to escape the antiviral effects of AZT. Test-tube studies show 
that, in most people, HIV is largely resistant to AZT within six months of 
beginning treatment. Resistance means the virus is no longer affected by the 
drug. However, the usefulness of the drug in delaying disease seems to last 
longer than six months. Most doctors monitor their patients' blood, as well as 
their overall health status, to determine when AZT is no longer working.<P>

<B>ddI</B><P>

ddI works in the same way as AZT. Early studies showed the drug raises levels 
of T-cells, an important type of immune cell that some researchers use to 
determine if a treatment is working.<P>

A later study showed that, in people who'd never taken antiviral drugs to treat 
HIV, AZT was better than ddI at keeping people healthy and alive. In people 
who'd taken AZT for up to eight weeks, ddI was as good as AZT at keeping 
people alive and healthy. In people who'd taken AZT for more than sixteen 
weeks, ddI was better than AZT.<P>

ddI usually comes in the form of a large, flavored tablet that can be chewed or 
dissolved in water, or in a powder that gets dissolved in water. Because food 
can slow down the body's absorption of ddI, people should not eat for one hour 
before taking ddI, or for two hours after. The proper dose is based on the 
person's body weight, and so the number of tablets taken each day may 
depend on the individual. Generally, people are told to take two doses, one in 
the morning, and one in the evening.<P>

One possible side effect of ddI is called peripheral neuropathy. The main 
symptom is a painful burning sensation in the hands and feet. People taking ddI 
may also develop swelling of an organ called the pancreas. If pancreatitis isn't 
caught soon enough, it can be deadly. Careful monitoring of a specific blood 
enzyme called amylase can provide warning of pancreatitis. A drug called 
pentamidine, which is often used to prevent an AIDS-related pneumonia called 
PCP, can also cause pancreatitis. People taking ddI should not use 
pentamidine at the same time. ddI may also cause diarrhea or nausea.<P>

<B>ddC</B><P>

ddC is another antiretroviral that works in the same way as AZT. As a single 
drug, ddC is less effective than AZT in delaying illness and death in people 
who've never taken antiviral treatment for HIV infection. In people who'd already 
taken AZT for a long time, ddC was about as effective as ddI in delaying illness 
and death.<P>

ddC is given in the form of a tablet. People usually take three tablets per day, 
along with six AZT pills. It is important that people with ddC see their doctor 
regularly to monitor blood work for toxicity, and report immediately if they feel 
any signs of neuropathy.<P>

ddC is mostly used in combination with AZT after a person has begun to show 
signs of immune-system damage after taking AZT for a long time. The 
combination of these two drugs can raise T-cells better than either drug alone, 
however it is not clear whether or not they can delay illness and death better 
than single-drug treatment. One large study suggested that combination therapy 
was no better than single-drug treatment at delaying illness and death, but 
some researchers believe that healthier people may respond better to the 
combination.<P>

The main side effect of ddC treatment is peripheral neuropathy. After people 
stop taking ddC, their peripheral neuropathy will usually go away, but it can take 
weeks and even months. Also, peripheral neuropathy may continue to get 
worse for a little while after ddC treatment is stopped. ddC also causes 
pancreatitis in a very few people and, possibly, severe mouth sores.<P>

<B>d4T</B><P>

d4T, also known as Zerit or stavudine, is similar to other approved drugs. Early 
studies have shown that d4T can produce small increases in T-cell levels, 
although no decreases in virus levels were seen.<P>

The main side effect of d4T is peripheral neuropathy. In a large study, 
comparing high-dose d4T (80mg/day) to low-dose d4T (40mg/day) in people 
with AIDS, 21% of participants taking high-dose d4T developed peripheral 
neuropathy, while only 15% of those taking low-dose d4T developed 
neuropathy. There was no improvement in rates of disease or death on high-
dose treatment as compared to low-dose treatment.<P>

Ongoing studies are expected to produce more information about the ability of 
d4T to delay illness and death.<P>

<B>3TC</B><P>

3TC, also known as lamivudine, is an experimental anti-HIV treatment that is 
related to other anti-HIV drugs. 3TC is available to people with AIDS who have 
less than 100 T-cells, or children with less than 300 T-cells, who have taken 
AZT, ddI, ddC and d4T. Early studies have suggested that 3TC may raise T-cell 
levels, and lower levels of HIV. More importantly, studies have suggested that 
3TC treatment in combination with AZT may make AZT work more effectively, 
even in people who have already taken AZT for a long time.<P>

3TC is given in tablets, and people may take either one tablet twice a day, or 
two tablets once a day. It is not yet known which dose is better. Studies are now 
underway to determine whether or not 3TC will delay disease and death. The 
drug is expected to be approved for sale within the next year.<P>

<H4><A NAME="virus">Measuring the Virus</A></H4><P>

T4 cells are an important part of the immune system. When the number of T4 
cells decreases, the chances that someone who is HIV-positive will develop an 
AIDS-related opportunistic infection or cancer increases. Yet , T4 cells have 
proven to be a poor way to measure whether a treatment will produce clinical 
benefits, such as weight gain or improvement in symptoms.<P> 

Researchers are still looking for a good marker or group of markers that help 
clinicians and people with HIV to make appropriate decisions about what 
treatments they should or should not take. Measurements of the amount of virus 
in the blood may be a useful tool that will help make these decisions.<P> 

Two new tests measure the amount of HIV in the blood, sometimes called the 
viral load. Both of these tests are done by taking a blood sample, then 
performing tests on this blood in a laboratory. The blood is discarded after it is 
measured. It is not returned to the person from whom it was taken.<P> 

One test, called the branched DNA or bDNA test, is made by a company called 
Chiron. The other is the polymerase chain reaction or PCR test made by 
Hoffman-LaRoche. The two tests measure what's called HIV RNA. RNA is the 
part of HIV that knows how to make more virus. Scientists have a good idea 
what some parts of HIV RNA look like. By creating a mirror image and matching it against what they find in someone's blood, they can find HIV RNA.<P> 

The PCR test encourages the HIV RNA to make more of itself so that it's easier to measure, then works out how much HIV RNA must have been there in the first place. The bDNA test sets off a chemical reaction with the HIV RNA so it gives out light. Then the amount of light is measured in order to show how much RNA was found.<P> 

The number of copies of HIV RNA in the blood can go from less than 10 into the 
hundreds of thousands. Studies have shown that the amount of virus in the 
blood increases as someone gets sicker. Some treatments can reduce the 
amount of virus in the blood. Whether this will improve someone's health isn't 
clear, because studies haven't been done that prove this.<P> 

The results of these tests are usually given per milliliter (ml) of blood, like the T4 
cell count. The PCR test may give the amount per 0.05/ml, so you need to 
multiply the number by 20 to get the standard result. Each virus carries two 
copies of RNA. If there are 100,000 copies of HIV RNA, that means 50,000 
viruses (often called particles or virions) are present. Currently, the bDNA test 
can't find less than 10,000 copies of HIV RNA, but a recent improvement means 
it will soon be able to find anything down to 500 copies.<P>

Test results can be different when repeated on the same blood sample. This is 
called variability. Any test results should say how variable the test might be. For 
example if the result was 20,000 copies and the variability of the test was 5,000, 
you'd know that the result was somewhere between 15,000 and 25,000 copies.<P>

Researchers hope these tests will help show if an anti-HIV treatment is working. 
They also hope the amount of virus in the blood may indicate if someone should 
start or change to a different anti-HIV treatment. Some doctors feel that there is 
already early evidence that reducing the viral load will improve health. Others 
point out that there is a lot of virus in other places in the body, not just the blood. 
Only 2% of HIV is in circulating blood. The rest is in your lymph system and 
other body tissue. Also, measuring the good effect an anti-HIV treatment has on 
the viral load doesn't take into account any bad side-effects the treatment might 
have on the body.<P>

Currently, these tests are still experimental. Doctors can order them, at a cost of 
about 200 dollars. However, it's hard to get an insurance company to pay for 
them. Medicaid will not cover them. Some research studies measure viral load, 
but people in the study may not always be able to see the results. If you're 
thinking of joining a study and want to know the results, ask the study 
coordinator if you will be able to get copies.<P> 

It is expected that researchers will soon have a better idea of what these tests 
mean. Until then it seems a good idea to be cautious when looking at any 
results of these tests. The labs that do the tests can be asked to provide a chart 
showing the first test result and any changes over time. This may give extra 
information about a persons health. It will require further studies to show how 
this information should be used when thinking about treatment.<P>

<H4><A NAME="il2">About Interleukin-2</A></H4><P>

Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a chemical messenger. It is one of many different kinds of 
chemicals that the body produces to allow cells to communicate with each 
other. It is a cytokine. IL-2 may help boost the immune system by causing T4 
cells to proliferate, or increase in numbers. Although this would seem like a 
good thing - most researchers agree that T4 cells are a good way to estimate 
disease progression - it is not yet known whether the T4 cells that are created 
by using Il-2 are useful. In other words, the body may be making T4 cells that 
don't work. Someone who had 300 or 400 T4 cells after taking Il-2 might still be 
at risk of developing PCP pneumonia, for example, if they still only really had 
less than 200 T4 cells that actually worked. This has already been reported.<P> 

Il-2 is an approved drug, but not for the treatment of AIDS or HIV-related 
conditions. People who participated in clinical trials of the drug at high doses 
experienced severe side effects. Il-2 does not appear to work in people with 
less than 200 T4 cells, and also causes HIV to multiply at a faster rate. Although 
there are indications that this increase in HIV growth eventually slows down, 
there are no long term studies that describe what effect this may have on HIV 
progression in the long term. Anyone who is using IL-2 is cautioned that HIV 
growth definitely increases when using the drug. Researchers suggest taking at 
least one, if not several antiretroviral drugs when using this drug.<P> 

Researchers are now studying low dose IL-2 given by subcutaneous injection 
(a shot given under the skin). If this method works, it would be safer and more 
convenient than intravenous treatment, which is how the drug is usually given to 
people with kidney cancer. One New York City doctor suggests that it might be 
possible to restore normal immune system functioning if someone's T4 cells 
could be raised enough by administering Il-2. There are no controlled studies to 
back this up at this time.<P> 

Interleukin-2 also causes an increase in another cytokine called tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF). This is a naturally occurring chemical produced by cells, although 
people with HIV may have too much of this in their blood. One of the normal 
functions of TNF is to get rid of cancerous cells in the body. TNF is thought to be 
responsible for an increase in HIV growth. At one time, TNF was tested as a 
treatment for AIDS. The results were not good.<P>

An increase in TNF levels may be one of several reasons Il-2 causes HIV to 
multiply rapidly. In fact, several drugs such as thalidomide are currently being 
tested as anti-HIV treatments because they are believed to lower TNF levels. An 
anti-TNF drug, and an antibody that will hopefully attach to TNF and render it 
harmless, are also being studied as an HIV treatment. These two drugs are 
being studied in combination with Il-2 in a new study at the NIH.<P> 

Three new studies are taking place at the National Institutes of Health in 
Bethesda, MD. The NIH is taking names for their studies. Because they are 
getting so many calls, they may take a few weeks to get back to you, but your 
calls will be returned in the order in which they're received. After your phone 
screening, if you are accepted for an interview and physical exam, you pay your 
way to Bethesda the first time. If you are accepted onto the study, the NIH pays 
for any trips necessary after that. You cannot have AIDS or have previously 
been treated with IL-2 to participate in any of these studies. Pregnant women 
and nursing mothers are not allowed.<P> 

The other new Il-2 study is taking place at several sites around the United 
States, including New York City. If you are interested in participating in any of 
the four new Il-2 studies call The Network at (800) 734-7104 for more 
information.<P> 

<B>Il-2, Thalidomide and Anti-TNF Mab</B><P>

This study will compare IL-2 alone to Il-2 in combination with an anti-TNF 
monoclonal antibody to Il-2 in combination with thalidomide for the treatment of 
HIV infection in people with 200-500 T4 cells. All participants will receive IL-2 by 
continuous IV infusion for 5 days approximately every 8 weeks. One group will 
also take anti-TNF monoclonal antibody. The second group will also take 
thalidomide. The third group will take only IL-2. To participate you must have 
been on current treatment with a stable regimen of an approved antiretroviral 
therapy for at least two weeks. Treatment is for one year.<P> 

<B>Subcutaneous Il-2 injections</B><P>

Another trial will study subcutaneous injections of IL-2 for the treatment of HIV 
infection in people with over 500 T4 cells. All participants will be treated with IL-
2 twice a day for a five day period, either every month or every other month. 
Dose varies between treatment groups. Participants will be hospitalized for the 
first week of treatment. Following treatments can be done on an outpatient 
basis. You must be taking an approved antiretroviral for at least six weeks 
before starting the study. Treatment is for six months.<P> 

<B>Intravenous Il-2</B><P>

The third trial will study intravenous IL-2 for the treatment of HIV infection in 
people with 200-500 T4 cells. Participants will be divided into three groups. The 
first group will receive 5 day infusions of IL-2 every 8 weeks. The other groups 
will be treated at different times and doses. The first cycle will be done as an 
inpatient. Other cycles may be on an outpatient basis. You must be willing to 
take an antiretroviral therapy.<P>

<B>Subcutaneous Il-2 injections</B><P>

One trial that is studying IL-2 for the treatment of HIV infection in asymptomatic 
individuals is looking for participants with T4 cell counts between 200 and 500. 
All participants will be treated with IL-2. Participants will shown how to give 
themselves shots and will take IL-2 daily. All participants must remain on 
antiretroviral treatment for the entire study. The antiretroviral can be AZT, ddI, 
ddC, d4T or 3TC, alone or in combination. Clinic visits for weekly physicals and 
labs are required. To participate in the trial, you must be HIV+, 18 years or older, 
and have been on antiretroviral treatment for at least one month. You cannot 
have an uncontrolled infection, any cardiac condition that cannot be controlled 
by medication, any CNS or psychiatric illness uncontrolled by medication, 
evidence of malignancy, or a history of asthma requiring routine use of 
bronchodilators. You may not be taking corticosteroids or immune modulating 
agents such as interferon, pentoxyfylline or thalidomide.<P>

<H4><A NAME="steroids">Anabolic Steroids</A></H4><P>

Muscles need protein to stay healthy and to grow. The human body naturally 
produces its own muscle building and maintenance aids called anabolic 
steroids. There are different kinds of steroids and growth hormones in the body.<P> 

Anabolic steroids are recognized by their function of building up tissues and 
muscles. Synthetically made anabolic steroids, available by prescription or in 
research studies, may be useful as part of a diet and exercise regimen to 
increase and maintain the type of weight that comes from muscles - lean body 
mass. People who are HIV+ may have decreased levels of different steroids in 
their body due to interference or alterations caused by HIV. Because of the 
potential for steroid abuse, and their potentially harmful side effects, anabolic 
steroids are strictly controlled drugs in the United States. But anabolic steroids 
are powerful drugs that, when used safely , might effectively treat the wasting 
process in people with AIDS and HIV disease.<P> 

Testosterone is the main anabolic steroid in humans. It is produced in the 
testicles and adrenal glands. Its function is to build muscles and masculinize. 
Synthetic versions of the hormone have been used to stimulate the bone 
marrow to produce red and white cells in certain autoimmune diseases in men 
and women. It is being studied as a treatment for depression and loss of sexual 
drive in people with AIDS. It is also sometimes used as a male contraceptive 
because the drug often leads to the inability to produce orgasm. Most cautions 
against the use of testosterone by women are based on the belief that 
administration of the drug will confer the secondary sexual characteristics 
usually attributed to men, such as hair growth, sexual aggressiveness or 
increased libido, and muscle growth. Use of testosterone is not recommended 
for women, but thorough study of testosterone treatment for women has not 
been done.<P> 

Naturally occurring testosterone is rapidly cleared by the liver and doesn't 
circulate in the body long enough to be useful as a treatment. Oral synthetic 
forms of testosterone are cleared more slowly by the liver, but tend to be liver 
toxic. A significant side effect of anabolic steroids is a tendency to produce an 
inflammation of the liver called hepatitis when taken orally. For older men, side 
effects include rapid enlargement of the prostate, causing difficulty with 
urination and the possibility of activating a previously undetected and inactive 
prostate cancer. Injectable testosterone formulations have longer half-lives than 
naturally occurring testosterone and are less liver toxic than the oral 
formulations.<P> 

The doses of steroids being suggested to maintain or increase weight in people 
who are HIV+ are usually lower than the doses used for other conditions, so the 
potential for side effects is theoretically less. Continuous use of very high doses 
of any anabolic steroid can cause a serious syndrome called peliosis hepatitis 
which can result in liver failure or stomach bleeding.<P> 

To maintain weight through the use of anabolic steroids, it's important to eat 
foods rich in amino acids and protein sources, and to exercise, preferably 
weight resistance training (bodybuilding). A recommended amount of protein is 
one gram for every pound of ideal body weight. Consult with a nutritionist about 
getting adequate amounts of protein from food and nutrition supplements. Four 
meals a day may be better for you than three. If you are unable to eat, due to 
side effects of medications and infections, a consultation with a nutritionist can 
help you figure out ways to get enough protein through nutrition supplements.<P> 

If you are taking an anabolic steroid to increase and maintain your weight, your 
doctor should consider cycling you off the drug every 6-8 weeks as a safeguard 
against side effects. If you have any history of diabetes or other liver problems, 
you should not attempt to use anabolic steroids. For information about anabolic 
steroids for the treatment of HIV-related weight loss, contact Anabolics for AIDS 
at (213) 851-6734. This non-profit organization is informational only, but can 
provide sample treatment protocols.<P> 

Another anabolic steroid being studied for the treatment of wasting is called 
oxandrolone. This anabolic steroid is not believed to have the same 
masculinizing effects as testosterone. Results of studies of oxandrolone for this 
purpose are expected soon.<P> 

<H4><A NAME="meeting">Forum announcement</A></H4><P>

A forum will be held on Wednesday, May 17, 6 to 9:30. This forum will cover the 
pros and cons of anabolic steroids, human growth hormone, and testosterone

<H4><A NAME="pcp">PCP prevention for children</A></H4><P>

Researchers studied data from Florida, California and Massachusetts to see 
how many children less than a year old in the United States get pneumocystis 
carinii pneumonia (PCP). This type of pneumonia is common in children and 
adults who are HIV-positive. If left untreated, PCP causes death. But it is usually 
both preventable and treatable.<P> 

The study shows that as many as two-thirds of infants exposed to HIV were not 
tested for HIV. The number of infants getting PCP who were born to HIV-infected 
mothers changed little between 1989 and 1992. More than half of the babies 
who got PCP were never given preventive medication.<P> 

Although many infants born to HIV+ mothers will no longer be HIV+ themselves 
after six months when their own immune systems take over, it is important to 
follow the infant's bloodwork to see if preventive medication is needed.<P>

A greater number of HIV-exposed infants must be identified at an earlier stage, 
and preventive medication should be prescribed, according to new guidelines 
that emphasize how the failure to identify HIV-exposed children has contributed 
to the increase of PCP in children. It is recommended that HIV testing and 
monitoring be made more available to children at risk. These guidelines 
recommend that all HIV-exposed infants begin preventive medication for PCP at 
four to six weeks, regardless of CD4 count and HIV test results. PCP prevention 
should be stopped once a child has been diagnosed as HIV-negative.<P> 

The drugs used for preventing PCP are the same for children as adults, though 
in different doses and in liquid formulations when given to infants too young to 
take pills. The drugs are Bactrim or Septra (two brands of the same drug), 
dapsone, pentamidine, and atovaquone, whose brand name is Mepron. First 
choice of treatment is Bactrim or Septra.<P>

Two trials for testing PCP prevention drugs in children are currently enrolling. 
One is for dapsone in liquid form, either once a day or once a week. The other is 
testing the combination of atovaquone, azithromycin and Bactrim in pill form for 
children 2 years or older. Call The Network at (800) 734-7104 for more 
information.<P>

<H4><A NAME="3tc">3TC Expanded Access Update</A></H4><P>

The 3TC Expanded Access program has slowed down. Some members report 
a four to six week wait before they receive approval to get onto this program 
sponsored by the manufacturer of the drug, Glaxo Inc. Glaxo provides this drug 
free of charge to physicians who request it for their patients who have failed 
other antiretroviral drugs. People must have less than 100 T-cells to get into the 
program.<P>

The 3TC Expanded Access program is included in the latest version of The 
Experimental Treatment Guide, The Network's directory of clinical trials and 
treatment programs. For a free copy of the new Spring edition of this directory

<H4><A NAME="micro">Microsporidiosis</A></H4><P>

Microsporidiosis is an intestinal infection that people with AIDS can get. The 
infection usually causes diarrhea. A trial is studying albendazole for the 
treatment of microsporidiosis. To participate in this study you must be HIV+, 18 
years or older, and have biopsy-proven microsporidiosis within 90 days of study 
entry. You must have a history of an average of 3 liquid bowel movements per 
day for 4 weeks prior to study entry and, if taking antidiarrheal medication, be on 
a stable regimen for at least 7 days before study entry. You must be on a stable 
regimen of any other medication for 2 weeks before study entry. Pregnant 
women and nursing mothers are not allowed. You cannot have taken any 
potential antiprotozoal drugs such as mebendazole or metronidazole within 1 
week of study entry or taken albendazole within 1 month of study entry.<P> 

Participants will be divided into two groups. One group will be treated with 
albendazole. The other group will be treated with placebo. Neither the doctor 
nor the participant will know which treatment is being given. After the 28 day 
double-blind period, all participants will receive open-label albendazole for 62 
days. If you become hospitalized or have to remain in the hospital due to 
worsening diarrhea during the first 14 days of the study, you will be given open-
label treatment. Treatment is for 3 months. Call The Network at (800) 734-7104 
for more information.<P>

Albendazole is also available through a compassionate use program for the 
treatment of microsporidiosis. Doctors should call (800) 355-8900 x 3909. They 
will be given a number to call at the FDA to obtain an IND number. Once that is 
complete, the pharmaceutical company will ship the drug directly to the 
physician.<P>

<H4><A NAME="fungal">Fungal Infection Overview</A></H4><P>

A recently completed study that compared clotrimazole to fluconazole to prevent 
fungal infections showed that fluconazole was more effective, particularly in 
people with 50 or fewer T4 cells. In addition, fluconazole was shown to reduce 
the frequency of cryptococcal meningitis, esophageal candidiasis, and 
superficial fungal infections. We updated the following fungal infection fact 
sheet to include this new information. It is still not recommended that all people 
take preventive treatment for fungal infections due to the possibility of resistance 
to treatment.<P>

Thrush is the most common and least serious fungal infection in HIV+ people. It 
can affect the mouth, throat, skin, stomach, and vagina. In a person with a 
weakened immune system, thrush can cause more serious problems. This 
condition is sometimes called candidiasis, because the germs that cause it are 
called candida albicans. Other types of fungus have been discovered, however, 
so it may be necessary to try different drugs besides the ones that are used 
now. Some medications, such as antibiotics, steroids, and cancer medications, 
may cause thrush.<P> 

Oral thrush (in the mouth) looks like white or red patches. It can cause sore 
throat, pain when swallowing, and nausea. It can also make you not want to eat, 
make eating painful, and make food taste different. Treatments for oral thrush 
include mouthwash and tablets called troches. Some people try baking soda or 
hydrogen peroxide mixed with water to rinse the mouth. If the thrush is 
advanced, this isn't likely to work. Treatments for thrush include clotrimazole, 
fluconazole, and ketoconazole. These drugs have different brand names. These 
drugs sometimes lose their effects when taken for long periods of time, but new 
ways to use these drugs, and new drugs are being studied.<P> 

Some people try different home remedies. Using large amounts of garlic, and 
avoiding foods which contain sugar, yeast or dairy products are popular, 
although unproven ways to stop the growth of thrush.<P> 

Vaginal candidiasis is a common yeast infection of the vagina. Symptoms 
include severe itching, burning, and a thick discharge, often white in color. It is 
possible that an infection such as unrecognized tuberculosis may be causing a 
vaginal yeast infection. Nystatin tablets are used for treatment. Clotrimazole 
ointment is another treatment, which is sold over-the-counter as Gyne-Lotrimin, 
Lotrimin or Mycelex. Studies have shown that HIV-negative women only have to 
take the drug Diflucan one time to treat this condition. Always consult with your 
doctor before beginning any treatment.<P>

Cryptococcal meningitis is a very serious fungal infection. It is caused by a 
fungus found mainly in dirt and bird droppings. Meningitis means swelling of the 
meninges. The meninges cover the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms can be 
hard to recognize as being caused by cryptococcal infection. Watch for fever, 
vomiting, headache, nausea, fatigue, loss of appetite, and a general feeling of 
not being well. Other symptoms are a stiff neck and, infrequently, seizures. 
Pneumonia may be an early sign of infection. Tell your doctor about symptoms 
right away.<P> 

A treatment that can be given by pill, in some cases, or by intravenous injection 
is fluconazole, or Diflucan. Most people prefer this treatment because it causes 
few side effects. Another common treatment for this condition is amphotericin B, 
which must be given by intravenous injection. Amphotericin B is used in more 
severe cases, as determined by performing a lumbar puncture (spinal tap).<P>

Histoplasmosis can be a life-threatening fungal infection and commonly occurs 
in the Southwestern U.S. In the past, histoplasmosis was treatable only with 
intravenous amphotericin. Itraconazole is used today, although it may not be 
effective for treating histoplasmosis involving the central nervous system and 
brain, since it does not penetrate well into the cerebrospinal fluid, which is the 
fluid that surrounds the spinal cord and brain.<P>

Blastomycosis is a fungal infection involving the lungs and occasionally 
spreading to the skin. The fungus is of unknown natural source. Most reported 
cases are from the southeastern states and the Mississippi River valley, and 
occur in men ages 20 to 40. When infection occurs in the lungs, a dry hacking or 
productive cough, chest pain, fever, chills, drenching sweats, and shortness of 
breath are initial symptoms. If untreated, the disease slowly causes death. 
Amphotericin B is highly effective. Improvement begins within a week, with rapid 
disappearance of organisms.<P> 

<H4><A NAME="invest">For Investigational Use Only</A></H4><P>

I am twenty-two weeks into the Merck MK-639 protease inhibitor clinical trial. 
This trial was appealing to me because it was in phase III. It was also open 
label, meaning I would know from the beginning which drug(s) I'd be receiving, 
as opposed to taking substances unknown to me.<P>

This trial has three arms: protease inhibitor alone vs. protease inhibitor plus AZT 
vs. protease inhibitor with AZT and ddI. The trial was randomized, in other 
words, a computer assigned participants to one of the three arms. I had strong 
feelings against AZT and couldn't imagine ingesting a combination of all three 
medications.<P>

I called all of my friends and my family and asked them to wish me luck, cross 
their fingers (anything short of a Novena) to ensure I'd get the protease 
monotherapy arm. I literally jumped for joy when I was informed that I would 
receive protease inhibitor alone.<P>

I had heard of the wonders of protease inhibitors while attending the 
International Conference on AIDS in Yokohama. I understood that the Merck 
protease inhibitor was tops, i.e. better bioavailability, no side effects, etc. I even 
considered enrolling my two year old daughter in an NIH protease inhibitor trial 
but decided against it because it was only in Phase I.<P>

My T-cells were 250 when I started. They increased to 290 within a month. I was 
very excited! I felt energetic! Three months into the trial I developed acute 
sinusitis and was put on Biaxin. Yeachhh!. I felt green, looked yellow, and was 
vomiting bile first thing in the morning, every morning. My lover even questioned 
my fidelity! After thirteen days on antibiotics the picture improved slightly.<P>

Then the bad news. In January my T-cells dropped to 190. Yikes! Statistically, 
other participants were celebrating the doubling of their T-cells by this point. I 
was depressed and anxious because the mention of Bactrim for PCP 
prophylaxis was suggested. I was not ready to hear this. My wonder drug was 
letting me down. So, I stopped taking the protease inhibitor for a while (under 2 
weeks).<P>

I repaired my fried liver by taking milk thistle and thioctic lipid acid, both 
recommended to me by Fred Bingham at DAAIR. When I went back to my trial 
site with my unused protease inhibitor, I was informed that I could do "low dose," 
which meant taking one capsule four times a day versus three capsules four 
times a day. Oh joy!<P>

My blood work was monitored meticulously and eventually we increased my 
dosage to two capsules four times a day. I've tried to increase back to the 
original dose but found that it was difficult for me to tolerate it. The good news is 
that I feel like I've struck a good balance - my T-cells have gone up to 390 and 
my liver function is within normal limits. Now I have to decide what to combine 
with my protease inhibitor. Cats claw? SPV-30? AZT!@?@*#? The 
combinations are endless! Not all are allowed while on the study so I'll have to 
do some investigating, then go with what feels right.<P>

<H4><A NAME="inflam">Treatment for HIV-related inflammation</A></H4><P>

A drug that has been used for many years to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, 
and an immune system disease called Lupus, is being tested as a treatment for 
HIV-related inflammation. Inflammation, a typical immune system response, can 
lead to undesirable symptoms and aggravation of HIV. The drug being tested, 
hydroxychloroquine (also called Plaquenil) is available by prescription. Side 
effects are very rare when used for the conditions for which the drug is 
approved.<P>

This study will test the combination of hydroxychloroquine and AZT. The 
researcher conducting this study had good results with an earlier study of the 
drug in HIV+ people. This new, Phase III study is looking for people who are 18 
years or older with a T4 cell count of between 200 and 500. Participants will be 
divided into two groups. One group will take both drugs. The other group will 
take AZT alone. Neither the doctor nor the participant will know which treatment 
is being given. Treatment lasts four months.<P>

<p><font size=3><b><A NAME="3TC">3TC and AZT</A></b></font><br>

The combination of two drugs, AZT and 3TC, has shown surprisingly good results in several clinical trials that were recently reported on at a scientific conference held in Scotland. The two drug combination significantly reduced HIV levels in some of the people in the study. This combination was much more effective at reducing HIV levels in the blood than AZT or ddI taken by itself. The reduction of HIV levels has been sustained for almost a year in several of the study participants. In addition, people taking the combination had an overall increase in the number of T4 cells. Taking either AZT alone, or 3TC alone, does not produce these effects.</p><p>

People taking the combination of 3TC and AZT did not experience any more side effects than if they were only taking AZT. Some people who take AZT experience side effects such as headaches, fatigue, and nausea. Some people taking 3TC experienced similar side effects, although more than 50% of the people in one study had no major side effects. The benefits of taking AZT in combination with 3TC were also seen in people who were already taking AZT alone. Another benefit that scientists around the world are eagerly waiting to confirm is 3TC's activity against the hepatitis B virus. In test tube studies, and in Phase I and Phase II studies, the drug was very effective against this virus.</p><p>

The question that we still don't have the answer to is whether taking the combination of AZT and 3TC will help people who are HIV+ to live longer than if they don't take this drug combination. Like any other drugs approved for the treatment of AIDS and HIV-related conditions, most people with AIDS will not be able to get this drug unless it is approved by the federal government. Glaxo Pharmaceuticals, the company that owns the drug 3TC, has generously made it available to thousands of people nationwide through a special program. A new clinical trial comparing 3TC, AZT, and a protease inhibitor against AZT and 3TC has begun as well. If you would like more information about how to get 3TC, or any other experimental or approved drug give us a call at our nationwide, toll- free treatment access program at (800) 734-7104.</p>

<p><font size=3><b><A NAME="AZT">AZT and Children</A></b></font><br>

One part of a trial that gave AZT to children has been stopped. The study compares three different treatments for children (ages 3 months to 18 years old) with symptomatic HIV infection. Interim results show that AZT by itself is the least effective of the three treatments, and the children taking AZT alone have higher rates of side effects. The children in the study are 3 months to 18 years old. The study is called ACTG 152. The groups in the study taking ddI alone, and ddI in combination with AZT will continue. Children who were taking AZT alone can switch over to one of these two groups if they want.</p><p>

Studies are monitored by groups called independent data and safety monitoring boards (DSMB). If the board finds reason to stop a trial early, either because the drug is not working or because it is working so well that the drug should be made more widely available, changes are made in the study. The monitoring board found that the group of children taking AZT alone had more rapid rates of disease progression and more side effects.</p><p>

The study opened in August 1991 and enrolled the last participant in August 1993, for a total of 839 participants. Further analysis of the study will take place in late 1995 after the study ends.</p>

<p><font size=3><b><A NAME="protease">Protease Inhibitor Studies enrolling</A></b></font><br>

The enzyme called protease is essential to the HIV virus, Without this tiny piece, HIV can't make infectious copies of itself. A new type of anti-HIV drug is now being tested. It is hoped that this drug will stop or inhibit the protease enzyme. This is why a drug of this type is called a protease inhibitor. There are several different types of protease inhibitors currently being studied in clinical trials. Each one seems to act differently in the human body.</p><p>

Researchers are still developing new types, and testing new doses of protease inhibitors. One protease inhibitor that has been tested - and dropped by the company that makes it - caused liver problems. Another has very poor bioavailability (which means that, however much someone actually takes, enough of the drug doesn't get into their system to be effective).</p><p>

In order for a drug to be made available by prescription, it must be easily absorbed by the body, and the company that makes it must be able to produce it in sufficient quantities for sale to all those for whom it is prescribed. So far, there are problems with both of these things, but testing and fine-tuning continues. The HIV virus has become resistant to every protease inhibitor tested so far. This is why most researchers believe that, regardless of what type of protease inhibitor someone takes, it will need to be taken in combination with other anti- HIV drugs. David Ho of the Aaron Diamond Research Center in New York, along with other leading AIDS researchers, suggests that combinations of protease inhibitors may prove to be more useful than just one.</p><p>

The three protease inhibitors described below so far seem to be safe, but little is known about their long term use. Hoffman-LaRoche, a large pharmaceutical company, is testing a protease inhibitor called saquinavir. Saquinavir is difficult and expensive to make. Results from clinical trials of the drug have been promising, yet they haven't shown that this is the knock-out drug everyone had hoped for - at least not at the doses being tested. The company says it will not be able to produce enough of this drug for a large distribution program until mid-1995. Still, over 4,000 people are taking this drug in Phase III clinical trials. The trials are studying saquinavir in combination with AZT, ddI, ddC and nevirapine. In earlier studies, this protease inhibitor reduced the amount of HIV in the body.</p><p>

The drug company, Abbott, is also testing a protease inhibitor. Their drug, ABT- 538, is beginning Phase III studies, alone and in combination with AZT. The drug has high bioavailability, with over 90% of the drug being absorbed in the body. Because earlier studies showed that ABT-538 can cause liver and eye damage, eye examinations and liver tests will be part of current and future trials. A new study of another protease inhibitor has just opened. This one is made by Merck, the world's largest drug company. It is called L-735, 524. The drug is being studied alone and in combination with AZT and 3TC. Earlier trials showed that resistance developed quickly to L-735, and it is hoped that higher doses and combination treatment will overcome this problem. Merck gets a big star for putting this study together so quickly.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b><A NAME="KS">Herpes Cancer?</A></b></font><br>

Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a type of cancer that can appear in people with AIDS as dark brown or purple marks called lesions. KS can also affect the internal organs. KS can be slow growing, or indolent, but it can also be aggressive and grow very rapidly. If it's aggressive, most people choose to start treatment.</p><p>

Two Columbia University researchers recently announced there is strong evidence that KS is actually caused by a newly recognized herpes virus which they call KSHV. But demonstrating that a virus causes a cancer is not an easy thing to do.</p><p>

Herpesviruses have long been suspected as co-factors in HIV disease, although before this no one has suggested that KS was caused by any kind of virus. Herpesviruses are known to sometimes tag along with HIV, and set up shop in a cell by hanging out a welcome flag - the same sugar coated proteins that HIV uses to enter into a cell.</p><p>

Others feel that HIV infection itself may lead to the development of this cancer. A group of scientists at San Francisco General Hospital, UCSF, suggest that HIV causes the body to produce chemicals that create a hospitable environment for KS to grow.</p><p>

Both of these groups of scientists could be right. In either case, stopping the growth of KS is a priority. The drugs used to treat KS at the present are not always effective, and they are costly and toxic. Although a new drug, Doxil, has been recommended for approval, there is debate about just how well it works. Are the anti-herpes drugs foscarnet or acyclovir effective against KS. Is the Abbott protease inhibitor a useful KS treatment? Rapidly executed clinical trials - and agreement on what a successful treatment works like - would at least give us an idea.</p>

<p><font size=3><b><A NAME="aspirin">Aspirin Study Stopped</A></b></font><br>

The Community Research Initiative on AIDS (CRIA) has announced their study testing high-dose aspirin for the treatment of HIV infection has been stopped. Some side effects were seen in people in the study. The side effects were a reduction in the number of red blood cells and modest increases in liver enzymes. These side effects are common with the use of high-dose aspirin, and the study was designed so that safety checks would find out right away if the study should be stopped. Participants in the study who were having these side effects were taken off the study, and their lab values returned to normal. The Data Safety Monitoring Board reviewed all data collected so far and recommended the trial be stopped. All participants have been discontinued from treatment. See the earlier article on Children and AZT for another example of how a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) works.</p><p>

Strong cautions to people about trying aspirin on their own were part of all materials released in connection to this study. If you did try high dose aspirin on your own, you should see your doctor right away to make sure that your blood work is okay.</p><p>

A related drug, salasalate, is being tested in a clinical trial as well. This drug does not have the same toxicity profile as aspirin - although it is still not yet known whether it is safe and effective for their treatment of HIV disease. CRIA also has other studies that are enrolling, such as U-90, also known as delavirdine. Results of this drug have so far been promising.</p>

<p><font size=3><b><A NAME="water">What's in the water?</A></b></font><br>

<I>A recent meeting about cryptosporidiosis was held at The AIDS Center of Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. These meetings are open to anyone interested. The number to call if you're interested in getting notices about the meetings is (212) 241-1897. The presenter was Dr. Rosemary Soave, who's doing research at NYU/Cornell.</I></p><p>

Cryptosporidiosis is a protozoal infection. Infection can come from water, or person to person. Infection causes watery diarrhea that can last for weeks. Once infected, even if the infection is controlled by your immune system, it appears that you can become ill again.</p><p>

The individual protozoa are called oocysts. The oocysts are resistant to the environment, which means they can last many months in water and continue to be infectious. The oocysts are also resistant to disinfectants. Pure undiluted bleach won't kill the oocysts until at least 20 minutes have gone by. A swimming pool is only 1-2% chlorine, so swimming pool water is potentially infectious.</p><p>

Once you're infected with cryptosporidiosis, the oocysts make more of themselves, infecting new cells. Different species of cryptosporidiosis infect cattle, humans, birds and fish. The same species, called C. parvum, infects both cattle and humans. Cow stool can potentially wash into reservoirs. Pasteurizing milk kills cryptosporidiosis. We don't yet know whether bird or fish species can infect humans.</p><p>

We don't know how cryptosporidiosis causes infection. Large adult animals, like cows, are commonly infected but don't get sick. Veterinarians have been looking for a treatment since the seventies because the infection can kill newborn calves.</p><p>

Small animals like mice don't get symptomatic infection so there's been nothing to study in the lab. Cryptosporidiosis is found everywhere, but we don't know how many people are carrying the organism. In people with AIDS, 10-20% appear to be infected.</p><p>

We don't know which part of cryptosporidiosis your immune system responds to in order to make antibodies. It's impossible to grow cryptosporidiosis in the lab because researchers can't clean up stool enough to make sure there isn't contamination from something else. Because it's impossible to grow cryptosporidiosis in the lab, and because there are no small animals that come down with the disease, there are still many unanswered questions about cryptosporidiosis.</p><p>

It's pretty clear that transmission happens between people because if one person in a family has cryptosporidiosis, other members in the family are likely to be infected. Sexual transmission probably also occurs. Cryptosporidiosis is water born. People's awareness of cryptosporidiosis was heightened by the outbreak in Milwaukee in 1993. Doctors don't automatically look for cryptosporidiosis as a cause of infection. Be sure and ask your doctor to tell the lab to test for cryptosporidiosis, if you have diarrhea for several weeks. All the outbreaks have been in cities with public water filtering systems. New York City doesn't have a filtered water system, but it doesn't make a difference anyway. Pressure to install filtered systems at huge expense is political, and not based on scientific fact.</p><p>

Dr. Soave feels that awareness of cryptosporidiosis is high in New York City. We are not at risk of an epidemic. In examining the water, 1-2 oocysts have been found in stains of 100 liters of water. A stain is a process in the lab by which researchers can see the organisms. We don't know if these 2 oocysts are definitely cryptosporidiosis, if they are dead or alive, or how many you need to become infected. Since nobody sits down and drinks 100 liters of water at one time, so the risk of infection from drinking water in New York City appears to be very small.</p><p>

The big question is, "What do you advise people to do?" Dr. Soave suggests, if you're uncomfortable about the potential for infection, boil all your drinking water for one minute. One minute is enough to kill the oocysts - if they exist. Once you start boiling your drinking water though, you should also brush your teeth with boiled water and wash your vegetables with boiled water. Dr. Soave felt this was burdensome, and that boiling all the water you use is not necessary based on what we know.</p><p>

Some bottled waters make claims to be cryptosporidiosis free, but Dr. Soave said there is no data, and that none of the waters or bottling plants are regularly tested for cryptosporidiosis.</p><p>

No really good treatment exists for cryptosporidiosis. Azithromycin at high doses is effective in some people. Another treatment being studied is Humatin. Most people who participate in Dr. Soave's trials have failed Humatin and Azithromycin. Dr. Soave emphasized that, if you are going to take Azithromycin, be sure and get the drug directly from Pfizer through their compassionate use program. This drug is better absorbed. Call The Network if you need the phone number.</p><p>

A new study is enrolling using IGX for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis. IGX is made from chicken egg yolks. The chickens are treated so they make high levels of immuno-globulins which fight cryptosporidiosis infection. Participants in the trial drink a nog made of the egg yolks five times a day. The eggs are irradiated so there is no possibility of salmonella or other infection. Dr. Soave has already seen nutritional benefit from the treatment. Controlling the diarrhea with IGX has the added benefit of helping someone who's lost weight put it back on. To participate in this trial, you must be HIV+ and have cryptosporidiosis. You cannot have other infections in your intestines, a history of KS, CMV or MAC in your intestines, or be allergic to eggs. Call The Network for more information.</p>

<p><font size=3><b><A NAME="DHPG">Prevention and Treatment Studies for CMV</A></b></font><br>

CMV disease is caused by a herpesvirus called cytomegalovirus (CMV). When it infects the eyes, it's called CMV retinitis. CMV can also infect other parts of the body. Ganciclovir and foscarnet are the approved drugs for treating CMV disease. Ganciclovir is also called Cytovene or DHPG, and foscarnet is called Foscavir. Both drugs are given by intravenous infusion through a permanent catheter that's placed in your chest. Once you have CMV disease you have to continue treatment every day. This is called maintenance therapy. The IV infusions are taken twice a day.</p><p>

Although IV infusion is still necessary for the first part of treatment (called induction therapy), a recently approved pill form of ganciclovir is now available for maintenance therapy. Maintenance therapy starts once the active disease is under control. Oral ganciclovir is taken with food, three or six times a day. Intravenous infusions may no longer be needed.</p><p>

Studies comparing the capsule to the IV form of the drug for treatment showed that the IV form was a little better. The major side effects of both forms are blood disorders. The most common side effects experienced by those taking the capsules were diarrhea, fever, leukopenia, and nausea.</p><p>

Recent studies show that oral ganciclovir can prevent or delay CMV disease in people with low T4 cell counts. Taking the capsules for prevention may reduce cases of CMV disease by one-half. Because of the side effects, people also had to take G-CSF and erythropoietin, which stimulate growth of new blood cells, more often than study participants who got placebo.</p><p>

Studies for prevention and treatment of CMV are ongoing. Oral ganciclovir for prevention use is now available through an expanded access program. Your doctor will have to call the company to register, and then fill out certain forms so the company can collect data on how well this drug works for prevention.</p><p>

A study comparing different treatments (IV ganciclovir, an eye implant with oral ganciclovir, or an eye implant alone) is also looking for people. The implant is also available from the drug company through a compassionate use program if you are unable to take other treatments. A study of foscarnet for the treatment of CMV colitis is enrolling. CMV colitis is CMV infection in the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract.</p>

<p><font size=3><b><A NAME="herbal">Herbal Medicines</A></b></font><br>

<I>This article was found online, and is reprinted with permission of the author, Camilla Cracchiolo, RN (camilla@primenet.com)</I></p><p>

There is nothing about herbs that automatically makes them non-toxic just because they are natural. Ever hear of deadly nightshade or poisonous mushrooms? They are drugs, like other drugs, and should be approached with the same caution. This means, for example, that pregnant women should be as careful about medicinal herbs as they are about conventional medicines. Some medicinal herbs are clearly linked to birth defects. People on certain medications, like anticoagulants or psychiatric drugs, can have serious problems from interactions between the herb and the medicine they're taking.</p><p>

In the US, herbs do not contain information about side effects, dangers and contraindications on the label (which I think they should). Many physicians are not well informed about herbs, and so you cannot always rely on your doctor to know about potential problems. And if you have or suspect you have a serious illness, it is very important to be under a doctor's care. Self diagnosis is not always accurate and self treatment doesn't always work. For this reason, you should be very well read before trying herbal medicines on your own, and you may wish to consult a trained herbalist.</p><p>

Unfortunately, in the US anyone can hang out a shingle and call themselves an herbalist. Lots of these people have no idea what they're doing. I have found practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine to be the best trained. I don't accept the model that traditional Chinese practitioners use to explain the effects of herbs (yin/yang, hot/cold, damp/dry, etc.). I also have problems with the amount of unsupported anecdotal info mixed in with scientific studies. But traditional Chinese doctors treat herbs with a lot of respect and caution. They are well up on the side effects and contraindications.</p><p>

Herbal medicines have several other main problems. One of the big ones is that the pharmacologically active ingredient may occur in conjunction with other toxic compounds. Examples of toxic compounds often found in herbs include pyrolizadine alkaloids (very toxic to the liver and cause both benign and malignant liver tumors); coumarins (which decrease the ability of the blood to clot); and allergens. The latter can be quite important to people who are allergic to ragweed; some herbs in the ragweed family (chamomile and yarrow are examples) can cause severe allergic reactions in these folks. Most companies do not list the source of their herbs or how they were grown. Pesticide contamination is a possibility.</p><p>

Another big problem is that the amount of pharmacologically active ingredient available varies widely from plant to plant, so accurately regulating dosage is difficult. Because of this, and the toxic compounds mentioned above, it is often better to rely on an extracted and standardized compound (conventional drugs) when possible. However, some of the active ingredients of herbs cannot be found in this form.</p><p>

Yet another problem is with herb labelling. Very few herbal medicines marketed in the US have both the Latin name of the herb and an expiration date marked on the bottle. Often, this is deliberate: fraud is rampant among companies marketing herbs. One brand that does have good labelling is Nature's Way. Alternatively, if you live in a city with a large Chinese, Japanese or Korean population, you can try the herb sellers in that district. I've personally found the herb sellers in Chinatown here in L.A. To be very honest and knowledgeable (although language is often a problem, alas. Gotta learn to speak Chinese one of these days.)</p><p>

And finally, very few herb books contain dosage information. I have *a lot* of problems with Michael Tierra's herb books. I don't accept the medical models he endorses (traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda). I also don't like the fact that Tierra doesn't distinguish between scientifically validated information and anecdotes. But Tierra's books are among the very few herbal medicine books that discuss dosage. Just making up a weak tea is usually not enough to get a pharmacologically effective dose. Tierra is the author of "The Way Of Herbs" and "Planetary Herbology."</p><p>

Warning: Tierra's books should be used as supplemental sources only and never as your primary source of information on herbs. I have spotted several places where he has left out important information on toxicity.</p><p>

I strongly recommend "The Honest Herbal" by Varro Tyler to anyone who is considering or using herbal medicines. It is the one herb book that I have ever found that relies solely on scientific studies instead of anecdotes and which provides references. Tyler himself has impressive credentials, being a tenured professor of pharmacognosy (the branch of pharmacy that deals with herbal medicine) in the school of pharmacy at Purdue University. The ISBN # is 1- 56024-287-6 and it is published by the Haworth Press, 10 Alice Street, Binghamton NY 13904-1580. It is in print, costs about $20 and I got mine through a regular bookstore which special ordered it for me.</p>

<p><font size=3><b><A NAME="alt">Considering alternative treatments</A></b></font><br>

I agreed to participate at the Fifth Annual Statewide HIV/AIDS Policy Conference. The conference took place in Albany, New York late last year. This was my first time as a panelist, and I looked forward to exchanging ideas at the session titled "Alternative Treatments: Worth it or a waste?"</p><p>

I have had my share of experiencing both. When I was first diagnosed I remember going into a health food store and asking for anything antiviral. Through trial and error (sometimes costly) I learned some lessons such as the importance of using herbs under the guidance of an herbologist who is familiar with HIV. Chinese medicine, including acupuncture, has benefited my health by reducing stress, aiding my body in detoxifying itself and helping create an energy balance.</p><p>

If you are considering any treatment, alternative or otherwise, it's important to get together information so you can make a decision. At the conference, speaking about finding an acupuncturist, Kevin Ergil, dean of Pacific Institute of Oriental Medicine emphasized the importance of an acupuncturist's credentials. Is s/he licensed? Is s/he familiar with HIV/AIDS?</p><p>

It was emphasized that alternative medicine can be used to complement traditional medicine - for instance, it can help the body handle some of the toxic side effects of AZT. A major concern, however, is the disbelief that many western practitioners have regarding alternative therapies. Much of this disbelief stems from lack of knowledge and unwillingness to learn. At a time when more and more people with HIV/AIDS are questioning the efficacy of AZT, especially after the Concord study, there is interest in alternative treatments such as vitamin therapy, herbs, and therapeutic touch. Patients need to communicate their interest in alternative practices with their primary caregiver and request that their bloods be monitored closely.</p><p>

Factors to consider when incorporating any of these therapies into your regimen are cost, convenience and information. If it costs more than a car payment, it's too much. Is it convenient? How does it fit into your life stye? For example, do you have time for bitter melon retention enemas every morning? And perhaps the most important thing is how much is really known about it? Do you have solid information that it works?</p><p>

Because most of these treatments haven't been in clinical trials, the emphasis has to be on gathering information from different sources yourself. Don't just listen to the company's sales pitch that's trying to sell you a new herbal formula. Talk to people that have tried it. Research the ingredients. And always be sure and tell your doctor if you add new treatments so that she or he can watch for any interactions and, hopefully, good results.</p><p>

SPV-30 is a herbal compound taken from an evergreen tree called Boxwood. The extract is made by a French company called Arkopharma. In lab tests, the extract showed anti-HIV activity. In a small placebo-controlled trial in HIV+ people, T4 cell counts increased an average of approximately 100 after 30 weeks of taking SPV-30. Researchers in France are doing Phase II and III studies in people with 250 to 500 T4 cells. Arkopharma has agreed to donate this extract to start 10 informal studies in the US. Each study will enroll 40-50 people and the study will last 6 months.</p><p>

Contact David Stokes - his number is (617) 424-9195 - and he will mail you the study protocol and informed consent form. You will have to have blood tests done by your doctor, and will have to pay for these yourself if your insurance company doesn't cover them. A PCR test is requested, and this can cost as much as $200. If you are unable to get a PCR test, a p24 antigen test will be accepted.</p><p>

If you have just started any new medications, you will have to wait 2 months before starting the SPV-30. You are asked not to change your other drug treatments and supplements for six months. Blood tests are required every 2 months. You are responsible for having the blood tests done and sending the results to the doctor who is overseeing the study. If your insurance doesn't cover the blood tests required for the study, or if you're unable to provide the required information on the forms, SPV-30 can also be bought from buyers clubs. Call The Network for a referral to a buyers club or for more information about this study. If you are already taking this proposed treatment, please call us and let us know about it.</p>

<p><font size=3><b><A NAME="fos">Foscarnet for KS</A></b></font><br>

A small trial to study foscarnet for the treatment of KS has been proposed by researchers in New York City and San Francisco. The goal is to find out if foscarnet has any benefit when used to treat KS. This study will be looking for participants with early KS - approximately five lesions and for no longer than six months, and with no prior treatment for KS. The final study plan has not yet been approved by the drug company. The Network is keeping track of this study and will know when it's ready to open. Call The Network for more information.</p>

<p><font size=3><b><A NAME="teco">Two studies for KS</A></b></font><br>

Tecogalen is an angiogenesis inhibitor. Angiogenesis is thought to be the process by which KS lesions grow. A drug than can inhibit, or stop this process may be able to control the KS. To participate in this trial, you must be HIV+ and have KS with 10 or more skin lesions. There is no T4 cell count requirement. You cannot have taken experimental treatments within 4 weeks of starting the study. You cannot have been on any anti-KS therapy for at least 3 weeks or have any opportunistic infection other than KS within 4 weeks prior to starting treatment. </p><p>

Another study is using IL-2. In a normal functioning immune system, IL-2 is a chemical that prompts special immune system cells to destroy diseased cells. IL-2 may help the immune system fight HIV and KS. An IL-2 study is being done at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD. The NIH will pay for airfare for every visit except the first. To participate in this study, you must be 18 years or older, male or female, HIV+, and have KS. Your T4 cell count must be over 200.</p>

Thalidomide is in clinical trials now for the treatment of HIV infection, mouth ulcers, and wasting associated with HIV infection. A special program provides thalidomide for treatment of apthous ulcers (ulcers in the mouth). The program is sponsored by the FDA, the government agency responsible for approving drugs for treatment. They ask doctors to fax requests with as much information as possible. The fax number is (301) 443-9292. Currently the FDA is approving 10-20 requests for people with AIDS for the treatment of apthous ulcers each week. The FDA asks that an oral biopsy be done to make sure the ulcers are not due to viral or fungal infections. If you and your doctor have difficulty obtaining thalidomide, you should call the PWA Health Group at (212) 255-0520. A special information packet is available from this organization. The FDA has also been approving some applications for use of thalidomide in treating anal ulcers and weight loss.

A trial studying IL-2 by subcutaneous injection for the treatment of HIV infection is enrolling in New York and other cities. Because of the side effects of IV infusion, some doctors are giving the drug by subcutaneous injection. This trial will study the combination of IL-2 and AZT. Participants will be divided into two groups. Everyone will take AZT. The first group will also be given shots of IL-2. After 24 weeks, the second group will be given shots of IL-2 and the first group will take only AZT. To participate in this study you must be HIV+, 18 years or older, and have a T4 cell count between 300 and 700. You must have taken and tolerated AZT for 6 months or longer at 500 mg./day.

<p><font size=3><b><A NAME="fire">It's time to start a fire</A></b></font><br>

<I>This is an editorial by Ken Fornataro, the director of The Network. It represents his own views, not those of the organization. The Network is responsible for recruiting a large number of participants in both industry and government sponsored clinical trials.</I><BR>

The drug acyclovir, approved by the federal government for the treatment of herpesvirus infections, is a safe and effective drug. This drug has been used for well over a decade, and the reported side effects have been minor. Almost twenty years of using the drug have not demonstrated that herpesviruses easily develop resistance to the drug. Several years ago it was suggested that taking an approved dose of this drug - up to 1600 milligrams a day - may actually help people with AIDS to live longer. The reason for this suggestion is that pieces of the herpesvirus can interact with HIV and cause an increase in HIV levels. One recent study showed that when a herpesvirus is active, the level of HIV in the body escalates. Although herpesviruses may not be as lethal as the HIV virus - still, hundreds of people die every year from them - herpesviruses cause serious damage to the immune system and the body. Physicians should be prescribing the drug to all HIV-infected individuals, regardless of their history of herpesvirus infection. What's the delay?</p><p>

The point here is that any virus that someone is infected with - HIV, herpesviruses, hepatitis - needs to be treated. Viruses rarely go away by themselves. There is a common belief that the herpesvirus lies dormant until something provokes an outbreak. This may be true, but it sounds similar to what we thought for many years about the HIV virus. We now know this is just not true. Over a billion HIV infected cells are produced everyday, regardless of the symptoms or infections that someone has. If herpesviruses do the same thing, while causing HIV to multiply, shouldn't researchers be testing everything they can think of to stop herpesviruses as well? Where's the fire? One needs to be started.</p><p>

A recent finding that the cancer Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) may be caused by a herpesvirus - and possibly treatable with herpes drugs - adds some fuel. Also, the article on CMV - another herpesvirus - describes the positive results of the study of a herpesvirus drug, oral ganciclovir, used to prevent CMV disease in people with less than 100 T4 cells.</p><p>

Still another study - ACTG 204 - recently announced that the two arms of a three arm study that were taking acyclovir did better than the other group that was taking valacyclovir, an acyclovir pro-drug. The idea behind a pro-drug is simple. Basically, the drug turns into the drug that it is a pro-drug of once in the body. When you give someone valacyclovir, it turns into acyclovir in the body. Is this what really happens, or is this just what we think happens? Did the drug valacyclovir work less well in this study than the drug acyclovir, or did acyclovir work very well? Or, as a recent epidemiological study suggests, is taking an anti-herpes drug on a regular basis more important than how much is taken? The idea behind valacyclovir is to get as much of the drug it turns into - acyclovir - into the body. Perhaps that's not what the body wants. None of these questions change the observation that taking a small dose of acyclovir - an already approved drug - may help keep people alive for a longer period of time, and help them to prevent KS.</p><p>

We know that herpesvirus increase HIV levels. They may cause KS. Hemophiliacs who became HIV positive through contaminated blood - until a few years ago blood was not routinely screened for the HIV virus - die faster if they are also infected with a herpesvirus. Some people with HIV disease are already taking acyclovir. Its hard to believe that everyone with HIV disease isn't taking it. It's hard to believe that federal researchers and industry scientists aren't shouting from the rooftops that we may have stumbled on an important lead on how to treat one - or more - deadly viruses. There is no excuse for the drug not being readily available as an over-the-counter, nonprescription drug at these doses.</p>

<p><font size=3><b>New Information gathering study for KS</b></font><br>
Kaposi's sarcoma, or KS, is a cancer that may be caused by a sexually 
transmitted virus. KS can appear as lesions on the surface of the skin that can 
start as small brown or red spots, raised or flat. Sometimes they go away on 
their own. Lesions can be treated with local treatments such as injections of 
anti-cancer drugs directly into the lesions. KS lesions can also appear 
internally. If the KS spreads internally, chemotherapy is usually necessary. 
Chemotherapies are drugs given by injection and by infusion.</P> 
<p>Recent articles in the New York Times and other newspapers and journals 
reported on the findings of a research team at Columbia of a virus that might be 
associated with KS. Though the researchers haven't identified the virus, it 
seems to be a herpes virus. What they did find was genetic material in samples 
taken from KS lesions that may indicate an infection with a common virus.</P> 
<p>A study has just started in New York City to find out more about KS. Information 
gained from this study may help lead to new areas of research to find a 
treatment for KS. This information gathering study will look at skin samples 
(biopsies) from KS lesions to find out more about the lesions. Urine samples will 
also be taken to determine whether angiogenesis causes lesions to grow. 
Angiogenesis is when blood vessels grow. This is a normal part of wound 
healing, but with some cancers the process gets out of control.</P 
<P>The biopsies taken in the study will be compared to ones taken from people 
who have KS but are not HIV+. Biopsies will only be taken from lesions that 
have not received local treatment such as cryotherapy or injections of 
chemotherapy. Some participants will be asked to return for second biopsies, 
blood and urine samples. HIV-negative men will serve as controls from whom 
biopsies from healthy skin will be obtained, as well as blood and urine samples.</P> 
<P>A control is a group in the study that can be used for comparison. Participants 
with KS cannot have received systemic therapy as treatment. While on the 
study, you cannot take steroids or experimental treatments for KS.</P>

<p><font size=3><b>Gene transfer trial</b></font><br>
A new gene therapy is in clinical trials for the treatment of HIV infection. The 
treatment is called HIV-IT. HIV-IT works by delivering two parts of the HIV virus 
to cells that aren't infected by HIV. These parts are genes with the names env 
and rev. These genes end up on the outside of uninfected cells. It is hoped this 
will boost an immune response that kills infected cells. In earlier trials, HIV-IT 
was able to boost the immune response. The treatment was well tolerated. A 
larger trial is now enrolling. To participate in this trial, you must be HIV+, 18 to 
65 years old, and agree to use a barrier form of birth control. If you are taking an 
antiretroviral, you must have been on a stable dose for 3 months. The 
antiretroviral must be discontinued for 96 hours before and 48 hours after each 
treatment. You cannot have any opportunistic infection. You cannot have been 
taking any experimental treatments within 30 days of starting the study. Other 
drugs are not allowed, which the study coordinator will go over with you. If you 
are interested in this study, call The Network for more information.</P>

<p><font size=3><b>Bowel syndrome</b></font><br>
A new trial is studying glutamine as a treatment for leaky bowel syndrome 
associated with HIV infection. Leaky bowel syndrome is when the lining of the 
intestines thins and isn't able to repair itself. Glutamine is an amino acid 
required by the body that may help the lining of the intestines to grow when it's 
been damaged.</P> 
<P>This trial is being done because it has been observed that when people have to 
take Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) in the hospital or at home, they sometimes 
develop leaky bowel syndrome. TPN is given to people who can't absorb 
enough nutrients from food. TPN doesn't have glutamine in it. When glutamine 
was given to the people on TPN, the lining of their intestines repaired itself.
This study will look at whether treatment with glutamine can improve leaky 
bowels. Participants will be given tests, which are done with the urine. After you 
drink some sugars, your urine is tested to see how leaky your intestines are. 
Participants will also have a biopsy, which is done by swallowing a small 
capsule after numbing the throat. Then you're x-rayed to make sure the 
capsule's gone into your intestine, after which it's pulled back out. The biopsy 
takes 15-20 minutes to perform.</P> 
<P>After the biopsy, participants will be divided into three groups. The first two 
groups will take different doses of glutamine. The third group will take a 
placebo. Neither the participant nor the doctor will know which treatment is 
being given. After 28 days, permeability tests and biopsies will be done again. 
This is an outpatient trial.</P>

<p><font size=3><b>Your Eyes and HIV</b></font><br>
If you are having blurred vision or other problems with your eyes, it's important 
to see an ophthalmologist who is experienced in examining and treating people 
with HIV. Don't wait. Eye problems can become permanent and even lead to 
blindness if not treated promptly. An ophthalmologist is a doctor who 
specializes in eyes.</P>
<P>Some infections, such as CMV, can cause problems with your eyes. Side 
effects of some drugs that you may be taking to treat or prevent infection can 
also affect your eyes. An experienced ophthalmologist will examine your eyes 
and do tests to determine if any problems you're having with vision are because 
of drug side effects, or an infection.</P> 
<P>Studies like the ones described on these two pages are showing that there are 
effective treatments for eye problems associated with HIV. If you need referral to 
an ophthalmologist, or are interested in a clinical trial mentioned here, call The 
Network.
Another drug trial for a new drug for the treatment of CMV retinitis is described 
below.</P>

<p><font size=3><b>New drug for CMV in trials</b></font><br>
Two new trials are studying a treatment for CMV retinitis. CMV retinitis is an 
infection caused by a virus. When CMV infection is in the eyes, it's called CMV 
retinitis. CMV retinitis can lead to blindness. Approved treatments for CMV 
require a permanent catheter and daily infusions of medication. A permanent 
catheter is a tube placed in your chest for getting the drug into your system. 
Other kinds of treatments are being studied in clinical trials. Some are 
described in this issue.</P>
<P>The treatment is called ISIS 2922. ISIS 2922 is an antisense drug. Antisense 
affects the way the CMV virus works. Antisense may be able to destroy the virus 
without harming the person. Current treatments that kill viruses and cancer cells 
may also destroy healthy cells in the body and weaken immune systems.</P>
<P>The first trial will study ISIS 2922 alone for the treatment of CMV retinitis. 
Participants will be divided into two groups. One group will be treated with the 
study drug. The other group will not be treated until disease progression is 
observed. The study drug is given by injection into the globe of the eye once a 
week for three weeks, and then once every other week. 
Each participant will be followed for approximately 20 weeks. Participants can 
continue treatment after the end of the study. To participate in this study, you 
must have newly diagnosed peripheral CMV retinitis in one eye. Peripheral 
means that it doesn't threaten your vision. You cannot have an opportunistic 
infection outside of the eye, including CMV in other parts of the body.</P>
<P>The second trial will study ISIS 2922 and ganciclovir. This trial will compare the 
combination of ISIS 2922 and ganciclovir to ganciclovir alone for the treatment 
of CMV retinitis. Participants must have CMV retinitis that has progressed at 
least once while being treated with ganciclovir or foscarnet. Participants will be 
divided into two groups. The first group will be treated with both drugs for three 
weeks, and then with ISIS 2922 alone. The second group will be treated with 
ganciclovir. ISIS 2922 will be given by injection into the globe of the eye once 
per week for three weeks and then once every other week. Ganciclovir is given 
by intravenous infusion. Participants will be followed for approximately 20 
weeks and will be offered the opportunity to continue therapy with ISIS 2922 
after this period. To participate, you must have CMV retinitis in one or both eyes 
that has progressed at least once while being treated with ganciclovir or 
foscarnet. You cannot be intolerant to ganciclovir. If you are interested in these 
studies, call The Network at (800) 734-7104.</P>

<p><font size=3><b>Good results from eye implant study</b></font><br>
CMV retinitis is an infection in the eye caused by the cytomegalovirus. CMV can 
also infect other parts of the body. Researchers have been studying a special 
implant that is put directly into an infected eye. The implant slowly releases 
ganciclovir, a drug used to treat CMV infection. When the infection is only in the 
eye, the implants have shown good results.</P>
<P>Between October 1992 and December 1993, study sites in Bethesda, Maryland 
and Atlanta, Georgia enrolled 26 participants with newly diagnosed CMV 
retinitis. Participants were divided into two groups. One group was given the 
implant immediately and the second group was given the implant if the retinitis 
got worse. Participants in the study had no progression of newly diagnosed 
CMV retinitis for about eight months using the ganciclovir implant. Among those 
who received no immediate treatment, the eye infection worsened in about 15 
days. Although surgery is required to use the implant, the procedure is 
performed under local anesthesia, takes less than one hour, and can be done 
on an outpatient basis.</P>
<P>The implants are designed to release ganciclovir over a period of months. The 
best time for replacement of the implant is unknown. In the study, the implants 
released the drug at different rates, making it hard to know when the implant 
needed to be replaced. The current information is that implants should be 
replaced after 32 weeks to lessen the likelihood of a relapse. Most participants 
in the study enjoyed good vision with the implant. By the final followup eye 
examination, 34 of 39 eyes treated with the implant had nearly perfect vision 
(20/25). The researchers also reported that nearly all affected eyes had blurred 
vision immediately after receiving the ganciclovir implant. Normal vision 
returned on average within 4 weeks.</P>
<P>Because the implant releases ganciclovir into the eye only, there is concern that 
those who receive the treatment may develop CMV infections in their unaffected 
eye and elsewhere in the body. In this study, the researchers reported a high 
rate of infection in the second eye. Of the 21 patients who entered the study with 
only one eye affected, 14 developed CMV retinitis in the other eye. Doctors 
treated 11 of these patients with ganciclovir implants in their second eye with 
similar good results. In addition, eight of the 26 study participants developed 
CMV infections in other organs. These patients were treated with either 
intravenous ganciclovir or foscarnet, the approved treatments for CMV.</P>
<P>A study comparing different treatments for CMV retinitis is enrolling. Participants 
will be divided into three groups. The first group will be treated with standard IV 
ganciclovir. The second group will be treated with a ganciclovir implant along 
with oral ganciclovir. The third group will be treated with an implant plus 
placebo. In the two groups receiving the implant and oral ganciclovir or 
placebo, neither the participant nor the doctor will know if they are taking oral 
ganciclovir or placebo. To participate, you must only have CMV retinitis in one 
eye. Participants who develop CMV disease in other parts of their body must go 
off the study but may receive an implant and oral ganciclovir. Clinic visits will be 
every 2 weeks.</P>
<P>The implant is also available from the drug company through a compassionate 
use program if you are unable to take other treatments. Call The Network for 
more information.</P>

<p><font size=3><b>Treatment for Retinal Detachments</b></font><br>
A treatment called Adatomed Silicone Oil has been approved by the FDA for 
treatment of detached retinas. Detached retinas can be a symptom of CMV 
infection in the eyes, which is called CMV retinitis. In reviewing the data from 
clinical trials, the FDA found that Adatomed was the most effective treatment for 
retinal detachments caused by CMV retinitis. Use of silicone oil for retinal 
detachment requires surgery.</P>

<p><font size=3><b>Oral Ganciclovir for Maintenance</b></font><br>
Ganciclovir is a drug used to treat cytomagalovirus (CMV) infection. The drug is 
given through a permanently placed catheter. The catheter is a tube that goes 
into a large vein in the chest. The first part of ganciclovir treatment is called 
induction therapy. After the infection is under control, you have to go on 
maintenance therapy, which means daily infusions of ganciclovir at a lower 
dose.</P>
<P>A pill form of the drug has been developed. Oral ganciclovir has been in clinical 
trials as a maintenance treatment after induction therapy with IV ganciclovir. 
Syntex, the company that makes oral ganciclovir, has applied to the FDA for 
approval of the drug as an alternative to IV ganciclovir for maintenance therapy.</P> 
<P>Oral ganciclovir is not yet on the market in any country.
The FDA voted to recommend that the company's New Drug Application for oral 
ganciclovir be approved. One newsletter reports that the committee in charge of 
making the recommendations was hesitant to recommend oral ganciclovir for 
prevention of CMV because there is the threat of creating resistance to the drug 
and because of its high cost. The drug company will not discuss the cost of the 
drug until it is approved for marketing.</P>
<P>Resistance may develop to IV ganciclovir as well. But most people would prefer 
taking the pills to daily infusions, even though you may have to take as many as 
12 pills a day. The oral form would also lessen the risk of infections at the 
catheter site. Syntex has a compassionate use program to make oral 
ganciclovir available to those who cannot take the drug intravenously. Doctors 
can call (800) 569-4630 for more information. A trial studying oral ganciclovir for 
the treatment of CMV in children is also open.</P>

<p><font size=3><b>Oral Ganciclovir Approved</b></font><br>
Oral ganciclovir received approval for marketing from the FDA on January 5, 
1995. Oral ganciclovir is a pill. The pill can be used for maintenance for some 
people, although intravenous ganciclovir is still necessary for initial treatment.</P> 
<p>The FDA has recommended that oral ganciclovir be used only for those "for 
whom the risk of more rapid disease progression is balanced by the benefit 
associated with avoiding daily IV infusions."</P>

<p><font size=3><b>One person's story</b></font><br>
<FONT="1"><I>A Network member has contributed the following article. The article was 
originally found online, posted to one of the computer message boards the 
Network reads for current information about HIV and AIDS. The article was 
edited for Treatment Review with the author's permission.</I></P>
<P>I have had HIV since 1981. I picked it up from a blood transfusion following a 
collapsed lung. I know I wouldn't be alive today if it weren't for my determination 
in directing my own treatment, and my computer for staying on top of things. My 
T4 cell count is probably around 25 by now, and up until this point I haven't had 
any major opportunistic infections. I started actively treating my situation about 5 
years ago when I found out I was HIV+. Used straight AZT. Was having the runs 
and no energy. Laying in bed most of the day. Tried levamisol and it cleared up 
the runs. My count kept dropping and I began to feel after a while that the AZT 
wasn't really working. I asked my doctor to get me on the ddI trial. He was 
against it, thinking it caused irreversible neuropathy. I began losing weight and 
feeling bad.</P> 
<P>At my insistence, the doctor reluctantly agreed to put me on ddI. What a big 
difference. I immediately began to feel better, my weight and energy came back. 
But after a few months, the neuropathy began to set in, and continued even 
though I reduced the doses by half. Then I read about the trial results combining 
ddC with AZT. ddC was available at the buyer's clubs at that time, so I got some 
and started the combination. That combo worked great for me for years. 
When my count dropped below 200, my doctor gave me a prescription for 
aerosolized pentamidine for PCP prevention. I had read that some people felt 
that pentamadine had caused lung problems in certain individuals. Since I had 
a collapsed lung earlier, and had a history of asthma, I was hesitant about the 
use of pentamidine, and delayed using it. Then I read early information 
indicating that 3 Septra tablets per week was working at least as well as 
pentamidine, and had the additional benefit of keeping other bugs away from 
other parts of the body besides the lungs. I started the Septra, never had PCP, 
and discovered that some peculiar lumps and bumps disappeared when I 
began taking the Septra.</P>
<P>I also became convinced from what I read of the benefits of taking 800 mg of 
Zovirax daily, and added that to my daily regimen. For years the combination of 
AZT/ddC, Zovirax, Septra, and occasional Levamisole kept me feeling fine. 
Then every once in a while I began feeling tired again, and was getting cramps 
in my left leg, and I had a tendency to drag it when I walked. I had read about 
the use of Trental which was thought to be good for PWA's because it 
supposedly reduced TNF in the blood. I began taking 3 Trentals a day, along 
with the AZT/ddC combination, and after just 3 or 4 days, I began to feel better 
again - no leg cramps and more energy. This seemed to work fine, and I would 
only take the Trental when it seemed necessary.</P>
<P>About 6 months ago I learned that many people were doing very well on d4T, 
and decided to replace the AZT/ddC/Trental combo with the d4T. d4T made me 
very hyper and, although I had plenty of energy and was never tired, I began 
slowly losing weight, and then eventually began to get very tired. I think the d4T 
affected my whole metabolism, and that I always felt like my whole system was 
speeded up. I felt like I was tired not due to malabsorption or any intestinal 
problem, but because my muscles were wasting away so much. I went off the 
d4T and back to the AZT/ddC/Trental combo, but saw no improvement after a 
month.</P> 
<P>Then I got to thinking that I had read where high TNF levels were thought to 
cause metabolic changes and wasting. The NY buyers club told me about a 
German drug, Ketotofin, that was approved over there as an antihistamine, but 
that was also proven to lower TNF levels in PWA's. Ketotofin also has the 
additional side-benefit of having high activity in the skin, and helps with itching, 
etc. I began taking Ketotofin a few months ago.</P> 
<P>I also began lifting weights in an effort to increase my lean body-mass. The 
difference has been simply unbelievable. I am gaining weight - not fat, but 
muscle. I have tremendous energy, except after strenuous work-outs, feel less 
hyper etc. I'm 52 and always have been in pretty good shape, swimming and 
windsurfing up until a couple of years ago, but I was so tired and weak a couple 
of months ago, that I really didn't think my body would respond to weight 
training. But it has, to a degree greater than I hoped for. I take a high-protein 
supplement called Met-Rx ( 3 times the amount of protein than in Ensure at 
about the same price) along with my weight program. I work out 3 times a week, 
1 1/2 hours at a time. I thought I was going to die after my first few workouts, 
even though I tried to take it easy because of the heart etc.
So here I am, 52, HIV+ since '81, weight training, and actually feeling at least as 
good as I've ever felt in the past 15 years. The next thing I'm trying to do is get 
ahold of 3TC. The combination with AZT seems to work far better than anything 
else to date. I think what I've learned through all of this is the great importance 
of staying on top of new developments in the field myself and never to place the 
responsibility for my care totally and blindly in the hands of a doctor. Most 
everything that really worked for me was not something initiated by a doctor, but 
by my own knowledge learned by research, and by continually trying new 
things when old treatments weren't working. I knew too many people who are 
no longer alive, who did nothing more than AZT and pentamidine until the fatal 
opportunistic infections set in. I would see them failing little by little, and 
suggested other treatments besides AZT. They never did, always feeling that 
the "Doctor knows best, I'll leave it in his hands." All of the PWA's I've known 
with that attitude are gone. I find some of my best sources of knowledge to be 
the following:</P>
<P>1. Aids Treatment News, which I get with my computer and modem, and save. 
I've got all the issues going back a couple of years on computer, so it makes it 
easy to use a word processing program to go back and search on any particular 
topic, like "wasting," etc. All of these back issues can be conveniently 
downloaded from computer server called AEGIS.</P>
<P>2. By calling the buyer's clubs in New York, Atlanta, etc., and just asking what's 
new and what's working?</P>
<P>3. I keep a folder on Compuserve, another computer service, using the key word 
"AIDS" so that all the news articles containing the word AIDS are saved for me, 
and every once in a while I pick up a lead that points to a new direction.</P>
<P>I started off just writing you to let you know that yes, there is someone else out 
there who has been HIV+ for at least 13 years, and things got sort of lengthy. I 
just figured that maybe I, and probably you, have been doing something right 
that perhaps could help someone else for the better. Let me know what you've 
been doing to stay alive all these years. One other thing I forgot to mention - 
meditation has had a dramatic affect on allowing me to concentrate, relax, and 
deal with stressful situations.

<p><font size=3><b>Salasalate for HIV</b></font><br>
One of the symptoms of HIV infection is inflammation. Aspirin is known to help 
reduce inflammation. But aspirin has side effects that may be harmful to 
someone who is HIV+. Aspirin can cause bleeding of the stomach lining and, if 
you are already having trouble digesting food, or have an infection in your 
stomach, that's the last thing you want. A newly opened trial will study 
salasalate for the treatment of HIV infection. Salasalate is related to aspirin but 
doesn't have the same effects on the stomach lining. Participants in this trial will 
be divided into two groups. One group will be treated with the study drug. The 
other group will be treated with placebo. Neither the doctor nor the participant 
will know which treatment is being given. Participants will take study drug or 
placebo twice a day. Visits to the clinic will be every other week for the first two 
months, and once a month after that until the end of study. To participate in this 
study, you must be HIV+. You may not take aspirin, or other non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory agents during the study. The study site is in New York City. Call 
The Network for more information. Please don't take aspirin on your own 
without consulting your doctor. You can also call the Project for Aspirin 
Research and Education at (310) 659-6965 for more information about aspirin's 
side effects and its potential as a treatment for HIV.</P>

<p><font size=3><b>Protein diet study</b></font><br>
A protein diet study is looking for a few more people to volunteer. This study will 
compare normal to restricted protein diets. Participants will be divided into three 
groups. One group will be HIV+ with T4 cell counts over 500. The second group 
will be HIV+ with T4 cell counts under 500. The third control group will be HIV-
negative. All participants must be weight stable. Participants will be randomly 
assigned to either the normal or restricted protein diet. Each dietary period will 
last for five days. The diets are designed to maintain the participant's admission 
weight. Although the restricted diet contains a lot less protein than that of the 
Recommended Dietary Allowance, it is an amount which has no known risks 
associated with it when consumed for five days. Participants will be admitted to 
the hospital for two five day stays and receive $200 for each stay. This study 
takes place in New York City. Call The Network if you are interested in 
participating.</P>

<h2 align=center>Treatment Review #15</h2> 
<h3 align=center>December 1994</h3> 

<blockquote><font size=2><p>Contents: MAC treatment and prevention; Human growth hormone; Chronic diarrhea; Flu shots; molluscum; Treatment for detached retinas; Sulfasalazine for HIV: possible anti-HIV treatment; Treatment at home; Information gathering studies: GYN care, male couples study, counseling and therapy; Weight loss and HIV; Thalidomide for wasting; Insulin-like growth factor for wasting; 3TC for HIV; Peptide T for dementia - new study open</P>

<p><font size=3><b> MAC: Treatment and Prevention</b></font><br> 

Mycobacterium avium complex, or MAC, is a serious bacterial infection that HIV+ people can get. MAC is related to tuberculosis. MAC is also sometimes called MAI, which stands for Mycobacterium avium intracellular. MAI more specifically refers to the infection when it is in blood cells. MAC infection is usually found only in people with under 50 T4 cells. </p><p>

The symptoms of MAC can include weight loss, fevers, chills, night sweats, swollen glands, abdominal pains, diarrhea and overall weakness. MAC usually affects the intestines and inner organs first, causing liver tests to be high. Swelling and inflammation also occur. </p><p>

A multi-center trial has shown that rifabutin, or Mycobutin, can nearly cut in half the rate at which people develop MAC. The drug is approved for prevention of MAC. The most serious side effects of rifabutin are low white blood-cell counts and elevated liver enzymes. Very few people in trials had to discontinue the drug because of toxicity. Other side effects of rifabutin can be kidney and liver complications, and an inflammation of the eye called uveitis. </p><p>

Uveitis can cause blindness. If you are taking rifabutin, be sure and report any eye complications to your doctor right away. Symptoms of uveitis include eye pain, light sensitivity, redness and blurred vision. </p><p>

Rifabutin is also being studied as part of a combination of drugs for treating MAC in people with less than 200 T4 cells. Just a few years ago, may doctors thought MAC was untreatable. There is no standard treatment approved for MAC infection. Most doctors use two to five drugs in combination. All the drugs are antibiotics. Combination drug treatments are used because MAC can become resistant to single treatments. By using drugs in combination, the doctor hopes to avoid resistance to treatment. If you're taking AZT, the rifabutin can affect the amount of AZT in your blood. A decreased available amount of AZT would make the AZT less effective against HIV. </p><p>

Researchers in London have seen antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis after treatment with antibiotics, including rifampicin. Rifampicin is related to rifabutin. When rifabutin was used to treat 22 HIV+ people known or thought to have MAC infections, four of the people developed Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea. Two of those people went on to develop colitis. Both infections are very difficult to treat. Because the incidence of antibiotic- associated diarrhea/colitis with rifabutin is unkown, the researchers caution against its widespread use until this association is clarified. Biaxin, or clarithromycin, is used almost as much as rifabutin for treatment and prevention. Clarithromycin may lower levels of rifabutin and AZT in the blood. Other side effects of clarithromycin can be stomach pain, diarrhea, and change in taste. </p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Human Growth Hormone </b></font><br>

Serostim, the first growth hormone type treatment proven to help people with AIDS to increase their weight by building muscle is not available at this time. The last issue of Treatment Review published a contact number for doctors to call in Canada to obtain this treatment. A recent issue of AIDS Treatment News (ATN), a newsletter from San Francisco published by John James, reports that the phone number has been disconnected. According to ATN, access to the program was cut off after the lawyers for the drug company that makes the drug got a letter from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) saying the drug was not approved for importing for compassionate use at this time. </p><p>

Serostim is a drug called human growth hormone. Human growth hormone is made and sold in the United States by two companies, Genentech and Lilly. It can only be prescribed for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency in children. The FDA controls the off-label use of human growth hormone because of the potential of abuse by athletes. Also, some parents have complained to the FDA that growth hormone is being aggressively marketed to kids who have not yet reached their full height. The drug is very expensive. Until it's approved for treating weight loss associated with HIV infection, insurance companies won't pay for it. There was some hope that people who could afford it might be able to get it from Canada. The first results from a small-scale clinical trial were encouraging and generated a great deal of interest. </p><p>

Serono has applied to the FDA for permission to start a treatment IND program. IND stands for Investigational New Drug, and is the label for continuing study of a drug. The drug company has to be willing to provide the drug, and the doctor has to be willing and able to monitor any patient receiving a drug through this type of program. Drug companies are allowed to charge for a treatment IND drug, but none have.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Chronic Diarrhea</b></font><br> 

Diarrhea is a common symptom of HIV infection. When diarrhea is chronic, which means it doesn't stop by itself, your body loses water and important nutrients. This is known as dehydration. Dehydration can be dangerous. Replacing lost water and nutrients is very important. A new study is comparing two kinds of replacement therapy (oral rehydration). The trial compares two kinds of oral rehydration solutions. </p><p>

The use of oral rehydration solutions (ORS) in developing countries has been shown to be helpful in treating children with acute watery diarrhea. An ORS containing short-chained sugar molecules called oligosaccharides lowers stool output and reduces diarrhea. Each participant in this trial will receive either standard glucose-based ORS, or oligosaccharide-based ORS. Hydration status will be monitored at 2 and 4 weeks. Questionnaires regarding quality of life will also be filled out. At the end of the study, participants will be offered the option of continuing ORS therapy. To participate in this trial, you must be HIV+, 18 years or older, with chronic diarrhea defined as 3 or more diarrheal movements at least 3 times per week for at least 3 weeks. </p><p>

If you are interested in participating in this trial, call The Network at (800) 858- 2111. If you are having diarrhea, talking with a registered dietician who works with people with HIV and AIDS may be helpful. The dietician will ask you what you usually eat, and discuss what foods it might be helpful to add or eliminate from your diet. Call The Network if you would like a referral to a dietician, or a fact sheet about diarrhea or nutrition.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Flu Shots </b></font><br>

A recent report from researchers at San Francisco's Medical Center (UCSF) have raised important concerns about flu shots. It's possible that a flu shot may raise levels of HIV in your blood without protecting you from the flu. A vaccine stimulates the immune system to make antibodies. There is evidence that any vaccine that stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies also stimulates replication of HIV. Most participants in the study at UCSF had three times the normal amount of HIV in their blood for a short time after getting vaccinated. Then when the immune system had done its work, viral replication slowed, and viral burden decreased to pre-shot levels. In people with T4 cells under 200, only about 40% mount an effective immune response to the vaccine, leaving the rest vulnerable to the flu. </p><p>

One of the ways The Network keeps up with current information is by reading computer bulletin boards and other on-line services. This is one aspect of the Internet that you may have heard about. A doctor with a large HIV+ practice who provides reliable on-line information about treatments makes these points: 1. One of the main complications of flu is bacterial pneumonia, which people with HIV are already at higher risk for. 2. People with bad flu could have the symptoms of more serious infections, and undergo unnecessary work-ups. 3. If the flu vaccine alone causes increase in viral replication, then having the flu is probably worse. Should you get a flu shot or not? Depending on your T cell level, the information provided here is something to discuss with your doctor.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Molluscum</b></font><br> 

Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a common and difficult skin condition for people with HIV infection. It shows up as tiny bumps, often on the face. The bumps are known as lesions. The lesions usually occur as flesh-colored, pearly, raised but firm, non-tender nodules. Infection with the virus that causes MC is common in children. Lesions can appear on the face, arms, legs, and the skin between the genitals and anus. Some researchers think that 90% of adults have been infected with MC without the appearance of lesions. </p><p>

Different treatments are available, although they are not always successful in getting rid of the molluscum, which can come back even when it's treated. Sometimes it goes away by itself, but not often. Some doctors use drops of liquid nitrogen to destroy molluscum lesions. Others apply a small electric current with a needle. Researchers do not know precisely how MC spreads. Some think it spreads from one region of the skin to another through cuts in the skin. So if you have MC on your face, shaving may cause it to spread. Discuss with your doctor whether it would be helpful to use an antibiotic solution like Betadine scrub on your face before shaving. Peeling agents are sometimes used to remove the lesions. Larger lesions usually require local anesthetic, and cutting or scraping. The doctor or dermatologist has to remove the core, or body of the lesion to be certain it is gotten rid of. Sometimes this is done with an electric charge with a small needle to the top of the lesion, followed by cutting out the core of the molluscum. This kind of surgical removal can be painful and take a long time, because there can be hundreds of the tiny lesions. But if less intrusive treatments don't work, this may be necessary.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Treatment for Eyes </b></font><br>

A treatment called Adatomed Silicone Oil has been approved by the FDA for treatment of detached retinas. Detached retinas can be a symptom of CMV infection in the eyes, which is called CMV retinitis. In reviewing the data from clinical trials, the FDA found that Adatomed was the most effective treatment for retinal detachments caused by CMV retinitis.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Sulfasalazine for HIV </b></font><br>

Sulfasalazine is a drug used for the treatment of arthritis. Arthritis is an autoimmune disease, which is when the immune system starts attacking itself. People with HIV/AIDS may develop automimmune problems such as painful joints/bones/muscles and dry mouth that's not caused by drugs, among other symptoms. Doctors in New York noticed that when they treated 4 HIV+ people who had arthritis with sulfasalazine, their T4 cell counts also increased. </p><p>

A trial to study sulfasalazine for the treatment of HIV infection is open. The purpose of the trial is to see if sulfasalazine can raise T4 cell counts. The trial is also looking for the most effective dose. When sulfasalazine is swallowed, it's broken down into a chemical related to aspirin. The chemical, called 5-ASA, reduces inflammation and pain. Sulfasalazine may be useful because it can have aspirin-like effects without causing bleeding in the stomach or intestines. </p><p>

 Participants in this trial will be divided into two groups. The first group will be treated with sulfasalazine. The second group will be treated with placebo. Neither the participant nor the doctor will know which treatment is being given. Both the sulfasalazine and the placebo are pills. Everyone will take two pills a day for the first four days. The dosage will be increased by one pill daily for the following 4 days to a total of four pills daily in divided doses. </p><p>

Clinic visits are required once a week for the first two weeks and then every other week. Total time on study is 16 weeks. To participate in this study, you must be HIV+ and 18 years or older. If you are taking AZT or another antiretroviral, you must have been on a stable dose for 4 months which you will continue during the trial. You cannot have diagnosed arthritis, significant liver or kidney disease, or be under current treatment for a major opportunistic infection such as PCP or toxoplasmosis. You may not have a history of sensitivity to salicylates or sulfa- containing drugs, or have taken an experimental treatment for three months before starting the study. Sulfasalazine has been safely used for treating arthritis in people who are HIV+. It is a sulfa drug. The main side effects can headaches, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. If you are interested in participating in this trial, call The Network and we will put you in touch with the study coordinator.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Treatment at Home </b></font><br>

Staying out of the hospital doesn't just save you and your insurance company money, though that is an important consideration. Staying out of the hospital can also help keep your spirits up, because you will feel more in control of your treatment instead of feeling like you've been taken away from your life and put in a hospital bed where others are making decisions for you. And most importantly, staying out of the hospital can mean avoiding infections you can get during a hospital stay, especially if you have to be in for a long time. </p><p>

Although development of drugs for the treatment of HIV infection can seem maddeningly slow, progress has been made in prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections associated with HIV. What's the old saying - an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure? You may be taking more than an ounce of pills and vitamins every day to hold an infection in check, or to make sure you don't get one you've been exposed to. But as people are living longer with HIV, staying out of the hospital becomes a goal along with prevention. </p><p>

Diseases that people get while in the hospital are called nosocomial infections. Most nosocomial infections are bacterial. Most people can successfully fight them off, but people with compromised immune systems are more susceptible to getting infections. Staph and some pneumonias are bacterial infections. Bacteria are everywhere - on clothing, walls, blankets, and medical equipment. Hospital workers can pass them on by hand. Some bacteria cling to plastic and travel up tubes inserted into the body. </p><p>

If you need to go into the hospital, this is not meant to scare you more. Some procedures can only be done in the hospital. But many can be done at home. Even intravenous treatments that used to be considered too complicated and difficult to be done outside the hospital can now be done at home. Your doctor and a home health care service will work with you to make sure you know how to give yourself the treatment, and how to dispose of the needles, tubes and the other things used for your medical care. If you do have to go into the hospital, talk to your doctor about how long you might have to stay in, and if arrangements can be made to continue treatment at home. Private insurance companies, Medicaid, and New York State's AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP Home Care) all pay for home care services.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Helping to Gather Information</b></font><br> 

Information gathering studies are an important source of data that help researchers, doctors, and people with HIV/AIDS understand the disease and how it progresses. Information gathering studies usually don't include a drug treatment, but are only meant to look at how specific parts of a participant's life and health are affected. Although the studies don't provide treatment, they can provide you with routine care, without waiting in a crowded clinic. Routine care with any infection is important in keeping track of how well you're doing, and if a particular treatment is necessary. In exchange for your participation, you will receive regular care. The data gathered from you and the other participants can be used for identifying areas of research, including treatment trials. Anyone participating in a clinical trial is doing a great service for all of us. Participating in an information gathering study is an equally important commitment you may be interested in making. Several information gathering studies are described below. Call The Network if you are interested in these, or other information gatherings studies that we know about.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Routine GYN Care for Women </b></font><br>

This information gathering study provides routine gynecological care to women with HIV infection. The study hopes to more clearly define the relationship between the degree of immunosuppression with the risk for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer. Participants will be followed for a minimum of 24 months. The only requirement for participating in this study is that you be a woman who is HIV+.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Male Couples Study </b></font><br>

This information gathering study will look at social and sexual issues that come up for male couples in which one person is HIV+ and the other is not. The interview is approximately one hour. Sexual behavior and practices will be discussed, as well as mental health issues. All interviewers are bilingual, and the study coordinators are looking for both English and Spanish speaking couples. Any sensitive questions do not have to be answered and all the information is confidential. You do not have to give your name if you don't want to. Couples are paid $40 for their participation in this study. This study is being done at Columbia University in New York City. Call The Network for more information.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Counseling and Therapy Studies</b></font><br> 

Psychological counseling can be helpful in coping with HIV and AIDS. But paying for therapy can be expensive, especially if you are on a limited income. The two studies described below may be able to help you with up to 17 weeks of therapy. At the same time you are helping to collect information about the kind of counseling that is most useful to people who are HIV+. Free and ongoing testing and counseling is available with testing repeated every six months. Participants receive regular counseling about safer sex and other HIV- related issues. The Network contacted the study site to ask if participants could be anonymous and was told that people have used made-up names in the past. Only a number is put on records and all data is in locked cabinets with no release of information to third parties. The person we spoke to at the study site said they just need a name in order to be able to contact you easily to set up appointments. Call The Network if you would like the number to make an appointment for testing. This information gathering study is for HIV-negative and HIV+ participants. This site also has a study which provides 17 weeks of one- on-one therapy sessions for HIV+ individuals who are depressed, distressed or anxious. Participants are randomly assigned to one of 4 treatments. The treatments are different kinds of therapy, which the study coordinator will explain to you, or therapy plus an antidepressant medication called Tofranil. Follow-up of participants continues for one year. </p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Weight loss and HIV </b></font><br>

Weight loss associated with HIV infection is also known as wasting, because the rate at which a person can lose weight makes them look like they are wasting away. Wasting may be due to a number of reasons. These include: decreased nutritional intake; increased energy needs due to fever, infection, wound healing or rapid breathing; ineffective utilization of nutrients by the body and problems with absorption. Someone's desire and ability to eat can also change due to depression, lack of appetite, swallowing problems, altered taste due to disease or medications, feeling of fullness, nausea and vomiting. </p><p>

Diarrhea is often a cause of wasting. Diarrhea can be caused by infection and/or dietary factors. Some people with AIDS have lactose (milk sugar) intolerance, others have fat intolerance. Taking too much Vitamin C may also cause diarrhea. Lactose-free diets may be helpful, as may decreased fat intake or avoidance of certain fats in the diet. Consulting with a dietician who works with people with HIV and AIDS can help determine which foods you may need to avoid, and which can help control symptoms. The Network can refer you to a nutritionist. </p><p>

Putting weight back on is much harder than keeping it on, or increasing what you have. The goal of weight gain is the addition of lean tissue mass. While total body weight includes fat and water, lean tissue for muscles and vital organs is most important. Weight gain from fat and water is not as useful. Lean tissue is built through a combination of food that is high- calorie and rich in proteins and complex carbohydrates, and exercise, which converts food energy into muscle. Early intervention in treating wasting really means making every effort to prevent wasting. Regular exercise, along with a diet high in proteins and complex carbohydrates can help prevent weight loss. Preventing the infections that can cause diarrhea and lead to wasting is also very important. Some treatments are available and in studies for treating and hopefully reversing wasting. These are described below.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Thalidomide </b></font><br>

Thalidomide, a drug that was once prescribed as a sleeping pill, was banned in the early 1960s after it was found to cause deformed limbs in the children of women who took it early in pregnancy. Researchers have found that it may be a useful drug in treating symptoms of HIV infection, including wasting. Thalidomide is believed to work by interfering with the production of tumor necrosis factor, or TNF. It may also have other effects. </p><p>

TNF is a chemical produced by the immune system to fight tumors and infections. TNF levels are often high in people with AIDS. High TNF levels are associated with more rapid progression to AIDS and with the development of HIV related central nervous system disease. High levels of TNF are thought to contribute to HIV wasting syndrome. </p><p>

Celgene Corp. has started Phase II testing of its Synovir brand of thalidomide to treat weight loss in AIDS patients. The drug is used by some people with AIDS in the US, Canada and Brazil. Good results have been reported by individuals participating in the trial organized by Rockefeller University in New York City, particularly in controlling wasting and increasing weight and muscle. For information about thalidomide trials, call The Network. It may also be possible to get the drug if your doctor agrees to ask the drug company for it.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Insulin-like Growth Factor </b></font><br>

Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) is produced by the liver in response to human growth hormone. Many of growth hormone's effects may be the result of IGF-1. Human growth hormone is described in the article on serostim on page 3. A trial comparing growth hormone and IGF-1 for the treatment of children and adolescents with HIV infection is being conducted at the National Cancer Institute. To participate in this trial, you must be 6 to 18 years old with a failure to grow or less than normal weight or height. Participants will be divided into two groups. One group will be given IGF-1 twice a day. The second group will be given human growth hormone once a day. Both treatments are given by shot. Participants being given IGF-1 will have to be in the hospital for five days. Total time on study is 6 months.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>3TC - a new anti-HIV drug?</b></font><br> 

3TC, also known as lamivudine, is an antiretroviral that works in the same way as AZT, ddI, ddC and d4T. Researchers studying the drug reported in November of this year that the combination of 3TC and AZT was effective in improving laboratory tests of the immune system. Further trials of the drug to study its clinical benefits will begin next year, the company said. </p><p>

In two separate studies, HIV+ participants were given either AZT, or AZT in combination with 3TC. After 24 weeks, tests showed that study participants taking the combination therapy had an increased number of T cells and lower levels of virus in the blood. The people taking AZT alone either showed less improvement or got worse, according to their laboratory tests. These studies did not examine progression to illness, disease or death, but measured HIV's effects in the blood. People receiving the combination experienced an average gain of 85 T4 cells after eight weeks on study and maintained an increase of 80 T4 cells through week 24. At week 48, an increase of 49 T4 cells persisted. People receiving only AZT had their T4 cell counts drop by an average of seven at week 24. When switched to the combination treatment, these people showed an average increase of 40 T4 cells by week 48.</p><p> 

3TC is in Phase III trials in Europe and the Far East as a treatment for hepatitis B. Phase III trials are planned for the US, Canada and Japan in late 1994 and 1995. Side-effects seen in trials are fatigue and headaches. The company that makes the drug will file for approval of 3TC in the first half of 1995. The company expects to report results from two United States trials comparing AZT, 3TC and the two drugs in combination in late January. With the release of this information, the company's stock surged. Many analysts reacted skeptically, stating, "Popular press overreacts," and pointing out that three other AIDS drugs for use with AZT have already been approved. </p><p>

The data behind the report is based on six months of treatment and six months of follow-up. It is not know how well 3TC in combination with AZT would do if taken for a longer time. Currently, 3TC is in a clinical trial for children and adolescents in combination with AZT and ddI at the National Cancer Institute. If you would like more information about this trial, call The Network. 3TC is also available through an expanded access program from the drug company for both children and adults. Children can take the drug in syrup form. Adults take pills. Doctors can call (800) 248-9757 for more information.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Peptide T </b></font><br>

Protein is made up of amino acids. Peptide T, a drug made from strings of amino acids, is now being tested as a treatment for AIDS Dementia Complex (ADC) at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City. Peptide T has been tested as a treatment for AIDS, although no significant benefits were seen. Those receiving the drug in other studies had no side major effects. Some people reported an improvement in their quality of life, and constitutional symptoms. Call The Network for more information about this new study. </p><p>

Drug trials and treatment studies: Oral ganciclovir, Gem91, IL-1 receptor, BV-
ara-U, human growth hormone, Peptamen;Making a Difference by Marlene;
Information gathering studies; Surrogate Markers of HIV; Side effects of treatments</P>

<p><font size=3><b>Oral ganciclovir</b></font><br>
Ganciclovir is a drug used to treat CMV. CMV, which stands for 
cytomegalovirus, is a serious opportunistic infection that can lead to blindness 
and can also affect the intestines and lungs. Ganciclovir is given by IV injection, 
and requires permanent placement of a catheter. A pill form of the drug has 
been in studies both for prevention of CMV disease, and as a maintenance 
treatment. Maintenance treatment is to keep disease from spreading once it is 
under control. Oral ganciclovir is being studied to see if it can help prevent CMV 
disease. </p><p>
In one prevention study sponsored by Syntex, which makes the drug, 
participants with T4 cell counts of less than 100 were given the pill form of 
ganciclovir or a placebo. All studies are overseen by Safety Monitoring Boards. 
In this case, the study was stopped by its Data Safety Monitoring Board 
because there was less CMV disease, including CMV retinitis, seen in the 
participants who were getting the drug. Everybody on the study has now been 
given the drug, and they are still being followed to see if the drug continues to 
work. The study has been changed from a randomized to an open-label trial 
where everyone knows which treatment they are getting.</p><p>
CPCRA (Community Program for Clinical Research on AIDS) is an organization 
that does community based clinical trials at sites where people go for their 
primary care. An ongoing trial being done by the CPCRA to see if oral 
ganciclovir can prevent CMV retinitis has been changed so that people can 
either choose to get the drug or continue to be blinded, not knowing if they are 
getting the real drug or placebo. This trial is filled.</p><p>
Syntex has asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to allow them 
to sell oral ganciclovir for maintenance treatment of CMV disease based on 
earlier studies. This would be for continuing treatment after an active infection 
has already been brought under control. It is hoped Syntex will amend this 
request so that oral ganciclovir can be used for prevention of CMV disease as 
well.</p><p>
Oral ganciclovir is currently available from the drug company through an 
expanded access program for the maintenance treatment of CMV retinitis. You 
must have a history of having had a permanent central intravenous catheter 
removed at least twice within the previous six months due to catheter infection 
or thrombosis, or have a medical condition that would make placement or use of 
a permanent catheter inappro-priate or unfeasible. Enrollment into the 
expanded access program is through any licensed physician. Doctors can call 
(800) 569-4630 for information. Clinic visits are required at study entry, week 2, 
week 4, and every 4 weeks thereafter. Minimal ophthalmologic, current 
medication, and lab information will be collected at every visit. This is an open-
label protocol, so all participants will know which treatment they are getting.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Gem 91</b></font><br>
A new category of drugs, called antisense drugs, may be able to target a 
specific disease without causing significant side effects. In any virus, the genes 
have a sequence unique in nature. In theory, antisense could be made that will 
bind only to the virus RNA without binding to the human RNA, thereby 
destroying the virus without harming the person.</p><p>
A drug research company called Hybridon has developed an antisense anti-
HIV treatment called Gem91. Test-tube studies have shown Gem91 to be active 
against many isolates. Isolates are virus samples taken from different places. 
Unlike AZT, ddI and ddC, Gem91 appears to be active against HIV-infected 
macrophages. Macro-phages are types of cells known to be a major reservoir 
for HIV infection. Antisense drugs can't stop cells from becoming infected, but 
will hopefully stop the cells from making more virus. Neither the long-term safety 
nor how well the drug works has been proven. </p><p>
Test-tube studies of Gem91 showed that it shut down replication of the virus for 
more than 80 days in HIV-infected human cells. In early trials the drug was 
tolerated with no side effects. Further studies are necessary to see if Gem91 can 
stop the virus's ability to replicate so the immune system can effectively act 
against infection. </p><p>
A trial of Gem91 is enrolling in New York. This is an intensive Phase I trial 
requiring three weeks of hospitalization for IV therapy. Participants will be paid. 
For more information about this trial, call The Network at (800) 858-2111.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>New HIV and KS drug being studied</b></font><br>
A new drug that may help treat KS is being studied in people both with and 
without KS in New York City. The study is open to people with less than 300 T4 
cells. The drug is a receptor for IL-1. IL-1 is cytokine produced in response to 
infection or injury which causes inflammation. </p><p>
Cytokines are messengers, or communicators, produced by immune system 
cells. IL-1 has been associated with the growth of KS cells. This drug may be 
able to attract IL-1 and prevent it from causing disease progression. The name 
of the drug is rhu-IL1R, which stands for soluble recombinant interleukin-1 
receptor. </p><p>
To participate in this study, you must have been taking an approved 
antiretroviral, such as AZT or ddI, at a stable dose for at least 2 months. You 
cannot have active disease. For information about this study, or any other study 
or drug for KS or AIDS call The Network at (800) 858-2111.</p><p> 

<p><font size=3><b>BV-ara-U</b></font><br>
A study has shown that a drug called BV-ara-U cures shingles outbreaks in 
people faster than current treatments. Shingles outbreaks are due to infection 
with herpes zoster. The drug also only has to be taken once a day rather than 
five or three times a day like current medications. </p><p>
Larger trials of this treatment are expected to open soon. The Network includes 
all new and enrolling studies in The Experimental Treatment Guide, published 
four times a year. Call The Network if you would like a copy.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Human growth hormone</b></font><br>
An alternative to anabolic steroids is human growth hormone (rHGH), which is 
now being studied in people with AIDS. rHGH produced significant weight gain 
and increase in muscle strength among the men in two earlier trials. The weight 
gain does not last after therapy stops, so life-long treatment with this very 
expensive substance may be needed. Long-term side effects of treatment with 
rHGH supplementation are unknown. </p><p>
rHGH is a synthetic version of human growth hormone derived from the pituitary 
gland. It is made by genetic engineering, and has been approved in the US for 
several years for treating growth hormone deficiency in children. Side effects of 
rGHG include joint aches, fevers and high blood pressure. A study sponsored 
by Serono Laboratories Inc. has shown that human growth hormone can 
reverse AIDS-associated wasting. The drug is not yet approved by the FDA for 
this treatment. Serono is currently sponsoring another trial of the drug which will 
focus on its safety.</p><p>
Serostim is the brand name for Serono's version of rHGH. Serostim was 
recently approved for emergency compassionate use by the Health Protection 
Branch in Canada (1-800-935-8853). Canadian access must be through your 
doctor who must provide you with a prescription with appropriate dosing. A 
personal use statement must be submitted with the prescription and both must 
include the two names of the product, Serostim and recombinant human growth 
hormone. Canadian officials will expect cash up front. Some insurance 
companies may cover the cost of rHGH with receipts. The cost at the 
recommended dosage is $875 a week. </p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Peptamen for wasting</b></font><br>
A small new study for the treatment of wasting is open. This trial will study an 
elemental diet called Peptamen. Elemental diets are nutrition supplements that 
provide all dietary needs. To participate in this study, you must be HIV+ and 18 
years or older. You must have weight loss of greater than or equal to 5%, and 
diarrhea. You cannot have any infection that is identified as the cause for the 
diarrhea.</p><p>
The study can be done either through oral or enteral feeding, depending on 
how well you can absorb nutrients. Enteral feeding is done through a tube 
placed directly into the stomach through the skin. The study will look at how well 
Peptamen helps reduce the number of bowel movements, gastrointestinal 
symptoms, and weight loss. </p><p>
All participants will have biopsies done to find out if there is an infection causing 
diarrhea. On day 1-2 of the study, participants will be given a regular diet. On 
day 3-16, participants will be given Peptamen diet only. On days 17-19 the 
Peptamen is discontinued and participants will be given a regular diet. 
Participation can be as an in-patient or out-patient. Follow-up is for a total of 
three months. </p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Making a Difference: <br>A Report on the International Conference on AIDS in Japan</b></font><br>
<i>by Marlene Diaz. Marlene attends conferences as a representative of The Network and the 
Women's Project of the Peter Kruger Clinic at Beth Israel. Numbers used in this 
article with grateful acknowledgment are from the Manuscript for X International 
AIDS Conference, Women and AIDS, by Rebecca Denison, WORLD (Women 
Organized to Respond to Life-threatening Disease). WORLD is an information 
and support network based in Oakland, California. (510) 658-6390.)</i></p>
<p>I was one of the fortunate people who received a scholarship from the NIH to go 
to the International AIDS Conference in Yokohama, Japan. Although I didn't see 
much of the country I met many people who shared one common goal - to better 
understand and perhaps find a cure for AIDS.</p>

<p>Japan is not an HIV friendly country, but the people in Yokohama were there 
because they wanted to be there; besides medical people who had a vested 
interest in being there, there were many people who volunteered their time.
The opening ceremony lacked substance other than when a representative of 
GNP (Global Network of People with AIDS) spoke frankly about the negative 
climate in Japan towards people with HIV. When he asked everyone in the 
audience who was seropositive to stand up, and 25% of the crowd did, it was a 
very moving experience. I think that this public display of our presence was 
possibly one of the most important messages conveyed to the conference 
attendees.</p><p>
I focused on sessions dealing with issues relating to women and children. In 
contrast to last year's conference, which offered "no good news," this year's 
conference seemed to dwell on the apparent efficacy of AZT in reducing 
perinatal transmission. There was no word, however, on using AZT in 
newborns.</p><p>
As a mother of an HIV positive toddler, I was glad to hear about a possible non-
invasive HIV antibody test using saliva instead of blood.</p>

<p><b>Some pediatric news</b><br>
A nine-year compilation of data from a pediatric clinic in Brazil stated the 
importance of a holistic approach: diet, psychosocial, immunization, propolis, IV 
gamma globulin, and use of AZT only in symptomatic children.</p><p>
The ACTG 128 study concluded that low dose AZT (90 mg) works just as well as 
high dose AZT (180 mg). The advantage of this is a 50% reduction in cost as 
well as less toxicity.</p><p>
Physically, HIV is more aggressive in children than in adults. Emotionally, 
children are traumatized by watching their family unit collapse. Many of them 
drop out of school. A major problem is the very limited childcare and support for 
orphans. To date, there are approximately 18,500 orphaned children as a result 
of AIDS and by the year 2000 there are expected to be 80,000 orphans! </p><p>
The women's round table discussion I attended increased my awareness of the 
global impact of HIV/AIDS on women. Worldwide, 3,000 women are infected 
with the HIV virus daily, and 500 women will die of AIDS every day.
Children who have been infected through incest or other sexual assault almost 
never get any treatment at all. </p><p>
Another silent and underrepresented group of infected individuals are our 
children that are getting infected through incest or other sexual assault. 32% of 
adolescents between the ages of 11 and 17 years old have been sexually 
assaulted. 29% of children under the age of 11 have been raped. Another 
disturbing statistic is that 1 in 3 girls and 1 in 6 boys are sexually assaulted by 
age 18.</p><p>
Many men make the mistake of thinking that young women are safe. In 
underdeveloped countries young girls have no alternative but to sell their 
bodies to support their family. Fear of pregnancy leads them to engage in anal 
intercourse, which puts them at higher risk of HIV infection.</p><p>
Certain countries still practice sexual mutilation on small girls - usually between 
the ages of 4 and 8. HIV is often transmitted secondary to lack of equipment 
sterilization.</p><p>
Female controlled prevention was another interesting topic. It emphasized how 
sexual transmission could be prevented through abstinence, monogamy, 
reducing the amount of partners and treating STDs. Unfortunately, economic as 
well as social factors make this difficult. Twenty five percent of the world's 
households are led by women. Due to lack of funds, some women barter sex for 
money, rent, food or clothes for themselves and their family. Socially, some 
cultures condone multiple partners for men. There are very varied social and 
religious beliefs in other countries. In Brazil, anal intercourse is practiced to 
preserve virginity. In India, vaginal burning, itching and discharge are 
considered a "women's lot" and are not considered an STD. Catholicism forbids 
the use of condoms making it more difficult for women to practice the use of 
condoms.</p><p>
The message was clear - what we need most to halt the spread of AIDS is 
education. We need to educate entire communities and we need to tailor it to 
each group's special needs. Boys and men must share in the family 
responsibility rather than leaving the burden on women who are considered 
"core transmitters" in some countries. We shouldn't just preach empowerment - 
we should go the extra mile and offer resources, ie: legal advocacy, condoms, 
education. We must also incorporate this outreach to include gay and lesbian 
teens and children. We must listen to them and hear what they're saying! We 
must provide non-judgemental quality support groups.</p><p>
The battle to fight HIV/AIDS must be multi-directional. The scientific community 
must continue to explore all aspects of treatment modalities. They should leave 
no stone unturned; however, just as important is controlling and limiting the 
amounts of new cases. This is in our hands. We must provide very graphic 
education, very early on, to make a difference!</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Echocardiogram study</b></font><br>
This information gathering study will examine cardiac manifestations of HIV 
infection. All echocardiographic studies to date have focused primarily on 
people with AIDS. This study will focus on people with HIV infection to gather 
information on progressive cardiac involvement. All participants will be given a 
physical exam and screened for length of HIV status, cardiac risks, drug history, 
T cell count, and medical history. Echocardiograms will be done at study entry 
and every six months after that. Total time on study is 18 months.</p><p>
To participate in this information gathering study, you must be HIV+ and 18 
years or older. You cannot have AIDS or underlying cardiovascular disease, 
including hypertension and angina. </p><p>
Information gathering studies do not test drugs or provide you with treatment for 
infection. But they do provide you and the researchers with information about 
HIV and AIDS, and how the infection shows up in your body. Using this 
information, researchers work to find more effective ways of treating infection 
and symptoms. While an echocardiogram may not be a routine part of your 
physical, participating in a study such as this one can give you and your doctor 
additional information in discussing your treatments.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>$ for information gathering study</b></font><br>
A site in Connecticut is doing an information gathering study which pays 
participants. If you live in Connecticut or can get there easily, call The Network 
for more information.</p><p>
This is an information gathering study with no treatment. The study will look at 
how particular blood cells and signalling between cells are affected by HIV. You 
must be HIV+ to participate in this study. Two visits to the clinic are required: 
one screening visit and one visit for a morning blood draw. All participants will 
be paid $75. If you are interested in this study, call The Network at (800) 858-
2111 for more information.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>New Tests for Virus</b></font><br>
<I>by Richard Jefferys. Richard is director of The Access Project, which provides information to people 
with HIV and AIDS and their care providers nationwide about local AIDS drug 
programs and Medicaid and Medicare provisions specific to HIV and AIDS. He 
reports here on a recent conference on surrogate markers.</I></p>

<p><b>What is a surrogate marker?</b><br>
In HIV disease it's hard to tell if someone is getting sicker unless they have 
symptoms or infections. Symptoms or infections usually mean the disease has 
already damaged the immune system. Scientists want to try and find ways to 
measure how much harm HIV is doing to someones body before these 
symptoms and infections happen. The number of T4 cells you have per milliliter 
of blood is used as a surrogate marker of how far HIV disease has progressed. 
A surrogate is a substitute for something. T4 cell counts are a substitute for 
symptoms when monitoring the health of someone with HIV.</p><p>
<b>Why are surrogate markers important?</b><br>
T4 cell counts give a doctor information on when certain treatments or 
preventive medications should be prescribed. T4 cell counts are also used in 
drug trials to measure how well a new drug works against HIV so people who 
don't have other treatment choices can get a drug without waiting years for 
proof that it extends life or reduces symptoms. Most drugs currently used 
against HIV were approved by the government based on the effect they had on 
T4 cell count. </p><p>
<b>What was the reason for this conference?</b><br>
A good surrogate marker should tell us how a person with HIV disease is doing. 
Unfortunately, T4 cell counts don't always do this. Some people with high T4 
cell counts may get symptoms of HIV disease. Some people with very low T4 
cell counts feel fine. This conference brought together scientists and activists to 
discuss how best to use surrogate markers in HIV disease.</p><p>
The newest surrogate marker being talked about was viral load. Viral load 
means the amount of HIV in the blood. Two tests can measure how much HIV is 
in a milliliter of blood by counting copies of HIV RNA. RNA is the part of HIV that 
makes more virus when it infects human cells. HIV needs two pieces of RNA to 
work properly, so if there are 100,000 copies of HIV RNA in a milliliter of blood, 
that means 50,000 pieces (often called particles or virions) of virus. </p><p>
One test is made by the Roche pharmaceutical company and is called the PCR 
(polymerase chain reaction) test. The other is made by a company called 
Chiron and is called the bDNA (branched DNA) test. It is hoped that measuring 
the amount of virus with these tests will give a better idea of disease 
progression than just looking at T4 cell count.</p><p>
Scientists need to prove that the viral load in the blood is connected with how 
someone with HIV disease is doing. The evidence presented at this conference 
seemed to indicate that there is a connection, but more research needs to be 
done. </p><p>
An advisory panel of scientists, researchers and activists reviewed the different 
surrogate markers being used in HIV disease. These fall into two categories:</p><p>
- Markers that try to measure how well the immune system is doing. Scientists 
call these immunolgic markers. T4 cell count is an immunolgic marker as it 
gives us an idea of how much damage has been done to the immune system by 
HIV.</p><p>
- Markers that try to measure the activity of the HIV virus itself. These are called 
virologic markers. The amount of HIV RNA in the blood (viral load) is a virologic 
marker as it looks at the virus directly, not at the damage that it's causing.
One of the problems with viral load measurements is that they're only looking in 
the bloodstream. HIV often gathers in parts of the body called lymph nodes. </p><p>
Cells of the immune system including T4 cells pass through these lymph nodes 
as they patrol the body, and can become infected by the HIV virus gathered 
there. Viral load tests do not measure the amount of virus in the lymph node. 
One of the experimental tests discussed at this conference involves measuring 
the amount of virus in the lymph node using a technique called fine needle 
aspiration. A needle inserted into the lymph tissue removes cells. Further 
studies of this test are underway to see if it might help give an even clearer 
picture of HIV disease progression.</p><p>
Another test being studied that could provide another surrogate marker of 
disease progression is a lymphocyte function test. Lymphocytes are cells of the 
immune system. T4 cells are one type of lymphocyte. This test measures how 
well these immune system cells are actually working. The HIV virus is able to 
damage lymphocytes so they don't function properly. Using this test, a doctor 
may be able tell someone not only their T4 cell count, but also information about 
how well these cells are working. Researchers are working on simplifying this 
test for wider use.</p><p>
The advisory panel concluded that at the moment no single surrogate marker 
can be said to give a 100% accurate picture of the progression of HIV disease. 
Different markers need to be looked at together. Looking at more than one 
surrogate marker could give a better overall picture of someones health. The 
panel also decided that research into surrogate markers should give priority to 
the new viral load tests because the evidence so far suggests viral load may be 
the most accurate marker of disease progression in people with HIV. </p><p>
The advisory panel was asked, "What should people with HIV infection and 
clinicians caring for them be told about viral quantitation (viral load) now?" 
They answered that viral load does mark disease progression, but that it is too 
early to say if this measurement can be used to help make treatment decisions.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>New information on fungal treatments</b></font><br>
New reports have shown that candida infections can become resistant to 
fluconazole. Resistance means an infection no longer responds to treatment. 
Fluconazole is used for treatment and prevention of thrush, vaginal candidiasis 
and other infections caused by C. albicans. </p><p>
Resistance to other azole drugs used for treatment have also been shown. The 
drugs are ketoconazole, clotrimazole, and itraconazole.</p><p>
Although these findings require further study, they suggest that chronic 
fluconazole therapy in HIV+ patients may be limited by the development of 
resistance to the drugs. Chronic use of a drug means it is used for a long time to 
suppress and prevent the disease. People who have become resistant to 
fluconazole may have to be treated with amphotericin B.</p><p>
For a Simple Facts Sheet on fungal infections and treatments, call The Network 
and we will send you one right away. </p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Side effects of steroids</b></font><br>
The benefits of using certain types of steroids to treat the muscle and weight 
loss that people with HIV may develop are still unknown. Doctors are 
understandably concerned about using steroids due to their well-known side 
effects. One of the known side effects of steroids can be severe depression.
Steroids used for increasing muscle mass and putting on weight are called 
anabolic steroids. People with wasting due to HIV infection are sometimes 
treated with anabolic steroids. </p><p>
For a Simple Facts Sheet about the use of steroids, including the muscle 
building kinds sometimes used by body builders, call us and we will send you 
one right away. If you want a more detailed description, just ask. We would be 
pleased to send you the information we have. Simple Facts Sheets are part of 
our new program, The Access Project. The program is sponsored by Pfizer 
Roerig. The Network's toll-free national treatment access and information

<p><font size=3><b>New Treatment Options</b></font><br>
<B>Zovirax</B> - also known as acyclovir, has been used for many years by people 
with herpes, as well as AIDS. As we reported last issue, this drug has recently 
been shown to actually increase the survival time of people with AIDS. As the 
studies continue to be looked at - the Australian government has approved the 
drug for the treatment of HIV disease - people with AIDS and HIV will surely 
begin to take this drug. Zovirax is a relatively safe drug. Side effects are rare. 
Perhaps the most encouraging news is that the dose of the drug tested was less 
than what many people currently take.</p><p> 
<B>Zerit</B> - Another nucleoside analogue (a type of drug that includes AZT, ddC and 
ddI) has just been approved in the United States. The drug, d4t (also known as 
Zerit) may provide an important treatment option for people who cannot take 
other HIV treatments such as AZT. There are some considerable side effects 
that might occur when taking the drug, most notably peripheral neuropathy. The 
Network has a complete description of the drug and its possible side effects. 
Call for a copy.</p><p>
<B>Famcyclovir</B> - A new drug is now available for the treatment of herpes zoster 
(shingles). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Famcyclovir. 
The drug is similar to acyclovir but has a daily dosage of three pills instead of 
five. It is made by Smith-Kline Beecham and the brand name will be Famvir. </p><p>
<B>Zithromax</B> - Zithromax (azithromycin) is an antibiotic drug that is very effective at 
treating certain infectious diseases such as chlamydia. It is also used in 
combination with other drugs as treatment for toxoplasmosis and MAC. An 
intravenous form of Zithromax for patients who cannot tolerate the 
gastrointestinal side effects of the regular product is also now available. 
Physicians can call (800) 742-3029 for information on the study requirements. 
Pfizer provides the drug and all lab work at no cost. Pfizer are also developing a 
lactose-free suspension (drinkable) Zithromax that may cause few side effects. 
Call the Premier Research Access Program at (800) 742-3029 for access to 
standard Zithromax. </p><p>
<B>DHPG (pills)</B> - A New Drug Application (NDA) has been submitted to the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration for Oral Ganciclovir. The company that makes it, 
Syntex Corporation, wants FDA approval to market the drug for maintenance 
treatment of CMV (cytomegalovirus). This means that once someone has 
completed the treatment phase for CMV, usually 21 days of the drug by infusion, 
they would take the pills. At the moment maintenance therapy for CMV involves 
receiving the drug intravenously through a permanent catheter that is surgically 
implanted in the chest. It may not be necessary for someone with CMV to have a 
permanent catheter put in if this drug works.</p><p>
<B>Valacyclovir</B> - Burroughs-Wellcome is seeking FDA approval to market a new 
version of acyclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster (shingles). Valacyclovir 
has been shown in studies to help stop the pain associated with shingles 
attacks faster than acyclovir. It is also being studied for the treatment and 
prevention of herpes simplex virus. </p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Cryptosporidiosis</b></font><br>
Cryptosporidiosis is caused by a small organism that usually infects the 
gastrointestinal tract (the stomach and intestine). In people whose immune 
systems aren't compromised, infection is either without symptoms or symptoms 
go away on their own, usually in 30 days. However, in young children and 
immunocompromised adults, infection can cause severe and lengthy illness.
The most common symptoms are diarrhea, nausea, and cramping abdominal 
pain, especially in the right side. The diarrhea can be profuse and watery and 
last a long time. Infection can also cause loss of appetite and vomiting. </p><p>
The primary way of getting infected is person to person via the fecal-oral route. 
Those at highest risk are young children, especially those in day care, those 
who engage in oral-anal sex, and close personal contacts of an infected 
person. Some outbreaks have been traced to water supply systems. Diagnosis 
is made by the identification of the parasite in stool samples or by intestinal 
biopsy (taking a small piece of tissue from the intestine).</p><p>
At one time cryptosporidium were thought to only infect animals. Around 1983, a 
number of human cases began to be reported. Cryptosporidiosis has recently 
been added to the list of infections that must be reported by doctors and other 
health-care providers to the New York City Department of Health.</p><p>
Increases in HIV infection have led to a rise in cryptosporidiosis infection. For a 
person living with HIV, cryptosporidiosis may cause dangerous dehydration and 
malnutrition. Diarhea leads to dehydration, and your body can't function without 
maintaining adequate levels of water.</p><p>
There are two approaches to treatment for cryptosporidiosis: kill the parasites, 
and treat the symptoms. Current treatments include paromomycin (Humatin) 
and azithromycin. Humatin is currently in an ongoing double-blind placebo-
controlled study. Participants are divided into two groups. One group will take 
humatin, the other group will take placebo. Neither the doctor nor the participant 
will know which treatment is being given. Treatment is for three weeks. Humatin 
is also available through prescription.</p><p>
Azithromycin is available from the drug company through a treatment IND for 
people who have failed or can't take conventional treatments. Azithromycin is a 
pill. Call The Network for more information on this program. A new drug for 
cryptosporidiosis called Immuno-C is being considered by the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration for human studies. The drug Diclazuril is no longer 
available for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis, as studies indicate that it does 
not work. </p><p>
Treatment of symptoms can include Immodium which slows down the 
movement of the stomach, and octreotides or opiates for the diarrhea. 
Hyperimmune bovine collostrum is being tested as a means to increase the 
body's production of natural immunoglobulins used in fighting the disease. 
Total parenteral nutrition, or intravenous feeding is sometimes recommended to 
replace nutrients, but isn't often used because it is invasive and expensive. It is 
important to address the symptoms as soon as they occur. Recovery from 
severe weight loss can take a long time.</p><p>
High fat foods should be avoided as they are hard to digest and increase 
diarrhea. Foods containing lactose - dairy products such as cheeses, milk, ice 
cream - produce similar effects.</p><p>
Handwashing, especially after using the bathroom and during food preparation, 
is crucial in preventing the spread of crypto, as well as hepatitis and other 
infectons. Safe sex practices reduce the risk of crypto.</p><p>
During a water alert in Washington, DC, Whitman-Walker Clinic recommended 
that people with HIV/AIDS boil their water for 20-25 minutes. Boiling all drinking 
water is recommended for people with less than 200 T4 cells. This is thought to 
kill the parasite that causes cryptosporidiosis.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Staying Informed</b></font><br>
<I>by Eleanor Mitchell</I></p><p>
As a woman of color and a woman with AIDS, it is an honor and a privilege for 
me to speak before you today. I am grateful both for the opportunity, and for the 
fact that I am well enough to be here. I hope to address some of the larger 
issues and obstacles faced by women of color today who have HIV and AIDS. </p><p>
But to begin with, I'd like to introduce myself and tell you a little of my own story.
I have been HIV+ for fifteen years. Some of it's up, some of it's down, sometimes 
it's just part of my life, sometimes it hits me over the head and takes over to the 
point where I can't pay attention to much else. I'd guess those are the facts with 
pretty much any chronic illness.</p><p>
When I first starting seeking medical help, I searched and searched, went 
through many disappointments and discrimination - yes, discrimination - even 
from the medical profession.</p><p>
I needed someone to help me with the disease, the gyn problems, mental stress 
and a host of other problems that I could not get answers for dealing with just 
one doctor. I had my primary doctor, my infectious disease doctor, my gyn 
doctor, my psychiatrist, my dentist, and my therapist. No one doctor knew what 
the other was doing. If it wasn't for the survival kit that is built inside me, I 
probably would have been gone a long time ago.</p><p>
I still don't have a doctor that will take care of the whole body, but I have learned 
to communicate with my doctors, and make them keep in touch with each other 
concerning my health. That was not an easy task, it took a lot of convincing and 
fighting on my part. I finally found a doctor that listens to me, who listens to what 
I have been doing and continue to do to survive as long as I have. If there is a 
doctor out there that treats the whole body, I certainly would like to meet him. Or 
her. Since I haven't found him, I have to take charge of my body and keep my 
doctors informed as to what medications I'm taking, making sure that they 
always know when another one of my doctors puts me on a new medication, 
especially if they're prescribing a medication that is new to me.</p><p>
My therapist and psychiatrist work together to help me deal with the emotional 
problems that bring on opportunistic infections in my body such as herpes 
zoster, which is a very painful long lasting infection. My support system helps 
me find and get Peptide T when my peripheral neuropathy, together with my 
arthritis, becomes almost more than I can bear. This year, thanks to my medical 
doctor, psychiatrist and therapist, I have not had a herpes outbreak. It wasn't 
easy to get everyone to work together, but if you love self, and I do love self, 
then you do the leg work because it just might save your life.</p><p>
Impress your doctor with your interest in yourself. You will get more out of your 
medical care if he knows how much you care. Health care providers, like your 
doctor, are people. They like to feel important and needed the same as anyone 
else. If they are too busy, which they often are until they see how seriously you 
want to know, call an organization like the AIDS Treatment Data Network and 
ask them to tell you about the medication, the side effects to watch out for, how it 
can be expected to help you and how long that might take.</p><p>
Find someone that will take the time to explain things to you that you might not 
have understood from your doctor. The Network is my support system. I don't 
know where I would be if it were not for the information that I get from them. The 
people that work at the Network are dedicated and caring, and if they don't have 
the answer, they don't give up, they find an answer for you. Everyone needs that 
kind of information support. Someone who can point you in a direction that you 
haven't thought of. Find the organization in your area that can do that for you. If 
they don't exist, get together with other women who share your concerns and 
start one. </p><p>
How do you do that? By finding out where the support groups are being held 
and getting yourself to that first meeting. Network with other people that are 
going through the same problems that you are. I have learned as much from 
networking as I have from my doctors. Learn from other women. There's no 
reason for you to jump over the same hurdles if someone can give you a few 
pointers on getting around them.</p><p>
Don't sit around waiting for disaster. Take the bull by the horns. Treat it or 
prevent it as soon as you know about it. Remember, she who fights and runs 
away lives to fight another day. AIDS doesn't just go away!</p><p>
I think that's the most important piece of information I want to stress for women 
of color, for all women, for all people dealing with this disease. Take charge. It 
can and will feel like an uphill battle, but I'm here to tell you, the view from the 
top can be just fine.</p><p>
What are the larger issues facing women of color? What are the obstacles and 
discrimination I mentioned earlier? And what is being done for women of color 
today to make access to health care more equal?</p><p>
Anyone who's been on any form of public assistance - in my case, SSI and 
Medicaid - knows that discrimination goes with the territory. We can wish that 
weren't true, but wishing doesn't make it go away. Doctors don't want Medicaid 
patients because Medicaid doesn't reimburse at the level they feel entitled to. 
This can be so discouraging when you first start out. The encouraging fact is 
that there are good doctors, doctors who care and who know their stuff, who will 
take Medicaid patients. Many of these doctors work at some of the finest AIDS 
clinics and hospitals in the country. Go to those doctors, even though it means 
sitting in waiting rooms for too many hours. Those are the doctors with the 
information and the knowledge that can hopefully help you.</p><p>
But don't depend on them alone. Find that support group of other women of 
color and learn from them. If you come up with a problem that no one's dealt 
with before, it's going to be a lot easier to solve by putting your heads together 
and working as a team than facing all those slamming doors on your own. And 
even though a lot of doors may slam, one of them is going to open, and that's 
going to be the one you want to go through.</p><p>
Are women of color excluded from medical care or from newer treatments in 
clinical trials that might help them? Only in the ways I've spoken of already. In 
my experience in the clinical trials I've participated in, I have not been excluded 
as a woman of color. Sometimes I feel like I'm being actively recruited. 
Whether you want to take the drugs before they're approved or not is another 
question entirely. This is not a question of access, but a question of adequate 
information. Drugs that aren't readily available might seem more desirable - and 
I stress that word seem - but part of the reason clinical trials are as extensive as 
they are - and I'm not qualified to address issues of profit or protocol design - is 
to prevent the kind of harm that any new drug can do if it's not adequately 
understood.</p><p>
Women of color must get care earlier rather than later. This is of primary 
importance. Women in their role as family care givers too often forget to look 
after themselves. PCP is still the leading cause of death in women with AIDS. Is 
this because women get PCP easier? No, it's because women get care later. 
Encourage your friends to look after themselves. That way they'll encourage 
you when you need it too. What's that old saying - do unto others? There are 
good preventive medications out there - for PCP and other opportunistic 
infections. But you won't know you need them if you haven't been to the doctor 
and had the right tests run. And if you go to the doctor and wonder if he's doing 
the right tests, ask around, find out. Knowledge might be power, but putting that 
knowledge to use is even more powerful.</p><p>
And let us not forget our children. Many of us are mothers, and we have a 
responsibility to our children. A precious responsibility - to love them, to pay 
attention to them, to make sure they have the information they need in order to 
survive. I am a mother with three children. I know that our children are our most 
important resource. Our children are killing each other and themselves with 
AIDS and with guns. It is our responsibility as mothers, as human beings, to do 
everything we can to put a stop to the killing. If you need help talking to your 
children, call on your support system. Find the organization in your area that 
can provide you with the information you need, that can help you develop the 
necessary means of communication. If your children aren't listening, make it 
your business to find someone they will listen to. When children are empowered 
with the information they need in order to continue as individuals of value - and 
how will they learn that value of self, love of self, unless it comes from you, from 
all of us - it is only then that the killing will stop.</p><p>
What's my message to women of color? Information. Knowledge. Power. It's out 
there. Get some. And pass it around.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>One anti-TB pill</b></font><br>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted approval of Rifater, a 
combination of three drugs, for the treatment of tuberculosis. Standard treatment 
for TB requires someone with TB to take up to 13 pills daily. When symptoms 
improve, some people stop taking their medications. Treatment for TB infection 
has to continue for up to 2 years. It is very important to complete the treatment. 
Stopping treatment can lead to TB infections that are even more difficult to 
control. Rifater, a combination of rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide, requires 
only about six daily doses. All three drugs are standard treatments for TB. 
Taking one pill instead of three will make it easier for people to keep with their 
treatment for the length of time necessary. The drug company that makes Rifater 
plans to begin selling the pill this summer.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Foscarnet Study</b></font><br>
A study has opened at NYU/Bellevue for the treatment of acyclovir resistant 
herpes simplex virus with a topical foscarnet (Foscavir) cream. All eligible 
patients will be treated with the cream five times a day for up to six weeks. 
Anyone not responding to treatment after three weeks will be offered 
intravenous foscarnet. Everyone will be followed until complete healing. Call 
The Network for study site and contact information.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Interferon Beta</b></font><br>
Interferons are substances produced by the body to fight infection. Some of 
these interferons have been synthesized and used as treatments. Alpha 
interferon is approved as a treatment for cancers, including Kaposi's Sarcoma. 
A natural form of interferon, called Alferon N, was approved by the FDA in 1989 
for the treatment of genital warts. This product contains at least 14 variations of 
interferon and is the closest to the oral interferon known as Kemron.</p><p>
Gamma interferon is associated with the growth of cytotoxic, or killer, T8 cells. 
These cells are critical in locating and killing infected cells. Gamma interferon 
has been studied for the treatment of MAC, and is used to treat leprosy. 
Interferon-beta may be useful in combination for treatment of HIV infection. 
A study shows that combination doses of IL-2 and interferon-beta stimulated 
natural killer cell activity in blood taken from people with a type of leukemia. HIV 
infection is associated with low levels of natural killer cell activity. It may be 
possible to use low dose IL-2 and beta-interferon as a treatment.</p><p>
The drug company that makes Interferon beta, or R-Frone, has applied for an 
orphan drug designation for the treatment of symptomatic people with AIDS 
including all patients with CD4 T-cell counts less than 200.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Anti-Oxidants</b></font><br>
Oxidants, sometimes called free radicals, are substances that occur naturally in 
your body, especially when you have an infection. Usually they are cleaned up 
efficiently and gotten rid of by substances called antioxidants. With infection, 
there may not be enough antioxidants in your system to do the work. Too many 
oxidants can harm healthy cells and cause inflammation. </p><p>
Glutathione is a substance found in the blood, it has a number of important 
functions. Perhaps most important is its action as an antioxidant. Low levels of 
glutathione may be linked to the progression of HIV disease. Low levels of 
glutathione allow higher levels of a chemical messenger called NF-kB. NF-kB 
causes HIV replication as well as cell division. HIV replication and cell division 
are the ways HIV spreads.</p><p>
A study of procysteine (a type of anti-oxidant) given intravenously to HIV+ 
participants without symptoms showed promising results. Procysteine is a drug 
that helps boost levels of glutathione. Significant increases in glutathione in 
whole blood was found after six weeks of treatment. Side effects such as rash 
and lightheadedness went away on their own and occurred after the first 
infusion, but did not recur with following doses.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>HPMPC</b></font><br>
A cancer researcher has found evidence that an experimental drug may help 
get rid of genital warts, the most common sexually transmitted viral disease. The 
virus causing the warts is called HPV, or human papilloma virus. The 
experimental drug is HPMPC.</p><p>
HPV warts are a common but usually benign problem. However, some types of 
HPV have been linked to the development of cervical cancer. 
The company that makes HPMPC has begun testing the drug in Phase I and II 
clinical trials, which focus on safety and effectiveness. </p><p>
A trial in New York is studying topical HPMPC for herpes simplex, another viral 
infection. You must have acyclovir resistant herpes to participate in this trial. The 
trial runs for 5 days. Participants are divided into two groups. One group will be 
treated with HPMPC ointment in different doses. The other group will be treated 
with placebo. Neither the participant nor the doctor will know which treatment is 
being given. After two weeks, all participants will be eligible to receive the drug. 
You may not take any other treatment for herpes while on the trial.</p><p>
Intravenous HPMPC is also being studied for the treatment of CMV retinitis, a 
viral infection that can damage the eyes. Intravenous HPMPC has serious 
kidney toxicities. Kidney toxicities may be reduced by adjusting dosages and 
adding a drug called probenicid, which reduces the amount of HPMPC 
absorbed by the kidneys. Call The Network if you would like more information 
about these studies.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Licorice</b></font><br>
Licorice is an ancient herb (Glycyrrhiza glabra) that has been used for 
medicinal purposes for centuries. Licorice (often spelled "liquorice" in ancient 
herbals) is a member of the legume family, whose cousins include beans, peas 
and the herb broom. About two-thirds of all Chinese herbal formulas include 
licorice.</p><p>
Licorice is a popular remedy for cough, some complications of tuberculosis, and 
chest complaints in general, such as bronchitis. Because of its soothing 
properties, it often is used in cough medicines. It is also highly regarded as a 
soothing ingredient for sore throat and laryngitis.</p><p>
The Chinese have also used licorice to strengthen and balance the female 
reproductive system. Some compounds found in licorice are thought to help the 
adrenal glands function more smoothly in conditions of stress and exhaustion. 
The adrenal glands are responsible for hormones that keep the body systems 
balanced. Naturopaths have used licorice in treating hypoglycemia, diabetes 
and Addison's disease, which is a malfunction of the adrenal glands.</p><p>
At the IX International Conference on AIDS in Berlin, two small, non-
randomized studies of glycyrrhizin in asymptomatic HIV+ individuals suggested 
some benefits to the treatment. However, these studies, both of which were 
conducted in Japan, are difficult to analyze or draw any conclusions from, due 
to the small size and the extremely limited data that were published.
There are reports of glycyrrhizin causing high blood pressure, water retention, 
and possibly heart complications when taken in very high doses.</p><p>
Naturally sweet licorice root has been used for thousands of years to treat 
coughs, lung congestion, constipation and relieve inflammation of mucus 
membranes. The Greeks wrote about it over 2,300 years ago, and extract from 
the roots of glycyrrhizin has been used throughout Europe. For over forty years, 
it's been a prescription drug in Japan to treat inflammatory illnesses such as 
ulcers and chronic liver disease. It is also used to decrease allergic reactions to 
other drugs.</p><p>
The chief substance in licorice root, which supplies the sweet taste, is called 
glycyrrhizin. Glycyrrhizin is a sweet, white crystalline powder consisting of the 
calcium and potassium salts of glycyrrhizic acid. Other substances found in the 
root include starch, gum, protein, fat, resin, asparagin, a trace of tannin, yellow 
coloring matter and a small amount of volatile oil.</p><p>
Candy called licorice is flavored mostly with anise (another plant, a part of the 
parsely family), and has very little glycyrrhizin in it. Some natural licorice 
candies and cough drops can be found in health-food stores.
Glycyrrhizin may protect livers and other vital organs from being damaged by 
oxidants. Too many oxidants can harm healthy cells and cause inflammation. 
Licorice is considered ideal for patients who are dehydrated or thin, but not for 
people with swelling, pregnant women in the last trimester, or people who are 
overweight because of water retention.</p><p>
Also, to be safe, if you have high blood pressure or heart trouble, avoid large 
amounts of licorice. The overconsumption of candies containing licorice extract 
has caused some people to develop symptoms of edema, or swelling, and 
related problems. Large amounts of licorice should be avoided since the herb 
can deplete your body of potassium, causing an electrolyte imbalance.</p><p>
Licorice grows wild in North America as Glycyrrhiza lepidota, one of numerous 
species of this plant. The Blackfoot Indians of the Dakotas steeped the leaves of 
wild licorice plants in hot water and used this infusion to treat earache. In China, 
where licorice is commonly called gan cao (sweet weed), doctors have long 
used the herb for gastric ulcers and arthritis.</p><p>
Researchers using a highly refined licorice extract suggest that chemicals in 
glycyrrhizin called triterpenoids may be effective against cancer. They may 
block the production of prostaglandin - a hormonelike fatty acid that may be 
responsible for stimulating the growth of cancer cells - and help get rid of 
cancer-causing invaders. Triterpenoids have been shown in test tubes to stunt 
the growth of rapidly multiplying cells, like cancer cells, and they may even help 
precancerous cells return to normal.</p><p>

Protease inhibitor study opens in Philadelphia; Treatment Updates:

<p><font size=3><b>Protease inhibitor study opens</b></font><br>
Perhaps the most promising anti-HIV treatment currently being tested belongs 
to the protease inhibitor family. This family of drugs is unlike AZT and its 
relatives, although in this study a protease inhibitor (made by the world's largest 
drug company, Merck) is being tested with and without AZT to see if early tests 
of the drug continue to show promising results. </p><p>
There are several protease inhibitor type drugs being tested. Each one is made 
by a different drug company. The fact that many companies are testing this drug 
means that scientists are hopeful that one of them will work. A few of the people 
in earlier studies of the Merck protease inhibitor have had increases in T4 cells 
from 50 to over 200, although it is not known whether this rise in T4 cells means 
that the immune system is working better. In addition, the first studies of the 
drug show that it can reduce the amount of virus that can be measured in the 
blood. This may mean that the drug can help people with low T4 cells, but it may 
also be a random occurrence. Additional studies, like this one, will help to 
determine whether this drug actually works. </p><p>
It may be difficult to find all the needed participants for this study because of the 
entry criteria. To be a part of this study you must have less than 500 T4 cells, 
and have less than 2 weeks of AZT use. But it is okay if you have used ddI, ddC 
or d4T already. It doesn't matter how long you have been on any of those drugs, 
if you have. Also, you cannot be positive for hepatitis C antibodies, hepatitis B 
surface antigens, or have serious liver problems. Liver function tests must be 
less than two times the normal level. </p><p>
If you decide to participate in this study, you will receive the protease inhibitor, 
or the protease inhibitor with AZT, or AZT alone. After you have completed the 
24 weeks of the trial, you will be given whatever treatment shows the most 
benefit. Participants must visit the study site once a week for the first four weeks, 
then once a month for three months. This study is being done in Philadelphia. 
Travel costs for New Yorkers will be partially paid for.</p><p>
There are several other protease inhibitor studies that are scheduled to begin 
fairly soon. It is likely that people who have already been in a study of any 
protease inhibitor will not be allowed to join a new one. Then again, it is 
impossible to get a protease inhibitor outside of a clinical trial. </p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Treatment Notes</b></font><br>
<B>Hyperthermia</B>: The FDA recently approved a small study in 6 people of a 
treatment called hyerthermia. Hyperthermia is a procedure by which blood is 
drawn out of the body, heated to kill infections such as viruses and bacteria, and 
put back into the body. It is unknown whether this treatment is safe, or if it works. 
The Network will continue to collect information on the safety and efficacy of this 
treatment as it is available.</p><p>
<B>IVIG</B>: Treatment Review reported in its last issue that some preparations of IVIG 
had been withdrawn because of possible hepatitis infections. Baxter, the 
company that made the withdrawn product, has since been granted approval for 
distribution of a product that has been cleaned with a solvent detergent, 
preventing the transmission of hepatitis infection. </p><p>
<B>Megace</B>: Megace (megesterol acetate), a synthetic hormone, has been 
approved for the treatment of anorexia, cachexia, and weight loss in people with 
AIDS. Anorexia is the long-term loss of appetite. Cachexia is a term meaning 
general ill health and malnutrition due to a chronic disease. </p><p>
<B>d4T (stavudine)</B>: d4T is an antiretroviral similar to AZT, ddI, and ddC. The trade 
name for d4T is Zerit. It is also known as stavudine. Bristol-Meyers Squibb, the 
company who makes Zerit, has applied to the FDA for approval of its drug. 
Studies of d4T continue for the treatment of HIV infection in children, and in 
combination with AZT or ddI for the treatment of HIV infection in adults. 
Neuropathy can be a side effect of taking d4T. Other possible side effects are 
elevated liver function tests. Liver function should be closely monitored if you 
are taking d4T. The New York Times reported on May 20, 1994 that a panel of 
scientists recommended the government approve d4T, but with a strong 
warning that doctors still do not know enough about the drug to say who should 
take it. The FDA has not said when it will decide on d4T. It is not bound by 
advisory board decisions, though it generally follows them. Studies of d4T as a 
treatment for HIV infection are ongoing. </p><p>
<B>NAC</B>: NAC is a precursor to glutathione, which means that it turns into 
glutathione in the body. Glutathione is an antioxidant the body produces. 
People with HIV infection can have low levels of glutathione. NAC may help 
boost production of glutathione. A small study at Stanford University in 
California is underway. NAC has been used for decades in Europe as an anti-
bronchitis treatment and is considered non-toxic. It is not know what the side 
effects will be in the high doses used in the Stanford trial.</p><p>
<B>Mepron (atovaquone)</B>: Mepron is a drug that is approved for the treatment of 
mild PCP pneumonia. The current version of Mepron requires taking the drug in 
conjunction with a hefty meal that contains a considerable amount of fat. The 
company that makes the drug (Burroughs Wellcome Co.) is about to ask the 
FDA for approval of a new liquid suspension that is expected to be more readily 
absorbed, even without a fat filled meal. In addition, a study about to be 
reported on suggests that Mepron is effective against microsporidiosis related 
diarrhea. The use of the drug for this purpose, however, needs much more 
study. Mepron is available by prescription.</p><p>
<B>Interleukin-12</B>: A naturally occurring immune system chemical that may help to 
restore proper functioning of the immune system is now in clinical trials in San 
Francisco and Los Angeles. This is a Phase I study to test the safety of the drug. 
Participants only receive one shot of the drug. Each participant will be given a 
higher dose than the last participant, until the highest tolerated dose is found. If 
the drug is found to be safe, participants in this Phase I study will be given first 
pick at other studies of the drug, provided they meet the criteria for those 
studies. </p><p>
<B>Zovirax</B>: A study done by a research team in Australia shows that high doses of 
acyclovir (Zovirax), a drug used to treat herpes infections, can significantly 
prolong the lives of people with AIDS. The 1992 study indicates that, compared 
to placebo (study participants were given either a placebo or the drug), 
acyclovir could lengthen survival time in AIDS patients. Although it is still not 
known at this time, acyclovir may have an even greater effect on people in the 
earlier stages of the disease. Scientists are very cautious about making this 
claim, however, especially in light of the results of recent studies of AZT. 
Although AZT has been shown to be an effective treatment for people with 
AIDS, a recent study of the drug did not clearly show that it works as well for 
people without illness. The Health Department of the Australian government is 
considering approving acyclovir as a treatment for HIV infection. </p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Survival Time</b></font><br>
Clinical trials of experimental drugs for AIDS usually measure whether or not a 
drug increases survival time. There is a lot of discussion about what drugs or 
treatments, including nutritional supplements, keep people alive longer. 
What helps some people who are HIV+ stay relatively healthy for many years? 
A lot of research is being done to find this out. There is some evidence that the 
number of T8 cells, not the number of T4 cells, is the most important factor. 
Some people say that reducing stress increases survival time, although this is a 
very hard thing to measure. Not having enough food to eat is stressful. Not 
eating enough food to meet the body's everyday needs will definitely decrease 
survival time. </p><p>
Two San Francisco studies started in 1983 show that the prevention and 
treatment of PCP increases survival time in people with AIDS. This study 
supports what clinicians have been saying for years. PCP is a serious disease 
that can kill, but there are ways to both treat and prevent it. PCP is still the major 
cause of death of people with AIDS. </p><p>
The drugs approved to treat PCP are Bactrim or Septra, dapsone, pentamidine, 
atovaquone, and trimetrexate with leucovorin.</p><p>
Any doctor can prescribe drugs to prevent and treat PCP. These drugs are 
usually covered by Medicaid, state and city drug assistance programs, and 
private insurance. If you need help in finding a program that will cover drugs to 
treat or prevent PCP, or would like to know about the effectiveness or possible 
side effects of any of these drugs give The Network a call.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Warnings about Trental and Hydrogen Peroxide</b></font><br>
The drug Trental, also called pentoxifylline, is used to treat circulation disorders 
in older people. This drug has recently been tested for HIV. It is used off-label by 
some people with AIDS and HIV. Off-label means that a doctor can prescribe 
the drug, although the purpose that it is prescribed for is not the same purpose 
for which the drug was approved by the FDA. </p><p>
A recent study of Trental showed that the drug has no effects whatsoever 
against HIV. It was believed that the drug might reduce levels of an immune 
system chemical called tumor necrosis factor (TNF). No one in this study had a 
decrease in the amount of TNF in their blood. </p><p>
Also, there were no improvements in T4 cell counts, amount of virus in the 
blood, or overall health. In fact, several people had significant side effects. The 
side effects reported include fevers, headaches, stomach upset and nausea. 
Trental is known to cause other side effects as well, including bleeding of the 
stomach and skin. There is concern that the drug may affect the eyesight of 
those who take it. People who are taking Trental are cautioned to be careful. 
Hydrogen peroxide, a chemical typically used to kill germs, has been suggested 
by some alternative treatment advocates, as a potential anti-HIV treatment. A 
recent letter to a scientific magazine related the death of a person with AIDS 
who injected hydrogen peroxide into his body through a catheter.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Interview with Carlo Mascarenhas: Part 2</b></font><br>
<I>Carlo is a Network member and active with Friends In Deed. Weight loss, or 
wasting, is one of the more common effects of HIV infection. Gabriel is his doctor 
and Kotler is a gastroenterologist and research doctor. Yessmin is a nutritionist 
at the Momentum Project.</I></p><p>
I was running a 101 fever. I wanted to know what I should do. Well, what should 
I do? Go to the emergency room? That's the drag to have a clinic doctor, not a 
private doctor. It's so hard to get a hold of him. But I guess that's true of all 
doctors. I lay down and put blankets on and took three Tylenol. </p><p>
Today I ate pretty well. Now I'm having this pasta with bacon, garlic and cream 
(actually milk, rice flour and parmesan cheese). It's very good. I don't think it will 
upset my stomach. Today I wanted to go to the market but I was feeling so sick I 
didn't. I had to use what I had here. I had leftover chicken that I made the other 
night, bananas and madeleines, and this pasta that I am eating now. I keep 
track of my weight. It's been around the same for a long time. About 135 to 137. I 
lost a lot of weight two years ago because of the ulcers. I was making myself 
sick about having HIV. At that time I weighed 125 pounds. Then I started the 
oxandrolone. I never thought that it gave me more appetite than the usual, but I 
did start lifting weights and had some good results. </p><p>
In the last month I lost six pounds. I must have gained them back already now, 
though. The two weeks after I went to see Gabriel I didn't eat anything. That can 
make me lose weight just like that. I think that I can gain it back right away. I 
haven't weighed myself but I think that I will. I don't drink any protein mixes 
although I think that I am going to talk to Yessmin and see. Those protein 
powders I don't like because they are too sweet. I don't take Marinol. What's the 
name of the other one? Megace. But then he didn't give it to me. He said, Well, if 
you want. But then after the X-ray and we were talking I think he forgot, and I 
forgot. </p><p>
The X-ray we found a growth in my lungs. So that made me forget about the 
Megace because I was asking him what it was going to be like, what we were 
going to do. He was very worried. He said, I don't like that. I asked what we 
would do if it is a fungus, what we would do if it were a tumor. He said, well, let's 
not speculate. Let's wait for the results. I think that he said that we might need to 
do a bronchoscopy. The only opening was on Tuesday. Actually, they 
scheduled for Thursday. I asked if we could do it any sooner. I can't wait ten 
days. He called and asked we could get an appointment sooner. At least we got 
an appointment two days sooner.</p><p>
I keep imagining this thing growing. This woman from Friends in Deed said that 
I should image the spot shrinking, but all I can imagine is this thing growing. The 
first day that I found out I was kind of worried. Then I had a kind of shift. I mean, 
why worry before I know what it is? Maybe it's something that is treatable. I have 
no idea what it could be but I am optimistic that it is treatable. What if it is a 
fungus? I take one hundred milligrams a day of Diflucan. I have been taking it 
for a long time. Gabriel said it might be a fungus. He didn't say what kind, but it 
looks like it could be a fungus, or a tumor. So, I'm waiting until Tuesday to find 
out. Do they give the results right away? </p><p>
I've never been in the hospital. Well, if I need to go in the hospital for a couple of 
days, I'll go. The week after I have another appointment to do whatever, like the 
bronchoscopy. When I had an endoscopy at Bellevue - it's been a year and a 
half, almost two years that I had ulcers in my esophagus - I was really sick. I 
couldn't eat. Finally I did a GI tract. They found three ulcers. Then I did an endo 
and a biopsy. They were thinking they were CMV. Kotler gave me prednisone. 
They didn't find any virus or fungus, and I took prednisone for a month. And it 
healed. I never had anything after that. I don't take the prednisone any more. 
I've had this cough about three weeks. When I relax I don't cough. That's why 
he decided to take the x-ray. That cough has something to do with this thing. 
Well, what else could it be? My body calms down. I'm not taking the 
oxandrolone. I kind of stopped this week. I might be wrong but I thought that 
maybe the oxandrolone was the reason that I was not coming. But I think that I 
was just too tired. So, I just thought I would give it a break. </p><p>
I'll probably call Kotler next week. I'm not going to tell him that I stopped doing it, 
I'm going to ask him first. I mean a week without doesn't matter. I'm going to ask 
him if I should stop taking it. But I think that I am going to start again. I mean I 
don't feel any different not taking it. And I think, actually, that the oxandrolone 
works better when I stop for a day, then I take it the day after, if I skip one day 
and then I go work out. Some days I just don't take it. It just gives the body a little 
rest. Usually I take it every day. Sometimes I don't take it. I work out on the days 
that I take it. No one ever told me. It's just intuitive. It works in my mind.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>The Alternative Question</b></font><br>
<I>by Ken Fornataro</I></p><p>
My best friend, Luis Hernandez died of AIDS on March 8, 1994. When he died, 
his bedside dresser was stuffed with over 100 bottles of assorted pills, tablets, 
vitamins (especially antioxidants) and many other things that have been 
proposed as possible treatments for AIDS. Some of the treatments that Luis was 
taking were prescribed drugs such as ganciclovir and clarithromycin. Others 
were what are often called alternative treatments.</p><p>
Luis wanted to know everything he could about each drug, vitamin and 
alternative therapy that he was considering taking. He participated in five 
different clinical trials of experimental drugs. Each time he had high hopes that 
the new drug would work, and that he would get better. He discussed his 
options one by one with his doctor. Luis was a brave man. He knew that he was 
taking chances, but he would have been the first one to be proud that he had 
helped to find an effective treatment for AIDS. </p><p>
Despite the fact that researchers do not know about all the possible side effects 
of experimental drugs - which are sometimes mild, but other times severe - 
people like Luis decide to participate in clinical trials. He stayed informed, and 
made the decisions he needed to make. This is called Informed Consent. It is an 
ongoing process. </p><p>
There are strict guidelines that researchers must follow, although there is never 
a guarantee that an experimental drug will work as a treatment, or that it is safe 
to take. The side effects of new drugs that are being studied are not always 
known. Before you start a treatment, find out everything there is to know about 
the drug, how it is being studied, the risks and benefits. </p><p>
It is important to remember that any drug - even drugs that are already 
commonly used by doctors - can have side effects. Although the side effects are 
very real when you experience them, they can sound much worse than they 
usually are. For example, the drug aspirin can cause stomach bleeding and 
damage an important immune system cell called platelets. But most people 
don't experience these side effects when they take aspirin. Informed consent 
means that you know all the possible side effects that might occur, even if they 
happen only rarely to a few people. </p><p>
The number of herbs, vitamins, and other substances that are now being 
advertised and promoted as alternative treatments for AIDS and HIV has grown 
rapidly in the last few years. Different AIDS newsletters and magazines have 
featured articles on how to choose the best alternative treatment. The number of 
people who claim that one or more alternative treatments has cured them has 
also grown very quickly. </p><p>
The reason for this rapid increase in both treatments and claims for their 
usefulness is simple - there are not enough well-tested, safe, and effective 
treatments for AIDS and HIV-related conditions. Meanwhile, we still have to 
make decisions about treatments. </p><p>
The article on the back page begins a series on alternative therapies. The 
specific focus will be on herbs and herbal therapies that may prove to be of use 
to people with AIDS and HIV. All of them are readily available - assuming that 
you can afford to buy them - and have been used with relative safety by human 
beings. We caution, however, that AIDS is not like any other disease, nor have 
ANY of these herbs been clearly shown to be effective. </p><p>
AIDS is a very complex disorder of the immune system. The typical phrase that 
is often used by herbologists is, "This herb stimulates the immune system." This 
may be the opposite of what someone with a damaged immune system needs. 
Although some cells of the immune system work when they are stimulated, 
activating them may also cause HIV to spread. </p><p>
Causing an opposite effect on the immune system may also be helpful. 
Dramatically suppressing the immune system, as with certain types of steroids 
or "cooling" herbs, may lead to a rebound activation of the immune system that 
leads to better suppression of HIV and other infections. </p><p>
We are often mislead by the term alternative. Because we would like to believe 
that there are, in fact, safe, effective, non-toxic and accessible (as in 
inexpensive), the word alternative is applied to many things. This does not 
necessarily mean that they do any of the things we would like them to do. 
Alternative treatments can be very expensive, may produce little if any real 
results, and can sometimes cause severe side effects. Your best bet is to look at 
all treatments the same - whether they are called alternative or traditional. 
Drug companies sell drugs to make profits. But the profits are also used to make 
money to pay for the research and other costs of developing the drug in the first 
place. It costs money to make something. Through expanded access programs, 
some drug companies will provide drugs to people who have no insurance or 
can't afford them. </p><p>
Most drugs that are tested in clinical trials don't ever make it all the way through 
to being approved as treatments. Only one in ten drugs makes it through the 
entire process. Imagine the huge amount of money - as much as 200 million 
dollars - that it costs to develop a drug that does not work. That cost is one 
reason why most alternative treatments don't get tested in clinical trials. On the 
other hand, a drug that does make it through the clinical trial process can end 
up making a lot of money for the company that develops it. This would be true of 
a treatment that is referred to as alternative as well. </p><p>
Why aren't the companies who make and sell alternative treatments willing to 
put some of their billions of dollars of profits into clinical trials so that we can 
have a clear understanding of how the treatment works, or if it works at all? 
Perhaps because, if only 10% or their products made it through the clinical trial 
process, some of their profits might disappear when people stop buying 
treatments that haven't been proven to work.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Clinical Trial Update</b></font><br>
Several new studies of experimental treatments for AIDS and HIV-related 
conditions (such as cancers and opportunistic infections) have opened in the 
last few months. Some of these are listed below. For a complete description of 
any of these trials call The Network at (800)858-2111. </p><p>

<B>Skin Disorders (psoriasis)</B>: For the treatment of severe psoriasis, a skin disorder, in people with HIV 
infection, a drug called acitretin is being studied. Acitretin is a pill. To participate 
in this study, you must have psoriasis covering at least 10% of your body 
surface. The study coordinators will measure the extent of your psoriasis.</p><p>

<B>Decision-making by Women</B>: An information gathering study is looking for volunteers to participate in an NIH 
funded psycho-social study of treatment decision making of women who are 
HIV positive. Participants are paid $30 for their time and travel and the interview 
is strictly confidential. The interview is approximately 2 hours. A second study, 
starting in June, will be for women with AIDS. Participants will be seen for 3 
visits, and paid $25 per visit for their time and travel. Call The Network for more 
information.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Echinacea</b></font><br>
Echinacea is a native American medicinal plant. It is also called purple cone-
flower. It looks like a colorful daisy and grows in many people's gardens. 
Echinacea has been used as a folk remedy throughout history and is well-
known to Native Americans as an all-purpose medicine. Today, many people 
use echinacea to fight colds and flu viruses. Echinacea has been studied in 
Europe and research shows that it has antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, and 
anticancer properties.</p><p>
In the early 17th century, the Plains Indians used echinacea to treat respiratory 
illness, snakebites, wounds and smallpox. In 1870, a Nebraska doctor patented 
a medicine containing the herb called Meyer's Blood Purifier. He used it to treat 
chronic nasal congestion, cholera, leg ulcers and bee stings. After antibiotics 
were discovered in the early 1930s, the herb was virtually forgotten until the 
1970s when it became popular in Europe again. The American Medical 
Association, as early as 1910, denounced echinacea as worthless. But in 
Germany alone there are more than 140 echinacea products on the market. 
These include not only tinctures and other liquid extracts similar to those sold 
here, but also salves for sores and wounds, tablets, combination immune 
enhancers, and injectable formulas for more serious conditions.</p><p>
Today, a researcher in Germany is studying echinacea's immune stimulating 
qualities. Echinacea has molecules that appear to boost T-cells. T-cells are 
immune system cells that fight off bacteria and viruses. Echinacea also contains 
a chemical called echinacein which helps strengthen cell membranes, which 
may help keep cells from being invaded by an infection.</p><p>
In a 1986 study, researchers treated 203 women with recurrent candidiasis 
(yeast infections) with echinacea by injection or orally. At the end of the six 
month study, 60 percent of the women treated with anti-fungal ointment 
experienced recurrences, while only 16 percent of those treated with echinacea 
had repeat yeast infections. Following other tests, the researchers found that the 
effectiveness of the herb against candidiasis was due to the immune-enhancing 
effects of echinacea.</p><p>
Echinacea also helps with inflammation. In 1957, a study using echinacea 
extract as a treatment for arthritis caused a 22 percent reduction in 
inflammation. Although this is only half as effective as steroids, steroids have 
many side effects, toxicities and contraindications. Steroids also suppress the 
immune system. Echinacea, on the other hand, is nontoxic, and adds 
immunestimulating properties to its antiinflammatory effect.</p><p>
No toxicity or side effects have been reported, with the possible exception of 
rare allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. Echinacea formulas are sold 
fresh, dried, freeze-dried, as an alcohol extract, and in tablets and liquid form at 
health food stores. Like many other plant derived substances (some of which 
have been recreated chemically), such as Curcumin, licorice root derivatives 
and St. John's Wort extracts, clinical trials are needed to determine whether this 
herb is a reliable and safe treatment alternative. Taken in very small amounts, it 
is unlikely, although not guaranteed, that it will be harmful.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Eye Problems and Rifabutin</b></font><br>
If you are experiencing any changes in vision you should see an 
ophthalmologist who is knowledgeable about HIV-related conditions. One of the 
conditions that may change your eyesight is uveitis. Uveitis is inflammation of 
the uvea, which includes the iris - the colored part of the eye. Symptoms of this 
condition include eye pain, light sensitivity, redness and blurred vision. In 
severe cases blindness can result, although it is often reversible. It is important 
not to confuse the symptoms of uveitis with early signs of CMV retinitis, another 
eye disorder caused by a herpes virus. </p><p>
Rifabutin, or Mycobutin, is used for the treatment of mycobacterium avium 
complex (MAC). MAC is an opportunistic infection associated with AIDS. 
Rifabutin is also being studied for the prevention of MAC. Twelve cases of the 
eye disorder called uveitis have been reported in individuals participating in a 
MAC prevention study sponsored by the NIH. The side effects are believed to 
be associated with rifabutin. Rifabutin may also be associated with increased 
arthritis pain in the joints.</p><p>
Of the twelve cases of uveitis reported, two have been rated "severe," while the 
others are "mild" or "moderate." Drug interactions may also be responsible for 
the side effect. Taking rifabutin at the same time as clarithromycin, another drug 
used for MAC treatment, could cause the problem. Earlier studies have also 
shown that taking fluconazole, a treatment for fungal infections, at the same time 
can increase levels of rifabutin in the blood by up to 80%. Increased levels of 
drug in the blood may lead to greater risk for side effects.</p><p>
The Informed Consent Form for the study ACTG 196/CPCRA 009, a clinical trial 
for MAC prevention, did not mention uveitis as a possible side effect. It has 
since been changed to alert doctors and trial participants to the possibility of this 
side effect. A letter was sent out to all doctors involved in the study by Adria 
Pharmaceuticals, the maker of the drug Rifabutin. </p><p>
The symptoms of MAC are worse and more dangerous than uveitis. As drugs 
are used for longer periods of time and by more people, symptoms or conditions 
that weren't seen before can occur. If you are taking rifabutin or are in ACTG 
196/CPCRA 009, you should be aware of any changes in your eyes or any 
increases in arthritic pain in your joints and report them to your doctor.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>IL-12 as HIV Treatment?</b></font><br>
The early response to HIV infection, called T-helper type 1 (TH1), is strong and 
effective. In the next phase, often years later, called a TH2 response, immune 
system cells no longer work as well and a large increase in antibodies to HIV is 
seen. These antibodies are not as effective against HIV as the earlier response. 
An increase in this type of antibody may mean that HIV is progressing. </p><p>
A substance called IL-12 may help create an immune system response that 
leads to a renewed TH1 type response. IL-12 is one of the natural blood 
proteins called interleukins. Another interleukin, known as IL-2, has been 
shown to increase T4 cells, but it may also increase HIV activity. IL-12 may be 
more effective in boosting a useful immune response to fight off HIV infection.
The IL-12 being tested is a man-made, or synthetic, version of the natural 
protein. Lab studies suggest that the synthetic version of IL-12 might be a useful 
treatment for people with AIDS and HIV. Until extensive testing in humans is 
done, it is still not certain whether the early TH1 immune response can be 
restored. Early results offer cautious hope for the future.</p><p>
IL-12 may be able to boost numbers of T4 cells, and also multiply natural killer 
cells called cytotoxic T8 cells. T8 cells are an important part of the immune 
system. One study, done with people without HIV, showed that IL-12 can 
increase the immune system reaction to the flu virus. The first small studies of 
IL-12 in HIV+ people have already begun and are filled!</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>St. John's Wort Herb </b></font><br>
A new pill form of hypericin is being studied as a treatment for HIV infection. 
Hypericin comes from an herb called St. John's Wort. Scientists have created a 
synthetic version of this substance to test as a drug. In laboratory tests hypericin 
worked well against HIV. Hypericin has also shown activity in the test tube 
against some other viruses, including CMV and herpes simplex. Early studies of 
hypericin in pill form have not been effective. It is hoped that this new 
formulation will result in higher concentrations of hypericin in the blood. To 
participate in this study, you must be HIV+ and have a T4 cell count under 350. 
You cannot have an active opportunistic infection or be taking an antiretroviral 
such as AZT, ddI or ddC within one month of starting the study. Other drugs are 
not allowed. Everyone will take hypericin daily. </p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Memory & Concentration Study</b></font><br>
A program in New York City will study HIV+ individuals for the treatment of HIV 
dementia and related disorders. Anyone with a T4 cell count of under 300 and 
problems with memory or concentration is eligible. You will be paid $50 for 
each 3 1/2 hour appointment. You will be given free blood tests including CD4 
and CD8 counts. You will be seen at the study site twice a year. The interviews 
will include a review of how you're doing medically, psychologically and 
physically. Eventually clinical trials of new medications will be added to this 
study. If new drugs are added to this study you will be asked if you are 
interested in participating in the new parts of the study.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Peptide T </b></font><br>
A drug made up of amino acids - the building blocks of protein - is being studied 
as a potential treatment for the pain and numbness that people with AIDS and 
HIV often get in their hands and feet. The drug, Peptide T, is claimed to be able 
to treat this condition, which is called peripheral neuropathy. The results of 
recently completed studies have been very disappointing, but a new program, 
which it is hoped will start in the summer of 1994, will provide Peptide T to 
people who are HIV positive and have specific symptoms of HIV. Peptide T is 
now available through the PWA Health Group here in New York City. Contact 
The Network for other studies for treatments for peripheral neuropathy. </p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>SC-49483</b></font><br>
Syncytia formation is the term for when cells of the immune system - both those 
that are infected with HIV as well as those that are not - get stuck together. The 
immune system then targets these clumps of cells and removes them from the 
blood. This leaves less cells to fight against HIV and other types of infections. A 
trial for a new drug that may help prevent syncytia formation is enrolling in New 
York City. The drug, SC-49483, will be compared to AZT. To participate, you 
must have between 50 and 350 T4 cells. If you are already taking AZT, you must 
have been taking it for less than 6 months.</p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Red or Purple Spots or Lesions - It may be something else</b></font><br>
Some bacterial infections can cause lesions that resemble KS. Since 
chemotherapy treatments for KS can be very toxic, it is important that your 
doctor check for these bacterial infections before beginning treatment for KS.</p><p>
Bacillary angiomatosis is a recently recognized disease caused by 
Rochalimaea bacteria. This infection can cause blood vessels to grow out of 
control and form tumor-like masses in skin, bone, liver and other organs. It is a 
life-threatening, but curable bacterial infection that is often missed because it 
may be mistaken for other conditions such as KS. Although bacillary 
angiomatosis is rare in people with intact immune systems, it can be fatal in 
people with HIV infection. Antibiotic treatment of 4 HIV+ people with bacillary 
angiomatosis completely cured them of the bacterial infection. All 4 people, who 
were very sick with the illness, were able to resume normal living. This condition 
is being seen in more people with HIV. </p><p>
Two other infections that may cause skin lesions and other unusual skin marks 
on the body are R. quintana and R. henselae. Skin lesions associated with 
either of these infections can resemble those of many other disorders and may 
not be immediately recognized by a doctor. The first is associated with trench 
fever. This condition was spread by a tiny animal called body louse. Men who 
served in trenches during World War I often sometimes got this infection. It 
causes pain and fever. The second condition is associated with cats. It is also 
known as cat-scratch fever. </p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Report on AZT's Possible Side Effects</b></font><br>
The most common type of research is the kind that asks a question before a 
study begins. This helps to show that the results of a study did not just happen 
by chance, and that it is the drug being tested that is responsible for the good - 
or bad - effects people in the study experience. Some studies - called 
retrospective studies - look back at information over time. One method is by 
reviewing medical records.</p><p>
A group of researchers conducted a retrospective study of AZT. While AZT was 
recognized as a treatment that can delay the development of some of the 
symptoms of AIDS, it also increases the likelihood that side effects will occur. 
Even people who respond well to AZT can experience these side effects, 
although not everyone does. In this study, researchers concluded that side 
effects resulting from the use of AZT may outweigh the benefits of taking AZT. 
The researchers concluded that waiting to take AZT until the disease 
progresses is a reasonable choice for some people, although other people 
would be willing to take the chance of having side effects if they also benefited 
from using the drug. </p><p>
The decision to take any drug is difficult. Some of the most important and urgent 
questions about medical care focus on what effect treatment will have on 
someone's quality of life. Will the treatment make you feel miserable, even if it 
does work? How long will you have to take the drug? Questions like these are 
important questions to ask before starting to take any treatment. Remember, 
even once you start, you can always continue to collect and make use of new 
information as it becomes available. </p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>IVIG Recalled by Pharmaceutical</b></font><br>
Immunoglobulins (IgG) are parts of the immune system called antibodies. 
Antibodies attach to viruses and bacteria in the blood and tissue, alerting the 
body to get rid of them. IVIG is a drug given by infusion and sometimes by 
injection. IVIG stands for intravenous immunoglobulin. IVIG creates a passive 
immune response. This means the drug IVIG replaces or substitutes for what the 
immune system doesn't or can't do by itself. The drug IVIG contains many 
different types of antibodies. </p><p>
IVIG is used to treat children with AIDS. It is being studied in clinical trials to see 
whether it can help prevent the unborn babies of HIV+ mothers from becoming 
infected with HIV. IVIG is also approved for the treatment of bleeding disorders 
in people with hemophilia, and for the treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenia, 
or ITP (low platelet counts that can be associated with HIV). Side effects of IVIG 
rarely occur, although there may be pain at the infusion site, headache, and 
malaise. </p><p>
IVIG products are made by five different pharmaceutical companies. An 
organization named COTT (Committee of Ten Thousand, an organization for 
hemophiliacs) alerted The Network that two brands of the drug IVIG have been 
taken off the market. They have been recalled because of evidence that up to 
twenty people have developed hepatitis C after taking the drug. The two brands 
of IVIG that were recalled are Gammagard (made by Baxter/Hyland), and 
Polygam (made by the American Red Cross). </p><p>
A new formulation of IVIG has been developed by Baxter. The way this new 
drug is made involves killing possible contaminants such as hepatitis C by 
washing the drug with a type of detergent. This process is also used in other 
brands of IVIG.</p><p>
COTT recommends that if you have any Gammagard at home, you should 
contact your doctor or clinic to find out how to properly dispose of it. Do not use 
any leftover Gammagard. Gammagard will be collected from doctors and clinics 
by Baxter. If you have any other information or have questions about IVIG, 
please call The Network, or COTT at 1-800-488-COTT. </p><p>

<p><font size=3><b>Getting the right message</b></font><br>
Much more attention is now being given to how the immune system reacts to the 
presence of HIV. Over the years, scientists have offered different theories on 
how T4 cells are lost, and why people become sick when they do. None of 
these ideas have been clearly proven to be correct. One person with AIDS who 
takes AZT with vitamin supplements  may live longer than another person with 
AIDS who dec ides not to do anything. The reverse may sometimes be true. A 
handful of long-term survivors, however, do  not prove the benefits of any one 
drug or way of approaching the management of AIDS. If it were that easy 
everyone with AIDS would be alive today. Research continues. <P>
This issue reviews a new drug called Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the clinical trials of 
this drug being done at the National Institutes of Health. Actually, it's not such a 
new drug, nor are these the first studies of this drug. In 1984, people with AIDS 
were given IL-2 in much higher doses than are being tested now. The results 
were disastrous. People became sick and died. Although most of the people 
with AIDS who took the drug were very sick in the first place, it appeared that 
the drug didn't help, and probably made things worse. Since that time, work on 
IL-2 has continued. Although some people are eager to make the claim that IL-2 
taken for five days every two months, for example, will create a long-lasting and 
meaningful increase in T4 cells, there is not yet much more than a tiny bit of 
evidence that this will happen. It might. </P>
<p>In previous studies of IL-2, a significant increase in T4 cells was seen - for a 
short period and for as long as the drug was continued. The side effects, 
however, were intense. Hopefully, the way that the drug is now being tested will 
help to avoid some of the side effects such as fevers, chills and an overall sick 
feeling. Scientists are fine tuning how IL-2 is given, including how much and 
when and for how long. Current studies administer the drug for five days once a 
month, as opposed to every day. The doses that are being used are lower. 
Perhaps this will allow the immune system to create a more balanced response.  
Some people have begun on their own to inject themselves with IL-2, which is 
available by prescription for people with cancer. This, of course, is very 
dangerous. We don't recommend it. More importantly, we strongly encourage 
the participation of a trained medical professional. Until more is known about IL-
2 and how to best use the drug and what it actually does to the immune system, 
we encourage people who are considering using the drug, as well as those 
who are interested in the clinical trials described in this Treatment Review, to 
carefully weigh all the benefits and risks.</P>

<p><font size=3><b>Interleukin-2</b></font><br>
Interleukin-2 or IL-2 is a substance the body makes that controls the growth and 
function of many types of cells. Some of these cells make chemical messengers 
called cytokines. Cytokines help fight off infection. High-dose recombinant IL-2 
reduces tumors in diseases like melanoma (skin cancer) and renal cell 
carcinoma (kidney cancer). Side effects can include severe heart and lung 
problems. The same treatment is being tried now against KS, an infection 
associated with cytokines. Although promising, the potential side effects here 
too are great. Some cytokines boost T-cell immunity and others activate HIV, 
producing cancers like KS.</p>

<p><font size=3><b>IL-2 Study for HIV</b></font><br>
A study of IL-2 is being done at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, 
MD. The trial will study IL-2 in combination with an antiretroviral for the 
treatment of HIV infection. Participants will take  either AZT, ddI, or ddC, which 
will be provided by the NIH. All antiretrovirals are pills. Everyone will be in the 
hospital every eight weeks for approximately one week. IL-2 will be given by 
shot once a day for five days. Participants will be seen in clinic four weeks after 
each period in the hospital. The study will continue for approximately 6 months. 
To participate in this study, you must be HIV+ with a T4 cell count of more than 
200. You cannot have a history of any opportunistic infection or a malignancy 
(cancer) other than KS on the skin. You may not have had any prior treatment 
with IL-2, or chemotherapy or other experimental treatments within one month of 
starting the study.</P>

<p><font size=3><b>IL-2 Study for KS</b></font><br>
Another study for IL-2 is also being done at the NIH. This trial will study IL-2 for 
the treatment of KS. This trial has the same requirements as the one for HIV 
infection but lasts for 14 months. The IL-2 is given by continuous infusion for five 
days. Participants will be seen in clinic four weeks after each infusion. If you are 
interested in these trials, call The Network. A number of different companies are 
developing their own formulation of IL-2.  One, called proleukin, is currently FDA 
approved as a treatment for renal (kidney) cell carcinoma. A one-year study that 
started in April of 1993 is looking at proleukin in combination with AZT, ddI or 
ddC to see its effect on T4 cell counts. Correct dosage of the drug in treatment 
for HIV is still unknown. Those interested in proleukin therapy should discuss 
the options with their doctors.</P>

<p><font size=3><b>IL-2 Study for TB </b></font><br>
Another IL-2 study is for the treatment of tuberculosis that is resistant to INH. INH 
is a standard treatment for TB. This is a Phase I dose escalating study. IL-2 is a 
shot. Injections will be given every twelve hours. The study is taking place at 
Beth Israel Hospital in New York City.</P>

<p><font size=3><b>Treatment Decisions: Belief versus Knowledge</b></font><br>
<I>by Ken Fornataro. Ken Fornataro is the founder and director of The Network. This article is meant to put some of the information that The Network collects and searches for on a daily basis into a useful perspective.</I><br>
Some people who have recently become infected with HIV get sick soon after 
finding out about their HIV status. They have low T4 cell counts. Some strains of 
HIV are worse than others. Becoming HIV positive today is not the same as it 
was a year ago. Being HIV positive does not protect you from becoming infected 
with another strain of HIV, as well as other nasty viruses. The virus that you 
contract may not be last year's model. </P>
<p>When AZT was first being tested in people with AIDS there weren't any 
approved treatments for AIDS. Few people, including doctors, believed women 
could have AIDS. You couldn't choose between AZT, ddC, ddI or d4T. You had 
to take the drug every four hours - no matter what. It was not possible to get AZT 
any other way besides joining a clinical trial. If you got in the trial you could not 
take any other drugs to prevent an HIV-related disease like PCP pneumonia. 
There were no approved preventive treatments for PCP, anyway. </P>
<p>In the past few years nothing has changed about the way some people feel 
about AZT, or drugs in general. Some people say they don't believe in AZT. 
They say that they hate the drug. Despite the studies that clearly show that AZT 
does work in people with AIDS, most people aren't getting - or don't want to 
hear - this message. They just hear that some people experience side effects 
from the drug, or that someone who knew someone who took the drug died 
shortly after taking it. Yes, that happens sometimes. It almost always happens 
when someone with AIDS doesn't start any treatment at all.  </P>
<p>People who say that they don't want to take AZT because it is a toxic drug, also 
say that they don't want to take any drugs because they are all toxic. They often 
use this reasoning as an excuse to not take Bactrim or Septra or dapsone to 
prevent PCP pneumonia. </P>
<p>I understand the anger and frustration. No one wants to take drugs that may 
have side effects. No one is eager to be experimented on. It's about knowing 
the truth and not listening to things that aren't true. We assist people to tell the 
difference between the two. Our goal is to help people find out what they need 
to know in order to make decisions, and to help them by sharing the knowledge 
that we have gained by helping other people who have been in the situation 
they are in now. </P>
<p>Although most people call The Network to ask about an approved or 
experimental drug, they also ask for something else - someone to talk to about 
how taking a drug will affect their life, including how they are going to talk to 
their friends, or lover, or family about the fact that they are HIV positive or have 
AIDS, and they need treatment. </P>
<p>Increasing T4 cell numbers in and of itself does not translate to improvements in 
health. Carlo (interviewed in this issue of Treatment Review) has had low T4 
cells for many years. He is very healthy at this point. Others with higher T4 cell 
counts are sick. There is more going on than just the number of T4 cells in the 
blood. It is especially important to look at the long term effects of a drug. Three 
months of good health - or higher T4 cells - is a good thing. Six months is even 
better. One year is great, especially if there is a better quality of life. What is of 
most concern is the possibility of a crash. </P>
<p>Some - although not all - of the people who decided to deal with HIV head on, 
regardless of how long or how difficult it was for them to deal with some of the 
realities of AIDS, are still alive today. I know that starting treatment such as PCP 
prevention is why they are alive today. Most of them say they are happy, 
although somewhat short of time to do all the things that they want to do. </P>
<p>Things are getting better. Scientists who just a few months ago were walking 
around in a desperate state have begun to regain hope. After the International 
Conference on AIDS was held in Berlin, many people were really depressed. 
But the list of promising drugs has grown. New work is being done in 
laboratories and clinics around the world. IL-2, IL-12, protease inhibitors, U90, 
growth hormones, anabolic steroids, and anti-oxidants may be effective 
treatments. </P>
<p>Every time someone with AIDS or HIV chooses to fight, and to fight alongside 
the friends, family and health care providers who are on their side, everyone 
with AIDS, as well as the quality of the human race, benefits. </P>

<p><font size=3><b>Substance Use and Abuse</b></font><br> 
<I>by Richard Haynes</I><br>
My name is Richard Haynes. I am currently a part of the Network. I started using 
drugs at a very young age. The use of drugs started me on a life of stealing and 
in and out of prison. Half of my life has been spent in prison. Just before I went 
to prison the last time I was homeless and a heavy drug user. When I went into 
prison my sister was murdered brutally in 1988. It was also then that I really 
realized how serious the disease AIDS is and that my mother had it. </P>
<p>I had a lot of anger in me and I decided to turn it into something positive. I 
started going to school using my anger and turning it into positive energy. I 
finally received my Degree in Liberal Arts. It was definitely the happiest day of 
my life. I had finally completed something and my mother was right there by my 
side. </P>
<p>During the time that I was upstate, my mother was the only one there to support 
me. So I knew that when I got home that I was going to be there to support her. 
When I finally did get home I came home with the wrong attitude - that I did not 
need anybody for support, which was a big mistake. Seeing my mother go 
through her changes and hanging out with the wrong people I relapsed into the 
drug scene again. It was also a thing of not being honest with myself. I hit my 
bottom worse than before because I knew there was a better way to live. So it 
got so bad that I wanted to kill myself, because I not only let myself down but I let 
my mother down as well.</P>
<p>So I went for help and decided to put my life back in order. Since then I have 
been surrounding myself with positive people. I have also been working 
alongside my mother who is a living legend in my eyes because she has been 
through so much and is still able to help people everyday in spite of her own 
problems. </P>
<p>I had to realize that drugs is not the answer, that kind of life only leads to two 
things - either death or jail. A lot of people do not make it to go get help. Today 
it's about being responsible and knowing that I do not need drugs in my life to 
make me feel good. I do things positive in my life to make me feel good. I am 
thankful that I am working at the Network alongside my mother, Ken and Joel. It 
is giving me the opportunity to be a productive person for myself and those 
around me. I truly thank the people that I work with every day for having the faith 
and confidence in me when I didn't have it in myself.<P>
I have dedicated my life to helping people with AIDS because it is truly a 
tragedy. My mother, Ken and Joel are the best to work alongside because they 
truly care and help people.</P>

<p><font size=3><b>MAC Prevention and Treatment Guidelines</b></font><br>
Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is a bacterial infection that HIV+ people 
with low T4 cell counts can get. There is no single drug treatment for MAC, but 
multidrug therapy reduces mycobacterial colony counts in the blood. 
Mycobacterial colony counts are a measure of infection. Symptoms improve 
with treatment, especially reduction of fever. Some doctors use the same 
multidrug therapy for maintenance as for treatment of acute MAC.
The bacteria that causes MAC is related to the bacteria that causes 
tuberculosis. But the standard anti-TB drugs, isoniazid (INH) and pyrazinamide 
(PZA), are not effective treatments for MAC. </P>
<p>A Public Health Service Task Force on Prophylaxis and Therapy for MAC has 
released their recommendations for prevention and treatment of MAC in people 
with HIV infection. The Task Force recommends that HIV+ individuals with less 
than 100 T4 cells take 300 mg per day of rifabutin (Mycobutin) as a prevention 
treatment. </P>
<p>If MAC develops, the Task Force recommends a multi-drug treatment regimen. 
Your doctor will discuss with you which drugs might work best. Prevention and 
treatment for MAC in HIV+ children under thirteen years should follow the same 
guidelines recommended by the Task Force. <P>
All the drugs used for prevention and treatment of MAC are described in The 
Network publication, The Guide. This book contains descriptions of most of the 
drugs that are used to treat and prevent AIDS and HIV-related infections.</P>

<p><font size=3><b>Interview with Carlo Mascarenhas</b></font><br>
<I>Carlo is an artist and a Network Member</I><br>
I've been feeling fine for a long time and haven't had anything except some 
minor headaches and fatigue. But my blood counts are very low. My blood 
counts have been low since I found out I was HIV+ in 1988. </P>
<p>IL-3 is supposed to raise white blood cells and platelets. I took it for three 
months by injection. I gave the shots to myself once a day. I was taught at St. 
Vincent's how to give myself injections. It was hard at the beginning. I always 
hated needles. Some days it would take me an hour with the needle pointing at 
my leg. Now I don't even think twice. I give myself the injections in my thigh.
I had no idea if the IL-3 was good for me. I was getting flu symptoms - bad body 
aches, heavy headaches, bad night sweats every night. I was told I'd have that 
kind of reaction for a week or two, but it went on for three months and didn't go 
away. My blood counts improved very little. I was told it might go slowly. I 
wanted to see a more immediate reaction. My quality of life was horrible, even 
though the people running the trial said the treatment was promising. I quit after 
three months.</P>
<p>Now I am taking G-CSF (Neupogen). This treatment is not part of a study. 
Medicaid pays for the Neupogen, which is an approved treatment. I've been 
taking it for 8 months. I'm supposed to take it every day. I've started taking it 
every other day because I've had some side effects for the past three weeks. I 
take a low dose - a quarter of 1 cc. The side effects are night sweats and chills 
at night. I'm sure it's related to the drug, because it only happens when I take 
the Neupogen. Some nights I have to change my shirt.</P>
<p>I take 3 Tylenols or a Motrin half an hour before giving myself an injection. I 
don't like to take all these drugs or to upset my stomach. Taking the Tylenols or 
the Motrin helps with the side effects. I'm still not happy about it, because 
obviously something's wrong. Why am I having side effects now that I wasn't 
having before? </P>
<p>My T cell count is pretty low, but they've been low (right now it's 4) for the past 
five years. My white blood cell count is very low. The Neupogen is helping. 
There was a dramatic change when I first started. Then I was feeling good, so I 
started taking less since I don't like taking all these medications. I have good 
energy.</P>
<p>It's still scary, because I might get an infection. But my blood counts have 
improved with the Neupogen, so I continue taking it every day. <P>
I'm also taking oxandrolone through a study with Don Kotler, MD. I've been 
taking it for the past 9 months. My appetite is stable. The oxandrolone is to help 
me gain weight. I had ulcers a year ago and had lost a lot of weight at that time. I 
couldn't eat. I went to see three doctors and they thought I had CMV which was 
the scariest thing. I didn't have insurance and all my medical care was through 
clinical trials. I had to make decisions about getting disability and Medicaid.
At first I was getting placebo, but after four months I got the oxandrolone. It 
seems to be helping. When I started my weight was 130. Now it's 140, which is 
a good weight for my height and build.</P>
<p>When I first saw Dr. Kotler for the ulcers, he gave me prednisone, an anti-
inflammatory. It felt like hell and I wanted to jump out a window. I was also 
moving. I thought I was going to die. I couldn't sleep for three weeks. No 
sleeping pill would help. After he started reducing the dose, which I knew I only 
had to take for a month, I improved. The ulcers healed. I no longer take the 
prednisone.</P>
<p>Nutrition is the basis for my good health. I don't eat sugar, caffeine, smoke or 
take drugs. I try and eat clean, organic foods as much as possible. I eat red 
meat and chicken, and try to get organic meats. I exercise regularly and do 
yoga.</P>

<p><font size=3><b>G-CSF</b></font><br>
G-CSF, or Neupogen, encourages the growth of white blood cells. This drug is 
approved for the treatment of blood cell growth in people with AIDS. A study of 
G-CSF for the treatment of neutropenia, which is the loss of white blood cells, is 
open at different sites around the country. These studies will be reviewed in the 
next edition of The Experimental Treatment Guide, The Network's directory of 
clinical trials and treatment programs. An article on G-CSF and this study is on 
the back page of this issue of Treatment Review.</P>

<p><font size=3><b>Alternative Treatment  for PCP Approved</b></font><br>
NeuTrexin is a new treatment for moderate to severe PCP pneumonia. 
NeuTrexin is the brand name of a drug called trimetrexate glucoronate. 
NeuTrexin is given by intravenous injection. NeuTrexin has been approved for 
use with a drug called leucovorin for people with PCP who can't take Bactrim, 
either because they can't tolerate it or it's contraindicated. Leucovorin must be 
given with NeuTrexin to protect human cells against the toxic effects of 
NeuTrexin. In clinical trials, NeuTrexin with leucovorin was shown to have less 
efficacy than Bactrim, but it also had fewer side effects. NeuTrexin is expected to 
be available sometime in January, and is currently available through a 
Treatment IND program. Call 1-800-537-9978. To give you an idea of how long 
the approval process can take, the NDA (new drug application) was submitted 
to the FDA in February 1993. The treatment was approved in December. 
Information on help in obtaining coverage is available to patients and 
physicians through the NeuTrexin Reimbursement and Patient Assistance 
Programs. Call 1-800-8-USBIOS. </P>

<p><font size=3><b>Study of Synthetic Herbal Extract</b></font><br>
Several years ago the herb St. John's Wort was tested for its anti-HIV activity. 
Hypericin is an antiviral found in low doses in St. John's Wort. In laboratory tests 
hypericin worked well against HIV and other viruses including CMV and herpes 
simplex. Early human studies had to be stopped because of photosensitivity 
reactions, meaning that people taking the hypericin became extremely sensitive 
to light. A study is now open testing a new formulation of hypericin for the 
treatment of HIV infection. You must have under 350 T4 cells to take part in this 
study. All participants will take hypericin in pill form daily. At least half of the 
participants must have a T4 cell count of more than 50. The study will be looking 
at different dose levels to determine which is safe and effective. You must be 
HIV+, p24 antigen positive, and have a negative pregnancy test within two 
weeks of study entry. Call The Network if you are interested in this study.</P>

<p><font size=3><b>Testing and Counseling Study</b></font><br>
Free  and confidential ongoing HIV testing and counseling is offered through a 
study in New York City. Testing is repeated twice a year. Confidential testing 
means that the results of your test will be recorded with your name in your chart. 
This is not the same as anonymous testing, where you are given a number and 
that is the only match between you and your test results.<P> 
This site is also doing a study of treatment for depression associated with HIV 
infection. Intensive therapy continues for 4 months (up to 17 sessions). After the 
four months of the study, participants are provided with supportive care for 
maintenance and follow-up. Referrals for medical care will be made as needed. 
If you are interested in participating in this study call The Network for more 
information.</P>

<p><font size=3><b>Diet and Protein Study </b></font><br>
One of the ways that people who are HIV positive, as well as those who are HIV 
negative can help in getting clearer answers about nutrition and how it affects 
HIV infection is by taking part in a diet and protein study such as this one. 
There are no experimental drugs given during this study. This study will 
compare two different types of diets. One group will receive one type of food. 
The other group will receive food that contains less protein. This study will 
compare normal to restricted protein diets.<P> 
Participants will be divided into three groups. One group will be HIV+ with T4 
cell counts over 500. The second group will be HIV+ with T4 cell counts under 
500. The third group will be HIV-negative. All participants must be weight stable. 
Participants will be randomly assigned to either the normal or restricted protein 
diet. Each dietary period will last for five days. The diets are designed to 
maintain the participant's admission weight. <P>
Although the restricted diet contains significantly less protein than that of the 
Recommended Dietary Allowance, it is an amount which has no known risks 
associated with it when consumed for five days. <P>
Participants will be admitted to the hospital for two five day stays, and receive 
$200 for each stay. Contact The Network if you are interested in participating.</P>

<p><font size=3><b>G-CSF study for neutropenia</b></font><br>
White blood cells are infection fighting cells in the blood. Without white blood 
cells the body would quickly be overcome with bacterial infections such as 
tuberculosis. In fact, people with AIDS with low white blood cells suffer at the 
expense of common bacterial infections such as clostridium difficile. <P>
G-CSF, or Neupogen,  encourages the growth of white blood cells. G-CSF may 
be a good way to maintain a good level of white blood cells. This drug is 
approved for the treatment of blood cell growth in people with AIDS. A study of 
G-CSF for the treatment of neutropenia, which is the loss of white blood cells, is 
open.  <P>
Call The Network to find out where. This drug is approved for the treatment of 
white blood cell growth in some types of cancer, although not in AIDS. It is a 
very expensive drug. A compassionate use program is available for those 
unable to afford it.<P>
You can get this drug, and help to find out how it works best in people with 
AIDS, by participating in a clinical trial of the drug. You must be HIV+ and have 
an absolute neutrophil count of between 750 and 1000 to participate in this trial. 
Participants will be divided into three groups. G-CSF is given by shot. One 
group will be given G-CSF every day. The second group will be given G-CSF at 
a higher dose one to 3 times a week. The third group will not be treated with G-
CSF. Participants in this third group whose white blood cell counts drop will be 
moved into one of the first two groups for treatment.<P>
Call The Network for information about this and other studies. The spring edition 
of The Experimental Treatment Guide will be available the end of February. Call 
us if you'd like to receive it. The directory costs $10 but there is no charge to 
those unable to afford it.</P>

<p><font size=3><b>In memory of Russ Radley</b></font size=3><br>
Russ Radley, a friend of The Network, and to many people throughout the 
country died last month from AIDS. Russ was diagnosed with AIDS over 8 years 
ago. He, like many other people with AIDS, waged a heroic fight against the 
disease. He helped men, women and children throughout the United States to 
get care and support through his work at Design Industries Foundation for AIDS 
(DIFFA), where he was the founding Executive Director. He offered a helping 
hand to countless organizations and agencies that assist people with AIDS and 
HIV to live their lives to the fullest. Russ had a great sense of humor, and a kind 
word for most everyone he met. We miss him.</P></font><blockquote>

<title>NELFINAVIR PEDIATRICS STUDY</title>

<a href="../index.html"><h4>National AIDS Treatment Advocacy Project</h4></a>

<h3>NELFINAVIR PEDIATRICS STUDY 9/14/96</h3>

<blockquote>


<p>Agouron is initiating a pediatric (including adolescents) study of
nelfinavir, a protease inhibitor, with a powder formulation. The powder comes
in fruit flavors and can be added to milk.  It is an important study because
pediatric research for antiretroviral therapy moves much more slowly than
drug development for adults. There aren't as many treatment options for
children as there are for adults. It is particularly noteworthy that this
trial is studying nelfinavir in newborns.</p>

<p>While adults have three protease inhibitors approved for use, there are none approved for pediatrics, and there are complications for pediatric use of the three approved protease inhibitors. Ritonavir's pediatric liquid formulation is distasteful. Although indinavir is in pediatric clinical study now and it is expected to prove efficacious and safe for most children, it is yet
uncertain whether newborns may be able to take indinavir because of a
bilirubin-related concern. The currently approved adult formulation of
saquinavir has a low bioavailability. </p>

<p>A total of about 30 children will be enrolled in 4 age group cohorts in this
ACTG study: </p>
<ol>
<li>below 3 months (newborns)
<li>3 months to 2 years
<li>2 to 7 years
<li>7 to 18 years
</ol>

<p>This is a dose ranging study; children will be assigned  different doses of
monotherapy of nelfinavir for 6 weeks; then, the best dose will be selected
and offered to study participants on an open-label basis, whereupon study
subjects can take additional approved antivirals in a continuation of the
trial.</p>

<p>It is hoped that the results from this study will be presented at the FDA
Advisory Committee hearing which will consider accelerated approval for
nelfinavir. The hearing is expected to occur in 1st quarter '97, and if
positive data from this study is available, Agouron may seek a pediatric as
well as the expected adult approval.</p>

<P align=center>US Public Health Service/Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines for the Prevention of Opportunistic Infections in Persons Infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus: A Summary</P>

<HR SIZE=3>

<H2>Preface</H2>

In the United States, opportunistic infections reduce the quality and duration of life 
for approximately 1 million persons who have HIV infection <A HREF="preface.html#1">(1)</A>, especially for the estimated 250,000 persons who are severely immunosuppressed, as measured by a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count below 200 cells/uL (<A HREF="preface.html#2">2</A>; CDC, unpublished data). In the late 1980s and early 1990s, efforts to prevent opportunistic infections focused first on chemoprophylaxis against <A HREF="pcp.html">Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP)</A> (<A HREF="preface.html#3">3</A>,<A HREF="preface.html#4">4</A>), and then on chemoprophylaxis against disseminated <A HREF="mac.html">Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)</A> disease (<A HREF="preface.html#5">5</A>).<P>

During the past decade, clinicians and researchers have learned that, in addition 
to P. carinii and MAC, other pathogens can cause disease in patients with HIV 
infection. Knowledge regarding the reduction of risk of exposure to, and thus 
acquisition of, opportunistic pathogens also has increased. During this decade, 
the number of chemoprophylactic regimens available for preventing disease also 
has increased. Information about preventing exposure and preventing disease is 
often published in journals that are not regularly reviewed by health-care 
providers; some of it has not yet been published.<P>

In 1994, the U.S Public Health Service (USPHS)---primarily through the efforts of 
CDC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Infectious Diseases 
Society of America (IDSA) recognized the importance of preventing oportunistic 
infections and the need to consolidate information for health-care providers. In 
response, these organizations initiated an effort to develop comprehensive 
recommendations for the prevention of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected 
persons. Draft recommendations were reviewed by consultants from CDC, NIH, 
and IDSA, as well as by members of other Federal and non-Federal agencies, 
community organizations, physicians caring for HIV-infected persons, and HIV-
infected persons themselves. These recommendations were discussed at a 2-day 
meeting convened by CDC, NIH, and IDSA in Atlanta in September 1994. 
Comments were solicited from the public, and final recommendations were 
approved by USPHS and IDSA. These recommendations were also endorsed by 
the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Infectious Diseases Society of Obstetrics 
and Gynecology, and the Society of Healthcare Epidemiologists of America. The 
recommendations are designed for the use of health-care providers, but they also 
can provide useful information for HIV-infected patients.<P>

The full text of the USPHS/IDSA Guidelines for the Prevention of Opportunistic 
Infections in Persons Infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus is being 
published in a supplement to Clinical Infectious Diseases <A HREF="preface.html#6">(6-8)</A>. This report excerpts the disease-specific recommendations that form the basis for the 
guidelines. These recommendations address 17 opportunistic infections or 
groups of opportunistic infections by providing guidelines on a) preventing 
exposure to the opportunistic pathogens, b) preventing the first episode of disease 
(by chemoprophylaxis or vaccination), and c) preventing disease recurrence (by 
long-term maintenance drug therapy). This report also includes the drug regimens 
used to prevent opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents 
and infants and children.

Several factors were considered in developing these recommendations, including 
a) the level of immunosuppression at which opportunistic disease is most likely to 
occur; b) the incidence of disease; c) the severity of disease in terms of morbidity, 
cost of care (including hospitalization), and mortality; d) the feasibility, efficacy, 
and cost of the prevention measure; e) the impact of the prevention measure on 
the quality of life; and f) (for chemoprophylaxis recommendations) drug toxicities, 
drug interactions, and the potential for the development of drug resistance.

Recommendations are rated according to the strength of the recommendation for 
or against use (letters A-E) and the quality of the evidence supporting the 
recommendation (Roman numerals I-III) <A HREF="preface.html#6">(6)</A>. When applying the letter ratings A-E to recommendations involving chemoprophylaxis, the strength of evidence and magnitude of clinical benefit were balanced against the toxicity, 
drug interactions, and cost of the chemoprophylactic regimen and the feasibility of 
alternative approaches such as early diagnosis and treatment of the opportunistic 
infection. Recommendations designated "A" are supported by evidence that is 
both statistically and clinically persuasive, are strongly recommended, should 
always be offered, and are considered standard care. Those designated "B" are 
recommended for consideration; such measures should generally be offered but 
should involve some discussion of the pros and cons between the provider and 
the patient. Measures designated "C" are considered optional, either because 
evidence of benefit is insufficient or because any proven benefit is minimal from 
the clinical standpoint and may not outweigh either the toxicity, drug interactions, 
or cost of the chemoprophylaxis or the feasibility of alternative approaches. 
Measures designated "D" should generally not be offered; those designated "E" 
are contraindicated. The Roman numeral ratings I-III refer to the quality of 
evidence that forms the basis for the recommendations regarding the use of a 
product or measure for preventing opportunistic infections in HIV-infected 
persons.

Applying this rating system to recommendations regarding prevention of exposure 
was complicated by the lack of information regarding the effectiveness of various 
counseling messages. Therefore, few "prevention of exposure" recommendations 
are rated "A"; many are considered optional (rating "C"). However, use of the 
rating system should facilitate understanding of the relative importance of the 
various prevention recommendations.<P>

The prevention recommendations presented here differ from those previously 
published because they include strategies for preventing many opportunistic 
infections not previously discussed, particularly those associated with prevention 
of exposure. They also modify earlier recommendations. For example, for PCP 
prophylaxis for sulfa-intolerant patients, either dapsone or dapsone plus 
pyrimethamine are now recommended in preference to aerosolized pentamidine. 
For prophylaxis against initial episodes of disseminated MAC disease, the 
threshold of treatment has been lowered from 100 to 75 CD4+ T-lymphocytes/uL. 
Chemoprophylaxis against toxoplasmic encephalitis is now recommended.<P>

In this report, the disease-specific recommendations are not listed in priority order. 
Health-care providers who manage and treat HIV-infected patients should consult 
the overview of the USPHS/IDSA guidelines, which addresses both the initial and 
follow-up evaluations of the HIV-infected patient. In addition to opportunistic 
infections addressed in the disease-specific recommendations, the overview of the 
guidelines briefly addresses other infections that occur with increased frequency 
in HIV-infected persons (e.g., syphilis, hepatitis B, and other sexually transmitted 
diseases). Sections on preventing opportunistic infections in children and in 
pregnant women are included. In this report, only the tables concerning drugs and 
doses in adults and children and the summary of prevention of exposure recommendations have been excerpted from the overview. The approach to preventing opportunistic infections and other infections commonly encountered in HIV-infected persons, as described in the overview, should be integrated with other aspects of HIV care, as described elsewhere. <A HREF="preface.html#9">(9)</A><P>

(1) HIV-infected persons should be tested for IgG antibody to Toxoplasma soon 
after the diagnosis of HIV infection to detect latent infection with Toxoplasma 
gondii (BIII).<P>

(2) All HIV-infected persons, but particularly those who lack IgG antibody to 
Toxoplasma, should be counseled about the various sources of toxoplasmic 
infection. They should be advised not to eat raw or undercooked meat, particularly 
undercooked pork, lamb, or venison (BIII). Specifically, meat should be cooked to 
an internal temperature of 150 F; meat cooked until no longer pink inside 
generally has an internal temperature of 165 F and therefore satisfies this 
requirement. HIV-infected persons should wash their hands after contact with raw 
meat and after gardening or other contact with soil; in addition, they should wash 
fruits and vegetables well before eating them raw (BIII). If the patient owns a cat, 
the litter box should be changed daily, preferably by an HIV-negative, 
nonpregnant person; alternatively, the patient should wash the hands thoroughly 
after changing the litter box (BIII). Patients should be encouraged to keep their 
cats inside and not to adopt or handle stray cats (BIII). Cats should be fed only 
canned or dried commercial food or well-cooked table food, not raw or 
undercooked meats (BIII). Patients need not be advised to part with their cats or to 
have their cats tested for toxoplasmosis (EII). <P>

<A NAME="toxdis"><H3>Prevention of Disease</H3></A>

(3) Toxoplasma-seropositive patients with a CD4+ lymphocyte count of less than 
100/gmL should receive prophylaxis against toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) (AII). 
The doses of TMP-SMZ recommended for PCP prophylaxis appear to be effective 
against TE as well (AII). If patients cannot tolerate TMP-SMZ, the regimens 
including dapsone plus pyrimethamine that are recommended for PCP 
prophylaxis provide protection against TE (AI). Prophylactic monotherapy with 
dapsone, pyrimethamine, azithromycin, clarithromycin, or atovaquone cannot be 
recommended on the basis of current data (DII). Aerosolized pentamidine does 
not afford protection against TE (EI).<P>

(4) Toxoplasma-seronegative persons who are not taking a PCP prophylactic 
regimen known to be active against TE should be retested for IgG antibody to 
Toxoplasma when their CD4+ lymphocyte count falls below 100/gmL to determine 
whether they have seroconverted and are therefore at risk for TE (CIII). Patients 
who have seroconverted should receive prophylaxis for TE as described above 
(AII). <P>

<A NAME="toxrec"><H3>Prevention of Recurrence</H3></A>

(5) Patients who have had TE should receive lifelong suppressive therapy with 
drugs active against Toxoplasma to prevent relapse (AI). The combination of 
pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine and leucovorin is highly effective for this purpose 
(AII). A commonly used regimen for patients who cannot tolerate sulfa drugs is 
pyrimethamine plus clindamycin (AII); however, only the combination of 
pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine appears to provide protection against PCP as 
well (AII). <P>

<A NAME="toxped"><H3>Pediatric Note</H3></A>

(6) Current data are insufficient for the formulation of specific guidelines for 
children. The provider should consider the recommendations for adults; children 
greater than 12 months of age who are seropositive for IgG antibody to 
Toxoplasma, have a CD4+ lymphocyte count of less than 100/uL, and are not 
already taking medication effective against Toxoplasma may be considered as 
candidates for chemoprophylaxis (CIII). Some providers would consider opting for 
chemoprophylaxis for very young children with higher CD4+ lymphocyte counts 
consistent with severe immunosuppression <A HREF="toxo.html#12">(12)</A> and with evidence of toxoplasmic 
infection. <P>

<A NAME="toxpreg"><H3>Notes Regarding Pregnancy</H3></A>

(7) Because of the low incidence of TE during pregnancy and the possible risk 
associated with pyrimethamine treatment, chemoprophylaxis with pyrimethamine-
containing regimens can reasonably be deferred until after pregnancy for women 
who are seropositive for IgG antibody to Toxoplasma (CIII). TMP-SMZ can be 
administered as described for prophylaxis of PCP. For prophylaxis of recurrent 
TE, pyrimethamine should be used with caution (CIII).<P>

(8) In rare cases, HIV-infected pregnant women with serological evidence of 
remote toxoplasmic infection have transmitted Toxoplasma to the fetus in utero. 
Pregnant HIV-infected women who have evidence of primary toxoplasmic infection 
or active toxoplasmosis (including TE) should be evaluated during pregnancy in 
consultation with appropriate specialists (CIII). Infants born to women with 
serological evidence of infections with HIV and Toxoplasma should be evaluated 
for congenital toxoplasmosis (CIII).<P>

<A NAME="tbprev"><H3>Prevention of Exposure</H3></A>

(1) HIV-infected persons should be advised that certain activities and occupations 
may increase the likelihood of exposure to tuberculosis (BIII). These include 
volunteer work or employment in health care facilities, correctional institutions, 
and shelters for the homeless as well as in other settings identified as high risk by 
local health authorities. Decisions about whether to continue with activities in 
these settings should be made in conjunction with the health care provider and 
should take into account such factors as the patient's specific duties in the 
workplace, the prevalence of tuberculosis in the community, and the degree to 
which precautions are taken to prevent the transmission of tuberculosis in the 
workplace (BIII). Whether or not the patient continues with such activities may 
affect the frequency with which screening for tuberculosis needs to be conducted. <P>

<A NAME="tbdis"><H3>Prevention of Disease</H3></A>

(2) When HIV infection is first recognized, the patient should be screened by the 
Mantoux method with intermediate-strength (5-TU) PPD (AI). Routine evaluation 
for anergy is controversial; some experts recommend anergy testing for persons in 
settings where there is an increased risk of infection with Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis (i.e., in areas where the prevalence of such infection is greater than 
10%) (CIII).<P>

(3) All HIV-infected persons with a positive result in the tuberculin skin test (TST; 
greater than or equal to 5 mm of induration) should undergo chest radiography 
and clinical evaluation for the exclusion of active tuberculosis. HIV-infected 
individuals who have symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis should undergo chest 
radiography and clinical evaluation regardless of their TST status (AII).<P>

(4) All HIV-infected persons with a positive TST result who have no evidence of 
active tuberculosis and no history of treatment or prophylaxis for tuberculosis 
should receive 12 months of preventive chemotherapy with isoniazid (AI). Since 
HIV-infected persons are at risk for peripheral neuropathy, those receiving 
isoniazid should also receive pyridoxine (BIII). The decision to use alternative 
antimycobacterial agents for chemoprophylaxis should be based on the relative 
risk of exposure to resistant organisms and may require consultation with public 
health authorities (AII). The need for direct observation as a means of 
documenting compliance with chemoprophylaxis should be considered on an 
individual basis (BIII).<P>

(5) HIV-infected individuals who are close contacts of persons with infectious 
tuberculosis (i.e., acid-fast bacillary smear-positive pulmonary disease) should 
receive preventive therapy--regardless of TST results or prior courses of 
chemoprophylaxis--after active tuberculosis has been excluded (AII). Such 
persons should be tested with 5-TU PPD. If the TST result is initially negative, the 
individual should be evaluated again 3 months after the discontinuation of contact 
with the infectious source, and the information obtained should be considered in 
the course of decisions about whether chemoprophylaxis should continue (BIII).<P>

(6) TST-negative, HIV-infected persons from risk groups or geographic areas with 
a high prevalence of M. tuberculosis infection (greater than 10%) may be at 
increased risk of tuberculosis. Some experts recommend preventive therapy for 
anergic individuals or perhaps for all persons in this category (CIII). However, the 
efficacy of preventive therapy in this group has not been demonstrated, and 
decisions concerning the use of chemoprophylaxis in these situations must be 
individualized.<P>

(7) Although the reliability of the TST may diminish as the CD4+ lymphocyte 
count declines, testing should be repeated at least annually for HIV-infected 
persons who are TST-negative on initial evaluation (BIII). In addition to 
documenting tuberculous infection, TST conversion in an HIV-infected person 
should alert health care providers to the possibility of an infectious case in the 
environment and lead to notification of public health officials for investigation to 
identify a possible source case.<P>

(8) The administration of BCG vaccine to HIV-infected persons is contraindicated 
because of its potential to cause disseminated disease (EII). <P>

<A NAME="tbrec"><H3>Prevention of Recurrence</H3></A>

(9) Chronic suppressive therapy for a patient who has successfully completed a 
recommended regimen of treatment for tuberculosis is not necessary (EII).<P>

<A NAME="tbped"><H3>Pediatric Note</H3></A>

(10) All infants born to HIV-infected mothers should have a TST (5-TU PPD) at 9-
12 months of age (CIII). All children living in households with M. tuberculosis-
infected (TST-positive) persons should be evaluated for tuberculosis <A HREF="tb.html#13">(13)</A> (CIII); 
those exposed to a person with active tuberculosis should receive preventive 
therapy after active tuberculosis has been excluded (AII).<P>

<A NAME="tbpreg"><H3>Note Regarding Pregnancy</H3></A>

(11) HIV-infected pregnant women who have a positive TST result without 
evidence of active tuberculosis should receive standard chemoprophylaxis (AII). 
When possible, chest radiography should be undertaken and chemoprophylaxis 
should be initiated after the first trimester in order to avoid the critical period of 
major organogenesis. Preventive therapy with isoniazid should be accompanied 
by treatment with pyridoxine so that peripheral neuropathy does not develop. 
Alternative regimens (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) should be used with caution during 
pregnancy.<P>

<A NAME="resprev"><H3>Prevention of Exposure</H3></A>

(1) Because Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are 
common in the community, there is no effective way to reduce exposure to these 
bacteria. <P>

<A NAME="resdis"><H3>Prevention of Disease</H3></A>

(2) As soon as possible after HIV infection is diagnosed, adults should receive a 
single dose of 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (BIII). This 
recommendation is especially pertinent in light of the increasing incidence of 
invasive infections with drug-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae. Although the 
administration of protein-polysaccharide conjugate H. influenzae type b vaccine 
may be considered, data are insufficient to recommend the use of this vaccine in 
HIV-infected adults at this time.<P>

(3) TMP-SMZ, administered daily, may be effective in preventing serious bacterial 
respiratory infections (although not those caused by drug-resistant S. 
pneumoniae); this fact should be considered in the selection of an agent for PCP 
prophylaxis (AII). However, indiscriminate use of this drug (when not indicated for 
PCP prophylaxis or other specific reasons) may promote the development of 
resistant organisms.<P>

(4) An absolute neutrophil count that is depressed because of HIV disease or drug 
therapy may be increased by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or 
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). However, data are 
insufficient for recommendations concerning the use of G-CSF or GM-CSF to 
prevent bacterial infections in HIV-infected patients with neutropenia. <P>

<A NAME="resrec"><H3>Prevention of Recurrence</H3></A>

(5) Some clinicians may choose to offer antibiotic chemoprophylaxis to HIV-
infected patients with recurrent serious bacterial respiratory infections (BIII). TMP-
SMZ, administered for PCP prophylaxis, is appropriate for drug-sensitive 
organisms.<P>

(6) All invasive pneumococcal isolates from HIV-infected patients should be tested 
for susceptibility to b-lactam antibiotics, and local patterns of resistance should be 
considered in the choice of regimens for empirical treatment (AII). Invasive 
infections due to H. influenzae should be treated with regimens effective against 
b-lactamase-producing strains until drug susceptibilities are known (AII).<P>

<A NAME="resped"><H3>Pediatric Notes</H3></A>

(7) Children with HIV infection should receive H. influenzae type b vaccine in 
accordance with the guidelines of the Advisory Committee for Immunization 
Practices <A HREF="bacresp.html#14">(14)</A> and the American Academy of Pediatrics <A HREF="bacresp.html#13">(13)</A> (AII). Children greater 
than 2 years of age should also receive 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal 
vaccine (BII).<P>

(8) To prevent serious bacterial infections in HIV-infected children with 
documented antibody deficiency, clinicians should use intravenous 
immunoglobulin (IVIG) (AI). The administration of IVIG should also be considered 
for HIV-infected children with recurrent serious bacterial infections (AI), but such 
treatment may not provide additional benefit to children receiving daily TMP-SMZ. <P>

<A NAME="entprev"><H3>Prevention of Exposure</H3></A>

<A NAME="entfood"><B>Food</B><P></A>

(1) Health care providers should advise HIV-infected persons not to eat raw or 
undercooked eggs (including foods that may contain raw eggs--e.g., some 
preparations of hollandaise sauce, Caesar and other salad dressings, and 
mayonnaise); raw or undercooked poultry, meat, or seafood; or unpasteurized 
dairy products. Poultry and meat should be well cooked and should not be pink in 
the middle (internal temperature, greater than 165 F). Produce should be 
thoroughly washed before being eaten (BIII).<P>

(2) Health care providers should advise HIV-infected persons to avoid cross-
contamination of foods. For example, uncooked meats should not come into 
contact with other foods, and hands, cutting boards, counters, and knives and 
other utensils should be washed thoroughly after contact with uncooked foods 
(BIII).<P>

(3) Health care providers should advise HIV-infected persons that, although the 
incidence of listeriosis is low, it is a serious disease that occurs with unusually 
high frequency among HIV-infected persons who are severely 
immunosuppressed. Such persons may choose to avoid soft cheeses because 
some studies have shown an association between these foods and listeriosis. 
These studies have also documented an association between ready-to-eat foods 
(e.g., hot dogs and cold cuts from delicatessen counters) and listeriosis. An 
immunosuppressed, HIV-infected person who wishes to reduce the risk of food-
borne disease as much as possible may choose to re-heat such foods until they 
are steaming hot before eating them (CIII). <P>

<A NAME="entpets"><B>Pets</B><P></A>

(4) When obtaining a new pet, HIV-infected persons should avoid young animals 
(less than 6 months of age), especially those with diarrhea (BIII).<P>

(5) HIV-infected persons should avoid contact with animals that have diarrhea 
(BIII). HIV-infected pet owners should seek veterinary care for animals with 
diarrheal illness, and a fecal sample from such animals should be examined for 
Cryptosporidium, Salmonella, and Campylobacter.<P>

(6) HIV-infected persons should wash their hands after handling pets (especially 
before eating) and should avoid contact with pets' feces (BIII).<P>

(7) HIV-infected persons should avoid contact with reptiles (such as snakes, 
lizards, and turtles) because of the risk of salmonellosis (BIII). <P>

<A NAME="entrav"><B>Travel</B><P></A>

(8) The risk of food- and waterborne infections among immunosuppressed, HIV- 
infected persons is magnified during travel to developing countries. Those who 
elect to travel to such countries should avoid foods and beverages that may be 
contaminated, particularly raw fruits and vegetables, raw or undercooked seafood 
or meat, tap water, ice made with tap water, unpasteurized milk and dairy 
products, and items sold by street vendors (AII). Foods and beverages that are 
generally safe include steaming-hot foods, fruits that are peeled by the traveler, 
bottled (especially carbonated) beverages, hot coffee and tea, beer, wine, and 
water brought to a rolling boil for 1 minute (AII). Treatment of water with iodine or 
chlorine may not be as effective as boiling but can be used when boiling is not 
practical (BIII).<P>

<A NAME="entdis"><H3>Prevention of Disease</H3></A>

(9) Prophylactic antimicrobial agents are not generally recommended for travelers 
(DIII). The effectiveness of these agents depends upon local antimicrobial-
resistance patterns of gastrointestinal pathogens, which are seldom known. 
Moreover, these agents can elicit adverse reactions and can promote the 
emergence of resistant organisms. However, for HIV-infected travelers, 
antimicrobial prophylaxis may be considered, depending upon the level of 
immunosuppression and the region and duration of travel (CIII).<P>

The use of fluoroquinolones--such as ciprofloxacin (500 mg/d)- -can be 
considered when prophylaxis is deemed necessary (BIII). As an alternative (e.g., 
for children, pregnant women, and persons already taking TMP-SMZ for PCP 
prophylaxis), TMP-SMZ may offer some protection against traveler's diarrhea 
(BIII). The risk of toxicity should be considered before treatment with TMP-SMZ is 
initiated solely because of travel.<P>

(10) Antimicrobial agents such as fluoroquinolones (e.g., 500 mg of ciprofloxacin 
b.i.d. for 3-7 days) should be given to patients before their departure, to be taken 
empirically should traveler's diarrhea develop (BIII). Alternative antibiotics for 
children and pregnant women should be discussed (CIII). Travelers should 
consult a physician if their diarrhea is severe and does not respond to empirical 
therapy, if their stools contain blood, if fever is accompanied by shaking chills, or if 
dehydration develops. Antiperistaltic agents such as diphenoxylate and 
loperamide can be used for the treatment of mild diarrhea. However, the use of 
these drugs should be discontinued if symptoms persist beyond 48 hours. 
Moreover, these agents should not be given to patients with high fever or with 
blood in the stool (AII).<P>

(11) Some experts recommend that HIV-infected persons with salmonella 
gastroenteritis receive antimicrobial therapy to prevent extraintestinal spread. 
However, no controlled study has demonstrated a beneficial effect of such 
treatment, and some studies of immunocompetent persons have suggested that 
antimicrobial therapy can lengthen the shedding period. The fluoroquinolones--
primarily ciprofloxacin (750 mg b.i.d. for 14 days)--can be used when 
antimicrobial therapy is opted for (CIII).<P>

<A NAME="entrec"><H3>Prevention of Recurrence</H3></A>

(12) HIV-infected persons with salmonella septicemia require long-term therapy 
for the prevention of recurrence. The fluoroquinolones, primarily ciprofloxacin, are 
usually the drugs of choice for susceptible organisms (BII).

(13) Household contacts of HIV-infected persons with salmonellosis or shigellosis 
should be evaluated for asymptomatic carriage of Salmonella or Shigella so that 
strict hygienic measures and/or antimicrobial therapy can be instituted and 
recurrent transmission to the HIV-infected person can be prevented (CIII).<P>

<A NAME="entped"><H3>Pediatric Notes</H3></A>

(14) Like HIV-infected adults, HIV-infected children should wash their hands after 
handling pets (especially before eating) and should avoid contact with pets' feces. 
Hand washing should be supervised (BIII).<P>

(15) HIV-exposed infants less than 3 months of age and all HIV-infected children 
with severe immunosuppression should receive treatment for salmonella 
gastroenteritis to prevent extraintestinal spread. Possible choices of antibiotics 
include TMP-SMZ, ampicillin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, or chloramphenicol; 
ciprofloxacin may be considered for the treatment of children greater than 6 years 
of age (CIII).<P>

(16) HIV-infected children with salmonella septicemia require long-term therapy 
for the prevention of recurrence. TMP-SMZ is the drug of choice; ampicillin or 
chloramphenicol can be used if the organism is susceptible. Ciprofloxacin may be 
considered for the treatment of children greater than 6 years of age (CIII). <A HREF="bacent.html#17">(17)</A> 
Antiperistaltic drugs are not recommended for children (DIII).<P>

<A NAME="entpreg"><H3>Notes Regarding Pregnancy</H3></A>

(18) Since both pregnancy and HIV infection confer a risk for listeriosis, pregnant 
HIV-infected women should pay particular attention to recommendations 
concerned with this disease (BII).<P>

(19) Fluoroquinolones should not be used during pregnancy. TMP-SMZ may offer 
some protection against traveler's diarrhea.<P>

(1) HIV-infected persons, particularly those who are severely immunosuppressed, 
are at unusually high risk of developing relatively severe disease due to Bartonella 
species. These individuals should consider the potential risks of cat ownership 
(CIII). Those who elect to acquire a cat should adopt or purchase an older animal 
(greater than 1 year of age) that is in good health (BII).<P>

(2) Although declawing is not generally advised, HIV-infected persons should 
avoid rough play with cats and situations in which scratches are likely (BII). Any 
cat-associated wound should be washed promptly (CIII). HIV-infected persons 
should not allow cats to lick open cuts or wounds (BIII).<P>

(3) Care of cats should include flea control (CIII).<P>

(4) There is no evidence of benefit to cat or owner from routine culture or 
serological testing of the pet for Bartonella infection (DII). <P>

(1) HIV-infected persons should use latex condoms during every act of sexual 
intercourse to reduce the risk of exposure to herpes simplex virus (HSV) and to 
other sexually transmitted pathogens (AII). They should specifically avoid sexual 
contact when herpetic lesions (genital or orolabial) are evident (AII). <P>

(2) Prophylaxis of initial episodes of HSV disease is not recommended <A HREF="simplex.html#*">*</A> (DIII).<P>

<A NAME="simrec"><H3>Prevention of recurrence</H3></A>

(3) Because acute episodes of HSV infection can be treated successfully, chronic 
therapy with acyclovir is not required after lesions resolve. However, persons with 
frequent or severe recurrences can be given daily suppressive therapy with oral 
acyclovir (AI). Intravenous foscarnet can be used for the treatment of infection due 
to acyclovir-resistant isolates of HSV, which are routinely resistant to ganciclovir 
as well (AI).<P>

(5) The effectiveness of suppressive treatment with acyclovir in reducing the risk

close contact with a patient with chickenpox or shingles (AI). Data are lacking on 
the effectiveness of acyclovir for preventing chickenpox in HIV-infected children or 
adults.<P>

<A NAME="hpvprev"><H3>Prevention of Exposure</H3></A>

(1) HIV-infected persons should use latex condoms during every act of sexual 
intercourse to reduce the risk of exposure to human papillomavirus (HPV) as well 
as to other sexually transmitted pathogens (AII).
<P>

<A NAME="hpvdis"><H3>Prevention of Disease</H3></A>

<A NAME="women"><H3>HPV-Associated Genital Epithelial Cancers in HIV-Infected Women</H3></A>

(2) HIV-infected women should have annual cervical Pap smears as part of their 
initial and routine gynecologic care. In accordance with the recommendation of the 
Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (9), a Pap smear should be obtained 
twice in the first year after diagnosis of HIV infection and, if the results are normal, 
annually thereafter (AII).<P>

(3) If an HIV-infected woman has a history of abnormal Pap smears, the caregiver 
may choose to monitor this individual with Pap smears every 6 months (BIII).<P>

(4) If the initial or follow-up Pap smear indicates inflammation with reactive 
squamous cellular changes, further management should be guided by diagnosis 
of the cause of the inflammation, and another Pap smear should be collected 
within 3 months (BIII). HIV-infected women with Pap smears showing only atypical 
cells of undetermined significance can be monitored with annual Pap smears 
(BIII).<P>

(5) Controversy exists concerning the management of HIV-infected women with 
low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) evident on the cervical Pap 
smear; the natural history of this finding in this population has not yet been well 
defined. Some experts would collect another Pap smear within 3 months. If 
subsequent Pap smears again showed low-grade SIL, some of these authorities 
would refer the patient for colposcopic evaluation and biopsy (if indicated); while 
others would monitor compliant patients with repeat Pap smears at frequent 
intervals (e.g., every 3-6 months) (BIII). Other experts would refer all HIV-infected 
patients with low-grade SIL for colposcopy (BIII).<P>

(6) If a Pap smear indicates high-grade SIL or squamous cell carcinoma, the 
woman should be referred for colposcopic examination and, if indicated, 
colposcopically directed biopsy (AI).<P>

<A NAME="men"><H3>HPV-Associated Anal Intraepithelial Neoplasia and Anal Cancer in HIV-Infected 
Men Who Have Sex with Men</H3></A>

(7) Although the risks for anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) and anal cancer are 
increased among HIV-infected men who have sex with men, the role of anal 
cytological screening and treatment of AIN in preventing anal cancer in these men 
is not well defined. Therefore, no recommendations can be made for periodic anal 
cytological screening for the detection and treatment of AIN.<P>

<A NAME="hpvrec"><H3>Prevention of Recurrence</H3></A>

(8) The risks for recurrence of SIL and cervical cancer after conventional therapy 
are increased among HIV-infected women. The prevention of illness associated 
with recurrence depends on careful follow-up of patients after treatment. Patients 
should be monitored with frequent cytological screening and, when indicated, with 
colposcopic examination for recurrent lesions (AI).<P>

<A NAME="hpvped"><H3>Pediatric Note</H3></A>

(9) Newborns have been known to acquire laryngeal HPV from their mothers. No 
recommendations can currently be made to prevent such acquisition. <P>

<title>PWA Health Group: albendazole</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#5c4033" vlink="#545454">
<img src="../gifs/pwa.gif">

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=left><h3>ALBENDAZOLE INFO SHEET</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><b>What is it?</b><br>
Albendazole (Zentel) is an oral drug used to treat a variety of worm infections. It is related to mebendazole - a drug approved in the United States as Vermox. Albendazole is approved in several European and most Third World countries. The PWA Health Group helps import it from Mexico for PWAs with microsporidiosis. To obtain albendazole from the PWA Health Group, you must have a prescription from your doctor.</p>

<p><b>Microsporidiosis</b><br>
Microsporidiosis is a devastating, life threatening infection in people with AIDS. It can cause disease all over the body (lungs, eyes, etc), but it most often infects the gut and causes diarrhea. There is no proven treatment. In a number of uncontrolled studies, albendazole has reduced diarrhea.</p>

<p>Microsporidiosis is hard to diagnose. It can be hard to find even with an electron microscope or biopsy. There are new stool tests (spring, '95) which may help -call us if you need further info. Many docs use albendazole empirically, meaning they use the drug to do the diagnosis. If the stool test is not conclusive, they'll give you albendazole. If your diarrhea gets better, bingo - the cause was microsporidiosis.</p>

<p>Treating diarrhea is tricky, but important to follow up on. If you have a diagnosis of microspordiosis, and albendazole doesn't, it could be because: 1) it can take up to 2+ months before the drug works, 2) there are different kinds of microsporidiosis, and albendazole works better with some than others (see below), or 3) other bugs are causing the diarrhea.</p>

<p><b>Prophylaxis?</b><br>
There is evidence from a couple of studies that people can have microsporidiosis and not have diarrhea or other symptoms. Some people who have test positive for microsporidiosis and have no symptoms, take albendazole as a way to prevent getting diarrhea. Albendazole has never been tested for microsporidiosis prophylaxis, so we have NO idea if this will work or not. In fact, we have no idea if everyone who has microsporidiosis will get diarrhea. It may be that many PWAs with microsporidiosis will never get sick from it.</p>

<p>Albendazole might cause problems if you are taking the protease inhibitor Norvir (ritonavir/Abbott). Talk to your doctor!!!!</p>

<p><b>Albendazole and Microsporidiosis</b><br>
Albendazole works well for many people, but not for others. Why not? One - the drug is hard to absorb. It won't work if you don't have enough of it in your blood. Two - there are hundreds of kinds of microsporidiosis. Albendazole works really well against one called Septata. It works much less well against a more common kind called E. bieneusi.</p>

<p>The biggest clinical trial of albendazole so far included 29 PWAs with chronic diarrhea and weight loss. After taking 400 mg 2x/day for a month, their diarrhea improved and most people gained weight. Most people had E. bieneusi. Albendazole lowered the amount of parasites in some people, but it did not kill the infection in anyone with E. bieneusi. Another study of 19 PWAs taking the same dose reported that diarrhea completely stopped in 9 PWAs, and 3 others had 50% less diarrhea. Most studies and clinical practice report that diarrhea returns once you stop the drug.</p>

<p><b>Side Effects and Toxicity</b><br>
A number of studies report that albendazole is well tolerated. Some PWAs report stomach aches. If taken at higher doses and/or for a long period of time, other side effects have been reported: elevated liver enzymes, headaches, hair loss, low levels of white blood cells (neutropenia), fever, and itching.</p>

<p>Albendazole causes birth defects in rats. Judging by how albendazole works, it would probably cause similar birth defects in people. Use birth control and avoid getting pregnant, or getting anyone pregnant, while taking this drug.</p>

<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=500 width=2 alt="" align=right>
<blockquote>

<p><b>Dosing</b><br>
Doctors currently prescribe anywhere from 400 mg to 1600 mg twice a day, -most commonly 1200 mg/day. Past studies used 400 mg 2x/day, but this dose did not work for everyone, and did not clear out the infection. The current American trial starts people at 800 mg 2x/day.</p>

<p>Higher doses seem to work better; people can respond to higher doses when lower doses haven't worked; and it can take up to two months for albendazole to work against <i>E. bieneusi</i>. Sadly, we have no data yet on combination therapy.</p>

<p><b>Other Potential Treatments For Microsporidiosis</b><br>
Flagyl: in one study of 19 PWAs taking 500 mg of Flagyl 3x/day, 5 got 
better, and 10 got somewhat better. One month later, off drug, 12 PWAs had active microsporidiosis again. Biopsies showed that Flagyl didn't kill off the bug. A different study of Flagyl in PWAs with <i>E. bieneusi</i> had dismal results - the drug helped only somewhat with symptoms.</p>

<p><b>Mepron</b><br>
In a small study of 8 PWAs taking 750 mg 3x/day, Mepron lessened diarrhea in all 8 PWAs, on average 13 days after starting treatment. People gained an average of 9 lbs, but all four with E. bieneusi developed active microsporidiosis immediately when they stopped taking the drug.</p>

<P><b><a href="../../network/access/drugs/itra.html">Itraconazole</a></b><br>
Used as a last resort for a PWA with an undiagnosed eye infection, 200 mg 2x/day itraconazole cleared up what later tests showed to be microsporidiosis infection in the eye. Test tube studies have since shown that itraconazole interferes with the life cycle of microsporidiosis. Defeating E. Bieneusi will probably take a combo of drugs. An obvious combination is Mepron with albendazole, but this is only being studied in Europe. One test tube study suggested that itraconazole's effectiveness was greatly boosted with the addition of some unlikely drugs, like nifedipine (a calcium channel blocker). Other drugs and combinations currently under study in Europe are: albendazole + metromidazole (1500 mg/h); sulfadiazine 4g/h + pyrimethamine; Mepron 3000 mg/h; doxycycline 200 mg/h + nifuroxazide 1200 mg/h; itraconazole 400 mg/h; flubendazole 200 mg/h; chloroquine 300 mg/h; and paromomycin 3g/h.</p>

<P><b>Albendazole and Cryptosporidiosis</b><br>
Albendazole has also been given to people with <a href="../../network/simple/crypto.html">cryptosporidiosis</a> in a small, uncontrolled study. It did not seem to help very much.</p>

<p><b>How Can You Get Albendazole?</b><br>
There are three ways you can get albendazole: a free drug program from the company, a clinical trial, or from us.</p>

<p><b>Compassionate use</b><br>
Your doctor can enroll you in a free, easier, compassionate use program run by Smith-Kline Beecham. You do not need a colonoscopy. Your doctor just needs to confirm that he or she believes that you have microsporidiosis. The company says they'll get drug to you within 3 weeks (down from 4-8 weeks in the past). The company is also working (spring 1995) with the FDA to waive the IRB approval process or arrange for a national IRB. To get enrolled, your doctor should call: (800)877-7074 A <a href="../../network/trials/micro.html">clinical trial</a> offering drug or placebo (50-50 chance) is now enrolling across the country. After 4 weeks, everyone gets drug. Anyone who gets sicker during the trial will be switched over to drug. After the three months of the trial, everyone in the trial is rolled into the compassionate use program. There is a $100 reimbursement for participating in the trial. Finally, if you try to enter the trial, and don't qualify, you will be offered compassionate use.</p>

<p>This trial is critical if albendazole is ever going to get FDA approval as a treatment for microsporidiosis. Approval is the only way that this drug will get to the all the PWAs who need it. It is also critical for figuring out the uses and limitations of albendazole. To find out more about this trial, please call: 1/800-TRIALS-A. In New York, you can call Doug Dieterich's office at 212/986-3593.</p>

<p><b>What We Carry</b><br>
We import Zentel brand albendazole from Mexico, made by SmithKline Beecham. It comes in boxes of 6 tablets 200 mg each. To order from us, you will need a prescription.</p>

<p><b><a name="roche">Monitoring</a>, Not Management<br>
Roche Requests Approval from FDA’s Blood Products Committee for Its PCR Diagnostic<br>
7/10ths a log of ‘noise’</b></p>

<p>On Thursday, March 21, the Food &amp; Drug Administration convened a hearing of the Blood Products Advisory Committee to discuss marketing of Hoffmann-La Roche's viral load kit, known as the Amplicor HIV Monitor™ Kit.</p>
 
<p>The Amplicor kit is a PCR-based assay for quantitative measurement of HIV viral RNA in plasma. The test does not distinguish between infectious and non-infectious viral particles (which is relevant because antiretroviral treatment with protease inhibitors is believed to result in the production of mostly non-infectious viral particles). The FDA emphasized repeatedly that it was not asking the committee to vote on whether to approve the Roche PCR itself; rather, they were to vote on the kinds of claims that could be made. In fact, the meeting’s outcome was sufficiently predetermined (surprise) that the hearing was scheduled only for the afternoon (following a discussion of a new hepatitis C PCR test kit, and preceding a discussion of Mad Cow Disease). </p>

<p>At FDA's request, Hoffmann-La Roche identified three kinds of claims that might be made for their test: 1) Prognosis, or staging of disease. The Roche PCR test would allow doctors to distinguish patients at different stages of HIV progression. 2) Therapeutic monitoring. The test might also allow doctors to monitor patients to determine whether or not they were having a response to antiviral therapy (without determining whether this response was beneficial or not). In addition, researchers could use the test to determine whether groups of patients were having a response to antiviral therapy (as in clinical trials), potentially speeding the review of new drugs. 3) Patient management. HIV care providers could initiate, change and stop therapy based on test results.</p>

<p>Roche was requesting FDA approval for the first two uses (prognosis and therapeutic monitoring) for their PCR test kit, but acknowledged that there is not yet data to support claims for the third use. The Amplicor PCR test kit can reliably measure viral RNA particles in the range of 400 to 750,000 copies/mL. It has no cross-reactivity with viruses, bacteria, mycobacteria and protozoans which commonly affect HIV-infected patients. It can reliably detect 5-fold differences (about .7 log) with 95&#37; confidence.</p>

<p>To support the claim for prognostic value, the company submitted data from patients in virology substudies of ACTG 116A (N=153, sub-study only) and 116B/117 (n=99, sub-study only).  In ACTG 116A, baseline RNA was clearly associated with risk of an opportunistic infection or death (p=0.02) as was the log CD4+ count (p=0.0001). In ACTG 116B/117, however, only log CD4+ count and AIDS diagnosis at baseline were associated with risk of disease progression—not baseline RNA copy number. (This failure is very likely explained by genotype and phenotype alterations in the virus as a result of extended AZT exposure; median duration of prior AZT in 116B/117 was 14 months). A separate series of supportive data, however, presented by Drs. Robert Coombs and Douglas Mayers, convinced the committee that the Roche PCR test does have prognostic value.</p>

<p>With data from an ACTG combination study of saquinavir, AZT and ddC, (ACTG 229) Roche argued that its PCR test could reliably quantify RNA changes following initiation of antiretroviral therapy. (In the 229 study, for instance, patients taking triple drug combination therapy (AZT+ddC+SQV) had RNA reductions of about 0.8 log, whereas patients taking AZT+ddC had only a 0.3 log reduction, and patients taking SQV+AZT had only a 0.2 log reduction.)</p>

<p>In addition, Roche representatives presented data from another saquinavir study NV14256, which compared ddC and SQV monotherapy to the two drugs together in relatively heavily pre-treated patients. Patients taking saquinavir alone experienced only a 0.1 log reduction in RNA, while patients taking ddC had about a 0.3 log reduction. Patients taking the combination regimen, however,  showed approximately a 0.6 log reduction in RNA.  In both studies, 229 and NV14256, there was a strong correlation between HIV RNA levels as measured by the Roche Amplicor PCR test kit, and measurements using the quantitative PBMC microculture methodology.</p>

<p>Again citing the ACTG 116A data, Roche also argued that post-therapeutic changes in RNA levels could predict clinical outcome. Indeed in 116A, there was a significant correlation between log change in viral RNA at week 8, and clinical outcome (p=0.013). However again, in 116B/117, there was no significant correlation between these two variables.</p>

<p>Dr. Coombs gave an eloquent presentation, summarizing further data from ACTG studies, and discussing the criteria for distinguishing a valid surrogate marker. According to Dr. Coombs, no surrogate marker has ever predicted 100&#37; of the treatment effect. So the difficulty, he explained, lies in establishing how much of the treatment effect can be predicted by the surrogate marker. This effort is further complicated by the fact that surrogates do not usually measure toxicity. Consequently, if a surrogate “really” predicts, for example, 50&#37; of the treatment effect, but toxicity also reduces the treatment effect by 50%, then the surrogate will predict all of the treatment effect in that one study, making it appear much more useful as a predictive tool than it really is.</p>

<p>Finally, the committee agreed that the Roche PCR test could reliably quantify response to antiretroviral therapy. The committee also agreed, however, that Roche had not yet established the clinical significance of these viral RNA changes. If, for example, a patient had a high viral load and a high CD4+ count, no one knew what the patient should do.</p>

<p>The meeting ran late, discussion was very limited, and no formal vote was ever taken. As a consequence, many attendees left the meeting uncertain of the committees recommendations. Later calls to the FDA also suggested confusion as to the recommendation. According to Roche's press release, both the prognostic and therapeutic monitoring applications of the Amplicor test kit were recommended for approval. FDA has not yet acted on the committee's recommendation.</p>

L&iacute;der Cient&iacute;fico Anterior de ACT UP/Nueva York Revisa E Analisa el Desarrolloya del Gran Movemiento<br>
<br>
Activismo como culto religioso</b></p>

<p>Mark Harrington, miembro de TAG fue invitado a llevar el enfoque principal a una reciente conferencia en el Instituto para las Artes Contempor&aacute;neas en Londres, titulada “Acting on AIDS.” Sus comentarios, “De un Utopianismo Terap&eacute;utico a un Praxis Pragm&aacute;tico: Algunas Transiciones del Activismo de Tratamiento para el SIDA,” remarcando las llaves de desarrollo en casi 10 a&ntilde;os de activismo del SIDA.</p>

<p>Las circunstancias contribuyeron al estallido del activismo de tratamiento para el SIDA en 1987. Un numero de circunstancias hist&oacute;ricas &uacute;nicas, contribuyeron al estallido del activismo de tratamiento para el SIDA en la ciudad de Nueva York con la creaci&oacute;n de ACT UP/New York en marzo de 1987. Previo de la aparici&oacute;n del SIDA en 1981, exist&iacute;a un sentido innato de pertenencia de ciertos derechos, los hombres gay de clase media sin duda sintieron que ten&iacute;an tambi&eacute;n derecho a esto. Por cuarenta a&ntilde;os, los americanos han vivido dentro de la burbuja de los antibi&oacute;ticos, en un periodo de tiempo en el que se cre&iacute;a que las enfermedades infecciosas estaban disminuyendo y que la quimioterapia de antibi&oacute;ticos podr&iacute;a r&aacute;pidamente ser desarrollada para nuevas infecciones (como ocurri&oacute; con la enfermedad de Legionnaire en 1970).</p>

<p>Ya han pasado casi dos d&eacute;cadas de movilizaci&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica de gais y lesbianas, usando el modelo de los derechos humanos, y muchos activistas gay y lesbiana con experiencia pudieron uniese a un nuevo movimiento enfocado en el SIDA. Han sido seis a&ntilde;os de revolucionario activismo del SIDA, incluyendo la formaci&oacute;n y crecimiento de agencias proveedoras de servicios como lo es Gay Men’s Health Crisis (GMHC) en 1981, la invenci&oacute;n y diseminaci&oacute;n de practicas para un sexo m&aacute;s seguro, el establecimiento de Las Personas con SIDA (PWA, siglas en ingl&eacute;s) un movimiento de auto-desarrollo.</p>

<p>La presentaci&oacute;n del examen que detecta anticuerpos del VIH en 1985, el cual se empieza a usar en todas partes para determinar sus estados sero, sin saber todav&iacute;a cuantas personas positivas a los anticuerpos progresaban hasta SIDA, creando una poblaci&oacute;n de miles de individuos ansiosos pero todav&iacute;a saludables que podr&iacute;an movilizares alrededor del SIDA si existiera alguna raz&oacute;n para hacerlo.</p>

<p>La ciudad de Nueva York fue el epicentro de la epidemia del SIDA en los Estados Unidos, y para el a&ntilde;o 1987 m&aacute;s de 7,000 casos de SIDA hab&iacute;an sido reportados; la mitad hab&iacute;an muerto; y entre 200.000 y 400.000 se cre&iacute;an estar infectados con el VIH. El r&aacute;pido desarrollo y la aprobaci&oacute;n del FDA del AZT en marzo de 1987 creo un nuevo ambiente de esperanza sobre la posibilidad de tratar al SIDA, combinado con la atrocidad de precio del AZT de $10.000 al a&ntilde;o. Esperanza y atrocidad hacen una combinaci&oacute;n peligrosa. Finalmente, Larry Kramer no estaba escribiendo ninguna obra en ese momento.</p>

<p>En marzo de 1987, exactamente para el momento que AZT fue aprobada, Larry Kramer dio un discurso en el Centro de las Lesbianas y Gais en Nueva York el cual dirigi&oacute; a la formaci&oacute;n de ACT UP, Larry dijo. “Poder significa la disponibilidad de aceptar responsabilidades” y nuestra definici&oacute;n de acci&oacute;n directa fue experimental e improvisada. Inicialmente tratamos una gama de t&aacute;cticas ca&oacute;ticas, sin ninguna estrategia global. Entre los elementos y blancos en el comienzo del activismo de ACT UP estaban los zaps (demostraciones cortas sean por tel&eacute;fono, correo, fax, etc.) y las demostraciones sobre la visibilidad homosexual, discriminaci&oacute;n del SIDA, compa&ntilde;&iacute;as farmac&eacute;uticas, la media y otras organizaciones del SIDA. El lema de Larry, “Drogas dentro del Cuerpo” era usado frecuentemente, pero exist&iacute;a muy poca organizaci&oacute;n de activismo directo dirigido a alcanzar esa meta. </p>

<p>ACT UP se reg&oacute; como fuego sin control por todos los Estados Unidos. Esto llevo a las personas a una agitaci&oacute;n cultural y pol&iacute;tica ya existente, con un nuevo sentido de comunidad, poder colectivo y de gozo. Esto iba mano a mano a una gran intolerancia por parte de figuras p&uacute;blicas, incluyendo otras organizaciones del SIDA. ACT UP era como un movimiento religioso de la siguiente forma, Larry Kramer era nuestro profeta, las personas con SIDA eran santos y predicadores mientras estaban vivos (Michael Callen, Vito Russo, Ray Navarro) y m&aacute;rtires despu&eacute;s de muertos. Tuvimos experiencias de conversi&oacute;n (al ingresar a ACT UP, al ir a entrenamientos de desobediencia civil) y se pod&iacute;a alcanzar liberaci&oacute;n espiritual al uniese a la comunidad, ACT UP, el cual se ve&iacute;a asimismo como el elegido. El protestar y el ser arrestado eran como ritos de iniciaci&oacute;n (el bautismo).</p>

<p>Ten&iacute;amos congregaciones separadas (grupos de afinidad) las cuales compet&iacute;an para lograr la protesta m&aacute;s radical. Ten&iacute;amos una iconograf&iacute;a (“Silencio = Muerte,” “La Crisis Del SIDA No Se Ha Terminado,” “Lee Mis Labios, “ “El Gobierno Tiene Sangre En Sus Manos”). Present&aacute;bamos como demonios a nuestros enemigos (Ronald Reagan, Ed Koch, Stephen Joseph, Anthony Fauci, Ellen Cooper). Hasta nuestros enemigos pod&iacute;an ser redimidos si se “convert&iacute;an”; Ellen Cooper se volvi&oacute; de “Ice Maiden“ (Mujer de Hielo) a “Juana de Arco,” acorde con Larry Kramer, el cual tambi&eacute;n elevo a Anthony Fauci de “acecino” a “h&eacute;roe.” Los pol&iacute;ticos, al igual que los cient&iacute;ficos, nunca fueron redimidos. Mir&aacute;bamos a otras organizaciones del SIDA con sospecha y algunas veces con denuncias.</p>

<p>La congregaci&oacute;n de los elegidos se reun&iacute;a cada lunes por la noche en el Centro de las Lesbianas y Gais y luego en Cooper Union. Le&iacute;amos nuestro credo al comienzo de cada reuni&oacute;n: “ACT UP es una coalici&oacute;n diversa de individuos no partidistas, unidos por el enojo y comprometidos a una acci&oacute;n directa para terminar la crisis del SIDA...” y ten&iacute;amos nuestro canto de “Amen”, el cual era “ACT UP, Fight Back! Fight AIDS!” Ten&iacute;amos nuestra comuni&oacute;n, que era “Medicamentos en el Cuerpo.” Ten&iacute;amos nuestras esperanzas mesi&aacute;nicas: la cura era posible, estaba solo a la vuelta de la esquina, tenemos que trabajar incesantemente para lograr que esto venga r&aacute;pidamente. As&iacute; dijo Larry Kramer cuando nos exhort&oacute; en la primavera de 1990, “Tenemos que hacer que el ma&ntilde;ana pase hoy.” Al final de los a&ntilde;os 80, estabamos agarrados de un utopianismo terap&eacute;utico en el cual no se sent&iacute;a como ingenuidad el creer que la cura estaba a la vuelta de la esquina. Juntos, lo podemos lograr. Era como un tipo de profec&iacute;a.</p>

<p>Al mismo tiempo algunos de nosotros empezamos a enfocarnos en desarrollar un foco a largo plazo, focos estrat&eacute;gicos en la investigaci&oacute;n de tratamientos, desarrollando una forma &uacute;nica de acci&oacute;n directa, activismo de tratamiento, esto cambi&oacute; inevitablemente el trabajo que hizo ACT UP, pero al principio no se notaba, porque todav&iacute;a estabamos fuera del mundo de la investigaci&oacute;n. M&aacute;s adelante, despu&eacute;s que entramos al mundo de la investigaci&oacute;n y comenzamos a tener responsabilidades con ellos, llegaron los conflictos sobre si el activismo de tratamiento era una forma legitima de acci&oacute;n directa. </p>

<p>En 1988-89 se form&oacute; el Comit&eacute; de Tratamiento e Informaci&oacute;n (CTI) de ACT-UP. Comenz&oacute; con un n&uacute;meros de protestas exigiendo acceso medicamentos, inicialmente  en contra de compa&ntilde;&iacute;as farmac&eacute;uticas individuales y luego en contra del mismo FDA y del Instituto Nacional de Salud. Despu&eacute;s de 1990, el &eacute;xito de las t&aacute;cticas del CTI y su compromiso de verlas completadas cre&oacute; una preocupaci&oacute;n ideol&oacute;gica y t&aacute;cticas dentro de ACT UP. Hemos ganados m&aacute;s poder dentro de las investigaciones que cualquier otro grupo dentro de ACT UP ha ganado en otras &aacute;reas, ¿entonces, donde estaba la cura? La estrategia adentro/afuera (demostraciones seguidas por reuniones) comenzaron a ser cuestionadas.</p>

<p>Las protestas y los zaps en contra las compa&ntilde;&iacute;as de medicamentos perdi&oacute; su efectividad, tanto la media como la industria se aburrieron de ellas—esto se esperaba. Algunos activistas sintieron que el foco del CTI en investigaci&oacute;n de tratamientos distra&iacute;a la lucha en contra del racismo, sexismo, homofobia, capitalismo y el orden del Nuevo Mundo. Una implacable marea de muertes se llevo algunos de los mas amados del movimiento, l&iacute;deres y miembros carism&aacute;ticos e inspiradores, El SIDA claramente no era todav&iacute;a “una enfermedad cr&oacute;nica manejable” lo pensamos, por 5 minutos en 1989, que iba a llegar r&aacute;pidamente.</p>

<p>Algunos bandos en ACT UP quer&iacute;an separarse de las reuniones de investigaci&oacute;n y no quer&iacute;an trabajar con otros activistas y grupos de la comunidad. Ellos interrumpieron conferencias para protestar a dos estudios cl&iacute;nicos, ACTG 076 y ACTG 175, en vez de proponer mejoras para esos ensayos, quer&iacute;an “/Parar 076!” y “/Parar 175!” Si hubiesen tenido &eacute;xito, dos de los descubrimientos mas dram&aacute;ticos de los 90 nunca hubiese ocurrido. Activista pueden impedir la investigaci&oacute;n como tambi&eacute;n pueden mejorarla. Hacia el a&ntilde;o 1991, parec&iacute;a que estuvi&eacute;ramos gastando mas tiempo peleando en contra de otros miembros de ACT UP que peleando en contra del SIDA. En enero de 1992, el coraz&oacute;n del CTI se fue de ACT UP para formar TAG (Treatment Action Group), de esta manera pudimos enfocar todas nuestras energ&iacute;as en el activismo de tratamiento.</p>

<p>Hace pocas semanas, llame a Larry Kramer par una conversaci&oacute;n de paz. No hemos hablados por varios a&ntilde;os. Le pregunte como estaba su novio, y como estaba su perro, como andan sus c&eacute;lulas T. Comenzamos hablando sobre si fuimos o no un punto de cambio en la epidemia, y si fue as&iacute; que hacer. “Pero ¿d&oacute;nde est&aacute;n los soldados?” suspir&oacute; Larry. Pens&eacute; sobre eso. ¿Son los activistas realmente como soldados, donde todo lo que tienes que hacer es apuntarlos a una direcci&oacute;n y decir “vayan”? A pesar que fueran as&iacute;, ¿a d&oacute;nde le dir&iacute;amos que vayan, y a hacer que?</p>

<p>Los activistas no son como soldados. Son un grupo de personas seleccionadas por ellos mismo los cuales sienten un llamado a hacer algo para intervenir. El activismo de tratamiento del SIDA es diferente a otros movimientos para cambios sociales porque nuestros aliados son tanto biol&oacute;gicas como social, pol&iacute;tica, econ&oacute;mica y cultural. Los activistas deben de ser flexibles t&aacute;cticamente pero ser tercos estrat&eacute;gicamente. Los activistas necesitan aliados entre los cient&iacute;ficos, la prensa y en el gobierno para poder prevalecer. Y los activistas, como los soldados, tienen que “escuchar la informaci&oacute;n” y cambiar el curso cuando nuevos encuentros lo hagan necesario.</p>

<p>La formaci&oacute;n de los activistas tiene que cambiar junto con los cient&iacute;ficos; ahora existe necesidad de una nueva formaci&oacute;n. Los activistas de tratamiento no deben esperar m&aacute;s de los cient&iacute;ficos que de lo que ellos pueden dar. La ciencia no es magia.  A pesar de que no estamos en el comienzo para el fin del SIDA, por lo menos estaremos acercandonos al final del comienzo.</p>

<p><b><a name="drama">Deconstructing</a> the Drama<br>
Former ACT UP/NY Scientific Wunderkind  Denounces Movement As “Messianic Utopianism”<br>
<br>
AIDS activism as religious cult</b></p>

<p>At a recent conference entitled “Acting on AIDS” at the Institute for Contemporary Art in London, TAG’s Mark Harrington was invited to deliver the keynote address. His remarks, “From Therapeutic Utopianism to Pragmatic Praxis: Some Transitions in the History of AIDS Treatment Activism,” highlighted key developments in nearly 10 years of AIDS activism and are excerpted below.</p>

<p>A number of unique historical circumstances contributed to the outbreak of AIDS treatment activism in New York City with the foundation of ACT UP/New York in March 1987. Prior to the emergence of AIDS in 1981, there was an innate sense of entitlement to certain rights; middleclass gay men certainly felt entitled to these as well. For forty years, Americans had lived inside the antibiotic bubble, a period of time in which it was believed that infectious diseases were on the wane and that antibiotic chemotherapy could quickly be developed for new and emerging infections (as occurred with Legionnaire’s disease in the 1970s). There had been nearly two decades of gay and lesbian political mobilization, using the civil rights model, and many experienced gay and lesbian activists were able to join a new movement focusing on AIDS. There had been six years of ground-breaking AIDS activism, including the foundation and growth of service-providing agencies such as Gay Men’s Health Crisis (GMHC) in 1981, the invention and dissemination of safer sex practices, the establishment of the people with AIDS (PWA) self-empowerment movement. The introduction of the HIV antibody test in 1985, and its widespread use by people to determine their serostatus, without yet knowing now many antibody-positive persons progressed to AIDS, created a population of thousands of anxious but still healthy individuals who might be able to mobilize around AIDS if there were any reason to do so.</p>

<p>New York City was the epicenter of the AIDS epidemic in the United States, and by 1987 over 7,000 cases of AIDS had been reported; half had died; and between 200,000 and 400,000 were believed to be HIV-infected. The rapid development and FDA approval of AZT in March 1987 created a new climate of hope about the prospects for treating AIDS, combined with outrage over AZT’s $10,000 a year price. Hope and outrage made for an inflammatory combination. Finally, Larry Kramer was between plays.</p>

<p>In March 1987, just around the time AZT was licensed, Larry Kramer gave a speech at the Lesbian and Gay Community Center in New York which led to the formation of ACT UP. Larry said, “Power means the willingness to accept responsibility,” and those words had a major impact on our initial activism. ACT UP was devoted to “direct action to end the AIDS crisis” and our definition of direct action was an experimental, improvisatory one. Initially we tried a range of scattershot tactics, without any overall strategy. Among the elements and targets of ACT UP’s initial activism were “zaps” and demonstrations about gay visibility, AIDS discrimination, drug companies, political leaders, the media and other AIDS organizations. Larry’s motto, “drugs into bodies,” was often chanted, but there was little organized activism directed towards achieving that goal.</p>

<p>ACT UPs spread like wildfire around the United States. They drew people into an exciting cultural and political ferment, with a new sense of community, collective power and joy. This went hand-in-hand with a good deal of intolerance to outside figures, including other AIDS organizations. ACT UP was like a religious movement in the following numerous ways. Our prophet was Larry Kramer. People with AIDS were saints and preachers while alive (Michael Callen, Vito Russo, Ray Navarro) and martyrs after they died. We had conversion experiences (joining ACT UP, going to civil disobedience training) and could achieve spiritual liberation by joining the community, ACT UP, which viewed itself as the “elect.” Demonstrating and getting arrested were like initiation rites (baptism). We had separate congregations (affinity groups) which competed to carry out the most radical demonstrations. We had iconography (“Silence=Death,” “The AIDS Crisis Is Not Over,” “Read My Lips,” “The Government Has Blood on Its Hands”), and we demonized our enemies (Ronald Reagan, Ed Koch, Stephen Joseph, Anthony Fauci, Ellen Cooper). Even our enemies could be redeemed if they “converted”; Ellen Cooper went from being an “Ice Maiden” to “Joan of Arc,” according to Larry Kramer, who also elevated Anthony Fauci from “murderer” to “hero.” Politicians, unlike scientists, were irredeemable. We regarded other AIDS organizations with suspicion and sometimes denunciation. The congregation of the “elect” met each Monday night at the Center and later at Cooper Union. We read our credo at the start of each meeting: “ACT UP is a diverse, non-partisan coalition of individuals united in anger and committed to direct action to end the AIDS crisis...” and we had our “Amen!” chant, which was “ACT UP! Fight Back! Fight AIDS!” We had our communion, it was “drugs into bodies.” We had our messianic hopes: the cure was possible, it was just around the corner, we had to work incessantly to make it come faster. As Larry Kramer exhorted us in spring 1990, “We must make tomorrow happen today.” In the late 1980s, we were in the grip of a therapeutic utopianism in which it did not feel na&iuml;ve to believe that a cure was just around the corner. Together, we could make it appear. It was a kind of messianism.</p>

<p>At the same time, some of us were beginning to work on developing a more long-term, strategic focus on treatment research, and a unique form of direct action: treatment activism. This would inevitably change the kind of work ACT UP did, but wasn’t initially apparent, because we were still on the outside of the research world. Later, after we’d broken into that research world and began to carry responsibilities there, conflicts would arise about whether treatment activism was a legitimate form of direct action at all.</p>

<p>ACT UP’s Treatment+Data Committee was formed in 1988-89, starting out with a number of “drugs into bodies” access zaps, initially against individual drug companies and later against the FDA itself (and later still, the NIH). After 1990, T+D’s tactical successes and its commitment to seeing them through created ideological and tactical stress within ACT UP. We’d won more power within research than other groups within ACT UP had won in other areas, so where was the cure? The inside-outside strategy (demonstrations followed by meetings) began to be questioned. </p>

<p>Demonstrations and zaps against drug companies would eventually lose their effectiveness; both the media and the industry became bored by them—it was expected, a sort of “Dog Bites Man” story. Some activists felt that T+D’s focus on treatment research distract from struggles against racism, sexism, homophobia, capitalism and the New World Order. All the while, a relentless tide of death carried away some of the movement’s most beloved, charismatic and inspiring leaders and members. AIDS was clearly not yet the “chronic, manageable disease” we’d thought, for five minutes in 1989, it might rapidly become.</p>

<p>Some ACT UP factions wanted to disengage from research meetings and didn’t want to work with other community groups and activists. They interrupted conferences to protest two studies, ACTG 076 and ACTG 175. Rather than propose improvements to those trials, they wanted to “Stop 076!” and “Stop 175!” If they’d been successful, two of the most dramatic discoveries of the 1990s would never have occurred. Activists can impede research as well as improve it. By 1991, it seemed we were spending more time fighting other ACT UP members than fighting AIDS. In January 1992, the core of T+D left ACT UP to form TAG, the Treatment Action Group, so that we could focus all our energy on treatment activism.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I called Larry Kramer for a peace talk. We hadn’t spoken for several years. I asked him how his lover was, how his dog was, how his T-cells were. We started talking about whether or not we were at a turning point in the epidemic, and if so what to do. “But where are the soldiers?” sighed Larry. I thought about it. Are activists really like soldiers, where all you have to do it point them in some direction and say, “Go!”? Even if they were, where would we tell them to go, and what to do?</p>

<p>Activists aren’t like soldiers. They’re a self-selected group of people who feel a calling to do something to intervene. AIDS treatment activism is unlike other social change movements because our allies are biological as well as social, political, economic and cultural. Activists need allies among scientists, the press and in government in order to prevail. And activists, like scientists, must “listen to the data” and change course when new findings make it necessary: to be strategically stubborn but tactically flexible. Even if we are not at the beginning of the end of the AIDS pandemic, at least we may be nearing the end of the beginning. ACT UP had its time and served a valuable purpose; now there is a need for new formations. </p>

A Tale of Two Epidemics</b><br>
 In Thailand, India and sub-Saharan Africa, 90&#37; of the cases of HIV-1 infection are believed to have resulted from heterosexual exposure, while in the U.S. and Europe less than 10&#37; of HIV infections have been attributed to heterosexual contact. Nine different subtypes (“clades”) of HIV-1 have been identified, and where B is the dominant subtype in the U.S., Western Europe, the Caribbean and Latin America; C is the dominant subtype in India; E, the dominant sub-type in Thailand; and A, C and D, the dominant sub-types in Africa. While differences in the rates of HIV-1 heterosexual transmission have been attributed to differing sexual behavior practices and co-factors, none of these explanations fully accounts for the explosive heterosexual epidemics in Africa and Asia. Now, investigators publishing their work in a recent issue of Science (vol. 271: 1291-3) report that differences in HIV’s affinity for certain epithelial cells which line the mouth and genital—but not the rectal—mucosa among these HIV-1 subtypes may explain the differences between the epidemiology of these epidemics. Furthermore, the authors warn that “If introduced into the West, viruses such as HIV-1 E might pose a greater threat for heterosexual transmission than does HIV-1 B.”</p>

<p>Researchers report in <i>The Journal of Infectious Diseases</i> (1996; 173: 355-64) in vitro additivity or synergy with the antiretroviral combinations 3TC+ddI, 3TC+d4T, 3TC+NVP, d4T+ddI, d4T+NVP, 3TC+SQV, d4T+SQV (among others) when tested against AZT-sensitive isolates of HIV. Curiously though, when these same combinations were tested against HIV isolates which had developed reduced sensitivity to AZT, the combination of AZT+d4T, in particular, appeared antagonistic. This antagonism is thought to be caused by AZT’s ability to inhibit the phosphorylation of d4T. Both drugs also compete for the same cellular thymidine kinase, and AZT is preferentially phosphorylated over d4T.</p>

<p><b><a name="pcr">La</a> Revisi&oacute;n del PCR<br>
Roche Pide al Comit&eacute; de Productos de Sangre del FDA por Aprobaci&oacute;n de Su Diagnostico VIH-PCR</b></p>

<p><b>Uso prognostico</b><br>
El jueves 21 de marzo, la Administraci&oacute;n de Alimentos y Medicamentos (FDA) llevo a cabo una audiencia con el Comit&eacute; Asesor de los Productos de Sangre para discutir el mercadeo del VIH-RNA PCR estuche para la carga viral producido por la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a Hoffmann-La Roche, conocido como Amplicor HIV Monitor Kit.</p>

<p>El estuche Amplicor es un ensayo basado en el PCR como medida cuantitativa del RNA viral del VIH en el plasma. La prueba no distingue entre las part&iacute;culas v&iacute;rales infecciosas y no infecciosas. El FDA enfatiz&oacute; repetidamente que no le esta pidiendo al comit&eacute; como votar para aprobar el estuche, pero s&iacute; en lo que se puede hacer en los tipos de requerimientos. En efecto, el resultado fue suficientemente predeterminado, que la audiencia fue pautada para solo una tarde (seguido por una discusi&oacute;n sobre un nuevo estuche de prueba para la hepatitis C, y anterior a una discusi&oacute;n de la enfermedad “vaca loca”.</p>

<p>Despu&eacute;s del requerimiento del FDA, Hoffmann-La Roche seleccion&oacute;  tres tipos de requerimientos, que tal vez ser&aacute;n parte de su prueba: 1. Pronostico o estado de la enfermedad. La prueba le permitir&aacute; a los doctores a distinguir a los pacientes en los diferentes estados de la enfermedad. 2. El uso de la prueba como monitor terap&eacute;utico, esto le permitir&aacute; a los doctores monitoriar a los pacientes si tienen o no respuesta a las terapias antivirales (sin determinar si &eacute;sta respuesta es o no de beneficio). A su vez, los investigadores podr&aacute;n usar el estuche para determinar si grupos de pacientes responden a las terapias antivirales, potencialmente acelerando la revisi&oacute;n de nuevas drogas. 3. El uso de la prueba como manejo del paciente, los doctores podr&iacute;an iniciar, cambiar y parar las terapias basados en los resultados de la prueba.</p>

<p>Roche esta pidiendo permiso para hacer los dos primeros requerimientos para su estuche, pero dejando claro que no existe suficiente informaci&oacute;n para asegurar el tercer uso.</p>

<p>El estuche Amplicor mide confiadamente las part&iacute;culas del RNA viral en las escalas entre 400 y 750,000 copias/mL. Este no tiene reactividad cruzada con virus, bacteria, micobacteria y protozomas los cuales afectan com&uacute;nmente a las personas infectadas con el VIH. Este tambi&eacute;n puede confiadamente detectar diferencias de 5-disminuciones (sigla en ingl&eacute;s,“5-fold”) con 95&#37; de seguridad.</p>

<p>Para apoyar el requerimiento para el valor del pronostico, Roche someti&oacute; informaci&oacute;n de pacientes en sub-estudios de virolog&iacute;a de ACTG 116A (n=153) y ACTG 116B/117 (n=99). En ACTG 116A, teniendo como l&iacute;nea base el RNA, estaba claramente asociado con riesgo a enfermedades oportunistas o muerte (p=0.02) como tambi&eacute;n lo fue el log y el conteo de CD4 (p=0.0001). En ACTG 116B/117, no obstante, solamente el log, del conteo de CD4 y el diagnostico de SIDA como l&iacute;nea base fueron asociados con riesgo de progreso de la enfermedad. Sin embargo, una serie de informaci&oacute;n de apoyo presentada por el Dr. Robert Coombs y el Dr. Douglas Mayers convencieron al comit&eacute; de que la prueba es un pronostico.</p>

<p>Al sacar informaci&oacute;n de ACTG 229, un estudio de saquinavir, AZT &amp; ddC, Roche argument&oacute; que la prueba puede medir los cambios seguidos de la iniciaci&oacute;n de la terapia. En ACTG 229, por ejemplo, los pacientes que toman terapia de combinaci&oacute;n triple de medicamentos tienen una reducci&oacute;n del RNA de aproximadamente 0.8 log, en donde pacientes que toman AZT+ddC tienen una reducci&oacute;n solamente de 0.3 log, y pacientes que toman saquinavir+ddc tienen solo una reducci&oacute;n de 0.2 log.</p>

<p>A su vez, la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a present&oacute; informaci&oacute;n del estudio NV 14256, el cual compara la monoterapia de ddC y saquinavir con la combinaci&oacute;n de los dos tratamientos. Los pacientes que toman saquinavir tienen solo una reducci&oacute;n de 0.1 log en el RNA copias/mL, y los pacientes que toman ddC tienen aproximadamente una reducci&oacute;n de 0.3 log. Sin embargo, los pacientes que toman el r&eacute;gimen de combinaci&oacute;n tienen una reducci&oacute;n aproximada del RNA de 0.6 log. En los dos estudios existi&oacute; una fuerte correlaci&oacute;n entre los niveles del VIH RNA como medida para el estuche amplicator, y usando como medici&oacute;n la metodolog&iacute;a microcultivo cuantitativa PBMC.</p>

<p>Roche tambi&eacute;n argument&oacute; sobre informaci&oacute;n sacada de ACTG 116A la cual dise que cambios post-terapeuticos en niveles de RNA pueden predecir resultados cl&iacute;nicos, As&iacute; que en 116A, hay una correlaci&oacute;n significante entre los cambios de log y el RNA viral en la semana 8. y resultados cl&iacute;nicos (p=0.013). Sin embargo, en ACTG 116B/117, no existi&oacute; ninguna correlaci&oacute;n significante entre estas dos variables (p=0.29).</p>

<p>El Dr. Coombs dio una presentaci&oacute;n elocuente, resumiendo m&aacute;s informaci&oacute;n de los estudios de ACTG, y discuti&oacute; el criterio para la distinci&oacute;n a un marcador substituto valido. Acorde con el Dr. Coombs, ning&uacute;n substituto a precedido en un 100&#37; los efectos de tratamiento. Luego, las dificultades caen en el establecer cuanto se puede predecir del efecto de tratamiento por medio del substituto. No obstante, este esfuerzo es complicado, por el motivo de que los substitutos usualmente no miden la toxicidad. Consecuentemente, si el substituto “realmente” predice, por ejemplo, el 50&#37; del efecto de  tratamiento, sin embargo la toxicidad tambi&eacute;n reduce el efecto de tratamiento en un 50%, entonces el substituto predecir&aacute; todo el efecto de tratamiento en un solo estudio, haci&eacute;ndolo ver mucho m&aacute;s &uacute;til como herramienta predictiva que lo que realmente es.</p>

<p>Finalmente, el comit&eacute; estuvo de acuerdo con que la prueba puede medir la respuesta a las terapias, no obstante tambi&eacute;n estuvieron de acuerdo con que, en este momento, Roche no ha establecido el significado del los cambios del RNA viral. Si, por ejemplo, un paciente tiene una carga viral alta y un alto conteo de CD4, nadie sabr&iacute;a que podr&iacute;a hacer el paciente.</p>

<p>La reuni&oacute;n duro hasta tarde, la discusi&oacute;n fue bien limitada, y nunca tomaron un voto formal. Como consecuencia, muchos de los asistentes salieron de la reuni&oacute;n inseguros de las recomendaciones de los comit&eacute;s. Acorde a una nota de prensa de Roche, Tanto el requerimiento de pronostico como el de monitoreo terap&eacute;utico fueron recomendadas para aprobaci&oacute;n. El FDA todav&iacute;a no a actuado a las recomendaciones de los comit&eacute;s.</p>

<p><b><a name="notas">Notas</a> de Todas Partes<br>
El Cuento de Dos Epidemias.</b> En Tailandia, India y Sur-Sahara Africa, 90&#37; de los casos con la infecci&oacute;n del VIH-1 se cree ser resultado de contacto heterosexual, mientras que en los EE.UU. y Europa menos del 10&#37; de la infecci&oacute;n del VIH ha sido atribuida a contacto heterosexual. Han sido identificados nueve sub-tipos de VIH-1 (“caldees”), y donde B es el sub-tipo dominante en los EE.UU., Europa, el Caribe y Sur Am&eacute;rica, C es el sub-tipo dominante en India; E el sub-tipo dominante en Tailandia; y A, C y D, los sub-tipos dominantes en &Aacute;frica. Mientras que las diferencias en las proporciones de la transmisi&oacute;n heterosexual del VIH-1 han sido atribuidas para diferenciar las practicas del comportamiento sexual y los co-factores. Ninguna de estas explicaciones cuenta realmente para la explosiva epidemia heterosexual en Africa y Asia. Ahora, los cient&iacute;ficos que publicaron su trabajo en el resiente numero de revista Science  (vol. 271: 1291-3) informan que diferencias en el tropismo de la c&eacute;lulas Langerhan (esto es, la atracci&oacute;n del virus a ciertas c&eacute;lulas apifelias las cuales est&aacute;n en la boca y en los genitales—pero no en el recto—mucosa) dentro de estos sub-tipos de HIV-1 tal vez se explica la diferencias entre las epidemias. Por otra parte, el autor advirti&oacute; que “si llegan al oeste, virus como el VIH-1 E podr&iacute;a plantear una gran amenaza a la transmisi&oacute;n heterosexual que la que plantea el VIH-1 B.”</p>

<p><b>Fomentando evidencias en in vitro de la combinaci&oacute;n 3TC, d4T, NVP. </b> Investigadores informaron en el reciente numero del <i>Journal of Infectious Diseases</i>  (1996; 173; 355-64) in vitro evidencia muestran aditividad o sinerg&iacute;a con las combinaciones retrovirales 3TC+ddI, 3TC+NVP, d4T+ddI, d4T+NVP,  3TC+SQV, d4T+SQV (entre otras) cuando se prob&oacute; en contra del aislado VIH cl&iacute;nico sensitivo al AZT. Aunque curiosamente, cuando se probaron estas combinaciones en contra del VIH aislados cl&iacute;nico, el cual ha desarrollado reducci&oacute;n en la sensibilidad al AZT, cuando vemos en particular la combinaci&oacute;n del AZT+d4T parece antagonista.</p>

<li>You'll have the right to petition for the permanent residence of your spouse, children, parents, brothers and sisters.
<li>You'll have the right to enter and leave the United States, without time limits on your travel.
<li>When you become a United States citizen, your minor, lawful permanent resident children are automatically entitled to become citizens, no matter where they were born.
<li>You will be protected from deportation.
<li>You will gain access to certain jobs that are legally restricted to U.S. citizens.
<li>You can go to live in a foreign country and, depending on the country, still retain your Social Security benefits.
</ul>

<br clear left><blockquote>

<p><font size=+2 color="#ff0000">Who can apply for naturalization?</font></p>

<p>You may apply if:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have been a legal permanent resident for five years, <b>or</b>
<li>You obtained legal permanent residency through a U.S. citizen spouse, you have been a legal permanent resident for three years, and remain married to that citizen; <b>or</b>
<li>You are the legal permanent resident child of United States citizen parents; <b>or</b>
<li>You have qualifying military service.
</ul>

<p><font size=+2 color="#ff0000">In most cases, you must also:</font></p>

<ul>
<li>Be 18 years of age;
<li>Speak and understand English;
<li>Have knowledge of U.S. government and history;
<li>Have paid your taxes and not been convicted of a serious crime;
<li>Be willing to pledge to uphold the United States Constitution;
<li>Have been physically present in the United States for at least 30 months of the five years you claimed residency there.
</ul>

<p><font size=+2 color="#ff0000">How do I apply for citizenship?</font></p>

<ul>
<li>You'll need Form N-400, "Application for Naturalization" which you can get from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). 
</ul>

<p align=center>Submit this form with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A copy of your alien registration card
<li>2 color photographs
<li>2 fingerprint charts
<li>A check or money order for $90 made payble to "Immigration and Naturalization Service" or "INS"
<li>Men who were 18-26 ytears old while residing in the US must include information regarding their Selective Service registration.
</ul>

<p>Contact the <a href="mailto:cwha@aidsnyc.org">Caribbean Women's Health Association</a>, Immigrant Service Center for expert assistance in filing for your citizenship.</p>

<p>The INS will contact you with an interview date. On the day of the interview, you will be tested on your ability to speak and understand English. You will also be tested on your knowledge of United States history and government.</p>

<p>If you wish, you may take the exam on U.S. history and goverment <i>before</i> your interview. The New Citizens Exam is given by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). If you pass the ETS exam, you will not be tested during your interview, but you will still be required to speak and understand English. If you are interested in taking the ETS exam, call ETS at (800) 538-6230 or CWHA at (718) 826-2942 to register to take the citizenship exam at CWHA, test center # 238.</p>

<p><font size=+2 color="#ff0000">Are there English Language requirements for becoming a citizen?</font></p>

<p>Yes. You must speak and understand English to become a citizen of the Unties States. The only exceptions to this rule are people who are at least fifty years old and have been lawful permanent residents for twenty years or more, or fifty-five years old and lawful permanent residents for at least fifteen years.</p>

<p><font size=+2 color="#ff0000">If I legalized through the amnesty program, when can I apply for citizenship?</font></p>

If you legalized through the amnesty program, you may apply for naturalization five years after the date you applied for permanent residence (not temporary residence).</p>

<head><title>CWHA: find out what you need to know about asylum</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#ff0000" alink="#8f8fbd">

<p><a href="index.html"><img src="gifs/logo.gif" vspace=5 hspace=5 align=left></a><font size=+2 color="#000000"><b>Find out what you need to know about asylum in the United States</b></font></p>

<p align=right><font size=+1><i>If you cannot return to your native country for fear of being persecuted on account of race, nationality, religion, membership in a particular group, or political opinion, you may be eligible for asylum.</i></font></p>

<p><font size=+2 color="#000000">What is Asylum?</font></p>
<p><b>Asylum</b> is the protection given by a country to those fleeing persecution in their home country. If you are in the U.S. and cannot return to your home country for rear of being persecuted on account of your race, nationality, religion, membership in a particular group, or political opinion, you may be eligible for asylum in the U.S. If you are granted asylum, you may live and work in the U.S. as an "asylee" until you gain permanent residence status.</p>

<p><b>If you are denied asylum, you may be placed in deportation proceedings, so consider carefully your decision to apply.</b> For information on how to apply, see "<a href="#apply">How do I apply for asylum?</a>"</p>

<p><font size=+2 color="#000000"><b>How Do I Know If I Have a Strong Case for Asylum?</b></font></p>
<p>To be eligible for asylum you must present credible evidence that <b>you</b> were a victim of persecution such as assault, torture, death threats or imprisonment in your home country; or you must demonstrate that you have a "well-founded fear of future persecution."

<b>General reasons for leaving your country such as civil, political, or economic turmoil are not sufficient to qualify you for asylum.</b> Also, some factors may disqualify you for asylum, such as settling in another country before coming to the U.S., or having been involved in the persecution of others.</p>

<p><font size=+2 color="#000000"><b><a name="apply">How </a>Do I Apply for Asylum?</b></font></p>

<p>There are two ways to apply for asylum: "<b>affirmatively</b>" or "<b>defensively</b>." To apply for assylum <b>affirmatively</b> means that you are in the U.S., and choose to apply for asylum. You must file a <b>Form I-589</b> with the INS. In the application, you must: <b>explain what happened to you</b> and <b>why you cannot return to your country</b>. You should submit affidavits (sworn, written statements) and other supporting evidence. All documents must be translated to English.</p>

<p>Once the INS rceives your application, you will be asked to appear before an asylum officer for an interview. Your attorney or accredited representative may go with you to your interview. If you need an interpreter, you must bring your own since INS cannot provide one.</p>

<p>To apply <b>defensively</b> means that you are already in proceedings that require you to appear before an immigration judge at a hearing. You submit the <b>Form I-589</b> and supporting evidence to the judge. The judge will grant you a full hearing on your claims where you will be challenged by an INS attorney.</p>

<center><table border=1 width=40%><tr><td align=center><font color="#000000">You will be asked tough questions when you apply for asylum. If your answers are inconsistent with the statements on your application or with INS' information on conditions in your home country, you may be denied asylum.</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p><font size=+2 color="#000000"><b>Should I Trust Immigration Practitioners Who Advertise in Newspapers and on the Radio?</b></font></p>

<p>Just because someone advertises does not mean that he or she is a competent immigration practitioner. In fact, may unscrupulous practitioners use advertisements and empty promises to lure people into their offices.</p>

<center><table border=1 width=50%><tr><td align=center><font color="#000000"><b>Beware of agencies that claim to offier immediate employment authorization!</b> The authorization may be a fake! Or, the agency may file an application for asylum for you just to obtain <i>temporary</i> employment authorization. This will make your presence known to the INS and may result in your deportation! <b>Never apply for asylum just to get employment authorization! If you <i>don't</i> think you have a strong case for asylum, disucss alternate means of obtaining employment authorization with a non-profit immigration organization or attorney.</b></font></td></table></center>

<p><font size=+2 color="#000000"><b>Will It Be Difficult To Obtain Asylum?</b></font></p>

<p><b>Yes.</b> There are no quick and easy ways to obtain asylum status. The standard for proving that you deserve asylum is very high and the process is long. <b>Very few people are approved for asylum.</b></p>

<p>By applying for asylum, you will draw the attention of the INS and so increase your risk of being deported from the U.S. You should only apply if you believe you are eligible; and be sure that you have qualified counseling throughout the application process.</p>

<p><font size=+2 color="#000000"><b>Where Can I Go for Legal Help?</b></font></p>

<p>Seek legal counseling from a qualified practitioner such as an immigration lawyer or an accredited representatative at a qualified non-profit organization. You can also call Caribbean Women's Health ASsocation, Immigrant Service Center for help.<p>

<p>When looking for legal counseling, make sure to find out about the practitioner's credentials and experience in dealing with asylum cases.

<title>NATAP: nelfinavir update</title>

<h3>Nelfinavir: preliminary efficacy and safety data update 9/3/96</h3>

<blockquote>


<p>In Vancouver, at a satellite symposium to the Int'l. AIDS Conference in July '96, Agouron Pharmaceuticals presented updated data of their phase II trial # 510 which studies d4T in combination with nelfinavir (ViraceptTM, VCT); the new data is for a small number of study subjects and extends out to 5 months. Prior to this report, NATAP's <a href="nelf.html">most recent article</a> about nelfinavir was written in June and reported 2 month's data; it may offer a fuller perspective of the development plans for nelfinavir. In Vancouver, Agouron reported new data indicating that nelfinavir's resistance profile was different than previously reported and may be unique from those of other protease inhibitors.</p>

<p>David Ho and Martin Markowitz of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center are conducting an ongoing trial of nelfinavir in combination with AZT and 3TC in treatment-naive but chronically infected individuals; the preliminary data is available on the web-site in the article "<a href="6031.html">Antiretroviral-Naive Subjects Chronically Infected With HIV-1: Triple therapy with nelfinavir in combination with AZT and 3TC</a>."</p>

<p><b>Study #510</b><br>
HIV+ study subjects are:</p>

<ul>
<li>d4T-naive 
<li>protease inhibitor naive
<li>CD4 above 200
<li>plasma HIV RNA (viral load above 15,000 copies/ml) 
</ul>

<p>Baseline characteristics:</p>

<center><table border=1>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td><td align=center>d4T</td><td align=center>d4T+<br>500 mg VCT</td><td align=center>d4T+<br>750 mg VCT</td><td align=center>d4T+<br>1000 mg VCT</td>

</tr><p>
</table></center>
<p>As you can see, the study subjects are a relatively healthy group.</p>

<p>Thirty-six individuals were randomized to receive d4T monotherapy for 2 months (after 2 months nelfinavir was added to d4T for these individuals), or d4T in combination with nelfinavir at one of three doses--500 mg TID, 750 mg TID or 100 mg TID. Again, the following preliminary data are based upon a small number of study subjects. The larger phase III studies enrolled in the 1st QTR of '96 and are ongoing. Data from a smaller group of study subjects, as in this instance, can vary from the results of studies which include much larger numbers of participants. Therefore, the data that emerges from the phase III pre-accelerated approval studies should be more reliable. The FDA accelerated approval hearings are expected to be held in the 1st QTR of '97, where data will be presented from these larger studies. In the interim, whenever data may be made available from nelfinavir studies, NATAP will report it.</p>

<title>NATAP: 1592U89: An update of preliminary safety &amp; antiviral data</title>
</head>

<a href="../index.html"><h4 align=center>National AIDS Treatment Advocacy Project</h4></a>

<h3>1592U89: An update of preliminary safety and antiviral data</h3> 

<blockquote>


<p>1592U89 is a reverse transcriptase inhibitor developed by Glaxo Welcome. Adult study subjects were assigned to one of four dosing regimens of 1592U89 in this trial.  Four weeks of monotherapy was followed by randomization to 8 weeks of combination therapy with AZT or AZT-placebo. CD4, viral load and safety data were presented at the Human Retrovirus Conference in January of 1996, for individuals in the first dose regimen of 200 mg tid (3X/day). In Vancouver, Dr. Ramon Torres, a study investigator from St.Vincent's Hospital in New York City, updated study findings. Presented here are data for a few additional study subjects from the 200 mg tid dose regimen, and data for 2 additional dosing regimens: 300 mg bid (2X/day), 400 mg tid. The 4th dosing regimen just recently completed enrollment and data is not yet available.</p>

<p>For a more in-depth discussion of 1592, you can read <a href="1592.html">1592U89--A New Antiviral For HIV In Development</a> where it says--"Some of the pre-clincal claims by Glaxo Wellcome about this drug are:

<ol>
<li>significant CNS penetration-- crosses blood-brain barrier in rat- <li>13%, in monkey-- 26%; 
<li>in vitro synergy with AZT, 3TC, ddI, ddC-- and 2 protease inhibitors tested (141W94, saquinavir); 
<li>no cross-resistance with AZT; and
<li>more than 70% bioavailability. 
</ol>

<p>Glaxo is now planning a pediatric study and further adult studies; because of its CNS penetration, Glaxo is planning a study of the drug's effects in AIDS dementia. Large-scale phase III trials are in the planning stages, and expected to begin in 4th QTR. '96". </p>

<p><b>The Study</b></p>

<p>Estimated Median Baseline (preliminary data) CD4 cells/mm3 and HIV RNA (viral load) measured by Roche's RT-PCR assay with a lower limit of 200 copies/ml(undetectable is below 200 copies): </p>

<center><table border=1>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td><td align=center>CD4</td><td align=center>HIV RNA (viral load)</td>
</tr><p><tr>
<td>200 mg tid group</td><td>356 CD4 cells</td><td>approximately 125,000 RNA copies/ml</td>
</tr><p><tr>
<td>300 mg bid group</td><td>381 CD4 cells</td><td>31,600 RNA copies/ml</td>
</tr><p><tr>
<td>400 mg tid group</td><td>355 CD4 cells</td><td>31,600 RNA copies/ml</td>
</tr><p>
</table></center> 

<p>Estimated HIV RNA decreases from baseline(preliminary data): for individuals receiving 1592 monotherapy for 12 weeks</p>

<center><table border=1>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td><td align=center>200 mg tid<br>(n=10)</td><td align=center>300 mg bid<br>(n=10)</td><td align=center>400 mg bid<br>(n=10)</td>

<td>4 weeks</td><td>1.80 log</td><td>1.10 log</td><td>1.40 log</td>
</tr><p><tr>
<td>12 weeks</td><td>2.00 log</td><td>1.40 log</td><td>1.40 log</td>
</tr><P>
</table></center>                         

<p>For individuals who were taking 1592 monotherapy for 4 weeks, and then received combination therapy with AZT for an additional 8 weeks:</p>

<center><table border=1>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td><td align=center>200 mg tid<br>(n=9)</td><td align=center>300 mg bid<br>(n=10)</td><td align=center>400 mg bid<br>(n=10)</td>

<td>4 weeks</td><td>1.70 log</td><td>1.60 log</td><td>2.20 log</td>
</tr><p><tr>
<td>12 weeks</td><td>1.90 log</td><td>2.30 log</td><td>2.70 log</td>
</tr><p>
</table></center>

<p>There was about a 100 CD4 increase from baseline regardless of dosing regimen or whether or not subject received 1592 monotherapy or 1592+AZT. The range of median CD4 increases in the 3 cohorts were 79-127.</p>

<p>As you can see a relatively healthy group of individuals were studied in this trial. Individuals with more prior drug experience will be studied in future trials.</p>

<p><b>Grade 3/4 lab toxicity, n=59:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>1 person with elevated liver enzymes--Alanine Aminotransferase <li>elevation. 
<li>1 case neutropenia- had grade 2 neutropenia at baseline   Adverse event profile:
<li>nausea, headache, asthenia, rash, dyspepsia, pruritus--most common side effects
</ul>

<p>4 subjects agreed to have CSF samples collected: CSF approximately concentration was 20% of plasma concentrations, which is about equal to AZT levels in CSF.</p>

<p><b>Discontinuations</b></p>

<ul>
<li>4 discontinuations due to adverse events --in the 200 mg tid <li>group, 0/10 receiving monotherapy, 2/9 taking the combination: 1 person--parasthesia, fever, rash; 2nd person--nausea.
<li>300 mg bid group, no discontinuations
<li>400 mg tid group, 0/10 on combination; 2/10 on monotherapy, 1 person  on monotherapy discontinued on day 1 due to nausea and fatigue; the other due to rash and fever. 
</ul>

<H2 align=center>Killen Discusses NIAID Strategy<BR>
Progress in HIV Vaccine Research and Development</H2> 

<P><I>(Editor's note: Jack Killen, M.D., is director of NIAID's Division of AIDS (DAIDS). AIDS Agenda recently spoke with Dr. Killen about NIAID's plans and progress in the development of HIV vaccines.)</I></P> 
<P><b>AA</b>: Are you optimistic that an effective vaccine against HIV can be developed?<P>

<P><b>JK</b>: We believe very strongly that a safe and effective vaccine can be developed. A number of observations support this optimism. First, we know that immunization is a well-established, cost-effective method of preventing other viral infections. Second, under idealized conditions, some vaccines for HIV and related retroviruses have provided protection in animal models. Third, in early human trials, a number of HIV vaccine candidates have been safe and have evoked immune responses.</P>

<P><b>AA</b>: What would the attributes of an ideal HIV vaccine be?<P>

<P><b>JK</b>: The ideal HIV vaccine would be safe and produce few side effects; produce strong immune responses against all subtypes of HIV to which an individual is likely to be exposed; provide long-lasting protection against all potential routes of infection, especially infection at the vaginal and rectal mucosa; be inexpensive to manufacture, and be easily stored and administered anywhere in the world. We feel that progress toward such a vaccine will be made in incremental steps, through fundamental research and clinical trials of multiple vaccine approaches.<P>


<P><b>AA</b>: What if we fall short of the ideal vaccine?<P>


<P><b>JK</b>: We would of course love to hit a home run and develop a vaccine that is 100 percent effective and meets all the criteria I mentioned. However, even an imperfect vaccine will allow us to collect important data and move us closer to our ideal. In addition, biostatistical models tell us that even a partially effective vaccine would have a powerful effect on the epidemic, especially in high-risk populations. There, behavioral interventions such as education and counseling are unlikely to effectively contain the epidemic.<P>


<P><b>AA</b>: What is the NIAID strategy for HIV vaccine development?<P>


<P><b>JK</b>: Broadly, our strategy consists of a simultaneous, two-component approach to HIV vaccine discovery and development: fundamental research and empiric vaccinology.<P>


<P>With the fundamental research component, we are furthering our understanding of both HIV and the immune system. We support research that addresses very basic questions of HIV virology, immunology and pathogenesis. In addition, NIAID-supported scientists are conducting applied, obstacle-oriented research on the correlates of HIV protection, HIV diversity, the development of animal models, vaccine adjuvants, mucosal immunity and behavior. The ultimate goal of this process is the generation of fundamental knowledge that will contribute to the identification of promising vaccine designs.<P>

<P> The two critical objectives of the empiric vaccinology component are: one, to rapidly develop and determine the utility of promising vaccine designs through animal model and human studies; and two, to advance the agenda of the fundamental research component by gathering data to help answer questions in the areas I just mentioned.<P>

<P><b>AA</b>: What is the role of private industry in this process?</P>
<P><b>JK</b>: Private industry has the products -- the prototype vaccines -- that are needed for clinical research. For each vaccine design, the Institute works in collaboration and partnership with industry, attempting to advance both public and private sector goals. Development plans are being negotiated with companies, outlining the programs of clinical and laboratory research that we will jointly undertake. These plans contain specific, prospectively defined milestones and decision-making criteria.</P>
<P>We encourage private sector involvement in HIV vaccine development by specifically recognizing and placing value upon industry's need for precise planning. This ensures the most rapid progress toward their goal of licensure. Activities directed specifically toward licensure will ideally be carried out with substantial private sector support. NIH resources will be directed at more fundamental research and the early testing of new approaches to vaccination and to determine if they should be evaluated in larger-scale trials.<P>

<P><b>AA</b>: What is the biggest scientific obstacle you face in developing an HIV vaccine?<P>

<P><b>JK</b>: First and foremost is the fact that the correlates of immunity -- the specific immune responses that might protect an individual from HIV -- have thus far proven elusive. The Institute funds a great deal of research attempting to elucidate this issue. For example, researchers are comparing the immune responses of HIV-infected people who show no decline in immunity for many years with those of people who have a moderate or rapid disease course. We are also closely studying vaccine trial participants who become infected with HIV, and comparing them with vaccinees who remain uninfected even after high-risk behavior. These studies may tell us which factors determine or affect the body' response to HIV exposure and infection, or which characteristics of HIV influence transmissibility and virulence.<P>
<P><b>AA</b>: You mentioned earlier that HIV diversity is a focus of the Institute's fundamental research effort. Why is this area so important?<P>
<P><b>JK</b>: Mutations in the HIV genome occur at a very high frequency. This results in tremendous variation of the genetic sequences coding for HIV proteins. For example, the genetic sequence of the HIV-1 envelope gene has been categorized into nine subtypes (clades), and even within each clade there is substantial variation. The concern is that a vaccine effective against a dominant strain in one community may not be effective against other strains circulating now or in the future. On a global scale this is extremely important, because the strains that predominate in other parts of the world differ from those circulating in the U.S. To further complicate matters, the relationship is unclear between this genetic variation and the antigenic structure of the virus, which actually determines the immune response.<P>
<P><b>AA</b>: What work is being done to answer these questions?<P>
<P><b>JK</b>: We have an initiative called the NIAID HIV Variation Project, which encompasses a number of studies conducted in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO). In this project, scientists are studying the rate and magnitude of genetic variation and the immunologic significance of this variation. Investigators involved in the variation project use state-of-the-art techniques to compile and analyze genetic and immunologic characteristics of different HIV strains contributed by laboratories from around the world.<P>
<P><b>AA</b>: So far, how many HIV vaccines have been studied in clinical trials? What kind of vaccines have they been?<P>
<P><b>JK</b>: More than 20 candidate HIV vaccines have been studied in clinical trials worldwide to determine their safety and ability to stimulate immune responses. Most of these experimental HIV vaccines have consisted of recombinant viral proteins, and are based on the envelope glycoprotein precursor, gp160, or on the glycoprotein gp120.<P>
<P><b>AA</b>: What results have been seen with these vaccines?<P>
<P><b>JK</b>: All the vaccine candidates tested so far have been well-tolerated, producing only mild side effects, typical of other vaccines for other diseases. A few of them have, fairly consistently, stimulated the production of antibodies that block HIV from infecting cells in laboratory assays that use strains of the virus that are closely related to the strain from which the vaccine is derived. Furthermore, although antibody levels decreased within months, HIV-specific immunologic memory cells have remained for a year or longer.<P>
<P><b>AA</b>: Have these vaccine-induced immune responses been effective against other strains of HIV?<P>
<P><b>JK</b>: Unfortunately, none of the vaccines tested to date has stimulated antibodies that neutralize so-called field isolates, obtained directly from infected individuals. This finding was quite unexpected, and its significance remains controversial, particularly because two of the experimental vaccines have apparently protected several chimpanzees from challenge with laboratory isolates. Advocates for recombinant envelope vaccines place a great deal of emphasis on these results. Others, however, question the relevance of the chimpanzee model since chimpanzees become infected with HIV but do not become sick. They also point out that recombinant envelope vaccines have failed in the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) model. These unresolved issues were central to the decision last year not to proceed with large-scale efficacy trials of recombinant envelope vaccines at this time.<P>
<P><b>AA</b>: When will a phase III HIV vaccine trial be undertaken?<P>
<P><b>JK</b>: The decision to proceed with a large-scale, phase III efficacy trial will be based, first and foremost, on a solid scientific case in accordance with the development plans and criteria that we work out with our industrial partners. Of course, trial feasibility and community readiness are also key factors. Our HIV Vaccine Efficacy Trials Network (HIVNET) is carrying out an extensive program of behavioral and other obstacle-oriented research to address these latter issues. Critical to this process is the establishment of a partnership between investigators and the community of participants in the study. In many communities, we are beginning from a position of mistrust and suspicion. This only can be overcome with hard work over time, through cooperation and a shared understanding of and commitment to common goals and approaches.<P>
<P><b>AA</b>: Have volunteers in HIV vaccine trials become infected with the virus?<P>
<P><b>JK</b>: All participants in our clinical trials receive extensive and repeated counseling on behavioral risk reduction. Unfortunately, a small number of trial participants who received either placebo or one of the several vaccine regimens have continued to engage in high-risk behavior and have become infected with HIV. These individuals are being studied intensively for clues to the effects of prior immunization on the course of their disease, and their immune responses are being compared with those of uninfected participants. As yet, no consistent patterns have been identified among the 20 or so individuals who have been studied.<P>
<P><b>AA</b>: What approaches to HIV vaccines are in the pipeline?<P>
<P><b>JK</b>: A number of second generation approaches to improve upon the results seen with subunit vaccines are already in early clinical investigation. Most are designed to induce cellular as well as humoral immune responses, and fall into three major classes: Recombinant vector vaccines use live viruses that undergo limited replication in human cells and are genetically engineered to express one or more HIV proteins. Peptide vaccines are chemically synthesized portions of various HIV proteins designed to elicit focused immune responses aimed at important specific viral targets. Virus-like particle vaccines utilize small particles of varying complexity containing viral antigens; these particles are produced in genetically engineered expression systems. One, for example, contains several HIV core proteins in a particle generated in yeast cells. Another contains major portions of the viral coat and other antigens, and is known as a pseudovirion.<P>
<P><b>AA</b>: What do you see in the future of HIV vaccinology?<P>
<P><b>JK</b>: First, continuing advances in our understanding of the basic biology of HIV disease will illuminate the complex problem of designing a safe and effective vaccine. Second, research and development will continue on a large number of approaches to immunization currently in early stages of preclinical development. These include live-attenuated and whole-killed virus, viral vectors other than poxviruses, bacterial vectors, other virus-like particles and naked nucleic acid. Third, we must move toward even greater international collaboration to help ensure that progress is as rapid as possible.</P>

<p><b><a name="conflict">Conflict</a> Resolution: Mediation -- What Is It? Why
Does It Work?</b><br> <i>By Allen J. Zerkin, J.D.</i></p>

<p>Last month's <a href="9607.html#edit">Consumer News editorial</a> speaks of
disputes that arise between PWAs and the agencies that serve them. It correctly,
in my view, observes that "settling disputes quickly strengthens trust between
clients and agencies" and notes "the pressing need for agencies to initiate and
implement conflict resolution mechanisms" that "empower the client and restore
confidence in the agency" and would replace "antiquated grievance
mechanisms."</p>

<p>The purpose of this article is to clarify the differences among the variety of
so-called "alternative dispute resolution" procedures, and to explain the "why's"
and "how's" of the most relevant of those procedures, mediation, in greater
detail. Mediation has proved itself a very useful approach to solving problems,
but unfortunately, it is underutilized, in part because many people don't know
what it is or have never used it (and, at some level, may be afraid to try it
out), and in part because people believe that they don't need help. "Alternative
dispute resolution," or ADR, refers to a broad range of procedures. The term is
somewhat unfortunate because the procedures are "alternative," only insofar as
they are not part of the judicial process, and include one procedure that
arguably has more in common with judicial process than it does with the other
"ADR" procedures. In order to break this conceptual linkage and develop
self-standing recognition for what the procedures have to offer, one increasingly
sees references to"dispute resolution" or "conflict resolution" procedures
instead.</p>

<p>One way to think of the range of procedures is as a spectrum ranging from the
process least controlled by parties, arbitration, to the one most controlled by
parties, negotiation. Arbitration, though different from judicial process in that
it is informal, not bound by the rules of evidence, typically quicker and
cheaper, and more definitive because there are much more limited rights to
appeal, is essentially the same as judicial process in that someone, in this case
the arbitrator, renders a decision for the parties. The decision can be binding
or non-binding, as agreed upon by the parties ahead of time. Though certainly an
"alternative" -- indeed, arbitration is the alternative to judicial process that
gave ADR its name -- it has little to do with the other procedures, all of which
are intended, in a variety of ways, to get the parties to come to an agreement of
their own making and choosing, through negotiation. Negotiation represents the
opposite end of the spectrum from arbitration, though it is not itself an ADR
process. In between are a range of procedures designed to assist parties reach
agreement, and these are what dispute resolution is really all about.</p>

<p>Some of the procedures are on the arbitration side of the continuum, in that
they use an expert to render an opinion of some kind -- as a fact-finder, for
example; or to hear the parties' legal cases and render an advisory opinion, to
the principals in the dispute, first, as to the strength and weaknesses of their
respective legal cases and, second, as to what a judge might decide if the case
went to court, which usually leaves the parties more in doubt about the outcome
than they were before and therefore more willing to settle. Facilitation is one
of the procedures on the negotiation side of the continuum. Facilitators are
process guides and managers, who, by helping people keep their discussions
organized, focused, fair and productive, assist them reach their desired
conclusion, whether it be having an exchange of opinions, developing a set of
possibilities or reaching a definitive consensus decision. </p>

<p>In the middle of the continuum is mediation, the most commonly used and
quintessential dispute resolution process. Most simply put, mediation is assisted
negotiation. A mediator is an impartial person (or team) who works with the
parties, mostly together and sometimes separately, to help them reach an
agreement. </p>

<p>The cornerstones of mediation are impartiality and the confidentiality of both
all-party and private conversations. The mediator is, first and foremost, like a
referee, helping the parties establish, and then enforcing, groundrules pursuant
to which their discussion will proceed. This is critical, because without
groundrules, as will be discussed further below, there are almost inevitably
breakdowns that prevent civil and constructive dialogue from taking place.</p>

<p>The mediator's second role is as a facilitator, helping the parties organize
the issues, determine the facts, understand each other's needs, take some risks
in sharing information, think more flexibly and creatively about possible
solutions and in all ways keeping the process moving forward. Mediators perform
other critical roles as well, best understood in terms of how they solve problems
that are inherent in the process of negotiation and that often result in
breakdown and failure if negotiators are left to their own devices.</p>

<p>Theoretically, if disputants were skilled negotiators and perfect human
beings, they would never need the assistance of a mediator. The reality, however,
is that very few of us are, and therefore we do. Experiments specifically
designed to observe negotiation behavior have documented the pitfalls most of us
are generally unable to avoid. These common pitfalls -- what we might call the
barriers to the negotiated resolution of conflict -- are the reason why mediation
is not only useful, but often imperative, and why it needs to be
institutionalized in ways that get people to use it. The first set of barriers
prevents people from getting to the negotiating table in the first place.
Conflict can be resolved on three bases: power, rights and interests.
Experimental data and general experience show that people tend to badly
overestimate the likelihood that they can prevail in a fight, which would, based
on either power (fought out, say, in the political arena or in the media) or on
rights (fought out in a court or equivalent formal hearing process) and they
therefore see no need to negotiate. If they believe that they are right about the
issue, and people usually do, they tend to assume that most other people will see
things the same way they do and will agree with them. They tend to believe that
if they make threats, the other side will capitulate, tending to forget that the
way people typically react to threats is not to capitulate but, because their
egos are now involved, to respond in kind, generating a mutually damaging cycle
of escalating conflict. Experiments show that people also display a strong
tendency to be willing to make irrational gambles on long-range all-or-nothing
strategies rather than "bite the bullet" in the short term and sustain a partial
"loss" as part of a negotiated compromise.</p>

<p>As a consequence of these phenomena, people tend either to fight over rights
or try to use power rather than talk. This can happen before negotiations start
or as strategies during the course of them. Assuming negotiations have begun, the
mediator can provide a much-needed reality check to prevent miscalculations and
to force a consideration of what is likely to happen if negotiations break down.
Before negotiations have begun, the problem is even more serious, because the
barriers prevent them from ever starting. Without institutionalization of a
dispute resolution system that encourages, or even requires, disputants to see a
mediator early, negotiations often don't begin until the parties have expended so
much time, effort and resources, only to find themselves deadlocked, that they
finally come to their senses. Another barrier is that because of habit,
tradition, bias and prejudice, error or misperception, people often see conflicts
when there really aren't any. Unfortunately, it is often very difficult for the
other party, whose arguments are presumed to be self-serving, to convince them of
their error or to assist them in seeing that a new way of doing something would
be just as good. An impartial third-party mediator, with no stake in the outcome,
can be very helpful in getting the matter cleared up.</p>

<p>A related and extremely common barrier occurs when people consider the dispute
to be a win/lose matter, both defining what they want in terms that make it
appear to be available only at the other side's expense. This is almost
invariably a misperception, because in most situations, people prematurely jump
to conclusions about how their goals must be achieved or how to avoid what they
are afraid of or concerned about, and then they consider these preconceived
solutions to be the same as their needs, when, really, they are only means to
those ends.</p>

<p>A better understanding of what the parties are concerned about or need -- what
we call their "interests" -- as opposed to what they think they need, which tends
to be expressed as "positions," allows them to find perfectly good solutions. The
problem is that people tend to get stuck in their preconceptions, and simply end
up arguing back and forth, for their positions and against others', and never
uncover the underlying interests. Mediators can be very helpful with this. </p>

<p>A classic example of this occurred following the Six Day War of 1967 in the
Middle East concerning control of the Sinai, which Israel had occupied. During
the peace negotiations in 1978, this was the major point of contention, neither
Israel nor Egypt being willing to relinquish, respectively, control or the right
to control it. Defined this way, it was insoluble. When their underlying
interests were discussed -- for Israel, security, for Egypt, sovereignty -- the
solution became evident: The land is Egypt's, but it may not have a military
presence there. The solution is obvious in retrospect, but the example serves to
reveal how powerful these barriers to negotiated resolution of conflict are, even
in the realm of international diplomacy, where negotiations are being conducted
by extremely sophisticated individuals. </p>

<p>Sometimes, of course, situations are not that simple (though you might be
surprised by how often they are!), and parties' interests and concerns are really
in conflict. Here, too, there are ways to generate solutions that the parties can
live with -- by taking advantage of the parties' different priorities and trading
across issues, or by basing the agreement on the parties' differing willingness
to take risk or on the parties' differing expectations and projections about the
future -- but it often takes an experienced mediator to help the parties get
beyond the strong tendency to address issues separately and sequentially, which
increases the level of acrimony and sense that they are diametrically opposed on
everything, so that they can see these possibilities. </p>

<p>The very nature of the negotiation process also produces barriers. People are
naturally reluctant to make concessions, which reveal what they are willing to
accept, without knowing that there will be reciprocity, so progress is either
very slow or even nonexistent as each waits for the other to make the first move.
Mediators can solve this problem because they can usually get the parties to tell
them confidentially what they could accept, and the mediator can then, without
breaching any confidences, float proposals privately with each party. This
protects each party from the risk of being exploited. The mediator also insures
that another barrier related to the making of concessions can be overcome. Even
when a party does make an concessionary offer, the other side, being suspicious
and mistrusting, frequently doesn't see it for what it is and dismisses or even
belittles it. The party that made the concession is likely to be incensed, and
the process will deteriorate. At the very least, an opportunity is lost. The
presence of the mediator insures that such misinterpretations are rectified.</p>

<p>Another barrier arises because of people's tendency to personalize disputes.
Someone with different opinions or interests comes to be denigrated and
disrespected, and may even come to be viewed as an enemy. Communication breaks
down, provocative words and deeds ensue (though the speaker/actor may not see
themselves as being provocative), each of which prompts a reaction that is viewed
as the next provocation, and the conflict becomes an escalating cycle. This is
especially likely where the parties have a history and already dislike, resent or
mistrust each other.</p>

<p>Sometimes the personalization occurs as a function of people having different
ways of processing information and reaching decisions (e.g. carefully thinking
things through for oneself versus working things out in collaboration with others
or going with intuition or "gut feel," and their respective styles cause each
other great frustration), or as a function of misunderstandings arising from
cultural differences.</p>

<p>In all of the foregoing situations, a mediator is almost essential for the
process of building a better working relationship, mutual understanding and,
eventually, trust.</p>

<p>These are but some of the very predictable barriers to the negotiated
resolution of disputes. Mediators are able to overcome or prevent them by virtue
of both the nature of their role and their skills. Developing dispute resolution
systems that encourage or mandate mediation and make it easily available can
insure that it is more widely utilized.</p>

<p>Mediation has proved useful in addressing disputes that arise between citizens
and agencies. There is every reason to think that the relationship between PWAs
and the agencies, public and private, that serve them, are a fertile ground for
mediation and the establishment of systems to support its use.</p>

<p><b><a name="open">U.S</a>. Open Preview</b><br> <i>By Bob Greene</i></p>

<p>When the world's top tennis players make their annual pilgrimage to New York
later this month, it is only appropriate that it will be Arthur Ashe who will
kick off the two-week extravaganza. </p>

<p>It was, after all, Ashe who captured the final U.S. National Championships in
1968, the final amateur-only tournament that began in 1881 when Richard D. Sears
won the first of his seven consecutive titles. And it was Ashe who won the
inaugural U.S. Open in 1968, becoming the only amateur to win a major event in
which professional players competed. </p>

<p>While top-ranked Pete Sampras and Olympic gold medalist Andre Agassi are
favored to win this year's men's singles title on the hardcourts of the National
Tennis Center, activities at the year's final Grand Slam tournament will honor
the memory of Ashe for the fourth consecutive year. </p>

<p>Arthur Ashe Kids' Day will be held at the Flushing Meadows-Corona Park site
Aug. 25 as the featured preliminary event for the 1996 U.S. Open. All children
age 12 and younger will be admitted free. </p>

<p>"Arthur Ashe was one of the leading advocates of using tennis as a means of
educating kids and helping them grow physically and emotionally,'' noted Lester
M. Snyder Jr., president and chairman of the board of the United States Tennis
Association (USTA). "Arthur Ashe Kids' Day is a tribute to that lasting ideal.''
</p>

<p>Arthur Ashe was unique in a lot of ways. Not only did he capture the U.S.
title twice in the same year, in 1975 he pulled off one of the biggest upsets in
tennis history when he knocked off the seemingly invincible Jimmy Connors to win
Wimbledon. </p>

<p>He also took the Australian Open in 1970, giving him three of the four legs in
the Grand Slam, a feat only a few other men have accomplished. </p>

<p>His playing days effectively ended in 1979 when he suffered a heart attack and
underwent a coronary-bypass operation. Then in June 1983 he became infected with
the AIDS virus through a tainted blood transfusion following his second open
heart surgery. </p>

<p>Five years later, in September 1988, his right hand went dead. A mass was
removed from his brain and a subsequent biopsy revealed toxoplasmosis, a marker
for HIV. Although a few close friends knew, Ashe kept his condition a secret
until April 1992, when rumors forced him to go public. </p>

<p>And when he did go public, it wasn't quietly. It was at the U.S. Open in 1992
when he announced the formation of the Arthur Ashe Foundation for the Defeat of
AIDS. And that caused a strange phenomenon. </p>

<p>In an unprecedented display of unity, the international tennis community
joined to support the Ashe Foundation, including the United States Tennis
Association (USTA), the men's IBM-ATP Tour, the women's WTA Tour, the Women's
International Professional Tennis Council, the International Tennis Federation,
the Grand Slam Committee and the U.S. Pro Tennis Association (USPTA), the
teaching pros. </p>

<p>And it's not just the four Grand Slam tournaments that have participated in
the fund-raising. Tournaments around the world have aided the cause. And players
continue to wear a red ribbon during their matches. </p>

<p>Arthur died in February 1993. This summer, a statute of the tennis star was
erected in his hometown of Richmond, Va., the first African-American to be so
honored on Monument Boulevard, where the Civil War heroes of the Confederacy
stand. </p>

<p>Shortly after Ashe's death, Mac Winker, owner of the Memphis Racquet Club, and
the Kroger-St. Jude International Tournament announced a $1.25 million endowment
for the creation of the Arthur Ashe Chair for Pediatric AIDS Research at St. Jude
Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. </p>

<p>"He was bigger than the sport of tennis,'' Chris Evert said of Ashe. "He was a
giving kind of person, a leader in a silent way. He got things done his own
way.'' </p>

<p>So on Aug. 25, today's top pros will participate in Arthur Ashe Kids' Day at
the National Tennis Center. Pros from the men's and women's tours will go
head-to-head in events including "targets'' and "hot shots.'' </p>

<P>The day will also include a pro-celebrity tennis event. Entertainer Bill Cosby
will be master of ceremonies. </p>

<p>"The USTA has been a great partner for the past four years, helping to raise
awareness and resources for AIDS,'' said Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe, Arthur's widow.
"Building on that experience, I look forward to an expanding partnership with the
USTA in our continuing effort to introduce all the positive aspects of tennis to
today's youth. Kids were especially important to Arthur. With the USTA's help on
this project and the participation of celebrities and tour professionals, Arthur
Ashe Kids' Day can make a tremendous impact on kids. This can be an outstanding
forum for piquing a child's interest in tennis.''</p>

<p>Arthur Ashe Kids' Day will serve as a fund-raiser, with proceeds benefiting a
number of charities and foundations, including the Arthur Ashe Endowment for the
Defeat of AIDS at Cornell University Medical College, Safe Passage Foundation
(which Ashe started) and various other youth/tennis-related charities. </p>

<p>This day is about kids,'' Snyder said. ``We want to get them 'hooked' on
tennis. If they go on to become tennis champions, great! But it is far more
important for us to give children the opportunity to become champions in life,
and tennis can help them choose the right path.'' </p>

<p>While Sampras and Agassi have made the men's U.S. Open title an all-American
affair the past three years, this year's battle for the crown appears to be more
wide open than usual. </p>

<p>Sampras has not won a Grand Slam tournament title since last year's U.S. Open.
If he fails at Flushing Meadows, it will be the first year since 1992 that he
hasn't won at least one of the four major championships. </p>

<p>Agassi's career may have been rejuvenated by the Atlanta Olympics, where he
won the gold medal, the first American man to win the Olympic tennis title since
1924. He added the ATP Championship title, beating another American hope, Michael
Chang, in the final before being disqualified at Indianapolis when he cursed the
umpire. </p>

<p>Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands is the reigning Wimbledon champion and
Yegeny Kafelnikov of Russia captured the French Open. Both, thus, come into
America's premier tennis tournament with confidence, a key ingredient in becoming
a champion. </p>

<P>Boris Becker, who won the Australian Open in January and the U.S. Open in
1989, hasn't played since hurting his right wrist at Wimbledon. Two other former
champions -- Swedes Stefan Edberg, making his farewell tour before retiring, and
Mats Wilander -- are given no chance at all, although Edberg, at age 30, still
has the game to surprise. </p>

<P>The women's field could come down to last year's finalists: Steffi Graf and
Monica Seles, who share the world No. 1 ranking. But both have been beaten this
year, and that could make for an interesting two weeks on the distaff side. </p>

<p>Also in the hunt are Spaniards Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Conchita Martinez,
long-shot Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic and hard-hitting Lindsay Davenport,
the Olympic gold medalist, and Mary Pierce.  Keep your money on Graf and
Seles.</p>

<p><b><a name="critical">Critical</a> Mass: HIV/AIDS and Incarcerated
Populations</b><br> <i>By Margaret Burton Owens</i></p>

<p>Whether or not we are winning the war against HIV/AIDS and have in place the
health and social services necessary to wage that war is the subject of endless
academic, political and economic debate. It is clear, however, that the alarming
increases in HIV/AIDS among incarcerated populations, portends a threat to the
health of other prisoners and could undermine efforts to slow the spread of the
epidemic among disproportionately impacted populations. In the United States,
persons who are incarcerated in prisons, jails, and youth detention facilities,
have a constitutional right to health care and to the support services necessary
to assure humane living conditions. The U.S. Supreme Court, in a key decision in
1976, Estel v. Gamble, established a constitutional criterion based upon the
Eighth Amendment proscription for cruel and unusual punishment. The Court found
that, "deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of prisoners
constitutes the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain proscribed by the
Eighth Amendment of the Constitution." However, the reality for prisoners who are
sick, disabled and dying from HIV/AIDS and who lack access to appropriate health
care, is nothing short of cruel and unusual.</p>

<p>People of color have been particularly hard hit by the expanding HIV/AIDS
epidemic and they also experience high rates of incarceration. Men of color
represent 48 percent of the cumulative AIDS cases reported to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, among men in the U.S. and women of color account
for over 76 percent of the cumulative cases reported among women. Currently,
there are more than 1.5 million people incarcerated in jails, prisons and youth
detention facilities in America and over 5 million persons are in some form of
custody. In 1992, AIDS cases for people in state or federal prisons reached 362
per 100,000 compared to 18 per 100,000 for the general U.S. population. Clearly,
the future toll from HIV/AIDS in prisons will be much worse than the country is
currently experiencing and the demand for health care and other support services
will be more severe.</p>

<p><img src="../gifs/prison.gif" alt="drawing of prisoners" hspace=5 align=left>Many
states have reported high HIV infection rates in prisons. New York State reports
that between 14 to 16 percent of its 66,000 prisoners are infected with HIV
(9,250 to 10,560). AIDS educators who work in California prisons estimate that
more than 10,000 prisoners are HIV infected. Other experts suggest HIV infection
rates could be as high as 40 percent in some jurisdictions. Moreover, a study of
mortalities of prisoners with AIDS in the New York Department of Corrections
found that prisoners with AIDS live only half as long as non-incarcerated people
with AIDS.</p>

<p><font size=-2>Illustration by Richard Waring Rockwell</font></p>

<p>Despite comprising less than 25 percent of the U.S. population, one-half of
the prison population is African American and 20 percent is Latino-Latina.
Further, approximately 70 percent of the incarcerated population has a history of
IV drug use or substance abuse, leading contributors to new HIV infections among
people of color. In response to the new "prison industrial complex," and
mandatory sentencing policies, prison populations in many states can be expected
to double over the next five years. Little doubt remains that immediate steps
must be taken to assure the public health and that of incarcerated populations in
the U.S.</p>

<p>The National Commission on AIDS reported in 1990: "By choosing mass
imprisonment as the Federal and State governments' response to the use of drugs,
we have created a defacto policy of incarcerating more individuals with HIV
infection. Under the present policy, the percentage of drug offenders in the
Federal prison system will rise by 1995 from 47 percent to 70 percent. Clearly,
we are thus concentrating the HIV disease problem in our prisons and must take
immediate action to deal with it more effectively." Indeed, we should deal with
the issue more effectively. Unfortunately, that is not presently the case.
Medical facilities within prisons are often no more than rooms staffed with
inmate nurses and other unlicensed medical personnel who administer medication
and perform minor surgery. Many infirmaries are not equipped to deliver specialty
care such as the delivery of treatment for PCP, TB, or treatment for the many
symptoms that are characteristic of opportunistic infections that AIDS patients
experience. And, tragically, only 35 percent of the prison systems and 7 percent
of the jail systems, in the U.S., offer peer-led HIV/AIDS education/prevention
programs. Astonishingly, only six systems make condoms available.</p>

<p>Incarcerated populations living with HIV/AIDS have reached critical mass and
their numbers continue to grow. Consequently, as more and more people coming into
the correctional system are affected by HIV/AIDS, the entire correctional system,
from intake to release or parole, must adjust to meet the demands of the
epidemic. Failure to do so will undermine efforts to wage the war against
HIV/AIDS in communities of color, which is where most ex-offenders return. The
threat to the public health of these communities is real. Approximately 70
percent of the nation's AIDS cases are in 9 states, which also have significant
minority populations. This population also experiences the fastest growth in new
HIV infection rates, especially among women of color. The same nine states have
high rates of inmates infected with HIV/AIDS (California, Florida, New York,
Texas, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, and New Jersey). It is
imperative that ex-offenders, who return to the their communities, have the
education and prevention information necessary to reduce the risk of spreading
HIV.</p>

<p>Efforts to educate, prevent, slow the spread and improve the quality and
duration of life for people of color living with HIV/AIDS must acknowledge the
aforementioned realities. Additionally, urgent advocacy efforts are required to
assure that the plight of people of color living with HIV/AIDS, including
incarcerated persons, becomes an integral part of the national public discourse
on the government's role in the delivery of health and human services to its
people.</p>

<p>In response to these pressing needs, the Incarcerated Populations Working
Group of National Organizations Responding to AIDS (NORA), co-chaired by Ron
Bogard, has set forth a plan of action that responds to the following
concerns:</p>

<ul> <li>Despite high rates of HIV infection and an ideal opportunity for
prevention and education efforts, former prisoners are reentering their
communities with little or no added knowledge about HIV disease and how to
prevent it. Lack of education of both inmates and staff creates fear and
discrimination toward individuals with HIV disease and unjust policies directed
toward inmates living with HIV. <p> <li>Prisoners with HIV disease are often
subjected to automatic segregation from the rest of the prison community.
Segregation exposes a confidential fact of prisoners' health status to the rest
of the community of inmates and officials. <p> <li>Prisoners with HIV infection
are rapidly acquiring tuberculosis and many more are at increased risk from the
resurgent tuberculosis epidemic in the nation's prisons. <p> <li>Inmates living
with HIV disease are often denied access to specialists outside the correctional
facility who could significantly improve their medical condition. <p> <li>Special
diets or housing appropriate for those with HIV disease are often lacking. <p>
<li>Prisoners with HIV disease are denied access to early release programs,
effective discharge planning and are routinely denied compassionate release when
they are near death. </ul>

<p><b>Mobilizing the Compromised Immune System in Catastrophic
Illness</b><br>Interview with Lawrence LeShan, Ph.D.<br> <i>By Joan
Caplin</i></p>

<p>Dr. Lawrence LeShan may be a psychotherapist but he is more concerned with
prolonging people's lives than he is with enriching them. This is because his
clients are almost exclusively from the world of the terminally ill. The key to
the successful method he has researched and practiced for more than 50 years is
teaching patients how to expand their own immune systems. "If you treat yourself
with zest and enthusiasm," he maintains, "your immune system will respond. It
will have a positive reaction to an environment that says, 'I'm worth fighting
for.'"</p>

<p><img src="../gifs/leshan.gif" align=right hspace=5>How one does this is as
numerous as the patients who practice it. By his own admission, Dr. LeShan
initially knew very little about how to achieve his goal, but there was one thing
he felt sure about. The traditional medical/Freudian model wasn't the answer.
Based on three questions -- Why is this person here? -- What's the hidden cause
of their illness? What can we do about it? -- may have worked for the emotional
or perceptual or intellectual activities of a patient's life but it wasn't making
a dent in the activity of their immune system. So Dr. LeShan decided to change
the questions. What he asked was, "what's right with this person?" And having
determined that, he and his patient could concentrate on how to move in that
direction.</p>

<p>An extremely shy patient who was diagnosed with terminal cancer came to him
with the wish that things remain as they were. The two were getting nowhere until
Dr. LeShan decided to make his patient go through her entire week, day by day,
hour by hour until she got to her favorite moment. It was singing in the choir
and that led her to confess that she, as a mother of three grown children had a
wish that began in her childhood and that was far too embarrassing to admit.
Several more weeks of coaxing brought forth the dark confession. It was that
she'd always wanted to learn how to play the piano. Finally persuaded to find a
teacher and a neighbor willing to let her practice on her upright, the patient
achieved a lifelong desire. Her tumor regressed and twenty years later she is
still playing quietly and privately in the back room of her apartment where
several years ago her husband deposited a surprise piano of her very own.</p>

<p>Dr. LeShan believes it is essential that the partner of the ill patient gets
involved in this process. "If only one person in the relationship changes, "it's
splitsville." That's why he or those he trains like to see the patient's partner
at least once. The patients themselves are primarily treated one-on-one although
in the last few years, Dr. LeShan has given intensive five day workshops for ten
to twelve people with three or four therapists. Private sessions last as long as
thy need to but Dr. LeShan believes strongly that that should not mean a
lifetime. "People should find their center in themselves, not in their
therapists."</p>

<p>His approach of pinpointing areas of "zest and enthusiasm" means that the
other feelings which might accompany an illness such as rage, guilt or depression
are dealt with primarily in terms of how they affect a person's future. "The
immune system is feeble minded," Dr. LeShan quipped. If you feel yourself to be a
unique individual who is worth taking care of, you can convert your immune system
into a force that will help you prolong your life. And if those extra years are
spent thriving, you will have healed and enriched not only your body but your
spirit as well. </p>

<p><b><a name="nutrition">Nutrition</a></b></p>

<p><b>Getting Good Nutritional Information</b><br> <i>By Edwin Krales</i></p>

<p>It's difficult to integrate a sound nutritional program into our daily lives.
The problem isn't that the information is unavailable. It's that most of the
nutritional information we hear and read every day is at odds with reality. This
misinformation fits into three main areas. The first is that the field of
nutrition is published by the diet business. The second is the role of
advertising. The third is the fact that nutrition is still not considered an
equal partner in the war against HIV disease.</p>

<p>We also know that accurate nutrition education works. According to an article
recently published by the Department of Community Health, Tufts University School
of Medicine, "nutrition counseling alone led to weight gain or weight maintenance
compared with weight loss in patients who received no advice about nutrition."
The article goes to say that people with HIV disease who were counseled
accurately started following a healthier eating plan.</p>

<p>The problem is how do we learn to separate good, accurate, health -improving
information from the barrage of nutrition hype that we are exposed to daily. The
first point to understand is that nutrition and weight loss mean almost the same
thing in our society. Depending on whose figures you want to believe, the diet
business makes between thirty and fifty billion dollars each year. Weight loss
diets fail their users at the rate of 95 percent to 99 percent over the course of
five yearsÉ The success of the diet business is dependent upon the failure of the
diets. Therefore it is unlikely that the published information is based on sound
science or good health Rather it is based on what is going to produce the most
money. Unfortunately the writers of these comic books usually come equipped with
lots of impressive credentials. I call them the "D" team. There are MD's, ND's,
Ph.D.'s, LD's, RD's and CDN's. They are all backed by LLD's so that the data they
extract from their imaginations or from unpublished or even unwritten papers
won't put them in the D block at the local penitentiary.</p>

<p>People with healthy immune systems may get sick from following fad diets. If
you have a compromised immune system, you are more at risk. The last thing you
want to do is lose weight. You may want to change the ratio of fat to muscle in
your body, but that goal should not be approached from the perspective of weight
loss, especially if you are HIV-positive.</p>

<p>The second issue is that HIV and AIDS has become a huge business. Some
products are produced and advertised by the same people who work in the diet
business. Advertising is known for its effectiveness, not its honesty. You won't
see Joe Camel holding up a sign an a highway billboard that says, "Smoking will
make your life hell while it kills you." By the same token, don't use as your
primary nutrition counselor anyone who sees you as a cash cow. The sales people
in a health food store may mean well, but the information that they present to
you has been presented to them by people who wish they had invented Joe Camel.
Keep in mind that the largest food manufacturer in the U.S. if not the world is a
cigarette producer. Other good things to remember are some of the nutritional
fads of the recent past that have fallen from favor. They aren't promoted much
anymore because people have died. Three examples are poorly manufactured
L-tryptophan, mega-dosing with vitamin B vitamin niacin, and have a love affair
with the Kambucha fungus-mushroom tea concoction. I am sure that in a very short
time we will be told that large amounts of chromium belongs in car bumpers, not
on your plate. Another popular advertising ploy often used in alternative
treatments is the existence of the magic potion. The existence of the magic
potion is usually combined with a conspiracy theory. The conspiracy goes
something like this. The allopathic medical establishment wants to keep people
with HIV from getting the magic potion because it will cure them. If they are
cured, then doctors, hospitals and their bosses, the drug companies, will lose a
lot of money. The problem with this line of advertising is that an increase in
sales, not a cure, is the goal. The manufacturer of alternative preparations are
not giving them away, they are selling them. They present no evidence that their
preparations work. Unfortunately, not many researchers are investigating the
efficacy of the countless preparations that exist. It seems reasonable that some
should have some positive effects. My own personal experience tells me that this
is so. However, no matter what the claims to one, either in print or by word of
mouth, there is no magic potion.</p>

<p>It is widely accepted that weight loss is the number one killer of people with
HIV disease. Even so, there is no standard of care for people suffering from HIV
weight loss, malnutrition or wasting. Why? Many studies have been done, and
Doctors Donald Kother, Todd Lazarus and others have been working on the problem
for years. Dr. Mary Rameyn has recently written a book on nutrition and HIV
disease. The <a href="../../network/tag/tag.html">Treatment Action Group</a> has put
out a new book called The Wasting Report. The information is there. So why isn't
there a ground swell of activity around feeding people with HIV disease? Why are
meal programs for a PWA's being threatened with extinction? The answers and some
possible solutions lie in our view of nutrition as a social issue.</p>

<p>For the most part, who are the nutritionists? Women. Women have always fed the
world. So it seems "natural" that the field is dominated by women. Unfortunately
women do not share equal status with men in our society. If a man decides to do
"women's work," he assumes the social status that goes along with it, not to
mention the pay scale.</p>

<p>Medicines can be patented, money can be made. Good nutrition operates in the
public domain. The best foods have been around forever. The less you do them, the
better they are.</p>

<p>Good nutrition is not efficient. It doesn't lend itself to mass marketing
techniques. Aside from people's different nutrient needs that must be tailors to
the individual, different cultures like different kinds of food. One size does
fit all.</p>

<p>Drug therapy can create dependence and enormous profits. The role of the
nutritionist is to make people independent through education. After learning the
basics, students no longer need the nutritionist and can go further on their
own.</p>

<p>Nutrition ultimately falls into the area of prevention. Prevention is much
more cost effective than cure for individual and society as a whole. On the other
hand, prevention cuts into profits. A drug company is not going to promote a
nutrition therapy, no matter how effective, that will reduce the profits.</p>

<p>What is a person living with HIV disease to do with such a situation? First,
educate yourself. Don't wait for an invitation. Join community-based AIDS
organizations. Meet with the nutritionist, learn what they have to offer. Always
get more than one opinion. Make sure the people who advise you have nothing at
stake but your well-being. Learn how to eat, what to eat and the role of
exercise. Talk to other people living with HIV. Find out about congregate meal
programs, home-delivered meals and grocery programs. Learn to use the Internet to
exercise your mind and keep abreast of new information. </p>

<p>Don't isolate yourself! Eat more with friends. Remember your mother was right

<p>A regular Consumer News reader and ADR advocate has taken ill from what he
suspects to be the "raspberry disease," which he believes he contracted from a
luscious restaurant dessert. When eating in restaurants and there is a food
advisory, it is best to ask the waiter to ask the chef how the food is prepared.
Like, do they wash the berries or fruit and where were they grown? If there is a
question about it, order something else or nothing at all. You have a right to
know what you are spending your money on. Remember, your health (and perhaps your
life) depends on it.</p>

<p><b>A Mother's Diary Of Her Son's Struggle with AIDS: The Last Year - Part
I</b><br> <i>By Anna Nimos</i></p>

<p>I am really glad Marc let me be part of his dying. It is a privilege many
dying adult sons with AIDS don't allow their parents, because of the conflicts
they have had over their son's sexual orientation. Marc and I didn't have
conflicts over his lifestyle, but we had our share of parent/child power
struggles. As a parent it is so hard to finally relinquish control over your
child -- parental control may only be an illusion any way -- but it makes us feel
we can mold and protect the little creature we think we had some role in
creating. When they grow up it is so hard to let go and let them live their lives
and make their decisions and make their mistakes and live -- or die -- with the
consequences and still keep on loving them and keep on sharing their lives. I
think that transition from dependence is the root of all the conflict between
parent and child and in the final analysis, no matter how wise the parent, no
matter how conscious of setting the stage for independence, it is the child who
has to wrest himself (or herself) out of the controlling grip of the parent.</p>

<p>That's the process Marc and I completed before he died. The art of growing up
is being your own person, being in control of your own life. In Marc's case,
being in control of his own death. Marc was his own person, but as independent as
he was, as independent as I wanted him to be, we still had that underlying
tension between us because he sensed I was still, even though I wasn't really
conscious of it, trying to impose my will on certain aspects of his life --
namely on his death. After all I was his mother and I was there to take care of
him.</p>

<p>I arrived in Seattle about 11 a.m. on December 9, 1993. Jane and Paula met me
at the airport. I had a bad cold and gone to my doctor earlier in the week to get
an antibiotic. He assured me that I would not be contagious by the time I arrived
in Seattle, but I was still miserably congested. The Afrin he gave me worked only
long enough to keep my head clear for take off and landing. I knew Jane. Marc had
invited her to stay with us in DC for the ACT UP Conference in 1992, and she had
stayed at our house again for the April 1993 National March in Washington. I
liked her looks -- a lesbian with short, wild colored hair with a little pink
barrette holding a tuft of hair in front, her pierced tongue and eyebrow, her
clear skin and solid build, her clothes, her youth.</p>

<p>Jane introduced me to Paula. Paula was wearing a khaki army jacket like I used
to wear in the late sixties and seventies when I fashioned myself an anti-war
militant, a revolutionary, if you will. She had gray hair like mine and was in my
age range. She immediately established her credentials with me -- a veteran
"movement" person starting at age 15 with Caesar Chavis and still bears the scars
on her back from a grower's whip in Caesar's first attempt to organize the farm
workers; an anti-war activist; a militant lesbian who had to flee California
because of attempts on her life by the Christian right; a social worker; has a
brother with AIDS; had "buried 50 young men with AIDS." She was surprised we were
contemporaries; Marc had told her I was "old" and she was expecting a really old
lady. We immediately hit it off. She tried to prepare me for the way Marc would
look. She explained that despite their efforts to get him to eat, he had lost a
lot of weight and cut all of his hair off in anticipation of it all falling out
anyway from the chemotherapy. We went straight to Virginia Mason Hospital. Marc
was in room 1062. The tenth floor was the cancer floor and Marc was to return to
that floor three times before he died. When I walked in, Marc was lying back in
the hospital bed that was rolled up into a sitting position. he had on a
multi-colored knit cap and although he was thin, he didn't look as bad as I
thought he would. (I realized I expected him to look skeletal as Steve had looked
when we visited him the last time.) He had an IV in each arm. There were lots of
flowers in the room and Tim, Susan, Victor and Tracy were there. Some of them
left and Gwen came in. Paula went for a smoke.</p>

<p>I kissed Marc, but was self-conscious about my cold. Marc seemed happy I was
there but I got the feeling that my presence was not entirely a comfort. He was
concerned about my health (both mental and physical). I was able to hide my tears
behind my cold but Paula told me the next day Marc had asked if I had been
crying. Since that worried him, I did my best to hide my tears from him and
succeeded 99 percent of the time. I think Marc had always been afraid that his
death would devastate me and somehow wanted to protect me from it while at the
same time wanting me there. I had to show him I could handle it. In reality, I
was devastated, and the first few days I wept around his friends every time his
name was mentioned; I cried at night, and in the morning, and on my walk to the
hospital, and in the hospital lounge and cafeteria and in the restroom; but not
around him. Then I finally got a grip.</p>

<p>Tracy had worked in the kitchen at the hospital and really knew her way
around. She had managed to get them to stock the nurses' station refrigerator
with popsicles and knew how to get ice water without asking for it. In fact
everyone seemed to know more about taking care of Marc and what he needed than I
did and I didn't feel very effective or useful at first, but within a day that
changed.</p>

<p>After several hours I told them I wanted to go to Marc's apartment and settle
in and we left. There was a cold drizzle and when we arrived at the apartment,
which had been empty for two days, it was ice cold. Marc, worried about his
heating bill, had turned off the heat. The apartment was dreary and forbidding,
not only because it was cold, but because it was crowded with unpacked boxes.
There was a full size blow-up mattress covering the entire floor of the small
living room and framed pictures and painting stacked on the card table in the
small eating area off the kitchen. The smell of garbage was noticeable when we
first entered, but it turned out to be some spoiled oranges sitting on the
table.</p>

<p>It was just too unwelcoming to stay. I turned on the heat and asked Paula, who
was chauffeuring me around, if we could get something to eat. Marc had warned her
that I was a vegetarian, so she took me to a vegetarian restaurant two blocks
away. It was about 3 p.m. so they weren't serving meals but came up with a bowl
of black beans. I ate a few and took the rest home. The apartment was warm by
then and I decided to unpack and take a nap. Paula, who lived only two blocks
away, gave me her number and told me to call her when I was ready to go back to
the hospital.</p>

<p>When I woke up it was dark. I called Paula and we got to the hospital around 7
p.m. -- just in time to see Marc not eat his fifth meal in a row. Paula was
really on his case. He had to eat; he had to cooperate; she was apparently still
mad about the fact that he had refused to take an MRI or a spinal tap that the
doctors thought were necessary to insure themselves that the lymphoma tumor was
confined to Marc's liver and had not gone to his central nervous system. Marc had
finally agreed to the MRI, which revealed nothing unusual. I stayed out of it. He
was very sick and weak from waiting so long before deciding to undergo
chemotherapy. He had postponed going to the hospital until my union elections
were over -- something he wanted to do for me, and I still hurt thinking of it.
He looked very sick and miserable. Around eight, a nurse brought him a sleeping
pill and when Marc got drowsy we left.</p>

<p>We clocked the distance between the hospital and the apartment and it turned
out to be a little under two mile -- a nice walk. I told Paula I would walk to
the hospital in the morning. I slept in Marc's bed. It was a rough night --
stuffed head and sore throat made worse by crying, bad dreams made worse by the
roaring sound of the plumbing whenever the tenant above drained his tub or
flushed the toilet.</p>

<p>The next morning I woke up at 4 a.m. since Seattle time was three hours later
than DC time. I killed time unpacking, showering, making calls back to DC and
watching TV. I went to the refrigerator and looked inside. It was packed with
small brown paper bags. When I opened them, I found molding meals that had been
prepared and delivered by the Chicken Soup Brigade, a volunteer organization
formed to help people with AIDS. It gave me such a heavy feeling throwing out all
of those uneaten meals and a box with an untouched small moldy pizza. Marc must
have answered the door each time the Chicken Soup Brigade volunteer delivered his
meal, put the bag in the refrigerator, and gone back to bed. Those unopened bags
made me see him sick and alone, holding off going to the hospital until my union
elections were over and they made me very sad. When it was light enough, I left
for the hospital. It was a bitter-cold 25-minute walk up Pike Street in the
dreary mist I soon came to expect from Seattle in December, January and
February.</p>

<p>I arrived at the hospital at 8:30 a.m. When I entered Marc's room he was in a
lot of pain. Apparently a nurse had brought his 6:00 a.m. dose of Morphine but he
had not taken it and it was still sitting on his side table. He was shaking and
cold. No nurses were around. I gave him his Morphine and got a heated blanket
from the hall oven I had observed coming in. The warmth of the blanket seemed to
comfort him. I remembered how good that hot blanket felt when I was cold and in
pain when I was waking up from my tubal ligation. I remembered how grateful I was
to the nurse who covered me with the warmed blanket. I saw the same gratitude in
Marc's eyes and it felt so good to be able to relieve his pain and give him
comfort. From that moment on, it seemed as though I lived to make Marc's
remaining time as comfortable as possible in every way. I felt myself rise above
myself at that moment. Every action, whether with his friends or doctors or him,
was defined by what will make Marc happy or comfortable. I stopped crying. I had
a job to do.</p>

<p>Later that morning, when Marc was feeling better after the morphine took
effect, they brought him his breakfast. His hands were shaking too much to hold a
spoon. I fed him apple sauce and oatmeal. I was thinking how much the situation
reminded me of when he was a baby and I fed him these same foods in his high
chair. His bald head with his ears sticking out added to the effect. It was both
sweet and painful. Marc must have had a similar thought. He said, "remember how
you used to tell us we reminded you of little birds when you fed us? I feel like
a little bird." I bonded with him all over again as I had when he was a newborn,
totally dependent on me for his survival. I was needed and in a strange way, it
made me happy. </p>

<p><b>Stopping Wars: Defining the Obstacles to Cease-Fire</b><br> Smith, James
D.D., Westview Press, 5500 Central Ave., Boulder CO 80301-2487 (309pp. $59.95.

<p><b>Stopping Wars</b> is a fascinating book which offers a creative and
concrete analysis of one of the fundamental problems of international dispute
resolution. Why do wars continue, or cease-fires fail to arise, in situations
where it is clear that limited or no advantage accrues to the parties from the
continuation of their conflict? If this sounds like a familiar domestic problem
as well, it is because many of the same factors that lead to failure to end a war
appear, in almost identical (although physically more limited form) in
matrimonial, corporate and commercial disputes. Thus many of the ideas that are
offered by James Smith in this book will have application in day-to-day dispute
resolution as well as in high level diplomacy, although Smith does not suggest or
focus on this analogy.</p>

<p>Smith identifies seven basic reasons why the belligerents themselves may be
unable to resolve their differences in wartime and also examines why third party
interventions such as mediation may also fail to obtain resolution. The seven
reasons are: a sense that a party may be gaining the upper hand, an unwillingness
to appear weak, the trap of believing that an attempt to resolve would
necessarily fail, a confusion of views among one party's constituencies, armies
which are out of control, and inability to negotiate effectively. The two
problems noted in third party intervention are the perception of lack of
impartiality, whether or not true or relevant, and resistance to perceived third
party compulsion.</p>

<p>The book is well written and well documented with examples drawn from a wide
range of military conflicts. For the reader more interested in "smaller" issues,
many of the ideas for overcoming the difficulties faced in these wars can be
directly translated to these non-lethal disputes.</p>

<p>This book is a review of policies that have been developed over the past five
years. Some have had limited success such as free needle exchanges, condoms to
prison inmates, and same-sex advertisements. Other policies are ongoing and are
still being tested such as the San Francisco Clinic Consortium, "which
coordinates clinics in developing AIDS treatment, health maintenance, and
prevention programs, based in communities as diverse as the Hispanic, African
American, intravenous (IV) drug using, and the homeless." The focus is on
community based research which is much more intimate than many of the
government-sponsored programs. There are currently over 650 community based
organizations in the U.S. that receive a mix of private, public, and individual
funding and are registered with the National AIDS Network. After an introductory
chapter, an overview is presented on how effective the community based
organizations have been.</p>

<p>The next chapter looks at IV drug users, using a Denver model. The fourth
chapter investigates the barriers that are present in a Puerto Rican community in
Hartford, Connecticut and the next chapter looks at the organizations serving
African Americans. Next, women and AIDS is covered followed with a chapter that
reviews the efforts of public health education. The college youth is covered in
some detail as an "elite of our society." The next chapter shows how primary care
physicians and their researchers work with the community to provide the needed
services. The ninth chapter reviews the excellent service of Gay Men's Health
Crisis, in New York, the largest and oldest of the AIDS service organizations
that is based in the community. Next, the migrant Mexican farm worker in Michigan
camps is discussed. Chapter eleven provides an insight to the need for community
based political activism through ACT UP. "The concluding chapter draws on the
common lessons of each of the preceding studies to develop policy implications
and a theoretical model of community based organizations."</p>

<p>This is a well-written overview of the progress that has been made in
community based services in the U.S. These services are the life line of those
who are afflicted with AIDS. Without these services, the suffering would be much
more [widespread and severe] than it now is. The book points out the need to have
continued support and funding. Although all services do not succeed, those that
do are outstanding. It takes the failures to make the successful ones. A highly
recommended book for all service organizations, medical and academic libraries,
and large public libraries.</p>

<p><b>METRO</b><br> Consumer News continues to hear horror stories about the
<b>Eligibility Verification Review (EVR)</b> program, a City supported
initiative, designed to uncover welfare fraud. Increasing numbers of DAS clients
have reported disturbing accounts of interactions with the program, beginning in
March. Recipients are initially warned by letter that they should expect a visit
on a given date. However, inspectors do not always appear on schedule and the
letter bears no phone number to rearrange the visit. When they do come knocking
on the door, they flash badges that read FEDS. They are not the FBI or the DEA --
rather it stands for "Front-End Detection System." PWAs have been harassed for
bizarre reasons, from allowing a relative or a care-partner to have a set of
apartment keys to being told that if they can afford to buy cat food, they must
be cheating the City!</p>

<p>Several have reported finding a note stating they were there upon arriving
home, and that their neighbors have been interrogated about the clients lifestyle
and daily routines. A slow response to the note has resulted in persons losing
all benefits. HIV legal service agencies report that significant numbers of cases
involve PWAs in hospital when inspectors call. Should you experience similar
difficulty contact an advocate or a legal service. See also <a

clients should be reassured that they will retain their housing as Steinway Child

with its scatter site program. When reached for comment by a CN reporter
Southeast Queens Clergy was tight-lipped and referred the caller to DAS.
Southeast Queens' Clergy joins Upper-Manhattan Task Force on AIDS, whose housing

<p>The <b>Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project (AVP)</b> plans to expand its
base beyond Manhattan. AVP, a leading voice in cases involving AIDS
discrimination, will open offices in Park Slope (Brooklyn) and Jackson Heights
(Queens). Jackson Heights is a neighborhood where multi-national Latinos have
settled. HIV infection in this community has been wide spread and is particularly
under-served by AIDS Service Organizations (ASO)</p>

<p><b>STATE</b><br> The new State Budget which finally passed after a
one-hundred-four day delay, mandates Medicaid managed care enrollment for people
with AIDS and HIV disease. A similar law had lapsed on June 30, 1996. AIDS
advocacy groups are concerned that strict guidelines will automatically push
people into certain plans if they miss choice deadlines. Under this bill,
disenrollment to switch to more appropriate plans will be difficult for Medicaid
insured patients.</p>

<p><b>NATION</b><br> Legal Times, May 20, 1996.<br> <br> <b>No
Alternative</b>...Larry Ray devoted 16 years to building the American Bar
Association's alternative dispute resolution section. But that didn't prevent him
from leveling a discrimination suit against the ABA on May 12. According to the
complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Ray was
illegally fired as staff director of the ABA's Section on Dispute Resolution last
September because he is HIV-positive. "He asked for mediation while he was there,
but it was ignored," says D.C. solo practitioner Mindy Daniels, one of his
lawyers. As Ray's filing deadline approached, the ABA made a stab at
reconciliation, says Daniels, but by then it was too late. "I just didn't think
that mediation was necessarily going to speed up the process, given conversations
that had already taken place," says Daniels. The ABA declines comment except to
say, "Larry Ray's health status had nothing to do with his termination." ABA
officials have other arrows to dodge as well: The Senate Judiciary Committee
plans to hold a hearing on May 21 on whether the ABA's political activities have
undermined its role as neutral evaluator of the qualifications of federal
judicial candidates.</p>

<p>The Board of Directors of the National Association for Community Mediation has
announced the formation of a management team. Attorney Larry Ray has been hired
as Executive Director, Bill Ferguson, promoted to Associate Director, and Joanne
Hartman continues as Administrative Coordinator. The National Association for
Community Mediation was established two years ago to support the maintenance and
growth of community-based mediation programs and processes. The association also
thrives to present a compelling voice in policy-making, legislative, professional
and other arenas and the development and sharing of resources for these efforts.
The association is an organization of community mediation programs and volunteer
mediators who support community mediation. </p>

<p><b>INTERNATIONAL</b><br> The <a
href="../../network/simple/protease.html">protease inhibitor</a> juggernaut was
spurred on by positive reports at the XI International Conference on AIDS in
Vancouver, Canada, and lavish spending from the drug companies who make them.
Certainly patients using the inhibitors in combination with AZT or its derivative
analogs have shown remarkable improvement. Larry Kramer, the original AIDS oracle
resurfaced in a timely piece in the New York Times Magazine to remind us, that
despite the efficacy of these therapies, a price tag of $20,000 per year will
mean that few can afford them. Mark Schoofs of the Village Voice wrote of Uganda
that the total health care spending -- public and private -- is less than $5 per
person. Tom Stoddard, long time AIDS advocate and lawyer stated that "the
conference seemed like a trade show for the pharmaceutical industry. The official
theme of the conference was "One World--One Hope." Some participants came up with
their own slogan, "Third World --No Hope.". . . </p>

<p><b><a name="edit">Editorial</a></b></p>

<p>There has been much discussion about the mandatory enrollment of Medicaid
recipients in managed care organizations. Some have warned that many of the
existing managed care organizations have no physicians who have experience
treating patients with HIV or AIDS. Others fear cost-containment measures will
negatively impact the quality of care. A number of housing service providers
argue that managed care professionals will displace housing workers, making them
little more than building managers and landlords.</p>

<p>These concerns must be taken seriously, and researched before people with
catastrophic illnesses enroll in managed care. Of particular interest is a
concern that ASO case managers may be replaced by case managers from a health
care model. Recently, the CMSA circulated a draft of its "Proposed Statement
Regarding Ethical Case Management Practice" which outlines the principles for
ethical case management. The document asserts that case managers are guided by
the principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, justice, veracity,
fidelity and privacy. This was brought to my attention through an article in the
Journal of Care Management. The article, "How Good Case Managers Make Tough
Choices: Ethics and Mediation," discusses in detail the use of conflict
resolution by case managers and the conflicts that arise as patients and their
families struggle with catastrophic illnesses. While the first of this two part
article is primarily an academic discussion, it provides an overview of the
mediation process and clinical and ethical issues that arise in managed care
environments and offers a "tool chest" for case managers. In Part 2 is a case
study that draws on the discussion in the first to illustrate how good case
managers can be more effective by using these "tools." </p>

The JRI Health group, an AIDS service provider out of Boston, Massachusetts, has
published a document entitled, <a
href="http://www.jri.org/infoweb/casemgmt/casephil.htm">Standards of Care for
Case Management Services</a> that is worth reading. This document sets good
standards for case managers that includes attention to communication skills. In
my view, a review of the emerging medical model -- case managers as mediators --
will benefit AIDS service providers, case managers, and their clients as well.
Pennsylvania has already made case mangers the mediator in managed care desputes
in order to safe guard the integrity of the client's terms. California may not be
far behind. </p>

<p>The public debate over the advent of managed care is encouraging all service
providers to redefine the roles of those who work directly with people living
with catastrophic illnesses. This can only serve to keep quality of care issues
on the front burner.</p>

<p><b>Bloodbath in Vancouver!</b><br> ACT UP/SF members drench panel members Paul
Volberding and Margaret Fischl with fake blood to protest promotion of
combination antiviral therapies that destroy the immune system.<br> <i>By Michael
Bellefoutaine and Todd Swindell.</i></p>

<p>Vancouver, B.C. -- Nearly ten years after the approval of the first AIDS
treatment, AZT, members of ACT UP/San Francisco crashed a panel discussion about
the drug's use in combination with other antiviral agents held during the 11th
International Conference on AIDS.</p>

<p>Chanting "Margaret Fischl: You're A Fraud! You Gave AZT The Nod!" and
"Volberding: Your Lies Kill! AZT's A Toxic Pill!"activists from ACT UP/SF stormed
into the pharmaceutical industry panel discussion "Guidelines for Antiretroviral
Therapy: Bringing The State-Of-The-Art To Clinical Practice." The presentation
announced recommendations for the administration of combination antiviral therapy
as outlined in the July 10th JAMA article "<a
href="http://www.ama-assn.org/special/hiv/library/jama96/st6007.htm">Antiretroviral
Therapy For HIV Infection in 1996: Recommendations of and International
Panel</a>."</p>

<p>AIDS activists charged panel members Margaret Fischl and Paul Volberding with
murder for instituting and maintaining a scientifically flawed, yet highly
profitable, AIDS treatment approach that urges people with HIV infection to
combat the disease with potent regimens of immune suppressive agents. Protesters
demanded an immediate end to the practice of treating AIDS patients with
dangerous chemotherapeutic agents. They asserted that the therapies hyped during
the week-long conference such as AZT, ddI, ddC and protease inhibitors impair the
immune system's natural ability to fight HIV and control the opportunistic
infections that kill people with AIDS.</p>

<p>ACT UP presented evidence that both Fischl and Volberding have accepted
pharmaceutical industry pay-offs to conduct experiments testing AZT and other
antivirals in humans. In fact, it was on the basis of information from Fischl's
1987 drug trial that AZT was approved; a trial that was years later exposed as
unreliable and poorly conducted and whose data was branded as fraudulent by
prominent AIDS researchers and statisticians.</p>

<p>The demonstrators criticized both the panel discussion and journal article
announced at the presentation as nothing more than an advertisement campaign
masquerading as science. Discussion was underwritten by an alliance of drug
companies including Glaxo-Wellcome, Bristol-Meyers Squibb, Hoffmann-La Roche,
Roxanne Laboratories, Chiron Corporation, Agouron, Merck, and Abbott
Laboratories.</p>

<p>"This entire AIDS conference was bought and paid for by the pharmaceutical
industry as a way to hype their deadly drugs," commented AIDS dissident Todd
Swindell. "These companies concoct expensive products; fund and execute tests of
them on humans to generate fraudulent data supporting their supposed efficacy;
and buy off mainstream AIDS organizations and conferences to then push these
unproven compounds down the throats of people with AIDS. The entire AIDS
treatment approach is murderously misdirected and must change!" ACT-UP SF demands
included:</p>

<ul> <li>AIDS researchers sever all financial ties with pharmaceutical companies;
<li>including stock options, grants, consultation fees, Honoria and reimbursement
fees for travel expenses. <li>AIDS researchers replace the current "kill the
virus with toxic drugs" treatment paradigm with an immune-based therapeutic
strategy that focuses on improving overall health and strengthening the cellular
immune response that is deficient in AIDS. </ul>

Francisco.</i></p>

Over a quarter of U.S. women with AIDS are New Yorkers, and the percentage of women among
total cases is 54% greater in New York than in the rest of the country.  In fact, AIDS is now
increasing faster among women than men in New York -- with African Americans and Latinas
accounting for over three fourths of female cases.  At the same time, AIDS is increasingly a
problem that impacts entire families.  Since the beginning of the epidemic, some 4,000 cases of AIDS among children have been reported in New York City, and the epidemic is expected to leave 55,000  children and young adults orphaned by the year 2000.
<P>
The growing number of women with HIV/AIDS presents a special challenge for AIDS service
organizations -- most of which have been traditionally oriented towards men.  In response to this
service gap, Momentum has established a family counseling program and recruited full-time
social worker Yolanda Rosado, CSW to develop and staff services targeted to women and parents. 
Hired in October 1995, Yolanda has been doing AIDS counseling since 1988 and brings a special
commitment to meeting the needs of women and parents to her work with Momentum.  In fact,
she spent part of her summer vacation this year working with children and youth with HIV and
their families at the Birch Family Camp in upstate New York.
<P>
Yolanda first started doing educational work with Mujeres Unidas (Women's Network) in East
Harlem -- training women to serve as peer educators and counselors and do outreach in New
York City public schools.  Yolanda also worked with women in prison with HIV/AIDS at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility -- the only maximum security women's prison in New York State -- and later handled AIDS case management at St. Clare's Hospital.
<P>
At Momentum, Yolanda offers individual and group counseling for women and families.  Her
outreach covers a range of issues, including domestic violence, health and safe sex, drug and
alcohol relapses, children in foster care, and how to disclose HIV status to kids or tell children
that they are infected.  The family groups also focus on setting up support systems for children
once their parents die or become too ill to care for them -- known as future custody planning. 
Yolanda attends each Momentum site on a rotating basis -- meeting with clients and making
referrals to agencies such as The Family Center, the HIV Law Project, and Mothers of Children
With AIDS, among others.  To encourage attendance at counseling and support groups,
Momentum has begun providing informal babysitting services for the growing number of children
who accompany their parents to our meal programs.

<P>The social work services that Yolanda provides help Momentum's clients deal with some of the
most basic problems that confront people living with AIDS. </p>

<p><IMG SRC="gifs/yolanda1.jpg" BORDER=2 ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=12>"For many of our clients, these
groups offer a rare opportunity to talk about the important relationships in their lives and their
need for support from family members and loved ones," Yolanda explains.  In many cases, clients
use the support groups to practice telling parents, children, or partners that they are HIV positive. 
"In a very real sense, Momentum helps our clients overcome the isolation and rejection that many
of them experience."</p></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>One of Momentum's two substance abuse counselors, Jos&eacute; Qui&ntilde;ones takes a unique approach to hiswork with clients who are struggling with drug use, as well as HIV and AIDS.  His outreach effortscombine solid training in substance abuse counseling with his own spirituality and a holistic approachto what he describes as the "life system management process."  Jos&eacute; is also candid about his personalexperience with some of the challenges his clients face -- having begun his own recovery five yearsago. <IMG SRC="gifs/jose.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 VSPACE=5><P>A self-proclaimed "resident of the world," Jos&eacute; was born in Puerto Rico and raised in New York.  Beforejoining The Momentum AIDS Project in April 1993, he worked as a volunteer Substance AbuseCounselor at Star House in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.  It was here that Jos&eacute; learned the importance ofpersonal empowerment in the process of recovery -- a lesson he summarizes with the wo!
 rds, "
If it is tobe, it is up to me."  It was also at Star House that he discovered his personal mission of working tohelp drug users who are HIV positive overcome their addictions -- a goal that was furthered by a seriesof trainings and workshops with recovery groups like ARRIVE, National Drug and Research Institute, Cicatelli Associates, Inc., the Washton Institute, and Gay and Lesbian Addiction Studies.  Jos&eacuteis currently pursuing an M.S.W. degree at Hunter College, as well as formal certification as an alcoholism counselor.
<P> In New York State, HIV transmission resulting from injection drug use is the leading cause of reported AIDS cases.  The correlation of injection drug use and HIV is particularly striking among women -- one of the fastest growing groups of people with AIDS.  According to the <A HREF="http://www.health.state.ny.us/">New York State Department of Health</A>, of the over 17,000 New York women diagnosed with AIDS since 1981, 88% have been injection drug users (IVDUs) or the sex partners of IVDUs.  Here at Momentum, an estimated 80% of clients are either current or former drug users.  <P>Many of the men and women Jos&eacute; counsels at Momentum are struggling with multiple addictions,including heroin, cocaine, crystal methamphetamines, and alcohol.  And he describes his most difficultchallenge as reaching substance users who feel there is no hope for recovery, health, or a better life. Their hopelessness about overcoming their addictions is compounded by the tremendous fe!
 elings offear and despair that HIV-positive people often experience.  Jos&eacute; and his fellow Momentum substanceabuse counselor, Alexis Smith, try to teach clients that there is hope and that recovery can happen.  Inaddition, they stress the importance of "staying clean" in preventing oppor
tunistic infections and fightingthe progression of AIDS.<P><IMG SRC="gifs/serenity.gif" ALIGN=LEFT VSPACE=9 HSPACE=9 BORDER=1>Jos&eacute; utilizes a variety of techniques in his individual and group counseling sessions, includingspirituality, Reiki, crystal healing, meditation, and, in some cases, aharm reduction approach.  Developed in the mid-1980s partly in response to the impact of HIV/AIDSon injection drug users, the harm reduction model emphasizes minimizing the damaging effects ofdrug use through programs such as needle exchanges; risk-reduction counseling; the distribution ofcondoms, dental dams, and bleach; and referral to drug treatment and other service providers.  Whileclients are not required to be in recovery, Momentum does enforce a strict no-drug use policy at all itsmeal sites.  In addition to maintaining a safe environment for clients, staff, and volunteers, this policyrespects the needs of those individuals who are actively attempting to remain !
 drug-f
ree.<P>Jos&eacute; says his work with Momentum is often challenging, but when asked to choose a single word thatbest describes his job, he immediately says "rewarding."   Jos&eacute; stresses the importance of viewingclients not as "problem people," but as individuals with specific problems that can be addressedthrough education and hard work.  And for many clients, Momentum provides an important source ofstability and information that empowers clients to make connections with other service providers andbegin the recovery process.  As Jos&eacute; pursues his mission of "facilitating the individual growth process,"he and his clients often depend on the Serenity Prayer:
<P>
<DL><DT><DD><I><FONT SIZE=-1><FONT COLOR="#800080"><B>God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,<BR>the courage to change the things I can,<BR>and the wisdom to know the difference.</B></FONT></FONT></I></DL> <P>"For most of us," Jos&eacute; says, "acceptance is the hardest one."

<h4><a name="forward">FORWARD</a></h4>

<p>We are entering into a new era for treatment of HIV because of the development of the new class of drugs called protease inhibitors and secondly because of the development of the new technology called viral load testing. On June 3, the FDA granted approval to Roche Diagnostics for their viral load test, AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR test, more commonly known as RT-PCR, viral load or HIV RNA PCR. It is the first test approved by the FDA. Chiron Diagnostic's bDNA test has been submitted to the FDA for consideration. Very recently, two important articles were published about viral load; key information from these articles are addressed here. </p>

<p>One of the two articles present important data from the Pittsburgh portion of MACS (Multi-center AIDS Cohort Study)--"Prognosis in HIV-1 Infection Predicted by the Quantity of Virus in Plasma" (John Mellors et al, May '96); it discusses the correlation between baseline viral load after HIV seroconversion and clinical progression (prognosis)--results say clinical progression can be predicted. The second article--"HIV Viral Load markers in clinical practice" (Mike Saag et al, June '96), discusses the <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/special/hiv/library/jama96/st6007.htm">recommended guidelines for using viral load tests</a> by the USA advisory panel to the International AIDS Society (IAS).</p>

<p>First is a reproduction (transcription) of a presentation by Dr. Robert Coombs on viral load: data related to using viral load measures and its correlation to clinical progression (prognosis); how to properly use the tests and interpret their results, and his comments on the IAS recommended guidelines. It is a mixture of direct quotes from his talk and discussion from this author. Dr. Coombs' talk was presented at the National AIDS Treatment Advocacy Project community treatment forum called: "Protease Inhibitors and Viral Load: Current and Future Use". It took place in Los Angeles on April 13, 1996. A limited supply of videotapes are available of the entire 4-hour forum by contacting NATAP.</p>

<p>Also available is NATAP's 46-page bound booklet--"HIV Protease Inhibitors Report-2nd edition", a comprehensive compilation of available data and information for 5 protease inhibitors. Soon after the Vancouver Conference an updated report will be available, in addition to comprehensive coverage of important breaking information from the Conference reported at our <a href="../index.html">NATAP Internet Web-site</a></p>

<p><i>Dr. Robert Coombs, MD, PhD, FRCP(C) Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Medicine University of Washington--Seattle, Washington</i></p> 

<h4><a name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h4>

<p>The quantitation of plasma viral RNA (commonly referred to as viral load) has provided valuable insights into the pathogenesis of HIV disease and activity of antiviral drugs, including protease inhibitors.</p>

<p>We need to define more clearly the correlates between plasma viral RNA, antiretroviral activity and clinical outcome or efficacy of a therapy. There is some missing information, which will be reviewed today, that we need to better understand the use and interpretation of viral load measurements.</p>

<p>Plasma RNA measurements will have an important role in the clinical treatment decisions doctors and other health providers will be making with HIV infected individuals.</p>

<p>Today, I will give some background and recommendations that are designed to give you some guidelines and guidance to understanding the use and interpretation of viral load measurements.</p>

<p>The following considerations will be addressed today:</p>

<ul>
<li>what does an HIV-1 RNA level mean?
<li>what constitutes a meaningful change in HIV-1 RNA level?
<li>do changes in HIV-1 RNA level have the same clinical meaning for persons with high compared to those with low HIV-1 RNA levels?
<li>what are the cost-to-benefit considerations in driving the virus load to "as low as possible?"
</ul>

<p>Without going into much detail about the technologies involved, there are two current approaches to measuring viral RNA:</p>
<ul>

<li>branched DNA (bDNA) assay, which is based on a signal amplification <li>technology;
<li>RT-PCR is based on the reverse transcriptase methodology of amplifying the viral target; the AMPLICOR HIV-I MONITOR test which uses this method is commercially available
<li>two other methods, the NASBA or QC-PCR assays (quantitative competitive PCR), are available as research tests; they all share a common methodology of amplifying the viral target.
</ul>

<p>An important principle in this disease is that individuals who become HIV-infected establish an equilibrium between their host immune system and their virus within the first 6 to 12 months of infection. Dr. Coombs described three different groups characterized by the course of the progression of their disease, into one of these three which individuals may fall. Each of the 3 groups was represented on a graph (displayed by Dr. Coombs) depicting the course of that group's progression to AIDS. In the first group, individuals contain the virus effectively, have very low viral load levels (the equilibrium setting their viral load level at well under 10,000 RNA copies within the first 6 to 12 months of infection), and the graphic depiction of the course of their viral load measurements may remain very flat over the course of many years, possibly extending 10 years, and defines a slow-progressing group of patients. The second group does not contain the virus very well and is characterized by having very high viral load levels (100,000 or higher) within the first 6 to 12 months of infection, and they progress very rapidly to an AIDS defining illness, as early as three years after HIV infection. </p>

<p>The third group is in between, with between about 10,000 to 100,000 RNA copies, and patients falling into this group show an intermediate progression rate. The graph line depicting this group slowly ascends from the 6-12 month post sero-conversion period to 7 or 8 years out and depicts this intermediate rate of progression of the disease. As you can see, not all patients start off with low levels and progress to high levels as the disease progresses. </p>

<p><b>FDA concerns</b>. If you take a patient's viral load measure at any point along the line of the course of their disease to assess their risk of progression, and if you lower their RNA measure with therapy--- the question that is not yet answered is---if you lower that RNA level to say 10,000 do you indeed alter the course of their disease progression? Will the future course of the progression of that person's disease be the same as a person whose viral load was at that level (10,000) prior to therapy? We don't yet know the answer to this question, but we surmise that will occur, i.e. that lowering of viral measure will alter the clinical course of the individual's disease--delay progression and prolong life. The FDA wants a study to address this question. The FDA's very recent approval of the RT-PCR test is for prognosis. In order to approve the tests for "monitoring clinical therapy", the FDA wants a study(s) that examines individuals who make therapy changes vs. those who don't make therapy changes, after detecting viral load increases. The studies described below do not examine this question, but they study prognosis. However, many doctors and people with HIV/AIDS are using the tests for "monitoring clinical therapy', despite the FDA's limited approval. The FDA stated, in their approval language for the RT-PCR test, --"the test has also been used as an aid in assessing viral response to antiretroviral treatment as measured by changes in HIV-1 RNA levels". A few published papers, in the last year or so, highlight Dr. Coombs' principle. Following is data from a Mellors paper published in the Annals of Internal Medicine 1995; 122: 573-579, that looks at individuals in the Pittsburgh portion of the MACS group.</p>

<h4><a name="predict">Viral</a> load measures just after seroconversion predict disease progression, independent of CD4</h4>

<p>The bDNA assay was used for this study. When the analysis was done, only the 1st generation bDNA assay, which measures only as low as 10,000 copies was available. Therefore, the plasma negative group are those individuals that had below 10,000 copies and the plasma positive group is those that had above 10,000 RNA copies. Since this analysis was completed, the 2nd generation bDNA test has become available, which measures as low as 500 copies; and, by looking at additional data, using the more sensitive assay, similar conclusions have been reached (discussed later in this article), that define a lower limit, of 20-30,000 RNA copies, that may indicate a more rapid progression. Baseline RNA measures were those obtained shortly after seroconversion.</p>

<p>Individuals who had below or above 500 CD4, and had either no virus detected in their plasma (plasma neg.) by the bDNA assay (meaning below 10,000) or who had consistently greater than 10,000 copies (plasma pos.), had very different progression rates to the development of AIDS. Individuals who consistently had less than 10,000 RNA copies had very low rates (6% and 0%) and individuals consistently above 10,000 had very high rates of progression and these differences were significant.</p>

<p>In fact, this study showed, that using the bDNA assay, individuals with more than 100,000 had a 10 times greater risk of developing AIDS within the next 5 years, than those individuals with under 10,000 copies; and, importantly these conclusions are independent of the CD4 count; that is, whether your CD4 was below or above 500, the rates of progression between the two groups (plasma pos. &amp; plasma neg.) were significantly different.</p>

<h4><a name="variable">Variability</a> of viral load measurements.</h4>

<p>Dr. Coombs displayed a graph showing only one individual's variability in RNA measures over the course of one week. Although anecdotal, it is intended to illustrate a point. This person's RNA was measured three times (morning, noon, and night) on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and the following Monday. There was a good amount of variability in the scores, both within given days and between different days. (These measures are approx.) On the 1st Monday, the measures were 25,000, 28,000 and 37,000; on Wednesday: 35,000, 37,000 and 35,000; on Friday-- 40,000, 47,000 and 84,000; on the last Monday-- 50,000, 57,000, 65,000, 67,000 and 71,000. There are rises of 2 to 3 fold, all within 1 week. The first measure (25,000) on Monday is more than 3-fold less than the highest measure on Friday (84,000).</p>

<p>There are two points, Dr. Coombs is trying to illustrate.</p>

<ol>
<li>There is variability within individual measurements of the virus. It is <li>generally believed that the biological variability is 3-fold (or 0.5 log). This needs to be taken into consideration when sequentially assessing a patient's RNA measures;
<li>Various factors perturb virus level: we are learning that concurrent infection, immunizations, and unexplained events can cause the virus load to jump quite dramatically 2, 3 or more fold. For example, reactivation of genital herpes by itself, which can be clinically innocuous, can result in a significant short-term rise in viral load. 
</ol>

<p>A doctor and the patient need to understand there is variability in measurement and generally it is considered that a 3-fold difference in measures falls with the window of variability we may expect to see.</p>

<p><b>Commentary</b>: If a 3-fold change is sustained repeatedly over time (sustained means repeating the test a few times with the same result), that difference may not be merely a variability, but may reflect a real change in viral load.</p>

<h4><a name="relation">Relationship</a> between disease progression and baseline RNA levels.</h4>

<p>An important study you may have heard about is AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) 175. Dr. Coombs uses some data from this study to illustrate some points about viral RNA that he thinks are important. This study was chosen, to make his points, simply because the plasma was collected specifically for RNA measurement. That is, the proper anti-coagulant was chosen, specimens were processed in a very fixed time period and stored appropriately.</p>

<p>In this study, the RNA was measured by Roche's recently FDA-approved RT-PCR assay. Many of the natural history studies and other studies that have been published use different RNA detection technologies; and, the retrospective studies usually deal with plasma banks that were not initially designed to measure RNA in. Therefore, trying to define what the absolute RNA level is, can be very difficult in these retrospective studies. Furthermore, the different assays have been run without a common standard, and that makes comparison between one assay type and another problematic. For the management of patients, I think we want to get down to the issue of what is the absolute RNA level in the patient and how does that correlate with their overall immune status. It's much more difficult to manage patients based on relative levels of virus, but at the moment we are sort of in the position of having to do that.</p>

<p>[<b>Commentary</b>: There are many factors affecting the accuracy and reliability of RNA test results, and we have not yet been able to adequately understand how each of these factors may affect a measure or series of measures.]</p>

<p>ACTG 175 was randomized, double blinded, and involving 2,467 individuals, who were randomized to either AZT, ddI, AZT/ddI, or AZT/ddC. A cohort of 400 individuals from this study had a very detailed virological analysis done: antiretroviral naive 55%, asymptomatic 85%, symptomatic 15%. The mean CD4 count of 343 was relatively high. Plasma was collected and stored specifically for RT-PCR assessment.</p>

<p>Dr. Coombs showed a graph of unpublished data that's been presented at meetings by Dr. David Katzenstein, that shows the relationship between the percent of progression to clinical endpoints and baseline RNA levels {<i>baseline</i> means that the RNA measure was before receiving study drug(s)}. </p>

<p>The endpoints are divided into three groups: 

<ul>
<li>the complete clinical endpoint, which is the combination of a 50% decline <li>in CD4 count, the development of AIDS, or death; 
<li>the 2nd group is AIDS or death; 
<li>and the 3rd group is just AIDS alone. 
</ul>

<p>The progression to these endpoints for each of these 3 groups is compared between 4 different categories of baseline RNA ranges of measures. The first RNA group is those individuals with under 5,000 RNA copies; the second group is individuals between 5,000 and 19,000 copies; the third group is composed of individuals with between 19,000 RNA copies and 54,000; and the fourth group represents those with greater than 54,000 copies. </p>

<p>Those with over 54,000 RNA copies had, by far, the highest progression rates (prognosis), for each of the three clinical endpoint groups: the three markers; or progression to AIDS and death; or just death. Individuals with 19,000 to 54,000 RT-PCR copies had the next highest progression rate, in each of the 3 endpoint groups. Individuals with under 19,000 copies progressed the most slowly in each of the 3 endpoint groups; essentially, those from both groups, under 5,000 and 5,000 to 19,000, were quite similar in their rates of progression, as their was no significant difference. Clearly, in this study, disease is being driven by the people with the higher viral loads, more so with individuals with more than 54,000 copies, but also inclusive of those with more than 20,000 copies.</p>

<h4><a name="2log">A 2 log</a> RNA reduction is not the same for everyone.</h4>

<p>The issue of relative changes is important. Dr. Coombs displayed a chart of 3 RNA measures: 1,000,000, 100,000 and 10,000. If each had a 2-log reduction in viral load, the 1 million would be reduced to 10,000---the 100,000 would be reduced to 1,000 and the 10,000 would be reduced to 100. The question to us--is the clinical benefit of driving the viral load down 2 logs, the same for individuals in the different ranges of RNA measure? Biologically and intuitively, you can surmise that those with the highest measure at baseline of 1 million, would be the group that would benefit most from driving the viral load down as low as possible. </p>

<p>This is a crucial question because it impacts how aggressively one pursues initiating or changing therapy, and at what cost do we drive the viral load down. Now that we have these very potent drugs--protease inhibitors--the practical use of these drugs is vital to individuals, in the hopes of optimizing and not wasting the potential benefits that may accrue to you from this class of drugs.</p>

<p>Following is a review of data that approaches this concern differently. This data was presented by Upjohn &amp; Pharmacia at the 3rd Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in January 1996. It looks at the relationship in the change in viral load for the patients in their two studies (n=1740) of delavirdine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, as measured by their own in-house assay, . The study participants have been randomized to different treatment regimens, and have been taking study drug for an average of 10 months (range 2 to 18 months).</p>

<p>The patients were grouped into 3 different viral load ranges of measures: greater than 1,000,000 copies; under 100,000 copies; and the middle group of 100,000 to 1 million. We don't know how these numbers correlate with the RT-PCR assay or the bDNA assay because the in-house test used by Upjohn wasn't run with the same set of standards as the other tests. </p>

<p>[<b>Commentary</b>: However, Upjohn says their assay was validated and it has the same degree of efficiency and reproducability as the RT-PCR assay; and, the RNA measure is 5 times that of the RT-PCR measure, i.e. a 1 million RNA measure, by the Upjohn assay, is equal to 200,000 RT-PCR copies, 100,000 copies by Upjohn assay is approximately equal to 20,000 RT-PCR copies.]</p>

<p>Individuals were also grouped by changes in viral load, that resulted from the study therapy to which they were randomized; the 5 groups were: (1) individuals with an increase in RNA; (2) a RNA reduction of a 0.5 log to 0.3 log or 2-3 fold; (3) a reduction of 3 to 5 fold; (4) a decrease of 5 to 10 fold or 1 log; (5) a decrease of more than 1 log.</p>

<p>The graph shown by Dr. Coombs illustrated the point that individuals with the highest viral load (the group with more than 1 million copies), in this study, benefitted the most, as measured by clinical progression. In this group with viral load above 1 million (at baseline), individuals: in group (1) with an increase in viral load (subsequent to initiating therapy), showed the least benefit in clinical progression; there is a linear relationship in the amount of benefit each group had, as measured by clinical progression; that is, the more of a reduction in RNA that individuals had, then the greater their benefit, as measured by clinical progression. </p>

<p>The linear relationship between these groups was clearly evident in the group of individuals with greater than 1 million copies. In the middle group, of individuals with RNA between 100,000 and 1 million, the relationships between the 5 groups weren't quite as linear but, viral load reductions, even modest ones, showed reductions in clinical progression. In the group with under 100,000 RNA copies (20,000 RT-PCR copies), there seemed to be no difference in benefit to clinical progression, between the 5 groups.</p> 

<p>Dr. Coombs said, this suggests to him that individuals with higher viral load may receive more benefit than individuals with lower viral loads from therapy that results in similar reductions in viral load. Again, he suggested this may be a factor in how aggressively we use therapy to drive the viral load down. [<b>Commentary</b>--However, As I suggest in discussion below, because this group is a healthier population, it may take much longer to detect differences in clinical responses.]</p>

<p>[<b>Commentary</b>: His earlier point was--what is the cost/benefit ratio of driving viral load down "as low as possible"? The results of this study indicate that at least among individuals with higher viral load (most likely for those with above 54,000 RNA, and mostly for those above 20,000), the amount of viral load reduction correlates with clinical progression, i.e. even incremental changes (a difference between 3-5 fold and 2-3 fold) in viral load produce differences in clinical progression (prognosis). </p>

<p>The Upjohn studies will not be completed until 1997, but data has been accumulated and analyzed for individuals with an average of 10 months in the trials (range 3-18 months). Although the analysis is preliminary, because the study is still ongoing, you can surmise some confirmation of viral load's correlation with clinical progression (prognosis). There are two studies. For protocol #17, the average CD4 was 135 at study entry, study participants averaged 1 to 1.5 years of AZT-experience. Subjects were randomized to either ddI alone or delavirdine + ddI. For the 2nd study, protocol # 21, subjects averaged 335 CD4, were AZT-naive or with under 6 months experience, and were randomized to either AZT, or AZT+delavirdine (Individuals were randomized to receive 3 different doses of delavirdine: 200, 300 or 400 3X/day). </p>

<p>As you can see, individuals with higher CD4 (335) in #21, progressed more slowly, than those with lower CD4 (135) in #17. These are individuals whose viral load changed as a result of therapy, but therapeutic intervention did not occur because viral load was increasing, for any particular individual (that is the FDA's point). It is only 10 months of follow-up, and we do need longer-term data, but the implications are encouraging.</p>

<p><b>Commentary (cont.)</b>: This study, in summary, makes 4 points: (1) changes in viral load measures, that occur from therapy correlate with clinical progression, at least at 10 months; but, as mentioned earlier if an individual's viral load is rising and you then intervene with therapy and the viral load declines--will that person's course of disease progression be positively altered? As Dr. Coombs said, we are surmising that it will alter the course of disease progression, but, he and the FDA say we need studies to confirm this; however, the concern is that some individuals in such a study would be randomized to the control group and thereby potentially suffer; (2) together, CD4 and viral load may be more predictive than either alone; (3) individuals with higher viral load may benefit more, from an equal viral load reduction, than those with low viral loads (under 20,000). Although this needs confirmation, it brings into the equation, the consideration of the cost/benefit ratio; (4) each incremental reduction in viral load (for example, a difference between a 2-3 fold and a 3-5 fold reduction) may result in a difference in clinical progression, which again may be more pronounced at higher viral load levels.</p>

<h4><a name="when">When</a> does an individual initiate therapy??</h4>

<p>Dr. Coombs is suggesting, that once your viral load is at a certain level or "threshold" (which, he advises, we have not yet been able to establish, and it is suggested from various sources that it could be 20,000, 5,000 or 10,000 again depending also on the assay being used; or, below "detectability" is suggested as a goal by some researchers--which can be below 500, 200 or 25 depending on the test used), then lowering your viral load even more should be weighed by the costs and potential benefits. The cost of lowering your viral load can include using up treatment options, financial, and side effects. He is suggesting, it may be beneficial to save treatment options, rather than lowering viral load to "as low as possible"?</p>

<p>However, let me make reference to a commentary from below, but relevant to this discussion: "....in patients with more advanced disease (median CD4 cell count, 89/ul), disease progression occurred in up to 30% of patients with fewer than 10,000 HIV RNA copies/ml." --Saag et al, Nature Medicine, vol 2, number 6, June 1996. This progression rate, of 30% appears to be greater than for individuals with under 10,000 RNA copies but higher CD4 counts. Additionally, with reference to the Upjohn study data, the reason that for individuals in the lowest viral load group (under 100,000--or as Upjohn says, the equivalent of 20,000 RT-PCR), there may not be this linear relationship (whereby, those with greatest RNA reduction received the most benefit to clinical progression), is because this arm of the study had fewer participants, their CD4 counts were probably higher, there RNA levels were lower --therefore, they have less risk of progression, less endpoints have so far been accumulated and it should take more time to detect progression and the possibility of development of the linear relationship. Despite what Dr. Coombs says, this may leave open to question, his assertion that it may not be beneficial (cost/benefit ratio) for individuals with RNA below a certain level, say 5-10,000, to initiate protease inhibitor therapy. Research needs to address these type of questions, so we can try to better utilize viral load technology and protease inhibitors. Considering these factors, Dr. Coombs still suggests the cost/benefit ratio factor may limit treatment to individuals in the lower viral load levels. </p>

<p>The more "conservative," cautious, or less aggressive approach, put forward by Dr. Coombs, of when to initiate therapy, represents one school of thinking. Some other leading AIDS researchers are suggesting that the better approach may be to "hit hard and hit early". That is, treat with the most potent therapy and possibly treat as early as possible in an individual's disease stage, unless perhaps if your viral load is already very low (under 5,000 or 10,000) and/or your CD4 may be relatively high. Although, a more aggressive wing of this group may be supporting the notion of "hit hard and hit early" as soon as possible, even soon after sero-conversion--during primary or new infection (after contracting the virus)-- for the purpose of rendering an individual's viral load "undetectable" or as low as possible for as long as possible. </p>

<p>This approach is based in part on early or preliminary data discussed below, which was presented publicly at the Vancouver Int'l. AIDS Conference in July; in these 2 small pilot studies, suppressing virus to "undetectable" levels (in the 2 studies discussed, "undetectable" viral load was defined as below 25 RNA equiv/ml in one study and below 100 RNA equiv/ml in the other--as measured by bDNA) has kept viral replication in check, thereby prevented resistance from emerging, and permitting viral RNA to remain undetectable for a still ongoing period for all study subjects remaining in the trials; (see the NATAP paper <a href="erad.html">Can HIV be eradicated" from the infectedindividual?</a>) </p>

<p>Other trials' results have contributed to this thinking, including: Merck's trial of indinavir/AZT/3TC in AZT-experienced individuals; Abbott's trial of ritonavir/AZT/ddC in treatment-naive individuals. Also a basis for this most aggressive approach to treatment is the Boehringer Ingelheim 1046 study of treatment-naive individuals, which was only recently (June 7) publicly presented (see <a href="nevir.html">Nevirapine article</a>; 80% of the individuals in the group receiving the 3-drug combination of AZT/ddI and nevirapine had their viral load rendered "undetectable" (which in this case was below 200 RNA copies/ml--as measured by PCR); additionally, there is some follow-up out to 18 months where some individuals are still undetectable. In addition, treatment of a small number newborns with potent 3-drug therapy has resulted in similar results. However, it may be advisable to be circumspect about this new information (see discussion below).</p>

<p>There are some differences of opinion about which viral load level is low enough, is it under 25, 100, 200, 5,000 or 10,000? Despite the preliminary results from the pilot studies that are discussed below, researchers need to conduct further studies to confirm which viral load levels should be targeted with therapy. If your viral load is 5,000, should you initiate protease inhibitor therapy now or should you wait? The answer to this question is more clear if your viral load is over 20,000; and, becomes more clear the higher one's viral load climbs; the IAS interim guidelines (discussed below) recommend driving one's viral load as low as possible or to "undetectable levels"; while Dr. Coombs is not convinced that is necessary, for him 5,000 may be acceptable.</p>

<p>This relates directly to the question--when should an individual initiate therapy, and with which drugs?? If your viral load is 5,000, should you initiate protease inhibitor (or nevirapine) therapy now or should you wait? The IAS guidelines described below recommend initiating therapy if your viral load is above 5-10,000 and your CD4 status suggests progression. In light of the new data revealed in Vancouver, the authors of the IAS guidelines may or may not revise their recommendations. I think that for doctors and their patients, there will be no clear recommendations forthcoming, because the interpretation of this data will probably remain controversial for a good while.</p>

<p>The subject of cross-resistance between protease inhibitors is relevant to this discussion. Will treatment with a particular protease inhibitor cause any or significant cross-resistance to another protease inhibitor? We do not yet adequately understand the cross-resistance relationships between different protease inhibitors. If your viral load is relatively low, by waiting until we better understand cross-resistance between protease inhibitors, you may be better able to optimize your results from therapy. But, we may not have information for a good while (1 year maybe), that is adequate to understand cross-resistance sufficiently to answer these questions (see <a href="vanc.html">Pre-Vancouver Protease Inhibitor Update</a> for a discussion of ACTG 333, the first study of protease cross-resistance). Also, there are many individual and theoretical factors that can be considered in making these decisions. Does one want to use the best available therapy early in their disease stage, rather than save it for later? The aggressive treaters say yes, and some of the underpinning for their thinking is discussed below. They say, there will be other therapies available. Other treaters are more cautious about spending options. The answers to many of these questions are not yet clear.</p>

<p>The 2 studies presented in Vancouver are ongoing small pilot trials meant to test specific hypothesis'. Twelve therapy-naive individuals were recruited who were chronically infected (HIV+ for a while with some progression), and were treated with open-label nelfinavir (750 mg 3x/day) and AZT/3TC. In the 2nd study, 12 individuals who had recently sero-converted were recruited and treated with open-label ritonavir/AZT/3TC. The principal investigators of both studies, David Ho and Martin Markowitz of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York City, wanted to explore the extent to which these therapies in these populations could turn off viral replication and the longer-term implications of that. In the sero-converter, trial the investigators also wanted to explore the possibility of "eradicating" HIV-1 in a recently infected person with a relatively intact immune system. </p>

<p>In Vancouver, only 4 months of data was available for presentation for the treatment-naive, chronically infected group treated with nelfinavir/AZT/3TC; and, the data so far available and presented in Vancouver, for the sero-converter study of ritonavir/AZT/3TC, extends only to between 4 and 10 months for the study subjects. Again, all study subjects, in both trials, remaining on therapy had their viral load rendered "undetectable."</p>

<p>The meaning and interpretation of these study results, and their potential application has created much controversy in the AIDS research and medical community. Many feel it is pre-mature to draw strong conclusions from these preliminary results; and that it is pre-mature to begin treating sero-converters and treatment-naive individuals in this way, i.e. "hit hard and early" with the most potent therapy at the earliest possible time of intervention. However, some researchers disagree and expressed that we should treat individuals with this "hit hard and early" approach to therapy.</p>

<p>The potential benefits of a potent 3 or 4 drug therapy may be different for individuals who have extensive prior drug experience with nucleosides (AZT, ddI, ddC, 3TC, d4T). These individuals may not be as responsive as those who are treatment-naive, and of course as those who are recently infected. If you merely add a protease inhibitor to other drugs you have been taking for a while, you may not be able to reduce your viral load to undetectable; or, if you are able to reduce it to undetectable, it may not be as likely to remain at that level and it could begin to rebound. For this group of individuals, the set of issues are considerably different, more difficult and cannot be bunched together in a discussion with treatment-naive or newly infected. However, there are promising treatment approaches that can be utilized by this group. Protease inhibitors now in human trials that are not yet approved are Agouron's <a href="nelf.html">nelfinavir</a> and Glaxo Wellcome's141W94; as well, Glaxo Wellcome's <a href="u89.html">1592U89</a> is a potent NRTI (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) which is also in early human trials. There are real prospects for sequencing from one of the currently approved protease inhibitors onto a different one after they become available. Other antiretroviral drugs are in either available or in human studies, including DMP-266 (NNRTI), nevirapine, (NNRTI), and delavirdine (NNRTI), which will be useful in designing treatment strategies for those who are drug-experienced. I am just concerned that all the attention appears to me to be focused on the treatment-naive and newly infected populations without adequate attention to those who are treatment-experienced. </p>

<p>Clearly, there are many remaining questions: how durable will the responses be of the individuals in the 2 aforementioned studies (treatment-naive and newly infected)? What will the findings be of residual virus in other "compartments"--CSF, lymph nodes, testes, etc.? Only a small number of individuals (24) were studied, what follow-up studies do we need? Individuals with advanced HIV (low CD4s) may not respond as well to treatment as those who are seroconverters or treatment-naive. What treatment strategies will be best for individuals with moderate or advanced disease who may have exhausted most if not all previously available treatment options? How will protease inhibitor cross-resistance effect treatment strategies for all of these different types of individuals?</p>

<p>A number of discussions are onging to devise future studies to address some of these remaining questions. Studies are being planned for individuals with greater than 500 CD4. Four-drug combination studies are being planned, to begin shortly, for treatment-naive and possibly for treatment-experienced individuals. One proposal currently under discussion is devising a study to allow individuals to begin stopping part or all of their therapy after being "undetectable" for a prolonged period of time, to see if they remain undetectable. Other unique approaches to study design are being discussed and planned. </p>

<h4><a name="paradigm">Cautious</a> approach to "new paradigm".</h4>

<p>It is very exciting that we can suppress virus to "undetectable" levels, and that viral levels can remain undetectable for a prolonged period, but there are reasons to consider for not rushing too quickly to accepting these new approaches to treatment of HIV, i.e. "hit hard and early" in primary infection, with treatment-naive individuals and with all others as well. It may be premature to design a new approach to treatment of HIV based on such a small body of research. Some observers say, a potential problem could be-- how long will viral load stay undetectable for some individuals, and what options remain for those individuals if and when their viral load rises? Dr. Coombs contends that these approaches, such as treating acute infection or early intervention (individuals with "higher" CD4), and using 4-drug combinations are promising theories, that need to be adequately researched before we put too much stock into them. Without more extensive studies of treatment intervention in primary (new) infection and treatment-naive individuals, doctors may not be willing to utilize such approaches to treatment. However, it may be helpful for you and your doctor to be informed and educated about these issues, and to discuss treatment strategies with a knowledgeable physician(s).</p>

<p>A challenge of a different sort is compliance with adhering to the regimens for taking protease inhibitor drugs in 3- or 4-drug combinations (i.e., taking the fully recommended doses, at all recommended times, and not taking reduced doses or missing doses---non-compliance can cause resistance). This challenge may be a formidable one, as many individuals are already non-compliant. If a large body of people are not compliant, we could end up with a large pool of protease inhibitor resistant people, which could be transmissable. For individuals with early disease and no signs of sickness, will they be compliant with the rigorous demands of taking 3 or 4-drug protease inhibitor therapy? Of course, this shouldn't deter researchers and doctors from recommending the utilization of protease inhibitors and multi-drug combinations in the way that will optimize benefits for individuals that will be compliant. It is the responsibility of society to devise a strategy for dealing with non-compliance: the drug companies, federal public health and research officials, the medical community, and the "activist" community. </p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, one of the newly suggested approaches to HIV treatment is, if an individual remains "undetectable" (below the level of detection by laboratory RNA tests capable of measuring as low as 10 RNA copies, or is under 100 or 200 copies adeaquate?) for 18 months or 2 years, can that individual begin to stop taking 1, 2 or all of the medications he was taking? Is that person's virus "eradicated"? Will their virus remain in "remission"? HIV may be present in a number of "compartments" in the body besides the blood. </p>

<p>The belief that the virus can be "eradicated" or that lowering viral load to "undetectable" may not be true, if the virus and its replication is driven by the "reservoir" hidden in these compartments. Does protease inhibitor or nevirapine therapy accompanied by 2 or 3 additional drugs affect the virus hidden in these compartments? Or, will this hidden virus emerge after an individual may begin to stop taking 1 or 2 drugs of their combination therapy? And of course, there is the possibility that virus can be driven from these other "compartments. Continuing studies are necessary to explore this unknown. </p>

<p>Despite these difficult questions and obstacles, it is important to remember we are in fact entering into a new and exciting era for the treatment of HIV. Never before have we been in a position to ask some of these questions---such as, can we "eradicate HIV from an infected person? But, we need to remain circumspect, to encourage continuing research to address the unanswered questions, and not to allow ourselves to become overconfident or complacent.</p>

<p>It may be however important to better understand the thinking of those who are supporting the notion of being aggressive with new approaches to HIV treatment. Aside from the early new data from these pilot trials, a reason some experts recommend "hit hard and hit early" is, because the earlier it is in an individuals disease progression, their virus has not had as much opportunity to replicate and therefore mutate. The virus will tend to be more homogenous; the contention is that a homogenous (the virus hasn't had ample opportunity yet to mutate very much) virus is more receptive to treatment and less likely to develop resistance to the treatment as quickly as an individual's virus that is more heterogenous from replication and mutation.</p>

<p>Additionally, it is widely accepted that disease progression and consequent sickness and death is a result of a depleted immune system. Presumably, the earlier treatment begins, the more intact an individuals immune system will be at the start of therapy; and, hopefully therapy will maintain the healthy status of the immune system, or at least maintain it for a longer period of time. </p>

<p>This thinking is at least partially based on the recent research developments from David Ho, George Shaw and others. Prior thinking was that there was a prolonged period of relative virus latency; this has been replaced with the thinking that ongoing, high-level viral replication takes place from the time of initial infection. This research says, as many as 10 billion new HIV virions are produced per day, with a half-life in plasma of 6 hours. CD4 cells, a principle target for the virus responsible for viral replication, are also produced in high number, and once productively infected, have a half-life of 1.6 days. The life-cycle of the virus, from infection of one cell to the production of new progeny, which infects the next cell, is 2.6 days. </p>

<p>Additionally, prior to now the only available drugs for treatment of HIV were of very moderate benefit (AZT, ddI, etc.). Now, we have much more potent drugs-- protease inhibitors, nevirapine--with which to treat HIV, and we've found that resistance can be suppressed for a prolonged period of time by utilizing a protease inhibitor or nevirapine as part of a potent 3-drug combination; also, we now have available the viral load test by which to measure antiviral activity. Of course, researchers are as yet uncertain of the durability of the suppression of virus resulting from potent 3-drug therapy. </p>

<p>Some of these experts are comparing treatment of HIV with treatment of cancer and tuberculosis, by saying the traditional or the classic approach to treatment of cancer and TB is to hit "early and hard" with combination therapy. However, can it be compared to cancer and TB? Again, they postulate, that if treated early enough in the disease with potent therapy, an individual may be better able to, in a sense, put the virus in remission; that is, lower the viral load to an adequately "undetectable" level (undetectable does not mean virus isn't present--how low is enough?), which will hopefully stop viral replication and prevent the emergence of resistance; or, possibly "eradicate" the virus from the blood or the system. The objections to pre-maturely accepting this thinking are outlined above; it may be advisable to remain at once excited, skeptical and circumspect until we have more data from studies implemented to explore and confirm these new approaches to treating HIV.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the ACTG 175, Upjohn and MACS research, discussed above, appear to indicate that reductions in viral load can alter the course of clinical progression. Although, reductions in RNA were mostly modest in the 175 and Upjohn studies, the drug therapies used in the study did not include any protease inhibitors. In the group with over 1 million viral load, a 1 log or greater reduction in RNA produced the most benefit to clinical progression, when compared to individuals, in the other groups with less viral load reductions. As you know, successful protease inhibitor therapy, which utilizes effective multi-drug combinations, has produced in some instances, significantly more than 1 log decreases in viral load. Importantly, still to be confirmed, is the durability of these reductions in viral load.] <i>end of commentary</i></p>

<h4><a name="effects">Treatment</a> effects are not totally explained by CD4 and RNA.</h4>

Dr. Coombs displayed a graph of data from Bill O'Brien's VA study (O'Brien 
et al, NEJM 1995) which indicated that individuals with both an increase in CD4 and a reduction in viral load clinically progressed more slowly than individuals who had neither and individuals who had only a CD4 increase or a viral load reduction. Dr. Coombs said, that looking at combinations of responses to drugs, both immunologic (CD4) and virologic (RNA) markers are more beneficial than looking at one or the other alone. The data from the Upjohn studies support CD4 and viral load together are more predictive. </p>

<p>He went on to say, we still have a lot to learn about what exactly are the factors that define the treatment effect. At the moment, we are trying to understand how much of the treatment effect can be explained by changes in RNA and/or CD4, and it's clear that even together they explain only part of it, but not all of it. Other studies have illustrated that other factors are relevant, such as properties of the virus and other additional properties of the host, that are extremely important in defining the types of response that individuals will experience from changes in viral load alone. So, it is much more complicated than we are currently appreciating, to better understand an individual's response to treatment. At the moment, we are left with more simple markers of the disease, for example CD4 and viral load, to help make clinical decisions about what does or doesn't constitutes effective therapy. In future clinical studies, it would be helpful if we are able to factor in other properties or disease markers.</p>

<h4><a name="guide">Guidelines</a> for using viral load testing and interpreting measurements.</h4>

<p>The discussion so far by Dr. Coombs is helpful in placing into better context the following part of his discussion. The International AIDS Society (IAS) convened a USA advisory panel, who, after careful deliberation, have assembled a list of interim recommendations related to viral load measurement and the use of test results. The panel consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Michael Saag, MD, University of Alabama-Birmingham 
<li>Mark Holodney, MD, Stanford University 
<li>William A. O'Brien, MD, UC-Los Angeles 
<li>Robert W. Coombs, MD, PhD, University of Washington 
<li>Margaret E. Poscher, MD, UC-San Francisco 
<li>Donna M. Jacobson, BS, IAIDS Society-USA 
<li>George M. Shaw MD, PhD, University of Alabama-Birmingham 
<li>Douglas D. Richman, MD, UC-San Diego 
<li>Paul A. Volberding, MD, UC-San Francisco 
<li>Daniel R. Kuritzkes, MD, University of Colorado
</ul>

<p>In fact, these recommendations have just been published (Nature Medicine, volume 2, number 6, June 1996). The recommendations are characterized as interim, because more information is important to better understanding how to use the tests, the meaning and interpretation of test results, and how to better apply these results. Currently, individuals and their doctors are utilizing the test and its results in managing HIV, and in fact it is widely believed that proper use of the test and its results can be helpful in clinical practice. These recommendations are intended to provide helpful guidelines for patients and doctors.</p>

<p>The following questions are addressed by the recommendations:

<ol>
<li>Where to initiate therapy?
<li>What target level of HIV RNA should we look for after initiating therapy?
<li>What is the minimum decrease in HIV RNA indicative of antiviral activity and hopefully efficacy of the drug or therapy?
<li>What is the change in RNA level that suggests drug treatment failure?
<li>How frequently should we monitor RNA?
<li>What are the optimum methods of specimen processing?
</ol>

<p>With each IAS recommendation, Dr. Coombs has added his own editorial, sometimes differing with the recommendation.</p>

<p>(1) Where to initiate therapy?<br>
panel recommendation: More than between 5,000-10,000;

<p>Dr. Coombs-- editorialized that 5-10,000 applies when using the bDNA test, but if using RT-PCR, he recommends greater than 20,000, because from his experience the RT-PCR can run twice as high as bDNA. </p>

<p>----The panel strongly encourages therapy at greater than 25,000; Dr. Coombs says 25,000 by bDNA and 50,000 by RT-PCR. In clinical and natural history studies reported to date, some people with higher than 25,000 (bDNA) or 50,000 (PCR) are in the group associated with higher disease progression rates.</p>

<p>Dr. Coombs: Although RT-PCR and bDNA correlate well in their results, there are no common RNA assay standards; therefore, values from the bDNA assay cannot be readily translated into values from the RT-PCR assay. One common recommendation is if you are being monitored by one assay type, you should continue using it, and not switch from one assay to another, until we have common assay standards.</p>

<p>(2) Target level of RNA after initiating therapy</p>

<p>The panel recommends--"undetectable levels of plasma HIV RNA should be sought... under 5,000 would be acceptable." (Dr. Coombs says--5,000 by bDNA is the equivalent of 10,000 by RT-PCR). Panel: "It has not been shown whether plasma HIV RNA reduced to a particular level by antiretroviral therapy carries the same risk of clinical progression as that same HIV RNA level without antiretroviral therapy" having been used. "Prospective clinical trials are urgently needed to address this question."</p>

<p>Dr. Coombs: Under 10,000 (bDNA) or 20,000 (RT-PCR) RNA copies is probably a reasonable target, based on that individuals with these measures appear to have a very slow clinical progression rate. We don't yet know how much benefit accrues from driving the viral load much lower. Since this is a slow progressing group, establishing the clinical benefit to them from a log or more change, will take some time to sort out.</p>

<p><b>[Commentary</b>: Dr. Coombs' approach is cautionary. But, more information to better understand if it is beneficial to lower one's viral load to 500 rather than 4,000 would be helpful. Or more to the point of the discussion, is there a difference between 10,000 and 5,000? Dr. Coombs' earlier discussion of the cost/benefit ratio of therapy decisions is applicable to this situation.]</p>

<p> <b>[commentary</b>: MACS--correlation of viral load measurement with clinical progression. At this time, the subject of viral load has taken center stage, as the FDA recently reviewed and approved Roche's application for their RNA test. An article has just been published, "Prognosis in HIV-1 Infection Predicted by the Quantity of Virus in Plasma," (Mellors et al, Science, vol 272, 24 May 1996). It is fitting to mention here some results, because the study (the Pittsburgh portion of the MACS trial), which this article is about, offers data about clinical progression to AIDS and survival for groups of individuals with viral load under 4,430, of between 4,531 and 13,020, and over 13, 021. Above, Dr. Coombs refers to the lack of data regarding the benefit of driving viral load much below 10,000--- is there a benefit to lowering viral load from 4,000 to 500? What is the cost/benefit ratio? Data from this retrospective study is related this discussion. </p>

<p>One hundred and eighty seropositive study participants enrolled in MACS in 1984 and 1985. Their blood specimens were taken at study entry and every 6 months and stored. RNA measures were taken and analyzed retrospectively, from the stored samples. Individuals were followed for progression to AIDS (1987 CDC definition) and death. Based on their retrospective baseline RNA value, individuals were divided into the following ranges of RNA: under 4,530; 4,531-13,020; 13,021-36,270; over 36,271. For this analysis, HIV-1 RNA was measured by the new 2nd generation bDNA assay; the 1st assay upon which the first MACS data analysis was based (discussed earlier in this article) is limited, in that it measures down to 10,000 RNA copies; this 2nd generation assay is more sensitive, as it measures as low as 500 copies. Since, we are discussing whether it may be beneficial to reduce one's viral load from 10,000 to 5,000 or lower, the data from this study has some relevance. </p>

<p>It is in context to quote from the Nature Medicine article--"Higher HIV RNA levels correlate with lower baseline CD4 counts, more rapid declines in CD4 counts, and more rapid disease progression....maintenance of plasma HIV RNA levels below 10,000 in early HIV disease appears to be associated with decreased risk of progression to AIDS. However, in patients with more advanced disease (median CD4 counts, 89/ul), disease progression occurred in up to 30% of patients with fewer than 10,000 HIV RNA copies/ml." -----The cost/benefit ratio concept is importantly relevant to this last sentence. If individuals with lower CD4 counts have more potential to progress in the under 10,000 copy range, than those with higher CD4 counts but also with under 10,000 RNA, then this may dictate a different and more aggressive approach (for individuals with lower CD4 and under 10,000 RNA) to the question---when should an individual initiate or change therapy?</p>

<p>***"For the 4 groups, ranging from the lowest through the highest viral load, the proportion of subjects who progressed to AIDS by 5 years after study entry were 8, 26, 49 and 62%. The median times to development of AIDS for subjects in these 4 groups were greater than 10, 7.7, 5.3, and 3.5 years. (Remember, the data collection was only out to 10 years). For the 4 groups, ranging from the lowest through the highest viral load, the proportions of subjects who died within 5 years were 5, 10, 25 and 49%. The median estimated survival times in these 4 groups, ranging from the lowest viral load to the highest were, greater than 10, 9.5, 7.4 and 5.1". These results are mostly independent of CD4 values.***</p>

<p>Although it is not clearly defined, you may be able to infer, from these study results, that lowering viral load from 13,021 to under 4,530 may have value. However, if you factor in the cost/benefit ratio considerations, the value of such a reduction in RNA is more complicated to determine.] <i>end of commentary.</i></p>

<p>(3) Minimal decrease in HIV RNA indicative of antiviral activity and hopefully efficacy</p>

<P>Panel recommends: at least a 0.5 log reduction that is sustained (3-fold or greater), based on our understanding of factors affecting variability (biological and within-assay variability). "It is likely that the clinical benefits of antiretroviral therapy are related to the duration as well as to the magnitude of HIV suppression...., although the precise duration of HIV suppression necessary to result in measurable clinical benefits still needs to be clearly defined." </p>

<p>Dr. Coombs: Sustained decreases of as little as 2-fold, in clinical studies, have been associated with clinical benefit. Just looking at the amount of RNA reduction (0.5) may not be adequate to judge the prospect of clinical benefit. As discussed earlier, a 1 log decrease for an individual with a viral load of 1 million copies may be more beneficial, to that individual, than a 1 log reduction for an individual with 20,000 RNA copies. For example, a 1 log reduction for an individual with 1 million RNA copies will lower his viral load to 100,000 copies, and 1 log reduction for an individual with 20,000 RNA copies will lower their viral load to 2,000 RNA copies.</p>

<p>(4) Change in HIV RNA that suggests drug treatment failure</p>

<p>Panel: "The return of HIV RNA levels to pre-treatment (or to within 0.3-0.5 log of the pre-treatment value) values, confirmed by at least two measurements, is indicative of drug failure and should prompt considerations of alternative treatment regimens".</p>

<p>Dr. Coombs: A return to baseline is probably an indication that the viral load is no longer reflecting antiviral activity. Again, this change is very dependent on starting RNA level. For example, a return to baseline, if baseline is less than 10,000 (bDNA) or 20,000 (RT-PCR) may not be so bad, and addresses the issue of the cost/benefit ratio of driving viral load lower, without evidence of clinical benefit, which we urgently need to obtain.</p>

<p>(5) Suggested frequency of HIV RNA measurement</p>

<p>Panel: At baseline: 2 measurements, 2 to 4 weeks apart to assess the inherent variability. Subsequently, measurements might be obtained along with the CD4 count every 3 to 4 months, since serial determination of both markers simultaneously provide useful information. Shorter intervals may be appropriate as critical decision points--such as the return of the viral load to baseline values--are approached. RNA levels should be measured 3-4 weeks after initiating or changing therapy to determine antiviral activity, before waiting to see if the CD4 count reflects a change.</p>

<p>(6) Optimal methods of specimen processing</p>

<p>Panel: Optimal procedures for storage, handling, and processing samples have yet to be fully defined. Each provider should adopt consistent procedures for handling specimens, including using the same collection tube and anticoagulant, processing techniques, transport and storage procedures. To minimize HIV RNA degradation, all plasma specimens should be separated and frozen within 6 hours of collection. If this approach is not possible, the plasma should be removed and refrigerated. Less desirably, the whole blood could be refrigerated, but not for more than 24 hours before separation and freezing are completed. Consistent use of the same assay in an individual patient is very important.</p>

<p>Dr. Coombs: Use the recommended anticoagulant, as it varies, depending on which assay you are using. Prompt processing and freezing of the specimen within 2-4 hours, or at least within 6 hours of phlebotomy. </p>

<p><b>Conclusion by Dr. Coombs at the forum</b>: In the long term, only carefully controlled trials will prove to us the utility of HIV RNA measurement for routine clinical management of HIV-1 infected individuals. Many vital questions remain to be addressed for us to understand how to best utilize the new potent therapies; drug companies, our federal government and academic researchers must be held accountable for properly conducting exhaustive research until we have the answers we need. </p>

<p>In this discussion, varying points of view on different issues are presented for the purpose of objectivity and to convey a better understanding of the issues. In the end, the intent of this paper is to assist individuals and medical care providers in making more informed treatment decisions.</p>

<h3>NIH Panel to Define Principles of Therapy of HIV Infection: proceedings of Nov. 13-14 panel meeting in Washington, D.C.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>This is Jules Levin reporting from my Delta shuttle leaving Washington, D.C. on Nov 14 after attending the two-day meeting called the "NIH Panel to Define Principles of Therapy of HIV Infection". A series of about 30 AIDS academic researchers, practitioners and pharmaceutical industry researchers were invited to present information on a variety of related subjects. Researchers presented the latest data for approved drugs and those in development. This panel was convened to issue a set of guiding principles, or commonly called a "standard of care" for the treatment of individuals with HIV or AIDS. Doctors and HIV+ individuals will look to these principles for guidance. Two separate government sponsored initiatives may be undertaking a similar effort in the next several months.

<p> At this meeting, discussion essentially focused on: when to start treatment, what to start treatment with, when and with what therapy to transition into after prior therapy. We do not yet know enough information or data to make many definitive recommendations, but this panel was convened to review the data and information available and attempt to issue helpful guidelines. It remains to be seen how instructive and guiding the guidelines will be.

<p><strong> <a name=aa> Plasma, CSF and lymph tissue RNA. </a></strong>The first day's hearing started with Dr. David Ho reviewing the findings of his work and that of others regarding HIV replication dynamics. As you may know (you can read about on NATAP web site--"Perspectives on Viral Load......."), prior thinking was that there was a prolonged period of relative virus latency; this has been replaced with the thinking that ongoing, high-level viral replication takes place from the time of initial infection. As many as 10 billion new HIV virions are produced per day.

<p> Dr. Ashley Haase, of the University of Minnesota, said you can measure the number of infected cells in lymphoid tissue, as well as the number of CD4 cells in lymph tissue. 1% of the body and its organs is composed of lymph tissue, but it is an important depository, reservoir and source of HIV for the peripheral circulation. The lymph node RNA data presented in Birmingham (see NATAP Birmingham Report 2) for the ritonavir/AZT/3TC study used a tonsillar biopsy to obtain lymph tissue. Haase said the tonsil is reasonably representative and easier to work with on an outpatient basis. Question has been raised about whether or not the methodolgy used in this study will yield the full extent of information that we can obtained from other methodolgy.

<p> We are still uncertain of the full effect of potent 3-drug therapy on the lymph tissue viral reservoir, even in individuals treated during primary infection (immediately after infection). Ongoing and planned research will address this concern.

<p> We have not yet adequately addressed the effect of potent 3 or 4 drug antivretroviral therapy on the CSF, brain and other potentially relevant compartments. The protease inhibitors so far available don't appear to penetrate the brain well. Studies exploring this are planned. There appear to be mixed opinions about the ability to adequately effect the CSF and the brain by the potent 3-drug protease inhibitor therapies.

<p> Dr. Lisa Dunkle, of Bristol-Myers, said at steady-state, CSF concentration of d4T was 16-72% of serum concentration (blood levels) 2 hours after dosing.

<p> In Birmingham, it was stressed that a neuro-protective drug should be a component of a multi-drug combination therapy. There is data confirming AZT's effectiveness on neuroloigcal HIV-associated problems. For those who may be AZT-resistant, it is uncertain whether or not AZT may remain effective for such purposes; resistance in the brain may develop more slowly than in the blood. Although, such efficacy data for d4T is lacking, there appears to be some agreement that d4T should be effective since it does penetrate the CSF. CSF fluid does enter into the brain.

<p><strong> <a name=bb> Re-constitution of the immune system. </aa></strong> Dr. Ronald Gress, of the NIH, said non-thymic generation of CD4 that comes from the periphery lacks the ability to regenerate naive CD4. Age may correlate with the ability to regenerate naive CD4. The potential of the thymus to regenerate naive CD4 is better for children and decreases with age. My report from the Surrogate Marker conference of November 18-19, where Dr. Mario Roederer spoke on this issue, will further discuss and explain this concern.

<p> At best, there were mixed opinions about the ability of the immune system to reconstitute itself. It appears it will be difficult to reconstitute the immune system. It was generally agreed that the best opportunity to reconstitute the immune system was with the earliest possible treatment with potent therapy--hitting hard and early. The earlier you are in the disease stage, the more intact is your immune system; you have more naive CD4 and a wider repertoire of CD4; treatment during primary infection may be the most effective on virus burden in lymph tissue. In late stage disease, antiviral activity of CD8 is lost.

<p> Of course, there are problems associated with taking treatments so early, including: healthy individuals may not be compliant; if therapy is not successful and resistance develops, treatment options may be limited due to cross-resistance; insurance re-imbursement may be a concern; compliance may be difficult, if it is necessary to maintain treatment for many years. However, studies are expected to start soon exploring induction therapy of indinavir/AZT/3TC followed by a maintanance therapy of 0, 1 or 2 drugs.

<p> The standard of care recommendations emanating from this NIH-OAR (Office of AIDS Research) effort should fully explain all these options to doctors without prejudice.

<p> Dr. Anthony Kelleher, of Australia, was a ritonavir study investigator. He said if you can suppress viral load low enough for a long enough period of time, there may be some immune system repair, which could get around the loss of repertoire; the evidence seems to argue against that increases in CD4 are just a redistribution of CD4, although Mario Roederer thinks they are due to re-distribution.. In Dr. Kelleher's research, he has found memory cells to increase as you see increases in absolute numbers of CD4. He agreed with others that therapy should start early.

<p> <strong> <a name=cc> Double nucleoside therapy in primary infection. </a></strong> Dr. Luc Perrin, of Switzerland, discussed a small study of treatment with AZT/ddI for individuals in primary infection. After 6 months of therapy, 8/12 had undetectable plasma RNA (under 200 copies/ml); after 12 months 8/12 remained undetectable. During the period of 7-10 months, lymph node biopsies were conducted on 5 patients; 4/5 were negative for RNA (in situ). Dr. Perrin agreed therapy should begin as early as possible. But he suggested you could begin therapy with a nucleoside regimen; Dr. Julio Montaner, the principal investigator of the nevirapine/AZT/3TC-naive study #1046, suggested starting with a nevirapine 3-drug regimen.

<p> Dr. Martin Markowitz, of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in NYC, said double nucleoside therapy for those with chronic infection (those with at least some disease progression), was not adequate. He said, only 8/12 were rendered undetectable in the AZT/ddI study. In other words, if your goal is to fully suppress viral load, you take the risk that the double nucleoside therapy may not be successful for all. As reported in the NATAP Birmingham Reports, Drs. Richman, Lange and Emini agreed that treatment with the most potent available therapy should start as early as possible. (see NATAP Birmingham Reports for details).

<p> <strong> <a name=dd> Early vs. late. </a></strong> In the NATAP Birmingham Reports 1 and 2, I reported that Dr. Joep Lange said he would treat individuals with the most potent therapy if they had any viral load, even 100 copies. At this NIH conference, Dr. John Mellors, of the University of Pittsburgh, and some others said it may not be necessary for early intervention for some individuals. They suggested if an individual presents themselves with high CD4 and low viral load (under 5,000), you could monitor them, and delay treatment if the values remain stable.

<p> Dr. Alvaro Munoz, of Johns Hopkins University, discussed some data from the MACS study which correlated baseline viral load with disease progression (see NATAP article "Perspectives on Viral Load"). The initial blood samples for this study were taken over 10 years ago; because of blood processing and storage problems, the following RNA values are about one-half of their true estimate. Of 53 individuals who showed no disease progression, there average RNA value at baseline was 2,071 copies/ml; this group was divided into 2 sub-groups: the non-progressors had an average of 1,627 RNA copies; and, the late progressors averaged 5,049 copies. The 55 moderate decliners had an average RNA copy number of 3,791; and, the 55 fast decliners had an average of 12,720 copies.

<p> <strong> <a name=ee> Protease inhibitor failure and cross-resistance. </a></strong> Ronald Swanstrom, Ph. D. of the University of North Carolina, showed a slide of two individuals who failed ritonavir therapy at different time points and added saquinavir to the ritonavir therapy. The first person added saquinavir after failing ritonavir at 25 weeks of therapy, and their RNA remained suppressed. The other person failed ritonavir after 70 weeks and then added saquinavir; their viral load initially went down but rebounded relatively quickly.

<p> The fact that a number of individuals are already protease inhibitor resistant was discussed. As yet, it is uncertain how to treat someone who may be resistant to ritonavir or indinavir. Dr. Bob Anderson, of Agouron Pharmaceuticals, discussed their study #522, where they are collecting viral blood samples from individuals resistant to protease inhibitors other than nelfinavir. They are subjecting these resistant viruses to nelfinavir in vitro. Agouron has previously reported preliminary findings that treating first with nelfinavir may not produce cross-resistance to other protease inhibitors. Study #522 is intended to explore if nelfinavir may be effective in suppressing virus that is already resistant to other protease inhibitors. Preliminary results may be available in early 1997. Availability to nelfinavir in the expanded access program is restricted to individuals who've failed other protease inhibitors. Hopefully, some data will emerge from the expanded access program..

<p> A number of physicians are treating protease inhibitor-resistant individuals with the combination of ritonavir+saquinavir. The benefits of treatment with this combination could be due to the high levels of saquinavir. It could be that the antiviral activity of this combination is from the higher blood levels of saquinavir alone.

<p> Some participants from the early indinavir trials who rendered their viral load to undetectable have had their viral load rebound, but their CD4 has remained elevated. Without viable alternative treatments to switch to, many are remaining on indinavir therapy. There is speculation that the CD4 remain elevated because the resistant or mutant virus is less virulent, defective, or not as fit for replication. It is not yet well understood why this occurs.

<p> If using saquinavir in combination with nucleosides, and resistance to saquinavir develops, you may have success treating with ritonavir, indinavir or ritonavir/saquinavir. Merck says pre-treatment with saquinavir, with or without the development of saquinavir resistance, is likely to cause the premature development of resistance to indinavir. Roche claims the chances of that are less likely.

<p> Noel Roberts, PhD of Roche Labs, presented the following cross-resistance data. Cross-resistance was defined as a 4-fold loss of sensitivity to another protease inhibitor. After 1 year of saquinavir treatment with nucleosides: 86% remained fully sensitive to saquinavir; 10/12 have complete or some remaining sensitivity to other protease inhibitors; 5.25% have some reduced sensitivity to all protease inhibitors; 3.5% have reduced sensitivity to all other protease inhibitors.

<p> For individuals who in fact developed the L90M mutation from saquinavir treatment, 5/9 were saquinavir resistant, 2/9 were indinavir resistant, 2/9 were ritonavir resistant and 2/9 were VX-478 resistant. It is rare to develop the G48V mutation along with the 90 mutation, but for those who did--3/3 were saquinavir resistant, 2/3 were indinavir resistant, 3/3 were ritonavir resistant and 0/3 were VX-478 resistant. Roche says other mutations occur besides those at 48 and 90, but they are not significant in leading to saquinavir resistance nor indinavir cross-resistance; Merck disagrees, they claim the saquinavir mutation profile, including these other additional mutations, will contribute to reduced sensitivity to subsequent indinavir treatment. More conclusive information may be expected from data of individuals who have been indeed treated with saquinavir and then switched to indinavir. ACTG 333 was the first sudy designed to address this issue. Some preliminary results should be available in early 1997.

<p> A question was raised about whether resistance develops more easily from the use of a potent protease inhibitor than from use of a NRTI. Emilio Emini, of Merck, said the protease inhibitor exerts more pressure on the protease enzyme than a NRTI exerts on the reverse-transcriptase enzyme. Therefore, resistance by the protease enzyme is likely to develop more easily.

<p> <strong> <a name=ff> Saquinavir absorption and eating. </a></strong> If an individual is taking saquinavir in combination with nucleosides, eating an adequate meal prior to taking saquinavir is required for proper absorption of saquinavir. According to the saquinavir package insert a large fatty meal is recommended for maximal absorption. When ritonavir is used in combination with saquinavir, the blood levels of saquinavir are greatly increased. That is the reason for combining the two drugs. An important question is, do you still need to eat before taking your medication of saquinavir with ritonavir, and if so how much? Roche says they are now researching this question, but for now they recommend eating an "adequate" meal before taking the two protease inhibitors. In fact, although Abbott says it's not absolutely necessary, a sandwich sized meal is recommended prior to taking ritonavir medication, also for absorption.

<p> <strong> <a name=gg> New sero-converter update. </a></strong> Dr. Martin Markowitz presented some additional data since the Vancouver presentations, on the small pilot studies of sero-converters. For the ritonavir/AZT/3TC study of sero-converters, in Vancouver data was presented for 1 patient out to 10 months, 3 patients out to 4 months and 1 patient each out to 8, 7 and 6 months (see NATAP article "Newly Infected Individuals: ritonavir/AZT/3TC", in the post-Vancouver drug development section). All patients in the study had undetectable viral load (plasma HIV RNA) by these time points.

<p> Dr. Markowitz explained how at baseline there was a variety of viral load values: one individual had a 5 million RNA value, another's was 1 million, and a third person had a 20,000 RNA copy number. He presented here that 10/11 study patients were at least out to 7 months and remained undetectable. One patient's RNA was 140 copies at 9 months. Six patients were out to 10 months and were still undetectable. Four patients were out to 12 months and still undetectable; and, 1 patient was out to 15 months and undetectable.

<p> Twelve sero-converters were receiving treatment with indinavir/AZT/3TC in a separate pilot study. All patients were between 3 to 8 months on study treatment and all but one was under 100 RNA copies. That one patient had a value of 291 copies. All 12 were culture negative. Investigators expect to conduct rectal lymph tissue biopsies, because it's difficult to get consent for lymph node biopsies; for those remaing undetectable, they will be asked if they're willing to discontinue treatment; future studies are planned where they might increase viral turnover with therapy. Treatment during primary or acute infection may be the most effective therapy, and may offer the best hope of eradication. Some researchers do not believe eradication is possible with the currently available therapies; several researchers expressed here that early treatment with a protease inhibitor therapy may jeopardize adequate future treatment options.

<p> <strong> <a name=hh> Recommendations. </a></strong> Clearly, there is a diversity of opinions regarding when to initiate therapy and with what. There are some who feel strongly that the best approach is to treat as early as possible wuth as potent a therapy as possible; the immune system is still relatively intact (naive CD4 population has not depleted); the lymph nodes may not yet be beyond salvation; it may be the best opportunity for immune reconstitution and eradication. There are some who suggest starting therapy as soon as possible with 2 nucleosides; compliance will be easier; therapy options can be saved. Others recommend if an individual initially presents themselves with high CD4 and low viral load (below 5,000 was a cutoff raised at this meeting), the person should be monitored closely and at the first sign of progression double nucleoside or potent 3-drug therapy could be started. The potent 3-drug therapy could consist of nevirapine/AZT/ddI or protease inhibitor therapy/nucleoside(s).

<p> <strong> <a name=ii> Editorial: </a></strong> I testified that the guidelines should not be restrictive but should remain flexible to allow doctors and patients to make their own decisions of whether to treat early and with what type of treatment. Adequate insurance re-imbursement may depend on sufficiently flexible recommendations. It is equally important to educate doctors of all the treatment options and the pluses and minuses for each decision. It is clear, that as of this point in time, opinions are mixed as to precisely when to begin therapy and what is the optimal treatment to start therapy with--whether it be hitting hard and early with 3-4 drug therapy or starting with double-nucleoside therapy. Treatment decisions should be personal, individualized and between doctor and patient.

<p> But, adequate education of all doctors and treating professionals is a major obstacle. Good treatment today is more complicated than previously, when AZT-monotherapy for those with under 500 CD4 was first recommended. Many doctors will be aware of the latest information and treatment options, but many will not. Will over-burdened clinic and HMO doctors take the time to be adequately informed? Will the federal government be able to undertake an effective program for such education. The stakes are higher now because of the greater-than-ever promise for improved health due to protease inhibitors; and, the equal potential to ruin the promise due to resistance from improper treatment and compliance. Is the NIH and our medical establishment up to this challenge?

<p> It is advisable that doctors and patients plan treatment strategies into the future. You should plan ahead to your next 2 or three moves, like in a chess match. Consider which drugs are currently available and which will become available and when; consider potential cross-resistance, and plan for alternatives if a particular strategy doesn't work out.

<p> The NIH panel will meet again privately in December before issuing recommendations after January 1, 1997.

<h3>Report From the 3rd Int'l. Congress on Drug Therapy in HIV Infection<br> November 5</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Oy mate!! This is Jules Levin reporting from my hotel room at this conference in Birmingham, England. The meeting appears to be a mini-antiretroviral conference for doctors and activists from Europe and Australia.. The food is horrible here; every thing is deep-fried; and, the hotel is lousy; when I get back to New York, god knows what my triglycerides and cholesterol might be. At least I can understand the language and watch TV; although, the TV game and interview shows are a little quirky.

<p> It is Tuesday, the third day of the conference which will last through Thursday. I'll briefly address some highlights and I hope to write a more elaborate report upon returning to NYC. I just finished an interview with Dr. Joep Lange, which I hope to be able to prepare for this web site soon after returning to NYC. Dr. Lange, of the University of Amsterdam, is widely considered a revered and knowledgeable AIDS researcher worldwide; and, in our interview he expressed his well defined opinions on when to start therapy, what to start with, and also on clinical endpoint studies.

<p> Follow-up reports will review data presented and other developments: ritonavir/saquinavir combination protease; ritonavir+AZT/3TC, immediate vs. delayed nucleosides; ritonavir for pediatrics--6 mos to 18 years; update on nelfinavir resistance; nelfinavir+d4T/ddI--pilot study; ritonavir+AZT/ddC--updated 72 weeks data; indinavir, or ritonavir in advanced AIDS; high-dose saquinavir in sero-converters, small open label study; initial lymph node data from ritonavir/AZT/3TC study; nevirapine plasma and lymph tissue RNA data; 1592U89--600 mg tid data; clinical endpoints.

<p> <strong><a name=aa>Darwinian Evolution: resistance will take over and bite you.</a></strong><br> Today, at the Merck symposium it was made clear by leading AIDS researchers (Dr. Doug Richman, Dr. Emilio Emini and Dr. Joep Lange) that the optimal approach to therapy, in their opinions, is to treat an individual with a potent 3-drug combination therapy as soon as possible in the stage of disease with the goal of rendering viral load below "detectability". Unless of course, if you might be like one of those individuals in Australia who were infected with a nef-deleted strain of virus; in which case, you may not progress and Dr. Lange said he would not treat such an individual early and hard. Except, I'm not sure how easy it would be to determine if one has a nef-deleted virus.

<p> The decision to treat early and hard as described above is conditioned on the patient being compliant. If a patient is not compliant, it is there feeling that this person, regardless of which stage of disease they may be at, might be better off delaying this therapy. If the patient is not compliant and resistance develops, you can never reverse it and they may be precluded from maximal or possibly any benefit from current and future protease inhibitors. The fate of Darwinian evolution is that once resistance (mutation) begins it is very difficult to stop it. The strongest virus, resistant mutation in this case, will survive.

<p> So, if an individual is willing and able to be compliant, these scientists recommend potent 3 drug therapy as soon as possible. Dr. Lange said he would try and put himself in the shoes of the patient, if he/she presented with detectable RNA (even 100 copies), he would initiate potent 3-drug therapy. Some individuals are using 4 drugs; a 4-drug combination of ritonavir/saquinavir/AZT/3TC is being studied now.

<p> <strong> <a name=bb>How low does an individual need to lower their viral load??.</a> </strong>In most of the protease inhibitor studies to date, investigators have measured viral load as low as the currently available commercial tests will permit: Roche's PCR measures to 200, and Chiron's bDNA measures to 500. Using double nucleoside therapy, some individuals have been able to render viral load to undetectable: below 200 or 500 copies/ml. Is that low enough? Today, Dr. Doug Richman said that individuals who've lowered their viral load to below 200 or 500 may be able to rebound more easily than if they were below 20. He and others here said the goal should be to go down to 20 or 0 copies/ml.

<p> At 200 or 500 copies, there still is viral replication which can lead to resistance and the rebound of viral load. The goal of therapy, as maintained by these researchers at this conference, is to stop viral replication and to reach as many as possible sites of "sanctuary" for the virus: the brain, CSF, the gut, lymph nodes, etc.

<p> If you accept their thinking, merely being under 200 or 500 may not be adequate. You will have to lower viral load to as close to zero as you can get. Although it is not yet commercially available Roche has a PCR test that measures as low as 20 copies and Chiron has a test that measures as low as 40 copies. Currently, Merck is examining stored blood samples of individuals from the AZT/3TC/indinavir study (trial # 035). The purpose is to determine if those individuals whose viral load was rendered "undetectable" in 035 (lower limit of test used in the study was 500) may also be as low as 20 copies. However, the consistency of the results from this test can be variable.

<p> Other AIDS researchers are not convinced that it is necessary to reduce viral load that low. Dr. Robert Coombs, an AIDS researcher from the University of Washington at Seattle, contends that it may be acceptable or preferable to maintain an individual's viral load at 5 to 10,000 or maybe even 20,000. Dr. Coombs maintains, we don't know whether this approach would be equal to or superior to the approach of hitting hard and early, but that we need to conduct a study to address the question. Dr. Coombs suggests the reasons for considering this approach include: (1) multi-drug protease inhibitor therapy is very expensive; some individuals may not be able to access it in the current economic climate; (2) it is difficult to comply with all the requirements for taking a protease inhibitor; if one is not compliant because they are not yet sick and don't feel the necessity to be strictly compliant, or they just are not able to or willing to be compliant, resistance could develop and severely hamper or even ruin future benefit from protease inhibitors; (3) considering the potential of cross-resistance, you could save the protease inhibitor option for the future.

<p><strong><a name=cc>What about viral reservoirs?</a></strong>Now that we are able to lower viral load in circulating blood to such low levels, the focus of concern is suppressing virus in other compartments: brain, lymph nodes, CSF, etc. Research is addressing this issue. The question was raised here: whether or not you need to have a neuro-protective drug in your therapy regimen? It is possible that it may not matter whether or not a therapy regimen contains a drug that adequately crosses the blood brain barrier. It is believed that virus trafficks between peripheral circulation and the brain; it is possible that therapy affects virus that may travel from the brain to peripheral circulation through the CSF, which may in turn travel back to brain. However, until we have more conclusive data regarding this, it was recommended that using a drug that adequately penetrates the brain is advisable: AZT, d4T and nevirapine penetrate the CSF.

<p> If you are AZT resistant, it is uncertain whether or not you may be able to still retain neurological benefit from AZT. It appears as though the currently available protease inhibitors do not penetrate the brain well enough. Although, both d4T and nevirapine appear to appreciably enter the CSF, we do not yet have data in humans, for these two drugs, measuring the actual benefit neurologically.

<p> <strong><a name=dd>Longer-term viral load suppression. </a></strong> Merck announced that in January they will present data going out to 80 weeks for some phase II study patients (from trials #s 020 and 021) taking indinavir and for a few patients who are out to 96 weeks. Generally, those individuals who were "undetectable" at about 1 year are still undetectable (the lower limit of detection was 200 copies/RNA). Some of these were individuals who initiated treatment with indinavir monotherapy and added nucleosides later.

<p> <strong><a name=ee>Protease inhibitor cross-resistance. </a></strong> The difference of opinion between Merck and Roche remains a controversy. Roche still maintains, as they have previously, that the potential for cross-resistance to indinavir after treatment with saquinavir does exist but is not extensive (13-22%). Merck refutes this. They maintain the potential for cross-resistance to indinavir subsequent to saquinavir treatment is significantly greater. Data from both Merck and Roche are often based on information from a small number of individuals (see the report from the NIH Panel to Define Principles of Therapy of HIV Infection).

<p> <strong><a name=ff>IL-2. </a></strong> Dr. Cliff Lane, of the NIH discussed IL-2 therapy. It appears doubtful that IL-2 restores depleted naive CD4. He claims that the increase in naive CD4 resulting from any therapy (IL-2 or antiretroviral) appears to be proportional to the amount you had prior to therapy. This appears a little unclear. Dr. Mario Roederer says (see Surrogate Marker meeting report to come) he believes CD4 increases from antiretroviral or IL-2 therapy result from redistribution of CD4 stuck in lymph nodes, not from newly produced CD4, and that naive CD4 are not generated from therapy. Lane and Roederer agree tha memory cells are increased from therapy.

<p> Lane said, IL-2 is capable of increasing CD4 cells for individuals above and below 200 CD4. This data from the NIH study of indinavir and IL-2 was reported by Dr. Judy Falloon at ICAAC (see NATAP ICAAC Report). Previously, without accompanying indinavir therapy, IL-2 only produced increased CD4 for individuals with over 200 CD4.

<p> A study evaluating the longer-term clinical benefits of IL-2 therapy is necessary to truly assess the merit of this treatment. As well, we need continuing research of IL-2 in combination with protease inhibitor therapy.</p>

<p><strong><a name=aces>"Genetic mis-adventure" or saving your aces.</a></strong><br>Dr. Doug Richman, a virologist at UCSD, characterized sub-optimal viral suppression as a "genetic mis-adventure".

<p>AIDS is an infectious disease; scientists stated at this conference, as they have previously, when treating other infectious diseases or cancer it is standard to treat upon detection with the most potent therapy. Other researchers have taken a different position; they are concerned that using the most potent option immediately, in treating HIV, could leave an individual without adequate options if the first therapy fails (see NATAP web site article "Perspectives on Viral Load and When To Initiate Therapy", for a lengthy discussion of this important subject). If resistance develops from use of a protease inhibitor, which could result in a broad array of mutations (a genetic mis-adventure), there is potential for resulting cross-resistance to limit or prevent future benefit from subsequent protease inhibitor therapy. That is, if resistance developed from therapy with a potent three drug therapy including indinavir or ritonavir, there is concern about the level of cross-resistance that could develop with other protease inhibitors available now or in the future.

<p>Drs. Richman, Emini, and Lange agree if treatment is initiated with a therapy that does not maximally suppress the virus to below detection, resistance will eventually develop. As alluded to in the 1st report from Birmingham, in the Darwinian evolution section, Dr. Richman said once resistance emerges, the genetic make-up of the protease enzyme changes forever. This could diminish the virus' sensitivity to currently available protease inhibitors; and to others now in clinical or pre-clinical development. Several drug company programs are in pre-clinical development with additional protease inhibitors that may have limited or no cross-resistance with the currently available inhibitors. But, it is too soon to determine or speculate if that will occur.

<p>It appears as though the currently approved protease inhibitors (saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir) have at least some measure of overlapping mutation profiles. The significant mutations that can result from resistance to one protease inhibitor can overlap with those of another. For example, ritonavir and indinavir appear to be fully cross-resistant. If you develop resistance to one, it is unlikely you can benefit from the other. Agouron has reported preliminary information indicating that nelfinavir has a unique mutation profile; they reported D30N as the predominant mutation responsible for resistance; the preliminary indication is that if you use nelfinavir prior to other protease inhibitors you may still be sensitive to the other protease inhibitors, if resistance to nelfinavir develops. It is important to remember that the true measure of cross-resistance is actual experiences; that is, when larger numbers of individuals actually are taking a drug and switching therapies after resistance develops.

<p>Treatment choices also have a personal aspect. If you have exhausted some or all nucleoside options, selecting a maximally potent or suppresive therapy becomes difficult. It is crucial to plan the future course of your treatment strategies. Look ahead to the drugs that will be available in the future, consider your current options and map out a strategy.

<p>As discussed in the 1st Report from Birmingham, an individual must be willing to commit to the adherence or compliance necessities of taking the potent 3-drug protease inhibitor therapy. If a person starts therapy with AZT/3TC alone without sustained maximal suppression, resistance will eventually emerge and that person has forever lost the full benefit of the AZT/3TC combination. However, as newer drugs come along,--such as 1592U89, possibly Lubovcavir from Bristol-Myers, DMP-266 (NNRTI from DuPont Merck)--the possibility of exhausted AZT/3TC may not be as significant.

<p>It appears crucial that at least when initiating a new therapy for the purpose of maximal suppression, you need at least two drugs you never before used; at least one of these two ought to be a potent antiretroviral, such as a potent protease inhibitor. Adding a protease inhibitor on top of 1 or 2 nucleosides that you've been taking for a prolonged period of time lessens your chances of acheiving maximal suppression, and is like taking protease inhibitor monotherapy. In this scenario, you should be prepared for the possibility that resistance may emerge and your viral load may come back up.

<p>Some individuals are able to render their viral load to undetectable with indinavir or ritonavir monotherapy, or a combination of 2 drugs. It is less risky and more advisable to use a 3-drug combination composed of drugs from different classes. Different classes of drugs may be able to enter different types of cells or different compartments. This should help suppress replication better and increase ability to avoid resistance. Overall results of a number of indinavir studies indicated about 40% of those taking indinavir monotherapy were able to sustain viral load below detectability of the test used after a prolonged period; but, that is misleading as 40% is a mean or median. Many participants in those studies did not lower their viral load to undetectable or were not able to sustain it, developed resistance and thereby lost the opportunity to benefit from indinavir and possibly ritonavir forever.

<p> Soon, we may have a better understanding of how to combine a protease inhibitor with a NNRTI. Some individuals are already combining indinavir with nevirapine because they've exhausted other treatment options, but the interaction data of combining these two drugs is preliminary; both are processed through the cytochrome p450 liver system, which alters blood levels of the drugs being taken; you could end up with blood levels of a drug that are either too low or too high, and this could cause toxicity or resistance. It may not yet be advisable to combine them, unless you have no other alternatives. NNRTIs have the potential for cross-resistance. The development of resistance to a NNRTI may limit benefit from another NNRTI. As well, if taking ritonavir and saquinavir in combination, you should add 1 or 2 nucleosides.

<p> In earlier indinavir studies where some individuals viral load has rebounded, possibly due to taking indinavir monotherapy, their CD4 has remained elevated. The reason for this is not understood. It is thought that their virus has become debilitated, possibly non-infectious, defective, and less virulent. The implications of such a development are not understood, but it may be a positive outcome.

<p> Today and tomorrow, November 13 and 14, the NIH is conducting a conference in Washington, D.C. to address establishing an updated standard of care; hopefully, a good document will emerge. Researchers and community advocates gathered to observe and participate. On the first day, several researchers agreed that if an individual presented themselves with high CD4 and low viral load (for example, 500 CD4 and 2,000 plasma RNA), and was not a sero-converter, they would not necessarily recommend therapy. They would monitor their CD4 and viral load closely for any changes unless the individual insisted on starting treatment.

<p> <strong> <a name=aa>Nevirapine: updated viral load data. </a></strong> In the Boerhinger Ingleheim trial #1046, triple therapy of nevirapine/AZT/ddI was studied. After 28 weeks, there was a CD4 rise from baseline of about 150 cells , and a plasma RNA decline of 1.65 to the lower limit of detection. 73% of study participants receiving this triple therapy had undetectable viral load (the Roche PCR test was used --200 RNA copies/ml was the lower limit of detection). After 52 weeks, the proportion that remained undetectable was 57%. See the two articles on NATAP web site: Post-Vancouver Nevirapine Update and Nevirapine Approval Recommended; these two articles comprehensively review #1046 and other information.

<p> At this conference, BI presented for the first time, findings from the Roche ultra-sensitive viral load test (whose lower level of detection is 20 copies). After 52 weeks, 51% were below the limit of detection. The reliability of the Roche ultra-direct (20 copies/ml) test is still in development. The development of resistance may be a factor in the decline from 73% undetectability to 57%. Although, the data is for a smaller number of individuals, in the Merck study #035, where participants were AZT-experienced and 3TC-naive (see Post-Vancouver Indinavir/AZT/3TC Update on web site), the viral load reductions and the proportion of individuals remaining undetectable (lower limit of detection is 500 copies) appear to be more durable. As well, the latest results described below from ritonavir triple combination studies may indicate better durability. Preliminary interaction data is available of nevirapine used with saquinavir; preliminary interaction data of its use with indinavir and ritonavir is expected in November and December, respectively. But, more time is needed to better understand how to combine nevirapine with indinavir and ritonavir. Nevirapine reduces saquinavir blood levels, so that is a questionable combination.

<p><!-- "Genetic Misadventure".......(continued). -->The report of the first day from this conference, also discussed opinions expressed at this meeting in support of starting potent therapy as soon as possible, with the intent of lowering viral load to zero.

<p> The International AIDS Society (IAS) convened a panel of AIDS doctors and researchers and said: "any decision to initiate therapy for individuals with over 500 CD4 must be tempered by the fact that there is no available data to support treatment in such an early stage of the disease". Some of the considerations that might influence the decision to delay therapy include: (1) a concern about tolerance and toxicities; the potential side effects of protease inhibitors may discourage individuals from starting therapy when they feel healthy; some individuals may be concerned about tocxicities from longer-term treatment; (2) the cost of protease inhibitor therapy may be prohibitive; (3) the possibility of developing drug resistance and consequent protease inhibitor cross-resistance may be a deterrent; (4) if an individual isn't compliant, it may be better to delay starting therapy until they are prepared to be compliant.

<p> However, the IAS has also said, ideally, therapy should be initiated before any immunological damage occurs. Data from John Mellors MACS study shows individuals with CD4 of 787 and high viral load progress significantly more quickly than individuals with CD4 of 787 but who have low viral load. The IAS has recommended considering starting therapy with a double nucleoside regimen, i.e. AZT/ddI, AZT/3TC, d4T/ddI, AZT/ddC, d4T/3TC; which could be followed by more potent therapy, particularly if treatment failure develops. It is rumored that the IAS may be convening to revise these recommendations, but have yet to do so. I hope an awareness of both sides of the discussion is helpful. Treatment choices are complex, personal and have consequences.

<p><strong><a name=fda>"Clinical endpoints are surrogate markers of an antiviral effect"</a>; to the FDA: are traditional clinical endpoint studies necessary anymore? </strong><br> Traditional clinical endpoint studies are where individuals are randomized to receive the drug, which is the object of the study, or not to receive it. On top of the new drug or placebo, they may be permitted, to take other approved drugs. These studies are now usually reserved for individuals with low CD4 (under 100 or 200). The purpose is to examine the rate of the development of opportunistic diseases and deaths for each of the two treatment arms. If the individuals in the treatment arm receiving the new drug, which is the object of the study, live longer and develop OIs less quickly or in less quantity (as compared to the individuals in the other treatment arm not receiving the study drug), then the drug is approved. Are the individuals in the placebo or control group receiving sub-optimal treatment?? Should they receive sub-optimal theapy? These are crucial questions, that are being hotly discussed at this changing time in AIDS drug development.

<p> There is some important information derived from such studies: safety and some measure of durability of the drug's effect on disease progression. However, it has been suggested that this information could be obtained by long-term observational studies where all volunteers would receive open-label drug; they would simply be followed for an extended period (3, 5 or possibly 10 years) to study the durability of benefits and potential toxicities; but, it is suggested that a one-year randomized clinical endpoint study gets answers more quickly and allows us to have a better basis more quickly for treatment decisions. Ramdomization to roughly equivalent treatment arms is another approach. For example, one arm could be indinavir with two nucleosides of your choice vs. nelfinavir with two nucleosides of your choice. Either arm has appeal, without sacrificing an individual to a sub-optimal therapy. Additional alternative approaches have been suggested. Again, answers from such a study would probably take longer to accrue than a traditional endpoint study.

<p> A relevant question in this debate about the usefulness of traditional clinical endpoint studies is: can we use a drug's effect on viral load as an adequate measure of its ability to delay progression and prolong survival? If so, then safety and durability remain to be addressed. But, how would we detect whether a potential toxicity from long-term use results from the drug or from HIV without randomization? The FDA is not yet convinced that viral load is an adequate measure of clinical progression.

<p> Joep Lange said at this meeting, "as you may know, I'm not of the opinion that clinical endpoint studies are the holy grail of antiretroviral therapy. They are in fact, surrogate markers of an antiviral effect.....There appropriate role in developing new drug therapies are often misunderstood and/or abused by regulatory authorities, health care providers, governments and pharmaceutical companies.....I do not condone the use of sub-optimal therapies in clinical endpoint studies". However, Dr. Lange may approve of a clinical endpoint study that doesn't randomize one to a sub-optimal therapy.

<p> Dr. Robert Schooley, who heads the ACTG (AIDS Clinical Trials Group), said we need to radically change our approach to clinical trials, as he addressed the future of clinical endpoint studies. Most trials have been designed up til now to see if you can slow down the rate at which individuals may develop an HIV related infection, with the addition of one new drug to existing available therapies. These types of trials are set up to wait for patient failure. He said, we cannot continue to do this for every new drug coming along; such trials aimed at gaining regulatory approval cost $50-100 million.

<p> Schooley went on to say, today successful patient management requires individualized attention and strategy, which is not possible in the way trials are currently designed. We need trial design that allows both treatment arms to stay with a regimen that allows for maximal viral suppression and without clinical progression; and, that allows for changes in therapy that may be necessary to accomplish that goal.

<p> Schooley continued, we need clinical endpoint studies, but they should be focused on: (1) treatment sequencing strategies and paradigms; for example, is complete suppression of the virus the way we need to go?; if so, how do we best do that? (2) longer term trials should address specific questions such as to better understand resistance, cross-resistance and how to prevent it; which drugs may be better to combine pharmacologically; which drugs may be better in specific populations; (3) a trial should simultaneously address its affect on viral replication, the development of opportunistic infections and immune function.

<p> Finally, he said, patients entering a clinical trial should expect to be treated at least as well and hopefully better then they would in a practitioner's office; and, they should receive real-time viral load testing results.

<p> Again, do we need randomization to detect if a potential toxicity from longer-term therapy is drug-related or due to HIV?

<p> <strong> Author's commentary: </strong> It is high-time for the FDA and drug companies to get creative. It is crucial that the FDA be flexible, progressive and quickly adapt to the new developments in research and treatment. I call on the FDA and the industry to give immediate consideration to these questions. Resources for clinical trials are limited, as measured both by dollars and patient participation; we cannot use these resources unwisely, because we need adequate resources devoted to developing more and better drugs.

<p> <strong> <a name=bb> Ritonavir and Saquinavir in combination. </a></strong> Dr. William Cameron, of the University of Ottawa, presented the latest data available from the ongoing open-label pilot trial comparing 4 different dosing regimens in this first study of a protease-protease combination therapy. Previously, at ICAAC in September, 12 weeks of data were presented. For prior background data and information see the NATAP articles reviewing data presented at Vancouver (6 weeks) and ICAAC.

<p> As you may already know, study participants have been randomized to one of 4 treatment arms: (1) 400 mg bid (every 12 hrs) ritonavir + 400 mg bid saquinavir; (2) 600 mg bid ritonavir + 400 mg bid saquinavir; (3) 400 mg tid (every 8 hrs) ritonavir + 400 mg tid saquinavir; (4) 600 mg bid ritonavir + 600 mg bid saquinavir. Cameron presented 20 weeks of data for the 1st two groups, and 12 weeks of data for the 3rd and 4th groups, as group 3 and 4 started therapy after the first two groups.

<p> Cameron reported, after 20 weeks, those in group 1 taking 400 mg RTN bid+400 mg SQV bid had median reductions in RNA of 3.21 log and median increases in CD4 of 75, from baseline. By comparison, at 12 weeks this group experienced a median reduction in RNA of 2.74 log and a median increase in CD4 of 91, from baseline. Their median baseline RNA and CD4 were about 43,000 (4.63 log) and 277, respectively.

<p> Those from group two taking 600 mg RTN bid+400 mg SQV bid had a median reduction in RNA of 3.17, and a median increase in CD4 of 120. By comparison at week 12, this group had a median reduction of 3.06 log, and a median increase in CD4 of 113. Their median baseline RNA and CD4 were about 53,000 (4.72 log) and 264, respectively. The number of study participants upon which the data is based for both groups is 51. The improvements for both groups 1 and 2 appear to be leveling off.

<p> The Roche PCR test with a lower limit of detection of 200 was used in this study. About 80% of the 51 individuals from both groups were below the limit of detection of 200 copies/ml. At 12 weeks, for groups 1 and 2, the proportions were 75% and 70%, respectively. Approximately a 2 log decline in RNA for all 4 groups reduces their viral load to the 200 copy level. The remaining reduction is below the 200 level.

<p> After 12 weeks, those from group 3 taking 400 mg RTN tid+400 mg SQV tid, experienced a median reduction in RNA from baseline of 2.68 log, and a median increase from baseline in CD4 of about 100. By comparison at week 6, their RNA reduction was 2.09 and CD4 increase was 74. Their median baseline RNA and CD4 were about 27,000 (4.43 log) and 302 cells, respectively.

<p> After 12 weeks, individuals in group 4 taking 600 mg RTN bid+600 mg SQV bid, experienced a median reduction in RNA of 2.73 log, and a median CD4 increase of 120. By comparison at week 6, this group's RNA reduction was 2.19 log, and CD4 increase was 88. The % undetectable for groups 3 and 4 were reported as 80% and 60%, respectively. Their baseline median RNA and CD4 were about 43,000 (4.63) and 251. The data for groups 3 and 4 are based on 44 evaluable study participants.

<p> The differences in RNA and CD4 responses between treatment groups are not statistically significant. It is still uncertain which of the dose regimens may be superior. In the future, differenr dose regimens may be studied. However, the tid regimen appears to be less tolerable, and may be the least preferable. For groups 1 and 2, it doesn't appear as though the side effect profile is any different than that for ritonavir. For group 4, there were several incidences of elevated LFTs (liver enzyme levels). It is my understanding there were a few discontinuations or interruptions in treatment due to that side effect.

<p> We do not know the longer term durability of this drug combination; it was the first study of combining two protease inhibitors. Cameron cautioned listeners not to draw too many conclusions from the data. Merck is now planning a protease-protease study of combining indinavir with the "EOF" saquinavir (enhanced oral formulation-the new more bio-available form). It may be advisable that a regimen of ritonavir+saquinavir should include nucleoside therapy of one or possibly two drugs. The combination of two protease inhibitors is still experimental. Although, it may render viral load undetectable, the durability of this reduction may be more secure with additional nucleoside(s) therapy. With more advanced AIDS or higher viral load, it may be more difficult to keep a viral load reduction sustained..

<p> <strong> <em> Saquinavir absorption and eating. </em> </strong> If an individual is taking saquinavir in combination with nucleosides, eating an adequate meal prior to taking saquinavir is required for proper absorption of saquinavir. According to the saquinavir package insert, a large fatty meal is recommended for maximal absorption. When ritonavir is used in combination with saquinavir, the blood levels of saquinavir are greatly increased. That is the reason for combining the two drugs. An important question is, do you still need to eat before taking your medication of saquinavir with ritonavir, and if so how much? Roche says they are now researching this question, but for now they recommend eating an "adequate" meal before taking the two protease inhibitors. In fact, although Abbott says it's not absolutely necessary, a sandwich sized meal is recommended prior to taking ritonavir medication, also for absorption.

<p> <strong> <em> 4-drug combination studies. </em> </strong> At the conference, David Ho reported preliminary information on the first study of 4-drug therapy. It is an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study of ritonavir 600 mg bid+saquinavir 600 mg bid+AZT 300 mg bid+3TC 150 mg bid. Twenty-four patients--12 sero-converters and 12 with chronic infection--are in study and "beginning to see a potent antiviral effect". After 6 weeks, the acutely infected individuals, who began with high viral loads have exhibited only a 1st phase decay of RNA decline; one, however, that is substantial and prolonged. Ho said, this is different from what one sees in chronic infection, where one sees a "bi-phasic decay", i.e. the 1st phase decay has a more steep decline in RNA, followed by the 2nd phase decay, characterized as a less steep decline in RNA ; in this study, and normally, the 2nd phase begins after 2 weeks.

<p> <strong> <a name=cc> Ritonavir/AZT/3TC: immediate vs delayed. </a></strong> Dr. Sven Danner, of the University of Amsterdam, presented preliminary data of this ongoing open-label, randomized two-arm study of anti-retroviral naive individuals, with CD4 counts greater than 50 and plasma RNA above 30,000. Tonsillar biopsies of lymphoid tissue were taken at 4 time-points to compare changes in plasma RNA with changes in tissue load.

<p> Side effects experienced were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, asthenia (tingling around the mouth) and malaise. Eight patients withdrew from the study. As well, there were dosage interruptions and reductions due to side effects.

<p> Thirty-one individuals were randomized to begin the triple therapy (ritonavir 600mg bid+AZT 300mg bid+3TC 150mg bid) simultaneously or to the delayed group where ritonavir was initiated alone followed by the addition of AZT and 3TC three weeks later. In each arm, ritonavir was started at 300mg bid, gradually escalating to the full dose after 4 days. The immediate vs delayed comparison is to detect if there is difference in antiviral effect due to the three week delay in adding AZT/3TC. Group 1, the immediate group, had a median baseline RNA and CD4 of 5.27 log (about 187,000 copies/ml), and 177 cells, respectively. Group 2, which delayed AZT/3TC for 3 weeks had a median RNA and CD4 baseline of 5.37 log (about, 235,000 copies/ml), and 134 cells, respectively.

<p> The RNA response for both groups, of about a 2.0 log reduction from baseline, was about the same at 3 weeks. At 24 weeks, the CD4 increases were 180 for the immediate group (9 evaluable patients) and 100 for the delayed group (12 evaluable patients). Dr. Danner said the difference could have been due to the difference in their baseline CD4 numbers.

<p> After 12 weeks the decline in RNA appears to level off, at a reduction of 2.8 log from baseline, because, as Dr. Danner explained, a number of study particpants were below the limit of detection of the assay. The Roche Amplicor test was used with a median lower level of detection of 238 copies/ml. After 24 weeks, with 10 evaluable participants in each of the two arms, the decline in plasma RNA was 2.8 log for both groups; there was no statistical difference between the two groups.

<p> The following data does not include study participants who discontinued or interrupted therapy, that is only those who remained on full dose of study medications. In the immediate group, 100% were undetectable by week 16 and remained undetectable at week 24. By week 24, 100% of the delayed group were undetectable. This and other studies indicate that it can take as long as 24 weeks to acheive maximal suppression. As long as an initial adequate suppression of 1 to 2 logs is seen in the first few weeks after beginning therapy, you should be patient.

<p> Dr. Danner said, the results obtained to date do not point to a difference in antiretroviral potential between the two treatment groups over the first three weeks. This suggests that the incomplete reduction in viral load seen after three weeks (when compared to the reduction after 16 weeks) is not due to lack of potency of the regimen, nor to rapidly developing resistance. Dr. Danner reported 2 patients had a A71 mutation at baseline; at day 22, 1 patient had a V82A, and another patient had a A71; one patient had a mutation at 41 and 215 but was still undetectable and another had a mutation at 82 after a few weeks, but was also still undetectable.

<p> Lymphoid tissue. Dr. Daan Notermans, of the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam, reported results from a study of the RNA load in the lymphoid tissue from tonsillar biopsies of 6 participants who continued on treatment in the ritonavir/AZT/3TC study. For each of the six, investigators have baseline and six months values. The tissue RNA load was measured with the Chiron ultra-sensitive bDNA assay. The lower limit of detection of the test is 500 copies; this calculates to 30,000 copies per gram of tissue (or 30 copies per mg of tissue) and is 1.84 log. Notermans reported that by week 24, in all of the six patients, the tissue RNA was below the limit of detection for the assay. Although below 500 copies, residual virus may still be present. Other researchers said more effective methodology, than was used in this study, for examining lymph tissue should be utilized and will in studies conducted in the very near future. The more effective methodolgy is expected to yield a more definitive understanding of virus activity in lymph tissue. The goal is to correlate virus activity in lymph tissue with virus activity in plasma (blood circulation), as measured by commercially available viral load tests, such as the PCR and bDNA tests. If that correlation can be established, it may not be necessary to measure viral burden in lymph tissue.

<p> Notermans requested that standards for anti-retroviral therapy be re-set to include reducing HIV RNA levels in the lymphoid tissue in addition to reduction in the peripheral blood. He continued, "we need to follow-up to see how sustained the suppression is; and, we need to know other things, such as what happens to the level of pro-viral DNA in the lymphoid tissue. Even if we manage to suppress the virus strong and long enough, is reconstruction of the immune system possible?"

<p> These results were encouraging, but more extensive lymphoid tissue studies will be necessary and are planned.

<p> <strong> <a name=dd> Ritonavir/AZT/ddC. </a></strong> Dr. Jean-Pierre Chauvin, of Abbott Labs-France, reported the findings of a pilot, open-label, non-randomized evaluation of this triple therapy in anti-retroviral naive individuals. See the Post-Vancouver report (60 weeks) on the NATAP web site for background information and previously reported data. The regimen used was 600 mg bid ritonavir, 200 mg tid AZT, and 0.75 mg tid ddC. Chauvin said ddC was chosen because 3TC was not available at the start of the study. Thirty-two individuals were initially enrolled with CD4 between 50-250. The oral solution of ritonavir was used at the start of the study, and after one year study participants were switched to the capsules.

<p> Baseline characteristics were: median CD4 152 cells; median HIV plasma viral load 4.80 log (about 63,000 copies/ml; range about 1,200 copies to 246,000 copies).

<p> The mean reduction in HIV RNA was 2.0 (n=27) at week 8; this was sustained at week 24 (n=21) and at week 72 with a reduction of 1.9 log in 17 patients remaining on triple therapy. After 72 weeks 12/17 patients (70%) had cellular viremia below the detectable level.

<p> The mean CD4 was 170 at baseline, 280 at week 8 (n=26), 304 at week 24 (n=21), 338 at week 60 (n=17), and 328 at week 72.

<p> During the first six months 11 patients discontinued; Chauvin said six of these were due to the oral solution of ritonavir, and compliance appeared to improve.

<p> <strong> <a name=ee> Ritonavir in children. </a></strong> Dr. Brigitta Mueller, of the National Cancer Institute, reported preliminary data from this phase I/II study. This trial is examining safety, tolerability, clinical effects, viral load in plasma, and CD4. Four dose levels (250 mg/m2, 300 mg/m2 , 350 mg/m2 , and 400 mg/m2 given orally) were evaluated using the liquid formulation in two age groups ( six months to 2 years and greater than 2 years). The 2 years and above group was further sub-divided for analysis purposes into 2 groups: 2-12 years, 12-18 years. Ritonavir was dose escalated over 5 days to full dose. Ritonavir was given alone for the first 12 weeks and then in combination with AZT and/or ddI.

<p> Dr. Mueller characterized ritonavir as "overall well-tolerated". There was an incidence of elevation in triglyceride levels. Several patients experienced nausea and vomiting at the two higher dose levels; there were a few incidences of elevated liver enzymes (not dose related); One LFT elevation was experienced by a child with hepatitis C. The mouths of some children were coated with peanut butter, while others drank chocolate milk before and after medication to help tolerance of the distasteful liquid.

<p> As of September 30, 1996, 46 children have been enrolled. Thirty-seven had completed at least 12 weeks or had come off study and were included in this analysis.

<p> By day 28, the median CD4 increase was 38 cells for those on the lowest dose and 148 for those on the highest dose. Plasma RNA decreased "rapidly" from baseline by 0.5-2.0 log and remained below baseline for at least 24 weeks.

<p> After 12 weeks, preliminary CD4 increases were reported to be 50-100 cells. >From 12-24 weeks, when AZT and/or ddI were added, CD4 counts continued increasing. After adding the nucleoside therapy, RNA levels didn't continue to decline because some children were taking ddI at the same time as ritonavir. ddI is supposed to be taken on an empty stomach, while ritonavir is to be taken with food.

<p> Meuller described one patient's positive response. Their CD4 was 50-60 at baseline; after 6 months of treatment the CD4 increased to 580 cells and later on to 900 cells. Mueller said there is a preliminary indication of a significant antiviral effect, and that limited data in children inder 2 years of age indicate that a dose of 250-300 mg/m2 given every 12 hours is well tolerated.

<p> Enrollment is continuing and resistance, pharmacokinetics and CD4 repertoire studies will be conducted. There are plans to conduct studies of ritonavir for vertical transmission and neo-nates.

<p> <strong> <a name=ff> Nelfinavir + d4T/ddI. </a></strong> Dr. Louise Pedneault, of Bristol-Myers Squibb, reported preliminary data from this 12-week, pilot, open-label study of 22 individuals; all were naive to d4T, ddI and protease inhibitors, and received full dose of each drug. Dr. Pedneault outlined some reasons for exploring this combination: (1) the in vitro synergy between d4T and ddI; (2) ddI and d4T appear to have some favorable resistance characteristics; (3) preliminary resistance data from Agouron indicates nelfinavir may have a unique resistance profile; that is, treatment with nelfinavir prior to other protease inhibitors may not create cross-resistance to those other protease inhibitors.

<p> This study was intended to evaluate safety, tolerance, and preliminary antiviral effect. Baseline CD4 and plasma RNA were 315 cells (range 70-700) and 4.75 log (about 56,000 copies/ml). Half of participants had a history of prior therapy and half were drug-naive.

<p> After 8 weeks, the reduction in plasma RNA was 1.8 log (n=17) with a median increase in CD4 of 90-100 cells (n=19). Chiron's bDNA viral load test, with a lower limit of detection of 500 copies/ml, was used to measure plasma RNA. Considering that many study participants started the trial below 56,000 copies, an approximate 2.0 log reduction would render them undetectable by the assay; that may be a reason we see only a 1.80 log reduction for the 17 evaluable participants. Additionally, it can take longer than 8 weeks to realize the full effect of a potent therapy on plasma viral load.

<p> It was found that ddI did not effect the pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir.

<p> Dr. Patrick Yeni, of the Hopital-Bichat Claude Bernard-Paris, said "the triple combination was well-tolerated.......individual drug profiles suggest that there may be less drug resistance with this combination than with others."

<p> <strong> <em> New trials. </em> </strong> Bristol-Myers is planning a 200-patient European trial of this triple combination. As well, they're initiating a trial comparing d4T+3TC+indinavir and d4T+ddI+indinavir with AZT/3TC+indinavir. See the NATAP web site post-Vancouver review of the preliminary data from the d4T/ddI trial. In that trial there was a low incidence of neuropathy, but the study participants were a relatively healthy group earlier in the disease stage. The incidence of neuropathy can be higher in a more advanced stage of disease. The first public announcement was made by Roche and Agouron in Birmingham, of a 48-week trial of the combination of nelfinavir with saquinavir (the new EOF). An initial study of the combination found favorable pharmacokinetics and it was well-tolerated. This trial will take place in Europe only, and is expected to begin by the end of 1996. Four treatment arms are planned for comparison: saquinavir+nucleosides vs nelfinavir+nucleosides vs saquinavir+nelfinavir without nucleosides vs saquinavir+nelfinavir with nucleosides.

<p> Stay tuned for 3rd Report from Birmingham and report from Surrogate Marker meeting of November 18-19

<blockquote>

<p><a name="*">*</a> 2/6 in the triple therapy group were defined as non-compliant: therefore, in column #3, for those who were compliant with taking study drugs 2/4 were below 500 plasma RNA copies; in the fourth column 1/4 were below 20 copies; in the 6th column 3/4 were below 7 log (undetectable-explained below) and Dr. Harris reported that the 4th person was just above detectability (12,000 copies per mg of tissue).</p>


<p> The Roche Amplicor PCR test was used for the plasma RNA testing in column #3 of the chart with a lower limit of detection of 500 copies/ml (or, 2.7 log). The Roche ultra-direct assay (lower limit of detection of 20 copies; or, 1.3 log) was used for the values in column #4. The Chiron bDNA 1st generation test (lower limit of detection of 10,000 copies) was used for the lymph node RNA values in the last column. This test was used because it was the only one available at the time the study was conducted. The results are encouraging, but since the lower limit of detection of the lymph nose test was so high we don't know the true level of virus burden in the lymph node. Unlike blood samples where you can save the sample and run another test, the lymph node sample is lost after one test. Future lymph node studies will use technology that allows measuring to lower levels of detection.

<p> The CD4 and plasma RNA values in the chart above were done on the same day as the lymph node biopsies. So, all chart values were obtained on the same day. Unfortunately, no lymph node viral burden values were obtained at the baseline of the study prior to study treatment.

<p> The plasma RNA declines during the course of therapy in the study correlate (statistically significant) with the reductions in lymph node viral burden (RNA). The plasma RNA levels done on the day of the lymph node biopsies indicate a trend in correlation with the lymph node RNA levels.

<p> The language currently used for expressing the values of viral burden in lymph tissue is foreign to me and others, and is not easily understood; but, the actual values follow. The 8.31 log value in column #5 equals 206 million copies per gram of lymph tissue or 206,000 copies per mg of lymph tissue; the 7.86 log value equals 72 million copies per gram of tissue or 72,000 copies per mg of tissue; 7.43 log equals 27 million copies per gram of tissue or 27,000 copies per mg of tissue; 7.04 log equals 11 million copies per gram of tissue or 11,000 copies per mg of tissue. In the last column, 7 log (undetectable-10,000 copies) is equal to 10 million copies per gram of tissue or 10,000 copies per mg of tissue.

<p> As we are able to reduce plasma viral load to undetectable levels, it becomes vitally important to be able to evaluate viral burden in other organs or compartments of the body to obtain a closer assessment of the effect of antiretroviral therapy. Treating physicians, researchers, people with HIV or AIDS, insurance re-imbursers and others will want to know the full extent of the effect of treatment. Eventually, we may learn that lowering plasma viral load to below 20 copies correlates with viral suppression or possibly eradication in certain or all sites; if that correlation emerges, we may only have to measure plasma RNA.

<h3>Notes From ICAAC--Wednesday Sept 18</h3>

<blockquote>


<p>The weather is very stifling in New Orleans. It is extremely hot and humid every day. Fortunately I mostly am in air-conditioning in either the convention center or the hotel. As is the usual when I travel to a conference, I have not had any chance to see or explore New Orleans at all; all I see is the hotel, a few restaurants, and the meetings. I discovered upon arrival that gambling is legal here. My hotel had a casino on a riverboat docked at the hotel. Of course, I played some slot machines and actually won $12.</p>

<p>The most significant treatment developments were reported at the Monday session, which was covered in the <a href="icaac1.html">first report</a>. Below, are some brief notes from today's presentations.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="#ind">Indinavir in combination with IL-2</a>
<li><a href="#fda">The FDA and the future of AIDS clinical studies</a>
<li><a href="#hyd">Hydroxyurea in combination with ddI</a>
<li><a href="#152">ACTG 152--pediatrics</a>
<li><a href="#neo">Neonates--viral load and progression, early treatment</a>
<li><a href="#ind2">Indinavir + AZT--Implications for induction &amp; maintenance therapy</a>
</ol>

<p><b><a name="ind">Indinavir</a> and IL-2</b><br>
As you may know, research of treatment with IL-2 has been ongoing for several years. Treatment with IL-2 can significantly raise CD4 but has no effect on viral load. The initial response to IL-2 therapy is a transient rise in virus activity. Initially, trial results indicated that individuals with low CD4 counts wouldn't respond to IL-2 therapy. </p>

<p>An NIH study has been exploring the theory of treating individuals with IL-2 and indinavir. Ten study subjects had CD4 counts under 100 at baseline. It was previously thought, individuals with such low CD4 could not be responsive to IL-2 therapy with increases in their CD4 counts. 7/10 responded well to treatment with significant rises in CD4. </p>

<p>The remaining question about IL-2 treatment that has limited itd development and utility as HIV therapy is--are the CD4 rises resulting from IL-2 therapy meaningful?? Since CD4 rises but viral load doesn't, many have cast doubt upon the potential efficacy of this treatment. The answer to this problem is to conduct a clinical endpoint study, but not in the traditional approach of design to such studies. </p>

<p><b><a name="fda">The FDA and The Future of AIDS Clinical Studies</a></b><br>
We are in a transitional period with regards to the design of studies for antiretroviral AIDS drugs, and particularly with regards to clinical endpoints. There is strong consensus that it is no longer feasible to randomize individuals to control arms that are obviously significantly below standard and optimal available treatment. Nonetheless, new approaches to clinical endpoint studies will eventually be designed, and we can do the same for a study of IL-2.</p>

<p>The FDA must react much more quickly to this changing environment and reflect these changes in the requirements they place upon drug companies for studies of new drugs. From here on, any new study that attempts to randomize an individual with 200 CD4 to a treatment arm with sub-standard therapy is questionable in terms of ethics and the feasibility of conducting that study.</p>

<p>The NIH's AIDS Clinical Trial Group is currently conducting a study called <a href="../../network/trials/hiv.html#320">ACTG 320</a>. It is a clinical endpoint study comparing AZT/3TC to indinavir + AZT/3TC for individuals with under 200 CD4. The recruitment for this study is falling off and study participants already enrolled are dropping out. There is concern the study may not be adequately completed. Individuals can do viral load testing for themselves outside the study, and if they are progressing they can drop out of the study and obtain a protease inhibitor. Of course, individuals who cannot obtain access to a protease inhibitor are relegated to the treatment that many would consider sub-standard.</p>

<p>Abbott's clinical endpoint study of ritonavir randomized individuals with under 100 CD4 to either ritonavir or placebo in addition to continuing their current therapy. Many study participants progressed to AIDS or death to prove that ritonavir can delay death and progression. This study (#247) enrolled well because protease inhibitors were not yet approved and available; many individuals entered the study to gain access to ritonavir not to participate in a study.</p>

<p>The circumstances are different now. Firstly, 3 protease inhibitors are available; soon it will be 4 after Agouron's approval for nelfinavir. If an individual with 200 CD4 can access protease inhibitor therapy, why should they take the chance of being randomized to sub-standard therapy. If a newly started clinical endpoint study (but designed in the traditional sense) were to randomize individuals to any approved therapy plus or minus the new drug being studied, two problems will arise. The individuals randomized to current therapy plus placebo will be individuals with under 200 CD4 and they will be denied access to this new drug; and, because these individuals will be receiving standard treatment (which will include a protease inhibitor), it will take a long time before they progress to clinical endpoints or death. Either, they will be consigned to their current therapy and sit and wait for endpoints or they will change their therapies while on study. By changing therapies on study, the results of the study become much more uninterpretable.</p>

<p>The FDA, academic researchers and the drug companies fully realize this problem, and discussions are ongoing regarding it. People with AIDS cannot wait for the slow grinding wheels of bureaucracy to institute needed changes. We need to address these issues immediately and implement adjustments. New and important drugs are in various stages of development. We need to make these adjustments so the phase II and III studies for these drugs don't become mired in these problems. If we don't, the FDA will be held accountable for the situation.</p>

<p><b><a name="hyd">Hydroxyurea</a> + ddI</b><br>
As you may know, a number of studies have been conducted examining the efficacy of this unique combination of drugs; and a number of new studies are now beginning. In Vancouver, positive results of such a study were presented. The data is reviewed on the NATAP website. But there have been mixed results from the various studies. Here at ICAAC, such a mixed result study was presented.</p>

<p>About 27 individuals were grouped by baseline CD4 count. Group 1 comprised individuals with under 300 CD4 and a mean value of146. Group 2 comprised individuals with CD4 above 300 and a mean value of 380. For group 1, the mean viral load decrease from baseline was 1.59 log at week 48; for group 2, the mean viral load reduction from baseline was 0.90 log at week 12. But, there was a strong rise in CD4 count for group 2 (+124 cells), while there was no significant change in group 1. No serious toxicities were observed, although a grade II-III alopecia appeared in 3 subjects with very low CD4 cell counts. It is felt that, for some individuals, hydroxyurea may be toxic to CD4 and therefore prevent an increase in the CD4 count. At a recent AIDS conference in Barcelona, a French hydroxyurea researcher announced that he may have uncovered a sister drug to hydroxyurea that may not have this characteristic. </p>

<p><b><a name="152">ACTG</a> 152, Pediatrics</b><br>
Those of you who follow pediatric data may already be familiar with this information. AZT/ddI was compared with ddI monotherapy. Study investigators have concluded ddI alone was as efficacious as AZT/ddI combination therapy, and that both therapies were superior to AZT alone for initial therapy of antiretroviral naive, symptomatic HIV-infected children. DDI recipients had fewer hematological toxicities; and in this study, it was found that those receiving AZT alone or with ddI did not have superior protection from the development of CNS complications, as compared to those receiving ddI alone. As a result, study investigators are recommending ddI as initial therapy for children. (Abstract #I150--Results of ACTG 152, A Randomized Comparative Trial of AZT, ddI, and AZT/ddI Combination Therapy in Symptomatic HIV-Infected Children).</p>

<p><b><a name="neo">Pediatric</a> AIDS and Early Intervention</b><br>
The investigators in this study found that RNA during primary infection for an infant is prognostic for progression to AIDS. Viral load (plasma HIV RNA) within 1 month after birth is predictive of progression to AIDS within one year's time; as well, viral load measured at 3 months was also predictive of progression to AIDS within a year.<?p>

<p>This study was conducted in France; neonates with high viral load are treated with combination therapy of AZT/ddI/3TC. If the viral load is not high a less potent therapy is considered. But, it is difficult to administer these therapies to such young children. (Abstract #I154--HIV-1 Cell Viremia in Neonates is Predictive of Early AIDS.</p>

<p>As well, another presentation was made here at ICAAC addressing the same issue. The authors say their data suggests that the ability of the virus to replicate increases over time with the evolution of more "fit" virus. In infants who received early intervention (less than 6 months of age) and had a slow disease course over the next 3 years, the virus isolated following treatment was less "fit". The authors suggested further studies should address whether early aggressive treatment may influence replicative properties. (Abstract #I70 --Changes In The In Vitro Replication Kinetics of HIV Primary Isolates Over Time in Perinatally Infected Children).</p>

<p>In the NICHD-NIH IVIG Clinical trial, children were prospectively studied to evaluate the association between baseline viral load, CD4% and survival in symptomatic HIV-infected children whose mean age at entry into study was 44 months. 184 children were eligible for inclusion in the study. About 14 months of follow-up was conducted, and16 (9%) died during follow-up. The authors concluded that baseline RNA as well as CD4% were independent predictors of survival among HIV-infected children enrolled in this trial. (Abstract #I101--Baseline HIV-1 RNA Copy Number & CD4 Lymphocyte Percent Independently Predict Mortality in HIV-Infected Children).</p>

<p><b><a name="ind2">Indinavir</a>+AZT: Implications for Induction &amp; Maintenance Therapy</b><br>
An interim analysis of pooled surrogate marker data from two ongoing studies (#028 & #033) of indinavir+AZT were analyzed. Among other observations, it was noted that for individuals in the lowest range of RNA at baseline, indinavir monotherapy was effective in maintaining efficacy. Merck is not yet sure how to utilize this information, but it may have application in exploring the possibility of induction followed by maintenance therapy. If an individual initiates therapy (induction phase) with a potent 3 or 4-drug therapy, this data suggests that after a period of time (possibly 12, 18, 24 or 30 months)) the individual could stop taking all the drugs in the regimen, except in this case for indinavir. This concept will be explored in future studies and has important implications. IF it is possible that such a treatment strategy is successful, cost for treatment would be reduced and compliance concerns would be relieved, because taking one drug a day is easier than taking 3 or 4. (Abstract # I109--Antiviral Activity of Indinavir Plus AZT Compared with That of Indinavir or AZT Alone in Antiretroviral Naive Patients). </p>

<h3>Report From ICAAC - Day One 9/16/96</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>This is Jules Levin reporting from ICAAC (Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents And Chemotherapy) in New Orleans. Last night was a satellite meeting with Pharmacia & Upjohn to discuss their initial results from the interaction studies of delavirdine with saquinavir, ritonavir and indinavir. Today's Late Breaker session included several important presentations. Below are highlights of the important developments from today's session as we usually do from HIV conferences, and upon return to New York a more complete analysis will be reported here.</p>

<p><b>List of presentations reported below:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#1">delavirdine interaction studies with protease inhibitors</a>
<li><a href="#2">141W94--initial data for Glaxo's protease inhibitor</a>
<li><a href="#3">ritonavir+saquinavir combination study--12 week data</a>
<li><a href="#4">DMP-266, a new NNRTI--initial data</a>
<li><a href="#5">AIDS progression and survival data from 3TC clinical endpoint study</a>
</b></ol>

<p><a name="1"><b>1. Delavirdine</a> interaction with protease inhibitors</b></p>

<p>Initial data from Upjohn's interaction studies have been provided. The studies of delavirdine with each of the 3 approved protease inhibitors were conducted in a small number of HIV- subjects and the results could be considered preliminary. Results in HIV- individuals could be different then for HIV+ individuals. It may be advisable not to make treatment decisions yet until further information is available. It is advisable to consult with your doctor about this issue.</p>

<p>Indinavir blood concentrations are raised by 50% when combined with delavridine. Delavirdine levels remain unchanged. The study was conducted by Upjohn, but Merck did not participate in this study. Merck is reviewing the data for comments. They may conduct their own interaction study. A 50% rise in blood levels of indinavir would necessitate a dose reduction of indinavir. Delavirdine's normal dosing regimen is 400 mg 3X/day. Upjohn suggested that two dose regimens of indinavir could be considered--400 mg tid (3X/day) and 600 mg tid. The current recommended dose of indinavir is 800 mg tid. If using the 400 mg dose of indinavir, that would in effect raise the dose to 600 mg; if using the 600 mg dose of indinavir, that would in effect raise the dose to 900 mg. </p>

<p>Both options raise significant questions. A 600 mg dose of indinavir is below the recommended regimen and raises concern about causing resistance. A 900 mg dose of indinavir is above the recommended dose and could raise the incidence of side effects, in particular nephrolithiasis (which can lead to kidney stones). </p>

<p>Saquinavir's blood levels were increased 5-fold when used with delavirdine. Delavirdine levels were not significantly altered. There was a 13% incidence of raised LFTs (liver enzymes--ALT) which Upjohn said was reversible, and a 6% incidence of grade III or IV raised LFTs. Upjohn recommended CLOSE MONITORING of LFTs if combining delavirdine with a protease inhibitor. Once a week lab tests of your LFT may be advisable during the initial stages of taking combination. If you have Hepatitis B or C, you may be more likely to experience an elevation of your LFTs.</p>

<p>The interaction study of ritonavir was also in a small number of individuals and used a lower than recommended dose of ritonavir of 300 mg. The recommended dose of ritonavir is 600 mg. Upjohn said their was a non-significant change in delavridine blood levels and no change to ritonavir levels; the recommended dose regimen for delavirdine is 400 mg 3/X day (tid).</p>

<p>Boehringer Ingleheim, the manufacturer of nevirapine, has said down here that saquinavir blood levels are reduced by 37% when combined with nevirapine, but it is not clinically significant. If you are going to combine a NNRTI with saquinavir it appears as though delavirdine is preferable. Interaction studies of nevirapine with indinavir and ritonavir are ongoing.</p>

<p>The CD4 and RNA data in a number of different studies of delavirdine were presented. The efficacy data has similarities to the nevirapine data and will be comprehensively reported here upon return to New York.</p>

<p>As with nevirapine, a mild, moderate or severe rash can occur with use of delavirdine. Delavirdine, like nevirapine and the 3 approved protease inhibitors are processed through the CYT P450 system in the liver. Therefore, there is potential for elevated LFTs.</p>

<P><b><a name="2">2</a>. 141W94--the new Glaxo Welcome protease inhibitor</b></p>

<p>For the first time, Glaxo presented much anticipated preliminary efficacy and safety data for 141. It is based upon a small number of study participants and is only 4 weeks of data. It is too soon to make any judgments about the usefulness of this drug but this initial report is favorable. CD4, viral load and safety data were presented for 4 dose regimens--300 mg bid, 300 mg tid, 900 mg bid, 1200 mg bid. This study is intended to examine safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics, antiviral activity, CD4; subjects are protease inhibitor naive with CD4 between 150 to 400 cells. Baseline RNA was 4.83 log (I'm guessing now that is about 70,000 copies/ml-I don't have my calculator with me) and baseline CD4 was 280.</p>

<p>The RNA reduction from baseline for the 1200 mg bid dose was 1.95 log at 3 weeks and 1.5 log at 4 weeks. 10 individuals were enrolled in this arm. The CD4 increase was about 125 cells after 4 weeks. The 4-week RNA data was based on 4 individuals. The 1/2 log rebound from 3 to 4 weeks may have been due to one individual's RNA rebound who may have stopped taking drug.</p>

<p>3 individuals had lumbar punctures done to assess CSF penetration. It appears as though 1% of the plasma concentration was present in the CSF. From animal studies, a higher CSF penetration was expected but these results are early.</p>

<p>Preliminarily, 141W94 appears to be tolerable, shows good antiviral activity, study subjects felt good from taking the drug, and the side effect profile was acceptable.</p>

<p>We can expect larger clinical studies to begin this fall. </p>

<p><b><a name="3">3</a>. RITONAVIR+SAQUINAVIR</b><p>

<p>The <a href="v7.html">initial report of the Vancouver data</a> was reported on this NATAP website.</p>

<p>In Vancouver, the initial 6 weeks of efficacy and safety data were presented from this small (about 30 individuals per regimen) pilot open-label study for 2 of the 4 dosing regimens being explored in this study. Those taking 400 mg ritonavir bid + 400 mg saquinavir bid experienced about a 2.14 log RNA reduction and about a 70 CD4 increase from baseline after 6 weeks; about 50% of this group had undetectable RNA (under 200 copies/ml as measured by Roche PCR). Those subjects taking 600 mg ritonavir bid + 400 mg saquinavir bid experienced about a 2.42 log reduction and a 115 CD4 increase from baseline after 6 weeks; about 65% of this group had undetectable RNA (lower limit of measure--200 copies/ml). The side effect profile did not appear to be any different than that for ritonavir monotherapy. The discontinuation rate was relatively low. Refer to the <a href="../drug/ritsaq.html">post-Vancouver NATAP report</a> of saquinavir+ritonavir for more comprehensive details.</p>

<p>At this meeting, 12 weeks of efficacy and safety data were presented for the two afore-mentioned dose regimen groups, and 6 weeks of data were presented for 2 additional dose regimen groups. Those taking 400 mg ritonavir bid + 400 mg saquinavir bid experienced about a 2.74 RNA reduction and an 91 CD4 increase from baseline after 12 weeks; about 75% had undetectable RNA (lower limit of measure--200 copies/ml). Those taking 600 mg ritonavir bid + 400 mg saquinavir bid experienced a 3.06 RNA reduction and 113 CD4 increase from baseline after 12 weeks; about 70% had undetectable RNA (below 200 copies/ml). There was a difference in the baseline RNA between these 2 dose regimen groups; this could account for the differential in % undetectable between the 2 groups. The baseline RNA numbers are available in the NATAP post-Vancouver report of this combination.</p>

<p>For the 2 additional dose regimen groups, the first 6 weeks of data were presented. Those taking 400 mg RTV tid (3X/day) + 400 mg tid SQV experienced a 2.09 RNA log reduction and 74 CD4 increase from baseline after 6 weeks; about 30% had undetectable RNA at 6 weeks. Those taking 600 mg RTV + 600 mg SQV experienced a 2.19 RNA log reduction and an 88 CD4 increase from baseline after 6 weeks; about 45% had undetectable RNA (below 200 copies).</p>

<p>The differences between treatment regimens in the above RNA and CD4 responses were not statistically significant. It is still uncertain which of the 4 dose regimens may be superior. The tid regimen appears to cause more side effects and therefore may be the least preferable. But, the efficacy data for all the groups is similar. We do not yet know the longer term durability of these benefits nor the longer term safety profile. Follow-up studies utilizing the combination of saquinavir+ritonavir in 4-drug regimens are planned. Even a 5-drug therapy may be planned.</p>

<p><b>Discontinuations</b>-- 9 in total, but 5 from the 400+400 tid group. Individuals taking this tid regimen will be offered a bid regimen. Asymptomatic triglyceride elevations have been observed and ought to be followed for individuals taking ritonavir+saquinavir.</p>

<p><a name="4"><b>4</a>. DMP-266, a new NNRTI</b></p>

<p>This double-blind pilot study was meant to evaluate antiviral activity, tolerability, pharmacokinetics of DMP-266 alone and in combination with indinavir. This is the first efficacy data available for this new drug from DuPont-Merck. Of the 16 patients enrolled 11 received DMP-266 monotherapy for 2 weeks and 5 received placebo. 13 subjects were antiretroviral experienced and one was protease inhibitor experienced. After 2 weeks open-label indinavir 800mg tid was provided to all study subjects. 14 weeks of data are presented for both groups--11 subjects added indinavir (IDV) to DMP-266 after 2 weeks of monotherapy with DMP-266, the other group received IDV monotherapy after 2 weeks of placebo.</p>

<p>The mean baseline CD4 was 221 cells and the mean baseline plasma RNA was 131,825 copies/ml.</p>

<p>The dosing regimen for DMP-266 is 200 mg once per day. After 2 weeks of monotherapy with DMP-266, the mean RNA reduction from baseline was about 1.68 log (98% suppression) and the CD4 increase in CD4 was about 96 cells.</p>

<p>After 12 weeks of combination treatment with DMP-266 and indinavir, a mean reduction of 3.20 log. The mean CD4 increases were about 125 cells. 6/11 (55%) subjects receiving combination therapy had undetectable viral load (below 400 copies/ml).</p>

<p>DMP-266 decreased indinavir plasma concentrations by about 37%. No significant changes in DMP-266 pharmacokinetics parameters were observed after addition of indinavir.</p>

<p>No subjects discontinued during study. 4 individuals taking the combination experienced skin reactions; all were characterized as mild. Future studies are being planned.</p>

<p><b><a name="5">5</a>. Clinical Endpoint Study of 3TC</b></p>

<P>This was a double-blind, randomized trial comparing clinical efficacy and safety of 3TC or 3TC+loviride, a NNRTI (LVR) vs. placebo, and conducted overseas. CD4 criteria: 50-250. 1892 study subjects at entry were taking either AZT, AZT+ddI or AZT+ddC and were randomized to add either 3TC (150 mg bid), 3TC+LVR (100 mg tid) or placebo for an intended 52 weeks, as DSMB (Data Safety Monitoring Board) recommended trial termination before reaching 52 weeks.</p>

<title>NATAP: CNS Penetration and HIV</title>
</head>

<a href="../index.html"><h4 align=center>National AIDS Treatment Advocacy Project</h4></a>

<h3>CNS Penetration and HIV</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The subject of viral replication in the CNS and brain and treatment of it was briefly addressed by David Ho at the Vancouver Conference. As well, in discussions with Abbott and an oral session, I brought up this subject hoping to learn more about it. In my final report on the Conference I discuss what Ho said about CNS penetration.</p>

<p>He said the CNS was one of a number of "compartments" (including lymph nodes and testes) for which are important to study. With potent therapy that can lower plasma RNA at least two logs or to very low levels, we can lower plasma RNA to "undetectable" levels. In the study of nelfinavir/AZT/3TC in treatment-naive individuals (the first study in this population), described in the <a href="v7.html">final day's report</a>, 11/11 subjects achieved a reduction in their viral load measurement to below 25 copies. A noteworthy achievement with significant implications. However, if we are able to "drain" HIV from plasma, what can we achieve in these other "compartments?"</p>

<p>Ho and Martin Markowitz will soon be intiating lymph node biopsies on these study subjects to detect the therapeutic affect in this widely agreed upon important "compartment."</p>

<p>Ho said the CNS was an important but difficult "compartment" to reach with therapy. He said there aren't enough HIV drugs that penetrate the CNS and, for those that do, they don't penetrate well enough.</p>

<p>Having said that, Glaxo Wellcome says their two new important HIV antiviral drugs (1592U89 and 141W94) both penetrate the CNS well. In fact, based on the early animal studies, the CNS penetration was so high for 141W94 (protease inhibitor), that some researchers have commented to me that the penetration may be so high as to cause complications, such as headaches. Glaxo's 1592U89, a reverse-transcriptase inhibitor whose RNA and CD4 data is impressive, also apparently penetrates the CNS well. In fact, Glaxo will be conducting a study of this drug in individuals with HIV clinically diagnosed dementia (see the article on <a href="../drug/1592.html">1592U89</a>).</p>

<p>At the Vancouver Conference, I discussed the CNS penetration of ritonavir with Abbott officials. They say that, although it seems as though CNS penetration may be minimal by ritonavir, the development of CNS or brain related conditions were reduced by therapy with ritonavir, as was evidenced by the data from their endpoint study #247 in advanced HIV disease. You will be able to check the list of opportunistic infections whose incidence were reduced during that study in the NATAP Protease Inhibitor Report; a booklet now being updated with information and data from Vancouver, available in the near future.</p>

<title>NATAP: Thursday in Vancouver July 11</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff">

<a href="../index.html"><h4 align=center>National AIDS Treatment Advocacy Project</h4></a>

<h3>Thursday in Vancouver July 11</h3>

<blockquote>


<p>This Conference was extremely upbeat and exciting as data from protease inhibitor studies continue to grab the limelight with promising findings. This is the last day of the Conference and most packed with data. This data is the highlight of the Conference and will be the subject of newspaper and TV headlines worldwide. Yesterday, Abbott and Roche held a press conference to announce their 6 weeks of data on the combination of ritonavir and saquinavir. Today, Merck presented their updated data for the 3-drug study of indinavir and AZT/3TC. Data from an important trial of nelfinavir/AZT/3TC in a previously unstudied population (treatment-naive individuals) was presented suggesting that treatment of HIV should be "early and hard." The importance of viral load in predicting disease progression was underscored here. Announced to the world was the end of monotherapy treatment of HIV, as the era of combination therapy is being ushered in. </p>

<p>These promising results follow the discussion of the talks by David Ho and Giuseppe Pantaleo regarding HIV pathogenesis. Additionally, there was extensive discussion about the potential for "eradicating" the virus or making HIV a chronic, manageable disease. These latter concepts created controversy, but it was clearly and repeatedly underscored that these concepts are theoretical at this point, concepts that need and will get further attention.</p>

<p>Ho said we now have a new understanding of viral dynamics, which sheds new light on our understanding of HIV. He is referring to the discovery and understanding of the high production rate of viral replication by himself, George Shaw, and others. From the very beginning after infection, HIV replicates very productively. Within 3-9 months an individual's immune system creates an "equilibrium" or balance between viral replication and their own immune system. Through the work of Ho, Shaw and others we have come to understand the rates of viral production.</p>

<p>Ho and Pantaleo both agreed that viral factors are not the sole determinant of the course of HIV progression, but they serve as the "engine" for the virus; HIV is a viral disease, not some poorly characterized syndrome. He said constant viral replication causes constant CD4 destruction and increased replication causes faster progression. However, viral factors are not the only determinant in HIV status or progression. </p>

<p>Repeated references have been made here about what measures of virus need to be done aside from RNA: lymph nodes, latently or chronically infected cells and macrophages, the CNS, and the testes were indicated by David Ho as compartments that need exploration. He said CNS penetration is a concern because many drugs don't penetrate that compartment, and the ones that do may not do so adequately.</p>

<p><b>Indinavir/AZT/3TC</b><br>
Roy Gulick of NYU presented the data update for the Merck study #035 which created excitement at the Human Retrovirus Conference in Washington in January 1996. This trial compares AZT/3TC and indinavir (IDV) to IDV monotherapy and AZT/3TC. The participants had extensive AZT pre-treatment but were protease inhibitor naive and, importantly, 3TC-naive. It is important to consider the number of evaluable study subjects for the 3-drug combination: 28 at baseline, 27 at 24 weeks, 24 at 36 weeks and only 9 at 48 weeks.</p>

<ul>
<li>RNA: Average RNA reductions at 24 and 36 weeks were 2 log and at 48 weeks were 2.3 log (n=9)
<p>
<li>The proportion of patients with undetectable virus: at 24 weeks for IDV/AZT/3TC group--90%; IDV monotherapy--40%; at 36 weeks--82% for IDV/AZT/3TC and 40% for IDV monotherapy; at 48 weeks--84% for 3-drug group and 55% for monotherapy group
<p>
<li>CD4: The CD4 increases were about 130 cells at 36 weeks; although the increases at 44 weeks were significantly higher (220 cells) Gulick cautioned that this number is for only 9 patients
</ul>

<p><b>Ritonavir and Saquinavir: combination study</b><br>
This trial breaks new ground in the research of treatment of HIV because it is the first study of combining two protease inhibitors. William Cameron from the University of Ottawa presented 6 weeks of preliminary efficacy and safety data for this ongoing effort. Four different dosing regimens are being studied in a treatment-experienced study group. This initial data is based on two dose-regimen groups: 400 mg./bid (every 12 hrs) ritonavir (RTN) combined with 400 mg/bid saquinavir (SAQ); and 600 mg/bid ritonavir combined with 400 mg/bid saquinavir.

<ul>
<li>RNA: The baseline RNA was just under 100,000 for this collective group. At 6 weeks, in the 600 mg/RTN-400 mg/SAQ group: the average RNA reduction for both groups collectively was about 2.5 log; about 65% were below the level of detection (200 copies by PCR); about 85% were either undetectable or had a 2 log reduction in RNA. On the graph the RNA was still trending down.
<p>
<li>CD4: The average baseline CD4 was 200-300 cells. At 6 weeks the CD4 increases were 80-100 cells. On the graph the CD4 was trending up at 6 weeks.
</ul>

<p>The combination so far appears to be safe, which was of primary importance to explore in this study.</p>

<p>Both William Cameron and Martin Markowitz cautioned that this data is preliminary because it is only 6 weeks, and we don't yet know either the longer-term safety of this combination nor the longer-term durability of this combination. However, both Cameron and Markowitz spoke of the fact that, in the real world, both drugs were approved and that both doctors and patients were experimenting with this combination without the benefit of even this preliminary data. They also spoke of the importance for this combination to individuals with extensive treatment experience and possibly without any other viable treatment options.</p>

<p>That is why I've been strongly urging Merck, Roche and Abbott for two years now to more quickly assess the combination of 2 protease inhibitors. Unfortunately, we have had to wait for this still preliminary data. Other combination protease inhibitor studies are still in planning stages. For a further discussion of this subject see these 2 articles on NATAP web-site: "<a href="../drug/vanc.html">Pre-Vancouver Protease Inhibitor Update</a>" and "<a href="../papers/combo.html">We Need Protease Inhibitor Combination Studies</a>."

<p>I will have more detailed data to present on this study upon returning to NYC.</p>

<p><b>Nelfinavir and AZT/3TC</b><Br>
Another important trial examines 12 treatment-naive and chronically infected subjects (11 subjects remain in study, as one withdrew). This open-label trial addresses the hypothesis that treatment of HIV with a potent triple therapy should begin early in the course of progression of HIV disease. A vital controversial question that remains even with the following positive results from this study: how early is early?</p>

<ul>
<li>RNA: Baseline: mean- 209,011 RNA copies; median- 81,270 RNA copies; range- 17,990-864,900;
<p>
<dt>At 8 weeks, viral load reached undetectable levels after a decline of about 2.6 log (below 500, as measured by bDNA-2nd generation test). At 16 weeks, the RNA remains undetectable for subjects. In fact, the RNA levels of all study subjects is under 25 copies as measured by a very sensitive test available only in the lab. All 11 subjects had achieved negativity in PBMC co-cultures by 12 weeks of therapy, with a mean RNA reduction of 2.62 log
<p>
<li>CD4: Baseline CD4: mean 258, median 253, range 37-557; increases in CD4 cells are about 100 cells at 16 weeks.
</ul>
<p>Following the predicted 2.0 log reduction in plasma RNA in the first 2-3 weeks, the "second phase" of viral decay was slower. David Ho estimated the second phase of viral decay may take about 3 weeks and then viral load is reduced to undetectability.</p>

<p>Future studies of these individuals are being actively planned, to determine the viral levels in other "compartments" after plasma becomes very low in plasma; lymph node biopsies will be conducted to assess viral levels in this "compartment."</p>

<p><b>ddI and Hydroxyurea (HU)</b><Br>
A 1-year study of these two drugs was presented, which the presenter said confirmed their synergistic effect. The dosing regimen: 400 mg ddI/day and 15/mg/kg/day of HU (500 mg/BID). The trial examines tolerance, viral RNA and CD4. Study design: 25 asymptomatic adults, over 200 CD4, treatment-naive, follow-up at 180 and 360 days. The presenter characterized the tolerance of the treatment as good overall with no treatment interruptions. </p>

<ul>
<li>CD4 Changes: CD4 increased by an average of 163 cells (from 482 to 575). Individuals who managed to achieve undetectable RNA had better CD4 improvement, averaging over 200 cell increases.
<p>
<li>RNA Changes: Average baseline RNA was 29,396 but those with lower RNA at baseline were more able to achieve undetectable RNA as measured by PCR. At 180 days, 13/24 had undetectable RNA, and the other 11/24 had average RNA of 1,914. After 360 days, 10/20 had undetectable RNA, and the other 10/20 averaged 2,440 copies.
</ul>
<p>The presenter, Jorge Vila, commented that HU may slow CD4 response; he suggested a lower dose may be useful.</p>

<p>Lymph nodes were studied at 360 days:</p>

<ul>
<li>5/6 study subjects had no infectious virus in lymph node mononuclear cells,

<li>5/6 had no infectious virus in the lymph node CD4 cells,

<li>5/6 were undetectable (2) or slightly above the threshold of detectability for HIV RNA.

<li>1/6 had positive infectious virus in PBMC and CD4 cells, and had clearly positive HIV RNA (268,696 copies).
</ul>

<p>In the Conference abstract for this study it refers to only 10 patients at 360 days, probably because the data on 20 was accumulated after publication. The abstract says: 4/10 showed an average reduction in plasma viremia of 1.69 log (from 85,838 to 4,330 copies), with an average increase in CD4 of 53 cells (from 325 to 378). The six patients with undetectable virus at 360 days also were undetectable at 180 days.</p>

<p><b>ddI/d4T</b><br>
This trial has been ongoing as data was presented at the January Human Retrovirus Conference. This presentation updates the data. Richard Pollard said ddI/d4T are additive to synergistic in vitro. Study design: 75 treatment-naive individuals, 200-500 CD4, 52-week study.</p>

<p>Five different dosing combinations were explored, which I will detail in a post-Vancouver report. As well, then I will discuss all the details of this study.</p>

<ul>
<li>Baseline CD4s were about 330 cells; after 52 weeks the CD4 increases were about 70 cells.
<p>
<li>RNA reductions were 1.2 log for all dosing groups collectively at 4 weeks, and this reduction was sustained at about 1.4 log out to 52 weeks. There were only 15 individuals in each dose regimen group, so therefore out to 52 weeks the number of individuals upon which this data is based is small in number.
<p>
<dt>At 28 weeks, based on data for 36 evaluable subjects, 10 subjects had at least a 1 log reduction in viral RNA; and 6 subjects had a reduction of at least 2 log.
</ul>

<p><b>1592U89</b><br>
See the article on the NATAP web-site which comprehensively discusses the data for this nucleoside analogue up to this point: "<a href="../drug/1592.html">1592U89: An Important New Anti-HIV Drug</a>." In that prior report, data was available only for one dose-regimen group, that is 200 mg/tid. Significant RNA and CD4 improvements were indicated both as monotherapy and in combination with AZT. Utilizing the higher dosing regimens of 300 mg/bid and 400 mg/tid, dose dependent improvements in CD4 and viral load were observed. In combination with AZT, RNA reductions were sustained at 1.7 to 2.5 log after 12 weeks of therapy. As well, for those individuals taking 1592 monotherapy RNA and CD4 improvements were sustained after 12 weeks of therapy: RNA--1.5 to 2.2 log.</p>

<p>CD4 benefits were sustained with increases of 80-100 cells for all groups after 12 weeks of therapy.</p>

<p>Further details will be forthcoming on this study in Conference reports after I return from Vancouver. Because it's 8 pm and I'm tired and now I have to leave to meet a group for dinner.</p>

<p>See you all back in the USA. </p>

<title>NATAP: Wednesday in Vancouver, July 10</title>

<h3>Wednesday in Vancouver, July 10</h3>

<blockquote>


<p>Last night I went to a Glaxo Wellcome meeting where the updated data for 1592U89 was previewed for us as the data won't be officially presented until Thursday (see <a href="../drug/1592.html">article about 1592U89</a>). Glaxo requested that I not reveal the data before their official presentation tomorrow. So, stay tuned.</p>

<p>Also, they discussed plans for development of 141W94 (their protease inhibitor), and although the plans discussed were tentative, they seem to have a good approach to designing a broad spectrum of studies for 141W94. As you know, we are in a new era where 3 protease inhibitors are approved and available; this complicates the design of trials for all drugs, but even moreso for a protease inhibitor. It is expected that Glaxo will soon be moving ahead with these trials.</p>

<p><b>AZT/3TC and <a href="../drug/vct.html">nelfinavir</a> (Agouron's protease inhibitor)</b><br>
This morning I viewed a poster presentation of a trial studying this combination. I will outline the vital information and discuss it in more detail after returning from the Conference. This is an important small pilot trial of treatment-naive individuals, that is open-label, and examines safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy.</p>

<p>Data was presented for 12 study subjects with median baseline RNA of 81,270 (4.91, with a range of 17,990-864-900) and median CD4 baseline of 253 (with a range of 37-557). </p>

<p>Subjects received AZT (200 mg 3X/day), 3TC (150 mg 2X/day), and nelfinavir (750 mg 3X/day).</p>

<p><b>SAFETY</b>. No serious side effects reported.</p>
<ul>
<li>1/12 withdrew at week 6 for grade 2 diarrhea
<li>diarrhea most common adverse event: mild to moderate
<li>nausea and fatigue common during first 2 weeks
</ul>

<p>The data is preliminary as the ongoing study follows individuals out to 16 weeks. By 8 weeks, the RNA reduction for the 12 subjects averaged 2.6 logs and then proceeded to be undetectable for the remaining 8 weeks as measured by the second generation bDNA viral load test which measures down to 500 RNA copies. After 16 weeks the CD4s were up about 100 cells from baseline. Actualy, all 11 subjects had under 25 RNA copies by 16 weeks, as measured by a sensitive laboratory research RNA test. Some subjects will be undergoing lymph node biopsies to discover the activity of virus in this "compartment" and to discern whether we can drain the virus from the lymph nodes.</p>

<p>I have to run now to cover the afternoon sessions.</p>

<h3>July 9 in Vancouver--Afternoon session</h3>

<blockquote>


<p>I just heard a presentation about the 3rd generation Upjohn protease inhibitor---U-140690. The 2nd generation had a problem with protein binding. Upjohn says this 3rd generation has improved potency and antiviral activity, and that there are only 6 steps in the chemical processing of this drug and it has two chiral centers. The drug seemed to have good plasma concentrations well above the EC-90 for 6 to 8 hours in animal models.</p>

<p>In vitro experiments seemed indicate little cross-resistance with ritonavir. And that was with both pre- and post- treatment with ritonavir. Upjohn promised to talk about mutation profile but in this oral presentation they did not talk about it, although they say their protease has a unique mutation profile.</p>

<p>Phase I trials are expected to begin before the end of 1996.</p>

<p><b>Integrase Inhibitors</b><br>
An oral presentation was given this afternoon by Edward Robinson of the University of California-Irvine. He said that potent new small molecule candidates have been discovered that block HIV in tissue culture. These are natural products, some of which have been synthesized. One of them is from a Bolivian plant. </p>

<p>He said these compounds are non-toxic and seem to have potent antiviral activity. They appear to block the integrase process. Some of the candidates are more potent than others. However, there are some problems with developing an integrase inhibitor. One limitation may be that once a cell is infected, an integrase inhibitor may be ineffectual. The current crop of potential integrase inhibitors may not be specific enough to inhibit HIV.</p>

<p>I have to go now to attend some evening meetings which will run til 9 pm. </p>

<h3>Day One of Conference Monday, July 8</h3>

<blockquote>


<p>Today was the first day of actual conference meetings. I'm writing this report to you from beautiful hot downtown Vancouver, at 3:30 pm, in between afternoon sessions, in the Vancouver Trade and Convention Center. Parked right outside is a passenger ship headed for Alaska.</p>

<p>It is very difficult if not impossible to cover all the important meetings. Frequently, there are 2 and 3 meetings being simultaneously conducted. Sunday, at 9 am I attended a pre-conference meeting sponsored by Merck; at 11:30 to 2 pm, I attended a pre-conference meeting sponsored by Glaxo Wellcome.</p>

<p>The title of the meeting sponsored by Merck was "Changing the Paradigm: Emerging Strategies in the Treatment of HIV disease." David Ho, MD, of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center discussed his work on "viral dynamics and HIV." He talked about the initial burst of virus that generally peaks within the first months after sero-conversion; after which the immune system creates an equilibrium with viral replication, whereby viral load settles in at a level called the "set point." For an in-depth discussion of this concept you can read the article "<a href="../drug/hivrna.html">Viral Load: Important Information</a>," or the more updated booklet recently published by NATAP called "Perspectives on Viral Load and When To Initiate Therapy."</p>

<p>Viral load can settle (at the "set point") at a low, medium or high level for any given individual. However, from the beginning of infection viral replication is very productive. David Ho suggested that individuals should "hit hard and early" with treatment. His reasoning, and the reasoning of other researchers who support this position, is that your immune system is still intact, your CD4s are still preserved, your virus is relatively homogenous and therefore more responsive to therapy. Other researchers recommend taking a more cautious approach. They suggest not spending your treatment options, but that keeping viral load in check at a "lower level" may be adequate. The researchers that recommend "hit early and hard" say other drugs and treatment options will be available. At this point in time, this is a controversial subject, which is discussed in more depth in the NATAP booklet--"Perspectives on Viral Load.....," in the section titled "When to Initiate Therapy??"</p>

<p>At the Merck, and immediately afterwards at the Glaxo Wellcome meeting, John Mellors talked about the correlation between viral load both prior to treatment and subsequent to treatment and its correlation to disease progression and survival. He said viral load, although not the perfect predictor of disease progression because other factors are also involved, is the best predictor of disease progression and mortality. Although, he said, CD4 and viral load together is a better predictor. Again, this is discussed in more depth in the aforementioned NATAP booklet "Perspectives on Viral Load."</p>

<p>On Thursday at a "late-breaker" session, Dr. Roy Gulick of NYU will present updated information on study subjects in the Merck 035 study of AZT/3TC and indinavir in AZT-experienced individuals. But today, Merck talked about the results of a monotherapy study that has previously been presented, wherein a small number of patients showed sustained improvements in CD4 and viral load out to 48 weeks. At the currently recommended dose of 800 mg taken every 8 hours: at 24 weeks 6/14 (43%) subjects had undetectable viral load (under 200 copies, as measured by PCR; at 48 weeks, 7/13 (54%) had undetectable viral load. The median baseline RNA for this group was 70,795 RNA copies, and the median RNA reduction was 2.3 log at 24 weeks and 2.6 log at 48 weeks; the baseline median CD4 was 250, and the median increase in CD4 was 80 at 24 weeks and 85 at 48 weeks. It is important to keep in mind that the amount of individuals upon which this data is based is small. And, at some point in the study, individuals were permitted to add other therapies.</p>

<p>Also, Merck presented previously presented data indicating that multi-drug therapy delayed the development of resistance. This is addressed in more depth in the article "<a href="../drug/erad.html">Can HIV be Eradicated from the Infected Individual?</a>" If you can suppress viral replication to a low enough level, resistance is delayed.</p>

<p>At the Glaxo Wellcome meeting, data was presented from the studies of AZT/3TC. An analysis of 4 AZT/3TC studies combined together compared AZT/3TC to the combined control groups of AZT and AZT/ddC; 57/569 (9.9%) individuals taking AZT/3TC progressed to AIDS while 61/316 (19.2%) taking AZT or AZT/ddC progressed to AIDS; that is a 52% reduction in progression to AIDS. Updated data on 1592U89 will be presented at this Conference (see <a href="../drug/1592.html">1592U89--a New Antiviral for HIV in Development</a>).</p>

<p>A constant theme at this Conference is that combination therapy is the best way to treat HIV infection, and that treatment with AZT monotherapy or monotherapy with any approved drug is inadequate. The question remaining is when to start therapy and with what?</p>

<p>At the Agouron sponsored meeting, at 6 am Monday morning, new resistance data was presented for their protease inhibitor, nelfinavir. They took virus from a small number of individuals in which resistance to nelfinavir was "created," and exposed that virus to ritonavir, indinavir, 141W94 (Glaxo Wellcome's protease inhibitor) and saquinavir. They found that the nelfinavir resistant virus was not cross-resistant to any of those other 4 protease inhibitors. Agouron reported the discovery of a unique mutation profile for nelfinavir that differs from that reported previously. There was controversy among observers as to the reliability of the data, but a noted researcher said, "the data is the data." These findings need to be monitored as they could have important implications. Preliminary study results of a small number of individuals taking nelfinavir and d4T were presented. At 5 months, Agouron reported RNA reductions of 1.8 log to 2.4 log, and CD4 improvements of over 100 cells. David Ho presented preliminary data from a small open-label pilot study of AZT/3TC and nelfinavir of treatment-naive individuals. He reported 11/11 subjects had undetectable RNA at 16 weeks. The viral load test he used measured as low as 25 RNA copies; one of the study subjects had 600,000 RNA copies at baseline.</p>

<p>Tonight, I attended an AMFAR reception where Liz Taylor was present to make a speech. She said the federal government's refusal to support needle exchange programs is "a measured act of pre-meditated murder."</p>

<p>Today was the wrap-up of the 2-day Community Forum at the University of British Columbia campus.The Forum ended with a plenary session where recommendations were outlined for action. The day ended with an outside buffet salmon barbecue. Myself and other treatment publishers submitted a proposal to the Forum for setting up an internet communication infra-structure to disseminate treatment information globally. We expect to begin implementing plans fairly soon. We hope corporate sponsorship, possibly from a computer company like Apple or Microsoft, could be obtained.</p>

<p>Another worthy proposal was to set up a food provision model program with corporate sponsorship for a third world country. The idea is for a large food-corporation, like Beatrice or Nabisco to take the lead in assisting the establishment of this effort.</p>

<p>Participating in this Community Forum was very educational for me, because I learned about the situations of PWAs in many different countries. The plight in third world countries for PWAs is very bleak. People don't have proper nutrition, clean water, basic medical care and many other basic essentials, so a discussion of supplying them with protease inhibitors is futile. With all of the difficulties we face in the USA, our situation regarding AIDS drugs is better than in any other country.</p>

<p>Sunday is the beginning of the Int'l. Conference and "satellite symposiums." Merck, Roche and Glaxo will host symposiums on Sunday. We will begin providing reporting of treatment issues on Sunday. The Conference Opening Ceremony takes place Sunday afternoon and Conference events begin Monday morning. New longer-term data from protease inhibitor trials will be presented at the Conference. Roche, Merck, Agouron and Abbott will be presenting updates. As well, Abbott will be presenting early data from the study of ritonavir and saquinavir. The early data from the trial of sero-converters treated with a potent 3-drug therapy will be presented.</p>

<p>There will be discussion about when to initiate therapy for individuals. Treating early and hard seems to be an approach growing in popularity. Today I ran into an AIDS researcher who said he believes it is easier to suppress the virus earlier in disease because the virus is more homogenous. Earlier in the disease the immune system is more intact and, once viral replication is halted, viral load is rendered undetectable and therefore resistance cannot develop, then the viral load may remain undetectable.</p>

<p>This is still theoretical but the support for this notion among AIDS researchers is growing. I will continue to cover this issue throughout the Conference.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for further information. </p>

<h3>Day 2 in Vancouver- July 6</h3>

<blockquote>


<p>The first official day of proceedings at the Community Forum was supposed to start at 9 am. By about 10 am the "Opening Ceremony" was started with an extraordinary gathering of diverse people from all around the globe. A few Canadian conference organizers made some opening comments, but for me the most moving talk of this morning's opening session was that presented by Mary Jane Musungu of Uganda. She said HIV is a cultural socio-economic and political problem. She urged Americans to share their skills with the people from third world countries with the hope and expectation that it might help towards improving their lot.</p>

<p>The overall theme for the Community Forum is at once---global solidarity, local action and regional strategy. An opening speaker from India, Swaminathan Sundararaman, spoke of his hope from the Forum of "regional actions plans to obtain and sustain empowerment."  The Forum planning and organizing committees are composed of representatives from Canada, USA, India, Zambia, Argentina, Japan, Chile, United Kingdom, Mexico, Uganda and South Africa.</p>

<p>In Canada, their AIDS programs are all encompassed into a "National AIDS Strategy." Apparently, when the funding for these programs end in the near future, the reformist conservative government is planning to "dismantle" the program. The Canadian Prime Minister was invited to the Int'l. AIDS Conference but will not show up; his Health Minister will address the Conference, but Canadian activists are requesting that when he speaks all of the community activists rise and turn away from him.</p>

<p>The Forum organizers are hoping to achieve ambitious and idealistic goals from this Community Forum: to provide participants with a framework for collecting strategic planning and policy information; to provide an apparatus for skills building; to create international skills networking opportunities; and to provide a general orientation to the Conference for all the delegates.</p>

<p>How successful they will be is uncertain to me and others.</p>

<p>Howard Engel of Canada spoke about the need for access to drugs and medical care for third world PWAs. This is a lofty goal, but in fact many of these countries do not even offer the most basic vaccines for children nor offer basic living necessities to their citizens. The reality of providing to them protease inhibitors in combination therapy seems very ambitious.</p>

<p>Many American attendees at this forum realized that for third world countries, access to optimal antiretroviral therapy seems unlikely. Many of these countries cannot offer PCP prohylaxis to PWAs. Some Forum attendees were unsure they could offer much to the attendees from the third world. When we discussed e-mail and the Internet, it was lost on most. However, their is the possibility that some of the discussion and networking will in some way be productive to the third world.</p>

<p>A more realistic outcome from the Forum for me and NATAP is a closer working relationship with Canadian activists and possibly with Puerto Rico.</p>

<p>Anyway, tomorrow will be the 2nd and final day of the Community Forum. An official statement will emerge from the Forum. Sunday the pre-conference symposiums begin, and the conference begins with opening ceremonies Sunday evening.</p>

<title>NATAP: 1st Report From Vancouver</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff">

<a href="../index.html"><h4 align=center>National AIDS Treatment Advocacy Project</h4></a>

<h3>1st Report From Vancouver - July 4</h3>

<blockquote>


<p>I left NYC today at 8 AM and arrived in Vancouver at 1 pm. It's now 12 midnight Vancouver time and I'm back in my hotel exhausted and about to go to sleep. But I thought I'd give a brief report about the day. Vancouver seems to be a beautiful city. The temperature is cool, the sun is shining, the city is clean, new and sparkles and it is surrounded by water. I'm two blocks from what they call a beach but by my standards it doesn' measure up to a real beach, although it's on the bay and lot's of young people gather in this area to walk, bike, sunbathe, swim in the pool or bay, go boating, etc.</p>

<p>The <A HREF="http://www.interchg.ubc.ca/aids11/AIDS96.html">Int'l. AIDS Conference</a> doesn't start until the reception opens it up on Sunday evening, but Sunday morning the "satellite symposiums" start. The first is sponsored by Merck 9 am Sunday morning. The participants will be David Ho, Emilio Emini and Jeff Chadokowitz of Merck. The title of the symposium is "The New Paradigm" (see "<a href="../drug/erad.html">Can HIV be Eradicated from the Infected Individual?</a>"). I will report the highlights of this meeting to you. As well, I will be reporting other important highlights on a regular "real-time" basis. So look for my regular reports. I will try to report developments as soon as I can. I expect some important treatment news to be presented here: early results of the combination protease study of ritonavir and saquinavir; extended data results from Crixivan and Norvir studies; more data on 1592U89, Viracept, the combination of ddI/d4T; more data from saquinavir studies, etc.</p>

<p>However, today Friday and Saturday over at the Univ. of Britsh Columbia, 500 community representatives from all the developed and developing world are gathering for the purpose of sharing activist experiences. So far, my understanding of the proceedings are that American activists are to listen to the issues, concerns and needs of representatives from these foreign countries, which include many third world countries, and then for us Americans to share our experiences with activism and our suggestions for them. The purpose is to help raise the awareness and skills of the activists in these foreign countries. Some Americans said, "I have my hands full trying to serve the needs of Americans. We can't even get protease inhibitors to all of our citizens." A more idealistic American activist said we are here to try and help these third world countries to learn from us.</p>

<p>So, Friday and Saturday 100 American activists, who were selected to help them, will meet with 400 foreign reps to discuss all these concerns. It is a very ambitious goal because in many of these countries, they can't meet basic needs like PCP prophylaxis, which is very inexpensive. It seems to me that the leaders of the governments in these countries could very well afford to pay for these basic needs.</p>

<p>Good night. See you tomorrow, I am going to watch "Law and Order" on TV.</p>

<p><b>National AIDS Treatment Advocacy Project<br>
Human Retrovirus Conference<br>
January 28-February 1, 1996, Washington, DC</b></p>

<blockquote>
<h3>DAY 1: HIGHLIGHTS FROM CONFERENCE</h3>

<p>This is Jules Levin reporting up-to-the minute from the 3rd Retrovirus Conference. It's 10:30 AM and I've just returned from the "State of the Art" Lecture on Protease Inhibitors presented by Emilio Emini of Merck. It was an exciting moment in the development of treatments for HIV. The room was packed like sardines. Emini presented data on the same 5 protease inhibitors that were the subject of the NY Protease Inhibitor Forum that I (NATAP) organized and presented on Jan. 6 at NYU. In fact, most of the slides Emini presented today were shown at our Forum on Jan. 6. Of course, additional data is being presented at this conference and I'll be making it available both in our written report and at the Feb. 3 video presentation.</p>

<p><b>PROTEASE INHIBITORS</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Emini presented the some of the Merck Crixivan data: In a study of 15 patients taking Crixivan monotherapy, a median peak 2 log viral load drop was reached by 24 weeks and sustained at 48 weeks for 40% of the study participants.
<p>
<li>Emini briefly mentioned data on the ongoing AZT/3TC/Crixivan study, #035. He couldn't elaborate because Trip Gulick is presenting on this subject here on Thursday. This study has, I believe, 20 persons per treatment arm; however, in the #035 (AZT experienced population-very significant) study almost 90 % of the participants being administered the 3-drug combination had their viral load drop to undetectable and were still undetectable at 24 weeks; the median baseline viral load for the study participants was 40,000; the 24 week data from this study is as much as Merck has been able to accumulate so far. They are continuing to accumulate data from this study and we'll get more at a later date.
</ul>

<p>Based on the data in these 2 immediately above paragraphs, Emini concluded that if 40% sustained their viral load drop with monotherapy to 48 weeks, that he would expect that maybe 70% or more of those taking the 3-drug combination should have their viral load drop sustained out to at least 1 year.</p>

<p><b>WHEN TO START TREATMENT</b></p>

<P>There has been much discussion here about when to initiate therapy for HIV, both for treatment naive and experienced individuals, now that, seemingly, we now have much more potent therapies. Yesterday, at a treatment workshop Doug Richman, a noted AIDS researcher from UCSD, was strongly supporting the notion of "early" intervention with a multi-drug combination which would include a potent protease inhibitor. I asked him, how early he means? His respone was more general, but he encouraged consideration of the possibility of initiating treatment soon after sero-conversion, as well as intervention at the higher CD4 ranges. There have been other researchers here who have been encouraging the same considerations.</p>

<p>For those who are treatment experienced, some researchers here are encouraging treatment immediately with a multi-drug combination (with a potent protease inhibitor)--soon after ritonavir and Crixivan are available. I suggest to individuals that they be circumspect and give due consideration to their treatment decisions; consultation with a knowledgeable physician is recommended. Your doctor needs to be as well educated as possible on the relevant issues which include, but are not limited to: resistance, cross-resistance, the efficacy and side-effect profile of each drug, the drug interactions of each drug.</p>

<p>However, others have discouraged this "early" intervention approach until we can accumulate data on it. They encourage conducting studies to determine when would be the best times to intervene with treatments. I will tell you, that these studies will take time to gather data. In the meantime, some doctors and people with HIV may decide to try these "early" intervention approaches. In NY at the Aaron Diamond Research Center, David Ho, the Executive Director, and Martin Markowitz, the Director of Clinical Trials, have just started a trial testing this concept with a 3-drug combination (including ritonavir) on individuals who very recently sero-converted. I have learned here that there will be a White House Presidential initiative to assure the conducting of studies on how to best use these protease inhibitors.</p>

<ul>
<li>At this meeting, data will presented tomorrow (Tuesday) on the combination of AZT/ddI/Crixivan, the Abbott study of ritonavir for individuals with 100 CD4, the Abbott Frech study of ritonavir/AZT/ddC. I will send you highlights from here and full reports subsequently.
<p>
<li>Yesterday, Australian ritonavir researchers--Andrew Carr and Anthony Kelleher-- presented data on immunological improvements for those recieving ritonavir in their study. From a small study, their slides displayed a median peak improvement in CD8 cells of 900 which was still sustained at 200 above baseline at, I think, 32 weeks. There has been discussion about whether these cells are "naive" or "memory" cells, and the significance of that. Mario Roederer noted from his research--others have supported this notion as well-- that it is better to have more naive CD8 cells. I asked David Ho if this CD8 cell improvement from ritonavir treatment would include naive cells; he said, we were not yet sure, but he thinks it probably contained some measure of them.
</ul>

<p><b>IL-2</b></p>
<P>I spent time talking to NIH researcher, Cliff Lane, about IL-2. Of course, he is leading the IL-2 research effort, but he strongly believes in the treatment. There are many doubters of the efficacy of this treatment. For one reason, while there is a considerable CD4 rise, there is no viral load improvement. I have been told here that a clinical endpoint study will probably be started fairly soon to examine whether IL-2 actually has meaningful benefit; this trial will study progression to AIDS and survival.</p>

<p>OK, I have to sign off now to attend another meeting about Serono's human growth hormone, used for treatment of wasting. In late February, I will be appearing before a FDA hearing for consideration of approval. </p>

<p>Hopefully, I'll send you more updates sometime tomorrow after the Merck and Abbott presentations. </p></blockquote>

<h3>2nd DAY- Tuesday HIGHLIGHTS from 3rd Retrovirus Conference from Jules Levin</h3>

<p>I'm filing this report at 5:30 am, Wednesday morning, from my room. I'm so
stimulated from all the events down here, that I can't sleep. The days are
long and filled with meetings and presentations from 7 am til 10 pm. This 3rd
Conference seems to be a watershed event. Because of the advent of protease
inhibitors, their use in multi-drug combinations and the import of the
accumulating data about the use of viral load testing (HIV RNA), many
researchers are saying at this conference that we are truely entering a new
era for HIV treatment (which I have been saying); the accumulating viral load
data is strongly supporting its validity of predicting disease progression
and survival. The mood here is very optimistic about  future treatment of HIV
for those of us with HIV and AIDS. The discussions and presentations are
suggesting a major shift in the approaches to treatment (see Monday's <a href="day1.html">1st day
HIGHLIGHTS</a>---"When to start treatment") of the virus and to the approaches to
the research efforts of clinical trials.</p>

<p>Tuesday morning started with an exciting, progressive opening
"State-of-the-Art Lecture" by David Cooper, a noted AIDS researcher from
 down under--Australia. Dr. Cooper conducted some of the Abbott protease
inhibitor clinical trial research.  He suggested major shifts in the
approaches to treatment and clinical trials research. Cooper said, large
clinical endpoint trials ( C.E.T. study progression to AIDS and
survival--they can take years to conduct and consume resources) should no
longer be conducted, but for 3 exceptions: 
<ul type=disc>
<li> where the drug in question has
marginal benefits, or
<li> a situation like IL-2, where the immunological
benefits (rises in CD-4) are not accompanied by apparent and significant
changes in viral load, or 
<li>where you want to discover benefits of a
therapy for heavily drug pre-treated individuals. 
</ul>
Up til this point in the
history of the regulation of AIDS research, clinical endpoint studies have
been absolutely required for each and every drug before it receives approval.
Before receiving accelerated approval, an "adequate" clinical endpoint study
must be established and ongoing (by FDA regulation). </p>

<p>Cooper also called for changes in the approach to treatment. He said, we need
to study and collect data on early intervention for treatment of HIV. The
classical approach, as I understand it, by infectious disease specialists to
this type of disease (HIV), is to treat as early as possible before a virus
has a chance to gain a strong foothold in your body. Now that we have potent
drugs (protease inhibitors), we can take this approach. 
He called for studies to test a new concept, but one also suggested months
ago by John Leonard of Abbott Labs: study individuals who have oppotunistic
infections-- treat them with antivirals (protease inhibitor therapy), and
monitor them for improvements and remission. This also is a new approach to
clinical trials.

<p><b>d4t</B></P>

<p>For the first time, viral load data was presented for d4T, as studies in
treatment naive individuals. An improvement of viral load ranging from .6  to
1.0 log was presented by Christine Katlama (a French AIDS researcher), for
study particpants in a trial examing "early" intervention for individuals in
the CD4 range of 350 to 700. Further details will be reported following my
return from the conference.</p>

<p><b>D4T/ddI</B></P>

<p>Dr. Pollard, an AIDS researcher at the Univ. of Texas, presented data on the results of a study done of a combination of d4T and ddI in people with aCD4 count of 200-500. All subjects were treatment naive and, as a whole, showed significant CD4 and viral load benefits from this combo. The data is from a small group of 76 individuals but is impressive. After 52 weeks, there was a mean viral load decrease of 1.4 logs; the CD4 increase of 60 to 80 cells was sustained at 44 weeks. Further details will be reported.</p>

<P><B>HIV RNA (viral load)</B></P>

<p>The Roche assay was submitted to the FDA for review and approval in November
of 1995 (see my article, "Perspectives on Viral Load Testing", in the
<a href="http://www.smartlink.net/~martinjh/beta.txt">December issue of BETA</a>; the AIDS publication of the San Francisco AIDS
Foundation--I will have the article posted to this home page). It has been
reported to me, that an April hearing date has been set by the FDA. If all
goes well, which I expect to occur, we should have FDA approval and access to
this test by May. Much of the data on viral load, that has been accumulated
and submitted to the FDA, was presented today. It is a convincing argument
that HIV RNA is a predictor of disease progression and survival. Seemingly,
changes in viral load from the use of therapy have predictive value for
progression and survival.</>

<p>Other important information was presented at the conference today. But, I
have to sign off now to prepare for the 8:30 am, "State-of-the-Art Lecture"
by Doug Richman about "Resistance to Antiretroviral Drugs". If you don't get
down to the lobby early for breakfast it becomes too crowded to eat. Other
important subjects from yesterday, that I will report on are: longer term
AZT/3TC data, the Abbott protease inhibitor French study of
ritonavir/AZT/ddC, impressive but early results of a new antiviral from Glaxo
Wellcome--1592U89, a new Ciba-Geigy protease inhibitor about to enter a phase
I trial, and the impressive  6-month data results of the Merck study of
indinavir/AZT/ddI.</p>

<p><b>PROTEASE INHIBITORS</b><br>
Conference Highlights from days 3 &amp; 4</p>

<p>It's Friday morning and I'm back in NY from what was an exhausting but exhilarating and exciting Conference. The promise of protease inhibitors and viral load utility provides us with the best case of optimism we've had to date. Of course, so far, the clinical endpoint data currently available to us, on protease inhibitors, is limited to the Abbott study described below. So, it remains to be seen how long the benefits from these drugs will last. However, the Merck data presented (see my earlier highlight article--<a href="day1.html">day 1</a>-- on this subject) is very encouraging regarding prolonged benefit.  With the combination of Crixivan/AZT/3TC, 6/7 study participants (a small number, but soon we'll have data on additional individuals) still had undetectable viral load as far out as we yet have data (6 months). Additionally, it is encouraging to consider that with Crixivan monotherapy 40% of study participants remained undetectable at 48 weeks. Also presented at this conference is an accumulation of data indicating that viral load changes are predictive of disease progression and survival. This accumulation process is ongoing, as data submission to the FDA is also ongoing, for review and approval of Roche's application for expedited review of its RT-PCR test (viral load). An FDA hearing, to consider approval of this test, is scheduled for April 1.</p>

<p>Also, we still need to further explore how best to utilize these drugs. Further studies will need to be conducted, to examine protease inhibitor therapy for "early intervention" treatment--(determine when may be the best time to intervene in disease progression), sero-conversion treatment, the sequencing of the use of each different inhibitor--cross-resistance data will be crucial for this subject, the combination of 2 protease inhibitors, etc. I expect these studies will be conducted, but it is important to keep the pressure on the drug companies and the ACTG-NIH to quickly initiate this work and to do it comprehensively.</p>

<p><b>HIGHLIGHTS</b><br>
(For more expanded details, NATAP's written report on protease inhibitors, with the very latest and most comprehensive data, will soon be available, both by mail and possibly from this site):</p>

<p>(1)--The data from the Abbott French study has been updated to 6 months. In this open-label drug combination, all participants received---ritonavir/AZT/ddC. Study entry criteria: CD4 50-250 or a drop of 200 to a level less than 350 over a recent 6 month period or 250-350 with symptoms, treatment naive, with 32 participants enrolled (11 discontinued during the study--2 for hepatic toxicity). All participants had an initial 2-week treatment with ritonavir and then AZT/ddC was added. The viral load reductions were as follows: 1.8 log at 4 weeks, 2.2 log at 8 weeks, 2.3 log at 16 weeks, 2.4 log at 20 weeks and 2.1 log at 24 weeks. At 5 months, approximately 40% of participants had undetectable viral load. This data from this study is based upon a small number of individuals over a brief length of time (6 months, so far). It is important to consider this, in interpreting the data and applying the findings. The mean increases in CD4 are (baseline=160 CD4, n=32): 124 at 4 weeks (n=29), 125 at 8 weeks (n=27), 125 at 16 weeks (n=25), 143 at 20 weeks (n=20), 154 at 24 weeks (n=17). The mean CD4% (baseline=12%): 16% at week 4, 17% at week 16, 20% at week 20, 20% at week 24.</p>

<P>(2)--- Abbott's findings from a study of ritonavir, on Thursday morning, was met with excitement and was a well-attended late-breaker session (where Merck also presented their data for Crixivan/AZT/3TC). Study entry criteria: CD4 less than 101, at least 9 months previous drug treatment, concurrent treatment with up to but no more than 2 approved anti-retroviral drugs (3TC was excluded--was not approved at the start of this study), no active opportunistic infections (but you could have had prior OIs). Some of the concurrent antiviral therapies, that individuals were using included: AZT/d4T, AZT/ddI, ddC, ddI, d4T and AZT. The most widely used was monotherapy with AZT or d4T. Study participants were taking on average, 11 concomitant drugs while in study. </p>

<p>Although the study had 1,090 participants, for the sub-study examining viral load and CD4 changes, the n=159 and 215 respectively. The mean changes in viral load: 1.3 log at 2 weeks, 1.2 log at 4 weeks, 1.0 log at 8 weeks, .9 log at 12 weeks, .6 log at 16 weeks. The mean increase in CD4 (at baseline--mean CD4 about 28): 25 cells at 2 weeks, 40 cells at 4 weeks, 42 cells at 8 weeks, 40 cells at 12 weeks, 45 cells at 16 weeks. The mean increase in CD8 cells (baseline--mean CD8 about 475): 175 CD8 at 4 weeks, 300 CD8 at 8 weeks, 220 CD8 at 12 weeks, 200 at 16 weeks. </p>

<p>The very crucial data on PROGRESSION or DEATH: There was about a 42% reduction in death. For those individuals receiving ritonavir, the rate of death was 4.8% (n=543, 26 deaths). For the placebo group, the rate of death was 8.4% (n=547, 46 deaths). There was a 58% reduction in AIDS or death (this represents a combination of statistics for progression to AIDS and death)--for those taking ritonavir; there was a total of 85 such events for individuals taking ritonavir (out of an n=543)--15.7%; for those taking placebo--there was a total of 181 such events (for a total n=547)--33.1%. </p>

<p>The most common clinical endpoints were: death (as 1st event) 17--taking ritonavir, 27--taking placebo; esophageal candidiasis: 16--taking ritonavir, 38--taking placebo; CMV retinitis: 13--taking ritonavir, 17--taking placebo; PCP: 9--taking ritonavir, 16--taking placebo; CMV (other): 3--taking ritonavir, 13--taking placebo; wasting syndrome: 2--taking ritonavir, 8--taking placebo; lymphoma: 3--taking ritonavir, 6--taking placebo; Kaposi's Sarcoma: 8 taking ritonavir, 22--taking placebo. Important to remember, is the side effect profile of ritonavir: rises in triglycerides and cholesterol, rises in liver enzymes measurement--ALT & AST, rises in GGT. The dropout rate for those taking ritonavir was 15%, but only 7% in the placebo group.</p> 

<p>Another consideration is the <a href="../drug/norvir.html">list of drugs</a>, issued by Abbott, that are NOT to be co-administered with ritonavir. This list consists of about 25 drugs, including Rifabutin. Please, adhere to these guidelines; consult your physician about which drugs you can and cannot take along with ritonavir. Oftentimes, there is a substitute that can be taken instead of the prohibited drug. The development of cross-resistance, to other protease inhibitors, from treatment with ritonavir, is also a concern.</p>

<P><b>COMMENTARY</b>: When considering the viral load performance of this drug in this specific study, it is important to remember that the population being studied is very advanced: with the mean CD4 at baseline about 28. Being an advanced disease group, this could mean their virus population was more heterogenous than a group with significantly higher CD4 and lower viral load. Therefore, viral mutation can advance more efficiently than in a less advanced population. In the Crixivan/AZT/3TC study, where the early data looks good (see below), the study population was not as advanced in their stage of disease; the baseline CD4 was 142. In addition, in the Abbott study, there were compliance problems. Ritonavir was administered in a very distasteful liquid. Some study participants receiving ritonavir may not have taken the drug as they were supposed to, but told study coordinators that they were taking it according to instructions.</p> 

<p>In the New England Journal of Medicine--Dec. 7, 1995, data was reported by Martin Markowitz et al, on an earlier Abbott trial. When a sensitive assay was used in a small subgroup of 20 patients (the total of participants enrolled were 62), they found viral load decreased by a mean of 1.7 log. At 12 weeks, it was at 1.1 log. The mean maximal decrease, reached at week 8, was 1.94 log. Although, this data is based on only 20 individuals, it brings into question the RNA results of the less than 101 CD4 study, presented at the Conference. But, it is uncertain how sustained this viral load response was, for this study discussed above from the New England Jnl. of Med. Also, the ritonavir administered for this 20-person sub-study was a capsule, not the liquid, which lends itself better to compliance. My point is, it is difficult to compare different studies. The side effect profile detected from this earlier study: liver enzymes, cholesterol, and triglycerides increased significantly during week 1. Elevations in cholesterol and triglycerides persisted through the 32 weeks of the study; there were increases from baseline of 30 to 40% for cholesterol and of 200 to 300% for triglycerides.</p>

<p>(3) Agouron was denied from presenting their data at the Conference, but a special meeting was convened across the street in a different hotel, where they presented their data. This drug is much earlier in its development stage than the other 3 inhibitors--saquinavir (already approved and available in the pharmacy), Abbott's ritonavir and Merck's Crixivan.  We have not yet been notified of the emergence of any additional side effects. </p>

<p>They stated, in vitro data indicated a synergy of VIRACEPT with AZT, ddC, 3TC and additive benefit with AZT and 3TC. They presented their studies examining different dosing regimens. The data from protocol #510 was presented. At baseline there were only 40 participants. Study entry criteria: d4T naive, CD4 greater than 200, viral load greater than 15,000, AZT naive or experienced. The bDNA assay used measures RNA down to 500 copies; below that level of 500 is considered undetectable. </p>

<p>It is very important to remember, that the amount of information and data on this drug is more limited than available for the Merck and Abbott inhibitors; therefore, it's premature to judge the efficacy and safety of this drug on an evaluation of such few individuals over such a short period of time. The data available for this study extends only to 45 days. The study is still accruing, but, it appears, the mean CD4 at baseline is about 300 or slightly higher. The baseline RNA is between 50,00 to 70,000. There are 4 study arms: VIRACEPT 500 mg. 3x daily + d4T, VIRACEPT 750 mg. 3x daily + d4T, VIRACEPT 1000 mg. 3x daily + d4T, and d4T without VIRACEPT. At only 28 days, for about 24 evaluable participants, the CD4 increases for those receiving VIRACEPT/d4T ranged from about 100 to 200. </p>

<p>The viral load data is the same for each of the 3 different dose levels: the graph trended down to 2.5 log at 45 days. Remember, viral load at baseline was between 50,00 & 70,000; if your load was 49,000, a 2 log drop reduces your viral load to 490--below detectability. Agouron displayed a graph depicting the % of responders at 4 weeks for RNA (for a total of only 17 individuals); the data is the same for all 3 dose levels: greater than 1 log decrease--100%; greater than 1.5 log decrease--100% of participants; less than 500 copies, undetectable--75%. In a separate small VIRACEPT monotherapy study, where the baseline RNA was 50,000, the mean maximal log reduction was: 1.7 log--for the 500 mg. dose, 2.3 log--for the 750 mg. dose, 2.1 log--for the 1000 mg. dose. This is encouraging information. The side effect profile seems to compare reasonably well: most individuals taking VIRACEPT, have an increased amount of bowel movements per day and loose stools.</p>

<p><b>COMMENTARY</b>: Remember, the data is limited; this data extends out only to 28 or 45 days which means we cannot judge whether these CD4 increases and viral load decreases will be maintained over time. In addition, the number of evaluable study participants is too small to be predictive. But, we can expect to learn much more about the performance of this drug from their upcoming large-scale trials. In contrast, Merck has studied 2,000 individuals using Crixivan; their recent Crixivan/AZT/3TC trial enrolled 97 patients, which is still considered small. Abbott's study described above, examining individuals with less than 100 CD4, enrolled 1,090 individuals, and the CD4 data is based on 159 individuals while the viral load data is based on 215. Agouron is conducting drug interaction studies. VIRACEPT is about to enter it's large-scale pre-accelerated approval studies, which will enroll over 1,000 individuals for 6 different studies, and study two different doses--500 mg. 3x daily and 750 mg. 3x daily. Both AZT/3TC and d4T will be used in combination with VIRACEPT in these studies. </p>

<p>(4) On Thursday, Dr. Trip Gulick of NYU presented the Merck Crixivan data from the still ongoing trial examining the 3-drug combination of Crixivan/AZT/3TC. The mean baseline RNA was 39,800; the mean baseline CD4 was 142; the total number of enrolled participants at baseline was only 97. Bear in mind, that the results reported below are based on a small number of individuals. Throughout the months ahead, as the amount of data increases, updated reports will be available on the NATAP Web site home page.</p>

<p>The mean decreases in viral load for the 3-drug combination was: 1.8 log --at 4 weeks, 2.0 log--at 8 weeks, 2.3 log at 20 and 24 weeks. At 24 weeks, the data is based on only 7 evaluable study participants (but, soon we'll have data on 14 or more individuals); at 16 weeks, there were 20 to 24 evaluable participants. It is important to remember that the mean baseline RNA level is 39,800--so, a 2 log reduction is below the level of detectability (which is 500, in this case, by the Roche PCR kit); if there were a 3 log drop, you couldn't see it. The individuals who had a higher drop in viral load, had to have had higher levels at baseline, in order for it to be detected; a consideration of the baseline measure is important to the interpretation of viral load data. Therefore, the mean RNA drop should be 2 log at 24 weeks. The proportion of individuals with undetectable virus are (baseline=39,800): 40% at 4 weeks, 80% at 8 weeks, 90% at 16 weeks, n=20 to 24), 86% at 24 weeks (6/7 participants); very soon we should have data on 14 individuals at 24 weeks. The mean increases in CD4 (baseline=142 CD4) are: 60 at 4 weeks, 75 at 8 weeks, 100 at 14 weeks, 100 at 20 weeks, 146 at 24 weeks.</p>

<p>For those taking Crixivan alone (monotherapy), the mean viral load reduction was: 1.7 log at 8 weeks, 1.4 log at 17 weeks, 1.3 log at 24 weeks. The proportion of individuals with undetectable virus is 44% at 24 weeks (4/9 individuals). The mean increase in CD4 is 100 at week 12 and 98 at 24 weeks. Merck's experience is that for some individuals, after viral load starts returning to baseline, the CD4 still remain elevated. The side effect profile: hyperbilirubinemia (raised bilirubin levels) occurs in 15% of those taking Crixivan; usually, the rise subsides; urolithiasis occurs at a rate of about 3%--one of the symptoms of this is the development of kidney stones. Some individuals developing this side effect, discontinued Crixivan treatment and then re-challenged successfully with the drug; others were able to continue taking Crixivan while the side effect was resolved. Rises in liver enzymes usually subside within weeks.</p>

<p><b>Merck's AZT/ddI/Crixivan study, #020:</b><br>
These results were reported in January-1996 at the Human Retrovirus Conference. This is a 24 week study of treatment- naive individuals (less than 2 weeks AZT or ddI). There are 3 arms--26 per arm: Crixivan 600 mg. 4X /day, AZT/ddI--ddI 200 mg. 2x/day, Crixivan/AZT/ddI. The baseline viral load and CD4 were 102,000 copies and CD4 150. At week 24, the median viral load drop
was 2.9 with the 3-drug combination; the median CD4 increase was 80-90 cells at 24 weeks. 60% of subjects on 3-drug therapy were below level of RNA detectability at 24 weeks (200 copies/ml of viral RNA). Merck reported that 60% of participants in both arms--Crixivan monotherapy and 3-drug combination--had at least a 50 CD4 increase, at 24 weeks. Merck said that due to compliance difficulties with taking ddI, there were 7/26 ddI discontinuations in the 3-drug arm and 3/26 in the AZT/ddI arm. Also, after 6 months, when unblinded, some individuals discontinued ddI.  The side effects were as usual: 10-15% hyperbilirubinema after 1 month therapy, it reversed
without clinical symptoms; urolithiasis is expected to occur at a rate of
about 2-3%.</p>

<p><b>COMMENTARY</b>:  Apparently, combining AZT/3TC with Crixivan is important to the sustained antiviral benefits. The consensus opinion is that multi-drug combination therapy, which includes a protease inhibitor, will delay the development of resistance, and therefore, prolong the benefits of therapy--rises in CD4 and decreases in viral load; and, hopefully prolong survival. But the development of cross-resistance, to other protease inhibitors, is a concern, from the use of Crixivan. Additionally, there are drug interaction concerns. For example, the concurrent use of rifampin is prohibited with Crixivan. There are additional drug interaction concerns; please, consult your physician about them.</p>

<p>Again, the amount of individuals studied in this trial is relatively small. The final results on all these participants have not yet been tabulated. Although this data is exciting, encouraging, and caused much optimism at the Conference, bear in mind that sometimes study results can change when examined in a much larger group of individuals. This study examines only the drug's effect on surrogate markers--CD4 and viral load. The required "clinical endpoint" study--examining the drug's affect on progression to AIDS and survival-- is just now about to start. So, unlike the Abbott trial described above, which studies clinical endpoints, there is not yet data for those purposes for Crixivan. Of course, many individuals will not be able to wait for the data results of ACTG 320 (which is just beginning now), the study examining Crixivan for clinical endpoints--before having to make personal treatment decisions; additionally, in the near future other studies will be initiated exploring many different concepts. For those individuals who want to make a treatment decision, after the expected FDA approvals of ritonavir and Crixivan, consideration of this data will help in the decisions of which drug to use. NATAP's extensive written report will soon be available for all. It will review the data presented at our Jan. 6 forum at NYU (the videotaped event) and the data presented at this Conference.</p>

<p>One of the reasons, that some are being circumspect about these findings, is that AZT at first was shown to prolong life, but its benefits were limited. An important distinction is that viral load is a new measure, and AZT has minimal benefit to viral load, while protease inhibitors have a more profound effect. Multi-drug combinations, which include a protease inhibitor, have even a more profound effect on viral load and CD4. I remain cautiously optimistic. </p>

<p><b><a name="alben">DON'T</a> GET CAUGHT WITH YOUR PANTS DOWN!</b><br>
<font size=-1><i>by James Learned</i></font></p>

<p><font size=-1>Albendazole is one of the most popular items we carry at the Health Group, but we want to see that change. Everyone needs to know that <b>albendazole is available for free</b> through a company <a href="../../network/trials/micro.html#skb">compassionate use program</a>.</p>

<p>Albendazole is the only known treatment for <i>microsporidiosis</i>, a common infection in PWAs that often causes severe, debilitating diarrhea. It's available in Europe and most developing countries, but has yet to be approved here. In the meantime, there is SmithKline Beecham's compassionate use program, known as Protocol 030. The program has been open for quite a while, but it has been creatively disorganized and cumbersome. Hopefully, that will change soon. Folks from AIDS organizations in NY and Philly have been meeting with SmithKline (SKB) for the past year with some positive results. Of course, it's been very much like pulling teeth.</p>

<p>Things your doctor may not know: Getting in does <b>not</b> require a colonoscopy. SKB will also ask for a stool exam or a small bowel biopsy, but does <b>not</b> require either. <b>The only requirement for compassionate use is that your doctor tell SmithKline that you need albendazole for <i>micro</i></b>. Also new: your doctor can now use a national IRB, called Western IRB, rather than seeking approval from her or his individual hospital. For many doctors, this will be enormously helpful.</p>

<p>Of course, there's a down side-a few down sides. First, the compassionate use dosage starts at 800 mg a day with monthly incremental increases up to 2400 mg a day. Obviously, different people need to use different dosages. <i>But, according to what SmithKline representatives said in a Dec. 12th meeting, if you and your doctor agree to a different dosage, that can easily be worked out</i>. Secondly...Beware! The paperwork is frightening. According to more than one doctor, the paperwork is as cumbersome as that of any compassionate use program they know. <b>And</b> it needs to be filed every twenty-eight days. This is a big reason why doctors may not suggest this program. But we're continuing to work to make the program more accessible and streamlined.</p>

<p>The main reason you may not know about compassionate use is that SmithKline has been pushing their clinical <a href="../../network/trials/micro.html#029">Trial 029</a> at the expense of compassionate use. A poorly designed, placebo-controlled trial, 029 has been very slow to enroll for over a year. Getting in requires invasive procedures, and most people suffering from months of diarrhea and weight loss don't want to take the chance of receiving a placebo. <b>Whether or not you qualify for 029 has nothing to do with your eligibility for compassionate use. You do not have to fail to get in the trial in order to get albendazole for free. It really is your choice, so don't let your doctor or SmithKline confuse you about that</b>.</p>

<p>Please call us here at the Health Group and let us know your experiences with the compassionate use program, good or bad. We're keeping score. SmithKline needs to be held accountable for an ethical, accessible program, and the only way we can help achieve that is to know what's going on out there. SmithKline has a successful track record of wearing down people until they give up, tired and disillusioned doctors, patients, and researchers alike. This has happened to many folks trying to enroll in the compassionate use program: they've been put on hold, sent from extension to extension, waited for a return call.</p>

<p>SKB officials brought a flow chart to a September meeting with activists which detailed the hoops you and your doctor have to jump through in order to have albendazole arrive at your doorstep. They claimed that the whole process takes 24-48 hours after the first call, providing your doctor has completed the paperwork. But the SKB person who actually processes the applications at SmithKline says that it should take no longer than a week¾way too long. Asked about these contradictory claims, SKB officials said that the doctors' paperwork is processed immediately, but delays happen because so many company officials have to sign the papers, and that frequently they get incomplete or incorrect information on the mountain of forms. Good luck! Hopefully, this situation will improve, but we need to know about your experiences so we can help.</p>

<p>There are about three hundred people currently enrolled in the compassionate use program. Join them and get albendazole for free.</font></p>

<p><b><a name="thalid">Thalidomide</a>, Gentrified</b><br>
<font size=-1><i>by Sally Cooper</i></font></p>

<p><font size=-1>In June, as a response to two years of company and FDA refusal to provide compassionate access, we started distributing thalidomide from Brazil, along with our sister SFCA buyers' club, Healing Alternatives. In July, the FDA asked, "how can you possibly justify broader access to this drug?", and in August told us to stop. But by early September our gamble had worked. Celgene, a thalidomide manufacturer running a trial for AIDS wasting, announced a cost recovery <a href="../../network/trials/wasting.html#cel">compassionate use program</a> for PWAs fighting severe weight loss.</p>

<p>October followed with much negotiation, and a meeting on the 24th in which the company and the FDA agreed to radically change their plan from a randomized trial into real compassionate access, complete with a national IRB (Institutional Review Board). PWAs and their physicians will get to choose and change the dose depending on response. It's now January, and Celgene's program is still not open.</p>

<p>So we won one. We forced the FDA to bend and to recognize how limited treatment options are for people fighting wasting. We got a very small company to open a compassionate access protocol, albeit a troubling one. </p>

<p>One of the best changes is improved access for women. The program no longer requires birth control. Women are asked first if they're having "reproductive sexual intercourse." If they answer yes, then they are asked to use birth control. This is a first: women are being asked <b>and</b> believed, about their chances of getting pregnant, as opposed to being assumed to be almost-pregnant-all-the-time.</p>

<p>What hasn't changed is Celgene's exorbitant price. Companies can charge for unapproved drugs if they can convince the FDA that they need to. There are no rules about how the FDA approves these <i>cost recovery</i> programs (see <a href="32.html">next issue</a>). In the absence of any regulation by the FDA, there is very little we can do about this price. In fact, Celgene has increased their price by $40 since we met in October.</p>

<p>What pisses us off is that every time we complain about Celgene's price, the FDA and Celgene throw in our faces the price of Serono's human growth hormone (rHGH). This is completely- irrelevant. You cannot overcharge just because it's less than what another company is unscrupulously overcharging. To make people pay for experimental drugs is a serious ethical problem, and deserves careful study to ensure that no one profiteers from people's desperation. <b>It's pathetic and disturbing that when presented with a clear need for regulation, the FDA bows to corporate profit. But not surprising.</b></p>

<p>What's also crazy about this price is that the FDA knows the real cost of producing and distributing thalidomide from New Jersey. For years, another small NJ company which manufactures thalidomide, called (of all things) Pediatric Pharmaceuticals, has been trying to get FDA permission to sell thalidomide for $1.00 per 100 mg pill. When I asked the FDA about them two years ago, they were worried about their "high price". My, how times change. Lucky Celgene.</p>

<p>Three weeks ago, the FDA called in both Celgene and Ped. Pharmaceuticals, and now you can get the drug from either company, at the prices in the box. Andrulis, a company with marketing rights for aphthous ulcers but no ability to produce, has also applied for cost recov-ery. It's not at all clear if, when, or for how much, this program will be. <b>And just how does a company that doesn't even make a drug get the right to apply for cost recovery?</b></p>

<p>In short, thalidomide is becoming more broadly available for a variety of indications, through a haphazard series of programs. The best shot today is for your doctor to call the FDA and get an emergency IND. This process is much simpler than it sounds, as the FDA still grants INDs fairly readily. Then it's shopping: free access for ulcers through Andrulis (temporarily anyway) or your choice of Ped. Pharm. or Celgene respectively. It's your bank account, so get your doc to apply where you want to get it.</p>

<p>Our own distribution program will fade out in early '96, if Celgene's program gets up and run-ning. But we'll keep providing information packets about possible side effects and trial results - just call and we'll send them out faster than you can say compassionate access.</p>

<p><b>Summary of thalidomide access programs</b></p>

<p><b>Pediatric Pharmaceuticals (908) 225-0989</b><br>
This program is open for all indications. Doctors need to get an IND from the FDA (# below), and can get a bottle of 200 x 100 mg for $210, prepaid with a check. (That includes $10 for the shipping).</p>

<p><b>Celgene</b> For wasting/weight loss <b>(800) 896-6766</b><br>
Doctors should call for a packet of investigator information, and get IRB 
approval, locally or through the national IRB hired by Celgene. <b>Drug is shipped in bottles of 100x50 mg pills, for $328/bottle</b>. You will be invoiced after the drug is shipped.</p> 

<p>Recommended (but not required) starting dose is 50 mg/day, as Celgene's thalidomide may be more potent than the Brazilian kind. Given how many PWAs have allergic reactions, it seems worth finding out if 50 mg per day is a useful dose for you. You can switch to 100 mg/day any time, or start at 100-200 mg if you and your doctor prefer. Can't afford it? Celgene has promised on a number of occasions to provide free drug to 25-30% of the program's participants who can't otherwise afford it.</p>

<P><b><a name="ntz">SPEAKING</a> OF THE RUNS</b></p>

<p><font size=-1>NTZ, a possible treatment for <i><a href="../../network/simple/crypto.html">cryptosporidiosis</a></i>, is now available through a limited compassionate use program, run by Unimed, and in a small New York City trial at Cornell Medical Center, run by Dr. Rosemary Soave. Approved in Europe for veterinary use, two trials abroad have shown some promise for treating crypto in PWAs with almost no side effects. Unimed is so hot on this drug that they've just announced a phase III trial in Mexico.</p>

<p>In a strange but excellent turn, the FDA has approved Unimed's free compassionate use program before the first phase I trial has finished in this country. The program is open to people who can't get into the Cornell trial, either because they live someplace else, or because they have both <i>microsporidiosis</i> and <i>crypto</i> at the same time. Since many PWAs play house to both these bugs, and since NTZ may have anti-micro activity, this early compassionate access is an unexpected holiday treat. The program is open initially for only thirty people nationwide, but will expand if the Cornell trial suggests that it's a keeper.</p>

<p>What's strange (but we're not complaining) is that the FDA has approved Unimed's program even though NTZ hasn't even been through a single controlled trial in the US. Dr. Soave lobbied for compassionate use because there's only one site in the country. Thus, people lucky enough to live outside the confines of our cold and dark-at-4:00 pm metropolitan area also have access to this drug.</p>

<p>The Cornell trial offers 2-4 weeks of NTZ at a set dose, and then open label NTZ for another month, if necessary. Each dose level will enroll seven people. The first set of people took 500 mg/day, which Dr. Soave doesn't think is a particularly useful dose. Current participants will get 1000 mg/day, the dose used in foreign trials. The trial will dose up to 2000 mg/day, enrolling a total of 28 people. Of course, the hope is that the trial will show benefit, so the company will open more sites in more cities.</p>

<p>Robert Dudley, of Unimed, said that they probably will work with Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, and are looking for other US study sites. In addition, Dr. Soave hopes to start a trial of NTZ's activity against <i>microsporidiosis</i> in the near future. She also mentioned that she has been getting good anti-<i>crypto</i> results with 1200 mg a day of a new lactose free azithromycin, as well as with a combo of IV azithromycin and paromomycin.</font></p>

<p><b>WHAT'S THE DATA?</b><br>
<font size=-1>There is some clinical data with PWAs in Mexico and Mali, but none of it has been published yet. In Mali, twenty-four patients with severe diarrhea and dehydration, fifteen with <i>crypto</i>, took 1000 mg/day for up to two weeks. Ten of the fifteen were negative for <i>crypto</i> after seven to fourteen days of treatment. NTZ at this dose was also effective, up to 100%, against other bacteria and parasites that cause diarrhea. In Mexico, 7 PWAs with less than ten CD4 cells took 1000 mg/day of NTZ. All seven were negative for <i>crypto</i> at day 14, and six of the seven had their diarrhea resolve. In Mali, nineteen of all the patients were 'greatly improved', whatever that means, within the two weeks.</p>

<p>NTZ was developed by the same man who developed albendazole, Jean Francoise Rossignol. Remember, it was only in the 1970's that scientists realized human beings could be infected with <i>cryptosporidia</i>. But I digress... We'll be keeping track of this drug, and might import it if the data looks good and the compassionate use program doesn't expand. Let us know your experience with it.</font></p>

<p><b><a name="riton">HOW</a> 'BOUT THAT RITONAVIR?</b></p>

<p><font size=-1>On December 4th, Abbott, which produces the drug Ritonavir, also known as ABT-538 or 'the Abbott protease', announced a compassionate use program. You can apply if you have less than 50 CD4 cells; use no other protease inhibitors, ketoconazole, rifabutin, tagamet, or psychotropics; have liver functioning tests less than three times normal; and are not pregnant. This is an extensive list of restrictions, which may be difficult for a lot of PWAs with low T-cells. Also, people should watch out for the side effects, which can be severe. The long list of drugs to avoid while taking Abbott is a bit of a surprise and raises a question about drug interaction restrictions with other protease inhibitors, like the Merck drug.</p>

<p>The company will provide free Ritonavir to 2,000 people, two thirds in the US. This drug has been shown to be more effective in reducing viral load and increasing CD4 counts than any other protease inhibitor to date. It also seems to have the most side effects. The lottery will take place in the first week of January, and Abbott representatives claim that people will have the drug by the third week in January. <b>You can call: (800) 414-2437 for more information and to register.</b></p>

<p>Meanwhile, two weeks later on December 21, Abbott formally applied for drug approval, called 'submitting an NDA'. This means they could be selling drug by March or April. So let's just see how long it takes Abbott to enroll the compassionate use program and get the drug out. Abbott certainly hopes approval will be speedy, because then they'll have to provide free compassionate use drug for less than three months. Also, they can use the compassionate use to get rid of their foul syrup drug and be able to sell their new pill form.</p>

<p><i>After the drug is approved, will Abbott begin to charge those on compassionate use, like Roche has creepily done with Saquinavir? Will the lucky lottery winners continue to get the drug supplied for free while Abbott collects invaluable data? Will Abbott continue to fund trials to look at how this drug works with other anti-antivirals? Or, will they act like Roche and charge an arm and a leg for their drug and dis post-marketing studies completely? (And will they save Saquinavir with a combo study?)</i></p>

<p>Since Abbott refused for two full years to even consider offering a minuscule compassionate access program until they were within three months of full approval, you can guess which way we're betting. Scum.</font></p>

<p><b><a name="pep">Peptide</a> T--Dogged Again!</b></p>

<p><font size=-1>The largest controlled study of Peptide T in the long history of the drug was finally released, and we must admit, the results are disappointing. The study, conducted by the National Institutes of Mental Health, showed that Peptide T had no overall effect on cognitive functioning in HIV positive people, and, more surprisingly, no beneficial effect on individually measured cognitive function tests.</p>

<p>These functioning tests included memory, attention, language, problem solving, spatial ability, and visual-motor coordination. Because of your support of this drug, we had hoped some benefit to be shown in at least a few of the tests, but it didn't pan out. Participants in the study received Peptide T (6mg/day), or a placebo, for the first six months, then were rolled over to an open label arm of the study. People were allowed to continue any antiviral or prophylactic drug begun before the study, but were excluded if they had an illness likely to require chemotherapy, or were taking psycho-active drugs.</p>

<p><b>It's A Doggy Dogg World</b><br>
So what's up with that? This well-structured study, depressingly slow to enroll (and suspiciously slow to release any data) found absolutely no benefit to using Peptide T¾within a certain set of parameters. There are other cognitive tests that were completed, but the results have yet to be released.</p>

<p>The trial was developed in 1990, didn't finish enrollment until mid-92, and didn't release any data until late October 1995. This is slow turn-around even in the annals of tortoise-paced AIDS research. These results follow the similarly disappointing controlled trial of Peptide T's effect upon peripheral neuropathy.</p>

<p>There have been and will continue to be small trials, because in past uncontrolled studies, the drug has shown effectiveness in neuropathy, cognitive function, testosterone levels (read: horniness), and skin problems, particularly psoriasis. The company promised in September to pursue these trials to the tune of five million dollars...we'll see.</p>
</blockquote>
<img src="../gifs/yell.gif" height=200 width=2 align=left>
<blockquote>
<p>These results are particularly frustrating because so many of you swear by Peptide T. Many of you tell us that you generally feel better, that cognitively you are functioning better, and that this is an effective treatment for peripheral neuropathy. So the PWA Health Group will continue to process, import, and sell Peptide T (as expensively as ever) to positive people who decide to try Peptide T.</font></p>

<p><b><a name="fda">Just</a> in time for Christmas</b><br>
<font size=-1><i>by Sally Cooper</i></font></p>

<p><font size=-1>As many of you have noticed, the Health Group is out of stock of many of your favorites: sacchy B, ketotifen, ribavirin, liquid oral ampho B, etc. They're not far away - they've been waiting all fall at JFK International Airport for an FDA release. Why now? The local FDA office has told us that they've been instructed to "closely scrutinize personal use imports." It may be pure coincidence that this occurred shortly after we started carrying thalidomide, but in any case their close scrutiny is keeping many of you from getting what you have legitimately imported from Europe. And with their new computer system, they are much more able to track all sorts of things, including us.</p>

<p>The pattern of FDA interference is always the same. Weeks after they stop something, we get a notice listing the reason for the hold. We respond, and weeks later a second notice arrives listing a new "concern." A string of new "concerns" ensues, weeks turn into months, and they succeed in making it close to impossible, or at least a gigantic hassle, for the Health Group and other buyers' clubs to do what we've been doing for almost 9 (count 'em, 9) years.</p>

<p>These "concerns" are never about health issues, such as the quality of a product or unpublished side effects. All fall they held up ribavirin (which people take with alpha interferon for Hepatitis C) because they were worried that it was an American product getting re-imported into the US. Once we could prove it was really a foreign product, then a-okay. Go figure.</p>

<p>To expedite future shipments, we're reverting to an old Health Group policy, and asking you to fill out personal use import statements for products we get abroad. These forms promise the FDA that you are under the supervision of a doctor, and that you're getting a personal use quantity, namely, a 3 month supply. Also, the more new prescriptions, the better. Thanks to everyone and their doctors who completed these tedious little forms this Fall. </p>

<p>What's troubling is trying to figure out if this harassment is random, routine or the start of a new effort by the FDA to hassle us out of business. Although local harassment happens occasionally, this fall has been marked by a distinct lack of help from the FDA's Rockville office. While professing to understand the complexities of personal use imports, they have not lifted a hand to inform the local office that we are not the public health terror that they suspect.</p>

<p>Buyers' clubs exist because people with HIV and AIDS have fought for access to promising treatments and useful information. PWAs have taken many risks, including drug importation, to ensure that they have as many survival options as possible. With the changing political scene, it's not at all clear that people with AIDS have the limited political clout they used to have. In the near future, we and other buyers' clubs will probably need your loud support to stay open and we won't hesitate to call on you. Access still demands action.</p>

<p>Let the FDA know how you feel about the work of the PWA Health Group and our sister buyers' clubs. Your voice is the reason we're still open.</p>

<p><b><a name="3tc">3TC</a> and Hep B</b></p>

<p><font size=-1>We look for good news all the time, but it's just so damn rare! It seems that 3TC, or Lamivudine, just approved and available in drug stores everywhere as a combo treatment for HIV, may be useful for chronic Hepatitis B (HBV). A recent study reported in the New England Journal looked at 32 people (without HIV) with chronic Hepatitis B, who took either 100 mg or 300 mg per day of 3TC. The drug temporarily wiped the slate clean of HBV in all participants. There wasn't much difference between the doses: it took six weeks for the 300 mg dose to clear Hep B virus and ten weeks for the 100 mg/day dose. </p>

<p>An earlier 3TC study in PWAs with Hep B showed that 100 mg/day suppressed the virus, but 96% of the participants' HBV counts rebounded once off drug. This happened in this trial as well: 3TC's effect ended for 80% of the participants once they stopped taking the drug. But in six people (five of whom had failed interferon), 3TC had a sustained effect after 9 months. Two people on 300 mg and four on 100 mg had no rebound of HBV, and two in each group lost HBV antigen, meaning their immune system found no Hep B to fight against.</p>

<p>Half of the trial participants had tried interferon with no success, and the others hadn't taken anything for Hep B. This trial didn't show any difference between these groups, but the researchers speculate that past interferon use may somehow prime a person for a better response with 3TC. Future studies will look at the treatment combination of 3TC and interferon.</font></p>

<font size=-1>Everyone gets their propers for waiting so long for a new edition of Notes from the Under-ground. What's the excuse for said delay? Well, we've had a lot of staff changes this Fall --Geoffrey Moore left as Deputy Director and has been replaced ably by James Learned (who lives across from where Andy used to live in Brooklyn.) Dana Greene left as Director of the Women's Treatment Program for the Elysian Fields, or rather, more school. Finally, Tim Horn left as Notes Editor to work at the Treatment & Data Network, then AMFAR, then an Indy-car pit mechanic, and is now working on the sequel to Fern Gully--just kidding, he's really working at AMFAR.</p>

<p>Andy Young jumped on board to edit Notes just in time for Thalidomide and the havoc that she wrought. He's worked at the Brooklyn AIDS Task Force and with the wacky nuns in the AIDS Center at St. Vincent's Hospital, in Manhattan. Andy just took his Chemistry and Physics finals, so should be able to pump out Notes at an increased rate for the next few months...that is unless the singing career takes off--think Iggy Pop meets Julie Christie.</p>

<p><b><a name="RESEARCH">RESEARCH</a> RESEARCH EVERYWHERE, NOT A DROP TO TREAT</b><br>
by <i>Dana Greene, Coordinator of the Women's Treatment Project of the PWA Health Group</i></p>

<p>In February I went to my first HIV/AIDS Conference. The illustrious title: HIV Infection in Women: Setting a New Agenda. Since the old agenda wasn't doing anything, I figured the only direction the new agenda could go was up. Honestly, I was anticipating the conference with enthusiasm. The only conferences I had frequented previously were lesbian and gay health conferences. These proved to be disappointing because no clinical information was available and the presentations and plenary sessions were about our feelings about being gay and having anal warts. I digress.</p>

<p><b>Day one</b>: Everyone is talking in a language I don't believe anyone really understands. The atmosphere is all clique and I feel underqualified for my job. No one talks about AIDS and everyone (women included) talk about HIV- positive women as other.</p>

<p><b>Day two</b>: The language is indeed English and with a couple of vocabulary tips from Sally, I'm right in the swing of things. I sit through a multi-million dollar study that has concluded that being HIV-positive and a woman is stressful. I suddenly feel overqualified for my job.</p>

<p><b>Day three</b>: A revelation! The new agenda is the old agenda with feeling. I sit through another multi-million dollar presentation concluding that women who use drugs have a hard time accessing healthcare. This level of information has allowed me to conclude that even Miss Piggy is overqualified to work in Women & AIDS. Upon driving back to New York with Sally, which proves to be the most educational part of the conference, I decide to rename the conference: HIV Infection in Women: Masters of The Obvious.</p>

<p>O.K. what does this mean? After 15 years, few researchers seem to be taking women's lives and deaths seriously. In the world of AIDS, men remain the core foundation by which all studies epidemiologic, treatment, protocols, etc. are structured. Women's health is relevant only in terms of birthing a healthy baby. And of course, HIV only expresses itself vaginally. Roll up your sleeves, there's a lot of work to do.</p>

<p>To understand the implications of the limited nature of research apparent at this conference, I will use presentations specific to human papillomavirus (HPV) to illustrate my point. I went to 5 presentations focusing on HPV. The various studies concluded the following in HIV-positive women: anal warts are prevalent; vulvar neoplasia(found using colposcopy) is common and lesions uniformly recurred after various treatments; higher incidence and prevalence of cervical neoplasia; pap smears are equally effective in HIV-positive and HIV-negative women; loop excision (a standard HPV treatment) is associated with a higher failure rate; HPV is associated with squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) (i.e., cancer) progression; and rapid CD4 cell count loss is associated with the expression of HPV and progression of SIL in adolescents.</p>

<p>This certainly confirms that HPV is clinically meaningful and prevalent in the bodies of HIV-positive women. It also indicates current treatments are inadequate, due to the high recurrence and progression rate of SIL. HPV seems to have an effect on the immune system. While all of this information has epidemiological and clinical meaning, it leaves us in the dark in terms of maintaining our health. How do we effectively screen for HPV? Should anal paps become a standard screening procedure? Are anal paps an integral part of maintaining anal health? Are combination therapies effective? Is a pap smear good enough or should a colposcopy become routine? How often? What does the decrease of CD4+ cell counts mean in relation to HPV & SIL progression? What about viral load? I think you see my point.</p>

<p>The current level of study seems anecdotal. No update on current clinical trials looking into HPV treatment was offered. A call to 1-800-TRIALS-A reveals two related clinical trials. The first trial, studying 5-FU as a treatment for cervical dysplasia, was started in 1992. Only 47 women have enrolled, with over 110 slots left open to fill. A second clinical trial, hoping to study the combination of alpha-interferon in combination with isotretinoin for the treatment of anal neoplasia, has only enrolled 10 PWAs (both men and women). This trial hopes to enroll 182 people. Clearly, there has been little success in enrolling women in HPV trials.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the inadequacy of AIDS/HIV care for women goes far beyond the realm of treatment research. Another significant presentation confirmed that even after pre-and post-test counseling, women report understanding little about HIV/AIDS and the significance of a positive or negative result. Women are less likely to have connected with a community referral after receiving a positive test result, and often fail to connect with medical services until a hospitalization is required. Furthermore, a study concluded in Canada, where there is universal healthcare, confirmed earlier American studies that women are less likely to seek or be matched with a medical practitioner experienced in treating PWAs.</p>

<p>What do we know about effectively caring for HIV+ women? Not much. First, research has shown little urgency in diagnosing, screening and treating HIV+ women. Second, most AIDS primary care facilities still fail to include comprehensive gynecological services. Clinical trials investigators are making little effort to enroll women into trials other than those limited to reproductive health. Finally, with mandatory testing for pregnant women just around the corner, the ethics of HIV testing bares scrupulous reexamination. Until there are appropriate services for HIV+ women and until HIV+ women become a valued priority to the HIV/AIDS research, medical and service community, I bait the question what truly is the point in testing women for HIV?</p>

<p>It is quite clear the quality and longevity of HIV+ women's lives are not a priority to any government health agency, the drug companies or treatment activists. The great Tim Horn said to me, "it's bad science." I thought, "No Tim, it's misogyny."</p>

<p>On February 7, 1995, the <a href="http://web.fie.com/htdoc/fed/nih/ali/any/menu/any/aliindex.htm">National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases </a>(NIAID), made a very big decision. The decision, voting to eliminate an arm (study group) of a pediatric clinical trial that is near completion, has and will continue to have broad implications in the future trials of pediatric labeling of anti-HIV drugs, and more importantly, the primary care of HIV+ children.</p>

<p>NIAID decided to alter its ACTG-152, a phase III trial comparing <a href="../../network/simple/zido.html">AZT</a>, to <a href="../../network/simple/dida.html">ddI</a>, to the two drugs <a href="../../network/simple/combo.html">combined</a>. The study opened in August 1991 and has enrolled 839 HIV+ children, ages 3 months to 18 years.</p>

<p><b>Why was the trial altered?</b> Children taking AZT alone were progressing faster to opportunistic infections and death than children in the other two groups. All children receiving AZT alone were taken off AZT and given the option of taking ddI or ddI in combination with AZT. For children already on ddI or ddI/AZT combination, the trial will continue. This alteration by NIAID has affected a number of other pediatric ACTG trials already underway. ACTG 240, a phase II study of AZT versus d4T in children 3 months to 6 years has been completely unblinded. Children who were originally receiving AZT will now be told what they were taking and offered d4T. All children will remain in the study until February, 1996 so that accurate data can still be reported. (<b>Ed. note</b>: Like all trials, it is always up to the patient whether he or she wants to remain in any trial -<i>th</i>)</p>

<p>ACTG-239 is a study of AZT alone versus AZT and ddI in combination for infants under the age of 6 months. The AZT monotherapy arm will be changed to ddI. ACTG-300, a trial still in development, AZT/3TC in combination and AZT/ddI in combination will now be compared to ddI, instead of AZT.</p>

<p>While the results of 152 have certainly caused havoc for several ACTG pediatric trials, the implications are even greater when we apply these results to the standard-of-care for children. (<b>Ed. note</b>: Current standard of care is AZT alone for all children older than 3 months -<i>th</i>)</p>

<p>The immediate media reaction to the results of ACTG 152 was that it simply confirms an opinion held by many in the community that AZT is evil and ddI is, well, not quite so evil -- more precisely, that AZT has little, if any overall benefit. At the opposite end of the spectrum, others have defended continued use of AZT therapy, especially in populations with neurologic disorders or during pregnancy. If anything, ACTG-152 reaffirms the concept that few things in the treatment of HIV are absolute. For every different opinion and every individual patient there is a different way to treat the disease.</p>

<p>How this startling interim analysis will affect the standard-of-care for children is not entirely known. While it will most likely mean a stronger emphasis on individualized care that depends less on clinical trial data and more on clinical practice, NIAID has offered several tips to primary care givers regarding the standard of care for children taking AZT as their primary anti-HIV therapy.</p>

<p>According to NIAID, physicians and parents caring for children with AIDS who have not received prior antiretroviral therapy should consider these interim study findings as they make decisions regarding the choice of therapy for that child. While the interim results showed that AZT is the least effective of the three, whether ddI or combination therapy is the best choice is not known. For patients who are already taking AZT, physicians will need to review the clinical course of individual patients. If the drug is well tolerated and the patient is not experiencing disease progression, continued AZT therapy may be appropriate. On the other hand, a switch to another therapy may also be appropriate in particular circumstances</p>

<p>In its statement, NIAID emphasizes that this result will have no impact on the findings from ACTG 076, regarding the use of AZT for the prevention of perinatal transmission of HIV. AZT, when administered according to the ACTG 076 regimen substantially reduces the risk of perinatal transmission. AZT remains the treatment of choice for that situation. While it is now questionable whether AZT is the safest drug to be used, little evidence exists of the effectiveness of other regimens for the prevention of perinatal transmission.</p>

<p>NIAID also states that no clinical trials in adults directly compare to the results of ACTG 152. However, in adult trials comparing AZT to ddI or combination therapy, AZT generally appeared either equivalent or better. The ACTG 152 interim result that AZT is possibly dangerous was not stopped because of question about effectiveness; only because of fatalities and irreversible brain damage. These results could not have been anticipated from results available from adult trials.</p>

<p>While NIAID has attempted to answer some of the more conspicuous questions regarding the implications of ACTG 152, there are still several questions that remain unanswered. How should physicians choose the initial therapy for symptomatic children with HIV? Physicians and patients or parents must consider the factors such as convenience, personal preference and cost in making therapy decisions. For example, the combination therapy requires six doses of drugs a day compared with two doses each day of ddI monotherapy. However, some children do not readily tolerate the required ddI formulation. At the completion of ACTG 152 and data analysis later in 1995, further information will become available to guide selection of initial therapy.</p>

<p>Limited resources and impending budget cuts are current realities of government research. Such restrictions will not allow for another study similar to ACTG 076 or another huge pediatric treatment study. Furthermore, such studies may take years to complete and upon completion may provide outdated or inconclusive information. However, children with HIV, their parents, and pediatricians need more guidance than ACTG 152 alone can provide. Previously, experts in treating pediatric HIV have met to develop anti-HIV and prophylaxis guidelines for children with AIDS. Hopefully, plans are underway to reconvene this group (including community advocates, parents, and FDA representatives) in anticipation of final ACTG 152 analysis.</p>

<p><b>Treatments for Weight Loss</b>. Weight loss is one of the most common illnesses associated with HIV and AIDS. 95-100% of PWAs report unwanted weight loss. It can occur at any stage of infection, may precede or indicate disease progression, and can get progressively worse. Average weight loss varies from 23-35 lbs, but it may be more severe if associated with an active OI or watery diarrhea. In addition, weight loss is associated with malnutrition, which may contribute to increased immune suppression.</p>

<p>While weight loss has always been a major problem in PWAs, there has been very little research on nutrition and the pathophysiology of weight loss in PWAs, or in anybody. There are very few proven treatments available for PWAs, and nothing known about prophylaxis. However, most researchers argue that weight loss should be aggressively treated. Following is a detailed information outlining a handful of treatments approved and in development for weight loss. To learn more about treatments for wasting syndrome and diarrhea, call us any time.</p>

<p><a name="description"></a>
<b>Drug Name </b>: <a name="rhgh">Recombinant </a>Human Growth Hormone (rHGH, Serostim)<br>
<b>Description</b>: A synthetic version of pituitary gland-derived human growth hormone. Approved for the treatment of dwarfism.
<b>Data</b>: In a phase III trial of 178 PWAs, significant increases in body weight and lean body mass were reported. At 12 weeks, the 90 PWAs receiving drug had gained an average of 3.52 lbs in body weight and 6.60 lbs in lean body mass. Changes in viral load, onset of disease, and death were not different in either group<br>
<b>Side Effects</b>: Side effects reported include joint stiffness, puffiness and numbness. Lower doses cause less side effects. Some studies indicate that rHGH may suppress crucial functions of the immune system.<br>
<b>Availability</b>: rHGH can only be obtained in trials or through an expensive compassionate use program. Call Serono Laboratories at 1/800-714-AIDS.<br>
<b>Cost</b>: Under the compassionate use, rHGH will costs $1,200 a week for the drug. After approval, drug will be more expensive.</p>	

<p><b><a name="as">Drug Name</a></b>: <a href="../../network/simple/steroids.html">Anabolic Steroids</a> (Testosterone, Oxandrolone, deca-durabolin,Oxymethalone, methandrostenolone)<br>
<b>Description</b>: Anabolics have long been used to treat disease-associated wasting and immune disorders. Available in IV, injectable and oral formulations. Unlike testosterone, manufactured steroids have better anabolic properties, contributing more to muscle growth than masculinization.<br>
<b>Data</b>: There has been little reported data from controlled trials of anabolic steroids in PWAs. Several studies (no PWAs) have confirmed that anabolic steroids build lean body mass (with proper nutrition and resistance exercise) and can reverse autoimmune disorders. Anabolics are only effective when combined with resistance exercise. <br>
<b>Side Effects</b>: Reports of liver damage are mostly anecdotal, with clinical reports showing that oral steroids may possibly raise liver enzymes. Depending on the drug, potential side effects can vary. Rare hepatocellular neoplasms, cholestic hepatitis, edema, cholersterol increases, triglyceride decreases, and acne are possible side effects.<br>
<b>Availability</b>: Most anabolic steroids are available by prescription. However, fears about their possible side effects make many medical practitioners reluctant to prescribe them. Contrary to the statements made in the Steroid Control Act, it is still very legal for doctors to write prescriptions.<br>
<b>Cost</b>: Depending on your distributor (underground or prescription), the price can vary. However, with a prescription, some steroids can cost as little as $6 for one week's supply<br></p>

<p><b><a name="thal">Drug Name</a></b>: <a href="../info/thal.html">Thalidomide</a><br>
<b>Description</b>:  An oral sedative withdrawn from the drug market because of its teratogenic side effects. It is now being studied due to its specific ability to inhibit TNF-a. It is also being studied as an anti-HIV drug.<br>
<b>Data</b>: In a recent study of 23 PWAs, all of whom were on antiretroviral therapy, an average weight gain of 4.5% was reported by those taking thalidomide for three weeks. In a second study, PWAs treated reported an 8% body weight gain after twelve weeks. Data from apthous ulcer trials also reported significant weight gain.<br>
<b>Side Effects</b>: Side effects include birth defects, masking of TB and MAC symptoms, drowsiness, allergic skin reactions and peripheral neuropathy.<br>
<b>Availability</b>: It is available in clinical trials and a Compassionate Use protocol for apthous ulcers. Information regarding the FDA IND can be obtained by your doctor calling the FDA at (301) 442-9553. It is also available through the PWA Health Group or Healing Alternatives Fdn<br>
<b>Cost</b>: Marketed at $1.00-$3.00/pill. At 1-2 pills a day, thalidomide can cost as little as $2.00 for a day's regimen.<br></p>

<p><b><a name="meg">Drug</a> Name </b>: <a href="../../network/access/drugs/mege.html">Megestrol Acetate</a> (Megace)<br>
<b>Description</b>: A synthetic version of progesterone, a female hormone. It is currently approved for ovarian and breast cancer, as well as AIDS-related weight loss.<br>
<b>Data</b>: It has been reported in two clinical trials that PWAs taking megestrol acetate gained an average of 6 lbs. after 12 weeks of treatment. Early research indicated that the weight gain is fat mass, but a recent study demonstrated that 30% of total weight gain is lean body mass.<br>
<b>Side Effects</b>: Side effects include birth defects, irregular menstrual bleeding, hypogonadism, diarrhea, rash, impotence, edema, swelling, and weakness.<br>
<b>Availability</b>: While both liquid and tablet formulations are approved, liquid is the most often prescribed formulation. A clinical trial of megestrol acetate in HIV+ women is currently open. A pharmaceutical patient assistance program is available through Bristol-Myers Squibb: 1/800-788-0123.<br>
<b>Cost</b>: An 8oz bottle of Megace can cost anywhere from $60.00 to $100.00.<br></p>

<p><b><a name="dron">Drug</a> Name </b>: <a href="../../network/access/drugs/dron.html">Dronabinol</a> (Marinol)<br>
<b>Description</b>: A synthetic version of THC, the active substance of marijuana. Approved in tablet form as an appetite stimulant in PWAs and for nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. <br>
<b>Data</b>: In a trial of 139 PWAs, appetite was significantly improved by those taking dronabinol. Increased appetite continued during an open-label extension of the trial. Slight gains in weight, mostly fat mass, have been reported by those taking drug. <br>
<b>Side Effects</b>: Side effects are mostly psychotropic. Feeling buzzed, drowsiness, muddled thinking and poor coordination have all been reported by those taking dronabinol.<br>
<b>Availability</b>: Dronabinol is available in capsule form. A pharmaceutical patient assistance program is available through the manufacturer, Roxane Laboratories, at: 1/800-274-8651.<br>
<b>Cost</b>: Capsules are available in 2.5mg, 5.0 mg, and 10mg formulations. The costs are $330, $630, and $1350, respectively, for 100 tablets.<br></p>

<p><b><a name="pent">Drug</a> Name </b>: <a href="../../network/access/drugs/pento.html">Pentoxifylline</a> (Trental)<br>
<b>Description</b>: A nitrogen (xanthine) derivative approved for people with arterial disease. It also inhibits the production of TNF-a. It has also been studied as a possible treatment of <a href="../../network/simple/ks.html">KS</a>.<br>
<b>Data</b>: In a trial of 5 PWAs, no significant weight gain was observed. According to the study, weight loss continued in the PWAs, regardless of TNF levels.<br>
<b>Side Effects</b>: Flu-like symptoms, predominately fever and nausea, have been reported in clinical tirals.<br>
<b>Availability</b>: Pentoxifylline is approved and can be obtained with a doctor's prescription. A patient-assistance program is available through the manufacturer, Hoechst Roussel Pharmaceuticals: 1-800-422-4779.<br>
<b>Cost</b>: 100 400mg Trental tablets are priced from $40.00 to $70.00.<br></p>

<p><b><a name="keto">Drug Name </a></b>: <a href="../info/keto.html"> Ketotifen</a> (Zaditen)<br>
<b>Description</b>: A safe antihistamine (like Seldane or Benadryl) used extensively in Europe to treat bronchial asthma and allergies. It is also being studied as a treatment for colitis. It is also believed to lower TNF-a, an important cytokine that is believed to contribute to wasting.<br>
<b>Data</b>: In one study of ketotifen in combination with oxymethalone, an oral anabolic steroid, TNF was reduced by 14 % and PWAs had weight gains of 11 lbs. in four weeks. In a second study of ketotifen alone, PWAs with elevated TNF levels (who weren't wasting), a weight gain averaging 6 lbs. was reported.<br>
<b>Side Effects</b>: Ketotifen is non-toxic (although it is not advised for patients with epilepsy). Primary side effects include drowsiness and dry mouth. Ketotifen has been shown to be safe for children.<br>
<b>Availability</b>: Ketotifen is available without prescription through the PWA Health Group and is in clinical trials in Europe.<br>
<b>Cost</b>: A two week supply of ketotifen is $36.00.</p>

<p><b>Drug Name </b>: <a name="tpn">Total Parenteral Nutrition</a> (TPN)<br>
<b>Description</b>: An optimal method of supplying nutritional supplements through an IV tube directly into the blood. It is indicated for temporary use during acute illness, but may require a long course of therapy in PWAs with severely compromised bowel functions.<br>
<b>Data</b>: Clinical studies of TPN have yielded highly beneficial results. In PWAs without a severe illness, other than weight loss, TPN has shown to significantly increase body weight and lean body mass in a relatively short period of time. For PWAs with systemic disease, TPN has shown to increase body weight moderately and increase quality of life significantly<br>
<b>Side Effects</b>: While there do not appear to be any serious side affects associated with TPN, it should be noted that infusions using a catheter always run the risk of infection. Proper dietary intake should be maintained to ensure digestive tract function<br>
<b>Availability</b>: TPN is available with a prescription from your doctor. While it is often administered in a doctor's office or hospital, it is possible to receive infusions at home. However, infusions at home usually require the assistance of a technical nurse. Single infusions are usually eight hourse in duration. Furthermore, frequent blood chemistry monitoring will be required.<br>
<b>Cost</b>: In a home care and/or hospital environment, TPN can be expensive. It is estimated that it can cost anywhere between $9,000 to $13,000 a month.</p>

<p><b>Drug Name </b>: <a name="nutri">Nutritional Drinks</a> (Advera, Nutren, Peptamen, Ensure Plus, Sustacal, Lipisorb)<br>
<b>Description</b>: Nutritional drinks are high in calories, fiber (good for regulating bowel function) and micronutrients: Essential nutrients include: Thiamin; Vitamins A, E, C, B6, B12; Folic Acid; Selenium; Copper; Zinc; Iron.<br>
<b>Data</b>: Supplements like Advera have been manufactured specifically for HIV+ people. A controlled trial of Advera yielded moderate body weight gain. Very little data is available on other nutritional supplments in PWAs.<br>
<b>Side Effects</b>: Bad taste seems to be the only side effect reported by PWAs in clinical trials. Nutritional drinks should be used to boost dietary intake, not replace meals.<br>
<b>Availability</b>: Most nutritional supplements can be purchased in drug stores over the counter and in health food stores.<br>
<b>Cost</b>: 8 fl oz. cans can cost anywhere from $1.00 each to $3.00 each. Peptamen prices can reach as high as $6.00 a can.</p>

<p><b>Drug Name </b>: <a name="lcarn">L-Carnitine</a> (Carnitor)<br>
<b>Description</b>: An approved formulation of a naturally occurring amino acid found in muscles. It is being studied as a treatment for PWAs who suffer from muscle loss/dysfunction associated with AZT consumption (myopathy). L-carnitine is available in oral and injectable.<br>
<b>Data</b>: No data available yet from PWAs. In trials of L-Carnitine in people with carnitine deficiency, significant improvement was seen in those taking drug.<br>
<b>Side Effects</b>: Abdominal pain and nausea have been the only reported side effects so far.<br>
<b>Availability</b>: Carnitor brand L-carnitine is approved and ban be prescribed by a doctor. L-tryptophan health food brand can be purchased in health food stores, but has been found to be of very poor quality. For information regarding the NIH trial, call: Dr. Cupler at (301) 402-4479.<br>
<b>Cost</b>: 90 330mg tablets are currently priced from $60.00 to $75.00.</p>

<p><b>Drug Name </b>: <a name="anti">Antiretrovirals</a> (<a href="../../network/simple/zido.html">AZT</a>, <a href="../../network/simple/dida.html">ddI</a>, <a href="../../network/simple/zalc.html">ddC</a>, <a href="../../network/simple/stav.html">d4T</a>, <a href="../../network/simple/three.html">3TC</a>, <a href="../info/prot1.html">protease inhibitors</a>)<br>
<b>Description</b>: Antiretrovirals may actively treat HIV in the digestive tract that can contribute to malabsorption of essential nutrients. Furthermore, lowering viral production may lead to cytokine regulation (i.e., TNF), a common contributor to weight loss.<br>
<b>Data</b>: Several trials of antiretrovirals have reported weight gain in PWAs. In particular, a phase I/II trial of 3TC demonstrated significant gains in appetite, energy and weight. Retrospective analysis of other antiretroviral trials have found similar data. Anecdotal reports of protease inhibitors have yielded similar results.<br>
<b>Side Effects</b>: The side effects associated with each antiretroviral tend to vary. Everything from anemia to fatal pancreatis to neuropathy have been reported as possible side effects. Ask you doctor about the side effects of each drug.<br>
<b>Availability</b>: All drugs, except 3TC and protease inhibitors, are currently approved for PWAs. The drugs approved can be purchased virtually anywhere. State ADAP programs and pharmaceutical reimbursement programs can be of assistance in cost recovery. 3TC is available through a compassionate use (free) program. A trial of d4T and weight gain is currently ongoing.<br>
<b>Cost</b>: None of them are cheap, often costing $120.00+ for a bottle of 100. However, there are many ways of obtaining free or low cost drug (through <a href="../../network/access/index.html">state programs</a>, etc.).</p>

<p><b><a name="Thioctic Acid">New</a> Product Annoucement: <a href="../info/thio.html">Thioctic Acid</a></b></p>

<p>The PWA Health Group is proud to announce the arrival of a new product. Thioctic acid (Thioctacid 300), or alpha-lipoic acid, is a strong antioxidant that comes to us from Europe, where it have been used extensively as a treatment for radiation sickness and diabetic-related neuropathy. It has also been used, both in trials and in practice, as a treatment for various drug poisonings and chemical overdoses.</p>

<p>What does any of this have to do with PWAs? First, thioctic acid has been shown in trials to reduce liver enzymes. For anyone, elevated liver enzymes can be serious. For PWAs who need to take oral medications such as antibiotics and/or antivirals, a balanced level of liver enzymes are essential so that they may be metabolized properly. Unfortunately, these very same medications can increase the level of liver enzymes due to their high toxicity. For those of you who have tried getting into a clinical trial, a balanced level of liver enzymes is required.</p>

<p>A second benefit of thioctic acid can be found in its ability to elevate the level of glutathione and reactive oxidants in PWAs. As many of you NAC-takers know, the antioxidant activity of NAC may assist in reducing oxidative stress (too many free radicals). Without a balanced level of reactive oxidants, it is possible that oxidative stress can cause inflammation and damage organs; can damage nerve cells, which can eventually lead to neuropathy; and can also speed up the replication of HIV.</p>

<p>Much of thioctic acid's benefits have been found in earlier clinical trials that did not involve PWAs. One in particular, involving 80 people with diabetes, concluded that thioctic acid, among a handful of other antioxidants, were effective in reducing oxidative stress. While a reduction in neuropathy and organ inflammation was reported, there was no reported statistical difference between the antioxidants.</p>

<p>In 10 PWAs, a pilot study concluded that thioctic acid increased substantially the levels of glutathione in 7 volunteers. A rise in CD4+ cells and CD8+ cells were also reported.</p>

<p>Thioctic acid is distributed in tablet formulations of 300mg. We know form safety data that 1 or 2 tablets a day are safe. Thrombocytopenia from higher doses has been the only reported side effect. Because thioctic acid is a cheleating agent, which can purge minerals (especially iron) from your body, it is recommended that regular blood tests be done to measure for anemia.</p>

<p><b><a name="Thalidomide">Thalidomide, the FDA, and Us - What do you have?</a></b><br>
Underground COMPASSIONATE USE<br></p>

<p>The FDA called last November to see if we were selling <a 
href="../info/thal.html">thalidomide</a>. We're not, not yet anyway, and in reply I asked if they were working on making it available for people with AIDS facing severe weight loss. The caller brought up the FDA emergency program for aphthous ulcers but that's hardly news: some days I feel like we're IND Central, faxing FDA and clinical trial info all over the country. Asked again about setting up a protocol for wasting, he said: "no, the boys in the Division say there's not enough data."</p>

<p>Three double blind placebo-controlled studies, numerous case studies, 100's of anecdotal reports from doctors treating oral and throat ulcers, plus a well-documented (and now patented) ability to suppress TNF-alpha, and what do you have? Much more data than the FDA had for setting up the compassionate use program for oral ulcers. Exactly how much data do they need to set up a safe alternative to $1000/week for human growth hormone (rHGH)?</p>

<p>The fact is, the more useful thalidomide becomes, the more restricted it's going to be. Why? Public enemy number one, my friend MB calls it, the whole reason the FDA got re-organized in 1962. [In the late 50's, thousands of babies were born with horrific birth defects after an English whisky company started marketing the drug as safe for morning sickness, despite the fact that the drug had never been tested in women. Ironically, this lesson of what can happen when drugs are not tested in women has led to less study of drugs in women, not more, particularly in the US.] As the most poignant and best-known reason for having an FDA, thalidomide is a political hot potato like no other. Even if FDA officials believe that thalidomide can be safely given to women of childbearing age, they probably also believe the political backlash could be a nightmare for them.</p>

<p>So no surprise, thalidomide is still defined primarily by its teratogenicity, or ability to cause birth defects. The official reluctance to work out safe ways to provide one of the cheapest and safest TNF-inhibitors known, is even supported in HIV/AIDS treatment guides. All in the name of protecting unborn babies, as though every HIV+ woman is pregnant, or almost pregnant at any moment. Where's the fuss and hysteria about Megace, an approved treatment for AIDS-related wasting - also a teratogen? And how did rHGH, human growth hormone, get to be considered safe for women of child-bearing age? Go figure.</p>

<p>Such inconsistency begins with clinical trials. Women weren't allowed in the Megace AIDS-wasting trials, even though it's a breast cancer drug. In the rHGH trials, women had to use birth control, which makes sense - human growth hormone doesn't sound very safe for a growing fetus. But in thalidomide trials, you have to either be sterile (the wasting trials), or use two (count 'em, 2) forms of birth control, weekly pregnancy testing, the works. And even then, what do you have? Panic on the part of hospital review boards, at least here in NYC. Here's another odd thing: men are asked to abstain from sex in the ulcer trials, but not the wasting trials. I suspect it feels strange to require so much of women, and nothing of men. There are cases in which men have passed along birth defects from experimental medications, but thalidomide has a short half life in the body and it seems unlikely that it would cause problems this way. Still, for the record, it's neither proven nor disproven.</p>

<p>When I bring up thalidomide, I often mention that 80% of birth defects have no known cause, and that we have little idea or concern about birth defects with most of the AIDS drugs we routinely pour into our bodies. Invariably the reaction is: "But we know how dangerous thalidomide is." How odd that in the face of knowledge, our impulse is not to prudently act as we know how, but rather to not to act at all.</p>

<p>Taking thalidomide early in pregnancy will cause severe birth 
defects, if the fetus lives. If we do what we know to do: offer clear visual and verbal info about: avoiding pregnancy, using birth control, checking for pregnancy, getting useful counseling by physicians, and (yes, Myrtle) access to abortions, what do we have? Exactly what Roche provides today for thousands of female teenagers who are taking Accutane, an extremely potent teratogen. If the American health care system can safely provide Accu-tane, a highly teratogenic acne medicine, it can safely provide thalidomide for life-threatening AIDS-related wasting.</p>

<p>But since the health care system currently lacks the political integrity to do so, we and Healing Alternatives, our sister buyers' club in San Francisco, will start providing thalidomide as soon as we can secure a safe pharmaceutical supply. To access the Underground Thalidomide Compassionate Use Program, you will need a prescription, have to read and sign a booklet outlining the uses and possible abuses of thalidomide. Thalidomide will be distributed in 10 x 100 mg vials, or a ten day supply only. I do not know if or when we will have an adequate supply. I do know that the clinical trials for wasting can't possibly fill the immediate need for this drug, and that it's unconscionable that Celgene, the company hoping to market it for weight loss, hasn't even applied to set up an emergency release program.</p>

<p><b>Why take thalidomide?</b><br>
In short, with the data from the pilot studies showing significant weight gain, it's a promising drug with years of experience in people, cheap, and offers a specific mechanism of inhibiting an inflammatory chemical called TNF-alpha, that probably aggravates weight loss in PWAs.</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Data</b>: Data on weight loss and thalidomide is from small studies, and largely still unpublished. Anecdotal response is high. Early results from a placebo-controlled Mexican study (400 mg/day) last year showed 8 of 9 people on drug stabilizing or gaining weight, compared to 2/9 on placebo stabilizing. Two Rockefeller studies submitted to the FDA last spring have been reported to show 6% weight gain. [Note: we'll have a chart of different treatments for weight loss <a href="30.html#weight">next issue</a>.]
<p>
<li><b>Experience</b>: Despite its rep, thalidomide seems to be pretty safe. People have taken it for ENL leprosy for 20 years with no side effects. Use in ENL doesn't mean it's as safe for PWAs, but few drugs have been used so extensively.
<p>
<dt>Side effects include allergic reactions (nasty rashes), fever, GI irritation, peripheral neurop-athy, sedation, and masking of TB symptoms. HIV/AIDS trials have used leprosy dosages, 300-400 mg/day, resulting in frequent reports of allergic reactions. 5/10 people in one Rockefeller trial (300 mg/day) had to take less because of side effects. In fact, protocols for the wasting trials have been re-done with lower doses (100-200 mg/day) and more sensible entry criteria.
<p>
<dt>Peripheral neuropathy is a big concern, but its incidence in PWAs seems quite low and the info is confusing. It has not been reported in leprosy patients or from HIV/AIDS trials. Speculations that neuropathy stems from poor quality drug seem to be contradicted by case reports from the 50's in Germany. It seems mostly reversible once off drug, but there is one case report of a PWA with irreversible neuropathy from thalidomide.
<p>
<dt>Active TB or MAC may get missed if you take thalidomide. A depressed immune system can limit how your body responds to TB or MAC, eg, even pulmonary TB often gets missed. So for diagnosis, docs rely on symptoms like fever, weight loss, and night sweats, most of which stem from high levels of TNF-alpha. Thalidomide specifically works against TNF-alpha, so you might not notice symptoms until you have a major case that would have been easier to treat earlier. All PWAs taking thalidomide, who do not have TB or MAC, should be regularly monitored and consider prophylaxis.</p>
<p>
<li><b>Cheap</b>: Thalidomide is marketed at $1.00- 3.00/pill, costs pennies to make, and the dose is 1-2 pills/day. It's no longer under regular patent, and even with Rockefeller's use patent, there's no reason the price should increase much.
<p>
<li><b>Mechanism of action</b>: Thalidomide is an specific blocker of a naturally circulating chemical called TNF-alpha. In several diseases, high TNF-alpha causes symptoms and disease progression. In theory, high TNF-alpha in PWAs either kicks off or aggravates a hyper-metabolic response to HIV infection, the infamous inflammatory cascade. The body prematurely burns up protein in men, probably fat in women, and causes severe weight loss, especially in muscles. This theory is controversial, in no small part because TNF-alpha is quite difficult to measure.Gilla Kaplan, of Rockefeller University, has neatly shown that thalidomide inhibits the mRNA involved in how TNF is made, thereby lowering the amount of circulating TNF without wiping it out altogether. This is important: we need some.TNF-alpha, as proven by various designer anti-TNF drugs for sepsis, whose effectiveness has proven to be very toxic. Thalidomide is much safer.
</ol>

<p>Meanwhile, back on the ranch, what do we have? The FDA and clinical trial sites calling us to see if we're selling thalidomide, ready to blame us for poor trial enrollments and risking public health. Sorry folks, can't blame the underground. Maybe it's time to do some work and revisit protocols that ask PWAs with severe weight loss or who have failed all known ulcer treatments to try a placebo. How about an open label arm for refractory ulcers, and thalidomide v. prednisone arms for early ulcers? How about some ethics here? I'm sick of taking calls from doctors angry with the FDA bullying them about oral ulcer patients, and I'm sick of referring people to a $1000/week compassionate use program for human growth hormone. It's time for thalidomide compassionate use for all PWAs who need it. It's our mission to make available what there's safety and efficacy data to justify providing, so much as I'd rather the FDA and Celgene did their job, once again, we'll do it for them.</p>

<p><b><a name="Roxithromycin">Roxithromycin</a></b></p>

<p>The PWA Health Group now distributes <a href="../info/roxi.html">roxithromycin</a> (Ruclid) for cryptosporidiosis. We used to carry it years ago, but stopped when it failed to pan out as a treatment for toxoplasmosis. Due to the results of two small open label studies, it's available again.</p>

<p>Cryptosporidium parvum is a single-cell parasite that produces 
chronic watery diarrhea in people with compromised immune systems. A diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis is confirmed by a fecal smear or intestinal biopsy. Unfortunately, there is no standard treatment for crytosporidiosis.Roxithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic, very similar to azithromycin and clarithromycin. It is currently used extensively in Europe and Latin American to treat a various number of bacterial infections including chlamydia, sinusitis, respiratory and skin problems. Unfortunately, it has not been studied very much in PWAs.</p>

<p><b>Clinical Studies</b>: At the 1994 International AIDS Conference, two clinical studies reported that roxithromycin might effectively treat crytosporidiosis. In addition, one test tube study has demonstrated activity against MAC (Myco-bacterium avium complex).</p>

<p><b>Crypto studies</b>: In both cryptosporidium studies, PWAs took 300 mg of Roxy twice a day. The first study (10 PWAs) lasted 4 weeks. After two weeks, complete clearance (no diarrhea, negative crypto stool cultures) were reported in 5 PWAs, and a partial response (diarrhea improvement and decreased crypto cultures) were reported by 3. One PWA reported no improvement.</p>

<p>In an earlier, even smaller trial of four PWAs taking 300 mg 2x/day 
for two weeks, all four were successfully treated for diarrhea, with improvements reported in as little as two days. After the two weeks, 3 PWAs were negative for crypto cultures, but the diarrhea came back for the 4th once off drug.</p>

<p>Side effects seem to be minimal, similar to azithromycin, clarithro-, etc. One major concern: the possibility of elevated liver enzymes. Watch them carefully while on the drug. Nonetheless, it may be a relatively safe, effective treatment. Here's hoping.</p>

<p>The FDA has recently granted accelerated approval to Liposome Technology, Inc., to market <a href="../../network/simple/doxil.html">DOX-SL</a> for PWAs with refractory <a href="../../network/simple/ks.html">Kaposi's sarcoma</a>. DOX-SL is a new form of a regular cancer chemotherapy called doxorubicin. It's been packaged in a fatty membrane in order to attack the lesions directly and reduce side effects. Currently, the standard treatments for KS are the same as for a majority of cancers, eg, bleomycin, doxorubicin, etoposide, vinblastine, and vincristine. This is the first time the FDA has ever approved a drug for KS.</p>

<p>DOX-SL is an intravenous drug with dosing schedules similar to standard chemotherapy. It is hoped that encapsulating the drug in lipid membranes, called liposomes, will enable doxorubicin to be delivered directly in a higher concentration to KS lesions, treating them more effectively with fewer systemic side effects.</p>

<p>DOX-SL will probably be used in combination with standard chemotherapy. Side effects may include: hair loss, nausea, and neutropenia. However, G-CSF (Neupogen) can be taken to increase counts.</p>

<p><b><a name="PML">PML</a> and a Tale of Two Drug Companies</b></p>

<p><i>[Editorial note: This article was originally written by the resourceful Theo Smart, who has left us for the greener pastures of Medical School. As a result of last week's meeting with SKB, it's been re-written a bit. The real story of this article is that Theo pretty much singlehandedly with the help of a couple of researchers, has changed the speed and fervor of the discussion around PML and its possible treatment by a class of cancer drugs -sc]</i></p>

<p>PML is a rare disease that destroys tissue (myelin) in the central nervous system and causes lesions in people's brains. It's probably caused by the JC virus, a bug most people have, but which causes disease in people with weak immune systems, particularly PWAs. It seems to us, and a number of researchers, that PML is increasing. People with PML can (but do not always) degenerate rapidly: they may seem fine on Monday, but in severe cases are unable to walk by Friday. The disease may start with subtle changes in mood, followed by problems speaking or seeing, and lead to loss of speech, mobility and sight. Diagnosed by brain biopsy, there is no treatment, which is where this sorry tale begins.</p>

<p>Early last year, Dr. Khalili at Thomas Jefferson University published research showing that topotecan, an analogue of campthotecin (derived from the bark of a chinese tree), suppresses the JC virus in the test tube at low doses.</p>

<p>Excellent news, BUT: we don't know if topotecan will do the same in the body; how well it crosses the blood-brain barrier; or even if targeting the JC virus is the best way to go to stop PML. Nonetheless finding something that is already in phase II/III cancer trials that might work means we have a headstart, as the drug's bio-availability and general safety profile have already been studied.</p>

<p>Topotecan is a very toxic drug, but it appears that the doses that inhibit the JC virus are much lower than cancer doses. So when's a trial for PML starting? Good question. The biggest problem is who owns the license to develop topo-tecan, SmithKline Beecham.</p>

<p><b>SKB: where's the beef ?</b><br>
When naming rich pharmaceutical companies doing AIDS research, SmithKline Beecham (SKB) almost never comes up. The company has had little interest in AIDS, especially as their protease inhibitor didn't pan out. They studied Famci-clovir for herpes, but not in PWAs, a major indication, and most disgustingly, they've been sitting for years on the only known drug for microsporidiosis: <a href="../info/albe.html">albendazole.</a></p>

<p>After the topotecan research was published, Dr. Sidney Huff at Georgetown begged SKB for drug to do a small study with the drug in PWAs. It's not clear what happened, but Dr. Huff did not get permission to use the drug. A client of ours ran into the same stone wall when she asked SKB for compassionate use. And they topped off their refusal to her with the comment that they had no intention of doing any sort of AIDS studies, and if they released drug to her, other requests would follow.</p>

<p>Not a pretty picture. Responding to activists, SKB met with a 
small group on 2/24. SKB said: they're not anti-AIDS drugs; they're energetically pursuing topotecan as an anti-HIV drug, with studies opening this spring; and they promise to release drug to any researcher with a legitimate protocol, BUT they also said that topotecan is too toxic for people with PML, and that although their tiny phase II albendazole trial is in trouble, further study isn't needed as the drug will be approved for a completely different reason by the end of 1995.</p>

<p>Does this mean that Dr. Huff can now get topotecan? We certainly hope so. Does this mean that SKB will fund further studies of topotecan for PML or albendazole for microsporidiosis? Sounds like a big No.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back at the ranch in December, upset with SKB's brush-off of Dr. Huff, we decided to find other options.</p>

<p><b>Drug Companies on Better Behavior</b><br>
Fortunately, there are other derivatives of campthotecin. Roussel's 9-A-C doesn't work in the test tube, which is a pity since the company seems more than willing to run a study.</p>

<p>Another derivative is a cancer drug from Japan, called either 
CPT-11 or irinotecan. When we heard that Dr. Khalili hadn't been able to get CPT-11 from Japan, we let him know that the US license holder, Upjohn, is running cancer trials. We also called Upjohn and got them to send him drug.</p>

<p>Upjohn sent Dr. Khalili both CPT-11 and SN-38 (the active ingredient). Within two weeks, he found that both inhibited the JC virus in the test tube, and that SN-38 was a better JCV inhibitor than topotecan.</p>

<p>Dr. Khalili quickly told Dr. Huff, who immediately started to draft a compassionate use request for two PML patients (one with and one without AIDS). In fact, he stayed up until 4:00 AM one morning, faxed the request to Upjohn, who after looking at Dr. Khalili's work, agreed to release the drug to Dr. Huff as soon as they reviewed the data.</p>

<p>While waiting to hear from Upjohn, Dr. Huff ordered CPT-11 from Japan. He will make it available as soon as he gets IRB approval. He's part of the nationwide VA system, so it should soon be possible for vets with PML to get access to CPT-11 through local VA hospitals. He also plans to put the protocol on the University intramural system, so eventually it will be available in most hospitals.</p>

<p>So where are we now?</p>

<ol>
<li>We should know soon if this class of drugs is helpful for people with PML.
<li>SKB is refusing to finance a PML study, but if Huff's patients do well, they should be immediately pressured to start trials.
<li>SKB says that topotecan is too toxic for people with PML, yet the test tube work indicates that treating PML would require much lower doses than what they currently give advanced cancer patients. This confusion was not cleared up at last week's meeting, and deserves quick attention, especially for those on compassionate use.
</ol>

<p><b>Other issues</b>: It's not at all clear that once someone is unable to walk or speak because of the damage that PML has done to their brains, that any drug will be able to turn them around. We urgently need ways to predict PML , detect early cases of PML, and provide prophylaxis.For example, two years ago, a paper was published showing that active JC virus could be detected by PCR. They found active JCV in circulating lymphocytes of PWAs with and without PML, but JCV in the spinal fluid seemed to be especially reflective of who had PML. A study should be run ASAP to see if whether treating people with JCV in their spinal fluid delays or prevents their getting full-blown PML. Dr. Huff already has plans for such a study.</p>

<p>Finally, the events of the past two months have unfolded so quickly, we can't help but be struck by how easily this could have happened over a year ago, if SmithKline Beecham had bothered to care. Although we don't know how much of an effect topotecan will have in people, if any at all, SmithKline Beecham is complicit in the suffering (and maybe even deaths) of many people.</p>

<p><b><a name="Essiac">Essiac</a></b><br>by<i> Martin A. 
Majchrowicz</i><br>
reprinted from the Jon Greenburg Library with the kind permission of APLA's Treatment Education Program.</p>

<p>This was going to be our Thanksgiving special, but since the last issue got held up for for the Glasgow conference at the end of November, our schedule shifted a bit.</p>

<p>Essaic, an herbal formulation from the Ojibway Indians in Canada, is composed of four herbs; burdock root (Articum lappa), sheep sorrel (Rumex acetosella), turkey rhubarb root (Rheum palmatum), and slippery elm bark (Ulmus fulva). This herbal cure-all has been surrounded by controversy since its potential medicinal qualities were made known by Rene Caisse (Essiac spelled backwards), a Canadian nurse. After her discovery (sic--ts) of Essiac in 1922, Caisse reports treating and "curing" hundreds of people with cancer and other chronic diseases. Due to her paranoia of the exploitation of Essiac, Caisse refused to reveal the Essiac formula. For this reason, Essiac was never researched and developed as a legitimate treatment for cancer.</p>

<p>Eventually Essiac made its way into the United States and into 
the HIV/AIDS community. There are many formulations being distributed by a variety of herbal companies, but supposedly the only effective formulation is the original formulation created by Caisse. According to Gary Glum, former chiropractor, part of the problem is due to the fact that some herbal distributors are substituting yellow dock and curly dock for sheep's sorrel, one of the critical ingredients in Essiac which is responsible for killing cancer cells. The rights to the"original" Essiac now belong to Elaine Alexander, a former radio producer in Vancouver, who is currently working with an unnamed health products company to research, test, manufacture, and distribute Essiac. However, there are a variety of sources for Essiac, in the United States.</p>

<p><b>Mechanism of Action</b><br>
According to Gary Glum, "Sheep's sorrel destroys the cancer 
cells. The other three herbs are blood purifiers." Glum states that "Essiac elevates the enzyme system and gives all cancer patients and all AIDS patients the enzymes that have been destroyed. Essiac elevates the enzyme system; it elevates the hormone system, which elevates the immune system, so the body can cure its own disease.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Jim Chan, a naturopathic physician and instructor at Bastyr College in Seattle, "burdock root (one of the four herbs in Essiac) contains inulin, a very powerful immune modulator. The inulin hooks on to the surface of white blood cells and makes them work better."Some distribute a form of Essiac called Native Legend Tea. The difference is Native Legend Tea includes a fifth herb, water cress. The addition of this herb supposedly brings the Essiac formula closer to the original formula used by the Indians.</p>

<p>The reality is,there has been no basic research done with these 
herbs to demonstrate their true mechanisms of action.</p>

<p><b>Studies</b><br>
There are no documented clinical trials of Essiac, only anecdotal reports. In July, 1991, the Canadian Journal of Herbalism published an article titled "Old Ontario Remedies." It contains some positive anecdotal information from people who used Essiac.</p>

<p>Gary Glum claims he conducted a clinical study using "patients" from <a href="http://www.gus.com/care/apla/apla.html">AIDS Project Los Angeles</a> (APLA). According to Glum, "They [APLA] had sent 179 patients home to die. They all had pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and histoplasmosis. Their weight was down to about 100 pounds. Their T-4 cell counts were less than ten. The Project gave me five of these patients. I took them off <a href="../../network/simple/zido.html">AZT</a> and <a href="../../network/simple/dida.html">ddI</a> and put them on Essiac three times a day. They are the only ones alive today(the other 174 are dead). They're exercising three times a day and eating three meals a day. Their weight is back to normal. For all intents and purposes, you wouldn't know they were sick a day in their lives."</p>

<p>APLA does not provide medical services. APLA does not "give" 
clients to researchers for clinical trials. APLA is a community based AIDS service organization which provides social services and education. The bottom line is the study sited in several articles by Gary Glum never occurred.</p>

<p><b>Comment</b><br>
Essiac is an herbal formulation that may have some benefits for 
people with HIV/AIDS, but the only information is anecdotal. Only laboratory and clinical studies will confirm the anti-tumor and immune-modulating effects of Essiac.</p>

<p><a name="AZT/3TC Surprise"><b>AZT/3TC Surprise</b></a></p>

<p>The <a href="../../network/simple/combo.html">combination</a> of AZT/3TC produces the most profound sustained reduction of virus levels ever seen in people with HIV, according to data released at a conference in Glasgow. The combo produced dramatic responses in other surrogate markers too, including CD4 cell counts. The information came from two European studies, one in people who had never taken nucleoside analogues, and one in people who had been on AZT.</p>

<p><a href="../../network/simple/three.html">3TC</a> is a new nucleoside analogue chemically unrelated to <a href="../../network/simple/zido.html">AZT</a>, <a href="../../network/simple/dida.html">ddI</a>, <a href="../../network/simple/zalc.html">ddC</a> or <a href="../../network/simple/stav.html">d4T</a> that has activity against HIV and hepatitis B. It seems to be far and away the least toxic of these drugs, although at higher doses (around 1000 mg a day) neutropenia has been reported. Other side effects such as headache, rash, and fever happen rarely and may not actually be caused by the drug. But because of the rapid development of resistance to 3TC by itself, hopes were slim that it would be of much use in PWAs. The results from these two studies surprised everyone.</p>

<p><b>The AZT naive study</b><br>
The six month study was in 129 people with CD4 cell counts between 100-400 with an average of 271. At the end of 6 months, 108 people opted to stay on open label follow-up through week 48. There were two arms: AZT (200 mg 3xday) versus AZT (same dose) plus 3TC (300 mg 2xday).</p>

<p><b>Results:</b> People on the combo got a 1.5 log reduction (more than 92%) of viral load by week 4. This stayed 90% below the level that people had when they began the study (baseline) through week 48. People on AZT got a .7 log reduction, that returned to baseline by six months.</p>

<p>People on the combo got an average increase of 85 CD4 cells by week 8, which remained at +80 CD4 cells at six months. By the end of 48 weeks CD4 cells were still 49 above baseline. People on AZT had an average increase of 38 CD4 cells by week 8, which fell to 7 cells below baseline by the end of six months. However, people on the AZT arm who switched to combo therapy at the end of six months got a 40 CD4 cell rise, and a reduction in viral load.</p>

<p><b>Previous AZT Use Study</b><br>
The data wasn't as complete for this six month study, which was in 223 people with CD4 cell counts between 100-400 (the average was 250). There were three arms: AZT (200 mg 3xday) vs the same dose of AZT plus one of two doses of 3TC (300 mg 2xday or 150 mg 2xday). People had an average of about 2 years prior AZT use.</p>

<p><b>Results</b>: The was no major difference between the two combo arms. Together they showed a 47 cell increase by week 8, and by week 24, people still had an average of 33 cells above baseline. Those who continued on AZT alone fell 21 cells below baseline. Combo patients also got a 75-86% reduction in p24 levels, sustained for the duration of the study. People on AZT only got a 24% reduction.</p>

<p><b>What does it all mean?</b><br>
While there is no data on clinical endpoints (symptoms or opportunistic infection), these are frankly the best viral load responses ever seen (at least for the AZT naive study). The fact that the response is sustained for a year in most patients is important since, according to results from viral load studies, people are less likely to progress as long as their viral load is suppressed. Even better, there was no difference in toxicity on any arm in either study. If anything, according to the researchers, people on the combination experienced less side effects.</p>

<p>There is a 3TC compassionate use program for anyone with less than 300 CD4 cells who has tried other antivirals. You can even take other drugs at the same time, as long as you let Glaxo (the makers) know. To enroll, your doc should call 1 (800) 248-9757.</p>

<p><b><a name="Viral Load Tests">Viral Load Tests</a></b></p>

<p>[<b>Editor's Note</b>: Lately, there has been much discussion about new <a href="../../network/simple/viral.html">viral load tests</a> being used by doctors and people with HIV to guide treatment decisions like whether to start taking antivirals or to switch drug regimens. But so far there isn't much real world experience using the tests. For this and other reasons, some researchers and treatment activists are concerned that the tests are too new for people to use this way. Unfortunately, this stance serves as a barrier to access. The danger is that for the next few years, if there is any benefit to be derived from using the viral load tests, it will be enjoyed only by a few patients who have progressive doctors in big cities. But it should be your decision to make. The number one thing to know is that you are going to be given a number ranging from 0 to several million or so from your doctor. What that number means is anyone's guess, but it does seem clear that 10,000 or less is pretty good. Getting a higher result can be really scary, but we don't know what it means. The most we can do is to let you know what we know about these tests, with the caveat that everything that we think we are sure about today could turn out to be completely wrong tomorrow.]</p>

<p>Two new laboratory tests that measure how much virus is in your blood, Hoffmann-La Roche's HIV RNA PCR, and Chiron's branched DNA (bDNA), are now available for anyone who has the cash to pay for them. Both tests count the little strips of HIV's genetic material (RNA) in a blood sample. These tests have become widely used in clinical trials because they quickly show whether a new drug is truly having an effect against the virus in people. Individual doctors can now order the tests to measure viral load levels in their patients. To get your viral load measured, all your doctor has to do is draw some of your blood and send it off to one of the special labs that performs the test.</p>

<p><b>Why Use The Tests?</b></br>
People with HIV clearly need better surrogate markers, or ways to figure out whether the disease is progressing. Yes, CD4 counts are helpful — they are generally a good indicator of the state of your immune system and are great for deciding, say, whether to take prophylactic meds like Bactrim. But CD4 cell counts are not always helpful for making other major treatment decisions.</p>

<p><b>When to Start Taking Nukes</b><br>
For example, at what CD4 cell count should you start taking nucleoside analogues? Some people have CD4 counts floating around 300 for years and they seem perfectly healthy without taking any medications at all. If that's the boat you're in, it's easy to understand why you might not want to risk the side effects of the nucleosides or develop resistance to them before you really need them. Furthermore, the Concorde study confirmed that it made no sense to start taking them too early.</p>

<p>One reason early intervention with AZT failed in Concorde may be because early HIV activity is localized in the lymph nodes, and AZT doesn't seem to affect the virus there. Eventually the virus bursts out of the lymph nodes and starts infecting large numbers of CD4 cells. At this point, the nucleoside analogues do have an effect, and using them may delay progression. Once again, you can't necessarily tell whether this has happened by looking at your CD4 cell count. But it would be good to know because most people begin to progress within a couple years of this viral outburst.</p>

<p>When the virus breaks out of the lymph nodes there is a sudden sustained increase in viral load which the viral load tests should be able to detect. While there is no absolute number, research does suggest that viral load counts below 10,000 RNA per ml may indicate that most of your virus is still sitting snug as a bug in your lymph nodes. According to a couple studies, at least, people whose viral levels stay below 10,000 don't seem to be at great risk of progressing. At the high end, viral load can range into several million RNA per ml.</p>

<p><b>Monitoring a Drug's Antiviral Effect</b><br>
When or if ever you decide to take an antiviral, it would be great to know whether it's working in your body. This may be especially useful in the case of alternative and complementary therapies that have little clinical data by which to check absorption, dose or efficacy. Small changes in CD4 cell counts don't seem to be a reliable way of gauging a drug's antiviral effect. Furthermore, most antivirals only work for a limited time, since the virus eventually becomes resistant. It would be great if there was some chart that shows how long each drug works, but there isn't, because it depends on the individual.</p>

<p>In theory, by measuring your viral load, you may be able to tell whether the drug(s) you are taking is keeping your virus in check. To do this you should look at the change in viral load over time.</p>

<p>It's best to take your first test before you try a new treatment, or combo of treatments. This is your baseline test. Then a month or two after starting your treatment, you can order a second test to see if there's any change. Your subsequent tests should stay significantly below the baseline or the drug is probably no longer working for you. But there are some hitches.</p>

<p><b>Test Variability</b><br>
A number of factors can easily skew the results. Vaccines for the flu or hepatitis can cause a temporary explosion of viral load. Opportunistic infections or even getting the flu can also temporarily drive up viral levels. So it's probably a waste to get a test soon after you've gotten vaccinated or when you are fighting off some secondary infection. It may take a couple of months for your system to get back to normal.</p>

<p>But even more disturbing is that some viral load results you get on these tests might simply be off. We aren't sure how often this occurs, but apparently if you send in two samples, you can get very different results on them. With both tests, there can be as much as three fold variation in the results that you get. A result of 30,000 might also come back as 90,000 or at 10,000. As you can see, this can make interpreting your results next to impossible. For example, a reading of 90,000 for one test and 30,000 on the next might mean that there hasn't been any change at all.</p>

<p>Again, we aren't sure how often this happens. According to researchers at the Aaron Diamond Institute, they have never seen it happen with Chiron's bDNA test — they said it varies by 15% at the most. Roche's RNA PCR seems much more variable. So just like CD4 cell counts, if you get a really weird result, it may make sense to stay cool until the next test.</p>

<p>Still, an antiviral should have a much more profound effect on the viral load than a three fold change, if it is working. For example, AZT/3TC achieves a 10 fold (1 log) reduction in viral load, which means that if you start with 100,000, you should go down to around 10,000 RNA per ml.</p>

<p><b>Differences Between the Tests</b><br>
Other than the variability between the tests, they both appear to yield very similar results. Roche's HIV RNA PCR is significantly more sensitive — it can detect as few as 200 strips of RNA per milliliter of plasma. Chiron's bDNA can't detect below 10,000 RNA per ml (although in the future it will be able to). This distinction may not be very important since, as above, having less than 10,000 copies may mean you're unlikely to get life threatening opportunistic infections or progress to AIDS.</p>

<p>One thing to consider is the cost. bDNA runs @ $200 per test. HIV RNA PCR costs $250-300. This is important because the tests are available only in a sort of regulatory limbo. The FDA has not given approval for the test's commercial use, but they can be marketed for "research" purposes. The upshot is that Medicaid won't pay for them. Many insurance companies may not either, although recently we've heard that some doctors have had success submitting the bills with the rest of their patient's bloodwork. Regardless, if you can find the cash, your doctor can get them for you. To get Roche's, your doctor should call 1 (800) 533-0567. For Chiron's: 1 (800) 553-5445.</p>

<p><b>Unresolved Issues</b><br>
We still don't know is whether reducing the amount of virus, as measured by these tests, will keep you from getting new opportunistic infections or restore your immune system, or how much of a reduction is necessary to achieve this. Only a large clinical trial that measures both changes in viral load and opportunistic infections or deaths can conclusively show this, and that could take a few years.</p>

<p><b><a name="Prescription Drugs With Anti-HIV Effects">Prescription Drugs With Anti-HIV Effects</a></b></p>

<p>A number of drugs approved for other uses have reported activity against HIV. Since these are approved drugs, there's usually a lot of information about absorption and toxicity. And with the availability of the new viral load tests, you may be able to tell whether your alternative anti-viral regimen is doing anything.</p>

<p>So here's a list you might want to incorporate into your own private case study. We also mention a couple drugs that have gotten some press lately, but that you should probably avoid.</p>

<p><b>Aspirin, 5-ASA (mesalamine) and sulfasalazine</b>: There isn't a drug more available than aspirin. 5-ASA and sulfasalazine are two of a number of aspirin relatives available with prescription. This class of drugs appears to slow the production of HIV because of their anti-inflammatory activity. In one study in three people with HIV and Reiter's syndrome, sulfasalazine brought about unexpected CD4 cell increases. A study of aspirin is currently running at CRIA in New York City. Aspirin can cause stomach ulcers and increased bleeding, particularly at higher doses. Sulfasalazine can cause more severe reactions, including liver and kidney damage. Since it is a sulfa drug like Bactrim, some people can experience life threatening allergic reactions. Most of this toxicity can be avoiding by taking 5-ASA, which is a metabolite of sulfasalazine. However, it is rectally administered as a suppository or suspension. In the meantime, ketotifen, the anti-histamine that we import to help people gain weight, has very similar anti-inflammatory activity to 5-ASA. To our knowledge, no one has evaluated its effect on HIV.)</p>

<p><b>Dipyridamole, brand name Persantine</b>: Persantine is an oral drug approved for people who have undergone heart valve surgery. In the test tube, it increases the anti-viral effect of AZT. It decreases T-cells uptake of thymidine, a natural nucleotide that competes with AZT. With less thymidine available, there is a greater chance that HIV's reverse transcriptase will latch onto AZT, which messes everything up for the virus. A small study in 12 people with HIV reports that at least the combination of AZT and persantine was safe, although they haven't yet shown whether it worked better. Toxicity is very rare but includes gut trouble, headaches and rash. Even when there are such reactions, they reportedly go away after a short time on drug.</p>

<p><b>Hydroxychloroquine</b>: This is an old anti-malarial drug, also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. A number of explanations have been offered to explain its anti-HIV effect in the test tube: 1) it reduces the acidity of the environment inside the cell, which makes HIV infection difficult; 2) it decreases TNF-alpha, and IL-6 activation of latent virus; 3) it decreases the production of HIV's protein gp-120, which reduces infection rates.</p>

<p>A placebo controlled study run by CRIA, and Mt. Sinai in people with HIV and CD4 cells between 200-500 reported that hydroxychloroquine stabilized CD4 cell counts, caused a 7 fold reduction in viral load and reduced IL-6 levels. While there were no toxicities, long term high doses of hydroxychloroquine can cause eye damage. It also may rarely cause headaches, dizziness and gut trouble.</p>

<p><b>Hydroxyurea</b>: This is a horrible cancer chemotherapy that Gallo and his crew have been touting as a potential anti-viral. It reduces the pool of nucleotides — thereby stopping DNA construction. Gallo's crew say the doses that inhibit HIV are "non-toxic." Given that many things Gallo touts fail to pan out, we'd wait for some other lab to confirm the findings or for safety data in PWAs before rushing out for this one. Activists are trying to push Bristol-Myers to do a small study.</p>

<p><b>Methotrexate</b>: Same story as above, but possibly even worse. This is an extremely toxic drug that can kill you very quickly. However, it is used for cancer, severe psoriasis and even rheumatoid arthritis. But the physician's desk reference lists literally pages of precautions. Why is anyone even looking at it? Because the anti-viral activity was profound -- complete suppression of the virus -- in the test tube.</p>

<p><b>Cysteamine &amp; Cystamine</b>: We're particularly interested in these so we're going to spend some extra time on them. These compounds have well established effects against radiation toxicity (they have some protective effects on stem cells and bone marrow -- the Soviets used them extensively after Chernobyl, and who know how many other unannounced nuclear mishaps). Their primary use in the West is for a very rare inherited disease called cystinosis, where cystine accumulates in children's organs and can eventually cause kidney damage, vision problems and other conditions. Like NAC, cysteamine has been used to treat Tylenol overdoses.</p>

<p>Cysteamine, available for years through a limited treatment IND program, was recently approved for cystinosis. Cystamine is a very closely related compound that forms when cysteamine is left standing in air, or becomes oxidized in the body. While much of their biologic activity is similar, there are differences, so we can't take for granted that what is true of one will be true of the other. Both have shown anti-HIV activity in the test tube via different mechanisms, but the anti-HIV activity of cystamine seems unique.</p>

</p>An abstract at Yokohama presented data showing that both compounds reduce HIV reproduction stimulated by Il-6, TNF-alpha, and GM-CSF in both T cells and macrophages. Treated cells were also free of syncytia (globs of CD4 cells, and HIV stuck together).</p>

<p>Cysteamine has potent anti-oxidant properties. It can increase glutathione levels by paralyzing a cellular enzyme that limits the amount of glutathione that a cell can produce. It does not appear that cystamine has quite the same effect on glutathione in the test tube.</p>

<p>Cystamine may inhibit HIV in a unique way. In another study, researchers scanned HIV-infected cells that they had treated with cystamine, using an electron microscope to see what part of HIV's life cycle cystamine was upsetting. They found that somehow cystamine had interfered with the construction of new virus, leaving virions deformed and non-infectious. Exactly how is unclear, but it probably isn't a protease inhibitor.</p>

<p>The researchers didn't check whether cysteamine does the same thing, which is a bummer because it is the approved drug. Much of cysteamine turns into cystamine in the body, but we aren't sure whether it is enough to have this effect.</p>

<p>The small company that makes cysteamine, Mylan Pharmaceuticals has run small safety studies in people with HIV. Thus far it seems safe. However, like NAC or aspirin, it may cause gastric ulcers. It also may have strange effects on pituitary hormones like prolactin and somatostatin, but it isn't clear want this might mean in people with HIV. It has also been reported to cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) in rats. Regardless, it has been used for years in children, with no serious side effects reported.</p>

<p><b><a name="Updates on Health Group Products">Updates on Health Group Products</a></b></p>

<p><b><a href="../info/dhea.html">DHEA</a>:</b><br>
A study was recently published that evaluated the effects of small amounts of DHEA (50 mg each night) in men and women aged between 40-70, since people produce less DHEA as they get older. The researchers came up with the dose by calculating how much DHEA it would take to get people up to the levels produced in their twenties. After two weeks on DHEA, people's DHEA blood levels almost doubled. Women on DHEA saw their level of masculinizing hormones, such as testosterone increase. Interestingly, only one woman reported increased facial hair but so did one on placebo. There was no change in libido, but people on DHEA did feel significantly better both physically, and moodwise. They slept better, felt more relaxed, had increased energy and a better ability to handle stress. Another interesting change was an increase in insulin-like growth factor levels, a hormone that stimulates anabolism (the construction of body tissue, including muscle but not fat). However, no change in weight or body fat percentage was seen over the three months on DHEA.</p>

<p>The low doses used in this study are significant. Many PWAs are taking much higher doses. In a 1993 study that looked at doses ranging from 750 to 2,250 mg a day, there was no proportional increase in the amount of DHEA absorbed with the higher doses. Perhaps people have been taking way too much for years, and not absorbing most of it. The Health Group now provides DHEA in both 250 and 50 mg doses.</p>

<p>A small study using lower doses has been run in PWAs by a researcher in Texas. A poster at Yokohama presented data from the twelve people taking 75 mg DHEA per day. Two PWAs died before a year had passed, but nine out of ten of the remaining patients had an increase in CD4 cell counts. Of course, these little uncontrolled studies are impossible to interpret. But we'd like to know whether people's DHEA levels went back to normal, and whether there was an effect on other hormones. We've been trying to get ahold of this researcher to find out.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Dr. Don Kotler has been talking about DHEA a lot lately (see September's Treatment Issues). He thinks someone should run a study to see whether it restores testosterone levels, or has an anabolic effect in men and women. Maybe he could run the study.</p>

<p><b><a href="../info/nac.html">NAC</a>:</b><br>
There was some interesting data at Yokohama from some clinical studies that used NAC. One Brazilian study looked at 15 people with HIV given NAC for a month. 8 people got 400 mg iv 2x/day, seven got 600 oral 2x/day. The average CD4 cell counts on iv went from 257 to 502, CD8s from 1108 to 1706. On oral, the changes were not as great, but the average counts went from 406 to 563 (CD4) and 1449 to 2376 (CD8).</p>

<p>Much more interesting was a three arm Mexican study in 300 people with HIV and <500 CD4 cells. The study compared <a href="../../network/simple/zido.html">AZT</a> to AZT/<a href="../../network/simple/zalc.html">ddC</a> and AZT/ddC/NAC (1500 oral). Some problems with the study: the groups were not perfectly matched — those on the AZT arm had the highest baseline CD4 counts, the highest Karnofsky scores and the fewest prior AIDS defining events; meanwhile those on the 3 drug combo had 100 less CD4 cells on average. Nevertheless, a third of the people on AZT alone died, only 11% of the people died on the other arms. The percentages of new AIDS defining events were 62, 32 and 23% respectively. CD4 counts were taken every four months. AZT arm: CD4s went from 247 to 270 back down to 236 and then 181. AZT/ddC: 175 to 231, 286 and 293. The NAC combo: 148 to 241, 303, and finally 356. While the differences between the two drug arm and the three drug NAC may not be statistically significant, they certainly seem to show a trend toward greater response on the three drug combo.</p>

<p><b><a href="../info/pept.html">Peptide T</a>:</b><br>
A British abstract at Yokohama presented data showing that Peptide T lowers TNF-alpha in the test tube. Doug McFadden has reported this before, but this was some of the first data we've seen. Given that elevated TNF-alpha is now being implicated in HIV associated neuro-cognitive problems, this could be partly explain how peptide T could reduce these symptoms. It could also partly explain some of the weight gain that people claim to experience. Still, a lot of things lower TNF-alpha in the test tube; this is much harder to accomplish in people. Also, we've heard there is a 200 person neurocog study open in Europe. The results from a similar study in California are expected in June, 1995.</p>

<p><b><a href="../info/riba.html">Ribavirin</a>:</b><br>
ICN has filed a new drug application for oral ribavirin as a treatment of hepatitis C. Who knows how long it will take the FDA to process this, or even whether they will approve their application. This delay will of course cost anyone taking ribavirin for chronic hep C a lot — at present, one month's worth of ribavirin for this use is $558. But ICN now has a limited compassionate use program that provides ribavirin for free to people with proof of chronic hepatitis C who can't take interferon, or who have cases that don't respond to interferon. Proof may require a liver biopsy or PCR test in people with low antibody titres (not uncommon in PWAs). For more information your doctor should call Dr. John Gate at ICN: (714) 545-0100.</p>

<p><b>Ribavirin/ddI Combo:</b><br>
A number of people take ribavirin with ddI because of test tube studies that suggest that they are synergistic.</p>

<p>The ACTG just finished a small study of ribavirin and ddI which showed that the combo was safe. The researchers reported that the anti-viral effect (as measured by viral load) was greater than normally seen with ddI alone, but since this wasn't a controlled study, there is no way to tell whether this was a fluke. To find out, they plan to run a larger controlled study.</p>

<p><b><a name="SSKT"><a href="../info/sskt.html">SSKT</a></a></b><br>
[<b>Ed's note</b>: We recently updated our fact sheet on SSKT. Since 
some of the information is new or has never been in the Notes, we thought we'd reprint a edited version of it here.]</p>

<p>Sho-saiko-to (SSKT) otherwise known as Minor Bupleurum Combination or Xiao Chai Hu Tang is an ancient herbal preparation used in Asia to treat what the Chinese call lesser yang disorders, which includes fevers, the flu, bronchitis, lung infections, pulmonary TB, malaria, jaundice and hepatitis. Here in the 20th century, researchers have produced evidence supporting many of these traditional uses in test tube, animal studies and clinical trials in people — particularly for chronic hepatitis and liver cancer. Recent research also suggests that it may have anti-HIV effects.</p>

<p>Probably because it is a blend of medicinal plants, SSKT has a wide range of activity in test tube and animal studies that can be broken down into three main categories: 1) anti-oxidant/anti-inflammatory effects, 2) immune stimulating effects, 3) and anti-viral/tumor effects.</p>

<p><b>As an anti-oxidant/anti-inflammatory</b>: SSKT acts as a free radical scavenger, preserving levels of glutathione in mice livers. It has been shown to protect the liver against a variety of toxins, including chemotherapeutic drugs. It also dramatically reduces oxidative stress in the brains of aging mice. It has also been shown to treat ulcers, diabetes and stomach irritation in rodents.</p>

<p><b>As an immune-modulator</b>: Again, in vitro and animal studies show SSKT having wide ranging effects on the immune system. It activates macrophages without boosting TNF-alpha; stimulates CTLs (the part of the immune system that kills infected or cancerous cells), NK cells and the production of antibodies; boosts G-CSF, and gamma-interferon (and maybe some harmful cytokines too). And it boosts T cells in rats.</p>

<p><b>Anti-viral/anti-tumor effects</b>: SSKT has been shown to have anti-viral effects against hepatitis B, HTLV and HIV. Extracts from one ingredient, scute, seem responsible for most of this activity (although glycyrrhizin, another ingredient also has similar documented anti-viral effects). Meanwhile, even though some of the herbs in SSKT have anti-cancer effects, as a mix it exhibits much more potent inhibition of cancer cells. It stops cancer cells in mice livers, and colons from proliferating, and may even kill them.</p>

<p><b>SSKT for People with HIV</b>: We don't know whether SSKT helps people with HIV. Both SSKT and some of its ingredients have separately shown activity against the virus in test tube studies. One study showed SSKT stopped HIV's reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme in lymphocytes taken from asymptomatic people with HIV; these doses were somewhat less effective in blood drawn from people with symptoms, and had little or no effect against virus from PWAs. A more recent in vitro study shows that much lower doses than would normally work dramatically suppress the virus when given with AZT. But we don't know whether people with HIV can absorb enough SSKT to have an antiviral effect. Furthermore, the RT enzyme becomes resistant to most drugs aimed at it within months or weeks. We don't know anything about the development of resistance to SSKT. Studies of SSKT in people with HIV might answer some of these questions.</p>

<p>A Japanese study published at the V International AIDS Conference reported CD4 and CD8 cell improvements in 7 out of 13 patients treated with SSKT over six months, but it didn't mention the doses they used. To our knowledge there have been no other studies, other than a rumored underground study in New York, and one just beginning in Australia.</p>

<p><b>SSKT for Other Conditions</b>: There have been several studies of SSKT for hepatitis B, although none were well designed. One six month study in 80 people with chronic hep B reported decreases in viral load, antigen and 50% improvements in liver function. Another study in twenty six patients with chronic hep b reported even better results in eleven of the participants treated with SSKT. Seven out of fourteen children with chronic hep B cleared antigen within six months in yet another study of SSKT.</p>

<p>The largest (260 people) and best designed trial of SSKT that we've been able to find evaluated whether the blend could delay or prevent the development of liver cancer in people with cirrhosis. Participants were treated with 7.5 grams a day of SSKT or standard therapy. After 34 months, 17 people on standard therapy developed lesions in their livers compared to just 9 on SSKT.</p>

<p>Some of the ingredients of SSKT (bupleurum, and scute) in combination with a couple of other herbs including astragalus were compared to ritalin in 7 to 14 year old children with attention deficit disorders. The herbal blend was as effective as ritalin, without the toxicity. The children who did the best on the herbal combo got the highest boost in IQ points (10 points to be specific).</p>

<p><b>Side Effects and Drug Interactions</b>: Side effects from taking SSKT are very rare. However, there are a few documented cases of SSKT causing lung inflammation in elderly patients. There are no reports of interactions of SSKT with other drugs. SSKT is often used in Asian countries to protect patients against the toxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs.</p>

<p>While traditional Chinese medicinal doctors may treat their patients with their own formulations, SSKT based on the ancient formula of seven medicinal plants is available as a pharmaceutical product in Asian countries. The PWA Health Group imports Sun Ten brand Minor Bupleurum Combination from Taiwan. It is composed of bupleurum, scute, pinellia, fresh Ginger, ginseng, jujube, and glycyrrhizin, according to the ancient formula. It comes in bottles of 120 x 500 mg tablets, which can be dissolved (four at a time) in a cup of hot water and drunk as a tea, before or after meals.</p>

<p><b><a name="Chinese and Other Traditional Medicines">Chinese and Other Traditional Medicines</a></b></p>

<p>Perhaps because the AIDS conference was in Japan, there was a lot of information on traditional or indigenous medicines, including Chinese, African, and Ayurvedic. A number of alternative products were studied in people with HIV. Some carefully, some not. There was also interesting test tube data. Here's a brief sketch.</p>

<p><b>Test tube studies:</b><br>
<b>Morus Alba — San Baipa</b>: This Chinese asthma/cough remedy has anti-HIV effects.</p>

<p><b>Peptide T22</b>: At first we thought that this was some sort of Peptide T knock-off. It isn't. It's not really a traditional medicine either, but it is an extract from Japanese Horseshoe crabs that interferes with the binding of HIV to CD4 cells. </p>	

<p><b>Messy studies</b>:<br>
These studies were poorly designed and hard to interpret, but that doesn't mean the products aren't worth further study. Just to list a few:</p>

<p><b>Active Hemicellulose Compound (AHCC)</b> is a mushroom extract,</p>

<p><b>Mariandina-A</b> is an African medley of anti-oxidants and micronutrients, Perthon is a blend of medicinal plants, AIDS-NO.1, Herb Tea #1, and Marvel are blends of Chinese herbs. The researchers of Marvel made particularly big claims —seroconversions in people in Kenya) and then there's: </p>	

<p><b>GLYKE! (WE LIKE GLYKE!!!) </b>What is it? We don't know. Maybe it is just a form of glycyrrhizin. Anyway there were two different reports on the same study run in 112 PWHIVs in Tanzania. The abstracts were a little confusing, but you could glean a few things from them: Only half of the patients improved — which doesn't sound unreasonable, some of this improvement was in CD4/CD8 ratios, CD4 counts; fatigue, anorexia and wasting "ameliorated." 3 patients supposedly sero-converted to negative. I know, I know. What is interesting here is that the researchers went the extra step and did HIV PCR on the sero-converters, who turned out to be positive after all. The unethical (or the researchers of "Marvel") would not have included this detail.</p>	

<p><b>Slightly Less Messy Studies</b><br>
<b>Korean Red Ginseng (KRG)</b>: This study in 145 PWAs had four arms — no treatment, AZT, KRG and AZT/KRG combo. The results were hard to read, maybe because of translation problems but it seemed that there was some immunologic improvement on KRG, and while everyone's CD4 cell count dropped over the course of the study, the people on combo KRG/AZT had the smallest decline.</p>	

<p><b>Lentinan</b>: Shiitake mushroom is an extract approved in Japan for cancer. One test tube study showed that it is a potent TNF suppressor. A study in PWAs that plans to enroll 100 pts (70 so far) is comparing ddI monotherapy to combination ddI/and iv lentinan. The combination has been well tolerated so far (no side effects seen). The study is still blinded. However, other studies in people with HIV have failed to show any benefit. </p>	

<p><b>Punica granatum</b>: This is latin for pomegranate. There is a fair amount of research showing that extracts from parts of the plant, the fruit included, have anti-diarrheal, and anti-microbial activity. Over a period of eight years, researchers in Tanzania gave 390 people with HIV and diarrhea tea made from pomegranates. In 95% of the people diarrhea stopped within two to four days. These people gained weight and there were no severe drug reactions. While this was not a controlled study, these figures are still pretty impressive, and hell, pomegranates grow on trees.</p>

<p><b><a name="Saccharomyces boulardii">Saccharomyces boulardii</a>--The Yeast Also Rises</b></p>

<p><a href="../info/sacc.html">Saccharomyces boulardii</a> (SB) is a live yeast packaged in capsules and sold over the counter in Europe to treat diarrhea. Test-tube and animal studies suggests that SB protects the gut from amoebas and cholera, may keep candida from spreading, and alleviates diarrhea caused by taking antibiotics, including c. difficile (c. diff). Clinical studies confirm that SB has activity against c. diff diarrhea in adults and infants, prevents traveler's diarrhea, and reduces diarrhea in patients with Crohn's disease. One study of PWAs with severe diarrhea, that didn't respond to anything else, reported dramatic improvements with high dose SB within days. In the U.S., SB is available only through clinical trials, and in a few health food stores, but the quality of health food store SB is open to question. Because of its lack of availability, the PWA Health Group has begun importing SB from Europe for PWAs with diarrhea.</p>

<p><b>How do you do the things you do?</b><br>
It isn't clear how SB works but researchers have come up with enough explanations to fill a book. Most test-tube studies report that it doesn't kill the bacterial, fungal or parasitic infections. 1) The yeast or something it secretes, may keep toxins produced by infections from binding to cells, and from triggering inflammation inside the gut. 2) Other researchers suggest that it may stimulate the production of certain protective immune globulins that kill the infections. 3) SB may also directly compete with amoebas and candida in the micro-environment of the intestine ("there ain't room in this gut for the both of us").</p>

<p>One test-tube study found that SB kept amoebas from binding to red blood cells, (which is a necessary step in their life-cycle). Another study reported that immune suppressed mice continuously fed SB had 10 to 50 times less candida than untreated mice. And, there may even be other possible explanations of SB's activity: a recent test-tube study suggests that a by-product of the yeast may have anti-bacterial properties.</p>

<p><b>SB for C. diff and other antibiotic diarrhea</b><br>
Over the last ten years, SB has been studied in people with diarrhea from a number of different causes. A very common and difficult to treat diarrhea comes from taking antibiotics. Some drugs, e.g., clindamycin, can upset the natural balance in the miniature ecosystem inside your gut. The antibiotics often kill off little organisms you need to maintain a healthy digestive system. When the beneficial bugs are gone, other naturally occurring bacteria and yeast may rage out of control — without their natural predators to keep them in check. C. diff causes the most trouble, probably because it is resistant to all but the strongest antibiotics, such as vancomycin, a fairly toxic drug. Even this drug often fails to wipe out the bacteria, and recurrence of severe diarrhea is fairly common.</p>

<p>A number of studies using SB have been conducted in people with antibiotic and C. diff diarrhea. In one, 13 people with recurrent C. diff tried a regimen of thirty days SB plus 10 days of vancomycin. Eleven had no more recurrence of C. diff. A study of 180 people on various antibiotics placebo or SB reported that 22% of the people on placebo got diarrhea, but only 9.5% on SB did. Finally, one case study chronicles a horrible recurrent case of C. diff in a 67 year old woman. She had at least 6 incidents of the diarrhea over an eight month period (four were so severe that she required hospitalization), and lost 23 pounds over a three month period. Finally, her doctors tried SB, 500 mg twice a day for nine weeks, then tapered off to 250 mg twice daily for 10 more days. Her diarrhea soon stopped, and she had no further recurrence for at least 18 months after going off SB.</p>

<p><b>Use in Infants with C diff</b><br>
But you don't have elderly. A study with nineteen infants with C. diff reports dramatic results as well. The children were given 250 mg of SB two to four times a day depending on their age. After one week of therapy, symptoms had resolved in 18 of 19. After one month there was a complete clearance of C. diff from 14 out of 19 infant's stools. Relapses occurred in two of the kids but both quickly responded to a second fifteen day course on SB.</p>

<p><b>Three thousand Austrians can't be wrong</b><br>
Ever wonder what to pack to keep from getting diarrhea on the Marrakesh express? SB looks pretty good according to the largest study yet, which was conducted in three thousand Austrians traveling to exotic locations where diarrhea is common. The researchers gave the travelers either 250 or 1000 mg a day of SB or placebo. Austrians on SB had a significantly fewer cases of diarrhea than those on placebo. Also, there seemed to be fewer cases on high dose than low dose, and interestingly enough, it worked better depending on where they traveled to, for example in North Africa and Turkey.</p>

<p>Another Germanic study, published in Zeitgeist fur Gesundheit, or something like that, evaluated SB in 20 patients with Crohn's disease, a life-long syndrome where people intermittently suffer from inflammation and lesions in their intestines, severe diarrhea, abdominal pain and loss of weight. Patients in this study were all treated with SB (250 mg two times a day) for two weeks. All had fewer bowel movements. Half then continued on SB, while the others were put on placebo for another ten weeks. The group on SB had a significant reduction in bowel movements while the group on placebo went back to the same number of bowel movements that they had had when the study began.</p>

<p><b>SB in People With AIDS</b><br>
Some researchers Francais decided to try SB in thirty PWAs with severe chronic diarrhea who had failed on four or more anti-diarrheal medications. The participants all had a history of CMV, MAI and KS, but no other bacterial or parasitic infection that could be found. They had all had very watery diarrhea (4-8 liters of it a day) for at least three months. The doctors treated them with very high dose SB (3 grams a day). Within two days, the volume of their diarrhea had been reduced to 1 liter. By the eighth day on SB, their stools were normally formed.</p>

<p><b>On-going Studies</b><br>
At present, there are two clinical trials of SB in the US. The first is a follow-up (four years in coming) to the French trial. The study plans to enroll 100 PWAs who have had chronic diarrhea for at least a month. They will receive either 3 grams of SB (six 250 mg capsules twice daily) or placebo for two weeks. After two weeks, people who were given placebo will be given free SB until the end of the study. People successfully treated with SB will be given decreasing doses, until the lowest effective maintenance dose is found. To date the only site is Seattle, although they may open other sites (perhaps even in New York).</p>

<p>The second study is in 120 non-HIV positive patients with recurrent C. diff diarrhea. Patients will receive standard therapy (vancomycin or metronidazole) plus SB (500 mg twice a day) vs. standard therapy without SB. The study has four sites: Kentucky, Michigan, Seattle and Columbia Presbyterian. For more information about either study call Kris Moyer, RN or Christina Surawicz, MD at (206) 322-5663.</p>

<p><b>Side Effects</b><br>
No side effects have been reported from the use of SB. Our greatest concern is that people shouldn't self-treat diarrhea without trying to find out what is causing it. Diarrhea is increasingly treatable and not getting at the cause could be disastrous (see <a href="#When you're having diarrhea">diarrhea article</a>).</p>

<p>Some physicians have raised the concern that, since this is a living organism, it may take root in an immune compromised person and cause systemic infections. A number of people with AIDS have been on the SB for a year or more in the US, and for several years in Europe, without any reported complications. There have only been two reported cases of systemic infections, neither in PWAs. In both cases, patients had perforated colons (e.g. after colon surgery) which allowed the yeast to flow outside their GI tracks. Both cases responded quickly to Amphotericin B. Normally, the yeast doesn't get absorbed in the body, moves right through the GI tract, to be excreted in the stool within 3 to 5 days.</p>

<p><b>Drug Interactions</b><br>
<b>Good News</b>: When you take SB with certain antibiotics, namely clindamycin and amoxicillin, the level of SB in your gut is substantially increased. These antibiotics kill off other organisms that probably help the body eliminate the yeast. Elevated levels of SB in the presence of these antibiotics is a good thing since these drugs often cause C. diff, which SB may keep in check.</p>

<p><b>Bad News</b>: Antifungals can kill SB, just like they kill candida and other fungal infections. Fortunately, fluconazole's effect on SB is minimal, and PWAs who want to try SB can continue to prophylax with a dose of 50-100 mg a day (this was allowed in the clinical trial). Even so, for optimal effect, don't take fluconazole and SB at the same time of the day.</p>

<p>There do not seem to be any drugs that SB interferes with, either by affecting absorption or directly interacting with them.</p>

<p><b>Dose</b><br>
The dose of SB differs depending upon the condition you are using it for. Use in non-PWAs ranges from 250 to 1000 mg a day. In PWAs with diarrhea of unknown cause, the starting dose is at least three times as much — 3000 mg a day. But you may not need to continue at this dose. In the ongoing study, if the SB works, after two weeks the participants will reduce their dose to 2000 mg a day. If this dose continues to keep their diarrhea in check, after another two weeks their dose will be lowered another 1000 mg. The dose de-escalation will continue until each patient finds their lowest effective maintenance dose.</p>

<p><b>Whose yeast is yeastiest?</b><br>
There are a couple of European companies that make pharmaceutical grade SB (that is, they grow it in sterile conditions and then put it in capsules.) In the US, Jarrow, a health food company, makes it. A French company, BioCodex, owns the license to study and eventually market SB as a drug in the US, even though it is a naturally occurring living organism. BioCodex is zealously guarding its right as sole manufacturer, and threatening lawsuits whenever they encounter a bootleg manufacturer, including Jarrow. Jarrow's product is somewhat less expensive, but comes with lower concentrations of live yeast:<p>

<p>The question is, how good is the Jarrow yeast? We don't know. Although they clearly have a financial reason to be biased, BioCodex claims they analyzed Jarrow's SB, and that:</p>

<ol>
<li> it suffers from poor quality control — it was somewhat contaminated by E. Coli and Staphylococcus; and 
<li>the SB viability was not preserved by the packaging and manufacturing process, so that there was a very decreased shelf-life, and 
<li>there were nowhere near as many organisms per capsule as Jarrow claimed (the poor little yeasts never had a chance). BioCodex's product, on the other hand, is subjected to a battery of quality control tests. And they have an FDA IND to prove it.
</ol>

<p>The Health Group currently carries Thiemann's brand — but it is expensive. At the current trial dose for PWA's 3000 mg/day, a four day supply costs $36. We are considering carrying the Jarrow brand as well, as it may be potent enough to work as a cheaper maintenance alternative to the European brands. In the meantime, Jarrow SB is available from Healing Alternatives (SFCA) and DAAIR (NYC). To take an equivalent dose of Jarrow SB as in the French clinical trial, you should take at least 24 pills a day (maybe more given questions about viability and shelf life) so each Jarrow bottle is a 4 day supply.</p>

<p><b><a name="IL-2 Blues">IL-2 Blues</a></b><br>
 by<i> Craig Sterritt</i></p>

<p>As many readers may be aware, <a href="../../network/simple/iltwo.html">interleukin-2</a> (IL-2) has received considerable attention over the past years in HIV/AIDS community publications, bulletin boards and treatment forums. Moreover, many people with HIV have been experimenting with IL-2, which can be procured from physicians, as IL-2 is approved for kidney cancer. While IL-2 may have the prospect of becoming a useful and even exciting immune-based intervention in HIV disease, experimentation with this unproven therapy may be premature and dangerous at this time.</p>

<p><b>Background</b><br>
IL-2 is a cytokine: a hormone-like protein, produced by immune cells, that plays an integral role in the regulation of immune responses against infectious agents and malignant cells. Without IL-2, T-cells are simply unable to multiply and carry out effective immune responses.</p>

<p>It is thought that a shortage of IL-2 in people with HIV contributes to the overall immune deterioration seen in HIV disease, by inhibiting the normal reproduction of T-cells and other lymphocytes, and causing the emergence of anergy (the inability of immune cells to respond to bacteria or viruses).</p>

<p>There is substantial evidence that the loss of CD4 cells in HIV disease is accompanied by a loss of natural IL-2 production. Some researchers think that replacing IL-2 may help reconstitute the immune system, either by boosting CD4 cells directly, or by enhancing the number and function of other important immune cells.</p>

<p>Studies of IL-2 in people with HIV, people with cancer and in people with a form of leprosy have indicated that IL-2 therapy can improve immune function and induce specific types of immune activity that may be useful in controlling these diseases. But IL-2 also dramatically increases HIV replication both in the test tube and in people. It also seems to increase the secretion of secondary cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), thought to contribute to HIV disease progression in numerous ways. So IL-2 therapy is a double-edged sword, with the ability to both aid and injure the immune systems and bodies of people with HIV.</p>

<p><b>IL-2: Recent NIH Study</b><br>
This has been further demonstrated by a recently completed NIH study using high dose intravenous IL-2: 18 million units each day — later reduced to 12 million units — for five days every 8 weeks.</p>

<p><b>&gt; 200 CD4 cells</b>: IL-2 significantly increased CD4 cells (greater than 50%) without causing sustained increases in viral load (the amount of HIV in the blood) in 6 out of 10 people who had more than 200 CD4 cells prior to IL-2 therapy. All were on stable AZT therapy. Although these results are encouraging, it has yet to be determined if the new CD4 cells are truly functional, if they will be an asset to the immune system, and whether they will delay disease progression and increase survival. Furthermore, although it didn't last, the initial rises in viral load were quite large, and no one knows what the long-term effect might be. Nor do we know what the effect of IL-2 is on viral load in the lymph nodes or other tissue, and how this might affect long term progression. But the study participants have been followed for 11-25 months without any increase in progression yet.</p>

<p><b>100-200 CD4 cells</b>: Less encouraging, people on stable antiretroviral therapy who had 100-200 CD4 cells were less likely to have significant CD4 rises (only 2 of 6 people did), and all had sustained increases in viral load.</p>

<p>Less than 100 CD4 cells: Finally, people on antiretroviral therapy with below 100 CD4 cells had no CD4 rises at all, and, again, all had substantial rises in viral load. These viral increases in persons with lower CD4 cells give cause for alarm, since it is generally believed that more virus equals faster disease progression.</p>

<p>The reasons for the differences in outcomes between the CD4 cell groups are not fully understood. It is possible that the CD4 cells of people with higher CD4 counts were more functional, and more likely to respond to the effects of IL-2 and subsequently control any IL-2-induced viral replication. It is also possible that the effects of antiretroviral therapy were stronger in the people with higher CD4 counts, while those with lower counts may have received less benefit from the antiretrovirals they were on, due to higher viral loads to begin with and greater viral resistance.</p>

<p>While this NIH study was of high-dose IV IL-2, earlier studies of subcutaneous (injected) lower- and low-dose (as low as 250 thousand units per day) IL-2 have similarly demonstrated no benefit for persons with AIDS and ARC, and have yielded only preliminary indications of efficacy in asymptomatic individuals. A new study of subcutaneous, low-dose IL-2 (one million a day, every day for the duration of the study) by the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) should be enrolling people with 300-700 T-cells in the next few months. Several other studies of different dosages, dosing schedules and administrations of IL-2 are either underway or planned at the NIH and in Europe. These studies will hopefully answer many of the questions that remain concerning IL-2 for the treatment of HIV.</p>

<p><b>Other Toxicity</b><br>
In addition to the possibility of creating more HIV within the body, IL-2 is a dangerously toxic therapy, which almost always causes fever and flu-like symptoms. It can cause life-threatening low blood pressure. Anyone with heart problems of any kind should absolutely not experiment with this therapy. Furthermore, the totality of clinical evidence suggests that people with HIV and low T-cells or symptomatic disease risk speeding up the course of their disease by taking IL-2. It remains a gamble for anybody in any T-cell range, and anyone experimenting with IL-2 should be sure to take an antiretroviral drug at the same time, preferably one that their virus hasn't become resistant to. It is probably also well advised for people suffering from HIV-related weight-loss not to experiment with IL-2, due to IL-2's ability to induce TNF production.</p>

<p>The final word is that, to date, there is absolutely no evidence that IL-2 can make people with HIV healthier, or help them to live longer. There is still a lot of cause for hope concerning this treatment, however; particularly for persons with earlier disease, as the recent NIH study has demonstrated dramatic T-cell rises in the majority of patients with higher initial CD4 counts. And with the advent of better antiretroviral drugs, it is possible that viral replication can be better controlled during IL-2 treatment, and thereby extend the usefulness of the therapy to people with lower T-cell counts, without risking increases in viral load.</p>

<p>[<b>Ed. note</b>: Anecdotal reports from PWAs who have used NAC for years and have tried IL-2 suggests far fewer side effects. If some of IL-2's side effects are caused by elevated TNF-alpha, its possible that taking TNF-alpha inhibitors like NAC, Trental, thalidomide, aspirin, or ketotifen may help.]</p>

<p><b><a name="diarrhea">Diarrhea of a Mad Housewife</a></b><p>

<p>Seemingly inevitable, and often of "unknown cause", diarrhea is important to aggressively investigate and get treatment for. Treating the symptoms can be an incredible relief, but not figuring out what's causing the diarrhea can do more harm than good. For example, taking Lomotil can make bacterial or c. diff infections harder to clear up, and can distort the results of a diarrhea workup. Further, what's causing your diarrhea can often be treated, and ignoring that possibility will allow it to get worse.</p>

<p>So how do you know whether to self-medicate, with Immodium or get your doctor to do a workup? It's not a simple call, because diarrhea can be caused by so many things, like stress and grief and allergies and bad food, but that's no reason not to be as aggressive as with any other symptom.</p>

<p>For starters, you know your body and its rhythms best. If it's out of whack for any period of time, get a workup. Persistent diarrhea or a persistent pattern of diarrhea should be checked out. Additional symptoms, like having a fever, or severe cramps along with diarrhea - definitely get a workup. One of the our board members, Dr. Gayann Hall, of Bronx Lebanon Hospital goes by a "rule of fives": if you have diarrhea for more than five days, more than five bowel movements a day, and have lost more than five pounds in a month — get a workup.</p>

<p>Docs are often reluctant to do workups, because diarrhea is so common and one of the basic tests, O&P, is notoriously inaccurate. However, lots of studies have shown that with repeated tests and different testing techniques (get thee to an gastro-enterologist!) the bug or infection causing diarrhea in PWAs can be found. Diarrhea is often blamed on HIV itself, but this can sometimes be an excuse not to not to investigate further.</p>

<p><b>Empiric treatment</b>: Some organisms are very difficult to track down, and can only be found with the most sophisticated laboratory equipment, or repeated testing. If your tests come back negative, your doctor may prescribe drugs to treat suspected cases, without confirmed diagnosis. If you respond, voila. In particular, doctors often treat microsporidiosis empirically.</p>

<p>When you have diarrhea, something is wrong with some part of your gastro-intestinal tract (everything from your stomach to your butt). You can see clues to what part of your system that is going haywire by the kind of diarrhea you have. Different infections prefer different locations in your GI track, and symptoms differ as a result. The 3 main areas are:</p>

<p><b>Small Bowel</b> (the tube running from your stomach to your colon): The small bowel is where most of the fluids are removed from what you have eaten; so small bowel infections cause extremely watery diarrhea. You may have severe cramps and immediately have to defecate. Often, you'll be nauseous as well, and lose your appetite. Since the small bowel is where your body takes most of the nutrients out of what you eat, infections here often cause malnutrition (see box below). Organisms that infect the small bowel include cryptosporidia, microsporidia,<i> isospora belli</i>, <i>giardia</i>, sometimes CMV and MAI, and possibly HIV.</p>

<p><b>Colon</b>: Once food reaches the colon, most of the water has been removed. Colon infections cause diarrhea with many small volume soft stools, sometimes with blood in it. There may be some mucus in your stools as well, and you will probably have cramps, but they probably won't be followed by an immediate need to use the toilet. Organisms that infect the colon are all the bacteria including C. diff, shigella, campylbac, and sal-monella, as well as amoebas, CMV and MAI (although MAI infections in the colon may not make you bleed), and once again, HIV itself.</p>

<p><b>Rectum</b>: Finally, some people who feel like they need to go the toilet all the time have proctitis. Proctitis is usually caused by sexually transmitted infections like herpes, gonorrhea or chlamydia which continually stimulate the nerve endings in your rectum. The stools are usually small, but they may be covered with mucus. You may also experience painful spontaneous discharges of pus in your underwear, as well as deep rectal pain.</p>

<p><b>When You See Your Doctor</b>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Odd as it may sound, tell her or him what your diarrhea is like — its easier to diagnose if you've kept track of what's happening: the number of times you go to the toilet, if it's watery, if or when you have cramps, any sign of blood, etc. The type of diarrhea you have points to what tests your doc should do, and keeps you from having to undergo unnecessary exams.

<li>Remember: not all docs are alike. Don't hesitate to go see an gut specialist (gastro-enterologist), especially if you are getting the run-around.</p>
</ol>

<p><b>Stool Sample Tests</b><br>
Your doctor will probably require stool samples. The older the sample, the harder it will be to find the infectious agent, so your sample should go straight to the lab. A variety of test should be performed on these samples.</p>

<ol>
<li><b>The ova and parasite test</b> (O&P) looks for amoebas, including giardia. Some labs can also detect cryptosporidia from this test, but your doctor may have to ask specifically. O&P testing is notoriously inaccurate, and laxatives (which may distort the shape of the micro-organisms) can make diagnosis even more difficult. Sometimes when doctors repeatedly run this test, they eventually do find the cause. 
<li><b> Stool cultures</b> look for bacteria.
<li><b> C. diff. toxin tests</b> can determine whether this naturally occurring bacteria has gotten out of hand. 
<li><b>MAI cultures</b>.
<li>Finally, a test called <b>the Wright Stain </b>can detect whether there are white or red blood cells in your sample — a good indication that you have a lower colon infection.
</ol>

<p><b>The Four Probing 'Scopies</b><br>
Unfortunately, stool samples can't find everything. For example, most infections in the small bowel are very hard to detect in stool samples, and CMV, microsporidia, <i>herpes</i>, <i>gonorrhea</i> and <i>chlamydia</i> are never found in the stool. Depending on your symptoms, a doctor will want to perform either a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, an anoscopy or an gastro-endoscopy.</p>

<p><b>Anoscopy</b>: If you have the symptoms of proctitis, your doctor may do a culture of the rectum — which will detect chlamydia or gonorrhea, and an anoscopy — which essentially means your doctor digs around in your anus with a cone shaped device.</p>

<p><b>Colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy</b>: If you have symptoms of colitis, your doctor may want you to have a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. Both procedures involves looking up at the colon with a device entering your body through the anus. Many doctor's use a flexible sigmoidoscope. A colonoscope is longer, and usually only used by surgeons or GI specialists since probing around so deep is a rather delicate operation. Either procedure involves looking at the bowel walls for ulcers or membranes, and taking samples of stool directly from the site, as well as biopsies of the colon wall (where CMV or MAI may be lurking).</p>

<p><b>Gastro-endoscopy</b>: If you have symptoms of small bowel disease, the doc will do an gastro-endoscopy, that is, she'll send a device through your mouth and esophagus into your small bowel, where she'll take samples and biopsies.</p>

<p><b><a name="When you're having diarrhea">When you're having diarrhea</a>,<br>

EAT — but EAT SMART</b>(especially if it is caused by small bowel diseases like crypto or micro) :</p>

<p><b>RESTORE YOUR FLUIDS </b>— Drink a LOT of liquids, juice, whatever (but not beer, milk, coke, black tea or coffee, or anything with caffeine). Diarrhea can dehydrate you fast, causing headaches and cramps on its own. Try popsicles and jello. Gatorade, and nutritional products like "EquaLYTE," or "Ricelyte" (found in the baby-food section of grocery stores) are good. Drink these liquids between — not just with meals.</p>	

<p><b>EAT</b>. It's easy (if you don't feel hungry) to skip meals, or eat too little.</p>

<ul>
<li>Eat frequent small meals with foods low in fat. Hold off on the oysters and stick with broiled fish, breads, pasta, really tasty mashed potatoes, rice, applesauce, mangos, papayas, bananas, and vegetables cooked well.	

<li>Avoid dairy products — they can make diarrhea worse.

<li>Avoid prunes, raw fruit and vegetables, which act like laxatives.

<li>Think white when it comes to bread and rice — less fiber. In fact, avoid high fiber foods like seeds, nuts or bran. Adversely, Metamucil might be good as a bulking agent.

<li>The main nutrients that you lose with diarrhea are:1) Potassium (so be careful about drugs that can deplete potassium, like glycyrrhizin; and 2) Sodium, so consider salty soups, saltines, etc...

<li>Boost your nutrients with extra vitamins or nutritional products like Advera.
</ul>

<p><b><a name="treating the symptoms of diarrhea">For treating the symptoms of diarrhea</a></b>:<br>
<b>Lomotil, Immodium, Paregoric, and Tincture of Opiate</b>: have dramatic effects on diarrhea but may make diagnosis harder. They might also delay ridding the body of bacterial infections that cause fevers and severe inflammation. They can be very useful once your doc knows what's causing your diarrhea. Docs may be reluctant to prescribe tincture of opiate as it is opium, but it can be very effective. It can also make you sleepy or buzzed in an unpleasant way.</p>

<font size=-1>

<p><a name="intro">This</a> is a special issue of NOTES FROM THE UNDERGROUND, covering each of the products that we're carrying today, a sort of blue plate special.</p>

<p>Since it's June '94, and time to recognize some of the more dramatic moments of lesbian and gay history, I'd like to suggest saluting the heroes of the AIDS drug underground, who for years with great imagination, courage, and sterling perseverance have brought you promising HIV/AIDS therapies through, shall we say, a variety of venues.</p>

<p>These heroes are all of you who recognized that the system just didn't give a damn and went out and did the work yourselves: learning medical practice and research language, tariff regulations and drug quality control standards, and how to sit on government committees, testify before Congress and not sweat through customs. Not only that, you learned how to talk to each other about what the government, medical and research communities, pharmaceutical and health food industries alike have never thought was your place: your own health and how to fight for your life.</p>

<p>In organizing buyers' clubs, setting up PWA hotlines and support groups, institutionalizing citizen input into the research process, and taking to the streets to demand change, you turned the American health care system upside down and built a community dedicated to people, to health and to survival, not profit. All Americans have benefitted by your resourceful questioning and years of hard work. Here's to our brave shared history, imagination, grace and outrageous good taste. Happy Lesbian & Gay Pride -- and bravo.</p>

<p><b><a name="open">The PWA Health Group: openly underground after all these years</a></b></p>

<p>The PWA Health Group is the nation's largest HIV/AIDS buyers' club, offering at cost promising HIV/AIDS treatments. We got started in the spring of 1987 by two PWAs, Michael Callen and Tom Hannan, and their doctor, Joe Sonnabend, in order to provide a safe treatment for AIDS, called egg lipids or AL721. The PWA Health Group has grown in spite of itself, eventually importing most of today's standard-of-care antibiotics, including fluconazole, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and itraconazole, months to years before FDA approval.</p>

<p>Tom and Michael set up shop in a local church, figuring that the police would be reluctant to arrest them there, and held a press conference. The press came, and the police didn't. For seven years now, the press has often come, and the police never. No one associated with the Health Group either as a patient, a patient advocate, or a doctor, has ever been arrested, sued or held liable in any way for accessing our drugs.<p>

<p>In fact, after an <a href="http://www.actupny.org/">ACT UP</a> demo in the spring of 1988, the FDA issued a regulation outlining the right of Americans to import medicines approved abroad for their own personal use. Although sometimes dismissed because the guidelines put in writing how the FDA had long operated, the political imagination of AIDS activists forced into the open FDA practice and opened up access to foreign drug research and development for all Americans.<p>

<p>Buyers' clubs operate under these personal use guidelines, importing modest amounts of promising therapies. Some provide a wide variety of products, a sort of one-stop shopping model. Healing Alternatives, started in 1986, is a sister buyers' club in California, that offers many things, including the cheapest vitamins in the country.</p>

<p>The PWA Health Group is a bit of an oddball: we try to focus on what is not readily available anywhere else. The Board, consisting mostly of PWAs and a handful of AIDS doctors, is admittedly conservative in deciding what genuinely has promise for the treatment of HIV and AIDS. They consider data, safety and cost. Safety can be a wide-ranging topic for the Board, as sometimes PWAs and doctors view it differently. But also, because we are starting to have some sense of what HIV is doing in your body, or HIV pathogenesis, proposed treatments get scrutinized for their possible effects on the course of HIV disease. For example, will a treatment lessen an excessive level of a chemical messenger in PWAs? Could it also speed up some other process of immune system malfunction? We're so cranky that sometimes we require prescriptions for things that no one else in the world does.</p>

<p>Are buyers' clubs legal? Not really. We're here only because of the political pressure you exert to keep us here. It's pretty amazing that we are. There aren't any cancer or Alzheimer's or lupus buyers' clubs to my knowledge, although I wish there were. We could get closed down any time, although given our careful record and lack of secrets, it doesn't seem likely. In fact, sometimes I argue that we're like a community- based FDA: we review treatments, giving them the nod or thumbs down; we test for quality; and we issue fact sheets, or labels, for each thing we distribute. We go one step further, of course, because we operate as a nonprofit, and our financial records are open.</p>

<p>Designed to jog the system and show it what it could and should be doing, seven years later the PWA Health Group is still here because of the appalling lack of imaginative AIDS drug development, and the political wisdom of PWAs still fighting to survive. And we're going to continue to show the system what it could be doing if this country really gave a damn, as long as we need to be, until surviving AIDS is everyone's reality.</p>

<p>We welcome suggestions, questions, comments, volunteers, writers, and your company, any time.</p>

<p><b><a name="drugs">Drug</a> Descriptions</b></p>

<p><a href="../info/albe.html">Albendazole</a><br>
Albendazole is used to treat microsporidiosis, an increasingly common infection that can affect any part of the body, but most often causes severe diarrhea. There are no approved treatments in the US. Albendazole has been studied in several open label trials, the results of which mirror clinical experience: a moderate percentage of PWAs respond well, but not everybody. It's available free from SmithKline Beecham with proof of diagnosis: 800/877- 7074 (physicians only), or from us with a prescription.</p>

<p>Approved in Europe and most Third World countries, albendazole is another relatively cheap drug held back because the parent drug company (SmithKline) doesn't feel that the market size is big enough to justify further expense. In light of the hundreds of PWAs buying this drug from us, this negligence is appalling. Large studies are needed now to better understand this infection, proper dosing regimens and to get the drug approved so that it's fairly available to all PWAs.</p>

<p>Furthermore, albendazole may have other uses, eg., test tube and limited clinical evidence suggest that it may be stronger than Flagyl for treating giardia. The Health Group provides SmithKline Beecham's albendazole, brand name Zental, in boxes of 6 x 200 mg tablets [<b>prescription required</b>].</p>

<p><b>Azithromycin</b><br>
Azithromycin is an approved macrolide antibiotic used for treating MAI/MAC, cryptosporidiosis, gonorrhea, urinary tract infections and chlamydia. Use for toxoplasmosis has not been so promising. The Health Group began importing it months before FDA approval and has continued to carry it solely because it's such a bargain abroad.</p>

<p>It's best to take azithromycin on an empty stomach and wait a couple of hours after antacids or drugs with antacids, such as ddI, as absorption is best in an acidic environment. The Health Group carries Pfizer brand name Zithromax from Germany in boxes of 6 x 250 mg [<b>prescription required</b>].</p>

<p><b><a href="../info/dhea.html">DHEA</a></b><br>
DHEA is a naturally occurring adrenal hormone in men and women that is often low in male PWAs. DHEA is not well understood, but is critical to testosterone and cortisol release and to the production of testosterone. A 1991 retrospective study found an increased risk for progression to AIDS in men with 200-499 T cells and low DHEA. Recent in vitro results suggest that DHEA may be a potent enhancer of IL-2 and may have direct anti-HIV effects in T cells and macrophages. An earlier small European study found no direct anti-viral effect as measured by p24). A recent SFCA study found DHEA to be well-tolerated, with no serious toxicities. No anti-viral effect was seen, although absorption complications may have played a key role: PWAs with better absorption had more of an increase in CD4 counts.</p>

<p>DHEA is a relatively popular drug. PWAs report feeling better, and having significantly more energy. Although larger controlled studies with PWAs have been run in Europe, the results have yet to be published (which is not exactly a hopeful sign - the company is mum). As a result, we don't know how useful DHEA replacement therapy is for HIV, or if it is, what dose would be best.</p>

<p>As it may increase facial hair or lower one's voice, DHEA has not been studied in women with HIV/AIDS. DHEA is low in women to begin with, but the lack of study is further disturbing, because depressed levels of DHEA have been associated with increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer.</p>

<p>A note of caution: DHEA has been studied and abundantly promoted for years now, particularly as an anti-aging drug. The Health Group requires a prescription because if DHEA up-regulates IL-2, it may indirectly stimulate HIV. The Health Group provides pharmaceutical grade DHEA, analyzed for potency and purity [<b>prescription required</b>].</p>

<p><b><a href="../info/hype.html">Hypericin/St. John's Wort</a></b><br>
Hypericin, derived from a medicinal herb called St. John's Wort, has shown anti-HIV and anti-CMV activity in the test tube. St. John's Wort has been safely used by PWAs for years. Activated by light, in sufficient doses hypericin can cause a photo-toxic reaction: sunburn, rash and severe itching. This toxicity delayed completion of an ACTG study of intravenous synthetic hypericin. Furthermore, levels of hypericin in the blood from the iv formula dropped too fast to see if it had an anti-viral effect in people.</p>

<p>A recent open-label trial using intravenous herbal hypericin reported that 14 of 16 PWAs had stable or increased T cells and no progression to AIDS during the 40 months of the trial. There are currently clinical trials enrolling using synthetic hypericin (now in an oral form) for genital warts (HPV) and HIV.</p>

<p>Buyers clubs' and health food stores sell herbal formulas (pills) containing mild amounts of hypericin and pseudo-hypericin. Without clinical studies, we have no way of knowing the right dose to have an anti-viral effect or how useful it really is. We have been unable to confirm the consistency and quantity of hypericin in these products, even the more expensive ones. Nevertheless, many PWAs feel that hypericin helps stabilize their immune system, boosts their energy, and may keep their CMV in check. The Health Group currently provides two herbal formulas: Pacific Biologics' HY10 (15 x 10 mg pills) and Yerba Prima's St. John's Wort (180 tablets).</p>

<p><b>Isoprinosine</b><br>
Isoprinosine, known for its anti-allergic properties, has been studied since the mid-80's for its immuno-stimulating qualities. A raft of somewhat promising and somewhat discouraging test tube and clinical studies leave us with no clear answers: does it increase natural killer cells, gamma interferon, <a href="../../network/simple/iltwo.html">IL-2</a>, and a variety of cellular functions? In the test tube, yes, in some small studies of PWAs, yes and no. Two large clinical trials showed little anti-HIV effect or any increase in T cells, but another large study (n=866) showed a significant decrease in progression to AIDS.</p>

<p>Since then, isoprinosine has been associated with a decreased risk for PCP, possibly because one of its ingredients interferes with the same pathway by which sulfa-based drugs work against PCP (as per in vitro work by the NCI). Also studied for herpes in comparison trials with acyclovir, acyclovir has been consistently superior, although in one study, a combo of both worked better than either. Isoprinosine has shown efficacy treating children (not HIV-positive) with molluscum. Well-tolerated, isoprinosine has been used by some PWAs for years now, who feel it's critical to stabilizing their immune system. The Health Group provides isoprinosine from Mexico, produced by Roussel in boxes of 20 x 500 mg pills.</p>

<p><b>Itraconazole</b><br>
Itraconazole is an approved triazole antifungal, used for thrush, histoplasmosis, aspergillosis, cryptococcal meningitis, fingernail and hair infections, leishmaniasis, etc. Carried by the Health Group prior to FDA approval, it's another medication that we carry simply because it's so much cheaper abroad.</p>

<p>In comparison with ketaconazole, itraconazole appears to be better tolerated, with less liver toxicity and no adrenal suppression, and somewhat greater activity against aspergillus. Fluconazole remains the first line treatment choice for most fungal infections as it stays active longer in the body and is readily absorbed into cerebral spinal fluid. A note of interest: itraconazole has recently shown anti-microsporidiosis activity in vitro.</p>

<p>If you're taking antacids, or drugs with antacids, such as ddI, you should wait a couple of hours before taking itraconazole, since it needs an acidic environment to get absorbed into your body. Also, taking it with fatty foods will increase absorption.</p>

<p><b><a href="../info/keto.html">Ketotifen</a></b><br>
Ketotifen is a non-toxic anti-allergy drug used all over the world to treat asthma. Although its use in asthma is somewhat dubious, ketotifen's primary side effects of weight gain and increased appetite may be promising for PWAs. Two small pilot studies reported last year indicated that ketotifen lowers TNF-alpha, increases body cell mass and increases weight in PWAs. Ketotifen also protects cells in the lining of the stomach and the colon, and is being studied as a treatment for colitis/inflammatory gut disease, which has a lot in common with HIV-related colitis.</p>

<p>There have yet to be any controlled trials with PWAs, so we do not know how efficacious it is, or what's the best dose to take. It has been safely studied in children as well as adults, and a number of case studies suggest that ketotifen may be helpful in treating acne and swelling (edema) around sores. The Health Group imports Sandoz Pharmaceuticals ketotifen, brand name Zaditen, from France, in boxes of 60 x 1 mg pills.</p>

<p><b>Levamisole</b><br>
Levamisole, originally developed to de-worm livestock, showed immune modulating activity in mice almost thirty years ago. Since that time, it has been used in a wide variety of diseases, but not always with positive results. It has not shown any benefit as a treatment for AIDS. A Dutch open label study in 34 patients with AIDS reported that levamisole treatment produced no effects whatsoever.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, levamisole may help treat certain conditions such as apthous ulcers and genital warts. Levamisole has serious side effects. In people without HIV, levamisole has been shown to cause flu-like symptoms, skin rashes, mouth ulcers, fevers, very low white blood cell counts that could be fatal, insomnia, headache, nausea, etc. The Dutch study notes that 38% of the PWAs experienced side effects. The Health Group imports Decaris brand levamisole in boxes of 2 x 50 mg tablets [<b>prescription required</b>].</p>

<p><b><a href="../info/mema.html">Memantine</a></b><br>
In Germany, memantine is used to treat Parkinson's, dementia in the elderly and to speed the recovery of comatose patients. We've recently made it available as a possible treatment for HIV encephalopathy, based on the clinical experience of a handful of neurologists who have been using it with PWAs and extensive test tube data. The animal and in vitro data suggest that memantine may help PWAs with HIV-related neurological problems, such as memory loss, confusion, and trouble with speaking, walking, or concentrating. Does it? We don't know, as there haven't been any controlled clinical trials with PWAs.</p>

<p>Merz, who owns this drug, is not interested in developing it. A promising sister drug, nimodipine, which may work well in concert with memantine, did get into ACTG neuro trials. It costs about $1000/month in the US. Since nimodipine may cost as little as a 1/5 of that abroad, maybe we'll pick it up if the trial results are good.</p>

<p>We require a prescription, as there are potentially serious toxicities and drug interactions to be careful about, and the data in PWAs is limited. Some doctors use memantine prophylactically, but questions about efficacy, absorption, optimal dose and dosing regimens remain open. The Health Group imports Merz memantine, brand name Akatinol, in boxes of 50 x 10 mg tablets [<b>prescription required</b>].</p>

<p><b><a href="../info/nac.html">NAC</a></b><br>
NAC (N-acetylcysteine) is an amino acid used for years by PWAs to pump up intracellular glutathione (GSH), a cell chemical involved in most metabolic processes and often low in PWAs. Cells die without GSH. NAC is one of a variety of nutrients often used by PWAs as anti-oxidants to help the immune system. NAC may also lower TNF-alpha, a chemical often elevated in PWAs, that stimulates HIV and may be related to weight loss. Finally, NAC may help alleviate sulfa-based antibiotic allergies (eg., Bactrim/Septra).</p>

<p>Although NAC is blessed with more theory for its use than most anti-retrovirals, we still don't know what dose to take, whether it's properly absorbed in PWAs, and if it has any anti-viral effect. Maybe the lack of systematic study is because it can't be patented, so no big bucks for some corporate bank account. There's an increasing number of studies of its patented cousin, procysteine, but maybe that's coincidence. On-going NAC studies: a Canadian trial looking at its effect on Bactrim/Septra allergies, and German and Californian studies on absorption.</p>

<p>NAC is one of our most popular products, has very few side effects and is usually taken at doses used in clinical trials: @600-2400 mg/day. The Health Group carries two pharmaceutical brands of NAC, effervescent made by Elan in Switzerland, 10 x 800 mg, and capsules from Zambon in Italy, 30 x 200 mg.</p>

<p><b><a href="../info/ampho.html">Oral Amphotericin B</a></b><br>
Oral amphotericin B has been approved for decades in Europe as treatment and prophylaxis for a number of oral and GI fungal infections, including thrush. This form of amphotericin B comes in a much smaller dosage than the intravenous kind, eg., the usual dose for oral thrush is 400 mg/day. No side effects have been noted with this drug with doses under 3000 mg/day. An American study for fluconazole resistant thrush is planned for later this year.</p>

<p>This low-dose oral form of amphotericin B does not get absorbed by the body, and can't be used to treat infections outside of the GI tract. Although ketoconazole and fluconazole are commonly available for thrush, we carry oral ampho B as an alternative for resistant strains of thrush. The Health Group carries liquid (12 ml x 100 mg) and lozenges (56 x 100 mg), made in England by Squibb [<b>prescription required</b>].</p>

<p><b>Pentamidine</b><br>
Approved for PCP prophylaxis, pentamidine is carried by the Health Group because it is so much cheaper abroad. Available since the mid-70's, the American price of pentamidine took off with its approval for PCP prophylaxis. As a result, the Health Group began to import it from Yugoslavia at a significantly cheaper rate, in order to embarrass the company into lowering its price.</p>

<p>Pentamidine is also somewhat famous as the first antibiotic approved for AIDS. Fought for by activist PWAs whose doctors had been using for it years based on data from transplant patients, pentamidine was approved in 1989. Note: off-label use of antibiotics remains the cornerstone of good patient care in AIDS: Bactrim was finally approved for PCP prophylaxis this past winter.</p>

<p>The Health Group imports Rhone Poulenc's pentamidine 1 x 300 mg [<b>prescription required</b>].</p>

<p><b><a href="../info/pept.html">Peptide T</a></b><br>
Peptide T, a nasal spray used for peripheral neuropathy and early stages of dementia, is by far the most popular treatment we offer. A chain of 8 amino acids, peptide T was developed to mimic HIV's outer gp120 protein and interfere with HIV replication. It has never been shown to have any anti-viral effect. A 1992-93 phase II study of severe peripheral neuropathy showed no difference between those on placebo and those on peptide T: about 30% of both felt better. There have also been a couple of small promising studies for psoriasis.</p>

<p>Currently the two tiny drug companies sharing the license are sitting tight, waiting for Sept '95 results of a neuro-cognitive trial, typical of the tedious pace of development that has accompanied this drug for years. Dogged by limited research, corporate greed, ambitious researchers and conservative patent holders (the National Institutes of Mental Health, part of the NIH), peptide T could be a case study in how not to develop a drug. There are no clinical trials currently open for peptide T, although the ACTG Neurology Committee is presently seeking sites for an HIV-related dementia trial.</p>

<p>The anecdotal experience of hundreds of PWAs shows it to be a safe, well-tolerated drug. Some PWAs with neuropathy respond dramatically and others do not respond at all. Similarly, for some PWAs experiencing memory loss, confusion and orientation problems, the improvement is striking. And, as in both clinical trials, PWAs report an increase in energy, appetite, weight stabilization and overall sense of well-being. Peptide T is quite expensive and is produced under sterile conditions for the PWA Health Group.</p>

<p><b><a href="../info/riba.html">Ribavirin</a></b><br>
An underground HIV/AIDS drug for many years now, ribavirin got it's initial boost from the extravagant anti-viral claims of its manufacturer, ICN Pharmaceuticals. Large clinical trials in PWAs have showed no benefit over placebo, and one combination trial with isoprinosine actually showed a decrease in all kinds of white blood cells, including CD4s. One study showed it negates the activity of <a href="../../network/simple/zido.html">AZT</a>, but another indicated that it enhanced the activity of ddI. An on-going follow-up study with ddI has suffered from poor enrollment.</p>

<p>Since then, an NIH study of ribavirin as a treatment for hepatitis C has put it back on the map. Hepatitis C can be a particularly virulent form of hepatitis, and is far more common among all population groups than previously suspected (for years it was classified as a disease shared mostly by injection drug users, and thus languished with little study or research dollars). In one small Serbian study, ribavirin was also useful against hepatitis A.</p>

<p>ICN is a small company, but further research on ribavirin has been stalled by more than just the usual lack of resources: the president of ICN, Milan Panic, took a nine month leave of absence to become prime minister of Yugoslavia, and since then the company has been sued by a corporate raider shareholder who's also part of the BCI scandal. Many PWAs have taken ribavirin for years, and much like isoprinosine, feel that it has been integral to maintaining a stable immune system. The Health Group imports ribavirin in boxes of 12 x 400 mg tablets.</p>

<p><b><a href="../info/sskt.html">SSKT</a></b><br>
An ancient Asian herbal preparation of seven different plants, Sho-saiko-to in Japanese, or Xiao Chai Hu Tang in Chinese, SSKT is the number one herbal product in Japan. It has shown anti-HIV (anti-reverse transcriptase) and immuno-modulating activity in the test tube, including reducing prostaglandin E2 (possibly involved in cell apoptosis), IL-6 and TNF-alpha; upping IL-1; enhancing the killing ability of macrophages (phagocytosis); and increasing polyclonal antibodies. Used in Japan and China for chronic kidney, liver and gastro-intestinal problems, it is currently being studied in Japan for hepatitis and is in phase II trials as an anti-epileptic. Plans to run clinical trials for HIV in the US have languished.</p>

<p>There have been no clinical trials with PWAs, so we do not know how useful it is, what dose to take, or even whether PWAs can absorb enough orally to have any of the effects seen in the test tube. Many PWAs have taken it for years and it seems to be very safe. We sell the Sun Ten brand, in bottles of 120 tablets.</p>

<p><b>Sulfadiazine</b><br>
A first-line cheap treatment choice for toxoplasmosis, sulfadiazine has been out of stock in America since December 1993. It's available for free from the CDC: 404/488-4928 (physicians only) or from us. The FDA has no idea when it will be back in drug stores, but two generic drug companies have applied for INDs.</p>

<p>Toxo treatment consists of two phases: a high-dose acute phase, and a lower dose lifetime maintenance phase. Sulfadiazine is usually given with pyrimethamine and leucovorin (to protect against pyrimethamine bone marrow toxicities). As a sulfa antibiotic, it often causes allergic reactions (rash, fever, leukopenia) but many PWAs have successfully de-sensitized themselves. We have copies of a de-sensitization protocol. It's worth considering, as the usual alternative, clindamycin with pyrimethamine, is very expensive and can cause severe c. difficile diarrhea. We currently import sulfadiazine from Germany made by Heyl in bottles of 80 x 500 mg pills [<b>prescription required</b>].</p>

<p><b>Tinidazole</b><br>
Tinidazole is a widely-approved, safer alternative to Flagyl, used to treat whatever Flagyl is commonly used for, including giardia, amoebas, vaginitis, PID, trichomonas, etc. Approved in most European countries and Australia, several studies have shown comparable efficacy to Flagyl, plus superior absorption and twice the half life in the body.</p>

<p>Considerably gentler than Flagyl, tinidazole is usually taken as a single dose for giardia or trichomonas, and for only 3-5 days for amoebas.</p>

<p><b>Issues</b>: there have been no studies using tinidazole in PWAs, so we don't know whether a longer dose is indicated. Clinical experience from PWAs and their doctors has been quite favorable. Also, there is some preliminary evidence of its use against microsporidiosis. Why is this drug not available in the US? Pfizer has decided the market isn't big enough to justify the studies the FDA would require. The Health Group imports Pfizer's tinidazole, brand name Fasigyn, from Mexico, in boxes of 8 x 500 mg pills [<b>prescription required</b>].</p>

<p><b>Coming in July:</b></p>

<p><b><a href="../info/sacc.html">Saccharomyces boulardii</a> (SAC)</b><br>
SAC (as we're calling it) is a yeast sold over the counter in Europe to treat diarrhea and particularly C. difficile-related diarrhea (an infection that can occur after anti-biotics kill all the gut's natural flora and fauna). We're importing it because of anecdotal reports and one small study that reported very good results for hard to treat diarrhea in PWAs.</p>

<p>Although SAC is non-toxic, there is a potential danger that, as a yeast, it could get out of control in PWAs, and start systemic infections the way candida does. Anti-fungal drugs can eradicate it. There are also cheaper health food store brands. We plan to import the pharmaceutical grade SAC because we are unsure of the health food store product quality control.<p>

<p><b>Under development</b></p>

<p><b>Curcumin</b>: A derivative of the spice turmeric that inhibits HIV in the test tube by blocking the long terminal repeat (LTR) portion of HIV's DNA and making the virus latent. Recently, Search Alliance ran a open label study of curcumin in PWAs.</p>

<p><b>Dirithromycin</b>: Apparently this new macrolide (approved in Spain) has shown some activity against cryptosporidium in animal models at high doses. But maybe too high for human use.</p>

<p><b>Fumigillin</b>: Has shown activity against microsporidiosis in vitro and in two case studies.</p>

<p><b>Glycyrrhizin</b>: This licorice extract is approved in Japan for liver diseases. It has also shown some anti-HIV activity. We plan to import it shortly from Japan.</p>

<p><b>Irinotecan (CPT-11)</b>: This cancer drug inhibits HIV in the test tube the same way curcumin does, but it is much more potent. This drug has serious side effects but would be used at much lower doses in PWAs.</p>

<p><b>LEM</b>: A lentinus extract that has shown anti-HIV activity.</p>

<p><b>Nimodipine</b>: Nimodipine is approved in the US to improve the neurologic condition of patients after sub-arachnoid hemorrhages. We're interested in it for HIV encephalopathy. So is the ACTG -- they recently finished a study.

<p>The question is, does the drug have a positive effect? We hope to hear some study results soon.

<p><b>Oxandrin</b>: Oxandrin is an oral anabolic steroid being studied for growth disorders in children, HIV wasting, and as a treatment for alcoholic hepatitis. It is much less liver toxic than other oral anabolics. We're waiting for results from phase II studies.</p>

<p><b>Tat Gene Inhibitor</b>: The tat gene inhibitor, which in an ACTG study appeared to be worthless, seemed to work quite well in vitro when used with Trental. Because of this, it is enjoying a resurgence on the underground. A benzodiazepine, it is made on the underground (hopefully not in a bathtub), but we don't know its quality.</p>

<p><b><a href="../info/thal.html">Thalidomide</a></b>: Currently in ACTG trials for apthous ulcers, weight loss and as an anti-HIV drug. There is an FDA sponsored treatment IND for PWAs with apthous ulcers (301) 443-9553. Data showing substantial weight gains in PWAs is expected this summer.</p>

<p><b><a href="../info/thym.html">Thymosin Alpha-1</a></b>: We would like to provide this injectable drug from Italy for people with chronic hepatitis B. One trial showed promise in combination with AZT and alpha interferon as an immune-modulator. But we've had problems getting a hold of it.</p>

<p><b>Una de gato</b>: A Peruvian healing herb that is being used by PWAs in South America. Some researchers are studying it.</p>

<p><b><a name=" New Products">Our</a> Spring Line -- New Products at the PWA Health Group</b></p>

<p>In the confusion of treatment misinformation and buzz, many of you may wonder how the PWA Health Group decides what to carry. Well, we have a process that often starts with your phone calls asking about or for new drugs. Then the staff scurries around gathering all the information (abstracts, articles from medical journals, discussions with researchers) we can find (and any help you can provide is greatly appreciated.) When we've accumulated enough info, we go to Board of Director's New Products Committee, which considers the theory behind why the drug might work, the data on safety, and the cost. We always look to see whether the drug has been used in people, and most importantly, in PWAs. Of course, even if the Board approves a drug, it doesn't always mean that we can get the product in right away, but we try our best.</p>

<p>On March 29, the New Products Committee met and decided that we should carry two new drugs, <a href="../info/mema.html">memantine</a> and <a href="../info/keto.html">ketotifen</a>. But they didn't approve everything. Another drug called vesnarinone, which is currently being studied in PWAs because it may lower TNF-alpha, was considered and rejected. Why? Because there is no safety data in PWAs yet, and when this drug was given to patients with heart disease it caused serious bouts of neutropenia. But we will look at this drug again when there is more data on its use in PWAs.</p>

<p><b><a name="Memantine">Memantine</a>—(Akatinol)</b><br>
<i>Theo Smart</i></p>

<p><a href="../info/mema.html">Memantine</a> (Akatinol) is now available with a doctor's prescription for patients with HIV-related neurological problems. Memantine is a cousin of an old anti-flu drug, amantadine. It is used in Germany to treat Parkinson's disease, dementia in the elderly, and to speed the recovery of comatose patients. Because of possible similarities between Parkinson's disease and HIV encephalopathy (which can mean anything including memory loss, confusion, difficulty speaking, walking, and/or concentrating) it might be helpful for PWAs. But while some PWAs have been using memantine, and the AIDS Clinical Trial Group is currently planning to study it, at present there is no data from any study using memantine in PWAs. Nevertheless, since there is no approved proven treatment for HIV-related neurologic problems, the PWA Health Group believes this drug should be made available.</p>

<p><b>Brain Science for Beginners</b><br>
While the root cause of neurologic problems in PWAs is different from what causes Parkinson's or dementia in the elderly, people with these problems all lose brain or nerve cells called neurons in much the same way. PWAs with encephalopathy can lose up to 20-50% of their neurons.</p>

<p>How does this happen? We don't know. In Parkinson's disease, the theory is that too much of certain amino acids in the brain signal neurons to self-destruct. Memantine keeps to a minimum these destructive signals.</p>

<p>These amino acids may be elevated in some PWAs too. What's worse, test tube and animal studies show that the HIV protein gp120 can also send neurons self-destruct signals. But until we know to what extent HIV neurological problems are caused by these signals, we can't predict how helpful memantine will be in PWAs. However, even if the theory is wrong, memantine does half a dozen other things to brain cells and tissue which may protect them from a number of toxins.</p>

<p><b>Memantine Use</b><br>
Patients with Parkinson's and other conditions have been given doses that range from 5-60 mg a day, depending on the condition that it is being used for. We don't know the best dose for PWAs. Since there isn't much information on the use of memantine in PWAs, it may make sense to start at a low dose, such as 5 mg a day. (Our supply, from Merz Pharmaceuticals in Germany, comes in boxes of 50 x 10 mg tablets, that can be split in half).</p>

<p><b>Precautions</b><br>
One neurologist that we've spoken to has monitored some PWAs using memantine and reports no serious side effects. She starts patients at a low dose, watches for adverse reactions and then gradually increases the dose. A number of PWAs have safely used related drugs, such as amantadine and Flumadine, which may bode well for the use of memantine.</p>

<p>Memantine is fairly well tolerated in the elderly. One study noted a few cases of restlessness, insomnia and nervous energy (such as pacing, fidgeting). An open label study in fourteen patients with Parkinson's using 30 mg/day reported that four (28%) of these patients quit memantine because of nervous energy, emotional agitation, confusion, dizziness and stomach upset.</p>

<p>Since there have been no clinical trials using memantine in PWAs, be very careful if you decide to take it. The potential for adverse or unexpected side effects for this kind of drug might be much greater in PWAs.</p>

<p>Be extra careful if you are on any antidepressants such as Prozac or Zoloft since memantine may effect the way they work. You might be extra prone to hyperactivity or "manic" states if you take these drugs together.</p>

<p>There could be a dangerous interactions between memantine and MAO inhibitors (including Nardil and number of other rarely used drugs which, by the way, can cause life-threatening side effects when used together with lots of stuff such as cheese, for instance). If you are taking any of these start at a low dose of memantine (or consider switching to another anti-depressant in place of the MAO inhibitor).</p>

<p><b>Trials</b><br>
Ultimately, only clinical trials can show whether the theory behind memantine is valid. The ACTG is planning a study, and we'll let you know the details on it, as soon as they become available. However, the ACTG has never been known to get trials up quickly, and the goals of it's Neurology committee have never been prioritized. Perhaps this is partly the community's fault, because demanding drugs for neurocognitive problems may not be as sexy as screaming for anti-virals. Maybe there is a perception that neurological problems are more difficult to treat. Maybe some of us are embarrassed by them. Regardless, HIV encephalopathy has a physical cause, and like any other ailment, there must be a way to treat it. The suffering it causes is simply too great to ignore, and it won't just go away.</p>

<p><b><a name="Ketotifen For Weight Gain">Ketotifen</a> For Weight Gain</b><p>

<p><a href="../info/keto.html">Ketotifen</a> is a virtually non-toxic anti-histamine (like Seldane or Benadryl), used extensively in Europe to treat bronchial asthma and allergies. It is also being studied as a treatment for colitis. The PWA Health Group plans to import ketotifen because of preliminary reports that it lowers elevated levels of TNF-alpha, and can increase weight in PWAs.</p>

<p>German researchers have shown that ketotifen lowers TNF-alpha in the test tube. TNF-alpha is a naturally occurring protein that is often highly elevated in people with HIV and may be a primary part of HIV disease. It can turn on latent HIV, increase the production of new virus; and cause generalized inflammation and AIDS-related weight loss.</p>

<p>But in addition to reducing TNF-alpha, ketotifen may help people gain weight in other ways. When used for asthma, weight gain and an increased appetite were among the most frequent side effects. Ketotifen also protects the cells in the stomach, small intestine and gut from a number of toxins. It is being studied as a way to treat inflammatory bowel disease/colitis which may have a lot in common with HIV related gut problems.</p>

<p>A number of case studies suggest that ketotifen may be helpful in treating skin problems like acne. Ketotifen reduces the edema (swelling and puffiness caused by water retention) around sores.<p>

<p>Rather than focusing on ketotifen's TNF reduction as a means of slowing down HIV, the pragmatic Germans wondered what the drug might do for wasting. They published data from two small pilot studies in PWAs at last year's AIDS conference. One study in 24 patients (who had been losing weight) used ketotifen in combination with oxymethadone, a weight-gain steroid like Megace, so it is hard to tell if ketotifen had an effect. The study notes a 14% reduction in TNF-alpha levels and weight gains of 11-12 pounds in less than four weeks (in 18 out of 22 patients). Two patients dropped out, three did not gain weight, and one continued to lose weight despite treatment. Most patients felt stronger and their appetites improved. The drugs were well tolerated, although two patients reported fatigue. A larger placebo controlled study of this combination is underway.</p>

<p>The other study used ketotifen (starting with 1 mg a day, raised to 4 mg a day on the sixth day) by itself in eight patients with elevated TNF-alpha, but no wasting. There was no control. After 12 weeks, these patients gained an average of six pounds, had increases in their body cell mass (which means they didn't just gain fat but muscle mass as well) and reductions in their TNF-alpha levels.</p>

<p>Ketotifen is virtually non-toxic (although it is not advised for patients with epilepsy). Its primary side effects seem to be temporary drowsiness, appetite stimulation and weight gain.</p>

<p><b>Ketotifen For Kids</b><br>
Ketotifen is one of the rare drugs that has been extensively used and shown to be safe in children (above six months old). One study was in 107 children between six months and three years old with asthma. Children under 1 year were given .5 mg twice daily, the older children got 1 mg twice daily. Not only did the kid's asthma improve, they gained weight too.</p>

<p>Ketotifen is one of what we hope will become a growing arsenal of products we'll carry to fight weight loss in PWAs.</p>

<p><b><a name="Getting Reimbursed For Health Group Products">Getting Reimbursed </a>For Health Group Products</b></p>

<p>Can you get reimbursed by you insurance company for the drugs you buy at the PWA Health Group? Some of our clients do, and one member on our board, Dr. Jim Braun, says that he never has any trouble with it, although it does take a little extra work. He's even gotten insurance companies to pay for <a href="../info/sskt.html">SSKT!</a><p>

<p>Dr. Braun says that he simply writes a letter to his patient's insurance company explaining: 1) that he has prescribed the drug for the patient; 2) why this particular drug is being used; and 3) he includes a couple of articles from medical journals about the drug. That's it.</p>

<p>This may not work for everyone. Many of you may not have a doctor willing to go to this much trouble. But if you want to give it a try, we can send you the medical articles. Just give us a call.	</p>	

<p><b><a name="Synthetic Hypericin Study">Synthetic Hypericin Study</a></b></p>

<p>A dose ranging study of an oral liquid formulation of synthetic hypericin has recently started at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, and NYU/ Bellevue in NYC. <a href="../info/hype.html">Hypericin</a> is the active ingredient in St. John's Wort; and has test tube activity against a number of viruses including, HPV (genital warts), CMV and HIV. This study is designed to see how safe this formula is and how much you have to have an antiviral effect in your blood.</p>

<p>Earlier studies of synthetic hypericin used an IV formulation. Many patients complained of painful tingling or burning sensations when they were exposed to light. This may have happened because the IV formulation delivered doses that were too high at first (and then didn't last long enough). An oral drug won't get as much of the drug immediately into the blood so the researchers hope it won't cause the skin reaction. Nevertheless, the drug requires exposure to light to work, and to an extent some tingling or pain may be a sign that the drug is active. The researcher's on the study say that the pain can be controlled by taking Advil, and that this toxicity is rather minor when compared to the peripheral neuropathies, and liver toxicity that some anti-HIV drugs cause.</p>

<p>To enroll in the study (which will last anywhere from 8 to 24 weeks) you need to have CD4 cell counts below 350 and be p24 positive. You can't take any other anti-retroviral drugs (like AZT, ddI, etc...) while on study, but most drugs used for prophylaxis like Bactrim are allowed. To enroll or get more information in New York call Janet Vaccarello at (212) 263-8724, or in Boston call Sheila Hussey at (617) 735-4103. </p>			

<p><b><a name="HIV Curry">HIV Curry</a> -- Curcumin Shows Antiviral Activity in PWAs</b></p>

<p>The Search Alliance study of curcumin (derived from the spices turmeric and cumin and sold as capsules in some health food stores) has finished and the researchers report preliminary evidence of anti-viral activity. This is the first sign that a new class of drugs called LTR inhibitors, (which treat a different part of the viral life cycle than the nucleoside analogues or protease inhibitors) can reduce HIV viral load in PWAs.</p>

<p>This was an open label study using 2.6 grams a day of Nature's Herb's curcumin, (three pills taken three times a day). Nineteen patients with CD4 counts between 0-400 enrolled. Eleven finished the study. Two dropped out due to gastrointestinal complaints (probably attributable to curcumin). Four patients developed OI's while on study, three of whom dropped out. Other's dropped out either for personal reasons, and/or because the study was extended to 20 weeks.</p>

<p>The researchers looked for CD4 cell responses and antiviral activity as measured by p24 and RNA/PCR. There was no significant change in either CD4 or p24. However, between weeks 4-12 patients experienced a major reduction in viral load as measured by RNA/PCR. The antiviral effect didn't seem to be as great at the end of the study, but the data was thrown off by one patient.</p>

<p>This study shows that this class of drug merits more study. Other than that, it is difficult to come to any conclusions on the basis of these results. Since this was a "pilot" study meant to generate interest in the compound, it wasn't designed to answer questions about how to use it. And there are plenty of questions. For one thing, no one knows the right dose. Curcumin is not very well absorbed; and despite the study's encouraging results, we don't know whether patients were even getting optimal levels of compound -- Search Alliance couldn't measure how much curcumin got into the blood (they couldn't find a test for it). The study wasn't designed to look for any clinical benefit. The drop out rate was sort of disturbing. It is also strange that p24 levels didn't change when the viral load did. Finally, given that there are animal/in vitro studies that suggest that curcumin boosts levels of interleukin-4 (which some researchers think may be bad for PWAs), we don't know what effect curcumin might have on PWAs over the long run.</p>

<p>Search Alliance does not plan any further studies of curcumin. Instead they plan to study a more potent LTR inhibitor called beta lapochone. This compound is about one hundred years old, non-patentable and no one makes it anymore, but the Dana Farber Institute has the use patent. Search is going to try to have it made for them.</p>

<p>In the meantime, CRI New England will start the next study of curcumin in PWAs by the end of May. They filed an IND with the FDA, which means that the FDA checked out the quality of Nature's Herb's curcumin before giving them the go-ahead. If you live in the Boston area and are interested in this study, you can get more info by calling (617) 566-4004. </p>

<p><b><a name="What Happened to the Ozone?">What Happened to the Ozone?</a></b><br>
by <i>Joe Best</i></p>

<p>[Ed. note: We realize that this is a very long article, but given the continued interest in ozone, it seems important to cover the topic thoroughly.]</p>

<p>Ozone has been touted as a miracle treatment for a number of conditions including HIV for years. Some of these claims are legitimate. For example, ozone's antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties have lead to its use for sterilization in certain industries. Clinical research on ozone has shown benefits in the treatment of certain conditions such as arterial sclerosis# and cataracts. However, evidence in support of ozone as an HIV treatment is anecdotal in nature or based on test tube activity. The limited clinical data available indicates that ozone has no discernable effect on HIV.</p>

<p>This has not dampened the fervor of ozone advocates, who are quick to create figures and concoct conspiratorial theories to explain why ozone has been largely rejected by the medical establishment. They whisper of government seizure of medical records and equipment (which has indeed happened). Such goings-on stir up an atmosphere of intrigue and enable ozone advocates to prolong the debate on and market for ozone, perhaps to the detriment of people living with HIV and AIDS.</p>

<p><b>What is ozone?</b><br>
In nature, ozone acts as the protective layer of the atmosphere which shields us from the harmful ultraviolet rays of the Sun. Oxygen, as an element, exists in several forms, the most stable being the oxygen gas we breathe, composed of two atoms of oxygen (O2). Ozone (O3) simply has an additional atom of oxygen. This additional atom fundamentally changes the nature of the gas. To manufacture medical ozone, pure oxygen gas (O2) is altered by means of an electric charge. Ozone being unstable will naturally tend to revert back to its most stable form, O2. It is theorized that the potential therapeutic mechanism of ozone therapy may in fact be this reconversion process back to more stable oxygen compounds#.</p>

<p>Scientists in the 19th century found ozone to have properties which effectively destroyed bacteria, fungus and viruses in the test tube. It is known to be highly toxic to human beings when the gas is inhaled. In Europe, various circles have for several decades advocated increased use of ozone as a medical therapy for many ailments. Research in the past was hampered by technological obstacles. These barriers have since disappeared with the development of more advanced ozone-production techniques, along with the enhanced ability to properly measure and administer precise doses of ozone gas in laboratory and clinical research. Today ozone is used as an inexpensive and environmentally sound agent to purify water in sewage treatment systems.</p>

<p><b>Ozone and HIV</b><br>
Among those who advocate the therapeutic use of ozone there is no consensus as to what the treatment itself actually entails. Ozone can be administered as a pure gas infusion in blood which has been removed from a patient and then re-injected after its treatment with ozone. This process is called autohemotherapy. Another technique, known as rectal insufflation, involve the administering of ozone gas rectally. The more unorthodox of ozone treatment advocates claim that ozone can also be administered via a hydrogen peroxide solution or in certain ozone oils and creams.</p>

<p>There is no clearly documented biochemical mechanism by which ozone works to treat HIV. Theories imply the destruction of HIV by the oxidizing effects of ozone, either by interfering with the membrane surrounding the virus and the binding of the virus to the CD4 receptor. Another theory is that an HIV infected cell has lower levels of certain enzymes that protect healthy cells from the toxic effects of ozone. But studies in people say far more about the effectiveness of a substance than test tube studies. The body always complicates the working of a compound against an infectious agent. Most compounds tested as potential treatments for any disease are either too toxic or simply not effective.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest work on ozone as an anti-HIV agent was completed several years ago. The study was presented at the IV International AIDS Conference in Stockholm in 1988. The researchers found that ozone inactivates HIV in vitro by interfering with viral replication#. Dr. Michael Carpendale, M.D. of the San Francisco Veteran's Administration Hospital concludes in his report that further research was warranted to investigate the clinical applications of ozone as an antiviral treatment for HIV.</p>

<p>Relatively hopeful in vitro data was published in late 1991 in Blood, the journal of the American Society of Hematology. It should be noted that the article is described as an advertisement by the journal's editors. The researchers found that ozone, without significantly affecting the biologic activity of blood products (Factor VIII), inactivates HIV in vitro. They were able to achieve complete inactivation of HIV within several hours, depending of the dose of ozone administered. It was noted that nitrogen gas was also quite efficient in destroying HIV. Ozone however inactivated the virus more quickly. They did not attempt to delineate the way ozone worked. They stated that ozone deserves more study, to clearly ascertain what its role should be in treating viral disease.</p>

<p><b>"Oxywater"</b><br>
One of the most unorthodox ozone treatments is administered with food-grade hydrogen peroxide. In theory, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) when mixed with water (H2O) produces ozone (03). The diluted hydrogen peroxide is injected, ingested or simply bathed in over an extended period of time. This is believed to oxygenate the blood stream and purify the system. The side effects which follow are described by advocates as a healing crisis as a result of toxins being released from the body.</p>

<p>In much of the literature available on this treatment, most often in alternative treatment supply catalogs, one reads of the countless benefits of what is often marketed as "oxywater". These claims are always anecdotal and never substantiated by hard data. If one wonders why research has not examined this treatment, one need only ask if the theoretical presumptions of those who use "oxywater" as a way to administer ozone are sound. It is unclear if ozone is even present in diluted hydrogen peroxide. Regardless, the mixture would be fundamentally altered when swallowed and combined with the hydrochloric acid and numerous gastric enzymes in the stomach#. It is unlikely that any significant amount of ozone is introduced into the body. Therefore, there are no studies to examine the use of diluted hydrogen peroxide because the very premise for its use as an ozone therapy does not seem plausible. All the same, the incredible claims of proponents of diluted hydrogen peroxide continue unabated.</p>

<p>In spite of the lack of data concerning the effectiveness of diluted hydrogen peroxide, the fact remains that hydrogen peroxide is highly toxic when taken alone. Public health officials have urged caution reporting cases of accidental poisoning of people with AIDS due to drinking hydrogen peroxide#. Should you insist on trying this dubious form of ozone treatment, remember that its toxicity is reduced only when diluted. In addition, hydrogen peroxide which is not clearly labeled "food-grade" should never be ingested. This type of hydrogen peroxide, found in most pharmacies, in poisonous. It contains additional chemical stabilizers which are highly toxic even if mixed with water.</p>

<p><b>Ozone Treatment of Blood (Autohemotherapy)</b><br>
Most of the talk about ozone treatment is centered around a process known as autohemotherapy. Ozone is generated by a machine. It is then infused into the blood of a patient which had been previously removed. The treated blood is then re-injected. In theory it is believed to destroy the HIV through the mechanisms discussed above. Whether or not ozone is effective in inactivating HIV in the body remains to be seen. Current research does not look promising.</p>

<p>Because the process is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, it is illegal for physicians to treat people with ozone autohemotherapy. Various individuals have indeed been arrested. Advocates claim that this is why their evidence is always anecdotal and never able to be substantiated. Certain people have been arrested for practicing medicine without a license. These same individuals are usually involved in the sale of ozone equipment or related products. The seizure of medical files and equipment are regarded by many ozone advocates as part of a huge government conspiracy to protect entrenched government researchers and the interests of the pharmaceutical industry. Intrigue of this type simply further muddies the picture.</p>

<p>In Germany there is a clinic treating HIV and AIDS which provides this form of ozone therapy in combination with an intense dietary regimen and a unique form of experimental vaccine therapy using the patient's blood and urine. The treatment usually lasts up to three weeks and costs several thousand dollars. The clinic reports successful treatment with autohemotherapy, but has not conducted any large study worth mentioning. All reports of complete remission along with improved clinical benefits are anecdotal.</p>

<p>The only clinical trial to be found which examined ozone as an antiviral treatment for HIV was conducted at the University of Ottawa in Ontario, Canada. The phase I trial indicated that ozone infusion had no serious toxicities in the ten patients who participated. Three of the patients displayed a slight increase in their CD4+ counts. In a larger phase II double blinded study researchers sought to establish the potential efficacy of ozone infusion as an anti-HIV treatment. They compared the re-injection of untreated blood to that of ozone infused blood for a period of eight weeks, followed by a four week observation period. It should be noted that this phase II study lasted nearly three times as long a the usual ozone treatment presently done in Germany. There was no perceptible antiviral effect of the ozone treated blood. Ozone infusion had no recognizable clinical benefit in the phase II trial. In fact it was noted that the group which received ozone treated blood actually had a temporary but significant decrease in their t-cell counts. In the conclusion of the study, the researchers strongly discouraged the continued use of ozone as an alternative antiviral treatment for HIV.</p>

<p>Joseph Latino of Medizone, Inc. publicly refuted the research conducted at the University of Ottawa. Medizone, Inc. holds the patent to the process of autohemotherapy. Joseph Latino was also among the noted in the ad in Blood Journal. Medizone, Inc. stated that a member of the Canadian research team, Dr. Michael Shannon, issued a statement claiming that the equipment used in the study malfunctioned during the phase II trial, failing to produce ozone. In an interview, Dr. Gary Garber, chief investigator of the trial, stated categorically that the ozone producing equipment worked during the trial and to this day remains in his possession and continues to work. He was unable to understand the motives behind the erroneous claims of Medizone, Inc. Several attempts to contact Dr. Shannon were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>A researcher in San Francisco which reports positive clinical results in treating AIDS related diarrhea with ozone. The ozone is introduced rectally. The patients had unexplained chronic diarrhea. Four of the five patients were successfully treated. While the study is very small (only five people) and remains unpublished, the investigator is confident that ozone will no doubt have many medical applications, regardless of its effectiveness as an anti-HIV agent. He believes that ozone clearly has an anti-HIV effect which may explain its effectiveness against the HIV-related diarrhea. Because the study itself was much too small to determine efficacy of the treatment administered, the conclusions of the researcher are wholly speculative as to HIV as the primary cause of the diarrhea itself and the effect of ozone upon HIV in vivo.</p>

<p><b>The Wizard of Ozone</b><br>
To get a better sense of the wild world of ozone, it is helpful to take a closer look at the activities of one of its most prominent proponents. Mr. Ed McCabe operates a mail-order business in Florida which sells everything from ozone oils and creams to expensive ozone-producing equipment. He publishes The Family News, which is a catalog, filled with articles which tell of the wonders of ozone. Mr. McCabe has written many articles on ozone therapy and often states that people have sero-converted from HIV positive to HIV negative. There remains to be a single case which is documented. One would think that if literally thousands of people had been sero-converted, as is now claimed by various ozone advocates in the United States and Europe; at least one case would be actually documented. The reason most often given: fear. It is claimed that physicians doing this miraculous work are too frightened by the federal government to come out publicly with their research.</p>

<p>In an attempt to confirm some of Mr. McCabe's claims, I was struck by the degree to which erroneous information is published as fact. One example of Mr. McCabe's work involves a researcher at New York University. Mr. McCabe writes in Successful AIDS Treatments that "Drs. John Waldron and Philip Tierno continue their New York University study on ozone's effectiveness in killing viruses, after getting a 1.4 million dollar budget approved by the NYU board. He reports 100% kill ratios on over 46 viral groupings. Showing any substance to be 100% effective in viral kills while being harmless to blood components is startling news."</p>

<p>In an interview, Dr. Tierno of NYU explained that John Waldron is not a doctor, but sells ozone equipment. He has absolutely no allocated budget for ozone research, nor is he sure what Mr. McCabe means by "NYU board". The ozone experiment he conducted did not involve a single viral grouping, not to mention 46 such groupings. Mr. McCabe's comments about the effect of ozone on the biologic activity of blood was interesting in that Dr. Tierno did not use blood or blood product. In reality, Dr. Tierno's work examined the effect of ozone on microbes in liquid. In the end, he stated that there may in fact be some very useful medical applications of ozone, but that "loose cannons" like Mr. McCabe only serve to distort the picture.</p>

<p>The vast majority of ozone treatment advocates with whom I spoke currently maintain some sort of financial relationship with a corporation which manufactures and/or sells ozone producing equipment or holds the patent for the process itself. It is difficult not to question the motives of such advocates. These same people vociferously denounce the pharmaceutical industry for their cold-blooded profiteering, as they construct elaborate conspiratorial theories to explain the scant amount of research on the various types of ozone therapy. Often their treatment of issues surrounding HIV disease reveals an incredible degree of unfamiliarity with the AIDS epidemic and the communities most directly affected by the disease. One self-styled healer, named Waves Forest writes, "As far as AIDS is concerned, some victims may find hyper-oxygenation cures them of not only AIDS but their inclination toward homosexuality."</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b><br>
Anecdotal evidence of ozone curing HIV disease seems to increase with each passing week. Literally thousands are claimed to have been sero-converted to HIV antibody negative and PCR negative (the most conclusive procedure available to detect HIV in the body). Conspiracies involving the FBI, the FDA and pharmaceutical industry are most often indicated by advocates of ozone therapies as the reason that so little data exists on ozone. Conservative researchers counter that the hypothetical reasoning of ozone advocates is too weak to warrant an aggressive examination. The situation is distorted further as every piece of "new" information regarding ozone comes with some misleading sales pitch. Miracle oxygen water, ozone creams, or ozone machines to purify the air all sold right along side reports of complete remission from the ravages of AIDS.</p>

<p>Ozone does not appear to have any direct anti-HIV effect in people. Nevertheless, the research establishment at the NIH has a responsibility to adequately examine ozone therapies to advance the treatment of AIDS or simply to end the exploitation of people infected with the virus. If people are actually using ozone therapies, it is imperative that its effectiveness be established or clearly refuted. When the NIH established the Office for the Study of Unconventional Medical Practices (OSUMP), it held hearings with researchers discussing an array alternative treatments for numerous ailments. Many ozone advocates with whom I spoke, including an associate of Ed McCabe, were pleased with the meeting. The NIH agreed to investigate the anecdotal claims surrounding ozone. But only $2 million (a mere drop in the federal research bucket) has been committed to OSUMP. No trials are currently under development.</p>

<p>Over ten years into the epidemic our experience dictates two things: caution in the face of the manipulative marketing strategies of many ozone advocates, and a real commitment on the part of the government to more aggressively fund and initiate necessary research that the pharmaceutical industry will not. This pertains not only to ozone therapy, but to the countless treatment modalities currently being discussed throughout the country. As long as we lack an effective treatment for HIV disease, we must cautiously search all avenues. It is the balance between hopeful optimism and fatalistic cynicism which may prove to be as elusive as the cure.</p>

<p><b><a name="Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thymosin alpha-1">Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thymosin alpha-1</a></b><br>
by <i>Theo Smart </i></p>

<p><a href="../info/thym.html">Thymosin alpha-1</a> is an injectable thymic hormone approved for use in patients with hepatitis B & C in Italy and Singapore. The PWA Health Group has decided to import thymosin alpha-1 for people with a doctor's prescription. We are still working out the particulars, call us to get on the waiting list.</p>

<p>Researchers think that thymosin alpha-1 plays a role in the maturation and effectiveness of T-cells, as well as having a number of other biologic activities (for example -- I'm sorry but I find this fascinating -- it makes sperm swim faster). In test tube and animal studies, it appears to trigger potent immune reactions that fight conditions such as cancer, hepatitis, AIDS, and diseases of the elderly. Studies in people haven't found any toxicities associated with thymosin alpha-1. (This contrasts with the severe flu-like symptoms caused by alpha-interferon, the current standard of care for hepatitis.) So far, these studies seem to be confirming the promising laboratory data, particularly as a treatment for hepatitis.</p>

<p><b>Hepatitis B</b><br>
Some of the first evidence that thymosin alpha-1 might work against hepatitis came from a study in woodchucks, (which we called groundhogs back in Ohio, and boy are we glad someone's found a good use for them). There have only been three small studies in people with hepatitis B (with a total of thirty-six patients). The first, performed by a researcher named Mutchnick (which would make a great name for a woodchuck) was a placebo controlled pilot study in twelve patients. Seven patients who received thymosin for six months had reductions in liver enzymes that were sustained for at least two years after stopping drug. Six of these patients completely cleared hepatitis B virus from their blood. One patient on placebo recovered. The patients who responded to thymosin also got improved CD4 cell counts, and higher levels of gamma interferon (a blood chemical which helps fight infections) as a bonus. There were no side effects.</p>

<p>There are two problems with this study however. First, it isn't large enough to be sure that the results weren't just random, and second, the patients on "thymosin" weren't all on thymosin alpha-1. Four of the seven patients were given thymosin fraction 5, the complete hormone that thymosin alpha-1 is merely part of. The researchers pooled the data from both thymosins as if they would have the exact same effect. We don't know if that is the case.</p>

<p>The study continued to enroll. Results with twenty patients (8 on placebo and 12 on thymosin alpha-1) were published last year. Nine out of the twelve patients on drug responded to treatment with thymosin alpha-1. Seven of these patients remained free from hepatitis for three to five years after they stopped taking the drug.</p>

<p>The second study was in 14 patients that researchers concluded would not respond to therapy because their condition was so bad. Half were treated with alpha interferon, half with thymosin alpha-1. Two of the seven treated with thymosin alpha-1 had a complete remission of their hep. B, while none of the patients on alpha interferon did. A third study, using the combination of thymosin alpha-1 and alpha interferon in fifteen patients with chronic hep. B, reported improvement in liver enzymes in eleven out of fifteen patients, and clearance of hep. B viral DNA in fourteen out of fifteen patients.</p>

<p>These studies are too small to bank much on, but a larger phase III hep. B study is on-going with ninety-nine patients. The patients receive either two weekly injections of 1.6 mg of thymosin alpha-1 or placebo. The study should be finished in April '94. If the results are consistent with earlier findings, Alpha-1 Biomedicals plans to submit an application for approval as soon as the data is analyzed (by the third or fourth quarter this year). If the FDA approves it, thymosin alpha-1 might be available for hepatitis B (and off label uses) sometime in early '95. This is the best case scenario if the FDA is in an accelerated approval frame of mind. What's more likely is that the FDA will require them to perform another large study, and the whole process could take another one to two years. Perhaps AIDS treatment activists should let the FDA know the importance of safe hepatitis drugs. Hint, hint.</p>

<p><b>Hepatitis C</b><br>
Preliminary data suggests that thymosin alpha-1 may be less useful against hepatitis C. A small study published last November, showed that thymosin alpha-1 had absolutely no effect when used by itself in 7 patients with hep. C.</p>

<p>But in animal studies, when thymosin alpha-1 was used in combination with alpha interferon (or other cytokines from the immune system such as interleukin-2), the immune response was much more dramatic than when either compound was used alone. Adding thymus extracts to IL-2 or alpha interferon might be like fertilizing the soil when you sow the corn (uh-oh my Ohio's coming out again) which is obviously important if you want it to grow knee high by the fourth of July. Gee, I forgot where this analogy was heading. Oh well. </p>

<p>By itself, alpha-interferon's effect on hepatitis C is not so great. However, a long-term open label Italian study in fifteen patients with chronic hep. C shows somewhat better results with the combo of thymosin plus interferon. Eleven out of 15 patients showed reductions in liver enzymes, nine cleared the virus, and damaged liver tissue showed improved health in six of the patients. These results were sustained for at least six months after quitting drug. An ongoing American placebo controlled study is seeing a significant benefit from the combination of interferon and thymosin alpha-1, which may be tied to the continuation of therapy. This study is still enrolling, but is being run by the Army at Walter Reed and in Denver, call Alpha-1 Biomedicals at (301) 564-4400 for info.</p>

<p><b>Thymosin in HIV disease</b><br>
A 1986 study showed that thymosin alpha-1 and/or thymosin fraction 5 didn't raise CD4 cell counts when given alone to forty-two patients. Ten of these patients were on thymosin alpha-1 (60 ug /day). But more recently an Italian researcher named Garaci has been studying thymosin alpha-1 (1 mg s.c. twice weekly) in combination with AZT and alpha interferon. He reports that patients on the triple combo do much better. His study had four arms: <a href="../../network/simple/zido.html">AZT</a>; AZT + thymosin alpha-1; AZT + alpha interferon; and AZT + thymosin alpha-1 + alpha interferon. Twenty eight patients finished a year on study. Seven patients who took all three drugs had an average increase of 187 CD4 cells, improved CD4/CD8 ratios, and natural killer cells removed from them appeared to have regained their anti-HIV activity, which is usually suppressed in people with HIV disease. Their viral load dropped more too. In contrast, patients who took thymosin alpha-1 plus AZT had an average gain of 35 CD4 cells; those who took AZT plus alpha interferon lost 4 CD4 cells; and those who took AZT alone lost 51 CD4 cells on average.</p>

<p>23 patients completed 18 months of therapy. In the patients who received all three drugs, the average CD4 cell count increased by yet another 50 cells (although the author noted that this was not statistically significant). The other arms were stable or declined over the same period. No adverse effects were observed in any patient on thymosin alpha-1. A larger follow-up study is going on in Italy in 108 patients. The study will measure CD4 and CD8 cell counts, beta-2 microglobulin, and markers of HIV activity.</p>

<p><b>U.S. Study Still Enrolling</b><br>
The only way people with HIV can get free thymosin alpha-1 free in the US is through a small study (14 patients, ten have enrolled) that Dr. Thomas Merigan is running at Stanford University. The patients will receive a combination of AZT and<a href="../../network/simple/iltwo.html">interleukin-2</a> , the blood chemical that stimulates T-cells to become active and proliferate, plus thymosin alpha-1 at two doses, starting at a dose about half what was used in the hepatitis studies. Why the low dose? Because the FDA demanded it, despite years of use with no toxicity. Dr. Merigan needs patients without symptoms who have CD4 cell counts between 100-200, since that's the range when people start to get opportunistic infections. He wants to see if the combination of IL-2 and thymosin alpha-1 can boost people's CD4 counts, and if it does, whether that will keep them from getting sick. Dr. Merigan will also be looking for changes in viral load. He expects to have data from this study within six months. To get into this study, call him at (415) 725-3929.</p>

<p>When you look at the data from the Garaci study you have to wonder why the hell there aren't other thymosin studies in the US. Other drugs, such as ddC, steamrolled their way into the U.S. government's we'll-pay-your-way clinical trial system on the basis of in vitro data and similar (although less dramatic) CD4 cell rises in eight people in one combo study. This was particularly sickening because the maker, Hoffmann-La Roche has more money than God (I'd say the Goddess but I don't think SHE's such a capitalist). Not to let Alpha Biomedicals off too easy. They do stand to make a bundle with this drug, (and you can't make money without spending it). But if there was ever a drug for the government to speed along, this seems to be it, if not for HIV, then for hepatitis. And unlike FIAU, another hepatitis drug that the feds used our tax dollars to study, this one won't kill you.</p>

<p><b>Thymopentin</b></p>

<p>Thymopentin (or TP5) is another injectable thymic extract that is being studied in PWAs. TP5 is a chemical copy of the active part of a thymic hormone called thymopoietin. This hormone also plays a role in what type of T-cell immature stem cells will become, and how well they function after they mature. TP5 has been widely tested for a variety of indications, in HIV positive and negative patients and the only toxicities ever mentioned have been slight inflammation where the needle goes in.</p>

<p>A number of studies have evaluated TP5's potential in treating AIDS. One phase II placebo controlled trial looked at thymopentin, 50 mg subcutaneously, (s.c.) three times per week, in 91 HIV positive patients both with and without symptoms. The asymptomatic patients on TP5 had a better CD4 cell response than those in placebo. None of the asymptomatic patients on TP5 developed symptoms, while 3 patients on placebo did. There was, no difference between TP5 and placebo for patients with symptoms.</p>

<p>A 48 week phase III study compared TP5 plus AZT (300-600 mg/day) to AZT in patients with 200 to 500 CD4 cells. The study found no significant difference between the two groups. But when the investigators massaged the data a little, they found that the patients who had been on AZT for more than 6 months, did better on the AZT/TP5 combo. Out of 115 patients on AZT/TP5 only 2 (1.7%) progressed to AIDS or death compared to 10 out of 120 (8.3%) of the placebo/azt patients. The figures were somewhat stronger when they limited the analysis to patients with less than 400 CD4 cells.</p>

<p><b>A TP5 Trial Now Enrolling</b><br>
Playing with the data this way might reveal interesting trends, or may just invent them. To find out which the company decided to do a larger study evaluating TP5 with AZT and other nucleoside analogues. This study, run through a large number of community doctors across the country, is looking for more than 2,100 symptom-free patients (with CD4 cell counts between 200 and 400) who have used AZT for at least six months. While on study (which may last up to 2 years) you can continue taking whatever nucleoside analogue cocktail you like. To find a local site for the trial call 1 (800) TRIALS-A.</p>

<p><b><a name="I am Mary's Thymus"></a>I am Mary's Thymus</b><br>
by<i> Kevin Armington</i></p>

<p>Seated at the top of your heart and reaching into your lower neck, the thymus gland receives comparatively little glory vis-a-vis its crucial functions. The thymus is an early bloomer, reaching its peak mass at puberty. The rest is downhill; after puberty the thymus begins a slow and steady process referred to as involution, which means it returns to its normal size. That is a polite way of saying that over time, the thymus turns into fat.</p>

<p>As late as the 1960's the thymus was largely a mystery. Now it's known that the thymus has at least two critical roles: development of T cells and eliminating T cells mistakenly programmed to attack the body (autoimmunity). The thymus continues to process T cells and secrete important hormones in adulthood. What's not yet clear are the details of how the thymus works and what is a complete mystery is the role the thymus plays in the course of HIV infection.</p>

<p>The thymus is classified as a gland because it secretes hormones. Thymic hormones are peptides, or short chains of amino acids. These hormones participate in T cells differentiation and send feedback messages to other parts of the body, such as the central nervous system. The four thymic hormones identified to date are thymosin, thymopoietin, thymulin and thymic humoral factor.</p>

<p><b>The Thymus and T-cells</b><br>
T cells are not produced in the thymus, but that is where they become T cells. T cells start out as stem cells in the bone marrow with a specific "zip code" sequence to help them find the thymus. When they arrive, they are refined into:</p>

<ul>
<li>T4 cells (also called T helper or CD4 cells),
<li>T8 cells (also called T suppressor or CD8 cells)
<li>T8 cells called CTLs or "cytotoxic T lymphocytes" CTLs secrete substances called that rupture and kill cells that harbor foreign particles, like viruses.
</ul>

<p>All T cells belong to a class of white blood cells called lymphocytes. Lymphocytes for the most part carry out their functions in lymph tissue, and are called either "T" or "B" lymphocytes. If you have already guessed that "T" stands for "t-hymus-derived" you are correct and you get 50 free T cells. B cells mature in the bone marrow, but contrary to common belief, they are not called "B" because of that. The name actually comes from a gland in B-irds called the "b-ursa of Fabricius". We lack the fabulous "bursa of Fabricius" but fortunately b-one marrow also begins with "B".</p>

<p><b>One Billion Varieties of T4 Cells and Counting</b><br>
Incredibly, your immune system somehow anticipates all the foreign particles (antigens) that can make their way into your bloodstream. The thymus tailors individual T4 cells for hundreds of millions of possible antigens. Substances called cytokines (such as interleukins) and the four thymic hormones are secreted by the thymus to shape T cells. This process doesn't happen in a vacuum. Regulatory messages from other parts of the body, including the nervous system, affect T cell differentiation.</p>

<p>The end result is that each mature T cell has a unique code in the shape of a particular receptor sticking through its membrane. This receptor fits one particular foreign particle, like a key slipping into a lock. Once mature, T cells go out in the bloodstream or the lymph, ready to bind to their particular foreign particle. Once it binds to it, the T cell is stimulated to proliferate.</p>

<p><b>The Thymus and HIV</b><br>
Surprisingly, there are few references in the medical literature on the effects of HIV in the thymus. Those that are published are not all in agreement. Some autopsy studies found that thymic degeneration (involution) is more pronounced in people with HIV infection. Dr. Savino and colleagues found fewer Hassall's corpuscles, the clumps of cells in the thymus that are associated with secretion of hormones. They also found that epithelial cells in the thymus were damaged and that levels of thymulin are reduced. These findings are corroborated by Dr. Crody and colleagues.</p>

<p>Whether these changes are caused by HIV specifically or are a result of immunodeficiency is a matter of debate. Schuuman and colleagues (1989) found that PWA's thymuses were abnormally degenerated and that their Hassall's corpuscles were low when compared to healthy thymuses, but there were no differences between the samples from HIV-infected patients and those taken from patients who died from other illnesses. They also found that epithelial cells were normal in both populations, and low levels of HIV proteins in the samples taken from PWAs, indicating to them that HIV does not significantly affect the thymus in a direct way.</p>

<p>However, more recent studies in the SCID-hu mouse indicate otherwise. The SCID-hu mouse, a creation of the laboratory, has no immune system of its own, but can be given a close approximation of the human immune system. In SCID-hu mice that were given thymus tissue implants, HIV has been shown to infect the immature T cells developing within the thymus and the thymic epithelial cells themselves. Similar patterns have recently been found in the thymus of infants that died of AIDS. Any disruption in the environment of the thymus (for example, if certain thymic hormones aren't being made, and inflammatory cytokines like IL6 are being produced in record amounts) could have a dramatic impact upon the effectiveness or type of cell that matures there. And if the t-cells get infected before maturation, well, that might partly explain why CD4 cells don't seem to be able to regenerate themselves.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b><br>
The thymus gland is essential for maintaining a properly functioning immune system although its role is still not entirely understood. Unfortunately, neither is the effect of HIV on the thymus. There is some agreement that the gland functions at a lower or impaired capacity in people with HIV infection. A better understanding of the thymus gland and its interaction with HIV would be desirable before developing treatments that attempt to increase CD4 counts, but we do not have this luxury.</p>

<p><b><a name="HEPATITIS AND HIV">HEPATITIS AND HIV</a></b><br>

By<i> Donald M. Jensen, M.D. (reprinted from POSITIVELY AWARE, Feb. '94)</i></p>

<p>Not long after tests were developed to diagnose HIV infection, it became apparent that many people with HIV were also infected with the hepatitis B virus. In fact, more than 90% of HIV-infected people show past or present evidence of hepatitis B CO-INFECTION (infection with both viruses).</p>

<p>Interestingly, many of these people have few symptoms of liver disease and do not recollect symptoms of hepatitis in the past. Because chronic hepatitis infection is more common and can be more severe in people with HIV, it is therefore important that all people with HIV be tested for the hepatitis viruses whether or not they show symptoms of infections.</p>

<p><b>HEPATITIS B:</b><br>
Many kinds of hepatitis virus exist, but the most common is hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV is not opportunistic—it can cause disease in people with healthy immune systems. Infection with HBV is relatively common in the United States and even more prevalent in parts of Asia and Africa. It has been estimated that there are more than 1 million chronic carriers of the HBV in the U.S. and in Taiwan, for example, up to 20 percent of the adult population carries this virus.</p>

<p>The natural history of HBV is well-known. The virus can be detected in blood, urine, semen, and most other body secretions. It is transmitted similarly to HIV—when these body fluids come into contact with the blood of an uninfected person through accidental needle sticks, intravenous drug use, tattoos, and sexual activity.</p>

<p>After an incubation period of 60-160 days, most patients develop "acute hepatitis" with malaise, loss of appetite, and yellow jaundice. The acute hepatitis is caused by T-cells of the host attack-ing and destroying virus-infected liver cells. Liver infection is followed by recovery and subsequent immunity in more than 95 percent of infected persons. Approximately 5 percent will fail to eliminate the virus from the liver and become chronic carriers. When investigated, many of these chronic carriers have minimal or absent symptoms of acute hepatitis and have an immune system that fails to adequately eliminate the viral-infected liver cells. After a 10-20 year follow-up, more than 25 percent of chronic carriers will develop cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) and some will develop liver cancer.</p>

<p>The frequent co-infection of hepatitis B in people with HIV is easily explained. Both viruses are spread by similar routes of transmission, so HIV-infected persons are more likely to be exposed to HBV and vice-versa. Also, because the T-cells that fight infection may be substantially weakened, chronic hepatitis infection is more likely to develop.</p>

<p><b>THE VACCINE</b>: A safe and effective vaccine for the prevention of hepatitis B exists, but it must be administered before exposure to HBV occurs. Although the vaccine doesn't also "take" in people with HIV, it can be an effective way to avoid infection among those not previously exposed to the virus. (Ed. note, a liver doctor we've spoken to says the vaccine still "takes" in PWAs, just not as much. He gives PWAs repeated vaccinations, to be on the safe side.)</p>

<p><b>SAFER SEX</b>: The most effective pre-ventive measure against HBV infection, however, is the same used against HIV: safer sex and safer needle use. Hepatitis is one more reason that people with HIV should always practice safer sex, even with other HIV-positive people.</p>

<p><b>HEPATITIS C</b><br>
Once tests for hepatitis C became available in 1989, an increased prevalence of this virus was detected among people with HIV—predominantly among injection drug users. Our knowledge of hepatitis C is limited because of its recent discovery. It appears, however, that hepatitis C is even more prevalent than hepatitis B.</p>

<p>Transmission occurs predominantly through exposure to contaminated blood. Sexual transmission is much less common. Illness may develop following a four- to twelve- week incubation period. Even in HIV-negative people, 50 percent of cases progress to chronic disease, and most are asymptomatic.</p>

<p><b>TREATMENT:</b><br>
Alpha interferon 2b (Intron A) can enhance the immune response of those infected with either the hepatitis B or C virus. The drug can also inhibit viral replication in the liver. Intron A is administered by injection for either 16 weeks (for hepatitis B) or for 24 weeks (for hepatitis C). The most common side effects are flu-like symptoms, which are rarely severe and seem to improve with continued therapy.</p>

<p>Treatment is the same for people with HIV but is often less effective.</p>

<p>There is no evidence that people with HIV and HBV co-infection progress more quickly to AIDS. Because hepatitis can be more severe and more difficult to treat in people with HIV, however, it is important that they get tested whether or not they show symptoms, so that therapeutic options can be considered before serious illness develops.</p>

<p><b><a name="Life With the FDA">Life With the FDA,</a> or Your Tax Dollars At Work</b></p>			

<p>Recently in a spate of zealous nitpicking, the FDA office in Cincinnati held up two of our shipments from Mexico. The first, a package of <a href="../info/albe.html">albendazole</a>, was released after two and a half weeks, on March 11. The second, containing <a href="../info/tini.html">tinidazole</a> and <a href="../info/isop.html">isoprinosine</a>, remains in hock, hung onto by Cincinnati FDA enforcement officers Bill Sedgewick and Ron Smith, determined to prove our evil and wicked ways.</p>

<p>So what's going on? Hard to know whether the FDA, so eager to prove that they can responsibly (and intelligently) regulate alternative therapies, is changing their policy towards AIDS buyers' clubs, or is being led by two bureaucrats bored with life since the Mapplethorpe exhibit left town.</p>

<p>Hard to know because Randy Wykoff's Office of AIDS and Special Health initially encouraged our calls, then sang a different tune after meeting with Regulatory Affairs on March 3rd, and finally concluded on March 11th that: "this was an irregularity...nothing has changed in the agency's policy towards buyers' clubs."</p>

<p>Nothing has changed except that for the first time in seven years we are being asked for prescriptions for tinidazole and isoprinosine, products that we have openly imported without prescriptions for years. Neither requires a prescription in Mexico. Nothing has changed except that if you cannot tolerate Flagyl for giardia or amoebas, now you can't get a three day alternative that is widely available in many countries. Nothing has changed unless isoprinosine is part of your plan for immune modulation. Clearly nothing has changed about how bureaucrats within the FDA fail to intelligently protect the public's health.</p>

<p>Five meetings and countless phone calls later, one shipment is released and the other remains in limbo. In the same two weeks, the FDA stops all trials at a San Diego hospital because of problems with the GI (gastro-intestinal) department, keeping a PWA from getting compassionate use HPMPC for CMV retinitis. Activist friends call the FDA to ask why problems in a different dep't would hold up this vision-saving treatment, and he gets the drug, no thanks to the FDA. News reports come in of contaminated IV gamma globulin from Baxter, with 28 PWAs infected with a virulent form of hepatitis C. It's pulled from the market, but the question is how did this happen in the first place? The FDA is looking into it. But don't worry, isoprinosine and tinidazole are being held up. Whew.<p>

<p>Both of these shipments fall under the personal use importation guidelines. Why is the FDA interfering with personal use shipments? Why are they asking for prescriptions instead of the personal use statements that for seven years we've used and they've accepted?</p>

<p>I invite you all to give them a call and ask. It's our tax dollars, - they work for us and it's our life and our survival. It's time to remind them. - sc</p>

<p>The PWA Health Group is getting harrassed by the FDA and would like your help</p>

<p>Burroughs Wellcome's new PCP drug, Mepron, also known as atovaquone or 566C80, was approved last year for use in patients with mild to moderate <a href="../../network/simple/pcp.html">PCP</a> who are intolerant to Bactrim/Septra. Unfortunately, many PWAs have trouble absorbing the drug and their PCP gets worse. In clinical studies, most of the people who failed on Mepron had lower levels of the drug in their blood. We've heard a number of reports about PWAs failing on this drug, and are worried that for an unknown number of people, taking Mepron might equal taking nothing at all.</p>

<p>The problem with absorption is threefold. First - Mepron needs to bind to fat to get absorbed at all, which means you need to make sure you have enough fat in your diet. Burroughs Wellcome originally suggested taking the drug with a high fat diet, which they define as at least 23 grams of fat per meal (2- 3 tablespoons plus of butter). Recently, the Burroughs Wellcome team changed their tune to say that an "average" diet probably provides enough fat for absorbing Mepron, apparently worried that the "high fat diet" requirement was scaring people away. The weighty PR questions aside, if you are taking Mepron, head for the Haagen Daz (or the more politically correct Ben and Jerry's) and don't hesitate to load up on butter. It could save your life.</p>

<p>But - second problem: there is no guarantee that a high fat diet will do the trick. For unknown reasons, some people still don't seem to absorb adequate levels of the drug. Who are these people and how do you know whether you're one of them? Right now, it's hard to say. Burroughs Wellcome has no answers, but has noted that patients with severe diarrhea don't do so well. Can you tell once you're taking Mepron if you're absorbing it well? No. Burroughs Wellcome has offered no tests for you or your doc by which to monitor your blood levels of Mepron once you're taking the drug. Asked if there were even any indirect tests, like elevated enzymes of some sort, that would indicate absorption - Burroughs Wellcome says no. If you take Mepron, monitor your symptoms closely. If you're using it for prophylaxis - don't ignore any dry coughs.</p>

<p>Problem #3 - Mepron gets absorbed over time. Some of the drug is absorbed shortly after you take it, but the bulk of the dose gets released by your liver later. This second release can happen any time from one to four days after you take the first pill. The result is that it can take six or seven days to get effective (PCP fighting) levels of the drug in your blood (if you have enough fat in your diet and you absorb fat well). During this time, your PCP may be progressing from "mild or moderate" to quite severe.</p>

<p>Mepron looks like a good oral drug, well tolerated (not nearly as toxic as iv pentamidine, for example) and very effective in most people. If you can absorb it, it's great to have an alternative, especially if you're allergic to Bactrim. What's scary is that taking it might do nothing for your PCP for several days, and possibly nothing for your PCP at all. So what can you do?</p>

<p><b>When taking Mepron</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>keep close track of your symptoms

<li>make sure your doctor is similarly attentive

<li>maximize your fat intake at every meal, with butter, ice cream, fish oil, supplements, the works (see below),

<li>get your fat absorption checked to see if the fat you're eating is getting in your body,

<li>consider taking another anti- PCP drug for the first week (see the Bactrim and Mepron study mentioned below)

<li>work on get de-sensitized to Bactrim/Septra (see following box).
</ul>

<p><b>Upping the ante</b><br>
I suspect (and I'm pretty sure Burroughs Wellcome does too) that one Mepron problem is fat absorption. Many PWAs have problems absorbing fat. One symptom of poor fat absorption is severe diarrhea and since you need to absorb fat to absorb the drug...well, you do the math. If you can absorb Mepron, increasing your body's ability to absorb fat will help you absorb Mepron. On the other hand, if you have severe intestinal problems and can't absorb well, no amount of fat in your diet will help you absorb Mepron.</p>

<p>How do you know if you have trouble absorbing fat? If you're allergic to Bactrim/Septra, it would be useful to know. (It'd be good to know anyway, as lousy fat absorption is an awfully common cause of weight loss, and now there's weight gain products designed for people who can't absorb fat well.) Fat gets absorbed in your small intestine, and it's not easy to know unless you have some clear symptoms, like diarrhea. However, there are several studies documenting poor fat absorption in PWAs without either diarrhea and weight loss.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any readily available, accurate method for checking fat absorption. The most common way is to measure how much fat you are excreting, to put it as delicately as possible, by eating a regular fat content meal, and having your stool stained in a lab to measure the fat that slipped on through your system. This fecal stain test is quite imprecise. Other possible tests, including lipid levels, albumin to globulin ratios, total proteins, etc., need to be looked at within a broader context of how your small intestine, your liver, etc. are working, but can be indirect indicators of fat malabsorption.</p>

<p>If you can't absorb fat well, one thing to consider is taking Mepron with nutritional supplements made with easy- to- absorb fats, such as Liposorb or Isosource, or the simple fats themselves (the real thing) as in the Mead Johnson product, MCT Oil. These are available at drug stores without a prescription (see <a href="22.html">NOTES, #22</a>). MCT Oil is sold in quart form only by Mead Johnson, and cheap it's not, running $70- 80/quart. Probably a script is a good idea. You may also absorb fat better if your diet includes essential fatty acids such as those found in flaxseed oil and fish oil, which you can find in health food stores. I asked Dr. Rogers, one of the Burroughs Wellcome docs, about taking Liposorb, and he thought it might help Mepron absorption, and mentioned that they were thinking of running a small study to see if that was true. Think on, Burroughs Wellcome, time's a- wasting.</p>

<p>One idea for coping with how long it may take to absorb sufficient levels of Mepron comes from an interesting little Burroughs Wellcome study mentioned at their community meetings lat fall. For a week or two they gave patients Mepron and Bactrim at the same time. The patients were all allergic to Bactrim, but since it usually takes a week or two for the rash to appear, most patients achieved effective levels of Mepron by the time their rash appeared (at which point they could safely stop taking Bactrim). The company hasn't evaluated other drugs with Mepron, and has no plans to do so in the near future.</p>

<p><b>The New Atovaquone</b><br>
Last fall, Burroughs Wellcome's PR machine heard activist rumblings about Mepron breakthroughs and quickly scheduled a series of meetings. The centerpiece of these meetings was a new liquid formulation of the drug which they claim will be absorbed 2 to 3 times more than the current tablets. Well, great, but this formulation won't be available until the end of 1994 at the earliest. We asked Burroughs Wellcome to analyze blood work from the clinical trials in the meantime to see whether any of the indirect measurements used to check fat absorption were correlated with poor Mepron absorption, in hopes of finding some absorption markers for the current formulation. They've agreed to do this, but told us that it would take a few weeks.</p>

<p>Is the liquid formulation released faster in the body once it's absorbed? Recently released pharmacokinetics data from a study of 80 HIV positive patients shows that most patients taking the new liquid formulation get therapeutic levels in their blood by the 2nd day, using a dose of 750 mg 3 x/day with food, (the highest trial dose), and by the 4th day at the latest. Consistent (steady state) levels of Mepron are not achieved until 7 to 10 days after starting therapy.</p>

<p>This liquid formulation is being tested in several trial sites around the country for people with acute PCP who are not allergic to Bactrim/Septra. If you are in this trial, keep track of your symptoms and remember that you have the option to withdraw from the study at any time and get regular PCP therapy with no retribution.</p>

<p>What about prophylaxis? The pill form has never been studied for prophylaxis, and the liquid formulation is in trials now. So we don't know. It may, if you're absorbing it well. And if you're allergic to everything else, it's genuinely encouraging to have an alternative. Just don't ignore any dry coughs. The NIH is running the prophylaxis trial down in Rockville, and they'll fly you down there if you qualify (you have to pay for the first trip).</p>

<p>Ironically, Burroughs Wellcome has placed a price cap on Mepron that you would only reach if you were using this drug over a long period of time, say as a prophylaxis. Gee, does this sound like Burroughs Wellcome might be trying to promote this usage on the sly? M- m- m- maybe. In the meantime, remember Bactrim/Septra just got registered for PCP prophylaxis (believe it or not, it's been off- label all this time) and there's always dapsone or aerosolized pentamidine to reduce the chances of coming down with PCP.</p>

<p>Other options for acute PCP, either for combination with Mepron or alone, include dapsone, which many patients allergic to Bactrim/Septra can still take; a clindamycin/primaquine combination, which is more toxic and less effective; IV pentamidine; or IV trimetrexate, which is available via Treatment IND to anyone who have failed or are intolerant to Bactrim/Septra. Your doctor can enroll you by calling (800) 537- 9978.</p>

<p>In sum, lots of doctors like Mepron - it's safer than pentamidine and works well in most PWAs who take it. And good clinical practice almost always involves balancing an awful amount of ambiguity about the best course of action because of the limitations of drugs, and the complexity of HIV- related absorption problems. All the doctors we interviewed for this piece use Mepron carefully, sometimes using pentamidine and/or Bactrim re- sensitization and/or other therapies. In some ways, the Mepron story seems like a horrific tease: two years ago, we didn't have such a promising alternative for PWAs with Bactrim allergies and now we have one but we can't measure when it's working well or not.</p>

<p>Since PCP is still the number one life threatening infection for PWAs, it's heartening that Mepron's absorption problems are being worked on. This is unusual in the history of AIDS drug development. Although drug absorption problems are common (look at the AZT trials), they remain hidden and by in large un- researched in the context of drug development. Clinical trial participants are handpicked, especially in early pharmacokinetics trials, so once again the American drug development process fails those who need it most, the bulk of the people who will buy and use the drugs. It's estimated that 50- 70% of PWAs suffer from chronic diarrhea, the most common symptom of malabsorption and one of the most common reasons for getting excluded from an early trial. The FDA fails to push companies about the limitations of their absorption studies, but that doesn't mean we can't. In the meantime, some thing else that hasn't changed is that you're the real expert here, you know best how your body is responding. Grace under fire is fighting for your own survival.</p>

<p><b><a name="Amphobearables">Amphobearables</a></b></p>

<p><a href="../../network/simple/menin.html">Cryptococcal meningitis</a> (CM) and other severe fungal infections can be very difficult to treat and often wind up killing PWAs. The only drug that works in many of these cases, intravenous <a href="../../network/access/drugs/amph.html">Amphotericin B</a>, is often called "amphoterrible" since the toxicities are potentially fatal, and at the very least extremely unpleasant. However, some companies have developed new forms of the drug by enclosing it in a liposome, which is really little more than a tiny bubble of fat. The liposomal form of the drug may reduce toxicity and might even work better.</p>

<p><b>AmBisome</b><br>
One such formulation, Vestar's AmBisome, appears to work well with minimal toxicity and is approved for use in several European countries, including the UK, and in Latin America. According to Vestar, it even works in about 60% of the patients who have failed Amphotericin B. Vestar claims that the drug has been used by over 10,000 patients, including 300 PWAs for over two years, but in the US, not only is it unavailable, it hasn't even been in clinical trials.</p>

<p>Why don't we just import the drug here? Because its too damn expensive! Each 50 mg vial costs about $200. Standard therapy for CM requires up to 3 vials a day, for two weeks, (which could then be followed by six weeks of fluconazole, not cheap either, but at least insurance pays for it). This totals around $8,400 for the AmBisome alone, and although AmBisome takes only seven to fifteen days to sterilize the fungus, PWAs can easily become reinfected.</p>

<p>At this time, the only option seems to be getting it approved here in the US. Why hasn't Vestar done that? Because they sold the US license to another small bio-tech Lyphomed, in 1985.</p>

<p>In 1989, Lyphomed was bought by Fujisawa. Fujisawa performed some animal studies and got an IND for AmBisome from the FDA last year. Considering that the drug is approved abroad and has been used in a large number of patients, it shouldn't take much work for Fujisawa to get this drug approved. However, since obtaining their IND, they haven't done a thing. To make things worse, doctors who have begged them for compassionate use have been stonewalled.</p>

<p>What is Fujisawa's problem? They were apparently ready to go ahead with clinical trials to find the maximum tolerated dose last January (never performed by Vestar in Europe). They had all the drug they needed, and a complete protocol for the study. But then a new CEO shifted the company's resources towards getting approval for FK-506, an immune-suppressant like cyclosporine. AmBisome was put on the back burner.</p>

<p>Fujisawa spent a lot to buy Lyphomed, expecting to earn a huge sum on their PCP drug, pentamidine. Unfortunately for Fujisawa, when inexpensive Bactrim/Septra was shown to work better than pentamidine, yearly earning fell about $30 million or so short of what they had expected. In fact, they are almost bankrupt, but if they could get FK-506 approved quickly they would be back in financially safe waters (to the tune of $600-800 million a year).</p>

<p>But what about all the people whose lives might have been saved with AmBisome? Financial constraints might put off trials, but are no excuse not to allow compassionate use of this drug, which is just sitting on their warehouse shelves.</p>

<p>The company has consistently been feeding us lies. In September, Fujisawa reps said they wanted to have a meeting with the FDA by the end of the year to discuss development plans. But, then they admitted that this was "speculative" and that they hadn't even called the FDA to set up an appointment, or had any discussions about AmBisome with the FDA at all, for that matter. In October, they claimed that they were talking with the FDA and planned to start a study in Chicago and Baltimore as soon as November, and that large scale phase II studies comparing the drug with Amphotericin B would begin immediately afterward. But no study started in November. Since then, we've called them repeatedly, and they don't call back.</p>

<p>The CEO is Hatsuo Aoki. The other players at Fujisawa are Dr. Richard Hiles, (708) 317-1094, and Dr. Jim Allen (708) 317-1462. Give 'em hell.</p>

<p><b>Other Variations on Amphotericin B</b><br>
Two other "liposomal" formulations of Amphotericin B are in clinical trials. They may not be as effective as AmBisome, but they do seem to be less toxic than plain Amphotericin B. Neither drug is a true liposome.</p>

<p>The Liposome Company's Amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC) is approved in South Africa and currently in phase III clinical studies throughout the US. Rather than the fat bubble of a true liposome, this drug is more like a tiny ribbon of fat. This may limit how well the drug works, since in a phase II study comparing the drug to Amphotericin B, plain Ampho won out. Apparently, ribbons are not enough.</p>

<p>At least ABLC is available, free, through a compassionate use emergency protocol for patients who have failed are or are intolerant to traditional therapies. Doctors can enroll their patients by calling:</p>

<p><b>1 (800) 4 ABLC RX</b>, or <b>1 (800) 422-5279</b>.<br>
The third formulation is called Amphocil, owned by the Liposome Technology, Inc. Amphocil, approved in the UK, is only in phase II trials here. Despite the company's name, this drug is a horse of a different color and not a liposomal drug at all. It appears to work and be safe so far, but we've yet to see how it performs compared to Amphotericin B in PWAs.</p>

<p><b><a name="Acemannan">Acemannan</a></b><br>

by<i>Jason Heyman</i></p>

<p>Acemannan is a polysaccharide, or complex sugar, extracted from the aloe vera plant, Aloe barbardensis Miller. Aloe vera has been used in many cultures as a traditional treatment for burns, digestive problems, and other ailments, and has become a popular alternative treatment for AIDS. It is currently being promoted for use in combination with DNCB, dinitrochlorobenzene, another alternative treatment that has recently been receiving a new round of attention. Acemannan was patented by Carrington Laboratories under the brand name Carrisyn, and has been approved by FDA for the treatment of fibrosarcoma, a form of cancer, in cats and dogs.</p>

<p>Certain laboratory studies have shown that acemannan is capable of inhibiting HIV replication in the test tube, increasing the production of cytokines, and enhancing the efficacy of <a href="../../network/simple/zido.html">AZT</a>. Unfortunately, a recently concluded clinical trial could not reproduce these findings.</p>

<p>Results from two studies of acemannan were presented as poster abstracts at the IX International Conference on AIDS in Berlin. One abstract presented the long-awaited results of a placebo-controlled clinical trial of acemannan in combination with AZT or <a href="../../network/simple/dida.html">ddI</a>. The trial was conducted by the <a href="http://www.hivnet.ubc.ca/ctn.html">Canadian HIV Trials Network</a>, and funded by the Canadian government (abstract # PoB 28-2153).</p>

<p>This study enrolled sixty-two patients with t-helper counts between 50-300. The results showed that people taking acemannan declined more slowly than those not taking the drug, but by the end of the 48 week study, both groups had similar losses in t-helper cells. No difference was noted for p24 antigen, and no interaction with the antiretroviral drugs was observed.</p>

<p>In a different study, paid for by Carrington Laboratories, performed by researchers from Carrington Laboratories and Dallas-Fort Worth Medical Center, in Texas, followed the progress of the five survivors of a six year open-label clinical trial (abstract #PoB 29-2179). The t-helper counts of these five patients stayed constant over six years, while their CD8 cells increased from an average of 359 to an average of 1395. It is not specified whether these patients were receiving antiretroviral therapy.</p>

<p>Although their results seem contradictory to those of the larger Canadian trial, the researchers of the open-label study reported that acemannan increased the production of CD8 cells, and cytokines (immune regulators) including IL-6, and TNF-alpha (the same cytokines stimulated by echinacea---see following piece). Based on this information the authors suggest that acemannan increased survival time amongst these patients. According to the abstract, "the clinical deterioration of 10 deceased study patients closely paralleled their compliance for the daily intake of acemannan."</p>

<p>Self-selection in the open label study, as well the inevitable lack of objectivity on the part of the manufacturers of the product may explain the contradictory findings of these two studies.</p>

<p><b><a name="Aloe Vera">Aloe Vera:</a> The plot thickens . . . but does the concentrate?</b></p>

<p>[Ed. note: this piece by Stephen Korsia on the seemy underside of the aloe vera market is an abbreviated reprint from the December, 1991 issue of <i>I Heard It Through The Grapevine</i>, a newslettter from <a href="http://www.gus.com/care/apla/apla.html">AIDS Project LA</a>. We don't know whether all these suppliers still exist, but this might help you find the highest quality aloe vera, if you think its worth it.]</p>

<p>Many people with HIV are taking commercial aloe vera extracts as a way to access this promising therapy. A word of warning: the large bottles of "100%" aloe vera juice that one can buy in health food stores are nothing but water with a little aloe juice. Receiving a therapeutic amount of acemannan by drinking this type of preparation would require you to drink gallons and gallons a day. Presently, the only way to access a therapeutic amount of acemannan seems to be to get ahold of aloe juice concentrate, a thick brown soup with a tart taste. There are possibly three (as of 1994) companies in the game:</p>

<ul>
<li>CARRINGTON LABS, the only company to extract and commercialize acemannan (the compound being studied in the clinical studies and most test tube studies), and who also produces aloe juice concentrates for other retailers.

<li>Lametco, an Indiana-based (Ed. note, we think they may have moved to Colorado) that sells a cold- processed aloe concentrate.

<li>COSMETIC SPECIALTY LABS, based in Oklahoma, that commercializes a heat-pasteurized concentrate, and is run by Odus Hennessee, the author of Aloe, Myth- Magic- Medicine, Aloe Vera Across Time, a very thorough book about aloe.
</ul>

<p>Let's see what each of these companies has to offer.</p>

<p><b>Lametco</b> produces a cold- processed concentrate, extracted from aloe plants they buy from an outside contractor. Because they do not know how their aloe was grown, the amount of acemannan in their concentrate is likely to change from one batch to the next. One quart of the reconstituted juice (1 part of concentrate in 10 parts water) is supposed to contain an average of 270 mg of Acemannan (30 mg of other solid, potentially active substances).</p>

<p><b>Cosmetic Specialty Labs</b> offers a heat- pasteurized concentrate. They claim that heat- processing not only does not affect the active substances in the juice, but also decreases the laxative effects of aloe juice. They get their aloe from their own farm, where it is grown under constant conditions, thus allowing a better regularity in the composition of their products. Juice is partially freeze- dried to obtain the concentrate. One quart of the reconstituted juice is supposed to contain 450 mg of acemannan (50 mg other solid substances).</p>

<p><b>Carrington Labs</b> makes CARRISYN tm which contains 85- 95% acemannan, available in injectable and oral forms. CARRISYN tm is not available for human treatment. However, it was approved recently by the FDA for use in the treatment of fibrosarcoma (a type of cancer) in cats and dogs. At this time, CARRISYN tm should be available to veterinarians through their drug retailers. Maybe it is time for your dog to have fibrosarcoma? We still have no idea of the price. Some have suggested that a full-dose treatment in humans would cost up to $500 a month. Carrington Labs 1 (800) 255-4223, also provides aloe concentrate to a retailer named De Veras in Texas (214- 823- 4659). Their concentrate seems to be somewhat weaker than the two other ones.</p>

<p>There are still major questions regarding the quality of these products. Of particular interest is the fact that acemannan is a mixture of molecules with varied sizes (a mix of polymers, for you scientific minds!). It has been suggested that only the largest molecules (MW 12,000, for you inquiring brains!) are effective. Now, how much of the acemannan present in these concentrates is that large? In the case of CARRISYN tm, how effective is acemannan without the hundreds of substances present in concentrated juice? Aloe contains at least six other anti-infectious substances and one anti-inflammatory agent. Are they enhancing the effectiveness of acemannan? [We also should add that other sources say that these other substances may actually render acemannan inactive] So many questions, so little straight answers!</p>

<p><b><a name="Echinacea">Echinacea</a>: My Immune Booster May Be Your Downer</b></p>

<p>Extracts from echinacea, that purple coneflower blooming in your garden, have been used by herbalists since pagan times, and seem to be becoming more and more popular in the back-to-Mother- Earth-'90's. A lot of laboratory work supports what the nature healer-types have contended all along; that echinacea can kick start the immune system into combating infections and maybe even cancerous cells. So echinacea may deserve the tag "immunomodulator", and because of its reputation, a lot of people with HIV use it to try and give their immune system a boost.</p>

<p>Which would be great if the immune system was a simple sort of thing that turns on or off. But its more like a maze of interlaced wires and switches, with hidden feedback loops and all the instructions are in hieroglyphics. Or to use a more natural metaphor, the immune system is like the ecosystem, in which the disappearance of some tiny fish leads to global starvation.</p>

<p>HIV disease uses the complexity of the immune system to defeat it. HIV triggers responses from some parts of the immune system that would normally keep other infections in check, but that wind up only feeding HIV and gradually disturbing the natural balance of all the elements of the immune system. By the time someone has fifty CD4 cells, its not that the immune system is "deficient" so much as it is all out of whack. Any product that claims to be an immune booster should be looked at very carefully to be sure that it isn't just aggravating this imbalance.</p>

<p>So where does echinacea fit into this? Hard to say, since these extracts appear to do a number of different things. Echinacea has been shown to activate cells called macrophages that eat diseased cells or infectious things like bacterias or viruses. Macrophages are very important when it comes to fighting off certain infections such as MAI. In this process the macrophages produce large amounts of chemicals such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. These chemicals stimulate HIV, and a number of other conditions such as <a href="../../network/simple/ks.html">KS</a> and wasting. What's worse is that if macrophages clean up cells infected with HIV, they can become infected themselves and act as reservoirs for the virus. There are no studies of whether echinacea causes more of your macrophages to get infected. But there are studies showing that taking echinacea increases levels of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in sero-negative people.</p>

<p>On paper this seems like a catch-22. In your body, who knows, it may depend on your stage of disease. Echinacea might help you in one stage, and hurt you in another. It's very hard to get a grasp of the big picture by piecing together these small test tube studies. There are no studies of echinacea in PWAs. It sounds sort of hollow to always this repeat demand for clinical trials, since they take so much time and money to design and implement and there are just so many things to study. Where does that leave you now? Once again with a lot of decisions to make and little more than your good sense to guide you.</p>

By <i>Sally Cooper, Executive Director</i></p>

<p><b>Law and Order</b><br>
You've probably heard that the FDA has proposed new labeling regulations for dietary supplements and has proposed proposing regulations concerning the quality, quantity and proven usefulness of dietary supplements. The labeling rules will go into effect after a period of public comment, which ends December 15th or so.</p>

<p>Health food stores have been plastered with posters announcing the end of life as we know it: no more vitamins or herbal remedies, the FDA is about to snatch it all. AIDS activists have been organizing with a variety of community groups and holistic practitioners to protect PWA access to supplements, especially mega-vitamins and amino acids such as NAC. In fact, it's not at all clear how these FDA regulations will affect anything, particularly given two opposing bills before Congress.</p>

<p>In a series of community meetings, the FDA has claimed: that nothing they are proposing will affect access, that they won't interfere with the practice of holistic medicine, and that they'll use a far less stringent standard to measure the clinical efficacy of dietary supplements, such as accepting foreign studies and not always requiring clinical trials.</p>

<p>Mandated by Congress to regulate food and drugs, the FDA requires drugs to be tested before they're sold (clinical trials, the works) food to be tested after it's sold if there's a problem (botulism, etc.) Everything else, like vitamins, weight gain products or herbal remedies, has generally been avoided by the FDA unless they hear complaints. Then in periodic rumbles of enforcement, complete with rifles drawn, they aim first for distributors and then for health food stores, and clear off the shelves. The result? Plenty of distrust, no communication and lots of kindling for conspiracy fires. In turn, the health food industry, in various incarnations small and gigantic, (over $2 billion last year) has made as much money off conspiracy theories as the Jo
hn Birch Society, and neither seems to have added much to our general health.</p>

<p><b>Something is awry here.</b><br>
For one thing, the right wing seems to flutter through the health food industry with appalling regularity. For example, the proposed reg's have brought about the unholy alliance of Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah (a bloody tory) and AIDS activists worried about losing access to supplements. Many activists are supporting Hatch's Senate bill which would sharply limit the FDA's ability to regulate dietary supplements. Yet the most controversial FDA proposals challenged by Hatch come from the Dykstra Report, p
ulled together by FDA staff closely allied with some sort of right wing save-the-AMA group that has been lobbying against the health food industry for some time now. As if six years of rampant profiteering by drug companies wasn't enough, PWAs seem to be caught in the middle of another right-wing dogfight, reflecting opposing market interests.</p>

<p>For another thing, it is obvious that the complete lack of an nfrastructure by which the FDA and holistic practitioners and health food suppliers can communicate with each other completely fuels conspiracy fires and leaves consumers as ill-informed as ever. The FDA is left feeling their only recourse when they hear of problems is to just clean off the shelves. Holistic practitioners feel unfairly singled out and mistrusted. The real winners are the corporations that market and promote alternative therapies, who remain beholden to no one, and not obligated to prove either the efficacy or content of their products. The real losers are all of us, struggling to find out what might work and not, what the real side effects might be and paying through the nose for whatever we try. I'm still waiting for a nonprofit vitamin company.</p>

<p><b>Eat Drink and Be Merry</b><br>
To regulate dietary supplements, the FDA needs to decide whether the vitamin C you take (whether by orange or iv drip) is a food or drug. Their solution has been very scientific: "the context of an ordinary daily diet."</p>

<p>Simply put, if you pop some vitamin C pills equal to the vitamin C that an ordinary American of un-named class, racial and cultural background consumes on an ordinary day, then the vitamin C you pop is a food, and can be sold without being pre-tested for safety and efficacy. If your pills add up to more than an ordinary daily diet, your vitamin C should perhaps be tested like drugs. Perhaps, because the FDA operates by selective enforcement, and popular remedies, such as vitamin C would not be politica
lly, I mean scientifically, feasible to take off the market.</p>

<p>So how does the FDA plan to distinguish between the roasted garlic in my turkey stuffing and my garlic pills? According to the Federal Register: the first has aromatic value, the second is therapeutic. Food and drug. Got it? Why do I keep thinking about Reagan declaring ketchup a vegetable?</p>

<p>Now what about prepared foods that have added vitamins? Not to worry. The proposed reg's completely let off the hook huge American food corporations that have learned to sell more boxes of Trix by adding a few pennies worth of vitamins. The Federal Register says that vitamin fortified cereals are still just cereals. Phew! No clinical trials or long term toxicity trials there. (If we really run into problems with these reg's, maybe we'll offer NAC-enhanced Wheaties.)</p>

<p>So a little splash of sugar coated vitamins and the FDA won't check. What happens when the FDA knows that fortified foods are improperly fortified? Apparently nothing, if you look at milk, which is routinely fortified with vitamin D to help kids fight rickets. Two years ago, studies indicated that 60% of the milk tested had variable amounts of vitamin D. Last month a study showed that 80% of samples were off, some dangerously so: one sample of chocolate milk had 914% of the vitamin D of its label claim
. Vitamin D overdoses are quite serious. What's going on here? Isn't protecting the public health the job of the FDA?</p>

<p>The FDA is always an easy target and separating the drug from the aromatic value of an herb is going to be difficult for anyone. My point is that it's easy to agree that some regulation (and research!!) is reasonable and long overdue, but difficult to agree that the FDA with such a long history of biased and irregular enforcement practices should be the ones to do it.</p>

<p>And whatever happened to the "well-informed consumer" that the FDA always claims to be the best protection for American health? It's upsetting that no one, activists, holistic practitioners, FDA staff or Congress representatives are working on improving what everyone off the record agrees is not a good system. The activists seem to feel backed in a corner by the FDA, and end up defending a grossly negligent, greedy health food industry that seems reluctant to spend a penny on research or education. The FDA claims their hands are tied by their Congressional mandate, and fail to do anything pro-active, such as organizing a research and clinical practice infrastructure that could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship between consumers and the FDA. Most Americans self-medicate with a wide variety of substances and right now, the FDA offers them nothing. Getting rid of a way to force accountability on health food corporate giants, as the Hatch bill promises to do, doesn't appear to offer us anything either. Whatever happened to intelligent planning? Whatever happened to health? Maybe the Clintons are right, and it's just a matte
r of better shopping. Happy holidays.</p>

<p><b><a name="Pep-Si!"> Pep-Si!</a></b><br>
by  <i> Wayne Kawadler</i></p>

<p>Ed.'s note: As soon as the our deputy director, Wayne Kawadler charmed his way out of that Mexican prison, he promptly started working on expanding the availability of <a href="../info/pept.html">Peptide T</a>. On October 28th, Wayne and Anna Blume, a longtime Peptide T community treatment activist and pediatric researcher, met with representatives of our former supplier, Peptech, Inc. Peptech sent Dick Doyle, their American lawyer and the person in charge of marketing, sales, etc. of Peptide T in the 
US, Karin Garre, MD, who organizes clinical trials for Peptech throughout the world, and Paul Aliferis, hired to be their community liaison and to improve Peptech's name in the US.</p>

<p>To remind you where things stand, Peptech Inc. supplied the underground with Peptide T for the past 18 months, until March of 1993 when they unceremoniously and unilaterally cut us off. Although Mr. Doyle mentioned several times that he wanted to straighten out any misperceptions the community may have about Peptech and negotiations they had previously with the FDA, we never really got an answer as to why Peptech cut off PWA's access to Peptide T without notice. They also didn't say why they had completely failed to run trials in the past three years as required by their license. But let's not get stuck on the past, lest we become paralyzed with rage. We need to focus on the future.</p>

<p>The overall goal of the PWA Health Group is to make an intranasal version of this drug available to anyone who wants it. All current data points to the use of an intranasal version as the best form for absorption and as the most accessible for most people. We would like the FDA to approve an intranasal formulation of the drug so that private and public health insurance will pay for it. To speed the approval process, we may need to help companies get the type of clean data that the FDA requires. To get 
this drug approved, we'll work with anyone willing develop the drug.</p>

<p>Peptech is opting for their clinical trials to use a intramuscular (skin popping or subQ) version of this drug. No data exists to suggest that this method of delivery is more efficacious. To ask people who are taking a drug with no proven clinical efficacy to stick themselves with a needle once a day, with no research to show that that method of delivery is more efficacious, seems to be a tad on the cruel side.</p>

<p>So we met with Peptech, and in keeping with the PWA Health Group policy of full disclosure to our clients, the following is a wrap-up of the discussion we had, followed by our research into the facts:</p>

<p>Doyle opened the meeting by announcing to Anna Blume that they will agree to supply drug for the pediatric clinical trial in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Doyle then announced that the goal of Peptech is to try and achieve fast approval by the FDA of Peptide T. To do that Peptech will concentrate on getting approval for the subQ drug, 8.5 mg once a day. Only after securing approval for the subQ formulation, would Peptech try to formulate an intranasal version for later approval. They believe that subQ Peptide T is brought into the blood faster and is more efficiently absorbed. They also said that clinical trials of subQ would be more expediently approved by FDA. Finally, Mr. Doyle claimed this is the formulation for Peptide T that they currently had "on the shelf and ready to go."</p>

<p><b>Fact</b>: There is no data to support that the subQ version of Peptide T is absorbed any more efficiently in the body. In fact, it has never been substantiated that a once-a-day subQ dose provides sufficient and constant blood levels. One of the problems with Peptide T is getting sufficient levels in the blood over time, and that is why the intranasal version is used three times a day. The largest study of Peptide T and the majority of clinical trials in this country were done with the intranasal formulation and furthermore, from our checking with FDA and NIMH, no government body has at any time objected to doing future clinical trials with the intranasal version. In regards to Doyle's claim that Peptech only has the subQ formulation on the shelf, — well, where do they think we got the intranasal form from? For over one year, the intranasal formulation was exactly what the Carlbiotech (the European division of Peptech) sold us. All we had to do was add saline solution and — tah-dah — we had the intranasal version. Call us, we'll give you the recipe.</p>

<p><b>Doyle</b>: Peptech believes they must reinvent the wheel as it were, and do animal preclinical studies. They are not repeating preclinical phase I data, but they believe they need to do more animal data. These preclinical animal studies will be done in parallel with the clinical trials.</p>

<p><b>Health Group</b>: Cool! If they can get animal clinical data in conjunction with clinical data in people, and that gives the FDA more reason to approve Peptide T, then mazeltov. But guys, figure out a way to get the nasal spray nozzles up those rat's noses.</p>

<p><b>Doyle</b>: Clinical trials using the subQ form of peptide T will start shortly and be international in scope. A phase II trial with two hundred patients at three sites in Germany will test for broad neuropsych symptomology. This study will complete enrolling in mid 1994 and will be finished by the end of 1994. An ongoing open label trial in Canada will continue through Reed McFadden and will enroll 20 patients on a continuing basis. In this country, Peptech will be able to collect data from the ongo
ing USC trial (enrollment is currently filled). Also, Peptech has immediate plans for an emergency compassionate use program in this country. They plan to supply subQ drug for 50 patients in NY, Philadelphia and Baltimore beginning in December '93. This will be a cost recovery program administered by one doctor in each of these cities. This program has been approved by David Feigel, Director of Antiviral Research at FDA.</p>

<p><b>Fact</b>: David Fiegel claims to have never approved a cost recovery compassionate use program for this drug. In fact, after much calling to different offices at the FDA and NIMH, nobody has heard anything about this cost recovery program. What is going on? And if there is an expanded access program, why couldn't Doyle tell us how you could get on it? We have no idea how to get in this program. Call 'em at (215) 245-1616.</p>

<p><b>Doyle</b>: Peptech hopes to write and administer a larger cost recovery expanded access program for this country, again with the subQ version. The protocol is still unwritten and Peptech has no idea how to go about this. They want to work with (co-opt?) the community to help with this expanded access program. Hopefully this protocol will begin in the spring of '94.</p>

<p><b>Fact</b>: We hope it happens, but with an intranasal version of the drug.</p>

<p>Lest you think we are crabby negative people, the meeting was hopeful. It was nice to see a company with a timetable try and get approval for this drug. If all goes according to their plans, by mid '95 they should have all the data they need for approval. By early 94, they want their expanded access program to be up and running. We will see about these dates. They seem slightly optimistic. At the same time, the other company with a co-license to develop this drug, Advanced Peptides, has announced plans to continue trying to develop Peptide T. Although results from their recently completed trial were not so good (see attached box), they have decided to stay in the game.</p>

<p>What now, you may be asking. Well, the Health Group will continue to supply the drug. We have found a supplier with a cheaper version than the last shipment. Hopefully that will be on our shelves sometime in January. Keep in touch. </p>

<p><b><a name="Peptide Blues">Peptide Blues...</a></b><br>
The results from the phase II study of Peptide T for painful peripheral neuropathies are in and boy do they suck. The trial compared 6 mg a day of Peptide T to a placebo in 81 patients with severe pain. The researchers used a number of methods to detect whether Peptide T had any effect on pain. They also looked for changes in the patient's neuro/psych conditions, and CD4 cell counts. In the end, there was no difference between Peptide T and placebo.</p>

<p>Does this mean Peptide T doesn't work for neuropathy? With results this bad, people either declare a product dead or come up with excuses. We don't want to be guilty of spin control, for all we know Peptide T is just a placebo, but we've seen people jump to false conclusions far too often. Part of reason for this is that researchers don't really ask the right questions in a trial.</p>

<p>What was the premise for this study? If the idea was that Peptide T was some form of pain killer, then the results are clear. It simply isn't. If instead, Peptide T alleviates pain by preventing the nerve destruction caused by HIV or its protein gp120, we still don't know. At some point, nerve damage may become irreversible and nothing can be done about it. The patients in this study may have reached that point since they had severe pain, and were in the late stage of disease.</p>

<p>Would these patients have responded to earlier treatment with Peptide T? We have no idea. The study didn't ask that question. We don't mean that its likely; (at present, there is no data to suggest that it works for anything). We just won't know without more research. Advanced Peptides promises to continue looking for some use for this drug. We sure hope its a valid one.</p>

<p>What these results do mean is that the FDA has decided to refuse to consider an expanded access program, which also sucks. However, if you took part in this study, you can get free Peptide T for the rest of your life, if you want. To get the drug that they owe you, call Jerry Tarantino at (412) 741-0983.</p>

<p><b><a name="But You Are What You Eat, Blanche">But You Are What You Eat, Blanche</a></b></p>

<p><b>Ed. note</b>: Nutrition is a vast and controversial topic with few clear answers for PWAs, but more and more data suggests it may be vital to staying healthy. In light of this, many AIDS service organizations have added nutritional counseling. PWAs have many different nutrition and absorption problems, so its smart to speak to a nutritionist about what's happening in your body. In the meantime, health food stores and pharmaceutical companies market a number of nutritional products they claim will he
lp you put weight on, and boost your immune system. We have no idea whether the pharmaceutical products are any better than what you could buy in a health food store, but since the AIDS Drug Assistance Program in New York recently agreed to pay for the pharmaceutical nutritional products, we thought we'd try to review some of them.</p>

<p>One of the strange things about HIV disease is that people start to become malnourished almost as soon as they get infected, high T cells and all. Often, this isn't addressed until people have already lost a lot of weight, or can no longer eat. By that time, even though tube feeding and intravenous feeding (TPN) may help, its very hard to gain back that lost weight, or to erase the damage that malnutrition has wreaked upon your health. But evidence is mounting that it may be possible to do something ab
out malnutrition before it becomes too severe.</p>

<p>It is fairly well established that malnourished people with HIV get sick and die faster. From early on, HIV infection changes the body's metabolism, so energy and nutrients are burned up much faster than usual. As the disease progresses, this condition grows worse, especially with opportunistic infections. These infections and the drugs used to treat them may cause nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhea and an inability to absorb food. HIV itself may trigger these symptoms. Another major problem is that malnutrition can reach a point where it becomes self-perpetuating and ever worse. All of these factors conspire together to cause weight loss and wasting.</p>

<p>It makes sense to try to boost your nutrition as soon as you know you are infected, yet there is no one sure way to keep up the weight. Pamphlets always say that you should "start to eat right" immediately, but what exactly eating right is depends about as much on culturally biased tradition as science.</p>

<p>The government says your diet should contain the recommended daily allowances (RDAs) of vitamins and minerals, etc., but the RDAs are little more than arbitrary conclusions reached by a consensus of academic types in the nutrition field. Depending on your lifestyle, it may be harder to reach these recommendations by eating than you might think. Who always has the time to steam their fresh vegetables? That's why there is so much money in the vitamin industry. But you don't simply need vitamins, you need
 protein, carbohydrates and, yes, even a certain amount of fat to get a balanced diet, and sorry, but One-A-Day just doesn't cut it.</p>

<p><b>Super Drinks To The Rescue</b><br>
Health food stores have long been selling diet powders and muscle building milkshakes for would be muscle boys and gals. In recent years they've expanded to selling nutritional drinks or powders for all kinds of conditions. Smelling a profit, half a dozen pharmaceutical companies realized that they could cash in on their "scientific reputations" and sell similar products. We're not talking iv food, or anything force-fed by your nurse. We mean milk free super shakes that are high calorie, high protein, low fat, and filled to overflowing with vitamins and minerals. We mean powders you can sprinkle on your linguini to add protein, calories, or "free" amino acids. Astronaut food really.</p>

<p>By modifying these super drinks slightly, pharmaceutical companies have come up with special formulas for any type of patient you can think of. Broken a leg lately? There are super drinks specifically designed to help mend your bones. You name it. And there are products they say boost immune function, or help patients who don't absorb food, or absorb fat well.</p>

<p>Its impossible to say if all these products do what they say they do, (especially when it comes to boosting the immune system) and it's unclear which super drink works best for PWAs. Taking a page from the health food industry, these companies apparently know that expensive clinical trials aren't necessary for an effective marketing campaign. Still, there is some data to suggest that at least some of these products can help you gain weight and improve your health.</p>

<p>What's cool about these products is that you don't need a prescription to buy them. You can just go down to the local drug store and buy them right off the shelf. If they don't stock what you're looking for, ask.</p>

<p>If you want to get reimbursed by Medicaid, you need to get a prescription from you doctor. Since early intervention with these treatments is not yet the standard of care, it is often hard to get reimbursed. Insurance rarely pays for them. But its good to ask, since cans of this stuff can start to add up.</p>

<p>If you can afford it, there is nothing to stop you from using these super drinks and powders as soon as you test positive, whether you have a high CD4 cell count or not. However, it is still an act of faith to use nutritional supplements to improve your immune status, or increase your life span. The same can be said for almost any of the therapeutic options for PWAs. But using nutritional supplements right after becoming positive seems at least as valid as swallowing AZT and ddC. It's certainly safer.</p>

<p>The following is a brief list of some of the products from drug companies that are available. We've categorized them as nutrient drinks, elemental powders or immune modulators, but there's a lot of overlap.</p>

<p><b>The Nutrient Drinks</b><br>
Most of the nutritional drinks come in a number of different flavors which, according to the makers are "delicious," and if you don't like them, you can add sugar and spice and slices of kiwi (recipes included). Some still taste like plastic. A number are soy-based, similar to drinks you might get at any health food store. Most are lactose free (lactose is that enzyme in milk products that many people can't digest). The supplements are quite high in protein, vitamins and minerals, and two to three cups worth usually provide what the feds consider minimum daily vitamin requirements. Most of them have formulas with more fiber or high nitrogen (for bulking up). They differ in their source of protein, and the protein/fat/carbohydrates ratios.</p>

<p>Perhaps, the best known is <b>Ensure</b> from Ross Labs, a subsidiary of Abbott. It comes in a number flavors. <b>Sustacal</b> has slightly more protein but may not be as good in patients with diarrhea. <b>Citrisource</b> tastes kind of like TANG, and is high in protein and carbohydrates, but fat free. <b>Citrotein</b> is a similar product with some fat, which you need to digest fat soluble vitamins like beta carotene. <b>Meritene</b> is a powder that is mixed with milk, not a good idea for anyone who is lactose intolerant. Other standard products include Nutren, Replete, Isocal, and Resource.</p>

<p>If you have diarrhea and are losing weight because you can't absorb fat well, you might consider Lipisorb or Isosource. Lipisorb's nutritional profile is average, but the product's fat source is almost entirely made up of easily absorbed simple fats. This doesn't seem to effect the taste, which isn't too bad. But, beware if your diarrhea gets worse, there is some data to suggest that for some patients, all the simple fat might be a little too much of a good thing. Another product, Isosource has a fat content only half these simple fats; the rest is Canola oil (considered by all those "experts" to be one of the most healthy vegetable oils available).</p>

<p><b>The Elemental Powders</b><br>
If you become malnourished because you have gastrointestinal problems and your body has a tough time absorbing protein and nutrients, there are supplements that supply protein broken down into simple amino acids that are much easier for you to digest. These products are called elementals. Some are protein, or calorie powders, some flavored, some not, that can be sprinkled on your food. Others supply complete nutrition. They are high in carbohydrates with little or no fat.</p>

<p>Ross Labs produces Polycose Glucose Polymers, which sounds inedible, but adds calories to your diet, and Promod, which adds protein. Sandoz's Vivonex T.E.N. is a free amino acid high nitrogen complete diet that comes in five flavors including cherry-vanilla and raspberry but according to our taste testers still tastes awful. A similar product called Opti tastes much better. Vital HN is another competing product, but we've had no reports on its taste.</p>

<p><b>Immuno-modulators</b><br>
Some of the elemental products are marketed as immuno-modulators, sometimes for patients recovering from surgery, sometimes for people with immune disorders. Some make this claim solely on the basis that they contain higher than usual arginine and/or glutamine, amino acids that, like a lot of other things, play a role in the immune system. So does <a href="../../network/simple/iltwo.html">Il-2</a>, but that doesn't mean drinking it in a shake will do diddly squat. The only product with any data in PWAs
 is Advera, which has no added arginine or glutamine.</p>

<p>One product, ImmunAid, says it all right up front. It is a nutritional complete, and high nitrogen product added arginine or glutamine that might be good for patients with gastrointestinal problems, but there is no data to support the claim inherent in
 the name.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sandoz's Impact drink not only comes enriched with arginine and glutamine, its got RNA! What difference does that make? Damned if we know. When compared to a regular nutrient drink in a study of 85 patients who were undergoing surgery for gastrointestinal cancer, Impact reduced opportunistic infections by 70% and shaved a fifth off the the time these patients were hospitalized. But we don't know if it does this for PWAs.</p>

<p>Ross Lab's makes a powder called AlitraQ. Its a lot like Vital HN, but with the added arginine and glutamine. This one is currently being studied in PWAs.</p>

<p>Ross Labs has recently introduced Advera, specifically designed for patients with HIV disease. Its made with an elemental soy protein source that animal data suggests might increase the number of cells in the GI track and reduce malabsorption. Ross also boosted the drink's content of beta carotene, vitamins E, C, B6, B12, folic acid, iron, zinc, and selenium. These vitamins and minerals may be critical for people with HIV.</p>

<p>In numerous studies in people with HIV, Advera did consistently better than Ensure. In one six month study, patients who used Advera gained an average of four pounds, didn't lose lean muscle, and went to the hospital less than those on Ensure. Patients on Ensure lost lean muscle and an average of 1.5 pounds. In a very small study (23 patients), Advera improved CD4/8 ratios and did a better job maintain-ing CD4 and CD8 cell counts when compared to Ensure HN.</p>

<p>Advera better be good enough to justify a price two times that of Ensure. Advera costs around $3.00 a can. If you drink three a day that's about nine bucks, and $3,300 a year out of your pocket. But, if you tell your doctor that you can't afford Advera, he or she can call (800) 544-7495, and Ross will either send you coupons or free Advera, depending on how financially strapped you are.</p>

<p>Ross's marketing campaign tries to persuade you to start taking Advera as soon as you know you are infected. In theory, this makes some sense since malnutrition is a cumulative thing. Taking some product early enough might postpone or prevent weight loss. Might. And malnutrition may play a significant role in the failure of people's immune systems; so nutritional therapy may prove to be immune therapy. But it would be a good thing to know this for a fact.</p>

<p>The nutritional companies only give us the most paltry data, if any. For example, the nutritional companies never compare their specialized products with each other (like Advera vs. Lipisorb). Instead, each company runs studies against their own standard products. What's happened to America's competitive spirit? And is the same product right for the entire course of the disease? We need large long-term studies of Advera and its like.</p>

<p>We don't mean you should wait until some five year study says its good to use nutritional supplements. But if there was such data, more doctors would prescribe these products, and more patients, who can't afford them, wouldn't be forced to wait till they're severely malnourished to take them. </p>

<H2>Bactrim Desensitization vs. Rechallenge Study</H2>

<P>The purpose of this study is to see whether people who have had problems taking <A HREF="../network/access/drugs/tmp.html">Bactrim</A> (also called TMP-SMX or Septra) can be safely and effectively placed on Bactrim daily at half the original dose.  This study will look at two ways of doing this:
<OL>
<LI> Building up slowly to a single-strength dose over 6-12 days with increasing amounts of daily liquid Bactrim (dose escalation), OR</LI>
<LI> Starting to take a single-strength Bactrim pill right away (rechallenge).</LI></OL>
During this desensitization period, people in the study will also take an antihistamine to protect them from a reaction.  If you were to enter this trial, you would have an equal chance of being desensitized or rechallenged.  After the desensitization period, you would take a single-strength Bactrim dose for six months.</P>

<P><B>AM I ELIGIBLE FOR THIS STUDY?</B><BR>
If you  . . .
<UL>
<LI>are HIV+</LI>
<LI>are recommended for PCP prophylaxis -- either taking medication to prevent PCP or should be on medication to prevent PCP</LI>
<LI>have had a <EM>mild</EM> reaction to Bactrim (rash or fever)</LI></UL>
. . .then you may be eligible for this study.<BR><BR>
If you have had a more serious reaction to Bactrim before, you will not be allowed to enter this study.</P>

<P><B>WHAT IS <A HREF="../network/simple/pcp.html">PCP</A>?</B><BR>
People who are infected with HIV are at risk for many infections that other people usually do not get.  PCP (Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia), an infection of the lungs, is the disease that often makes people with HIV sick. Eight out of ten people with HIV infection are likely to get PCP if they do not take medication to prevent it.  As the number of CD4 cells (or T-cells) goes down, a person's risk for getting sick with PCP goes up.  People who get PCP often require hospitalization for several days or weeks. PCP can cause permanent lung damage and death.</P>

<P><B>WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO TRY TO TAKE BACTRIM?</B><BR>
Since PCP can make people very sick and even kill them, it is important to take medicine to prevent it.  Trimethoprin-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), commonly known as Bactrim or Septra, is the best drug for preventing PCP.  Very few people who take Bactrim as prescribed get PCP.  Bactrim also prevents Toxoplasmosis and may prevent a variety of bacterial infections.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, many people with HIV have reactions to Bactrim like a rash, fever, flu-like symptoms or upset stomach. There are other drugs available to prevent PCP (dapsone, pentamidine, or mepron).  You may be taking one of these now, but none of them does as good a job at preventing PCP as Bactrim.  More people who take these drugs will get PCP than those who take Bactrim.  Also, the other drugs probably do not prevent Toxoplasmosis or bacterial infections.</P>

<P><B>WHY SHOULD I CONSIDER TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?</B><BR>
You have had a reaction to Bactrim before and it has not been life-threatening.  Your health care provider hopes that by taking part in this trial you will be able to tolerate Bactrim and avoid becoming sick with PCP.  Even if you are not able to tolerate Bactrim through this study, your participation will provide information about when and how Bactrim can be tolerated.</P>

<P><B>WHAT ELSE SHOULD I CONSIDER BEFORE JOINING THIS STUDY?</B><BR>
You may have concerns about this drug because of previous reactions, but studies show that people who have had a reaction to Bactrim before are often able to handle the drug well after desensitization or after rechallenge. Just because you have had a reaction to Bactrim before, you are not more likely than other HIV infected patients to have a reaction again. If you decide to participate in this study, your health care providers and research staff will monitor you closely to make sure you does not have any dangerous reactions.  They will also encourage you to stay on the Bactrim and treat any reaction you may have.  It is very important that you take the study drug as prescribed.  If not, it is possible to have a more severe reaction.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Are You Looking for a New Combination Therapy?</B></H3>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Hydroxyurea + ddI</H2>

<FONT SIZE=-1><P ALIGN=CENTER><I>A Phase I/II Open-Label Study of the Safety and<BR>
Antiretroviral Activity of Hydroxyurea with ddI</I></P>

<P><B>WHAT IS HYDROXYUREA?</B><BR>
<a href="http://www.noah.cuny.edu/illness/aids/gmhc/gmhi0909.html#New Data Intensifies Interest in Hydroxyurea">Hydroxyurea</a> has been used for many years in the treatment of other illnesses.  It also seems to help <a href="../network/simple/dida.html">ddI</a> work better against HIV.</P>

<P><B>WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE AND HOW DOES IT WORK?</B><BR>
This study will look at the antiretroviral effects and safety of hydroxyurea taken in combination with ddI, in people who have not used ddI in the past.  It will include measuring HIV virus levels (viral load), CD4 counts, other lab tests, and the effects of the treatment on people's life and health.  Two ways of using these drugs in combination will be studied:
<UL>
<LI>Starting ddI and Hydroxyurea at the same time and taking them together for 24 weeks, OR
<LI>Taking ddI alone for 12 weeks and then adding hydroxyurea to ddI for the next 12 weeks.
</UL>
Every person in this study will have an equal chance of being in one of these two groups.</P>

<P><B>WHO CAN JOIN THIS STUDY?</B><BR>
To be in this study, you must be HIV-positive, with a CD4 cell count between 50-600.  You must have a viral load level greater than 10,000 (a bDNA test will be done before you start the study).  Other lab tests will also be done to see if you qualify. You can not have taken ddI for more than 6 days total in the past, or have taken ddC or 3TC. You must be willing to stop taking AZT and/or d4T when you start the study.  You can not have gotten a vaccine within the 45 days before the study starts, or be taking ganciclovir or foscarnet.  You can not be pregnant or breastfeeding during this study.</P>

<P><B>WHY SHOULD I TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?</B><BR>
The effects of taking hydroxyurea and ddI will be closely watched by your doctor. This will include physical exams, viral load tests, other blood tests, and questions about how the treatment affects your life and health.  You will also help researchers answer an important question about how hydroxyurea works with ddI in people's bodies to slow the production of HIV.</P>

<P><B>WHAT ELSE SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT THIS STUDY?</B><BR>
Hydroxyurea and ddI, like any drug you take, may cause side effects in your body.  You should talk about these with your provider and research staff.  If you decide to be in this study, you will have regular study visits at the health center at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20, and 24.  The study will last 24 weeks.  The ddI and hydroxyurea and the lab tests will be paid for by the study.  Transportation for study visits can be arranged, if needed.</P>

<H2>Clinical Research Participant <BR>Rights and Responsibilities</H2>

<P>Your health is the main priority and the purpose of CDN's clinical trials research.  If you choose to participate in a study, you have certain rights and responsibilities.</P>

<FONT SIZE=-1><B>PATIENT RIGHTS</B>
<P>The people involved with your care must treat you with respect and consideration.  You have the right to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>be informed about all the important details about your care and the study
<LI>refuse any test, procedure or medication
<LI>go over your medical records with your health care provider 
<LI>make your own decisions about your health care
</UL>

<P>For many studies, medical visits, labs, medication and transportation for your treatment choice are offered at no cost to you.  You can find out exactly what is paid for by the researchers who are working with you. This information should also be included in the Informed Consent which you will sign before entering the study.</P>

<B>PATIENT RESPONSIBILITIES</B>
<P>The researchers will expect certain things from you.  If you participate in a study you have the following responsibilities:</P>
<UL>
<LI>attend all the required study visits; if you're unable to attend, re-schedule your appointment at least 24 hours in advance
<LI>follow the instructions about the study medication and let your nurse or doctor know if you cannot or did not take your medication
<LI>stay in touch with the study contact person so data can continue to be collected, if you decide to get care elsewhere
</UL>

<B>CONFIDENTIALITY</B>
<P>All research records are kept without patient names.  Each patient is given a Patient Identification Number (PID) and the records are maintained using the PID only. We may need to request your medical records if you see another doctor or have a hospitalization so you will be asked to sign an authorization to release medical records to the research staff at your health center.</P></font>

<p><b><a name="conflict">Conflict</a> Resolution: An Emerging Landscape</b><br>
<i>By Maria R. Volpe, Ph.D.</i></p>

<p><b>Moving Toward a New Conflict Resolution Culture</b><br>
How is a new conflict resolution culture created? Through lots of hard work. It requires a multi faceted approach, with good modeling occurring at many different levels. Rather than tolerating an environment and processes that pit individuals against each other, structures, policies, procedures, and support would be in place for approaches that favor finding common ground. In general, a culture of resolving conflicts constructively encourages a proactive, preventative approach to conflict. Individuals are encouraged to think of non-violent, constructive ways to handle their conflicts and work through their differences rather than resorting to destructive confrontation and even 'violence.' </p>

<img src="../gifs/volpe.gif" alt="photo" align=left hspace=5 vspace=5><p>Emerging studies and anecdotal reports from those who have been exposed to conflict resolution skills report that they think differently about how they handle conflicts. Many report that they are managing conflicts arising at home, in their neighborhoods, with friends, colleagues, and others differently. Furthermore, good communication skills are central to resolving conflict situations. Many difficult situations are the result of misunderstandings. Individuals come from different backgrounds, do not share similar values, have different communication styles, look at the same thing but see something different. This is referred to as selective perception. Learning and practicing good communication skills are often central to managing difficult situations, particularly those involving anger and stress. We know that the message sent is not necessarily the message received, that we hear with our ears and listen with our minds. <i>(Photo: From left to right: Lawrence E. Susskind, PhD, Director of the MIT-Harvard Public Dispute Program, Maria Volpe, retired professor Peter Wengert, York College, CUNY.)</i></p>

<p>We have to pay as much attention to our nonverbal body language as our verbal messages. We sometimes think that we have communicated verbally, but sent a very different message with our body language. If we roll our eyes, look up to the ceiling or down to floor, others will most assuredly think that they are not being listened to. Furthermore, we need to be aware of the assumptions we make and check them out.</p>

<p>Good communication necessitates active listening, paraphrasing, summarizing, reflection, using I messages instead of you messages. Managing difficult situations means being acutely sensitive to "you messages." When we begin our messages to others with the word you, we make others feel defensive. They have a need to respond in kind, what we refer to as tit for tat. For example, you may want to tell a student or colleagues, You don't know what you are talking about. How else can one say this without triggering off the recipient of the message? How does -- "I am trying to understand your concerns" or to use the formula I feel [emotion], when you [state behavior], because [state effect], i.e., "I feel confused when you share that information with me because I am not sure what it means" -- sound? The earlier we learn how to practice good communication skills, a central component of all conflict resolution training, the easier it will be to prevent the escalation of situations that could have been nipped in the bud, had the parties checked out what was being said.</p>

<p>Using ground rules further enhances the fairness of process. For example, set ground rules such as one person will speak at a time, everyone will have an opportunity to share how he or she sees the situation, letting participants know who will start, how the process will work and how it will end. Most important, we often forget that it is necessary to keep track of what we have learned from our confrontations so we can try to prevent them from occurring again in the future.</p>

<p><b>Some Challenges</b>:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>New approaches are often seen as soft rather than as punitive</b>. In many conflict situations, there is an expectation that punishment will and must be meted out. Asking the parties to talk it through is seen as too soft and even scary. It also means that control will be shared or even given up by decisionmakers. Parties should be urged not to get stuck or positional. Ways to save face should be sought.
<br>
<li><b>High resistance from disputants to work out differences</b>. Getting parties to agree to work through their differences is an amazingly challenging task. It is not unusual for parties to want to be validated as being right, the other side as being wrong. 
<br>
<li><b>Finding sufficient resources and time to train</b>. While some individuals seem to be natural conflict resolvers, for the most part we need to provide constructive conflict resolution education and training. It is one more item competing for limited resources, not only for initial conflict resolution training but also to sustain the infrastructure and cultures needed to support conflict resolution efforts. One shot training is not sufficient.
<br>
<li><b>Screening of cases</b>. We should be careful when choosing cases, particularly with processes like mediation. For example, bringing the parties together too hastily or without proper preparation can potentially be damaging not only for the individuals involved, but also for the reputation of the processes.
<br>
<li><b>Gaining an understanding of processes that are informal, private, and often occur behind closed doors</b>. Processes like mediation do not get reported in the media since most of the work occurs behind closed doors in private, informal settings, unlike other conflicts which are resolved in open, public settings, like courts. Furthermore, the resolution of conflict is not as newsworthy as is the reporting of conflicts.
</ol>

<p>As we move toward the twenty-first century, a major question for us is "What kind of environment would we have to create, support and nurture in order to ensure the foundation forms for a society where constructive conflict resolution occurs?" With all of the exciting conflict resolution efforts underway, a significant infrastructure is emerging. One of the many university based efforts in conflict resolution is housed at the City University of New York.</p>

<p><b>The City University of New York Dispute Resolution Consortium</b></p>

<p>The City University of New York established the CUNY Dispute Resolution Consortium (CUNY DRC) to serve as a comprehensive coordinating mechanism for dispute resolution activities, research, practice, curriculum development, technical assistance and theory building across CUNY and the New York City metropolitan area. The CUNY DRC was founded in 1994 with the generous assistance of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the City University of New York.</p>

<p>The CUNY DRC is actively involved in the NYC dispute resolution community in many ways. It maintains a database of nearly 2,000 persons interested and involved in dispute resolution in academic, professional, or community settings from across the metropolitan area. Individuals, groups, and organizations use the database on a daily basis to link with others in the field. All individuals in the database receive the CUNY DRC's biannual newsletter that reports on dispute resolution activities in the NYC area.</p>

<p>The CUNY DRC publishes a subset of the database entitled Dispute Resolution Programs in the New York Metropolitan Area, a comprehensive listing of governmental, private, and not for profit organizations involved in the field. This directory is available for $3. The Consortium regularly sponsors well-attended lectures, panels, and roundtables on a variety of dispute resolution topics. Further, it offers technical assistance to community-based organization programs. One of its current projects is with the Westside Crime Prevention Program's Cops and Kids Conflict Resolution Program, which brings NYPD police officers and middle school students together for constructive dialogue.</p>

<p>At CUNY, the Consortium sponsors a Dispute Resolution Research Mini-Grant Program for faculty and staff to stimulate and support Dispute Resolution research and to convene scholars from diverse fields. The CUNY DRC often provides technical assistance to the University with the implementation of CUNY programs such as the new sexual harassment policy and Security Initiative. For the latter, workshops in conflict resolution are provided to all CUNY security officers. The CUNY DRC also provides training and technical assistance to a wide range of other University groups handling conflict situations. Recently, the CUNY DRC sponsored the first CUNY Student Conference in Dispute Resolution.</p>

<p>The CUNY DRC complements the academic Certificate Program in Dispute Resolution (est. 1981) at John Jay College, a senior college of CUNY. The Program is designed to provide students with an understanding of the conceptual issues involving conflict and conflict management, the skills required to act effectively as a dispute resolver, and internship opportunities for the application on knowledge and skills.</p>

<p>CUNY is the third largest public university system, and the largest urban university, in the United States. It is an academic network of ten senior colleges, six community colleges, a four-year technical college, a graduate school, a law school, a medical school, and Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, an affiliated school of medicine. CUNY's campuses are located in each of the five boroughs of NYC. The University has over 206,000 students taking credit bearing programs of instruction, and an additional 150,000 students enrolled in continuing education programs.</p>

<p><b><a name="housing">Housing</a></b></p>

<p><b>Discrimination in AIDS Housing</b><br>
<i>By K. Lowry</i></p>

<p>The most requested housing among homeless people living with AIDS are apartments for independent living. Private, independent housing that meets the requirements of people with the disabling characteristics of AIDS for $480 per month is scarce. Moreover, the expected increases in rent stabilized apartment rates, further diminishes that number. The process of renting an apartment in New York City is a long, arduous and stressful endeavor. PWAs are virtually powerless in a competitive market. Realtors and landlords are in business to make money, some at any cost but their own.</p>

<p>When asked to explain his experiences, Paul, a PWA looking for an apartment, reported, "On Sunday I saw a couple of apartments in the New York Times that I thought would be all right if I could be approved for an exception to policy. I made an appointment to see them - they were run down, in high crime areas, or on the fourth floor of a walk-up. But there was one in an area and a price-range I thought I could afford. I called on Monday and the landlord said it was no longer available." Paul goes on to say, "Early Wednesday morning, you stand in line at one of the City's newsstands to snag a copy of the Village Voice. You see an affordable apartment in a reasonable area, but it is being handled by a realtor. When you go to the realtor you fill out the application and realtor says, 'You don't stand much of a chance with this apartment, there are people here with jobs and the landlord has no confidence in the City's ability to pay on time. And the City won't pay that kind of money.' Then you say that it will, because it will be paid by DAS...The realtor says, 'We really don't have anything for you.' You go to another realtor. She says, 'I'll call you back.' Nine months later, even though you've gone or called there every day, seen client after client shown and rented apartments, you haven't seen one apartment, nor has she ever called you back." Consumer News has verified these allegations at the two realtors about which we have had the most complaints.</p>

<p>These are avoidance techniques that are employed to mask illegal discriminatory practices. AIDS Service Organizations are so busy with social service issues that they have little time or resources for this. Most of the agencies do not interact with clients until after they are housed or until they themselves enter into a landlord/tenant relationship with the client. Among the 47 PWAs who have contacted us, most had no knowledge of, 'Housing Placement Assistance' programs, and none who had, found apartments. Black and Hispanic people in the United States of America are quite familiar with these tactics -- put them off with specious arguments, exclude and disenfranchise an entire group or class of American citizens. However, when these experiences were brought to the attention of officials at HUD, CICRP was urged to report them to the Fair Housing Office. There are Civil Rights Laws that protect against these practices. While there are Alternative Dispute Resolution forums that would advantage all concerned, Realtors and landlords who persist in engaging in such practices should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Consumer News urges PWAs to continue to report the experiences they have with accessing and keeping housing. 212/387-0824.</p>

<p><b>HIV Disease and the Mouth -- What You Need to Know</b><br>
<i>By Fariba S. Younai, DDS and Sunita Merriman, DDS</i></p>

<p><b>What is HIV?</b> HIV means "Human Immunodeficiency Virus," which is the name of the organism that causes AIDS. HIV is a virus which attacks the body's immune system and compromises the person's capability to fight infections. As a result one can suffer from a variety of diseases which are collectively termed "Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome" or "AIDS." Infection with HIV does not mean the person has AIDS; it may take as many as ten years or more before AIDS develops.</p>

<p><b>Who is at risk for HIV?</b> All scientific evidence has shown that one cannot get HIV by casual contact. The major ways HIV is transmitted are: a) sexual contact (exposure to semen and vaginal fluid); b) sharing of intravenous drug apparatus (exposure to infected blood); and c) being born to an HIV-positive mother. Before 1985, receiving a blood transfusion was a high risk for being infected with the virus but since then the blood banks perform HIV screening on the blood supply. So far there has been no substantial evidence to indicate transmission of HIV through other fluids like saliva, tears, urine, etc.</p>

<p><b>What are the signs of HIV infection?</b> On exposure to HIV there is the possibility of no infection; however in the case where one does get infected, the body may respond by presenting with acute symptoms within the first few weeks after the infection. These symptoms resemble the flu and consist of: skin rash, fever, muscle pains, joint pains, diarrhea, headaches, a sore throat and occasionally sores in the mouth.</p>

<p>It is also possible that one becomes infected but shows no signs of infection for a long time. Few months or several years after the infection, chronic symptoms like swollen lymph nodes, significant weight loss, diarrhea, and specific oral lesions can appear that indicate immune suppression. What are the oral signs of HIV infection? About 12 percent to 37 percent of people with HIV have some kind of oral lesion. Some of these lesions appear very early on, before severe immune suppression has occurred. Detecting oral lesions early can help in diagnosis of HIV infection and initiation of medical care.</p>

<p><b>Oral Candidiasis</b><br>
<img src="../gifs/candi.gif" alt="[photo]" hspace=5 align=left>This is the most common type of oral lesion in HIV disease seen in about 48 percent of infected people and also known as "thrush." This is a white coating of the mouth that can happen on the tongue, in the cheeks, and in the throat. <img src="../gifs/candi2.gif" alt="[photo]" hspace=5 align=right>Oral candidiasis can also be red, mostly on the tongue, but can be seen on the cheeks and on the roof of the mouth. Oral candidiasis can sometimes cause burning of the mouth and pain when swallowing. Treatment is in the form of antifungal medications that can be used topically as creams, rinses and lozenges, as well as systemically in the form of tablets.</p>

<p><b>Oral Hairy Leukoplakia</b><br>
<img src="../gifs/leuk.gif" alt="[photo]" hspace=5 align=left>Hairy Leukoplakia: a condition seen in a small percentage of HIV/AIDS patients (16-19 percent) is caused by a virus called the Epstein Barr. It presents as a white patch seen on the sides of the tongue, sometimes spreading to the undersurface or top of the tongue that, unlike candidiasis, cannot be rubbed off. Usually the lesions are asymptomatic but if they are accompanied by a fungal infection (thrush), it can cause some discomfort. Treatment in this case is in the form of anti-fungal and anti viral agents. It is important to diagnose hairy leukoplakia because it indicates advancement of HIV infection.</p>

<p><b>Aphthous Ulcers</b><br>
<img src="../gifs/apth.gif" alt="[photo]" hspace=5 align=left>Aphthous Ulcers, also called canker sores, can also appear in HIV infection. Most people have experienced these at one time or the other, especially when they are under stress. <img src="../gifs/apth2.gif" alt="[photo]" hspace=5 align=right>The only difference noticed in HIV-positive patients is that these ulcers occur more frequently, can be very large, more painful, and they take longer to heal. Common infected areas are the inside of the lips, the tongue and the back of the mouth in the pharyngeal area. Treatment consists of local application of a steroid ointment, and if the ulcers are long standing, then systemic steroid therapy may be started. <i>(<b>Ed. note</b>: <a href="../../network/simple/thalid.html">thalidomide</a> is available for treatment of apthous ulcers.)</i></p>

<p><b>Gingivitis</b><br>
<img src="../gifs/gingi.gif" alt="[photo]" hspace=5 align=left>Gingivitis is a condition involving inflammation of the gums in the presence of plaque. It is one of the most common diseases of the oral cavity and most people have some degree of gingivitis in their mouth. The amount of inflammation in the gums depends on the amount of plaque, and can be easily treated with dental cleaning and good home care.</p>

<img src="../gifs/gingi2.gif" alt="[photo]" hspace=5 align=right><p>In the presence of HIV/AIDS however, gingivitis can progress rapidly and cause advanced disease and tooth loss. In HIV-infected people, gingivitis can persist even after removal of plaque and cause a very red gum margin.</p>

<p><b>Periodontitis</b><br>
<img src="../gifs/peri.gif" alt="[photo]" hspace=5 align=left>Periodontitis comes after untreated gingivitis and involves more severe clinical signs like loss of gum attachment and loss of bone. This results in rapid loosening and eventual loss of teeth. It is important to aggressively treat this condition because if left unattended it could progress into an extremely painful situation caused by bacterial infections; it may even cause death of the gum tissue and exposure of the underlying bone. Treatment involves antibiotic therapy, pain control and local measures to keep the area clean.</p>

<p><b>Kaposi's sarcoma</b><br>
<img src="../gifs/ks.gif" alt="[photo]" hspace=5 align=right>In late stages of the HIV disease, cancers may develop. One type called <a href="../../network/simple/ks.html">Kaposi's sarcoma</a> can present as red-purple patches or masses in the mouth. They are usually found on the roof of the mouth and the area of tonsils but can also show up on the gum. This is a very serious condition and requires immediate medical attention.</p>

<p><b>Oral Herpes</b><br>
<img src="../gifs/herpes.gif" alt="[photo]" hspace=5 align=left>Herpes virus can cause infections in HIV-positive individuals. In the mouth it appears as small sores (fever blisters) on the lips or on the oral mucosa. The small ulcers usually join and crust over within a few days. This condition is highly contagious and can cause similar sores in other individuals who come into direct contact with them (casual or sexual contact). The lesions are treated with an antiviral ointment, or tablets.</p>

<p><b>How to maintain good oral health?</b> There are many simple ways to take care of your mouth:</p>

<ol>
<li>Examine your mouth periodically. 
<li>See your dentist regularly and discuss your oral conditions with him/her. <li>Follow a daily regimen of home care which should include brushing, flossing, mouthwash, and a healthy, well balanced diet.
</ol>

<p><b>Brushing</b> has optimal benefits when done after meals and especially before going to bed. </p>

<p><b>Flossing</b> helps clean areas that a toothbrush cannot. </p>

<p><b>Mouthwashes</b> have been shown to reduce the bacterial count in the mouth for a short time after use and also freshen the breath temporarily. Most mouthwashes can be obtained without a prescription. One type, however, called Peridex, requires a prescription and is used frequently to treat periodontal problems, especially those associated with HIV infection. Your dentist can decide when it is appropriate for your condition.</p>

<p><b>Diet choices</b> have a direct effect on the state of tissue health. Foods rich in calcium like milk, cheeses, tofu, etc., help strengthen the teeth and bones in their formative stages. Foods like apples and raw vegetables serve as cleansing agents for the teeth. A balanced diet should include cereals, breads, pasta, meat, vegetables, fruits, dairy products, etc. This is especially so for anyone who feels that they are risk of being infected by HIV.</p>

<p><b>Absorbing Nutrients and Medication</b><br>
<i>By Edwin Krales</i></p>

<p>Choosing, preparing and eating the right food is very important when fighting HIV or any other disease. Taking your vitamins, minerals and medications is also very important. But before these nutrients and chemicals can do you any good, your body must absorb them into your bloodstream. If you don't absorb them, they will leave your body the next time you move your bowels. The big question is what can you do to increase your body's absorption of nutrients and medication? The way you take medication, what you take it with, the way you cook, what you eat and how you eat it all play a role in increasing -- or decreasing -- absorption. You must also have a stomach and an intestinal tract that is working well enough to absorb these nutrients.</p>

<p>To start, don't take any medication with wine, beer, liquor, mixed drinks or any other beverage containing alcohol. If your cough medicine has alcohol in it, don't use it to wash down your aspirin. This combination can irritate your stomach and my cause it to bleed. Bleeding stomachs don't help digestion. Don't take your evening vitamins with a glass of wine. Better still, don't drink any alcohol. HIV loves alcohol and flourishes in alcohol preparations in the lab. Generally, you should not take medications with acidic beverages, especially grapefruit juice. Take your medications and vitamin/mineral supplements with an eight-ounce glass of pure water. However, grapefruit juice increases the absorption of <a href="../../network/simple/saquin.html">saquinavir</a>. (You can drink a glass of grapefruit up to two hours after taking saquinavir.) If you are in doubt, ask your pharmacist.</p>

<p>Pharmacists now have at least 50 different information strips with various instructions that they can attach to prescription bottles. On a recently filled prescription for antibiotics, there were four information strips about how best to use the medication. Two were related to eating. The first instruction was to take the medication on an empty stomach, either one hour before or at least two hours after eating. The second direction was not to take dairy products, antacids or iron preparations within one hour of taking this medication. In other words, don't drink a glass of milk with antibiotics like Tetracycline. The absorption of both the calcium in the milk and the medication may be reduced.</p>

<p>Two other examples among hundreds of possible drug/drug and drug/nutrient interactions should be mentioned. Maintaining your appetite is a challenge when you are ill. In addition, many people lose their appetites completely when they become depressed. Therefore, try not to take an antidepressant that can further decrease your appetite and as a result increase your weight loss. There are antidepressants on the market that can stimulate your appetite, help you eat more and help you gain weight. Ask your doctor about their possible use. Many people of European and African descent are lactose intolerant as adults. For them, drinking milk and using various dairy products can cause bloating, stomach discomfort, and very often <a href="../../pwahg/notes/27.html#diarrhea">diarrhea</a> that can lead to weight loss. People who are lactose intolerant avoid milk and milk products, use an enzyme product called Lactaid or pay a high price for their indulgence. This isn't news. What many people don't know is that lactose may be an ingredient in their medication. The amount of medicine in any pill makes a very small percentage of the pill itself. The rest of the pill is made up of a filler called the excipient, which may be lactose. One of the new protease inhibitors that uses lactose as a filler is saquinavir (Invirase). The most common side effects of saquinavir are nausea, stomach discomfort and diarrhea. There may not be enough lactose in one saquinavir tablet to cause any trouble, but if other medications also contain lactose as the filler and someone is taking ten or twenty or thirty different tablets per day, it is conceivable that this could be a serious problem. It is certainly worth discussing with your doctor or pharmacist. </p>

<p>Cooking foods in various ways affects the nutrient content and how easily they can be absorbed. Different problems exist for animal and plant foods, but there are some basic guidelines that affect both. Cooking with moist heat is usually better than dry heat or frying for ease of absorption. Chicken cooked in a covered pot with rice and vegetable or in a soup is easier to digest than chicken cooked on a barbecue or roasted. Cooking methods are especially important since the chicken and other meats and fish must be thoroughly cooked in order to kill all the dangerous bacteria that may be in them. The problem with roasting and barbecuing is that potentially carcinogenic compounds are produced whenever foods are charred. Cooking to well done when roasting or barbecuing usually produces a charred outer surface. Foods also become hard, difficult to chew and more difficult to break down in your stomach. Chewing is very important for several reasons. It increases your satisfaction while eating, it helps your body to release various digestive enzymes, it strengthens your teeth and gums. It also increases the surface area of the food going into your stomach so that the digestive juices there can do a better job of taking the food apart to make it easier to absorb. Moist cooking usually produces a well-done food that is softer and easier to chew, won't be charred at all and will be more easily digested. </p>

<p>Since we all like variety and don't cook and eat simply for the nutrient content of the meal, there are some tricks you can use when you are barbecuing to get more digestible food. Precook meat in a microwave or par boil it before barbecuing or roasting. This step will shorten the cooking time on the barbecue or roasting rack. Wrap hamburgers in aluminum foil so that they cook in their own juices on the grill. </p>

<p>I don't suggest trying to scrape off charred parts or removing skin from chicken, since that level of self-control eludes most of us, especially if we are at a party. Try it, you may succeed. </p>

<p>The problems with cooking vegetables so that they retain their "goodness" and palatability are different than the problems we have with cooking meats. Many vegetables if cooked too long can lose 50 percent or more of their vitamins and minerals and become mushy. This long cooking time may make vegetables easier to digest, but they are not very appealing to eat this way. If your vegetables (and your fruits) are not wrapped and refrigerated before use, the natural processes that go on in these plants will destroy may of the nutrients even before they are cooked. The best way to cook most vegetables is to use a small amount of water, in a covered pot with a steamer that keeps the vegetables completely above the water. Steam the vegetables until they are a bit softer than when they are raw. This process will make them easier to digest and enable then to retain most of their nutrients. After you take the vegetables out of the pot, don't throw away the "pot liquor," the water that is left. A lot of nutrients for your vegetables have dissolved in that water. Save the water and use it to make other dishes. For example, if you are having condensed tomato soup and you need to add a can of water, use a can of carrot cooking water instead. Plan ahead. Save some of your thoroughly cleaned plastic containers, pour in your vegetable pot liquor, label, date and cover them, and pop them into your 0&#176;F freezer. Use the cooking water to make soups stews, grains like rice, or dried beans. Experiment. Have fun. Think of these containers of pot liquor in you freezer as "homemade vitamin elixir." Its more fun than a pill and probably a lot easier to absorb.</p>

<p>Can you imagine a Valentine's Day card with a stomach on it instead of a heart? Perhaps both? When I am with people who annoy me, if I am working too hard or if I have unpleasant thoughts my stomach, not my heart, is in a knot. My sense of taste changes. this doesn't mean that I suddenly like red glen-plaid suits, with bell bottom pants and polka dot ties, but that I don't feel like eating. Everything is "off." I may even get diarrhea. The best remedy is to eat in a pleasant, relaxed setting, with people you love, eating food that makes you feel good. take pleasure in taking care of yourself. You deserve it.</p>

<p><b><a name="recipe">Recipe</a>: Lasagna</b><br>
<b>Yield</b>: 12 servings. Prep time: 45 minutes. Baking time: 45 minutes.</p>

<p><b>Hint</b>: This is a special Sicilian style lasagna originally concocted for the Yuppies, Guppies and Buppies of the nineties. Ground turkey makes a delicate meat sauce without the fat found in red meat. Lasagna holds together a lot better if it is made one day, cooled and heated again the next. Some like to put an egg in the sauce but Gina et al. will have a fit. If you buy fresh lasagna sheets you do not have to boil it. You can get fresh ricotta and mozzarella pasta and all the ingredients in Little Italy. Plan a trip and walk around -- it's time for the St. Anthony's Festival. DiPaulo's on Grand Street in Little Italy has a reputation for fresh ricotta and mozzarella cheese, but I like Russo's on East11th St. near Victor's Market Place, on First Avenue at 13th Street. They will grind fresh turkey for you -- tell them Consumer News sent you.</p>

Spread a third of the bechamel sauce on the pasta, then a healthy portion of the meat sauce and nine to twelve spoonfuls of the ricotta evenly spaced over the sauce. Cover this with another sheet of pasta and repeat the process until you have two or three layers (your choice). Cover this with a final sheet of pasta and fold the flaps over the top to make a nice package. Make a small hole in the center of the casserole to let steam escape. Place the pan in a pan of water (Bain Marie), and cover with foil. Make another hole in the center of the foil for steam and bake in a preheated 400&#176; oven for 45 minutes. Then let the lasagna cool one hour and place in the refrigerator over night. Cut the Lasagna in serving size squares and wrap them individually in foil. Label, date and freeze the packages. When you want to serve them thaw enough squares to feed you and your diners, cover with sauce and place a slice of mozzarella on each portion.

<p>Cyclospora is a one-celled microscopic parasite that has caused serious outbreaks of intestinal disease in eleven states. More than one hundred cases have been reported in New York City. The Cyclospora organism causes diarrhea. People who are infected may have six or more loose watery bowel movements a day for several days. In some people the diarrhea will stop for a few days, and then start again, this on-and-off pattern may persist for a month or longer. Other symptoms may include cramps, loss of appetite, fatigue, weight loss, gas, muscle aches, and fever (NYC DOH). Marcelle Layton, MD, Assistant Commissioner of the New York City Department of Health, Bureau of Communicable Diseases, reports that the current thinking is that the organism is found on the skins of fruits. Some State Health Departments are reporting that the organism is found on strawberries and raspberries, but the data was not conclusive by the time Consumer News went to press. Dr. Layton urges people to wash all fruits and vegetables thoroughly, before consumption. The Cyclospora outbreak illustrates the importance of the overall need for cleanliness with our food and in our lives. Undoubtedly there will be more of the same in the future, but if we are vigilant, we will guard against much of them by our attention to cleanliness.</p>

<p><b>Interpersonal Conflict (4th ed.)</b><br>
Hocker, Joyce L. and Wilmot, William W., Brown and Benchmark, 25 Kessel Ct., Madison, WI 53711 (299 pp. $32.19. 1995).</p>

<p>I have somehow managed to miss seeing the first three editions of Hocker and Wilmot's Interpersonal Conflict, which date back to 1978. In looking at this edition, however, I am very impressed with the quality of their work. The book is designed as a text in a college course in conflict, originally probably in a communications curriculum, but equally useful for one in sociology or social work, or possibly for one in political science, although for a course in that area I would like a bit more emphasis on international conflict.</p>

<p>The book is divided into two segments, the first dealing with definitional and structural elements of conflict. It has an introductory chapter and additional chapters on the nature of conflict, conflict goals, power, and styles and tactics. The second section, entitled Conflict Assessment, Personal Intervention, includes chapters on both issues. The coverage thus is broad, although I think that more time could have been spent on facilitated interventions, such as mediation, in light of their growth in recent years.</p>

<p>Stylistically the book is written with a light touch. Students are encouraged to refer to personal experience, words are clearly defined when first encountered, and many lists of ideas and approaches and instructive stories break up the presentation to maintain the interest of the reader. Good coverage is offered of important issues such as gender influences. The continuous recognition of potential constructive influences of conflict are healthy. Although this is not a sophisticated work for an advanced or graduate program, it provides an excellent introduction to conflict theory on an understandable and accessible level.</p>

<p><b>Conflict Management: Managing Conflict at Work (code J73C16)</b><br>Pfeiffer & Co., 2780 Circleport Dr., Erlanger, KY 41018; also available from American Media Inc., (AMI) 4900 University Dr., West Des Moines, IA 50266-6769. (94pp $12.95 1994)</p>

<p><b>Conflict Management</b> is part of the AMI one hour series, a somewhat peculiar title as it is clear that the book is not designed to be completed in one hour or even in a series of one hour lessons. What it offers is basic training in conflict management with the emphasis on the workplace setting in a self-teaching interactive format. Using simple language and many brief exercises, primarily of the fill in the blank type, it takes the reader through the nature of conflict, its sources, its resolution, and self-assertion as a means of responding in conflict situations. I tend to be somewhat suspicious of books of this type. Often, they are either aimed so low as to be useless or are misleading in their attempts at oversimplification. This book, however, manages to hit a happy medium. It does not attempt to provide a very sophisticated approach to the issues of conflict, but within its limits it is clear, accurate, and, perhaps most pleasantly surprising not condescending to the reader. The book's approach is to encourage the reader to recognize the reality that conflict will occur in an employment setting, prepare the reader to anticipate its occurrence, see the potential for growth and productivity that can result from its effective management, and utilize the potential efficiently and responsibly, using both problem solving and effective communication tools to accomplish these results. While many of the exercises are simple self-analysis issue identification ones, some of them are both creative and original. For example, the self-assessment test with which the book starts does an especially good job of presenting the cognitive dissonance which can influence one's effectiveness in managing conflict, and the review questions included at various points in the text encourage the reader to do more than merely parrot the text read, but to think seriously about the issues presented. This book will be quite useful to a lower level manager seeking to improve his or her skills. For such a use, it can be strongly recommended.</p>

Consumer News has learned that several scatter site programs are defaulting on their financial responsibilities. The programs function as landlords and social service providers who hold primary leases on scatter site apartments and are contracted to manage subsidies for PWA utilities housing and supportive services. Clients are responsible for a percentage of the rents and all costs above the utilities and phone subsidies. In some cases rents and bills have not been paid for several months and PWAs are threatened with eviction and utility shut-offs. Tenants are advised to first speak with case managers and program directors to understand what the facts are, what to expect, and what steps are being taken to assure that you will continue to have a home. If a clear and satisfactory explanation is not forthcoming then seek legal assistance from a tenant lawyer.</p>

<p>A Federal Judge in Manhattan has blocked the New York State Department of Social Services new regulation limiting Medicaid recipients to four hours a day of home-bound health care.</p>

<p><b>STATE</b><br>
AIDS Activists occupied Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno's office in Albany to protest further cuts in the <a href="../../network/access/index.html">AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP)</a>. Short falls in the newly released Ryan White funding have already imperiled this vital program. However New York State's AIDS Institute, charged with administering the ADAP program, has assured Consumer News that Protease Inhibitors will still be offered in July.</p>

<p>Governor Pataki has signed a bill making it mandatory for health officials to inform mothers of HIV test results performed routinely on newborns. Proponents contend disclosure will provide quicker and better medical care for infected newborns. Opponents argue it violates women's privacy and amounts to mandatory testing for mothers. Critics believe voluntary testing of pregnant women with the assurance of guaranteed appropriate care for mother and child is the best way to go.</p>

<p>The Clinton Administration is likely to approve Governor Pataki's ambitious plan to enroll millions of New York State's Medicaid recipients in managed care organizations. AIDS advocates express concerns that people with HIV and AIDS will not receive adequate care under the strictures of such programs. In 1995, when the State moved to enroll patients into managed care organizations, there were serious problems. Some PWAs were unable to go to their regular clinics and some managed care organizations had no physicians with AIDS expertise (see <a href="may.html#conflict">Conflict Resolution: Medicaid Managed Care, Vol. 1 No 5</a>). The Clinton administration has promised that these concerns must be addressed before mandatory enrollment. However, Republicans in New York's Congressional Delegation have demanded that the Pataki proposal be implemented intact and immediately.</p>

<p><b>NATION</b><br>
<a href="http://www.safersex.org/oral/">Oral sex</a>, previously thought to be low-risk for HIV transmission, came under attack in a new report by scientists last month. Six of seven Rhesus monkeys were infected after having the backs of their mouths dabbed with SIV, an AIDS-like virus found in Simians. Dr. Ann Duerr an epidemiologist at the CDC, while stating that oral sex "is unlikely to be a 'no-risk' situation," was however surprised by the findings. She pointed to several studies in 'high-risk' groups who reported that they had only engaged in oral sex with infected partners.</p>

<p><b>Conflict Management in AIDS Service Organizations</b><br>
Mediation, arbitration, conciliation, facilitation, and collaborative problem solving are tailor made forums selected to resolve conflicts under the concept of alternative dispute resolution. Conflict resolution has enjoyed increased popular support with centers operating worldwide. New York State is a leader in this field with one of the largest networks of private and court mediation centers in the United States. Still, the availability of sound conflict resolution education and methodologies in agencies that provide services for PWAs is woefully lacking. Antiquated grievance mechanisms, ombudspeople whose allegiances are to the agencies that employ them, and costly, time consuming adjudication are the norms.</p>

<p>There are no reliable formulas for eliminating conflicts among people obliged to live together after significant trauma, but there are emerging mechanisms that show promise in managing conflict, empowering clients and building community. The most effective of these are those that rely upon processes that encourage all affected parties to work through their differences and develop mutually acceptable solutions. Settling disputes quickly strengthens trust between clients and agencies by emphasizing that attention to and resolutions of conflicts to PWAs' biological, environmental, and behavioral concerns, are requisite priorities. When disputes arise between clients and agencies they often engage in discourse that pit them against each other creating adversarial, destructive environments rather than promoting an atmosphere of cooperation and negotiation. Implementing conflict resolution methodologies can begin the process of empowering the client and restoring confidence in the agency. There is a pressing need for agencies to initiate and implement conflict resolution mechanisms that encourage proactive, preventive approaches to managing disputes. Effective dispute resolution systems require a multifaceted approach. Recommendations include training and intervention components. The training focuses on the processes that encourage collaborative problem solving, constructive ways to work through differences, finding common ground, developing good communication skills, setting boundaries, ground rules and positive-sum outcomes. Intervention may include advocacy, crisis management, and custodial actions.</p>

<p>A core group of personnel and clients in each agency who are educated and trained in conflict resolution management, bring the disputants to the table, thereby practicing negotiation skills and introducing the culture to the community. This group reviews disputes and recommends peer or agency mediation, conciliation or other courses of action. They employ independent third party mediators or conciliators for more intense, complicated disputes and unresolved conflicts previously heard in peer or agency forums.</p>

<p>"Emerging studies and anecdotal reports from those who have been exposed to conflict resolution skills report that they think differently about how they handle conflicts. Many report that they are managing conflicts arising at home, in their neighborhoods, with friends, colleagues, and others differently." (Dr. Maria Volpe, Conflict Resolution: An Emerging Landscape, Consumer News, 1996, Vol. 1. <a href="9606.html#conflict">Nos. 6</a> &amp; <a href="#conflict">7</a>)</p>

<p>Good communication skills are essential for case managers and other agency employees, as well as for clients. Managing conflicts can mean listening, synthesizing and paraphrasing comments and concerns to prevent the escalation of disputes and pre-empt win-lose outcomes. While attention to these ideas is helpful, training is necessary to begin the process. Conflict Resolution training is available throughout the tri-state area from public and private companies and universities.</p>

<p>Research supports the efficacy of ADR forums, and highlights dramatic reductions in the overall costs for resolution of social service and legal disputes, comparatively rapid results, and higher rates of enforceability as with binding arbitration. Where mediation is used, there are higher rates of compliance because agreements between the disputing parties are mutually negotiated.</p>

<p><b>Relapse</b><br>
Historically, ASOs have opened their doors to all sorts and conditions of men and women, but this open door policy is being questioned by many who have had difficulty providing services to active and relapsing substance abusers. The concerns around relapse among PWAs in independent housing and scatter site housing loom large with service providers. There are those whose frustrations lead them to make statements that they would not wish on themselves, were they the ones living with AIDS and thus the recipients of the services. In return for housing and social services some would have clients give up their constitutional rights to privacy and due process. You cannot take the rights away from a few problematic clients without taking your own rights away. While the questions of disruptive clients continue to plague service providers, the answers yet may be within their grasp. The City contracts with not-for-profits to provide housing and supportive services for people living with AIDS. Those services which the City purchases include psychiatric and substance abuse counseling. If there are severe difficulties in delivering the service to clients then the prognosis of the service delivery system is poor. It is time to revisit the options, including alternative dispute resolution, adjudication, and collaborative problem solving with the police when appropriate, community members and social service providers. Disease, behavioral disorders and character flaws are complexities of the human condition that have inspired us to devise and implement protocols that transcend imperfection -- that bring hope to all people living with AIDS.</p>

<p><b>Scattered Problems</b><br>
<i>by Eugene Figueroa</i></p>

<p>The issue of approaches to dealing with PLWAs who relapse while living in scatter site units is one that unfortunately, I am all too familiar with. As Director of the Federation of Puerto Rican Communities, Inc. Queens' Scattered Site housing program, I am forced to confront this problem much too frequently. As a human service professional, it represents a quandary which often forces me to choose between the best interest of the client and the standing and longevity of the program.</p>

<p>This dilemma poses a number of issues which need to be examined closely. Those PLWAs who recognize their setback are usually amenable to intervention, fully understanding the health risks posed by their continued substance abuse and the implications of this destructive path. However, often those PLWAs in scatter site who remain in denial once they have relapsed, present a situation which forces one to choose between their best interest and the program reputation. As scattered-site vendors, we are legally bound by the stipulations of the various lease agreements we establish with the many landlords who work with us. Far too often the behaviors of those client/tenants who relapse literally jeopardize the legal standing of the agency, and in effect put the rest of the clients who are successfully participating in our program at risk. When treatment options are not a viable route, then punitive measures must be considered. There are those who believe that the client's best interest should predominate and see any adversarial action against the client as unacceptable and demeaning. Nonetheless, to ignore the problem would be tantamount to abandoning the principles and the integrity of scatter site housing. Yet DAS rules dictate that clients cannot be expelled from scattered site housing for substance-abuse and/or lack of rent payments. Yet, these behaviors are often clear indications that program participants have lost focus. This policy in effect enables the client in crisis to continue his/her destructive path and possibly bring the program down with him/her. Although there are those who feel that no one can be forced to be sober until they are ready, one must also consider the ramifications of this behavior on the program's continued existence and the community at-large. Not to mention the client, who as a result of the HIV status may be slowly contributing to his/her own demise.</p>

<p>PLWAs in publicly supported housing must understand that in today's climate, negative behaviors and actions that offer ammunition to those who are opposed to PLWAs entitlements are literally contributing to the argument for reduced services and cuts in housing subsidies.</p>

<p><b><a name="conflict">Conflict</a> Resolution: An Emerging Landscape</b><br>
<i>First of two articles by Maria R. Volpe, Ph.D.</i></p>

<p>Conflicts are universal, inevitable, and normal. There always have been and always will be differences between individuals and groups over anything and everything. Since the prospects of a conflict free world are quite slim, one of the major challenges we face is finding better, more constructive mechanisms to handle conflicts, particularly those which provide disputing parties with opportunities to be architects of their solutions. What is most promising and exciting at the present time is the growing interest in using more collaborative, non-adversarial ways of resolving conflicts.</p>

<p>While there are neither magical formulas nor easy solutions for handling conflict situations, we know that some solutions work better than others. In fact, strategies for handling difficult situations range from avoidance to annihilation. At one extreme are conflict situations which end up with annihilation. We read and hear about situations involving a dirty look, a rumor, a misunderstanding which can in some instances escalate to violent confrontations and even deadly results. Other than destructive outcomes, confrontations also result in challenges like intimidation, anxiety, retaliation and injury.</p>

<p>At the other extreme is avoidance. While avoidance is preferred to annihilation, it too can be a risky way of resolving difficult situations. Depending on the situation, particularly if there are ongoing relationships, avoidance can set the stage for much frustration, tension and the likelihood that a conflict will blossom and grow. As a strategy, there is not much to teach anyone about avoidance. It is more of a judgement call, that is knowing when it is prudent to quit, ignore, or withdraw from a situation. Some avoidance type tactics can be seen as quite offensive, like hanging the phone up on individuals, putting individuals on hold for protracted periods of time, walking away from individuals without explanation, pretending that you don't see someone standing on line or waiting for your assistance.</p>

<p>In short, both annihilation and avoidance can provide us with major challenges. Resolving conflicts can be quite complicated. It is probably very safe to say that no two conflicts are ever exactly the same (since none of our interactions, either easy and difficult occur in a vacuum, but within a context). Many variables impact how conflicts are handled. In each conflict situation, individuals bring their complex baggage. Among other things, one's baggage encompasses previous experiences, education, conflict management styles, values, beliefs, gender, sexual orientation, physique, life styles as well as culture including race, ethnicity, religion. In sum, the promises and challenges of managing conflicts reflect the setting in which the conflicts occur as well as whatever precedes the conflict at hand.</p>

<p><b>New Approaches to Resolving Conflicts</b><br>
The strategies that are capturing widespread attention are those where the individuals are encouraged to approach situations in a new way. These are strategies that spur individuals to communicate, express their concerns, listen to each other, brainstorm options, work through their differences, and if they cannot find constructive ways to do so directly, reach out to others who can help. These processes are referred to by a variety of terms including collaborative problem solving, interest based negotiation, mediation, facilitation, conciliation.</p>

<p>While these processes vary, they are processes where common ground is sought and outcomes framed in win-win terms. Some, like negotiation, focus on the parties themselves engaging in a direct dialogue. Others, like mediation and conciliation, rely on third parties to help. Such interveners do not make decisions for the parties. In many ways, they are extensions of negotiation processes which could not unfold or broke down along the way. The conflict resolution field is much like other fields trying to set the stage for healthy, productive lives through preventative, proactive work, while always ready to react when the conflict crises occur. Proactive work in all areas can be time consuming, difficult, and even exhausting. It involves information dissemination, changes in attitudes and behavior, as well as skill development.</p>

<p>The constructive handling of conflicts is as old as civilization. Yet, for the most part, limited attention has been given to deliberate education and training efforts or even professional careers as dispute resolvers. We are in the midst of what might best be characterized as a paradigm shift from thinking of conflicts as private troubles and increasingly treating them like public issues that need to be given more deliberate attention by scholars, researchers, and practitioners. In fact, dispute resolution is increasingly being seen as the fourth R in educational settings. Reading, writing and arithmetic will no longer be sufficient for students being prepared to work and live in a shrinking, ever increasingly diverse global community. </p>

One of more recent volumes, Conflict Processing, was co-edited with Peter Maida, Ph.D., J.D. Dr. Volpe is an consultant to the Conflict Resolution Project for PWAs CICRP.</i></p>

<p><b><a name="power">The</a> Power Within</b><br>
<i>By Tullia Forlani Kidde</i></p>

<p>Thinking about illness, I would like to bring you a message of life. Right now you may feel overwhelmed by the challenges facing you. Priorities get re-evaluated, fears magnified. Many of us are confronted for the first time with our own mortality. Healing becomes the magic word. Where do we go from here?</p>

<p>There is a place within you that disease cannot touch, a place where you are whole and radiant with health. That is the sacred place within you where the Power of Infinite Spirit, your Divine Creator resides. That Power within can transform your life. Attune yourself to it by quieting your mind. Become receptive to His guidance by letting it speak through your intuition. As you connect with this power you will come to accept that your physical self undergoing a disease experience is only one side of you. Your Spirit, the very essence of your being is whole, intact.</p>

<p>It is that Power in you that will give you strength to overcome your difficulties a step at a time, to let go of preconceived ideas about your health. It will give you the courage to look at your life, heal the wounds of your past, forgive yourself that Power that will help you accept yourself totally as you are: your wonderful creative Self expressed through the gifts you bring to the world, and the limitations of your humanness.</p>

<p>When doubts and worries assail you and trouble your heart, that Power in you will help you let go and be in the moment. Your focus will shift to the fullness of life; you may rediscover joys lost in the hectic process of everyday living and become grateful for all you have taken for granted. The goal is to understand that healing is not a matter of reward and punishment. It is a matter of connecting with the life force within each one of us and understanding that we are co-creators of our life experience through our thoughts and actions. It requires willingness and belief.</p>

<i>CN Staff</i></p>

<p>The lecture and workshop, previously scheduled for June 27, 1996, has been changed and rescheduled. Many PWAs have expressed interest in holistic approaches to managing disease and the calls reflect that interest. Due to the large volume of people who have called to reserve seats we have expanded the program and changed the date. The new date is August 7, 1996. Dr. Siegel's work is well known among lay-people and Health Care Professionals (see <a href="may.html#bernie">CN May 1996 issue</a>). Dr. Siegel is the author of New York Times bestsellers <i>Love, Medicine &amp; Miracles</i>, <i>How to Live Between Office Visits</i>, and <i>Peace, Love &amp; Healing</i>. He will be joined by Tullia Forlani Kidde, and Dr. Lawrence LeShan. The lecturers will discuss the implementation of complementary therapies. Ms. Kidde, also interviewed in that article, has been working with PWAs in Connecticut and will speak of her very promising work. Dr. LeShan, considered the "father of mind-body therapy, will speak about the "Psychological Mobilization of the Immune System" and lead a workshop for professionals and PWAs. Look for the interview in an upcoming issue of Consumer News. Dr. LeShan's books include: <i>Cancer as a Turning Point</i> and <i>You Can Fight for Your Life: Emotional Factors in the Treatment of Cancer</i>. Consumer News is reserving 300 seats for PWAs and the remaining seats will be available for donors. PWAs are urged to write for a scholarship. You must write or have your ASO or DAS case manager submit your name and make the arrangements. Consumer News requests that those who can afford it, buy a scholarship for a PWA.</p>

<p><b><a name="act">ACT</a> UP's Real Treatments for Real People Campaign</b><br>
<i>By George M. Carter</i></p>

<p>A large percentage of people with HIV have turned to unconventional approaches to dealing with the disease. From nutrition and dietary supplements to herbs and novel techniques like applying the photochemical DNCB, injecting ozone to mind/body practices, qi gong, exercise, diet changes, meditation and so forth. Some of these may help. Others may do little if anything to slow or alter the course of progression. Some may be harmful. While the newly approved drugs are offering dramatic benefits for people who have progressed to AIDS, they are not yet a cure and do not address the needs of asymptomatic individuals. Indeed, access to these drugs for many will be almost impossible due to government negligence and indifference and the profit interests of the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many of these approaches suffer two serious problems. The first is that there is often little information from studies about them. The other is that most are not covered by medical plans. Access is therefore a problem. </p>

<p>ACT UP is engaged is demanding that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) assess what people are doing in a meaningful way. This is called the REAL TREATMENTS FOR REAL PEOPLE CAMPAIGN (RTRP). If any of these approaches are helping, studies can determine the strengths, limitations, problems, dosing, scheduling and other types of questions that help achieve the maximum benefit. In addition, if NIH performs these studies and shows efficacy, it may open physicians' minds to use of such ignored options while driving public policy (insurance companies, Medicaid, etc.) to cover them.</p>

<p>One problem is that many of these are unpatentable (and hence unprofitable). Also, there is a prejudice by mainstream researchers against "complementary" approaches. This is institutional orthodoxy that flies in the face of the basic tenets of science. It is an anti-scientific attitude that pervades the FDA, NIH, mainstream medical practice, the International AIDS Society (the people who put on the big AIDS conventions), which almost completely exclude studies. There is some good news: the International AIDS Conference in Vancouver may be MUCH better at embracing a broader perspective.</p>

<p>The first issue is what to study. There are many anecdotal reports, scientific evidence and other rationales for reviewing a variety of alternatives. Some of these alternatives include anabolic steroids, combinations of micronutrients, hyperforat, combination antioxidant therapy, DNCB, glycyrrhizin, transfer factors, combination thymic extracts, curcumin, colloidal silver (as an antimicrobial), Chinese and other herbs, bitter melon (not just the MAP 30 extract-which still hasn't been evaluated), the herb Codonopsis for improving red blood cell counts and so forth. Input from the community should be the driving force in prioritizing which are most deserving of attention, not just the peer review system at NIH that does not include peers from the alternative and complementary fields. One demand RTRP has made is for a congress to be convened of activists, people with HIV, clinicians and scientists, especially those who use different modalities, to begin the process of prioritizing the questions that are most in need of answers.</p>

<p>After determining what to look at, the next question is how to study it. Methodology has been limited (by and large) to standard trial design. While this is useful in a limited way, it is not the only way to develop meaningful, life saving information. Broadly speaking, two general approaches can be simultaneously pursued: the broad assessments and the narrow focus. The broad areas are the different ways to assess the reality of people doing a wide range of therapies that change over time, following this evolution (i.e., management trials). For example, Carlton Hogan of the Minneapolis CPCRA has, with others, developed an approach to clinical trial design called MAPS (Master Antiretroviral Protocol Strategy). It addresses the question of how to develop trials that address individuals' unique needs through stratification and shifting protocols. They seek to use it not just for "nukes" but also for alternative and complementary protocols, OI protocols, etc. This is a type of management trial that reflects real world behavior while providing information on efficacy.</p>

<p>In parallel with this should be smaller, shorter studies that can assess anticipated impact of therapies on blood work (for example, effect on viral load of antivirals; effect on oxidative stress, etc.) With a large and small view working in tandem, a clearer picture may arise as to what works and what the limitations are. This description, of course, only outlines the broad strokes of such ideas, but the possibilities may well help us to understand how to deal with HIV infection in a comprehensive, integrative fashion. Apart from clinical questions, the other major component of AIDS is the basic science or "pathogenesis": the events that occur in bodies after HIV infection that result in AIDS. The ACT UP/New York Demand for a McClintock Project to Cure AIDS has become the AIDS Cure Act and has been introduced (at least twice) by Gerald Nadler (D-NY) in the House of Representatives. This is an ambitious and detailed program for a "Manhattan Project" which Clinton supported, but, consistent with his litany of betrayals, is doing nothing about. The Project is a vigorous program to study the pathogenesis of AIDS-what causes the immune system to dysregulate-so that rational approaches can be developed. This is vital given NIH's long history of ignoring vital areas of AIDS research like oxidative stress. For background reading material, please see the text of the bill. We used the word "cure" that is defined as "Any and all approaches that will ensure a well-functioning immune system (including but not limited to antiretrovirals, curative vaccines and immune regulators) and a normal life span with a reasonable quality of life."</p>

<p>You might also review Griffin, MT, "AIDS and the Pharmaceutical Industry: A Need for Reform," American Journal of Law and Medicine, (1991) 17(4):363-410. This is just scratching the surface of what is wrong and why serious changes need to be made. Profit is one thing, but when it is at the expense of peoples' lives and causes unnecessary suffering, it is not an acceptable single criterion for business. It is the amount of profit in contrast to businesses of other types.</p>

<p>The work is enormous. It will take input from everyone. What works is the key, not what label it is given. There are too few voices calling for their rigorous assessment. The industries that produce them are unable (due to lack of funds), unwilling (just greedy) and/or untrained (in clinical methodology) to undertake these efforts. There are a great deal of lies, hype and false hope generated by both alternatives and mainstream medical researchers and practitioners. And there is a treasure trove of value in each. We must seek to end these artificial distinctions by calling for rigorous science rooted in the only valuable prospective: that which improves and heals people. Undoubtedly, this will require practitioners from every field to expand their horizons and grow beyond the narrow confines of their individual training. And undoubtedly it will take people with HIV demanding to know what these alternatives are really doing.</p>

<p><b><a name="summer">Summer</a> Fun And Food Safety</b><br>
<i>By Edwin Krales</i></p>

<p>With summer on the way, the issue of food safety increases in importance because of the way we live our lives during these warmer months. As we spend more time outdoors, our need for fluids is higher and we eat more barbecues, picnics and "on the run." The failure of the FDA to inspect our meat and poultry for cleanliness does not add to our confidence in food supply. Germs like Listeria, Salmonella, Trichinella, Giardia, and Hepatitis viruses live in raw undercooked meat, poultry and fish. Millions of people in the U.S. suffer from illnesses caused by these germs each year. If you are HIV positive, the illnesses can be life threatening. But even if you get ordinary symptoms of food poisoning such as nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps and diarrhea, you can lose a lot of weight, get dehydrated, run a fever and wind up in the hospital for weeks if not longer. What a price to pay for a cheap hamburger at your kid's school picnic! The best cure, of course, is prevention. And remember, when in doubt, throw it out!</p>

<p><b>Meats</b><br>
When you buy meats, fish, poultry or anything for that matter, check the expiration date. Buy the products with the longest time left before expiration. If you need to get ground chuck for your burger cookout, don't buy the pre-ground product. It is impossible to know its origin, its content, or its age. Ask the butcher in your supermarket or meat-market to grind whatever cut of meat you pick out of the cooler. Have it wrapped thoroughly in plastic and separate it from the rest of your food. If you are going to be shopping for a while, have the meat placed in the cooler until you are ready for the check-out line and then pick it up.</p>

<p><b>Fish</b><br>
When you buy fish, check the eyes and gills of whole fish. If the eyes have a white film on them, the fish is not fresh. If the gills are a deep red the fish is probably fresh or was frozen when it was fresh.</p>

<p><b>Poultry</b><br>
Chickens are better if they are bought whole and then cut up by the butcher. If you don't have a butcher you might as well learn to do it yourself. Whole chickens are usually cheaper by the pound than ones that are cut up, so saving money can be an incentive for learning to be your own butcher.</p>

<p>If the picnic fare is to be cooked outside, it can still be stored in an inexpensive cooler at 40&#176;F or below until it is ready to be cooked. Your freezer should be set at 0&#176;F or below if you want to keep the meat frozen for more than two or three days.</p>

<p>Keeping everything clean when you are eating outside is also important. All utensils should be washed in hot soapy water not less than 140&#176;F. Sanitize your outside work-surfaces with a solution of 1 teaspoon of bleach for every quart of water. Of course if you are eating at someone else's picnic, it's hard to control the preparations. But you can make sure that the food you eat is cooked thoroughly. Always choose food that has been just cooked, not something that has been "resting" on the side at a lovely 85&#176;F in the sun, waiting to win the bacteria seal of approval. Your burger, wings or fish should be cooked well done at 180&#176;F, to be on the safe side. There should be no sign of red or pink meat, and no red or pink juices. Don't be shy. Use a meat thermometer.</p>

<p>Never eat anything with raw meat, raw fish or raw eggs in it. Homemade mayonnaise is delightful, but dangerous if made with raw eggs. Never eat salads that have been made with mayonnaise or other dressings if they have not been refrigerated or cooled properly (40&#176;F or less) until you eat them. Don't ignore condiments, dressings and items like milk for coffee. Treat them with the same care as the main dishes. A little bit of spoiled milk, butter or Russian dressing can make a lot of people sick. Use them only if they have been chilled properly.</p>

<p><b>Where Do they Wash their Hands?</b><br>
If you are not at a picnic but are enjoying a day wandering around our fair city, don't eat from the little carts that dot our sidewalks. There is no reason to have faith that the quality of food is good or that its preparation or storage has been done properly. Ask yourself some unpleasant questions. For example, where do these vendors go to the bathroom? Where do they wash their hands? After a dog relieves itself in the street and a city bus drives over the product sending small particles high into the air, where do they settle? Need I say more?</p>

<p>Another category of food shop to avoid is the self-service salad bar. The age of the food, the temperature that it is held at and the personal sanitary habits of the countless people who handle the serving utensils are all unknown and potentially dangerous.</p>

<p><b>Safe Snacks</b><br>
Instead of buying your snack from a vendor of questionable quality, go into a good bakery, restaurant or supermarket where food will probably be fresh, dated and stored properly. Buy a sandwich made to order or buy the ingredients and make it yourself on the spot. Buy a fruit like a banana, orange or grapefruit in its own perfect wrapper. If its skin is unbroken or unbruised, the fruit inside will be wholesome.</p>

<p><b>Drink lots of Water</b><br>
Wherever you are going, make sure you have enough to drink. Avoid beer and other alcoholic beverages. Keep soda drinking to a minimum. Carry properly filtered, boiled or bottled water and canned juices that don't need refrigeration. If you are carrying large bottles, take some small plastic cups with you. By using the cups you can share your drinks without sharing someone else's cold and you can avoid putting your mouth on an unclean, unwashed bottle. If you use ice cubes, be sure that they have been made from pure water, not tap water. </p>

<p>The most important thing to remember is to wear shades and a hat and have a good time. Life is beautiful, it's summertime and the livin' is easy-er.</p>

Grilled Shrimp or Chicken with Pasta and Sundried Tomato Salad</b></p>

<P><b>Yield</b>: 6 servings. <b>Prep time</b>: 15 mins. <b>Cooking time</b>: 20 mins.</p>

<p><b>Hint</b>: Prepare everything the day before -- put the ingredients in separate plastic bags -- and store in the refrigerator. Bring everything to the hot grill the next day. Fresh pasta cooks in four minutes -great for the summer. Cook it ahead of time, cool it in cold water and and mix a little oil it in. A hibachi in the park is a good choice for city-folk. Sundried tomatoes are expensive, but Russo's Mozzarella and Pasta Co. on East 11th St. at First Ave. will give you a discount on them if you tell them Consumer News sent you.</p>

<p><b>Facing Racial and Cultural Conflict: Tools for Rebuilding Community</b> (2d ed.) Schoene, Lester P. and DuPraw, Marcelle E., Program for Community Problem Solving, 915 15th St, NW, Suite 600, Washington, D.C. 20005 (89pp $20.00 1994).</p>

<p>The Program for Community Problem Solving's <b>Facing Racial and Cultural Conflict: Tools for Rebuilding Community</b> is a manual on the use of collaborative problem solving techniques to resolve racial and cultural issues. After describing several examples of such conflict in various communities, it sets forth a primary model for collaborative efforts, discussing problem identification and the selection of a process manager to put a collaborative process in place.</p>

<p>The collaborative problem solving model is described in substantial detail. The process of identifying the stakeholders, setting the ground rules, the process, creating solutions and implementing them are all considered. Having set out the basic model in a clear and relatively non-controversial manner, the manual then goes forward to offer a somewhat less usual perspective on the process. It continues by recognizing and discussing the underlying cultural assumptions that infect the basic model and which make it appropriate in particular settings. Five alternative models of collaborative decision making are described: from a New York Latino Community, a gay community in San Francisco, Native people in the urban settings of Hawaii and China, with a discussion in each case of the reasons for the differences that they display.</p>

<p>This is followed by a discussion of how to organize collaborative processes when the group and when the organizer is not of the participating group and when the participants are from different cultural groups or backgrounds. Finally some alternatives that are not based on the collaborative problem solving model are discussed.</p>

<p>This is a well written and well thought out manual. Challenges to majoritarian cultural assumptions are stated clearly but not in such a manner as to promote resistance to their consideration. This is a valuable manual to share with municipal and other governmental agencies who face cultural and racial problems as well as with community organizations. </p>

<p><b>My name is Candido!</b><br>
<i>By Candido Gonzales</i></p>

<p>My name is Candido. When you hear that name again, smile, cause that's who I am. I'm the youngest of four boys. Out of four, three of us are gay. People always say that having brothers who are also gay must be cool. Sometimes it is, because we compete with each other that much more. The four of us are different, yet we all thirst for the same thing, love.</p>

<p>For part of our lives, we were brought up in foster care. While I was there, I was mentally, physically and sexually abused.</p>

<p>On April 11, 1989, they gave me my results. I can't begin to explain what I felt when first I found out that I was infected with the virus (HIV)...I had to learn to make my pain, strength -- my fear, comfort. I've done so many things in my life that were wrong, but I'm still here, so there had to be something that was right. I was taught how to be strong by my mother. No matter what we threw at her, she was there to help. She has been my strength and my light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago my mother and I decided to go and see the AIDS Memorial Quilt. A young boy from the Harlem Boy's Choir began to sing that Bette Midler song -- "Hero."</p>

<p>I began to cry. My mother wiped the tears from my eyes and, held me. A woman who had been watching us, also began to cry. My mother let go of me and embraced her. Then, she brought her to me and the three of us held each other and cried while the little boy sang.</p>

<p>April 19, 1993. My mother asked me to consign a health proxy for her, it was at this time that I was told that she had recently been diagnosed with full-blown AIDS. No tears, no pain, no questions, I was numb...I scared myself...Alone at home -- confusion -- denial. I have to help. Between tears and anger I began to write:</p>

<p>Mother, we shared our laughter And we shared our tears... Now, we share our fears... You've empowered me with the knowledge of survival, Stand, Fight, Live you told me. So I tell you... If you find yourself falling victim to what's been dealt to us, Stand, cause I'm right behind you. And if the tears of sorrow find home in your eyes, Wipe them away, we only have room for laughter there's something between us, I call it love, and it allows us no other choice but to live...</p>

<p>Today with the help of my brother David, we prepare... Though I tell her every day -- I hope she can still understand -- when I tell her, she's my hero.</p>

<p><b>Metro</b><br>
Consumer News has learned that there are major problems with New York City Transit Authority's Access-a-Ride Program. This service for persons with disabling illnesses was mandated by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. Disabled travelers who can sit upright and cannot easily access the subway can call for car service to anywhere in the city for the price of a subway token. It is a vital service to PWAs who wish to remain connected to the community. Medicaid covers ambulette transportation to medical appointments and day programs but not elsewhere.</p>

<p>Since the American Ambulette Corporation took over last year, the Office of the Public Advocate for the City of New York, Mark Green, has been inundated with complaints. Wheelchair users and those who have difficulty ambulating, have been stranded for hours on the street or have vainly waited for pickup from their homes. Green says the company should never have gained the contract, based on their lamentable past track record in Westchester. The county authority there terminated their contract two years ago. American Ambulette Corp. disputes these reports and label's them as normal adjustment problems...</p>

<p>In a related transportation program for the disabled, New York State has announced new guidelines for pre-approved ambulette service between clinics and patients' homes. Medicaid will only pay for rides within a five mile radius of the medical facility. This means that if you are a patient at a downtown hospital e.g. Cabrini, St. Vincent's or Beth Israel, and you live in Harlem, the Bronx, Brooklyn (beyond Bushwick) most of Queens or Staten Island you may be forced to change hospitals or rely upon public transportation. Prior approval must also be obtained if you need an escort, home attendant, friend or family member to travel with you.</p>

<p>There is mention of a waver if you have a long term relationship with a physician. Payments to Ambulette companies will be halved. The new regulations are slated to take effect June 1, 1996, but already groups representing the disabled, and metropolitan area private hospitals have filed a suit for a court injunction that will likely hold up implementation...</p>

<p>According to the New York Times in a recent series of articles headlined: "Mayor's Stalled Plans, Leave Public Hospitals in Trauma," we learned of deteriorating care as the Giuliani Administration downsizes City medical centers. Lack of funding and staff layoffs have resulted in patients going unwashed and without changes in bedding at Queen's Hospital, the closing of x-ray units for three of five days at Jacobi Medical Center and long waits for AIDS patients at North Central Bronx Hospital as doctors see fifteen patients a day, up from eight this time last year. Says Howard Berliner, Professor of Health Policy at The New School for Social Research, "the idea that you can strip the budget and get rid of staff and the quality will stay the same is ludicrous." Maria Mitchell, the Mayor's point person on health, disputes the criticism and states that a tough fiscal policy will "strengthen these hospitals. Access to care has improved dramatically at the Health and Hospital Corporation." Mitchell is the chairperson of the agency that oversees the City's public hospital system...</p>

GMHC In Brief, May 22, 1996, reports on Newborn Screening. A Manhattan Supreme Court judge held a hearing last week regarding proposed New York State newborn screening regulations. Attorneys challenging the regulations report that they scored big points. Testifying in defense of the regulations for NYS DOH, Keith Kranski, M.D., admitted on cross examination that it was very difficult to imagine circumstances that would justify emergency testing. He also distanced himself from controversial language on the refusal form, explaining he had not reviewed this language and wouldn't have chosen it. Testifying against the regulations, Herman Mendez, M.D., noted that the proposed form for consent would hinder crucial HIV counseling during prenatal care and at the time of delivery. Attorneys argued that the State should attempt a less coercive approach before implementing the regulations such as mandatory HIV counseling of mothers without either a signed refusal or emergency testing. The judge will soon decide whether to issue a preliminary injunction...</p>

<p><b>Nation</b><br>
After much delay renewed the Ryan White Care Act extending Federal AIDS assistance for a period of five years. Allocations for FY 96 authorizes $391.7 million for emergency assistance to hardest hit cities; $206.8 million in grants to States; $56.9 million for early intervention programs run by not-for-profits; and $29 million earmarked for services to women and children. The Bill faced contention from Republican members of Congress, specifically around the issue of mandatory HIV testing of newborns. The compromised bill stresses voluntary counseling and testing and treatment for pregnant women. States must report significant reduction in transmission of the virus from mothers to newborns by the year 2000 to escape the mandatory testing clause. There is concern that States may make testing mandatory out of fear of losing Ryan White Funding, because the legislation's wording is so confusing... The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 85 percent of the 17,686 cases reported in 1995 among heterosexual men, and 66 percent of the 10,777 cases among women were linked to IV drug use. Sexual transmission of the virus among gay people accounts for the majority of cases. There is a significant rise in this group among men under 25 years of age.</p>

<p>The Dismantling of Medicaid through the "Medicaid Transformation Act of 1995</p>

<ul>
<li>Elimination of Medicaid as an entitlement by establishing a mega-block grant 

<li>Cuts in Medicaid spending by $182 billion over seven years 

<li>Transfer responsibility to states to make decisions about who should lose Medicaid coverage, which benefits should be eliminated, and which providers should be paid less 
</ul>

<p><b>Status of the Medicaid Transformation Act of 1995</b><br>
By printing time, the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate had passed the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995 which contained the Medicaid Transformation Act of 1995. On October 26, 1995, the measure was approved by the House by a vote of 227 to 203 and the Senate passed the bill by a vote of 52 to 47 on October 27. Both bills require that Medicaid be converted into a block grant for the states, which the National Minority AIDS Council (NMAC) opposes. The bills differ on how the MediGrant would operate in the States. For example, the Senate version would require:</p>

<ul>
<li>States to cover pregnant women, children ages 12 or under and disabled persons

<li>Federal nursing home standards would be maintained

<li>An additional $12 billion would be allocated for Medicaid expenditures for Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, South Carolina, Vermont and the state of Washington. 
</ul>

<p>None of these provisions are contained in the House Version The legislation now moves to a House/Senate conference where differences between the two bills will be addressed. Following the conference, the bill will be reported to the House and Senate for a vote on the conference bill and if it passes, it will be sent to the President for his signature. The President has threatened to veto the bill, which NMAC supports. If this occurs, the legislative process will begin again at the subcommittee-level of the House and Senate Committees which have jurisdiction. </p>

Upon completion of the instruction, Masaico, the Master Chef who trained me in the art of sushi, said, "In America if one or two people get sick each year, you're a good chef. In Japan, you are a good chef if only two or three people die." He told me this to illustrate the dangers of food and the responsibilities of those who handle it. Diners tell their chef's to "feed me." They have no need for menus -- they've come to trust their chefs. He continued, "the Emperor is forbidden to eat blowfish (most parts of this fish's skin and some of the flesh is poison), except when prepared by his personal sushi chef under much security -- once each year." Here, Masaico tells me the importance of establishing good trusting, but guarded, relationships with the people who play a part in the things that you put in your body and your life. If you take this as metaphor, its implications bring you away from the table. Think of the emperor, sushi, and the sushi chef when you consider housing, government, education, etc. Get to know your butcher, fish-monger, produce person, and grocer. Talk to them about your dietary concerns and be loyal to them. If you build a relationship with them, you will find that they will do what good businesspersons do...look out for you. Proceed with caution and make good choices among reputable merchants. Remember, like your primary care physician and nutritionist, evaluate the information from the butcher, the grocer, and the monger, as if your life depends on it. </p>

<p>Although, we who know HIV/AIDS have been vigilant, we have underestimated the extent to which the uninformed and the cruel have united to dismantle the largest health care safety line for people living with HIV/AIDS -- Medicaid. But how did we get to this point of considering proposals that will have the effect of denying entitlement to health care services for those who need assistance most -- the poor, disabled, and elderly members of our society who have no other options but to get sicker quicker and die prematurely? In pursuit of the elusive balanced budget and tax breaks for those who don't need them, we have compromised the integrity of our nation. It is truly a sad day. But, perhaps, at some deep, subconscious level there is an acknowledgement that something is terribly wrong with this picture, that we do understand that the vitality of a nation is determined by the health and productivity of its members. However, in order to move beyond rhetoric, fantasy and denial about the human implications of proposals to reform Medicaid, we must first understand how the budget got so out of whack in the first place. </p>

<p><b>Fixation on the Budget Deficit</b><br>
<b>Tax Cuts</b><br>
The federal government did not have to increase its borrowing rate in the 1980s to pay for additional spending on programs and services. On the contrary, the government borrowed heavily-to pay for the corporate and upper-income tax cuts that it enacted, particularly, the 1981 Kemp/Roth tax bill, which instituted the Reagan "supply-side" agenda. The supply-siders promised that when America's richest people got a break, everyone else would benefit as well. In truth, of course, exactly the opposite occurred. Rather than rising, incomes stagnated or fell for most family groups. America's national savings rate hit record lows. The trade deficit ballooned to previously unheard of levels. And far from a balanced budget, federal budget deficits soared almost beyond comprehension. Thus, the total 1992 cost of the supply-side tax reductions for the richest million families-adding up the $84 billion tax cut that they enjoyed in 1992 and the $81 billion in interest the government must pay on the debt incurred due to the rich's tax cuts in previous years-comes to a staggering $164 billion which is close to the $182 billion called for in proposed Medicaid cuts. </p>

<p>It is ironic that Senator Roth, co-author of the Reagan tax cut of 1981, has recently become Chairman of the United States Senate Finance Committee and he has already indicated his intention to push for another tax-cut bill. Senator Roth is also leading the charge to dismantle the Medicaid program. </p>

<p><b>Defense Spending</b><br>
Redefining national security to include domestic activities needed to promote America's economic well-being can generate far more jobs than will be lost in the military-industrial establishment. Moreover, in a period of declining military need, defense businesses have five choices to maintain profits: find new markets for their military products, consolidate, downsize, be bought, go out of business. In this regard, we can learn a valuable lesson from Walter Jones. When Walter was asked why he robbed a bank, he said, "that is where the money is." Walter's logic was correct but his vision was short-sighted. Today, the same error is being made by many Pentagon officials and politicians. The difference between the two is that in Walter's case, the consequences of his actions were relatively limited. In the case of arms trafficking, "where the money is," thousands of people in our armed forces, millions of American taxpayers and billions of people around the world--pay for and suffer the consequences of the massive trade in military items. </p>

<p>Currently, one billion dollars in Defense Department spending yields 18,000 direct jobs compared to what one billion dollars will produce in the civilian economy - in energy, 22,000; municipal infrastructure and solid waste management, 23,500 jobs; education 30,000 jobs. Unfortunately, these are elements of the economic debate about which few Americans heard during the 1992 presidential campaign. The true sound bite of that campaign should have been "jobs, jobs, jobs." Additionally, the Pentagon is still receiving more money today than it did before the Reagan years. President Clinton's FY 1996 military budget request is a full $20 billion more in today's dollars than America spent on the military in 1980, prior to the fall of Communism. Despite the absence of any serious threats, military spending is at a rate of $5 billion every week, $700 million a day, $500,000 a minute, and $8,000 a second.</p>

<font size=-1> <p><font size=3><b><a name="church">Our</a> Church Has AIDS Your
Church Has AIDS</b></font><br> <font size=-1>By The Most Reverend Edmund L.
Browning, Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church</font></p>

<p>Just over a decade ago, a ragtag bunch of Episcopalians from San Francisco
took the slogan "Our Church Has AIDS" to the General Convention of the Episcopal
Church. It definitely got peoples attention. Some were offended, others were
confused, but an increasing number embraced the slogan as they embraced their
brothers and sisters in faith who were living    and too quickly dying   from
AIDS. This was not a disease about "those people" out there    it is about "those
people" who sit next to us in the pews, or sing in our choirs, or preach from the
pulpits of the Episcopal Church. And even if they were "out there" somewhere,
they are still our brothers and sisters in humanity.</p>

<p>This was the first Convention at which I presided, having been elected
Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, and I will finish my twelve year term
next year. At my election, I said something that has been embraced by many in our
Church, but especially by gay and lesbian people seeking to live their faith with
integrity in a community that does not always welcome them. I said, "this Church
of ours is open to all. There will be no outcasts!" I meant it then, and I mean
it even more forcefully today. I especially mean it when it comes to people with
HIV and AIDS.</p>

<P>While there is much more we Episcopalians can and must do to make people with
HIV and AIDS feel fully at home    and fully, lovingly, and respectfully cared
for in the Church home    I am proud of what we have accomplished in the last
decade. Our grassroots ministry, The National Episcopal AIDS Coalition is seen by
many as a model of how people and communities of faith can respond to this plague
in our times. At the community level, Episcopal dioceses and parishes are
actively involved in AIDS Housing programs (including Bailey House, Episcopal
Social Services/Praxis Housing Initiatives and others here in New York) in
providing pastoral care, practical support and other vitally needed services.</p>

<p>I am especially pleased that out of our commitment to sound public health and
sound moral theology the Episcopal Church has been seen since the earliest days
of the epidemic as a reliable, accurate and candid source of lifesaving
information on preventing transmission of HIV. We worked with the Federal Centers
of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to make our Teens for AIDS Prevention
(TAP) program available across the church and across the country. We have
published an adult education guide entitled, Being Christian in the Age of AIDS,
and it has been enthusiastically received. We have seen no conflict in providing
factual information that empowers young people to respect the body given them by
their creator    information that preserves precious lives.</p>

<P>We have not forgotten our historic roots as a source of wholeness, however. In
community after community, Episcopal parishes offer regular healing services for
those affected by AIDS. Every Diocese in the Church has an AIDS Commission, and
many are active in providing supportive services, as well as convening interfaith
or ecumenical memorial observances and healing services for the larger community.
We have held far too many AIDS funerals in our parishes, but we thank God for the
witness of those lives among us, and remain committed to going the full distance
with every person with AIDS or HIV who turns to us for comfort on the journey.
Whatever the need is for spiritual direction, a supportive faith community,
pastoral care or a choir to sing in, we are committed to assisting people with
HIV and AIDS to live, fully and wholly.</p>

<p>There's a final word on the witness of the Episcopal Church in the AIDS
pandemic that isn't mine. Warren Buckingham, a person living with AIDS and
appointed by me to the Commission on HIV/AIDS of the Executive Council of the
Church, says that "our church has never    in my experience, anyway    further
'victimized' those of us with AIDS. We are welcomed and accepted, not pitied. We
are put to work in our parishes, in our dioceses, and in the highest councils of
the Church." Speaking for all of us he adds, "We aren't treated like a problem
for the Church, but as an answer. We are the answer to Christ's invitation to
welcome the outcast." I am proud that we have answered this invitation as we
have.</p>

<p>And so we boldly proclaim, "Our Church Has AIDS." Our Church has and loves
people with AIDS. You are invited to be one of them.</p>

<p><font size=3><b><a name="bernie">Bernie</a> Siegel - Saving
Lives</b></font><br> <font size=-1>by Kurt Gottschalk</font></p>

<p>Nearly twenty years ago, a pediatric surgeon in New Haven, Connecticut named
Bernie Siegel set forth on a trail which many would describe as common sense, but
which quickly led to controversy. With simple ideals of love and compassion,
Siegel left the operating room for the Oprah show and controversy or, at best, a
reputation as being outside of and irrelevant to the medical profession. He
preached ideals of understanding, of recognizing the body's own healing powers,
of hugging the sick. And he was, by and large, discounted. </p>

<p>But now some in the medical community are beginning to reconsider that take on
alternative and holistic therapies, and Siegel with three best selling books,
numerous documentary and television appearances and a growing following who
credit him with prolonging or even saving their lives may soon see modern
medicine grow up around him.</p>

<p>It was in 1978 that Siegel formed the group that was to be the backbone of his
approach. Exceptional Cancer Patients, or ECaP, was the product of his
observations of the terminally ill. In short, Siegel wanted to know what made
some people into survivors while others awaited death. Through discussion and
therapy with cancer patients, Siegel developed a process he called
"carefrontation" a controlled and compassionate attempt at confronting individual
fears and facilitating personal change and healing. The body, he said, has a
healing capacity that Western medicine had failed to acknowledge. And, he
believes, through therapy that power can be tapped.</p>

<p>Since then, Siegel has focused on ways to develop in doctors the skills that
they are not taught in the classroom. What patients want from their doctors, he
says, is simple: Say hello and goodbye, look me in the eyes and treat me like a
person. But doctors are just "trained to write prescriptions," he said in an
interview from his New Haven home. "It's very mechanistic. We need to get back to
the people, the people." Such statements didn't get Siegel very far with the
medical establishment in the late 1970s. But recent years have seen greater
numbers of people willing to try so called "alternative" practices in the United
States. And where patients and their pocketbooks go, their doctors, however
slowly, follow.</p>

<p>According to a 1993 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine,
nearly one third of Americans have tried some form of alternative therapy. The
bill for that treatment comes to about $13 billion a year. Couple that with a
1991 Gallup poll which found that almost half of all Americans are only "somewhat
satisfied" or "not at all satisfied" with their medical care, and you can see a
growing trend which, if for fiscal reasons alone, the medical establishment would
do well not to ignore.</p>

<p>But while Americans are showing an increasing interest in alternative
treatments, they are not willing to give up their general practitioner in favor
of an acupuncturist and an herbalist. Nor do Siegel and other alternative
therapists encourage them to. Rather than seeing such practices as exclusive,
they have developed what they call a "complementary" approach, coupling their
methods with drug and surgical treatments to create an overarching treatment
package.</p>

<p>Siegel also points to recent research into chemicals released by the brain
that carry pleasure signals to support his belief that a loving environment can
positively influence the effectiveness of treatments for the terminally ill.</p>

<p>"There are things we make in our body from stress and loving," he explains.
"Your body has a different environment. Why does Monday morning have more heart
attacks and suicides? Animals aren't depressed on Monday morning."</p>

<p>The physical effects of mental attitudes and well being factors from which
Western medicine has spent much of the century retreating are beginning to get
the nod again from mainstream practitioners. Adages like "laughter is the best
medicine" have been prescribed with ambivalence by some doctors and written off
by others. But increased understanding of the power of chemicals like endorphins,
which is released by the brain during sex and when laughing and which has been
demonstrated to reduce anxiety levels, gives new weight to so called old wives'
tales. Music, exercise and relaxation are also being linked to neurochemicals
which are apparent in the bloodstream. Stress and depression are increasingly
being acknowledged as potent inhibitors of neurochemical transmissions. </p>

<p>Recognition of such forces is leading some practitioners to a new acceptance
of holistic approaches and a greater concern for the all around well being of
their patients.</p>

<p>"A lot of things people are talking about today were not in the public range
twenty years ago," according to Tullia Forlani Kidde, a long term cancer
survivor. "There were no hospices, no social workers in hospitals, no groups. Now
you see it everywhere. There's a whole wide range of support."</p>

<p>Forlani Kidde herself is testimony to the power of mental attitude. Diagnosed
twenty years ago with Hodgkin's, she says she was told there was no chance of the
cancer going into remission. But she decided that the treatments she was going
through were not worth the chance of an extra six months of life. So she quit the
prescribed therapy.</p>

<p>"My experience at the time was particularly gruesome and painful," she said.
"Treatments are brutal. I felt if I was meant to live, I'd live. I did a lot of
meditation, a lot of visualization. That was a personal decision that I would
never advise someone else to do unless they felt it was right."</p>

<p>But for her, it seems, it was. She says she has been in remission ever since,
although she refuses tests. Self medication and mental imaging was a course she
developed for herself, but it would eventually lead her to meet and work with
Bernie Siegel. She now runs a support group modeled after ECaP in New Haven for
people with AIDS.</p>

<p>"Bernie is the pioneer of this," she said. "He was the first one to stand up
and say 'there is more than this, there is more than just treatment.' But I think
the society is slowly changing. I don't know one hospital in my area that doesn't
now have a cancer support group."</p>

<p>Ideas like support groups, meditation and acupuncture are beginning to be
accepted as compliments to Western treatments like pharmaceuticals and surgery,
the Siegel philosophy may be finding its place. The mind body connection is not a
new idea but, at least according to Siegel, it's one too long forgotten by too
many doctors. </p>

<p>"When you cut your finger, who heals it?" he asked. "Did you read a book on
healing fingers? No. Be aware of the intelligent energy inside you. If people
want to be well, they need to use their bodies to help them make decisions. What
I believe in is intelligent, loving energy."</p>

Behind</b></font><br> <font size=-1>By Marlene Diaz</font></p>

<p>Imagine your dad dying and then losing your eight year old brother within a
year. Your mom is concerned about DAS (Division of AIDS Services) closing her
case. Although she is HIV positive and symptomatic, current guidelines would not
make you eligible for DAS    leaving you both homeless within a matter of
months.</p>

<p>Tauisha doesn't waver. She lives through the reality, one of sickness,
suffering and death. A lot for a five year old to handle, or understand. AIDS has
stolen the lives of the people closest to her Dad and brother and looms over her
mother.</p>

<p>What can be done for children like Tauisha? Reassurance that she will continue
to have a home, confidence to go to school where the faces are friendly and
familiar. A support system - someone she can trust and share her experiences with
(a counselor). Someone to read a book to her (a buddy), to take her on outings
while mom spends hours at the clinic. A group of children her own age who don't
have to hide or feel ashamed of the fact that someone they love has died of AIDS
related conditions (a peer support group).</p>

<p>Let's work together so that dreams of her graduation from Kindergarten are a
reality. We need a "standard of care" for the families left behind surviving the
devastation of AIDS whether they are five or fifty.</p>

Disease is the Most Significant Obstacle to Successfully Housing and Stabilizing
PWAs</b></font><br> <font size=-1>By K. Lowry</font></p>

<p>If you have substance abuse disease and you are beginning the process of
finding appropriate housing, read this article, it contains some interesting
things you may wish to consider. In several interviews with both public and
private case managers, program directors and social workers a recurrent refrain
is, drugs are the most serious barrier between housing and clients. "We just
don't know what to do with these guys," said one case worker. "They no sooner
clean up and get into a place    within hours of placement    they are back on
drugs." A program director for homeless people noted that in her experience
"Clients we see who test positive for HIV are the most likely to relapse."</p>

<p>"I have a client who came in every day for more than a year," said a DAS case
manager. "I worked very hard with that client to help him to get out of the SRO.
He insisted on coming here day after day, high as a kite. He'd sit in that chair
with his head hanging down to the ground    there was no talking to him    he was
barely able to think, let alone talk. Well he got so bad that he went to
Woodycrest    then, he began to get better, he gained weight, he was even
likeable . . . and funny. A short while ago he went to live with his family, I
begged him not to leave Woodycrest, but he couldn't be convinced. I saw him last
week, sitting in that chair, head down to the floor. It's sad. Now he is very
sick, he is worse than I have ever seen him."</p>

<p>A drug counselor in a private program stated he was never surprised when
people who were living with HIV disease and AIDS relapsed and that he understood
that stress and pressure lead them to it. A DAS case worker said she had
difficulty getting clients into programs, because many housing providers claim
they are not equipped to deal with them. Some case managers do not even refer
them to supportive housing because the moment they are found to relapse the
provider complains and will not accept additional placements from them.</p>

<p>A consensus among housing providers and frontline case workers and health care
professionals who work directly with PWAs is that substance abuse is the most
significant obstacle to successfully housing and stabilizing the physical and
mental health of PWAs. The struggle with substance abuse is a difficult one, one
fought with different approaches and with varied results. Housing providers and
advocates who have met with HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros have insisted that
supportive services are necessary for client and program stability. All the
contracts the City has with the several community based organizations to provide
supportive housing include funds for supportive services, including substance
abuse. The problem is there is a broad range of approaches and no guarantee that
any of them work. Among the CBOs, there are supporters of everything from Twelve
step programs, to harm reduction/needle exchange, to acupuncture, to wishing the
laws away, and they have strong convictions about the promise of the success or
failure of each. Whatever philosophy one subscribes to, there is one thing that
all can agree upon: If you don't want to stop, you won't - unless you are
stopped. </p>

<p>You have no doubt heard all the rhetoric about substance abuse, so it won't be
repeated here. But if you want to live, you have to stop helping AIDS take your
life. Alcohol, drugs, unsafe sex and AIDS are lethal combinations. If you want to
access good housing and keep it, you have to help and probably get help. There
are several providers of transitional and permanent supportive housing who have
had good relationships with persons who have substance abuse concerns, some of
the ones to look into are: Foundation for Research on STDs, McBurney House, The
Paradise, The Concourse, The St. Nicholas Praxis, Stand Up Harlem, and Housing
Works. But again you have to help.</p>

<p>Things change every day and so can you. Programs have fluctuations like you
will. If you have difficulty with an Agency or DAS call an advocate or contact
the Conflict Resolution Project to put you in touch with an advocate who has
experience with people who have similar problems. Good case managers burn out all
the time    it is a difficult job. Work with them and ask them to help you define
your needs. Having AIDS is no reason to end your life. Don't let the
disappointment of AIDS overwhelm you and lead you to relapse. Doubt that it is
"understandable." It is not! It's killing you! People do not relapse because they
have HIV/AIDS - they relapse because they are drug addicts and alcoholics.</p>

<p>Consumer News recommends that you follow these steps: </p>

<ul> <li>If you are abusing drugs, stop. If you have substance abuse disease, you
will need help. Speak with your case manager or a counselor to help you find a
suitable drug detox unit and/or treatment program. <br> <li>Look for groups that
establish reasonable standards with very structured programs and have a history
of producing results. <br> <li>Complete the Division of AIDS Service Housing
Application <br> <li>Ask your case manger to forward the application to the DAS
Housing Unit. <br> <li>Ask your DAS case manager to forward the application to
the housing providers you have determined are right for you. <br> <li>Once an

<p><font size=3><b><a name="health">Health</a> Care</b><br> <b>Protease
Inhibitors - The Cost of AIDS Drugs</b></font><br> <font size=-1>by Kurt
Gottschalk</font></p>

<p>The age of AIDS up to now might well be characterized as a wait against hope
for miracle drugs. The first ten years of the epidemic saw only one major
medication, AZT, make it to the marketplace. In the last six months, however, two
new classes of antiviral medication have been approved by the FDA. And now, for
the nearly 75,000 new AIDS cases reported in the United States last year alone,
there comes a new obstacle: the basic law of supply and demand.</p>

<p>The first few months of 1996 marked two of the most significant developments
the AIDS community has yet seen. The development and record speed approval of a
new class of anti viral drugs, called <a
href="../../network/simple/protease.html">protease inhibitors</a>, came on the heels
of the approval of <a href="../../network/simple/three.html">3TC</a>, a new
antiviral medication. But with the announcement of the new drug came questions of
access and challenges to the policies of government agencies and pharmaceutical
companies.</p>

<p>At the same time that the new protease inhibitors were approaching the
marketplace, Congressional cuts to the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, or ADAP,
pulled over 100 drugs from the docket of prescriptions paid for with federal
funds. With Congressional budget debates causing repeated shutdowns of the
federal government, new appropriations are still uncertain and funds providing
drugs to low income people with AIDS are up in the air. Meanwhile, ADAP programs
in Missouri and Colorado have gone bankrupt. Illinois, Pennsylvania and
Connecticut are the only states that have guaranteed to cover protease inhibitor
costs under their ADAP programs.</p>

<p>Protease inhibitors mark the first significant step in AIDS drug therapy since
AZT hit the market in the early '80s. The introduction of the drug comes at a
time when many clinicians are shifting the focus of their prognoses from the
number of T cells, which the body uses to fight off antigens in the blood stream,
to viral load. Another new innovation is the <a
href="../../network/simple/viral.html">viral load test</a> which gives a count of
the number of AIDS virus cells present in the bloodstream at a given time. With a
more accurate viral load picture, physicians may be able to tailor treatment more
closely to an individual patient's needs. The tests have not yet been granted FDA
approval.</p>

<p>The test will also help to determine the efficacy of the new protease
inhibitors. In clinical trials, protease inhibitors have demonstrated a
remarkable capacity to decrease viral load. By attacking the protease enzyme,
which the AIDS virus uses to replicate itself, protease inhibitors are able to
limit the virus' reproductive abilities, thereby bringing down the total viral
load. In March, the Federal Drug Administration acted on the promise of the
trials by approving Abbott Laboratories' drug, <a
href="../../network/simple/riton.html">Ritonavir</a>, in just 72 days the fastest
approval proceeding in the Administration's history. Two weeks later, the FDA
announced the approval of Merck Lab's <a
href="../../network/simple/indi.html">Crixivan</a>, a mere 42 days after
application. </p>

<p>But the FDA's rapid approval, along with the high demand for the drug, has
cornered pharmaceutical companies into devising ways to distribute a drug for
which the demand, at least for now, far exceeds the supply.</p>

<p>The approval of Crixivan, which is widely considered to be the best of the
three drugs (Hoffmann LaRoche was the first to win approval of a protease
inhibitor with its version, <a href="../../network/simple/saquin.html">Invirase</a>)
came six months faster than expected, according to a Merck representative. The
speedy approval left them in the position of not having enough product for
adequate distribution. Merck manufacturing plants are being expanded in Elkton,
Virginia, and Albany, Georgia, to increase the production of Crixivan. But the
expansion isn't expected to be completed until fall. </p>

<p>In the meantime, distribution of Crixivan is being handled by Stadtlander's
Pharmacy, a mail order supplier based in Pittsburgh. But the decision to market
the drug through a single distributor has led to criticism from New York
pharmacies, who complain about the Stadtlander's 36 percent mark up, and
California outlets, who fear uneven distribution from an East Coast company.</p>

<p>For their part, Merck denies that distribution of their drug will be anything
but fair, even while they are gearing up for full production. "I think the reason
we selected to go through a single distributor on a temporary basis is because
the drug is so difficult to make," according to Merck representative Michael
Watts. While they have such a limited supply to work with, he said, they need to
make sure that people who begin the therapy have a sufficient supply. As with
drugs like <a href="../../network/access/drugs/ison.html">INH</a>, given to people
with tuberculosis, starting and stopping the treatment can enable the antigen to
mutate and develop an immunity, not only rendering the drug ineffective for the
patient but also creating a new, drug resistant strain of the disease.</p>

<p>"Going through one distributor is not just a matter of tracking who's on it,"
Watts added, "but we can track the amount of drug we have."</p>

<p>Further spurring questions of access to the new drugs is the recent round of
cuts to the federal ADAP program, which covers costs of prescriptions to people
with AIDS that can't afford the often prohibitive price tags put on many HIV
medications. On January 1, <a href="../../network/access/states/ny/ny.html">New York
State's ADAP</a> budget was cut by 70 percent. That cut resulted in the <a
href="../../network/access/states/ny/removed.html">elimination</a> of about 130
drugs from the list of medications covered by the program for approximately
60,000 recipients across the country. Ten thousand recipients of ADAP benefits
live in New York State; sixty percent of them earn less than $10,000 a year. </p>

<p>But the excitement over new drugs led to an unusual coalition of AIDS advocacy
groups, elected representatives and pharmaceutical companies who lobbied Congress
to restore the funds. The result is a $52 million pledge by President Bill
Clinton that the organizers say is all but guaranteed for approval under the new
budget. Between $7 and 9 million of that will go to New York State.</p>

<p>Protease inhibitors were prioritized over other drugs in the New York State
Committee. But even with the promise of the drug, the choice is a costly one. A
year ago, an individual patient would have been taking only a single anti viral
drug, AZT, at a cost of about $2,500 a year. But some studies are showing
protease inhibitors to work best in combination with other anti viral drugs.
Today, a patient may take not only AZT but also 3TC, costing another $2,500 a
year, as well as a protease inhibitor, which may cost as much as $7,000 a year.
On top of that is the cost of less expensive medications for other infections,
like the antibiotics that were covered by ADAP until earlier this year. According
to a study by the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, the total HIV care price tag,
including drug combination therapy (but not counting possible acute care costs)
may soon be as much as $25,000 a year.</p>

<p><i>(For comparision chart, see <a href="../../pwahg/notes/32.html#protease">Notes
from the Underground 32</a>)</i></p>

<p>Merck and other companies do offer drugs to some people at reduced rates, or
occasionally for free, but these programs do not generally reach a large number
of people. Merck's "SUPPORT" program primarily helps patients "identify and apply
for additional insurance," according to Watts. "In cases where it warrants,
eligible patients can also get Crixivan for free until other coverages becomes
available." </p>

<p>But even if funding is approved, that will "probably not cover all the
problems of New York State," according to Derek Link, an Assistant Director at
Gay Men's Health Crisis, one of the organizations involved in the lobbying
efforts. "The federal money may pay for protease inhibitors in New York, but it's
unclear how many people will want them."</p>

<p>"We want all of the drugs cut on January 1 restored," Link said. "Drugs that
are not as sexy as protease inhibitors are also needed."</p>

<p>But even if ADAP cuts are restored to include all of the drugs eliminated from
coverage last January, as well as protease inhibitor treatment, price structures
may still be a problem. And some analysts contend that it is the pharmaceutical
companies who are, at least in part, to be held culpable for high drug costs.</p>

<p>Peter Arno is one such critic. A medical economist associated with Albert
Einstein Hospital and Montefiore Medical Center in New York, Arno was one of a
group of researchers and AIDS advocates pushing for pharmaceutical reform under
President Clinton's National Health Care Act in 1993. Since then, he says, he has
seen efforts to control drug prices backslide.</p>

<P>"Fifty million dollars is a drop in the bucket when it comes to people
demanding the drugs," Arno said, referring to the White House pledge. "You can't
go lobbying Congress every time a new drug comes along."</p>

<p>With the Working Group on Pharmaceuticals and National Health Care Reform, an
independent committee of academics, advocates and policy makers, Arno has been
pushing for government controls on pharmaceutical pricing. And while granting
that research and development costs cannot be overlooked, he says that the
industry is still too profit oriented when lives are at stake.</p>

<p>Over the last several years, the pharmaceutical industry has become one of the
nation's biggest money makers. According to Fortune 500 listings, it was the most
profitable every year from 1988 to 1994. It has been ranked as first or second
most profitable in 30 of the last 38 years. Merck alone enjoyed a net income of
over $3 billion in 1995, up eleven percent from the previous year. According to a
1994 United Kingdom Department of Health study, drug prices through much of
Europe average 4 to 78 percent lower then in the U.S. </p>

<p>And with the bulk of medications, especially those for people with HIV, being
paid for by government agencies like Medicaid, Medicare and the Veteran's
Administration, Arno believes the government is in a good position to exert some
control over drug company pricing.</p>

<p>"People say the market will bring down the price of drugs," he said, and I
think that's true. But it still may be prohibitive.</p>

<p>"Maybe they ought not rely on that when it's drugs that are needed for life
and death. Why are they the most profitable industry in the United States?"</p>

<p>He paused and answered himself. "It's profits, my man. Profits."</p>

<p><font size=3><b><a name="conflict">Conflict</a> Resolution<br> Medicaid
Managed Care</b></font><br> <font size=-1>By Lauren Shapiro and Domenique
Ghossein</font></p>

<p><b>Why Should I be Concerned About Medicaid Managed Care?</b><br>

The State and City are trying to enroll as many people as possible in managed
care, and managed care representatives are located at welfare centers.</p>

<p>The State wants to make managed care mandatory. At this time, they need
permission from the federal government to do this, and the federal government has
not approved it with the exception of a part of Brooklyn.</p>

<p>The State is creating Special Needs Plans for HIV infected people. HIV
infected people will then be allowed to choose between Special Needs Plans
(SNP's) and regular managed care.</p>

<p><b>Who is required to Join A Managed Care Plan?</b><br>

In most parts of the City, you do not have to join a managed care plan. It is
your choice. The City has started to enroll people at Department of Social
Services (DSS) centers, but this process is voluntary and you should know the
facts before you decide to enroll. You may be required to join a managed care
plan if you receive AFDC and live in one of the following zip codes: 11209,
11214, 11218, 11219, 11220, 11223, 11224, 11228, 11232, 11235.</p>

<p>There are exceptions to this rule. You may be excused from joining a managed
care plan if you already have a long term relationship (more than one year) with
a doctor and you do not want to leave that doctor's care. You can also be excused
if you have a chronic health condition and have an existing relationship with a
doctor (it doesn't matter how long). Other reasons for exemption include
enrollment in a substance abuse or mental health program and [an unmanageable]
distance of the managed care provider from your home.</p>

<p>You can get an exemption by having your doctor fill out a form provided by the
Educational Enrollment Unit (EEU), set up at certain welfare centers.</p>

<p><b>Services Not Covered by Your Plan</b><br>

Some plans do not offer some kinds of services. For example, many plans do not
include dental care, home care or mental health services. This does not mean that
you cannot get these services if you join the plan. Categories of services not
covered by the plan can still be obtained by using your old Medicaid card. So,
for example, if you are in a drug rehabilitation program, and the managed care
program does not cover this service, you should keep your Medicaid card and use
it for the rehabilitation program. Your Medicaid card will stay active. Methadone
Maintenance Programs can also be accessed outside of a managed care plan by using
your Medicaid card. However, you must be careful. Not every service currently
available under Medicaid will be provided. For example, if you are seeing a
therapist twice a week, and your managed care program says you only need one,
Medicaid will not cover one visit.</p>

<p><b>Disenrollment - getting out of your plan</b><br>

If you are unhappy with your managed care plan and you want to switch to another
plan or return to fee for service Medicaid, you have to follow certain
procedures.</p>

<p><b>Voluntary enrollment</b><br> If you have voluntarily enrolled in a managed
care program, you may disenroll anytime for any reason. If the plan has a "lock
in" period, you can only disenroll for good cause for a certain amount of time.
(Good cause means that the plan has failed to meet your needs by giving you
accessible, appropriate, and high quality medical care). You can also disenroll
on an expedited basis if they misled you when you enrolled. For example, some
plans told clients that their Medicaid card would expire or told them they had to
enroll.</p>

<p><b>Mandatory enrollment</b><br> If you live in one of the Brooklyn zip codes
listed above and you are in a mandatory managed care program, your ability to
disenroll is limited. However, if you are not getting the care that you need, you
can also follow the procedure for disenrollment.</p>

<p><b>How to disenroll</b></p> <ol> <li>Go to the EEU at an Income Maintenance
(I.M.) center (a.k.a. welfare center) and sign a disenrollment form.

<li>If you are unable to go to the EEU, call the City's Helpline at (800) 505
5678.

<li>If you are having problems with the EEU, call the client services office:
(212) 941 5112.

<li>Call an advocate if you are having trouble. </ol>

<p><b>Confidentiality</b><br>

New York's confidentiality laws prohibit health care providers from disclosing
your HIV status to anyone without your written consent, unless it is necessary to
provide appropriate medical care and treatment. This law binds managed care
organizations.</p>

<p><b>Where Can I Go for More Information or Help with Problems Relating to
Medical Treatment?</b><br>

Your Plan. If you are already enrolled in a managed care plan, you should always
go to your plan first with questions or complaints. Check your members' handbook
to find out how to reach a representative for your plan.</p>

<p><b>The EEUs</b>. If you are not in a plan or are not happy with your plan's
response to your questions or complaints, you should speak with a Health Educator
at one of the EEUs. Health Educators not only provide you with information about
your plan, they also should help resolve disputes between you and your plan. If
you are not happy with the service you receive from an EEU, you should contact
the central office in charge of all EEUs: Medicaid Managed Care Client Services
Office: (212) 941 5112.</p>

<p>For general information about Medicaid Managed Care, call the HRA Helpline:
(800) 505 5678</p>

<p><b>Your Right to Appeal</b>. You have a right to appeal decisions made by your
plan with which you disagree. For example, if your plan terminated your
participation involuntarily, they refused you an exemption, they refused to
authorize a certain treatment, or to pay for services you have received. The way
you appeal a decision depends on what kind of issue is in dispute. If you are
unable to resolve your problems through your plan or the EEU's, you have a right
to a Fair Hearing. Your local Legal Services or Legal Aid office can give you
more information about your right to appeal.</p>

<p><b>Quality of Care Complaints</b>. If you are unhappy with the quality of care
you receive from your plan, file a complaint with the New York State Department
of Health (DOH) New York City Area Office: (212) 613 4900.</p>

<p>DOH is the state agency in charge of monitoring the managed care plans to make
sure that they are providing you with high quality medical care. It is important
that you report your problems to DOH so that they can take action against plans
that are not doing their job.</p>

<p>Filing a complaint with DOH does not replace an appeal, and may not be the
best way to get your immediate problem fixed. DOH should help you in an emergency
 -  for example, if your plan is refusing to provide you with treatment that you
need immediately. But it is usually better to file a complaint with DOH and
pursue a separate appeal at the same time.</p>

<p>If you want help with filing a complaint with DOH, call:

<ul> <li>The Patient's Rights Hotline at (212) 316 9393, Monday through Friday
10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. <li>Brooklyn Legal Services, HIV Unit: (718) 237 5546

HIV</b></font><br> <font size=-1>By Edwin Krales, Nutritionist/Outreach
Coordinator, The Momentum AIDS Project, Adjunct Professor of Nutrition Hunter
College</font></p>

<p>Aging is a process that begins at birth, not something that begins on our
fiftieth birthday. If we are lucky, we get to take part in that process for a
long time. Some people manage to keep the process going for 90 to 100 years.
Others of us aren't so lucky. Aging is measured by time passing, but all of our
clocks are not running at the same speed. Some people become old and frail at 40,
while others stay young and vigorous until they die at 90.</p>

<p>There are three elements that contribute to the speed of our individual
clocks. The first is our genetic or individual makeup, the second is human aging
as a group or a species and the third is environmental factors. Few of us know
what our individual genetic composition is, and there is therefore very little we
can do about it. At this stage of our understanding, blaming our problems on our
imagined genetic composition is more like making an excuse for not trying to do
better than offering a scientific explanation. How we age as a species is
important, but it is also out of our individual control. Understanding the stages
we pass through, such as crawling, walking, reaching peak muscle mass and losing
bone density, gives us a yardstick to measure ourselves against. The
environmental factors, such as our diets, our exercise habits, the way we manage
stress, our use of medical and dental facilities and our social and work lives,
are the issues we have some control over. Simply put, the better we take care of
ourselves, the better off we will be as we age.</p>

<p>One of the environmental factors that affects us in the aging process is
illness. Although an illness has parameters and does not have a single defined
impact unless it kills us immediately, how we deal with the illness is very much
under our control. HIV is such an illness. A person can deal with HIV disease
either as an old 40 year old or a young 90 year old. Our aim should be to try to
eliminate all the non HIV related problems that we confront daily and concentrate
on improving the quality of our lives. For example, we should stop using
recreational drugs, stop drinking alcohol and stop smoking tobacco. What we
should do is take part in some sort of stress reduction activity like yoga, do
some kind of physical activity and try to get enough sleep. </p>

<p>Nutrition is a key factor in the aging process and a key issue in dealing with
HIV. How the problems of aging and the problems of HIV mesh is important to
understand. One of the most common misunderstandings is misinterpreting a
nutritional or an aging problem as an HIV related illness. The two may look the
same, but their roots and solutions are quite different. For example, we tend to
exercise less and less as we age, resulting in the loss of muscle mass. This is
not HIV wasting syndrome at work; it is lifestyle. Older people are not expected
to be active or dynamic, especially not sexy. They are expected to sit at home in
front of the TV and knit. However, if we were to pick the single factor that has
the most dramatic impact on an older person's life, it would be muscle mass. Good
muscle mass has a positive effect on appetite, metabolism, the working of
insulin, energy level, breathing, ease of movement and self esteem. If HIV
wasting syndrome attacks an older body that is well muscled, the person will have
a much better chance of withstanding that attack before it does harm. </p>

<p>Other symptoms that could be mistaken for symptoms of HIV disease are caused
by nutrient deficiencies, for example, inadequate Vitamin B12, folate and Vitamin
E. In the case of Vitamin B12, inadequate intake may not be the culprit. Unless a
person is a strict vegetarian who doesn't eat any animal products that are high
in Vitamin B12, he or she will usually get enough in the daily diet. The first
problem is that aging stomachs don't secrete enough gastric acid or a gastric
hormone called pepsin to break the bond between the animal protein and the B12.
The second part of this equation is that the lack of gastric acid in the stomach
allows the overgrowth of bacteria. This bacteria needs B12 for its own health,
and it competes for the available B12 being released. Gastric bacteria can also
set the stage for the beginnings of a gastric ulcer, which will further cut back
on the stomach's ability to digest food properly. </p>

<p>The lack of Vitamin B12 has serious consequences. The covering of certain
nerves in the peripheral and the central nervous systems is made up of myelin.
Myelin is an insulator that helps move impulses along the nerve. Without adequate
B12, the production of myelin is damaged, and nerve impulses don't move as well
as they should. This could lead to poor balance, neuropathy in the hands and
feet, confused thinking and dementia. </p>

<p>Lack of folate can contribute to anemia and depression. It is also believed
that a folate deficiency can contribute to increased homocysteine levels.
Homocysteine is an intermediate form of the amino acid methionine (an essential
component of our diet) on its way to becoming cysteine, another amino acid. An
elevated homocysteine level is considered a risk for both heart disease and
stroke. </p>

<p>Vitamin E belongs to the famous class of nutrients called antioxidants. Simply
put, Vitamin E helps to reverse the age related decline in T cell response to
infection. It does this by destroying free radicals that can attack T cells.</p>

<p>Two other nutrients that contribute to improved immune response are zinc and
protein. Does adequate nutrition mean that if some is good, more is better? No.
In fact, too much of an essential nutrient can be toxic. Too much zinc, for
example, impairs immune function. Too much protein can contribute to kidney
failure, and too much vitamin A can damage the liver.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, it is very difficult when eating a mixed and varied diet
to overdose on any one nutrient. There are three notable exceptions: salt,
protein and Vitamin A. The Innuit knew that vitamin A stores increase as we get
older. They also knew that old polar bear livers contained toxic levels of
Vitamin A. So if they had these symptoms  nosebleeds; incessant headaches and
pressure inside the head; blurred vision; dry, rashy skin; cramps; nausea;
vomiting; diarrhea; weight loss; tiredness and irritability  they knew that the
polar bear liver and onions they had had the night before was too old. They knew
they had overdosed on Vitamin A.</p>

<p>It is too easy to blame all our ills on HIV. Sorting problems into their
proper categories helps us to deal with them better. Improving our nutritional
and age related problems frees our immune system to fight the hardest battle, the
one against HIV. As we age, we must continue to exercise, remain socially active,
work at stress reduction, eat a varied diet, take a multivitamin/mineral
supplement daily and keep in touch with our health care providers, and our
nutritionists.</p>

<p>When you need to thaw foods it is best to thaw it in the refrigerator over
night (a large turkey will take several days). This is the best way to thaw large
pieces of meat. We do not always plan ahead and sometimes it is necessary to thaw
small amounts of food in a hurry (one to two hours). Keep the food in its plastic
package or wrap it in plastic wrap. Put the package in a pan and run cold water
over it. This will prevent bacteria from growing and the food from poaching.</p>

<p><b>The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love</b><br>

For a first effort major motion picture directing debut (as well as writing and
producing), Maria Maggenti has performed admirably in this sweet and honest love
story. Two Girls is the story of Randy (played charmingly by Laurel Holloman who,
by the way, has one of the most infectious smiles I've seen in a long time), an
idealistic 17 year old high school girl, who lives with her lesbian aunt and her
lover, the two of whom own and run a gas station in small town U.S.A. It is a
coming of age story and what is novel about this is that even though it is about
a young lesbian coming of age, it is remarkably universal. This could have been a
boy meets girl, boy meets boy or girl meets boy story and it would have been
equally as engaging. It is basically about first love. Told in a straight
forward, no frills manner, we almost eavesdrop on these "typical, normal lesbos"
lives as they discover (along with Randy) the perils of young love. Randy falls
head over heels for Evie (played very well indeed by the deliciously attractive
Nicole Parker), a privileged, well educated young black high school contemporary.
Although the cultural and social differences between the two are not fully
examined in this film, the experience of first love (and first lesbian love in
the case of Evie) are explored fully. There are delightful comic turns as the two
girls' families and friends collide while trying to help prepare Randy and Evie
for the cold cruel world adult lesbians will have to face. An especially good
comedic performance is turned in by Stephanie Berry as Evie's divorced mother.
</p>

<p>Although there are some quirky camera angles which appear to be included for
no apparent dramatic reason, this film is a delightful directorial debut for Ms.
Maggenti which results in a sweet and charming love story for us video junkies.
And, by the way, congratulations to Ms. Maggenti for one of the most tastefully
erotic love scenes on film. As innocently presented as the love it represents. I
truly enjoyed this endearing little comedy and I'm sure you will too.</p>

<p>A film I did not enjoy, however, was <b>Desperado</b>, starring Antonio
Banderas and produced, written and directed by Robert Rodriguez. This is one of
the most gratuitously violent and bloody films I've ever witnessed. Blood flows
by the tanker truck loads and hundreds of men get shot or stabbed and killed.
That not being bad enough, Mr Rodriguez feels compelled to enhance the image of
death by adding special effects and slow motion shots of men's brains being blow
out, etc., etc. Enough already! Banderas plays a brooding Mexican guitar playing
drifter who is avenging the death of his "one true love." In his travels to kill
the man responsible, he manages to kill everyone else in sight who is not a
beautiful woman or a child (he has some scruples, I guess). This man has more
weaponry than the entire Mexican government and can store it all in his sleeves
and guitar case. I suppose this was an attempt to restore the macho image of
Banderas after playing Tom Hanks' love in Philadelphia, but what good will it do
when no one sees the movie. Rodriguez couldn't decide if Banderas was a comic
book hero or a film hero. The result is a big waste of celluloid and a waste of
the talents of Banderas and Salma Hayek, a remarkably beautiful actress who helps
Banderas in his killer quest. I get the feeling Mr. Rodriguez once produced film
trailers since this film is shot like a series of trailers (or commercials) run
together. No cohesive story or (heaven forbid) character development; just blood
and guts. There was one thing I did enjoy about this movie. It made me nostalgic
for drive ins. This is perfect fodder for make out madness at the drive in: a
movie you don't have to watch to enjoy and best seen through a foggy windshield.

<p><b>Jeffrey</b>, based on the hit play by Paul Rudnick was highly touted as the
big gay movie of the year in 1995. Well, it may be big on laughs, but over all,
it didn't live up to its hype. It is almost a given that plays do not translate
well to film and this play is not an exception to that rule. The staginess of the
material was evident many times during the film and the director chose to use the
technique of having the actors talk directly to the audience. Attention All
Directors: Stop doing this!!! It is distracting and unnecessary. This film ends
up seeming more like a really long episode of Frasier than a major motion
picture. Luckily the script holds up, even under the heavy handed directing and
some really bad acting.</p>

<p>One of my biggest gripes with this film was the casting of Steven Weber as
Jeffrey. I was totally unconvinced. I just could not believe his performance from
the beginning, and it only got worse. In fact, the only convincing work he did
was the long and passionate kissing scenes between him and hot hunk of the month,
Michael T. Weiss (sigh!). Weiss turns in a credible performance, but one wonders
why he would be attracted to Weber and why Weber would even hesitate at having a
relationship with this stud. This is a story about trying to make sense of the
world in the age of AIDS and whether fear of disease and the dying is more
powerful than love and romance. And although not the movie it was hyped to be, it
is terribly funny and well written. Patrick Stewart turns in a wonderful acting
performance as Sterling, Jeffrey's decorator friend whose lover, Darious is a
chorus boy in Cats and a PWA. And, there are some extremely funny cameo
performances by Nathan Lane, Christine Baranski and Olympia Dukakis. Even though
this isn't the gay movie of the year, it is nice to see a big budget Hollywood
film about gay people and above all, it will make you laugh out loud. Rent it,
but just don't expect too much other than the jokes.</p>

<p><b>The Episcopal Guide to TAP</b> (Teens for AIDS Prevention Peer Education
Program) Edited by The Rev. Canon Gene Robinson and The Rev. Thaddeus A. Bennett
Writer/Consultant: The Rev Altagarcia Perez</p>

<p>Peer education programs are generally very effective ways of getting important
messages to hard to reach populations. This one can be learned from. It is
comprehensive and thorough. The TAP Program is a fine program in itself, but The
Episcopal Guide to TAP shows how a mainstream Christian denomination has
responded to the threat to the lives of its young people. Paraphrasing the
Episcopal Church's slogan as, The Body of Christ Has AIDS, TAP may be its
protease inhibitor. As we live and die in the midst of this pandemic statistics
will continue to change. Groups who implement this program will want to get the
latest figures from local Health Departments. TAP will save young lives, giving
parents and groups a wide range of tasks to train a core of teens to counsel
their peers. </p>

<p><b>What You Can Do to Avoid AIDS</b> By Magic Johnson<br>

If you have teens in your home and you have concern for their safety, you would
do well to have this book lying around the house. Magic speaks to teens in a
straightforward frank voice that avoids hip or ethnic jargon. His book looks
candidly at the transmission of AIDS and how to prevent it. Johnson presents the
kinds of things that kids think and talk about with user friendly language that
they will take seriously. The book has a great chapter that encourages teens to
visit, befriend and assist a person with AIDS, an excellent tool to educate, and
an effective method of prevention. This is good information for young adults
complete with questions and tasks. Johnson is a basketball superstar who has a
message he slam dunks into the minds of today's street smart kids. He speaks to
them in a way that they will understand. The plight of this L.A. Laker basketball
star infected with HIV would sound like the song of a fallen hero from anyone
else. He is still a hero to these kids, and more importantly his name alone will
get kids to pick up the book. ($3.95 Time Books/Random House.)</p>

<p><font size=3><b><a name="life">Lifestyles</a></b></font><br> by Tim Hughes</p>

<p>Lewis has every reason to be pessimistic about the future. A political climate
that has resulted in service cuts, negative attitudes towards the AIDS community
and above all uncertainty, only go to reinforce the precariousness of the past
four years, the years since he was diagnosed with HIV disease. "I got tested when
an ex lover passed away. He hadn't told me he had the virus. I knew he wasn't
well but I didn't put two and two together."</p>

<p>Part Irish, part Puerto Rican and part African American, Lewis was born and
raised in New York City. The day we met for this interview was his thirty eighth
birthday. "I didn't realize I was gay until I was twenty one. By that time I was
already in a relationship with a woman and we had a baby girl. I had a good job
as a salesman in a mens store in Astoria. We stopped living together. I had
several lovers but I always supported my family.</p>

<p>Things fell apart after his diagnosis. Lewis has more than his share of horror
stories as he struggled with the system. He reminisces about unresponsive CBOs,
DAS and previous housing situations. Typical tales from those trying to live with
AIDS.</p>

<p>"I was in shelters, drug infested SROs, an insecure rundown scatter site
apartment where I was robbed and beaten up." His worst memory was waking up on
his first night in a Chelsea SRO to find a rat munching a sandwich at the end of
the bed. "The room, the sandwich they belonged to him. I ran out and never went
back."</p>

<p>Today things seem to be better for this gay grandfather. He stands tall, looks
good and surprisingly not bitter. There is the comparative security of the two
bedroom scattersite apartment in Woodside, Queens. The apartment he shares with
his now grown up daughter and her baby girl. She's loving and supportive and
completely comfortable with her gay HIV positive dad. He's fighting for SSI but
his condition is stable and he feels pretty good. Lewis would like the perfect
lover to complete the family. After seeing me he's off to set up interviews for
CBO positions that pay a stipend. He has choices for lunch , GMHC or the Village
Center for Care, agencies he has found particularly helpful.</p>

Years of Advocacy for People Living with HIV and AIDS</b></font><br> By Brad F.
Maione</p>

<p>The Momentum AIDS Project, a provider of meals and nutritional counseling for
people living with HIV and AIDS, since 1985, is hosting a 10th Anniversary Jazz
Event to commemorate ten years of service to New Yorkers living with HIV/AIDS.
The event will be held on Monday, May 20, 1996, from 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. at
St. Peter's Church, 619 Lexington Avenue at 54th Street the Citicorp Center. The
evening's entertainment will be provided by Andre DeShields and the Don Braden
Quartet.</p>

<p>The event, featuring a reception and concert, is an effort by Momentum to
formally honor Momentum founders Peter Avitable, The Rev. John Damm, Hobart
Rauch, and the Gay Men's Health Crisis, all of whom were instrumental in
recognizing the need for services provided by the agency. According to Executive
Director Dawn Bryan, the 10th Anniversary Jazz Event gives the agency the
opportunity to recognize those who had the foresight to come together to make a
difference in the lives of people with HIV/AIDS.</p>

<p>" Their vision and determination laid the foundation for Momentum    we try to
build on that each day. The Agencies mission of providing hope, a hot meal and
services, in a caring environment is the cornerstone of what we do," Ms. Bryan
said. Each day we attempt to replicate the love courage and compassion the
founders displayed. Their vision and and determination laid the foundation."</p>

<p>Back in 1985, few people really knew what AIDS was. No one knew the
devastation this disease would bring." Ms. Bryan said. "Fortunately, people like
Peter and Hobart had the foresight and courage to step in to improve the quality
of life of their friends." </p>

<p>With the help of over 250 volunteers, Momentum offers a communal meal, and
pantry bags to more than 1,500 people at eight sites around New York City,
including St. Peters. Momentums clients are generally low income men and women
with HIV and AIDS, their partners and families. For ticket information, call

<ul> <li>Positive Health Project (PHP), is the only needle exchange/harm
reduction program that targets New York City's intravenous drug using sex
workers. Conveniently located in the heart of the city, where the sex industry
thrives, it also has a special focus on transgender issues. Transsexuals are at
added risk of HIV infection, because of their need for regular estrogen
injections. Unable to access expensive private doctors, they are driven to use a
black market that functions almost as an estrogen shooting gallery. The
transsexual is placed in double jeopardy by using unsterile, reused needles, and
by johns who refuse to practice safe sex. PHP is to be applauded for reaching
this population. For more information contact: PHP 301 West 31st Street. 2nd

York Times, charges were dropped against Johann Moore when he was arrested for
selling marijuana to AIDS and Cancer patients on the Lower East Side. Moore
founded the New York Buyer's Club in 1993 in order to supply marijuana for
medical purposes. The drug is known to reduce nausea and stimulate the appetite.
At first he provided these services free, but because of demand formed the not
for profit club. The judge dropped the charges on the condition that Moore is not
arrested in the next six months. However, Moore hopes the case will go to trial
so that a legal precedent for the use of marijuana for medical purposes can be
established in New York State. <br> <li>The Village Apothecary on Bleecker
Street, a favorite pharmacy of the Manhattan AIDS community, because of its
caring service and deep discounts, is unable to dispense Indinavir, the latest
protease inhibitor to receive FDA approval. Merck & Company, the makers of the
drug, have given exclusive rights to Stadtlanders, a Pennsylvania mail order
pharmacy, until they can meet increasing demand. George Manos, Village
Apothecary's owner cries "foul" and states that this monopoly means that the
consumer is forced to pay a 36 percent markup. City Council Member Tom Duane has
received many complaints, and is alarmed that Stadtlanders is charging $6000 for
a year's supply, $1,560 more than Merck's wholesale price. This is more than
double the industry practice. Mr. Manos has written in protest to the United
States Attorney General, Janet Reno. Consumer News urges you to contact Merck

<p><font size=3><b><a name="edit">Editorial</a><br> Health Care
Reform</b></font><br> It seems like just a brief time ago we were listening to a
presidential candidate speak about the need to reform our health care system. As
you will recall, tens of millions of Americans had no health coverage. A bright
star was bringing a health care package to the Congress. In April, the Senate
passed a bipartisan health reform package that will go to conference. It does not
bring us any closer to universal coverage. The House version will require working
people with HIV and AIDS to pay more for insurance, making it impossible for many
to continue working. Did something happen that I missed? Have the uninsured
become insured, or immune to disease? Have working people with HIV/AIDS gotten
higher paying jobs?</p>

<p>What do Americans want? An egalitarian health care system where all people
have the same options for medical treatment, despite economic, social or racial
status? Or, do we want to have a system that will emphasize "personal
responsibility" and result in smaller government. You cannot have both. According
to Professor Uwe Rheinhardt of Princeton University, the American Health Care
System is not a civilized one. He notes that in Germany or Canada it would be
unheard of, even barbaric to tell someone that because you are sick they cannot
insure you, or you cannot access the best of medical care. In this context we
need a little more government. Exemplary healthcare in the U.S. is a privilege
and will remain so unless we instruct government to make it a right... Register
and Vote.</p>

<p><b>What cost, freedom?</b><br> Protease inhibitors are now available to PWAs
insured by Medicaid and ADAP. They are very promising drugs which decrease the
amount of virus in the blood of persons with AIDS (see Health Care on page 5).
The Veterans Administration serves our nations retired warriors with medical
treatment, a system where, theoretically, all are given the opportunity for equal
medical care. Nevertheless, a central office responsible for budget management
determines the range of available treatments. Currently, protease inhibitors are
too costly to provide to men and women who have helped to keep us free.</p>

<p><font size=3><b><a name="letters">Letters</a></b></font><p>

<p>To the Editor:<br> I am recovering from a cancer surgery. I will have to go to
treatments regularly for some time . I am interested in the articles you have
been printing about managed care organizations because of my recent experience
with my insurance company, Constitution Insurance. I live about twenty miles from
the nearest hospital. Before this surgery, there was a scope. My doctor, a
gastroenterologist, told me he wanted to keep me in the hospital overnight so he
could watch me, as a precaution in case hemorrhaging or other complications
arose. </p>

<p>My husband told me this story today. My doctor sought approval from the
insurance company. The insurance company doctor refused the recommendation of an
overnight stay. But my doctor was persistent, speaking with a total of eight
people. He made a final call to the gatekeeper (a doctor paid by the insurance
company to determine the need for treatments, hospital stays and referrals to
specialists), insisting on an overnight stay. The gatekeeper said in no uncertain
terms there would be no approval of an overnight stay. My doctor told the
insurance company doctor that the entire conversation was being taped. Then and
only then did the insurance company doctor back down and agree to an overnight
stay. We are very afraid for our lives if this is true, and wonder what will
happen when Managed Care Companies control physicians.<br> <i>Perplexed in

<p><font size=3><b><a name="oped">Op Ed</a><br> Clinical Trials</b></font><br>
You go to the doctor. You've known for some time that you have a life threatening
disease, and you also know that there is no known cure. Your doctor has talked to
you about an experimental medication that may offer some hope and now the disease
has progressed to the point that you qualify to enter the study and receive the
experimental medication. You and your doctor discuss again the possible side
effects, both known and unknown, as well as the design for the study. You weigh
the potential risks against the possibility of getting, free of charge, a
medication that just might give you back your life. Then you consider the fact
that it's not just your life; your participation in the study will undoubtedly
help others in the future with the same disease. You decide to go ahead and
enroll in the study, and your doctor gives you... a sugar pill.</p>

<p>The use of control groups those participants in a drug study who are not given
the experimental medication in order to set a standard against which those taking
the new drug may be evaluated  has long been standard operating procedure in the
evaluation of new treatments. It is a model which is supported by firmly held
beliefs within the medical and pharmaceutical industries and which has, to some
extent, been codified into law. Under a 1962 amendment to the Federal Food, Drug
and Cosmetic Act of 1938, the Federal Drug Administration can only approve drugs
which have been shown to be effective by "evidence of adequate and well
controlled investigations, including clinical investigations, by experts
qualified by scientific experience and training." A well controlled investigation
is usually taken to mean a study which incorporates a control group as a
measure.</p>

<p>But some researchers are beginning to question the thinking behind a model
which guarantees the denial of treatment to half the people who enter the study.
The debate cuts to the core of our interest in preserving life and health and, in
the end, may suggest a new understanding of informed consent.</p>

<p>A paper to be published in the May issue of the American Journal of Public
Health presents a model treatment program which would allow all trial
participants who want the experimental treatment to receive it while still
preserving the research role of the control group. The paper, "Clinical and
Prophylactic Trials with Assured New Treatment for Those at Greater Risk," is
authored by Michael O. Finkelstein, an attorney with Patterson, Bellknap, Webb
and Tyler, Dr. Bruce Levin of the Columbia School of Public Health Division of
Biostatistics and Dr. Herbert Robbins of the Department of Statistics and
Institute of Biostatistics at Rutgers University.</p>

<p>According to the authors, effective randomized trial where participants are
placed in either a treatment or a control group by random selection can in some
cases by impossible for a both ethical and practical reasons. Participants often
decline to enroll, for example, when they discover that they may not receive the
experimental treatment. Participants have also been known to share the drug with
others not enrolled in the study (thereby altering the intended dosage levels) or
to attempt to discover if they are in the treatment group and then drop out if
they come to believe they are not receiving medication. In some instances,
participants have even taken pills to independent laboratories to see if they are
receiving the medication or a placebo.</p>

<p>The authors argue that in those cases where treatment is being studied for
people with extreme illnesses most notably cases of advanced stages of AIDS
related infections the use of a control group is scientifically unnecessary and
morally objectionable. In such cases, they argue, the fate of the control group
is predictable and subtleties can be predicted by mathematical projection. And,
if there is no great scientific value to the use of a control group, there is no
defense to denying them medication which, with an understanding of the
experimental nature of the drug, they may still decide they want. The role of the
control group could then be filled by people in earlier stages of the disease who
would not yet qualify for the treatment but may agree to be observed in exchange
for the possibility of receiving the drug in the future. Using people in earlier
stages of infection, coupled with a mathematical extension of the likely
progression of the disease (based on statistical sampling) would serve the
purposes of a traditional control group while allowing all participants to make
an informed decision about what role they want to play in the study.</p>

<p>The concerns raised in the paper are not just theoretical. Last year, three
national studies evaluating the effectiveness of bone marrow transplant in
treating breast cancer were unable to fill their rosters. The transplants would
be performed for free as a part of the study, but the cost of receiving the
treatment outside the study which could be as much as $200,000 and is often not
covered by insurance was seen by many women as a lesser cost than the fifty per
cent risk of ending up in the control group and not receiving treatment at all.
The result was that many women who were initially going to enter the study sought
treatment elsewhere, and a promising treatment for breast cancer was not able to
meet its experimental design.</p>

<p>The importance of drug studies to their participants should not be
underestimated. For most participants, the studies are not just an experimental
procedure but a way to obtain costly medicines often not covered by insurance or
Medicaid benefits. The protease inhibitor Norvir a drug made by Abbott Labs
which, when used in combination with other drugs, can reduce the viral load in
people with AIDS was available free of charge to participants during its trial
phase. When the trials were announced last year, more than 18,500 people signed
up for the first 3,600 slots and the three companies producing the drugs
initiated a lottery to select participants. In the Norvir study, the risk of
death or disease progression was placed at 13 per cent among participants
receiving treatment; that risk was assessed at 27 per cent for those in the
control group. Norvir has since been approved by the FDA and costs close to
eighteen dollars for a single day's treatment. </p>

<p>In short, the people lucky enough to be selected to receive the Norvir
treatment had twice as good odds at reducing disease progression and of living 
as those receiving the placebo. And assumedly no one walked in asking for a sugar
pill. In cases where the experimental treatment is quite literally a matter of
life and death for the participants, treatment should not be denied.
Investigation of other models needs to be done and their efficacies considered.
It comes down to informed consent, and a simple matter of patient rights.</p>

<h3><a name="ethics">The</a> Ethics Project<br> <font size=3>The Fortune
Society’s response to HIV/AIDS infected ex-prisoners</font><br> <font size=-1>by
K. Lowry and JoAnne Page</font></h2>

<font size=-1> <p>The Fortune Society is a walk-in service agency for released
prisoners and youth at risk. Annually, more than 2,000 people benefit from
Fortune’s outreach and discharge planning efforts while in prison. Another 1,000
recently released prisoners access referral and on-site services, including
tutoring, job training and placement, counseling, treatment for substance abuse,
court advocacy, and HIV-related case management.</p>

<p>In 1989 The Fortune Society made HIV education and services one of the highest
priorities of the agency. In New York State, HIV-related illness and
complications of AIDS is the leading cause of death among ex-prisoners. From 14
to 16 percent of the 60,000 prisoners in the State’s corrections facilities are
infected with HIV. Of the 86,000 offenders incarcerated each year in New York
City, 25.9 percent of the women and 12.3 percent of the men test positive for
HIV.</p>

<p>Fortune began to address the urgent need for HIV-related services specifically
through the establishment of the <b>Empowerment Through HIV Information,
Community, and Services</b> (ETHICS) Project. The ETHICS Project has found that
linking ex-offenders with HIV with community resources requires an innovative,
holistic service delivery strategy. The ETHICS Project emphasizes client-staff
interaction to help clients accesses of an array of needed services.</p>

<p>Typically, ETHICS’ clients are HIV symptomatic and struggling with
deteriorating health. They need medical care, assistance in obtaining
entitlement, drug-relapse prevention, clothing, civil legal services (including
living wills), food, employment, home health care, education. In addition, many
HIV-symptomatic prisoners receive woefully inadequate discharge planning. Delays
in getting benefits after discharge from prison jeopardize their health and
motivation.</p>

<p>The ETHICS Project recognized that, despite their many needs, ex-offenders
living with HIV have great difficulty obtaining help. Because of incarceration
and living with HIV/AIDS, they often feel isolated, depressed, and powerless.
Most lack the skills and self-confidence needed to navigate NEW York City’s
fragmented service delivery system: they respond to red tape and other barriers
with hostility or resignation. They seldom receive any guidance or referrals for
services.  They are at high risk for resuming previous activities -substance
abuse, unprotected sex and prostitution, and criminal activity. To respond to
these conditions, the ETHICS Project established two goals:</p>

<ul> <li>To meet the complex social and medical needs of newly released prisoners
who have HIV/AIDS; and <li>To help clients modify their self-destructive
behaviors and adopt healthier more productive ones. </ul>

<p>ETHICS clients are assigned a case manager who remains with them while they
are in the program. The initial counseling sessions help clients feel at ease
with their case managers and facilitate the needs assessment. The case manager
seeks the client’s acknowledgment of his or her basic needs. The individual need
of the client primarily determines the intensity and duration of the case.
Although most clients are involved from six to eight months, no end dates are
set, and some clients participate even longer. Typically, the most urgent case
management needs are medical evaluation and care; safe, suitable short term
housing, clothing; and assured access to nutritious meals.</p>

<p>Case management is intensive at the beginning because clients usually have
many social service and medical needs. ETHICS clients receive one-on-one
counseling, up to three times a week during the first 3-6 weeks. Each session
lasts approximately 45 minutes. In these sessions, clients express their feelings
freely and talk about their most immediate and distressing problems. Staff have
found that clients with HIV often need hours of counseling before they have
enough hope and confidence in the future to follow through on referrals and make
the best use of the services.</p>

<p>Once they meet the most urgent needs of the clients, case managers begin to
focus on long-term needs including permanent housing and medical care. During
this phase of case management, case managers also analyze and research
entitlement appropriate for clients and help them with applications and
advocacy.</p>

<p>After referrals and follow-up, they are encouraged to remain with the ETHICS
Project for an additional two to four months. During this time, through services
provided at The Fortune Society, clients participate in an array of activities
that promote wellness and help them pursue serious life-change goals. These
activities include: Social and Fitness Activities, Support Groups, Educational
Seminars on Health and Nutrition, Advocacy Activities, Peer Education Training
and the Celebration of Success (graduation and receipt of a certificate and
recognition from peers and counselors).</p>

<h4><a name="housing">Housing</a><br> <font size=-1>by Kurt Gottshalk</font></h4>

<p>When Candido Gonzalez first tested positive for HIV in 1989, housing was one
of the last things on his mind. He was homeless but, like so many early cases of
infection in New York City, the next fix meant a lot more to him then did a warm
bed or a hot meal. He speaks the words slowly and clearly, so that their weight
isn't missed: "I had a very bad drug habit."</p>

<p>The drug habit remained his first concern, he recalls, "until I almost died. I
went to the doctor and it was the drugs, so I had to stop." It was then that
Gonzalez entered the labyrinthine system of HIV services in New York. "I applied
for benefits," he says, "and found out they give you $215 per month for rent. You
tell me where you can find an apartment for that." With that kind of money,
options were few. Gonzalez rented a room at Our Lady of Good Counsel, a SRO (or
single room occupancy) run by Catholic Charities in the Bedford-Stuveysent
section of Brooklyn. He lived there for three years. In a word, he says, it was
“a nightmare.” It's hard to maintain your health in a place like that,” he says.
“It's really dirty, there's four to a bedroom, five or six using the kitchen. .
.We had one TB scare. It was really nasty. . . !  “I'm a little bit cleaner.”</p>

<p>Over the next few years, Gonzalez developed the symptoms that lead to an AIDS
diagnosis and can lead to enhanced welfare and social security benefits and
better opportunities for housing. "My immune system dropped, so now I'm allergic
to half the world," he says. "It's sort of all a Catch-22. Once you get sicker,
you get more money."</p>

<p>Gonzalez has made it out of the SRO and into a scattered-site housing
apartment paid for by the City Department of AIDS Services. But as Gonzalez has
improved his housing conditions, options in New York City for people living with
HIV may also be improving. The typical images of SRO's, dingy welfare hotels or
sterile medical facilities, are still around, but new facilities designed to
create a home for people with AIDS are beginning to emerge.</p>

<p>One such facility recently opened its doors on West 22nd Street in Chelsea.
Built with money from the American Baptist Churches of Metropolitan New York as
well as city, state and federal funds, Flemister House is the result of $5.2
million worth of renovation. Over the last two years, elevators have been moved
and restructured to allow for wheelchair accessibility and the top three floors
of the building next door (which Flemister also bought) were torn down to unblock
windows and increase sunlight in the rooms.</p>

<p>The 100 year-old, 2,100 square foot building which once housed a tobacco
warehouse, had sat vacant for several years. But last October, Flemister began
taking tenants; by the end of January, the building's fifty rooms were
filled.</p>

<p>Different facilities have different functions, and according to Residence
Director Donald Morlan, one of the main goals in building  Flemister House was to
create a warm, home-like place for its residents. </p>

<p>"Rivington House has nursing stations, it looks very much like a hospital,"
Morlan says. "The rooms have two beds and hospital type bathrooms. The first
choice for them is how to keep things clean.</p>

<p>"Bailey House was already a hotel," he continues, referring to the residence
where he worked prior to the opening of Flemister House. The difference between
the two is that at Bailey-Holt House there we had to make the best of a building
already divided into small dormitory-like rooms, whereas working with an old
warehouse gave the architects Flemister hired a large, open space to work with.
High ceilings, for example, allowed them to put in an elaborate air ventilation
system. All of the air in the building is exchanged four times an hour to reduce
the risk of TB and other airborne infections.</p>

<p>Other residences that serve clientele with different needs don't have the same
flexibility in design, Morlan says, and in fact a resident at Flemister recently
relocated to Rivington when he developed incontinence and required more extensive
care than Flemister provides. While other sites provide more nursing and medical
attention, Flemister seeks to provide comfort to people in whom the disease may
not have progressed as far. Residents have access to exercise equipment, a
meditation room and a solarium for horticulture therapy.</p>

<p>"There's a very beneficial quality to working with plants, seeing things
grow," according to Morlan. And while the Flemister staff do not expect to
provide comprehensive medical care on-site, they will open a new day treatment
center by the end of March. Medical and pharmaceutical services and counseling
will be available not just to the 50 residents but to another 100 people who are
HIV positive but don't need congregate living, according to Morlan.</p>

<p>The clinic will be another factor in creating low-income housing that does
more than just provide a roof for people living with HIV. And so far, it seems to
be working at Flemister. "Last Friday the rent was due," says Morlan. "They chase
me down to pay the rent. What this says to me is that the tenants cherish being
here and believe it is a beautiful environment."</p>

<p>And, Morlan adds, with no false modesty, "I think I would say that we are a
sanctuary."</p>

<h4><a name="health">Health</a> Care : What is Medicaid Managed Care?<br> <font
size=-1>by Lauren Shapiro and Domenique Ghossein</font></h4>

<p>Medicaid Managed Care is a special program that allows -and sometimes requires
-Medicaid recipients to join a managed care plan.</p>

<p>Most Medicaid recipients can choose to go to any doctor who accepts Medicaid.
Medicaid then pays that doctor directly for the service. They call this
“fee-for-service.” With regular Medicaid, if you think you need a second opinion
or want to see a specialist, you can make an appointment with any doctor who will
accept Medicaid.</p>

<p>Under Medicaid Managed Care, Medicaid recipients join a managed health care
plan. They assign a doctor  who makes decisions about your care. Medicaid Managed
Care is Different from Regular Medicaid in several basic ways. This article
explains what Medicaid Managed Care is, who must enroll in Medicaid Managed Care,
and if you do enroll, what your rights are.</p>

<h4>How is Medicaid Managed Care different from regular Medicaid?</h4>

<p><b>Provider List</b>. When you join a managed care plan, you can use only
doctors that are members of the plan. If you go to a doctor who is not in the
plan, Medicaid will not cover the visit. A few exceptions to this rule are: HIV
testing,  pre and post-test counseling from any provider.</p>

<p><b>Primary Care Provider (PCP)</b>. With a managed care plan, you will have a
primary care provider -a doctor or nurse- who will monitor your health. You must
get permission from your PCP to see a specialist or have a second opinion.</p>

<p><b>Flat Fee</b>. Medicaid pays the plan one flat fee to take care of  all of 
your health needs. The managed care plan gets the same amount of money from
Medicaid whether you go to see the doctor once during the month or ten times. For
this reason, the plan will try to keep your medical care and expenses to a
minimum. In some ways, this is good for you because they have more of an
incentive to prevent you from getting sick. Yet the system can be harmful because
there is an incentive not to pay for medical procedures or care unless it is
absolutely necessary.</p>

<p><b>Emergency Room Visits</b>. Under the current Medicaid system, many patients
go to the emergency room to get treated for conditions that are not emergencies.
Medicaid pays for the emergency room visit. Under a managed care plan, they will
only pay for emergency room visits if there is a true emergency. This can mean an
injury from an accident or a serious illness that can cause permanent damage or
death.</p>

<p><b>How quickly can I get a Medical appointment under Managed Care?</b><br>
Under the managed care plan, you can see a doctor or a nurse practitioner within
forty-eight to seventy-two hours if there is a need for urgent care. This can
include a fever or influenza. For routine care, such as pap smears or
immunizations, you can expect to see a doctor within four to six weeks.</p>

<p><b>How can I find out more about Medical Managed Care Plans?</b><br> There are
lots of different managed care plans in New York City. Some examples are Aetna,
Centercare, Cigna, Healthnet, Health Plus, Healthy Start, Metropolitan Health
Plan, Oxford, and US Healthcare. To find out more about each plan, you can go to
the enrollment and education units in welfare centers throughout the city. You
can also call 1-800-505-5678 if you live in New York City. You can also find them
through Consumer News on the Internet. www.aidsnyc.org</p>

<p><b>Some Things to Think About if You are Living With HIV Disease or
AIDS</b><br> Managed care is supposed to provide preventive care, keep healthy
people healthy, and save costs. Because someone who is HIV positive is likely to
need frequent referrals, specialists care, and lab tests, you should think very
carefully before joining a managed care plan. You then decide whether a plan is
likely to meet your needs. If possible, you should list the complete range of
services that you are using now and then decide whether a plan is likely to meet
your needs. If possible, you should speak with a patient of the plan [who is a
person living with AIDS]  to ask about their experiences.</p>

<p><b>The Primary Care Provider</b><br> When you join a managed care plan, you
have to choose one of the plan’s doctors to be in charge of your care. This
doctor is called your primary care provider. She or he will give you regular
preventive care like routine check ups.</p>

<p>A study, published by the <a
href="http://www.ama-assn.org/special/hiv/newsline/special/reports/jama0313.htm">Journal
of American Medical Association</a>, shows that only 25.8% of primary care
physicians surveyed could detect and diagnose common symptoms of HIV-related
disease. In a recent survey of 20 managed care plans by Housing Works Inc., It
was found that 95% of the plans could not refer a potential client to a primary
care provider with experience treating HIV and AIDS. This is some thing you
should ask the plan about before enrolling. How many [member] doctors have
experience treating patients with HIV/AIDS? Where are they located? If the plan
cannot answer these questions, think again about choosing this plan.</p>

<p><b>Specialists</b><br> Under the managed care plan, if you want to see another
doctor in the plan or see a specialist, you must first get permission from your
primary care provider, if you do not get permission, Medicaid will not pay for
the care and you may get billed. If you need frequent referrals to a specialist,
and many people with HIV do, a managed care plan may not be the best option for
you.</p>

<p>If you are living with HIV disease or AIDS you may be seeing a specialist.
Examples are a gastroenterologist, an infectious disease specialist, a mental
health specialist, or psychiatrist. Ask your specialist if she is associated with
a managed care plan. Remember, if you are enrolled in a plan, you can see only
the doctors within that plan. If you do not see any specialists now, but think
you may need one later, ask the plan for their list.  Find out where they are
located. If you know someone in the plan, ask what their experience is with
specialists while they have been in the plan.</p>

<p>If you do not have a primary care provider or want to change your provider,
you may want to ask the plan for their list of available providers and their
locations. If you do not speak English, you should ask whether any primary
providers speak your language.</p>

<p>Pharmacies are often part of a managed care plan. I you are considering
enrolling in a managed care plan, you should find out which pharmacies near you
participate in the plan or whether you can use your Medicaid for drugs.</p>

<h3><a name="conflict">Conflict</a> Resolution<br> <font size=-1>by
K.Lowry</font></h3>

<p>Last year the Social Security Administration instituted new Regulations
limiting benefits for anyone whose disability was ruled to be based in full or in
part on alcohol or drug addiction. Consumer News has been approached by PWAs
whose benefits they believe,  are in jeopardy because of this ruling. Hayley
Gorenberg, Staff Attorney at Queens Legal services, reports that, of the cases
they are reviewing, there is reason to question the decisions. If people with HIV
are denied benefits because of past drug or alcohol histories, a determination
must be made as to the primary disability. Consumer News is interested in
tracking these complaints, and referring them to appropriate resources write, <a
href="mailto:cnews@aidsnyc.org">e-mail</a> or call.</p>

<p>Bonnie Burke a volunteer at GMHC wrote this letter to the New York Times
Editorial Board Oct. 1, 1995. On December 1, World AIDS Day, Bonnie testified at
City Hall. She has contacted Consumer News hoping to hear from consumers who have
experienced similar problems. This is her letter to the New York Times.</p>

<blockquote> <p>To the Editor:<br> You reported on Oct. 1 that a survey by New
York City’s Public Advocate, Mark Green, showed that despite the new national and
state voter registration laws, the city has tried to register only half of the
people applying for welfare benefits. I can shed some light on why so few public
assistance recipients are registered to vote. I am a volunteer with the Gay Men’s
Health Crisis. On May 30, my client ( a 60 year old grandmother who speaks no
English) requested that I complete her food stamp recertification form with
registration form attached, and submit them both for her at her downtown Brooklyn
food Stamp office. The food stamp worker, however, ripped the voter registration
form off the food stamp form and requested I remove it from the office as she had
no idea what to do with it.  As she was the only processor there and was
reluctant to take me so late in the day, I did not argue. Instead, I trudged down
the street to another food stamp office and threw myself on their mercy. They
were also mystified and reluctant to take it until I pointed to a poster on the
wall inviting people to register to vote on site. I would find this humerus were
it not that the 24.6 billion in Medicaid cuts headed to New York virtually
insures that many of our loved ones will be left sick and dying on the streets.
This is why my client (whose daughter died of AIDS in 1992, leaving 15 children)
wants to vote for the first time  -and her constitutional right was very near
denied. I don’t blame these workers, who were clearly misinformed. As Mark Green
said, “It’s no mystery that voter registration has not been a priority for the
Mayor or the Governor.” Both Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Governor George E. Pataki
are Republicans. The Republican part vigorously apposed the National Voter
Registration Act, which Mr. Green described as a great civil rights law intended
to register poor people and minorities who traditionally have been excluded.”</p>

<p>Brooklyn, Oct 1, 1995<br> To Consumer News:<br> I am seeking information
regarding non-compliance with the National Voter Registration Act. Have you been
to a benefit office ( DAS, WIC, FS, Medicaid, AFDC, ) in the past year to apply
for benefits or recertification? Did you see a voter registration poster? Did you
see any voter registration forms? Were you verbally asked if you wanted to
register to vote? If so: What happened, did you get confirmation in the mail?
Please contact Consumer News, Attention B. Burke to report your experience and,
for more information.</p></blockquote>

<h3><a name="nutrition">Nutrition</a> : Why Vegetables<br> <font size=-1>by Edwin
Krales<br> Nutritionist/Outreach Coordinator The Momentum AIDS Project<br>
Adjunct Professor of Nutrition Hunter College</font></h3>

<p>There are three things that all people need to survive on this earth: air,
water, and <font color="#005500">green plants</font>. Neither the level of
development of their country, nor their race, religion, gender, sexual
orientation, or HIV status plays a role here.</p>

<p>Unfortunately as individuals, we can’t do much to control the quality of the
air we breathe. Getting that control will take more advanced social organization
than we have right now. Water quality is little easier for each of us to improve.
If  tap water is not pure, we can boil, filter or distill it or buy clean water
from reputable companies to protect ourselves.</p>

<p>Green plants are the foundation of everything we eat. Even  meat eaters prefer
the meat from animals that eat green plants to the meat from animals that eat
other animals. The exception to this rule is the fish we like to eat. They
usually feed on each other.</p>

<p>The green plants that we eat are popularly divided into fruits, vegetable,
bean and grains. Until recently we categorized the components of these foods as
vitamins, minerals, fiber, fat, protein or carbohydrates. Some components were
further classified as antioxidants.</p>

<p>Now because of the discovery of chemical compounds that do not fit neatly into
any of the older categories, scientists have created a new category called
phytochemical. Most people have heard of <a
href="../../rtrp/nutrit.html#beta">beta carotene</a>, one of the best known of
the thousands of phytochemicals. Now we know that there are at least 600 other
carotenes. Beta carotene in plants is the precursor of <a
href="../../rtrp/nutrit.html#vita">vitamin A</a> in animals. But we do not yet know
the relationship between beta and the 600 other carotenes. Some other
phytochemicals are indoles, over 1700 varieties of bioflavonoids, isothiocyanates
and allium compounds. This list of phytochemicals is far from complete and will
continue to grow as more research is done.</p>

<p>The next logical question is, of what importance to our health is this
information about phytochemicals? Some scientists believe that eating more
vegetables containing these phytochemicals will help protect us against certain
diseases. For example there is a phytochemical in soybeans and soybean products
like tofu and tempeh  that is believed to inhibit the growth of new blood vessels
that cancer cells need to develop. Without this new blood supply, the young
cancer cells will not get the nutrients they need to grow and will not get any
larger than the head of a pin. It is also believed that lycopene, another
carotene found in tomatoes and strawberries, is probably a protective agent
against prostate cancer. We now believe that eating green and yellow vegetables
can protect us against bladder, breast, cervical, lung, mouth, throat, ovarian
and stomach cancers. According to the National Cancer Institute, approximately
thirty-five percent of all cancer cases may be caused by a poor diet one that is
low in fruits and vegetables.</p>

<p>Does this new discovery of phytochemicals mean that we can expect to see
bottles of phytochemical pills on the shelves of health food stores? Probably.
But not because it is good nutrition. Two point must be kept in mind. The first
is that we can only put into a pill what we know we have taken out of a natural
product. Very little is known about how these chemicals work. Perhaps there is a
relationship between some or all of the carotenes that allow the lycopene to
work. Maybe it is the lycopene, fiber, <a href="../../rtrp/nutrit.html#vitc">vitamin
C</a> connection. Maybe it is the distribution of the phytochemicals in the
plant’s watery medium. These are all unknowns. Therefore we don’t know what to
put into the pill to make it work properly in our bodies.</p>

<p>The second point is, why bother processing these phytochemicals?. Vegetables
are readily available. They are delicious to eat and we don’t have to know what
they are composed of for them to work well in our bodies. Broccoli will not turn
into pistachio ice cream and loose all its nutrients if we cannot list all of its
disease-fighting properties.</p>

<p>My advice therefore is to eat at least five servings of <font
color="#00ff00">green</font> and <font color="#ffff00">yellow</font> vegetables
every day, Snack on citrus fruits, berries and grapes. Add some tofu or other
soybean product to your protein allowance, and take a multivitamin/mineral
supplement for insurance. This way you will cover all your bases. Remember the
darker-colored parts of fruits and vegetables usually have higher concentrations
of phytochemical and some other valuable nutrients. For example, in a single head
of lettuce the dark green leaves are richer than the white or light-tinted
leaves.</p>

<h3><a name="recipe">Recipe</a> : French Onion Soup</h3> <p><b>Hint</b>: This is
a classic soup traditionally made with beef broth in the north. I prefer chicken
or vegetable broth. If you wish to eliminate the bread and cheese, the
traditional “au gratin," it is a fine soup without it. Cheese is a perfectly good
food product, but stay clear of blue vein or similar cheeses with live
cultures.</p>

<blockquote> <p>2 large onions halved and thinly sliced<br> 1 Tablespoon butter
or olive oil<br> 2 sprigs of fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dry thyme<br> 1/4 teaspoon
fresh ground black pepper (omit if you suffer from thrush or other oral
infections)<br> 6 cups low-fat chicken or vegetable broth<br> 6 slices of French
whole wheat bread, toasted<br> 1 cup Gruyere cheese mixed with Parmesan<br> or
Try this Puree of<br> 1 cup of soybean cheeses, Tofurella and Parmesan Lite
(available in health food stores)</p>

<p>Heat the oil or butter,<br> add the onions and saute over high heat about five
minutes, turn the heat down to medium <br> add the thyme and pepper and cook
without stirring about three minutes until onions are very brown but not
scorched<br> add the broth (stock) scraping the pan and bring to a boil<br> turn
the heat down to low and cook thirty minutes.<br> Spread the cheese or tofu
mixtures over the bread and place on top of the soup. Heat under a broiler about
one and a half minutes or in a very hot oven about five minutes or until the
cheeses are melted.</p> </blockquote>

<p>This past week I was invited to dinner at a relative’s home. She had prepared
a wonderful meal, attending to every detail so very carefully. She took care to
make an onion soup which, as you know, is better the next day. She made the soup
in an aluminum pan and stored it in the refrigerator.. When she served the soup,
she said, “Gee this tastes funny; What is that taste?” After we talked for a
while I discovered she stored the soup in the same pot she cooked it in. Bad
mistake. It is better to cook with stainless steel, not aluminum. Aluminum  mixes
with the food over time and shows up in the blood. Also it is not very tasty and
some believe not healthy. In general, it is better not to store left-over food in
the pans that you cook in. Store food in clean plastic or glass containers under
adequate refrigeration.</p>

<h4>Video Reviews<br> <font size=-1>current and not-so-current video releases at
a bargain available for home viewing.<br> by Dan Battles</font></h4>

<p>"The times they are a changin’. . . ."  But, I have to differ with Bob Dylan:
The more things change, the more they stay the same.  After having witnessed one
of the most disturbing movies I've seen in many years, I would venture to say
that the times haven't changed nearly enough.  The movie is called "<b>Kids</b>"
and is written by Harmony Korine and directed by Larry Clark.  Despite the fact
that this is not, in my opinion, a very good movie, it should nonetheless be
viewed and discussed in every junior high and high school classroom in this
country.</p>

<p>"<b>Kids</b>" follows, in semi-documentary style, a group of 15 and 16 year
olds through the summer days of their lives in New York City.  We are taken
through sometimes extremely graphic scenes of the de-flowering of virgins, drug
buys and drug abuse, theft, horrific physical violence, date rape, orgiastic
public sex and as much sex talk as one can possibly tolerate in a single sitting.
 Oddly, however, this was not the most disturbing aspect of the movie.  There is
no real story line to "<b>Kids</b>"; it simply documents the lives of Telly and
Casper, two lost youths, and their circle of friends.  Larry Clark has filled the
screen with images and symbolism that are, at best, cliched and overused.  The
semi-documentary style is ineffective since it is not consistently used
throughout the film.  The result is a confusion of style and a sense of being
lost in a world you have wandered into by mistake.</p>

<p>The real story begins to unfold when one of Telly's de-flowered virgins
(Jennie) accompanies her friend to the clinic to be tested for HIV.  Jennie has
only had sex with Telly while her friend has a much wider circle of sexual
partners.  Predictably, Jennie tests positive while her friend does not.  Jennie
then begins searching the city for Telly, presumably to tell him that he has
infected her.  The movie makes no statement as to whether the irrepressibly sex-
starved Telly is aware of his HIV status or not.  Whether he knows his status or
he doesn't, Telly continues his campaign to de-flower as many virgins as
possible.  He mistakenly believes that this sexual compulsion will make him
immortal.  He and all of the kids in this film have made a conscience decision to
ignore the facts about HIV and the procedures for protecting themselves and
others.</p>

<p>The most disturbing aspects of this film are not the graphic sex and drug
abuse, but rather the fact that these kids seem to be re-living the sexual
revolution of the 1970's, without regard to the 1990's facts regarding the
dangers of unprotected sex.  Not only that, but incredibly, when Jennie finally
finds Telly (in the throws of soiling yet another underage virgin), she chooses
not to interrupt and warn Telly's next victim, but instead walks away.  As if
that is not bad enough, she then allows Casper to have his sexual way with her
(although she is under the influence of some sort of illegal drug), thus
infecting yet another person.  I was almost sick to my stomach as I watched a
group of 12 year old boys following the older boys' antics with admiration and
awe, destined to make the same mistakes and live parallel lives of destruction. 
Witnessing this young generation's complete lack of self-esteem and disregard for
human life is the most troublesome aspect of the film.  To know one is infected
with a virus that can possibly end your next sexual partner's life is one thing,
but to so cavalierly disregard basic humanity and allow unprotected sexual
behavior to continue is downright criminal.  There are no adult influences in the
film and I suspect this was a purposeful omission by the writer, to show us that
these young people are somehow alone in the world, without parents to guide and
care for them.  But somehow I can't buy this as completely true for these middle
class youngsters.</p>

<p>The film is sure to generate all kinds of discussion and for that reason, I
would recommend that every person over the age of 13 see it and discuss it with
their family and friends.  Such discussions could very possibly save many lives. 
For this reason, I would recommend your seeing "Kids."  However, it will be very
upsetting for the weak of heart or the easily outraged.  It is especially
frightening to persons currently living with HIV.  Viewer Beware!</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, something less violent and more amusing is your style,
do not miss <b>Go Fish</b>, a delightful film directed in black and white by Rose
Troche and written by Troche and Guinevere Turner (who also plays one of the lead
characters, Max).  Here is an example of imagery and symbolism that is unique and
purposeful.  Ms. Troche and Ms.Turner obviously have had experience in play
writing and poetry writing, and they miraculously transfer this experience to
film; and it works!  This is modern urban poetry (with a little Greek theater
thrown in for good measure) translated into a film depicting the lives of a group
of big city lesbians.  The film ebbs and flows and takes the viewer on a
undulating ride through the lives of a group of women who are trying to fix up
two of their friends.  It is full of charm, wit and amusing discussions  by the
"Greek chorus," consisting of the friends who get together to discuss the ongoing
mating game being played by the very 90's Max and the somewhat "hippy" (as in
1960's) Ely (bravely portrayed by V.S. Brodie).  There is nothing extraordinary
about the story.  It is very simple and direct.  But, the way in which it is told
is utterly charming.  I found myself smiling throughout the film and at the end,
wishing these women were a part of my life.  They seem to have so much fun in
their relatively normal lives that I became jealous.</p>

<p>Speaking of kids, <b>The Indian in the Cupboard</b>, directed by Frank Oz of
The Muppets fame, is perfect family viewing.  Written by Melissa Mathison, who
also wrote "<b>E.T.</b>," this is a child-like fantasy romp through the
imagination of Omri (played by Hal Scardino).  Omri is given an old cupboard for
his birthday and his mother finds him a key that works so that he can lock up his
toys.  The key, however, has magical powers and when young Omri puts in a toy
Indian figure given to him by his friend, Patrick (Rishi Bhat) and locks the
cupboard, the Indian somehow comes to life.  The only problem is, the live Indian
is the same size as the plastic figure.</p>

<p>The visual effects are fun and exciting.  The adults, Little Bear (played
wonderfully by Litefoot) and a cowboy named Boon (amusingly portrayed by David
Keith) give convincing performances, unlike the two young actors (Scardino and
Bhat), who are, obviously, far less experienced actors.  This is a morality play,
essentially, about the consequences of interfering with people's lives.  But
wrapped around this moral tale is the charming direction of Frank Oz, who chooses
(wisely, I think) not to beat the viewer over the head with too much
confrontation of the many issues which would naturally come up in such a
situation.  Instead, Mathison and Oz have chosen to make a film that is both
entertaining and has a simpler, more understandable message for children of all
ages, without preaching at us.</p>

<p>If you've been complaining that there isn't enough for good family
entertainment which you and your children can view together, <b>The Indian in the
Cupboard</b> may be the just the solution.  Enjoy.</p>

<h3>Books<br> <font size=-1>by K. Lowry</font></h3> <p><b>Love, Medicine &
Miracles</b> by Bernie S. Siegel MD.<br> “Do not die without having lived. Give
yourself the opportunity to show your true color and when you do go, go out in a
blaze of glory.”</p>

<p>If you have been reading Consumer News, you have met many remarkable people
who are living with AIDS, most of whom have been living with the disease for a
long time. Long term survivors of AIDS have much in common with the people in the
pages of Dr. Bernie S. Siegel’s books: <b>Love, Medicine</b>, and <b>Miracles and
Peace, Love, & Healing</b>. The observations of this surgeon about cancer
patients who have triumphed over their disease and the lessons learned about the
power of meditation, visualization, diet and exercise. The outcome: positive self
esteem and ultimately, a good life. </p>

<p>The book is not about dying of cancer or other terminal illnesses but about
living, really living - until life is through. Somehow attitude affects the
immune system. This is a book you should read. It has inspired many to live and
share the lessons of this loving life-healing message with others. He writes much
about loving -loving ourselves enough to heal ourselves of all the things that
are destroying our lives. I spoke with an infectious disease specialist who said
that “what Dr. Seigel writes about managing disease is just common sense -things
we have lost when we became experts.”</p>

<h3><a name="life">Lifestyles</a></h3>

<p>I refuse to live in the quagmire of impending disaster, “says Gary Jacinto, a
man living with an HIV/AIDS diagnosis since 1988. “Remember," he says, "the
Chinese word for crisis consists of two characters danger and opportunity. I
could have easily succumbed to danger -and been consumed by my diagnosis. I chose
opportunity. That choice changed my life."

<p>Gary came to terms with his AIDS quite unexpectedly in Nepal - a trip he took
in 1990 in celebration of his 50th birthday.  “A wonderful thing happened to me
in Nepal,” he states. “I saw the fear I was living with, not only fear of my
diagnosis, but also a general fear that permeated my entire life. I saw it and
then quite literally left it on the mountain.”</p>

<p>Upon returning to Manhattan, he discovered <b>The Whole Foods Project</b> and
become both a client and volunteer chef’s helper. He still is a regular volunteer
at the project. In fact Gary is surrounded by file folders - each representing
one of his volunteer activities.</p>

<p>He spent two year promoting organ donor awareness by organizing what would
have been the first climb of Mt, Everest by a heart transplant climber. More
recently he has co-facilitated a program on holistic health, spent weeks in Maine
and Rhode Island as a counselor at camps or families impacted with AIDS. He is
helping plan a “day camp” in the East Village for these families, is completing
two stories for publication -and is actively involved in church.</p>

<p>His AIDS advocacy extends to junior and senior high schools and recently he
has been asked by Teacher’s College, Columbia University, to present a class to
graduate students in Adolescent Psychology on techniques he uses. He laughs, “If
idle hands are the devil’s playthings, he doesn’t even know I exist.”</p>

<p>“We are a complex combination of many things,” he says, “mind body and spirit.
We’ve got to pay attention to Them all and when we do, no matter what comes up,
we are OK.”</p>

<p><b>Metro</b> March 19, 1996 "To live longer with AIDS is a cruel joke if there

<p>March 30, 1996, Secretary Henry Cisneros met with Housing Providers and PWAs
to respond to the specific Housing needs of PWAs. The Secretary reassured the
group of  his commitment to homeless people with AIDS. Secretary Cisneros has
been a true champion for PWAs He has met regularly with Housing advocates and
PWAs over the past two years. He has openly sought to understand the disease and
the problems which compound PWAs lives and responded with policy that effectively
brought housing, supportive services. The establishment of the Office of AIDS
Housing at HUD directed by Dr. Fred Karnas is a direct result of those
meetings.<br> <font size=-1><i>New York Times March 30, 1996 by PAMELA
MENDELS</i></font></p>

<p><b>Philadelphia</b><br> Huddled before computer terminals set up especially
for the occasion, three Federal judges in a Philadelphia courtroom took a brief
tour of the Internet on Thursday, the opening day of hearings in what could be a
landmark case on whether the Government may regulate speech in cyberspace. . .One
witness, Kiyoshi Kuromiya, who operates a Web page and computer bulletin board
devoted to health information about AIDS, said he was confused about whether the
law would deem his site unsuitable for children. "Someone might find material
that we find important offensive," he said.</p>

<p>When asked by Dalzell whether he would have to make changes to his sites if
the law stands, Kuromiya said he didn't know, because he considers the law
unclear. "I don't know what 'indecent' means," he said. "I don't know what
'patently offensive' means in terms of providing life saving information to
people with AIDS, including teen agers."</p>

<h3><a name="edit">Editorial</a></h3> <p>When you go to the doctor and you are
diagnosed with AIDS, this is confidential information, a private matter that will
remain  between you and your doctor . . . Right? . . . NOT! . . . Depending on
your circumstances many may come to know your HIV status throughout your life
with AIDS. There are government agencies  - the Centers for Disease Control,
health departments, the Social  Security Administration,  and Human Resources
Administrations. There are attorneys,  insurance companies, employers, employees,
landlords, neighbors, AIDS service organizations, the myriad of individuals who
work with and for them and so on . . .  The longer you live with the disease, 
the more you will interact with agencies - the less confidentiality you have.</p>

<p>The problem is, it is difficult to fight for something that is suppose to be a
secret - especially when the secret is only a secret fantasy. Information is very
easily obtained today and some people make their living by discovering what you
wish to keep to yourself. It is just too bad that people can gain by the
misfortune of others. I am sure we will never have another president who “cannot
tell a lie,”  nor will there be another citizen whose life can be kept truly
private.</p>

<p>But what are the implications for the AIDS epidemic? AIDS should be seen and
treated like a disease, not a dirty little secret to hide in a closet. Until it
is there can be no dignity in our lives. The truth is, confidentiality is
expensive. The most visible PWAs are the poor whose confidentiality is
compromised just because they need. Before people with AIDS started demanding
attention, people with AIDS died quickly and quietly.</p>

<h3><a name="op">OP-ED</a><br> <font size=-1>by JoAnne Page</font></h3>

<p>In the first wave of the AIDS epidemic, models of intervention needed to be
developed to reach gay, white men. In the second wave of the epidemic, models of
intervention need to be developed to reach those whose risk factor is that of
substance abuse. The face of the epidemic is changing, and now is the face of
someone Black or Latino who is a substance abuser or the lover or child of a
substance abuser.</p>

<p>There were lessons that were learned in the first wave of the epidemic,
including the necessity of peer-based intervention that was culturally sensitive
and used the language and imagery of the communities effected by the epidemic.
Through a long struggle, gay white men with personal experience of the virus
fought their way to the table as decisions on policy and programs were made.</p>

<p>The models that worked for the first will not work for the second generation.
However, the lessons learned-that interventions must be culturally-specific,
targeted to the people effected, and involve a decision-making role by the
representatives of the community hit hardest by the epidemic -are powerful
lessons that apply, as well, to the second generation.</p>

<p>If effective intervention in the second generation of the AIDS epidemic is to
occur, it must reach the population that is entangled in the criminal justice
system. Because of this nation”s doomed, self-destructive, and passionately
pursued "war on drugs", the place to find poor people of color with substance
abuse issues is in the criminal justice system. The <a
href="http://www.calyx.net/~schaffer/other/sp/sp.html"><b>Sentencing
Project</b></a> in Washington, D.C. recently found that one in three young, black
men is under the supervision of the criminal justice system at any given time.
The statistics are even higher for our poorest communities and, yet, the policy
and intervention on HIV prevention and services has largely avoided the criminal
justice system. To continue to do so is to choose to ignore a critical
opportunity for intervention.</p>

<p>There really are three windows of opportunity for intervention in the criminal
justice system. Local jails such as Rikers Island process thousands of new
arrestees a week, some 70% of whom have substance abuse histories. Although the
length of stay in a city jail is short, the high volume of substance abusers
passing through offers a critical opportunity for education and linkage service.
The jail population is primarily a pre-sentence population. Individuals who are
sentenced offer an opportunity for more in-depth intervention to a smaller number
of people. Being incarcerated is a time of hitting bottom and a time in which
people question their lives and are often open to intervention than they are on
the street and actively drug-involved. It is while such individuals are in
custody that they can be reached with a more intensive intervention that will
help support behavior change and reduced likelihood of high-risk behavior upon
release. Here, also, harm reduction techniques can be taught and the process for
drug treatment can begin.</p>

<p>Models for intervention with prisoners and ex-offenders need to be tested,
evaluated, and once proven, expanded to meet the scale of the problem. The  <a
href="#ethics">ETHICS model</a>, described elsewhere in this publication, is one
effective model for reaching HIV-positive persons in custody and after
release.</p>

<p>In the second generation of the AIDS epidemic, it is essential that
intervention occur with the people who are most effected and in the places where
such individuals are concentrated. The criminal justice system where such
individuals are concentrated. The criminal justice system provides an opportunity
for such intervention that cannot be missed.<br> <font size=-1>JoAnne Page Esq.

<h3><a name="pioneers">The</a> Pioneers . . . and Friends<br>
Women Defining Their Own HIV/AIDS Advocacy Agenda</h3>
<p><font size=-2><b>by Tracie Gardner</b></font></p>

<p><i>"The Pioneers are women living with HIV who have come together in a world that is seldom a comfort and often a threat to them, to work for change in the laws, policies, and practices that govern their lives. Their goal is to change the way society perceives and treats women with HIV through education and advocacy, and by ensuring that the presence and voices of women with HIV are acknowledged and heard in the arenas in which decisions are made about their lives. Their legacy is one of strength and courage, and willingness to fight on their own behalf and speak in their own voices which will be passed on to women who follow."</i></p>

<p>In November of 1995, 24 women living with HIV and social service providers traveled to the <b>Trinity Conference Center</b> in West Cornwall, Connecticut. The <b>Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies</b> sponsored the event. They  assembled a group of women living with HIV, social service providers, and AIDS advocates to discuss issues defined by the women themselves. They discussed the need for better understanding of HIV/AlDS related advocacy issues and the necessity of community organizing.</p>

<p>The women who participated in the retreat were associated with such groups as: <b>Minority Task Force on AIDS, Community Family Planning Council, Housing Works, Stand Up Harlem, United: Bronx Parents, Harlem United, St. Mary's, Steinway Children and Family Services, Tower East Side Family Union, Harlem Interfaith</b> and the <b>Women and AIDS Resource Network</b>. The assumption was that women who live with HIV /AIDS should address public policy decisions that affect their lives. It was important to have women living with HIV, service providers and professional advocates come together to acknowledge different perspectives and different experiences. Equally significant, the women were afforded the opportunity to recognize similarities and common enemies - apathy, discrimination and ignorance in the lives of people living with, HIV.</p>

<p>Ivonne N. noted that this retreat was especially important because, Frequently women are the forgotten ones because we have to take care of everybody else. It's good to come among ourselves to talk about our own issues.</p>

<p>One woman, who did not want to be identified, as she had just discovered she was HIV positive two months before the retreat said,  it's been real hard since I found out my diagnosis . . . some days I wake up and I don't even think about it and other days I'm so depressed . . .  I talk about [how I am feeling] but it doesn't always make the feeling go away. </p>

<p>Idell, a woman living with HIV and a service provider,  feels she has a unique role in speaking about issues that are important to people living with HIV and those who provide services to them. "Dealing with people who are positive gives me a chance to help people go through what they need to -- to bond with family members who are in crisis, (especially since I am aware of what they are going through), and I think I am an example to let them know to keep going because there is hope, and life can . . . and will get better."</p>

<p>Clarissa M. notes that women must use all resources available, including each other to educate themselves.   I had to learn what it was to educate myself. I can be educated anywhere; school, in the street, spiritually. And with all the education, I still need to empower myself so I don't have to wait for someone else to speak for me."</p>

<p>The discussions touched on issues such as: the role of HIV related advocacy  in women's  lives, the need for women to be their own advocates on policy issues that affect their lives and strategies for developing honest collaborations with service providers to have the best impact on HIV related policy.</p>

<p>Yvonne also noted that it is important that women understand what public policy issues are, and why the perspectives of women dealing with HIV and AIDS are so important to make policy more responsive to the needs of people affected by It. She gave as an example some frustrations she feels during the daily interaction with her DAS case manager. "Why are you going to have me come down here every day for $5.00? That's just $2.50 for my son and $2.50 for my daughter. I can't even take them to McDonald's for that! Furthermore, I can't even get back home with that."</p>

<p>Idell illustrated another example of the frustrations the women felt. Recounting her dealings with New York City Child Welfare Administration, she said, "I was trying to get my children out of foster care. The issue came Up that my children were with my mother and she couldn't take care of them anymore. The youngest was acting out and had to go to a group home. All of a sudden, the focus was on me and my status. I had been clean a year and a half and now the judge wants a note from the doctor stating how my condition was.  I couldn't understand why all of a sudden it became about my health and not my children's needs. </p>

<p>Shahira M. said,  "People living with HIV and AIDS, especially women had to become their own advocates on HlV related medical and health policy issues, because in some cases it's a matter of living or dying of the disease. . . Many people are looking into holistic health [options] over pharmaceuticals because [holistic] is working better - -no one wants to cover that. Medicaid won't help you buy vitamins - -that makes no sense!"

<p>As I reached the corner, I looked upward through the rain and saw that devilish little man reaching out to me and smiling impishly.  Appropriately housed in the Puck building, the <b>Children's Hope Foundation</b> is a volunteer-driven, not-for-profit organization dedicated to improving the quality of life for children living with HIV disease and AIDS. Executive Director Liza Josephson said, "We hope to fill some of the many gaps in services these children and their families experience." <b>CHF</b> proudly boasts more than 500 volunteers who help the small professional staff of three respond to the needs of over 3,400 children living with HIV disease and AIDS. </p>

<p>For infant twins and their mother (homeless until a social worker helped secure an apartment and rent assistance) <b>CHF</b> has provided cribs, highchairs and a double stroller.  To newborns and toddlers <b>CHF</b> provides formulas, diapers and furniture through Community-Based Organizations and AIDS Service Organizations.  Through caseworkers and health care professionals, <b>CHF</b> makes emergency funds available to families for rent, utilities and medical services. They have provided air fare and travel arrangements to many children and their guardians to attend clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland. Everything from stethoscopes to specialized machineries are donated to neighborhood clinics and major medical centers. For example,  <b>CHF</b> donated a pulse oximeter to Harlem Hospital to help nurses and physicians better provide for the early intervention necessary to protect children from opportunistic infections.  Volunteers regularly plan trips, outings and other recreational activities for respite and social needs of afflicted children. </p>

<p>Responding to requests from health care professionals and case workers, <b>CHF</b> mounted a symposium, "Pain Management for Children with HIV and AIDS," which was attended by more than 150 HIV service professionals.  The symposium addressed topics including pharmacological treatment of childhood pain, pain management in substance abusing families, distraction and mental imagery techniques, hospice care and techniques for care givers.</p>

<h3><a name="housing">Housing</a></h3>

<h4>Families</h4>
<font size=-2>by K. Lowry</font></b></p>

<font size=-1><p>The families that were strong advocates for themselves were the most successful in getting adequate housing. The problems were varied.  One married couple complained that they were continually being separated --sent to different SRO hotels while waiting for permanent housing. The most poignant representation of the same-sex households recalled memories  sixties.  We want to continue to live together,  said one woman,  even though our housing is in jeopardy if we do. I feel like I m breaking the law --just being in love.  Families with a more  traditional  posture fared better.</p> 

<h4>Rental Assistance</h4>

<p>Michelle said,  I live in a condominium apartment which is great for our needs. This DAS-approved rental assistance housing is a good choice for my needs. I love  my housing. I have to do most of my own maintenance which is difficult . . .  but that s Ok. I have a good place for my family to live.  I volunteer for an AIDS organization but I m unable to work and maintain my medical benefits. I am very happy with an apartment that I can maintain for my family and pleased to have the help of the Division of AIDS Services . . . </p>

<h4>Housing Placement Assistance</h4>

<p>Dorothy is HIV positive and lives in a small apartment in Harlem. Through the Housing Placement Assistance program, she was able to rent a suitable apartment.  The apartment was nice and spacious, I received Food Stamps and Medicaid, but I had such a small amount of money to live on, that I found it difficult to do anything but go to the doctor and back home. I wanted to work but I could not afford to be without medical coverage for myself or my son. I looked for work for a long time. I needed more money and I needed help. I am HIV positive and I don t want to get full-blown AIDS in order to take care of my needs. </p>

<p>Dorothy found a job with an AIDS organization which enrolled her in a managed care organization. She said that she still had some difficulties getting some of her medicines because of the plan she is in, but is happy to be working now. She and her 15-year-old son moved to a smaller place because she couldn t pay the rent herself in the rental assistance apartment.  That apartment was nice and in a better neighborhood than this one, but my rent was the highest in the building. I couldn t afford to pay it by myself. The landlord knew he could get it from the City and he wouldn t lower the rent for me. I applied for section eight three years ago . . .  I called them to ask when I could expect to get it. They said call back in three more years. So I moved . . . I was lucky to find a job that I liked and had the medical benefits that I needed.</p>

<p>Dorothy, like the other women  I interviewed, illustrates what strength and determination can do. . . even when the odds are stacked against them. . . These remarkable women are beacons that illuminate the power of self motivation and love. A constant theme among the people I interviewed, was a desire to get things ordered in their lives. There was this sense of urgency that was often viewed as impatience by the countless numbers of professionals that invaded their lives. Something happens when PWAs get together, like there is some other presence --the prospect of death. I was moved by the enthusiasm for life and love that these women had, in spite of this presence. In conclusion, motivation, ingenuity and enthusiasm are advantages in life. They are necessary requirements for accessing adequate DAS housing. . .and ultimately,  for the triumph over AIDS.</p>

<h4>HIV/Aids Experience in Children</h4>

<font size=-1><p>Children with HIV/AIDS, like adults, represent the full spectrum of disease -- from the very sick infant who has a short and difficult battle with the disease, to the latent or undiagnosed population with minimal medical or developmental involvement.  The most vulnerable of this population are infants who are exposed perinatally. This risk factor can be greatly reduced with proper awareness, prenatal testing and prenatal treatment. Teenagers are usually exposed through their risk-taking behavior, which is well recognized.  It is the responsibility of adults in society to educate and  reach out to this group if we want to control their exposure.</p>
        
<p>Pediatricians and Obstetrician Gynecologists must educate their patients and parents.  HIV exposure in the perinatal period must be viewed as any other perinatal exposure that causes damage to the fetus.  HIV should be tested for in all routine prenatal care.  Diagnosis of maternal HIV and proper treatment during pregnancy can greatly increase the chances for the delivery of a non-HIV infected infant.  Infants with perinatal HIV must be registered from birth into one of the many pediatric infectious disease clinics to maximize chances for normal development.  At present, there are a number of open protocols  for children with HIV.</p>

<p>HIV is an infectious disease and society must get beyond the stigma.  Eventually a cure, or treatment which is effective, will be developed.  We have, in the last Century, seen other diseases that were considered incurable, and now are considered treatable or curable such as TB, leprosy and syphilis.</p>

<p>Children unlike their adult counterparts may only understand that they are sick and isolated from normal activities. The goal for all children, but especially this sub group is to nurture and expose them to the most secure family unit possible. This goal is often difficult in a family unit that is being destroyed by HIV. Children need a time and a place to socialize and an opportunity to escape their harsh reality . The children in a family touched by HIV-whether they themselves are infected or not, need emotional supports and outlets to compensate. We must all take the responsibility for the availability and consistency of funding for counseling and recreational outlets as well as further research through our political power as a united group.</p>

<p>The Metro Card (presumably hassle free) will solve the problem for many, but will present difficulties for others. The Cards may be purchased for $5.00 to $80.00 and renewed or increased by  $1.00 or more. However, many PWAs will find it difficult to use as they populate areas where the equipment is not in place. This policy is in compliance with the law, but  the MTA has failed to address the issue of illegal inquiry. </p>

<p>Similar complaints have been reported with regard to court clerks interviewing PWAs for jury duty.  If you are interviewed for jury duty you are not required to disclose your HIV status. If you receive a summons to report for duty and you are unable to serve, you may be required to bring a letter from your physician.  The letter should state that you are disabled and will not be able to serve.  It is not necessary or required that your physician disclose in the letter the nature of your disability, i.e., that you are HIV+ or that you have AIDS.  Such information should be kept in a separate file by the court.  You may then receive a medical deferment.  If you decide that you are able to serve, you will be interviewed by attorneys (except in grand jury service).  These attorneys may legally ask that you disclose the nature of your disability.  If you refuse, the judge may order you to answer.  If so, you have a legal right to request that the question be answered in private, before the judge and the attorneys only.</p>

<h3>Nutri-bites</h3>

<p>Asa Aarons, Consumer Reporter of NBC News reported that iced tea in several of City stores is potentially dangerous  to the health of people with compromised immune systems. The tea was sometimes prepared with equipment that had not been properly cleaned. Iced tea from two of the stores which NBC bought and analyzed, contained some fecal materials suggesting unclean handling. Finally another of the findings pointed to other problems of preparation and storage. </p>

<p><b>Consumer News</b> reported in this column,  January 1996 serve hot food hot and cold food cold and we add that cooked  food should be stored in the refrigerator. Consumer News recommends that to be safe, buy or make <i>brewed hot tea</i> and pour it over ice. While the NBC News report indicated the danger to the general public, be advised that the danger is significant to people with severely compromised immune systems. </p>

<p><i>A review of current and not-so-current video releases at a bargain and available for home viewing.</i></p>

<p><b>Love and Human Remains<br>
 <font size=-2>by Dan Battles</font></b></p>

<p>A Sony Classics release of a film directed by Denys Arcand ("Jesus of Montreal") and based on the Brad Fraser play "Unidentified Human Remains and the True Nature of Love" "Love and Human Remains" is a dark and foreboding story of sexual confusion and frustration, centered around David (Thomas Gibson) a former child television star who returns to his home town in Canada only to work as a waiter because he is terrified of having to audition for acting parts.  The story revolves around David and his odd assortment of friends.  First there is his roommate, Candy (Ruth Marshall), who is sexually frustrated enough to experiment with lesbian love while simultaneously exploring a possible relationship with a male bartender.  Her frustration is compounded by the fact that she is really in love with David, who is decidedly homosexual, although he and Candy did once have an affair.  Then there is Bernie (Cameron Bancroft), David's childhood best friend, a sexually compulsive heterosexual, who although straight, has deep and inexplicable feelings of resentment for their loss of closeness in their relationship.  Another friend, Benita (Mia Kirshner) is a hooker who specializes in S&M fantasies.  She too is somehow captivated by our waiter David, but also remains frustrated by his aloofness and seeming lack of sexual drive.  Finally, there is Kane, a busboy at the restaurant where David works, who is fascinated by David but cannot distinguish whether his admiration comes from hero worship or because he is having sexual identity problems.</p>

<p>This is a character study more than anything else.  The characters are well developed for the most part with interesting internal lives. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the plot gets in the way of this film being truly inspired.  As a result, it unfolds like a bad episode of Columbo and obscures the further development of the true crises in these peoples' lives.  It seems that although everyone admires and/or loves David, our hero doesn't feel the same about himself.  In fact, all of the characters seem to hate their lives to some degree or another.  And, although this is yet another tale about the lonely and desperate lives of homosexuals, these people are somehow very real. </p>

<p>Their problems can be related to by vast numbers of gays and straights.  Many of us are without significant relationships and the loneliness that is created by the seemingly futile search for love is something most all of us have experienced at one time or another.  The serial killer plot line becomes insignificant compared to the pain suffered by David and his friends.</p>

<p>Although it will never be one of my all time favorite films, it was interesting to watch and kept my attention throughout.  The cinematography is exquisite; shot on location in Canada, it enhances the darkness of feeling that permeates this film.  And, there is enough sex and violence to keep even the most diehard happy.  Perhaps this is not a very remarkable film;
however, it somehow has stuck with me, replaying its characters' lives in my mind again and again, because no matter how hard it may be to admit, there is a little of each of these characters in all of us.  Loneliness is not, after all, the exclusive province of one group of people.  We are all subject to its machinations of the soul and psyche at one time or another.</p>

<p>If you are looking for something visually stimulating which will cause you to pause and think, then I recommend picking up a copy of "Love and Human Remains" at your local video store. </p>

<h3>Books for kids</h3>

<p><b>Jimmy and the Eggs Virus<br>

<font size=-2><i>From an original idea by Graffino, MD.</i></font></p>

<h3><a name="hiv">HIV</a>/AIDS Information on the World Wide Web</h3>

<p><font size=-2><b>by Joel Beard, Web Manager, <a href="http://www.aidsnyc.org">www.aidsnyc.org</a></b></font></p>

<p>Every public library branch in New York City has or will soon have a computer hooked up to the Internet that you can use. Part of the Internet, called the World Wide Web, is full of information about all sorts of health issues. Many sites on the World Wide Web are full of information related to the issues surrounding HIV and AIDS -medical, social, spiritual, and more.</p>

<p>You don't need a lot of computer know-how to explore the World Wide Web's vast amounts of information. Computers are available for you to use at a private medical library on E. 103rd St. called the New York Academy of Medicine, as well as the public branch libraries. The Academy is open Monday through Friday 9:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m.. Seven computers are currently available to the public, and more will be installed in the near future. </p>

<p>The Academy's HIV/AIDS Information Outreach Project has a World Wide Web site that puts information from community-based organizations in New York City in one place. On this site, you can find information about currently enrolling in clinical trials, which are studies of new drugs for HIV and opportunistic infections, reports from recent conferences about a new treatment for HIV called protease inhibitors, <b>Consumer News</b>, and PWAC/NY's newsletter, <a href="http://www.aidsnyc.org/pwac/">Newsline</a>. The site, which is registered under the name <a href="http://www.aidsnyc.org">www.aidsnyc.org</a>, continues to grow. Community-based organizations that will be including their information on the site include the Momentum AIDS Project, a nutrition program for people with HIV and AIDS, and Bailey-Holt House, a residence and scattered-site housing program.</P.

<p>Two workshops in the Academy's computer lab are scheduled for March 1 and March 15, 1996. The workshops are free. The workshops will teach you how to use a computer to find information about HIV and AIDS on the World Wide Web. Each workshop is from 9:30 to 1:00, with hands-on practice until 4:00. You don't have to know anything about computers or the World Wide Web to participate. All are invited. Just call Peter Wansor, Coordinator of the Project, at (212) 876-8200 x 318 to register.</p>

<p>For those who are interested, advanced workshops will be scheduled on how to format pages that can be viewed on the World Wide Web. Each section of <b>www.aidsnyc.org</b> needs someone to make sure the information is current and that new pages are designed and put on the site in a timely manner. The person responsible for this is called the Web Manager. Consumer News will be appearing regularly on the Web, and we're hoping someone would like to volunteer to be the Web Manager for their site.</p>

<h3><a name="va">The</a> Veterans  Administration Reaches Out to Homeless Veterans Living with HIV/AIDS</h3>

<p>The <b>Veterans  Administration's CHALENG Program</b> is an outreach effort to reach homeless veterans in the New York Metropolitan Area. They provide many direct services or links to public and private agencies to meet the needs of homeless Veterans. Marsha Martin, Director of Homeless Services for the VA, in her keynote address to the <b>CHALENG Outreach</b> ceremony, noted that the Veterans  Administration seeks to encourage Community-based Organizations to work with local VA Medical Centers to identify needy veterans. The VA can help Veterans associated with CBOs in the following areas: Housing and Food information, Mental Health and Substance Abuse counseling, HIV testing, counseling and Medical treatment, Benefits and Job referrals.</p>

<p>These programs offer HIV testing and counseling, prevention presentations, and support groups for PWAs. The Veterans  Administration Medical Centers (VAMC) provide treatment and medication for Veterans with HIV/AIDS. While the recent Congressional Budget cuts to the VA have strongly affected AIDS Research at the VA, you can get good care and treatment at the VAMC. However, the availability of some treatments will depend upon the appropriations. Let your Representatives know what you think. </p>    

,p>All persons who have served in the military and are in need of assistance are encouraged to call  (718) 254-6900 for more information. </p>

<p><i>(CHALENG is a National Program. Outside the New York Metropolitan Area call your local VA for details.)</i></p>

<p><b>"How do you tell your child she was born to be hurt."</b><br>
<i>from Imitation of Life</i><br>
<font size=-2><b>by K. Lowry</b></font></p>

<p>Michelle is a young, vibrant woman who has been living with AIDS for six years. She is the mother of two: Raven, a six year old girl who is HIV positive and Rondell, a nine year old boy who is negative. </p>
 
<p><b>Our Family</b><br>
Michelle says, "both my children are living with AIDS. Raven and Rondell are provided with information that is suitable for their age and grasp.  I told Rondell 3 years ago.  He asked me  Mommy, are you and Raven going to die ?  Sometime later he asked  what s going to happen to me if you die?   Raven knows that she is ill; I had to tell her.  She wanted to know why she was going to the doctor so much more than her brother.  She knows she is sick but, she doesn t know much about the illness."</p>

<p><b>Fears</b><br>
"My biggest fear is that Raven will meet up with adverse reactions from teachers and peers, now that she s in public school.  I know about this first hand. You see, she was in a safe space before -- a program where HIV+ children are counseled and the teachers are prepared to deal with the special needs of these children. This was good for the both of us.  We both were helped to deal with the emotions and fears we were having.</p> 

<p>When Raven entered public school I chose to disclose [our HIV status].  I felt I had to because she was scheduled for enrollment in a clinical trial in which a strict medication regimen was required.  I had to tell the Principal, who asked me to tell the teacher and the nurse. I had to  tell all three separately.  Their reaction was that of surprise and fear.  At the time, Raven had a cold and her nose was running,  The teacher then asked  is it safe for her to be with other children with that runny nose?   There didn t seem to be any practice or procedures which that  teacher was familiar with.  So, I called Dr. Bloom, who wrote the Standards for the New York City School system, <i>(Guidelines for children with HIV infection, HIV related Illness and or AIDS)</i> retrieved a copy and presented it to them."</p>

<p><b>Bad Days</b><br>
"I have some pretty bad days.  Sometimes I am hospitalized and it takes a toll on the children.  All of this frustration is telling on Rondell.  When I have bad days, he has bad days in school -- acting out and unable to concentrate.  This is tough on my family.</p>

<p>Was it easy to tell my kids? you ask.  How do you explain to your child such a terrible thing,  Explain that it is not her fault, but mine?  Fortunately, my son has counseling and time away form the family through the COPE program. I am thankful for this help."</p>

<p><b>Metro. . .</b><br>
GMHC has a new HIV-prevention program,  <b>Prevention is Our Weapon (POW)</b>. Trained volunteers will infiltrate sex clubs and movie houses to monitor unsafe sex and report back on how these establishments responsibly deal with such conduct. <b>POW</b> joins, but is not connected to, a year old New York City Department of Health initiative in which undercover inspectors look for public sex -acts,  forbidden by law. So far the City has closed eight clubs and movie houses. . .</p>

<p>The <b>Federal Health Care Financing Administration</b>, responsible for Medicare and Federal oversight of Medicaid, has awarded <b>GMHC</b> its Administrator's Achievement Award for extensive and compassionate service to persons with HIV infection and AIDS.</p>

<p>Noted photographer and longtime AIDS activist, <b>Brian Weil</b> was found dead in his apartment on February 6, 1996. He was a lead player in the city's Needle Exchange and Harm Reduction Movement. Weil worked with the <b>World Health Organization</b> to establish community based AIDS organizations in Haiti, South Africa and Thailand. Last Year he formed Citywide Harm Reduction United Methodist Church in the South Bronx, an innovated program servicing HIV infected drug users placed by DAS in SROs. Brian Weil was 41...</p>

<p>The Rev. <b>Ruben Diaz</b> resigned from the <b>Civilian Complaint Review</b> Board, the civic group responsible for monitoring police misconduct. Allegations of improper campaigning for his son, Reuben Diaz in a special election to fill a vacant Bronx seat in the State Assembly prompted his resignation. Mr. Diaz has been denounced for his anti-gay remarks and his attempts to stop the 1994 Gay Games because he said they would advance the spread of AIDS. Reuben Diaz was defeated in bid for the State Assembly seat by a four to one margin. </p>

<p><b>AIDS Service Center (ASC)</b> sponsored the hugely successful annual St. Valentine's Dinner Dance at St. Augustine s Church on the lower East Side. A reporter from Consumer News attended and was moved by that community s support for an event that memorialized Lower East Siders who have passed on and celebrated those who are living with the virus. The coming together of people of divergent ages -from grandmothers to toddlers -was a truly remarkable affirmation of one neighborhood s fight against AIDS. </p>

<p><b>State. . .</b><br>
<b>New York State Athletic Commission</b> will screen boxers for HIV. This comes after the huge publicity following heavyweight champion contender. Tommy Morrison s Nevada suspension from the sport after he tested positive for HIV. New York joins Nevada, Washington Oregon, Arizona, and Puerto Rico in making testing mandatory.</p>

<p><b>Nation. . .</b><br>
<b>President Clinton</b> signed a military appropriations bill on February 10, 1996 and directed the Attorney General not to defend a provision mandating the Pentagon to discharge troops who test HIV positive. The provision was tacked on to the bill by the  right-wing, Republican Congressman from California, <b>Robert Dornan</b>. Dornan stated in a letter to the New York Times that  99.9% of HIV infected personnel have broken the Uniform Code of Military Justice with activities that led to acquiring the disease. </p>

<p>Bi-partisan efforts are underway in the Senate and the House to repeal the provision.  Republican Representative Peter G. Turkildsen of Massachusetts said,  If Magic Johnson can play basketball after five years with HIV, then a dedicated American ought to be able to serve his or her country.</p>

<p><b>The Politics of  No</b><br>
<font size=-2><b>by Gina Quattrochi</b></font></p>

<p>The Managed Care movement is creating a quiet revolution that will dramatically affect care and choices about care for HIV infected persons on Medicaid. Utilizing an old concept of care  gatekeeper , managed care systems will impose limits on access to and utilization of health care and other services for PWAs in New York State and elsewhere. Since these systems are being reinvented to minimize health care spending, prevent duplication of services and ultimately control access, the survival of New York City style AIDS care is precarious.</p>

<p>Over the last decade PWAs, advocates, and agencies like <b>Bailey-Holt House</b> have struggled to weave a complex tapestry of care and services that could support virtually everyone living with HIV disease. Built into this  quilt of care were revolutionary approaches like needle exchange, harm reduction and non-institutionalized supportive housing -systems which changed the minds of old guard providers and bureaucrats. Thumbing our noses at the  establishment , aids activists were arrested for handing out needles, jailed for smuggling experimental drugs to those who needed them, and denied funding for programs for programs which seemed too  cutting edge . </p>

<p>Nevertheless we forged on. Fueled by our anger we fought against institutionalization of homeless people with AIDS -we demanded safe and permanent housing, we defied the trend to build more AIDS nursing homes and little housing -we hounded the FDA -we pushed clinical trials and experiments in all types of care. We did not take no for an answer -our friends, lovers, brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, and children were dying- no was not an option.</p>

<p>And we were victorious to a certain extent. Many of us who staged die ins and called anyone who got in the way murderer were given funding and set free on the social service/health care world. For a while we rocked the boat - we went into the crack houses, we housed people the City deemed  unhousable  - we pushed AIDS prevention with graphic sexual material, we handed out condoms to at-risk adolescents. We learned to run agencies that turned on a dime and rivaled the fortune Five Hundred in efficiency and risk taking.</p>

<p>Instead of receiving kudos from the public and private sector, however we were condemned by Jesse Helms, scorned by the far right, and rejected by many of our social service colleagues. We were too  in your face , too angry and too radical. But our friends, mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters and children were still dying -restraint was not an option.</p>

<p>Now we face our biggest challenge. At a time when many of us are burnt out, dying and still counting our dead -at a time when our agencies depend on government dollars and survival may mean keeping our mouths shut -we find ourselves in the midst of a quiet revolution of restraint and limitation. In five years from now AIDS care may look very different - only services that minimize high-end utilization of in patient care and emergency rooms will survive this proposed system. But what about the rest? What about the services that help make living with AIDS tolerable?</p>

<p>The tapestry of care woven over a decade with the blood, sweat, and precious time of many already dead will be frayed and ripped beyond recognition. The beautifully crafted [quilt] of New York City continuum of care may yet end up in someone s rag pile.</p>

<p>We are being pushed to accept funding cuts - a little at a time. We are being lulled into a sense of complacency if our individual programs are spared. We are being pushed to get ready for managed care and plan our demise. But our friends, lovers, mothers, fathers and children are still dying -in record numbers- can we afford restraint and accept no when so much is at stake?</p>

<p>The next few years will challenge the heart and soul of anyone who believes in the current system of AIDS care. While we certainly have to evaluate what we have accomplished and redirect some of our agencies and funding -we must continue to be courageous and visionary. We must advocate for what is needed -we must continue to push for those services that support life.</p>

<p>We know after a decade of experience that what we do is already cost effective. A recent report by the Robin Hood Foundation, for example, shows that formerly homeless PWAs in supportive housing have much lower in-patient utilization than the national average. And the incidence of long term care need among this group is almost nil. Supportive housing already saves hundreds of millions of dollars per year. And its boost to the quality of life is unmeasurable. Our friends, lovers, brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers and children are still homeless with AIDS -is less really an option?</p>

<p>Partnerships of consumers, advocates, and private funders will once again have to come together to push the bottom line and eliminate  no  as an option as we did in the 1980's. We may once again have to be daring and unconventional. We may once again have to drum up the anger and put our integrity before our survival. Our friends, lovers, brothers, sisters, and children are still dying - in record numbers - is  no really an option?</p>

<p><b>Case Managers</b><br>
<p>If you are living with AIDS chances are you will at some point or another have a relationship with a case manager.  A case manager can be of great assistance to you or, a stressful annoyance. These workers are often privy to the most intimate details of your life.  Because public and private agencies with different responsibilities employ case managers, knowing what they can and will do is important.  The best way to know this is to ask.  Some case managers will work with you for short periods of time (intensive or crisis case management), and others will work with you continually (ongoing case management).  Having confidence in your case manager is of vital importance.  You can and should interview them, and always be candid with them.  They are an integral part of your treatment team and you will no doubt come to depend upon them, especially in the later stages of AIDS.</p>  

<p>Case managers can direct you to the services you may require.  Think about your needs beforehand.  Let your manager know what you need and be as specific as possible. For example, your housing and nutritional needs,  your medical requirements and your psychological and social support concerns for yourself, your children and  other family members.  If you are having difficulty expressing these concerns, let your case manager know this.  This can open the dialogue and assist the case manager to help you define your needs.  Or, you can ask your case manager to help you identify and list your requirements.  After you have identified your needs, ask your case manager how they can help you solve these problems or assist you in obtaining the services you require.  Write it down and ask for a copy of your case plan when it is ready. </p>

<p>If you lose confidence in your case manager you will also need to discuss this directly with them.  Be calm but be specific.  Remind them that they are critical to maintaining your quality of your life.  If however, you are unable to resolve a problem with your case worker, schedule a meeting with their supervisor.  You have a right to ask that a different case manager be assigned to you.  If you are uncomfortable with the outcome of a meeting with the supervisor, contact Consumer News so that we can keep track these interactions.  Remember, case managers cannot cure AIDS nor can they solve all your problems. They can, however, help you to find possible solutions to your specific problems or direct you to services which address your specific needs. They can be your lifeline in times of crisis.</p>

<p><b><a name="facts">Education</a>! Education! Education!</b><br>
<font size=-1>The three most important issues facing American families concerning acquired immunodeficiency disease syndrome (AIDS).</p>

<p>February is Black History Month. Consumer News offers these facts and statistics for your information.</font></p>
<font size=-1>
<ul>
<li><b>The Four Million Man March</b>: It is estimated that 0ne in Thirty-three Black Men are Infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus in the U.S.
<br>
<li>The rate of human immunodeficiency  virus (HIV) infection drops significantly among individuals who are armed with preventive information.
<br>
<li>HIV Infection among Teenagers is a Serious Public Health Crisis.
<br>
<li>Substance abuse increases the risk of HIV infection.
<br>
<li>Hon-Hispanic blacks represent 30 percent of all reported acquired  immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases in the United States, but make up only 12 percent of the U.S. population.
<br>
<li>Racial and ethnic disparities in AIDS incidences are more striking for women and children than they are for men.
<br>
<li>Of adult and adolescent blacks reported with AIDS in the United States, 21 percent are female. In comparison, among the general U.S. adult/adolescent population, 12 percent of people reported with AIDS cases are female.
<br>
<li>In 1988, in both New York State and New Jersey, HIV/AIDS became the leading cause of death among non-Hispanic black  women 15-44 years of age.
<br>
<li>The probability of male HIV infection is greater among persons incarcerated in the criminal justice system. Fifteen per cent of the male prison population is HIV positive.
<br>
<li>Stop Prison Rapes Inc. estimates  83,000 male to male sexual encounters including rapes in U.S. prisons daily. (multiple rapes are factored into this number).
<br>
<li>In the State of New York one in three (32.2%) black men between the ages of 20 and 29 are incarcerated or otherwise detained by  the criminal justice system at a cost of eight (8) million dollars a day. If this trend continues, in the year 2000,  one in two of New York State’s  young black men can be contacted through the criminal justice system. The current law increases that dollar amount by twenty 20 billion dollars over the next 20 years.
<br>
<li>A report conducted in Illinois prisons on the transmission of HIV within the system, which the CDC has not yet published, found that a minimum of one third of one per cent of the adult males in Illinois state prisons become HlV infected every year.
<br>
<li>Black men represent one third of the cumulative cases of AIDS since 1985 to the present time.
<br>
<li>The median age of Black men with AIDS is 28.1 years.
<br>
<li>One in four Black males will die before the age of 25. (AIDS is not factored  into this  figure)
<br>
<li>Homeless people are at greater risk of HIV infection.
<br>
<li>AIDS makes children orphans.
<br>
<li>The average age of a  homeless person in the US is nine years old.
<br>
<li>Six of every ten U.S. children with perinatal acquired AIDS are black. 
<br>
<li>More than 2,500 AIDS cases have been reported among black U.S. children under the age of 13, and 95 percent of them acquired HIV infection from their mothers during pregnancy or at birth.
<br>
<li>HIV/AIDS is the second leading cause of death for non-Hispanic black children  1-4 years of age in New York State. 
<br>
<li>These statistics emphasize the gravity of the problem in the black community.

<li>There is no escaping the implications of these statistics on the survival of black families. The virus that causes AIDS is infecting black men and women disproportionately. Many of our black  children are born with HIV/Aids. Respecting February, Black History month these statistics concentrate on the state of the epidemic in the Black Community. However, exposure to HIV through any of the accepted modes of transmission, rather than membership in any major risk group, is the sole reason for infection. There is substantial cause for concern, because the toxic mix of funding cuts and the lack of information will lead to an increase inthe number of new AIDS cases.

<h3><a name="feds">Feds</a> Pull the Plug on Minority Treatment /Research Program</h3>

<p>Federally funded research in the AIDS Clinical Trials Research Group (ACTG) program has eliminated three sites in New York City. The studies for closure are associated with Albert Einstein College of Medicine / Montefiore Medical Center, Suny / Brooklyn and Columbia University / Harlem. All three treat significant numbers of people in marginal groups; women, substance abusers and people of color, who make up the greatest number of new AIDS cases.</p>

<p>The minority communities and medical indigents served by these Hospitals / Medical Centers in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Harlem, once again must adjust to the deep cuts of the Congressional budget ax. Three other programs,  Mt. Sinai, Memorial Sloan - Kettering and New York University Medical Center, all on the predominantly white East Side remain funded. Carlos Maldonado of the NYU ACTU Advisory Board said,  We are very upset about these cuts and closings, particularly the Brooklyn site where they have done such fine work.</p>

<h3><a name="how">How</a> AIDS Patients Can be Cheated<br>
<font size=-2><i>by John Renner, MD</i></font></h3>

<p>One of the fastest-growing areas of quackery is in fraudulent therapies, treatments, services and "cures" for AIDS and useless devices for the prevention of AIDS.</p>

<p>AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus.  HIV attacks certain white blood cells the body needs for resistance to infection.  In most cases people with AIDS do not die of the virus; they die from infections or cancers that are able to elude the AIDS-crippled immune system.  For this reason, AIDS is fought on many fronts, against many infectious organisms and other diseases.</p>

<p>To date there is no proven cure for AIDS. The most promising treatment involves a drug called zidovudine, or azidothymidine, know as AZT, which inhibits the reproduction of the HIV in AIDS patients. However, many people with AIDS cannot take the drug because of its side effects.</p>

<p>According to an article in a Food and Drug Administration publication, FDA Consumer, "AIDS is a quack's dream come true; a...disease surrounded by fear and ignorance...tailor-made for the enterprising huckster who will stir up a caldron of deceit to turn a quick profit."</p>

<p>The purveyors of AIDS quackery are busy selling worthless or ineffective products to people with AIDS or with the HIV infection.  The "remedies," according to FDA Consumer, include processed blue-green algae selling for $20 a bottle; injections of hydrogen peroxide; the food preservative BHT; pills derived from mice that have been given the AIDS virus; and herbal capsules that were found to contain poisonous metals.</p>

<p>Also, many books promoting AIDS quackery are being sold.  These books claim AIDS can be cured by macrobiotic diets and by other special diets; by use of massage techniques; and by messages from "beings" from other worlds contacted through channeling.</p>

<p>Most remedies being sold for AIDS are bogus products that their sellers claim will "boost the immune system."  One such product is processed T-cells, available through the mail at two bottles for $25.  The claim, that these can replace the body's own T-cells hit by the AIDS virus, is outrageous.  According to Dr. Jeffrey Laurence, director of the AIDS Laboratory at New York Hospital, scientists do not know of a single substance that effectively and safely boosts the immune system.</p>

<p>Many AIDS hucksters have therapies for cancer, arthritis and other ailments and have begun to market them for AIDS.  Some of the Mexican or other foreign "alternative" cancer clinics now claim that they can cure AIDS, too.  They offer a variety of unusual diagnostic tests that have no scientific value.  They also promote dubious therapeutic remedies.  Some Mexican clinics charge $6,000 to $20,000 for treatments.  One advertised clinic in Zaire in Africa charges $50,000 to $75,000 for two months of "treatment" with an unknown protein.</p>

<p>Not content with defrauding AIDS sufferers, hucksters also have moved into manipulating the public's fear of AIDS by selling a variety of bogus preventive and protective products.</p>

<p>Science has determined that AIDS is not transmitted through normal household contacts, such as sharing drinking glasses or eating utensils; through casual contact, such as holding hands, hugging or superficial kissing; through pets or insects; through sneezing, sweating or tears; or through contact with toilet seats, telephones or other items.</p>

<p>Despite this, big money is being made by selling sprays, cloth wipes, covers for phone mouthpieces, covers for toilet seats or other items to "protect" people from the virus.  These hucksters are spreading and publishing incorrect information about AIDS to further their own economic goals.</p>

<p>As long as the public does not educate itself correctly about AIDS, the hucksters will continue to prey on people's fear of getting the disease and the desperation of those who have AIDS.</p>

<h3><a name="housing">Housing</a>: Emergency Placement in Commercial SROs<br>
<font size=-2><i>by K. Lowry</i></font></h3>
 
<p>I have a little room in that hell-hole they call the Elton, says Francisco.  I think they want me to go away or just die. My DAS worker told me that his supervisor said I would never get another apartment. Yea . ..  I messed up, big time I had a chance for three . . .  But I was doin’ drugs big time. At first I loved being in these hotels. I was in another one uptown - I never had to go out, only for food and I didn’t eat much. I could just knock on the pipes and someone would bring the drugs right up to me. I was gettin’ high every day, missin’ my appointments and gettin’ sicker every day. I lost so much weight my clothes didn’t fit me any more. All I knew was I had a place, a good supply of drugs and no one hassling me. DAS found me apartment after apartment, but I wasn’t ready. I was messed up. I can’t really tell you much more about that other place, cause I didn’t really see it -I was living in a black out. But now..... I’m clean .. I’m clean. . . I was on methadone for 11 years -and now I took myself off that. I’m real proud of that. But it seems like they don’t want to help me at all. They just want to punish me for all the bad I did. I ‘m clean and have been for a year. If I stay there I don’t know what I’ll do. Now I can’t ever get an apartment, and I have to live with active drug addicts and other people who don’t care. I had to clean up in this dirty little place. No kitchen, a disgusting  bathroom that you have to wait hours to get in, climb over shooters and . . . You’d think it would count for something -I  cleaned up in a place like this. I guess I don’t count,  I . . .I . . . CANT. . . </p>

<p>Emergency placement in commercial SROs has been a source of constant trouble and pain for homeless PWAs, AIDS advocates and the Division of AIDS Services (DAS) (see <a href="#oped">OP ED</a>). PWAs who face homelessness or enter the system from the streets or shelters are initially pleased to have a room as an alternative. Most homeless PWAs think this only a temporary placement and because its a quick placement, and the first contact with DAS, believe in the promise of the City’s commitment. It’s very likely the would be reponsive to the supports and benefits of timely intervention and conseling. This opportunity is missed generating a climate of dissapointment and mistrust.. This is one the most stressful time in some PWAs lives.</p>

<p>Rahim explained,  When I first came to DAS I was numb. I came right from the hospital. I’d just been told I had AIDS. I was confused, I had no where to go. And so I was happy to get that room. I thought I would probably die there. . . I could have cared less. It took me about a month and a half to even notice where I was, let alone come to understand what I might be facing.- I mean with AIDS. I’m ashamed I wasn’t stronger. The room wasn’t that bad, but the people who lived there . . . It wasn’t a good place and I had to do  a lot of talking to get into an apartment. It took about  a year or so to get out of there. </p>

<p>Some  PWAs revel in the craziness of the counter culture, and some are immediately disturbed with these hotels. They are stressful places to live at best. Nevertheless, one thing is obvious, when people are able to see a little clearer, in spite of the pain they feel, they want to get out and take better care of themselves. Francisco is proof that without help and support, this change in behavior is not likely to happen in three months, for some, maybe never.</p>

<p>To PWAs in SROs:  however bad it is . . . it gets better if you take care of yourself . . . it really does. . .  be strong. . . and let case workers, and advocates argue for you. Good people are trying to help on all fronts.</p>

<h3><a name="case">Managing</a> your case manager</h3>

<p>It’s no secret that many of the clients of the Divison of AIDS Services (DAS) are not entirely satisfied with the agency. A major gripe is inaccessible case managers. Workers are mandated to be at DAS Centers three days each week.They are suppose to be in the field visiting clients at home or in the hospital on the remaining two days. Many Das clients state that they can not easily reach their workers by phone. Consumer News suggests the following steps when you are unable to contact your worker:</p>

<ul>
<li>If someone other than your worker answers, leave a message or ask to be transferred to the units Supervisor 1.

<li>Personally visit the DAS Center if you are able. You may be told that you need an appointment, even if your worker is there. If the worker is not there ask for the unit supervisor. Explain that you have been unable to reach your worker. In all interactions  persist politely, it’s your right.

<li>You may ask to speak with the site Director who is responsible for all personnel connected to your case at that center. The names and telephone numbers of all site staff are available to you through the DAS Service Line at (212) 645-7070. Many clients report that the staff on that line (who also interview you at the intial intake) are the most personable and helpful people they have come in contact with at DAS.

<p><b>Tuberculosis</b><br>
A person can be infected with the bacteria that causes tuberculosis and not have tuberculosis disease. Many people are infected with the bacteria that causes tuberculosis, but only a few people (about 10 percent) go on to develop the disease. People who have the disease are said to have "active" tuberculosis.</p> 

<p>Healthy people who get infected with the tuberculosis bacteria are able to fight off the infection and do not get tuberculosis disease. The bacteria is dormant (inactive) in their lungs. If the body is not able to fight off the infection and the bacteria continues to grow, active tuberculosis develops.</p>

<p>You might not know that you have active tuberculosis. Tuberculosis bacteria can grow in your body without making you feel sick. Most people with active tuberculosis don't feel well. People with tuberculosis often feel tired and have a cough that won't go away. They may also lose weight, or have a fever, or break out in a sweat in bed (called "night sweats"). They may have trouble breathing. </p>

<P>If you have active tuberculosis, you will have to get regular checkups and chest x rays for the rest of your life to make sure you stay free of disease, even after you have taken tuberculosis medicine.</p> 

<p>Every month you will need to visit your doctor to get another prescription of the medicine you are taking and to be sure you don't have any side effects or complications from the medicine. If you are feeling well, your doctor will give you a prescription for the next month. It is important that you stop drinking alcohol while taking isoniazid (INH). Alcohol increases the risk of liver damage if you drink while taking the medicine. </p>

<p>Even after you take the medicine every day for six months there is a small chance that you could develop active tuberculosis disease, because some organisms are resistant to the medicine. Staying healthy depends on having sensible living habits. You need adequate sleep and exercise and a nutritious diet to keep up your good health and resistance to the tuberculosis bacteria. </p>

<p>This information provides a general overview on tuberculosis and may not apply to everyone. Talk to your family doctor to find out if this information applies to you and to get more information on this subject.(CDC/NIH 1996)</p>

<p><b>Directly Observed Therapy</b><br>
Tuberculosis can be cured. It has become a disease with significance for PWA’s. Treatment can last from six to eighteen months or longer. The length is dependent on whether the tuberculosis bacilli (bacteria) is resistant to one of the six drugs proven to treat TB successfully.</p>

<p>Therapy is not easy. In the past many of those infected found it difficult to comply with the regimen. Imagine having to swallow lots of ill-tasting pills daily at home - alone -with no encouragement, no support. Data has shown that some people could not complete their treatment.</p>

<p>Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) was introduced to help TB patients take their medications and fight the disease. The patient agrees to take medications in the presence of a nurse, an outreach worker or a public health employee. Persons in methadone programs often take their meds when picking up their methadone. DOT sites give the patient with subway tokens, meal vouchers, or other incentives to encourage compliance. </p>

<p>Anna, a PWA, is undergoing treatment for Multidrug resistant - TB. The first line of medications were no longer effective in treating her TB. She said,  I’m glad I have to come for my medicines, (she is part of a DOT program on the Lower East Side),   It helps me to do this. I know I would sometimes forget to drink them at home. I don’t want to be sick with TB again. So I must drink my medicine.</p> 

<p>The AIDS Institute, a separate Section of the New York State Department of Health charged with overseeing HIV/AIDS Care, has provided funding to Community Based Organizations (CBO) to supply ongoing case management and scatter site housing to homeless or  inadequately housed persons with AIDS in DOT programs. Many such programs already exist in NYC. If you are in need of such services ask your health care provider to help you access them or call Olga Weiss of NYC Department of Health at  (212) 553-4278.</p>

<p>Ricardo came every day -five days a week- from Brooklyn to a DOT center in Lower Manhattan for two years. He never missed a day.  For a while I had to stop myself going to the subway station. It became an automatic routine. But it was worth it because I’m cured.</p>

<p>While it is true, TB can be cured, It’s misleading to suggest that HIV/AIDS infected persons cans live TB free once infected. It is more accurate to say that TB can be controlled in Persons with compromised immune systems,  said Sharon Gabriel  of the New York State Department of Health Office of TB Control. Ms. Gabriel continued  Exposure, constant and close to an infected person, four hours or more would present a risk of TB infection to PWAs. For this reason no special ventilation precautions are necessary in subway cars and buses because the risk of infection is minimal. </P>

<p>Over the past ten years, New York City has developed the most comprehensive programs for AIDS housing in the country.  These options enable a person with AIDS to live in a home environment.  However, even with these opportunities, the supply of AIDS housing does not come close to meeting the need.  One hundred and fifty homeless people living with AIDS seek housing from the Division of AIDS Services (DAS) a week.</p>

<p>A shortage of permanent housing has forced the City to seek emergency housing alternatives.  In the late eighties, the City was blocked from placing homeless people with AIDS in shelters by a legal order that stated that the deplorable living conditions posed a significant health threat.  As a result, the City began contracting with commercial Single Room Occupancy (SRO) hotel owners to provide rooms on an emergency basis to homeless people with AIDS.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the conditions of these hotels are often no better than shelters, and there is frequently less security and staffing.  There is a great deal of drug use and dealing in the hotels and, consequently, the buildings are extremely unsafe.  Additionally, there is a limited number of bathrooms available and heating and plumbing often are not functional.</p>

<p>Despite these factors, the City has paid the hotel owners top dollar for these units, often over $1000 a month.  Although these units are intended to be short term placements, the lack of permanent housing has forced DAS clients to remain in these hotels for months and even years at a time.</p>

<p>The City has been criticized for using commercial SRO hotel placements from the time they first began the practice under the Koch administration.  AIDS advocates challenged the length of stay given the extremely unhealthy conditions.  The surrounding communities have complained about the drug trafficking, loitering, and crime.  And low income neighbors claimed that hotel owners were stock-piling their units for the high DAS rate, causing a decrease in the availability of affordable housing. In July 1995, the Giuliani administration announced that they would be reducing the rate paid to hotel owners for DAS placements to $600 a month.  However, the hotel owners have been successful in delaying this rate reduction.  Because the City has no other alternatives to house the increasing number of homeless people with AIDS, the owners continue to demand high rates.
The City will be forced to pay top dollar for commercial hotel rooms until sufficient permanent housing exists to meet the growing number of homeless people with AIDS.  Several not-for-profit agencies have converted commercial SRO hotels into supportive housing for people living with AIDS.  Within a permanent, supportive environment, people with AIDS are able to receive the social and medical services which enables them to live independently longer.  Pride and appreciation of this environment leads to a decline in drug use and crime and fosters a contribution to the community.  As a result, the quality of life of both the residents and the surrounding community is improved.</p>

<P>The City should work with these agencies to develop more supportive housing.  This will diminish the dependency on commercial SROs for emergency placement, which will help to lower their rates, and create additional savings to be applied to developing the much needed permanent, affordable AIDS housing.</p>

THE AIDS CRISIS . . . There was  a reason they so named the onslaught of the epidemic. Now, more than ever the label fits what we are all dealing with . . . funding cuts, health system deterioration, bias against the poor, and minority populations devastated by the disease.</p>

<p>Even with progress on the treatment and prevention fronts, ANXIETY seems to rule the day. More than ever there is a need to keep the hysteria at bay, focus on our daily lives and take solace from what we have individually and thus collectively accomplished.</p>

<p>We must continue to press on all fronts for a cure, for better treatment, and an end to discrimination. We  must not lose site of the one thing that allows us to fight another day our personal health regimen and our collective spirit of community. More than ever dire predictions insensitive politicians and institutions bombard us with the  challenge of AIDS in our time. Each of us on some personal level needs to pause and remember the heroes in this struggle who have gone before us and led the way. The individuals that we carry in our hearts and souls and in whose name we continue the struggle. We need also to acknowledge each other and celebrate our diversity of opinion race and class in this fight to end AIDS. We also need to renew our ability to develop allies and  build the broadest base of support  -listening to concerns beyond the immediacy of AIDS.</p>

<p>Most important we must learn to be gentle with ourselves to nurture ourselves and celebrate each day  the gift that day bestows on us. We need to remind ourselves that we have made much progress and that we have weathered extremely difficult and challenging times with courage and fortitude.</p>

<p>Arguing whether any light at the end of this tunnel is pointless what is apparent is the light within each of us who perseveres. . . .  Just a reminder; cherish and nurture that light within yourself.</p>

<p><b>Neither Snow, Nor Sleet?</b><br>
Immediately following the Great Blizzard of 96, several  PWA’s living in Scatter Site Housing approached Consumer News. They complained that they had been unable to contact their caseworkers between January 8 and 10. Consumer News contacted six programs and some of their clients in four boroughs: Bailey-Holt House -formerly ARC- (Manhattan and Brooklyn) Jewish Board (Queens and Brooklyn), Food First (Brooklyn), Steinway (Queens), Federation of Puerto Rican Communities (Bronx) and Housing Works (Manhattan and Brooklyn). Clients from two CBOs had indeed been contacted to see if they had food and heat. Four had not. </p>

<p>It is understandable that the severe weather conditions made it impossible for case managers to reach their offices, but difficult to empathize with case workers whose concern for their charges does not include a simple phone call.
Many PWA’s choose scatter site programs over independent living precisely because they require the monitoring and support these programs promise in their mission. Consumer News is confident that ASOs and case workers will take special care in the future to look after the needs of  their clients in times of turmoil or trouble.</p>

<h3><a name="housing">Housing</a></h3>

<p>The Mayor’s Plan maintains the City’s commitment to direct housing
accommodation and supportive services to homeless persons with HIV/AIDS.</p>

<p>The City of New York has developed a long term AIDS supportive Housing Plan
for fiscal years 1995 through 2002.</p>

<p>Mayor Rudolph Guiliani’s Office of AIDS Policy announced that the Plan will
develop two new housing models, and maintains development for all current models.
The city seeks to get the best for tax dollars by working closely with nonprofit
organizations. The restructured Department of AIDS Services (DAS), provides for
greater emphasis on intake and assessment to better determine which housing model
is appropriate. During the intake clients will be informed of the different
housing models. When  the assessment is completed, they will offer clients up to
three supportive housing placements. If the client chooses to stay in the SRO he
or she will be assisted in this regard.</p>

<p><b>Client Surveys</b><br> DAS intends to identify the supportive housing types
 most requested by its  clients. An independent researcher will do two client
surveys. The first will focus on clients receiving services under the current
model and the second on clients receiving services under the restructured
DAS.</p>

<hr size=2 align=center width=50%>

<h3><a name="models">Housing</a> Models as Defined in the Plan</h3>

<p><b>Emergency Placement in Commercial SROs</b><br> Homeless clients will be
housed in a commercial SRO. Thirty of the thirty-nine hotels provide one or more
of these services: group work, counseling, skill building and housing readiness
training by DAS staff.</p>

<p><b>Rental Assistance</b><br> DAS helps clients who are unable to afford their
current rent with a rent subsidy of up to $480.00. This is an independent living
program with no services by DAS.</p>

<p><b>Transitional Supportive Housing</b><br> Transitional supported homes
provide on-site case management, group work, mental health and substance abuse
counseling. They focus assistance on preparing the client to maintain a permanent
household. Each team contains a Housing Specialist who helps the resident to
obtain permanent housing. The placement lasts between three and nine months.</p>

<p><b>Permanent Public Housing</b><br> DAS clients and their families who are
homeless and able to live independently are housed in Public Housing. No services
accompany  this model.</p>

<p><b>Scatter Site Supportive Housing</b><br> Not-for-Profit organizations are
contracted to find, lease, and maintain apartments in the private sector and
permanently place clients within them. Services provided are intensive case
management and referral linkages to medical and other services. Additional
services include mental health and substance abuse counseling, recreation, and
advocacy.</p>

<p><b>Supported Single Room Occupancies (SRO)</b><br> On-site support services
are provided in this setting.  SRO’s can be a mixed facility that houses
different populations.</p>

<p><b>Permanent Supported Housing</b><br> The City contracts with not-for-profits
to provide enriched on-site services and community linkages. Services include
case management, substance abuse counseling and a daily meal plan. Private
resources provide additional supports such as pastoral and bereavement
counseling. (See Permanent Supported Housing A Community Home)</p>

<p><b>Housing Placement Assistance</b><br> Funding is available to
community-based organizations, through Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS
(HOPWA) and Ryan White monies, to provide assistance to HIV-infected individuals
who are not eligible for assistance through HRA/DAS.</p>

<hr size=2 align=center width=50%>

<h3><a name="two">Two</a> New Housing Models Announced</h3>

<p><b>Housing Placement assistance</b><br> The plan is to develop a model that
addresses the needs of persons who are not in need of intensive case management
and services.</p>

<p><b>Supportive SRO/ Lease Purchase Program</b><br> Nonprofit organizations
secure one or more five-year leases and provide building management and on-site
supportive services, either themselves or through a subcontracted social service
provider.</p>

<p>This newsletter will profile a different Housing Provider in each issue.</p>

<hr size=2 align=center width=50%>

<h3><a name="permanent">Permanent</a> Supported Housing</h3>

<p><b>A Community Home</b><br> The Supported Congregate Housing model for PWAs is
permanent housing for those of us who find it difficult to negotiate the demands
of independent living. Six permanent supported congregate houses for PWAs are
found in New York City.</P>

<p>In 1996, an additional ten permanent supported residences will open.</p>

<hr size=2 align=center width=50%>

<h3><a name="bailey">Bailey</a>-Holt House</h3>

<p>I used to pray every night that I would make it to Bailey-Holt House. You see.
 I wasn’t able to take care of myself, physically or financially,  said Reginald
Ganter. When my friend died, I thought I could make it on my own, but I was
lonely and I made bad choices  . . .  I love it here. I have a great social
worker at St. Vincent’s Hospital, right around the corner. I have all I need,
recreational activities, help with laundry, housekeeping, food. If I need someone
to help me to my clinic appointments, they will arrange for a car, and someone
will come with me.  Reggie is a 31-year-old man living with AIDS in the City’s
oldest Permanent Supportive Residence for PWAs.</p>

<p>I walked into the lobby of Bailey-Holt House where safety and permanence
abound for forty-four People Living With AIDS. Support services provided by staff
include case management, health assessment and monitoring, personal care
assessment/assistance and monitoring, psychological counseling, substance abuse
management, pastoral care and bereavement counseling, </p>

<p>If I could have anything, well, um, it would be a friend, a lover,  said a
somber Erica.  I have everything else, a home, food, my doctor is nearby.  Like
the other residents, Erica has a private room, a bath, a small refrigerator,
telephone, and television. She said,  I can  rebuild my life here. Maybe I can
get a part-time job or take some classes.  How would she change things? She would
have a kitchen to cook, but is happy with the three daily meals served in the
dining room.</p>

<p>Program Director Francine Durant-Wernham, CSW explained,  Bailey-Holt House is
not a medical care facility, nursing home, or hospice. It’s a supportive home for
people with AIDS. We have a very mixed community here, men and women between 18
and 60 years of age, of various ethnicities and sexual orientations. We have
people from all walks of life, people who used to live next door to you, artists,
musicians, health care workers. We provide homes for former substance abusers,
persons with developmental, physical, visual, medical and emotional difficulties.
Clearly, we are challenged by residents who have a broad range of obstacles to
independent living.</p>

<p>The residents with whom I spoke, had nothing but praise for their new found
home and family. They are men and women whose significant challenges are exceeded
by their courage and the will to live in concert with others.</p>

<p>The staff is caring and nurturing, building bridges between the residents and
estranged families and the supportive services they require. Referrals come
through the Department of AIDS Services, but may be  initiated by a social worker
or other professional. Bailey-Holt House offers a safe permanent home for PWAs to
live out their lives with dignity and respect.</p>

<hr size=2 align=center width=50%>

<h3><a name="managed">Managed</a> Cares?</h3>

<p>Americans are experiencing major changes in the way medical services are
delivered. Many corporations, privately insured individuals, and increasing
numbers of persons insured by Medicare and Medicaid, receive their medical care
through managed care organizations. "Managed care" is an umbrella for a broad
range of organizational arrangements intended to reduce cost and eliminate
unnecessary and inappropriate care or services. They require the recipient to
enroll in the managed care organization. They  will  contract with the payer
(insurer) for a flat fee to take care of all of the enrollees health needs. Most
have prior arrangements or gate keepers, an intermediary function, sometimes an
enrollees’ primary care giver (a regular doctor in charge of your case), but
often a separate administering arm of the managed care organization. (Kaiser
Permanente, 1995)</p>

<p>Managed care organizations can be Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO),
group practices, or  individual practices associated with  managed care
organizations. Each of these types have  unique advantages. All make arrangements
with specialists, laboratories and various other service providers, a cartel-like
arrangement.   Essentially we are looking at the industrialization of the health
care system  says Allan R. Wentt, M.D. </p>

<p>The challenge is how to adapt this to human need. Standardization of
treatments and pharmaceuticals pose many questions with which  policy makers 
struggle. To this challenge the government has set aside funds to study the
effectiveness this change in health care delivery will have on populations with
special needs. A handful of private sector organizations, foundations and
not-for-profits are first in the fight for people with AIDS in this regard.</p>

<p>Dr. Wentt, a partner in  a group practice from New Jersey, continued: 
Medicaid and Medicare insured patients will receive better care, and it will be
neighborhood-based. Currently, physicians-in-training treat these patients at
costly hospital clinics and emergency rooms. Managed care will bring lower cost
and trained physicians. The competition for patients in managed care can only
serve to drive the quality of care up.</p>

<p>Managed care plans emphasize prevention and primary care and can be held
accountable for quality outcomes, efficiency and appropriate care. Inappropriate
stays in hospitals are unlikely, giving way to outpatient and home care. In her
keynote address to the Business Group on Health, in November 1995 Karen Davis
said,  But the shift to managed care also may result in underutilization of
services and unacceptable limits on access to specialized care for seriously ill
patients.  Susan Dooha Policy Associate at GMHC said,  Most managed care plans
are not experienced in providing services to Medicaid beneficiaries with
HIV/AIDS.  Managed care is a business arrangement, organized to make money, a
difficult objective to accomplish with persons with significant disabilities or
chronic illnesses. However, we live among creative and aggressive advocates who
are pursuing ways to secure the integrity and quality of care for people with HIV
disease and AIDS.</p>

<P>Privatization of the health care system for Medicare and Medicaid insured
patients will lead to substantial savings of government capital. The ultimate
success of managed care depends on whether it truly meets the needs of PWAs, the
seriously disabled and others with chronic diseases.</p>

<h3><a name="conflict">Conflict</a> Resolution</h3>

<p>Alternative Dispute Resolution offers creative ways to solve problems between
people who live and work together. The use of mediators and facilitators are
integral to this process. AIDS service providers take a positive step in building
a collective identity to benefit consumers.</p>

<p>Saturday, November 18, 1995. A number of AIDS Service Organization (ASO)
executives met to discuss new ways to work together, solve conflicts and build
consensuses. Allen Zerkin J.D.,  Wagner School professor at New York University
and chair of the New York State Forum on Consensus and Conflict Resolution,
facilitated the meeting.</p>

<p>The group decided to reach out to all ASOs and explore the possibility of
regular meetings at the University to affect positive policy outcomes and
minimize conflicts.</p>

<p><font size=-1><i>by Maria Baldo, M.S. R.D. Maria Baldo is a Child Life
Nutritionist with GMHC.</i></font></p>

<P>An intimate candlelight dinner, is a wonderful way to celebrate a birthday,
anniversary, or other special time. If you’re having trouble making ends meet,
however, it’s hard to justify spending a lot on one evening. Well a new
restaurant has opened, and it may just be the answer.</p>

<P>One City Cafe is a cozy West Village restaurant reminiscent of a Paris bistro,
but with an important difference when you get the bill. This is New York’s first
not-for-profit restaurant.  It accepts Food Stamps and cash and American Express.
Each entree, including two side dishes costs only $3.50 if you pay with food
stamps, $7.00 otherwise. Tax is charged only to non-food stamp customers, but
they receive a 20 per cent discount with Medicaid or valid student identification
cards. An added bonus for families is that the per-person price goes down if more
than one person at the table orders the same thing. A party of four all ordering
the same entree would pay only $10.00 in food Stamps or $20.00 in cash.</p>

<p>The dinner specials the night I was there included a chicken burrito with rice
and beans, or a grilled eggplant sandwich with smoked mozzarella, tomato, and
pesto, accompanied by black bean, chicken noodle, or vegetable soup. Regular
entrées range from vegetable lasagna to ropa vieja (Latin-American pot roast).
Side dishes include mashed potatoes, fried zucchini, saucy red beans, and
amarillo. Alcoholic beverages are available, ( not purchasable with food stamps)
or you can choose lemonade, fresh juices, batidos (shakes) or any of a variety of
herbal teas. Original paintings by shelter residents surround diners. </p>

<p>We chose a chicken burrito special and an order of mahi-mahi, a swordfish like
Hawaiian delicacy, with sauteed kale and fried sweet potatoes on the side. With
two glasses of wine and a shared flan for dessert, our bill was $11.00 if paying
with food stamps, $24.00 otherwise.</p>

<P>The food was beautifully prepared. The kale was freshly cooked and the sweet
potatoes crisp; the burrito was stuffed with tender boneless chicken breast and
accompanied by homemade guacamole and salsa. The fish looked undercooked at
first, so we asked that it be grilled longer. The server was happy to take it
back to the kitchen, and it was returned juicy and flavorful. A single order of a
flan was plenty for the two of us, and it was creamy and rich, with a caramel
sauce.</p>

<P>My dinner partner and I were both completely satisfied. Our dinner had lasted
two hours, and it was completely comfortable. The food was delicious, the
atmosphere was elegant, and no one rushed us out.</p>

<p>One City Cafe allows diners to enjoy good food in an inviting and intimate
atmosphere without breaking their budget. Particularly for families with food
stamps, it’s cheaper than McDonald’s or Burger King, and far more nutritious
food.</p>

<p>One City Cafe is funded by the Food and Hunger Hotline, with contributions
from private corporations. Besides serving affordable food, the restaurant offers
job training to homeless people and formerly homeless people, followed by
employment at the Cafe or in other restaurants or food service businesses
throughout the City.</p>

<p>The Restaurant is open for lunch Tuesday through Saturday from 12:00 p.m. to
4:00 p.m. they serve Dinner Tuesday through Thursday 5:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.
Friday and Saturday from 5:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. Sunday Brunch is served from
11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.</p>

<p>If you wish to use food stamps in selected New York City restaurants, you will
need a restaurant card which HRA issues. Ask your case manager or personnel at
your AIDS service organization to help you.</p>

<p><b>NUTRI-BITES</b><br> For your safety and health, hot foods should be Served
Hot and cold foods Served Cold, not room temperature.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, December 20, 1995 I ate lunch at the Gay Men’s Health Crisis
(GMHC). The food there, as always, was exemplary. I had, however, one complaint,
the soup was lukewarm. When this reporter alerted Nutritionist Margaret Dziadek,
she called Christine Hannema, Coordinator of Nutrition Services. Ms. Hannema
discarded the soups on the counter and instructed the volunteers to make sure
they serve the soup hot, a la minute. By the time I left, consumers were enjoying
safe, steaming hot soup. We applaud the GMHC Nutrition / Recreation Department
for prompt response to a potential problem for consumers with compromised immune
systems.</p>

<h3><a name="life">Lifestyles</a></h3>

<p>Jud is a 25-year-old young man who has been living with AIDS for ten years. He
is a hemophiliac who was infected by tainted blood. Then, not much was known
about AIDS, nor was much attention was paid to screening blood.</p>

<P>When I was diagnosed, I did not think much of it. I did not think I would die.
 I was 15 and invincible. My family knew of the stigma attached to AIDS and we
never talked about it. It took years for them to talk about it, years for me to
have the support necessary to adjust to a chronic illness. </p>

<p>Jud attended college and now is working with young people and speaks about
AIDS and AIDS Prevention. He is another example of a PWA  who will not sit
quietly, but wishes to arm the young with the weapons to defend against

<h3><a name="edit">Editorial</a></h3>

<p>AIDS advocates do all they can to help PWAs access their benefits. However,
the support PWAs can expect from policy makers is tenuous because a measurable
statement of concern by the voting public is lacking. There is no question that
the public is concerned about AIDS, nor is there any doubt that candidates and
elected officials offer supportive rhetoric. But now is the time to count the
numbers which will convince them to be aggressive advocates of progressive AIDS
policy and research. They need to identify with our interests, and not be
momentarily concerned opportunists whose support will dwindle after the
election.</p>

<p>The right to vote is the most important entitlement we can help PWAs access.
By voting, citizens become active participants in the democratic process, not
merely chance recipients of marginal  benefits. It therefore behooves us to
encourage PWAs to register nationwide, illustrate solidarity, and confront a
disease that threatens our lives.</p>

<p>We must find time to ask PWAs, their friends and families, all who have been
touched by HIV disease and AIDS to Register and Vote. For PWAs voter registration
can be  a reaffirmation of self. Moreover, the numbers of registrants connected
with this kind of mobilization can leave a legacy which will have implications
reaching far into the  next century.  A mass voter registration mobilization is
an empowerment concept that can counteract an unresponsive political system.</p>

<p>People vote when they think it matters. It matters . . . Now.  We can mandate
a compelling claim for research and services. When the AIDS community's interests
challenge the majority's, we are likely to be brushed aside. Electing
representatives who resemble their constituents, such as Manhattan City Council
Member Tom Duane, who is himself HIV positive, is most advantageous. Lacking 
this scenario, we should identify and  elect representatives whose vision
includes an aggressive AIDS policy.</p>

<h3><a name="letters">Letters</a> to the Editor</h3>

<p><b>The Individual Living Plan (ILP)</b><br> Special Educators have for years
analyzed information about children, using learning diagnostics, psychological
exams, and social inquiries. We have devised remedial responses, and compiled
them into what we call an Individual Educational Plan (IEP). We have had much
success in improving specific deficits and mainstreaming special needs students
into general school populations.</p>

<p>If  DAS survives the restructuring, its emphasis on assessment will provide
the bases for an Individual Living Plan (ILP) to identify and match specific
objectives for its clients. The plan would benefit from a cooperative effort by
professionals from outside the agency, i.e.,  clients, social workers, medical
care givers  and clergymen. </p>

<p>Instruction, by letter, survey, or interview, from professionals regarding:
environmental variables, biological characteristics, and behavioral 
considerations would provide for a comprehensive plan and shared responsibility.
Since such variables as substance abuse, medical, physical, social, and emotional
challenges, can impede or delay the acquisition of successful living skills, DAS
would do well to address them early, in a written plan. This approach;
comprehensive diagnosis by qualified professionals, client input, and annual
review  redesigned on empirical findings, is likely to prevent or delay the
untimely progression of the disease, and reduce or eliminate the need for
intensive case management. Ultimately it will save money and lives.</p>

<p><b>To Our Client:</b></p>

<p>You have requested meal deliveries from God’s Love We Deliver. Our mission provides the delivery of hot and nutritious meals to people who have a full-blown AIDS diagnosis and are homebound because of the opportunistic infections associated with AIDS. For most people on our program, homebound status fluctuates. When you are not homebound, you are expected to call us to stop meal deliveries so that our meals can go to someone else who is homebound. Should you become homebound again, we will resume meal delivery within 24 hours.</p>

<p><b>To the Medical Practitioner:</b></p>

<p>As the medical practitioner of the above-named client, please send us a short confirmation letter - on your letterhead - stating that our mutual client has an AIDS diagnosis and is presently homebound due to the opportunistic infections associated with AIDS. We would appreciate your response within two weeks from the above date so that we can be sure that our meals are going to those eligible for our program.</p>

<p>Your confirmation letter may be faxed to the Client Services Department at: 212-294-8101 or mailed to God’s Love We Deliver, 166 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY, 10013.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please call the Client Services Department at: 212-294-8102.</p>

Sharon Stowers, MA, RD of Nutrition Education Services International for use of the food guide model and to the New York City community-based organizations that participated in the God's Love We Deliver (GLWD) nutrition needs assessment from which this booklet was conceived.  GLWD gratefully acknowledges their contribution in this unique effort to help people living with HIV or AIDS maintain their nutritional health throughout the continuum of HIV disease.<p>
<p>Funding for this booklet was provided by the AIDS Institute of the New York State Department of Health, Title I of the Ryan White Emergency CARE Act and Philip Morris Companies.<p>
<p><b>Copyright (c) 1994 by God's Love We Deliver.  All rights reserved.  God's Love We Deliver 895 Amsterdam Avenue, New York, NY  10025, USA.</b></p></center>
<p>God's Love We Deliver (GLWD) is a New York City based, not-for-profit, nonsectarian organization which fights malnutrition and hunger among people living with AIDS.  GLWD prepares and delivers life-sustaining hot meals to homebound people living with AIDS in all five boroughs of New York City and in Hudson County, New Jersey.  GLWD also provides essential nutrition education and counseling to symptomatic and asymptomatic people living with HIV or AIDS (PLWAs).</p>
<p>In March 1992, GLWD received Ryan White Title I funding and a grant from Philip Morris Companies to provide nutrition education and counseling to PLWAs, their carepartners and healthcare professionals in New York City.  Our agency conducted a comprehensive, citywide nutrition needs assessment to help us determine the unmet nutrition needs of PLWAs.  From this assessment, we learned that culturally competent nutrition education was often overlooked.  We discovered that the existing nutrition information was not sensitive to the food preferences and cultural differences of ethnically diverse populations.</p>
<p>This booklet is one of a series of materials designed to meet the expressed needs among PLWAs.  The nutrition information is intended to provide PLWAs and their carepartners with skills to integrate preventive and therapeutic nutrition into their healthcare plans throughout the continuum of HIV disease.</p>

<p>For more nutrition and HIV information or for personalized nutrition counseling, call GLWD at 212-865-6500.  If you are homebound with AIDS and need a hot meal delivered to you at home in the New York City area or in Hudson County, New Jersey, call us.  We also can tell you about other home-delivered meal programs around the country serving people with HIV or AIDS, and we can refer you to HIV support groups and programs in the New York City area.</p>

<p><font size=-1><b>Consejos de Alimentaci&oacute;n para el VIH</b><br>

God's Love We Deliver (GLWD) es una organizaci&oacute;n en Nueva York con fines no lucrativos y no sectarios, que lucha contra la malnutrici&oacute;n y el hambre de las personas que viven con VIH/SIDA.  GLWD prepara y entrega comidas calientes nutritivas a personas que est&aacute;n confinadas a sus hogares a consequencia del SIDA, en los cinco condados de la ciudad de Nueva York y en el condado Hudson en Nueva Jersey.  GLWD tambi&eacute;n provee educaci&oacute;n b&aacute;sica en nutrici&oacute;n y consejer&iacute;a a personas VIH positivas sintom&aacute;ticas o asintom&aacute;ticas y a personas que est&aacute;n viviendo con SIDA.</p>
<p>En marzo de 1992, GLWD recibi&oacute; fondos del T&iacute;tulo I de Ryan White y una subvenci&oacute;n de las compa&ntilde;&iacute;as Phillip Morris para proveer educaci&oacute;n en nutrici&oacute;n y consejer&iacute;a a las personas que est&aacute;n viviendo con SIDA, a su personal de cuidado y a los profesionales de la salud de la ciudad de Nueva York.  Nuestra agencia condujo una evaluaci&oacute;n de necesidades a trav&eacute;s de la ciudad para determinar las necesidades nutricionales a&uacute;n no provistas de las personas que est&aacute;n viviendo con SIDA.  De esta evaluaci&oacute;n aprendimos que la educaci&oacute;n en nutrici&oacute;n culturalmente apropiada usualmente es pasada por alto.  Descubrimos que la informaci&oacute;n en nutrici&oacute;n existente usualmente no es sensible a las preferencias alimentarias y diferencias culturales de diversos grupos &eacute;tnicos en la comunidad.</P>
<p>Este folleto es uno en una serie de materiales dise&ntilde;ados para proveer las necesidades expresadas entre las personas que est&aacute;n viviendo con SIDA.  El mismo intenta proveer a estas personas, a sus familiares y a su personal de cuidado destrezas para integrar la nutrici&oacute;n preventiva y terape&uacute;tica en sus planes de cuidado de la salud a trav&eacute;s del continuo de la enfermedad VIH.</p>
<p>Para m&aacute;s informaci&oacute;n sobre nutrici&oacute;n y VIH, o para consejer&iacute;a nutricional personalizada, puede llamar a GLWD al 212-865-6500.  Si usted est&aacute; confinado a su hogar con SIDA y necesita una comida caliente entregada en su casa en la ciudad de Nueva York o en el condado de Hudson en Nueva Jersey, ll&aacute;menos.  Tambi&eacute;n le podemos informar de otros programas en la naci&oacute;n que ofrecen un servicio similar al nuestro y referirle a grupos y programas de apoyo para personas VIH positivas en la ciudad de Nueva York.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b><a href="#fact">Who, what, when, where</a> | <a href="#how">How to register</a></b></p>

<p>Over 4000 runners and walkers including some of the top names in the Fragrance, Fashion, Publishing, Photography, Manufacturing, Interior Design and Modeling industries will lace up their shoes on Sunday, September 29, and head for New York's Central Park to be a part of the second annual <a href="race.html">RACE TO DELIVER</a>, a four mile fun run/walk to benefit homebound people with AIDS.</p>

<p>For the third year, Polo Sport, the Fitness Fragrance by Ralph Lauren, and Men's Health magazine are sponsoring the <font color="ff0000"<b>RACE TO DELIVER</b></font>. The mission is simple -- to help <a href="../../index.html">God's Love We Deliver</a> (GLWD) continue to feed every homebound person with AIDS within its reach.  In 1995, the <font color="ff0000"<b>RACE TO DELIVER</b></font>'s 2000 participants raised more than $200,000 for GLWD. This year, the goal is to triple that amount -- which will provide food for more than 150,000 meals. It is the dedicated generosity of donors and volunteers which enables the organization to keep its founding pledge.</p>

<p>The '96 <font color="ff0000"<b>RACE TO DELIVER</b></font> will draw on the spirit and energy of children,  who will participate in a special <font color="ff0000"<b>PEEWEE RACE TO DELIVER</b></font>. Children from ages 2-6  will dash on a special course and all peewees who participate will receive a special t-shirt and  prize ribbon for their $4.00 entry fee.</p>

<p>The <font color="ff0000"<b>RACE TO DELIVER</b></font> will feature special <font color="ff0000"<b>RACE</b></font> day events and programs including celebrity appearances and pre-race warm-ups with some of the top experts in fitness  and exercise from New York's hottest health clubs. Prizes will be awarded to the top three  men and women finishers, the largest team and the most creative team.</p>

<p>Registration information is available from the New York Road Runner's Club,  organizer of the 4 mile run/walk. <font color="#ff0000"><b>RACE</b></font> packets, including specially designed t-shirts, Polo  Sport products and a copy of Men's Health magazine, among other gratis (the first 200 to  register will receive Polo Sport sox in their bag ) will be available at their Club headquarters  at 9 East 89th Street.</p>

<H1>Introduction</H1>

<P>
HEAL was founded in 1982 and our sole purpose at that time was
to provide information and support for alternative and holistic
approaches to &quot;AIDS&quot; and related conditions.
<P>
As a result of our fourteen years of direct experience however,
we have also come to discover that so far as &quot;AIDS&quot;
goes, we have been subject to the most heinous and genocidal fraud
in medical history. And that to escape it, one must view not only
&quot;AIDS&quot;, but all health and healthcare within an entirely
different, life-affirming and self-empowering perspective. Making
this life-saving information available has since become our primary
goal, and the info pack before you is one result of our efforts.
<P>
&quot;AIDS&quot; is not a death sentence. We know of increasing
numbers of people who are alive and well 10, 12 and 14 years after
their initial &quot;AIDS&quot; diagnosis. Since &quot;AIDS&quot;
has only been around this long, it is clearly not &quot;always
fatal&quot;. Further, due to the 1993 definition, a distinction
must be made between the 50% of &quot;AIDS&quot; cases where people
are actually sick, and the 50% who are not. (Just being HIV+ and
having low T-cells is not necessarily a sign of illness, let alone
serious illness, although many of these people are eventually
made sick by the toxic treatments they are given unnecessarily.)
Imagine the greater number of recov-eries if, instead of being
scared to death, people were encouraged to both expect their natural
birth right - health - and to utilize safe, effective, holistic
treatments as a means to it.
<P>
Testing positive to &quot;HIV&quot; antibodies is even more misleading
because all positive tests are likely to be false positives. The
June '93 issue of the prestigious journal Bio/Technology published
a review declaring the test to be scientifically invalid. Additionally,
seropositive people do not necessarily develop &quot;AIDS&quot;
and seronegative people may nonetheless develop &quot;AIDS&quot;.
<P>
&quot;AIDS&quot; is a multifactorial problem; it is defined by
the Centers for Disease Control as 28 old diseases in the presence
of &quot;antibodies to HIV&quot;. The truth is that histories
of medical and &quot;recreational&quot; drug abuse, chronic infections,
chronically poor nutrition, environmental poisoning and intense,
chronic stress are each sufficient in and of themselves to cause
&quot;immune deficiencies&quot; and serious, life-threatening
conditions. These &quot;risk factors&quot; are the real factors
to address and, when honestly assessed and addressed, can lead
to recoveries.
<P>
At worst, an HIV positive test result is a wake-up call, not a
death sentence. If there actually is a true &quot;positive&quot;
test result, it may indicate a high degree of &quot;antigenic
stress&quot;, i.e., an individual may have a considerable amount
of foreign proteins and substances in their system. HEAL's Alternative
&quot;AIDS&quot; Test, included in this information packet, can
be used to assess whether or not an individual actually falls
into this category.
<P>
If you do fall into this category, the information in this packet
can assist you in taking steps toward creating for yourself some
sort of physical/ emotional/ psychospiritual detoxification which,
in addition to rebuilding your health, can help to considerably
reduce the toxin load, thereby undermining the likelihood of any
future health complications.
<P>
If you are not in this category, the information in this packet
can still assist you in simply maintaining your health, and restoring
it if ever you have any of the more &quot;common&quot; health
challenges to deal with. Keep in mind that most of today's serious
illnesses can be prevented simply by addressing minor illnesses
with non-toxic and natural approaches in the first place. Along
with the modern &quot;plagues&quot; of pollution, love deprivation,
malnutrition and a lack of sanitation, the chronic use of modern
medicine may well be a major chemical cause of many of the degenerative
conditions associated with the 20th century.
<P>
If you already have &quot;AIDS&quot;, that is, if you have the
physical clinical symptoms associated with what they call &quot;AIDS&quot;,
here too there are numerous approaches to detoxification, many
listed and discussed in this pack, that can help you turn your
situation around. It takes time and energy to do it, but many
have come to our meetings with &quot;AIDS&quot; related symptoms
and have completely reversed their condition and regained their
health, evidenced not only by subjective feelings but by clinical
and laboratory results.
<P>
They have done this largely through an alternative and holistic
approach which precludes the use of toxic, immunosuppressive drugs,
but which includes physical, emotional, psychological and spiritual
efforts. The best therapies in the world are meaningless if not
applied within the over-all context of eliminating toxicities
and deficiencies from the way we satisfy our basic human needs
for love, sexual love, nourishing foodstuffs, full-bodied rest,
shelter, and a sense of accomplishment. And fulfillment of these
needs falls right in the realm of our own self-responsibility.
<P>
The &quot;treatment&quot; information which is provided at our
meetings and in our publications is meant to be an overview: to
give you an idea of ways to bolster the &quot;immune system&quot;,
to help inhibit pathogenic activity in the body, and to enhance
your overall health and well-being with methods that are non-toxic
and have few or no side effects. While HEAL does not officially
endorse or promote anything, we feel that if you take your time,
study the available information and listen to your own intuition,
you will be able to make the right choices and pursue the right
course.
<P>
Some of the alternative and holistic approaches we investigate
include acupuncture, Chinese and western herbology, nutritional
therapy and supplementation, chiropractic, hypnotherapy, homeopathy,
Ayurvedic medicine, Natural Hygiene, low-frequency magnetic energy,
macrobiotics, water therapies, meditation and visualization, uropathy,
body work, the typhoid vaccine protocol, AL 721, oxygen therapies,
chelation therapy, &quot;Homeopathic Immuno-Therapy&quot; (HIT),
syphilis link, etc.
<P>
In choosing healthcare practitioners, we urge you to use great
caution. If someone assumes, explicitly or implicitly, that you
have an unsolvable and &quot;always fatal&quot; problem, they
will not help you. Treat all practitioners as your advisors, not
as authorities who will supply you with &quot;the answer&quot;.
Most doctors are much too busy and have much too much invested
in their medical belief systems to be learning about the many
alternative and effective things that people are doing for themselves.
Utilize their expertise, but do not count on them to heal you.
You must learn to count on yourself! Your greatest help will come
from personal responsibility and self-empowerment.
<P>
If you are outside the New York City area, think about starting
a HEAL group to provide support and information. Contact us for
start-up help. Educate yourself, educate yourself, educate yourself.
This, coupled with an approach to life which actively recognizes
that health and healing are an expression of working with nature
rather than against it, will enable you to access the practical
tools, both within you and without you, that are essential to
restoring and/or maintaining a productive and meaningful life,
health and happiness.

<H1>Playing Russian Roulette in the Laboratory: Can You Really
Trust HIV Testing?</H1>

<ADDRESS>
By Christine Johnson
</ADDRESS>

<UL>
<LI>&quot;It was the most terrifying experience of my life. I
just freaked out.&quot;
<LI>&quot;When she found out, she went up to the roof of the hospital
and jumped off.&quot;
<LI>&quot;To me, the emotional impact was immeasurable; the fear
was unmanageable.&quot;
</UL>

<P>
Are these people talking about being diagnosed with AIDS? No,
these are the reactions of healthy people without symptoms whose
HIV test came back positive. The effects of getting a positive
HIV test are so profound that no one should bear that kind of
burden without knowing with absolute certainty that the test is
a true and meaningful measure of the presence of HIV in the body.
This statement introduces and states the purpose of a ground-breaking
paper from Australia, &quot;Is a Positive Western Blot Proof of
HIV Infection?&quot; published in the June issue of the Bio/Technology
journal.
<P>
The authors, Drs. Papadopulos- Eleopulos, Turner, and Papadimitriou,
demonstrate that even though we have been told that we can depend
on the accuracy of these &quot;AIDS tests,&quot; in fact we cannot.
They discuss the tests and how they came to be accepted as virtually
unquestioned proof that a person is infected with HIV. They also
critique these tests on several different grounds: 1) the tests
are not specific, 2) there is no standard way of interpreting
them, and 3) the results are not reproducible. In order for an
antibody test to be scientifically valid, it must meet these three
criteria, and these three in turn must be validated by an independant
means, namely the &quot;gold standard&quot;.
<H2>Specificity and the Gold Standard</H2>

<P>
To begin, what does &quot;specificity&quot; mean? Specificity
is the number of negative test results you will get in people
who have definitely been determined not to have a given disease.
A test that is 100% specific is always negative when the disease
is absent. There are no false positive readings. How do you determine
if the disease (in this case, HIV infection) is there or not?
HIV antibody tests are based on the idea that if the antibody
to a virus is there, then a protein of the virus, and thus the
virus itself, is there. So in order to see if the test is doing
its job, it is necessary to have an independent means of verifying
the presence of the virus in an antibody-positive person and the
absence of the virus in an antibody-negative person. This independent
method is called the &quot;gold standard.&quot;
<P>
The only suitable gold standard is isolation of the virus itself.
Since viruses need the living cells of the host in order to reproduce,
they are grown in tissue cultures. HIV isolation means that the
virus is taken from a tissue culture and separated out from everything
else in the culture so that only pure virus remains.
<P>
Let's say that 100 people have been determined to be HIV-free
according to a virus isolation test. These people are all given
an HIV antibody test and this results in 90 negative results and
10 positive results (false positives). This gives the test a 90%
specificity (which is not very good). If the test were 100% specific,
it would never be positive in anyone (whether that person has
symptoms or not) who is not infected with HIV as determined by
a viral isolation test.
<P>
Although many claims are made that the HIV antibody tests have
a high specificity, Eleopulos and colleagues argue that this is
not the case. A test that is not specific will give a positive
reading in the presence of antibodies other than those it is supposed
to detect. Clearly, if an HIV antibody test is not specific, a
positive result is at best ambiguous.
<H2>Antibodies and Antigens</H2>

<P>
Let's briefly review the definition of antibodies and antigens,
since we'll be talking about them a lot. Antibodies are the body's
foot soldiers in the war against foreign invaders such as bacteria
and viruses. The immune system will make a set of antibodies that
have a unique biochemical attraction to the proteins of an invading
virus. When the antibodies see a virus particle passing by, they
attach to the virus and render it harmless. As the need arises,
the immune system will make many thousands of different kinds
of antibodies, each of which will attack one specific antigen.
<P>
Antigens are substances that are foreign to the body, things that
might make us sick or be fatal to us if our immune system did
not neutralize them with antibodies. Antigens include such things
as viruses, bacteria, toxins, or tissues from other people's bodies
(such as sperm which might find its way into the bloodstream during
anal intercourse). Antibodies fit together with their antigens
like a key in a lock and this interlocking or binding action results
in neutralization of the antigen so that it can no longer harm
us.
<H2>The ELISA and the Western Blot</H2>

<P>
These principles are used in the HIV antibody tests, which basically
work like this: In the ELISA, a mixture of proteins, which are
said to come only from HIV, is exposed to a blood sample and any
antibodies in the blood that can bind to these proteins are allowed
to do so. If all of the proteins in the mixture really do come
from HIV, and if all of the antibodies recognize only HIV proteins,
a positive reading in the test would mean that at some time in
the past the person had been exposed to the virus. But, as Eleopulos
and her colleagues demonstrate in their rigorously argued and
exhaustively referenced article, these two essential conditions
are not met in either of the antibody tests (ELISA or Western
Blot) currently in use!
<P>
So we have two big problems already:
<P>
1. Not all the proteins in the mixture definitely come from HIV;
<P>
2. Not all the &quot;HIV antibodies&quot; definitely recognize
HIV alone.
<P>
In fact, Eleopulos and associates point out that there is no proof
that any of the supposed HIV proteins actually come from HIV.
The reason is that any attempt at virus isolation has presented
numerous insurmountable difficulties (which we will discuss later).
Their position is that HIV has never been isolated and thus one
cannot say for sure that any of the HIV proteins actually come
from HIV. It follows that if you cannot know for sure that the
proteins in the antibody test come from HIV, then you cannot know
for sure whether the antibodies that react with these proteins
are anti-HIV antibodies. There are many documented cases of antibody
cross-reactivity where antibodies to another disease or condition
altogether will cause a false positive test result. The only way
to know for sure is to apply a gold standard.
<P>
In the Western Blot (WB), the presumed HIV proteins are present
separately instead of in a mixture and, after being allowed to
react with a blood sample, each protein is capable of giving a
visible signal if it has bound an antibody. (See Figure 1 for
a picture of what a WB read-out looks like.) Thus, while an ELISA
can only determine that a blood sample contains some antibodies
which appear to have been elicited by HIV, a Western Blot, at
least in theory, can determine which particular protein of the
virus elicited which antibody.
<P>
Because ELISA tests are well-known to be less than perfectly specific,
Western Blots, which are thought to be highly specific, are generally
used to &quot;confirm&quot; them, especially when it is important
to give the appearance that great scientific care and utmost accuracy
have been exercised. In fact, so much weight is placed on these
Western Blots that a positive result is almost always taken to
equal an active HIV infection. So, how accurate are these &quot;definitive&quot;
tests?
<P>
First, figure 2 has a chart showing which proteins must be present
in order for the Western Blot test to be positive, according to
each of five different authorities. You can sort of mix-and-match;
pick at least one from each required category and your test will
be interpreted as positive. More on this later.
<P>
The picture in Figure 2 shows how the Western Blot test is read.
<P>
Each HIV protein/antibody reaction shows up on the strip in its
own special area, called a band. There are several bands which
are supposed to represent specific HIV proteins. The most important
of these are p120/160, p41, p31-32, and p24. In reality, these
bands may not represent HIV proteins at all!
<H2>The Proteins are not Unique to HIV</H2>

<P>
Let's take a look at each of these main HIV proteins and see whether
their presence on a Western Blot strip is actually indicative
of the presence of HIV:
<P>
P41: Even at the beginning, Dr. Montagnier, the discoverer of
HIV, found that blood from AIDS patients reacted with a p41 protein
that was found in HIV-infected cells and non-HIV-infected cells.
It was concluded that the p41 band was the result of contamination
of the virus by a protein called actin, which is a normal component
of all cells, as well as other microbes besides HIV. In other
words, many other things besides HIV can give you a positive reading
on the p41 band.
<P>
P120 and p160: P120 is found on the knobs on the surface of the
immature HIV particles and p160 is found only in infected cells,
but neither is found in the mature, free virus particles. However,
the blood from AIDS patients reacts with the &quot;purified HIV&quot;
in the AIDS test, and bands corresponding to p120 and p160 develop.
This is a contradiction. Since no p120 or p160 is found in the
mature virus, there would not be any in the test kit antigen preparation
either. So where do these bands come from?
<P>
If p160 is split apart, you get p120 and p41. It is thought, then,
that the p120 and p160 bands do not actually represent p120 and
p160, but rather are what chemists refer to as oligomers of p41.
An oligomer is an integral number of subunits of something else.
If you put four subunits of p41 together, you get p160; three
subunits of p41 equals p120 (4 x 40 = 160; 3 x 40 = 120). Therefore
p120 and p160 are not different proteins at all; they are just
several &quot;packages&quot; of p41 which are hooked together
by chemical bonds. And if, as discussed above, p41 is simply a
contaminant of cellular material, then this disqualifies p120,
p160, and p41.
<P>
P31-32: Proteins are composed of amino acids. In 1987, a study
was done by L.E. Henderson<A HREF="#Ref1">(1)</A> which compared
the amino-acid sequences of &quot;purified HIV&quot; with those
of a normal protein found in the human immune system called &quot;Class
II histocompatibility DR proteins&quot; and found the DR proteins
to be identical to the p30-32 proteins of HIV. Good-bye, p31-32!
<P>
P24: Detection of p24 is considered to be synonymous with the
actual presence of HIV. However, Robert Gallo (co-discoverer of
HIV), has stated repeatedly that p24 is not unique to HIV, but
that another retrovirus (HTLV-1, which does not cause any disease)
contains p24, and this will cross-react on the antibody test.
The test may say you have antibodies to HIV in your blood, but
it could really be HTLV-1 instead.
<P>
In fact, a p24 has been found in HTLV-1, HTLV-II, HIV-2, and in
all endogenous retroviruses. The specific gene which contains
the information to make p24 (called the gag gene) is found in
all retroviruses. Hence it is not surprising that a p24 is commonly
found in the absence of HIV.
<P>
If a p24 band appears by itself on the Western Blot test without
any of the other HIV bands, the test will be called &quot;indeterminate.&quot;
This means the test does not show enough bands to be sure of anything,
but generally an indeterminate test is not a cause for alarm.
P24 is the predominant band that shows up to cause an indeterminate
Western Blot test. The indeterminate pattern is very common and
does not correlate to the presence of HIV. Reference is made to
a group of patients who received blood which had been tested by
Western Blot and found to be negative; however, within six months,
42% of these patients had developed indeterminate WB tests.
<P>
Eleopulos and associates give a list of conditions where patients
have p24 antibodies without HIV: multiple sclerosis, generalized
warts, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and even 1 out of 150 healthy
individuals. In the studies cited, p24 antigen was found in only
25-50% of the HIV+ patients or AIDS patients investigated. It
was concluded that the P24 antigen test was &quot;erratic&quot;
and &quot;should be interpreted cautiously&quot;. Looks like we
can't count on p24 either.
<P>
In spite of all the evidence to the contrary, the p160, p120,
and p41 bands are considered to represent distinct viral proteins.
<P>
In conclusion, Eleopulos states that &quot;(in) view of the above,
it is difficult to defend the view that the bands p41 (and thus
p120 and p160), p32, or p24 represent specific HIV proteins.&quot;
In addition, she thinks that even if these proteins were shown
to be specific to HIV, you could not assume that the antibodies
that react with them are diagnostic of HIV infection (we will
discuss cross-reactions in a minute).
<P>
As you can see from the table in figure 2, the different agencies
(FDA, American Red Cross, Centers for Disease Control (CDC), CRSS,
and World Health Organization (WHO) consider the Western Blot
test to be positive if at least two or three bands are present,
and you can take your pick from the four HIV proteins we mentioned.
However, since the p31-32 band represents a cellular protein,
and p120 and p160 are just different forms of p41, all you really
have left to choose from are p24 and p41, both of which may or
may not represent HIV proteins.
<P>
In summary, the Western Blot is based on detection of five primary
protein bands: p24, p32, p41, p120, and p160. Data has been given
to cast doubt on the authenticity of any of these proteins as
always (or even part of the time) representing HIV proteins.
<H2>The Test is not Standardized</H2>

<P>
If this isn't bad enough, the Australian paper expresses concern
that there is no standard way to interpret the Western Blot test.
There are various patterns of bands. What do they mean? For an
antibody test to mean anything, it must be standardized. As Eleopulos
states: &quot;(The test results must give the same meaning) in
all patients, all laboratories, and all countries.&quot; In reality,
the blood sample from an AIDS patient:
<P>
-- may not react with all HIV proteins;
<P>
-- may react with non-HIV proteins;
<P>
-- may give different results on different blood samples obtained
from the same patient at different times.
<P>
Because of this, the various agencies established the criteria
as set forth on the table. Depending on whose criteria you use,
the same group of AIDS patients yielded anywhere from a 50% to
a 79% positivity rate. Eleopulos says that &quot;in the scientific
literature, no strips have been published of a standard positive
Western Blot.&quot; In addition, the band pattern obtained will
vary with the temperature and concentration of the chemicals used
in the test.
<P>
As Zolla-Pazner et al. put it, there is &quot;confusion over the
identification of these bands&quot; which has &quot;resulted in
incorrect conclusions...&quot;.<A HREF="#Ref2">(2)</A> You might
hope that it wasn't your test that gave one of these &quot;incorrect
conclusions.&quot;
<H2>The Test is not Reproducible</H2>

<P>
Finally, a test must be reproducible in order to be valid. Using
a single blood sample, the band patterns should be the same or
similar from one test to another, or on tests performed at different
labs. The CRSS did a study where they took two known positive
samples and two known negative samples and sent them around to
19 laboratories for Western Blot testing. The same serum was tested
multiple times in each lab and the resulting band patterns showed
quite extreme variations both from one lab to the next, and from
one test to the next in the same lab.
<P>
It must also be noted that the labs involved were &quot;Reference
Labs,&quot; which is what they call the top quality labs. Eleopulos
remarked that these top labs make up only a small number of the
total number of labs performing this test, most other labs not
being as top-notch, and presumably getting more erratic results,
with more false positives.
<H2>The False Positive</H2>

<P>
The issue of false positives is a big can of worms with these
antibody tests. Massive ELISA testing in Russia resulted in 280
false positives for every 1 &quot;true positive&quot;. In spite
of much evidence to the contrary, there is an uninformed &quot;general
consensus that proof of the specificity of the HIV antibody tests
is firmly established&quot;.<A HREF="#Ref3">(3)</A>
<P>
The belief that the antibody tests are &quot;98-100%&quot; specific
is based on the work of both Gallo and Burke and their colleagues.
As a gold standard, Gallo used the clinical syndrome. All AIDS
indicator diseases have been around for centuries, so their presence
does not prove there is HIV in the body. Yet Gallo was saying
that as long as a patient had what looked like AIDS, then a positive
test result must be correct. The fact that a person has one of
the diseases in the AIDS syndrome does not have any bearing on
the accuracy of the HIV antibody test.
<P>
Burke tested a low-risk group of military recruits and found 15
positives out of 135,187 total. Rechecking each of these positive
results against four other different antibody tests, he found
that 14 were still positive on all four tests and 1 was negative
on all four tests. He calculated the false positive rate to be
1 out of 135,187, or 0.0007%. Eleopulos's group criticizes Burke's
methodology for determining the false positive rate. By definition,
a true positive is a positive test occurring in a person who is
HIV infected as verified by an independent test (the gold standard);
a false positive is a test in a person who by application of the
gold standard, does not have an HIV infection. The four other
antibody tests that Burke used to confirm his WB results do not
provide any independent evidence of HIV infection or absence thereof.
These four tests and the original WB test are all looking for
the same antibodies -- they are all essentially the same test.
A test cannot act as a gold standard for itself. Therefore, since
Burke did not use a gold standard, it was impossible for him to
measure the false positive rate for his WB tests. The authors
do not estimate the actual false positive rate, but other sources
have put it as high as 90% and it may be even higher. <A HREF="#Ref11">(11)</A>
<H2>Multiple Testing</H2>

<P>
Another problem seems to be that if you keep repeating a person's
initially positive test, a significant number of people will eventually
end up testing negative. If you give two ELISAs and then two WBs
in succession, many people will test negative on each subsequent
test, so by the time you get to the fourth test, only a few will
still be positive. If this last group of people were to be given
only one, or even two, antibody tests, they would be considered
to be HIV infected, when in fact they are not.
<P>
This is a serious flaw of the antibody tests. The official screening
test is the ELISA, which has an astronomical false positive rate,
and the CDC's current AIDS definition accepts a single ELISA test
without confirmation. In other words, a single positive ELISA
(plus an AIDS indicator disease) gets you an official AIDS diagnosis.
<P>
In practice, a positive ELISA may or may not be confirmed with
a Western Blot, and in any event, as we have just seen, a single
test, or even several more subsequent tests, may all be false
positives and a person may go on to get a negative result on the
third, fourth, or fifth test, and so on. So a simple screening
test or even a screening test plus a confirmatory test (ELISA
+ WB), may often not give the true picture.
<H2>Cross Reactions</H2>

<P>
Neither Burke et al. <A HREF="#Ref4">(4)</A> nor Gallo et. al.
<A HREF="#Ref5">(5)</A> tested people who had &quot;other diseases
where antibodies, some of which may interact with HIV antigens,
may be produced for other reasons.&quot;
<P>
Eleopulos discusses the phenomenon of &quot;biological false positives
(BFPs),&quot; false positives which will result in patients with
any number of conditions unrelated to the condition being tested
for. This is a common phenomenon in syphilis tests, for instance.
I had a BFP reaction on a syphilis test once myself due to a previous
case of cat scratch fever. BFPs to syphilis may occur in patients
with lupus, auto-immune hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic
purpura, leprosy, or in drug addicts.
<P>
Some groups of people generally make a lot of antibodies because
they are exposed to a much greater than normal amount of diseases
and unhealthy conditions. This includes poverty-stricken Africans
and IV drug users. According to Biggar et al., &quot;reactivity
in both ELISA and Western Blot analysis may be nonspecific in
Africans...&quot; <A HREF="#Ref6">(6)</A> And, of course, all
our ideas about a huge African AIDS epidemic are based on ELISA
testing programs.
<P>
The scientific literature is full of references to data which
show &quot;the widespread presence of nonspecific interactions
between retroviral antigens and unrelated antibodies.&quot; Eleopulos
cites a long list of cross-reactions. A subject was injected repeatedly
with HIV negative donor blood serum and his WB test was initially
negative, but with each injection, it became more strongly positive.
Mice injected with uninfected T-lymphocytes from another mouse
strain developed antibodies to HIV! The test also cross-reacts
in malaria patients, 25-41% of Venezuelan malaria patients being
Western Blot positive, but with no AIDS.
<H2>Isolating Virus</H2>

<P>
Eleopulos and associates believe that all these difficulties with
the specificity of the WB could be avoided by use of HIV isolation
as a gold standard, which is the only acceptable method; however,
&quot;This has not yet been done, and may not even be feasible&quot;.
<P>
HIV isolation means to separate the pure virus particle from all
other material in the cell culture. To use virus isolation as
a gold standard, you need to be absolutely certain that the material
you have isolated is actually the particular virus you are looking
for and not anything else -- not another virus, not fragments
of cells, not &quot;virus-like&quot; particles, and so on. The
method used to isolate the virus involves separating out the liquid
part of the cell culture (the supernatant) and spinning it in
a centrifuge. This separates particles according to their different
densities. It's sort of like telling the difference between two
identical-appearing balls, one made of steel and the other of
plastic, by throwing them into a swimming pool -- the steel ball
sinks and the plastic one floats. See Figure 3 for an illustration
of this principle.
<P>
It is believed that the material which settles at a density of
1.16 gm/ml is composed of virus particles and nothing else. The
problem here is that some parts of cells have the same buoyant
density as viruses. Some eminent virologists have pointed out
that one cannot avoid contamination of the viral preparation with
various other types of cellular material and cell fragments, since
cells are going to rupture in the process. Since some of the cellular
material has the same density as the virus, if you have a band
showing up at 1.16 gm/ml, you still cannot be sure what it is.
Because of this, researchers in the 1970s who were trying to isolate
pure retroviruses visually confirmed their findings by using the
electron microscope.
<P>
Using the above techniques, the best results could be obtained
with supernatant fluids that contain a lot of virus and very few
cellular contaminants. These conditions can best be satisfied
by viruses which do not kill the cells they infect and in culture
conditions where most cells remain alive (and intact) during infection.
Here, retroviruses fit the bill. These properties of retroviruses
make it much easier to separate them from everything else, including
cellular contaminants. This would aptly describe most retroviral
tissue cultures. However, just the opposite is the case with HIV.
<H2>Cellular &quot;Lysates&quot;</H2>

<P>
AIDS tissue cultures have very little virus, so little that it
is hard to detect at all. The cells in these cultures are difficult
to keep alive. Gallo, Montagnier, and other AIDS researchers have
always found the concentration of virus-like particles in their
tissue cultures to be very low. So here you have lots of cells
and not much of these virus-like particles which they have called
virus particles (it is pointed out that just because these particles
looked like a virus does not constitute proof that they were in
fact viruses). This situation will give you the least accurate
results in terms of separating pure HIV particles from everything
else that bands at 1.16 gm/ml.
<P>
In addition, the official party line on HIV is that it, unlike
other retroviruses, does kill cells. There are many theories as
to how it does this, including &quot;apoptosis,&quot; a sort-of
cellular suicide. If HIV is responsible for cell death one way
or another, the result would be that the dead cells would have
ruptured and the supernatant fluid would thus be full of cell
fragments and cellular material from the ruptured cells.
<P>
Since some of this cellular material has the same density as retroviruses,
then it is difficult to know what you really have showing up on
the band that supposedly represents &quot;pure HIV.&quot;
<P>
Eleopulos and colleagues contend that no one knows what particles,
if any, band at 1.16 gm/ml and no one knows the density of what
is called HIV. They state that &quot;most if not all claims of
'HIV isolation' have been from cellular lysates.&quot;<A HREF="#Ref3">(3)</A>
(A lysate is the material formed by the fragmentation of cells.)
In fact, &quot;the available evidence... indicates that only about
20% of the proteins which band at 1.16 gm/ml are 'HIV proteins;'
the rest are cellular...&quot;<A HREF="#Ref3">(3)</A> This situation
is very likely to arise since &quot;HIV-infected&quot; cultures
die and cultures are most often deliberately lysed.
<P>
To sort out this confusion, it would help to have a look at this
material with an electron microscope, but, as Eleopulos and colleagues
note, the AIDS literature contains no electron microscope pictures
of the material that bands at 1.16 gm/ml, and there is no way
for us to know whether this material &quot;contains any such particles
(pure HIV particles) whatsoever.&quot; They point out that the
literature uses terms such as &quot;HIV,&quot; &quot;HIV isolation,&quot;
&quot;pure particles,&quot; &quot;virus particles,&quot; and so
on, and that these terms have a variety of meanings, but &quot;most
often without proof of the presence of a (virus) particle.&quot;
<H2>Claims of HIV Isolation</H2>

<P>
There are many accepted &quot;proofs&quot; of HIV isolation which
turn out to be no proof at all. For instance, there is a substance
called template-primer AndT15, which is copied if it is incubated
with the supernatant or with the material that bands at 1.16 gm/ml.
This activity is considered to be proof of reverse transcriptase
activity and thus of HIV isolation. However, the same template-primer
is copied when incubated with several other types of cells that
are not infected with HIV, including normal uninfected spermatozoa.
It is copied by reverse transcriptase (which is found in retroviruses)
but it is also copied by cellular DNA polymerase (which is not
found in retroviruses).
<P>
Certain particles are detected in AIDS cultures and these particles
are considered by most AIDS researchers to be HIV. However, there
are a lot of situations where HIV particles are found alongside
non-HIV particles, or alongside &quot;virus-like particles&quot;
that are &quot;some what different&quot; from what are generally
accepted to be HIV particles, and so on. HIV is a Type-C retrovirus
and type-C particles appear in non-HIV infected lymphoma cells
which are metabolically impaired. &quot;Retroviral particles&quot;
that have similar antigenic properties to HIV have been found
in patients with Sjogren's syndrome. Virus particles indistinguishable
from HIV are found in a variety of non-HIV associated lymphadenopathies.
This goes on, with the conclusion that &quot;the presence of such
particles (does not, by itself), indicate infection with HIV.&quot;<A HREF="#Ref7">(7)</A>
<H2>Again, the Gold Standard</H2>

<P>
It seems to be almost impossible to isolate HIV and know for sure
that you have HIV and not any of the many above-mentioned entities.
And even though researchers have accepted a wide variety of phenomena
as representing HIV isolation, and have gone to extraordinary
lengths to isolate the virus, &quot;it is still not possible to
isolate HIV from all antibody positive patients.&quot;<A HREF="#Ref3">(3)</A>
Conversely, with the same effort, HIV can be isolated from patients
who do not have AIDS and who have a negative AIDS test! Using
detection of p24 as a method of HIV isolation, positive results
have been found in a large majority of &quot;presumably uninfected&quot;
people with indeterminate Western Blot tests, and in all of a
group of HIV negative blood donors.
<P>
There is absolutely no correlation between &quot;HIV isolation&quot;
and a positive antibody test, and the CDC admits this. The CDC
calls a positive antibody test a &quot;documented infection,&quot;
and yet &quot;the virus cannot be detected in every person with
a documented infection.&quot;<A HREF="#Ref8">(8)</A> Therefore
using HIV isolation as a gold standard to authenticate the validity
of the antibody test is problematic at best.
<H2>Genetic Sequencing</H2>

<P>
Another way of trying to find the virus is by genomic investigations.
The goal is to try and prove that AIDS patients have been infected
with a unique, exogenous retrovirus. (Exogenous means originating
outside the body, as opposed to endogenous, which means originating
from within the body.) A genome is simply the total package of
hereditary information found in the genes, which are made up of
DNA or RNA. It seems that if you could determine that a certain
retrovirus has a distinct genetic sequence, then when you find
this genetic sequence, you could say you have found the virus.
Well, it really isn't that simple.
<P>
Information about the genome is contained in RNA or DNA. A retrovirus
does not have any DNA; it only has RNA. The way a retrovirus infects
a cell is by using reverse transcriptase to turn its RNA into
DNA, and by turning this DNA loose in the cell, where it then
becomes integrated with the DNA of the cell. This DNA translation
of the retrovirus's genetic information can then be used as a
pattern, or template, to produce additional copies of the virus,
which are then sent forth from the cell. The retroviral genome,
when integrated into the cell's DNA, is called a provirus.
<P>
Various phenomena are discussed that provide a &quot;stumbling
block to any genetic analysis of (retroviruses,)&quot;<A HREF="#Ref9">(9)</A>
but the main trouble spots are as follows:
<H3>No two HIV genomes are the same.</H3>

<P>
&quot;No two identical HIV have been isolated even from the same
person,&quot;<A HREF="#Ref3">(3)</A> at different times or at
the same time. In the same patient, HIVs from different types
of cells are different. Different types of cells used in the cell
cultures produce different HIVs.
<H3>HIV sequences cannot be found in all AIDS patients.</H3>

<P>
Try as they might, AIDS researchers just cannot find much virus,
and in a lot of cases, they cannot find any! The polymerase chain
reaction test (PCR) was introduced to improve detection of viruses.
It is supposed to be the equivalent of being able to find a needle
in a haystack, since it can find one gene or fragment of a gene
and amplify it to the point where you can now detect it. This
is the test you now see in all the ads, promising you accurate
results within four weeks of infection.
<P>
Even with such a test as PCR, there &quot;is the scarcity or apparent
absence of viral DNA in a proportion of patients.&quot;<A HREF="#Ref10">(10)</A>
PCR cannot detect HIV in the majority of semen samples from AIDS
patients. What does this do to our theory that HIV is primarily
sexually transmitted? If PCR cannot find it, it is simply not
there to be found.
<P>
However, Eleopulos and associates comment that even with PCR,
there is some confusion as to the meaning of the test results,
especially when one is trying to use PCR as a gold standard to
confirm the actual presence of virus in the body of an HIV positive
person. Blood samples were tested using PCR and the standard ELISA
tests and the results were compared. From one lab to the next,
correspondence between the two varied between 40% and 100%, which
means that between 0% to 60% of the time, one or the other of
these tests must have been wrong. False positives and false negatives
on PCR were also observed.
<H3>The positive hybridization results may not be HIV specific.
</H3>

<P>
Hybridization is a lab technique which is useful in identifying
cells replicating HIV. On Gallo's first hybridization studies,
he found the bands were &quot;faint&quot; or &quot;low signal.&quot;
He thought this meant that there was not very much virus but conceded
that it might mean the test was picking up a homologous virus
(a different virus that is very similar in structure and origin).
This paper argues that the latter is true. HIV-related sequences
have been found in normal cells as well, so many HIV phenomena
could well be cellular in origin.
<P>
Eleopulos and her co-authors conclude by stating that the use
of antibody tests to predict or diagnose HIV infection, or for
epidemiological surveillance, &quot;needs,&quot; as she politely
puts it, &quot;to be carefully reappraised.&quot; I will be less
than polite and tell you that these tests are not accurate; they
are a treacherous deception and making any life-and-death decisions
based on a positive antibody test is a very foolish thing to do.
It can only lead to tragedy.

<H1>HEAL's Alternative AIDS Test</H1>

<ADDRESS>
by F.R. Buianouckas, Ph.D.
</ADDRESS>

<P>
If there is one thing working against an HIV+ individual's innate
capacity and expectation for health, it is the well publicized
equations HIV=AIDS=DEATH. These equations imply a natural progression
of 1) testing positive, 2) asymptomatic illness, 3) symptomatic
illness, and finally 4), prematurely succumbing to some one of
the 29 AIDS defining diseases. Accordingly, the simple antibody
test for HIV is in itself toxic, imbued with the potential to
terrify and destroy anyone claimed to be so infected.
<P>
To overcome this psychological barrier it is necessary to change
the way one thinks about HIV and possibly about living life itself.
A person must first answer the question, do I want to live? If
so, a person must then be willing to suspend the belief that HIV
is going to kill him and accept the fact that HIV is not sufficient
to cause AIDS. The desire to live and the suspension of this deadly
belief must both be accepted unconditionally.
<P>
Let's explore the belief. When a person is vaccinated against
polio virus they test positive for antibodies against this virus
and are then considered immune to further infection, therefore
free from the possibility of disease. Now, in a complete turn
around, we are told that having neutralizing antibodies against
HIV means we are eventually going to come down with some combination
of one, two or more of a total of 29 AIDS defining diseases. These
antibodies are no good, we are told, because HIV mutates very
often or somehow down the line HIV erupts and the antibodies disappear.
<P>
However, it is virtually impossible to recover virus from the
peripheral blood of an infected person with antibodies to HIV,
hence the antibodies must be neutralizing antibodies. The fact
remains, nobody has determined how, or even shown that, HIV causes
AIDS. It is well known in AIDS &quot;scientific circles&quot;
that HIV is NOT sufficient to cause AIDS. Remember, AIDS is defined
as having one or more of the 29 defining diseases in addition
to antibodies against HIV. HIV is only necessary for AIDS by definition.
<P>
Worse, the HIV antibody test (Western Blot Test) is flawed in
four distinct ways; a) it tests for antibodies against proteins
which are not unique to HIV, b) there is no standard procedure
for interpreting whether a Western Blot Test is positive, c) the
test is not reproducible, that is, a sample analyzed by different
laboratories or even the same sample analyzed by the same laboratory
yields different results, and d) HIV has never been isolated into
its pure state. Any &quot;isolation&quot; has always been contaminated
with cellular debris, so there is no gold standard for HIV. It
is therefore more correct to say Western Blot positive (WB+) than
HIV+.
<P>
Often there is some mention of a low T4 cell count but there are
problems with this as a diagnostic tool and it probably should
not be used. There is evidence that the stress-related hormone
cortisol (hydrocortisone) causes an absolute drop in T-helper
cells and a percentage-wise inversion of the ratio between T-helper
and T-suppressor cells, just as in AIDS. HIV positive (WB+) people
often experience profound psychological stress as a result of
their test results. These people may also know many friends who
have been hospitalized with T4 counts higher than 500 T4 /cml
of blood. Thus they are led to expect sickness.
<P>
Robert W. Maver, F.S.A., writing for the newsletter &quot;Rethinking
AIDS&quot;, after reviewing CDC data on AIDS, concludes: &quot;there
are virtually NO AIDS&Ecirc;cases where the sole infectious agent
is HIV&quot;.
<P>
Professor Luc Montaignier of the Pasteur Institute, at the July
1992 AIDS conference in Amsterdam said, &quot;I think that we
should put the same weight on the cofactors (as we have on HIV).&quot;
<P>
So let's examine the question of &quot;high risk&quot;. The majority
of gay males diagnosed HIV+ (WB+) are considered high-risk. Minimally
this means that they have exchanged blood with someone who was
possibly infected with HIV. But it is extraordinarily difficult
to be infected with HIV because there is virtually no free retrovirus
in an infected person's blood. Infection occurs only after many
exposures. Moreover, infection depends on the individual's susceptibility
or predisposition to infectious agents. Just as not everyone exposed
to a flu bug gets the flu, the same is true for HIV. HIV is hundreds
of millions of times harder to get than the flu. And as mentioned
above, there is also a possibility of becoming HIV antibody positive
without HIV. One merely has to raise antibodies against foreign
white blood cells or a host of other foreign proteins or substances.
<P>
More generally, &quot;high-risk&quot; implies overuse of medical
drugs, abuse of recreational drugs, numerous infections other
than HIV, or a host of other problems in the spiritual/mental,
emotional, and physical realms. In almost all cases these &quot;high-risk
co-factors&quot; were in place long before infection with HIV.
All of this qualifies as severe antigenic stress.
<P>
Particularly with the advent of &quot;AIDS without HIV&quot;,
these &quot;co-factors&quot; ought to be considered factors on
the way to AIDS. (Of course AIDS without HIV is bizarre since
an AIDS diagnosis requires HIV. What it means is that an AIDS
defining disease is present, there is a low T-cell count, the
individual belongs to a high-risk group, but there is absolutely
no HIV present.) These factors represent a serious toxification
of all gays who are at high-risk prior to HIV infection.
<P>
It is therefore necessary for anybody truly at risk for AIDS who
is genuinely interested in preventing AIDS, to eliminate toxicities
from their lives. There are toxic substances, toxic thoughts,
toxic attitudes and toxic associations. The following questions
are to help you decide if there are toxins in your life. The questions
are broad and are not meant to diagnose any condition, they are
solely for a self-made estimate of toxificaton. The information
may then be used by you to assist your health-care provider. The
questions require either a yes or a no answer.
<P>
(We must also remember the urgency for people with AIDS to suspend
belief in the notion that AIDS is always fatal. It is not. Keeping
that in mind, you too can use this instrument to evaluate your
level of toxicities.)

If you answered yes to even one of these questions there is a
possibility that you are toxified on the mental/spiritual, emotional,
or physical plane. You have the choice to seek out a health care
professional who could help address these issues. Homeopathic
detoxification offers help for the deepest levels of distress.
Chinese medicine and naturopathic medicine are also very helpful
in detoxification. There are also nutritional and herbal detoxifications.
You are also encouraged to look up any of the drugs mentioned
above in the Physicians Desk Reference to determine the full range
of their effects.
<P>
If you determine that you are toxified, it makes no sense to continue
putting toxic drugs into your system, you will only become more
toxic and these toxicities are life threatening. You can empower
yourself to go off all toxic drugs (under trusted health-care
supervision) and detoxify. Often the results of detoxifiction
are startling. People have experienced improved health (mental/spiritual,
emotional, and physical) determined by their own improved attitudes
and improved laboratory results. It is essential however, that
you suspend the belief that HIV is going to kill you and that
you truly want to live. This is unconditional! HEAL YOURSELF!
<P>
<EM>There are some caveats:</EM>
<P>
i) <EM>if you are HIV antibody positive</EM> (WB+) it is impossible
to get a diagnosis for any physical condition without having it
compromised by your status; that is, if you have a simple rash
from some independent condition, the doctor will still blame it
on HIV;
<P>
ii) <EM>if you are not HIV+</EM> (WB+) but you are gay, doctors
often lean towards an AIDS diagnosis for anything that may be
hard to diagnose or what is ruled out because of their bias towards
an HIV/AIDS diagnosis for gay males. An acquaintance recently
told me that he had a breathing crisis, he went to a hospital
but withheld the information that he is gay. They immediately
determined that he had asthma. His own doctor was astonished,
since he had been searching for AIDS conditions for four months
and asthma had not even been suspected.
<P>
Remember; the probability that a person diagnosed with AIDS has
a past toxic history is greater than the probability that a person
with a past or present use of toxic materials will eventually
be diagnosed with AIDS. One reason for this is that each indivudual's
dose tolerance is different. This situation makes it easier to
deny the RISK/AIDS hypothesis and fall prey to the naive and deadly
HIV/AIDS hypothesis. But denial does not alter truth. Denial can
be and is deadly!
<P>
A Western Blot positve result is a WAKE-UP call not a death sentence!

<H1>Condomania: Common Sense or Nonsense?</H1>

<ADDRESS>
By Peter W. Plumley, F.S.A. 
</ADDRESS>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Always wear a condom!!&quot; &quot;Safe sex for all!!&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
How often have we heard this? Plenty - that's how often.
<P>
Now that Bill Clinton is in the White House, condoms have replaced
abstinence as the centerpiece of &quot;AIDS prevention&quot; efforts
for heterosexuals. They are handed out in schools, in some cases
to children who are too young to even care about matters sexual.
Any talk show dealing with sex emphasizes the need to practice
&quot;safe sex&quot;. Those who claim to use condoms get applauded;
those who don't get booed.
<P>
These &quot;AIDS prevention&quot; warnings are based on the assumption
that AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, known
as &quot;HIV&quot;, and therefore to control the AIDS epidemic
we must prevent the transmission of HIV.
<P>
Later, we'll discuss whether HIV really does cause AIDS by itself,
or requires some cofactor, or even is unrelated to AIDS. However,
for the moment, let's assume that HIV infection is bad for you,
and then analyze whether these &quot;safe sex&quot; warnings are
desirable for those who make up the great majority of the American
public - the heterosexuals who are not into the drug culture.
<P>
>From a public health point of view, does &quot;condomania&quot;
make sense for the average American?
<H2>Condoms and hard hats</H2>

<P>
Do you wear a hard hat all the time? No, of course not. Neither
does anyone else. Yes, construction workers do while at work,
and so do others such as football and hockey players, some motorcyclists
and bicyclists, and people who are engaged in work or play where
there is a special risk of injury to the head.
<P>
But how many hard hats do you see on the heads of people walking
down Main Street or riding in a car? Few, if any. Is this because
there is no risk at all of getting hit on the head? Not at all.
Many people have been hurt or killed from head injuries that would
have been prevented if they had worn a hard hat while going about
their daily activities.
<P>
Then why doesn't everyone wear a hard hat all day long? The answer
is simple. It's because <A HREF="#ref1">(1)</A> for most people
the risk of a head injury is very small, and <A HREF="#ref2">(2)</A>
a hard hat is inconvenient and uncomfortable to wear. So unless
you are a construction worker or an athlete, you probably are
willing to take this small risk in order to avoid the inconvenience
and discomfort.
<P>
What about condoms? Isn't it possible that the failure to use
a condom could cause you to become infected with a sexually transmitted
disease (&quot;STD&quot;)? Certainly - we've known that for years!
<P>
And what about the dreaded HIV? That's supposed to spread sexually,
too. Yet we know that the majority of men are not using condoms,
in spite of all the &quot;safe sex&quot; messages. Why aren't
they? Are they foolhardy and irresponsible?
<P>
Or are condoms like hard hats - awkward and uncomfortable to wear,
and designed to prevent a risk too small to be of concern for
most people?
<H2>Who is really at risk for HIV?</H2>

<P>
A recent study of the sexual lifestyles of Americans titled &quot;Sex
in America&quot;<A HREF="#ref1">(1)</A> confirms that, not only
is HIV infection currently confined largely to such &quot;high-risk&quot;
groups as homosexual men (see below), and IV drug users, their
sexual partners and children, but also that it will stay that
way. In other words, HIV will not spread generally into the heterosexual
population through sexual contact.
<P>
There are two reasons for this. First, according to the study
there isn't that much sexual contact between these groups and
the rest of the heterosexual population.
<P>
But another, more important reason, is that, unlike other sexually
transmitted diseases, HIV is extremely difficult to transmit heterosexually<A HREF="#ref2">(2)</A>,
particularly from a female to a male.<A HREF="#ref3">(3)</A> It
can be mathematically demonstrated<A HREF="#ref4">(4)</A> that
the more difficult it is to transmit an STD, the greater the proportion
of such transmissions occur between primary, regular, and possibly
monogamous partners, rather than between those involved with &quot;one
night stands&quot;.
<P>
Because HIV is so difficult to transmit sexually, HIV infections
that are caused by heterosexual contact usually arise from a regular,
long term sexual relationship with an IV drug user. (Occasionally,
though, an individual has an unusual susceptibility to HIV infection,
perhaps because of genital sores or lesions from some other STD).
<P>
As a result, while other, more easily transmitted, STDs go from
a man to a woman to a man to a woman, etc. by sexual contact,
HIV typically goes from an IV drug user to his regular sexual
partner, and no further.
<P>
What about homosexual men? Are they all at high risk for HIV infection?
Not really. Typically, HIV is confined to a relatively small subset
of homosexual men. Those at risk usually have engaged in repeated
(and frequently drug-induced) anal sexual practices which have
put them at risk for a variety of diseases, which in turn make
it easy for HIV to be transmitted. But it is not all homosexual
men that are at risk - only a specific subset.
<P>
So while there is a significant risk of HIV infection for many
of those in the &quot;high risk&quot; groups, namely, those engaging
in high-risk homosexual sex, and IV drug users and their regular
partners and children, the typical healthy heterosexual who is
not involved with the drug community has virtually no risk.
<P>
Can urging the use of condoms reduce the spread of HIV? If so,
is the right population being targeted?
<P>
We have seen that the &quot;politically correct&quot; position
is to urge everyone to use a condom, every time sex takes place.
<P>
But, wait a minute - if that really happened (and the condoms
always worked properly), wouldn't the human race eventually die
out because no more babies would be conceived?
<P>
Of course it would. So let's say that we don't need to use condoms
when having sex with our primary partner; however, if we have
multiple partners, then we should pull out the condom.
<P>
Nice idea, and one which might help reduce the spread of some
of the more easily transmitted STDs. But it won't do much for
the reduction of HIV transmission.
<P>
Contrary to popular belief, the risk of HIV infection does not
increase with the number of sexual partners. As we have seen,
HIV is so difficult to transmit sexually that HIV infection usually
requires a regular, long term sexual relationship with an HIV-infected
partner, not just a one night stand.
<P>
So we are faced with a dilemma. If we are able to get everyone
to use condoms all the time, we eventually wipe out the human
race. (Now that will stop the spread of AIDS!) On the other hand,
if we concentrate only on those who are engaging in sex with secondary
partners, very few HIV transmissions will be prevented.
<P>
Fortunately, the dilemma solves itself. The extreme difficulty
with which HIV transmits by heterosexual intercourse also is the
reason that most HIV transmissions are drug related, involving
either sharing needles or high-risk anal sex - not vaginal sex.
These easily identifiable groups are and continue to be the correct
target groups for both HIV infection and prevention. But keep
in mind, even if every heterosexual used a condom all of the time,
only a very small percentage of new HIV infections would be prevented.
Therefore, assuming HIV infection to be a matter of concern, the
place to look for significant ways to reduce its spread is not
by &quot;condomania&quot; for the great majority of heterosexuals,
but by focusing in on the real, significant risk groups.
<H2>Who is really at risk for AIDS?</H2>

<P>
Up to this point, we've been assuming that HIV is the cause of
AIDS. However, in the last few years, an increasing number of
respected scientists have come to the conclusion that the relationship
of HIV to AIDS is far more complicated than simply that &quot;HIV
causes AIDS&quot;. Some of these people, such as Dr. Peter Duesberg,
one of the world's leading authorities on retroviruses such as
HIV, believe that HIV is a harmless retrovirus that has nothing
to do with AIDS.<A HREF="#ref5">(5)</A> Others, such as Dr. Robert
Root-Bernstein, author of the book Rethinking AIDS<A HREF="#ref6">(6)</A>,
believe that HIV is related to AIDS in some way, but that it requires
some immune system damaging &quot;co-factor&quot; to be harmful.
<P>
Analysis of this issue is complicated by several factors.
<P>
One is that AIDS is not a disease - it is a syndrome consisting
of a number of diseases which have been around for years, but
have become much more prevalent in recent years. The official
theory is that this increase has occurred because of the spread
of the virus known as &quot;HIV&quot;. However, others believe
that it is the result of other, more conventional, causes such
as the dramatic increase in recreational drug use, drug-driven
anal sex and its associated diseases and treatments, and other
immune suppressing activities.
<P>
A second problem is that the definition of &quot;AIDS&quot; has
been expanded several times, most recently in 1993. It is a complicated
definition, which in most (but not all!) cases requires that the
person test positive for HIV. As a result, when developing AIDS
statistics, people with these diseases who are HIV-positive are
diagnosed with &quot;AIDS&quot;, while those who test HIV-negative
are simply diagnosed as having the underlying disease (which may
not even have to be reported to the local health department).
Naturally there is a high correlation between HIV and AIDS!
<P>
While we don't know all the answers, we do know that in virtually
every case in which &quot;AIDS&quot; has been diagnosed, there
is some provable and identifiable risk factor present (besides
HIV) which would tend to damage the immune system. In his book,
Dr. Root-Bernstein gives a lengthy list of drugs and other conditions
which are known to damage the immune system. These include not
only IV drugs, but also non-IV &quot;recreational&quot; drugs
such as crack, &quot;poppers&quot;, etc., as well as certain prescription
drugs such as AZT, and even some of the stronger drugs prescribed
for the treatment and prophylaxis of some sexually transmitted
diseases (drugs which are frequently taken in very large quantities).
It also includes immune system abnormalities such as hemophilia.
<P>
These provable and identifiable risk factors have been known for
years to cause immune system deficiencies, for both homosexuals
and heterosexuals. So regardless of whether or not HIV &quot;causes&quot;
AIDS, it is clear that the people who really are at significant
risk for developing potentially fatal diseases related to immune
system deficiencies - whether these diseases are called &quot;AIDS&quot;
or something else - are those who in one way or another have damaged
immune systems.
<P>
These are the people who need attention and education, if a significant
number of lives are to be saved. Urging the use of condoms will
not have a significant impact on the prevention of AIDS either,
because condoms do not affect the root causes of immune deficiency
problems.
<H2>AIDS and young people</H2>

<P>
We frequently hear about the &quot;exploding&quot; AIDS epidemic
among our young people. This is used as a compelling reason for
passing out condoms in the public schools. Yet the government's
own data indicates to the contrary.
<P>
The total number of AIDS cases reported to the Centers for Disease
Control in 1990 for ages 13-24 was 1796. In 1991, the number was
1633 - a decrease of 163, or 9%. In 1992, the number decreased
further, to 1605. Not exactly an &quot;exploding&quot; epidemic.
(A comparison with 1993 data is meaningless because of the expanded
definition of AIDS which took effect on January 1, 1993.)
<P>
Furthermore, as with all age groups, the majority of these cases
were attributed to high risk homosexual sex or IV drug use. And
the majority of those attributed to heterosexual contact involved
sexual contact with drug users.
<P>
For ages 13-24, deaths from AIDS are less than 2% of the total
deaths for those ages - and most of this 2% are drug-related.
So when young people compare the risks of getting AIDS from heterosexual
contact with the other, much greater, hazards they face in their
daily lives - guns, auto accidents, drugs, etc. - it is no wonder
that so many of them pay little attention to &quot;safe sex&quot;
warnings.
<P>
Once again, the solution is not condoms, but education about other
STDs and the dangers of drug use - but even more important, solving
the other, more serious problems facing our youth.
<H2>The dangers of &quot;condomania&quot;</H2>

<P>
As we have just seen, the Public Health Service's &quot;safe sex&quot;
campaigns for heterosexuals are destined to fail as a significant
AIDS prevention method. But are they doing any harm? After all,
considering the number of illegitimate births, isn't it a good
idea to try to scare young people into using condoms, and thereby
reduce the number of teenage pregnancies?
<P>
Some may think so, but this writer disagrees. We are telling everyone
that &quot;Unprotected sex means HIV infection&quot;, and &quot;HIV
infection means certain death&quot;. In the process we are terrorizing
the entire population about a virus of questionable pathogenicity
and about a disease that significantly affects only certain specific
and easily identifiable groups.
<P>
Does terrorizing the population do harm? You bet it does! Think
what is happening here. It is one thing to tell our daughters
not to get pregnant until they are married and ready for children.
But we are teaching our children (and everyone else) that &quot;intimacy
means death&quot;. In the process, we are interfering with one
of the most basic human desires - that of sexual intimacy - by
telling millions of people, most of whom have little or no risk
of HIV infection, that sex may kill them unless they &quot;protect&quot;
themselves from a partner who may be carrying a deadly, and transmittable,
virus. We are telling them that they may die a horrible death
unless they intrude on the lovemaking process by using some artificial
means to prevent their body fluids from intermingling, even though
for many that is an important part of the sexual experience.
<P>
Unfortunately, while most people understand that hard hats aren't
worth the bother when walking down Main Street, few understand
how difficult it is to get infected with HIV from sexual intercourse.
A survey conducted in 1987 by the National Center for Health Statistics<A HREF="#ref7">(7)</A>
indicated that 97% of those surveyed believed that unprotected
sex with someone with AIDS was either &quot;very likely&quot;
or &quot;quite likely&quot; to result in HIV infection. Only 3%
understood that it really was highly unlikely, because the HIV
is so difficult to transmit in that manner.
<P>
One must also wonder how many millions live in constant fear of
a disease they will never get, and how much harm this fear is
doing to their lives. On two occasions this author has talked
with women who expressed their reluctance to develop relationships
with men because of their fear of AIDS. On both occasions, they
were chain smoking as they talked - a habit ten thousand times
as dangerous as the sexual contact that they feared. One has to
wonder how many others have destroyed their health from some unhealthy
habit that they might have been able to break if they had felt
free to seek out the comfort of a loving relationship with someone.
<P>
Today our nation is terrorized by violence. Most of this violence
has nothing to do with AIDS. However, for years many prisons have
allowed conjugal visits in order to reduce the stress, and resulting
violence, among prisoners. If sex can reduce violence, doesn't
it follow that lack of sex will increase violence? How many of
the acts of violence in today's society are in some way related
to stress caused by the lack of a good sexual relationship due
to an unwarranted fear of AIDS?
<P>
And finally, consider what &quot;AIDS paranoia&quot; in general
has done. Today we have a population which not only has become
fearful of sex, but of almost any other type of contact with someone
who has simply tested HIV antibody positive. A 1990 report by
the American Civil Liberties Union<A HREF="#ref8">(8)</A> documented
13,000 complaints of AIDS-related discrimination. Laws have been
passed to prevent some of this discrimination, but these laws
cannot correct public attitudes - only better public education
can do that through a reduction in &quot;AIDS paranoia&quot;.
<P>
Unfortunately, &quot;condomania&quot; is doing just the opposite.
<P>
So, should anyone bother with condoms?
<P>
It is clear that not everyone needs to use a condom, any more
than we all should wear hard hats. But should anyone use a condom?
Certainly, just as some people should use hard hats.
<UL>
<LI>Condoms can be used to reduce the risk of unwanted pregnancy,
if no other method of birth control is being used.
<LI>Condoms should be used by high-risk homosexual men when engaging
in anal sex, particularly if many partners are involved, to prevent
the transmission of STDs.
<LI>Condoms should be used by heterosexuals for the prevention
of other STDs when one's sexual partner is at increased risk for
such diseases. For example, they should be used when one's partner
has a history of STDs, or has some current symptoms, such as lesions,
sores, or genital warts, or is particularly susceptible to exposure
to STDs (such as might be the case with a street prostitute).
</UL>

<P>
But in many cases, if your concern about sexually transmitted
disease is so great that you feel the need to use a condom, you
probably shouldn't be in the bedroom in the first place! (Would
you feel safe walking through a bad neighborhood, just because
you were wearing a hard hat to protect yourself from a rap on
the head by a mugger?).
<H2>Is there a better way?</H2>

<P>
When articles such as this one suggest that condoms aren't always
needed, someone is always quick to condemn the writer as &quot;irresponsible&quot;
and &quot;risking the lives of others&quot;.
<P>
However, the same statement could be made about an article urging
any activity involving even the smallest risk - boating, riding
in a car, skiing, etc. Yet those articles don't get criticized.
Why not? Because we all recognize that we must take some small
risks in order to enjoy life's pleasures.
<P>
The same is true for sexual pleasure. A good sexual relationship
is a normal and healthy part of human existence. However, such
relationships nearly always involve small risks of some sort,
even if only emotional. So while sexual responsibility is important,
paranoia about such &quot;one-in-a-million&quot; risks where common
sense should be sufficient protection can destroy the pleasure
that nature intended.
<P>
If &quot;condomania&quot; isn't the answer, is there a better
way to be safe from HIV and AIDS?
<P>
The good news is that there is.
<P>
We know that heterosexuals testing HIV-positive from sexual contact
nearly always either have a long term relationship with someone
who is HIV-positive usually from drug use, or themselves have
some STD or involvement with drugs which makes him or her unusually
susceptible to HIV infection.
<P>
We also know that the vast majority of AIDS cases continue to
be associated with substance abusers, both homosexual and heterosexual,
and their regular sexual partners (most of whom are also substance
abusers). These are the real risk groups for AIDS, and should
be the primary groups to target for AIDS prevention.
<P>
So a sensible way to avoid getting AIDS is not &quot;condomania&quot;.
Instead, it is to keep your own body healthy and not infected
with any other sexually transmitted disease (recognize the symptoms,
and get prompt treatment, if you get one), and to avoid street
drugs and any sexual relationship with those who use them. In
other words, avoid the various activities which have always caused
damage to the immune system.

<title>HEAL: Deconstructing AIDS</title>
<BODY>

<H1>Deconstructing AIDS: The Advanced Iatrogenic Disease Syndrome<sup><A href="#**">**</A></sup></h1>
<H2>AIDS and its Physical Basis</H2>

<p> The war on cancer was an embarrassing failure for the First Church of Corporate Medical Science. This and similar disasters have sent huge and growing numbers of people toward alternative forms of health care. As widespread medical dependency continues to diminish, the Church has been forced into a frantic scramble to reinforce its Divine Authority. A life-threatening epidemic was just what the doctor ordered. 

<p> In 1981, a handful of socially irresponsible scientists based in the Public Health Services' Epidemic Intelligence Service, were looking to save face and to ensure their agency's continued existence. Always on the lookout for clusters of illness with which to whip up public hysteria, they can then justify not only their own existence but widespread publicly-funded mass immunizations and expensive medical treatments. They failed miserably with the swine flu and Legionaires disease, had moderate success with herpes, but then they hit the jackpot. 

<p> They came upon a handful of seriously ill gay men who had histories of heavy drug use and sexually transmitted diseases. Asserting their illness to be the result of an immune deficiency exclusive of any drug toxicity, these scientists actively sought out heroin addicts and hemophiliacs with their commonly associated opportunistic infections, and then decided to throw into the pot some Florida-based Haitians with their endemic TB. Mix these unrelated groups and situations together and decide ahead of time that they have to be linked by an undiscovered retrovirus and viola - AIDS!

<p> The deadliest disease ever known, it is 100% fatal and everybody is at risk. Bingo! We're right back in the corporate trance. Billions and billions of dollars are being spent with our full and uncritical consent on an epidemic that never was. Once again Corporate Medical Science rules, backed by the media and the many thousands of other private and public organizations that they fund. 

<p> How could it have happened? If it is all a lie, how did it get to be this big? We are unwittingly and in many cases quite wittingly participating in genocide against gay men, IV drug users, the poor, and people of color. How? Why? If we only thought about it, we could see that AIDS doesn't spread. It develops in people who have overwhelmed their natural defences with many long term toxic assaults. Overwhelming levels of antigenic stress are what give the physical basis and reality to &quot;AIDS.&quot; Hysteria and iatrogenic poisoning are what fill in the gaps. 

<H2>The Goal of Hysteria</H2>

<p> So lets look at the hysteria, the poisoning has been discussed elsewhere <A href="#2">(2)</A>. AIDS was never 100% fatal. It was never even close. Yet hundreds of thousands of people living in terror have become the pawns and devotees to the mass hypnosis that is AIDS. The basis for the terror is a sense of helplessness in the face of illness and death. Until illness is recognized as an ally to be respected and not an enemy to be destroyed, and death is recognized to be a natural part of the life cycle, these irrational fears will remain and medical dependency will endure. 

<p> But there are other, more poignant factors. For many of these people, HIV/AIDS is the cure of a broken life. In a very perverse way it gives their lives and deaths meaning. Having HIV/AIDS has become a career, a badge of belonging, and many are receiving more attention and care than ever before. These people need AIDS. They have become addicted and do not want to lose their new found esteem! Unfortunately, in our opinion, these people cannot be saved. 

<p> There are others who need AIDS also. Do not forget. Medicine is a business. And like any other business it is profit-oriented, competition wary, and puts considerable effort into convincing us we need its dangerous goods and services. 

<p> But one key difference blinds us to this fact. Medicine deals in a very direct and immediate way with issues of life, death, sex and drugs. And if anything can entrance us and stir hysteria, panic and irrationality it is issues of life, death, sex and drugs. Because people fear illness, the slightest hint of something changing or happening in their bodies sparks hysterical reactions. And hysteria is the music to which white-coated authorities, the majority of which are blinded by their own dogma, sashay their way into our hearts, our souls and our wallets. 

<p> These are among the very powerful interests which maintain a conspiracy of silence, keeping crucial information, like recoveries and fraud, under wraps. Hysteria is necessary to divert attention away from these vital issues, the unconscious goal being to fuel a sense of accomplishment without really changing anything. 

<p> Again, billions and billions are being made and spent on HIV/AIDS. And the tension of CRISIS is a perfect substitute for creative and satisfying work and relationships. Many individuals in the major AIDS organizations are now living the financially secure lives they've always wanted to live. There's just this inconvenient nuisance of sick and dying people. 

<H2>The Next Generation</H2>

<p> Let's also keep in mind that AIDS has become a godsend for those obsessed with derailing the healthy expression of adolescent sexuality. It was bad enough when sex was dangerous. Now, SEX=DEATH. But unless these kids belong to, or are having sex with someone in a high-risk group, where does their high risk come from? Who in their sexual pool is going to cause a so-called &quot;AIDS infection&quot;? 

<p> They are at no risk for AIDS whatsoever. Although unsettling to anxious adults, the only effective way to guarantee safe, healthy behavior in teens is to affirm and respect their sexual birth right, not treat it like a dirty and hedonistic compulsion. 

<p> Why terrorize these kids? We expose them to and arouse them with an environment bursting with erotic images while shutting off their central outlet for gratification. Then we wonder why so many youth are violent, confused, depressed and suicidal, seeking solace in substances like drugs and alcohol. All one need do is think back to one's own ungratified adolescence. Not only are these kinds of feelings the precursors to a future parentage in which hysteria and sexual terror once again rule, but they frequently produce the behavior and substance abuse which can put teens at risk for needing and developing &quot;AIDS&quot; in the first place. 

<H2>Participate in the Cure</H2>

<p> AIDS is not a disease. It is a social agreement. <A href="#3">(3)</A> And like any agreement, participation is implied. The cure for AIDS, for those who actually want it, is to stop participating. Voila, no more AIDS! Then and only then can you productively and constructively address the genuine role of a toxic burden, the root of the hysteria, and the deadly role of both modern medicine and its government sponser and representative, the US Public Health Service. 

<p> We can save the people who've tested positive to HIV antibodies provided they are willing to save themselves. That is, as long as they neither want nor need &quot;AIDS&quot;. All that is necessary is to accompany an individual program of detox and spiritual/ emotional/ physical nourishment with a thorough breaking of the hex. There is also hope for those who have developed AIDS indicator diseases. Although in acute cases heroic medicine can be life saving, generally speaking, these people too can be assisted by a nourishing program of detox and de-hex that includes non-toxic treatments for their presenting conditions. 

<p> We know this to be true because it has been done already. A remarkable few with &quot;AIDS&quot; understood it to be a wake-up call, not a death-sentence. The same can be said of those who have tested Western Blot positive. They fired their doctors and left the AIDS organizations that are designed to perpetuate the crisis and undermine their health. It was then that they started on their very own personal Hero's journey. 

<p> In the case of AIDS, they took charge of their own recovery; in the case of testing positive to antibodies, they addressed their toxic burden and have since remained healthy. These people are the proof that it is the belief in HIV=AIDS=DEATH that kills like a truck! 

<p> Remember, there is no mystery here. Once hexed, even basically healthy people become 24-hour-a-day stress generators. This, added to the dangerous behaviors that testing HIV positive unleashes, the very toxic treatments, the assisted preparation for illness and death, and the death sentence itself, all combine to undermine their natural defenses. Is it any wonder these people develop life threatening diseases?! AIDS is neither infectious nor sexually transmitted. No virus, HIV or otherwise, is causing AIDS!!! <A href="#4">(4)</A> Just ask the &quot;experts&quot;- Where is the proof? Where is the proof? WHERE IS THE PROOF? There is none, folks. Help us stop HIV testing. It is a murderous scam.<A href="#5">(5)</A>

<H2>Deconstructing AIDS</H2>

<p> Even with the fine reporting by The Sunday Times of London, SPIN, the NY Native, Tony Brown's Journal, Earl Caldwell in the NY Daily News, Elinor Burkett formerly of the Miami Herald, Penthouse, National League of Nurse's Journal, and the heroic work of Joan Shenton and Meditel, we're only beginning to crack the profound AIDS TRANCE. Emminent researchers like Dr. Peter H. Duesberg and Kerry Mullis are deliberately and systematically marginalized. The well known threat of being de-funded as Duesberg was keeps cowardly scientists in line and ensures their silence. We are hereby calling for the immediate refunding of Peter H. Duesberg and wide-spread media coverage to dissident AIDS scientists. 

<p> A responsible press is essential to deconstructing AIDS. We have to see the gross failure of mainstream news to cover these urgent issues, particularly since they represent the views of their major sponsor - Corporate Medical Science. These glaring crimes against humanity remain unnoticed by the masses. Instead of counting panels on the AIDS Quilt we need to pay attention to the huge profits being made on all the dubious tests and treatments recommended by the &quot;AIDS EXPERTS&quot; and their minions: the &quot;AIDS COMMUNITY&quot;.

<H2>A Free Society?</H2>

<p> It is urgent that the public not only become aware of the fraud of HIV testing and the murderous treatments based on it, but of their own responsibility in perpetuating the situation. In time it will all fade away as it always does. But that's not good enough. The architects of the present situation have to crash and burn or they will never stop. They are guilty of the most heinous and despicable crimes ever. 

<p> The CDC, EIS, FDA, NIAID and much of the Public Health Service should be shut down. They represent the corporate medical community, not us. They are its legal strong arm. And not only do they keep safe, non-toxic, highly effective &quot;alternative&quot; therapies from openly competing with Western approaches but, under the direction of our corporate authorities, they unjustly discredit and outright outlaw them! 

<p> These people, along with the AMA, pharmaceutical and major AIDS organizational heads must be put on trial for this most vicious crime against humanity. We all know Modern Medicine is brutally harmful. We even make jokes about doctors killing their patients - &quot;Operation successful, patient dead.&quot; And yet we continue to sanction their actions with our uninformed consent. 

<p> Those who want AIDS can keep it. But HEAL is proof that the rest of us need not be contaminated with their hysteria and trance logic. We need your help! We need money to keep our organization going. We need office space and professional video editing equipment urgently. 

<p> We know that what we are dealing with is bigger than &quot;AIDS&quot;. AIDS itself is symptomatic of a much deeper social problem. But HEAL has come to realize we must first disempower the White Coats to help usher in the age of a health-regulated rather than disease-regulated society. There is no freedom without self-responsibility. And both are dependant upon a system built not on promoting fear, dependancy and the suppression of symptoms, but one built to protect health, self-regulation and the capacity to love. If you are able, please help us continue the work we began in 1982 towards promoting health and exploding the need for the AIDS AGREEMENT.

<H1>Dirty Words: The AIDS Fraud In Context</H1>

<ADDRESS>
By Tom DiFerdinando
</ADDRESS>

<P>
The AIDS fraud is now approaching the point of mass exposure and,
as such, is cause for both fear and excitement. Let me explain.
<P>
Dogma is an essential feature of authoritarian societies. The
unstated goal within these societies is to perpetuate themselves
and, unless one is able to consciously step outside these emotionally-anchored
structures and see them for what they are, one will unwittingly
participate in the perpetuation process. Inevitably, certain dissenting
individuals do indeed find it necessary to side-step the dogma
but in so doing occasionally find themselves inadvertantly stepping
outside the authoritarian structure itself.
<P>
Failing to recognize the full implications of their actions, they're
then stunned and bewildered at the flurry of abuse with which
their efforts are met. The protective machine has kicked furiously
into gear and, historically, what happens is that the central
voice that opposes a given dogma is then, in traditional threat-control
style, singled out and used by the dogma-bearers to dismiss anyone
and everything associated with that dissenting view. Even though
factual refutation (short of blatant fabrication) is never present,
the bulk of the population nearly always buys into it, failing
to see not only the pattern but their own responsibility in perpetuating
it. With AIDS, Peter Duesberg is the perfect example.
<P>
As Duesberg's redemption nears, there is cause for excitement.
The danger though is that when the story does break and the pendulum
swings, the above scenario will, once again, be not taken forward
but simply reversed: historically, when a lie or costly mistake
is exposed, a central voice from within the dogma is singled out
and used by the dogma-bearers to, in traditional damage-control
style, render themselves null and void of any responsibility.
The patsy is crucified along with any truly constructive insights
and the Gallos, Faucis, Broders, Baltimores, Essexs, Krims, Currans,
Kramers, Fischls and Volberdings are totally exonerated and eventually
completely forgotten.
<P>
What would otherwise act as a profound step toward a deeper medical
and social understanding will instead be disassociated from its
broader progressive context, reabsorbed into the dogma (which
gave rise to the problem in the first place), and used by the
&quot;authorities&quot; to once again reinforce their old destructive
propaganda. The cycle of non-change, having thus come full circle,
will have completed yet another turn in a much broader dwindling
spiral, and all that will have fundamentally changed is the outward
appearance of the next disaster.
<P>
This larger social spiral is the focus of this essay. In addition
to the vital task of exposing the entire crew responsible for
the AIDS debacle, there is the much more difficult, but also much
more essential and etiological context to be considered. The fraud
of AIDS, explosive and horrifying as it is, is still a minor,
albeit supremely more visible and accessible element of a much
larger and far more insidious global situation. And this is the
source of real hope and excitement. And here's why.
<P>
AIDS has brought within reach an authoritarian undercurrent of
negative beliefs, practices and social forces that for the longest
time have remained inaccessible to any individual or group seeking
to expose them. Intermittently rearing their ugly heads, they've
been mutually reinforced for decades, even centuries. Yet these
forces have remained sufficiently unrelated so that no one could
really get at any single one of them. With AIDS however, we have
an historically unique situation and thus an unprecedented opportunity.
<P>
By simply forcing accountability and exposing the HIV myth one
can, with one stroke, open up the Pandora's boxes of healthy sexuality;
iatrogenic genocide; poisoning of the ecosystem (and ourselves
along with it); oppressive social and familial conditions which
give rise to 1) both sex- and life-negative beliefs and attitudes,
2) over-population, 3) chronic promiscuity and 4) the attendant
drug and stimulant use required to lift the oppression on the
one hand and facilitate the promiscuity on the other; bureaucracies
designed to prevent vital information and discoveries that threaten
vested interests from reaching a broader public; environmental
abuse that contributes not only to famine and malnutrition - key
elements in African AIDS - but to wide spread global desert development
which even the alternative press has failed to catch onto.
<P>
With AIDS, not only has every one of these forces thoroughly intersected,
but they have pushed their way before the public in a broad display
of careless abandon never before seen. It is as if the authorities
want to be exposed for what they are once and for all. AIDS, as
we speak of it, is actually a focal point of, and springboard
of accessibility into, this much bigger &quot;AIDS&quot; that's
been developing for centuries. And what an opportunity it is!
<P>
Most all chronic problems, AIDS especially, can be looked at as
a function of a patriarchal world where our natural &quot;immunity&quot;
to personal, social and environmental irresponsibility has been
crippled, with the attendant result that all freedom of choice,
action and information is surrendered to medical and scientific
&quot;authorities&quot;. Although this broader problem is unlikely
to be solved in our lifetimes, AIDS can take us ane step closer
to the solution. Medically, it can act as a springboard for clarifying
the difference between a system based on disease management vs.
one based on health re-establishment; one on treating symptoms
vs. one on treating people; one where health is allowed to function
rather than forced to function. The same can be said of vital
social and environmental issues.
<P>
We're being terrorized by the HIV dogma: an historically unique
and deadly virus more virulent than any pathogen that's gone before;
it has a totally unpredictable latency period; it can infect you
and be re-transmitted asymptomatically; it can mutate so fast
and so effectively that even our own immune systems cannot contain
it. Anything goes and its totally unpredictable. This isn't science.
This is tyranny. It leaves people in a state of uncertain limbo
where there is no one to trust and no one to turn to, except for
the all-knowing Authorities.
<P>
Asymptomatic HIV positive people, human feeling-beings, are being
told to stop deluding themselves about health because the virus
will catch up with them and they will die. Note that a positive
&quot;AIDS test&quot; is psychologically toxic - and that the
&quot;authorities&quot; will exploit our deepest darkest fears
to ensure that this prophesy will be self-fulfilling.
<P>
AIDS is part of a much broader global crisis of love, freedom
and self-responsibility. And no pill will ever cure it. The monolithic
obstacle to any lasting solution is our authoritarian based societies
where mechanical (outside-in) approaches to biological (inside-out)
challenges predominate. Exposing the HIV lie within this context
could be an historically decisive step toward taking back the
reins of our lives. It could give a much needed boost to the positive
social forces long moving in this direction, yet quietly aching
for an opportunity to galvanize the gains and prepare the grounds
for deeper rooting and future positive developments.
<P>

<H1>The Hidden Agenda Behind HIV</H1>

<ADDRESS>
by Bryan J. Ellison
</ADDRESS>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Bryan has impressed us all in the past, but perhaps nothing is
so explosive as his revelation that the U.S. Public Health Movement
is full of doctrinaires, dogmatists, tyrants, and public policy
disasters. This piece is derived from some of the material in
his new book (with Dr. Duesberg), <CITE>Inventing the AIDS Virus</CITE>,
sold to Addison-Wesley (who chickened out at the last moment)
and then finally bought by St. Martin's, possibly due for release
in August. Can we get advance copies? Probably not yet. This article
is sure to generate strong feelings, both positive and negative
- let us hear your opinions!]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Despite all assurances to the contrary, the AIDS establishment
continues to fund only research on HIV. Peter Duesberg inadvertently
proved this blackout on all alternative research when he recently
submitted a grant proposal to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
The Institute's clinical director of AIDS research had personally
invited the proposal, which outlined a plan to test the long term
effects of nitrite inhalants, or &quot;poppers,&quot; on the immune
systems of mice. The answer came back in December: the anonymous
referees had not only turned it down, but had refused to give
the proposal more than a cursory review. Why does such a political
correctness continue to dominate the War on AIDS? After all, public
health officials cannot yet demonstrate they have saved any lives
from the syndrome, while its death toll rises steadily. The scientific
predictions have also failed miserably. In contrast to the predicted
spread of AIDS in the United States, the epidemic has remained
strictly confined to risk groups; nine of every ten AIDS cases
have been male, and ninety percent of all AIDS victims have been
linked to heavy drug use, whether intravenously or as &quot;fast
track&quot; homosexuals. Indeed, epidemiologists have yet to establish
that any epidemic at all has struck among blood transfusion recipients.
Even individual AIDS diseases prefer specific risk groups, such
as Kaposi's sarcoma among homosexuals and the near-absence of
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia among Africans, whose lungs all
contain the microbe. And some thirty-nine percent of AIDS diseases
in America have nothing to do with immune deficiency&Ntilde;witness
Kaposi's sarcoma, various lymphomas, wasting disease, and dementia,
for example. In short, AIDS is not an infectious disease.
<P>
The obsession with an &quot;AIDS virus&quot; has little to do
with science or medicine. Writing in Nature in 1991 (June 21),
British HIV researcher Robin Weiss and American CDC official Harold
Jaffe hinted at the real purpose in an attack on Peter Duesberg:
&quot;But if he and his supporters belittle 'safe sex,' would
have us abandon HIV screening of blood donations, and curtail
research into anti-HlV drugs and vaccines, then their message
is perilous.&quot; To whom? If AIDS is not infectious, such recommendations
would simply save the taxpayer money and anxiety.
<P>
But perhaps this is the point. A 1989 report by the National Research
Council more explicitly revealed the hidden agenda. Originally
sponsored by the Rockefeller and Russel Sage Foundations and then
funded by the Public Health Service, AIDS: Sexual Behavior and
Intravenous Drug Use laid out a plan for social engineering on
a massive scale&Ntilde;using AIDS as the excuse. &quot;The devastating
effect of an epidemic on a community can evoke strong political
and social responses,&quot; the committee duly noted. &quot;An
epidemic necessitates the rapid mobilization of the community
to counter the spread of illness and death&quot; (p. 373). The
power of such a method to force changes in cultural values is
based on careful manipulation of fear. &quot;Ideally, health promotion
mes-sages should heighten an individual's perceptions of threat
and his or her capacity to respond to that threat, thus modulating
the level of fear...What is not yet known is how to introduce
fear in the right way in a particular message intended for a particular
audience. Acquiring that knowledge will require planned variations
of AIDS education programs that are carefully executed and then
carefully evaluated,&quot; stated the committee coolly (pp. 267-8).
The report then identified one of the major targets of change&Ntilde;Judeo-Christian
moral values. &quot;Historically, there has been a strong social
reluctance in the United States to speak or write about sexuality
in explicit terms. Despite recent indications of greatly increased
tolerance for sexual explicitness in the media and literature,
that reluctance remains strong in much of the population; it is
particularly strong in instances that involve the education of
children and adolescents&quot; (p. 379). The fear of a supposedly
infectious AIDS epidemic, however, could be used to fix such problems.
As the report declared, &quot;The committee believes that, during
an epidemic, politeness is a social virtue that must take second
place to the protection of life&quot; (p. 379).
<P>
Other public health officials have been even more forthright.
As an officer of the Centers for Disease Control, Donald Francis
had in 1984 drafted the CDC's proposed AIDS strategy. In his 1992
retirement speech at the agency's Atlanta, Georgia headquarters,
Francis voiced the ambitions held by many of his fellow offi-cers
in describing &quot;the opportunity that the HIV epidemic provides
for public health&quot; (JAMA, 9-16-92). He stated in no uncertain
terms the radical nature of the plan:
<P>
&quot;The cloistered caution of the past needs to be discarded.
The climate and culture must he open ones where old ideas are
challenged. Those who desire the status quo should seek employment
elsewhere. The American HIV prevention program should be the place
where the best and the brightest come, where the action is, where
history is being made. This is the epidemic of the century, and
every qualified person should want to have a piece of the action.&quot;
<P>
The &quot;action&quot; described by Francis was a set of programs
that would, as he fully recognized, need strong political protection
from angry taxpayers and voters. For example, he bitterly attacked
public opposition to condom distribution programs, and called
for powerful legal measures to bypass parental discretion. &quot;The
ongoing controversies involving abstinence and condoms typify
the morass into which schools can fall,&quot; Francis complained.
If, in the opinion of those far more expert than I, schools cannot
be expected to provide such programs, then health departments
should take over, using as a justification their mandate to protect
the public's health.&quot;
<P>
Francis also included proposals for dealing with the AIDS risk
of intravenous drug use&Ntilde;including a call for &quot;prescription
of addicting drugs&quot; with Federal government sponsorship.
Even libertarians who advocate legalizing drugs would balk at
such notions, which would ultimately create a massive bureaucracy
encouraging drug use. &quot;Following a more enlightened model
for drug treatment, including prescribing heroin, would have dramatic
effects on HIV and could eliminate many of the dangerous illegal
activities surrounding drugs,&quot; he insisted, knowing that
only fear of the AIDS epidemic might make such proposals tolerable
to the public. Ignoring the toxic, and possibly AIDS inducing,
effects of drugs, Francis emphasized that &quot;In addition to
treatment, safe injection (!) must be stressed both for those
in treatment programs and those out of treatment. The provision
of sterile injection equipment for drug users should be the standard
of public health practice in the United States.&quot;
<P>
Most chillingly of all, Francis saw the possibilities in harnessing
other epidemics to advance similar agendas. As he put it, &quot;if
we establish new mechanisms to handle the HIV epidemic, [these]
can serve as models for other diseases.&quot;
<P>
The common denominator of these and similar plans is that they
originate with the Federal government's Public Health Service,
and especially from its frontline public health agency, the Centers
for Disease Control. Public perceptions often paint the CDC as
a minor office that gathers and publishes dull statistics on disease.
The truth is shockingly different. A sophisticated $2 billion-per-year
operation, the CDC employs a staff of thousands who see themselves
as having an activist mandate. They view epidemics as opportunities
for control and for imposing lifestyle changes on the population.
<P>
The CDC has traditionally specialized in contagious disease. Its
initials, in fact, originally stood for the Communicable Disease
Center, from its formation in 1946 until its name changed in 1970.
And therein lies its bias, for it tends to interpret almost any
epidemic as being infectious. Certainly the CDC has plenty of
raw material with which to work; each year at least one thousand
outbreaks, or &quot;clusters,&quot; of disease strike in the United
States&Ntilde;one every eight hours. These can range from flus
and pneumonias to closely-occurring cancers, but most outbreaks
involve no more than a handful of people each; since the polio
epidemic, none have posed serious threats to the general public.
However, by falsely labelling any arbitrarily chosen outbreak
as infectious and blaming it on a virus or other microbe, the
CDC can quickly generate public fear and political mobilization
behind almost any agenda.
<P>
The CDC has actually engineered a number of false alarms or misdirected
campaigns over the past four decades, neutralizing scientific
dissent and calmer voices when necessary. AIDS, though not the
first example, has now become the most successful epidemic by
far. Two powerful weapons in the agency's arsenal, both unknown
to the public at large, have made this possible: a semi-secret
wing of the CDC known as the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS),
and a quiet &quot;partnership&quot; program with private organizations.
<H2>The Epidemic Intelligence Service</H2>

<P>
Among epidemiologists, it is often half-jokingly referred to as
the &quot;medical CIA.&quot; Founded in 1951 by public health
professor Alexander Langmuir, the EIS was first designed to act
as an elite biological-warfare countermeasures unit of the CDC.
Langmuir was hired because he also served as one of the select
advisors to the Defense Department's chemical and biological warfare
program. The first EIS class of 21 recent medical or biological
graduates underwent several weeks of intense training at the CDC's
Atlanta headquarters, before being dispatched on their two-year
assignments on loan to various state or local health departments
around the country. They acted as the eyes and ears of the CDC,
carefully monitoring for any possible outbreak of war-induced
disease. While on their tours of duty, each EIS officer could
be sent elsewhere in the country on a 24 hour-a-day basis. In
case of war, the EIS would operate under any emergency powers
granted the CDC&Ntilde;potentially including quarantines, mass
immunizations, or other drastic measures.
<P>
In an article written for the American Journal of Public Health
(March, 1952), Langmuir made clear that membership in the EIS
did not end with the two year assignment, but was permanent. He
wrote that, &quot;As a result of their experience, many of these
officers may well remain in full-time epidemiology or other public
health pursuits at federal, state, or local levels. Some, no doubt,
will return to civilian, academic, or clinical practice, but in
the event of war they could be returned to active duty with the
Public Health Service and assigned to strategic areas to fulfill
the functions for which they were trained.&quot;
<P>
Every year since 1951 has seen a new crop of EIS recruits, some
classes over one hundred members in size. The nearly 2,000 alumni
have gone on to high positions in society, though rarely advertising
their afiliation. Indeed, the CDC has now made the EIS more secretive
than ever, having suppressed the public availability of the membership
directory since last year. Members can be found in the Surgeons
General's office and elsewhere in the Federal government, as well
as in the World Health Organization, state and local health departments,
universities, pharmaceutical companies, tax-exempt foundations,
hospitals, and even as staff writers, editors or news anchormen
for major newspapers, scientific journals, and television news
departments. In these positions, EIS alumni act not only as the
CDC's surveillance arm and emergency reserve, but also as seemingly
&quot;independant&quot; advocates for CDC policies.
<P>
In time, the fear of artificial disease epidemics faded. But Langmuir
and other top CDC offiicials had always held bigger plans for
the EIS. Langmuir, for example, an apostle of Planned Parenthood
founder Margaret Sanger, involved the EIS in the population control
movement by the 1960s. The CDC has gained most, however, from
EIS activities in natural disease epidemics, to which its &quot;disease
detectives&quot; have turned their attention.
<P>
The flu, being truly an infectious disease, often proved itself
most valuable to the CDC. Although the winter following the end
of World War I was the last time a flu epidemic caused widespread
death, the CDC has pushed annual flu vaccinations up to the present
day. At times, the agency has even rung the alarm over an impending
flu crisis, hoping to use memories of the 1918 epidemic to gain
emergency powers and impose mass vaccinations. By using such tactics
in 1957 over the Asian flu, the CDC managed to wrangle extra money
out of Congress to expand the EIS and crash-produce a vaccine.
But the flu season was already winding down by the time the vaccine
was ready, and the flu itself turned out to have been as mild
as in any other year.
<P>
By 1976, CDC director David Sencer wanted to try again, though
on a grander scale. After one soldier in Pennsylvania died of
a flu-relat-ed pnemonia in January, Sencer predicted that a pig-borne
human virus, nicknamed the &quot;swine flu&quot;, would soon devastate
the United States. Panicked with visions of impending doom, Congress
moved to authorize the CDC's immunization plan for every man,
woman, and child in the country. Unexpectedly, the legislation
suddenly stalled when the insurance companies underwriting the
vaccine discovered that it had seriously toxic side effects.
<P>
Sencer had to do something fast. He immediately set up a &quot;War
Room&quot; in Auditorium A at the CDC headquarters, and put the
EIS network on full alert to search for any disease outbreak that
might resemble the flu. Within weeks, the War Room received word
of a pneumonia cluster among men just returning home from the
Philadelphia convention of the American Legion. Several Philadelphia-based
EIS officers and alumni had detected the outbreak, and acted as
a fifth column that not only helped arrange an invitation for
the CDC to come in, but also took their orders from the arriving
team of CDC and EIS officers. Even the New York Times staff writer
sent to cover the story, Lawrence Altman, was himself an EIS alumnus.
<P>
The CDC team allowed media rumors to circulate that this Legionnaires'
disease was the beginning of the swine flu. Within days, Congress
decided to pass the vaccine bill. Only later did the CDC admit
that the legionnaires had not been infected by the flu virus,
too late to stop the immunization program. Some 50 million Americans
received the vaccine, leading to more than a thousand cases of
nerve damage and paralysis, dozens of deaths, and lawsuits awarding
almost $100 million in damages. In the ultimate irony, no swine
flu epidemic ever materialized; the only destruction left behind
by the phantom swine flu resulted from the CDC's vaccine.
<P>
The agency later blamed Legionnaires' disease on a common soil
bacterium, one that clearly fails Koch's postulates for causing
the disease and is therefore actually harmless. The legionnaires'
deaths are not so hard to understand, since the pneumonias struck
elderly men, many of whom had undergone kidney transplant operations,
and who had become particularly drunk during the Bicentennial
celebration - the classic risks for pneumonia. Thus &quot;Legionnaires'
disease&quot; is not an infectious condition, but merely a new
name for old pneumonias.
<P>
Using its EIS network, the CDC has applied similar tactics to
other outbreaks of disease. During the 1960s, for example, the
EIS helped fuel the National Institute of Health's growing Virus-Cancer
Program by tracking down every small cluster of leukemia cases,
trying to create the impression that some virus was responsible
for the cancer. Robert Gallo became one of the many scientists
so impressed with the CDC investigations that he devoted the rest
of his career to finding a human leukemia virus.
<P>
More recently, the CDC managed to have a team of EIS officers
invited into New Mexico to investigate a cluster of pneumonia
cases among Navajo Indians. By June of 1993, the CDC began insisting
tha tthe brief and relatively small outbreak was caused by a rat
fecal virus, the Hantavirus. But as a letter in the January 1
issue of the Lancet pointed out, most of the affected Navajos
actually tested negative for the virus. And unlike a contagious
disease, this pneumonia never spread beyond the first few dozen
victims. Again, the CDC's &quot;disease detectives&quot; used
a high-profile investigation to create media publicity and frighten
the general population, rather than troubling themselves with
the scientific method and its more boring answers.
<P>
Of all the epidemics mismanaged by the CDC, AIDS proved the most
spectacular in achieving political success. By 1981, the EIS had
so thoroughly penetrated the medical and public health institutions
in the United States that it could now detect even the smallest
and most loosely-connected &quot;clusters&quot; of diseases, no
matter how far apart the victims were in time and space. The original
AIDS cases were all found in homosexual men in the &quot;fast
track&quot; lifestyle - those having hundreds or thousands of
sexual contacts and using enormous amounts of hard drugs to make
such promiscuous activity possible. For the CDC, the trick was
to make the illness seem contagious; a simple drug-induced epidemic
among homosexuals would hardly have frightened the public, nor
have allowed the CDC to accomplish its radical public health agenda.
<P>
The epidemic officially began in 1980 after Michael Gottlieb,
a new immunologist at the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles,
decided to test the brand new T cell-counting technology. He put
out an informal request to fellow physicians to refer cases of
immune deficiency to him. Over the next several months, colleagues
sent him four such cases, all male homosexuals with Pneumocystis
carinii pneumonia. Sensing that the CDC might take an interest,
Gottlieb called active EIS officer Wayne Shandera in the Los Angeles
health department. Shandera had heard an isolated report of a
fifth homosexual with the same problem, and compiled a report
for the CDC.
<P>
Ordinarily, each of the five cases would have been seen by separate
doctors, leaving nothing to suggest the word &quot;epidemic&quot;
to anyone. But having a pre-positioned EIS agent like Shandera
certainly helped the CDC gather such cases together as a potential
cluster. Shandera's report fell on the desk of James Curran, an
official in the CDC's veneral diseases division; the 1987 book
And The Band Played On records that Curran wrote &quot;Hot stuff.
Hot stuff.&quot; on the report (p. 67). He had the agency publish
it immediately.
<P>
By the time the report appeared on June 5, 1981, Curran was already
organizing a special Kaposi's Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections
(KSOI) task force to lead an investigation of the five-victim
epidemic. EIS members Harold Jaffe and Mary Guinan, also from
the venereal diseases division, helped run the task force. The
first order of business was to find as many similar patients as
possible, thereby causing the epidemic to &quot;grow.&quot; Next
was to explain the syndrome; to the CDC, this meant trying to
find an infectious agent. This would be no simple task, since
essentially all of the first fifty cases admitted to heavy use
of poppers, a drug preferred by homosexuals as a means of facilitating
anal intercourse. Even if this toxic drug presented itself as
the obvious explanation, the CDC investigators had no intention
of letting the evidence interfere. According to historian Elizabeth
Etheridge, &quot;While many of the patients were routine users
of amyl nitrites or 'poppers,' no one in the KSOI task force believed
the disease was a toxicological problem&quot; (Sentinel for Health,
1992, p. 326).
<P>
So the EIS was activated to prove AIDS infectious. EIS officer
David Auerbach and others confirmed that these extremely promiscuous
homosexuals were often linked to one another through long chains
of sexual encounters. To prove that AIDS was &quot;spreading&quot;
to other people, other officers scoured hospitals to find heroin
addicts with opportunistic infections, and blamed their needle-sharing
rather than the heroin use, itself a classic risk factor for pneumonias
and other illnesses. Bruce Evatt and Dale Lawrence, both members
of the EIS, discovered one hemophiliac in Colorado with an opportunistic
pneumonia as a side effect of internal bleeding, but rediagnosed
the patient as an AIDS case. Even Haitians in Florida and Haiti
were interviewed by EIS officer Harry Haverkos, who renamed their
endemic tuberculosis as AIDS.
<P>
Not understanding the loaded nature of such investigations, the
outside world completely bought the CDC line. Soon the race was
on for scientific researchers to find the guilty virus. But this
search, too, had been rigged. Donald Francis, an EIS member himself
since 1971, decided just eleven days after the original Shandera
report that the syndrome should be blamed on a retrovirus-with
a latent period, no less. Using his various contacts in the retrovirus
field, Francis spent the next two years pushing Robert Gallo to
isolate a new retrovirus. Eventually Gallo did take an interest,
and claimed credit for finding HIV.
<P>
With his April 23, 1984, press conference, Gallo completed the
crusade begun by the CDC and its EIS. As the tapes rolled and
the cameras flashed, Gallo and Health and Human Services Secretary
Margaret Heckler launched the nation into a War on AIDS. Few people
knew the true story behind the announcement, or of the political
agenda that Don Francis and others were preparing to foist on
the American people.
<H2>The Partnership Program</H2>

<P>
The CDC's second major weapon for mobilizing public support lay
in its assistance programs for private organizations. By funding
or otherwise supporting groups not affiliated with the CDC, the
agency could create apparently spontaneous mass movements. Spokesmen
claiming to represent various communities could all simultaneously
advocate policies identical to those of the CDC, while allowing
the agency to remain quietly in the background and avoid direct
criticism.
<P>
In 1984, the CDC began forming &quot;partner-ships,&quot; based
on &quot;cooperative agreements,&quot; with large numbers of &quot;community
based organizations,&quot; for the purpose of AIDS &quot;education&quot;
(read: indoctrination). At first the funding was channeled through
the United States Conference of Mayors, which dispersed the money
to a growing network of AIDS activist groups. By 1985, the CDC
was giving over $1 million to state governments, influencing their
response to AIDS.
<P>
After 1986, the money began flowing freely, and the CDC's corresponding
influence expanded quickly. The American Red Cross alone received
over $19 million from 1988 to 1991, cementing CDC control among
medical institutions. Millions more were targeted to such groups
as the American Medical Association, the National Association
of People with AIDS (which operates as a coordinating center for
much of the AIDS activist and gay rights movements), Americans
for a Sound AIDS Policy (which generates CDC-approved materials
for evangelical Christians), the National Education Association
(the major teachers' union), the National PTA, the National Association
of Broadcasters (which represents most television and radio stations
and their networks), the National Conference of State Legislatures,
and dozens of others. Even such groups as the National Urban League,
the National Council of La Raza, and the Center for Population
Options receive CDC grants and other technical aid. Many specifically
AlDS-related groups actually depend on CDC money for their very
existence.
<P>
Naturally, the CDC has established mechanisms for ensuring that
its money and other aids are used for the intended purposes. Organizations
wishing to receive grants must not only file applications, but
are pre-screened by having to send representatives to CDC workshops
on how to apply. These meetings allow the CDC to meet and judge
applicants directly. Furthermore, any organization receiving aid
winds up having CDC supervision of its AlDS-related &quot;educational&quot;
activities.
<P>
It is little wonder there is so much political pressure, from
all sides, to defend both the virus-AIDS hypothesis and the CDC's
public health agenda.
<P>
As with so many non-contagious diseases in the past, the CDC has
persuaded the public that AIDS is infectious. Thus the taxpayer
is manipulated with fear to acquiesce to the radical measures
being pushed by the agency. Where &quot;safe sex&quot; programs,
sterile needle exchanges, Federal subsidies of drug addiction,
and other CDC proposals would normally be thrown out&Ntilde;along
with the officials who proposed them&Ntilde;many Americans suspend
judgment.
<P>
Most people do not yet realize that the entire campaign has been
orchestrated mostly by a single agency of the Federal govemment,
rather than being a spontaneous decision by independent experts
and activists. As intended, the CDC has been able to mobilize
the scientists, the medical institutions, political bodies, the
news media, and a bewildering array of AIDS organizations behind
its hidden agenda. All such groups will lose their credibility
once the public discovers the real source of the campaign, and
honest skepticism will spread faster than AIDS itself.
<P>
Signs of imminent change are appearing. The CDC's public health
measures&Ntilde;condoms, sterile needles, contact tracing, and
the like&Ntilde;have failed to prevent the steady growth of AIDS.
As this bad advice is recognized for what it is, more voices are
joining the chorus of dissent against the HIV-AIDS hypothesis.
The CDC may soon have to hold HIV research meetings all by itself.
<P>
That is, if Congress doesn't abolish thc CDC first.

<H1>HIV: Reality or Artefact?</H1>

<ADDRESS>
by Dr. Stefan Lanka
</ADDRESS>

<P>
For the past 10 years or so it has been the accepted wisdom that
the human immuno-deficiency virus, HIV, causes AIDS. It supposedly
occurs in many body fluids and, its transmission - especially
in semen and blood - to a new host, triggers a slow but inexorable
progression to AIDS and ultimately death. To infect another cell,
HIV must at some stage in its life cycle exist as a separate and
identifiable entity.
<P>
What has been ignored and kept from public awareness is that there
has never been a workable HIV test, and that the definition of
'positive' has always changed according to the views of the different
organizations dealing with it, it has changed according to the
kind of tests used, and it has changed from laboratory to laboratory
performing the tests:
<P>
&quot;..lts techniques have not been standardized, and the magnitude
and consequences of interlaboratory variations have not been measured.
Its results require interpretation, and the criteria for this
interpretation vary not only from laboratory to laboratory but
also from month to month.&quot; <A HREF="#ref1">(1)</A> 
<P>
The dispute over who discovered HIV <A HREF="#ref2">(2)</A> was
a distraction from the question of whether the virus actually
exists at all. The public was impressed that if a President and
a Prime Minister <A HREF="#ref3">(3)</A> had to meet to resolve
attribution, then the thing they were negotiating about must be
real.
<P>
In 1993 a research group from Perth, Australia succeeded in publishing
a paper on the HIV test. <A HREF="#ref4">(4)</A> Since then anybody
could have read for him or herself that no AIDS test could ever
work, because HIV has never been isolated nor even shown to exist.
Since AIDS research and the media have largely ignored any critique
of HIV=AIDS, especially the essential question of whether HIV
really does exist, it is time to call again for a reappraisal
of the whole HIV/AIDS hypothesis. In going back to the origins
of HIV virology and telling the HIV story, a view will be presented
which will make clear that HIV itself, the very object of this
Manhattan Project of modern medicine, AIDS research, does not
exist. <A HREF="#ref5">(5)</A> 
<H2>A LITTLE VIROLOGY</H2>

<P>
Viruses are essentially just packages of genetic information enclosed
in a coat which consists of proteins. They can reproduce themselves
only by infecting a suitable host cell and appropriating the chemical
machinery they find there. The proteins making up the viruses
are characteristic for each species of virus. Apart from enveloping
and transporting the genetic information intact, the composition
of proteins for a given virus results in a specific shape for
the virus particle.
<P>
This much is generally known. Less well-known is the existence
of other particles which look like viruses but aren't, and are
nonchalantly referred to as &quot;virus-like&quot; particles.
Such particles are far from rare, found, for example, always in
placentas, and very frequently in the artificial environment of
laboratory cell cultures. They have served to muddy the waters
considerably as far as AIDS research is concerned, because particles
just like these have been called HIV. To date, none of these has
been characterized and shown to exist as an entity which one many
justifiably call a virus.
<H2>ONE ROOT OF THE BELIEF IN THE AIDS VIRUS</H2>

<P>
In classical theory DNA encodes the genetic material of heredity,
which is then transcribed into messenger RNA which in turn specifies
the assembly of amino-acids to construct the proteins of all living
beings. In 1970 an enzyme (biological catalyst) was discovered
in extracts of certain cells which was capable of converting a
molecule of RNA into DNA. This was a revolutionary discovery because
it overturned a fundamental tenet of molecular genetics, namely,
that the flow of information was strictly one-way and never reversed.
It had hitherto always been thought that DNA was transcribed (converted)
into messenger RNA and that the reverse process from RNA to DNA
was impossible. The enzyme responsible became known as reverse
transcriptase <A HREF="#ref6">(6)</A> and a lot of new myths arose.
<H2>AN ERROR OF THE PAST: CANCER CAUSED BY VIRUSES.</H2>

<P>
It was believed that the new enzyme was a marker for a virus because
the cells in which it was detected, and which were used to study
cancer <A HREF="#ref7">(7)</A>, were thought to have become cancerous
through being infected by a virus. New to the idea of cancer viruses
<A HREF="#ref8">(8)</A> was that the nucleic acid, when in the
form of RNA, could be converted into DNA by the enzyme, thus providing
a mechanism for viral nucleic acid to be inserted anywhere in
the chromosome of the cells. <A HREF="#ref9">(9)</A> These &quot;new&quot;
viruses became known as retroviruses. <A HREF="#ref10">(10)</A>
The insertion of certain retroviral genes was thought to trigger
cancer. The idea that these postulated viruses caused cancer quickly
became &quot;hot news&quot; the world over, but did not survive
investigation <A HREF="#ref11">(11)</A> and other explanations
were sought. <A HREF="#ref12">(12)</A> 
<P>
The theory did not predict or explain the dramatic increase in
cancer cases, cancer could not be shown to be transmissible, nor
could it suggest any remedy in the form of a vaccine. <A HREF="#ref13">(13)</A>
Interestingly, the spread of cancer viruses was blamed on homosexuals,
prostitutes, and black people, just as AIDS came to be 13 years
later. <A HREF="#ref14">(14)</A> 
<P>
Whenever and wherever reverse transcriptase activity was detected
it was rashly assumed that retroviruses were at work. This turned
out to be a grave error, because it was later found that the enzyme
occurred in all living matter, proving that reverse transcrip
tase activity had nothing to do with retroviruses per se. <A HREF="#ref15">(15)</A>

<H2>REPETITIVE ELEMENTS</H2>

<P>
Further research showed that at least 10% of mammalian DNA was
composed of repetitive sequences which were referred to as &quot;non-sense
genes,&quot; parts of which, nonetheless, were described as &quot;retroviral
genes.&quot; They exist in their hundreds if not thousands. Some
of them can even replicate independently and jump within and between
chromosomes, and for this reason became known as retrotransposons.
In the laboratory they can be made to migrate, and when this happens
reverse transcriptase is invariably detected, which under lines
the fact that reverse transcriptase activity has nothing to do
with retroviruses as such. <A HREF="#ref16">(16)</A> 
<H2>LAV, HTLV-III, HIV AND ALL THAT</H2>

<P>
Because all this was already well known in 1983 it is incomprehensible
that Francoise Barre-Sinoussi, a member of Montagnier's group,
as well as Gallo's group itself in 1984, claimed to have discovered
a new virus, when all they did was to demonstrate reverse transcriptase
activity, and to publish photographs of cellular particles without
proof that they were viruses. They could neither isolate them
nor show that they were responsible for creat ing the observed
reverse transcriptase activity, nor the tissue abnormalities in
which they were observed. <A HREF="#ref17">(17)</A> They concluded:
&quot;the role of the virus in the aetiology of AIDS remains to
be determined&quot;. <A HREF="#ref18">(18)</A> 
<H2>WHAT MAKES A VIRUS NEW?</H2>

<P>
The isolation and purification of a real virus is a straightforward
matter because unlike cells, viruses of one species are always
of the same size and shape, and can be readily separated from
other cell components by standard techniques. A control experiment
is to try an isolation with putative non-infected material in
exactly the same way as the supposedly infected material. Nothing
should be isolated in this case.
<P>
To identify a virus definitively, a first and simple step is to
photograph isolated particles of it in an electron microscope,
and they must look like the viral particles observed in cells,
body fluids or cell cultures to distinguish them from other cellular
particles which look like viruses, but are not. Proteins making
up the viral coat must then be separated from each other and photographed.
This produces a pattern which is characteristic of the species
of virus. A similar separation and identification procedure must
be gone through for the DNA or RNA of the virus. Only after the
viral proteins and nucleic acid components have been properly
identified is it legitimate to speak of a new virus.
<H2>NO EVIDENCE FOR THE EXISTENCE OF HIV</H2>

<P>
Such evidence has up till now never been produced for HIV. No
photograph of an isolated HIV particle has ever been published
nor of any of its proteins or nucleic acids. No control
<P>
experiments as mentioned above have been published to date. What
has been shown are photographs of virus-like particles in cell
cultures, but none of isolated viruses, let alone of a structure
within the human body having the shape ascribed to HIV. What the
whole world has seen are models representing HIV with dish aerials,
said to be receptors with which the virus attaches itself to cells.
<P>
The existence of HIV is inferred from an antibody test, but how
this is supposed to work, when the virus has never been shown
to exist and obtained free of cellular contaminants remains a
mystery.
<H2>THE AIDS TEST</H2>

<P>
Let us recall that the AIDS test is supposed to detect antibodies
produced by the immune system in response to infection by the
virus. This is routinely done by layering proteins ostensibly
from the virus in the wells of a plastic rack and adding blood
serum to be tested to each. If antibodies are present, they bind
to the proteins, and when this happens sophisticated staining
procedures can make this visible. But, because no proteins which
are viral and free from contaminants have ever been obtained,
one cannot be sure what the antibodies are that bind to the proteins.
<P>
This is the crux of the problem facing all HIV (AIDS) tests. The
inability to isolate the virus, and to obtain proteins from it
which are free from proteins derived from the cells in which the
alleged virus is grown, reduces the evidence for the existence
of HIV using antibodies to arguing in circles.
<H2>WHY NO HIV TEST IS EVER ABLE TO WORK</H2>

<P>
It is consequently quite illogical to claim that a positive test
results from prior contact with the virus. <A HREF="#ref19">(19)</A>
Because various ill-characterized proteins are involved, every
test kit manufacturer applies his own arbitrary criteria, and
no two kits ever give the same result. It makes no difference
that learned committees set standards to decide which tests should
be regarded as &quot;positive&quot; and which not, because this
skirts around the problem, namely, to what are antibod ies actually
being detected in the AIDS test? It is of no help that nowadays
&quot;second&quot; and &quot;third&quot; generation tests exist
using synthetic proteins which give greater consistency and comparability,
because only by an unscientific stretch of the imagination are
they viral proteins!
<P>
Neither fudging the true identity of the proteins, nor advocating
two kinds of test - reassuringly but mistakenly described as &quot;search&quot;
and &quot;confirmatory&quot; tests - resolves this difficulty.
<P>
The ELISA test is used to screen for antibodies, which is &quot;confirmed&quot;
by the more specific Western Blot. The dilemma cannot be stated
more poignantly than by quoting from the leaflet accompanying
one such test kit
<P>
&quot;The test for the existence of antibodies against AlDS-associated
virus is not diagnostic for AIDS and AIDS-like diseases. Negative
test results do not exclude the possibility of contact or infection
with the AlDS-associated virus. Positive test results do not prove
that someone has an AIDS or pre-AlDS disease status nor that he
will acquire it.&quot; <A HREF="#ref20">(20)</A> Quite.
<H2>THE DIRECT PROOF OF HIV</H2>

<P>
Some HIV researchers have tried to circumvent the problem by pointing
to something called &quot;direct&quot; evidence for the virus.
All that this meant, though, was arbitrarily selecting a protein
of a certain size which happened to coincide with that shown in
HIV molecules. The delusion of such &quot;evidence&quot; was illustrated
when the protein later turned out to be of human origin! <A HREF="#ref21">(21)</A>

<P>
HOW THE GENETIC INFORMATION OF HIV WAS MANUFACTURED THROUGH...
Despite this deplorable state of affairs, the majority of AIDS
researchers still cling to the authenticity of HIV, because a
genetic sequence for it has been published. Moreover, genetic
procedures now exist, which, unlike antibody tests, attempt to
identify the presence of HIV more or less immediately, instead
of only weeks later when antibodies are formed. The fact that
the genetic tests (PCR) <A HREF="#ref22">(22)</A> do not give
the same results as the antibody tests is simply ignored.
<P>
Since no virus has been isolated, it follows that no nucleic acid
has been isolated from it either. Complicated procedures are even
so described in the literature, at the end of which something
is produced which is called the nucleic acid of HIV. <A HREF="#ref23">(23)</A>

<H2>...A TEST TUBE</H2>

<P>
HIV and its DNA can allegedly be made by the &quot;bucketful&quot;,
<A HREF="#ref24">(24)</A> but under very surprising conditions
which, inter alia, entail the use of extracts from plants and
other oxidizing chemicals, which could not possibly exist in vivo.
Immortalized cell lines devised (and later patented) by the Montagnier
and Gallo groups are co-cultured with extracts from human cells
or the cells themselves. At the end of it all HIV itself is not
actually obtained - only reverse transcriptase activity is shown
to occur - which is taken to imply that the DNA that is found
must have been viral in origin.
<P>
The real explanation of what hap pens is as follows. In the mixture
of cell cultures and stressed human cells, RNA and reverse transcriptase
come to be produced in large amounts, because the cells have been
specially selected and treated to do this. The RNA is transcribed
into DNA by reverse transcriptase, and long pieces of DNA are
produced which are said to be viral DNA. In fact they are composed
of unrelated pieces of expressed cellular RNA, transcribed into
DNA and linked together by a process of &quot;template switching&quot;
(a well-characterized property of reverse transcriptase). <A HREF="#ref25">(25)</A>
This misleads ordinary researchers into believing that they have
actually produced viral DNA.
<P>
It is said that this linear DNA is the free or the non-integrated
form of HIV, which furthermore is said to be a unique feature
of HIV because a lot of detectable free linear DNA has not been
suggested in any other models of retroviruses.
<H2>...AND A SELECTING PROCESS</H2>

<P>
The resulting pieces of DNA are necessarily both shorter and longer
that the &quot;correct&quot; length of HIV. Pieces corresponding
to the &quot;correct&quot; length of HIV must be selected for
size, because otherwise the purported DNA preparation would be
a mixture of various lengths, which would violate a cardinal rule
of virology - that all nucleic acid of a particular virus be identical
in size.
<H2>...AND A DETECTING PROCESS</H2>

<P>
Having artificially prepared DNA pieces of uniform length, they
are still not ready for presentation, because they consist of
a mixture of all kinds of RNA fragments transcribed into DNA and
thus cannot be shown to represent unique viral DNA. Accordingly,
the mixture is subjected to a kind of lock-and-key detection process
called hybridization, whereby pieces of DNA are detected which
complement more or less a probe of that which it is desired to
be shown to have been prepared.
<H2>...AND CHOOSING A DESIRED PROBE</H2>

<P>
Since no DNA from HIV existed to hybridize with the prepared DNA,
Gallo and Montagnier simply used stretches of DNA from what they
said was specific to HTLV-I, a retrovirus Gallo had earlier claimed
to have discovered, and which they deemed suitable for this purpose.
The DNA detected in this way was replicated and certain stretches
of it cloned and declared to be the DNA of HTLV-III (later to
be called HIV).
<P>
To summarize, the purpose of the exercise is to grow HIV, but
it actually produces a mixture of different lengths of DNA, contrary
to theory which says they should all be identical, and no virus
at all. It is them claimed that the &quot;correct&quot; DNA has
been prepared by finding certain strands in this heterogeneous
mix of hybridizing them with a HTLV-I DNA probe whose sequence
is known and defined to be similar to HIV. However, non-hybridizing
strands of DNA should not be there at all, and the fact that they
are, proves that a rag-bag of endogenous DNA from the pool of
repetitive elements has been prepared, without any indication
of what it is made up of.
<P>
It follows that &quot;HIV&quot; DNA must just be a laboratory
artefact constructed to a pre-conceived idea of what retroviral
DNA should be, and this assessment does not even raise the question
why no virus can be obtained, whatever the experimental conditions.
<H2>GALLO AND MONTAGNIER'S CLONED HIV DNA</H2>

<P>
One cannot help asking why no one had not long ago spotted the
flaw in the technique employed by the Gallo and Montagnier groups.
After defining some segments of DNA to be &quot;HIV&quot;-specific,
every researcher in the field worked exclusively with short cloned
sequences (never the whole strand) on the reasonable assumption
that the original characterization has been correctly performed.
>From the isolation and identification procedure described above,
it follows that the resultant sequences vary widely from one preparation
to the next, which sequence analysts misinterpreted as the legendary
capacity of HIV to mutate. A computer simulated phlyogenetic tree
was constructed, which established precisely what its designer
sought to prove. <A HREF="#ref26">(26)</A> 
<H2>SOME HISTORY (I)</H2>

<P>
Perhaps one reason for this calamitous state of affairs is that
HTLV-III was presented to the world as the cause of AIDS at a
historic press conference on April 23, 1994 (a patent for an antibody
test was applied for on the same day!), instead of making the
evidence for it available beforehand, as correct science demands.
The unholy hurry may be explained through the disagreement between
the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) which favored the French idea of the virus at the time.
This opinion was published the very day before in a lengthy front
page article in the New York Times in which the head of the CDC
was quoted as saying that the French virus was the cause of AIDS.
<A HREF="#ref27">(27)</A> 
<H2>SOME HISTORY (II)</H2>

<P>
Even so, one must admire Gallo's audacity, because using a similar
technique he claimed in 1975 to have discovered the first human
retrovirus (HL23), but which turned out to be nothing more than
pieces of DNA from three different sources of contamination. <A HREF="#ref28">(28)</A>
Nowadays, even an undergraduate would know that if you added DNA
to a cell culture, part of the DNA would be incorporated into
the cells without any virus being involved.
<H2>WHAT DOES THE AIDS TEST ACTUALLY TEST FOR?</H2>

<P>
Since &quot;HIV&quot; has been shown to be a laboratory artefact
it must be assumed that, when not just cross-reacting with other
known antibodies, the &quot;AIDS&quot; test detects antibodies
against proteins produced in the procedure itself. They must be
of human origin because the cells used originated from leukemia
patients. Test positivity, logically, results from immunological
contact with them. However, since positivity actually correlates
with otherwise unrelated factors such as rheumatism and sun bathing,
no specificity can be ascribed to the test. <A HREF="#ref29">(29)</A>
Whether antibody positivity really correlates with disease as
is commonly supposed, remains to be determined by a critical re-evaluation
of the data. Condoms, therefore, serve only to protect against
venereal diseases and as contraceptives, and worse, lull the user
into a false sense of security by ignoring the real dangers he
may be exposing himself to.
<H2>REDIRECTION OF AIDS RESEARCH</H2>

<P>
AIDS research is therefore back at square one and not at Basic
Science as suggested elsewhere. <A HREF="#ref30">(30)</A> The
main players have since 1993 begun to slink off, arguing that
the virus having mutated so much is now no longer detectable.
AIDS has therefore to be explained &quot;in the absence of further
whole virus&quot;. <A HREF="#ref31">(31)</A> Apart from the shortcomings
of the antibody test, other misconceptions such as T-cell counting
exist, which mean that the whole concept of AIDS needs to be completely
revised. <A HREF="#ref32">(32)</A> It must be shown that there
is any point in renaming a collection of known diseases as AIDS,
just because someone is positive in the antibody or genetic (PCR)
tests. Leaving HIV out of the picture explains <A HREF="#ref37">(37)</A>
why the epidemiological projections, which years ago had forecast
a world-wide epidemic, have been a complete failure. Africa in
1986 was held up as a dire warning of what would befall the Western
world. There AIDS is diagnosed by a com bination of clinical conditions
<A HREF="#ref33">(33)</A> such as chronic fevers, diarrheas, coughs
and weight loss, all symptoms of the diseases of poverty, without
testing for HIV antibodies. <A HREF="#ref34">(34)</A> It should
hardly come as a surprise that an entirely different definition
produces a dif ferent outcome. Finally, the effect of a positive
test result on mental and physical health needs to be considered
and investigated. <A HREF="#ref35">(35)</A> 
<H2>ANTI-VIRALS</H2>

<P>
Whatever happens, the use of AZT and other &quot;anti-virals&quot;
which are supposed to target HIV replica tion, but actually kill
cells indiscrim inately (and ultimately the whole body), must
be stopped immediately. It is especially distressing to note that
AZT and its analogues preferentially attack those cells which
divide most rapidly, namely, cells in the intestines causing diarrhea
and malabsorp tion of food, and in bone marrow, ironically, the
primary pro duction site for cells of the immune system. <A HREF="#ref36">(36)</A>

<H2>THE PEOPLE WHO NEED OUR HELP</H2>

<P>
The most important and delicate task is to convince anti body
test positives that their result is not a death sentence, to be
generally supportive of them, to assuage their anxiety, and to
help them understand that with appropriate treatment of any specific
disease, they have a good chance to retain or regain their health.
The large number of long-term positives, whose condition cannot
be explained by conventional AIDS theory, as well as the phenomenon
of sero-reversion (return to negative test status), pro vide eloquent
testimony to this. HIV/AIDS researchers and health officials are
herewith called upon to debate the whole subject of HIV/AIDS openly
and humanely, and to recognize the mistake of assuming that immune
deficiency was acquired by an infectious agent.
<H2>THE FUTURE</H2>

<P>
To address the many ills of our age, it is essential to regain
over our bodies the proper autonomy which we have ceded to misguided
&quot;experts&quot;.
<P>
If we refuse to learn what has happened in AIDS research and related
developments, then worse is on the way, some of it is, indeed
here already. <A HREF="#ref38">(38)</A> An early genetics agenda
dates back to the 1860's, <A HREF="#ref39">(39)</A> and in its
contemporary form is a primitive genetic determinism based on
genetic sequence analysis, which holds out the prospect of manipulating,
at least, defective genes. This is just wishful thinking: <A HREF="#ref40">(40)</A>
all models of genetics and associated technologies, such as genome
therapy, are based on a one-dimensional, static model which is
an egregious over-simplification of the truth. The expectation
of success in this field is based on the simplistic model devised
by Gregor Mendel which even he could only make work by ignoring
and discarding data which did not fit. <A HREF="#ref41">(41)</A>

22) Just how little confidence is placed in the validity of such
tests is revealed by the caveats in the leaflet accompanying one
of them:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The Amplicor HIV-I PCR test has been tested using whole
blood specimens only. Performance with other specimens has not
been evaluated and may result in false negative or false positive
results...&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Detection of HIV-I may be dependent on the amount of proviral
DNA in the specimen. This may be affected by specimen collection
methods and patient factors such as age, disease status and risk
factors etc. As in any diagnostic test, results from Amplicor
HIV-I test should be interpreted with consideration of clinical
and laboratory findings.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It will become clear later why whole blood rather than serum is
used for this test, all the more so as the purpose of the test
is to detect transmissable virus particles which should not have
anything to do with the presence or absence of blood cells. This
is all the more significant since a major form of HIV transmission
is supposed to be via Factor Vlll given to hemophiliacs, where
blood cells are absent. The implication is that without blood
cells no &quot;viral&quot; DNA would be detected!<A NAME="ref23"></A>

<H1>Unmasking HIV</H1>

<ADDRESS>
By Michael Ellner and Tom DiFerdinando* 
</ADDRESS>

<P>
Since 1982 we have worked and networked with organizations around
the world who, along with HEAL, were counseling and studying tens
of thousands of people with AIDS related fears and conditions.
Among the individuals with &quot;full-blown AIDS&quot; who we
have seen recover their health, and among the many thousands more
we have seen stay healthy if at risk, two striking features are
observed to be universally present in determining who lives and
who dies.
<P>
One is that these groups, with the occasional exception of short
term &quot;heroic&quot; use of conventional medicine, used only
non-toxic &quot;alternative&quot; approaches to their health and
healing. But the second factor has proved to be much more subtle
and much more critical.
<H2>Escaping the AIDS Zone</H2>

<P>
Over the years we had long observed a very interesting and disturbing
phenomenon. On the one hand, we had witnessed individuals who
had used non-toxic therapies for their health challenges, health
challenges that were comparable to the health challenges of others
who had recovered, but who themselves just got sicker and sicker
and eventually died, regardless of how well they seemed to take
care of themselves.
<P>
On the other hand, we saw individuals who were healthy and &quot;at
risk&quot;, who understood the AIDS fraud, talked the talk real
good, knew all the scientific studies and observed first hand
what happened to those who took the recommended treatments. These
&quot;enlightened&quot; individuals, as long as they remained
healthy, seemed confident and free. But then with the onset of
a simple cold, or a flu, or simply diarrhea, frightened, they
suddenly ran to the doctors, took the recommended treatments,
got sicker and died. What was going on here?
<P>
For the sake of completeness we wanted to address this phenomenon
and found that all things being equal, the critical difference
between who lived and who died was whether or not one succeeded
in escaping what we call the AIDS Zone.
<H2>The AIDS Zone</H2>

<P>
You've just tested HIV antibody positive and suddenly you're in
the AIDS Zone. Everywhere you turn you are programmed to get sick
and die. Your health care providers won't look you in the eye,
your friends offer an awkward smile and, when you explain to them
that except for your anxiety about the test result you don't really
feel sick, they compassionately treat you like you're demented
or in denial.
<P>
Before you know it a fever, some night sweats, diarrhea, even
acne you've had before all suddenly seem life threatening. Flu-like
symptoms have got to be the unbearable proof that the end is at
hand. And then the medications kick in. Now, feeling deathly ill,
the fear and desperation which had already reached critical levels
skyrocket, the fatal prognosis becomes real, and you start wishing
you were dead.
<P>
No matter how hard you try you're unable to think or talk about
anything else but the terror, doom and gloom. So even your loved
ones reach their breaking points and begin to distance themselves.
You find yourself alone and more frightened than you've ever been
before. Nothing makes sense anymore. You keep seeing all those
&quot;nice&quot; doctors burying their dead patients. After an
opportunistic disease or two, every second of every day feels
overwhelming and you start feeling that life itself is the disease
and death is the cure.
<H2>Psychospiritual Health</H2>

<P>
This is a working model of &quot;HIV&quot; self-hypnosis. Driven
by a &quot;crisis mentality&quot;, it is an unconscious effort
to push preexisting and unresolved psychospiritual tensions to
a head. In spite of their healing actions and intentions, these
people always sabotage their health because the real underlying
issues are never addressed. And the subliminal justification for
it, reinforced everywhere they go, is that AIDS is always fatal
and nothing can be done.
<P>
But make no mistake about it. Not only is HIV harmless, its only
in the AIDS Zone that AIDS is always fatal! Aside from the genuine
factors of malnutrition and chemical toxification, it is not HIV
but the deadly hex of HIV that is both necessary and sufficient
to draw people into the Zone.
<P>
So what is this hex? Why are people susceptible to it? What we
intend to demonstrate is that 1) HIV is not the source of the
terror, hopelessness and helplessness associated with it, that
it is instead merely a trigger, successfully forcing to a head
the emotional tension of a preexisting and long-standing psychospiritual
healing crisis, 2) that this healing crisis is both operating
and preexistent not only within antibody positive individuals
but within a substantial portion of the general population, and
3) that as human beings, we're naturally outside the Zone but
artificially drawn into it, day by day, by authoritarian social
conditions which, by their very nature, actively work to undermine
one's capacity for the pleasure, hope and responsible freedom
in life that are the hallmark of psychospiritual health.
<P>
Taken together, these points will dramatically illustrate the
fact that, along with holistic approaches, the second and more
critical element in recovering one's health or staying healthy
if at risk is escaping the AIDS Zone. And that until one is aware
of this fact, the incapacitating despair that otherwise results
will remain the Zone's central anchoring force.
<H2>I. Two Cosmic Truths</H2>

<P>
The true essence of spirituality is expressed in whether or not
one's deepest relationship to the wider universe is intact. When
intact, one experiences a deeply rooted wholeness and sense of
belonging that is not only the basis for psychospiritual health,
but which spontaneously gives rise to two inescapable truths.
One is that Life is on your side. The other is that you are an
active participant in the outcome of your situations.
<P>
If this relationship is catastrophically compromised however,
a profound sense of isolation results. It is not a physical isolation
but a psychospiritual one which, in the face of any significant
crisis, gives rise to two inescapable symptoms. One is a potentially
life-threatening hopelessness. The other is a devastating sense
of helplessness. Together, these symptoms are the hallmark of
the psychospiritual healing crisis.
<H3>Hope</H3>

<P>
Health is the goal of all illness. It is not the other way around.
If, as the modern medical sciences would have us believe, we were
nothing but disease-prone biochemical machines that constantly
require the upkeep and expert intervention of doctors, drugs and
assorted technologies, there could be no pain, no fear, no sickness
and no AIDS. An injury or toxin would do its damage, there would
be absolutely no symptoms at any stage of the illness, there would
be absolutely no effort or desire to overcome it, and we'd die
with no one either noticing or caring.
<P>
Of course this is hardly the case. Life is a self-correcting system
which, as we shall see, regulates itself emotionally. Far from
total indifference and incompetence, the symptoms of sickness,
fear, disease and, in extreme cases, death are a direct expression
of an intelligent organism responding to a serious threat or imbalance.
They are an expression of the healing process forcefully asserting
itself, working quite vigorously in fact to restore its preexisting
integrity.
<P>
More importantly though, this physical healing response is accompanied
by the emotional desire to get better. And you must want to get
better. Why else would you have gone to a health professional?
<P>
And this is the critical point. The body's vigorous response to
restore health on the one hand and our natural desire to get better
on the other are the physical and psychological counterparts to
one and the same Creative Life Force. You cannot have one without
the other. Together they are the expressions of a much deeper
and profoundly more comprehensive Bio-Cosmic Law of integration
and wholeness that, completely out of our hands, was operative
and existant long before doctors and scientists arrived on the
scene, and one which continues to govern the life process today
in spite of what doctors and scientists do.
<P>
If producing the symptoms of illness and the simple desire to
get better are simply two expressions of one and the same biologically
active process, it is impossible to desire total health without
the simultaneous and fully operational capacity to produce it.
Contact with this deep inner truth is the basis for the experience
of Hope. Life is on your side. Make sure your physician is also.
<H3>An Illusion of Helplessness</H3>

<P>
Life is a creative process. As the process unfolds, each defining
element within it plays a critical role in determining exactly
how the situation ultimately plays itself out.
<P>
As products of this process, we are no exception. Simply by being
human we play a critical defining role in our lives. Any situation
within which we find ourselves necessarily includes us in its
definition. Like it or not, we are therefore an active participant
in the outcome of our situations.
<P>
But more important, when one is emotionally connected to the broader
environmental process one also experiences an emotional and self-regulatory
stake in its outcome. This is the basis for self-responsibility
and self-empowerment; one spontaneously wants to take charge and
participate as one immediately feels the fact of consequences
going with actions.
<P>
And this is the second critical point. As an active and responsible
participant in the outcome of your situations, it is only when
you feel emotionally divorced from your broader environment that
you can feel helpless. This is all helplessness is. You do not
feel helpless due to some innate and absolute state of not being
able to do anything. You feel helpless because you have been experiencially
cut off, isolated, both internally and externally, from the broader
dynamics of your evolving situation.
<H3>Health</H3>

<P>
If you are an active participant in the outcome of your situations,
you are also an active participant in the outcome of your health.
Direct access to the mechanism of health is gained through the
fulfillment of our basic human needs. We are directly responsible
for the nurturing and nourishing quality of our love, sex, food,
rest, work and shelter, and how pleasurable and satisfying they
are and whether or not there are any toxicities or deficiencies
involved.
<P>
Everything we do in these realms will directly support or detract
from the mechanism of health. These needs are our central regulators.
It is only through their gratification that health can truly be
fulfilled. And yet we try to skip or bypass this fact and artificially
produce health with pills, genetics, biochemical adjustments,
radiation, or even the removal of body parts. This physiological
approach to health is not only dealing after the fact, it is an
evasion of our humanity.
<P>
The same goes for non-toxic &quot;holistic&quot; therapies and
approaches. They too can get you back to where you were before
your illness expressed itself, albeit a lot more safely. But then
the goal remains the same: survival, not health.
<P>
All these therapies are meaningless and nothing will fundamentally
change if they are not applied within the broader context of changing
the way we fulfill our basic human needs. And this is the realm
in which our own self-responsibility is directly operative. No
doctor or therapy can take charge of your life. It is only when
you are divorced from this truth that health becomes a matter
of chance rather than choice.
<H3>Key to Health and Happiness</H3>

<P>
Being cornered by these facts may at first be startling. It leaves
you face to face with the fact that the greater responsibility
for your life is right smack in your own hands. It does not permit
for any mysterious &quot;other&quot; to magically come down and
rescue you.
<P>
But upon further reflection this should also be liberating. It
means that you and you alone (with the support of the universe
that is on your side) have the total freedom to actively shape
the outcome of any aspect of every one of your situations.
<P>
The simple desire to create a better life for yourself is, like
the desire for health, impossible to have without the simultaneous
and fully operational capacity to actually do it. The key is to
appreciate that health and happiness are not something you get.
They are something you generate. And you have both the freedom
and the responsibility to generate them.
<H3>Unmasking HIV</H3>

<P>
It is interesting that the individuals dealing with HIV and AIDS
related fears and conditions are the central &quot;defining elements&quot;
in the &quot;AIDS Crisis&quot; and yet, outside of counting their
T-cells and taking toxic medications, both doctors and society
at large ensure that these people are totally divorced from any
active participation within the crisis. No wonder they feel terrified
and helpless!
<P>
The initial fear they feel has a very rational component to it.
It is being triggered by the deep intuition that they are in enemy
territory. Although dealing with people who they are supposed
to trust, they are being told that life is not on their side,
that there is no hope, and that they are helpless in the face
of the fact. The fear is assigned to a harmless retrovirus but
it is, in fact, an intuitive red-alert that the situation they
are faced with is a deadly threat to their deepest humanity. This
fear must be respected!
<P>
It is not a virus that can or will kill you, it is the HIV/AIDS
hypothesis and the kind and well-meaning proponents of it! Unknow-ingly
or not, these people are the antithesis of health care providers.
Willingly or unwillingly they are the agents of, and active participants
within, a social system bent on enslavement. Hopelessness and
helplessness are psychosocial functions, not retroviral ones.
T-cells are the least of your problems. Its your humanity that's
at stake.
<H2>II. Two Critical Consequences</H2>

<P>
When a derailed psychospiritual healing crisis is at hand, a simple
intellectual understanding of what is going on in the situation
is useless. Fear thats rooted in ignorance is lifted with knowledge.
But when the fear is borne of preexisting and unresolved psychospiritual
tensions, all the knowledge in the world won't set you free. So
how do you know the difference? Very simple.
<P>
When a person's innate participatory role in life has been seriously
compromised, two crucial phenomena emerge which, expressed socially,
are also critical to understanding the broader societal context
for AIDS. One is a crisis mentality where the goal is not to solve
the problem but to perpetuate the crisis. The other is scapegoating,
where every-thing that is blamed for the crisis has the unique
distinction of being completely outside the realm of one's own
self-responsibility.
<P>
The latter, with its seed of truth, is the trigger for the former,
and the former, as a survival mechanism resulting from a derailed
psychospiritual healing crisis, periodically looks for a trigger
to bring its unconscious and unresolved psychospiritually-based
tensions to a climactic head, offering some substitute sense of
periodic and temporary relief.
<H3>The Crisis Mentality</H3>

<P>
Under healthy psychospiritual conditions, a child will solve complex
tasks through gratification. He or she will experience a certain
emotional intensity and excitement, a &quot;charge&quot; if you
will, and they will spontaneously gratify that tension by pleasurably
&quot;discharging&quot; the task without any prompting or coercion.
In addition to the satisfaction and self-confidence which result,
there will be an open welcome to the next situation, knowing that
it too can be pleasurably &quot;discharged&quot;.
<P>
However, authoritarian societies, by their very nature, chronically
compromise this innate capacity for self-regulation by cruelly
isolating children from their pleasure-oriented impulses. The
result is that in adulthood, we tend to steer clear, unless forced
to do otherwise, of virtually any person, task or difficult situation
that we either truly desire or find emotionally engaging, as the
impulse to gratify has become profoundly associated with fear.
Approaches to situations which would then otherwise be both rational
and productive become, instead, transformed into a crisis mentality
where the unconscious goal is not to gratify the situation but,
in fact, to create or perpetuate a crisis.
<P>
This is because the chronic compromise in self-regulation produces
a split between meaningful activities and the substance which
makes these activities emotionally meaningful. Genuinely exciting
activities are replaced with cheap titilation. And the emotional
charge of doing what genuinely makes us happy is never resolved,
resulting in the internal build up of a lot of ungratified and
unresolved tension.
<P>
Although emotionally &quot;safe&quot;, this way of life is profoundly
dissatisfying, generating a great deal of emptiness, depression
and resentment on the one hand and a great deal of unconscious
hate and sadistic aggression on the other. Additionally, this
emotional tension, having had all outlets for its healthy expression
barred off still seeks, indeed demands, a periodic sense of release!
<P>
Its in between this split that the crisis mentality appears. Its
function is to push these preexisting and unresolved tensions
to a head by endowing harmless and titilating scapegoats with
a wealth of ungratified energy. We've all seen people get &quot;worked
up over nothing&quot;. This is the crisis mentality at work. The
lack of profound satisfaction is so very deep and so very frustrating
that the only practical option left is to find an excuse to work
oneself up into a frenzy, frantically raising one's tension levels
to a pitch where something has got to finally break.
<P>
When, in the extreme cases, something does finally break, what
usually breaks is your heart, your mind, your body or your spirit.
Each recurrent break will indeed produce some sense of substitute
relief. But not only will it be temporary, it will always be accompanied
by destructive consequences, &quot;side-effects&quot;, because
the real issues are never being addressed. In AIDS, the consequences
are fatal.
<H3>The Trigger</H3>

<P>
Coincident with the crisis mentality, a compromise in one's ability
to respond to ungratified tension will produce a tendancy to blame.
The spectrum of blame can range from endowing unmanageable inanimate
objects with hostile intent (that damn stapler) to the worst forms
of racism. In the Toxic Distress and Iatrogenic Disease Syndrome*
crisis, presently called the &quot;AIDS&quot; crisis, the scapegoat
is HIV.
<P>
One of the hallmarks of a scapegoat is that whatever it is blamed
for has the unique distinction of being completely outside the
realm of anybody's self-responsibility. So what is the function
of the scapegoat? First of all, aside from the market benefits,
assigning blame to and trying to treat something that no one can
possibly be responsible for ensures that, by evading the real
issues, conditions for the crisis will stay exactly the same.
Secondly, it serves as the perfect trigger for the crisis mentality
because nothing can be done to eliminate what's not there.
<P>
If the underlying tensions were directly addressed, triggers like
HIV would be unnecessary and the scapegoat scare simply would
not take hold. But to a preexisting crisis mentality looking to
push the unbearable tensions to a head, a microbe, real or imagined,
is very enticing. One can become engaged in activities and appointments
and medication protocols ad infinitum, getting a titilating sense
of accomplishment without fundamentally changing anything.
<P>
But all the while there will be this inner sense of doom and gloom
which is simply nature's way of telling you that you are not addressing
the real issues in your life. When you hit the nail on the head,
when the truth is identified, when you are engaged in something
that is genuinely making a difference for the better, there is
an unmistakable excitement and satisfaction that goes along with
it. The universe is on your side. A genuine change is occurring.
Whatever it is that you are doing &quot;works&quot;. It makes
sense, it feels good, and it is energizing. Let this be your guide!
If you are not feeling this, you are not on the right track!
<P>
Once you recognize this to be the case, you can then just skip
the virus crap and go straight to the underlying issues. If, however,
you choose to go the viral route, you'll end up creating real
problems for yourself and, having thus satisfied the goal of the
crisis mentality, the psychospiritual issues will be totally out
of reach. You will now have real life and death issues to grapple
with and, except for the deep inner misery that'll be quietly
lurking, you'll be completely divorced from the real issues in
your life.
<H3>The Bad Seed of Truth</H3>

<P>
To qualify as a successful trigger for the crisis mentality the
scapegoat, whether person, place or thing, needs a seed of truth.
That gives it its reality. Without a seed of truth, we'd all see
right through it regardless of our personal agendas. Once established
though, the seed is then blown up to a size and shape that matches
the preexisting psychospiritual tensions.
<P>
The power of HIV is that its harmless seed of truth - the proteins
that are not even unique to it - has been endowed with so much
mystery that, after absorbing countless contradictions and paradoxes,
it still somehow seems reasonable. The genius of this ruse is
that it permits a deep and highly personalized reality. In yet
another example of HIV self-hypnosis, it actively engages people's
imaginations, every gap in logic being personally filled in according
to the unconscious needs of each individual involved.
<P>
So how do you tell if what is attributed to the seed of truth
is truth, half truth or untruth? How can you tell whether it can
actually carry the responsibility ascribed to it, or if it is
being used for other purposes, like to stoke a crisis and sell
medications?
<P>
If the simple seed of truth is being used for anything other than
the simple seed of truth that it is, it will pass, in its descriptions
and functions, from &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;complex&quot;
to &quot;simplistic&quot; and &quot;complicated&quot;. This is
highlighted by a simple comparison.
<P>
Nature is simultaneously simple and complex. Its simplicity endows
its complexity with truth and beauty. Its complexity is harmonious,
nourishing, inspiring and generates a profound sense of pleasure,
respect and appreciation.
<P>
Authoritarian societies on the other hand are simultaneously simplistic
and complicated. And a simplistic approach to a genuine crisis
will always complicate things.
<P>
&quot;Complicated&quot; is a pale imitation of &quot;complex&quot;,
lacking its cohesion and internal consistency. It is chaotic,
disruptive, disorienting, fragmenting, confusing, draining, immobilizing,
uninspiring, disempowering, and incites fear and rage. This is
HIV.
<P>
&quot;Simplistic&quot; has the look of &quot;simple&quot;, but
lacks the substance, depth and reach. In these societies, answers
to profound and complex questions are simplistic because they
cannot carry the truth that a more integrated reality has to offer.
They would force questions that nobody wants to ask, let alone
answer. This is AIDS.
<P>
With HIV we have been handed a crisis mentality trigger made to
order - emotionally, intellectually, physically, aesthetically,
financially, politically, and psychospiritually. Its lack of substance
would be immediately recognized anywhere else and under any other
conditions. But here, the preexisting crisis mentality and scapegoating
phenomena throughout our society provide a mockery of the emotional
energy and genuine excitement that real substance itself would
normally excite. They thereby make the simplistic attractive and
the complicated reasonable.
<P>
AIDS is simplistic. HIV is complicated. HIV=AIDS=DEATH&Ecirc;is
both simplistic and com-plicated. Prophylaxing is simplistic.
Condoms are simplistic. Needle exchange is simplistic. Taking
AZT is simplistic. Straight from the heart of authoritarian society,
it all serves to keep us enslaved, frightened, submissive and
dependant. The idea that people are not being harmed by the complications
of modern medicine is also simplistic. People are simply being
murdered.
<H3>Grit and Grace</H3>

<P>
But what if? &quot;I know the tests are no good, but what if it
turns out that they actually mean something?! What if HIV actually
does cause AIDS?! Why, even once &Ocirc;enlightened' to what's
going on, do seeds of doubt continue to linger? I feel fine, but
my T-cells are low, so I better prophylax! For God's sakes I have
to do something!!!&quot;
<P>
Getting out of the AIDS Zone while wrestling with an out of control
crisis mentality is extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible,
without two things. One is an active awareness and understanding
of the nature and dynamics of the crisis mentality itself. To
this question we hope to have lent some insight.
<P>
The second, and sort of the bridge between the first and psychospiritual
health itself, is a combination of what we might call grit and
grace. &quot;Grit&quot; is certainty in the self in uncertain
situations. &quot;Grace&quot; is recognizing that the situation
requires uncertainty. Both are a function of hope, in the psychospiritual
sense of the word. Life is on your side, but not mechanically
so. It demands an active and participatory self-responsibility
within which you have the freedom to generate your own health
and happiness.
<P>
Grit and grace cannot, of course, be adopted from the outside
in. Any attempt to do so would serve to further stoke the crisis
mentality because you wouldn't get any results. However, simply
by identifying that grit and grace exist and appealing to your
intuitive awareness of them, we hope to reawaken some degree of
your direct access to them.
<P>
Welcome your anxiety. It is at the heart of the psychospiritual
healing crisis. It is alerting you to the psychospiritual clues
being handed directly to you. All you need do is ride with the
emotional tension of &quot;not knowing&quot; as an active participant,
patiently gathering and sifting through all of the clues. Then
the tension will be allowed to fully develop and consummate itself,
and insight will be the result.
<P>
Focusing on HIV however will completely subvert this process.
As the prototypical evasion of the twenty-first century it will
completely undermine any possibility for pyschospiritual health.
<P>
And so far as AIDS and physical health go, understand that its
not the issues that are being evaded that constitute the crisis,
its the fact of the evasion itself. And its only when divorced
from this context that illness can render you hopeless and helpless.
Probably the most important factor in the healing process is the
realization that a health challenge is not the enemy. It is instead
the psychospiritual teacher and life is a learning process.
<H2>III. Psychospiritual Warfare</H2>

<P>
Within authoritarian society one can find the most curious set
of phenomena. Doctors destroy health, lawyers destroy justice,
scientists destroy truth, psychiatrists destroy minds, schools
destroy education, textbooks destroy knowledge, politicians destroy
democracies, governments destroy freedom, masses of people destroy
self-responsibility, families destroy love, business destroys
work, pornography destroys sex, and churchs destroy souls.
<P>
On the surface this is nonsensical, but deep down we all know
that there is far more than just a simple seed of truth. And armed
with an understanding of the crisis mentality its truth becomes
frighteningly clear.
<P>
When a society's capacity for self-regulation is, as a whole,
chronically damaged, it becomes survivalistic, exploitative and
&quot;authoritarian&quot; with a destructive polarization between
the &quot;haves&quot; and the &quot;have nots&quot;. To maintain
this sort of relationship it is essential that everything done
by both sides has the unspoken goal of derailing the inevitable
psychospiritual healing crisis that would otherwise heal the split.
It must be ensured that people remain isolated from their environment,
their culture, their histories, their emotions, their thoughts,
even their physiology, as it all serves to cultivate the essential
helplessness, hopelessness and dependancy that is critical to
subverting psychospiritual health.
<P>
This is the context within which all of the above disciplines,
institutions and industries have emerged. They all have to destroy
the very thing they claim to protect or provide or produce. Whatever
the task to be solved, an evasive solution must be found which
serves a two-fold goal. On the one hand it has to increase the
likelihood of finding or producing a trigger with which to justify
pushing the unresolved and preexisting psychospiritual tensions
to a head, and, on the other hand, it must be able to be applied
in such a way that it can also justify, with a seed of truth,
the expression of the sadistic hate and aggression which have
built up around the lack of gratification of the self-same tension.
This is not to say that every doctor and lawyer goes to this extreme.
But make no mistake, as long as they are acting within that system,
they will get drawn into it to some degree or other because it
is, by its very nature, designed to promote, protect and facilitate
this sort of crisis mentality behavior. Forget love, freedom or
self-responsibility. The system is there to help people survive
and celebrate within the Social AIDS Zone, not escape it.
<H3>An Intervening Step?</H3>

<P>
This is also the context within which both HIV and AIDS emerged.
As the unconscious societal force at the heart of the AIDS and
other Zones, the crisis mentality will draw you in if you do not
address the underlying issues which make you susceptible to it.
Its in this context that you must understand it to start to get
out of it.
<P>
And this is why we say AIDS is a wake-up call and not a death
sentence. In the course of an individual's life, he or she frequently
has a psychospiritual healing crisis which, when pushed to a head,
results in one of two things. Either the individual succombs,
or they reorganize on a higher and deeper level of development
- they &quot;find themselves&quot;.
<P>
The same is true of AIDS, but with one exciting difference. AIDS
is anchored in the social realm. With AIDS, the psycho-socio-spiri-tual
healing crisis for society's &quot;marginalized&quot; people is
being viciously pushed to a head. It is a trigger for marginalized
individuals, the primary customers for the deadly AIDS market,
to &quot;find themselves&quot; in the social sphere before they
find themselves hanging from a red ribbon.
<P>
Of course, they're looking to find themselves in a society that's
designed to keep them out! But if they play their cards right,
they can use AIDS as a springboard to trigger the wider social
reorganization thats been aching to happen for decades, really
centuries. Society's non-marginalized people don't yet recognize
it but they too are participating within the same psychospiritual
healing crisis. They all seem to know that something is very wrong,
but they have no concept of what it is. They just need a trigger.
<P>
There will, of course, be the usual efforts by &quot;leaders&quot;
and other architects of social policy to subvert any conscious
attempt to facilitate this natural and inevitable healing process.
The marketing of AIDS is a perfect example. But our choice is
to either move with and actively facilitate this exciting social
process, or to continue subverting it by focusing on HIV and other
evasive triggers in an endless parade of scapegoats.
<P>
All of the horrors of our society are symptoms of the fact that
our social system is inconsistent with our nature as human beings.
Short of completely destroying the planet, the reorganization
that's aching to happen will happen. The question is whether or
not there will be one more intervening step.
<P>
AIDS is the epitome of a corporate-based social enslavement bent
on psychospiritual warfare. To recognize it as such is a step
in the right direction. If not, the mental, emotional and psychospiritual
enslavement will have no where else to grow but into the physical
realm. We assure you, if the latter is the path of choice, be
prepared. It'll culminate in some-thing far more ugly than AIDS.
<H2>Conclusion</H2>

<P>
We hope to have demonstrated to you that AIDS is not some new
and exotic &quot;always fatal&quot; disease. Everything about
it is completely consistent with the much larger and preexisting
system of exploitation and terror from which it emerged, a system
built on cultivating dependancy, compliance, apathy and indifference.
Every single element of AIDS matches the same exact pattern, even
predictably so, of the broader corporate, market based, hate inspiring
authoritarian social system, a system which depends upon emotional
enslavement and sexual terrorism to perpetuate itself. It is absolutely
nothing new.
<P>
If seeing the fraud is not sufficient to get you out of the AIDS
Zone, you have got to ask yourself what role HIV and AIDS are
playing in your life. How are they being used to evade the substantial
and unresolved internal issues which meanwhile supply the energy
for the crisis mentality?
<P>
And just because you know the antibody and T-cell tests are exploitative
and unscientific, do not pretend that you are home free. One cannot
live within an authoritarian society and remain untouched by the
hysteria. You must first acknowledge that these triggers are seductive,
and then see where the broader exploration takes you. Only by
this or a similar process can you undermine the emotional potency
of these tests and get to the real underlying issues. Then the
compulsion to take them will dry up to nothingness.
<P>
It is built into our very nature that at every moment one cannot
help but make an active choice: you either create a new life for
yourself or you recreate and reinforce the old one. And all there
is is the moment. So its a choice you're making right now.
<P>
We hope that by seeing AIDS as simply yet another, albeit more
refined weapon of the same old exploitative social system that
you can and will make new choices. Not only will it facilitate
your exit from the AIDS Zone and help you to help others escape,
but it'll help you better understand the nature and dynamics of
authoritarian social systems in general and how they made AIDS
not only possible but inevitable, and even necessary.
<P>
HEAL is simple and complex. GMHC, APLA, Project Inform, ACT-UP
and AMFAR are, in their approach to AIDS, simplistic and complicated.
You can be sure they are destroying the very people they purport
to help.
<P>
If you want us to continue, send a donation now. We cannot continue
to operate HEAL for you without your financial support.<A NAME="thanks"></A>
