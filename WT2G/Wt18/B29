TALLAHASSEE --(<CITE>Florida Environments</CITE> )-- by Dave Newport, Editor--If
one of the tanks cleanup bills filed last month becomes law, Florida tanks
cleanup contractors could have a very happy new year indeed.<BR>
<BR>
Another committee bill that allows risk assessment of polluted sites has
a more uncertain future. Both bills are set for discussion by Legislative
committees this month.<BR>
<BR>
A big bill filed by State Rep. Sembler would return many of the state-funded
perks nixed by Governor Lawton Chiles' executive Order last March. While
the bill does not call for a return to the much maligned reimbursement years,
a few elements may prove contentious during this year's session.<BR>
<BR>
The bill will be heard by the House Environmental Protection subcommittee
tomorrow at 1:30 in the State Capitol.<BR>
<BR>
Some of the bills highlights would:</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
CARROLLWOOD--The St. Petersburg Times reported yesterday that the practice
of bulldozing protected gopher tortoise homes has become cheaper and easier
that trying to save them. Environmental consultants and developers were
said to be taking advantage of a system designed to protect habitat. According
to the Times, many developers are just paying the fees required to bulldoze
tortoise holes instead of paying a consultant to relocate them.<BR>
<BR>
The fees are used by the state to buy tortoise habitat elsewhere and protect
it from development.<BR>
<BR>
Consultant Ray Ashton of Water &amp; Air Research in Gainesville told the
Times, &quot;Consultants have been very greedy and less than professional.
They overcharge.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The developers, according to Ashton, see the fees as part of the price of
the job and the tortoises become, &quot;a problem that has to be gotten
rid of.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Twenty one Florida landowners applied for permits to destroy habitat four
years ago. Last year, the number jumped to 75.<BR>

GAINESVILLE--(The Gainesville Sun)--by Bruce Ritchie--Could energy have
been saved in producing the chair you are sitting in? And is the design

<BR>
These are the types of questions being raised by the worldwide &quot;sustainable
development&quot; movement. A semester-long lecture series on the movement's
issues starts today at the University of Florida.<BR>
<BR>
Sustainable development has been described as a system of balancing economic
progress, environmental quality, democratic participation and social issues.<BR>
<BR>
The UF lecture series will involve a range of academic subjects including
agriculture, philosophy, transportation and land-use planning.<BR>

EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK--(Associated Press)--Alligators who have had the
Everglades to themselves made way for humans Saturday as the national park
opened its gates for the first time since the partial federal shutdown.<BR>
<BR>
As they lolled about on the banks of the famed River of Grass, the gators
flinched only when the occasional tourist got too close. Otherwise, they
went about sunning themselves as usual in the warm Florida sun.<BR>
<BR>
The 1.5 million-acre swamp opened Saturday after President Clinton signed
legislation to restore the jobs and pay of 280,000 government workers, furloughed
since Dec. 16.<BR>
<BR>
Shark Valley, a popular entrance to the park about 40 miles west of Miami,
waived its $4 entrance fee for the day and was bustling with visitors. By
noon, about 70 visitors had stopped by, said Bob Nodell, who runs the concession
stand that rents bicycles and sells tram rides into the park.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
MIAMI--PRNewswire -- A new poll of Florida voters conducted by the national
polling firm of Fabrizio McLaughlin &amp; Associates shows there has been
a dramatic drop in support for a 2-cents-a-pound tax on Florida Sugar Farmers
despite a multi-million dollar pro-tax advertising campaign. From October
1995 until December, the poll shows, support collapsed by more than one-third
among voters and opposition to the $75 million-a-year tax proposal has nearly
tripled. <BR>
<BR>
Pollster Jim McLaughlin said that while the pro-tax group claimed in October
that 71 percent of Florida voters supported the tax, the December polls
shows that support has plummeted to 44.7 percent. At the same time, McLaughlin
said, opposition to the tax has risen from 16 percent in October to 42.5
percent in December. The poll, conducted Dec. 20-21 on behalf of An Alliance
of Sugar Farmers, interviewed 600 registered voters. The margin of error
was plus or minus four percent. <BR>
<BR>
The pro-tax poll, conducted by Luntz Research, is the centerpiece of a campaign
funded by an out-of-state commodity trader, to impose a massive $350 million
tax only on Florida sugar farmers ($75 million a year for five years) for
restoration of the Florida Everglades. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Radical environmentalists, funded by more than $5 million contributed
by commodities broker Paul Tudor Jones, have run an advertising campaign
similar to what would be required for a close governor's race,&quot; said
McLaughlin. &quot;Television ads have blitzed the airways statewide claiming
that Floridians favor the proposed tax by a four-to-one margin. More than
13 full-page newspaper ads were printed and hundreds of radio commercials
trumpeted their cause. But, to no avail. The public in Florida simply isn't
buying it.&quot; <BR>

Africa</STRONG> 
<BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
INDIAN SHORES, Fla. (AP)--All 24 crippled Florida brown pelicans flown to
South Africa survived a long flight and a month long quarantine and now
call a wildlife sanctuary outside Cape Town home.<BR>
<BR>
The birds, permanently injured, were rehabilitated at the Suncoast Seabird
Sanctuary and shipped over Thanksgiving to World of Birds at Hout Bay.``It's
a beautiful spot for them,'' Lee Daniel, a Pinellas County tourism spokesman,
said Friday. He accompanied the pelicans on their 14-hour flight from Miami.
``All made the flight in good shape.''<BR>
<BR>
He said it is an opportunity for South Africans to see the Eastern brown
pelican.<BR>
<BR>
The Suncoast Seabird Sanctuary, too cramped to keep all the injured birds
that are nursed back to health, has relocated rehabilitated wildlife in
Singapore, Belgium, Greece, England and Canada.<BR>
<BR>
The placement program is designed to find homes for permanently injured
Florida seabirds who are unable to fend for themselves in the wild but are
capable of healthy lives and producing healthy offspring, said owner Ralph
Heath.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
The Associated Press (c). JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP)--A large garbage sack
was emptied onto a table and out tumbled beer cans, soda bottles, foam fast-food
boxes, plastic bags, aluminum foil and trash.<BR>
<BR>
All of it was collected from the St. Johns River in less than an hour, said
State Rep. Jim King of Jacksonville. The demonstration came as officials
outlined plans for a foot-to-mouth cleanup of Florida's longest river on
March 2.<BR>
<BR>
Volunteers in 14 counties touched by the stream are expected to help.<BR>
<BR>
The St. Johns, the only northern flowing river in the United States, is
the centerpiece of Jacksonville's downtown renewal. With its tributaries,
it gives thousands of boaters, skiers, fishermen and picnickers pleasure
each year, from Melbourne to Mayport.<BR>
<BR>
The cleanup is being sponsored by the St. Johns River Water Management District.
Organizers hope it will heighten awareness and become an annual affair.<BR>

Cement plant public hearing in Gainesville draws 110 protesters</H3>
<UL><BR>
GAINESVILLE-- (EnviroWorld)-- Over 100 local residents last night peppered
state environmental officials with questions about the state's intent to
permit a proposed 2,300 ton per day cement plant's air emissions to be built
near Gainesville. <BR>
<BR>
The Department of Environmental Protection officials present at the public
hearing requested by local residents defended their decisions. The only
criteria they have by which to evaluate the Florida Rock application are
based on the plant's ability to meet environmental standards.<BR>
<BR>
Citizens voiced concerns that the plant is sited in a residential area and
would foul the air and local surface water which are directly connected
to the Florida aquifer, the sole source of drinking water for area residents.<BR>
<BR>
Florida Rock representatives have stated that all the cement kiln dust generated
by process operations at the plant would be recycled. However, residents
and environmental officials agree that tons of the dangerous dust would
still be emitted by the plant's kiln emissions. <BR>
<BR>
The proposal has several legal challenges already pending and an administrative
hearing of DEP's permit set by challengers slated to begin February 28,
in Gainesville. That decision is anticipated in June.<BR>

<H3>Sentinel says environmental industry to see slow but steady growth </H3>
<UL><BR>
ORLANDO--(EnviroWorld)--The Orlando Sentinel says the environmental industry
is like a child entering the teen age years: controversy gives way to maturity.<BR>
<BR>
Quoting national expert Grant Ferrier of the Environmental Business Journal,
the Sentinel says the industry as a whole may grow 20 percent over the next
five years, so workers should be &quot;positive but cautious,&quot; Ferrier
said.<BR>
<BR>
The $9.8 billion (1994 revenues) national industry won't see the repaid
growth spurred by new federal environmental laws like Superfund, the Sentinel
reported. Instead, privatization of government programs and offshore marketing
will be profit centers.<BR>
<BR>
In Florida, the Southern Environmental Business Council was born to help
pull industry forces together to seek such markets, according to Chris Given,
the SEBC's interim president.<BR>
<BR>
Given says the SEBC's birth was helped by last year's demise of Florida's
petroleum tanks cleanup program, but that the council's mission is to broaden
the industry's opportunities.<BR>

<H3>First Environmental Regulation Service Opens Its Doors</H3>
<UL><BR>
FT. LAUDERDALE--(EnviroWorld)--Customized Regulatory Information Service,
Inc., in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., announced on Monday the opening of the first
environmental regulation service tailored to the specific needs of regulated
businesses. CRIS reviews all federal, state, and local environmental regulations
each day and identifies the specific regulations that are relevant to its
customers. CRIS then informs its customers immediately about the changes.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Keeping track of constantly changing environmental regulations is
one of the great challenges facing businesses,&quot; said Richard Hopen,
an environmental attorney and CRIS founder. &quot;CRIS subscribers will
be able to keep up with the ever-changing and complex environmental regulations.
This new service will help take the worry out of environmental compliance.&quot;<BR>

<H3>Water officials make Pasco visit to look at wetlands woes</H3>
<UL>LAND O'LAKES -- (EnviroWorld)--The St. Petersburg Times today reported
that water officials from around Tampa Bay visited Pasco County on Monday
to evaluate wetlands damage and came to no conclusions.<BR>
<BR>
While some officials saw wetlands on the verge of extinction, others saw
the same area as capable of recovery. <BR>
<BR>
The tour arranged by the Hillsborough County Commission was aimed at forging
a greater regional awareness of Tampa Bay's water problems.<BR>
<BR>
Officials from the West Coast Regional Water Supply Authority joined water
management officials and elected officials from Tampa and St. Petersburg
on the visit of Pasco wetlands and well fields.<BR>

<H3>ERC chief wants Chiles to get tough on the environment</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../Images/image94.gif" WIDTH="65" HEIGHT="92" ALIGN="bottom" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" BORDER="1">GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--The chairman
of Florida's environmental rulemaking commission says the Chiles Administration
needs tougher environmental legislation and policies.<BR>
<BR>
In meetings with Florida Environments magazine editorial staff, Environmental
Regulation Commission chairman Dick Batchelor says he's going to ask the
Governor to take a stronger environmental stance.<BR>
<BR>
Chiles, according to Batchelor, &quot;Would be stronger if he had a solid
environmental platform. I have talked to [Lt. Gov.] Buddy [McKay] and I'm
going to suggest to the Governor that he take a much stronger environmental
stance in his State of the State speech.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Batchelor, along with most leading environmentalists in Florida, is not
happy with the way Chiles has allowed the Department of Environmental Protection
to operate.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I have many times found myself at odds with the [DEP] Secretary [Virginia
Wetherell], over environmental policies,&quot; Batchelor said. However,
a recent DEP staff retreat at Wakulla Springs aimed at overcoming differences
was &quot;helpful,&quot; Batchelor said.<BR>
<BR>
The former legislator from Orlando says Chiles needs to set a stronger environmental
tone for his administration so that DEP staff will sing along because, &quot;some
in the department think I'm singing off key.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Batchelor, a Chiles' appointee, is particularly concerned that the Ecosystem
Management program championed by Chiles and Wetherell lacks teeth. According
to Batchelor, this feel-good form of environmental regulation needs to have
more bite.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;At some point [DEP] has to be able to say, 'we're not going to allow
that'&quot; to a polluter,&quot;<BR>
Batchelor said.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Risk task force mired in technical murk</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--Yesterday's meeting of state task
force charged with drafting guidelines for risk assessment in environmental
rules was weighted down by confusion over terminology and technical detail.<BR>
<BR>
In only its third meeting since being formed last month, the Risk Based
Priority Council is a mix of lay and expert risk assessment interest groups
appointed by the Governor, and Senate and House leaders. The group is to
have a report to the Legislature by the end of this year.<BR>
<BR>
But confusion over technical concepts among the group's members were the
order of yesterday's meeting and a detailed report by December seems elusive.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I have a feeling that it won't be a very detailed report,&quot; member
Pat Cline told Florida Environments magazine in December.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There seems to be a lot of fuzziness in our group over problem formulation
and how it will fit into our guidelines,&quot; group chairman Steve Roberts
commented yesterday.<BR>
<BR>
Problem formulation is but one of 13 major areas set for the council's report.</BLOCKQUOTE>

a controversial development proposed near American Beach has been approved
by county officials.<BR>
<BR>
The 80-acre golf course and 150-home subdivision is opposed by some local
residents and environmentalists because it would allegedly strip away protective
cover along coastal dunes.<BR>

In a tense meeting last night, two protesters were arrested after they refused

out.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WINTER PARK--On Jan. 15, Florida environmentalists can celebrate
a milestone of environmental history with the Twenty-fifth anniversary of
the halting of the Cross-Florida Barge Canal. Of the $185 million total
cost for the project, estimated by the Corps, one third was been spent,
but only about 10 percent of the total 110 mile canal was built. <BR>
<BR>
Since 1971 the canal has been deauthorized by the Corps, but the reservoir
remains. The Governor has ordered the Department of Environmental Protection
to obtain permits to restore the reservoir area and environmentalists are
&quot;cautiously optimistic&quot; it will be accomplished.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>MIAMI--(EnviroWorld)--One of Florida's most respected environmental
champions will come head-to-head today in a panel designed to show how the
media is used in the debate over the preservation of the Everglades.<BR>
<BR>
At ``Lessons Learned in the Everglades for Dealing with Public Relations
for and Media Impact on Litigation of Environmental Cases,'' lawyers from
all sides of the Florida Everglades case join together at the American Bar
Association's (ABA) Section of Litigation Annual Meeting on Friday, Jan.
12, from 3:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. to discuss the balance between their legal
interests and public relations strategies. The panel discussion will be
held at the Sheraton Bal Harbour Hotel in the Caribbean Room, Lobby Level.
<BR>
<BR>
The panel will feature former DEP chief counsel and assistant Secretary
Dan Thompson versus Sugar attorney William Earl. Also on the panel is Susan
Ponzoli, an assistant U.S. attorney, who initiated the federal lawsuit against
the state of Florida over the pollution of the Glades.<BR>
<BR>
According to R. Benjamin Reid, a lawyer representing water interests in
the case and chair of the Section of Litigation meeting, all parties to
the case have used the media to press for their own advantage. ``A lawyer
in a public case such as this has a different duty in dealing with the media
than a lawyer in a private case. Not only is client privilege all but waived
when your client is a public entity, but the issues in the case may in fact
be decided in the public domain -- by referendum or legislative action,
possibly,'' he said. For more information, contact Marcia Kladder, 312-988-6133.<BR>

manatee census higher than expected</A> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG -The St. Petersburg Times reported today that
a statewide census of manatees counted 2,274 of the animals, according to
new statistics released by the state yesterday.<BR>
<BR>
The survey found the population to be 25 percent higher than last year,
and 22 percent higher than the 1,856 found in 1992, the Times stated. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm kind of still reeling from the shock of it,&quot; Bruce Ackerman,
a scientist at the Florida Marine Research Institute in St. Petersburg,
told the Times.<BR>
<BR>
However, researchers cautioned that the numbers may be misleading due to
the extra-cold weather pushing the sea creatures together in greater densities
in Florida's warmer coastal waters.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Does it mean that we grew 400 animals in one year? No,&quot; Scott
Wright, who coordinated the statewide manatee rescue program, told the Times.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The question is, what percentage of the total have we been counting
in past years? It's a question of what's been missed in the past.&quot;

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA - The Tampa Tribune reported that on Wednesday, the Senate
Natural Resources Committee passed 5-4 legislation to phase out $25 million
a year in recycling grants for counties and use the money to fight invasive
aquatic plants.<BR>
<BR>
However, within the two-sided issue between using funds to clean up lakes
or fund state recycling programs, Gov. Lawton Chiles is asking legislators
to finance recycling programs, regardless of efforts posed to use the money
to clean up suffocating lakes. The governor had entertained arguments for
transferring the money, according to spokesman Ron Sachs, but in the end
the recycling money made it into the governor's budget.<BR>
<BR>
Lawmakers are considering cutting DEP and other state agency budgets by
nearly 25 percent, in hopes to shuffle money from one project to fund another.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The $1.7 million generated annually by 150,000 park visitors is at risk
if the pure Ichetucknee Springs water quality turns bad, state environmental
officials say.<BR>
<BR>
Although there are no definite problems yet, fuel stations, mining and new
residential subdivisions pose threats to the underground water system that
feeds Ichetucknee Springs, said Jim Stevenson, a state Department of Environmental
Protection official.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Land-use planning, in the long haul is going to be the critical issue
and will determine whether we protect the Ichetucknee,&quot; Stevenson told
35 officials and others on the tour.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>HOMESTEAD - The Associated Press reported today that Metro-Dade
county commissioners approved a controversial lease with a private group
to develop Homestead air base into a civilian airport. <BR>
<BR>
The deal, approved at a commission meeting that went into the early morning
Thursday, would hand over the base to Homestead Air Base Developers Inc.,
for up to 60 years to develop a civilian airport and for up to 70 years
to develop shops and hotels.<BR>
<BR>
No rent is due from the developers until the group begins building on the
land and an appraiser sets the rent. Area residents, who opposed the lease
because the commission did not solicit competing bids, showed up in force
at Thursday's meeting. The lease still must be approved by the Federal Aviation
Administration.<BR>

of dispute</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>KEY WEST--(The Associated Press)--For more than 20 years, hundreds
of rhesus monkeys have plundered Key Lois, on the Atlantic side of the Florida
Keys. The primates have destroyed stands of red mangroves that once ringed
the island to such an extent that the existing red mangroves, protected
under state environmental laws, now have to be covered with wire mesh. <BR>
<BR>
Although pressure is mounting from some residents and environmentalists
to banish the laboratories and its monkeys from the Keys, members of the
Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission say they won't deny a new captive
breeding permit that the company needs as long as it cages all of its animals.
<BR>
<BR>
The island and monkeys are owned by Charles River Laboratories, a subsidiary
of vision-care giant Bausch &amp; Lomb, which sells the animals to medical
researchers. Charles River and the state have wrangled for years over the
environmental damage, pollution from monkey waste, the threat of escapes
and other issues stemming from the operation. Each time, agreements with
government officials have allowed the company to stay in operation. </BLOCKQUOTE>

major DOE cleanup</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Perma-Fix Environmental
Services Inc. (NASDAQ:PESI) announced yesterday that it has initiated the
operational phase of its mobile mixed low-level radioactive and hazardous
waste treatment project at the U.S. Department of Energy's Fernald, Ohio
facility. <BR>
<BR>
The Fernald facility is now operated by Fernald Environmental Restoration
Management Corp. (FERMCO), a DOE prime contractor. FERMCO authorized Perma-Fix
to proceed with the operational phase of the cleanup after Perma-Fix successfully
completed the rigorous requirements of the Readiness Assessment, typically
the most difficult hurdle encountered by contractors for DOE work. The total
contract value is approximately $971,000. <BR>
<BR>
The Mobile Mixed Waste Stabilization Project will use the Perma-Fix Process(tm)
to chemically stabilize and solidify 1,800 drums of mixed waste generated
during uranium and thorium production at the Fernald plant between 1953
and 1989. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;While the Perma-Fix Process(tm) is being used extensively in the commercial
and military sectors, the decision by a DOE prime contractor to use it on
such a large-scale mixed-waste project further validates the effectiveness
of our technology,&quot; said Dr.Louis F. Centofanti, Perma-Fix chairman.
&quot;The Perma-Fix Process(tm) will now play a major role in DOE's cleanup
efforts and will greatly reduce the agency's disposal costs.&quot; <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--A record number of migratory birds
are wintering at the St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge in North Florida,
according to a story in today's Tallahassee Democrat.<BR>
<BR>
Biologists recently counted 19,000 birds at the refuge, located 25 miles
south of Tallahassee. Last year, a record 9,000 birds were found wintering
within the wildlife sanctuary. This year's soaring numbers have been attributed
to the freezing cold winter weather.<BR>
<BR>
Those in the Tallahassee area will have a rare opportunity this Saturday,
and again on Feb. 4, to view the migratory visitors as well as other wildlife
residents at the refuge. That's when a state biologist will conduct driving
tours of the trails usually open only to hikers.<BR>
<BR>
For the standard $4 per-vehicle entry fee, visitors can drive past pools
where thousands of migratory birds winter each year. The tours will showcase
otters, bobcats, deer alligators and a growing population of bald eagles.<BR>
Tours will start at 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. Binoculars are recommended.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE - (EnviroWorld)--The St. Petersburg Times reported
that DEP secretary Virginia Wetherell's husband was hired as a lobbyist
by a utility seeking a permit to burn Orimulsion, a controversial new tar-based
fuel. Both the utility and the Wetherells' deny that any attempt was made
to influence the permit proceedings.<BR>
<BR>
But not long after Florida Power &amp; Light hired former House Speaker
TK Wetherell, the utility won a key permitting decision, the Times reported.
Wetherell and FP&amp;L maintain that his lobbying contract specifically
excludes lobbying DEP.<BR>
<BR>
An attorney opposed to the Orimulsion plant proposed for Manatee County
sees things differently.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You wonder what makes people even contemplate this kind of thing,&quot;
Tom Reese, an attorney for an environmental group opposing the permit told
the Times. &quot;Is he broke? Is it that he just loves the hunt?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Wetherell would not tell the Times how much he was paid by FPL. Asked if
$10,000 was in the neighborhood, he said, &quot;Nobody works for $10,000.&quot;

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA --(EnviroWorld)-- The Tampa Tribune has reported that
Florida's native panther population is probably doomed to extinction by
a lethal combination of a polluted habitat and an even more toxic enemy
- political reality.<BR>
<BR>
The Tribune said that Mike Dunbar, a veterinarian who worked for nearly
three years to save the panther in South Florida, said the real number of
panthers is close to 30 and falling, not the official estimate of 30 to
50.<BR>
<BR>
Although high-ranking officials maintain optimism that save-the-panther
programs will succeed, Dunbar said panthers have been placed in wilderness
habitats with severe ecological problems. Further, state and national parks
have fought to have panthers placed in their areas for reasons that have
more to do with turf and prestige than the health and future of the animals,
Dunbar told the Tribune.<BR>
<BR>
Many parts of the Everglades and Big Cypress Swamp are rife with pesticides,
fungicides and other chemical runoff. Mercury, PCBs and the breakdown products
of DDT are showing up in significant quantities in the endangered cats'
bodies, he said.<BR>
<BR>
Generations of inbreeding within their isolated population have caused numerous
health problems that are aggravated by the toxic chemicals, Dunbar told
the Tribune.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld)-- The Gainesville Sun reported
that Gainesville Regional Utilities and Alachua County will, by April, convert
up to 63 gasoline-powered vehicles to compressed natural gas.<BR>
<BR>
GRU learned last week that it had placed first among 17 applicants for a
$200,000 state grant to help pay for the conversions. The grants were awarded
by the state Department of Community Affairs through its alternative fuel
program. The local pilot program is a joint venture among GRU, Alachua County,
the University of Florida and Risser Petroleum. The four organizations will
split the cost of matching the $200,000, according to GRU spokeswoman Kathy
Viehe.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to 63 converted or purchased compressed natural gas-powered
vehicles, GRU will test two electric-powered vehicles. Records will be kept
to determine the savings from these vehicles. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>PEMBROKE PINES--(AP) -- The Clinton administration got high
marks from a coalition of environmental groups on Saturday for lending support
to the effort to rescue the Florida Everglades from ecological disaster.<BR>
<BR>
During its annual weekend meeting, The Friends of the Everglades, a grouping
of 30 environmental organizations, reiterated their call for a tax on Florida's
sugar industry, which they blame for harming the South Florida wetlands.<BR>
<BR>
The group applauded a memorandum issued by Vice President Al Gore to several
government agencies calling for measures to ensure the sugar industry helps
pay for the Everglades clean-up.<BR>
<BR>
``We are delighted that the administration has made solid commitment'' toward
halting damage to the wetlands in South Florida, said Ron Tipton of the
World Wildlife Fund.<BR>
<BR>
Alice Rivlin, director of the Office of Management and Budgets, detailed
the Gore memo in a speech Friday to the coalition.<BR>
<BR>
Gore has asked the OMB and several federal agencies to devise a plan ``to
ensure that those responsible for the pollution harming the South Florida
ecosystem, and those who benefit from the federal flood control and water
supply projects, including the sugar cane industry, pay the fair share''
in repairing damage to the Everglades.<BR>
<BR>
It's the strongest statement by the administration so far against the sugar
industry.<BR>

<H3><A HREF="#anchor357191">Fish farmers excluded from disaster relief</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld)-- The Associated Press reported that
because of an amendment to last falls's farm budget bill that made ornamental
fish farmers ineligible for aid for disaster relief, fish farmers are now
on their own after the many recent freezes, which have killed most of the
cold-sensitive tropical fish.<BR>
<BR>
Gouramis, mollies, guppies, swordtails, platys and cichlids compromise a
$60 million annual business in Florida, largely in Hillsborough County.
<BR>
<BR>
Federal distrust of ornamental fish farmers goes back to the freezes of
the late 1970s when some abuses occurred with disaster relief payments because
federal farm agents didn't realize dollar estimates of crop losses were
widely inflated by some farmers, said Kal Knickerbocker of the state Department
of Agriculture.<BR>

cities more livable</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO--(EnviroWrold)--Florida's pedestrian and bicycle coordinator,
Dan Burden, was featured in the January 14 &quot;Florida Magazine&quot;
for activism in enhancing the livability of cities. Burden gives lectures
around the state and advises local governments on ways to make walking and
cycling more appealing.<BR>
<BR>
Burden said that government emphasis on car transportation destroys the
idea of a community.<BR>
Among his suggestions: build narrower streets with sharper corners, make
neighborhood blocks shorter, and plant trees along roads to create a slower
mood for drivers. Slowing traffic can also reduce crime, according to Burden.<BR>
<BR>
Florida is considered one of the worst states for community planning because
many of the state's communities were developed after the automobile hit
American culture. Burden cited Miami Beach and Kissimmee among the many
bleak spots in the state, but lists Winter Park as a model for good planning.
<BR>
<BR>
Burden was recruited by Governor Bob Graham in 1980 and has since set up
the Bicycle and Pedestrian Commuter Assistance Center at Florida State University
and the Home-to-school Transportation Study research Project at the University
of Florida. He also actively promotes large-scale bicycle trails and greenways
that can span several counties.<BR>

with MacArthur Foundation</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>FORT LAUDERDALE--(EnviroWorld)-- The Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel
has reported development of two luxury golf courses open to the public and
construction of up to 2,300 new homes being proposed for a large tract of
undeveloped land in northern Palm Beach County near PGA National. <BR>
<BR>
WCI Communities, a Coral Springs developer, on Monday announced it is joining
with Golf Digest, a New York Times Co.-owned magazine, to spearhead the
project on 2,328 acres located between the Loxahatchee Slough and Florida's
Turnpike. The land is owned by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.
<BR>
<BR>
Unlike the vast majority of golf courses in Palm Beach County, the two courses
at the new, community that is informally called The Golf Digest project,
will be open to the public. That means that once they pay the necessary
fees, anybody will be able to golf there -- even if they are not country
club members or guests at nearby resorts. <BR>
<BR>
That will provide a boon for tourists in search of a game of golf who, in
the self-proclaimed golf capital of the world, are routinely turned away
from private courses. <BR>
<BR>
The planned courses will be owned by Golf Digest and designed by golf course
design guru Tom Fazio. Golf Digest also will operate a championship golf
training center on the site, located just west of Florida's Turnpike on
the north side of PGA Boulevard. <BR>
<BR>
Construction of homes won't begin until 1998, when the two 18-hole golf
courses are expected to be completed. WCI is in the process of buying the
land from MacArthur Foundation and the permitting process for the project

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- by Mitch Gibbs -- Lawmakers'
intentions to this year tighten up Florida's mangrove-cutting restrictions
may lead to a short-term open season on the environmentally-valuble coastal
tree, some state environmental officials worry<BR>
<BR>
Improving mangrove protection will be on the state legislature's agenda
when it convenes in March. State Sen. Jack Latvala is submitting changes
to the law he authored last June that allowed coastal residents greater
freedom to cut mangroves.<BR>
<BR>
Dick Eckenrod, executive director of the Tampa Bay National Estuary Program,
told Florida Environments magazine the next few months could be an &quot;open
season&quot; on mangroves.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I think it's a risk most people are willing to take to. . .correct
that piece of legislation,&quot; Eckenrod added.<BR>
<BR>
The law, written in response to Latvala's Tampa Bay neighbors complaints
that they couldn't see the water because of mangrove growth, has resulted
in over-cutting of the ecologically valuable tree. Many areas have been
hit very hard, Eckenrod told FE.<BR>
<BR>
Other officials worry that Florida's out-of-state winter residents, many
of which own waterfront homes, will decimate tall mangroves now while &quot;trimming&quot;
is legal.<BR>
<BR>
Mangroves provide crucial coastal habitat for birds and acts as a hatchling
nursery for most of Florida's marine fish. Their knobby-kneed roots also
prevent coastal erosion. According to a recent study, cutting back mangroves
hurts their ability to reproduce. Severe pruning kills the tree.<BR>
<BR>
Ironically, word that the law will be tightened may trigger a rush to trim
mangroves before the law can be passed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>KEY WEST -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Associated Press reported that
rescuers attempted Tuesday night to save a pod of dolphins that tried to
beach themselves on adjoining Stock Island, an animal rescue group said.
<BR>
<BR>
Rescuers had found 11 dolphins reportedly thrashing in shallow water just
after sunrise on Tuesday, with four of them in water only 3 to 4 feet deep
and still trying to swim toward the shore. Volunteers dressed four of the
dolphins in life preservers and guided them to a warm water lagoon. The
other five dolphins were in deeper water and remained on their own. Two
of the dolphins in the group died.<BR>

Results of lab tests on the dolphins have not yet been made available.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Gainesville Sun reported
that Browning-Ferris Industries has proposed building a garbage transfer
station just north of Gainesville that could affect Alachua County's plans
for a new waste disposal facility.<BR>
<BR>
The transfer station would receive area garbage, recyclables would be removed
and trash would be put on tractor-trailers for disposal. <BR>
<BR>
The Sun reported that BFI officials want to use the former Wood Resource
Recovery site on State Road 121, but county planners say the transfer station's
industrial use is incompatible with the area's agricultural zoning. County
officials are in the midst of developing a new disposal site near Orange
Heights to replace the Southwest Landfill near Archer. That landfill is
expected to reach capacity by mid-1988.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Tampa Tribune and St. Petersburg
Times have reported that a federal plan to restore Tampa Bay calls on local
governments to invest up to $75 million to fight pollution.<BR>
<BR>
A health report released Tuesday by the Tampa Bay National Estuary Program
identified nitrogen as the bay's major pollutant, which should be reduced
by 15 percent by the year 2010 to ensure the estuary's recovery. In addition,
the report estimates the cost of stabilizing the nitrogen could be $3 to
$5 million a year through 2010. <BR>
<BR>
Local governments are working on a plan to help develop programs that will
stabilize nitrogen levels in the bay as the population grows. The Times
reported that the programs could include building stormwater retention ponds
and reusing municipal wastewater and are expected to cost each Tampa Bay
resident about $3 a year.<BR>
<BR>
The local governments helping write the plan will hold meetings before voting
on it. If approved, the governments will sign an agreement promising to
come up with specific ways to comply with the plan. They also would pay
for the improvements, either with local tax money or through grants, according
to the Tribune.<BR>
<BR>
Local meetings on the plan will be held Feb. 22, Feb. 28, March 14 and March
20. For locations call (813) 893-2765.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO--(PRNewswire) -- Sea World of Florida, its parent Anheuser-Busch
Companies and the city of Orlando yesterday urged the tourism industry to
adopt innovative technology to preserve the environment for the 21st century.
The invitation, part of the &quot;Environmental Technology Challenge&quot;
organized by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, came at Sea World.
The challenge to adopt environmental technology is a product of a White
House &quot;call to action&quot; to American business. <BR>
<BR>
Vice President Al Gore praised the program in a letter. &quot;You are demonstrating
how government, industry and community organizations can effectively work
together to sustain our environment, enhance our economy and renew our communities,&quot;
the vice president said. <BR>
<BR>
Anheuser-Busch has embraced environmental technology by installing an innovative
system at half of its breweries to recover energy from the water left over
from brewing. This energy -- in the form of natural gas, is piped back to
the brewery for boiler fuel. <BR>
<BR>
Sea World of Florida has undertaken a program to use the best and most efficient
technology in all park operations [ see related story today ].</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO -- The Associated Press has reported that CFC-free chillers
used to cool Sea World of Florida's animal life-support systems and Orlando's
city hall were the focus yesterday of a ceremony challenging the tourism
industry to adopt more environmental technologies. <BR>
<BR>
Amos Eno, executive director of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation,
met with Orlando Mayor Glenda Hood, Sea World General Manger Bill Davis
and private industry leaders to publicize the program.<BR>
<BR>
Hood and Davis explained their use of the Trane Co. chillers, which improve
energy efficiency and water conservation. At Sea World, the chiller devices
cool park systems, including 7.2 million gallons of water at killer whale
tanks<BR>
<BR>
The chillers eliminate the use of ozone-depleting CFCs. They are projected
to save $1 million in operating costs at Sea World and almost $2 million
in energy costs at Orlando city hall.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Management contract to be bid</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)-- Leon County managers opted against
a closed bidding process that would have awarded Waste Management Inc. one
of the largest public-works contracts in the county's history - roughly
$3.6 million a year for 20 years, with an option to terminate after 10 years,
the Tallahassee Democrat reported today.<BR>
<BR>
Although one Leon County commissioner had already negotiated a closed-bid
deal with Waste Management, the commission threw out that deal at a meeting
Tuesday evening. At issue was whether the county should pay Waste Management
$24 a ton to haul the county's trash - about 150,000 tons annually of household
waste - to a Jackson County landfill in Marianna, more than 60 miles west
of Tallahassee.<BR>
<BR>
Even though the pre-negotiated Waste Management deal would have cost the
county $5-a-ton less than it costs to use the Leon County landfill, it provoked
comment and controversy by some rival waste disposal companies because it
was not put to a public bid. In the wake of the debate, commissioners voted
4-3 to instead open bidding on the actual hauling of the waste, the construction
and operation of a place to sort the garbage, and garbage pickup. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Fund for Animals Inc., has promised
to sue the Florida <BR>
Game and Freshwater Fish Commission if it does not release a large cat back
where <BR>
it was captured, the Orlando Sentinel reported today. For months state officials
<BR>
and environmental groups have argued over the fate and identity of the animal.<BR>
<BR>
The Commission believes the animal, named Waldo, is a Texas cougar that
was released <BR>
in north Florida as part of an experiment. The Fund for Animals and other
groups <BR>
maintain that Waldo is a native Florida panther.<BR>
<BR>
Waldo was first captured last March. The original veterinarian's examination
of Waldo <BR>
found many physical and behavioral traits similar to native panthers, but
genetic <BR>
tests showed that the 118-pound cat was not a member of the panther population
that <BR>
survives in south Florida. <BR>
<BR>
Officials allowed him to be sold to an animal dealer, but then learned they
might <BR>
have violated a provision of the Endangered Species Act which states that
&quot;look-alike&quot; <BR>
animals must be treated as though they are a member of the endangered species.
On <BR>
Tuesday, Waldo was returned to the state and is currently at the Florida
Game and Freshwater <BR>
Fish Commission's laboratory in Gainesville.<BR>
<BR>
Opponents to Waldo's removal from the wild argue that he could be a member
of a distinct <BR>
population of Florida panther, and possibly a valuable breeder that could
revitalize <BR>
the endangered animal. <BR>
<BR>
Rumors of panther sightings are frequent in north Florida, but until Waldo's
discovery, <BR>
evidence has been sparse. </BLOCKQUOTE>

and stress taking toll on manatees</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Tampa Tribune has reported that
Lowry Park Zoo veterinarians <BR>
and keepers are working day and night to save two baby manatees rescued
on Tuesday. <BR>
The manatees were found alone, separated from their mothers at least a year
too soon, and are suffering from what scientists call &quot;cold stress&quot;
- a problem that <BR>
causes an array of hard-to-treat infections and organ failures.<BR>
<BR>
The manatees are sharing a tank and neither has shown interest in eating
the romaine <BR>
lettuce that keepers have thrown in their tank. Because manatees get the
water they <BR>
need by eating plans, both are in danger of dehydration.<BR>
<BR>
Earlier in the week it was reported that manatee counts had increased, possibly
as <BR>
a result of the extreme cold forcing the manatees to migrate south. But
officials <BR>
say manatees are also dying in near record numbers. Scientists say if the
trend <BR>
continues, it could push the animals toward rapid extinction.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>FORT LAUDERDALE -- By Robert McClure -- Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel
(c) 1996 --<BR>
A Central Florida legislator has resurrected his attempt to let developers
off the hook on wetlands-protection rules across about 200 square miles
of South Florida. And the idea is gaining momentum.<BR>
<BR>
Rep. Chalees Sembler, R-Sebastian, would allow developers building in areas
infested with the non-native melaleuca tree to ignore rules designed to
protect wetlands. Sembler said that if three-quarters or more of a piece
of ground is covered with melaleuca, it's not very valuable as a wetlands
anyway. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The science and statistics written by many of the South Florida biologists
that have been involved in the issue supports my position,&quot; Sembler
said. <BR>
<BR>
Government scientists, however, oppose the plan. &quot;I would have to disagree,
respectfully, with Rep. Sembler,&quot; said Eric Myers, a biologist with
the Broward County Deaprtment of Natural Resource Protection. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It could be potentially very damaging to our efforts to restore and
protect the Everglades,&quot; said Dade environmental regulator Frank Bernardino.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- A compromise has been proposed
over the removal of the Rodman Dam, but environmentalists say it won't work.<BR>
<BR>
The chairman of the State Senate Natural Resources Committee, Sen. Rick
Dantzler (D-Winter Haven), has asked the Department of Environmental Protection
to consider leaving a much smaller lake in place of the 10,000 acre Rodman
Reservoir, but still remove the dam. But supporters of the Rodman Dam's
removal, which would restore the Ocklawaha River, say the idea simply doesn't
hold water.<BR>
<BR>
Marjorie Carr, the renowned environmentalist, told the Gainesville Sun,
&quot;It's just common sense; you can't have a backwater unless you put
a dam across it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Sport-fishing interests on the other side of the issue don't seem to be
taking the bait either.<BR>
<BR>
State Sen. George Kirkpatrick, an avid fisherman, has led a fight to prevent
removal of the dam, and has been successful in holding up the project for
years. Dantzler said Kirkpatrick showed little interest in the compromise.<BR>
<BR>
Several scientific studies have shown that restoration of the Ocklawaha
would be environmentally valuable -- restoring habitat for manatees, black
bears, and migratory fish. Those studies have also shown that removing the
dam, which was built as part of the now-defunct Cross Florida Barge Canal,
would be cheaper than maintaining it. A spokeswoman for the DEP said the
agency remains committed to restoring the river.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Associated Press has reported
that shrimpers won a round against the net ban when the state Supreme Court
said yesterday they can use trawls that a North Florida Shrimper and a netmaker
designed to stay within the letter of Florida's July 1 net ban.<BR>
<BR>
The court upheld a ruling by Circuit Judge P. Kevin Davey in Apalachicola
on how to measure shrimp trawls, nets shaped like elongated pouches pulled
by shrimp boats. The net ban says trawls can't exceed 500 square feet in
inshore and near-shore waters, areas out to 3 miles in the Gulf of Mexico
and out to 1 mile in the Atlantic.<BR>
<BR>
Davey and the Supreme Court agreed with shrimpers that the amendment allows
a trawl with an opening up to 66 feet in perimeter. That would be about
12 percent smaller overall size than current nets. Environmental groups
such as the Florida Conservation Association wanted a 40 percent reduction
in net size. The Marine Fisheries Commission wanted to shrink the trawls
28 percent.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- Two state senators are proposing legislation
in the upcoming session that would strengthen the Marine Fisheries Commission.
If passed, the measure would get rid of the governor's and the cabinet's
oversight of the commission.<BR>
<BR>
Critics have complained that the commission is now shackled by political
interests and is kept from imposing scientifically sound regulations to
manage the state's marine fishing industry. That weakness may have contributed
to voter passage of the constitutional net ban last year.<BR>

line around ThunderDome will cost $500,000 to fix</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG -- (EnviroWorld) -- The St. Petersburg Times
has reported that the bill for fixing a broken sewer line by the ThunderDome,
a multi-purpose sports stadium in downtown St. Petersburg, has risen to
$500,000, but city officials have decided to hold off on repairs until after
a downtown car race next month. <BR>
<BR>
Hundreds of feet of sewer line needs to be replaced, and city officials
don't want to risk having the job unfinished for the Feb. 23-25 Grand Prix
races planned for the streets around the Dome. The repair job is big enough
that a few work days lost to heavy rain could leave 20-foot-deep trenches
in the race area for the start of the nationally televised event. <BR>
<BR>
The problem first appeared after Christmas, when the sidewalk along the
south side of the Dome started to sink. Officials traced the problem to
a 36-inch diameter sewer line that was severely cracked in various locations
and had been punctured by a big chunk of masonry. Sewer service has not
been disrupted and the most visible collapsed area near the Dome's main
entrance has been stabilized. City officials decided the rest of the repairs
can wait. <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the city is considering going after the company that built the
Dome to recoup the cost of replacing broken sewer lines just 10 years old.
Based on preliminary tests, the city expects repairs will cost about $500,000.

Commission voted Tuesday to file a lawsuit asking a judge to prevent suits
against the county over the damage. The suit was filed after commissioners
learned Pasco activists were set to launch a class-action lawsuit.</BLOCKQUOTE>

turtle suit drives off-beach parking issue</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>DELAND -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Orlando Sentinel has reported
that although Volusia County officials have requested $6.7 million in state
funds to help pay for seven new parking lots near the shoreline, Gov. Lawton
Chiles' recommended budget for the 1996-1997 fiscal year doesn't include
enough money to cover those expenses.<BR>
<BR>
The importance of off-beach parking has taken on new meaning within the
last year because of a lawsuit filed against the county over sea turtle
protection. To head off a lawsuit, county officials recently approved more
stringent beach driving restrictions intended to keep cars out of turtle-prone
areas, leaving county officials pressured to come up with a comprehensive
off-beach parking plan. <BR>
<BR>
Lonnie Ryder, an environmental program administrator for the state Bureau
of Beaches and Coastal Systems, said Volusia was one of many counties to
request money through the Florida Beach Control Erosion Assistance Program.
Although some funds were used for land acquisition projects several years
ago, Ryder said the program's primary purpose is to help coastal areas combat
erosion by paying for beach renourishment or dune restoration.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;These requests that are not specifically for beach renourishment projects
are just not happening,&quot; Ryder said.<BR>
<BR>
The Volusia County Council is scheduled to discuss a new plan proposed by
County Manager Larry Arrington at a workshop on Thursday.</BLOCKQUOTE>

flooding dispute nearly resolved</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>LONGWOOD -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Orlando Sentinel has reported
that Seminole County officials are close to settling with Longwood residents
who sued over a county drainage ditch that has repeatedly flooded their
property.<BR>
<BR>
County commissioners will hold a public hearing today on the proposed agreement
with the owners of six Wildmere Manor homes. At issue is a canal connecting
a County Road 427 retention pond to Fairy Lake, north of Dog Track Road
and U.S. 17-92. Flooding had occurred for years, but residents say it worsened
with the widening of C.R. 427 more than five years ago.<BR>
<BR>
The suit sought unspecified damages and &quot;immediate measures to prevent
the flooding of plaintiffs' property.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Seminole County has agreed to pay $1,333.33 per parcel for temporary access
over the properties to work on the ditch. It also has agreed to start installing
culverts in May and to finish by July. In addition, the county admits no
liability in the settlement. The residents have agreed to drop the suit
and pay their own legal fees.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CLEARWATER -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Tampa Tribune has reported
that a $134 million plan to provide Tampa Bay with 50 million gallons of
new water has hit a brick wall: The regions wholesaler can't agree how to
pay for it.<BR>
<BR>
Although the West Coast Regional Water Authority has discussed various payment
methods, none are acceptable to the counties involved. A series of workshops
are needed to sort out the matter, according to the West Coast's executive
board.<BR>
<BR>
Hillsborough County Commissioner Ed Turanchik said one way to jump-start
talks would be to pay for the plan - including projects to dig wellfields
and recycle sewage - through study and permitting phases, rather than through
construction. This would drastically cut the cost and allow governments
more time to decide whether the projects are worthwhile.<BR>
<BR>
Options include paying for the projects based on how much water each government
uses or on the amount each government is expected to use based on population
growth.<BR>
<BR>
However, philosophical differences divide the governments. For now, the
board agreed to spend $593,500 to start studying various projects, while
the amount the governments will pay remains undecided.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Gainesville Sun reported
that Alachua County officials are pushing for tougher statewide standards
for construction and demolition debris dump sites, instead of changing local
standards first.<BR>
<BR>
Commissioner Leveda Brown said that if statewide standards are made, then
commissioners can decide if additional Alachua County oversights are necessary.<BR>
<BR>
Chris Bird, Alachua County's environmental protection director, said that
there is a need for stricter laws locally, such as requiring liners at dumps
and groundwater monitoring.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Tampa Tribune reported that a
genetically-engineered insect, part of a University of Florida experiment,
waits on a decision from the U.S. Department of Agriculture after some groups
voiced concern about the project.<BR>
<BR>
The bug-eating insect, an arthropod, would eat smaller bugs, like the spider
mite, that infest strawberry crops.<BR>
<BR>
Two groups, the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Foundation on Economic
Trends, spoke out against letting the insects loose.<BR>
<BR>
Key issues of concern include causing a change in the ecological balance
and need for further research on the effects the insects will have.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Associated Press has reported
that state farmers are continually reducing the amount of pesticides, weed
killers and chemical sprays and turning to more natural repellents out of
concern for production costs and the environment.<BR>
<BR>
Some pest-management companies are resorting to techniques popular a century
or two ago: &quot;good bugs,&quot; water-based soaps, repellents, pest-resistant
plants and physical barriers. <BR>

Researchers at Florida's Institute of Food and Agriculture Sciences rank
the state among the top in moving toward sustainable agriculture where farming

FLERA is formed of the directors and top staffof Florida's local environmental agencies.<BR><BR>Not only did Florida's DEP largely not show up, they wouldn't even respondto invitations, FLERA officials reported. However, on the eve of possiblyanother federal shutdown, the EPA flew in at least seven of its top officialsfor the two-day meeting. EPA staff sent included Regional AdministratorJohn Hankinson, his first deputy, four Division directors, a senior attorneyand the local program liaison. <BR><BR>DEP, on the other hand, asked District Director Ernie Frey to drive 20 minutesfrom his office in Jacksonville to the meeting. This has infuriated Florida'slocal environmental program officials.<BR><BR>&quot;It's more than disappointing, it's sad,&quot; said FLERA presidentKaren Collins, who is also the director of Manatee County's environmentalprogram. &quot;I sent letters to [DEP Secretary] Virginia Wetherell and[assistant secretary] Kirby Green months ago and never even got a reply.&quot;<BR><BR>Collins and other FLERA officials feel that DEP is not asking for or listeningto FLERA's input on the important environmental issues of the day. &quot;Andwe're the ones out there, on-site, working with the regulated community,&quot;Collins said. The retreat was to have increased that dialogue and set thestage for increased federal-state-local program delegation of environmentalprograms. The delegation issue is a top priority for EPA administrator CarolBrowner.<BR><BR>EPA officials were more guarded in their analysis of DEP's absence. &quot;We'regoing to keep hammering at them [DEP],&quot; said EPA local program liaisonTom Moore. &quot;Right now, we have more of a dialogue with Florida's localprograms than with the state.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR><BR><BR><A NAME="anchor663475"></A><BR><BR><H3><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Returnto State News Cover Page</A> | <A HREF="../News/FlaEnewsToday.html">Returnto today's headlines</A><HR><BR><A HREF="../News/FlaEnewsToday.html"><STRONG>GOPis warned of backlash on environment: rolling back legal safeguards, cuttingfunds could cost the party votes, national poll indicates</STRONG> </A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Washington Post hasreported that a survey commissioned by the Superfund Reform Coalition, representingbusinesses and conducted by Republican pollster Linda DiVall, has foundstrong support for federal environmental laws among Republican voters. <BR><BR>A report summarizing the results of the survey states that &quot;attackingthe Environmental Protection Agency is a non-starter.

The federally supportedprogram began last year in the area after approval by a majority of thelocal cotton farmers. It is similar to the weevil eradication program usedin Florida, and requires all cotton crops be sprayed multiple times fromthe air with Malathion, a common organophosphate pesticide. <BR><BR>While successful in getting rid of the boll weevil, the program also wipedout beneficial insects such as spiders and wasps, and led to an outbreakof army worm and aphids.The result was a 1995 cotton harvest one-sixth thatof 1994, a loss of about $150 million, according to a New York Times story.<BR><BR>Florida undertook a similar boll weevil program several years ago. Universityof Florida professor Freddie Johnson, a specialist in field crops, saidthe Texas farmers' experience was not surprising.<BR><BR>&quot;If you do spray for weevils, you do kill the beneficial arthropods(and) secondary pests become major players,&quot; Johnson said.<BR><BR>Johnson said that while Florida had gotten rid of the boll weevil, the state'scotton farmers now battle whiteflies and beet army worm. Recent crops haverequired fewer sprayings, however.<BR><BR>Cotton farming uses more pesticides than any other U.S. crop.

<BLOCKQUOTE>FT.LAUDERDALE--((C) 1996 Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel)--By Robert
McClure--A state senator from South Florida announced Thursday that he will
propose legislation calling for the sugar industry to pay a larger share
of a massive public-works project to clean up polluted water flowing into
the Everglades. <BR>
<BR>
Sen. Robert Wexler, D-Boca Raton, said costs for the cleanup project appear
to have risen since the Legislature passed a law in 1994 assessing the industry
from $233 million to $322 million. <BR>
<BR>
But $768 million is now likely to be the tab, South Florida Water Management
District Director Sam Poole told Wexler in a letter this week. When you
figure the farmers will be paying over 20 years, their current share comes
to about one-third, Poole said. <BR>
The cost was supposed to be split &quot;50-50, or at least roughly 50-50&quot;
between farmers in the sugar-growing areas and other taxpayers in South
Florida, Wexler said. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Any way you read the information provided by Mr. Poole, that does
not seem to be the case now,&quot; Wexler said. &quot;To me, the only question
is: How do we amend the (law) to get us where legislators and the water
management district thought we were when we passed it?&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)--Midwestern Congress members say they
have gotten enough legislative backing to salvage a bill giving states more
power to control interstate garbage travel.<BR>
<BR>
The Orlando Sentinel reported that rust belt legislators in Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Indiana and Michigan rounded up the support, after an original version of
the bill that included another garbage issue ran into political trouble.
The bill is important to states that have invested in garbage disposal facilities
and need a steady supply of waste to avoid economic losses.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)--Florida's congressional delegation
claims Mexico may be violating the North American Free Trade Agreement by
exceeding export quotas of tomatoes and other vegetables, the Orlando Sentinel
reported.<BR>
<BR>
Fifteen of the state's delegates, including NAFTA supporter Sen. Bob Graham,
met Wednesday with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman to discuss the issue. Graham told the Sentinel that
the best solution to the problem would be &quot;voluntary restraint&quot;
by Mexico.<BR>
<BR>
State agriculture officials say the heavy volume of Mexican produce on the
market is costing Florida growers millions of dollars. In response, Florida's
Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford has ordered increased inspections
of Mexican vegetables and heavier enforcement of foreign produce labeling
rules.</BLOCKQUOTE>

delays in toxic waste cleanups</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Florida Times-Union reported
that cleanups at several toxic waste sites in Jacksonville have been delayed
because of the budget disagreements between President Clinton and Congress.<BR>
<BR>
The federal government's Superfund program funds the EPA's cleanup of waste
sites where polluters are bankrupt or have disappeared. Without money, the
cleanups at Coleman-Evans Wood Preserving Co., in Jacksonville, and Holloway
Waste Oil Co., in Picketville, have been delayed.<BR>
<BR>
Work at sites where the businesses are not bankrupt continues and cleanups
by the Navy at Jacksonville Naval Air Station and Cecil Field Naval Air
Station have also continued.<BR>
<BR>
Michael Arnett, an EPA manager, said,&quot;I have no idea if or when any
money will be available.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>DAYTONA BEACH--(EnviroWorld)--Volusia County's effort to help
sea turtles by reducing auto traffic on its beaches will cost up to $1 million
to implement, the Orlando Sentinel reported. The county wants to add 900
parking spaces near the shore to make up for tightened restrictions on beach
driving.<BR>
<BR>
The county has imposed the restrictions under the threat of a civil lawsuit
over sea-turtle protection. The parking spaces' cost, which includes leases

Reefs threatened by demise of black sea urchins</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>MIAMI -- (EnviroWorld) -- A plague that wiped out black sea
urchins, beginning in 1983, may result in destroying coral reefs, the Associated
Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
The sea urchins ate an algae that accumulates on top of the coral reefs.
The corals, which are actually tiny animals banded together, need sunlight
to live. When the black sea urchins died out, the algae began to cover the
reefs, blocking the reefs from light. <BR>
<BR>
Scientists have begun experiments to breed sea urchins to be released into
the sea to help the problem. But before laboratory-bred urchins can be released,
scientists must determine the cause of the urchins demise.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG--(EnviroWorld)--The St. Petersburg Times has
reported that a controversial plan to activate an unused power line in northern
Hillsborough County has been saddled with at least three lawsuits.<BR>
<BR>
A citizens' coalition first sued the Florida DEP and Public Service Commission
trying to force them to mandate a permitting process for the line. Then
last week two more suits were filed against the line's owner, Florida Power.
These suits, filed by developers, argue that the power company abandoned
any easement rights when that deactivated the lines in 1984.<BR>

Florida Power contends that the charges are groundless.</BLOCKQUOTE>

hires lobbyist dream team for Orimulsion permit</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE - -(EnviroWorld)--The Tampa Tribune reported over
the weekend that a &quot;dream team&quot; of lobbyists has been amassed
by a utility seeking a state permit to burn a controversial substance called
Orimulsion in a Manatee County power plant.<BR>
<BR>
As part of their $4 billion plan, Florida Power &amp; Light has retained
the services of well-connected Tallahassee lobbyists like Jim Krog, the
Governor's former Chief of Staff; T.K. Wetherell, the former House Speaker
and husband of DEP secretary Virginia Wetherell; former Republican lawmaker
Peter Dunbar and prominent Democratic lobbyists Ron Book and David Ericks.
Tallahassee attorney Wade Hopping has been retained as legal counsel. <BR>
<BR>
Jim Eaton, a supporter of Democratic Cabinet member and Agriculture Commissioner
Bob Crawford, also is lobbying for a separate company that hopes to supply
pollution-control devices for the project, the Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Having received blessings from state and local environmental agencies already,
the permit application will be reviewed by the Governor and Cabinet in the
coming months. <BR>
<BR>
DEP's Wetherell has called charges that she's been swayed by her husband's
role in the process &quot;unfair and unwarranted.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
An attorney opposed to the plan has charged that a trip hosted by the South
American firm supplying the tar-like fuel for DEP's top Air Pollution permitting
official, Howard Rhodes, was inappropriate--but that Rhodes' integrity is
not in question.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Orlando--(EnviroWorld)--A deadly virus is expected to spread
into commercial citrus groves in southern Florida this year and may cause
widespread damage. The virus is named Tristeza and has ravaged citrus trees
in Latin America since the 1930's, slowly moving north.<BR>
<BR>
The organism is spread by brown aphids and is most virulent on sour orange
rootstock. Though some growers have already replaced the rootstock with
hardier strains, the Associated Press reports that the state could lose
as many as 20 million trees at a cost of $500 million as the virus peak
during the next five years.<BR>
<BR>
No cure exists yet for the virus, experts said, and the main defense will
be chemical and biological controls methods against the aphid.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON, D.C.--(EnviroWorld)--The Washington Post reported
yesterday that fiscal pressures on EPA will continue under the new continuing
resolution. <BR>
<BR>
On Sunday, the Post reported that the Agency's budget would be 24% less
than during fiscal year 1995. On Monday the Post reported that the budget
would be 22% lower than FY1995, with enforcement activities cut by 24%.
<BR>
<BR>
If the Agency operates under reduced funding for the rest of the fiscal
year, it could furlough almost all 18,000 employees for 18 or 19 days through
September 30, or it could lay off 3,750 employees. The method the Agency
will use to cope with reduced funding during 1996 is not yet settled. <BR>
<BR>
There is still hope that Congress and the Administration will reach an agreement
on the budget that would provide more money, and the Agency may wait to
make decisions based on reduced funding until it's clear no more money would
be available. <BR>
<BR>
EPA Administrator Carol Browner testified before the Senate Appropriations
Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent
Agencies on Friday. She said a hiring and promotion freeze has been in place
within the Agency since July 1995, and that &quot;[a]s a result of the uncertainty,
the cutbacks, the bright, young dedicated people that are so important to
our work are leaving....The lifeblood of the agency is drained. They cannot
endure the uncertainty.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Browner also said that the Republican's proposed budget for 1996 could force
the Agency to curtail enforcement and indefinitely postpone contracts. She
said that $52 million would be needed in one Agency account and $105 million
in another to avoid a major layoff of EPA staff and contractors. She said
that if funding levels are not increased, environmental research, enforcement
and compliance activities and Superfund cleanups would be reduced.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>DELAND (EnviroWorld) -- Volusia County officials will ask a
judge to postpone an April trial that was to determine the protection given
to nesting sea turtles on local beaches, the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
Due partly to federal government shutdowns, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
needs more time to finish reviewing the county's application for an &quot;incidental
take&quot; permit - a process that could have bearing on the trial, said
County Manager Larry Arrington. <BR>
<BR>
Two New Smyrna Beach women filed a lawsuit last year, alleging the county
violated the Endangered Species Act by not providing enough protection for
the nesting sea turtles. Volusia officials hoped the federal permit review
would be finished before the lawsuit goes to trial, but Arrington said that
appears unlikely.</BLOCKQUOTE>

enviro agency is alienating its historic friends</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Florida's Department of Environmental
Protection is well down the path toward alienating most of its historic
friends--including at least one ranking official within Governor Chiles'
Administration, according to an article published today in the February
issue of Florida Environments magazine.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, the grousing has transcended the normal criticism that comes with
telling a given special interest group &quot;no.&quot; Complaints now even
come from chairman of Florida's top environmental rule-making body, from
the federal EPA, from Florida's local environmental regulatory officials,
and from every single environmental group in the state. <BR>
<BR>
Most observers agree: DEP is either doing something very right--or very,
very wrong. Either way, they clearly are alone in the wilds of the environment--and
whether they are protecting it or not remains a hotly debated issue.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Breaking ranks</STRONG><BR>
In meetings with Florida Environments' editorial staff last month, Environmental
Regulation Commission chairman Dick Batchelor detailed his concerns over
the direction and management at DEP--and concerns that Chiles needs to take
a tougher environmental stand.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Some in the department think I'm singing off key,&quot; Batchelor
said. &quot;But I'm encouraging the Governor to take a stronger stand on
the environment. I am urging him to make a serious commitment to stronger
environmental protection efforts in his State of the State speech [March
6th].&quot;<BR>
<BR>
And as for DEP's leadership, Batchelor said that &quot;many times I've found
myself at odds with Secretary Wetherell.&quot; Batchelor, a Chiles' appointee,
is particularly concerned that the Ecosystem Management program championed
by Chiles and Wetherell lacks teeth. According to Batchelor, this feel-good
form of environmental regulation needs to have more bite.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;At some point [DEP] has to be able to say, 'we're not going to allow
that' to a polluter,&quot; Batchelor said.<BR>
<BR>
The DEP's lack of teeth of late is directly linked to the outward migration
of several of its top staffers. In the last year, DEP's highly respected
assistant secretary Dan Thompson left the agency for a private law practice,
water facility chief Richard Harvey took a private sector job, and now manatee-program
champion Pat Rose is headed for Audubon's Save the Manatee program. <BR>
<BR>
None of these officials would publicly condemn DEP's brass although Pat
Rose spoke in the code of the disaffected: &quot;I need to re-evaluate if
I'm in the professional environment where protecting and preserving ecosystems
can best be served.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Underbelly of the beast</STRONG> <BR>
The fact that a sitting ERC chairman is publicly criticizing his boss is
unprecedented and, according to the state's top environmentalist, illustrates
the gravity of the situation at DEP.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Traditionally, the ERC is the [DEP] Secretary's support mechanism,&quot;
says Florida Audubon Society president Clay Henderson. &quot;For Batchelor
to be saying these things is really indicative of the seriousness of the
problems at DEP.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Henderson puts responsibility for the decline in DEP's environmental performance
on two factors:<BR>
the as yet unsuccessful DER/DNR merger that formed the state's super environmental
agency, and &quot;that we have a number of former legislators [in DEP's
leadership] . . . politicizing everything. We don't have the type of people
in charge there that we've had in the past.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Henderson sides with Batchelor over concerns that DEP's enforcement has
waned--and that ecosystem management will only worsen the situation. <BR>
<BR>
Florida's local environmental officials feel that DEP is not asking for
or listening to their input on the important environmental issues of the
day. &quot;And we're the ones out there, on-site, working with the regulated
community,&quot; said the president of their organization, Karen Collins.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It boils down to power and money: DEP's got it and doesn't want to
give any of it to our programs even though we're doing many of their functions,&quot;
Collins told FE.<BR>
<BR>
EPA officials were more guarded in their analysis of DEP's performance.
&quot;We're going to keep hammering at them [DEP],&quot; said EPA local
program liaison Tom Moore. &quot;Right now, we have more of a dialogue with
Florida's local programs than with the state.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
EPA is trying to work with Florida to set up a Project XL program here that
would allow the state greater flexibility in implementing and enforcing
certain EPA programs. The notion that DEP would get more discretion has
given many observers the jitters.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, &quot;some of the choices that DEP made of rules targeted
for elimination was very arbitrary,&quot; said Collins.<BR>
<BR>
Chiles' spokesperson April Herrle says that, despite Batchelor's comments,
the Governor is still behind DEP.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;DEP is trying to solve problems, not point fingers,&quot; Herrle told
FE.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ATLANTA -- (EnviroWorld) -- The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency will hold a public availability session in Inglis, Fla. on Thursday,
Feb. 8, 1996 and Friday, Feb. 9, 1996 regarding the Barker Chemical site.
<BR>
<BR>
The availability session on Thursday will be held from 7:30 p.m. to 10 p.m.,
and Friday's session will be held from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. Both sessions will
be held at the Inglis Community Center, 135 Highway 40 in Inglis. EPA officials
will provide information regarding the December 1995 sampling results and
address any community concerns regarding current and planned activities
at the site. The soil and groundwater were sampled by EPA and analyzed to
determine the extent of arsenic and lead contamination in the residential
area. EPA encourages all interested persons to attend. <BR>
<BR>
The Barker Chemical site is under assessment to determine if it meets removal
action criteria. A removal action is a short-term cleanup intended to minimize
or remove any threat that poses an imminent or substantial endangerment
to human health or the environment. <BR>
<BR>
Persons interested in obtaining additional site information are encouraged
to call Michael Henderson, Community Relations Coordinator, toll-free at

facility, which it procured from ECO late last year. As a condition of ECO
having provided the credit facility, it retained a 5 percent stake in Spa.
<BR>
<BR>
Spa Faucet, Inc., is one of the fastest growing and profitable decorative
faucet manufacturers in the country. The company's main clientele are Home
Depot, Lowes, Payless Cashways and Home Base. ECO2 Financial, Inc. is a
recently formed subsidiary of ECO2, Inc. specializing in the leasing and
financing of ECO2's pyrolysis units. As an adjunct, the new subsidiary is
investigating other acquisition and finance opportunities, to broaden the

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Gainesville Sun reported
that Alachua County hit White Construction with more fines for dumping construction
debris near Newberry. Company officials dispute the charges and are preparing
to take the battle to court.<BR>
<BR>
The county codes enforcement board found the company guilty of a zoning
violation for the milled asphalt, concrete and other construction debris
located on Interstate 75. The new citation is in addition to the ongoing
criminal investigation by the State Attorney's Office and fines that have
been mounting since last fall for trash on the site.<BR>
<BR>
Officials fear groundwater contamination that could be caused by toxins
in the asphalt, and they say the storage of the road materials and service
on construction-related vehicles are against the site's agricultural zoning.<BR>
<BR>
White Construction officials argue that the county is mistaken in its interpretation
of the zoning codes and also dispute the likelihood of contamination. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Tampa Tribune reported that Hillsborough
County's Environmental Protection Commission issued a &quot;notice of intent
to initiate enforcement&quot; to Pinellas County Administrator Fred Marquis,
requiring that the county finish the cleanup of the Odessa landfill in northwest
Hillsborough County and restore the land by creating 11 acres of wetlands
habitat.<BR>
<BR>
The whole thing started in 1982, when Pinellas County sued the land's owner
James &quot;Bobby&quot; Martin, claiming they had dumped chemicals that
seeped into the Pinellas-run Eldridge-Wilde wellfield.<BR>
<BR>
A Pinellas judge ordered a cleanup, and appointed KBH Construction Co. of
Largo to excavate the dump. Cleanup began in 1987, but the required restoration
to Martin's land was never completed. Martin is suing KBH, and KBH is suing
him.<BR>

Marquis said that he had not yet received the letter, and did not know why
Pinellas County was being criticized for the problems.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Florida Times-Union has
reported that the last oyster beds harvested in Duval County have been permanently
closed for fear that water pollution could make the shellfish unsafe to
eat. <BR>
<BR>
Because of high levels of fecal coliform bacteria in the water, shellfish
harvesting has been banned around Talbot Island on and off since the 1980s.
People who eat the area shellfish, which has ingested the bacteria, can
become severely ill. <BR>
<BR>
This week, the DEP forbade gathering oysters, clams or mussels within the
Myrtle, Simpson and Sawpit creeks, in addition to part of the Intracoastal
Waterway. Some small areas of the Intracoastal in St. Johns County still
can be harvested, but unless the water quality improves, the main area will
not reopen, said Bob Thompson, an administrator for the Florida Department

<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Associated Press has reported
that the U.S. House voted 271-150 to reject a measure that would allow Jacksonville
and other cities to tell haulers where to dump their garbage. <BR>
<BR>
The measure stemmed from a three-month trend that suggests the city's Trail
Ridge Landfill will lose money this year due to a decline in amount of garbage
it receives. Haulers have negotiated better deals at less expensive landfills
elsewhere. The flow control proposal rejected by the House would have allowed
cities to have such ordinances in place before the court decision and were
counting on disposal fees to pay back landfill construction bonds to continue
to direct haulers to disposal sites.<BR>
<BR>
Although the deficit is projected at this point, a workshop will be planned
to look at options for resolving the problem, which will include legislation
to require haulers of commercial trash to obtain a franchise license and
use the Trail Ridge Landfill.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Mick O'Brien and Bob Sprick filed emergency paperwork yesterday asking to
halt the cleanup, scheduled to start in a month, and have independent tests
performed on the courthouse conditions, instead. <BR>
<BR>
The attorney's did receive a court order to conduct a limited inspection
Wednesday night after two rooms on the ninth floor were sealed off because
of a water leak. County officials said the leak did not cause asbestos to
circulate, but the attorney's said their inspector found asbestos and is
concerned workers are being exposed to &quot;potential dangers,&quot; according
to the Sentinel.</BLOCKQUOTE>

turns for '96 beach season</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>DELAND -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Orlando Sentinel has reported
that toll collectors began the '96 season on Thursday, by charging motorists
as they drove onto local beaches at a dozen access ramps. Though county
officials are hoping to reach a $1 million increase in sales, the optimism
is cautious.<BR>
<BR>
According to beach director Tom Renick, unusually severe tidal conditions
caused by offshore storms were one of the biggest detriments to beach traffic
last year. In addition, it is uncertain how the lawsuit filed against the
county government over the sea turtle protection will turn out. This suit
led to increased driving restrictions last year and will again to this year.<BR>
<BR>
County officials hope to implement a comprehensive turtle conservation plan
that would further restrict beach driving in some areas. With this in mind,
to help boost toll revenues from last year, Volusia County officials decided
to increase the price residents pay annual vehicle passes from $10 to $20.</BLOCKQUOTE>

to fight Ethics Commission charges</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG--(EnviroWorld)--The St. Petersburg Times today
reported that noted environmentalist Nathaniel Reed says he's prepared to
do expensive legal battle with the state Ethics Commission over charges
of a conflict of interest brought.<BR>
<BR>
Last week, the ethics panel, against the advice of their own attorney, voted
that there is reason to believe Reed's dual positions as water management
district board member and as president of his family's water supply company
violate the state's code of ethics because his water company is regulated
by the water district. <BR>
<BR>
The issue will now be heard before a state hearing officer and returned
to the ethics panel for a vote. Reed has promised a vigorous defense. Legal
fees may exceed $25,000, according to Reed, himself a millionaire.<BR>
<BR>
Reed told the Times that the defense is necessary because the charges are
groundless and, &quot;This impacts every appointment in Florida,&quot; Reed
said. &quot;This is a matter of statewide concern. It's one of these bizarre
rulings that has to be challenged.&quot; </BLOCKQUOTE>

violations of pesticide-worker safety regulations</STRONG> </A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--By Kathleen Laufenberg--Despite
tougher pesticide regulations, state inspections show many worker-safety
violations continue to occur in the agricultural and nursery industry, according
to a story in tomorrow's issue of Florida Environments magazine. <BR>
<BR>
According to state and industry sources, the regulations are not taken seriously
at over a third of the 500 Florida growers inspected.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There are enough idiots out there who would not take any precautions
unless forced to,&quot; said a second-generation nursery grower in Central
Florida who asked that his name not be used. The situation, he said, is
one where, &quot;some crazy things [are] going on.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
During the last several years, the US Environmental Protection Agency beefed
up pesticide-handling regulations in hopes of reducing the risk of poisoning
among agricultural workers and other pesticide handlers. Federal regulations
require warnings about pesticide applications, pesticide-safety training,
and the use of personal protective equipment. <BR>
<BR>
But inspections by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services,turned
up 196 violations in 518 inspections during the April-June 1995 quarter--a
non-compliance rate of 38 percent. <BR>
<BR>
Ag industry officials downplayed the results.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;By and large, the vast number of growers are doing their best to comply,&quot;
said Perry Sparkman, chairman of the state's Pesticide Review Council and
an industry representative. <BR>
<BR>
But Kerry Dressler, vice-chair of the same council representing environmental
groups, sees things differently. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's a big step forward,&quot; Dressler said of today's more stringent
worker-protection standards. Yet even now, &quot;as it's just beginning
to be implemented, they are already trying to put exceptions in right and
left.&quot; Inspection results are &quot;something I will be looking at.
It still needs to be checked regularly.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
According to the Florida Statistical Abstract, 59,001 workers were employed
in Florida's agricultural crop production in 1987. <BR>
<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON, D.C.--(EnviroWorld)-- The Washington Post reported
this week that the EPA has significantly delayed its contract awards this
fiscal year because it does not know how much money will ultimately be available.
<BR>
<BR>
Administrator Carol Browner, testifying before a Senate subcommittee hearing
last week, said, &quot;We have heard from the contractors. The ripple effects
are enormous.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The Post describes the effects of contract freezes on one Washington, DC
company to which the EPA had awarded a contract for research. The owner
of the firm wants EPA to reimburse his company for overhead expenses incurred
during stop- work periods, and he describes troubles he is having retaining
scientists and upgrading office equipment. <BR>
<BR>
In 1994, the EPA awarded $294 million in contracts to Washington-area companies.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON, D.C.--(EnviroWorld)-- According to a report in the
Daily Environment Report, at a panel discussion previewing Clean Air Act
concerns sponsored by Air Daily, John Seitz, EPA's Office of Air Quality
Planning and Standards (OAQPS), told the group that budget cuts may close
the Air Pollution Training Institute and the Technology Transfer Network
(TTN), the network of electronic bulletin boards providing technology exchange
in the area of air pollution.<BR>
<BR>
OAQPS had a budget of approximately $52 million in FY1995, but HR 2099,
the appropriations bill vetoed by the President, allowed about $18 million.

loads away from Jax</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Times-Union has reported
that Jacksonville is facing a garbage crisis, different from all other garbage
crises. Because dumping fees at the city's Trail Ridge Landfill are much
higher than those offered at similar facilities in the region, an increasing
number of business trash haulers are taking their business elsewhere.<BR>
<BR>
If this year's trend continues, Jacksonville's landfill will get nearly
100,000 tons less garbage than expected, cutting its income from the budgeted
$38.6 million to $33.2 million. Jacksonville's $59-a-ton fee for haulers
to dispose of garbage from businesses, apartments complexes and other commercial
sites is not competitive with other landfills because the dumping fee is
used to support other trash programs such as curbside pick up and recycling
programs. For comparison, State Road 110 Landfill charges $26/ton; Pecan
Row Landfill, $32/ton and West Nassau Landfill, $42/ton.<BR>
<BR>
The loss of money is just a projection right now, so city officials are
not immediately pressed to find the money. Instead, they are focusing on
ways to prevent haulers from taking business trash outside the county, according
to the Times-Union.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Gainesville Sun has reported
that opponents of the Hogtown Creek Greenway plan met along Gainesville's
NW 8th Avenue yesterday, where a trail crossing is proposed. About a dozen
plan opponents met to discuss the dangers of the plan, which they say is
poorly thought out.<BR>
<BR>
Reasons they oppose the plan include increased traffic, which could increase
car accidents in the area, and the destruction of trees less than 8 inches
in diameter, which will be cut down along the path without being replaced.
<BR>
<BR>
The greenway, once complete, would extend about seven miles from NW 39th
Ave. near NW 13th Street to Kanapaha Botanical Gardens southwest of Gainesville.
The Development Review Board will hear testimony about the proposal today
at the Gainesville Regional Utilities Building at 6:30 p.m.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>OLDSMAR--(EnviroWorld)--Pinellas County officials are pushing
for passage of a new tax to help fund the purchase of some environmentally-sensitive
lands, according to a report in today's St. Petersburg Times.<BR>
<BR>
County Administrator Fred Marquis is urging voters to reauthorize the Penny
for Pinellas tax for another decade. Part of the tax money would then be
used to buy a 500-acre parcel of pristine estuarine wetland habitat on Mobbly
Bay, near Oldmar. The parcel is now owned by Florida Power, Oldsmar, and
several private landowners, the Times reports. An estimated $17.5-million
would enable the sale.<BR>
<BR>
Marquis says buying the tract would help preserve the environment--something
the county has been doing through purchases of &quot;pretty much all of
the wetland endangered parcels that are on the eastern side of the peninsula,&quot;
Marquis told the Times. The county would build boardwalks and nature trails
in the park once it is purchased.</BLOCKQUOTE>

chief expects bigger gate next year</STRONG> </A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Tampa Tribune reported that John
Racanelli, CEO of the Florida Aquarium, expects the annual attendance to
rise in the coming year, mostly because of an expanded budget allowing for
more advertising.<BR>
<BR>
The aquarium, which turns 1 on March 31, had a gate of about 1 million last
year. Racanelli expects that number to increase by 10 percent. The staff
has hired travel writers and made deals with cruise lines and travel agents
to promote the attraction.</BLOCKQUOTE>

South Florida farmers out of business</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>HOMESTEAD -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Associated Press reported
that Mexican produce imported to the U.S., a result of NAFTA, is having
severe effects on Florida farmers. Crops rot in the fields because the cheaper
imports have caused the wholesale prices of tomatoes, squash and other vegetables
to plummet, making it unprofitable to harvest the crops.<BR>
<BR>
The effects are carrying over to other industries as well. Bankers predict
that as many as 35 percent of vegetable farmers could be out of business
by year's end. Migrant workers find that getting work is a rarity. This
affects the other businesses in the area who supply goods for the farming
community.<BR>
<BR>
Most of those affected blame the government and NAFTA for the problems.</BLOCKQUOTE>

may be result of Overseas Railway</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>KEY WEST -- (EnviroWorld) -- A University of Miami marine geologist's
study of the effects of Henry Flagler's railroad, which linked the Florida
Keys to the mainland, has shown it may be responsible for sea grass die-offs
and algae blooms in Florida Bay, the Miami Herald reported.<BR>
<BR>
The Overseas Railway, destroyed in 1935 by a hurricane, has since been replaced
by the Overseas Highway. The study shows that salinity levels became more
stable and slightly higher after the bridge was built. In that same period,
the amounts of organic material increased.<BR>
<BR>
The study's results could help find new solutions to the bay's problems,
said the state's coordinator of Florida Bay research, John Hunt. The new
data will be used, along with evidence that the increasing freshwater flow
from the Everglades to the bay have caused the problems, to search for a
solution.<STRONG> </STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

legislative changes in Florida water control</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--by Mitch Gibbs--At a Saturday forum
on water issues that the state legislature is facing, experts from the water
management districts and environmental groups agreed on at least one point:
the legislature will take major action within the next couple of years.
And that action may happen as soon as the next session in March.<BR>
<BR>
Speakers at the panel included representatives from the St. Johns River,
Suwannee River, and Southwest Water Management Districts, the Sierra Club,
and a member of the Land Use and Water Planning Task Force.<BR>
<BR>
While that task force's &quot;plan to make a plan&quot; may result in achieving
some of the goals of the state's 1973 Clean Water Act, other action may
shift power from the Water Management Districts to the legislature.<BR>
<BR>
Many worry that, if that happens, decisions about Florida's water could
be made more political and less environmental and give special interest
groups such as Big Sugar, agriculture, and homebuilders more sway on water
issues.<BR>
<BR>
The meeting was held in Gainesville and sponsored by the League of Women
Voters of Alachua County/Gainesville and the Florida Chapter of the American
Planning Association, San Felasco Section. </BLOCKQUOTE>

vows to find new enviro technology funding</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CLEARWATER BEACH--(EnviroWorld)--Florida's top environmental
regulatory official yesterday pledged to find state grant funding to develop
new environmental technologies aimed at pollution prevention and underground
tanks cleanup.<BR>
<BR>
Speaking to 150 participants of the Business of Sustainability conference
in Clearwater Beach, Florida Department of Environmental Protection secretary
Virginia Wetherell cited DEP's pollution prevention program as indicative
of its commitment to ecosystem management, a new regulatory concept that
stresses voluntary compliance with environmental laws rewarded by simpler,
longer-term permitting.<BR>
<BR>
In order to develop new pollution prevention initiatives, Wetherell said
DEP would set up grants to fund new technology development. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We need to be promoting the best technologies,&quot; she later told
EnviroWorld. &quot;If we have to raid our trust funds in order to fund the
grants so be it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Wetherell said she was uncertain how much money would ultimately be available
or how much legislative approval would be necessary.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But we've been criticized in the past as not being open to new technology,&quot;
she said.<BR>
<BR>
Asked if DEP would be open to funding new technologies applicable to cleanups
of contaminated petroleum sites, she responded, &quot;That's pollution prevention
too.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The conference sponsored by the Environmental Education Foundation of Florida
continues today.</BLOCKQUOTE>

walk through Florida to rally environmental support</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--Environmentalists are betting that
a long walk from the Everglades to Tallahassee will focus politicians'attention
on threats to Florida's environment. The 725-mile, 7-week walk, named &quot;Walk
for the Earth: A Journey for Future Generations,&quot; is being organized
by the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice. <BR>
<BR>
Walkers will begin February 24 on Highway 41 in Big Cypress National Preserve
and wend their way through the state in 18-mile segments, arriving at the
Old Capitol in Tallahassee for a rally on April 13.<BR>
<BR>
The walk will not be all beautiful scenery. Part of the trip includes a
trek through a Navy bombing range in the Ocala National Forest, and many
other environmentally damaged sites will be seen.<BR>
<BR>
Bobby C. Billie, spiritual leader of the Independent Traditional Seminole
Nation, will lead the walk. Education will be an important facet to the
walk, Billie said.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;In many parts of Florida, it is the poorest people who suffer the
most from pesticides, phosphate mining, incinerators, power plants, urban
sprawl, toxic waste dumps and highway projects,&quot; he said.<BR>
<BR>
Walk coordinators are asking for volunteers from areas through which the
Walk will pass to help with publicity, sleeping and eating arrangements
for walkers, and vehicular support for gear and food. Walkers are asked
to pay a $10 registration fee and $3 a day for food. For more information,
call the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice at (904) 468-3295.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--A look at auto repair invoices from
around Florida by state officials found instances of misleading statements
about who's charging disposal fees, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
While there are state and federal requirements for proper disposal of environmentally
hazardous wastes such as used oil and antifreeze, there are no government-imposed
fees for that disposal. Some businesses' invoices make it seem that disposal
fees are being handed down by the government, when the businesses themselves
are making the charge.<BR>
<BR>
Monday, Agriculture and Consumer Services Commissioner Bob Crawford and
Attorney General Bob Butterworth mailed warning notices to 22,000 auto repair
shops about industry deceit.<BR>
<BR>
Cases of fraud were also discovered in which some shops charged customers
for materials that had nothing to do with the service performed on their
cars.<BR>
<BR>
Under the Motor Vehicle Repair Act and the Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices
Act, the violations could carry fines of up to $10,000, the Tribune reported.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>FORT LAUDERDALE--(EnviroWorld)--The state is heading to court
in a lawsuit against the U.S. Navy over a submarine's damage to a coral
reef off Hollywood, the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
The court battle comes after the Navy refused to pay $2 million for a chunk
of reef, half the size of a football field, that its USS Memphis destroyed
in 1993. The Navy's attempt to have the case dismissed was thrown out, and
the case is now headed for U.S. District Court later this year.<BR>
<BR>
The nuclear powered sub hit the reef in shallow water, one mile off the
coast, while testing electromagnetic signature tests, the Sun-Sentinel reported.
Florida wants to restore the reef and may also add an artificial reef at
the site.<BR>
<BR>
In this contest, of course, taxpayers pay both legal bills.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--A controlled burn at Camp Blanding
caused misery for many Gainesville residents Monday, the Gainesville Sun
reported. Smoke from the fire blanketed the city in a brown, sooty haze
all afternoon and made eyes water and breathing difficult.<BR>
<BR>
Though Camp Blanding officials believed conditions were good for the burn,
a National Weather Service source blamed a &quot;temperature inversion&quot;
and feeble winds for the conditions. The inversion prevented smoke from
dispersing as Camp Blanding officials expected it would.<BR>
<BR>
The burn covered 2,000-acres at Camp Blanding, which is located on the Bradford-Clay
county line. The Sun reported two other smaller burns in the area may also
have contributed to the smoke.</BLOCKQUOTE>

of violating campaign laws</STRONG> </A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WEST PALM BEACH -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Associated Press has
reported that U.S. Sugar Corp. filed a complaint on Monday accusing a wealthy
commodities broker of breaking federal campaign laws. The broker has helped
bankroll proposals to stop polluting the Everglades. <BR>
<BR>
The complaint filed with the Federal Elections Commission, accused Paul
Tudor Jones of funneling almost $1 million of his own money to Sen. Richard
Lugar's campaign via an unregistered organization. Federal laws limit individual
contributions to $1,000 per election per candidate.<BR>
<BR>
Jones, chairman of Tudor Investment Co. in New York, used the money to pay
for advertising in support of Lugar, R-Ind., during the Presidency III Republican
straw poll in Orlando in November, the complaint said.<BR>
<BR>
The ad in question says only Lugar supports a 2-cent a pound tax on sugar
to pay for cleanup of the Everglades. Jones was a major supporter of the
tax, too. The ad was paid for by the Coalition for Good Government, which
condemned the accusations as untrue. Tudor officials referred calls to the
coalition.<BR>
<BR>
FEC spokesman Ian Stirton said it had not been determined whether the straw
poll was considered a federal election.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON, D.C.--(EnviroWorld)--Speaking at the annual winter
meeting of the National Governors' Association on February 4, EPA Administrator
Carol Browner began positioning the EPA's stance on legislation to encourage
environmental self-audits.<BR>
<BR>
As reported in the Daily Environment Report, Browner said the EPA wants
to encourage those self-audits, but must also protect the public's right-to-know,
and the agency's enforcement powers.<BR>
<BR>
The NGA's Natural Resources Committee also confirmed some policy at the
meeting: it supports giving states more power to manage public lands, and
requiring federal regulatory agencies to prove new regulations are worth

<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO--(EnviroWorld)--A settlement over price-fixing charges

The gas is commonly used to increase the acidity of public water supplies,

The issue of whether to pave, or not to pave, a path has been heavily debated
recently. Some oppose the project completely, saying the proposed path along
the side of the Hogtown Creek might harm the environment and present safety

An attorney representing the Greenspace Preservation Society said the consultant

<BLOCKQUOTE>LIVE OAK -- (EnviroWorld) -- Florida and Georgia share the Suwannee
River Basin, and officials from the two states met Wednesday in Live Oak
to share ideas for the river's protection, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
In the past, Georgia's attention to water quality and land protection in
the basin has been the source of criticism in Florida. Though 57 percent
of the Suwannee basin is in Georgia, the state's land preservation program
lags far behind Florida's in basin acquisitions.<BR>
<BR>
Georgia's new River Care 2000 program is expected to improve river protection,
however.<BR>
<BR>
The meeting, which included federal and state officials and citizens, was
intended as a starting point for interstate cooperation. Kirk Webster of
the Suwannee River Water Management District told the Sun, &quot;Coordination
and communication are essential.. . .We are looking for things we can actually
do on the ground to protect the system.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

system's Board of Regents can sign off on the University of Florida's Master
Plan--a comprehensive plan for school development for the next 20 years--UF
must answer some complaints, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to the city of Gainesville and Alachua County, local residents
Ary Lamme and Michael Escalante have filed petitions over the plan.<BR>
<BR>
The local governments are concerned that too little attention has been paid
to possible negative impacts on city and county infrastructure. Lamme is
critical of the schools development philosophy in general, but in particular
he believes the University's plans to build student housing close to Lake
Alice will damage the campus nature sanctuary.<BR>
<BR>
The University of South Florida and Florida State University also must answer
complaints about their Master Plans, the Sun reported.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>MIAMI -- (EnviroWorld) -- SCUBAmerica Tours announced a cooperative
effort with American Express and Norwegian Cruise Line to promote luxury
scuba diving cruises for certified divers. SCUBAmerica's cruises feature
supervised scuba diving excursions, scuba gear, environmental and marine
life identification seminars, and a full range of activities for divers
and non-divers alike and will sail weekly on three different NCL ships beginning
in March 1996.<BR>
<BR>
SCUBAmerica's on-board marine life identification seminars were developed
by the Reef Environmental Education Foundation (R.E.E.F.), a non-profit
organization dedicated to the protection and restoration of the marine environment,
through the gathering of marine population data for use by the world's scientific
community. Scuba divers are encouraged to participate in SCUBAmerica's 3-hour
R.E.E.F. course, and to join in identifying and charting the various species
of fish and invertebrates encountered during each dive. Results of each
dive are reported to R.E.E.F. for entry in their global computer database.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our environmental programs are a way of giving something back to the
marine environments from which we divers derive so much enjoyment,&quot;
said SCUBAmerica founder, Eric Engler. &quot;We educate divers in safe and
environmentally friendly diving practices, and take an active part in the
gathering of scientific information that will help us learn more about how
to protect the reefs and their inhabitants.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
SCUBAmerica's ScubaCruises are available by calling American Express Travel
Agency, at 1-800-DIVE-NCL. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- A Jacksonville developer wants
to build 143 homes on a 43-acre tract next to a protected swamp, the Florida-Times
Union reported. <BR>
<BR>
The area, called Cedar Swamp, is located among the thriving real-estate
markets of Southside and East Arlington. Though it is a designated management
area, which should offer some protection from overdevelopment, the project
may be permitted anyway.<BR>
<BR>
In 1994, the city relaxed rules regarding development in those management
areas, and several officials interviewed by the Union were skeptical that
the project could be prevented. A 1994 city plan for Cedar Swamp did recommend
that the city buy land surrounding the swamp, but a lone application for
state grants to do just that was turned down, and no other attempts at land
acquisition have been made.</BLOCKQUOTE>

a bond sale to finance a bridge in an environmentally sensitive wetland
area of the Florida Panhandle has been delayed in part due to the threat

A letter mailed last Friday by the Florida Wildlife Federation threatening
a lawsuit against the Army Corps of Engineers, which issued a permit in
December, has put the proposed toll bridge, also known as &quot;Bo's Bridge,&quot;

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE --(EnviroWorld)-- Gainesville's Development Review
Board voted 5-1 to go ahead with phase one of the Hogtown Creek Greenway
plan, which would pave a one-mile stretch of the greenway, the Gainesville
Sun reported. The paved area will be 10-feet wide.<BR>
<BR>
The greenway is an interconnected group of nature trails for bikers and
pedestrians. The vote came after long debates about the safety of the bicycle
path and its effects on the environment. While only the first phase of the
plan was approved, the rest of the path will extend for seven miles.<BR>
<BR>
The lone dissenting vote came from board member Charles Chestnut IV, who
said he was not satisfied with the safety issues. City Commissioner Bruce
Delaney's idea to hire an independent consultant to study the project was
shot down by both proponents and opponents to the greenway plan.</BLOCKQUOTE>

When the cat was first found by the agency last summer, tests showed that
it was a western cougar, but supporters of returning the Waldo Cat to the
wild say that it is a Florida panther. The supporters believe that officials
will not call it a panther because the agency says that Florida panthers
only exist in South Florida.<BR>
<BR>
In 1993, more than a dozen western cougars were introduced into North Florida
to determine whether the area was suitable for panther reintroduction. The
cats were removed in June.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Chiles says proposed sugar tax would raise more than needed</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>MIAMI --(EnviroWorld)-- Gov. Lawton Chiles said that the sugar
tax being pushed by the Committee to Ensure Florida's Economic and Environmental
Future would raise more money than is needed to buy land for Everglades
restoration, and therefore should be questioned, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Environmentalists say that the sugar growers in the Everglades hamper the
area with agricultural pollution and a series of canals that disrupts the
natural flow of the &quot;River of Grass.&quot; They want to buy land to
create reservoirs to mimic the natural sheet flow to Florida Bay that was
once natural.<BR>
<BR>
The sugar industry says it already pays enough under the Everglades Forever
Act, passed in 1994, that required farmers to pay $300 million of a project
to remove phosphorous from the water before it reaches the Everglades.<BR>
<BR>
Chiles called sugar &quot;a relatively clean&quot; crop, and said that the
$350 million that the proposed tax would bring would be more than enough
to buy the 126,000 acres the group wants. Sugar companies claim that the
tax would be more than the industry could handle, and might result in a
sugar industry collapse.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Injured manatees helped by Sea World </STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ORANGE CITY --(EnviroWorld)-- Two manatees with fishing line
injuries were corralled by marine officials from Sea World this week to
get treatment, the Tampa Tribune reported. <BR>
<BR>
Lucille, a 16-year-old female manatee, was treated Wednesday at the Blue
Spring State Park and freed of the fishing lines. On Thursday, Margarito,
a 12-year-old male manatee, was trapped by Sea World marine biologists,
and was transported to Sea World because the fishing line was too deeply
imbedded in his flipper to remove.<BR>
<BR>
Scientists have been trying to help the manatees since Lucille was first
spotted Jan.17. If the fishing lines are not removed, they can cut into
the manatee's flesh and work its way through the tissue, Sea World officials
said.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Seminole trail plan may come to a temporary halt</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Orlando Sentinel has reported
that a plan to create a trail system in Seminole County may be temporarily
stopped while the state Department of Transportation considers buying land
that's part of the trail system, to widen State Road 426.<BR>
<BR>
The trail corridor, ranked as one of the top three trail projects in the
state, would run through the Seminole-Orange county line at Aloma Avenue,
northeast through Oviedo and Little-Big Econ State Forest, northwest through
Winter Springs and ends at the Spring Hammock Preserve.<BR>
<BR>
The land being considered for purchase by the DOT is a mile-and-a-half of
the corridor section. County officials have been working with the state
Office of Greenways and Trails to reach an agreement of how to handle the
situation. The office does have an agreement not to compete for land with
DOT, whose needs take precedents, so negotiations will continue and the
anticipated June completion date for the trail may be set back.</BLOCKQUOTE>

may refresh Rodman fight at Cabinet presentation</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--State Sen. George Kirkpatrick is
expected to reopen debate on restoration of the Ocklawaha river Feb. 13,
according to a press release from Florida Defenders of the Environment.<BR>
<BR>
It is believed that Kirkpatrick will use Tuesday's presentation of a quarterly
report on the restoration of the Ocklawaha River to the Florida Cabinet
by the Department of Environmental Protection to once-again question the
state's restoration efforts.<BR>
<BR>
Kirkpatrick has been the leader in attacking the project, and has successfully
stalled it for several years, despite unanimous cabinet approval of restoration
in 1992.<BR>
<BR>
The Ocklawaha was dammed in the 1960s as part of the Cross Florida Barge
Canal project. The Rodman Reservoir was formed as a result of the dam and
has become a favorite bass-fishing spot. Kirkpatrick is an avid fisherman.<BR>
<BR>
Marjorie Harris Carr, president emeritus of Florida Defenders of the Environment
called Kirkpatrick's effort &quot;an act of desperation.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Enough is enough. Two presidents, two Florida Cabinets, many state
and federal agencies, and thousands of Floridians have spoken--restore the
Oklawaha,&quot; the long-time Florida environmentalist said. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--The Department of Environmental
Protection announced the results of recent statewide survey about marine
resource priorities among the general public, saltwater anglers, and boaters.<BR>
<BR>
All three of those groups ranked water pollution from industry as the state's
top problem affecting marine resources. Pollution caused by agriculture
and litter on the beach and in the water were tied for second. <BR>
<BR>
Which topics ranked low on the list? Non-native plants and animals, oil/offshore
drilling, and poor management were cited as problems by less than two percent
of each of the survey groups.<BR>
<BR>
The major criticism of DEP that came out in the survey was that the agency
needs to communicate better, according to DEP Director of Marine Resources
Ed Conklin.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>
Homeowners on that side of the lake blame those recreational activities

and other factors could be causing the erosion. <BR>

There are concerns that, if the rule is enacted, the resulting increased

Waste Management, Inc. has agreed to pay the tab for the Hipp Road dump

for some of the pollution at the site. After legal costs are paid, the money
will be divided among at least 671 people.<BR>

sicknesses and deaths in the area.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Planned sulphuric-acid plant in Manatee draws fire</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>PALMETTO--(EnviroWorld)--A planned sulfuric acid plant near
an old phosphate fertilizer plant in Manatee County is heavily opposed by
residents and the county government, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Critics contend that the new plant will increase air and water pollution
in Manatee, Pinellas and Hillsborough counties. The old plant shut down
in 1992 for economic reasons, but had numerous pollution problems that included
acid spills, toxic gas releases, and three fatal industrial accidents.<BR>
That history makes area residents wary of the new plant, which already has
many of the required permits in hand. Though modernized, the plant is expected
to produce 2,700 tons of sulfuric acid a day, 700 more tons than the old
plant's capacity.<BR>
<BR>
A question and answer session about the plant will be held 10 a.m. Thursday
at the Manatee Civic Center in Palmetto. A formal administrative hearing
will take place April 25.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Proposed turnpike extension could run through forest</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--A major extension planned for the
Florida Turnpike could take it through seven miles of the Goethe State Forest
in Levy County, the Gainesville Sun reported. The extension has three possible
options at this point: the one through the forest, along the northern side
or along the southern side of Goethe.<BR>
<BR>
Transportation officials may chose the route through the forest because
the state already owns the land, making it the cheapest option. Environmentalists
argued against the plan because of threats to the wildlife in Goethe, a
43,000-acre forest that includes one of the largest contiguous stands of
longleaf pines in the state.<BR>
<BR>
State officials have been planning to extend the turnpike from Wildwood
into Levy County for eight years. One planned route through the forest has
already been scrapped after a 14-month standoff between environmentalists
and the planners. The new forest route is said to strongly resemble the
old forest plan.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE --(EnviroWorld)-- The second annual Public Interest
Environmental Conference will be held at the J. Wayne Reitz Union on the
University of Florida campus Feb.29 to March 2. <BR>
<BR>
The conference will try to provide citizens the opportunity to talk about
environmental issues with professionals, in an effort to increase public
knowledge of environmental issues while enhancing citizen and professional
advocacy.<BR>
<BR>
The conference, entitled &quot;Making Sense of This Place: Landscapes, Watersheds

<H3><STRONG>Tampa tax payers may help float cost of Florida Aquarium</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA --(EnviroWorld)-- Poor attendance is causing financial
problems at the new Florida Aquarium in Tampa, the Associated Press reported.
The aquarium, expected to be an economic boon, has had to cut its budget
and may force taxpayers to pick up part of its $97 million price tag.<BR>
<BR>
The aquarium was funded by a complex plan that now seems questionable. Most
of the money was raised through the sale of $84 million in revenue bonds
that were partly backed by the city. That essentially means the aquarium
borrowed money from the individual and corporate bond-buyers, and must pay
them back with the money it receives from visitors. Since attendance was
well below projections, the aquarium probably will not have enough money
cover its $7.2 million annual bond payments.<BR>
<BR>
Part of the poor attendance problem may be that the admission charge is
the highest in the country for an aquarium, the AP reported.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>EPA to hold public meeting on pesticide exposure to Florida
ag' workers</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON, D.C.--(EnviroWorld)--EPA will hold a series of public
meetings around the country to assess the first full year of implementation
of new regulations designed to protect the health of more than 3.5 million
agricultural workers who are exposed to pesticides on the job. <BR>
<BR>
The regulations, known as Worker Protection Standard (WPS), specify minimum
pesticide safety training, information exchange and other safeguards for
workers who mix, handle or use pesticides, or who may come into contact
with pesticides while working on farms or in forests, nurseries and greenhouses.
<BR>
<BR>
Florida Environments magazine last month reported that over a third of Florida
growers inspected by state officials failed to be in compliance with various
aspects of pesticide worker safety regulations.<BR>
<BR>
The public meetings will provide an opportunity for both workers and employers
to relay actual experiences and &quot;lessons learned&quot; in the course
of WPS implementation. The information will be used by EPA and cooperating
state officials and organizations to improve WPS administration. <BR>
<BR>
The first meeting will be held on Feb. 22 in Winter Haven, Florida in the
Nora May Hall at the Florida Citrus Building, 500 3rd St., N.W. Persons
who wish to speak at the meeting may register onsite beginning at 5 p.m.
<BR>
<BR>
EPA will open the meeting with brief introductory comments at 7 p.m. and
then will invite those who have registered to present their comments. <BR>
<BR>
Persons who cannot attend the public meeting but wish to comment may do
so by submitting written comments to: Jeanne Haying, Office of Pesticide
Programs (7506C), U.S. EPA, 401 M St.,S.W., Washington, D.C. 20460. Telephone:

<H3><STRONG>Gainesville to force businesses and apartments to recycle</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--by Mitchell Gibbs--The Gainesville
City Commission decided Monday that recycling isn't yet ready for the free
market. Agreeing that the voluntary system of the past 16 months has been
a failure at most businesses and apartment complexes, the commission decided
to pursue an ordinance to return to mandatory recycling.<BR>
<BR>
At the Monday meeting, Gainesville solid waste director Steve Hiney told
commissioners that the main problem with the system was economics: why would
a business pay to recycle when it was cheaper not to. &quot;Social conscience&quot;
alone was not a big enough incentive, he said.<BR>
<BR>
Gainesville's recycling programs have won awards in the past, but in October
of 1994, the city changed waste/recycling haulers. Homes became subject
to a variable-rate system with garbage pick-up charges based on the amount
of trash produced--a move that encouraged recycling. But businesses were
allowed to contract privately for recycling, or not at all. Prior to that
switch, all businesses paid for recycling, and most participated. <BR>
<BR>
Gainesville recycling coordinator Gina Hawkins said the businesses may not
have realized they were paying for the service, however, because the charge
was included in their waste collection bill.<BR>
<BR>
Commission Bruce Delaney said it was time to give businesses a push they
needed.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I think they've been waiting for (the Commission) to do something,&quot;
he said.<BR>
<BR>
The change is expected to happen gradually, during the next 18 to 24 months,
so that city officials can tailor a system that can handle the range of
needs businesses have.</BLOCKQUOTE>

issued a citation to a man for a net ban violation Friday after finding
a gill net in his boat that was in a &quot;ready to be fished condition,&quot;
the Gainesville Sun Reported.<BR>
<BR>
Joe Bullock Jr. was given the citation for &quot;failure to transport entangling
net directly to federal waters.&quot; <BR>

<H3><STRONG>National Park Service to allow Cumberland Island mansion's renovation</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. MARYS, Ga--(EnviroWorld)--Barring new opposition, the National
Park Service will allow a non-profit group to renovate the Plum Orchard
Mansion on Cumberland Island, the Florida Times-Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
Some environmental groups had raised concerns about the work, but an environmental
assessment determined that it would not cause an impact to the preserve.
The renovators want to turn the mansion into an artists' retreat, and will
solicit donations to pay for the work. Expected costs are about $200,000
for repairs to the 22,000 square-foot mansion, with $10 to $15 million needed
for long-term operating costs.<BR>
<BR>
The National Park Service has set down several rules to minimize impacts
to the island, including limits on guests at parties, and a ban on air travel
to the island.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--Despite an official opinion from
the Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth, legislators opposed to restoration
of the Ocklawaha River said they will continue to fight.<BR>
<BR>
Butterworth's opinion, issued Monday, said the Department of Environmental
Protection could go ahead with restoration efforts and did not need any
further cabinet or legislative approval. While that was good news to environmentalists,
bass-fishing fans of the Rodman Reservoir were disappointed by a lack of
support from Cabinet member Bob Milligan, the state's Comptroller.<BR>
<BR>
State Sen. George Kirkpatrick and Rep. Kelley Smith both said the battle
was not yet over, however, and vowed to continue to throw legislative blocks

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--The Department of Environmental
Protection decided Monday to suspend a deal to bid out $550 million worth
of loans to bankers intended for municipal sewage cleanup, the Florida-Times

<BR>
Last summer a secret deal had been made to sell the loans to three investment
companies. When that deal became public knowledge, the state decided to
open the deal to bids, the Times-Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
But concerns that the loan program could have trouble in the long run, as
well as legal questions raised by Comptroller Bob Milligan, Attorney General
Bob Butterworth, and a Senate panel, caused the DEP to suspend the deal
until the bugs can be worked out.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Landmark clean-air trial opens</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>MIAMI -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Associated Press has reported
that an Alabama contractor and its foreman, in charge of clearing the remains
of the Homestead Air Force Base after it was flattened by Hurricane Andrew
more than three years ago, are on trial for releasing 700 pounds of the
pollutant gas Freon from base air conditioners.<BR>
<BR>
D&amp;J Enterprises Inc. of Auburn, Ala., and Raymond Phillips, D&amp;J's
foreman on a demolition contract granted by the Army corps of Engineers
for the blown-apart residential section of the Homestead base, are charged
with two counts each of violating the Federal Clean Air Act. The act prohibits
releasing, or venting, Freon into the atmosphere. The company and Phillips
are being charged with allowing Freon to vent from the air conditioning
appliance within many of the bases' housing units during the cleanup. <BR>
<BR>
Jury selection for the case began Monday. If convicted, D&amp;J Enterprises
could face up to $1 million in fines and Phillips could face up to five
years in prison on each count, with total $500,000 in fines.<BR>
<BR>
The federal government's case against D&amp;J Enterprises and Phillips is
&quot; the first criminal case in the nation brought under the venting provisions
of the Clean Air Act,&quot; according to a statement released by the office
of U.S. Attorney Kendall Coffey. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Commission recommends locating new South Florida arena to avoid
sprawl</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>FORT LAUDERDALE--(EnviroWorld)--The Governor's Commission for
a Sustainable South Florida has recommended that a planned sports arena
be built somewhere &quot;in the regional corridor between the railroad tracks
from Miami through Palm Beach. The Feb. 8 open letter was sent to Miami
Heat and Florida Panthers executives, and the Broward County Commission.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;A westerly location of such a facility sends all the wrong signals
in the effort to promote more compact urban development patterns toward
the east, leaving aside what seem to be very difficult environmental problems
with proposed westerly sites,&quot; the letter states.<BR>
<BR>
The suggestion is part of a larger overall plan by the Commission to curb
westward urban sprawl in South Florida. That plan was named Eastward Ho!
and is described as an initiative to redevelop South Florida's eastern urban
corridor. To achieve the goals of that plan, the commission has called for
improving connections to the area's mass transit train system, Tri-Rail.
Funds for those improvements could come from a 3-cent gas tax in Broward
County, the letter suggests. <BR>
<BR>
The commission, which has been active since March 1994, is chaired by Richard
A. Pettigrew. A copy of the commission's report can be obtained by calling
(305) 669-6973.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Egmont Key restriction plan upsets boaters</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA --(EnviroWorld)-- A U.S. Wildlife Service plan to limit
access to Egmont Key National Wildlife Refuge drew protests from recreational
boaters at a Tuesday night meeting, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Egmont Key, located at the mouth of Tampa Bay, 1.6 miles southwest of the
southern tip of Pinellas County, is one of the last undeveloped keys along
the west coast of Florida. It is also known as an fantastic boating destination.
<BR>
<BR>
The wildlife service says that visitors to the island are overwhelming the
wildlife and the remains of Fort Dade. The plan calls for turning 111 acres,
about one-fourth of the island, into an off-limits bird sanctuary. It also
seeks to ban people from 1,600 yards of beach on the southeast side of the
key, which borders an anchorage favored by boaters. Eventually, the wildlife
service wants to require reservations before visitors can go to the island.<BR>
<BR>
Boaters said the proposal wasn't necessary because they take good care of
the island. Last year the St. Petersburg Power Squadron supplied volunteers
to patrol the existing five-acre bird sanctuary for 140 days. Several boaters
suggested a compromise - make the northern end of the island a bird sanctuary
and leave most of the southern end open.<BR>
<BR>
Members of the National Audubon Society and the St. Petersburg Audubon Society
voiced approval for the plan. A decision on the plan is expected in May.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>BIRD ISLAND --(EnviroWorld)-- Love is in the air, in the trees
and and on the ground at Bird Island and Sunken Island, the National Audubon
Society's Tampa Bay Sanctuary. At this time of year, thousands of pelicans,
herons, spoonbills and gulls come to breed at the dredge spoil islands near
the mouth of the Alafia River, making it the most diverse water bird breeding
colony in North America, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Why? Lots of food of all sorts is available, the trees make ideal nesting
sites, but most importantly, no animals or humans are allowed on the islands.
That leaves the eggs, up to 50,000 of them, safe from predators. Audubon
caretakers trap any raccoons or possum that come across low tide, and humans
are only allowed to circle the coast in boats.<BR>
<BR>
Last year 20 species laid eggs on the islands, and in 1994, 21 species bred
at the location.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Leading environmental and consumer
groups released the League of Conservation Voters &quot;1995 National Environmental
Scorecard&quot; yesterday. The Scorecard reflects congressional members'
conservation commitment and the conclusion made from the scorecard is that
most congressional members voted contrary to public opinion and against
people's health and safety. <BR>
<BR>
Near the bottom of the scale in Florida was Lakeland's Representative Charles
Canady, whose &quot;Pay Me Not to Develop or Pollute&quot; Takings bill
(HR 925) could cost untold billions in tax dollars from consumer's pockets.
Sen. Connie Mack's voting record is show to be 7 percent and in addition,
Reps. Cliff Stearns, John Mica, Bill McCollum, Michael Bilirakis, C.W. Young,
Casey Weldon all have a zero percent voting record.<BR>
<BR>
Florida had its share of voting heroes, however, whose voting records include:
Senator Bob Graham - 100 percent; R. Corrine Brown - 85 percent; Rep. Carrie
Meek - 100 percent; Rep. Peter Deutsch - 100 percent; and Rep. Alcee Hastings
- 100 percent. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We feel the leardership of this Congress has miscalculated the changes
the voters wanted,&quot; Roderick Tirrell, a South Florida spokesman for
the League of Conservation Voters told the Sun Sentinel. &quot;They have
voted for less government. They may have voted for few restrictions. But
they didn't vote to gut the Clean Water Act or the Endangered Species Act.&quot;

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- (EnviroWorld) -- The director of the National
Park Service, Roger Kennedy, met with Fran Mainella, Florida's director
of Recreation and Parks, yesterday to discuss the federal interest in implementing
some of Florida's successful park management strategies, throughout the
country. <BR>
<BR>
The environmental leaders planned to discuss ways to exchange ecotourism
concepts, volunteer program information, growth management strategies, technical
expertise, equipment and human resources. In addition, Under Secretary of
the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration, Greg Farmer attended the meeting
to provide insight into ecotourism and public-private partnerships. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Florida park system has less than 1,000 employees to patrol and maintain
141 state parks spanning more than one-half million acres. Last year, citizens
throughout the state donated more than 529,000 hours of volunteer time to
help maintain the parks. While Florida's budget continues to shrink, the
state park system has designed creative partnerships with individuals, volunteer
organizations, corporate cultures and local governments to yield positive
results. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CROSS CITY -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Gainesville Sun has reported
that though a couple of sheriffs cited in the Dixie County dove hunt case
still maintain their innocence, they have agreed to pay the fine. Alachua
County Sheriff Steve Oelrich and Dixie County Sheriff Larry Edmonds were
charged with hunting doves in an illegally baited field, Oct. 13, 1995,
by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, along with 88 other people.<BR>
<BR>
Oelrich and Edmonds, claiming they are not guilty, initially intended to
have their cases heard in court later this month. However they decided to
pay the fines instead after being assured by U.S. Reps. Cliff Stearns, R-Ocala,
and Don Young, an Alaska Republican, that congressional hearings will be
convened to review the case, according to the Sun. Oelrich paid $525 and
Edmonds paid $400. No date has been set yet for the hearing.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Southern Waste Information
Exchange, a service of the Florida Center for Solid and Hazardous Waste
Management and Florida State University has recently become affiliated with
Keep Florida Beautiful, Inc.<BR>
<BR>
The SWIX, a non-profit service, provides solid and hazardous waste management
technical assistance to Florida Industry. Since SWIX was created through
a cooperative effort between the Florida Chamber of Commerce and FSU, millions
of tons of waste materials in Florida have been made available for reuse
through the program. As a result of the activities of the SWIX, much of
this material has been recycled, used or reused.<BR>
<BR>
During 1995, approximately 2.6 million tons of hazardous and non-hazardous
waste materials were available for reuse through the SWIX Program. Waste
generators have reported that 35,154 tons of waste materials were successfully
recycled, used or reused. Approximately 13,946 tons of waste materials with
an estimated cost-savings of $2,186,632 also were reported to have been
exchanged for use, reuse, recycling and recovery purposes from Florida industry.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Slower population growth in Florida's future</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Projections for state growth
during the next 25 years predict a 43 percent increase from Florida's 1995
population, the Associated Press reported. If that figure doesn't seem small,
consider that the state swelled by more than 200 percent during the last
25 years.<BR>
<BR>
The projections come from a study by the University of Florida's Bureau
of Economics and Business Research. The Bureau told the AP that the slower
growth is expected because of a shift in retirement patterns.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Many retirees are choosing to settle in North Florida or outside the
state instead of in Pinellas County, which used to be so popular with senior
citizens,&quot; said Bureau demographer June Nogle.<BR>
<BR>
Pinellas is expected to be one of the slowest growing counties in Florida
during the next quarter century. Many counties that neighbor heavily urbanized
areas will continue to see heavy growth, however, such as Flagler (next
to Daytona), Osceola (next to Orlando), and Hernando (next to Tampa-St.
Petersburg).<BR>
<BR>
More than 20 million people will live in Florida in the year 2020, the study
predicts.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Subsidized fishing on Lake Apopka meant to improve water quality</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO -- (EnviroWorld) -- Fishermen will be getting paid to
help clean up Lake Apopka. The St. John's Water Management District approved
a $350,000 subsidy Wednesday to pay for gizzard shad, the Orlando Sentinel
reported.<BR>
<BR>
Removing the fish from the polluted lake is a cheap form of clean-up because
the fish dine on algae. That algae, which now chokes Lake Apopka, thrives
on fertilizer that runs off surrounding farms. So taking a fish from the
lake removes a package of pollution-causing nutrients.<BR>
<BR>
Water District officials said the cost was ten times less than dredging
a similar amount of nutrients off the bottom of the lake. They hope to see
2.5 million pounds of shad taken this year.<BR>
<BR>
When the harvesting program began in 1993, it was expected to pay for itself
because officials believed the shad was valuable in Far Eastern markets.
The gizzard shad was a market flop, however.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Panther study: enough habitat to live in North Florida</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Researchers say a 28-month experiment
in which western cougars were released in North Florida has shown that the
Florida panther could do well in the area, the Florida Times-Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
The Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission biologists who conducted
the study concluded that enough habitat was available in North Florida and
South Georgia to support panthers. The study released and tracked 19 cougars,
which are genetic cousins to the panther, from 1993 to 1995. For the most
part the animals did extremely well. In fact it is believed the cougars,
which were supposed to be sterile, had several offspring during the study.<BR>
<BR>
The study said the biggest problem to reintroducing panthers to the area
would be the protests of humans. Despite widespread public support for the
endangered species, residents in areas where the cats could be released
may protest a reintroduction attempt. During the cougar experiment, some
livestock were killed by the cats, and other people fear the animal.<BR>
<BR>
However, a University of Florida survey of people in five counties where
the cougars were released showed about 75 percent support reintroduction
of the panther into the area, which contains the Osceola National Forest.<BR>
<BR>
Florida panthers are believed to exist only in the Big Cypress area of South
Florida with a population of 30 to 50 left. Because they are top carnivores,
the cats are subject to poisoning from toxins such as Mercury and DDT. Studies
have shown that many of the animals now have reproductive problems, such
as undescended testicles and malformed sperm. Inbreeding is also thought
to cause some of the animal's survival problems.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Geothermal technology wins efficiency award</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../image1000.gif" WIDTH="243" HEIGHT="183" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="bottom" BORDER="1">FORT WAYNE, IN -- (EnviroWorld) -- A custom
home in Panama City won the National Association of Homebuilder's Energy
Value Housing Award. The house's high energy efficiency was achieved partly
through the use of a geothermal heat pump with hot water recovery.<BR>
<BR>
The award was given in Houston at the Homebuilder's Convention and Exposition,
held Jan. 26-29.<BR>
<BR>
According to the maker of the heating and cooling system, WaterFurnace,
the system operates up to four times more efficiently than conventional
heating and cooling systems--providing four to five units of heat per unit
of electricity.<BR>
<BR>
The Panama City home was evaluated on more than 500 characteristics in six
categories: energy efficiency, building materials, construction practices,
water efficiency, building design and ecological planning.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to the energy conservation features, environmental efficiency
was incorporated into the home during the design and construction stages.
Landscaping considered minimum impacts to existing trees, construction waste
was minimized, and some recycling of materials was done on-site.<BR>
<BR>
The geothermal system consists of a buried piping system called an earth
loop. The loops are laid in the ground several different ways, either horizontally
across the property of vertically drilled into the earth. The loops are
then connected inside the home to a geothermal unit housing the heat exchanger,
compressor and fan.<BR>
<BR>
In winter, because the subsoil temperature of the Earth remains constant
throughout the year at about 50 degrees, water circulating through the pipe
absorbs heat from the warmer earth. The heated water is carried it to the
geothermal unit where it extracted, compressed to a higher temperature and
distributed throughout the home.<BR>
<BR>
In summer, the unit removes heat from the home and transfers it back to
the circulating water in the pipe system, The water then transfers the heat
to the cooler earth.<BR>
<BR>
WaterFurnace has installed more than 50,000 of the geothermal systems nationwide.
The company is based in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be reached at (219)

tide causes shellfishing suspension</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- A mild red tide outbreak in Tampa
Bay has caused a halt to shellfishing on both sides of the Sunshine Skyway
Bridge on Thursday night, the Tampa Tribune reported. Closing the bridge
to shellfishers prevents them from catching oysters, clams and mussels that
could be toxic.<BR>
<BR>
An environmental specialist with the state Department of Environmental Protection
said the red tide is not too bad, and that there have been no fish kills
yet. The present patchy red tide outbreak stretches from Tarpon Springs
to the Florida Keys.<BR>
<BR>
A red tide is caused by toxic algae which multiply rapidly under conditions
which are not fully understood. Shellfish become unfit for consumption because
they store a neurotoxin in their flesh. The toxin causes health problems
for those who digest it, including tingling sensations in the mouth and
extremities and loss of coordination.<BR>
<BR>
The toxic algae can also block nerve impulses in fish, causing a shutdown
of vital functions and death.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Major purchase supports buffer zone for the East Coast</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WEST PALM BEACH -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Governing Board of the
South Florida Water Management District agreed yesterday to acquire three
separate parcels of land in Palm Beach and Broward counties that will become
a major part of the District's East Coast Buffer System. The three properties
total 2,308 acres and cost a total of $19,836,320. Money for the purchases
will come from Preservation 2000 funds authorized last year in a bill sponsored
by state Rep. John Rayson (D) of Pompano Beach. <BR>
<BR>
The East Coast Buffer Plan is an interconnected series of 63,271 acres of
undeveloped land abutting the water conservation areas in Palm Beach, Broward
and Dade counties. This undeveloped land would be used as marshes, reservoirs
and water recharge areas and will provide water for environmental and urban
needs by capturing and storing excess surface water. It will also serve
as a barrier between the fragile Everglades ecosystem to the west and urban
sprawl to the east.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- In a Feb. 13 letter to House
and Senate EPA appropriations sub-committee chairs Sen. Christopher Bond
(R-MO) and Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-CA), EPA Administrator Carol Browner said
that the Agency will shift funding from contractors to federal personnel
to prevent any further federal employee layoffs. However, this shift is
not intended to occur until the next fiscal year. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It is my firm belief that further shutdowns to EPA through employee
furloughs would dramatically affect enforcement and cleanup activities already
crippled by shutdowns and budget cuts. Thus it is my intention to use the
management flexibility granted to us by Congress in the new appropriation
account structure to avoid the effect of the directed cuts in enforcement
and cleanup programs and instead to reduce contracting services accordingly,&quot;
Browner said. <BR>
<BR>
Browner added that reductions-in-force (RIFs) would be avoided at all costs
during the remainder of this fiscal year. &quot;Regardless of where Congress
may end up for the remainder of the year...we will not be conducting a RIF
this year. We have taken a series of very tough but prudent steps [to cut
costs, but] I don't think RIFs would realize any significant financial savings.&quot;

<BLOCKQUOTE>FORT LAUDERDALE --(EnviroWorld)-- With plans to build a new
restaurant on the edge of the Everglades at the Sawgrass Mills outlet mall,
the Rainforest Cafe chain is bringing its environment-friendly message to
Florida, the Sun-Sentinel reported. <BR>
<BR>
Calling it &quot;a wild place to shop and eat,&quot; the Minnesota company
announced plans for a 20,000-square-foot Rainforest Cafe to open in October
at western Broward's sprawling shoppping mecca in Sunrise. <BR>
<BR>
The restaurant will have waterfalls, exotic birds and rare tropical fish.
The fish will be in 10,000-gallon saltwater tanks. A mist system and forest
aroma help create the aura of a forest. The restaurant will seat 400 and
there will be about 4,500 square feet of retail space, where Rainforest
Cafe signature items will be sold. <BR>
<BR>
Sawgrass Mills is one of Broward's busiest tourist spots. Last year the
mall attracted more than 10 million visitors from Florida, the Caribbean
and South America. <BR>
<BR>
Rainforest Cafe has been a hot item in the restaurant industry since the
first outlet opened at Mall of America outside Minneapolis in late 1994.
Visitors to existing restaurants, the original outlet and one at a mall
in suburban Chicago, wait in line for hours to get inside. <BR>
<BR>
New cafes are also scheduled to open this year at Gurnee Mills mall in suburban
Chicago, Las Vegas and Tysons Corner Center in McLean, Va. The company also

31, 1995. Revenues for the company were $2,665,906, a decrease of 17.4 percent
from $3,228,999 in the prior year third quarter. In May 1995, the company
divested its laboratory operations and, therefore, the current quarter and
nine months revenues do not contain any laboratory revenue. Comparable revenue
for the quarter increased slightly by $2,121. <BR>
<BR>
John C. Reynolds, the company's interim president, noted that poor results

<H3><STRONG>ERC chair Batchelor still okay with Chiles, but Senate nod may
be tougher</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--by Dave Newport--Dick Batchelor
may have been bad lately, but he's still good enough for Florida Governor
Lawton Chiles. <BR>
<BR>
The chairman of Florida's Environmental Regulation Commission is in Chiles'
dog house over recent criticisms of the governor's environmental policies,
but that hasn't eroded the Administration's support for his re-appointment
to that job, according to Chiles' top environmental advisor.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We're still strongly behind Dick Batchelor as ERC chairman,&quot;
Chiles' advisor Estus Whitfield told EnviroWorld. And while some &quot;concerns
about Batchelor have been expressed,&quot; Whitfield says he hasn't heard
any &quot;substantial material arguments&quot; about him that might have
any effect on the Governor's support for his old friend and political ally.<BR>
<BR>
Batchelor was quoted last month in Florida Environments magazine as saying
he was concerned about the depth of the Administration's environmental commitment
and by the de-emphasis on enforcement within the state's biggest environmental
agency.<BR>
<BR>
But this week, Batchelor will have other troubles. Wednesday, he faces a
Senate Committee that last year refused to confirm several of Chiles' appointees
to the same panel.<BR>
<BR>
Batchelor said at the close of last year's session that he knows his confirmation
is likely to be rough. Senate leaders agree.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I have heard concerns from several committee members,&quot; said Senate
Natural Resources Committee Chairman Sen. Rick Dantzler. &quot;The concerns
are over Batchelor's style and role as ERC Chariman more than over actual
decisions the ERC makes.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Dantzler told EnviroWorld that the concerns &quot;come from both sides of
the aisle.&quot; Dantzler said he didn't think the panel would repeat last
year's attempt to embarrass Chiles by rejecting the nominations, but he
couldn't guarantee it. <BR>
<BR>
Whitfield said Wednesday's confirmation hearings were a &quot;trend setting
issue' with regard to how this year's legislative session was going between
the Democratic governor and Republican-controlled Senate.<BR>
<BR>
The hearing is set for Wednesday at 1 p.m. in Senate Office Building Room
A.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Utility contends Wetherell did assist Orimulsion project, sort
of</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG--(EnviroWorld)-- The St. Petersburg Times has
reported that attorneys for a utility seeking a permit for a controversial
power plant have argued the permit was assisted by the state's top environmental
official, whose husband is a lobbyist for the utility.<BR>
<BR>
Florida Department of Environmental Protection secretary Virginia Wetherell
signed off on Florida Power &amp; Light's permit application over the objection
of a division director whose memo stated that parts of the plan were too
lenient, according to a motion filed by the utility last week with a state
hearing officer who is reviewing the case.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Since the secretary ranks higher in the agency than the division director
who authored the offered memorandum, the position stated by the secretary
. . . would be more authoritative,&quot; attorney Douglas Roberts wrote
in the motion obtained by the Times.<BR>
<BR>
The issue of the secretary's role in the permit is under question since
her husband, T.K. Wetherell, was hired by FP&amp;L to assist in obtaining
the permit to burn a controversial new fuel called Orimulsion at its Manatee
County plant. FP&amp;L and the Wetherell's have consistently maintained
that the husband was not allowed--and has not--lobbied the secretary or
that she had any role in the permit application. <BR>
<BR>
Roberts told the Times his memo was not intended to imply that the secretary
was personally involved in the permit issuance. According to the Times story,
written by David Olinger, &quot;the utility is arguing that she did.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The Times also reported the T.K. Wetherell's son, Kent Wetherell, had been
given a job at the Tallahassee law firm Hopping Green and Sams the same
month that the permit had been awarded by DEP. Roberts stated that the younger
Wetherell had not worked on any FP&amp;L issues since coming to the firm.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Florida cows may be getting old genes</STRONG> </H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA--(EnviroWorld)--As Florida's ranchers lose prime grazing
space to development, they may begin crossing their stock with the original
Florida cow--the Cracker cow--the Tampa Tribune reported. Cracker cows come
from the original genetic stock of animal that adapted to the heat, vegetation
and pests of Florida. Though well-adapted, the breed lost out to beefier,
more valuable strains of cattle until they were almost gone in the 1960s.<BR>
<BR>
Preservation attempts have returned the cow's numbers to about 600, and
now, ranchers are considering trying to blend in some of the Cracker cow's
hardiness with their herds as the quality of rangeland degrades.<BR>
<BR>
The Cracker is directly descended from the Andalusian cows that Spanish
Conquistadors brought to the state more than 300 years ago.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA--(EnviroWorld)--Florida's fish farmers are blaming their

relief funds, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
That exclusion makes the $60 million industry vulnerable to hurricanes or
other natural disasters. It was tacked on to a 1994 farm spending bill.<BR>
<BR>
Despite support from Hillsborough County commissioners, who have asked their
Washington representatives for help, tropical fish breeders have complained
that all they get is lip service.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our Congressmen were asleep at the wheel,&quot; Hillsborough Commissioner

<H3><STRONG>Clinton endorses Everglades restoration plan; Big Sugar protests</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>MIAMI --(EnviroWorld)-- President Clinton has decided to endorse
a huge plan to protect the Everglades and restore the natural flow of fresh
water across Florida's southern region, and sugar farmers let him know they
weren't happy about it at a protest in Miami on Sunday, the Gainesville
Sun and Associated Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
The plan, expected to be announced by Vice-President Gore today at Everglades
National Park, would be one of the biggest ecological restoration efforts
ever undertaken. Over the next 10 to 20 years, much of the levees, canals
and pumping stations in the area would be erased. In addition, a huge area
of land, something like 100,000 acres, would be purchased, mostly at the
southern end of the Everglades Agricultural Area south of Lake Okeechobee.<BR>
<BR>
Clinton is expected to ask for $500 million or more from the federal government
to spend on the plan, on top of the about $100 million that federal agencies
already spend to protect the Everglades each year. But what has the sugar
farmers fuming is that Clinton's administration is expected to endorse a
1-cent tax on every pound of sugar produced in the Everglades region to
help pay for the restoration.<BR>
<BR>
A group of sugar farmers, estimated at more than 2,000, assembled at the
Doral Country Club on Sunday to protest the proposed tax. Democratic officials
were meeting privately on party business at the country club. <BR>
<BR>
The sugar companies maintain that they are already paying their fair share
to help the Everglades. A state law requires them to pay between $165 million
and $320 million over the next 20 years to create marshes to filter polluted
water. The sugar farmers say that Clinton's tax would put many of them out
of business.<BR>
<BR>
The proposed plan would have to be approved by Congress before any funds
are allocated.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CORKSCREW SWAMP SANCTUARY --(EnviroWorld)-- The wood stork,
South Florida's most endangered bird, has made a modest comeback and may
be taken off the endangered species list in two years if they can maintain
their current growth, the Associated Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
The wood storks numbers have grown from 2,500 nestlings in 1978 to more
than 6,700 in the last three years. The Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary, near
Fort Myers, is owned and run by the Audubon Society. The swamp has made
a recovery from deadly damage done by bad water management in South Florida's
wetlands, which has helped the recovery of the wood stork, U.S. Fish and
Wildlife officials said.<BR>
<BR>
Last year, the sanctuary was drenched with 88 inches of rain that flooded
farms and submerged the sanctuary's boardwalk. The flooding served to reverse
some of the damage done to the wetlands, at least temporarily.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE --(EnviroWorld)-- Spring is on the way, and with
it comes higher threats of severe weather. In an effort to increase people's
awareness of hazardous weather, Governor Chiles, in cooperation with the
National Weather Service, Florida's Division of Emergency Management and
all 67 county emergency management offices, has announced that Feb. 19 -
23 will be Hazardous Weather Awareness Week.<BR>
<BR>
During 1995, 43 Floridians were killed, 130 injured and $3.7 billion in
losses were sustained in weather-related accidents. Many of these costs
were from hurricanes. Several different weather hazards will be highlighted
each day of the week, including the dangers of lightning, rip currents,
tornadoes, severe thunderstorms and flooding.<BR>
<BR>
The purpose of the week is to save peoples lives by making them aware of
what to do when a hazardous weather situation arises.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>State official okays Orimulsion</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- A state hearing officer recommended
Monday that the Cabinet allow Florida Power &amp; Light to burn Orimulsion,
the Tampa Tribune reported. The controversial fuel has been at the center
of heated debate between environmental groups and utility officials.<BR>
<BR>
Hearing officer Lawrence Johnston based his recommendation on a two-week
hearing last year and environmentalists are not pleased. The attorney for
ManaSota-88, a group fighting against Florida Power &amp; Light Co.'s request
to convert its Parrish plant from low-sulfur fuel oil to the new Venezuelan
fuel, told the Tribune that the Department of Environmental Protection &quot;has
been doing everything they can to get approval for this thing.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Part of those efforts include a claim that FP&amp;L lobbyist T.K. Wetherell
has influenced his wife and DEP secretary Virginia Wetherell over the issue.
Those claims were bolstered yesterday when the St. Petersburg Times reported
that a division director in the DEP, who had raised objections to the permit,
was ignored by Wetherell.<BR>
<BR>
Orimulsion's opponents claim it will produce twice as much smog-causing
nitrogen oxide, putting Pinellas and Hillsborough counties over the federal
limit on ozone and nullify successful efforts to reduce pollution. In addition,
there is some concern that if Orimulsion spills in Tampa Bay, its emulsion
properties could cause a wide disbursement, making cleanup difficult.<BR>
<BR>
Proponents of Orimulsion agree that the fuel could increase nitrogen oxide,
but say it will produce less sulfur dioxide. In addition FP&amp;L has cited
a $4 billion to $6 billion cost savings for itself over 20 years if Orimulsion
is approved, though opponents say that claim is false.<BR>
<BR>
Manatee County Commission still could affect the utility's plans however,
despite the recommendation. The commission and FP&amp;L must reach an agreement
on port tariffs and on water reuse to limit water withdraws from the Little
Manatee River, reported the Tribune.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I can't see how a government body can issue a permit as long as there
are unresolved issues,&quot; Commissioner Joe McClash told the Tribune.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ONA -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Tampa Tribune has reported that
crews worked Monday to soak up gasoline and remove saturated dirt after
a tanker overturned Sunday on State Road 64, spilling more than 2,000 gallons
of fuel. <BR>
<BR>
Nearly a mile stretch of S.R. 64 , eight miles west of Ona, was closed to
traffic for most of Sunday and Monday. But Jack Gibson of the Department
of Transportation was expecting one lane to open up Monday night. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Swiftmud and Pinellas County get ready to meet in court</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Tampa Tribune has reported that
the Southwest Florida Water Management District filed a petition on Friday
in Hillsborough Circuit Court against Pinellas County's lawyers, saying
they feel are refusing to turn over public records.<BR>
<BR>
However, the law firm that represents Pinellas County in the water wars,
de la Parte, Gilbert &amp; Bales, contends they have turned all public records
over and have only refused to turn over private documents to the district.
<BR>
<BR>
The battle now must be settled by Circuit Judge Robert Bonanno. He must
decide if the law firm is violating the law and if the records they call
private, are in fact public.<BR>
<BR>
The water district is looking for the documents that Pinellas County relied
on to support the county's request for a hearing on four wellfield permits.
The county has challenged permit levels established by the water management
district. Ed de la Parte, of the firm, claims the district is just trying
to figure out his legal strategy before a hearing date is set, the Tribune
reported.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CLEARWATER -- (EnviroWorld) -- As the Southwest Florida Water
Management District and the West Coast Regional Water Supply Authority prepare
for an anticipated four-week battle in May over restrictions the district
has proposed for regional wellfields, both parties are considering to abide
by an independent scientific review of the regions water problems.<BR>
<BR>
Peter Hubbell, water district executive director, said he would recommend
the review only if conclusions are limited to scientific issues. With this
review about to take place, possibly by the National Academy of Sciences
in Washington, all litigation between the agencies will be put on hold,
Hubbell reported to the Tribune.<BR>
<BR>
West Coast officials are divided over whether the scientific review should
put that litigation on hold. The counties involved include, Pinellas, Pasco
and Hillsborough, as well as Tampa and St. Petersburg.</BLOCKQUOTE>

plans to complete a controversial nuclear power plant during a meeting with
Robert and Michael Kennedy, the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
The two sons of Robert F. Kennedy said that even the perception of an unsafe
reactor could hurt Cuba's tourism economy. According to the story, reported
by Reuters, the plant is a sensitive issue in U.S.-Cuban relations. The
governments of Cuba and Russia have announced plans to complete the reactor,
but need a third partner both for financial and technical assistance. The
plant is located in south central Cuba, near Cienfuegos.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Gore backs reduction of sugar subsidies to pay for Everglades
cleanup</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK--(EnviroWorld)--Vice President Gore
offered generous federal support for Everglades restoration Monday, and
also backed a plan to make the state's sugar industry pick up part of the
tab, the Associated Press and Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
Gore pledged $400 million in federal green, spread over the next four years,
for what will be the largest ecological restoration project in U.S. history.
In addition, Gore backed proposed increases in the budgets for federal agencies
involved in the project. All together, the Clinton Administration proposal
is expected to cost $1.5 billion.<BR>
<BR>
The money is to be used to buy and convert more than 100,000 acres of land,
mostly sugar cane fields, back to marsh.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What we are announcing is more then a restoration plan,&quot; Gore
said, &quot;It is, in its purest sense, an investment in Florida's future.
It is an investment in America's furture. We cannot fail to make this investment.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
To the anger of Florida's sugar growers, that plan will also cost them a
pretty penny. Runoff from sugar plantations and alterations to the Everglades
landscape by sugar farmers have contributed heavily to the ecological damage
in the River of Grass. As a result, Gore said the industry should lose one
penny of it's federal subsidy for every pound of sugar it produces. That
&quot;tax&quot; is expected to raise $245 million over seven years.<BR>
<BR>
In a Gainesville Sun story about Washington's political spin on the issue,
it was reported that Florida's 25 electoral votes may be playing a part
in the bipartisan support of Everglades cleanup funds. However, Republicans
now may seek to get back $200 million that has been pledged in the Senate
for the project's land acquisition.<BR>

<H3><STRONG>Goethe State Forest shouldn't get paved</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--Goethe State Forest in Levy County
is on one proposed path of a Florida Turnpike extension, but is ecologically
valuable, a Gainesville Sun feature article points out.<BR>
<BR>
The 43,000 acre forest was bought by the state in 1992 and is one of the
three largest longleaf pine ecosystems in Florida. The longleaf pine, a
source of valuable heartpine wood, once covered the southeast, but rapidly
lost out to settlement and was replaced by faster growing pine species.
The tree is foundation of an ecosystem which includes such prized species
as the Sherman's fox squirrel, gopher tortoise, indigo snake, and red-cockaded
woodpecker. A scientist studying the endangered bird has found 26 separate
woodpecker habitats with mating pairs in Goethe.<BR>
<BR>
The Florida Department of Transportation favors a road route that would
bisect the forest, the Sun reported.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--Attorneys for Florida Rock Industries
are questioning members of the Haile Community Association, a group opposed
to the company's plans to build a cement plant near Newberry in Alachua
County, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
The attorneys said the questioning was a routine procedure to assess whether
the group had any legal standing, but some group members complained the
company was trying to &quot;destroy our membership.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The Haile community Association has filed an administrative challenge to
the state's decision to issue a permit for the plant's air emissions. Testimony
on the challenge is scheduled for Monday, March 1 at the Doyle conner Building
on SW 34th Street in Gainesville. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<STRONG>Report finds potential problems with &quot;non-hazardous&quot; holding
ponds</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>MINNEAPOLIS--(EnviroWorld)--A private study cites industrial
ponds used for non-hazardous waste as widely under regulated and a potentially
expensive pollution problem in the future.<BR>
<BR>
The study reviewed state regulations across the nation for industrial surface
impoundments--pits, ponds, lagoons used to treat and store wastewater and
other nonhazardous waste. The research turned up many states where these
impoundments lack basic pollution prevention measures such as liners and
leachate collection systems. <BR>
<BR>
In eight states, regulatory officials reported that groundwater contamination
was a common problem with the holding ponds. <BR>
<BR>
The time is ripe to focus attention on surface water impoundments because
of EPA's proposed Hazardous Waste Identification Rule. That rule would deregulate
some wastes that currently fall under strict RCRA rules for disposal and
allow them to be disposed of in state-regulated non-hazardous sites, e.g.
surface water impoundments.<BR>
<BR>
Cary Perket, president of the firm that conducted the research, said, &quot;In
the specific case of the HWIR proposal, it means that there is often no
assurance to the public that these more concentrated industrial wastes will
not be sent to inadequate facilities lacking environmental protection.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The market research report contains state by state information and is titled
&quot;Nonhazardous Industrial Surface Impoundments: State Regulations and
the Environmental Marketplace.&quot; It can be obtained from Environmental
Information Ltd.--phone 612/831-2473, fax 612/831-6550, or e-mail ei@mr.net.

<H3><STRONG>Fourth death of endangered whale off Jax</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>BRUNSWICK--(EnviroWorld)--The right whale is getting off to
a rough start this calving season. Four of the endangered animals, which
come to the waters off Jacksonville to give birth during winter, have been
found dead since Jan. 2, the Florida Times-Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
The latest, a female calf, was found Monday morning by a biologist involved
in survey operations organized prevent ship collisions with the animals.
A necropsy of the calf found pneumonia and a ruptured ear drum, but no cause
of death has been determined. At least one of the four whales died from
a ship collision.<BR>
<BR>
The size of the right whale population is believed to be about 300. Scientists
said this years calving season was still promising because the number of
birthing mothers had increased from seven last season to 10 this year.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Florida farmers organizing against Mexican imports</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO--(EnviroWorld)--Several groups representing the state's
farming interests are banding together, hoping for a louder voice in their
complaints about NAFTA and Mexican produce imports, the Orlando Sentinel
reported.<BR>
<BR>
The Grown in the USA Coalition, as the collective groups call themselves,
complains that provisions in NAFTA do not go far enough to protect domestic
price crashes caused by heavy imports. The Coalition intends to wage a public
information campaign and lobby for legislation. <BR>
<BR>
Last month, state tomato growers became agitated as prices dropped sharply
due to high volumes of Mexican tomatoes on the market. The complaints spurred
the state Agriculture Department to crack-down on the state's foreign-produce
labeling regulations.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--Dick Batchelor is likely to take
a few lumps today--he will be facing the state Senate confirmation committee
that last year bashed some of his fellow appointees to the Environmental
Regulatory Commission.<BR>
<BR>
Those gubernatorial appointees did not win approval by the confirmation
committee, and the Senate may try to embarrass Gov. Chiles again this year.<BR>
<BR>
Chiles has maintained support for Batchelor despite the fact that the ERC
chairman has been critical of the Governor's environmental policies.<BR>

The hearing is set for 1 p.m. in Senate Office Building Room A.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Southern States Utilities must pay back $8.2 million, PSC decides</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--The Public Service Commission is
sticking by an earlier decision to make Florida's largest water and sewer
company, Southern States Utilities, pay back $8.2 million in overcharges,
The St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
The payback applies to customers in Citrus and Hernando counties, and could
amount to refunds of up to $1000 for individuals. Court appeals to the decision
are likely to delay those checks for a long time, the Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
SSU is a conglomerate of about 150 utilities that span the state. It has
applied to the PSC for a rate increase that would bring in about $8.7 million
in water and wastewater revenues. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>DOT pays a half-million to acquire property promised as a donation</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG--(EnviroWorld)--A developer who promised to donate
22 acres of right-of-way for the future Suncoast Parkway wound up getting
$475,000 for the land, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Despite promises which seemed unconditional before a Metropolitan Planning
Board that the land would be free, strings were attached. Unable to meet
the demands of the developer, who built the nearby Silverthorn development,
the DOT ultimately paid for the land, though officials contend they still
got it for a bargain.<BR>
<BR>
The Times reported that the original offer may have been a ruse to enable
a controversial rerouting of the planned highway.<BR>
<BR>
The Suncoast Parkway will eventually leak Tampa to central Pasco and Hernando
counties.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Record amount of manatees alive, record amount dying</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA --(EnviroWorld)-- Marine scientists found 2,636 manatees,
a record, while counting the endangered species along the coast this week,
the Tampa Tribune reported. That total beats the 2,274 counted in January.
But to go along with that record, the manatees are also dying in record
numbers.<BR>
<BR>
By the first week of February, 46 manatees had died this year. A spokeswoman
with the state Department of Environmental Protection, Joy Mills, said the
increased numbers of deaths might be because there are simply more manatees
off the coast.<BR>
<BR>
The increased sightings are due to the cold weather. When it is cold, scientists
know where to look for the manatees, because they group near warm-water
outfalls at power plants and natural springs.<BR>
<BR>
The manatee studies have also shown that more of them live and die in Brevard,
Broward, Lee and Palm Beach Counties, areas where there is high boat traffic.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Plan to develop east side of Alachua County causes debate</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE --(EnviroWorld)-- A proposed 209-home development
on the east side of Alachua County has revived debates over rural development,
the Gainesville Sun reported. County planners feel the proposed density
of the development is too great for the area. <BR>
<BR>
The developers, Thompson Group, feel there is very little difference between
the 209-home plan they put forth and a county cap of 128 homes. The county
staff would recommend approval if the number were kept to that and development
proceeded over two years.<BR>
<BR>
The planners see the concentration creating increased demands for waste
collection and public schools, as well as police and fire-rescue services.
The developer's vice-president, George Rosko, said the concerns are overstated.<BR>
<BR>
Another point of concern between the county planners and the developers
is the management of greenspace required to be set aside. Developers are
required to set aside 80 percent of the property for recreation and low-intensive
agricultural use in situations like these. The land is usually set aside
in one adjoining section. The developers in this case want to include some
open space on the back of individual lots.<BR>
<BR>
The plan revives a debate over development of rural areas similar to the
concerns over the 150-home development that was proposed near Kanapaha Prairie
in late 1994. That development was rejected by county commissioners by a
3-2 vote. The issues in that case were pressure on government services and
the environment.<BR>
<BR>
The new proposal goes before the County Planning Commission tonight at 7:30
in the county administration building. The county commissioners will hear
it on Tuesday night.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Plan set to give Florida Aquarium some company</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA --(EnviroWorld)-- Tampa Port officials are happy with
a proposed development at Garrison Seaport Center, which would bring a 20-screen
movie theater, six restaurants and various shops to thearea that houses
the Florida Aquarium, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
The board approved the letter of intent for writing a lease with developers
Hogan-Burt on the 3.2-acre site. The planned complex would be two-stories
high. The port authority will clear the site and build surrounding roads
and common areas at an estimated cost of $875,000. <BR>
<BR>
The hope is that the movie theater alone will attract 1 million people to
the Garrison Sea Center, which currently houses the aquarium, cruise ship
terminals and a fast food kiosk. The aquarium has had financial troubles
since opening a year ago because of poor attendance.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>ESPN will highlight snook-saving marine biologists</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE --(EnviroWorld)-- ESPN's &quot;Mark Sosin's Saltwater
Journal&quot; will detail the efforts of marine biologists from the Department
of Environmental Protection's Florida Marine Research Institute. Their work
on the preservation of Florida's snook species in the late 1980s has been
recognized as one of the few fishery management successes in the country.<BR>
<BR>
There are four species of snook in Florida, with the common snook being
the favorite of recreational fishers. People from all over the world come
to Florida to fish for snook, which are considered the number-one South
Florida inshore sports fish. <BR>
<BR>
Intense commercial and recreational fishing in the 1930s, '40s and '50s
depleted snook stocks. Regulations passed in the 1950s were aimed at protecting
and preserving the snook population, but by the mid-1970s few large fish
remained. The state's DEP Division of Marine Resources began assessing snook
in 1975. In the 1980s, the DEP asked the governor to approve regulations
to protect the quickly dwindling snook stock, which included cutting down
the number of fish that could be caught per day and increasing the size
limit. The snook have since made a successful recovery.<BR>

<H3><STRONG>Commercial King mackerel harvesting closed </STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE --(EnviroWorld)-- The Department of Environmental
Protection announced that the commercial harvesting of King mackerel in
state waters is closed on the western region of the Gulf-Atlantic, effective
Feb. 21, 1996.<BR>
<BR>
Also, the National Marine Fisheries Service announced that commercial harvesting
of King mackerel in federal waters will be closed in the Florida west coast
sub-zone beginning today. The closure was called for after the regional
director determined that 100 percent of the quota, 865,000 pounds, would
be reached on Feb.20.<BR>
<BR>
The closure applies to all vessels fishing for King mackerel in state waters
from the Florida/Alabama state line to the Dade/Monroe county line until
March 31, 1996 and the Collier/Monroe county line until June 30, 1996.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<STRONG>Batchelor bashed by Senate, confirmation in jeopardy</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- by Dave Newport -- A hostile
and combative State Senate committee slapped Florida Governor Lawton Chiles
in the face and handed one of his top appointees his walking papers yesterday.
Pending a political miracle, Dick Batchelor will not be confirmed as chairman
of Florida's top environmental rulemaking body.<BR>
<BR>
Batchelor, an old friend and political ally of the Governor, came under
attack from Senators and another old friend yesterday. Jodi Chase, a senior
lobbyist with Associated Industries of Florida, the state's biggest business-lobby
organization, told the senators that although &quot;I do not attend ERC
meetings, I have been told of many problems in the way Batchelor runs the
meetings.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Chase, who said she was good friends with Batchelor and his family, then
went on to detail a series of complaints about Batchelor that &quot;people
have told me about.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Batchelor was incensed by the hearsay complaints Chase and state Senators
lodged against him.<BR>
<BR>
Directing his comments to Committee Chairman Rick Dantzler, Batchelor characterized
the attacks as &quot;whisperings&quot; that have no basis in fact and no
names associated with the accusers. An unruly and contentious Senator Charles
Williams then stood up, cut off Batchelor and moved the meeting be adjourned.<BR>
<BR>
But environmentalists also came forward and criticized the ERC as not sensitive
enough to peoples' concerns. However, they were more critical of legislators'
decisions to limit the power of the ERC than of Batchelor's chairmanship.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We wonder why anyone would want to be on the ERC,&quot; said Taylor
County activist Joy Toole-Cummings. &quot;You [Senators] took away what
little power they had to protect the environment last year. Who do we turn
to now?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In the end however, it was concerns over a perceived rift between Batchelor
and Florida's top environmental official Virginia Wetherell that was echoed
as problematic to Senators. Wetherell was not at the meeting. Lt. Governor
Buddy MacKay phoned Chairman Dantzler just before the meeting to indicate
the Administration's support for Batchelor and that Batchelor and Wetherell
had mended fences.<BR>
<BR>
The committee approved five of Chiles' seven appointees. Batchelor and Nancy
Roen's hearing has been tabled until later in the session.<BR>
<BR>
After the meeting, Batchelor called his detractors &quot;phantoms&quot;
working for the regulated industries<BR>
&quot;that don't like the rules we've passed.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
This is the second time in as many years that the Republican-controlled
Senate has publicly humiliated a Chiles' appointee. Last year's rejection
of HRS secretary-nominee James Towey by the Senate was very embarrassing
to the Governor.<BR>
<BR>
This year, Chiles and MacKay have vowed to push hard for Batchelor's confirmation
but a majority of Senators were critical of Batchelor yesterday. The session
starts March 5.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Opponents to Alachua cement plant lose court challenge</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- A citizens' group lost a court
challenge over zoning requirements Tuesday in an attempt to block a controversial
cement plant from being built, the Gainesville Sun reported. An Alachua
County circuit judge ruled that some industrial uses were allowed in the
area near Newberry, which is zoned for agriculture.<BR>
<BR>
The Florida Rock cement plant is designed to produce 750,000 tons of cement
per year, but citizens have objected to it on the grounds that it will cause
air pollution and disrupt the quality of nearby residents' lives.<BR>
<BR>
Judge Nath Doughtie determined that the plant's benefit to the local economy
&quot;substantially outweighs the minimal impact . . . on the environment.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Citizens are still challenging the plant over the state's approval of its
air permit. That challenge will be heard during a state administrative hearing
next week in Gainesville.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Federal lawsuit filed over Rainbow gathering in Osceola National
Forest</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>OSCEOLA NATIONAL FOREST--(EnviroWorld)--The U.S. Attorney's
office has filed a lawsuit to end the Rainbow gathering in Osceola National
Forest, the Florida Times-Union reported. The suit argues that the group
needs a permit to gather in the forest. <BR>
<BR>
The Rainbow Family is a large and barely organized group of people who gather
in the forest for a retreat from the civilized world. Rarely are significant
problems associated with the gathering, but their large numbers have irritated
the Forest Service, which says the gatherings have some negative impacts
on the forest.<BR>
<BR>
Because the Rainbows have no formal organization, it is unlikely any court
action can stop the gathering before it ends on its own.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>EPA is presented &quot;Panic at the drop of a rat&quot; award</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Competitive Enterprise
Institute will present the EPA the &quot;Panic at the Drop of a Rat&quot;
award today commemorating the EPA's destruction of the town of Times Beach,
Missouri. The award is a symbol of how government policy and action can
be made on the basis of shoddy or insufficient scientific evidence. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It is a shame that the EPA put Times Beach on the map by wiping it
off the map,&quot; explained Julie DeFalco, CEI Policy Analyst. &quot;We
are doing this to remind the public of the dangers of incorporating the
'Precautionary Principle' -- the idea that it is always better to be overcautious
-- into public policy,&quot; she added.<BR>
<BR>
The EPA's decision to buy out the town, issued thirteen years ago today,
on Feb. 22, 1983, was based on supposedly high risks resulting from dioxin
contamination. But some scientific studies have found that dioxin's danger
to humans is overblown, according to CEI.<BR>
<BR>
CEI will formally petition the National Park Service today to designate
Times Beach as a National Historic Landmark. In addition, CEI has produced
a television documentary, Science Under Siege, that examines the Times Beach
story in detail.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>DEP at odds with island residents over bridge</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>HOLMES BEACH -- (EnviroWorld) -- Residents of Anna Maria island
have won a battle with the DEP over a proposed high-span bridge, the Tampa
Tribune reported. For five years the residents have protested the replacement
of a deteriorating drawbridge with the newer bridge. This week a state hearing
officer issued a report siding with the islanders.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;A fixed-span, high-level bridge would likely destroy acres of seagrass,
jeopardize water quality, endanger the already-threatened manatee, adversely
affect the estuarine resources of Sarasota pass and detract from the island
ambience,&quot; hearing officer Robert Meal wrote.<BR>
<BR>
But DEP Environmental Resources Program Manager Bob Stettler said the DEP
was still backing the proposed bridge. It is not clear whether DEP has the
authority to ignore the ruling.<BR>
<BR>
Ironically, the DEP refused to grant a dredge-and-fill permit for the very
same bridge when the proposal first came along, and cited reasons similar
to citizen arguments. But the department changed its position without explanation
two years later and roused anger among the island residents.<BR>
<BR>
Many of those residents believe the change came out of pressure from Gov.
Chiles, whose family owns three restaurants on the island, the Tribune reported.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Everglades proposal may not make it past Congress</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- Though the Clinton administration
unveiled it's Everglades cleanup plan this week, The Orlando Sentinel has
reported that it may not pass through Congress. In addition, there is talk
that the announcement is just a political ploy from the administration.
<BR>
<BR>
The plan to cleanup the Everglades was announced by Vice President Al Gore
on Monday, but details have been sketchy and no one is exactly sure how
the plan will be paid for. However, according to Peggy Wilhide, Gore's press
secretary, the administration is trying to work out a legislative strategy
or a key person to fight for the plan in a Republican-controlled Congress.
<BR>
<BR>
U.S. Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., who is a member of the Senate Appropriations
Committee, could be a key to getting the plan through Congress, according
to the Orlando Sentinel. <BR>
<BR>
However, Mack said that he had not been officially briefed on the plan.
Gov. Chiles and Sen. Bob Graham also said they were in the dark, having
only heard about the plan through media reports.<BR>
<BR>
Concerns with the implementation of the Clinton administration's plan stem
from lawmakers doubts that there will be money to pay for the $1.56 billion
project. In, Gore's announcement, however, some ways to pay for the cleanup
were suggested, including the penny-per-pound tax on Florida sugar growers.

<STRONG>City proposes cutting commercial landfill rate</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Florida Times Union has
reported that after a Jacksonville landfill lost many of its customers,
city officials have proposed a decrease in disposal fees, making it more
competitive with other area landfills.<BR>
<BR>
Trail Ridge Landfill charges $59-a-ton, but Mayor John Delaney has agreed
to cut the fee by as much as $20-a-ton to help level off losses, said spokeswoman
Susan Wiles. The landfill has been losing funds because of the decrease
in amount of deposited garbage. Three other major Jacksonville haulers are
taking loads outside the county to less expensive landfills in North Florida
and South Georgia, according to the Times Union. <BR>
<BR>
In the past, the city faced an ordinance that required businesses to dispose
of garbage at the Jacksonville landfill, but the U.S. Supreme Court had
ruled in 1994 that city's could not require that businesses haul trash to
a specific landfill. For example, company's such as Kimmins Recycling Corp.,
BFI Waste Systems and Southland Waste Systems presently haul garbage to
a less-expensive landfill.<BR>
<BR>
If a change in the Trail Ridge Landfill fee is an option, then the City
Council must approve it.</BLOCKQUOTE>

About 30 gallons of gasoline escaped from the pump, but was contained in

<BLOCKQUOTE>CRYSTAL RIVER --(EnviroWorld)-- Community and government leaders
from the Nature Coast will get to experience what nature is really like,
thanks to a $9,000 state grant awarded to the Nature Coast Chamber of Commerce.
The Chamber of Commerce gave the money to the Marine Science Station, which
will host six environmental education workshops during the next few months,
the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
The program, called the Hands-on Training Project for Environmental Awareness,
is in its second year. The leaders will cruise by boat up the Crystal River
and the Salt River, take samples from the bottom of Kings Bay and collect
a variety of sea life from the Gulf of Mexico.<BR>
<BR>
Invitations were sent to school board members, county commissioners, water
management officials, community activists and other local leaders. Each
workshop can accept 24 to 26 participants, and a limited amount of space
will be available to the public.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Strawberry and tomato consumers won't feel bite of the freeze
- growers will</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA BAY --(EnviroWorld)-- The results of the Feb. 5 hard freeze
on Florida strawberry and tomato crops won't be felt by consumers, but the
growers will take it in the wallet. Plentiful supplies of strawberries and
tomatoes from California and Mexico have found their way into area stores,
offsetting any hefty price increases that consumers would have felt, the
St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Suncoast growers are already feeling the financial effects of the Feb.5
freeze, which caused millions in damages to crops, and the low costs in
stores will only make things worse on them. The growers said they are having
trouble competing with the prices of California and Mexico growers. Some
have singled out Mexico for criticism, saying that if Mexican growers weren't
exporting so many crops, the Florida farmers could charge more and offset
their losses.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Enviro lab owner going to federal prison for submitting falsified
lab data</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--An environmental lab owner got
the bad news from a federal judge yesterday regarding what the consequences
of lying to the EPA are.<BR>
<BR>
Lewis Parrish Sr., president of Gateway Utilities Services, a Jax-based
environmental testing lab, will serve 366 days in federal prison and pay
an $18,000 fine according to a sentence imposed by U.S. District Court Judge
Harvey Schlesinger. Parrish pled guilty to a felony charge stemming from
his providing false lab data about waste water discharges into north Florida
rivers. <BR>
<BR>
Parrish will serve his term beginning April 26. After his time in prison,
he will be given two years of probation in which to pay back the fine--without
creating any new debt.<BR>
<BR>
U.S. Attorney Bruce Pasfield called the sentence a victory. &quot;Anytime
a white collar goes to jail for something like this it's a victory.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The conviction came after a three-year FBI investigation of enviro labs
in Florida, Pasfield said.<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. Attorney's office contends that Parrish's falsified data &quot;created
harm or threatened harm to human health and the environment.&quot; This
is the first felony prosecution of its kind in north Florida.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>State Senate renews interest in tanks cleanup bill</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--by Dave Newport--Environmental businesses
and property owners have cause for some optimism that reforms to the state's
underground tanks cleanup laws may happen this year: the State Senate has
begun to review a House bill and set up its own reform bill.<BR>
<BR>
The Senate Natural Resources Committee this week heard reports about the
House bill and had an extensive briefing from the Texas underground tanks
cleanup program director, Joe Woodard. Texas' experience is seen as similar
to Florida's with respect to the program's economic health. And Texas instituted
some novel reforms in order to bring the program back from bankruptcy and
speed cleanups.<BR>
<BR>
Florida Senators were very interested in the Texas experience and have vowed
to move forward with corrections to Florida's laws.<BR>
<BR>
Senate bill 646 is the shell bill filed by Sen. Rick Dantzler.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Clinton's Everglades plan could be boosted by existing legislation</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON, D.C.--(EnviroWorld)--Several components of a Clinton
administration plan to invest $1.5 billion over the next seven years for
restoration of the Florida Everglades could feasibly be carried out under
bills currently pending before Congress, Senate aides say. <BR>
<BR>
For example, S 1377, introduced by Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman
Richard Lugar in 1995, would raise $350 million over five years to purchase
131,000 acres of land in the Everglades Agricultural Area. The measure would
impose a two cents-per-pound market assessment on sugar produced in that
area. Because the markup of the bill has not yet been set, Lugar may instead
seek to attach S 1377 to another legislative measure, possibly one of the
appropriations bills still working its way through Congress. <BR>
<BR>
Another piece of pending legislation, the Senate-passed version of the Farm
Bill, S 1541, would authorize $200 million for the purchase of land in the
Everglades Agricultural Area. Under public ownership, the land, known as
the Talisman Tract, would be taken out of sugar production and be used for
water treatment and storage. However, unlike S 1377, the bill excluded any
market assessment on sugar produced in the area.<BR>
<BR>
While support of the Clinton administration is important to the restoration
of the Everglades, federal funding and the support of Congress will be &quot;helpful
and critical&quot; in this effort, noted John Neuharth, a spokesman for
the South Florida Water Management District.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Washington Post editorial supports Clinton's Everglades plan</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON, D.C.--(EnviroWorld)--The Washington Post's editorial
staff point out that Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt's initial &quot;tottering&quot;
steps to secure preservation of the Florida Everglades have developed into
a solid plan, backed by state law, to clean contaminated water and buy land
for marsh restoration.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, Sen. Bob Dole (R-KS) has proposed $200 million for additional
cleanup funds. The Post concludes that if presidential politics are playing
a role in restoring the Everglades, it's &quot;not a bad thing, either.
If the presidential campaign helps save the Everglades, well, at least we'll
salvage something from it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The NY Times also weighed in favorably on the President's plan yesterday
calling the vast swamp &quot;irreplaceable&quot; and in support of the proposed
one-cent per pund tax on sugar production.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Tribune editorial critical of state senate for Batchelor-bashing
</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA--(EnviroWorld)--A Tampa Tribune editorial offered support
to Environmental Regulation Commission chairman Dick Batchelor after the
beating he took during last week's Senate approval hearing for his second
term.<BR>
<BR>
The Tribune wrote that the reason the Senate Natural Resources Committee
&quot;ripped&quot; into Batchelor was that &quot;he takes his job seriously
and seeks to devise rules that will protect the environment. . . .Batchelor's
real offense is that he'll stand up to the special interests affected by
the commisssion's decisions.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The source of Senate ire, the editors write, is that Batchelor acts as more
than just a lap dog for the Department of Environmental Protection, sometimes
questioning DEP policy and seeking to &quot;make sure the rules are effective.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The editorial singles out Sen. Rick Dantzler (D-Winter Haven), who heads
the Natural Resources Committee, for criticism. That Senator's strong environmental
record should have kept him out of the political bullying of Batchelor.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Billboard bill would prevent advertisers from trimming DOT trees</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CLEARWATER--(EnviroWorld)--A provision in the Billboard Bill
would protect the trees along roadways--trees which the Department of Transportation
spends $3 million a year, the Tampa Tribune reported. But the bill, drafted
by the State House Transportation committee, would also prevent state and
local beautification coordinators from planting trees that block billboards.<BR>
<BR>
Billboard owners would not be allowed to put boards behind beautification
projects and would have to get state approval before doing any trimming.
Illegal trimming could cost $1000.<BR>
<BR>
The measure attempts to address Florida's ugly abundance of non-compliant
billboards. The DOT estimates 25 percent of billboards in Florida don't
meet state guidelines.</BLOCKQUOTE>

class on marine rules that will informally deputize boaters to look for

From July through January, the Marine Patrol issued 135 citations for illegal
netting, but officials believe many more violations are taking place--it's

<BLOCKQUOTE>KENANSVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--The 35 young whooping cranes released
in south Osceola have all survived, Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission
officials told the Orlando Sentinel. Usually, the endangered birds lose
about half the captive-raised youngsters right away to bobcats. However,
this year, biologists who hatch the chicks in Maryland and Wisconsin tried
a new approach. They raised the chicks in wet areas to teach them to stay
in the water when they're released. That keeps the one-year-old birds safe
from the cats. <BR>
<BR>
The past several years of the reintroduction program have only seen 16 survivors.
The Game and Fish Commission hopes to get the population up to 100 birds
this year.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>PORT EVERGLADES --(EnviroWorld)-- Chessie, the manatee with
a liking for waters up north, has come back to his natural home, currently
swimming in the warm waters around a power plant in Port Everglades, the
Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
This time Chessie has been outfitted with a transmitter to allow biologists
to keep track of him. The manatee was first discovered out of Florida waters
in the fall of 1994, when he was rescued from the Chesapeake Bay, which
is considered beyond the range of Florida manatees. After he was released
into Florida waters, he headed north again. Last summer, he got all the

<H3><STRONG>Jax Port Authority looking for expansion funds</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE --(EnviroWorld)-- The Jacksonville Port Authority
needs $560 million over 20 years for expansion purposes, and has decided
that a local tax is not feasible. That leaves state funding as the best
option, but they will have to wait for the state legislature to approve
some bills, the Florida Times-Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
Local funding was tabled after officials decided that the city could not
&quot;make the public aware of the importance of the port economically,&quot;
said Rep. Jim King, R-Jacksonville. <BR>
<BR>
State funding could come from one of several different proposals. This year's
House commerce bill and Chiles' budget propose $5 million be appropriated
for Florida's 14 seaports beginning July 1996, and $10 million each year
after that. <BR>
<BR>
The Senate is looking at a separate bill dealing with port funding. In that
bill, the ports must match the amount they take from the state's fund.<BR>
<BR>
Another potential source of funding would be Chiles' proposed tax on floating
casinos that travel far enough to escape state prohibitions against gambling.
The governor wants to add $5 to the ticket price, which would raise $7 million
a year.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Browner, Babbitt to testify today on federal budget cuts' effect
on environment </STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON, D.C.---(EnviroWorld)--The Congressional Democratic
Environmental Task Force will hold a hearing today to discuss the impacts
of federal budget cuts on the environment.<BR>
<BR>
The Democrats' task force has more than 60 members, and is co-chaired by
Reps. Frank Pallone (NJ), Robert Borski (PA), Bob Wise (WVa), and George
Miller (CA). EPA Administrator Carol Browner, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt,
and Assistant Attorney General Lois Schiffer are scheduled to testify. <BR>
<BR>
On January 26, Browner told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee that budget
cuts and a lack of an approved appropriations bill have led to an 8 percent
decrease in EPA's workforce, impaired the agency's ability to issue new
regulations, and have caused EPA to miss &quot;several hundred&quot; environmental
inspections it had planned for the fiscal year.</BLOCKQUOTE>

&quot;informing them that it is also our intention not to furlough anyone
at EPA during the period of the continuing resolution...which expires March

<BR>
Browner also stated that the agency workforce is about 1,600 full-time equivalents

<BLOCKQUOTE>CLEARWATER--(EnviroWorld)--A manatee that swam to a Houston
sewage plant got a plane ride back to Florida along with a gaggle of Northern
Gannets, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
The manatee, named Sweet Pea, arrived in Clearwater on Monday and will be
transported to Homosassa Springs State Wildlife Park. The 10 Gannets, rare
seabirds, were found sick on a Texas beach last summer, and will be taken
to an Indian Shores bird sanctuary.<BR>
<BR>
Sweet Pea had been recovering at Sea World in San Antonio. She now has a
microchip, so scientists can track her, and will eventually be released
into the Crystal or Homosassa River.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Wexler bill would ban Orimulsion</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>SARASOTA--(EnviroWorld)--State Sen. Robert Wexler (D-Boca Raton)
has drafted a bill to ban the use of the controversial fuel Orimulsion until
December 1998--after an additional scientific study is performed--the Sarasota
Herald Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Ironically, the tactic is similar to Sen. George Kirkpatrick's successful
bid to stall the Ocklawaha River restoration over the past few years by
calling for more studies. Environmentalists angry with the Kirkpatrick strategy
may appreciate this version more, however. <BR>
<BR>
A Florida Power &amp; Light official told the Herald Tribune that he was
&quot;dumbfounded&quot; by the move. FP&amp;L had thought they were only
one step away from final state approval to burn the bituminous fuel from
Venezuela. FP&amp;L had won a major battle recently when a hearing officer
rejected environmentalists' arguments about the potential for pollution
from Orimulsion burning, and the possibility of ecological devastation from
a tanker spill of the fuel, which dissolves in water.<BR>
<BR>
Expecting to get final approval from the Governor and Cabinet in April,
FP&amp;L had planned to begin burning the fuel in January 1998 in a Manatee
County plant. Groups that have fought Orimulsion use did not think that
permission would be so automatic, however, and now have a backup in Wexler's
Bill.<BR>
<BR>
Wexler is concerned that the cumulative impacts of multiple Orimulsion plants
have not been considered. His bill would prohibit even equipping power plants
to use the fuel until after further study. FP&amp;L officials say all of
the questions Wexler is asking have already been satisfactorily answered.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--The Jacksonville development community
uses its political muscle to support local candidates who'll keep impact
fees from being instituted, the Florida-Times Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
Jacksonville is the only city in the state without impact fees, which make
developers pay for some of the public infrastructure their projects require.
As a result, some critics say Jacksonville suffers with poor roads and schools.
<BR>
<BR>
But those critics face a formidable opponent--money. The Northeast Florida
Builders Association is recruiting candidates to run against one impact
fee proponent on the school board, and is trying to recall another. Developer
clout is apparent in their contributions to the last mayoral campaign. Winning
pol John Delaney took more than $200,000 from developers out of a total
campaign fund of $815,000.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--As part of a large package of financial
maneuvering, St. Joe Paper, the state's largest property owner, may buy
the Florida East Coast Railway, the Florida Times-Union Reported.<BR>
<BR>
Recently, the company announced plans to sell its sugar operations, paper
plants and telephone businesses it owns in the state. It is interested in
the railroad, company officials said, as part of its plans to become primarily
a &quot;land and timberland and real estate development company.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In addition to the distinction of owning about 1 million acres of Florida,
the company also released 717,725 pounds of pollutants listed in the Toxics
Release Inventory for 1993, placing it in the top 20 of the state's polluters.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. JOHNS RIVER -- (EnviroWorld) -- State Representative Everett
Kelly of Tavares has high expectations for the St. Johns River Cleanup set
for Saturday. Kelly is looking to break the world record set in 1993 when
50,405 people gathered to clean the California coast. Kelly is hoping to
assemble the world's largest army of garbage collectors, according to the
Orlando Sentinel.<BR>
<BR>
Bill Graf, a spokesman for the St. Johns River Water Management District,
says organizers are hoping that the cleanup will not only help the river,
but will help create a sense of ownership within the volunteers so they
will take it personally when the river is degraded. Organizers are hoping
volunteers from 14 counties will participate in the cleanup from Vero Beach
to Jacksonville retrieving trash from shore lines, pulling out sunken boats
and replanting barren shores of Lake Apopka.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Municipalities losing trash competition</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>PENSACOLA -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Associated Press has reported
that Escambia County has lost $2.8 million and expects to lose another $1.4
million before the budget year is over because of competition from a private
garbage dump across the state line in Alabama.<BR>
<BR>
Other local governments around the state and nation also are recording losses
on landfill operations since the U.S. Supreme Court in 1994 eliminated &quot;flow
control&quot; - their ability to decide where garbage must be dumped. As
a result of the ruling, Browning-Ferris Industries, a large national sanitation
company, has shifted 80 percent of the garbage it collects in Escambia from
the county-operated Perdido Landfill to its own private dump in Brewton,
Ala.<BR>
<BR>
In Escambia, county officials are considering choices that include postponing
other projects, laying off workers, increasing garbage pickup fees and canceling
plans for a county-wide recycling program that was supposed to be financed
with landfill proceeds. Right now, Pensacola is under contract with Perdido
Landfill until 1999, but when its contract expires, the situation could
get worse for the county.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>
Today, the commission will debate a proposed study for a rail system that

<BR>
Major commission support for the project comes from Ed Turanchik, who is

alternatives must be found to automobiles, while his critic doubt that car

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--The state awarded franchise rights
for a high-speed intrastate rail system to Florida Overland eXpress Tuesday.
That consortium, which includes Disney's monorail supplier and a French
company with the rail's technology rights, now has 90 days to iron out financial,
logistical and environmental details.<BR>
<BR>
If all goes well, the train will run from Miami to Orlando by the year 2004,
with Tampa on the tracks by 2006. The train will be an upgraded version
of French TGV trains that are capable of 200 m.p.h. speeds.<BR>
<BR>
But in addition to nailing down funding for the $5 billion project, a number
of environmental concerns must be handled. The proposed path of the train
will take it across a levee skirting the eastern fringe of the Everglades,
for one thing. A number of environmental firms are said to be vying for
consultancy contract(s).<BR>
<BR>
The consortium's proposal beat out three others, including a group that
included AMTRAK. As planned, the train will take 90 minutes to go from Miami
to Orlando and will cost $54.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--After listening to several hours
of debate, Governor Chiles postponed a decision on improving the Florida
Key's nasty septic tank situation, the Tampa Tribune reported. <BR>
<BR>
As many as 11,000 primitive septic tanks now leak raw sewage into the Key's
coastal waters. A plan was on the table to link new development to cleanups
as part of the Monroe County comprehensive plan. But Chiles was overwhelmed
by the arguments over various aspects of the plan, and postponed a decsion
until March 12, at the earliest.<BR>
<BR>
Property owners and county officials want state funds to assist the cleanup,
while environmentalists want to halt new development. One plan to reduce
annual building permits from 255 to 88 was thrown out in favor of a new
plan to link construction with cleanup, the Tribune reported.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Browner, democrats testify: buget cuts' will harm enviro protection</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON, D.C.--(EnviroWorld)--At a House Democratic Environmental
Task Force hearing held Feb. 26, EPA Administrator Carol Browner, Secretary
of the Interior Bruce Babbitt, Assistant Attorney General Lois Schiffer,
and other federal officials testified about the impact of Republican tactics
on environmental budgets and initiatives. <BR>
<BR>
Browner and other EPA officials reported that: EPA inspections are off 40
percent since October 1; Agency staffing is 1,500 positions below what is
needed to perform duties; Republican budget proposals cut environmental
enforcement by 25 percent and drinking water and sewage capital projects
by $712 million; and Superfund cleanups have been strongly impacted by budget
cuts. <BR>
<BR>
Babbitt said Republicans have used appropriations legislation to make &quot;radical
changes in environmental laws that could not be enacted in regular bills.
It is a frontal assault on the Endangered Species Act in the backroom process
under the guide of budget restraint. I am convinced that the...actions aren't
about saving money or making the act work better. This is about expanding
a radical ideology and a business agenda that has no tolerance for the act.&quot;
Schiffer said funds for litigation of environmental crimes has been reduced
from the $6 million of FY 1995 to only $680,000 proposed for 1996. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Companies that are subject to environmental laws know that EPA's budget
has been cut, Interior's budget has been cut and that state environmental
budgets have been cut, and that DOJ's budget has been cut,&quot; she said.
<BR>
<BR>
Schiffer also noted that environmental laws depend on voluntary compliance,
&quot;but voluntary compliance is premised on a strong enforcement since
few of us would comply voluntarily with a statute that is not enforced.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
In addition, environmental enforcement generates money for the Treasury
and trust funds, including Superfund, with more than $300 million in fines,
penalties, and cost recoveries resulting from civil enforcement litigation
in fiscal 1995. <BR>
<BR>
Criticizing the hearing, Rep. Don Young (R-AK), Chairman of the House Resources
Committee, said &quot;It's an outright mockery of the system to conduct
a media event for Democratic Congressmen and invite Democratic political
appointees to attack Republicans,&quot; and that the task force excluded
&quot;organizations which are not part of the liberal Beltway cocktail circuit.&quot;

<H3><STRONG>Birds catch a tail wind back to the Great Lakes</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>PAYNES PRAIRIE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Sandhill cranes, who make
Paynes Prairie and other parts of North Central Florida their home for the
winter, have begun their spring departure back to their summer homes near
the Great Lakes. By the second week in March, most of the 3,000 to 5,000
cranes will have taken flight, according to the Gainesville Sun. Departure
time for the bird is usually between 9:30 and 11 a.m. and they will only
leave the south on a clear day.<BR>
<BR>
Most other birds that migrate to Florida for the winter will remain for
a few more weeks. In addition, some 200 non-migrating sandhill cranes will
remain for the year, making it easier for researchers to study the bird.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We're more interested in the year-round residents, so we see the spring
migration as a clearing away of the 'background noise' of all these winter
migrants so we can study the residents better,&quot; says Stephen Nesbitt,
a biological administrator for the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission,
who has studied the cranes for 15 years.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Housing proposal in Alachua County defeated</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Alachua County commissioners
rejected plans for a 209-home development in Monteocha on Tuesday night
setting a major precedent. Commissioners said the proposal was a good idea,
but it didn't comply with the county's comprehensive plan for orderly, efficient
growth from urban areas, the Gainesville Sun reported. <BR>
<BR>
Voting 5-0 against the project, commissioners had fears that the project
had different standards being applied to the county's east side compared
to the west side. In addition, commissioners felt that more effort must
be put into setting clear policies that would allow east side development.<BR>
<BR>
The local developer, The Thompson Group, had been working with county staff
on the proposal for 15 months. Ron Carpenter, attorney for the developers,
said that the development would not disturb the area's rural character and
was not an urban density, according to the Sun. County staff was concerned
over a plan to split up ownership of the open space among homeowners.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Orlando engineering firm,
Camp Dresser &amp; McKee, Inc., recently received an Honorable Mention in
the 1996 Engineering Excellence Awards Program, sponsored by the Florida
Institute of Consulting Engineers. <BR>
<BR>
CDM's project was the In-City Reclamation Irrigation System for the City
of Boca Raton. Due to a very high per capita water consumption, the City
of Boca Raton was required by the water management district to reduce consumption
and investigate reuse. <BR>
<BR>
CDM prepared a reuse master plan, and then completed the first of four phases
of the recommended program. When complete, this $45 million project will
conserve 4.0 billion gallons of potable water annually used for outside
purposes within a 14.3-squar-mile service area. CDM's design eliminated
the need for additional water wells and postponed expansion of the water
treatment plant, decreasing stress on the aquifer and saving capital.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>BROOKSVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--The Southwest Florida Water Management
District and two of the entities that it is fighting in court have come
to an agreement: Let a panel of scientists determine the facts. The St.
Petersburg Times reported that the West Coast Regional Water Authority and
Pinellas County have agreed to binding arbitration with the water district
through a scientific review of existing data.<BR>
<BR>
Though the issues being fought over in the &quot;water wars&quot; do go
beyond science, the sides agree that the issues of technical fact are central
to the fight. The panel of scientists will determine the impacts of well-field
pumping and drought on lakes, wetlands, and long-term security of the water
supply.<BR>
<BR>
Swiftmud set a 30-day deadline to iron out the plan and choose the members
of the panel. Perhaps the toughest part of in designing the plan for the
opposing sides will be agreeing to exactly what questions get asked.<BR>
<BR>
Once the panel is in place, Swiftmud, Pinellas County, and West Coast Regional
will drop their current lawsuits.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>INVERNESS--(EnviroWorld)--Responsibility for a sewer pipe leaking
into the Homosassa River is being fought in the courts, the St. Petersburg
Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
The leaking underwater pipe was discovered three weeks ago. It comes from
the Riverside Inn, but the sewer system is owned by RHV Utility Inc. Wednesday,
a circuit court judge ordered the utility to continue pumping sewage from
the Inn while the pipe is repaired. <BR>
<BR>
The state department of Health and Rehabilitative services also filed a
complaint to ensure that public health and the environment were protected
while the Inn and the utility fought over repair bills. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Until the matter of which parties own or have a duty to repair or
replace the lift station and the subaqueous force main has been decided,&quot;
the HRS said in court documents, &quot;no remedy . . . exists to protect
the environment of the state of Florida and the health and welfare of its
residents.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>PORT RICHEY--(EnviroWorld)--A &quot;jury-rigged&quot; air conditioning
system at the Port Richey police and fire department is being blamed for
a number of worker complaints, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;For several years, fumes from fire trucks have entered the police
dispatch center,&quot; City Manager Max Pope told the city council. &quot;During
the last months, the situation has become so bad that some of the dispatchers
have become ill on occasion.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Police Chief Carmine Macedonio said he could attribute 45 sick days in 1995
to the air-conditioning problem. Employees often complain about sore throats
and dizziness and one dispatcher lost his voice for a month. &quot;I don't
think we can put (repairs) off much longer,&quot; Macedonio was quoted by
the Times. <BR>
<BR>
The City Council wants a professional evaluation of the system, however,
before it will allow money to be spent on repairs, it was decided Tuesday.
The repairs are expected to cost several thousand dollars.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Pasco wellfields won't get sprayed with treated wastewater,

<BLOCKQUOTE>PASCO COUNTY--(EnviroWorld)--A plan to replenish Pasco County's
depleted underground water supply by spreading treated sewage effluent has
been shelved by the region's water supplier and Swiftmud, the St. Petersburg
Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
That plan, the Pasco Wellfield Rehydration Project, met with objections
from Pinellas County officials who were wary of the costs of piping water
from Pasco and Pinellas to the wellfields. The possible $50 million price
tag is more expensive than some alternatives that are being studied. Those
alternatives, which West Coast Regional Water Supply Authority and Swiftmud
have agreed to consider, include skimming water from nearby rivers and removing
drainage ditches and dikes to reroute water back to the wellfields.<BR>
<BR>
West Coast officials told the Times that they may still spread reclaimed
sewage on some wellfields during dry months.<BR>
<BR>
The overpumping of water from underneath Pasco is an issue of great concern
to area water management officials and environmentalists, who believe permanent
environmental damage is imminent. Some think that damage has already occurred.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>
Stephen Donald Bassett, who pleaded no contest to the polluting charge,
was ordered to spend 50 hours at the Largo sewer treatment plant dipping
grease out of the system. In addition Bassett must pay $1500 in fines and
court fees, and spend two years on probation. Basset was allowed to keep

<BLOCKQUOTE>A large algae bloom stretching stretching along the Kissimmee
River from Lake Kissimmee to Lake Okeechobee is being watched by scientists
with the South Florida Water Management District. Algae blooms can cause
fish kills by depriving fish of oxygen, but no kills have been reported
this time, and water management officials say conditions are not favorable
for a kill to occur.<BR>
<BR>
The bloom began appearing the second week of February and researchers have
not yet determined its cause nor how long the bloom will last. They are
asking river residents for help in determining the extent of the bloom.
Information can be given to the Okeechobee Service Center at 1-800-250-4200,

<BLOCKQUOTE>CRYSTAL SPRINGS --(EnviroWorld)-- The Crystal Springs Recreational
Preserve will close to the public starting this week. It will be changed
into a research and educational center, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Park officials said the closing was needed in order to ensure the long-term
health of the natural spring system and the Hillsborough River. <BR>
<BR>
The 500-acre park, which draws up to 65,000 a year, opened in the mid-1960s.
It is slated to open as a research center in 1997.<BR>
<BR>
A 2,500-square-foot research center will be built at a cost of about $750,000,
and will offer educational programs for local schools and residents. Studies
will be conducted to find out where the springs' 40-million-gallons of water
a day come from and include a look at potential water quality problems due
to development in the area.</BLOCKQUOTE>

coordinator for the St. Johns River Water Management District. People need
to realize that what goes on the ground eventually goes in the water.<BR>
<BR>
The cleanup involves 14 northeast and central Florida counties, including
eight sites in Alachua County. Organizers are expecting at least 50,000
volunteers to assist. The event is sponsored by the St. Johns River Water
Management District, Keep Florida Beautiful and others. People interested

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE --(EnviroWorld)-- The investigation into criminal
environmental violations by White Construction could be resolved today,
the Gainesville Sun reported. Settlement negotiations have been taking place
between the State Attorney's Office and the construction company for several
months now. <BR>
<BR>
A field inspector for the Gainesville Department of Environmental Protection,
Chris Roeder, said there was talk of fines reaching &quot;tens of thousands
of dollars,&quot; the Sun reported. It is also possible that owner Luther
White will be asked to sign a deferred prosecution agreement that would
set certain requirements. If the conditions are met, then the company would
avoid an official finding of guilt. Such an agreement would leave White
Contruction eligible for bid-related work.<BR>
<BR>
In December, White Construction was charged by Alachua County officials
for illegally dumping road materials collected from Interstate 75 construction
near Newberry. The county has been investigating possible criminal environmental
violations at other White Construction sites as well.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Sugar wins, House votes down subsidy phase-out</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)--The House amendment to the farm bill
that would have ended Government price supports of the sugar market, lost
in a narrow vote Wednesday, the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
With a 217 to 208 vote against the amendment, the strong sugar lobby showed
its muscle. Environmentalists believed that ending the price supports was
a key to ending the environmental degradation of South Florida that has
been caused, in part, by polluted runoff of sugar cane plantations.<BR>
<BR>
Federal price supports were first implemented in 1934, and helped South
Florida sugar farming expand from 37,000 acres in 1950 to 430,000 acres
in 1994.<BR>
<BR>
The amendment was sponsored by U.S. Rep. Dan Miller, R-Sarasota, and would
have ended the price supports completely by the year 2000. Clay Henderson,
president of the Florida Audubon Society, told the Sentinel that the House
vote would force a new tack against the sugar industry--a push for a state
law to tax the industry.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--Gulf Power reached a compromise
with the Legal Environmental Assistance Foundation (LEAF) on Wednesday over
LEAF's challenge to a company request before the Public Service Commission.<BR>
<BR>
That request would have allowed Gulf Power to offer lower rates to corporations
with high energy demands. The agreement with LEAF commits Gulf to relying
strongly on energy efficiency as a part of its planned Commercial Industrial
Service Rider.<BR>
<BR>
The Public Service Commission still has final say-so over the agreement.
Gulf is seeking the power to negotiate rates with consumers who may by able
to generate their own electricity and steam more cheaply with natural gas
turbines than Gulf's coal and oil plants can do it.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Boehner told the Journal that 1990 Rio treaty, which committed  the U.S. to lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions, was the EPA's &quot;national  security&quot; tie to using the provision.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>While legislative approval would not be necessary, the Oct. 31 memo,  prepared by the EPA's Office of Policy, Planning and Evaluation, did state  that &quot;the option would require the use of substantial political capital  since the levying of a gasoline tax would probably be politically unpopular.&quot;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The Journal article is critical of the plan, calling it &quot;dubious  rationale&quot; that could &quot;cost the average family more than $1000  a year directly.&quot;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Other EPA plans mentioned in the memo include measures to encourage  the use of public transportation through higher registration and licensing  fees, and tightening vehicle emissions rules.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The article concludes that the plan &quot;could cripple any nascent  economic recovery.

The dead mangrove  area has now increased to about 50 acres.  Scientists say that the heavy  rainfall of 1995 stressed the forest and contributed to the tree deaths.   Rain and runoff flooding the bay is causing the black mangrove trees to  drown.  Black mangroves have a horizontal root system that must reach above  the soil  to &quot;breathe.&quot;  The lack of water flow is causing debris  to be improperly flushed, affecting other organisms in the area.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The Collier County Commission hired a consulting team to create a short-term  plan for saving the mangrove forest.  They sent workers out with shovels  this summer to reopen the channels through the mangrove forest, allowing  proper water flow.  The mangroves started to make a turn around.  </P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The team made about half the flushing cuts permitted.  However, T.R.  Brown Co., the consulting firm hired by the city commission, and Hilburn  Hillestad, the scientist working with the consulting company, have said  that some of the flushing cuts were made in the wrong place and could retard  long-term efforts to save the forest.  They want to conduct a study to  determine the effects of further cuts.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Pelican Bay Services District Administrator Jim Ward said that changing  the location of the flushing cuts would require new permits.  He suggests  waiting for the consultants to make a better determination of the effects  of the cuts. </P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>A report from Hillestad and Brown, dated Sept. 19, states that the best  way to restore the mangrove forest is to dredge Clam Pass and other channels  to aid interior water flow.  </P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Environmentalist Fran Stallings of Save the Bays Association was stunned  by the report saying that it drew away from plans to reconnect the Clam  Bay system with Vanderbilt Lagoon to improve water flow through Venetian  Bay.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The report also suggests installing a &quot;flap&quot; system in the  Seagate culverts to allow water to flow only from Venetian Bay to Clam  Bay, causing the water to exit through Clam Pass.  This would help keep  Clam Pass open.  It also makes the suggestion that runoff from  nearby  golf courses and lawns be monitored to reduce the water that Clam Bay receives.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;</P><P> </P><P><A NAME="anchor1023720"></A></P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR><A HREF="../index.html">Return to today's headlines</A><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3><A HREF="#anchor1023720">Benthologists gather in Palatka for annualmeeting</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>PALATKA -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Florida Association of Benthologists  will hold their annual meeting on Dec. 5-6 at the St. Johns River Water  Management District in Palatka.  </P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>There will be presentations on lake, stream and estuarine benthology,  benthic community ecology, taxonomy and ecology of benthic taxa, bionmonitoring  and bioassessment, and information management databases.

<H3><HR>Return to State News Cover Page | Return to today's headlines<HR><STRONG>House
supports $210 million package to help the Everglades restoration</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>MIAMI -- (EnviroWorld) -- The U.S. House has passed the largest
money deal in the history of Everglades restoration projects yesterday,
and environmentalists may find themselves swimming in funds to restore the
Everglades, the Orlando Sentinel and Associated Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
In fact, Speaker Newt Gingrich added a personal push for the $210 million
appropriation to support Everglades cleanup projects and to buy more than
50,000 acres of farmland needed for restoration. <BR>
<BR>
The House voted 299-124 for the bill. The Senate already has approved $200
million for the Everglades, and a House-Senate conference committee will
reconcile the amounts before sending the measure to President Clinton. It
could be until mid-March before the bill reaches the President's desk.<BR>
<BR>
The money for the Everglades, however, is tacked onto a farm bill which
is presently moving to a conference committee of House and Senate negotiators.
That bill could sharply cut back many crop subsidies, including some rollback
of the sugar program. Farmers would get guaranteed but declining payments
over seven years to ease the transition.<BR>
<BR>
Both U.S. Sen. Bob Graham and his Republican counterpart Connie Mack, said
the House action was a big step in the plan to restore the Everglades' natural
water flow, according to the Sentinel. <BR>
<BR>
However, Mary Barley, chair of the Everglades Trust, said the $210 million
pledge &quot;is just the beginning. The total cost of Everglades cleanup
is estimated at $1.5 billion. The largest single polluter, Florida's wealthy
sugar industry, must also pay its fair share.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Gingrich made a suggestion of developing a plan for the government to swap
surplus land for the Everglades instead of paying cash for it. The prospect
of a complicated series of land swaps taking the place of $210 million threw
some officials for a loop, the Sentinel reported. Aids to U.S. Sen. Connie
Mack have been looking at land swap possibilities, but see these deals as
only supplements to the $210 million.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I think that would be very creative,&quot; Florida Audubon Society
President Clay Henderson told the Sentinel, regarding the possiblity of
land swaps. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Water authority director becomes lobbyist for 1996 Legislature
session</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG -- (EnviroWorld) -- The state Legislature will
be meeting next week to begin the 1996 session and Jack Sullivan will be
there to represent the Withlacoochee Regional Water Supply Authority, the
St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Sullivan is a Tallahassee land-use planner in addition to the executive
director of the water supply authority. He will help support a bill the
authority developed requiring every state locality to exhaust its water
resources before turning elsewhere. This bill is important for the authority
because the region's water resources, throughout Hernando, Citrus, Sumter
and Marion Counties, have become threateningly low this year, according
to the Times.</BLOCKQUOTE>

proposal</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CRYSTAL RIVER -- (EnviroWorld) -- Last night, hundreds of Citrus
County residents attended an informational meeting on a proposed extension
of the Suncoast Parkway, which could affect them, their property values
and the environment, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Planners have said that plans for the route are not definite, but a 400-foot-wide
strip would offer a two lane road extension. Supporters of the plan say
the extension would cut down traffic tie-ups and help the area grow as the
population increases.<BR>
<BR>
Opponents of the parkway extension fear the decline of residential land
value and the affect the parkway extension could have on nearly 23 acres
of wetland. In addition, there is concern that it would harm wildlife and
crate noise and air pollution. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ELFERS -- (EnviroWorld) -- An elementary school recycling program
that began more than five years ago as a classroom project, is one of three
schools receiving a national recognition, according to the St. Petersburg
Times. <BR>
<BR>
The children from Mittye P. Locke Elementary School in Elfers, will be filmed
in a public service announcement for the National Can Manufacturers' Institute
on Saturday. In addition, a small group of students will head over to Homosassa
in Citrus County for more filming. These particular youngsters have chosen
to contribute earned money through recycling to numerous environmental programs,
including those programs that help save manatees, the Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Teacher Margaret Marion began this program five years ago and as of Thursday,
the school recycled 6,303 pound of aluminum so far this year.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Manatees protection goes high-tech</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WEST PALM BEACH --(EnviroWorld)-- Six state agencies have developed
new sensors to keep water control structures, like locks and spillways,
from crushing manatees, the Gainesville Sun reported. The sensors will cause
the spillways and locks to automatically reopen if a manatee is caught.<BR>
<BR>
Dade County spillway will be the first to install the device, sometime later
this month. The sensors will be placed in a row along the bottom of the
spillway. Andrew Clark, director of Harbor Branch's engineering division,
said the sensors can tell the difference between a manatee and a piece of
driftwood, so the sensors should not accidentally close on a manatee.<BR>
<BR>
In the last 20 years, almost 100 manatees have drowned or been crushed in
the 24 locks and spillways in South Florida. The water control devices are
used for navigation and flood control.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Right whales having an up-and-down year</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE --(EnviroWorld)-- The most endangered of the large
whale species, the northern right whale, has been having a good year in
terms of births and a bad year in terms of deaths. According to the New
England Aquarium Right Whale Research Project, as many as 12 to 14 mothers
with calves have survived the 1996 season so far, but 1996 has also been
the worst year for deaths since scientists began keeping track in the early
1970s, the Florida Times-Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
The northern right whales, which have winter calving grounds in north Florida
and south Georgia, recently lost three calves in unexplained deaths. Combined
with the death of an adult male from a ship strike and a juvenile female
from unknown causes, the death total subdues excitement over the good birth
numbers.<BR>
<BR>
Scientists said that this year's good birth rate will help make up for the
winter of 1994-1995, when only six animals were born.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Panel hears claims about environmental health risks of low-income
areas</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE --(EnviroWorld)--About 20 Jacksonville residents
attended a public hearing held earlier this week by the Florida Environmental
Equity and Justice Commission in Jacksonville to discuss the belief that
there are disproportionate amounts of environmental hazards in low-income
communities, the Florida Times-Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
The 17-member commission, founded by the state Legislature two years ago,
has been to five other cities in the past six months in order to prepare
a final report that will be given to Gov. Chiles and the Legislature on
April 1. Jacksonville is the last stop for the commission.<BR>
<BR>
The panel heard from people like Anita James, a state Department of Juvenile
Justice employee, on effects they believe are caused by living in an area
with smokestack emissions, old landfills, old gas station sites, polluted
river water and other environmental hazards. James believes asthma and cancer
she sees in many area residents is due to these conditions, but could offer
no scientific studies to prove the claims.</BLOCKQUOTE>

contractor has 90 days to iron out devilish details</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO--(EnviroWorld)--Now that Florida has awarded a franchise
for a train to link Orlando, Miami, and Tampa, the franchise winner has
a tough round of negotiations to get past. If Florida Overland eXpress can't
work out environmental, financial and political problems within 90 days,
the consortium will lose its franchise rights, the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
The proposed route for FOX's 200-mph train would skirt the eastern Everglades,
and cut through the Kissimmee River prairie--classified as environmentally
sensitive last year. FOX officials said rerouting the train was possible,
and were optimistic that environmental hurdles would be the least of their
problems.<BR>
<BR>
Political dissension is another issue. Because the train is getting a large
commitment of state funds--$70 million annually for 30 years--but will only
serve three metropolitan areas, some communities that are left out are likely
to raise objections. Those political problems could become apparent as soon
as the Legislative session convenes Tuesday.<BR>
<BR>
The state and FOX also don't see eye to eye on money. The consortium had
wanted $95 million a year and a guaranteed return on its investment while
assigning all financing risks to the state. State officials, led by transportation
secretary Ben Watts, said their $70 million offer was set, and that any
guaranteed returns should be tied to the level of risk the consortium is
willing to assume.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO--(EnviroWorld)--During the depths of winter just weeks
ago, state tourism officials said northern tourists were flocking to Florida.
Hotel occupancy statistics just released show otherwise, the Orlando Sentinel
reported.<BR>
<BR>
In January, occupancy was down by 1.1 percentage points in Miami and down
by 0.7 points in Fort Lauderdale, compared to average. In Orlando, occupancy
did increase by 1.9 points.</BLOCKQUOTE>

citrus, Lake County should see a lot of development, the Orlando Sentinel

<H3><STRONG>State legislators to look at electrical power issues</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO--(EnviroWorld)--Legislators will likely debate electrical
utility reform this session, the Orlando Sentinel reported. The buzzword
for reform this session is &quot;retail wheeling,&quot; which would eliminate
territorial control of electrical utilities by power companies and create
a competitive market.<BR>
<BR>
The issue is contentious, and ironically, the large power companies and
consumer groups may take the same side. Competition for industry customers
could cost those big utilities their largest power users and drive up rates
for residential customers. <BR>
<BR>
This legislative session will only see approval of studies of &quot;retail
wheeling&quot; the Sentinel reports, however lawmakers will probably pass
a sales-tax exemption for electrical power used by industrial manufacturers.<BR>
<BR>
That exemption will cost $6 million a year right away, but supporters say
that the move will help lure more industry to the state and result in more
jobs.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>State officials see no need to check into northern panther sightings</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>APOLLO BEACH--(EnviroWorld)--State biologists insist that panthers
do not live anywhere in the state outside of the Everglades and Big Cypress
National Preserve, but people who believe they have seen the endangered
cat insist they do, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;A game official tells us we couldn't have seen a panther, there are
none left. But we know the difference between a bobcat and a panther,&quot;
one outdoorsman was quoted in the Tribune.<BR>
<BR>
Wildlife officials said panther sightings north of the animal's known range
are frequently reported, but are almost never checked out anymore. Past
experience has shown that those reports are almost never accurate, they
told the Tribune, and further evidence that panthers exist outside of South,
such as roadkills, never turns up. <BR>
<BR>
But some critics claim that policy is based on politics more than science--that
wildlife officials want to protect the funding they get for the endangered
animal, and so protect the population's isolated image.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--Last week, the Gainesville County
Commission turned down a 208-home development proposal in rural east Gainesville,
near Monteocha. Commissioners cited a lack of infrastructure as the major
hindrance. But the Commission has now agreed to consider extending water
and sewer lines farther in the economically depressed east side so that
future development could occur, the Gainesville Sun reported Sunday.<BR>
<BR>
The proposed development had made it past the county's planning commission
despite staff objections. In turning down the proposal, some commissioners
expressed concern that the development would contribute to urban sprawl--a
problem for Gainesville's west side.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO--(EnviroWorld)--Saturday's St. Johns River cleanup was
hampered by bad weather, but enough volunteers did show up to make an impact,
organizers told the Orlando Sentinel.<BR>
Saturday's event was expected by some to be the largest one-day river cleanup
in the country, but actual attendance was below the 51,000 people needed
to break that record.<BR>
<BR>
A great deal of garbage was removed from the 310-mile river, however. In
Seminole County, volunteers collected about 10,000 pounds of trash, the

<H3><STRONG>Stranded whale dies during rescue efforts</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ATLANTIC BEACH --(EnviroWorld)-- A pygmy sperm found stranded
on Atlantic Beach died Saturday afternoon while in transit to Marineland
in Flagler County, the Florida Times-Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
A necropsy done at Marineland showed the whale died due to complications
from old age. He died despite the efforts of experts who attempted to save
him. The pygmy sperm whale is something of a mystery to researchers because
only a few have been rehabilitated after being found beached.<BR>
<BR>
No pygmy whales have been beached in the Jacksonville area for three years,
but they have been found on other beaches in the state in that time. The
pygmy sperm whale is not an endangered species, but is protected by the
Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which forbids hunting and harassment of the
animal in American waters.<BR>
<BR>
The death of the pygmy whale is not related to the recent deaths of five
right whales, said Joanne Whaley, curator and staff veterinarian for Marineland
of Florida.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>UF, Gainesville officials close to agreeing on master plan</STRONG></H3>
GAINESVILLE --(EnviroWorld)-- After long negotiations about the University
of Florida's master plan for future growth, officials are predicting an
agreement will be reached about the remaining contentions, the Gainesville
Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
There are three main areas left for clarification, officials said: how UF
would site new parking facilities, the procedure by which land acquired
by UF in the future would become exempt from city and county land-use planning
and regulation, and what role the city would play in future planning efforts.<BR>
<BR>
Properties listed on the UF master plan, even those away from campus, are
not directly regulated by the city. The city's main concern about the plan
is not the lands currently slated for use, but that the plan is vague about
how lands acquired in the future will come under the plan. UF has agreed
to intergovernmental coordination in some areas, including groundwater quality
and hazardous materials management, but fear loosely worded assurances that
local government will have the right to review will be used as loopholes
in the future.<BR>
<BR>
The draft master-plan amendments provided to the city last week contained
many agreements that have already been made between UF and the city. Among
these amendments are statements of intent to reduce automobile traffic by
scheduling more &quot;park-and-ride&quot; lots further away from campus,
restricting the use of cars on campus by freshmen during the day and scheduling
more classes in off-peak hours. <BR>

<H3><STRONG>Turtles vs. Volusia County delayed</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>DELAND --(EnviroWorld)-- The trial that could determine the
future of beach driving in Volusia County was delayed by a U.S. district
judge until October, as Volusia County tries to complete its plan for a
sea turtle habitat, the Associated Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
Last year, two Smyrna Beach residents sued the county, accusing it of violating
the federal Endangered Species Act by failing to provide a safe habitat
for the turtles.<BR>
<BR>
County officials responded by applying for an &quot;incidental take&quot;
permit from the federal Fish and Wildlife Service, which would allow for
some human-related turtle deaths on Volusia beaches, as long as the county
set up a suitable conservation plan. The delay in the trial should allow
county officials to get their plan approved.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Cub Scouts help out kestrels</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>BRYCEVILLE --(EnviroWorld)-- Cub Scout Pack 551 from Jacksonville
put up four plywood bird houses in Cary State Forest this weekend in an
attempt to further the preservation of the Southeastern American Kestrel,
which is on the state list of endangered birds, the Florida Times-Union
reported.<BR>
<BR>
The Florida kestrel population has declined by 80 percent since the turn
of the century. The decline is blamed on a lack of good nesting places and
a boom in European Starlings. The starlings are known as nasty birds with
a penchant for pushing other birds' eggs out of tree cavities and taking
the spaces over, said Brian Milsap of the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish
Commission.<BR>
<BR>
The scouts are continuing the efforts of a University of Florida postdoctoral
student who was given a state grant to put up 800 nesting boxes for kestrels.
It appears that 600 of those boxes were occupied by kestrels. The UF student
has since left, leaving the task to volunteers like the scout troop.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Turtle activist told to stop &quot;outdated&quot; techniques</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ANNA MARIA --(EnviroWorld)-- Chuck Shumard, 71, has worked for
the past 11 years to save sea turtles that emerge from their nests each
spring on Anna Maria Island on the Gulf Coast. But the state has let him
know he can't do that anymore, due to his outdated techniques which break
state regulations, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Shumard, who leads a team of 65 volunteers, said that he did not pose a
&quot;potential threat to the protected species,&quot; as the letter he
received from the state said. He points to the numbers to prove his point.
Last year, his group released 12,780 hatchlings into the Gulf, more than
any other team on the west coast of Florida.<BR>
<BR>
But state scientists said it was not the number of hatchlings Shumard's
group saves, it's how they save them. Volunteers used hatcheries, a process
of placing eggs into foam coolers and keeping them in garages until they
hatch. The process is now forbidden. Volunteers have also been caught using
probes and hand shovels to dig up and move nests, also against regulations.<BR>
<BR>
Scientists now advocate leaving the nests completely undisturbed unless
the threat to survival is obvious and imminent. Hatcheries are believed
to harm the hatchlings more than help them.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Malnourished Western cougar comes back to life</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WIELDED -- (EnviroWorld)-- Cougie, the 5-month-old Western cougar
who was near death from malnutrition seven weeks ago received a clean bill
of health on Friday and went home with a Gibsontown woman who raises the
large cats, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
The cougar was originally bought in Oklahoma by a Pinellas County couple.The
couple fed the cougar steaks, but did not supply the calcium supplements
vital to the cat's development. They also didn't have a permit for the cougar,
which is required in Florida. By the time they surrendered him to the state
Game and Freshwater Fish Commission, the cougar was near death: dehydrated,
suffering from severe diarrhea, cataracts in both eyes, weighing half of
what he should and both legs broken from brittleness.<BR>
<BR>
Soon after coming into the care of the state, the cougar began to recover,
as he was fed intravenously and given medicines. After 48 hours, he had
begun to make his way back to health.</BLOCKQUOTE>

War fears spur division of water authority</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG--(EnviroWorld)--Fearful of water-hungry neighbors,
Marion County has adopted a policy of isolationism, the St. Petersburg Times
reported. The county wants to leave the Withlachoochee Regional Water Supply
Authority, and owes the authority $181,000 in back-dues.<BR>
<BR>
The other members of the authority are Citrus County, Sumter County, Hernando
County, and the city of Ocala. Ocala's joining was sparked by Marion County's
request to leave. That request was denied by the authority Feb. 22, but
Marion County has not been an active member of the authority since 1991.<BR>
<BR>
Jeff Gann, a Marion County Commissioner and county water policy liason,
told the Times that the county fears its abundant water resources could
be the target of a water grab by other members of the authority.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The overpumping in Pasco County is a classic case where membership
in a water authority can be detrimental,&quot; Gann said. <BR>
<BR>
But other members of the authority believe Marion County's attitude could
undermine their efforts to protect the region's water supply.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The whole point of a regional water authority is the protection of
water resources through a unified approach,&quot; said Citrus County Commissioner
Gary Bartell, who is chairman of the water authority. &quot;It's not so
much the money as it is the message this sends. We want to present a united<BR>
front.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
That front is crucial, authority members said, as the group seeks passage
of a &quot;local sources first&quot; bill this legislative session that
would force governments to exhaust their local water resources before trying
to tap into the water supply of other areas. <BR>
<BR>
Gann said Marion County was completely supportive of that bill, but that
it saw no benefit to membership in the water authority.<BR>
<BR>
Bartell said he would welcome any proposals from Marion County for contractual
language that would eliminate its fears of a water grab. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It is certainly not the intent of the current water authority members
to rape and pillage each other,&quot; Bartell told the Times. </BLOCKQUOTE>

of these major (spills),&quot; said Andy Liliskis, the director of operations
for the BEAKS sanctuary on Big Talbot Island.<BR>
<BR>
Since Friday, the Bird Emergency Aid and Kare Sanctuary had taken in 26
sick birds, and found 23 dead ones. Workers at the sanctuary said that it
was common for the birds to have been stripped of their protective oils
by unknown pollutants. Without those oils, the birds cannot maintain body
warmth, or keep dry.<BR>
The animals are washed, fed and kept warm for several days, and usually
recover their health, workers told the Times-Union.<BR>

<H3><STRONG>Crawford threatens lawsuit against Mexico</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>PLANT CITY--(EnviroWorld)--State Agriculture Commissioner Bob
Crawford said that if diplomacy did not solve Florida's problem with Mexican
produce &quot;dumping,&quot; the state would pursue a federal lawsuit, the
Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Crawford said Florida now only supplies 40 percent of winter vegetables
to the nation, a drop of 35 percentage points in two years. That drop is
the result of cheap Mexican imports, he said, which could not have come
in without the North American Free Trade Agreement.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It was basically a bad agreement for Florida famers. ... We problably
should have deemed NAFTA null and void and gone to economic war with Mexico,&quot;
Crawford was quoted at the 27th Annual Farm Credit of Central Florida's
Strawberry Salute Breakfast.<STRONG> <BR>
<BR>
</STRONG>Florida has retained a Washington, D.C. law firm specializing in
international trade to attempt to negotiate a solution with Mexico.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Illegal dumping case finally settled</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CHIEFLAND -- (EnviroWorld) -- Environmental officials and Chiefland
residents were pleased with a settlement in which White Construction must
clean up two illegal dump sites and pay $150,000 in fines within the next
year, according to the Gainesville Sun. Many officials believe this case
represents the largest of actions taken against environmental violations
in the area. <BR>
<BR>
The case began when an anonymous tip reported illegal dumping practices
by White Construction. In Newberry, the company was dumping milled asphalt
and other road debris from Interstate-75 construction without proper permits.
Dumping also took place in Chiefland, where leaking barrels likely containing
used oil or hydraulic fluid were found, the Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
Officials believe that the settlement provides a firm cleanup plan, and
will send a firm message that will deter future illegal dumping by construction
companies.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Under its new contract, Alachua
County recycling efforts have lightened the load of the county's landfill
by nearly 120,000 tons, according to the Gainesville Sun. The new contract
allowed an increased number of items to be recycled in the county's curbside
recycling program, including corrugated cardboard, brown grocery bags, colored
plastics and magazines, in addition to plastics, glass and newspapers.<BR>
<BR>
Not only does Alachua County's Big Blue curbside recycling program aid in
landfill reduction, but area residents are finding the economic benefits
of increased recycling capabilities. Since the city charges residents for
waste disposal according to volume, less waste means less charges.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Florida Key's bird survives for now, but experts aren't sure
for how long</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>KEY WEST -- (EnviroWorld) -- In past years, cormorants in the
Florida Keys were dying in large numbers, but now the mysterious syndrome
killing the birds has temporarily vanished, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
For many years, the cormorants were shown to be severely underweight, anemic
and dehydrated with no apparent injuries. Tests on the birds showed high
levels of mercury and selenium in their systems, but it was still not certain
that this is the reason for the bird's sudden death. <BR>
<BR>
Wildlife Rescue of the Florida Keys, based in Key West, has not received
emaciated cormorants as patients recently, said director Becky Barron. But
she does not expect the good fortune to last long, according to the Sun.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Now that we've has this bad weather, we may see it soon,&quot; she
said. The theory is that the birds store the toxins in their fat cells,
which they rely on when the weather is bad and food is low. When they use
their fat reserves, they get a sudden injection of toxins. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Nesting season begins early for Everglades birds </STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Wading birds are nesting early,
making this the best breeding season in years for birds such as the endangered
wood stork and the roseate spoonbill, the Associated Press reported. <BR>
<BR>
In Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary east of Fort Myers and west of Everglades National
Park, biologist Shannon Ludwig counted 545 wood stork nests in February,
the most in five years. The storks began nesting in December.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's been at least a couple of decades since they started as early
as they did this year at Corkscrew,&quot; said National Audubon Society
biologist Wayne Hoffman. <BR>
<BR>
Heavy rain during the past two years followed by relatively dry weather
this fall created good nesting conditions. The extra water increased the
area available for fish. Now that the weather is dry, large numbers of fish
are concentrated in pools, the birds can easily catch and deliver them to
their young without straying far from their nests. <BR>
<BR>
Early wood stork nesting indicates good breeding conditions for most Everglades
wading birds because the storks must begin earlier and nurture their young
longer than other species.</BLOCKQUOTE>

can top-off tomorrow with Freon</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG--(EnviroWorld)--The six-year ban on refilling
leaky car air conditioners with Freon ends Thursday, a change that has seen
little opposition from environmental groups. Though the rule was meant to
prevent the release of the ozone-damaging refrigerant into the atmosphere,
consumer concerns outweighed the environmental benefit, the St. Petersburg
Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Dotty Diltz, chief of the Department of Environmental Protection's air monitoring
and mobile sources bureau, told the Times that because Florida and Wisconsin
were the only two states to adopt a topping-off law, the ozone layer received
little benefit.<BR>
<BR>
But many car owners had complained that repair shops were gouging them for
air conditioning repairs because of the rule. That led the Environmental
Regulation Commission to overturn the rule in January.<BR>
<BR>
The federal government has approved several alternatives to Freon, and a
chemical named R134a, or Du Pont Suva Trans, seems to be the choice of major
automakers, the Times reported. <BR>
<BR>
But the new refrigerant requires major modification to Freon-based air conditioners,
so some motorists will continue to use Freon until supplies dwindle or they
buy a new car. Since 1994, almost all new cars have used a non-CFC refrigerant.

<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG--(EnviroWorld)--Bills have been filed in the
state House and Senate to make the zebra longwing Florida's official butterfly,
the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
The black and yellow lepidopteran is native to Florida and dines on the
nectar of passion flowers, but is not necessarily a shoe-in for the nomination.
In 1972, the praying mantis lost a bid to become the state insect, and Key
Lime Pie was humiliated in 1988 by the Senate after being chosen by the
House as state pie.<BR>
<BR>
The Senate bill was filed by Sen. Howard Forman, D-Pembroke Pines, while
the House version comes from Rep. Jack Tobin, D-Margate. Governor Chiles
wife, Rhea, also supports the butterfly, the Times reported. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>
Five homes and seven cars were also damaged by the fire, which caused total
damages estimated at $100,000. The grassy residential area was called a

River restoration, the Marion County Commission voted 4 to 1 Tuesday to
approve a resolution asking the state legislature to identify funding sources,
the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
The restoration will require the draining of the Rodman Reservoir, which
is located in Marion and Putnam counties. Part of the commission's interest
involves $25 million that is owed to Marion and five other counties for
work on the Cross Florida Barge Canal. The Rodman Dam and Reservoir were
created for that project, but the Canal was never completed. The resolution
asks the legislature to specifically identify funding to repay the counties.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Republicans withdraw regulatory reform bill</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(Associated Press)--Fearing an environmental backlash,
Republican leaders on Tuesday withdrew a bill requiring the review of thousands
of business regulations.<BR>
<BR>
The regulatory reform bill was within hours of being brought up for floor
debate when Republican leaders pulled it from consideration, hoping that
further discussions might produce a more acceptable compromise.<BR>
<BR>
The incident reflects a concern among Republican lawmakers about the fallout
from a campaign against federal environmental policies. President Clinton
has singled out environmental protection as a campaign issue and has vetoed
several appropriations bills because he said they include deep cuts in spending
for pollution protection.<BR>
<BR>
The bill would require federal agencies to review all major health, safety
and environmental protection rules as well as give increased flexibility
to small businesses to comply with regulations.<BR>
<BR>
Critics argued the proposed review was too broad and could endanger regulations
that control air and water pollution, protect endangered species and safeguard
wetlands.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA--(EnviroWorld)--A Tampa Tribune/News Channel 8 telephone
survey looking into Floridians' support of President Clinton's recent positions
found that 54 percent favor a penny tax per pound of sugar. Clinton supports
the penny tax, a compromise with environmentalists urging a two-cent tax.<BR>
<BR>
That compromise also got more support from Republican voters that were polled.
Forty-six percent favored the penny tax, but only 33 percent support a two-cent
tax. Pollsters questioned 420 state residents registered to vote who said
they did vote in most elections.</BLOCKQUOTE>

the Associated Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
U.S. Highway 1 remained closed Tuesday so that officials from the state
Department of Agriculture's Division of Forestry and the Metro-Dade Fire
Department could start backfires, which fight the existing fire by using
a controlled burn. High winds made fighting the fire difficult from the

<H3><STRONG>Jax finance committee votes against lowering scheduled water
rate increase</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE --(EnviroWorld)-- The Jacksonville City Councils's
Finance and Administration Committee went against the advice of city auditors
and voted down a proposal that would have lessened a scheduled increase
for water and sewage, the Florida Times-Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
The increase, which is part of a five-year rate increase plan, would raise
water rates by almost 17 percent and sewer rates by 6 percent. But Council
Auditor Bob Johnson said the utility department has sufficient funds to
handle this year's priority projects already. Auditors reported that the
department posted a $9 million surplus for the fiscal year that ended in
September.<BR>
<BR>
Council President Dick Kravitz had suggested that the rate increase scheduled
for 1996 be spread out over three years, and then agreed to a plan that
would have split the increase into one-third this year and two-thirds next
year. The finance committee voted against that. Another committee votes
on Kravitz's proposal today, and the full council will consider the proposal
next week.<BR>
<BR>
The utilities department director, James Chansler, wants to start 22 new
projects with the $7.8 million that would be raised from the scheduled increase
this year.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON --(EnviroWorld)-- Despite support in the U.S. House
of Representatives, the Marine Fish Conservation Network believes that special
interest groups will try to weaken a fisheries conservation and management
act due for a vote in the U.S. Senate, the organization's press release
said.<BR>
<BR>
The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the nation's primary
tool for protecting U.S. fisheries, expired in 1993. Reauthorization is
pending on an upcoming Senate vote. The 20-year-old Magnuson law was reauthorized
in the House by a 388-37 vote. The House bill contains three amendments
to the old law that would stop overfishing, protect marine habitats, and
reduce bycatch--the non-target species of marine life thrown overboard dead
or dying.<BR>
<BR>
The conservation group said they fear larger fishing operations from the
northwest and northeast will lobby to get the billed weakened in the Senate.</BLOCKQUOTE>

rules on informing buyers and tenants about lead announced</STRONG> </H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)--If you sell or lease out a home,
a new government rule will make you responsible for telling a potential
buyer or tenant about lead-based paint, the Orlando Sentinel reported. The
rule was announced Wednesday and will take effect later this year.<BR>
<BR>
Lead-based paint has caused about 1.7 million poisonings to American children.

<H3><STRONG>Muck farmers on Lake Apopka want state to buy their land</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--Without question Lake Apopka is
a pollution nightmare, and muck-farming practices around the lake have contributed
to that problem. But as legislators move to tighten regulations on the runoff
from those farms which feeds the lake-choking algae, the farmers are saying
they would just assume the state buy them out, the Orlando Sentinel reported.
<BR>
<BR>
The asking price is $95 million for their 15,000 acres.<BR>
<BR>
The 13 farmers met with Rep. Everett Kelly, D-Tavares, Rep. Bill Sublette,
R-Orlando, Sen. Buddy Dyer, D-Orlando, and Sen. Rick Dantzler, D-Winter
Haven on Wednesday. Kelley embraced the proposal and said he believed federal
and state money could be found for the buyout if Orange and Lake Counties
also chipped in.<BR>
<BR>
But Sublette was less enthusiastic. Though he called the plan a &quot;perfect
solution,&quot; Sublette doubted that funding the acquisition would be so
easy. Sublette also said he would continue to support bills to tighten pollution
restrictions and make the farmers pay $2 million to partially pay for retention
ponds.<BR>
<BR>
While bringing muck-farming to an end around Lake Apopka would stop a major
pollution source, it still faces many lingering pollution problems. Scientists
believe the heavy pollutant load is responsible for a variety of sexual
mutations they have observed in the lake's fish, alligators and turtles.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Turtles may get a little more protection on Volusia beaches
this year</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>DELAND--(EnviroWorld)--Driving on Volusia county's beaches got
tough last year as turtle protection became a court issue. This year, though
the matter is still in court, the restrictions may get even a little tighter,
the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
The rules in place last year kept cars from driving within 30 feet of dunes
or seawalls during turtle nesting season, which runs from May to October.
All night driving was completely banned on the beaches. This year, cars
will also be completely prohibited from any areas deemed likely turtle nesting
areas.<BR>
<BR>
The rules come from U.S. District Judge Anne Conway, who is presiding over
the lawsuit brought against the county that claims Volusia violates the
Endangered Species Act by allowing cars on its beaches. The judge has issued
the temporary restrictions while the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reviews
a county conservation plan. If approved, that plan would save the county
from the lawsuit.<BR>
<BR>
The county's plan has most of the features of the current restrictions,
but would allow driving within 15 feet of dunes and seawalls in those areas
that are unlikely turtle nesting spots.<BR>
<BR>
The 30 foot limit effectively banned driving during the highest tides last
year.<BR>
<BR>
Assistant county Attorney Jamie Seaman told the Sentinel that enforcement
of the outright ban in the high-risk nesting areas could begin as soon as
adequate off-beach parking sites are available.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>NAVARRE--(EnviroWorld)--State Road 87 in southern Santa Rosa
county is the only route to I-10, and safety, for many of the county's 90,000
residents, but the 20-mile stretch of narrow, twisting, two-lane highway
is deadly and residents want it improved before a natural disaster strikes.<BR>
<BR>
They may have to hold their breaths for a long time. While the Florida Department
of Transportation will hold a hearing March 14 in Holly on a proposal to
widen the highway, officials said it would probably be 10 years before the
$47 million needed to do the work is available.<BR>
<BR>
This fall $18.5 million will be spent on improvements to the road, but residents
compared that work to putting a band-aid on a gaping wound. Nor does a proposed
bridge 15 miles away alleviate their fears. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I hate to think somebody famous has to get killed on this road, or
that people have to be trapped in a hurricane, before something gets done,&quot;
Navarre businessman Gordon Goodin said Tuesday.<BR>

<H3><STRONG>Federal jury convicts developer and his companies for destroying
wetlands</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON D.C. -- (EnviroWorld) -- After a seven week trial,
a federal jury returned guilty verdicts on four felony counts against a
developer and his two companies for illegally destroying wetlands in violation
of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. <BR>
<BR>
The Greenbelt, Md. jury returned the guilty verdicts Feb. 29 against James
J. Wilson, Interstate General Co. (IGC), L.P., and St. Charles Associates,
L.P. Wilson is the chairman of IGC, a real estate development company operating
in Puerto Rico, Maryland and Washington, D.C. <BR>
<BR>
St. Charles Associates, L.P., is a related partnership, which owns the land
where the crimes occurred. The violations, which began in 1988 and continued
through 1993, occured at four separate sites, which are part of the Potomac
River watershed, located in St. Charles, a planned community in Charles
County, Md. <BR>
<BR>
Government witnesses testified that the defendants illegally filled nearly
70 acres of federally protected wetlands at these four locations, although
the defendants knew that the sites had been protected wetlands and permits
from the Army Corps of Engineers were required. <BR>
<BR>
According to evidence presented at the trial, as early as April 1988, the
defendants received such warnings from their own consultants. These warnings
were repeated by other consultants in 1989 and 1990. <BR>
<BR>
Wilson faces three years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine for each felony
count. The partnership defendants face a $500,000 fine for each felony count,
or a fine of $50,000 per day of violation, whichever is greater. Sentencing
has been scheduled for May 17. A civil action seeking injunctive relief,
restoration of the destroyed wetland areas and civil penalties is also pending.
EPA's Criminal Investigation Division was the lead investigative agency
on the case, with assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG -- (EnviroWorld) -- According to the Tampa Tribune,
a truck spilled a 200 foot long trail of sludge onto the southbound lanes
of the Sunshine Skyway Wednesday morning when the driver slammed on his
brakes to avoid hitting another vehicle, the Florida Highway Patrol reported.<BR>
<BR>
Ray Crawley was driving the truck southbound on the north end of the Skyway
when he tried to change lanes and found the right lane was blocked by a
maintenance truck. When he swerved to avoid a crash and hit his brakes,
the load of sludge he was carrying shifted forward and dumped onto the cab

<BLOCKQUOTE>ROCK BLUFF -- (EnviroWorld) -- Opponents of a proposed 750-cow
dairy in northeastern Dixie County say they will file a lawsuit to appeal
a proposed permit being issued by the state, the Gainesville Sun reported.
Opponents of the dairy, off County Road 340 near Rock Bluff, fear it will
pollute groundwater and the nearby Suwannee River.<BR>
<BR>
The Department of Environmental Protection has issued the permit to Robert
Piechocki of Chiefland after a hearing officer last month sided with the
department. DEP officials have said the dairy permit application was given
stringent review and has met requirements under state rules.<BR>
<BR>
Dairies have caused nitrate pollution to groundwater as a result of runoff
from cow patties.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>New wildlife handbook looks at armadillos to vultures</STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>FT. LAUDERDALE -- (EnviroWorld) -- From a fish farm in Arkansas
to a canal in Broward County, 10,000 Triploid grass carp will arrive by
truck tomorrow to help the South Florida Water Management District Combat
aquatic vegetation that has heavily impacted the C-13 canal in Fort Lauderdale.<BR>
<BR>
The spread of hydrilla has been controlled through herbicide applications,
but it has not been effective in controlling hygrophila, an aquatic plant
native of India discovered in Florida in the early 1980's. The Triploid
grass carp enjoy dining on hygrophila, therefore the fish could help control
the crowding vegetation.<BR>
<BR>
Before the grass carp are released into the C-13, water will be piped from
the canal into holding tanks to acclimate the fish to the warmer water temperature.
After about an hour a chute will be opened and the fish will slide into
the canal.<BR>
<BR>
Since C-13 is popular with fishermen for its catfish, bass and bluegill,
the district is asking those who catch the grass carp to release them.<BR>
<BR>
The carp are sterile and are raised specifically to control aquatic vegetation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE --(EnviroWorld)-- Boaters respond better to education
about the effect their activities have on the coastal ecology than to regulations,
according to a study by a University of Florida researcher. The study found
that boaters care about the environment and respond well to campaigns that
educate them about sea-grass beds, corals and other sensitive areas, the
Associated Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
The study, performed by UF geography professor Gustavo Antonini for UF's
Sea Grant College and the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, assembled
data from the past eight years. It showed that regulations to keep boats
from anchoring in various locations left many confused, but informing them
of the impact of their actions had a much greater effect.<BR>
<BR>
Over half of the boaters changed their anchoring habits after they had been
taught about the impact their vessels had on the environment, Antonini said.

<BLOCKQUOTE>INVERNESS --(EnviroWorld)-- Contaminated soil beneath the site
of a former Amoco station will delay efforts to beautify downtown Inverness
for nine months to a year, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
The contamination under the former gas station is more extensive then originally
thought, City Manager Frank DiGiovanni told the Inverness City Council.
The city should not have to excavate the dirt from the site, but drafting
an alternative plan could take as long as a year because of the various
state agencies involved, DiGiovani added. Possible solutions include the
use of biodegradable enzymes that can digest the oil.<BR>
<BR>
The cleanup will be financed by the state, which bought the property in
1991 as part of the S.R. 44 widening project. The city wants to use the
land for parking and as a landscaped formal entrance to the city.<BR>
<BR>
Plans are also under way to remove weeds and muck from Cooter Pond, to buy
land around the pond for a park and to expand Wallace Brooks Park at the

<BLOCKQUOTE>DUNEDIN -- (EnviroWorld) -- The state Department of Environmental
Protection is buying a machine that will pick up rocks on the beach of Honeymoon
Island in an attempt to bring back beach goers, the St. Petersburg Times
reported.<BR>
<BR>
The machine, which costs $62,000, will pick up rocks , drop them in a bin
and leave behind well-sifted sand. It also picks up bottles, dead fish,
seaweed and other debris. Officials hope to start the process this summer.
It is part of a $750,000 project, which includes improving parking lots
on the island.<BR>
<BR>
Officials hope that removing the rocks will create sand dunes that will
prevent erosion.<BR>
<BR>
Honeymoon Island's beach became stone-filled as a result of a development
attempt in the 1960s, which left about 1.5-million cubic yards of rocks.

<STRONG>ERC member resigns, Batchelor says Big Sugar may be behind complaints</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--Environmental Regulatory Commission
member Nancy Roen, who is also a lawyer for Florida Power &amp; Light, has
resigned from the commission, the St. Petersburg Times reported. Roen's
resignation letter was dated Feb. 29, eight days after members of the state
Senate's Natural Resources Committee had refused to approve her nomination
to the board for a new term.<BR>
<BR>
At that hearing, ERC members were harshly criticized by most Senate committee
members, who cited a number of faceless complaints against the ERC. <BR>
<BR>
ERC Chairman Dick Batchelor, who bore the brunt of criticism at the nomination
hearing, said that the Sugar Industry may be behind some of the anonymous
complaints leveled against commission members because the ERC will soon
be deciding how much phosphorous the industry will be allowed to discharge
into the Everglades.<BR>
<BR>
That industry would stand to benefit from an ERC with less independence
than the Batchelor-led commission that currently sets environmental standards.<BR>
<BR>
At the end of the Feb. 21 Senate committee hearing, Roen was also asked
about her efforts to help Florida Power &amp; Light Co. secure permission
to burn Orimulsion, a Venezuelan tar fuel that has come under fire from
environmental groups. <BR>
<BR>
Roen had called two Department of Environmental Protection officials to
discuss the utility's Orimulsion permit application, and had said the calls
did not create a conflict of interest. Roen was asked about those phone
calls by Sen. Charlie Crist, R-St. Petersburg at the committee hearing,
but the hearing ended before Roen could reply.<BR>
<BR>
Florida Power &amp; Light won Department of Environmental Protection approval
to become the first U.S. utility to burn Orimulsion, and a state hearing
officer upheld the proposed permit. The final decision is up to Gov. Lawton
Chiles and the Cabinet. <BR>
<BR>
Batchelor told the Times he felt Roen was one the best members of the commission.
He faces another hearing before the Natural Resources Committee over his
reappointment. A date for that hearing has not been set, however Batchelor
is supposed to meet with some members of the committee Wednesday.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>HERNANDO BEACH--(EnviroWorld)--A 3-year-old manatee found trapped
in a small pool of 55-degree water near Weekie Wachee, was taken to Lowry
Park Zoo in Tampa Monday, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
The 700 pound animal was suffering from cold-water stress, which caused
a skin discoloration like &quot;freezer-burned meat,&quot; a zoo official
told the Times. <BR>
<BR>
Zoo officials said that it will take at least a week to determine the seriousness
of the animal's condition. <BR>
<BR>
Four other manatees suffering from cold water stress have been taken to
the Lowry Park Zoo this year. The other manatees, two of whom died, came
from the Fort Myers area. The zoo is one of three critical-care centers
for manatees in the state. <BR>
<BR>
Experts attribute the unusually large number of cold water stress victims
to colder than average water temperatures. Normally at this time of year,
manatees swim along the coast without incident.</BLOCKQUOTE>

marina in Citrus County.</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CRYSTAL RIVER--(EnviroWorld)--Two environmental groups said
Monday they plan to petition the state Department of Environmental Protection
for a hearing to challenge a large, private marina in northwest Citrus County,
the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
The Save the Manatee Club and Cross Florida Greenways Coalition hope to
stop developer Jim Eyster from building the proposed 600-boat marina, called
Nature Coast Landings, on 135 acres just east of U.S. 19. The marina would
provide access to the barge canal about 4 1/2 miles from the Gulf of Mexico.
<BR>
<BR>
The project has been stalled for 13 years because of concerns about saltwater
intrusion and the harmful effect such a large operation would have on the
endangered manatee. <BR>
<BR>
DEP gave its tentative approval to permit the project last month after the
Southwest Florida Water Management District changed its ruling on the possibility
of saltwater intrusion. District officials told the Times they were satisfied
Eyster's project would not adversely affect water quality. <BR>
<BR>
The environmental groups disagree with that assessment and plan to bring
their own test results before the hearing officer. <BR>
<BR>
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, DEP Office of Greenways and Trails, the
Governor and the Cabinet also must sign off on the plans. </BLOCKQUOTE>

residents, environment</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA--(EnviroWorld)--A Monday morning rush hour accident involving
a gas tanker forced the evacuation of hundreds of people and caused an environmental
scare, the St. Petersburg Times and Tampa Tribune reported. The tanker spilled
about 4,000 gallons of gas onto S. Dale Mabry Highway after it hit another
car and was rammed by two vans.<BR>
<BR>
The fuel flowed into sewer drains under an eight-block neighborhood, forcing
the evacuation of 1,800 students at Plant High School and many homes in
Palma Ceia. No serious injuries were reported.<BR>
<BR>
Before trucks arrived from the state Department of Transportation, firefighters
used dirt to build dams around a ditch receiving the gas. Hazardous-materials
teams, including Bartow-based American Compliance Technologies, responded
from Tampa, Hillsborough and Pinellas counties and MacDill Air Force Base.
Fuel was pumped from manholes, the drainage ditch, and the damaged tanker
into another truck. <BR>
<BR>
Vapor concentration readings were also taken from area manholes and foam
was sprayed over the road to help minimize the possibility of an explosion.<BR>
<BR>
Officials told the Tribune that about a half-million gallons of gasoline-polluted
water needs to be pumped from the ditch. Soil contaminated by the gas will
also have to be removed.<BR>
<BR>
Authorities let people back into their homes around 7 p.m. However, some
lanes of affected roads will continue to be closed as cleanup continues.

<BLOCKQUOTE>SAFETY HARBOR--(EnviroWorld)--The West Coast Regional Water
Supply Authority struggled Monday to come up with a payment formula for
the development of water resources, the Tampa Tribune reported. Five entities
served by the authority -- Pasco, Pinellas, and Hernando counties, and Tampa
and St. Petersburg -- each must pay a share for the development.<BR>
<BR>
Those entities would prefer to pay based on the percentage of water they
could count on from those sources, but they disagree on whether all members
should pay to replace water from existing wellfields if new restrictions
force reductions in pumping.<BR>
<BR>
The Authority will continue debating the issue April 8.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- As a northeaster wind tore
through Northeast Florida yesterday, many beach renourishment projects were
ripped apart. From Amelia Island to Jupiter Inlet, officials along Florida's
coast reported minor erosion, high winds and turbulent seas, leaving Florida's
east coast looking tattered, according to the Florida Times Union. <BR>
<BR>
Atlantic Beach Public Works Director Bob Kosoy reported that only half of
the sand from a renourishment project last summer remained north of 15th
Street and only one third of the new sand remained south of 15th Street.
<BR>
<BR>
In addition, South Jacksonville Beach lost many of the sea oats and beach
grass installed last fall. The installment cost about $200,000 and much
of the vegetation was either washed away or covered by sand or water, reported
the Times Union<BR>
<BR>
An Army Corps of Engineers spokesperson said the extent of the damage will
be better known at the end of the week.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- According to a report released
late last week, the Jacksonville Naval Air Station ranked 10th among U.S.
military facilities in the emission of toxic chemicals, the Florida Times
Union reported. A total of 325,648 pounds of chemicals were either discharged
into the environment or shipped off base for disposal treatment.<BR>
<BR>
In 1993 President Clinton signed an order that required federal agencies
to reduce their emissions and offsite transfers by 50 percent by 1999 and
Bill Dougherty, a base spokesman, told the Times Union the Naval Aviation
Depot is working to reduce those emissions. <BR>
<BR>
According to Dougherty, the base is on its way to reducing hazardous air
emissions by 80 percent by 1998. In addition, the depot has managed to eliminate
5.2 million pounds of hazardous waste per year for nearly two years through
process improvements.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WEST PALM BEACH -- (EnviroWorld) -- Ray Santee, senior civil
engineer at the South Florida Water Management District, has been named
&quot;Employee of the Year&quot; for his technical assistance in helping
with Florida Bay restoration efforts. <BR>
<BR>
In 1995, the district's Florida Bay team was facing tight deadlines to complete
computer modeling for modifying water deliveries to Everglades National
Park. When an obstacle emerged and threatened to shut down the sixth test
iteration of the experimental water deliveries to the Park, Santee, a member
of the planning department's hydrologic monitoring division worked day and
night to solve the problem.<BR>
<BR>
Santee was able to modify computer modeling to accurately assess 14 water
management alternatives. In addition, the modeling work was shared with
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Everglades National Park.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- State and national environmental
groups and scientists are rallying to block construction of a fishing pier
at Juno Beach in north Palm Beach County. After postponing a vote last month,
Governor Chiles and the Florida Cabinet will try again today to decide whether
to approve construction of what would be the state's largest fishing pier.<BR>
<BR>
The Caribbean Conservation Corporation, Sea Turtle Survival League and Center
for Marine Conservation are some of the groups urging the Governor and Cabinet
to deny permission to Palm Beach County to build the pier at Juno Beach.<BR>
<BR>
Several other sites in north Palm Beach County, including an expanded Jupiter
Inlet jetty, would not pose as severe a threat to marine turtles, and can
be used for fishing according to the Sea Turtle Survival League.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON, D.C.--(EnviroWorld)--Federal regulations, court
orders and competition have combined to convince paper companies that cleaner
pulp mills are good business goals, the New York Times reported yesterday.<BR>
<BR>
For example, Weyerhaeuser's mill on the Flint River in Oglethorpe, Georgia,
used to emit 40 million gallons of polluted water a day. Today, however,
the figure is down to 11 million gallons, and the company, like other paper
companies, has the goal of reducing contaminated water discharges down to
zero.<BR>
<BR>
Zero-discharge plants, however, are not just around the corner. Various
&quot;complex chemical problems&quot; remain to be solved, according to
a Union Camp Corporation executive, and 100% recycling of water used in
the production process will be very expensive, according to industry executives.
<BR>
<BR>
Other aspects of paper making are undergoing re-engineering. For example,
paper mills are extracting substances that used to be treated as wastes,
and recycling or marketing them. <BR>

Scandinavia</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GENEVA--(EnviroWorld)--Record low ozone levels were recorded
in Britain and Scandinavia this winter, exposing inhabitants to some of
the worst levels of ultraviolet radiation recorded in densely populated
areas, the World Meteorological Organization said Tuesday.<BR>
<BR>
Ozone depletion, which is linked to man-made chemicals, has been made worse
by unusually cold winter temperatures in the region.<BR>
<BR>
Regional ozone levels during January, February and the early part of March
averaged about 30 percent below the average levels recorded between 1957
and 1978. On some days late in that period, levels were as much as 45 percent
below those averages, setting records for the Northern Hemisphere.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Nassau County beaches at risk</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--This week's stormy Northeastern
winds caused serious erosion to northeast Florida Beaches, and officials
say that without Federal money for beach renourishment, homes on the coast
may be in peril, the Florida Times-Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
Beaches as far south as Jupiter Inlet in Central Florida have suffered significant
erosion from the storm, but local governments will have to find new ways
to repair those beaches following a Clinton Administration decision to end
federal funding of beach renourishment.<BR>
<BR>
Governments contracts already in place for renourishment won't be broken,
though. Jacksonville entered a 50-year contract with the Army Corp of Engineers
in 1994, for example. Nassau and St. Johns counties have no such agreements,
however.<BR>
<BR>
The high-tide mark at Fernandina Beach in Nassau County is 14 feet closer
to homes following last week's storm, the Times-Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
In Volusia County, the Orlando Sentinel reported that up to 24 feet of sand
was lost after the area received 5 inches of rain Sunday and Monday. Sand
dunes on Daytona Beach that had begun to replenish themselves were also
damaged, which decreases space human beach-goers who have had to give up
beach for sea-turtle conservation. The storm has also caused high surf,
and raised concerns about dangerous riptides.</BLOCKQUOTE>

in Orange County </STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO--(EnviroWorld)--Another round was decided Tuesday in
a battle between Orange County workers, who claim that a county courthouse
caused health problems for them, and the county government.<BR>
<BR>
The latest issue involved a civil rights lawsuit claiming that the county
had engaged in a coverup. A U.S. District Judge threw out that case, citing
a lack of evidence. The county then sued the workers for $300,000 for filing
a frivolous case. Tuesday, U.S. Magistrate James Glazebrook ruled against
the frivolity claim and said that the county could only recover about $20,000
in expenses.<BR>
<BR>
The workers have already won workers compensation claims in which a state
judge found that the Magnolia Avenue courthouse had caused or aggravated
illnesses. One retired court deputy was diagnosed with asbestos disease.
<BR>
The county is conducting a $100,000 cleanup of air ducts this month for
routine maintenance, but it claims the building is safe. The workers' lawyers
say a Feb.5 inspection showed dangerous levels of bacteria and asbestos
still exist in the building.</BLOCKQUOTE>

water-pumping</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- Water woes warmed up in Tampa Bay
when Rep. Carl Littlefield filed a bill last week that would give counties
the power to veto requests to pump large amounts of water. In addition,
the bill allows these counties to ask that current pumping be reduced if
it causes environmental damage, according to the Tampa Tribune.<BR>
<BR>
Pinellas County and St. Petersburg receive most of their water from wells
in Hillsborough and Pasco counties. Southwest Florida Water Management District
officials say the pumping has dried up many lakes and wetlands within the
counties. <BR>
<BR>
However, this bill could affect current or proposed wells drawing more than
five million gallons a day. Many officials believe the bill will not pass
through both houses intact, so Pinellas and Hillsborough lawmakers met Tuesday
to discuss the possibility of coming to terms with this controversial water
issue.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Rep. Littlefield has a certain agenda for a certain small area that
he represents,&quot; Sen. Jack Latvala told the Tribune on Tuesday. &quot;What's
going to happen to the three-quarters of a million people in Pinellas County
that won't have any water to drink?&quot; </BLOCKQUOTE>

of melaleuca</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The House Natural Resource Committee
passed a bill on Tuesday that will require homeowners to destroy melaleuca
trees on their property by Jan. 1, 1998, according to the Orlando Sentinel.
The melaluca trees were imported from Australia as an ornamental plant,
but in wet areas such as the Everglades, they crowd out native plants and
reduce surrounding ground. <BR>
<BR>
Homeowners within a city with properties of two acres or less, and owners
with 5 acres or less in rural areas, would be required to remove the trees.
The most controversial part of the bill is that cities could pass laws giving
them authority to remove melaleuca and then bill homeowners.<BR>
<BR>
Some officials believe the bill could unfairly burden landowners. &quot;If
you're up in years and you ask a company to come in and remove five or six
melaleuca trees, you're going to spend $500 to $1,500,&quot; Rep. John Laurent,
R-Bartow, told the Sentinel.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CRYSTAL RIVER -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Public Service Commission
and consumers' attorneys are requesting the dismissal of a $18.1 million
rate increase by Southern States Utilities of Apopka, according to the St.
Petersburg Times.<BR>
<BR>
The request to throw out the rate request stems from what officials believe
were unethical and improper communication methods the utility used to let
consumers know about the possible rate increase.<BR>
<BR>
According to the Times, SSU held private meetings, which left consumers
with the impression that they could have no impact on the rate increase
decision. <BR>
<BR>
SSU spokes woman Ida Roberts said the utility never tried to discourage
consumers from seeking help from Public Counsel to prevent a rate increase
or that the increase was already decided.<BR>
<BR>
The rate increase would affect Citrus and Pasco county customers. Mike Twomey,
a Tallahassee attorney, is representing the SSU customers who are looking
to have the rate increase denied.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We believe SSU has consistently misled its customers at every turn
through private meetings with customers suggesting SSU would get a guaranteed
increase no matter what,&quot; Twomey told the Times. &quot;Through letters
and bill inserts misleading customers on their maximum rate increases, and
through communications with governmental officials.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

deaths</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--Navy representatives have been
asked to appear before the U.S. House Resources Committee today to discuss
operations taking place in the right whale calving area, the Florida Times-Union
reported.<BR>
<BR>
So far this season, five right whales have died in that area, which covers
coastal waters from Brunswick, Ga. to St. Augustine. The right whale is
the most endangered of all large whales with an estimated population of
about 300.<BR>
<BR>
Wednesday, the Boston Globe reported that Navy ships and offshore exercises
may have caused the deaths. Navy officials told the Times-Union that no
evidence existed that the Navy was to blame. However Christopher Slay, research
director of the New England Aquarium's Right Whale Research Project, said
shock waves associated with underwater explosions could rupture the whales'
eardrums. Scientists with the project, which monitors the whales off Florida
and warns nearby ships of the whale's presence, have found dead calves with
ruptured eardrums and believe the trauma and resulting stress may have led
to the calves death. <BR>
<BR>
In addition, two adult males have been killed in collisions with ships since
calving season began in November. Slay said responsibility for the deaths
is unclear, and that scientists are reviewing necropsies performed on the
dead whales.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Navy is outside the designated critical habitat. Unfortunately,
the whales don't really obey the lines drawn on our maps,&quot; he told
the Times-Union. Slay said the Navy had been cooperative with the conservation
efforts, but a study was needed to look at how the whales used the area
where the Navy conducts its exercises.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(Associated Press)--The Clinton administration and
Senate Democrats demanded Wednesday that the Senate ease planned cuts in
environmental programs, asking for an additional $892 million for those
programs.<BR>
<BR>
That amount would keep environmental spending below 1995 levels, but would
cut slack for the embattled Environmental Protection Agency, the National
Park Service, and the Energy Department.<BR>

That dispute and other partisan issues assured that the bill will not be
enacted by tomorrow, the day temporary spending authority expires for many
government agencies. Republican leaders plan to push legislation through
Congress today keeping programs running for another week.<BR>
In other legislative action Wednesday, the Senate refused to lift the freeze
on the Endangered Species Act. The freeze prevents extending protections
to any new plants and animals. The vote was 51 to 49. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency and the U.S. Customs Service have strengthened joint efforts to protect
Americans from hazardous wastes and other dangerous pollutants like CFCs
imported into the United States.<BR>
<BR>
Steve Herman, EPA's Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance
Assurance said, &quot;This action will help stop individuals and groups
who profit by smuggling hazardous waste and dangerous substances into this
country. Those who would bring illegal, hazardous materials within our territory
will be caught and prosecuted.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The agreement comes on the heels of the U.S.'s first extradition of a fugitive
charged with environmental crimes. In December, Bruce Burrell, a former
Miami resident, was arrested by INTERPOL authorities in San Jose, Costa
Rica. Burrell had been indighted on money laundering charges in connection
with the smuggling of an ozone-depleting refrigerant, CFC-12.<BR>
<BR>
Herman and Customs Commissioner George Weise have signed a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) which outlines the joint agency efforts.<BR>
<BR>
Weise said, &quot;Customs is on the job, on the border, whether the contraband
is drugs, hazardous waste or ozone-depleting substances like CFC's. Last
year we seized over one million pounds of CFCs, second in quantity only
to illegal narcotics. Working with EPA, we'll fight the pollution fight
on the border cheaper, smarter, faster, better.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Both EPA and the Customs Service have seen an increase in violations of
transboundary environmental laws over the last several years. The EPA, working
closely with Customs, has conducted 16 investigations of illegal CFC smuggling
during the last 18 months, resulting in 11 indictments and nine convictions
so far. </BLOCKQUOTE>

asks Clinton to keep beach nourishment</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE --(EnviroWorld)-- U.S. Rep. Clay Shaw (R-Fla.)
and 50 other members of Congress have asked President Clinton and his White
House staff not to cut $1 billion over the next five years from U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers beach renourishment projects, the Associated Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
In a letter sent to Clinton, Shaw asked the president to reconsider the
cuts that appear in his fiscal 1997 budget because of the adverse effects
the modification of the Army Corps' role would have on the coastal communities
of the country, especially in Florida.<BR>
<BR>
Beach renourishment involves countering the effects of erosion. The Corps
spends $10 million to $20 million a year on beach renourishment in Florida.
Shaw said the counter-erosion efforts are necessary to keep the beaches
a major tourist draw, and state and local governments would not be able
to pick up the slack.<BR>
<BR>
The Corps have been told that existing projects would not be hindered by
the cuts, only new renourishment projects would be affected, said Ed Albanesi,
a spokesman for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Jacksonville.</BLOCKQUOTE>

a mystery to scientists</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>SANIBEL --(EnviroWorld)-- In the last 10 days, 27 manatees have
been confirmed dead and six more were reported but not confirmed on Thursday,
leaving scientists struggling to figure out why, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
All but two of the recent wave of dead manatees have come from the 40-mile
length of coastal water between Lemon Bay in Sarasota County and Estero
Bay, near Fort Myers. None were killed by humans.<BR>
<BR>
This year, 115 manatees died in just 75 days. A total of 201 died in 1995,
the second-worst year ever for manatees. In February of this year, a record
2,636 manatees were counted, which was at first thought to be a reason why
so many were being found dead.<BR>
<BR>
But the chief of the Department of Environmental Protection, Ken Haddad,
said that pathologists and biologists are concentrating on other possible
causes of the deathwave, including unseasonably cold weather, high concentrations
of red tide and a bacterial form of pneumonia that has been found to be
the cause of death in some cases, but not all. It could also be a combination
of all three.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the dead manatees were about 15 years old and about 10 feet long.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>LAKELAND --(EnviroWorld)-- Fruit prices are up more than 20
percent from last season and citrus blooms are opening on schedule, making
this season look like a good one, the Tampa Tribune reported. But farmers
are concerned about what the brown citrus aphid could do to their crops.<BR>
<BR>
The cold weather did not affect this year's blooms, farmers said. The state
expects to harvest 202 million 90-pound boxes of oranges, according to the
Agriculture Department.<BR>
<BR>
The aphid causes worry because it spreads a virus called tristeza from infected
to uninfected trees. The virus attacks the tree roots and kills the tree.
The aphid was found in Cuba in 1993, and later was reported in South Florida.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ODESSA --(EnviroWorld)-- Environs, which produces an energy-efficient
heat pump and heat recovery units, expects to hire 20 to 30 more people
by the end of the year, due to increased product demand and a friendly takeover,
the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
The company, which was originally called Conservation Products International
Inc., was bought by Energy Technologies, a Miami-based company that invests
in energy saving products last month. After the purchase, the company changed
its name to Environs. <BR>
<BR>
The company's chief engineer, Tom Hebert, came up with the idea for the
unique heat pump and recovery unit in 1987. The dual source heat pump draws
heat both from the air and the ground, while most pumps draw from one or
the other. The heat recovery unit transfers wasted heat from the air conditioner
to the hot water heater by using the difference in the weight of the cool
water and hot water.</BLOCKQUOTE>

a dispute over the border</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CARROLLWOOD --(EnviroWorld)-- Residents of Original Carrollwood
believed they had settled their dispute with developer Bob Gomez, who is
going to build a Taco Bell on N. Dales Mabry Highway, south of Ehrlich Road.
The Hillsborough City Commission approved a light commercial buffer between
the homes and the restaurant, but Gomez wants to start work before the buffer
is completed, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
The buffer was supposed to include four to six residential-style medical
office buildings, lots of oak trees and a surrounding 8-foot concrete wall.
The residents could live with that. But about three weeks ago, Gomez informed
the homeowners he would not be building the 8-foot wall. Instead he would
add on to an existing wall, and begin working on the Taco Bell as soon as
the addition to the wall began.<BR>
<BR>
The homeowners believe Gomez is not correctly interpreting the commissioners
vote, and say that he is &quot;just trying to do the very minimum.&quot;
The residents have taken the matter back to the commission.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>OCALA -- (EnviroWorld) -- Members of the House Resource Management
Subcommittee have decided to revise mangrove trimming policies, according
to the Orlando Sentinel. <BR>
<BR>
Under a bill passed on Thursday (HB 975), special permits would be required
to trim a mangrove stand more than 25 feet wide. In addition, no more than
two-thirds of the trees on any shoreline can be cut back. The bill also
prohibits most mangrove trimming on government-owned conservation lands.
<BR>
<BR>
Many residents trim mangrove trees to enhance their water views in coastal
areas. However, mangroves help shelter and nourish many coastal animals,
in addition to stabilizing the shoreline.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Associated Press has reported
that children born to Vietnam veterans may be at increased risk of spina
bifida, a birth defect, according to the latest scientific review of health
problems linked to the chemical Agent Orange. An association was also found
between the chemical and a nerve disorder that can cause temporary numbness
or pain.<BR>
<BR>
Agent Orange was a herbicide used to defoliate trees in the jungles of Vietnam
beginning in 1962. The study is the second in a series of Institute of Medicine
reports on the chemical to find out if there are any more connections between
the chemical and diseases.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We still do not know the precise degree of risk from Agent Orange
exposure for individual Vietnam veterans, but the base of research has improved,&quot;
Dr. David Tollerud, chairman of the committee and director of environmental
medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health,
said in a statement.</BLOCKQUOTE>

caution must be followed</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CARROLLWOOD -- (EnviroWorld) -- As Hillsborough County's water
restrictions increased, so did gardeners' use of reclaimed water. The St.
Petersburg Times reported that though the use of reclaimed water is helpful
to growers, there are some words of caution to follow.<BR>
<BR>
Lou Kavouras, water conservation planner for the Southwest Florida Water
Management District, offered the Times some basic tips to follow when using
reclaimed water. A few tips mentioned include: 1) Never use reclaimed water
directly on salad crops unless those vegetables can be cooked, peeled or
skinned. 2) Be aware that some plants are sensitive to the salt content
of reclaimed water and can burn the leaves. 3) Gardeners should avoid the
temptation of over-watering.<BR>
<BR>
Reclaimed water is just one step down from drinking water, and Kavouras
said chemicals such as insecticides pose a greater risk for fruits and vegetables
then the use of reclaimed water.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;People should not be afraid of reclaimed water because it's an excellent
source of water for irrigation,&quot; Kavouras told the Times. &quot;The
benefits outweigh any problems we've seen.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

law not popular with all homeowners</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG--(EnviroWorld)--Some homeowners are disgruntled
over a mandatory melaleuca removal law that the legislature is considering,
the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
The bill would require property owners who live on five acres or less, or
owners of commercial property of two acres or less to remove the trees by
Dec. 31, 1998. After that, local governments could remove them and charge
the landowners. Larger tracts are not addressed.<BR>
<BR>
Melaleuca trees are not native to the state, but they became popular landscape
trees in South Florida, and were heavily planted in the Everglades by developers
because they soak up large amounts of water. However, the trees have no
enemies, such as insects, or disease that would control their spread, and
they have become a nemesis to Florida's native vegetation.<BR>
<BR>
Using aerial photographs, South Florida Water Management District officials
have calculated that the trees are covering the equivalent of 50 acres per
day in south Florida. The state has already about $150 million fighting
melaleucas and other exotic plants.<BR>
<BR>
The House committee approved the removal bill earlier this week. A companion
measure in the Senate has not come up for a vote. <BR>
<BR>
Supporters of the bills say homeowners should do their part. Rep. Mary Brennan,
D-Pinellas Park, told the Tribune that wind and birds can spread the seeds
around a neighborhood. <BR>
<BR>
``These are non-native plants that are destroying our bio-diversity,'' said
Brennan, who voted for the bill in the House Natural Resources Committee.
<BR>
<BR>
But some homeowners are upset that they may have to pay hundreds of dollars
for tree removal. And the bill could be an open invitation for unscrupulous
removal services.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>LAKE JESSUP--(EnviroWorld)--Work begins this week to heal Florida's
13th largest body of water, Lake Jessup, the Orlando Sentinel reported.
The16,000 acre lake, which once was a thriving lure for wildlife and people,
is now a thick soup of algae.<BR>
<BR>
The algae fed on nutrients in sewage and farm fertilizer that drained into
the lake, while the State Road 46 causeway and berms built to keep fields
dry hampered the lake's ability to clean its waters.<BR>
<BR>
One of those berms is now being removed through Department of Transportation
funding to compensate for the loss of wetlands caused by another DOT project.
The St. John's River Water Management District also plans to replant the
shoreline with native plants, and alter the landscape to increase surrounding
ponds and marshes.<BR>
<BR>
Additional funding for the cleanup is also being sought by Friends of Lake
Jessup through Rep. Bob Starks (R-Casselberry), who told the Sentinel he
would ask the House Appropriations committee today to fund the cleanup.</BLOCKQUOTE>

is attempting to form a state branch, the Orlando Sentinel reported. The
council emphasizes new areas of agriculture such as hydroponics, and places
an emphasis on research.<BR>
<BR>
Representatives from about a dozen organizations attended a meeting at Epcot
this month, including U.S. Sugar Corp., the International Institute for
Tropical Agriculture, the University of Florida, the USDA, the Florida Poultry
Federation, and the American Alligator Association.<BR>
<BR>
Nicholas Hollis, president of the National Agribusiness Council, said the
council was useful in dealing with &quot;transcendent&quot; agricultural
issues such as technology, and was less production oriented.<BR>
<BR>
If there is enough interest to sustain a Florida Agribusiness Council, it
would have to compete with older, entrenched organizations, such as the
Florida Farm Bureau, for members and their dues.</BLOCKQUOTE>

water power, warns Lt. Gov. MacKay</STRONG> </A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO--(EnviroWorld)--An Orlando Sentinel editorial expressed
concern with a plan being developed in Tallahassee that would give selected
cities autonomy over land-use plans and land and water permitting.<BR>
<BR>
The idea has received backing from the Florida League of Cities, but most
notable of the people involved with the plan is Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay. <BR>
<BR>
Though still in its conceptual stages, the Sentinel wonders how such autonomy
could also be compatible with water-management district plans, and the ecosystem
management approach of the Department of Environmental Protection.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE --(EnviroWorld)-- The Gainesville Sun reported that
Environmental Science and Engineering Inc. laid off a dozen employees last
week, most of whom were chemists and lab technicians at the Gainesville
analytical lab. This was the second layoff in six months at the company.<BR>
<BR>
Charles Kamps, vice-president of marketing and planning for ESE, said the
cuts were a result of &quot;a nationwide slowdown in environmental analytical
sampling, coupled with the federal government shutdown earlier and the storms
up North.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Last October, the company cut 100 jobs. Other cost-cutting efforts at ESE
included putting some employees at the analytical lab on reduced workweeks,
while others have been asked to take salary cuts.<BR>
<BR>
Kamp said the Gainesville office currently employs 300 people, compared
to 450 employees in spring 1994 according to Council for Economic Outreach
figures. <BR>

steps to boost enforcement</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON, D.C.--(EnviroWorld)--The Environmental Protection
Agency announced a new agency initiative aimed at identifying companies
that elude the regulatory system. Once identified, those companies could
be subject to criminal investigations. <BR>
<BR>
Announcing the policy, EPA Director of Criminal Enforcement Earl Devaney
said these companies are &quot;dissing EPA&quot; by not incorporating environmental
protection costs into their operations and disregarding environmental standards,<BR>
<BR>
The agency plans to use tools such as standard industrial classification
codes, number of employees, inspection records, and geographic area to help
identify the companies..<BR>
<BR>
The Agency also attempted to clarify what enforcement activities must be
retained at the federal level and not delegated to the states.<BR>
<BR>
Industry sources, however, dismissed Herman's memo as being a typical EPA
directive - while it theoretically limits EPA's authority, it still defines
all enforcement actions within those limits. &quot;This gives up virtually
nothing,&quot; noted one industry source, and &quot;does not spell out where
the boundary is.&quot; </BLOCKQUOTE>

cleanups reinforced by EPA policy </STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON, D.C.--(EnviroWorld)--The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency has announced it's support for risk-based cleanups with a partnership
it hopes will improve cleanup of petroleum from leaking underground storage
tanks.<BR>
<BR>
The EPA, state governments, the American Society for Testing and Materials,
Amoco Oil Corp., British Petroleum Oil Co., Chevron USA, Exxon Co. USA,
Mobil Oil Corp., and Shell Oil Co., will work together to target cleanups
of those tank releases which pose the greatest risk to public health and
the environment.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This partnership offers a common-sense, cost effective way to protect
public health by targeting the leaking tanks that pose the greatest risks
to public health and the environment,&quot; EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner
said. &quot;We look forward to working with industry and the states to achieve
better environmental results.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
This approach aims to ensure that high-risk sites receive the greatest attention
while still allowing cleanups to progress at all sites. Many states have
identified releases from underground storage tanks as the most common cause
of ground water contamination. As of the end of fiscal year 1995, states
and EPA had confirmed more than 303,000 releases from underground tanks
storing petroleum. Cleanups have already been completed at over 131,000
sites. With 600 new releases discovered each week, however, state environmental
programs face a growing cleanup workload.<BR>
<BR>
Under the agreement, each of the industry partners and EPA contributed $100,000
toward the development and delivery of a three- module series of training
sessions to be provided to states to teach the new risk-based approaches
to cleanup. In addition to contributing funding, industry partners will
provide technical expertise and resources, such as demonstration sites and
peer review assistance, to support states' efforts.<BR>
<BR>
Other groups that will contribute funding, technical expertise, or other
support to this effort include Unocal, the American Petroleum Institute,
the Petroleum Marketers Association of America, the Environmental Bankers
Association, and Environmental and Commercial Insurance Inc.<BR>
<BR>
Sixteen of the 43 participating states have already completed the training
to modify their clean-up programs and are moving toward incorporating risk-based
approaches. The Partnership's objective is to ensure that support is available
to any state underground storage tank program interested in designing a
risk based approach to cleanups.<BR>

disruptors released today</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--A book touted as the next &quot;Silent
Spring&quot; is slated for release today. &quot;Our Stolen Future&quot;
by zoologists Theo Colburn and John Peterson Myers and journalist Diane
Dumanoski brings to a head a large body of research in the area of hormone
disruptors.<BR>
<BR>
Dozens of chemicals in the environment have biochemical effects on human
and wildlife endocrine systems--systems which are most notably crucial to
reproduction. Whether the presence of these chemicals in the environment
is a human health concern is at the center of a very heated debate since
those chemcals have widespread uses and have enormous economic value.<BR>
<BR>
Scientists have established links between endocrine disruptor pollutants
and reproductive system defects in a variety of situations. What's more,
some scientists believe evidence indicates that human sperm counts are decreasing,
and testicular cancer and male genital defects are increasing worldwide.<BR>
<BR>
The Chemical Manufacturers Association stands to be the book's biggest detractor.</BLOCKQUOTE>

epidemic may be over, researchers puzzled</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>SANIBEL--(EnviroWorld)--The mystery remains, but the cause may
be gone, of what killed 51 manatees in two weeks along Southwest Florida,
the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
The animals, all large and healthy manatees, died from a mysterious pneumonia-like
illness, mostly in a 20-mile area between Charlotte Harbor and Sanibel near
Fort Myers. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;What we're seeing now is definitely the greatest single mortality
of manatees that we've ever recorded,&quot; Florida Marine Research Institute
chief Ken Haddad said. &quot;All of them have very similar symptoms.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Monday, the Institute's temporary lab in Sanibel closed after workers completed
the last of a long series of necropsies. Though not certain the string of
deaths was over, workers had found no more dead sirenians. <BR>
<BR>
It is still unclear what was killing the manatees. However, the dead animals
examined showed a pattern of lung lesions and bacterial pneumonia. An ongoing
program of water and near-shore soil sampling has not detected anything
out of the ordinary, DEP spokeswoman Edie Ousley told the Tribune.<BR>
<BR>
Researchers have largely ruled out toxins associated with red tide in nearby
waters and unseasonably cold water temperatures as possible causes of the
deaths.Other possibilities include a toxic amoeba, or a virus. It is possible
that no cause will be determined.<BR>
<BR>
Since 1992, manatee deaths have averaged 175 a year, and the leading cause
has been boat propellers. So far this year, 133 manatees have died in 2
1/2 months; 87 deaths were in southwest Florida, the Times reported. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>BROOKSVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--Gov. Lawton Chiles and the Cabinet
have approved the purchase of 1,624 acres of environmentally sensitive land
adjacent to the Withlacoochee State Forest for $3.8 million, the St. Petersburg
Times reported. <BR>
<BR>
The resource administrator for the forest, John Blanchard, told the Times
that the land, known as the P.K. Ranch, is considered a key addition to
the State Forest because it is next to two of the most-used state recreation
facilities in the county, the Withlacoochee State Trail and Silver Lakes
Recreation Area.<BR>
<BR>
The state may close on the sale in six to eight months, but has not made
any immediate plans for the land, which is mostly pasture. Blanchard said
a walking trail could be built on the land and that it may be reforested.</BLOCKQUOTE>

meeting on water legislation</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>PASCO COUNTY--(EnviroWorld)--With perhaps the most threatened
water supplies in the state, the Pasco County Commission met Monday with
its water attorney and water lobbyist to discuss which legislative bills
to support, the St. Petersburg Times reported. <BR>
<BR>
Pasco water lobbyist H. Clyde Hobby said his dream bill was the legislation
co-sponsored by Rep. Carl Littlefield, D-Dade City, that would give counties
the authority to veto new, large pumping permits. However, Hobby advised
that the bill had little chance in the legislature.<BR>
<BR>
Instead, Hobby suggested commissioners endorse the goals in a bill sponsored
by the chairman of the Water Policy Select Committee, Rep. John Rayson,
D-Pompano Beach. That bill would force the water management districts to
establish minimum flows for rivers and streams by March 1997, give the governor
the power to reject the WMD's budgets, and limit administrative appeals
to 120 days. <BR>
<BR>
Minimum flows are supposed to be used as an absolute level to restrict groundwater
pumping to ecologically safe amounts, though some environmentalists worry
that intent could be corrupted in the legislature. Hobby said that giving
the governor budget control would help ensure that the water management
districts comply with regulations. The advantage to Pasco of the120-day
appeals limit would be a savings of large legal fees caused by long government
appeals of issued permits. <BR>
<BR>
However, Hobby said another bill that is likely to receive serious consideration
in Tallahassee has been filed by Rep. Vernon Peeples, D-Punta Gorda. That
bill also establishes minimum-flow levels. But, it would also tie future
land-use planning by counties to the availability of water resources, a
proposal developers strongly oppose. The Peeples legislation would also
increase permits issued by the Southwest Florida Water Management District
to 20 years, a provision the Pasco commissioners do not support. <BR>
<BR>
The commission is expected to adopt a resolution at their regular meeting
today supporting many of the points in the Rayson legislation. <BR>
<BR>
Commissioners also said Pasco must negotiate with neighbors such as Pinellas
County to help relieve the water crisis, the Times reported. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CLEARWATER--(EnviroWorld)--Construction on a 2.1 mile segment
of a trail running from St. Petersburg to Tarpon Springs probably won't
be completed until year's end, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Clearwater officials had thought construction would start in May, but the
start date has been pushed back to July as a result of communication problems
with CSX, the railroad company that owns the tracks which the trail is to
follow.<BR>
<BR>
CSX has concerns about trail-users and trains being so close. The company
must issue a permit to the city before the work can begin.<STRONG> </STRONG>The
segment would be the last major unfinished piece of the trail, and has come

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)--A group working for the legislative
creation of a National Institute of the Environment has set up a web-site
of environmental information, and stated its support of a report issued
March 7 by the Presidents Council for Sustainable Development.<BR>

Two of the reports' conclusions which the group emphasized are scientific
research to improve &quot;economic efficiency, protect and restore natural
systems, and modify consumption patterns&quot; and improving the flow of
information to the public.<BR>
<BR>
Toward that end, the Committee for the National Institute of the Environment
has set up a web site at www.cnie.org/nle which contains more than 140 reports
on the environment from the Congressional Research Service.<BR>
<BR>
A proposal to create the NIE is before Congress in the Sound Science for
the Environment Act, H.R. 2827. The bill was introduced by Jim Saxton (R-NJ).<BR>

Newberry residents fear that emissions from the Florida Rock Industries
plant will endanger public health and the environment. State officials see
no threat to public health. <BR>

expansion</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CLEARWATER -- (EnviroWorld) -- A regional water supply board
approved a $15.5 million expansion of the wellfield system on Monday that
serves 1.2 million people in Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas counties,
the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
About $8 million of the funds will enable the West Coast Regional Water
Supply Authority to connect Morris Bridge wellfield in northern Hillsborough
to its system of seven interconnected wellfields.<BR>
<BR>
Morris Bridge will allow West Coast to reduce pumping at other stressed
wellfields. Regulators say over-pumping at those wellfields has drained
nearby lakes and wetlands, but water suppliers say five years of below-normal
rainfall is more to blame, according to the Tribune.</BLOCKQUOTE>

study finds</STRONG> </A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The California State Senate Office of Research will released
a report March 18th that concludes environmental regulations are not a major
cause of job loss, the New York Times reported. The report is based on research
performed by Stephen Meyer of the Project on Environmental Politics and
Policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<BR>
<BR>
In general, the research found that jobs are lost due to business related
factors such as leveraged buyouts, mergers, taxes and other forces, and
not the presence of strict environmental controls.<BR>
<BR>
The report says job losses in the wood products industry are mostly caused
by decreased product demand and increased productivity, as well as harvesting
techniques that don't guarantee future supplies.<BR>
<BR>
Lynn Scarlet, vice president of research at the Reason Foundation, told
the Times that the report's conclusions may be faulty--that the most productive
states may be able to afford strict environmental regulations as &quot;luxury&quot;
items.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)--The Department of the Interior's
budget will include $100 million for Everglades restoration each of the
next four years under a proposal by President Clinton, the St. Petersburg
Times reported. <BR>
<BR>
For 1997, the President has also requested an additional $55.8 million for
scientific research, park management and improving water delivery systems
for the Everglades. Overall, the requests amount to a $105.9 million increase
over this year's congressional Everglades funding.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the Department of Interior money would be used to buy farms north
of the Everglades.<BR>
<BR>
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said the proposal, which includes a one
cent per pound sugar tax, &quot;an equitable and environmentally sound solution&quot;
to repair the natural water flow of the Everglades ecosystem.<BR>
<BR>
Congressional negotiators working on omnibus farm legislation are trying
to reconcile House- and Senate-passed bills that include $210 million and
$200 million respectively for the purchase of environmentally sensitive
land in the Everglades. <BR>
<BR>
Audubon vice president Eric Draper called the proposal &quot;the best Everglades
budget ever&quot; in a written statement, the Times reported. </BLOCKQUOTE>

utility lobbyist, won't impact decision</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--The Public Service Commission decided
Tuesday they could fairly hear a case against Southern States Utilities
despite the revelation that a letter to the Commission from Lt. Gov. Buddy
MacKay had been written by an SSU lobbyist, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
A lawyer representing some of SSU's customers had asked that the $18.1-million
rate case be handled by a state administrative hearing officer. Mike Twomey,
representing SSU customers in Citrus County and elsewhere, had argued that
the letter had, at least, created an appearance of influence. Twomey emphasized
he was not accusing the PSC of actual bias in the case. <BR>
<BR>
While PSC members admitted regret over the incident, the PSC unanimously
declined the request for a hearing officer. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There has been a taint here and it's unfortunate,&quot; Commissioner
Joe Garcia said. Nonetheless, &quot;I think I can be unbiased and objective.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Brian Armstrong, SSU's corporate attorney told the Times the letters, written
to the commission chairwoman from MacKay and the state commerce secretary
before a PSC vote, had been &quot;mischaracterized&quot; and were not improper.
MacKay's letter was drafted by SSU lobbyist Jeff Sharkey. <BR>
<BR>
The lieutenant governor has expressed embarrassment over the incident and
says his staff didn't tell him the letter was written by Sharkey. <BR>
<BR>
SSU owns more than 150 water and sewer systems statewide, but only customers
in Citrus and Pasco would be affected by the rate request. That request
is scheduled for a final decision in August. </BLOCKQUOTE>

on power for big business</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--A large business incentives bill
nearing a House vote includes tax breaks on electricity that could cost
the state $24-million over the next two years, the St. Petersburg Times
reported.<BR>
<BR>
The bill's main purpose is to eliminate the state Department of Commerce,
but numerous other provisions provide a wide range of business incentives.
Among those handouts are an exemption from a 7 percent state sales tax and
a 1 percent local sales tax on electricity used in manufacturing products.
Phosphate mining and petroleum industries would be major beneficiaries of
that exemption. <BR>
<BR>
Local governments would also be allowed to exempt businesses from paying
taxes on electricity, water and gas. The tax cuts would be phased in over
four years.<BR>
<BR>
Other aspects of the bill would offer tax refunds to businesses that hire
more employees, resurrect a refund program for defense contractors that
was killed in 1994, and provide major funding for port-improvement statewide.<BR>
<BR>
Similar legislation is pending in the Senate and could reach the floor as
soon as Thursday. A final vote on the House bill also is expected Thursday,
the Times reported. <BR>
<BR>
Fundamental in both bills is the elimination of the state Department of
Commerce and the transfer of the department's functions to Enterprise Florida,
a public-private partnership. </BLOCKQUOTE>

</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--After accusals of being a hidden
enemy of Dick Batchelor, U.S. Sugar publicly denounced the state Environmental
Regulatory Commission Chairman in a March 13 press release. <BR>
<BR>
The statement concerns Batchelor's comment, reported in the St. Petersburg
Times, that the sugar industry could have been behind the rough treatment
he received in a Feb. 21 reappointment hearing before the Senate Natural
Resources Committee.<BR>
<BR>
According the U.S. Sugar Corporation Senior Vice President Robert H. Buker,
&quot;We have steadfastly avoided any involvement in the current hearings
regarding reappointment of Mr. Batchelor and other members of the commission.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We challenge Mr. Batchelor to name any person associated with our
business who has had any involvement in these hearings. Mr. Batchelor knows
full well that those charges are untrue. We can only speculate that he is
using them in a desperate attempt to deflect criticism he received from
members of the Florida Senate Natural Resources Committee.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Batchelor and other ERC members were subjected to harsh criticism from state
Senators during that hearing, however, the complaints came primarily from
unnamed sources. That prompted Batchelor to speculate that the sugar industry
could have been behind some of the complaints since the ERC would soon be
deciding on limits to phosphorous discharges by the industry. <BR>
<BR>
Batchelor's comments came on the heels of the resignation announcement of
Nancy Roen, another ERC member criticized by the Senate committee. The ERC
chairman has generated controversy during his tenure because of his outspokenness.
At times, he has publicly disagreed with Department of Environmental Protection
Secretary Virginia Wetherell. Batchelor has suggested his hidden opponents
would prefer a less-independent ERC.<BR>
<BR>
The statement by U.S. Sugar brings at least one of those opponents out from
hiding.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Mr. Batchelor's reckless and totally unfounded charges certainly bring
into question his ability to judge our industry fairly,&quot; Buker said.
&quot;That reflects on his leadership ability and after his fictitious charges
against us we are very worried that he is an individual who cannot make
unbiased decisions based on the facts.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Batchelor is still facing further hearings on his reappointment before the
Natural Resources Committee.</BLOCKQUOTE>

of pollution cleanup costs</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)--The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Tuesday
that a 20-year-old law allowing people to sue a polluter and recover cleanup
costs is not valid, the Associated Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
The court ruled unanimously in a California case that the federal Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 does not authorize such reimbursement.<BR>
<BR>
Thirteen states, including Florida, had urged the justices to interpret
the law more broadly to help those states that might have no legal recourse
against some polluters.<BR>
<BR>
Justice Sandra Day O'Conner wrote for the court that the 1976 law allows
private citizens to sue &quot;to minimize the present and future threat
to human health and the environment&quot; but &quot;is not directed at providing
compensation for past cleanup efforts.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Rep. Jim King (R-Jacksonville)
will help pass a bill in the Natural Resources Committee that would require
a safety education course for boaters born after Sept. 30, 1980, the Florida
Times-Union reported. But there's a catch.<BR>
<BR>
King said he would vote for the plan if singer Gloria Estefan, a proponent
of the plan, promised to sing him a song.<BR>
<BR>
King also cited statistics that show boating accidents are increasing as
an influence on his decision. Statistics released by the Florida Department
of Environmental Protection showed that Florida was first in the nation
in boating accidents and deaths. The report also showed that accidents are
increasing, with 134 more accidents in 1995 than in 1994.<BR>
<BR>
Committee Chairman Everett Kelly (D-Tavares) said Estefan would be written
a letter detailing King's proposal.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Jacksonville Port Authority
said that a recent poll indicates &quot;strong public support&quot; for
expansion of the JPA seaport terminals, the Florida Times-Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
Duval County voters were asked if they would support port expansion that
would create new jobs and new tax revenue, and 83 percent said they would.
That differs from a poll given last year that asked voters if they would
support a sales tax to fund the expansion. 54 percent said no to that question.<BR>
<BR>
Port officials credit a public relations campaign with increasing awareness
of the JPA's plan to expand its seaport. The poll indicated that 70 percent
of voters at least knew that the expansion was being considered.<BR>
<BR>
Since last July, the JPA has had 56 civic, church and social groups visit
the port for a slide presentation and tour. JPA staffers have been going
out into the communities and delivering speeches. Also, the JPA spent $170,000
on outside public relations consultants to improve its image.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Efforts to introduce six fox
squirrels into the San Felasco Hammock last year have failed, the Gainesville
Sun reported. <BR>
<BR>
John Wooding of the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission said that
none of the squirrels stayed long enough to make the state preserve home.
He said that the hammock lacks the fires necessary to make the area good
for the fox squirrels. The fox squirrels need periodic burning to control
the underbrush and keep the forest open.<BR>
<BR>
Preserve officials have not been doing burns because they attract the southern
pine beetle, a pest that has destroyed thousands of trees around Gainesville.

<BLOCKQUOTE>MIAMI -- (EnviroWorld) -- BioPlate, a new composting product,
has been developed to help accelerate composting processes and solve odor
problems in compost facilities. <BR>
<BR>
BioPlates are plates used to form an aeration floor, where biodegradable
materials are placed for composting. The product's maker says most organics
are reduced in nearly 30 days without the need for turning.<BR>
<BR>
BioPlates have been used in sewage sludge, as early as 1991. The compost/biofilter
facility at Griffith Park Zoo in California has also employed BioPlate.
In addition, the fresh water fish farm industry is currently installing
the product to accelerate the composting of fish wastes.<BR>

Florida</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- A group of legislators calling
themselves the &quot;Solar Caucus&quot; wants Florida to use solar energy
as a main attraction for more than just tourists, the St. Petersburg Times
reported. <BR>
<BR>
Hoping to increase business in Florida and promote a clean energy alternative,
lawmakers are looking to attract solar paneling manufacturers to develop
their products here and then ship them to developing countries.<BR>
<BR>
However, Mike Mahoney, a spokesman for Tampa Electric, told the Times that
the &quot;photovoltaic&quot; technology they're talking about - solar paneling
that converts sunlight directly into electricity - is not a realistic alternative
now. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;What you need is advancements in technology that would put solar power
on the same price and reliability scale as existing traditional sources
of power,&quot; he said. <BR>
<BR>
Solar supporters released a report Wednesday by the Tallahassee-based Project
for an Energy Efficient Florida, which promotes energy alternatives, said
solar industries would create jobs and pump up the state's export business,
two of the goals of the &quot;Solar Caucus.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We should be tapping this tremendous opportunity to get on the solar
international trade bandwagon,&quot; Marcia Elder, executive director of
the organization that released the report, told the Times. &quot;These technologies
are the best-kept secret of economic development that Florida has had in
a long time.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Lawmakers supporting solar power want to complement an overall economic
development package by providing tax breaks for solar power industries.
The House may give final approval to a major development bill today, while
the Senate will review similar legislation, according to the Times.<BR>

kilns face stricter EPA rules</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)--The Environmental Protection Agency
is proposing new regulations it says are the toughest standards ever for
controlling air pollutants like dioxin and lead that come from burning hazardous
waste in incinerators and cement kilns.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;About 53 million Americans who live in the same county as a hazardous
waste combustion facility will be protected by today's proposal,&quot; EPA
Secretary Carol Browner said. &quot;The threats to health from air pollutants
from these facilities can range from brain damage due to lead exposure to
possible cancer risk from dioxin. Children are often the most at risk.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Fighting to avoid being among those 53 million are Alachua County residents,
who oppose the construction of a Florida Rock Industries cement plant in
the western part of the county. Florida Rock officials have offered assurances
that the proposed plant would use state-of the-art pollution controls.<BR>
<BR>
The EPA proposal aims for a 98 percent reduction in dioxin and furan emissions
at these facilities, an 80 percent reduction in Mercury emissions and a
95 percent reduction in lead and cadmium emissions.<BR>
<BR>
The proposal would require continuous emissions monitors (CEMs) for particulate
matter and mercury. Right now, CEMs are required only for carbon monoxide,
total hydrocarbons and oxygen. CEMs allow regulatory agencies to check on
facility emissions on a continuing, minute-to-minute basis. Local communities
also have access to CEM data.<BR>
<BR>
The proposal also contains a &quot;comparable fuels exemption&quot; that
excludes from regulation hazardous wastes that have the same characteristics
as cleaner fossil fuels and that are burned instead of fossil fuel. <BR>
<BR>
Incinerators and cement kilns burn 80 percent of the hazardous waste combusted
each year in America, with cement kilns accounting for as much as 33 percent
of four million tons of hazardous waste burned each year at 162 incinerators
and 22 cement kilns nationwide. They are located in the majority of states
across the U.S.<BR>
<BR>
This action is the third part of a Clinton Administration plan to reduce
dioxin emissions. That strategy also included the first proposed controls
on medical waste incinerators and controls on municipal combusters, which
were finalized last November.<BR>
<BR>
EPA's proposal comes despite strong opposition from some special interests
in the form of two of the 17 &quot;riders&quot; attached to FY 1996 House
Appropriations bill for EPA, as well as in special provisions inserted in
various Senate regulatory reform proposals during the last Congressional
session.<BR>
<BR>
The Federal Register notice and a fact sheet on the proposed rule are available
in electronic format on the Internet. Copies of these documents can be obtained
through the RCRA Information Center, U.S. EPA, Office of Solid Waste (5303),
401 M St. S.W., Washington, D.C. 20460.<BR>

Inquiries should be directed to the RCRA Hotline at 1-800-424- 9346.<BR>

TCE, denies links to deaths</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>AUSTIN--(EnviroWorld)--Five patients have died since the oxygen
supply at an Austin VA hospital was contaminated with the chlorinated solvent
trichloroethylene, but VA officials say there is little evidence of a link
to the deaths, the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
Three patients died March 13, the day the contaminated oxygen was pumped
into the Olin E. Teague Veteran's Center. Two more of the 89 who were exposed
have since died, the latest on Tuesday. However, autopsy and toxicology
results have not been announced. A VA spokesman said all the patients were
quickly moved after hospital workers noticed a foul-smell.<BR>
<BR>
Trichloroethylene, or TCE, is a commonly used industrial degreaser. Officials
are unsure how the oxygen was contaminated, though oxygen tanks outside
the hospital were being changed when the incident happened.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>KEY WEST--(EnviroWorld)--The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration released a proposed 1997 budget on Tuesday of $2.1 billion.
Included in the budget is $232.5 million for science and technology, which
supports research on global climate change, air quality and ozone depletion.<BR>
<BR>
NOAA has asked for a $135 million increases over its 1996 budget for short-term
warning and forecast services, a $26 million increase for research analysis,
fishery analysis, and endangered species recovery programs, and a $15 million
increase for a variety of areas including coastal ocean science, and estuary
acquisitions.<BR>

for Everglades in farm bill</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)--The value of Florida's electoral
votes is apparent as the Clinton Administration and the Republican Congress
continue to throw money at the Everglades. The latest is a $300 million
carrot in the farm bill agreed to by Congressional negotiators Wednesday,
the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
If the bill is approved, $200-million will be available for Department of
the Interior land acquisitions in the Everglades, while the other $100-million
would come from the sale of surplus federal land.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This is a time in which the Everglades have been recognized as a natural
resource treasure and frankly, Florida has been recognized as a national
political resource,&quot; said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla. <BR>
<BR>
House speaker Newt Gingrich had signaled some reservations about the plan
last week, and had asked aides to look into other options for Everglades
land acquisition. That led to lobbying effort<BR>
by Graham, Florida GOP Sen. Connie Mack, West Palm Beach GOP Rep. Mark Foley
and Bob Dole. <BR>
<BR>
The $200-million earmarked to be used between July 31 of this year and Dec.
31, 1999. The additional $100-million - raised from the sale of surplus
lands - is contingent upon an equal match from the state. A Graham aide
cautioned that the funds from surplus land sale would likely be much slower
in materializing than the larger share, the Times reported. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Attempting to avoid injury
to endangered northern right whales, the Navy has decided to move their
NATO exercises off the Florida coast to waters off South Carolina, the Florida
Times-Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
Named the &quot;Unified Spirit 96,&quot; the seven-nation, mine-sweeping
exercise, which originates at Mayport Naval Station, begins tomorrow and
will run through April 3. Before moving the ships, the Navy would have been
operating outside the whale calving grounds off Florida, which extends from
five to 15 miles offshore in Brunswick, Ga., to St. Augustine. <BR>
<BR>
Recently, five right whales have been found dead, but the Navy and researchers
say there is no evidence that the Navy ships are to blame. The move of ships
was ordered simply out of an &quot;abundance of caution,&quot; Lt. Cmdr.
Jeff Styron, environmental counsel for the commander of Naval Base Jacksonville,
told the Times-Union.<BR>
<BR>
The New England Aquarium, which is trying to save the whales through its
Right Whale Research Project, said they appreciate the Navy's change of
plans. However, it is time for the whales to migrate back north passing
through South Carolina, so moving the ships may not make much of a difference,
according to the Times-Union.</BLOCKQUOTE>

the carcass of a young manatee near Shell Island in Crystal River on Thursday,

As of late Thursday, state officials did not think the animal was killed
by the mysterious disease that claimed the lives of 53 sea cows over a period
of two weeks, Benit Smith of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told the

This week, reports show that recent manatee counts indicate many of Crystal
River's winter herd has moved on, which is a good sign since it was unclear

give $300 million to Everglades</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- Under a compromise announced
in Congress on Thursday, federal efforts to restore the Everglades would
receive $300 million. However, the president's proposal to tax sugar growers
to raise additional funds is dead, according to the Tampa Tribune.<BR>
<BR>
The Senate and House negotiators agreed on a compromise Wednesday night
that offers $200 million for Department of Interior land acquisitions in
the Everglades, while another $100 million would come from the sale of surplus
federal land in Florida.<BR>
<BR>
However, after praising the compromise, Dole criticized Clinton's proposal
to tack on a penny-per-pound tax on sugar grown in Florida, which would
raise an additional $35 million a year for Everglades restoration. But Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt maintained the Clinton administration will continue
fighting for the tax.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We believe the sugar industry should pay its fair share,&quot; Babbitt
said.<BR>
<BR>
Even if Congress kills the 1-cent-per-pound tax, it won't completely disappear
from Florida. The state Legislature is considering a similar proposal which
may show up in November on a referendum, the Times reported.</BLOCKQUOTE>

case a 'tragic flaw'</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA --(EnviroWorld)-- Hillsborough county commissioners criticized
Pinellas courts for the court-ordered toxic waste search of James &quot;Bobby&quot;
Martin's landfill which found only a 5-gallon bucket of chemical sealant,
the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
The case, which has been on-going for 14 years, has been the source of strife
between Pinellas and Hillsborough counties since the beginning. The Martin
Landfill, located in northwest Hillsborough County, is accused of poisoning
a Pinellas wellfield.<BR>
<BR>
This week, Circuit Court Judge Fred L. Bryson heard lawyers battle over
whether KBH Construction Co. of Largo lost money while excavating the landfill
trying to find the toxic waste. The excavation took three and a half years,
and was supposed to take 20 days. Bryson said that KBH could sell Martin's
dirt to recoup its losses. KBH sold $1.47 million in dirt, but claims it
lost more than $700,000 on the project.<BR>
<BR>
Martin's attorneys say KBH is inflating its costs so that it can keep selling
the dirt. The judge is expected to rule next week. In June, a battle over
who is responsible to restore the steep-sided pit on Martin's property goes
to court.<BR>
<BR>
Hillsborough Commissioner Phyllis Busansky has publicly sided with Martin
and says he should take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary.
&quot;You have a system gone awry,&quot; she said.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>MIAMI --(EnviroWorld)-- Jose Diaz pleaded guilty to a Clean

refrigerant had actually remained in the U.S. for sale to auto repair shops

<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO --(EnviroWorld)-- Three of the nation's largest suppliers
of carbon dioxide gas were acquitted of antitrust charges by a federal court
jury Thursday, the Associated Press reported. <BR>
<BR>
Seven food processing companies filed the suit, alleging that the suppliers
engaged in a 25-year-long price fixing conspiracy by rigging bids and dividing
up customers.<BR>
<BR>
The companies being sued were Liquid Carbonic Industries Corp. of Chicago;
Liquid Air Corp. of Walnut Creek, Calif.; and BOC Group Inc. of Murray Hills,
N.J.<BR>
<BR>
Those three companies, along with a fourth supplier, reached out-of-court
settlements in February for $55 million in a class action case brought by
the state of Florida and hundreds of other food processors and beverage
companies.<BR>
<BR>
The civil court jury decided after a two-week trial that none of the seven
plaintiffs had proved any of the charges brought under the Sherman Anti-Trust
Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ILWACO, Wash.--(EnviroWorld)--Two highways repaired with rubber
from used tires are smoking and oozing a toxic, oily goo that is threatening
nearby marshes on the Columbia River, the Associated Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
On a 150-foot stretch of State Route 100, the first sign of trouble came
in December when asphalt pavement laid over the fill began to crack, split
and give off wisps of noxious smoke, with temperatures up to 160 degrees.<BR>
<BR>
Some of the buried rubber had started burning, with the heat generated in
a way similar to a compost pile. The heated rubber is releasing a goo that
oozes to the surface and flows onto the mud flats below the highway, which
runs near marshes of the Columbia River. The makeup of the goo is uncertain,
but it smells like creosote and burnt plastic. The underground combustion
is also releasing benzene and other toxic chemicals, according to Coast
Guard Lt. Rob Myles.<BR>
<BR>
Another road repaired with used tires in southeastern Washington has been
emitting smoke--and even flames-- since January.<BR>
<BR>
Both roads have been closed and the removal of the tires may begin next
week. The estimated cost is more than $1 million.</BLOCKQUOTE>

waste tracking program</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO--(EnviroWorld)--A state program that funds local committees
to register hazardous materials faces a drastic cut in a bill proposed by
the Senate Natural Resources Committee, the Orlando Sentinel reported. The
bill, SB 130, would cut funding for the program from $1.8 million to $300,000.
<BR>
<BR>
Critics of the legislation, including emergency management and industry
officials, say the program is a bargain and protects citizens and emergency
workers from hazardous waste threats.<BR>
<BR>
The state program creates Emergency Planning Committees for Hazardous Materials.
Businesses and government agencies which possess dangerous materials must
register those hazards with the committee and pay a fee. The system provides
emergency workers with valuable information when they respond to a crisis,
and demands that businesses have disaster-response plans.<BR>
<BR>
State Sen. Locke Burt, R-Ormond Beach, told the Sentinel the bill was intended
to meet the Senate's goal of a 25 percent cut in state government. He added
that a group of Volusia emergency officials &quot;made a case that this
was a stupid place to cut.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The Sentinel reported that the chemical industry also supports keeping the
program and is supporting a House bill (HB 1271) that leaves it intact.<BR>
<BR>
The program was started in 1988 when the federal government required states
to collect information on hazardous materials, but did not provide funding,
leaving the state legislature to design a program. Florida has 13,000 registered
chemical storage sites.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)--The vast sea of information on the
Environmental Protection Agency's world-wide-web site now includes a specific
Superfund site, and a microbiology site which replaces a gopher site. <BR>
<BR>
The Superfund page is located at http://www.epa.gov/superfnd/ This website
provides a brief overview of the objective of the Superfund program and
a listing of both current and previous Superfund sites. The data for these
site lists have been culled from the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Information System (CERCLIS) and the Records
of Decision System (RODS).<BR>
<BR>
In addition, standardized reports generated from the CERCLIS database are
also available for downloading from the webpage; all reports are compressed
ASCII files and require a CERCLIS Report Browser (a DOS-based browsing tool)
which is also available for downloading from the site. Links to other EPA
information resources relevant to the Superfund program include a review
of the Superfund Reauthorization process, the Brownfields homepage, hotlines,
and webpages for EPA offices that have a role in Superfund program activities.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Microbiology site is at http://www.epa.gov/nerlcwww/. The website was
developed using data maintained on the microbiology gopher, which was operational
from January 1994 through November 1995. It offers the full-text of several
extensive publications, including all 12 chapters of the USEPA Manual of
Methods for Virology. In addition, a year-by-year listing (1990- 1994) of
publications provides full bibliographic information for documents resulting
from EPA-sponsored research in microbiology. Also provided are a video clip
showing the steps involved in detecting viruses in cell culture, and a &quot;gallery&quot;
of microorganism images that offers a graphic look at adenovirus, parvovirus,
astrovirus, calicivirus (non-SRSV), Norwalk virus/SRSV, poliovirus, rotavirus,
and giardia. Links to the EPA offices responsible for the website--the Human
Exposure Research Division of the National Exposure Research Laboratory,
and the Office of Research and Development--are also available. </BLOCKQUOTE>

attack</STRONG> </A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WEST PALM BEACH--(EnviroWorld)--EPA Administrator Carol Browner
turned aside protests from Sugar interests Friday and said the Clinton Administration
was committed to spending billions and moving fast in an effort to save
the Everglades.<BR>
<BR>
On Friday Browner addressed Florida's Governor's Commission for a Sustainable
South Florida and detailed the Clinton Administration's proposal for funding
the Everglades Restoration Program. She outlined President Clinton's 1997
balanced budget submission that includes $230 million for Everglades restoration,
and spends $1.5 billion over the next seven years. <BR>
<BR>
Browner acknowledged that attention to this problem from the federal government
was long overdue. She emphasized the importance of taking action immediately
and of securing a reliable source of funding at the federal level. <BR>
<BR>
The first year's funding would be $100 million for land acquisition and
$130 million for ecosystem restoration. The Administration is supporting
the purchase of 100,000 acres for Everglades restoration. That does not
include acquisition of the stormwater treatment areas, part of the state's
ten-year effort to improve the water quality. <BR>
<BR>
Browner added that the Administration also supports the 1-cent per pound
sugar tax for Florida's sugar industry. Browner also clarified that the
Administration's proposal for federal funding was in addition to the $200-300
million in Congress' Farm Bill, which is currently working its way through
both houses. <BR>
<BR>
Browner said the proposal would leave the details of the restoration program
to the Commission for a Sustainable South Florida, to the Army Corps of
Engineers in its restudy of the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control
Project, and to the affected citizens of south Florida. <BR>
<BR>
But US Sugar representatives were critical of the proposal, saying it put
&quot;the cart before the horse.&quot; Browner countered that the time for
action to save the Everglades is now. <BR>
<BR>
In response to the sugar industry's statement that it was being unfairly
treated, Browner added that the federal government's share in the cleanup
was more than three times the estimated $35 million per year that the sugar
tax would generate.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>MELBOURNE --(EnviroWorld)-- A vial containing the toxin that
causes botulism, a type of acute food poisoning, was stolen from Florida
Tech laboratory on Thursday night or Friday morning, the Associated Press
reported.<BR>
<BR>
The vial of white powdery toxin was taken along with $2,500 worth of checks
from four biology offices.<BR>
<BR>
If swallowed, inhaled or otherwise introduced into the body, the toxin could
be poisonous. But the stolen vial represents a small threat to the public
because the toxin breaks down if heated or immersed in water. That seriously
reduces any risk of it causing widespread danger, said Miguel Mateos-Mora,
an infectious disease specialist in Melbourne.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE --(EnviroWorld)-- The Gainesville Sun urged the
Florida House Natural Resources Committee to kill the environmental self-audit
bill that it is scheduled to begin considering this week. <BR>
<BR>
While the state should find ways to offer incentives for private businesses
to be responsible for their own actions when it comes to environmental enforcement,
the Sun editorial said, the self-audit bill goes too far.<BR>
<BR>
The Florida Local Environmental Resources Agencies said, &quot;Polluters
could use self-audit as a shield from liability and the public's right to
know about contamination that directly affects their health well-being and
property values.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A recent movement around the country toward environmental self-auditing
has the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency warning that states adopting
the bills will become &quot;pollution havens&quot; for business. </BLOCKQUOTE>

compromise</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE --(EnviroWorld)-- Jacksonville City Council members
proposed a compromise on the water and sewage rates that are set to be increased
in April, The Florida Times-Union reported. Instead of the full 17 percent
water rate increase and the nearly 6 percent sewage rate increase, the council
committee recommended those increases be cut in half. <BR>
<BR>
The rates will create a surplus in city coffers, and new money will be used
to improve the city's aging sewer lines. After six months, if the money
is being spent efficiently in the eyes of city officials, the full increase
will take effect.<BR>
<BR>
The compromise is the result of a several-month long debate about the rate
increases. Council President Dick Kravitz first proposed the 1996 rate increase
be spread out over three years, then later suggested that one-third of the
increase be applied in 1996, and two-thirds next year. The new 50-50 compromise
will voted on by the full council on Tuesday.<BR>
<BR>
The rate increase would cause the average water bill to increase about $1.01
a month. </BLOCKQUOTE>

still dying from mystery illness; 14 more carcasses found </A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>SANIBEL ISLAND--(EnviroWorld)--Officials spoke too soon in declaring
an end to the epidemic of manatee deaths in southwest Florida. The Florida
Marine Research Institute has found 14 more dead animals in the area during
the past few days, bringing March's death toll to 76, the St. Petersburg
Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Necropsies are incomplete on the recently found manatees, so it is not certain
that the same illness is responsible for their deaths. Though no specific
cause has been determined in the original deaths, the creatures had extensive
lung damage and biologists believe a pneumonia-causing bacteria or virus
may be to blame.<BR>
<BR>
Workers had found 53 carcasses in a two-week period earlier this month,
all in the rivers and bays of southwest Florida. Officials declared the
epidemic over, but the fact that some of the animals found this weekend
had not decomposed lead them to recant.<BR>
<BR>
At the last count, the size of the endangered manatee population was about
2,600.<BR>

in St. Pete</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG--(EnviroWorld)--A Canadian developer wants to
build an 100 unit condominium on Boca Ciega Bay in south St. Petersburg
that relies entirely on the sun for electricity, the St. Petersburg Times
reported. <BR>
<BR>
According to the developer, Tony O'Donohue of Ciega Development Co., photovoltaic
cells on the roof of the building would even provide surplus electricity
that could be sold to Florida Power and Light. O'Donohue has hinted that
without some FP&amp;L financial help, the project might not go solar. Other
environmental considerations are also in the plans, such as the use of water-saving
construction methods.<BR>
<BR>
O'Donohue attained some notoriety in Toronto for various environmental projects
he was involved in, and was a member of the city council for 26 years, the
Times reported. <BR>
<BR>
Last week, the St. Petersburg City Council agreed to rezone the land for
the condo. Depending on other regulatory approvals, O'Donohue said construction
could begin by fall and the condo could be open in late 1997. </BLOCKQUOTE>

no data on dried-up wells</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>SHADY HILLS--(EnviroWorld)--Apparently the $25,000 that Southwest
Florida Water Management District spent to determine the impact of a wellfield
on nearby private wells was money sent down a dry hole. The St. Petersburg
Times reported that a survey of private well-owners living within eight
miles of the Cross Bar Ranch Well Field was useless. The survey was commissioned
by Swiftmud after many of those well-owners complained that overpumping
at the well field had lowered the area's water table and dried up their
water source.<BR>
<BR>
Officials had hoped that the survey would allow them to determine a new
&quot;cone of influence&quot;--the depression in the level of underground
water caused by heavy pumping of water--around Cross Bar. West Coast Regional
Water Supply Authority, which pumps the water there, had offered to replace
anyone's private well within that cone.<BR>
<BR>
But Stephen Bock of Bock Environmental Services said the survey did not
get enough responses to be conclusive. Swiftmud paid Bock $25,000 to conduct
the study in 1994. <BR>
<BR>
Bock told the Times that he had begun conducting the survey with on-site
visits, then changed to telephone interviews, and finally mailed questionaires
after the first two methods proved too labor intensive. <BR>
<BR>
Several factors could have caused the poor response. Some homeowners said
the intent of the survey was unclear, and they had mistaken it for a sales
pitch. Higher rainfall has also raised the water table in some areas, so
there have been fewer complaints about dry wells. Finally, some homeowners
replaced their wells at their own expense, unwilling to wait years to have
their complaints answered.<BR>
<BR>
The result is that no new cone of influence was established, and homeowners
with dry wells just a few feet outside the current cone must pay for new
wells themselves.<BR>
<BR>
West Coast Regional Water Supply currently has a permit to withdraw 45-million
gallons a day from the wellfield. That permit is up for renewal, but if
Swiftmud reduces the pumping limit, which would shrink the cone of influence,
it could face a lawsuit from West Coast. </BLOCKQUOTE>

blanket all new industry construction </STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)--The Environmental Protection Agency
announced a draft final regulation today that affects any potential new
sources of major pollution.<BR>
<BR>
To be a major source of pollution, an industry has to emit more than 10
tons per year of a single listed pollutant, or 25 tons of combined pollutants.
There are 189 pollutants on the list. Essentially the new regulation requires
that any industry which has not already been categorized by the EPA must
protect the public from toxic air pollutants.<BR>
<BR>
The EPA expects to finish establishing emission standards for all industrial
categories by the year 2000. Currently 47 categories, including the chemical
industry, have specific standards.<BR>
<BR>
The regulation is accessible through EPA's electronic bulletin board system,
the Technology Transfer Network (TTN) at 919-541-5742 (backup number for
access problems is 919-541-5384) and under &quot;Recently Signed Rules&quot;
on the TTN's Clean Air Act Amendments bulletin board. For further technical
information on the action, contact Kathy Kaufman at 919-541-0102 or Gerri
Pomerantz at 919-541-2317.</BLOCKQUOTE>

could improve wetlands restoration</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--The House Natural Resources Committee
will consider a bill today that would regulate mitigation banking--an idea
that allows large areas of wetlands to be restored, at a profit, by private
businesses--the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
A mitigation bank works like this: a company buys a large tract of wetlands
that needs restoration, and the land is assigned a certain value in wetlands
credits. Then when any developer builds a project that destroys wetlands
somewhere else, that developer can buy an appropriate number of credits
from the mitigation bank to satisfy his obligation.<BR>
<BR>
The idea is designed to preserve larger, more ecologically protective, wetlands,
and could end the small-scale wetlands restorations that have shown little
benefit to the environment.<BR>
<BR>
The House bill, and a similar bill in the Senate, would require companies
that want to set up mitigation banks to be well-financed and to put up bonds
to provide for long term maintenance of the wetland if the company fails.<BR>
<BR>
Five companies in Florida currently have permits to sell mitigation bank
credits, at prices ranging from $25,000 to $45,000 per credit.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO--(EnviroWorld)--The owner of a large tract of sensitive
land in southwest Florida has offered to swap it for the 2,000 acres that
make up the closing Naval Base in Orlando, the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
The city has been working on a plan to redevelop the area, but some officials
said allowing the private landholder to swap and redevelop the base would
save the city that cost. The Southwest Florida property is owned by the
Collier family as the Barron Collier Co. It is a 115,000 acre tract northeast
of the Big Cypress preserve. Federal officials said that the city had first
say in what happens to the land. Representatives of the Collier's have agreed
to redevelop the base according to city plans.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Environmentalists seeking a
penny-per-pound sugar tax for Everglades cleanup said Monday they're turning
to voters for approval with enough time to make the November ballot, the
Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are facing a crisis and time is running out, Mary Barley, chair
of the Save Our Everglades Committee, told the Tribune. &quot;That's why
we're going to the people.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
President Clinton, Congress and state lawmakers all have proposals for saving
the Everglades. A penny tax per every pound of raw sugar produced in the
Everglades is one proposal that could raise nearly $100 million for cleanup
funds. However, to make the fall ballot, the issue must have 500,000 signatures
by early August.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>MELBOURNE -- (EnviroWorld) -- A stolen vial of toxin that causes
botulism was back in custody Monday at Florida Tech after a security staff
member found it in a library book return box, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
An anonymous caller tipped off the private university to the location for
the vial, according to a school spokesperson. The white powdery toxin was
stolen last week, along with $2,500 worth of checks from four biology offices.
Botulism toxin attacks the nervous system. In addition, if the respiratory

lists</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- CFC gas has been seeping into
the United States, despite its illegal status, making it the No. 2 problem
for U.S. Customs Service officials, behind drugs, the Associated Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
The air conditioning gas commonly called Freon, is often smuggled into the
United States from India, where it is still in legal production. Experts
say one-third or more of the Freon in U.S. commerce has been smuggled to
distributors, auto chains or others, allowing them to make a fat profit
while even while underselling the standard &quot;legal&quot; price. <BR>
<BR>
The U.S. government, has lost possibly hundreds of millions in tax revenues
because of coolant smuggling. And big business has an investment of billions
riding on weaning the world from CFCs and getting it hooked on new chemicals.
In addition, CFC has at times pulled down the taxed product's price and
at others driven it from the market. <BR>
<BR>
The CIA has begun playing a key role in tracing the smugglers. In Florida,
one scheme was broken up involving $52 million worth of CFC-12. In addition,
EnviroWorld reported the recent bust of Jose Dial for illegal Freon smuggling.
Now he faces up to 15 years in jail and a $74 million fine.<BR>
<BR>
The continued use of CFC could be enlarging the hole in the Earth's ozone
shield.<BR>
<BR>
Environmentalists say the earth's ozone layer won't recover its previous
density until the mid-21st century at least, and the smuggling threatens
to set back that goal. They are hoping for a global ban on all CFC production
and trade.</BLOCKQUOTE>

plan tonight</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Rumors are flying about the
possibility of revived plan to develop more than 200 homes in northeast
Alachua County to be presented at tonight's zoning meeting, the Gainesville
Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
Last month the plan was rejected by county commissioners. The revised ordinance,
however, now puts into writing most of the concerns raised by residents,
staff and commissioners in recent months about the development. Concerns
included the availability of government services and protected open space
in an effort to retain the area's rural character. <BR>
<BR>
Commissioners fear that if these issues aren't taken into account, urban
sprawl will take place, creating a service-demand that imposes unfair costs
on all taxpayers, the Sun reported. Some residents also are concerned the
revised ordinance may promote development in other rural areas. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;This is a cookbook on how to turn rural farmland into development,&quot;
former City Commissioner Mark Goldstein told the Sun. &quot;It literally
provides the means to create septic-tank suburbs all throughout the rural
area.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Wendy Kinser, the county's chief of development services, told the Sun she
doubted this revised language would encourage more rural development and
said it may even dissuade some developers from applying because of the criteria
for existing services.<BR>
<BR>
The meeting will begin at 6 p.m. at the county administration building downtown.</BLOCKQUOTE>

campus, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
The county is now challenging UF's master plan on hazardous materials management
and compliance with the law. Gainesville has also challenged UF on many
issues involving the master plan, but the city appears to be heading toward
settling its differences with UF.<BR>
<BR>
Chris Bird, the county's environmental protection director, told the Sun
he is not pleased with the &quot;double standard&quot; UF has been given
in dealing with hazardous materials compliance. Compliance with the law
is important because hazardous materials from UF would go &quot;into the
same aquifer system most of the community depends on our our drinking water,&quot;
Bird said.<BR>
<BR>
UF officials say they are exempted from local environmental ordinances under
a 1993 law requiring universities to establish such plans. But that law
says state and regional environmental laws &quot;remain applicable,&quot;
according to the Sun.<BR>
<BR>
UF attorney Rob Pritchard told the Sun that county officials have agreed
that UF's hazardous-materials safeguards meet local environmental protection
needs. Bird, however, is concerned that the county does not question the
quality of UF's program and that UF's safeguards could change in the future
if they aren't subject to local law.<BR>
<BR>
UF officials say they have agreed to meet regularly with county officials
and to send them documents to keep them abreast of hazardous-materials issues,
the Sun reported.</BLOCKQUOTE>

self-audit bill gets caught in legislative cogs</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--The environmental self-audit bill
almost died in a House subcommittee Wednesday, but the bill's supporters
have it on life-support for another week.<BR>
<BR>
The bill would allow businesses who discover and clean up their own pollution
to keep records of such incidents private. The bill was being taken up in
a House subcommittee meeting, but when the meeting ran late an opponent
of the bill asked that the meeting be adjourned. No one asked for an extension,
so the meeting ended without any final action being taken.<BR>
<BR>
Complaints from the bill's supporters succeeded in getting an agreement
that another subcommittee meeting be held next week, but it's chances of
approval in its original form seem remote.<BR>
<BR>
The subcommittee had approved an amendment to the bill that stripped out
much of the privacy allowances by a 7-5 vote.<BR>
<BR>
In its original form, the bill would allow companies that found pollution
problems and turned themselves in would be granted some immunity from fines
and prosecution. Their environmental self-audit reports could also be kept
confidential. Supporters say that would encourage businesses to be honest
about contamination and clean up messes quickly, but critics said it opens
the door for inadequate cleanups and corruption. <BR>
<BR>
Rep. Kelley Smith, who sponsored the bill, told the Tampa Tribune he was
discouraged by the way the meeting had been handled. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I know there are a lot of people that disagree with the premises of
this bill. But unless we have a fair hearing on the bill, I'll never have
an opportunity to address those concerns.&quot;<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>BARTOW--(EnviroWorld)--Cargill Fertilizer's Riverview and Bartow
plants were cited for 23 serious safety and health violations, the St. Petersburg
Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Federal inspectors from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
spent five months investigating the Riverview plant after receiving complaints
about unsafe conditions. Fines for the violations could run $48,075.<BR>
<BR>
Cargill officials said they would act immediately on most of the problems,
however three violations are being disputed. David Norris, assistant area
director for OSHA, told the Times that Cargill had been cooperative during
the investigation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG--(EnviroWorld)--Heavy rainfall inputs are running
a tight race with water-use outputs in the Southwest Florida Water Management
District, the St. Petersburg Times reported. Swiftmud researchers said this
year's wet winter and last year's wet summer have left the area's water
supplies in good shape, but water consumption has also risen and may cause
the area's water supplier to exceed pumping limits.<BR>
<BR>
The seven wellfields in Pinellas, Hillsborough, and Pasco counties that
are used by the West Coast Regional Water Supply Authority cannot be pumped
for more than 116 million gallons per day, on average, or the Authority
will be fined. <BR>
<BR>
The average is slightly higher than that so far, with only two months left
in the Swiftmud's water calendar. And those two months are usually dry,
which worries water officials.<BR>
<BR>
Gary Florence, data resource director at Swiftmud, told the Times that lakes
within the wellfields' cone of influence &quot;are still showing the impacts
of the drought and pumping.&quot; </BLOCKQUOTE>

River pumping</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>BROOKSVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--The Southwest Florida Water Management
District approved a 20-year permit that will increase pumping from the Peace
River as much as 24.1 million gallons a day, the Tampa Tribune reported.
<BR>
<BR>
The Peace River/Manasota Regional Water Supply Authority, which serves Charlotte,
Sarasota, DeSoto and Manatee counties, currently pumps 8.6 million gallons
a day from the river. Charlotte county had objected to the permit over concerns
that the withdrawal would make Charlotte Harbor saltier, altering the area's
ecology.<BR>
<BR>
Charlotte County, along with environmental groups, had requested that a
state hearing officer reject the plan last fall. That action resulted in
a suit from the water authority. In coming to an agreement to allow the
pumping, Charlotte said Swiftmud must establish a minimum flow for the river
and that the counties be allowed to appoint members to a scientific panel
that will periodically review the permit.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--The Florida House last week passed
a bill introduced by a group of Florida lawmakers, called the Solar Caucus,
that would entice solar panel manufacturers to the state to build and sell
products and to ship products to developing countries. <BR>

State Representative Alzo Reddic (D) said the state needs to get on the

over EPA's self-audit policy </STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON,D.C.--(EnviroWorld)--Sylvia Lowrance, EPA Deputy
Assistant Administrator for the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance
(OECA), announced March 25th that public interest groups are threatening
to sue EPA because of state privilege-and-immunity laws for environmental
audits. <BR>
<BR>
These laws treat the results of corporate audits of environmental compliance
as privileged information protected from disclosure to enforcement officials
and members of the public. <BR>
<BR>
States that have adopted such laws include Colorado, Idaho, Texas, Virginia,
Michigan, New Hampshire, and South Dakota. Such suits, Lowrance said, would
be aimed at stopping EPA from delegating authority to states for implementing
statutes such as the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act.<BR>
<BR>
Florida is considering a self-audit law this legislative session, although
it appears to have stalled in the state House [see related story today].</BLOCKQUOTE>

turf</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)-- The embattled chairman of Florida's
top enviro rulemaking body may get to fight for state Senate confirmation
from higher ground, according to a key Senate committee chairman.<BR>
<BR>
Dick Batchelor, whose appointment as Chairman of the Environmental Regulation
Commission was imperiled by a hostile Senate Natural Resources Committee
hearing last month, may have his next hearing before the Senate Executive
Business, Ethics, and Elections committee, says Senate Natural Resources
Committee Chairman Sen. Rick Dantzler.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are simply running out of time,&quot; says Dantzler. &quot;Dick
[Batchelor's] hearing may take a full meeting at least,&quot; Dantzler theorized.
Therefore, Dantzler said he would poll his committee's members in an effort
to pass the confirmation proceeding on with a &quot;no recommendation&quot;
to another committee.<BR>
<BR>
Batchelor said he felt comfortable with either committee holding his confirmation
hearing.<BR>
<BR>
Both Dantzler and Batchelor said they felt chances for approval were better
than during the raucous February hearing. Batchelor has been meeting with
Senators, Lt. Governor Buddy MacKay, and Governor Chiles chief of staff
Linda Shelly in order to build support.<BR>
<BR>
Dantzler said Batchelor's chances &quot;are much better than six weeks ago.
Dick has secured a number of impressive recommendations from some very respected
people&quot; since that meeting.<BR>
<BR>
The February hearing was marked by personal attacks against Batchelor launched
by conservative Senators and Associated Industries lobbyist Jodi Chase who
repeated the indictments of unnamed accusers. Batchelor reacted angrily
against the &quot;phantoms&quot; attacking him and called the allegations
&quot;laughable.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A date for the next hearing has not been announced.</BLOCKQUOTE>

hope to afflicted neighbors</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>JUPITER--(EnviroWorld)--Owners of property next to polluted
areas can recover damages, a state appellate court has found.<BR>
<BR>
In what may be a precedent-setting decision, a state appellate court upheld
a lower court's decision that an adjoining property owner was entitled to
damages and an award of $405,000 in attorney's fees from the owners of a
gas station facility which was in the last stage of a petroleum cleanup.
<BR>
<BR>
The case may offer hope that property owners neighboring contaminated sites
may have legal and financial recourse against polluters. As such, this case
and its subsequent settlement have fired a warning shot across the bows
of petroleum storage facilities statewide.<BR>
<BR>
The voluntary cleanup had been conducted for years under the supervision
of state and county environmental agencies.<BR>
<BR>
The plaintiffs' complaint contained a negligence count in which they demanded
an award for economic damages due to the contamination, which had migrated
under their property. <BR>
<BR>
Following a non-jury trial, the court held that defendants had negligently
allowed gasoline to leak from their storage facility and, as a result, plaintiffs'
property had been contaminated by their petroleum.<BR>
<BR>
The appellate decision was filed in February. A settlement for an undisclosed
amount was agreed to last week.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--Amid concerns that it may have
contributed to the deaths of some Right Whales, the U.S. Navy has agreed
to move a minesweeping exercise that was being held off the coast of Florida,
the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
Five whales have died off the coast of North Florida and South Georgia during
the Right Whales winter calving season. The whale is considered the most
endangered large whale, with an estimated population of about 300. <BR>
<BR>
No definite links have been established between the Navy and the dead whales,
but scientists say at least two of the dead creatures had injuries that
could be consistent with the effects of explosions.<BR>

riders in budget proposal</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE --(EnviroWorld)-- The Gainesville Sun's editorial
today spoke out against riders attached to the budget proposal that could
harm the environment.<BR>
<BR>
The riders attached to the budget proposal hide environmental measures in
the larger issue of the budget, which results in the riders receiving less
attention than they should, the editorial said. The Sun was concerned with
five riders: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>1) A moratorium on the ability of federal wildlife officials
to add more species to the list of endangered species. <BR>
<BR>
2) A restriction that would prohibit the EPA from disapproving any wetlands
development permits issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. <BR>
<BR>
3) The expansion of an existing law on salvaging dead and dying trees in
national forests in a way that would allow for large areas of healthy trees
to be harvested.<BR>
<BR>
4) The expansion of logging in the Tongass National Forest in Alaska. <BR>
<BR>
5) A limit on National Park Service's expenditures on the new Mojave National
Preserve in California.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
The Sun said that President Clinton should veto any budget bill that contains
the environmental riders, as he has promised to do.While solving the budget
problem is important, it should not be used as &quot;cover to dismantle
America's environmental laws.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>BROOKSVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Water managers have put off
a decision on whether to ask independent scientific experts to review the
region's water disputes. The Southwest Florida Water Management District's
governing board has agreed its staff needs 30 more days to spell out the
review's parameters, the Tampa Tribune reported. <BR>
<BR>
The district is currently negotiating with Pinellas County and the West
Coast Regional Water Supply Authority regarding which questions about the
environmental effects of area wellfields should be addressed in the review.
<BR>
<BR>
The conflict began when the district placed restrictions on four wellfields
that would cut back pumping over the next 10 years. The district's scientists
believe that pumping at regional wellfields is responsible for drying up
lakes and wetlands near wellfields in Pasco and northwest Hillsborough counties.
However, West Coast officials claim a five-year drought, which ended in
1994, is the cause. <BR>
<BR>
If all parties agree to the scientific review, the hearing would be put
on hold until the review is complete, according to the Tribune.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The state Senate unanimously
passed a bill Wednesday that restores environmental protection for mangroves,
after passing a flawed law last year that let coastal landowners trim mangroves
on their property, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
The bill, sponsored by Republican Sen. Jack Latvala, imposes a 6-foot trimming
limit on professional tree trimmers and requires trimming of larger mangroves
be done in stages to prevent killing the trees. Last year's law did not
impose the 6-foot limit on tree trimming, and resulted in widespread overcutting.
Mangroves are considered essential to erosion prevention and as a fish nursery.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- After becoming more aware of
the problems west central Florida is having with its water resources, Lt.
Gov. Buddy Mackay warned a House panel not to pass a bill that weakens current
water resource restrictions, the Tampa Tribune and St. Petersburg Times
has reported. <BR>
<BR>
The House Select Committee on Water Policy met Wednesday and approved a
water bill that some environmentalists say might do what MacKay warned against.
<BR>
<BR>
Portions of the bill set minimum water levels to protect lakes, streams
and springs from being pumped dry, but a section was also approved calling
for water managers to consider both the environment and the needs of water
users when establishing pumping limits, the Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Some believe restrictions on pumping should protect area lakes and wetlands
first. While others are concerned the people who need water, will be forced
to pay too much for it.<BR>
<BR>
In 1995 the House and Senate each created special water committees to address
the water issue, but with so many interests, it has taken a year to craft
a bill. The bill would reinforce parts of current laws, while weakening
others. Cities and counties would have to plan growth with special attention
to water needs, yet at the same time, users might gain easier access to
more water, according to the Tribune.<BR>
<BR>
MacKay said he was generally pleased with provisions in the bill that give
the governor more control over management districts. But he would rather
the House do nothing if business interests get too much weight. &quot;If
the choice is between something that weakens the existing law and leaves
the law,&quot; MacKay told the Times, &quot;we'll enforce the current law.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CLEARWATER -- (EnviroWorld) -- North Greenwood city officials
are planning to expand a sewer plant, but area residents are not keen on
the idea, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
City officials are planning to add two large holding tanks, pumping stations
and a water-testing lab at the plant on Marshall Street and Harbor Drive,
but residents would prefer the plant be moved because of the smell the plant
emits and the possible property value loss.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, residents aren't happy with the idea that the two large tanks
would hold reclaimed water, which Island Estates, a Clearwater neighborhood,
petitioned for, and residents would pay $14 a month for reclaimed water
whether they used it or not.<BR>
<BR>
City Engineer Richard Baier told the Times other options are being studied.
He also mentioned steps would be taken to reduce the smell. Design work
for the project won't be complete until December 1997, he said.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TARPON SPRINGS -- (EnviroWorld) -- City Manger Costa Vatikiotis
is concerned with Tarpon Springs sewer plant's problems ranging from lack
of maintenance to lack of permits, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
One of Vatikiotis' major concerns is that a section of the plant was built
to chemically treat sludge and turn it into dirt called N-Viro soil. According
to Vatikiotis, he didn't realize a construction permit wasn't granted for
part of the plant until a silo failed an emissions test in December.<BR>
<BR>
Vatikiotis told the Times it will cost the city at least $25,000 to expand
the filter system on two silos to cut down emissions of lime dust, but he
doesn't think it can be done by the April 15 deadline set by the Pinellas
County Air Quality Division.<BR>
<BR>
Peter Hessling, administrator of the county's air quality division, told
the Times that the silos need to pass emissions tests, as well as comply
with other conditions such as keeping maintenance records, if the city is
to get an operating permit for its sludge treatment process.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Wekiva Basin greenway</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>LAKE COUNTY--(EnviroWorld)--Rep. John Mica, of Winter Park is
leading a delegation of central Florida congressmen and the state's two
U.S. Senators to get the federal government to assist in buying land for
the Wekiva Basin greenway, the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
The proposed greenway would connect the Ocala National Forest with Blue
Spring and Wekiva River state parks. The Congressmen hope to get $10 million
out of a $140 million pot that Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt controls.
The money would buy 3,270 acres along the St. John's River in Lake County.<BR>
<BR>
Robert Christianson, director of planning and acquisition for the St. John's
River Water Management District, told the Sentinel that, if completed, the
greenway would provide a continuous piece of land large enough to protect
the Florida Black Bear and other threatened species.<BR>
<BR>
Babbitt toured the St. Johns River system during the river's cleanup event
in February, and water management district officials believe he supports
the greenway.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--Though some cheap dredging would
fix the problems homeowners face along the Little Wekiva River in the short
term, a panel of environmentalists, legislators and other government representatives
agreed to seek funds for a long term solution, the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
The panel has asked state Rep. Ken Pruitt, of the House Appropriations Committee,
to include $2 million towards the $8 million project in the committee's
version of the state budget.<BR>
<BR>
The project would improve the rate of dropoff in the river, which now causes
silt to accumulate downstream and makes nearby subdivisions prone to flooding.</BLOCKQUOTE>

constitutional sugar tax</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--An editorial in the Florida Times-Union
speaks against the petition drive that would allow Florida voters to decide
on a penny-per-pound sugar tax for the sugar industry.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Everyone gets weak-kneed when the words 'endangered ecosystem' are
bandied about, but the Everglades is endangered because Florida's elected
officials, in league with U.S. government officials, carried out a long
assault on the Everglades in a &quot;swamp reclamation&quot; project that
involved redirecting the water flowing into the Everglades into the ocean,
wasting billions of gallons of fresh water and drying up the natural ecosystem,
but also creating thousands of acres of land for agriculture and urban development.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The Times-Union opposes the ballot initiative because &quot;it would greatly
trivialize the (constitutional amendment) process to let it be used by special
interests to advance a political agenda,&quot; and also because it would
&quot;make the farmers the scapegoats.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The penny-tax would generate about $35 million per year. That would be part
of the $1.5 billion that the Clinton Administration has proposed spending
on the Everglades over seven years. The petition campaign is being run by
the group Save Our Everglades.</BLOCKQUOTE>

interest with EPA contracts</STRONG> </A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)--Radian Corporation has been ordered
to stop performing work for EPA while the agency conducts a review for possible
conflicts of interest, EPA administrator Carol M. Browner announced today.
<BR>
<BR>
The decision was based on Radian's recent merger with Dow Environmental,
Inc., a subsidiary of Dow Chemical Company. The new company, Radian International
Limited Liability Company, is 60 percent owned by Dow. Parts of Dow's industrial
activities, as well as those of its competitors, are subject to rules administered
by EPA. Dow is also a supplier to many EPA-regulated industries. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The most basic priority of good government is integrity,&quot; said
Browner. &quot;We are taking this step because environmental policies must
be based on sound science and impartial data that are beyond reproach. EPA
must be responsive to no interest other than the public's.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I deeply regret that important environmental work in some areas may
be temporarily delayed while we evaluate the potential conflicts of interest,&quot;
Browner said. &quot;However, no company providing services to EPA can be
allowed to hold a financial stake -- or even the appearance of a financial
stake -- in the outcome of our policies.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Radian has been a contractor for EPA since 1971, performing tasks like technical
support for the development of regulations in the areas of clean air, clean
water, and toxic substances, as well as providing technical support for
enforcement and pollution prevention activities. Until today, Radian was
providing technical support for EPA's Water Program in the development of
clean-water regulations for several industrial categories, and it was assisting
EPA's Air Program with support for development of several national air emission
standards. <BR>
<BR>
The &quot;stop work&quot; orders issued yesterday to Radian apply to all
13 of its current contracts with the Agency. The affected work assignments
have a potential value of up to $11.8 million. While work is stopped, EPA
will review all of Radian's current tasks and evaluate the extent of any
potential conflicts.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our review of Radian's contracts will be completed quickly,&quot;
said Browner, &quot;so that we can get on with the Agency's important work
with minimal delay.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

Court rejects private lawsuits against states</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- The U.S. Supreme Court ruled
on March 27 that Congress lacks the power under the commerce clause to subject
states to suits brought by individuals in federal court for violations of
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
(CERCLA). <BR>
<BR>
Though the opinion deals specifically with suits against states by Indian
tribes under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, the majority opinion overruled
Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., and called into question whether federal
courts can entertain private suits against states to enforce other federal
environmental laws. <BR>
<BR>
According to Jonathan A. Glogau, an assistant attorney general who argued
the case on behalf of the state of Florida, this decision clearly invalidates
provisions of CERCLA allowing individuals to sue states for cleanup costs
in federal court. He also added that the ruling would probably undermine
other provisions of federal environmental laws that have subjected states
and state agencies to compliance actions brought by private parties. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The ruling will not, however, affect the ability of the federal government
to ensure compliance by states and state agencies,&quot; emphasized Glogau.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>BROOKSVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Many farmers in West Central
Florida are resistant to installing meters on their irrigation wells and
water managers are considering resorting to fines, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Water managers are concerned with the cumulative effects of pumping so much
water in from the district's 16 counties, therefore a decision was made
to monitor water use by employing meters. About 600 businesses in West Central
Florida have not installed the meters on 1,100 farm wells, but water managers
are extending the requirement until May 31. After that date, fines could
range up to $10,000 a day, according to the Tribune.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We don't want to issue fines, but that's the potential,&quot; Michael
Molligan of the Southwest Florida Water Management District told the Tribune.
&quot;It's imperative that we closely monitor these withdrawals.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>BRANDON -- (EnviroWorld) -- They're falling from trees, crowding
the sidewalks and munching on picnics. The Forest Tent Caterpillars are
back in hordes and are terrorizing west Florida for the third consecutive
spring, the Tampa Tribune reported. <BR>
<BR>
Though the 2-inch crawlers may be a nuisance, they aren't harmful to humans.
In addition, they may eat plant leaves and strip oak trees bare, but they
do not cause any serious damage and the leaves will grow back, State Forest
Entomologist Jim Meeker told the Tribune. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's just a native insect on a high wing,&quot; Meeker said. Every
so often, caterpillar populations swell for two- to six-year periods. This
latest outbreak started three years ago, Meeker told the Tribune.<BR>
<BR>
Experts suggest against spraying trees and plants because instead of killing
the larvae, the insecticide could hurt many of the caterpillar's natural
predators.<BR>
<BR>
Look out, though. Next month, the outbreak of caterpillars turns into nocturnal
moths. For more information on the insects, call the Horticulture Helpline
at (813) 224-8972.</BLOCKQUOTE>

in Volusia</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>DELAND --(EnviroWorld)-- In an effort to protect nesting sea
turtles, the Volusia County Council decided Thursday to enforce the same
restrictions on beach driving that it did last year, until new rules are
approved by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
Beginning May 1, the start of the nesting season, those wishing to drive
on Volusia beaches must stay at least 30 feet away from dunes and sea walls
along the shoreline. These are favorite nesting spots for sea turtles.<BR>
<BR>
The rules will probably be temporary, lasting until the county gets the
Fish &amp;Wildlife Service to approve a sea turtle habitat conservation
plan. In the new plan, 30-foot conservation zones would be kept along some
parts of the shoreline but boundaries would be reduced to 15 feet in urban
areas. Also, there would be three no driving areas, one covering most of
Ponce Inlet and two others along the extreme northern and southern parts
of the county's shoreline.<BR>
<BR>
Fish &amp;Wildlife officials are accepting public comments until April 10,
after which they will process the comments and make a final recommendation.
The process is expected to take 30 to 90 days.</BLOCKQUOTE>

preserve Ichetucknee</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE --(EnviroWorld)-- State officials fear mine blasting
at two limerock pits may ruin the water of the Ichetucknee River, and have
proposed that the state buy the mines to prevent any damage to the river
and its springs, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
White Construction Co. has proposed building an asphalt plant at its Limerock
Industries mine, which is next to a second mine owned by Anderson Mining
Co. The mines are five miles North of Ichetucknee State Springs Park. <BR>
<BR>
Jim Stevenson of the state Department of Environmental Protection said he
is concerned that the chemicals used to make asphalt might get into the
limerock pits and eventually into the groundwater. He was also concerned
that mineblasting could breach underground passageways for groundwater that
flows to the springs.<BR>
<BR>
Stevenson said he has sent a letter to White Construction about his concerns
and asking if the company would be interested in selling the mine, but has
not received a response.<BR>
<BR>
The mines are full of cloudy water, but would be converted into fishing
ponds and opened to the public if bought by the state, Stevenson said.</BLOCKQUOTE>

but no strict limits on construction</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE --(EnviroWorld)-- Gov. Lawton Chiles and his Cabinet
said the residents of the Florida Keys will not have to foot the bill for
the clean up of sewage pollution that is harming the coral reefs and clouding
the water in the area, but backed off a plan to impose strict limits to
new developments in the Keys, the Associated Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
The Cabinet approved a proposed growth management plan for Monroe County
that requires a $250 million sewage treatment plant for the Marathon area
in the Middle Keys and cleanup of some of the 11,000 cesspools that pour
raw sewage into the groundwater and the sea.<BR>
<BR>
The program will be paid for by a variety of sources, including the county
residents and the agencies ordered to help in the cleanup - such as the
Department of Environmental Protection and Health and Rehabilitative Services.
<BR>
<BR>
At the same time, the cabinet decided not to impose stricter limits on the
number of new building permits that can be issued before the new sewage
plant is built. Originally Chiles and the Cabinet backed a judge's ruling
that said excessive development of the islands led to problems with pollution
and hurricane evacuations and posed a threat to the endangered Key deer.
But, instead of allowing a compromise limit of offering only 88 permits
a year, Chiles and the Cabinet approved a tentative plan to allow the county
to issue 255 permits a year.<BR>
<BR>
Environmentalists have been pushing for the limits and said they would challenge
the new growth management plan.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON --(EnviroWorld)-- Congress passed a new farm bill
that would end price-based subsidies and government planting controls that
have been the basis of farm policy since the 1930s, the Associated Press
reported.<BR>
<BR>
The bill was passed in the House, 318-89, at 1 a.m. Friday morning. The
Senate had approved the bill earlier, 74 -26.<BR>
<BR>
The seven-year &quot;Freedom to Farm&quot; bill would end the link between
price and subsidies. Instead, it would guarantee farmers steadily declining
&quot;market transition payments&quot; based on past subsidies. It would
also mean that the government would no longer require land to remain idle
or deny payments if farmers switch form their historical crop.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- Two wetlands bills being considered
in Congress could eliminate federal Clean Water Act protection for more
than 7 million acres of Florida wetlands, a Florida Consumer Action Network
press release said.<BR>
<BR>
The House bill (H.R. 961) has already been passed, and the Senate bill (S.
851) is pending. The bills would declare areas now called wetlands to be
non-wetlands, and therefore ineligible for protection under the Clean Water
Act. Nationally, more than 73 million acres of wetlands would be affected.<BR>

In most states, wetlands that would lose protection under the proposed laws
play an important role in maintaining water quality.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>MINNEAPOLIS --(EnviroWorld)-- Treatment and disposal operations
at 24 commercial hazardous waste management firms were discontinued in 1995,
a report by Environmental Information, Ltd. stated.<BR>
<BR>
The total number of RCRA-permitted treatment and disposal facilities at
the end of 1995 was found to be 240, down form about 300 found in 1993.<BR>
<BR>
The decline is part of an long-term evolution of the hazardous waste management
sector, EI Digest report said. Waste minimization efforts by industry have
lessened the hazardous wastes coming into the plants. The greater competition
for wastes have caused many facilities to consolidate or close.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--Gov. Lawton Chiles and the Cabinet
agreed with a state hearing officer's recommendation and approved plans
for a small hydroelectric plant on the Withlacoochee River, the St. Petersburg
Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
If all other permits are obtained, the plant will be built in the Cross
Florida Greenway, land that was once a part of the Cross Florida Barge Canal
project. The company that will operate the plant, Gainesville-based Southern
Hy-Power Corp., will lease the property from the state. Company officials
said the $5 million plant will be the size of a two-car garage and will
be able to supply all the electrical needs for the nearby communities of
Inglis and Yankeetown.<BR>
<BR>
Residents of Citrus and Levy counties and state officials have debated the
plant for more than two years. At first, the governor and Cabinet ruled
hydroelectric plants could not be built in the Greenway, but the Legislature
later decided hydro power was allowable.<BR>
<BR>
The project must still obtain state and federal environmental permits.</BLOCKQUOTE>

toward reality</STRONG> </A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--Private companies have long been
wary of building desalinized water plants because their water rates would
have to be approved by the Public Service Commission. But if Gov. Chiles
signs a bill passed in the Legislature last week, that roadblock will be
eliminated. And at least one company is ready to start on a Pasco County
plant that would be one of the world's largest, the St. Petersburg Times
reported.<BR>
<BR>
Progress Energy, a subsidiary of Florida Progress, would like to build a
plant on the Anclote River capable of desalinating 30 million gallons of
water a day. The company would sell the water to West Coast Regional Water
Supply Authority, the water utility for the thirsty Tampa Bay region, at
a cost several times higher than other water sources. Company officials
said passage of the bill cut some of the riskiness out of such a venture.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;To have another body in there overseeing your rates of return and
have the risk they would judge them to be too high or too low adds an element
of uncertainty we don't think needs to be there,&quot; Jim Keppeler, manager
of desalination systems for Progress Energy, told the Times.<BR>
<BR>
One potential conflict for Florida Progress is that it also sells electricity
to Florida Power, whose rates are regulated by the Public Service Commission.<BR>
<BR>
Bruce Kennedy, director of resource management for West Coast, said &quot;The
Public Service Commission would still look closely at electrical costs to
make sure that's not subsidizing the water activity if the water is not
regulated. It's a real concern.&quot;<BR>
Chiles has not yet taken a position on the bill. <BR>
<BR>
But even if the bill is signed, there's no guarantee of a desal plant. A
contract, subject to competitive bids, would have to be won from the water
utility. While Progress Energy seems to hold the best hand for that contract,
West Coast if far from committed to using desalinized water. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;If desal costs $4 per thousand gallons, it's not going to happen in
the next 10 to 15 years,&quot; said Ed Turanchik, chairman of West Coast
and a Hillsborough County Commissioner. &quot;That's just too much.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Environmental questions also remain. Desalination creates brine which would
be discharged into the Gulf of Mexico. The impacts of altered salinity levels
on coastal ecology could sink such a large plant.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The jury is out and the verdict is far from in on desal,&quot; Turanchik
said. &quot;We're going to go out and ask a lot of questions.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

hurting sandhill cranes</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WESLEY CHAPEL--(EnviroWorld)--Florida sandhill cranes in the
Tampa Bay area are losing out to humans in a very obvious way, the Tampa
Tribune reported. The crane is becoming a frequent sight along highway medians
as they lose wetland habitat, and biologists and environmentalists say one
of the chief reasons for disappearing wetlands is overpumping of water in
Pasco and Hillsborough counties.<BR>
<BR>
Ann Schnapf, president of the Tampa Audubon Society, told the Tribune, &quot;This
wellfield drawdown is our number one concern right now. We're losing entire
wetland communities, including the sandhill crane, and it's going to be
a permanent loss.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Len Bartos, an environmental manager with the Southwest Florida Water Management
District also confirmed that crane nesting sites had been destroyed as lakes
and wetlands have dried up in the vicinity of wellfields.<BR>
<BR>
Statewide, the crimson-crested crane numbers 4,000 to 6,000.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE --(EnviroWorld)-- A bill up for review by the Florida
Legislature would make it easier for local governments to change the way
small parcels of land are developed, the Florida Times-Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
The state now requires that every community have a growth plan which must
be approved in Tallahassee. Each community is allowed to change the way
up to 60 acres of land included in that plan is developed each year, as
long as no single area exceeds 10 acres.<BR>
<BR>
The revised version of this law up for debate drops the 60-acre maximum
as long, though individual parcels must still be less than 10 acres.<BR>
<BR>
Advocates of the plan believe the change cuts red tape of government. Opponents
see it as a way to undermine plans for a city's future.<BR>
<BR>
Bob Riley, senior planner for Jacksonville, said that the city had used
up its 60-acre-quota for 1996 by the first week of February.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>PENSACOLA --(EnviroWorld)-- Champion International Corp. has
agreed to pay $5 million to settle a class action suit, brought by residents

of polluting Perdido Bay and a tributary, the Associated Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
The plaintiffs contended that the bay and Eleven Mile Creek in Florida had
been polluted with dioxins and other toxic substances released through the
use of chlorine in the paper bleaching process. They believe that Champion
knew of the problem in the mid-1980s and should have warned nearby residents.<BR>
<BR>
Company officials admit no fault in the settlement and say they have spent
$51 million on new pollution technology over the past 15 months.<BR>
<BR>
The plaintiffs wanted $500 million. The settlement comes out to $1,625 per
plaintiff, once the lawyers fees are deducted. The suit was brought on behalf
of about 2,000 waterfront residents in Florida and Alabama.</BLOCKQUOTE>

proportions in green turtles</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CLEARWATER --(EnviroWorld)-- Green sea turtles have been turning
up in alarming numbers with an often-fatal disease that causes tumors to
grow on the turtles' eyes, mouth, flippers and other soft tissues, the Associated
Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
Twenty-two of the turtles have been handled by the Clearwater Marine Aquarium
since November.<BR>
<BR>
Surgically removing the tumors, called fibropapillomas, is the only known
way to counteract the disease. Once the cysts are removed, many turtles
recover because they build up an immunity to the disease. Only juvenile
green turtles, ages 5 to 10 years, have been afflicted so far.<BR>
<BR>
The disease can result in blindness, obstruction in swimming and feeding
and susceptibility to leeches. Researchers are unsure what causes the disease,
which was first seen in turtles in the 1930s. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG--(EnviroWorld)--An editorial in the St. Petersburg
Times criticizes the environmental self-audit bill, calling it the Polluters
Protection Act.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Most right-minded people probably think businesses would want to find
out if they are illegally polluting the environment and take steps to correct
any harm they have done. Tallahassee's business lobbyists, however, say
industry needs an incentive to do the right thing.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But covering up pollution is an awfully high price to pay to persuade
companies to do the right thing. Common criminals who can't afford lobbying
teams in Tallahassee certainly aren't treated with such indulgence by the
Legislature.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The bill is being considered by the Senate Natural Resources Committee today.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO--(EnviroWorld)--With several options for cleaning the
heavily-polluted Lake Apopka on the legislative table, the Friends of Lake
Apopka is holding a rally to decide which ones to support, the Orlando Sentinel
reported.<BR>
<BR>
Several proposals would limit discharges of farm runoff to the lake by various
means. One of those would tax farmers for the cost of building a runoff
control system. But another proposal, which the lake's farmers support,
would buy them out at a cost of about $95 million.<BR>
<BR>
Jim Thomas, a founder and board member of Friends of Apopka, told the Sentinel
he is discouraging the buyout proposal.<BR>
<BR>
Orange County Chairwoman Linda Chapin, state Sen. Buddy Dyer, D-Orlando,
and state Rep. Bill Sublette, R-Orlando are scheduled to speak at the meeting,
which will be held at 7 p.m. tonight in Winter Garden at Tanner Hall. It
is open to the public.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Florida</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA--(EnviroWorld)--The 70-page report on a test in which
19 cougars were released in North Florida concludes that the endangered
Florida panther could survive there, the Tampa Tribune reported. <BR>
<BR>
Nineteen Texas cougars were released in Columbia County in 1993 and carefully
tracked. Those cougars had different backgrounds--some came straight from
the wild, some were caught in the wild and raised in captivity for a year,
and some had spent their entire lives in captivity.<BR>
<BR>
Biologists concluded that panthers which came straight from the wild fared
best because they were more likely to avoid human contact. It is an important
finding because many of those who object to panther reintroduction fear
livestock losses.<BR>
<BR>
Five of the cougars died, two were shot, two were run over, and one died
in a trap. And even though the males were vasectomized, one fathered five
kittens. The males ranged as far north as Augusta, Georgia.<BR>
<BR>
A permanent reintroduction of the panther could draw strong protest from
some local groups, the Tribune reported. In light of that, the report states,
&quot;It must first be decided, however, whether the tremendous costs involved
(economic, political, social) ... can be offset by the benefits gained.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>YBOR CITY--(EnviroWorld)--Strong odors surrounded the start
of a three-week cleanup of contaminated soil at an Ybor City gas plant Monday,
the Tampa Tribune reported. The fumes are being monitored closely as workers
remove 10,000 tons of soil that received 60 years of coal tar and petroleum
waste. <BR>
<BR>
The soil from the Peoples Gas Company will be taken to an incinerator at
Port Manatee, and, after the hazardous waste has been burned off, it will
be returned to the old gas plant. The cleanup is part of a 1990 agreement
with the state Department of Environmental Protection and will cost more
than $1 million.<BR>
<BR>
No gas has been produced at the site since 1959. Creosote contamination
was first discovered there in 1986.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO -- (EnviroWorld) -- A two-year-old killer whale, with
several health problems, died of undetermined causes at Sea World of Florida
yesterday, the Orlando Sentinel and Florida Times Union Reported.<BR>
<BR>
Nyar is the second whale to die at the Orlando attraction in less than a
month. She was the second offspring of Gudrun, a 5,000 pound female who
died Feb. 25 a few days after giving birth to a stillborn calf.<BR>
<BR>
Nyar was born Dec. 31, 1993 and had a number of physical ailments that could
have contributed to her death. She weighed 1,400 pounds, far below the 2,000
to 3,000 pound average for that age. A necropsy is being conducted, but
test results are not expected for several weeks.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- Fans of the Florida panther have raised
more than $12 million by buying the specialty license tags and most think
their money goes to help protect the official state animal from extinction,
according to the Associated Press.<BR>
<BR>
However, since the tags went on sale in 1990, in most years, less than 20
cents of every dollar goes toward panther recovery programs. The trust fund
holding tag sales revenue goes to fund other government activities and the
Legislature is considering several proposals to make it even easier to grab
from the panther trust fund.<BR>
<BR>
The Florida Panther Research and Management Trust Fund receives 45 percent
of panther tag revenues - about $1.7 million this year. Nearly $1 million
was stripped from the trust fund last year to make up for a cut from the
Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission's general operating budget.
<BR>
<BR>
About $675,00 from the panther fund goes directly to the game commission's
biological and management efforts to protect the panther. About $4 million
remains in the trust fund, while research that could use that money is considered.<BR>
<BR>
Large chunks of the money are spent on programs to buy land for state and
local government projects, rarely with anything to do with the panther.
Some tag proceeds go toward multilingual environmental classes in Dade County,
teaching residents to protect lakes in Winter Haven and courses in green
construction for building contractors at the University of Florida.</BLOCKQUOTE>

WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- U.S. construction spending unexpectedly dropped
in February as weakness in commercial and government projects outweighed
an increase in new-home building, according to the Gainesville Sun. <BR>
<BR>
Spending fell 0.9 percent - the largest loss since May - to an annual rate
of $5 34.9 billion, the Commerce Department reported. Spending rose a revised
0.9 percent in January, initially reported as a 0.3 percent gain. Analysts
had expected a 0.4 percent increase in construction spending in February.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>FORT LAUDERDALE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Critics of emissions testing
claim a key tool used to measure the state's emissions-testing program's
effectiveness - a computer model created by the Environmental Protection
Agency - is flawed, according to the Associated Press. In addition, environmental
regulators are saying the emissions tests themselves play only a minor role
in reducing pollution.<BR>
<BR>
Car engines that now burn 90 percent cleaner than their 1970s predecessors,
and gasolines modified to cast off fewer fumes as they evaporate, have done
considerably more to lower pollution than emissions tests, regulators say.
<BR>
<BR>
The emissions bureaus told the Associated Press that during the summer of
1994, tests reduced hydrocarbons, an exhaust gas that helps form ozone,
by almost 10 percent. Tests also lowered carbon monoxide, the other pollutant
they target, by almost 14 percent. But those findings could be theoretical.
According to the Associate Press, the findings are mainly produced by an
EPA-created computer model dubbed MOBILE5a that studies indicate has a wide
margin of error.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>MIAMI -- (EnviroWorld) -- Longtime crusader of the Florida Everglades,
Marjorie Stoneman Douglas, will turn 106 years-old on Sunday.<BR>
<BR>
The Gainesville Sun reports Douglas has spent a majority of her life trying

Some of her life's goals are coming true, too. Last, month, the U.S. Congress

restoration efforts</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- A year after first hitting the
road, sales of Indian River Lagoon license plates have raised more than
$225,000 for restoration and preservation efforts.<BR>
<BR>
Since becoming available in March 1995, more than 15,000 Floridians have
purchased the state's first specialty fish plate that depicts a snook swimming
through sea grass. Those sales have allowed the St. Johns River and South
Florida water management districts to launch restoration projects that already
are providing significant benefits to the lagoon.<BR>
<BR>
The tag helps finance several projects: reconnecting salt marshes in the
lagoon to enhance the fisheries; construction of sediment traps in stormwater
drainage basins and development of stormwater treatment areas; development
of educational exhibits and materials; restoration of spoil islands; restoration
of shoreline mangroves; replacement of exotic vegetation with native vegetation.<BR>
<BR>
Each plate raises $15 for the lagoon, with at least 80 percent going to
restoration projects and the remaining revenue going to public education
projects focusing on the lagoon. None of the proceeds are used for administrative
salaries.</BLOCKQUOTE>

consider requiring prop guards on boats</STRONG> </A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--The Senate Natural Resources Committee
voted on a proposal Tuesday to require prop guards on new boats, the St.
Petersburg Times reported. Though Senators defeated the proposal, the vote
was close enough that Sen. Charlie Crist, R-St. Petersburg said he would
resubmit it.<BR>
<BR>
The committee was discussing a boating safety bill that would require teenagers
and boat renters to take safety classes when Crist offered the prop-guard
amendment. Many Senators expressed support or, at least interest, in such
a law, but protests came from boat manufacturers and lobbyists.<BR>
<BR>
The Times quoted National Marine Manufacturers Association lobbyist Wade
Hopping as saying, &quot;I think you're hitting a gnat with a hammer. ...
There are a lot of ups and downs with prop guards.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Crist said prop guards would reduce injuries to manatees and swimmers. Boat
prop injuries are the number one cause of death to the manatee, and boating
accidents resulted in 80 human deaths last year. <BR>
<BR>
The amendment was defeated on a voice vote, but Crist said the next time
a suitable bill arose, he would offer it again. Now that legislators and
lobbyists are aware of the possibility, more may warm to the issue.<BR>
<BR>
The committee approved the boating safety bill.</BLOCKQUOTE>

electricity</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA--(EnviroWorld)--With deregulation of the electrical utilities
looming on the horizon, Lykes Energy, Inc. is taking steps to get into the
consumer power market, the St. Petersburg Times reported. <BR>
<BR>
Tuesday the company, part of Tampa's Lykes family conglomerate, announced
that it had formed a new business geared toward electricity and energy management.
For now, the business will serve as a power consultant for other companies.
But it will also be in a good position to begin generating and selling electricity
if that market opens.<BR>
<BR>
In other parts of the country, such as California, laws have been relaxed
that allow greater competition among utilities. Florida still tightly regulates
the industry, but many feel deregulation is inevitable. If that happens,
it may become possible for electricity to be bought wholesale from anywhere
in the country. The only limitation on buying the cheapest electricity available
comes from &quot;wheeling fees,&quot; the charges paid for sending electricity
through another utilities lines on the way to its final destination.<BR>
<BR>
The Florida energy market is expected to exceed $10-billion by 2005 with
annual growth projected at 3 to 5 percent, the Times reported. <BR>
<BR>
The new company is called Lykes-Duke/Louis Dreyfus. Lykes Energy's partners
are the North Carolina-based Duke Energy Corp., an owner and operator of
power-related facilities, and Connecticut's Louis Dreyfus Electric Power
Inc., a leading power marketer. The Lykes family owns businesses ranging
from meat packaging and orange juice to shipping and oil exploration. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>JUNO BEACH--(EnviroWorld)--Florida Power and Light took one
more step towards using the controversial Orimulsion fuel. On March 28,
The EPA gave the Army Corp. of Engineers the go-ahead to issue a dredge-and-fill
permit for the project, saying it meets regulations.<BR>
<BR>
FP&amp;L wants to burn the tar-based, water-soluble fuel at its Manatee
power plant. Along with environmental groups and local agencies, the EPA
had cited concerns about wetland impacts, NOx emissions, increased water
withdrawals, and spill prevention/cleanup measures connected with the fuel.<BR>
<BR>
However, EPA regional administrator John H. Hankinson Jr. said in a March
28 letter to the Corps that the agency's concerns were resolved through
&quot;considerable scrutiny by a wide variety of agencies and the public
and (the project) has changed in a number of important aspects.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The letter continues, &quot;Based on the probable reduction of direct wetland
impacts, the increase in compensatory mitigation and the changes in the
project to address the indirect water quality impacts we find that the project
is now in compliance...&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Tom Reese, lawyer for Manasota-88, the primary environmental group opposed
to Orimulsion's use, said the EPA's permission was of little relevance.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The wetlands involved (for the dredge and fill permit) were not of
good quality,&quot; Reese said. &quot;(The EPA) was just trying to see how
far they could extend their jurisdiction.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Reese said that an EPA decision on an air emissions permit was more important,
and that the agency had some concerns over how BACTA (best available control
technology) calculations had been made.<BR>
<BR>
The project still has to be approved by Gov. Lawton Chile and the Cabinet.
That decision will be made later this month.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--The environmental self-audit is
showing no momentum in legislative committees. It fizzled in a House subcommittee
last week, and Tuesday the bill never made it to a vote in the Senate Natural
Resources Committee, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
The bill would allow businesses to keep records of pollution incidents secret
from regulators and the public if steps were taken to clean up the problem
within the company. Businesses support the bill, saying it would encourage
cleanups, not coverups, since companies could avoid pollution fines. Critics
say the bill is an invitation to corruption.<BR>
<BR>
Department of Environmental Regulation spokesman Dale Patchett told the
Tribune that the department had stopped being an immediate enemy of polluters
anyway. &quot;We're no longer in the business of trying to penalize for
the sake of penalty,&quot; he said.<BR>
<BR>
The committee was still discussing the bill when time ran out, as Senators
questioned the need for secrecy. The bill is delayed at least another week.

<BLOCKQUOTE>PONCE INLET --(EnviroWorld)-- The Waveberg System, invented
by John Berg of Oak hill, uses the natural motion of waves to generate electricity
that the inventor says is pollution-free and won't interfere with the ocean
ecosystem, the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
According to Berg, the Waveberg System uses a tripod design with three floating
legs which act as arms for pumps. The device uses the up-and-down motion
of the waves to harness that power into hydraulic energy. The energy can
then be piped to shore and converted into electricity or any other form
of energy.<BR>

birds</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>SARASOTA --(EnviroWorld)-- Nearly 50 cormorants and loons have
been found sick or dead on the Gulf Coast barrier islands in the past week,
but the cause of the illness is unknown, the Associated Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
The birds were brought to a bird sanctuary on City Island in Saratoga, where
35 are now recovering. Andy McCurry, managing director of the Pelican Man's
Bird Sanctuary, said the symptoms of the birds include listlessness and
dizziness, like they were intoxicated. With the use of fluids, the sanctuary
has been able to save many of the birds.<BR>
<BR>
The sick birds are diving birds that look for food in the waters of the
Gulf of Mexico and surrounding bay waters.<BR>
<BR>
This mystery joins the illnesses that have killed many manatees, dolphins
and sea turtles in Gulf Coast waters. No cause has been determined for any
of the sicknesses. Alan Huff of the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection cautioned that the deaths may not be related.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ENVIROWORLD -- Environmental market growth will be lower than
last year's predictions, according to a new survey of the industry's largest
players, the Engineering News-Record reported.<BR>
<BR>
The survey, by the Environmental Financial Consulting Group, included responses
from 36 environmental firms, all with revenue exceeding $80 million. Last
October, these firms predicted a 6.5 percent median revenue hike for 1996,
but respondents have anticipated their internal revenue growing 4.4 percent
on average this year, with the median increase at just 2.5 percent, according
to ENR.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It is clear that the environment looks far bleaker today than it did
at our conference last October,&quot; Paul Zofnass, EFCG president, told
ENR. &quot;While several of the largest firms are still anticipating a decent
year, most are now predicting little, or negative growth, particularly in
their core environmental business.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
These environmental firms are predicting the federal cleanup sector will
be hit the hardest due to budget cuts and uncertainties. However, growth
may still occur in the international market, though representing only a
small portion of revenue for U.S. environmental firms.<BR>
<BR>
Because of this uncertainty, firms may consider shrinking staff to cut costs
and boost profitability. Two-thirds of the responding firms anticipate laying
off 5 percent of the work force, Zofnass told ENR.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>LIVE OAK -- (EnviroWorld) -- The numbers are still rising. As
of yesterday, 103 manatees have died in Southwest Florida since March 5,
putting the 1996 statewide mortality total at 193. That number is only eight
less than 1995's total of 201 manatee deaths.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Passing the 100 mark is a grave milestone that saddens us all,&quot;
said DEP Secretary Virginia Wetherell. &quot;This tragedy has put the spotlight
on some of our most dedicated and diligent employees. I'm very proud of
them.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As the carcasses are recovered daily, they are transported to the DEP's
Marine Research Institute in St. Petersburg, where scientists perform necropsises
to determine cause of death and take numerous blood and tissue samples.
The only common symptom between the animals are lung lesions, indicating
pneumonia. <BR>
<BR>
The majority of manatees that have died have been large, healthy adult animals
found in the waters of Southwest Florida, stretching from Englewood to Marco
Island. Scientists have not yet determined the cause of this epidemic, but
a viral infection is considered a likely culprit.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- The EPA has announced a proposal
to streamline and simplify the process of determining which new and modified
industrial facilities must be reviewed for significant environmental impact.
<BR>
<BR>
The New Source Review (NSR) program should cut the paperwork for obtaining
air emission permits under , saving industry and states over $13 million
a year in administrative costs, while still ensuring strong environmental
protection, the agency predicts.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Today's proposal will protect public health while providing state
governments and industry with greater flexibility, speedier air emissions
permits and increased incentives for the use of improved air pollution control
technology,&quot; said EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner.<BR>
<BR>
The proposal will also help protect the visibility of scenic vistas in critical
natural areas, such as the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone National Park and the
Shenandoah Valley. <BR>
<BR>
A few of the key reforms in this proposal include: Plants installing effective
pollution prevention measures or innovative pollution control technology
would be exempted from NSR; Pollution control projects substituting environmentally-safe
substitutes for ozone-depleting substances (such as CFCs) would be exempt;
Facilities doing a good job of controlling air pollution are granted more
flexibility than those doing a poor job; States would be given greater flexibility
in determining pollution control technology that their industries must use.<BR>

revised </STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- According to the GAO report &quot;Water
Pollution: Many Violations Have Not Received Appropriate Enforcement Attention,&quot;
assessment of penalties under the Clean Water Act needs to be revised to
ensure that penalties for significant and comparable violations of different
types of discharge limits are equitable. <BR>
<BR>
The report, issued April 1, also states that inequities currently exist
due to EPA's outdated definition of &quot;significant noncompliance&quot;
with discharge permit limits. The report says EPA criterion excluded violations
of effluent discharge limits expressed in other terms - daily average limits
vs. weekly average limits vs. monthly average limits. <BR>
<BR>
The criterion, developed ten years ago, assumes that discharge limits for
pollutants would be expressed as monthly average limits. However, many facilities
do not have monthly average limits written into their permits for pollutants
that are discharged continuously. As a result, a violation of a monthly
average limit for a pollutant could result in a penalty of up to $750,000,
while the violation of a daily maximum limit for the same pollutant over
the same period of time would only lead to a penalty of $25,000.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>PANAMA CITY BEACH -- (EnviroWorld)-- The Florida Marine Fisheries
Commission voted to place tight restrictions on the use of trawls for catching
bait fish, the Associated Press reported. If approved by Gov. Chiles and
the Cabinet, the rule will ban trawling for bait from Nov. 16 to March 31
within one mile off the Atlantic coast and three miles off the Gulf coast.<BR>
<BR>
Bait trawling has come into use since the state's gill-net ban was enacted
in July 1995. Trawls are bag-like nets that are buoyed to the bottom with
large weights and dragged along the water's surface. The commission is concerned
with trawls because they catch more non-targeted species -- called bycatch
-- than any other gear.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Gainesville</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE-- (EnviroWorld) -- Gainesville officials have been
presented with a proposal for an entirely privatized mass-transit system,
but their reaction has been largely skeptical, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
Seatec Group submitted a plan to transportation planners Tuesday for a train
that runs on natural gas on a track 26 feet above ground. The first-phase
of the plan calls for a 2.75 mile track from the University of Florida campus
to outlying parking lots. Seatec managing partner Mike Hofgren said a one-way
ride on the fiberglass railed system would cost 50 cents.<BR>
<BR>
But several Gainesville officials interviewed by the Sun had reservations
about the project's feasibility. A 1989 Department of Transportation study
determined that Gainesville's population simply was not dense enough to
support a rail system, and officials say some necessary details are lacking
in the plan. Whether Hofgren can obtain financing to privately build the
system is also in question.<BR>
<BR>
Hofgren said the company's &quot;Ultrarail&quot; system was much cheaper
than systems considered by the DOT, and that the DOT study only looked at
options which used existing train rails. He has been talking to UF officials
about the plan for 18 months, and was told to bring it before local transportation
planners. <BR>
<BR>
UF engineering professor Fazil T. Najafi said the plan was a &quot;good
idea,&quot; but lacked an environmental impact statement and engineering
specifications. Najafi is seeking a grant to study transit options for UF
students. <BR>
<BR>
The University's population is expected to grow by several thousand students
before the end of the century, and one of the biggest problems school administrators
and city officials face with that growth is finding ways to avoid traffic
congestion. <BR>
<BR>
A second phase of the system would extend 26 miles of track to other heavily
used areas in the county.</BLOCKQUOTE>

safety of proposed Alachua cement plant</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The American Lung Association
has raised several concerns about emissions from a proposed cement plant
in western Alachua County, in a letter written to a group of citizens that
oppose the plant.<BR>
<BR>
Florida Rock Industries has received approval from the Florida Department
of Environmental Protection, and the Environmental Protection Agency to
build the cement plant near Newberry, about 10 miles west of Gainesville.
Assurances from company executives that the plant would use state-of-the-art
pollution controls has not swayed local community opposition, however, and
the company's permit's are being challenged in court.<BR>
<BR>
The American Lung Association's letter challenges the company's claim that
adequate pollution controls will be used:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What is clear to us is that Florida Rock is not proposing to install
the most efficient emission controls for particulate matter on their kiln
stack.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The letter cites a Fairborn, Ohio cement plant with emission controls that
&quot;would be approximately 5-10 times&quot; more efficient than the type
proposed for the Florida Rock plant. In addition the ALA expressed concern
over mercury and hydrogen sulfide emissions resulting from the use of high-sulfur
coal at the plant, and wrote that controls for the use of tires as a fuel
would not prevent emissions of other toxic chemicals. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The primary concern of the Association is for the effect of air pollution
from such a plant on the health of area citizens and the community. In particular,
the Association is concerned about the potential effects of cement plant
emissions on individuals in the community with pre-existing respiratory
diseases, such as asthma, chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary
diseases.&quot; The letter was signed by ALA of Florida executive director
Sandra Kessler.<BR>
<BR>
A recommendation to the DEP is pending from a hearing officer to deny, modify,
or issue the air emissions permit for the plant. The Haile Community Association
is also filing an appeal of the plant's land use permit.</BLOCKQUOTE>

set to pass biggest tanks bill ever</STRONG> </A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- by Dave Newport -- Rising from
the ashes of last year's failed underground tanks cleanup legislation is
the biggest tanks bill Florida's ever seen. But an article in the April
issue of Florida Environments magazine asks if that bill sets up environmental
contractors-and the taxpayer-for a big fall. <BR>
<BR>
The state is already spending $160 million a year of taxpayers' money in
an effort to clean up more than 13,000 private sites polluted by petroleum
from leaking underground storage tanks. The measure working its way through
the Legislature would provide &quot;amnesty&quot; for another 4-5,000 sites-at
a cost of at least $250,000 each - and add another $1-billion debit to the
taxpayers' tab. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's a very, very scary figure,&quot; says assistant Statewide Prosecutor
Jim Schneider. His office was instrumental in exposing abuses in the old
cleanup program and he has actively participated in the new bill's development.
&quot;We are very concerned about PCAP [amnesty] because so much money will
be dedicated down the road.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In addition, because lawmakers have already overspent state cleanup funds,
the state still owes $350 million for old cleanups. The new bill would finance
that debt, write a check for the state's accounts payable, and sign the
taxpayers' name on a promise to pay a $63-95 million in finance charges
over six to nine years. <BR>
<BR>
That gives some cleanup experts the jitters. &quot;We have formally expressed
our concerns that this bill adds too much to the state's financial responsibility,&quot;
says Dade County's tanks cleanup administrator Wilbur Mayorga. <BR>
<BR>
Oil companies and oil marketers-who receive most of the state cleanup dollars-contend
that the small, independent business people are broke and could not pony
up the big bucks needed to remove fuel from Florida's soils and groundwater.
&quot;Mom &amp; Pops&quot; have been left out of state cleanup programs
for one innocent reason or another and need a new amnesty program, says
oil industry lobbyist Dave Mica. &quot;But I'm not going to say that there
won't be any [Big] Oil company sites included&quot; in the new amnesty program,
Mica admits. <BR>
<BR>
Florida Petroleum Marketers Association executive director Alan Whidby did
not return Florida Environments' phone call request for comment on this
story. <BR>
<BR>
So while the stage is set for a massive new cleanup effort, some key observers
call this a &quot;pay the polluter bill&quot; that will do nothing to deter
even more pollution. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's the latest bailout in a series of bailouts dating back to 1987,&quot;
says Chris Bird, Alachua County's environmental program director. &quot;The
difference is that now the program's mission is to facilitate property transactions
or change land uses or build a shopping center. The environment comes second.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The bill moving down the tracks is Senate Bill 648, originally filed by
Sen. Rick Dantzler, Chairman of the Senate Natural Resources Committee.
It was intended to be a shell bill to which everybody's language could be
added. <BR>
<BR>
Dantzler let the lobbyists write the law. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;If [what they write is] not bad public policy, then why not,&quot;
he told Florida Environments. &quot;It gets the program started again.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, environmental contractors have been decimated by last year's crash
of the fund that pays for the work-and by lawmakers failed efforts to reform
the program. A reinvigorated program will help ailing companies and get
environmental protection efforts back on track, contractors hope. <BR>
<BR>
Local government officials agree. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are all suffering because we need to get cleanups moving-many contaminated
sites are within our wellfield areas,&quot; says Dade County's Mayorga.
&quot;In Dade County alone we have about 100 such sites. We must find a
way to deal with the high priority sites quickly.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Proponents say the bill would free up $70-100 million a year that was paying
down debt and channel it instead into desperately needed new work. <BR>
<BR>
The issue that killed last year's tanks bill is also alive and well. Risk
Based Corrective Action (RBCA), or Rebecca, is a triage-like practice aimed
at stretching state dollars by cleaning up the worst sites first. Sites
are evaluated and graded on the basis of potential harm to humans and the
environment. Less risky sites are left for cleanup later. <BR>
<BR>
The sticky part is determining a tolerable risk of getting cancer from ingesting
polluted water. Last year's bill crashed when Oil interests tried to increase
the acceptable human health risk from one-in-a-million to one-in-a-hundred
thousand chances. Environmental officials dug in their heels and the bill
failed. <BR>
<BR>
But the bill is no bed of roses. Mayorga and others worry that by letting
in another 4-5,000 amnesty sites, the state fund will soon go broke again,
leaving contractors and counties in the lurch. He also wonders if the amnesty
will be limited to only 4-5,000 sites. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;In the past we have failed badly to predict the numbers of sites that
will be involved,&quot; Mayorga contends. Indeed, 1987 state figures estimated
only 1-2,000 sites needed cleanup attention. And, &quot;as always, the major
oil companies will make a serious effort to get their sites qualified for
any new program.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
State officials also worry that another program set up by the new bill will
&quot;put a foot in the door&quot; leading to a return to the overload seen
in the program's failed past. <BR>
<BR>
The voluntary program &quot;seems perfectly reasonable now,&quot; says the
state's top tanks program administrator Doug Jones of the Department of
Environmental Protection. But, &quot;it's $10 million this year, maybe $20
million next year, and so forth.&quot; Jones feels that such &quot;mission
creep&quot; is not a new concept in this program. <BR>
<BR>
Some interests may be holding their noses while others stifle a grin, but
on balance,&quot;I don't think anybody loves this bill - nobody wants to
kiss it - but they can live with it,&quot; says Schneider. &quot;If it passes
as written today [late March], the state will have a lot more oversight
than before.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
And it's precisely that oversight that worries the state. <BR>
<BR>
The logistics of implementing this bill &quot;are a nightmare,&quot; worries
Jones. &quot;Every stakeholder thinks they've got the one thing they need
from this bill, but we've got to do it - and it's a lot of new work.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Alachua County's environmental program director Chris Bird questions the
equity of committing taxpayers' money to &quot;finance somebody's property
development. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's a bailout-one that allows the marketers to grandfather in all
those leaky systems they would have had to replace by 1998,&quot; says Bird.
&quot;There is no enforcement, no incentive to be in compliance. Why prevent
a leak when you can get the state to pay for cleaning it up?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The bill's author bristles at the suggestion. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The bill was not intended to be a bailout,&quot; Sen. Dantzler said.
&quot;It is a good balance between corporate responsibility and environmental
protection. It passed my committee unanimously without any criticism from
interest groups. To come forward now with concerns is unfair.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
As for the bill being a pay-the-polluter bailout, Big Oil's Dave Mica is
unrepentant. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The state in 1987 made the commitment [to pay for cleanups], now they're
in,&quot; Mica said. &quot;You can't pull out halfway. You can't be halfway
pregnant. Now it is critical for the state of Florida to address the cleanups
of as many sites as possible as quickly as possible.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Jones is facing that reality. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;You can't deny that this is not a new bailout,&quot; he says. &quot;But
it also takes a program that had lost its way and refocuses it and makes
it stay within a budget.&quot;<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- On Wednesday, senators approved
a bill that would streamline government rules and limit the power of bureaucrats,
the St. Petersburg Times reported. <BR>
<BR>
The new measure would pass a section of the law that tells state agencies
how to make rules and implement them. These proposed changes could affect
everything from environmental regulations to collection of state revenues.
<BR>
<BR>
The bill was drafted with help from a commission appointed by Chiles. Donna
Blanton, a Tallahassee lawyer who served as executive director of the commission,
told the Times the governor &quot;has said he supports the legislation.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The new proposal would do several things, according to the Times. First,
it would shift the burden of proof from private businesses and citizens
to the government when a rule is challenged. Second, it would force the
state, in some cases, to pay legal fees of those who challenge a rule and
win. Finally, agencies would have to provide a detailed estimate on how
much proposed rules could cost businesses, in addition to its effects on
small counties and cities. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>BROOKSVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Unseasonably cooler weather
and rains have spread throughout Florida the past month and water managers
in the Tampa region are thrilled, the St. Petersburg Times reported. <BR>
<BR>
In the first three months of 1996, the region received 30 percent of the
total rainfall normally seen in a year. Increased rainfall averages in Pinellas,
Pasco, Hillsborough, Hernando and Citrus counties were specifically noted.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The largest rainfall totals from March, 10 inches, fell over the Green
Swamp and the northern Withlacoochie River basin,&quot; Gary Florence, data
research director at the Southwest Florida Water Management District, told
the Times. &quot;That's critical because these are particularly high recharge
areas&quot; for the Floridian Aquifer, from which most of the region's drinking
water is drawn. <BR>
<BR>
In addition to the added rainfall, the cooler weather has slowed evaporation
and plant absorption of the water, giving more of it a chance to soak into
the ground. According to the Times, though the increase in rainfall has
helped area water levels, water restrictions will still be enforced. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We have to plan as if the rain is going to stop tomorrow,&quot; Florence
said. </BLOCKQUOTE>

a nuisance to residents </STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>PALM HARBOR -- (EnviroWorld) -- A long-term, multimillion-dollar
county program to revamp the way sewage is treated in Pinellas County, has
left residents very upset, contending that the county's decision has eroded
their property values and made their lives difficult, the St. Petersburg
Times reported. <BR>
<BR>
The county is rerouting satellite sewage plants throughout East Lake and
Palm Harbor to one big plant off Alt. 19 north of Bee Pond Road. According
to the Times, the facility is being expanded and improved so that all of
the sewage from the north end of Pinellas can be turned into reclaimed water,
which is suitable for lawn watering. However, the pipes through which 1.8
gallons of sewage per day are pumped, pass through Highland Lakes, a residential
community, where a lift station was created . <BR>
<BR>
Previously, this sewage lift station emitted a noxious stench. Residents
were able to persuade the county to spend about $80,000 to install filters
and fans that have killed the smell. But now the whining sound produced
by the filters and fans is driving homeowners crazy. <BR>
<BR>
Homeowners have requested that the station be moved, but that could cost
up to $700,000, which would have to be paid for by county sewer customers.
In addition, moving the station would simply mean placing it in another
inconvenient spot. Anywhere the station is moved it could affect other residents
and a nearby wetland, the Times reported. </BLOCKQUOTE>

Commission could be laid to rest in November, after the Volusia County Charter
Review Commission agreed to give the public a chance to vote whether to
disband the Beach Trust, the Orlando Sentinel reported. <BR>
<BR>
The Beach Trust was created 10 years ago by voters to help address beach
issues when the county assumed regulatory control over the beaches from
coastal cities. The trust includes one representative from each east Volusia
city and from county government to advise the county council on beach management.<BR>
<BR>
According to the Sentinel, however, critics have accused Beach Trust members
of representing only their cities' interests and therefore the advisory
board isn't effective.<BR>

soon will be heading for a new home, the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
After learning that a group of five sea lions were sentenced to death by
the Commerce Department's National Marine Fisheries Service for adding to
the demise of steelhead trout, a rapidly disappearing member of the salmon
family, Sea World of Florida agreed to bring the animals into the park.
According to the Sentinel, it will cost Sea World $25,000 to fly the sea
lions over, who will live with about 50 other sea lions at the park's Pacific
Point Preserve.<BR>
<BR>
The animals, all males, still must be captured. Once they are taken into
custody, they will be temporarily held at a Tacoma, Wash., aquarium until
they are flown to Florida.<BR>
<BR>
Brian Gorman, spokesman for the fisheries service told the Sentinel the
sea lions are no longer welcome near the fish runs at Seattle's Ballard
Locks because they have helped the steelhead population plummet from 1,800
in the early 1980s, to 126 last year.</BLOCKQUOTE>

may be denied </STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>PORT RICHEY -- (EnviroWorld) -- Pasco officials applied for
two permits for 850,000-gallon well fields in central Pasco because they
say it is necessary to keep up with the growth of the Interstate 75 corridor,
the St. Petersburg Times reported. However, the Southwest Florida Water
Management District (Swiftmud) told Pasco leaders that it probably would
not allow the well fields at those pumping levels.<BR>
<BR>
Swiftmud told the Times the wells are too close to the Cypress Creek and
Cross Bar well fields that provide an average of 50-million gallons of water
each day to Pinellas residents. Because pumping has already stressed the
environment in the area, the district says it doesn't want to compound the
damage by approving more permits.<BR>
<BR>
County Administrator John Gallager told the Times that if Pasco cannot obtain
permits for the two wells closer the Cross Bar and Cypress, then the county
may be forced to spend up to $2 million to pipe water from four wells planned
to be built along State Road 54, east of I-75, to meet development needs.</BLOCKQUOTE>

in Inglis</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>INGLIS --(EnviroWorld)-- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
authorized a $2.7 million Superfund cleanup of lead- and arsenic- contaminated
soil in Inglis, a small Withlacoochee River town, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
The contamination resulted from byproducts of the Barker Chemical Co. plant,
which operated from 1904 to 1931. The company manufactured a product called
&quot;superphosphate.&quot; The arsenic in the soil is a byproduct of burning
sulfides, and the lead comes from lead-lined chambers dissolved out by sulfuric
acid used in the manufacturing process.<BR>
<BR>
In the area, the EPA found 13 &quot;hot spots,&quot; houses or vacant lots
where contamination is above acceptable levels. More than 12,000 cubic yards
of soil will have to be removed over a three- to six-month period. The cleanup
will begin the week of April 15. The project will include replacing the
soil and re-landscaping the area.<BR>
<BR>
None of the 27 residents of the contaminated area had higher-than-normal
levels of arsenic or lead, said Roger Inman, director of environmental toxicology
for the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. </BLOCKQUOTE>

Construction projects must be secured, as well as signs and awnings. Strict
building codes are enforced to make sure the attractions don't flying apart
and become dangerous. But the hardest thing is getting the people out. Most

report says</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE --(EnviroWorld)-- A report by the Office of Program
Policy Analysis and Governmental Accountability says that counties have
successfully set up recycling programs with a state grant, and now the grant
should be cut off, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
The report said the state could save $22.7 million by cutting the grant,
which was started in 1988 when the Legislature enacted a law requiring counties
with more than 50,000 people to recycle at least 30 percent of their solid
waste by the end of 1994. Smaller counties only had to offer the program
to residents.<BR>
<BR>
The grant was intended as seed money to help the counties reach the goal,
which has already been accomplished,the report says.<BR>
<BR>
But cutting off the grant would hurt recycling in small counties, Department
of Environmental Protection Secretary Virginia Wetherell said, making it
difficult for them to continue the program. The smaller counties' recycling
programs are run almost completely with money from the fund, while the state
money makes up only a portion of larger counties' programs.<BR>
<BR>
Gov. Lawton Chiles said he supports continuing the funding.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON --(EnviroWorld)-- President Clinton reluctantly signed
the farm bill that ends the link between crop-prices and government subsidies
which has existed since the Great Depression, the Associated Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
The law ends guaranteed prices for corn, other feed grains, cotton, rice
and wheat. Instead, farmers will get guaranteed payments that decline over
seven years and an immediate end to most planting restrictions. The payments
total $36 billion over seven years and account for most of the spending
in the $47 billion law.<BR>
<BR>
Clinton said that the law &quot;fails to provide an adequate safety net
for family farmers.&quot; He also said he would propose legislation next
year to restore the safety net.<BR>
<BR>
The bill also included money for conservation and environmental protection
and for rural development and research. <BR>
<BR>
The law affects dairy farmers, too. It ends a special tax on dairy producers
and phases out government support for butter, powdered milk and cheese over
four years.</BLOCKQUOTE>

would give Florida more flexibility</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON --(EnviroWorld)-- Florida was chosen as one of ten
states that will create State Infrastructure Banks that would make loans
to states for transportation projects, the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
The new financing system wouldn't bring in any new federal money, but it
would give the states more flexible use of federal, state and private money.
<BR>
<BR>
Once the banks are established, Florida will have to decide which projects
get the loans first. Transportation officials said that the &quot;missing
link&quot; in the Orlando beltway, the final six miles of the eastern part
of the Greeneway, has been mentioned. Another project mentioned is to build
portions of the western half of the beltway.<BR>
<BR>
Florida may use up to 10 percent of its federal transportation aid to start
one of the new banks. When loans are repaid, the banks can use the money
to finance other transportation projects.</BLOCKQUOTE>

weakening' of statute</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- Erik Olson, a Natural Resources
Defense Council attorney, said NRDC is &quot;shocked&quot; by the latest
draft Republican bill to reauthorize the Safe Drinking Water Act. The bill
is &quot;even less protective&quot; than a previous reauthorization bill
passed by the Senate in 1995. <BR>
<BR>
The bill would require cost-benefit analysis of drinking water contaminant
standards, and would require waivers for health standards upon request by
drinking water systems serving fewer than 10,000 people. The bill would
establish industry-based peer- review panels charged with approving the
science underlying drinking water regulations. <BR>
<BR>
Al Warburton, of the American Water Works Association, said, &quot;I think
some of these criticisms from environmental groups on peer review and health
and cost considerations in setting standards result from a misunderstanding
of the language in the draft. The House bill is no different from the administration's
position.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CLEARWATER-- (EnviroWorld) -- A proposed downtown lake in Clearwater
would require the demolition of several buildings and may require hazardous
waste cleanups, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
The 36-acre area, bounded by Myrtle Avenue, Park Street, Greenwood Avenue
and Court Street, contains auto repair shops, an old printing plant and
a drainage pond. Tom Miller, Clearwater's environmental manager, told the
Times that as many as two dozen sites could require cleanup. The pollutants
are most likely to be chlorinated solvents and petroleum products, and the
costs are expected to run several million dollars.<BR>
<BR>
Economic development director Alan Ferri said the industrial area had become
economically stagnant because of the high cost of environmental cleanups
that property buyers would incur.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TARPON SPRINGS -- (EnviroWorld)-- Pinellas County has signed
a contract to buy seven small islands on the Anclote River, east of Alt.
U.S. 19, the St. Petersburg Times reported. The 48.2 acres of land will
cost the county $10,600, which is roughly the amount of back taxes owed
the property.<BR>
<BR>
The islands are owned by the family of developer George A. Hunt, Jr. and
were designated for preservation already. County officials told the Times
that little would be done to the islands.<BR>

2000 money raises criticism</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE-- (EnviroWorld) -- Spending proposals on a state
Senate bill would pull money designated for land acquisition and spend it
on uses such as urban parks and beach renourishment, a move that has angered
some environmental groups, the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They're trying to put us in a position of conservation lands vs. recreational
lands,&quot; Nature Conservancy lobbyist Debbie Drake told the Sentinel.
&quot;Granted, they may not have swing sets or ball fields or whatever,
but they're all recreational lands.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The money that environmentalists accuse legislators of dipping their fingers
into would come out of several small land-buying programs under the Preservation
2000 umbrella. Those programs, which receive $60 million all together, are
up for renewal this year and are ripe for legislative tinkering.<BR>
<BR>
Sen. Robert Harden, R- Fort Walton Beach, proposed an amendment that would
divert $18 million for beaches and weed removal projects. He told the Sentinel
that &quot;a number of factors ... justify using those funds&quot; and that
the proposed changes simply put more emphasis on preservation. <BR>
<BR>
Another amendment by Sen. Charles Bronson, R-Satellite Beach directs $6.7
million of P-2000 funds toward park-building. In a St. Petersburg Times
story, Bronson criticized P-2000 for taking too much land off of property
tax rolls.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Considering there will be little if any taxes paid on P-2000 lands,
the burden to pay for infrastructure needs like schools will be thrown back
on those private citizens and businesses who do own land,&quot; Bronson
told the Times.<BR>
<BR>
But Charles Lee, senior vice president of the Florida Audubon Society, said
that legislators viewed the money as a &quot;turkey pot&quot; to fund pet
projects.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Those of us who are supportive of land acquisition don't like the
bill with all the junk that's being hung on it,&quot; Lee told the Sentinel.<BR>
<BR>
The Preservation 2000 program was enacted as a way to quickly acquire environmentally
sensitive land during the 1990's before the price of such land rose too
high, or was developed. When the program expires in 2000, it is expected
to have spent $3 billion.<BR>
<BR>
The Harden amendment is part of Senate Bill 770, which will probably be
considered Wednesday by the Senate Natural Resources Committee.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE --(EnviroWorld) -- In a April 5 letter to Sen. Bob
Dole, Gov. Lawton Chiles asked the majority leader for help on two issues
important for Everglades restoration and protection.<BR>
<BR>
The first concerns &quot;one of the many anti-environmental policy riders&quot;
on the Omnibus Appropriations bill. That rider would eliminate Environmental
Protection Agency authority under the Clean Water Act to override wetland
fill permits. Chiles points out that the EPA's power there was last used
in 1988 to save 432 acres in the Everglades, and asks Dole to work to &quot;ensure
that the rider is dropped.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It strikes me that one cannot by 'anti-wetland' and 'pro-Everglades'
at the same time,&quot; Chiles writes.<BR>
<BR>
Chiles also asks for Dole's support in enacting the Clinton Administration's
Everglades restoration plan, saying that the $200 million approved by Congress
so far &quot;is a good step-- but it is certainly not the last step.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON --(EnviroWorld)-- The new freedom-to-farm law allows
farmers to select what they grow on their land, but also phases out government
subsidies, leaving farmers wary of risks that come with leaving profits
up to the market, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Now the risk is going to be back on the farmers,&quot; said Bruce
Brown, who runs a 5,000-acre farm in Louisiana with his family.<BR>
<BR>
Analysts have predicted that leaving crop prices up to the market will result
in greater price swings at the grocery store as well. The supply of certain
crops will vary as farmers respond to market trends, not what the government
dictates.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>LAKELAND --(EnviroWorld)-- With the U.S. Department of Agriculture
expected to announce new standards that will clear up what can be defined
as &quot;organic&quot; and labeling products as such becoming a marketing
edge, organically grown food has become much more popular recently, the
Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Food classified as organic currently differs depending on the government
agency that you deal with, although the new USDA standards should remedy
that. To label produce as certified organic, a farm must prove it has used
only approved natural or synthetic nonresidual pesticides on its crops,
in specific amounts at specific times.<BR>
<BR>
According to the Food Market Institute's 1995 study, 25 percent of all shoppers
buy natural or organic food at least once a week, 42 percent of mainstream
stores carry organic produce items and 26 percent of senior management believe
it is important to offer natural products to consumers. That is up from
12 percent in 1992.<BR>
<BR>
Enthusiasts say organics are good for the environment, protect underground
water supplies from pollution and get the industry off the &quot;chemical
treadmill&quot;-- the use of more and different chemicals as insects develop
resistance or altered populations.<BR>
<BR>
Some industry members say that organic farms may experience residue problems
with persistent pesticides such as aldrin, dieldrin, DDT, chlordane and
heptachlor due to historical uses of those chemicals on the land.<BR>
<BR>
Even so, some of the biggest names in the citrus business are going organic,
to some degree or another. The Jack Berry Corp., in Winter Haven, is transferring
hundreds of acres to organic, while Bert Roper in Brooksville is processing
organically grown oranges. Freshco, in Fort Pierce, has started packing
organically grown grapefruit juice for export.<BR>
<BR>
Pat Schirard, vice president of Freshco, said that going organic adds value
to the product in today's market, and it makes economic sense to produce
new products for U.S. and international consumers.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE --(EnviroWorld)-- Hillsborough and Pasco county
residents, who have been crying out for new water laws, are likely to get
left high and dry by the state legislature because of a conflict of interests
between big water users and environmentalists, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
The effort to change water law began last year, when the House Select Committee
on Water Policy set out to rewrite Florida water law. The main goal was
to require local growth plans to account for how much water is available,
making cities and counties grow within their means, or find ways to get
what they need. <BR>
<BR>
But influential water users, such as big farmers, utilities, developers
and local governments, did not like the plan at all. Lobbyists went to work,
and the bill became softer and softer until it no longer had anything in
it about cities and counties accounting for their water use in specific
land-use plans when it went to the committee for vote last month, according
to the Tribune.<BR>
<BR>
But big water users are continuing lobbying efforts to change the bill farther
in their favor. Agricultural lobbyists have drafted measures to expand their
clients water rights, making it easier for those who have water permits
now to get renewals before new people.<BR>
<BR>
Environmentalists say this will cause a goldrush on water permits until
all available water is gone, which contradicts the policy of water as a
public resource.<BR>
<BR>
Lt. Gov. Buddy McKay said that the governor will not pass any water bill
that weakens protection of water resources, and big water users will try
to stop anything that threatens their water rights.<BR>
<BR>
Lost in all this squabbling is the Tampa Bay area problem. The residents
of Pasco and Hillsborough counties claim that pumping water to Pinellas
is drying up their lakes and wetlands. But the bickering among competing
water interests most likely will result in no change in the existing situation,
the Tribune said.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>NORTH REDINGTON BEACH -- (EnviroWorld) -- With the help of a
planning consultant, North Redington Beach may be able to strike a deal
that makes developers and residents happy, the St. Petersburg Times reported.
<BR>
<BR>
Professional planner David Taylor of Hanson, Taylor, Bellomo and Herbert
in Tampa was hired by the community to propose development standards with
more savvy. Currently, the town has a height limit of 60 feet on buildings,
but little else to minimize the impact of tall buildings. <BR>
<BR>
Taylor has suggested the height limit be raised from 60 feet to 80 feet
in return for public benefits such as more green space and beach access.
In addition, he has askedthat the town code address roof lines, require
buildings to be constructed at graduated heights and mandate buffers along
Gulf Boulevard - all standards that do not currently exist in the town code.
Taylor also proposed increasing the minimum lot size, setbacks and parking
space requirements for 40-foot- to 80-foot-tall buildings.<BR>
<BR>
The proposals come in the wake of a developer's request to build a 135-foot
tall condominium. After a resident petition opposing the building, the developer,
EcoGroup, Inc., lowered the height to 80 feet, and the commission hired
Taylor to advise the town.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We're saying we think eight stories can work in places, but you have
to work up to eight stories through setbacks between your buildings and
more open space around it,&quot; he told the Times.<BR>
<BR>
Taylor will meet with town commissioners during workshops on April 16 and
April 23. The workshops are open to the public.</BLOCKQUOTE>

mystery</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG -- (EnviroWorld) -- Florida is drawing national
attention as the manatee death toll hit an all-time record 210 deaths this
weekend -- 120 since March 5 -- and researchers are pulling all the stops
to find an answer.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The sad thing is that even if we can find out what this is, chances
are, we won't be able to solve it,&quot; said DEP chief marine mammal pathobiologist
Scott Wright. &quot;The reality is, whatever this is -- we may not be able
to cure it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The researchers have now been joined by the Center for Disease Control in
Atlanta. Sea World biologists are sending blood samples to the CDC, which
is also interested in studying how diseases spread within an animal population.
The National Marine Fisheries Service is also sending in a specialist in
forensic contaminates to test local waters and blood samples for unnatural
toxins. <BR>
<BR>
About a dozen institutions are working on the epidemic, and they have not
found any evidence of red tide toxins in manatee blood, or digestive tracts.
Liver and brain tissue is currently being analyzed, and scientists are looking
for causes ranging from bacteria and viruses to pesticides to explain the
animals' purple lesions, and fluid filled lungs.<BR>
<BR>
Some researchers believe the culprit may be a previously unknown type of
red-tide toxin. Friday, workers rescued a manatee off the coast of Englewood,
the first time during the epidemic that a sick animal has been found alive.
The animal was disoriented and having trouble swimming-- classic signs of
red-tide. That disease is caused by a particular species of tiny marine
animal called a dinoflagellate which produces the poison, and whose population
explodes under certain conditions. The Tampa Tribune reported that the sick
manatee was taken to Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa and that no links had yet been
established between it and the widespread deaths. <BR>
<BR>
The mysterious deaths have all occurred along the coast of Southwest Florida
from Englewood to Marco Island. The majority of manatees affected have been
adults.<BR>
<BR>
No evidence has been found that the epidemic is related to deaths of other
marine creatures and birds. Although higher numbers of dead sea turtles
are being recovered, the causes of death have been typical -- cold stress
and tumors, for example. While the number of dolphin deaths is higher than
normal for this time of year, some are washing in from far off-shore and
all have been severely decomposed, making signs of any disease difficult
to identify. Unlike the manatees, scientists believe that the deaths of
cormorants and other sea birds can be attributed to red-tide.<BR>
<BR>
Citizens who spot dead manatees are urged to call 1-800-Dial-FMP or *FMP
on a cell phone. The majority of fresh carcasses are being recovered because
citizens are reporting them.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CROSS CITY --(EnviroWorld) -- Cross City Correctional Institution,
along with other prisons, have begun using inmate-run gardens and fish-ponds
to provide food, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
The Cross City prisoners have converted an old borrow pit into a catfish
pond with the help of some heavy equipment from Dixie County. By the end
of summer they hope to have their first fish harvest after an investment
of less than $5,000.<BR>
<BR>
In 1995, inmates were able to supply all their own tomatoes and harvested
six tons of cucumbers -- enough to share with five other area prisons. This
year crops of watermelon, potatoes and cantaloupe are also expected.</BLOCKQUOTE>

plan</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>DELAND --(EnviroWorld) -- Ponce Inlet has filed a legal challenge
to Volusia County's proposed beach-driving rules, the Orlando Sentinel reported.
The rules include a complete ban on driving for most of Ponce Inlet and
town leaders argue that violates the county charter mandate that Volusia
beaches be accessible to the public.<BR>
<BR>
Volusia wants to impose the rules in order to get federal approval of its
sea turtle conservation plan -- and avoid losing a lawsuit filed by environmentalists
over the county's lax beach-driving policies. <BR>
<BR>
Last month, Ponce Inlet and Volusia County agreed to a circuit judge's recommendation
that a compromise be found, but those efforts failed. Ponce Inlet's Town
Manager Bob Burns said the county was not willing to amend the plan, which
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is currently reviewing.<BR>
<BR>
The county has been under pressure to enact stricter beach-driving rules
since two New Smyrna Beach residents filed a federal lawsuit contending
that sea-turtles were not adequately protected on the county's beaches.</BLOCKQUOTE>

determining impact fee</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Orlando Utilities Commission
is submitting a proposal to its board today that would change the way it
assesses water service impact fees, the Orlando Sentinel reported. The change
is expected to cost developers hundreds of thousands of dollars, but OUC
managers said it was needed to pay for $59 million in improvements to the
city's water system.<BR>
<BR>
The proposal calls for a five-year conversion from a fee based on the size
of water meters to one based on the capital costs associated with adding
a new home to a water system. Under that plan, the fee for a single-family
house would rise from $425 to $1755 by the year 2001.<BR>
<BR>
A hearing on the proposal is scheduled for 2 p.m. on the second floor of
the OUC's downtown Orlando headquarters.</BLOCKQUOTE>

water projects</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>SAFETY HARBOR -- (EnviroWorld) -- The West Coast Regional Water
Supply Authority has agreed to pay $7.5 million to begin projects that,
in less than 10 years, could produce 85 million gallons of water a day,
The Tampa Tribune reported. However, members could not agree on how to divide
the $290 million it will take to actually complete the work.<BR>
<BR>
One suggestion is to split the cost according to how much each member of
the authority could use, but Hillsborough Commissioner Ed Turanchik opposed
the suggestion, saying Hillsborough has the right to take 28 percent of
the water West Coast can pump, but the county uses less than half that.
Another suggestion says that each county - Pasco, Pinellas, Hillsborough,
Tampa and St. Petersburg - simply split the costs, paying 20 percent each.<BR>
<BR>
The projects include replacing water used by some industries with reclaimed
water and letting some farmers use river water instead of ground water,
according to the Tribune. West Coast's board members still have to approve
Monday's agreement.</BLOCKQUOTE>

for 40 percent </STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- A copy of a surprise settlement
reached Florida fishermen this weekend that would pay about 41 cents on
the dollar for nets the state promised to pay $4.8 million for, the Tampa
Tribune reported. <BR>
<BR>
Last summer, voters had approved a constitutional amendment banning gill-netting
- destroying some fishermen's careers. The state had previously offered
the fishermen vouchers to pay for the nets, but are now refusing to honor
the promise. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;When I owe taxes to the state, I pay 'em,&quot; Apalachicola fishing
fleet owner Buddy Wood told the Tribune. &quot;I gave them my equipment,
they gave me a state voucher saying they owe me [$52,000]. Now they need
to pay me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
According to the Tribune, the settlement would award the fishing families
$2.45 million of the $2.9 million remaining in the Labor Department's fund
to buy back the outlawed gill nets. In addition, lawyers have asked for
18 percent of the settlement - $450,000.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;All that's left in the fund is $2.9 million,&quot; Cindy Tunnicliff,
Tallahassee class-action specialist, told the Tribune. &quot;the Legislature
isn't going to appropriate any more money to buy nets anyway. Better we
get $2.45 million now; that's as good as all $2.9 million in three years.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Many fishermen are in the process of filing objections to the settlement,
the Tribune reported.</BLOCKQUOTE>

industry make tighter restrictions a good idea.<BR>
<BR>
NOx emissions are associated with ozone depletion, regional haze, acid rain,
and fine particulate pollution. <BR>
<BR>
The utility industry, however, is strongly opposed to the proposed emission
limits established by EPA, and is threatening court action if they are not
changed. Specifically, utility groups believe that EPA's original and proposed
NOx emission limits do not meet the requirement under Title IV<BR>
that control technologies be comparable in cost to low-NOx burner technology.<BR>
<BR>
Florida Power &amp; Light is currently trying to get permission to increase
NOx emissions from its Manatee plant as part of a plan to burn the controversial
fuel Orimulsion.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>LARGO -- (EnviroWorld) -- Largo officials discovered two mobile
home parks were allowing untreated sewage to escape from pipes, the St.
Petersburg Times reported. The largest park, named Lincolnshire Mobile Estates,
has 446 lots and had raw sewage flowing from toilets straight to a canal
and borrow pit.<BR>
<BR>
Residents told the Times the problem had existed for two years, but the
park's said the problem was only recent. City officials found that illegal
overflow pipes had been installed at the park in 1970, and a lift-station
that was supposed to pump the park's sewage to city water treatment works
was not functioning. <BR>
<BR>
The park's system had not been inspected for four years. Officials said
the city will require the park to repair the lift station and bring the
system into compliance. </BLOCKQUOTE>

an eye on water legislation</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- With perhaps the most threatened
groundwater supplies in the state, Pasco County has a lot at stake in this
legislative session. That's why Pasco County commissioners have journeyed
to Tallahassee during the Florida League of Counties' annual legislative
day to lobby for legislation to reduce overpumping at water wellfields,
the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Commissioners begin three days of meetings with lawmakers today as the Legislature
continues discussion on proposed water legislation, but Commission Chairman
Ed Collins told the Times that in all the legislative compromise among regions
with competing interests, Pasco County could lose out. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We want to get a fix on what's happening up there,&quot; he said.
&quot;It's getting close to crunch time. I'm beginning to get pessimistic
about the chances of getting good legislation.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In fact, Collins echoed an opinion that has begun to ring louder in the
legislative session's second half: with so much at stake in the water bills,
nothing may be passed at all. <BR>
<BR>
The commissioners would like to see mandates for the establishment of minimum
flows and levels, something that would provide a solid regulatory basis
to prevent overpumping. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG -- (EnviroWorld) -- An ambitious plan for a $35
million biking and pedestrian trail in Pinellas County has been abandoned,
the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
The plan, proposed by County Administrator Fred Marquis, called for a network
of paths that would blanket the county and be paid for out of the county's
one-cent &quot;Penny for Pinellas&quot; tax.<BR>
<BR>
But that tax would have to be renewed and officials believe that citizens
won't support it without commitments to more significant infrastructure
improvements. In addition, citizens have frequently opposed trail segments
that were proposed in their neighborhoods.<BR>
<BR>
Marquis is still proposing a network of feeder paths serving the existing
trail, but the &quot;loop&quot; concept - which took the trail along the
Bayside Bridge and down Interstate 275 - is out,<BR>
he said. That should cut a big chunk of the cost. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE --(EnviroWorld)-- A measure intended to encourage
businesses to do environmental self audits was tabled by its sponsor, Rep.
Kelly Smith, (D-Palatka), effectively killing the bill for this session,
the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
The proposal would encourage companies to monitor their own activities and
protect them from disclosure of what they find and from being punished.<BR>
<BR>
Opponents argue that the proposal would let businesses hide environmental
problems to avoid bad publicity and responsibility for illegal acts.<BR>
<BR>
Self-audit legislation has been passed in 18 states since 1993. Florida
lawmakers had been skeptical of giving special treatment to businesses that
perform self audits until this year, when intense lobbying by a coalition
of major industries seemed to cause a change of mood. The bill advanced
farther than many critics thought it would.<BR>
<BR>
All sides agree that companies should take responsibility to audit themselves
to make sure they are complying with pollution rules and minimizing waste.
The debate revolves around what happens with that information.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Wallis Clark said that sturgeon could replace all farm-raised fish because
of their boneless white flesh and caviar, which are both in high demand
these days. To study how the sturgeon will grow and reproduce in an aquaculture
setting, Clark and his associates have released 200 captive-bred sturgeon
into ponds on a North Florida farm.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG --(EnviroWorld)-- A judged ruled that James &quot;Bobby&quot;
Martin and family owes KBH Construction Co. for a court ordered toxic waste
hunt that bankrupted the family and found almost no toxic waste, the Tampa
Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Martin could have to pay as much as $700,000. Pinellas Circuit Judge Fred
L. Bryson ruled there was no evidence that KBH cheated the Martins during
the excavation that lasted more than three years.<BR>
<BR>
The story is a long and winding tale of what Hillsborough environmental
officials and commissioners have called a &quot;tragic flaw of justice.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Martin was originally ordered by Bryson to excavate his landfill to find
toxic waste that Pinellas County said was poisoning a nearby wellfield.
When Martin came back without any toxic waste, Bryson threw him in jail
on contempt of court charges and appointed KBH to the job. KBH dug up tons
of dirt and found only a 5-gallon bucket partially filled with a chemical
sealant. To pay for its work, Bryson allowed KBH to sell Martin's dirt.
The company got $1.47 million in dirt sales, but said it lost more than
$700,000 on the project. Martin's attorney's called it a &quot;sham&quot;
company that inflated its costs to keep selling Martin's dirt.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The change will raisecosts by $228,000, eliminate 650 feet of paving, and require 1,900 feetof additional boardwalks.<BR><BR>The change was made by two city commissioners acting as the city's PublicWorks Committee.

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Florida Engineering Society is
sponsoring a new seminar on alternative water supply, June 12-13 in Tampa.
<BR>
<BR>
The first day of the seminar will focus on state-wide water policy, water
district concerns and initiatives, legal issues, and updates on new 1996
water regulatory legislation. Department of Environmental Protection, Department
of Agriculture and water district officials will speak.<BR>
<BR>
On the second day, the focus will be more technical. Experts on the topics
of aquifer storage and recovery, water reuse, membrane treatment, concentrate
disposal and conservation will present the latest &quot;cutting-edge&quot;
information.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- The reauthorization of even a
single federal environmental law in the 104th congress now looks doubtful
as the candidate law which held the most promise, the Safe Drinking Water
Act, languishes in the House of Representatives. While Superfund, the Clean
Water Act and the Endangered Species Act are nominally alive, reauthorization
of any of these laws appears highly unlikely at this time.<BR>
<BR>
Last month, Congress successfully moved limited reform legislation applicable
to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The legislation would exempt
small landfills from certain EPA regulatory requirements relating to groundwater
monitoring and other regulations. <BR>
<BR>
Related legislation would authorize targeted reforms to the RCRA Corrective
Action Program. However, these limited reforms only scratch the surface
of much needed reforms to the RCRA program. In addition, interstate waste/flow
control legislation appears dead in the House after passing the Senate late
last year.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- Pollution laws against acid rain
have become relaxed, but in the journal Science, researcher Gene Likens
suggests tightening the laws to allow the soil to recover, the Gainesville
Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
The depletion of calcium and magnesium from the soil &quot;means that any
further acid rain falling on the system is going to be potentially serious,
because the system has lost its buffering capacity,&quot; Likens told the
Sun. &quot;The bottom line is, we don't think that the 1990 amendments (to
the Clean Air Act) are going to be adequate to protect these kinds of systems.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CARROLLWOOD -- (EnviroWorld) -- Carrollwood residents and developer
Bob Gomez are still fighting over the development of a new Taco Bell, the
St. Petersburg Times reported. <BR>
<BR>
Hillsborough County Commissioners have delayed a vote until April 23 on
whether to allow Gomez to begin construction of Taco Bell at 11006 N. Dale
Mabry Highway, before he constructs a buffer of office buildings. <BR>
<BR>
The developer wants to begin construction right away, but residents want
a buffer built first, fearing that once the fast food restaurant is finished,
the planned offices will be abandoned, creating heavy traffic in their back
yards, according to the Times. At a meeting Tuesday before county commissioners,
several residents expressed concern that their property values would go
down and congestion and noise will go up if the offices aren't built.<BR>
<BR>
Commissioners have asked Gomez, the property owners and residents to meet
some time soon to work out a compromise.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA --(EnviroWorld)-- A study by an environmental group says
contamination of drinking water was found in areas represented by three
Florida congressmen who could influence legislation that could weaken clean
water rules, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Michael Bilirakis (R-Palm Harbor), Cliff Stearns (R-Ocala), and Peter Deutsch
(D-Lauderhill) are the three Florida congressmen on the House Commerce Committee
that is expected to take up a drinking water bill that would represent &quot;an
extreme rollback of public health protections in current law,&quot; said
Brian Cohen, co-author of the study done by the Environmental Working Group.<BR>
<BR>
The study compiled district drinking water violations in the districts of
the members of the Commerce Committee. According to the study, in Bilirakis'
9th district, 67 of 442 public and private water systems reported contamination
over the past two years. The most common cause of contamination was bacteria
used in indicating the presence of disease-causing organisms.<BR>
<BR>
In Stearns 6th district, 91 of 664 water systems reported contamination,
and in Deutsch's 20th district, 14 of 85 systems reported violations. In
both districts, most of the contamination was due to the same bacteria found
in the 9th district systems.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>LAKELAND --(EnviroWorld)-- Agrifos LLC announced the purchase
of more than 10,000 acres of phosphate land in Central Florida from Mobil
Mining, as well as a processing plant and other assets, the Tampa Tribune
reported.<BR>
<BR>
Agrifos is in the process of creating an international fertilizer company,
said Lewis W. van Amerongen, a member of Agrifos' investor and executive
group.<BR>
<BR>
Florida is the world leader in phosphate rock production, making about 75
percent of the U.S. phosphate supply, and accounting for about 25 percent
of the world supply.<BR>
<BR>
Agrifos plans to operate the mine by offering all the 100 employees the
same jobs and benefits as they have in their current role with Mobil, van
Amerongen said.<BR>
<BR>
Agrifos will process the phosphate rock from the mine at Mobil's fertilizer
plant in Pasadena, Tex., near Houston. They expect to ship the phosphate
across the Gulf of Mexico.</BLOCKQUOTE>

for Everglades restoration</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WEST PALM BEACH --(EnviroWorld)-- The Governing Board of the
South Florida Water Management District approved two land acquisitions yesterday
for protection and restoration of the Everglades ecosystem.<BR>
<BR>
At the northern end of the ecosystem, the board approved the $21 million
purchase of a 36,660-acre parcel considered one of the last great prairies
left in Florida. The Kissimmee Prairie Ecosytem is part of a 48,000-acre
deal negotiated with the Latt Maxey Corp. through the Nature Conservancy.
The land is a mosaic of prarie uplands and wetlands typical of what once
existed throughout much of the Kissimmee River basin.<BR>
<BR>
The District will purchase the land in cooperation with the state using
Conservation and Recreation Lands (CARL) Program, District, and Preservation
2000 funds. The site will become a new state park and should help the economy
of the City of Okeechobee and Okeechobee County, which are developing eco-tourism
programs.<BR>
<BR>
In February, the District purchased an adjacent 11,600 acres from the Maxey
Corp., which includes Kissimmee River floodplain. The land cost nearly $12
million, funded through Save Our Rivers, and the land will be used for Kissimmee
restoration.<BR>
<BR>
Together, the two parcels will enhance the region's natural environment
through restoration of the river and its wetlands.</BLOCKQUOTE>

pesticide distributor in Tampa faces fraud charges</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Tampa-based Marman USA Inc. and
its vice president, Robert T. Renes have been charged with multiple counts
of making, possessing and using a false official seal of the U. S. Environmental
Protection Agency. The company is involved in the international distribution
of pesticides, mainly to Latin American countries. <BR>
<BR>
According to the charges, several countries to which Marman exported pesticides
required certification from the EPA that the pesticides were registered
with them. Renes used forged and counterfeit official seals of the EPA and
falsely certified that the exported pesticides were registered by Marman.
<BR>
<BR>
In a plea agreement filed in federal court, Marman and Renes agreed to plead
guilty to the charges and to pay a total of $500,000 in fines. This prosecution
was the result of an investigation involving the EPA's Criminal Investigation
Division and Office of Inspector General. <BR>
<BR>
The case is one of three major environmental cases in the Middle District
of Florida resulting from the EPA investigation.<BR>
<BR>
In the second criminal case, a federal grand jury indicted Jay Davison Foley,
the Foley Holdings Corp., Ernest Paul Ritz, and the Ritz Construction Corp.,
all of Sarasota, Fla., for illegally removing asbestos from an apartment
complex in 1994. If convicted, the corporations face a maximum penalty of
$500,000 per count. Foley and Ritz each face a maximum penalty on each count
of five years imprisonment, a $250,000 fine, and a three-year term of supervised
release.<BR>
<BR>
In the third case, the firm, Industrial Freighters Corp, owner of the vessel
M/V Istria, will pay the maximum civil penalty for discharging hydraulic
fluid into Hillsborough Bay as the vessel was docking at Port Sutton on
Aug. 7, 1995. Industrial Freighters Corp. has agreed to pay $55,000 in penalties
and reparations and to conduct an internal investigation of the pollution
incident.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Court in Charlotte, N.C., Paul E. Richard was given a 27-month prison sentence
for illegally disposing of hazardous waste without a permit. Richard pleaded
guilty to one-count of violating the Resource Conservation and<BR>

<BR>
An investigation revealed that Richard was paid by his former employer,
Cranford Woodcarving Inc. to arrange for the proper disposal of approximately
18 drums of hazardous waste. However,<BR>
Richard pocketed the money and, without his employer's knowledge, buried
the hazardous waste on Cranford's property. </BLOCKQUOTE>

test reports on woodstove emissions</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>SEATTLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The former owner of a testing laboratory
in Kent, Washington. pleaded guilty April 2 to a Clean Air Act felony charge
that he deliberately falsified test reports on at least 10 different models
of wood stoves to show that they met federal and state air emission standards.
<BR>
<BR>
William A. Nowak entered the plea in U. S. District Court in Seattle. The
charge carries a maximum penalty of two years in prison, a fine of up to
$250,000, or both. Sentencing is set for June 21, 1996.<BR>
<BR>
The offenses occurred between December 1992 and December 1994 when Nowak
owned and managed Energy and Environmental Systems Performance Corp. It
is not known how many woodstoves were sold after prototypes were falsely
certified by Nowak, however the EPA believes it is a small percentage of
the 1.2 million stoves manufactured since the agency began its nation-wide<BR>
certification program in 1988. <BR>
<BR>
Inefficient residential woodstoves are one of the nation's largest sources
of woodsmoke pollution, which contains significant amounts of carbon monoxide,
hydrocarbons, and other pollutants known to contribute to respiratory problems
and to poor atmospheric visibility. Nowak's facility in Kent was one of
only five laboratories around the country accredited by EPA to test wood
stoves. <BR>
<BR>
The EPA may require manufacturers to resubmit the 10 models that Nowak falsely
certified. All retailers and wholesalers could be required to remove any
tags from unsold stoves indicating the stoves meet emission standards. <BR>
<BR>
In his plea agreement, Nowak admitted that he falsified test results on
some models to allow them to be sold in the state of Washington,where wood
stove emission standards are more stringent than those required by EPA.

teeny weenie problem</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) --<STRONG> </STRONG>A new environmental
threat is emerging that stands to rival global warming and the ozone layer
for controversy and research funding, according to the April issue of Florida
Environments.<BR>
<BR>
The issue concerns a class of chemicals called endocrine disruptors. Those
chemicals include many familiar villains, as well as a number of chemicals
that have widespread commercial use and had been assumed safe.<BR>
<BR>
Scientists have discovered a number of cases among wildlife where these
chemicals interfered with the animals' hormone factory, the endocrine system.
In the grossest examples, the endocrine disruptors have caused bizarre sexual
malformations in entire populations. Worrisome for Florida is that several
of these cases have occurred in the state -- pollution in Lake Apopka shrank
the penises of the lake's alligators and created turtles without any gender,
and the chemicals may be partly responsible for the inability of the Florida
panther to reproduce.<BR>
<BR>
While the wildlife examples are often examples of heavy pollution, some
scientists believe that the chemicals may be causing more subtle effects
on animals, including humans, around the planet. Some of the indications
of this are declining human sperm counts documented worldwide, coupled with
increases in breast cancer, testicular cancer, and other genital malformations--
problems that are all linked to hormones.<BR>
<BR>
Since hormones are some of the most powerful chemicals known to exist (they
cause effects at concentrations as low as one part per trillion), the possibility
that man-made chemicals may act like or deactivate endocrine processes has
aroused a storm of controversy. Feeding this is a new book, &quot;Our Stolen
Future&quot; which was released last month. One of the books authors, Theo
Colburn, is a World Wildlife Fund zoologist who has been a leading figure
in organizing the numerous studies relating synthetic chemicals to effects
on the endocrine system. The book implies that, because hormones have such
widespread functions -- affecting our behavior, personality, and emotions
in addition to their effects on our reproductive system -- man-made chemicals
could be causing an overall reduction in the quality of the human race.<BR>
<BR>
But the Environmental Protection Agency is taking the threat seriously.
The agency is reviewing its testing standards, and may make changes to its
toxicology procedures. The National Academy of Sciences is also reviewing
the issue. Meanwhile a number of corporate groups, worried about the possibility
of tightened regulations, are already reacting by attempting to discredit
&quot;Our Stolen Future.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--State environmental officials have
decided to review a controversial decision to allow labs to use the ozone-depleting
chemical freon in an analytical method that detects petroleum contaminants
in soils and water.<BR>
<BR>
Lab owners resisted the approval of the chemical that is now banned from
production in the United States. The analytical method approved by the Florida
Department of Environmental Regulation would result in the release of about
120 liters of Freon 113 per year, according to Jeff Flowers, a lab owner
in Altamonte Springs.<BR>
<BR>
The State says that's a drop in the bucket.<BR>
<BR>
Calling it a &quot;minute quantity,&quot; DEP Division of Waste Management
chief John Ruddell told EnviroWorld Friday that &quot;the assumption is
that all the freon that has been produced will ultimately wind up in the
atmosphere.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The DEP recently reversed a previous decision and opted to allow automobile
mechanics to top off car air conditioners without plugging the system's
leaks. Florida auto mechanics opposed this reversal citing pollution and
economic arguments.<BR>
<BR>
Similarly, lab owners hold that the freon method constitutes a non-essential
release of freon and so is not permissible under EPA rule. Money is also
on their mind. A traditional petroleum detection analysis costs from $75-150.
The freon method is projected to cost $12.50 per sample.<BR>
<BR>
Friday, Ruddell told EnviroWorld he was going to ask his Quality Assurance
staff to review the March 1, 1996, decision to allow the freon method.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(EnviroWorld)-- Officials from the state Game and Fresh Water
Fish Commission, the Department of Environmental Protection and other environmental
groups continue to speak out against the proposed extension of Florida's
Turnpike that would take it through Goethe State in Levy County, the Gainesville
Sun reported. But the groups fear they are not being listened to.<BR>
<BR>
The groups oppose the proposed extension because of environmental damage
that will be caused.<BR>
<BR>
Alternative routes proposed by the DEP were thrown out because they were
not economonically feasible, according to the Department of Transportation.<BR>
<BR>
An alternative route proposed by the game commission is still being considered,
but state officials do not like the route because they would have to buy
land to build it. The alternative route would take the highway south of
the forest.<BR>
<BR>
Bob Henderson, conservation chairman for the Audubon Society, said money
is just an excuse, and the state should be able to do what's necessary to
build the extension without environmental destruction.<BR>
<BR>
Since 1988, state officials have been planning to extend the Turnpike from
Wildwood to Lebanon Station at U.S. 19. The route favored by the DOT would
take seven miles through the middle of Goethe Forest.</BLOCKQUOTE>

questioned</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CAPE CANAVERAL --(EnviroWorld)-- As NASA dropped a surplus space
shuttle booster to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean last week to create
an artificial reef, questions about the good such reefs do were brought
up again, the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
NASA and the Canaveral Port Authority say that the booster will create a
habitat for sea life, better fishing for saltwater anglers and an attraction
for divers.<BR>
<BR>
Others say that it is uncertain whether the booster will become a permanent
home for sea life.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It'll attract some big fish, just because they are attracted to large
things. But that's not going to make a good habitat,&quot; said Anna-Marie
Eklund, a fisheries biologist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.<BR>
<BR>
Since 1987, the state has spent $5 million building artificial reefs. The
ongoing debate centers on whether it helps or harms sea life in the long
run. Experts say that poor reef building attempts, using items like loose
tires, old cars and washing machines, just junk up the seas. Opponents also
contend that the reefs exist only to attract fishermen.<BR>
<BR>
Dan O'Brien, coordinator of the Ponce de Leon Port Authority, says that
the reefs provide economic and environmental benefits. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There's no difference between the God-created reef and the artificial
reef,&quot; he said.<BR>
<BR>
A formal study of the impact is planned for 1999.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(EnviroWorld)-- According to U.S military research, environmental
pollutants may be a cause of endometriosis, a disorder in which cells from
the lining of the uterus migrate to other areas, attach themselves and start
growing, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
A colony of monkeys used by the military to test the effects of radiation
developed endometriosis. Another colony exposed to dioxin developed such
severe cases that two monkeys died.<BR>
<BR>
The theory states that environmental pollutants weaken the immune system
and play a role in the development of the endometriosis. <BR>
<BR>
After cells migrate out of the uterus, they can attach to the ovaries, fallopian
tubes, intestines, the bladder or other surfaces in the abdomen. If not
properly treated, the growths can can infertility, severe pain, and heavy
bleeding.</BLOCKQUOTE>

they will use Metro-Dade County's Metrorail for a portion of their work-related
travel and an electric car for the rest. An estimated 80 to 90 commuters
will participate.<BR>
<BR>
The vehicles, manufactured by U.S. Electricar, will be used throughout the
day and evening and recharged at residences overnight and at specified locations
with charging outlets during the day. Participants will maintain daily driving
logs and complete a questionnaire at the end of the term. The data generated
will help prepare for a larger demonstration program in 1997 that will use
about 500 electric cars, vans and light trucks.<BR>

self-audits laws may violate Clean Air Act</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>SEATTLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Environmental Protection Agency
is concerned that environmental self-audit laws, which are already on the
books in some states and are being considered in Florida, may violate a
requirement of the Clean Air Act, according to the Daily Environmental Report.<BR>
<BR>
Self-audit laws typically provide immunity from prosecution to companies
that find and clean up their own messes. In an April 5 memo, Steven Herman,
Assistant Administrator of EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance,
wrote that such laws could take too much power from states. Because the
Clean Air Act requires that states must be able to enforce the act's requirements,
Herman wrote that the EPA may not allow those states to implement their
clean air programs.<BR>
<BR>
Herman's memo was written to address concerns about an Idaho law. &quot;A
state Title V (of the Clean Air Act) program should not be approved if state
laws provide immunity from civil penalties for repeat violations, violations
of previous court or administrative orders, violations resulting in substantial
economic benefit to the violator,&quot; he wrote.<BR>
<BR>
In Florida, the environmental self-audit law has had slow going in legislative
committees this session, and is not expected to pass.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Brunswick River</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>BRUNSWICK, Ga. -- (EnviroWorld) -- Test results on fish downstream
from a Superfund site on the Brunswick River have caused the Georgia Department
of Natural Resources to urge people not to eat fish from the area, the Florida
Times-Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
Fish in the Brunswick and its tributaries are contaminated with PCB's, mercury
and lead from the now-closed LCP Chemicals-Georgia Inc. plant.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to aquatic animals with high levels of contaminants, water from
a monitoring well west of the LCP site had up to 500 parts per billion of
lead. Drinking water standards are usually 15 parts per billion, according
to the Times-Union. More test wells will be drilled to determine the threat
of that water to people who drink water from the aquifer.<BR>
<BR>
The Georgia DNR advises against eating fish, shrimp and crabs in four zones
extending from the Buffalo River and upper reaches of the Turtle River to
a point where the Brunswick River meets the sound between St. Simons and
Jekyll islands. Harvesting of oysters, mussels and clams is prohibited in
those zones.<BR>
<BR>
The new advisory is an extension of a 1992 warning that covered a mile-long
stretch of the Turtle river.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Jacksonville officials are
considering building an amphitheater on or near Metro Park, and the best
option may be a site with contaminated soil, the Florida Times-Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
Plans to build a children's park at that site, which is west of Metro Park,
were canceled after the soil problem was discovered. The cleanup estimate
of $2 million was too rich for the kids, but a profitable amphitheater could
sway officials.<BR>
<BR>
Those officials are reluctant to redevelop Metro Park itself because an
amphitheater would take up too much riverfront and leave only a small area
for public access. Cellar Door, one of the country's largest concert promoters,
has expressed interest in helping to finance the project, offering up to
$5 million on a price tag that could run as much as $20 million, the Times-Union

supplier's choice in desalination study</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG -- (EnviroWorld) -- A study of desalination to
provide some of Tampa Bay's water needs was delayed due to objections by
Pinellas County, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
The county was not happy with West Coast Regional Water Supply Authority's
choice of engineering consultant. The authority had chosen Parsons Engineering
Science, Inc., a firm which has done other work for the county, to conduct
the study. Pinellas officials were concerned that Parsons could be criticized
as biased if the firm recommended against desalination.<BR>
<BR>
In the past, county officials have criticized desalination as too expensive.
The Southwest Florida Water Management District has countered that the average
user's water bill would only rise by about $4 a month. It was hoped that
an independent study could resolve the argument.<BR>
<BR>
The county's objection is expected to delay the study three to six months.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) --TECO Energy, the parent of Tampa Electric,
announced a 14 percent increase in net income this quarter and credited
high natural gas prices and its new power plant in Guatemala, the St. Petersburg

<BR>
The cold winter increased electricity demand and caused gas prices to double.
That was the biggest contributor to TECO's short-term profits, but in the
long-term, TECO's diversification to international markets may be its meal
ticket.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CLEARWATER -- (EnviroWorld) -- The West Coast Regional Water
Supply Authority is working with the Southwest Florida Water Management
District to avoid litigation over the area's water permits and pumping agreements.
The authority is hoping to speed up the contracting of independent scientists
to help determine environmental damage caused by pumping around wellfields,
the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
The authority's board is looking to develop an agreement that would bind
all parties to use the scientific findings in the decision-making process.
In addition, the board is asking that a lawyer try to put litigation on
hold until scientists can come up with some answers.<BR>
<BR>
Pinellas Commissioner Charles Rainey, however, said that he wants the hearings
and lawsuits to continue during the scientific study. As a result, a list
of expert witnesses for the case is due May 3, and the hearing is set for
some time in July, according to the Tribune.<BR>
<BR>
Public hearings will be held next Monday and April 29 to determine the questions
for the scientific panel. In addition, the water district has set a deadline
to get the framework of the scientific review in place for May 1.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- On Thursday, April 18, the Florida
House of Representatives will address funding for the restoration of the
Ocklawaha River. Representative Mary Brennan will offer an amendment to
the House Budget requesting $2 million for restoration be allocated from
excess funds within a Department of Environmental Protection trust fund.<BR>
<BR>
Governor Lawton Chiles, Attorney General Bob Butterworth, Secretary Wetherell
of DEP, and Florida's environmental community support the amendment.<BR>
<BR>
For the past year, DEP has been moving ahead with restoration permitting
and is now seeking additional funds to allow restoration of the river. Last
week, the same amendment, offered by Brennan, was defeated on a second vote
in the House Appropriations Committee. Brennan openly criticized political
deal-making for causing the defeat of the amendment.<BR>
<BR>
In response to these accusations, Marjorie Carr, president emeritus of Florida
Defenders of the Environment, said, &quot;We understand the realities of
the legislative process. However, the Ocklawaha River and Florida's natural
resources should not be a pawn of this process. These resources belong to

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Department of Environmental
Protection has sold the sixth Preservation 2000 Bond Series to J.P. Morgan
at an interest rate of 5.5247 percent. <BR>
<BR>
The series, adopted by the Legislature in 1990, created a 10-year program
designed to protect Florida's remaining natural resources and prevent destruction
anticipated by the state's rapid population growth.<BR>
<BR>
The P2000 bonds will provide $268.9 million for various state acquisition
programs, with half of the total appropriated for DEP's Conservation and
Recreation Lands Program (CARL).<BR>
<BR>
Criteria for land to be considered for P2000-funded CARL projects include:
a significant portion of the land in the project is in danger of loosing
its natural attributes; evidence that development is likely within the next
12 months; a significant portion of the land serves to protect groundwater
or other valuable natural resources; the project can be purchased at 80
percent of appraised value or less; and a significant portion of the land
serves as habitat for endangered, threatened or rare species.<BR>
<BR>
DEP Secretary Virginia Wetherell praised the program for being responsible
for saving thousands of acres of Florida's environmentally sensitive land.
&quot;This program ensures that future generations will have the chance
to experience Florida's unique beauty and diversity,&quot; said Wetherell.
&quot;My children and their children will be able to appreciate the natural
Florida through these land acquisitions.&quot; </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>
This 20-year plan, estimated to cost nearly $2.7 billion, also includes
a light rail system that would extend from Celebration to Sanford, with
a future rail corridor reserved along the median of I-4 in Volusia, according
to the Sentinel. The plan also calls for an express bus service connecting
Volusia County to metro Orlando.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Public Service Commission
will hear testimony that may show evidence of misconduct by Southern States
Utilities in hearings beginning April 29, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Public Counsel Jack Shreve and Mike Twomey, a lawyer for consumer groups,
had asked the PSC to throw out the utility's request for a rate hike because
of misconduct. The lawyers said evidence shows that Southern States' management
had improper communications and misled its customers about the rate increase.<BR>
<BR>
But instead of dismissing the rate hike case, the commission decided to
consider the misconduct testimony during the hearings, and may consider
fines or other punishment against SSU. The hearings are expected to last
for several months.<BR>
<BR>
SSU officials denied the allegations. &quot;This is a continued abomination
in an effort to get newspaper headlines,&quot; SSU general counsel Brian
Armstrong told the Times.<BR>
<BR>
SSU owns more than 150 water and sewer systems throughout the state.</BLOCKQUOTE>

will soon disappear into cocoons, and then emerge as the white-marked tussock
moth.<BR>
<BR>
Tim Johnson, horticulture agent at the Citrus County Cooperative Extension
Service, said he has received numerous calls about the creature, but that
it poses no threat to trees and is far less toxic than other local caterpillars.
It prefers the taste of oak leaves, and, in turn, is a favorite food of
many birds.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- Studies of certain chemicals
used by soldiers in the Gulf War of 1990-91 show that drugs and pesticides
may work in concert to defeat the body's defense systems and cause devastating
health effects, the Associated Press reported. <BR>
<BR>
While the most recent study, to be published in next month's Journal of
Toxicology and Environmental Health, is most relevant to the thousands of
soldiers suffering from Gulf War Syndrome, it also throws up a caution flag
to consumers.<BR>
<BR>
One of the chemicals is the widely used insect repellent, DEET, which is
found in most popular store bought brands. Another chemical is the common
pesticide permethrin, which is a chemical cousin to many other pesticides
that work by similar means.<BR>
<BR>
The study, the most conclusive to date, was by Mohamed Abou-Donia of Duke
University and found that chickens exposed to various combinations of DEET,
permethrin, and the drug pyridostigmine had diarrhea, shortness of breath,
stumbling and other symptoms. Chickens have nervous systems similar to humans,
and are the preferred animal to model nervous system effects.<BR>
<BR>
Autopsies showed the chickens had inflamed or permanently damaged nervous
system cells.<BR>
<BR>
Abou-Donia's tests then showed the chickens most harmed had less of a natural
cleansing enzyme called plasma butyrylcholinesterase, or BuCHE. This enzyme
normally filter out chemicals like DEET or permethrin before they can get
into the brain. Pyridostigmine, used as an anti-nerve-gas pill by soldiers,
also inhibits BuCHE. <BR>
<BR>
About 4 percent of humans have a genetic deficiency restricting the BuCHE
they produce naturally, and so are at greater risk to chemicals.<BR>
<BR>
Evidence of the effects of the combined chemicals was first found in a Gainesville
US Department of Agriculture laboratory by Dr. James Moss in 1993, however
the USDA did not think the findings were important and discontinued the
research.<BR>
<BR>
Many people use mixes of pesticides and other chemicals in their homes,
however, the government does not require that chemical interactions be tested
before the products are sold.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETE BEACH --(EnviroWorld)-- The St. Pete Beach City Commission
voted to ban people from feeding wild birds in public areas, an issue that
centers around on particular couple's love for feeding pigeons and complaints
by residents about the results, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
John and Lenora Bryant of South Pasadena fed almost 100 pigeons a day. Residents
of Silver Sands Beach &amp; Racquet club complained because those birds
would then continue to hang around and defecate on their property.<BR>
<BR>
Lee Fox, executive director of the Pinellas Seabird Rehabilitation Center,
said that feeding wild birds makes them stop hunting for their own meals
and they can get hurt trying to pry food off fish hooks.<BR>
<BR>
The ordinance comes back to the commission May 7 for final approval.<BR>

to build sewage treatment facility</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WEST PALM BEACH --(EnviroWorld)-- The Governing Board of the
South Florida Water Management District approved the construction of a sewage
treatment system for 61 homes in a subdivision near the Upper Chain of Lakes.
The sewage system replaced a plan for buying the land in the area, in order
to restore the Kissimmee River.<BR>
<BR>
The properties, all on septic tanks, are near the headwaters to the Kissimmee
River. The revitalization of the headwaters, which consist of Lake Hatchineha,
Lake Kissimmee and Lake Cypress, is a critical component for the restoration
of the river.<BR>
<BR>
The Headwater Revitalization Project will allow for a more natural fluctuation
of water levels. The higher water levels will allow continuous flows into
the Kissimmee River and enhance fish and bird habitats in littoral zones
around the lakes.<BR>
<BR>
The 318 septic tanks of the subdivision would be impacted by the higher
water levels. The most economically feasible solution to the problem was
to build an on-site sewage treatment plant.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, the District is offering to pay to have 257 residents connected
to the system, providing maximum environmental benefits by eliminating all
drainfield releases from within the subdivision.<BR>
<BR>
The District will be reimbursed by the Department of Environmental Protection
for the $2,610,000 it will cost to build the plant.</BLOCKQUOTE>

narrowly wins panel approval with GOP help</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- A business lobby group had rallied
to defeat him but Dick Batchelor narrowly won committee approval to chair
Florida's top environmental rulemaking body Wednesday after two key Republican
Senators voted to support his appointment.<BR>
<BR>
After more than two hours of emotional testimony and debate, the Senate
Natural Resources Committee voted 6-5 on Wednesday to keep Dick Batchelor
as chairman of the Environmental Regulation Commission. Now, opponents may
suspend their fight to have him thrown from the committee, according to
comments made after the meeting by a leading business lobbyist.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;If my members want to continue opposing his appointment, we'll do
so,&quot; said Jodi Chase, vice-president of Associated Industries of Florida
(AIF). &quot;But I'm not spending a lot of time on this.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Last week, Chase held a meeting with supporters for the express purpose
of defeating the appointment. But a clearly disappointed Chase tried to
downplay yesterday's vote. &quot;The only vote that counts is the full Senate's
[vote].&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Batchelor was heartened by the Republican defections.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;AIF mounted an attack and the grenade exploded in their own tent,&quot;
he told EnviroWorld after the meeting.<BR>
<BR>
ERC chairman Batchelor heads a seven-member panel that sets standards for
everything from water quality to soil standards used by the state Department
of Environmental Protection. Critics have recently accused Batchelor, appointed
by Governor Lawton Chiles, of carrying an anti-business bias, being very
outspoken on environmental matters, and participating in lobbying and political
fundraising activities.<BR>
<BR>
Batchelor denies all allegations, saying he lobbies mainly on transportation
issues and, though he raises money for political campaigns, he keeps it
at a distance from industries affected by the ERC.<BR>
<BR>
Batchelor's confirmation will now go to the Senate Executive Business, Ethics
and Elections Committee chaired by Sen. Charlie Crist (R-St. Pete), one
of the Republicans who supported him. The full senate will have vote later
in the session<STRONG>.</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Nearly 60 Tampa Bay residents
gathered in Tallahassee on Wednesday, with the hopes of pressuring Gov.
Lawton Chiles and the state Cabinet to reject Florida Power &amp; Light's
plan to burn Orimulsion at it's Manatee County Plant, the Tampa Tribune
reported.<BR>
<BR>
FP&amp;L is expecting to save nearly $4 billion in 20 years by burning the
new fuel, but residents and environmental groups are concerned with Orimulsion's
environmental impact on Tampa Bay. Concerns regarding aquatic life in Tampa
Bay and the region's air quality play a big role in the critic's minds.<BR>
<BR>
During four hours of testimony, opponents said the fuel, which has never
been used on a large scale in the United States, has not been studied thoroughly
and would be riskier than burning conventional oil, the Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Chiles and cabinet will vote Tuesday on whether FP&amp;L will be allowed
to use the Venezuelan fuel.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Pinellas County lawmaker, Sen.
Jack Latvala, unveiled plans on Wednesday attempting to find peace in the
Tampa Bay water wars, the Tampa Tribune and St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Latvala's bill seeks to give more power and money to the areas's water distributor,
the West Coast Regional Water Supply Authority, to set standards for water
use. The funding, nearly $6-million a year, would come from taxes collected
by the Southwest Florida Water Management District, which regulates the
Tampa Bay area. The bill also calls for a scientific team to recommend minimum
levels for lakes and springs before pumping must stop.<BR>
<BR>
The bill's critics, including Dade City Republican Rep. Carl Littlefield,
say the bill may sound good, but actually has several troubling provisions
that could allow Pinellas to continue pumping. Littlefield also suggested
the use of a scientific study was a stalling tactic and he would prefer
the results of such a study be binding on the governments involved. <BR>
<BR>
The water wars began in recent years, when Pasco and northwest Hillsborough
lakes and streams began to dry up. The bill worries some of Latvala's colleagues
and environmentalists who say it favors Pinellas County at the expense of
its neighbors.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't think anybody in Pasco is ready for just Pinellas legislators
to take the lead on water issues,&quot; Littlefield said at the Wednesday
meeting. &quot;Even though this has been presented as something that will
help Pasco, the devil's in the details.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

is struggling</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- A company suing the state to
allow offshore oil drilling along Florida's Gulf Coast, is finding itself
strapped for money, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Coastal Petroleum is looking at the sale of new stock to raise the funds
necessary to continue the lawsuit. Coastal is a subsidiary of Bermuda-based
Coastal Caribbean Oils &amp; Minerals Ltd., which owns 63.5 percent of the
oil company and controls the board of directors. Coastal Caribbean is attempting
to sell $6.45 million in new stock by May 29, hoping cash infusion will
allow it to continue operating for another five years.<BR>
<BR>
Lykes Bros., a Tampa-based meat packing and farming giant, has been providing
Coastal Petroleum with money. Lykes has invested a total of $2.64 million
into the petroleum company. These investments have been Coastal's main source
of income and funding for the lawsuit since 1992.<BR>
<BR>
Coastal's assets are based in state leases that grant the company oil and
gas drilling rights on a three-mile stretch along the Gulf from Apalachicola
to Naples. The company says they aren't looking to drill, but they want
the state to buy back the leases they've had since the 1940s.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Residents, environmentalists,
business people and county officials met at the Marine Science Center off
Fort Island Trail earlier this week to look at possibilities of the center
becoming bigger in research, ecotourism and education, the St. Petersburg
Times reported. The only problem is, they need to raise the money to make
it all happen.<BR>
<BR>
The center is owned by the Citrus County school district, which spends more
than $250,000 a year to operate. Students regularly visit the center for
hands-on educational programs, but it is not open to the public.<BR>
<BR>
On Tuesday, board members signed three grant requests for the center that
could help pay for summer camp programs, teacher training and hiring a volunteer
and exhibit coordinator. A task force created by the School Board is studying
other potential uses of the center, according to the Times.<BR>
<BR>
Several ideas have been suggested to increase funding: opening the center
to the public and allowing university research, which could bring in government
funding; opening an elder hostel; and encouraging donations for the center
from annual contributions.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Jacksonville officials have
revived plans for a children's park now that the estimate for cleaning up
contaminated soil at the site has dropped dramatically, the Florida Times-Union
reported.<BR>
<BR>
Soil at the site, next to Metropolitan Park, is contaminated with tar-like
petroleum residues from leaking underground storage tanks. Initial estimates
pegged cleanup at $2 million. But Department of Environmental Protection
officials have voiced approval of a $154,000 fix that would simply cover
the soil with 18 inches of more dirt.<BR>
<BR>
Since the 6-acre park, to be called Kids Kampus, would not require any major
disruption of the soil, a consulting engineer for the city found that the
cheaper cleanup was feasible. DEP's Rick Rachal approved the engineer's
recommendations.<BR>
<BR>
The site has competing interests, however. The Jacksonville Jaguars use
it to park 1,000 cars during football games as part of a city agreement
to provide 7,000 spaces for the team. Also, the site is considered an excellent
location for a proposed amphitheater.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Lawmakers will vote today on
a proposal to spend environmental land acquisition money to buy farmland
around Lake Apopka, the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
Pollution from muck farm runoff has contributed to the massive algae blooms
that have turned the lake into a thick soup, deadly to fish and other aquatic
plants. The buyout plan is one option to reduce that runoff, but environmental
groups are opposed to it.<BR>
<BR>
Jim Thomas of the Friends of Lake Apopka told the Sentinel, &quot;We're
particularly not excited about using funds intended to buy endangered lands.
To have those funds yanked out to bail farmers out of a problem doesn't
sit well.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The proposal would siphon off $12 million from the state's Conservation
and Recreation Land (CARL) program, and another $8 million from Save Our
Rivers funds that belong to the St. Johns River Water Management District.
The money would be expected to draw additional federal funds, and the combined
pot would be used to pay a negotiated price. The farmers are asking for
$95 million, while state officials believe $60 million is realistic.<BR>
<BR>
Environmentalists are pushing other measures to improve lake quality, such
as the setting of pollution standards for farmers.<BR>
<BR>
An Orlando Sentinel editorial was also against the buyout proposal, saying
it unfairly shifted all of the burden of cleanup to taxpayers, and used
money meant for endangered land. Instead, the editorial says &quot;... state
lawmakers should treat Lake Apopka much as they treated the Everglades in
1994, when they approved a detailed program to begin restoration efforts
there. Just as with the Everglades, all affected parties should sit at the
same table and hammer out an equitable financial and restoration plan to
save Lake Apopka.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But Rep. Bill Sublette, R-Orlando, countered that lake cleanup often has
been stalled by lawsuits over regulations and that a buyout would immediately
solve the runoff problem by taking the farms out of production.</BLOCKQUOTE>

wetlands gets approval</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Senate Natural Resources
Committee approved a bill Wednesday that endorses mitigation banking.<BR>
<BR>
Mitigation banking is a concept designed to restore large tracts of valuable
wetlands privately. Developers must now restore other wetlands when their
projects result in wetland destruction, but a problem with that policy is
that small, relatively useless patchworks of wetlands get restored. Under
mitigation banking, one company buys a large wetland for restoration and
then sells &quot;credits&quot; to developers. The credits pay for the large
restoration and get the small developer off the hook.<BR>
<BR>
The bill (SB 600) also regulates the mitigation banking industry, which
now consists of five approved companies in Florida. Those companies sell
mitigation &quot;credits&quot; for $25,000 to $45,000 each. <BR>
<BR>
A similar bill in the House has cleared the Natural Resources Committee,
but must make it past two more committees.</BLOCKQUOTE>

for help on Ocklawaha money </STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- In a letter dated April 15,
Gov. Chiles asks Senate president Jim Scott to support a $2 million budget
item that would allow restoration efforts to begin on the Ocklawaha River.<BR>
<BR>
The Department of Environmental Protection is seeking the money to begin
the phased drawdown of the Rodman Resovoir. However legislative opponents
to the river's restoration may try to scuttle the money from the budget.<BR>
<BR>
The letter states, &quot;As you are aware, the once natural and beautiful
Ocklawaha River was damaged and in large part destroyed by the failed attempts
to construct a Cross Florida Barge Canal. Destruction of the Ocklawaha River
was a primary factor in the defeat of the barge canal. Yet, so long as the
Rodman Reservoir remains, the Ocklawaha River will continue to suffer and
the environmental protection and restoration objectives which led to the
canal's deauthorizaition will not be achieved. At the same time, the high
cost of maintaining Rodman and associated structures will continue and increase
each year.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Chiles requested Scott's &quot;assistance for inclusion of funding&quot;
when the Senate Appropriations Bill comes to floor debate.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- American Rivers issued its eleventh
annual report on the United States' most endangered and threatened rivers,
noting that Congress' &quot;aggressive attack on our natural resources posed
the biggest threat this year.<BR>
<BR>
Rebecca Wodder, President of American Rivers, said in an April 17 statement
she hoped members of Congress who have supported an anti-environmental agenda,
would bow to public <BR>
pressure and abandon attacks on laws aimed at protecting water resources.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Poll after poll taken on the environment tells us that the american
public does not share Congress' disdain for environmental protection,&quot;
Wodder said. &quot;Crossing every demographic group, every political party,
every state in the nation, people tell us the same thing: they want more
protection of our natural world and rivers, not less.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The report lists the 10 most endangered rivers and 20 other highly threatened
rivers that flow through 38 states. For the third year in a row, the group
identified Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River as the most endangered in
the country. The report also includes descriptions of the problems facing
each of the endangered and threatened rivers and proposed solutions.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- State legislators voted 59-57
yesterday, rejecting a plan to spend $2 million to tear down the Rodman
Dam, the Florida Times Union reported. The money would have come from unspent
funds from a trust dedicated to local recycling programs.<BR>
<BR>
The vote ends plans to restore the Oklawaha River south of Palatka for another
year, allowing the reservoir to remain, which is considered one of the best
bass fishing lakes in the country.<BR>
<BR>
The dam was built three decades ago as part of the construction of the Cross
Florida Barge Canal. But construction was abandoned in 1971 and ever since,
there have been arguments about what to do with the bridge.<BR>
<BR>
Those who want the dam torn down, say the dam has flooded the forest, killing
wildlife and trees.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The trees are all rotting because they have been under water,&quot;
Joy Mills, spokeswoman for the Department of Environmental Protection, told
the Times Union. &quot;The dam was not built to create a big pond. Next
to the Everglades, the Oklawaha is Florida's best example of what happens
when you don't cooperate with Mother Nature.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Proponents to keep the dam disagree. They feel that replacing the reservoir
with a meandering Okalwaha would have an economic impact of at least $1
million a year, since bass fishing is the greatest attribute of the dam.<BR>
<BR>
Last year, state environmental regulators began seeking the necessary permits
to eliminate the reservoir. The state's reservoir plan calls for draining
the reservoir, building earthen barriers to block a barge canal connecting
it to the St. Johns River, and then bulldozing a hole into the dam, and
letting nature take its course, according to the Times Union.</BLOCKQUOTE>

the &quot;March For Parks,&quot; which will start at 8 a.m. on Saturday
at the main entrance to the Homosassa Springs State Wildlife Park, reported
the St Petersburg Times. <BR>
<BR>
The march will cover roughly 2 miles through the park. Funds raised by marchers
will be used to replace the Birds of Prey exhibit on the premises. A more
natural habitat is needed for the owls, hawks, and eagles in this display.
The goal of the new habitat is to create an environment which will allow
birds to recuperate while maintaining their natural survival skills.<BR>

cancer risks</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- EPA is about to publish new carcinogen
risk assessment guidelines in the Federal Register, which will rely less
on evidence gleaned strictly from animal testing and more on microbiology
and other wider-ranging techniques, according to the New York Times. <BR>
<BR>
The new guidelines are expected to have a large impact on almost all federal
environmental regulations, but observers at this time are unable to say
what the impact will be or what rules specifically will be affected.<BR>
<BR>
The new assessment techniques will consider the effects of low-level chronic
exposure, as well as large acute exposures.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The simplest way to describe the change is that historically we have
just looked at whether or not a chemical causes cancer. Now we will also
look at how. These are not minor changes. This is a significant change in
how we will do this analysis,&quot; EPA Administrator Carol Browner told
the Times.<BR>
<BR>
Some scientists and environmentalists are not comfortable with the changes
in risk assessment. Dr. William Pease, of the University of California at
Berkeley, told the Times, &quot;We don't have the kind of data that is needed
for 90 percent of these compounds. My experience as a scientist is that
no one can agree on these issues. So how do you finish your risk assessment?
You don't need to analyze everything to death before you begin to take public
health decisions about potential carcinogens.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In addition, Al Meyerhoff, attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council,
told the Times &quot;These guidelines would replace a bright red line with
dim gray mush.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CAMP BLANDING --(EnviroWorld)-- A University of Florida professor
said that development of timber land next to Camp Blanding in western Clay
County would be both an environmental and operational &quot;disaster,&quot;
the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
Gilman Paper Co., based in St. Marys, Ga., owns the land north and east
of Camp Blanding, a 73,000-acre National Guard training site. The company
has been trying to sell the land for the past 10 years, but has received
few inquiries, said company official Gordon Respess.<BR>
<BR>
David Wigston, a research professor in UF's botany department, said that
selling the land around the camp would affect both the troop training and

<BR>
Camp Blanding is home to more than 250 endangered plant and animal species.
The area also lies within a wildlife corridor between the Ocala National
Forest and the Osceola National Forest. <BR>

Development would put the wildlife at risk, and restrict training to ever

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON --(EnviroWorld)-- The U.S. Postal Service is trying

causing problems at recycling plants, the Wall Street Journal reported.<BR>
<BR>
The glue on the back of the peel-and-stick stamps is not 100 percent water-soluble.
When too many of those stamps are mixed in with waste paper, clumps of glue
can gum up papermaking equipment, which can result in tiny holes in recycled
products.<BR>
<BR>
While the Postal Service says it is working to eliminate the problem by
coming up with a new glue, stamps with a new glue will not be on the market
for several years.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO --(EnviroWorld)-- Tiny parasitic wasps that were being
mass produced to attack the brown citrus aphid were dealt a setback by the
sudden and explained deaths of helpful aphids that wasps use as hosts, the
Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
The wasps prey on the citrus aphids. Researchers had intended to release
1,500 of them at three locations, but could only put 600 into one field.<BR>
<BR>
The wasps used common spirea aphids as hosts to incubate their young. Thousands
of the common spirea aphids have died in recent weeks. Raymond Yokomi, a
scientist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said the aphids probably
died of a fungus of some kind.<BR>
<BR>
The wasp, Lysiphlebia japonica, was imported from Japan and should be a
good biological control to keep aphid populations at low levels, Yokomi
said. <BR>

with landfill</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA --(EnviroWorld)-- Hillsborough commissioners asked staffers
Thursday to study how much it would cost to repair James &quot;Bobby&quot;
Martin's landfill, which has been torn up in a 3-year, court ordered hunt
for toxic waste, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Commissioners want to see if the county can afford to fill a pair of steep-sided
pits on the property or slope the embankments to make them safer. They also
want to repair the damaged fence that surrounds the property to keep kids
out. County staff will report to commissioners within two weeks on the costs.<BR>
<BR>
The 14-year battle over the landfill has bankrupted Martin. A Pinellas judge
has scheduled a hearing for August to decide who is responsible for restoring
the land. Ten years ago, Pinellas Circuit Judge Fred Bryson appointed KBH
Construction to dig up Martin's dump after Pinellas County claimed it was
polluting a nearby Pinellas wellfield.<BR>
<BR>
KBH hauled off tons of debris and dirt over three years and found only a
5-gallon bucket partially filled with a chemical sealant. The toxic waste
hunt resulted in the two pits that cover 40 acres of the Martins property.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(EnviroWorld)-- The Sarasota Herald-Tribune has reported that
a new aspect to the Orimulsion debate has surfaced - how reliable is the
source of supply? Florida could be staking its future on a country with
a shaky political and economic future.<BR>
<BR>
A report by Roger Fontaine of the Cato Institute, a Washington &quot;think
tank,&quot; says that Venezuela, the potential supplier of the fuel, is
the least stable country in the Western Hemisphere, with the exception of
Cuba.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Venezuela is more vulnerable to catastrophe than are other Latin America
countries,&quot; wrote Fontaine, former senior staff officer for Latin America
in the National Security Council. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nowhere else in South America is there a political culture that has
so thoroughly divorced reward from work and acquired a political class so
loathed ... In no other country other country have the marginalized poor
been so thoroughly urbanized, their daily life deteriorating ...,&quot;
he wrote.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Add to that a middle class that is being thoroughly impoverished,
a security force that is demoralized, and a tiny sector of enormously wealthy
people who have done little to earn their wealth. Those are the ingredients
of a societal Molotov cocktail.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The instability of Venezuela brings into doubt whether Florida will be able
to get enough Orimulsion when it is needed and at a price that can be afforded,
the Herald-Tribune said.<BR>
<BR>
Florida Power &amp; Light wants to burn the tar-based, water soluble fuel
at its Manatee power plant. FP&amp;L expects to save nearly $4 billion over
20 years by burning the new fuel. Environmental groups have cited concerns
about wetlands impact, NOx emissions and other environmental concerns.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA --(EnviroWorld)-- In a Monday interview with Congress
Daily, EPA Administrator Carol Browner took umbrage with comments made this
weekend by House Speaker Newt Gingrich that &quot;the Clinton administration
record on toxic waste is terrible.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Gingrich also made charges that Clinton opposes any environmental measures
that hurt &quot;his trial lawyer friends,&quot; and that more than one-third
of the $15 billion allocated for hazardous waste cleanup has been spent
on bureaucracy and litigation, as opposed to actual cleanup.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Browner responded to the allegations, saying that Superfund cleanups under
the Clinton administration have been 20 percent faster and 25 percent cheaper,
and that more cleanups have been completed than in the past. Any recent
delays, she said, have been caused when the Republican Congress &quot;shut
us down, reopened us, slashed our budget and put riders on&quot; the EPA's
budget.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Superfund bills are pending at the committee level in both chambers
at this time. House and Senate staff, however, remain far apart in negotiations
over cleanup liability and remedy selection.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON,D.C.--(EnviroWorld)--A bill approved by the Congressional
House Resources Committee to raise fees at National Parks including the
Florida Everglades is generating controversy, says an article in the Ft.
Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel. The measure would raise more than $300 million
over the next seven years for park operation and repairs, but critics &quot;say
the measure would keep poor families and the elderly from enjoying some
of America's<BR>
greatest natural and historical treasures.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
While Congress may charge families more to visit parks, a federal lands
grazing bill before legislators would keep subsidies for cattle grazing
on public lands. That contradiction in user-charges may enter the debate

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The passage of major water legislation
in Florida looks unlikely, the St. Petersburg Times reported. With two weeks
to go in the session, House speaker Peter Wallace told the press he was
pessimistic about getting any of the water bills passed.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's just the latest report I've gotten is that something that seemed
to be coming together is coming apart,&quot; Wallace said.<BR>
<BR>
Various pieces of water legislation deal with specific local issues, and
statewide water management issues, but nothing in the House has received
broad support. In the Senate, the prospects for some water bills are brighter,
but that is meaningless unless the House can reach an agreement.<BR>
<BR>
Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Palm Harbor, has offered a plan to resolve those conflicts,
but the plan has met with opposition from several North Suncoast legislators
and environmentalists.<BR>
<BR>
Latvala's bill would require that scientists participate in setting pumping
limits and that the Southwest Florida Water Management District give about
$6-million annually to Tampa Bay's primary water supplier, West Coast Regional
Water Supply Authority, to develop water conservation programs.<BR>
<BR>
Latvala's proposal would also eliminate Swiftmud's power to issue emergency
orders and would reorganize the West Coast board so that it could take action
with a majority vote instead of requiring unanimous consent, according to
the Times. The board consists of Pinellas, Hillsborough and Pasco counties
and the cities of St. Petersburg and Tampa. New Port Richey has a seat but
no vote.</BLOCKQUOTE>

money</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CLEARWATER -- (EnviroWorld) -- Lawmakers in both the state House
and Senate have approved several million dollars to fund beach renourishment
projects along the Pinellas Coast, the St. Petersburg Times reported. Provided
Senators and Representatives can agree on an exact amount, county officials
would like to begin pumping sand within eight months.<BR>
<BR>
The Florida Senate has approved $5.3-million for the project, while the
House has agreed to spend a thrifty $3.5 million. The money would be spent
on 12 miles of beaches from Clearwater to Redington Beach.<BR>
County officials expect the project to cost $17-million. The county and
state are expected to come up with a total of about $7-million, and the
federal government is committed to the rest. <BR>
<BR>
Jim Terry, the county's coastal manager, told the Times that the money in
question would fund the fourth and final phase of a project that has renourished
beaches in North Redington Beach, Redington Shores, Indian Rocks Beach and
Indian Shores.<BR>
<BR>
When completed the project will have pumped 2-million cubic yards of sand
on the badly eroded beaches. Terry said the sand would probably last five
to ten years, as long as the area was spared from hurricanes.</BLOCKQUOTE>

mercury-containing devices</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--Last week, the Department of Environmental
Protection issued a statement to clarify the new legislative prohibition
on the incineration and landfill disposal of mercury-containing devices.
The new law, effective since January 1, 1996, requires both citizens and
businesses to recycle devices containing significant amounts of mercury.
These items must be landfilled, not incinerated.<BR>
<BR>
Concern over high mercury levels discovered in the tissues of certain kinds
of commonly eaten fish found in Florida's lakes, rivers, and wetlands sparked
the prohibition. The comprehensive disposal prohibition arose when &quot;mercury
containing devices&quot; were found to be more hazardous to the environment
than fluorescent lamps.<BR>
<BR>
In Florida alone, the DEP estimates that without the prohibition, as much
as 1.5 tons of mercury could be disposed of in the trash annually by the
year 2000. <BR>
<BR>
Common types of mercury-containing devices found in the home include air
conditioning and heating thermostats and common glass fever thermometers.
In businesses, high levels of mercury are found in medical monitoring or
test equipment and food frying equipment controls, among others.<BR>
<BR>
For residential users, recycling programs are available in the form of Household
Chemical Collection or Household Hazardous Waste programs in several counties
statewide. Some counties also have programs which small businesses can use
at a modest cost to recycle their mercury-containing devices. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We've worked hard to facilitate these types of reverse distribution
programs, and it looks like that hard work is about to pay off in a big
way environmentally in Florida,&quot; says Bill Hinkley, Chief of the Bureau
of Solid and Hazardous waste. &quot;There are a lot of good corporate citizens
out there who want to do the right thing.&quot;<BR>
<BR>

waste management division at 1-800-741-4DEP; or via Internet E-mail at price_jl@dep.state.fl.us

for use in food processing industry</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>MERRITT ISLAND--(EnviroWorld)--A study investigating potential
applications for solar water heating systems may prove economically, as
well as environmentally wise for food processing companies. <BR>
<BR>
Healey &amp;Associates, a Florida based consulting engineering firm, will
be conducting the feasibility studies for the project, which is funded by
the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory. <BR>
<BR>
There is no cost to participate in the study. Healey &amp;Associates hopes
to help interested companies evaluate water use/cost and performance to
determine if solar power would be a viable alternative to traditional means
of heating water. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Solar power is a natural power source that has been around for a long
time,&quot; said Henry Healey, president of Healey &amp;Associates. Solar
power is cleaner and safer than the traditional methods which are often
used to heat water, he said. The solar alternative has been used in swimming
pools and homes for years and only in recent times &quot;have industries
taken advantage of this excellent power source and saved money in the process,&quot;
Healey said.<BR>
<BR>
NREL has also indicated that it may participate n a cost-share project for
a site, where the costs of project design and implementation could be shared
by the company participating and NREL. <BR>
<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WEST PALM BEACH--(EnviroWorld)--The Governing Board of the South
Florida Water Management District has granted a 20-year water use permit
to Southern States Utilities in Collier County. The staff have also been
directed to begin rulemaking to consider other lengthy durations for water
users in developing alternative supply sources. <BR>
<BR>
Southern States Utilities applied for a long-term permit that would allow
them to expand a reverse osmosis water treatment plant, as well as to begin
an intensive water reuse program in the Marco Island service area. <BR>
<BR>
By issuing long-term water use permits, incentives would be provided for
applicants to develop alternative supply sources, instead of simply relying
on traditional water sources to meet future demand. Longer permits also
make it easier for applicants to finance construction of alternative methods.
<BR>
<BR>
To assure compliance with the conditions of the permit, periodic audits

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE --(EnviroWorld)-- Alachua County commissioners want
to install infrastructure in east Gainesville in hopes that it will spawn
growth, but many don't think the area can support the cost of such a move,
the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
The commissioners want Gainesville Regional Utilities to front the money
to build the infrastructure in limited areas of east Gainesville. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The county has built a fire rescue station, which is the beginning
of a commitment to start providing infrastructure for growth ... rather
than allowing the market to continue to dictate new subdivisions,&quot;
said County Commissioner Kate Barnes.<BR>
<BR>
Opponents to the plan say that east Gainesville has not shown the ability
to attract businesses and developers. Putting money into the area to build
an infrastructure instead of waiting for development to fund it would be
a big risk.<BR>
<BR>
Gainesville's Mayor-Commissioner Jim Painter said he'd like to see a mechanism
to pay GRU with grants, or diverting some of the $19 million GRU gives to
the general government to help spur eastside growth.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA --(EnviroWorld)-- In its editorial today, the Tampa Tribune
urged Gov. Lawton Chiles and Cabinet members to say no to Orimulsion, because
it poses too many risks to the environment.<BR>
<BR>
The Tribune specifically cited nitrogen pollution that would occur if Florida
Power &amp; Light switched to Orimulsion. The burning of the fuel would
more than double the emissions of nitrogen oxides. Nitrogen pollution is
already a major problem in the Tampa Bay area, according to a Tampa Bay
National Estuary Program study.<BR>
<BR>
Also, the Tribune warned against Orimulsion because it readily mixes with
saltwater, which would make it difficult or impossible to cleanup after
a spill. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It is hardly reassuring that the only tests conducted on Orimulsion
cleanup have been done in an indoor swimming pool,&quot; the Tribune wrote.<BR>
<BR>
The only plant in North America burning Orimulsion is in Dalhousie, Canada,
and it has had serious problems switching to the fuel, including thick smog
with acrid, sulfurous odor and cars stained and damaged by corrosive soot,
the Tribune added.<BR>
<BR>
Orimulsion is a water and tar fuel from Venezuela. FP&amp;L wants to burn
the fuel at its Port Manatee power plant.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>LAKELAND --(EnviroWorld)-- An awakening of environmental-awareness
among some Christians and Jews has religious groups working to shape governmental
policy and change personal habits, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
In the past six years, a fragmented religious green movement has spawned
the National Religious Partnership for the Environment, which is supported
by the Catholic Church, mainstream Protestant denominations, Evangelicals
and Jews.<BR>
<BR>
In the past year, they have spent $5 million sending ecology information
packets based on Scripture to 53,000 congregations across the country. The
packets include sermon suggestions, bulletin inserts, Bible study curricula
and step-by-step recommendations on establishing environmental programs.<BR>
<BR>
However, the religious environmentalists want to keep their message distinct
from secular environmentalist groups. To accomplish this, many avoid using
the term &quot;environmental,&quot; preferring the word &quot;creation&quot;
instead. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;(The secular groups) have been using political and economic arguments,
not biblical ones,&quot; said Paul Gorman, director of the partnership.
&quot;We are Christians and Jews trying to be true to our teachings.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG -- (EnviroWorld) -- An annual bloom of marine
plant life in the Gulf of Mexico, which has been dubbed &quot;The Green
River,&quot; may hold clues to other ecological mysteries off Florida's
Gulf coast, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Among those mysteries is what causes the deadly red tide to occur. While
scientists know that red tide is the result of a toxin produced by microscopic
marine organisms called dinoflagellates, they do not know what triggers
the dinos to bloom so suddenly and cause massive fish kills.<BR>
<BR>
The Green River is seen as a precursor to red tide events. Also called the
West Florida Plume, the Green River begins as a large community of single-celled
plants, called diatoms, that forms in the northern Gulf. Nutrients are pumped
into the area from rivers rich in fertilizer runoff, and spur growth of
the plume. As currents push the plume south, the makeup of the plume changes
to more complex plants, including the killer dinoflagellate, Gymnodinium
breve.<BR>
<BR>
As yet, scientists have found no direct links between the Green River and
red tide, however the river's existence has only been known since 1992.
It was discovered by Frank Muller-Karger, a biological oceanographer at
the University of South Florida, along with doctoral student Fernando Gilbes.
The two found the plume while studying images from Nimbus 7, a satellite
which has now ceased functioning.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- What was supposed to be a day
dedicated to sincere acts to help the Earth became an opportunity for political
pot shots, the Associated Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
With this year's Earth Day taking place amid a presidential race in which
the environment is an issue, Democrats pressed attacks against a Republican
platform they say would destroy a quarter century of environmental protection
laws.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's the grinch that stole Earth Day,&quot; said Deb Callahan, president
of the League of Conservation Voters.<BR>
<BR>
Democrats are accusing Republicans of being hypocritical on environmental
protection -- talking &quot;green&quot; but voting the other way. And GOP
lawmakers are charging the Democrats with &quot;fearmongering&quot; to help
get President Clinton reelected and perhaps boost the party's numbers in
Congress.<BR>
<BR>
Recently, at an outside press conference among the trees, House Democrats
called on Republican lawmakers &quot;to stop the photo-ops and address real
environmental concerns.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Republican leaders complained their position on the environment was being
wrongly characterized for political gain.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Democrats are on a very partisan kick right now,&quot; said House
Speaker Newt Gingrich. Gingrich had advised GOP lawmakers to visit zoos

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Gainesville city commissioners
unanimously turned down a proposal that would have allowed 70-foot-tall
buildings just east of the University of Florida, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
Developers had argued that allowing such heights was the only way to approach
the area's maximum allowable density of 100 units per acre. However, much
of the area contains single-story houses, and despite concerns about a rapidly
growing student population, commissioners were reluctant to make a hasty
change.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't see the rush to do this,&quot; said Commissioner Bruce Delaney.
&quot;I think we'd be making a mistake if we allow these heights without
considering what they mean to people living in the areas.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- Several positives, and a few
negatives, were cited in a management firm's survey of the environmental
engineering and construction market, the magazine ENR reported in its April
22 issue.<BR>
<BR>
Overall the market grew five percent to $12.5 billion, according to figures
by Farkas Berkowitz &amp; Co., a Washington, D.C. firm. The largest growth
was seen in air pollution engineering, which grew 20 percent to $600 million.
However, most other waste cleanup categories were stagnant or shrinking,
and one of the firm's principals stated that the market peaked in late 1995
in concert with a slowdown in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rulemaking.<BR>
<BR>
Some growth was also seen in regional water resource management and privatization
of environmental infrastructure, ENR reported.<BR>
<BR>
In the area of environmental cleanup, consulting dropped five percent, but
field remediation grew 20 percent as part of the movement to speed along
the progress of cleanups. The Department of Defense was a leading factor
in these figures, pushing faster site cleanups in the early part of 1995,
but getting stalled by budget politics in the last quarter.</BLOCKQUOTE>

orders draft denial</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--Governor Lawton Chiles has directed
state lawyers to draft an order denying Florida Power &amp; Lights' bid
to burn a controversial fuel at its Manatee County electric plant. <BR>
<BR>
FP&amp;L has made the nation's first application to burn Orimulsion commercially.
Orimulsion, a tar like substance from Venezuela, has only been burned in
experiments in the U.S. A hearing on the application will occur at today's
meeting of the Governor and Cabinet. <BR>
<BR>
Opponents cite unresolved air and water pollution threats as reason for
the Governor and Cabinet to deny the application at its meeting today. Those
threats include increased emissions of Nitrous oxides and problematic cleanups
in the event of fuel spills. <BR>
<BR>
FP&amp;L cites the approval of local governments, the state DEP, and a favorable
ruling from a administrative hearing officer as reason enough to approve
the application. <BR>
<BR>
Although The Tampa Tribune reported Saturday that cabinet aide sources predicted
passage of the application, the governor has directed DEP lawyers to draft
a denial order anyway. Chiles chairs the seven-person cabinet and has one
vote. No other cabinet members have publicly stated their position on the
controversial permit. <BR>
<BR>
Over the weekend, editorials and stories opposing the plant were published
by the Tampa Tribune, The St. Petersburg Times, and the Sarasota Herald-Tribune.
Today's meeting figures to be noisy; two bus loads of protesters from the
area around the plant were set to repeat last week's demonstration at the
Capital. </BLOCKQUOTE>

sewage spray field close to sensitive lake</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--Turning aside the recommendations
of its own chief biologist, the state Department of Environmental Regulation
intends to permit a sewage spray field within spitting distance of a sensitive
north Florida lake. <BR>
<BR>
An &quot;Intent to Issue&quot; a permit for a 700,000 gallon per day sewage
discharge next to the 5,700-acre Lake Imonia near Tallahassee has generated
public outcry and an administrative challenge from a citizen group. <BR>
<BR>
DEP's chief biologist can't understand why the permit application was approved.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's like throwing gas on a fire,&quot; says Jess Van Dyke, DEP's
Regional Biologist for Northwest Florida. &quot;The lake is shallow and
phosphorous limited. I can see this making the water hyacinth population
really take off. <BR>
<BR>
The proposal by Talquin Electrical Cooperative would double the capacity
of an existing wastewater treatment plant and build a new spray field within
150 feet of Lake Imonia. <BR>
<BR>
In October of last year, Van Dyke inspected the site and concluded in a
letter to the permitting officer, &quot;the site is unsuitable for a sewage
spray field.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
DEP water facilities permit administrator Mark Sowell tried to distance
Van Dyke from the issue. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't know if he [Van Dyke] lives out there or what, but he submitted
that letter as an individual,&quot; Sowell told EnviroWorld. &quot;It was
not part of his duties.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The letter was on DEP letterhead.<BR>
<BR>
According to Sowell, the engineering report indicates that all the sprayed
effluent will percolate down through the soil before it reaches the lake.
However, the engineer in charge, John Fleck of Southern Engineering, has
not returned EnviroWorld's phone calls for comment. <BR>
<BR>
DEP's spokesperson Joy Mills concurs with Sowell, calling the plan a &quot;completely
permittable project.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
As for Van Dyke's concerns, Mills stated &quot;We respect his opinion or
else we wouldn't employ him. But this is not his area of expertise.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
However, if runoff was found to be migrating from the site into the lake,
Mills said DEP &quot;would have to look at the permit again.&quot; </BLOCKQUOTE>

an address makes</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--New York's two leading newspapers
helped mark Earth Day by writing editorials on environmental issues. And
the only thing they have in common is their city of residence.<BR>
<BR>
The New York Times marks Earth Day by criticizing conservative Republicans
and some Democrats in Congress, who, &quot;heedless of public opinion and
deaf to the pleas of their moderate colleagues,...[are] pressing forward
with their efforts to undermine the country's basic environmental laws.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The Times writes that the omnibus appropriations bill currently under consideration,
which reduces EPA appropriations and limits EPA wetland protection, is &quot;the
most urgent example of bad legislation....&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The Times notes that many of the 77 members of the newly created Congressional
Republican environmental task force are &quot;likely to spend the week [around
Earth Day] planting trees, visiting zoos and striking friendly poses next
to recycling bins,&quot; but that the country and the Republican party would
be better served if Congress would &quot;remove those riders from the appropriations
bill.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal calls for reevaluation of the
government's role in environmental protection.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The rule-bound governmental control of the environment now being defended
by the Clinton Administration is simply not sustainable.&quot; Environmental
issues of concern should be dealt with by the private sector, or by the
system of &quot;democratic capitalism.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The Journal describes how Canada, Kenya and Zimbabwe are implementing protection
of endangered species, and calls for the US to reform the Endangered Species
Act along similar lines. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>BRANDON -- (EnviroWorld) -- After local regulators hit IMC-Agrico
with a $140,000 fine for a 1994 dam burst at Hopewell mine in east Hillsborough
County, state environmental regulators are considering another $226,000
fine on the phosphate company, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
In November 1994, the earthen wall burst at one one of the company's clay
settling ponds near Keysville, causing extremely murky water to flow across
pastures and residential properties into the Alafia River. As a result,
the Alafia, which feeds into Tampa Bay, reached levels of turbidity that
topped state standards by almost 13 percent. Turbid water is known to rob
a river of oxygen, hurting aquatic plant and animal life.<BR>
<BR>
IMC spokeswoman Janet Jackson told the Tribune the company will try to negotiate
a smaller fine. The company already has agreed to patch up 1 3/4 acres of
wetlands uprooted in the flood. In addition, they have begun restoring agricultural
ditches and bridges that were damaged by the flood.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>MIAMI -- (EnviroWorld) -- As first lady Hilary Clinton arrived

nearly 300 sugar farmers rallied together to protest the Clinton administration's
plans to charge a penny-per-pound tax on the sugar industry to help pay
for Everglades cleanup, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Sugar farmers believe the tax is unfair and many say they could never afford
it. The sugar industry claims they are already paying money to settle other
environmental issues and any more charges could devastate the industry.<BR>
<BR>
Though Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole said he doesn't think the plan will
pass through Congress, sugar farmers aren't taking any chances. Protesters
marched through downtown Miami to a park across the street from the hotel
where Mrs. Clinton was speaking. They appealed to her concern for families,
which is expressed in her book, &quot;It Takes a Village and other Lessons

and Cabinet burn Orimulsion request</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Gov. Lawton Chiles and the state
cabinet made a multi-billion dollar decision Tuesday, and rejected Florida
Power &amp; Light's request to use an alternative fuel.<BR>
<BR>
FP&amp;L, Florida's largest utility, had estimated that burning the fuel
Orimulsion at its Manatee Plant would save $4 billion in fuel costs in a
20 year span. But the decision came down to whether the savings was enough
to overcome the potential for environmental harm from using the fuel.<BR>
<BR>
Listening to impassioned arguments from both sides, Gov. Chiles, Attorney
General Bob Butterworth, Comptroller Bob Milligan, and Insurance Commissioner
Bill Nelson voted against the request. Secretary of State Sandra Mortham,
Education Commissioner Frank Brogan, and Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford
voted to allow it.<BR>
<BR>
Orimulsion is a Venezuelan fuel based on bitumen tar that is treated to
make it water soluble. The cheap fuel has not yet been used anywhere in
the United States. FP&amp;L officials estimated that customers served by
the Manatee Plant would see a $3 per month savings on their utility bills
within the year. The savings would have been much more significant in industry,
though. A Port Manatee cement facility told the board the facility would
save $1 million a year with Orimulsion, according to the Tampa Tribune.<BR>
<BR>
However Orimulsion posed a number of sticky environmental questions. While
FP&amp;L had agreed to use pollution controls that would have reduced sulfur
dioxide emissions, it planned to increase the emission of nitrogen oxides
from the plant -- a move that worried many groups concerned with the long
term economic and environmental health of Tampa Bay. In addition, the possibility
of a major tanker spill of a fuel that mixes with water was cause for concern.
Only limited tests had been conducted on cleaning up an Orimulsion spill.<BR>
<BR>
Approval to burn Orimulsion had been obtained at lower levels of government,
and the decision by the Governor and Cabinet was one of the last hurdles
that FP&amp;L had to clear, though some legislators were considering action
against the fuel. The utility may still appeal the decision to a federal
appeals court.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- With the state legislative session
coming to a close, lawmakers managed to wring a water bill out of the Senate
Natural Resources Committee, the Tampa Tribune reported. <BR>
<BR>
Though stripped down, Sen. Jack Latvala's legislation, which primarily addresses
problems in the Southwest Florida Water Management District, still has many
sticky points for environmentalists and government officials.The most problematic
may be a provision that would allow water users to renew their consumption
permits if they mitigated the damage caused by over-pumping. Sen. Ginny
Brown-Waite, R-Spring Hill is an ardent critic of that provision.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The mitigation in that bill is government-sponsored rape of land,&quot;
Brown-Waite said.<BR>
<BR>
Other components of Latvala's bill would allow scientific study to determine
water-pumping levels that are environmentally safe; require water districts
to set minimum levels for water sources; provide counties the right to appeal
water permits to water management districts; and give the West Coast Regional
Water Supply Authority, the major water supplier to Tampa Bay, $6 million
a year from Swiftmud to fix problems caused by overpumping.<BR>
<BR>
The bill will have an uphill battle in the Senate, and the local governments
most affected by it -- Hillsborough, Pasco, and Pinellas counties -- do
not support it. Latvala has indicated he would be willing to further soften
the bill, if necessary.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO--(EnviroWorld)--An Orange County lake was closed Tuesday
after warnings that raw sewage may have contaminated the water, reported
the Orlando Sentinel. <BR>
<BR>
Skull-and-crossbones warnings were posted by the Orange County Environmental
Protection Department this past weekend following an accident at an area
sewage collection station. When two of the system's pumps &quot;burned out,&quot;
800,000 gallons of raw sewage was spewed into a feeder canal of Spring Lake
and Little Sand Lake in Orlando. <BR>
<BR>
A water sample gathered where the canal meets Little Sand Lake showed bacterial
contamination &quot;too numerous to count,&quot; the Sentinel reported.
Spring Lake is scheduled to be tested today and will probably remain closed
until the weekend. <BR>
<BR>
Although serious illness resulting from contact with the contaminated waters
is unlikely, flu-like symptoms may strike people who were directly exposed.
<BR>
<BR>
The county will continue to study the cause of the spill, and debate how
it could happen at a sewage station designed to avoid problems such as a
freak equipment failure.</BLOCKQUOTE>

water-use bills</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE --(EnviroWorld)-- Top officials with the state's
five water management districts met with Florida Farm Bureau Federation
officials Tuesday at the farm group's headquarters in Gainesville to discuss
water-use legislation, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
While water-use bills will likely receive no action in the state legislature
this year, the water managers told the farm group that inaction may not
be a bad thing.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's kind of scary to see what goes through not knowing what the result
would be if passed,&quot; said Richard McLean of the Southwest Florida Water
Management District.<BR>
<BR>
Farm Bureau President Carl Loop Jr. urged water managers to make as many
changes as possible without legislation. <BR>
<BR>
Farmers want changes such as receiving water permits for longer periods
of time, being able to reserve water for agriculture and having mandatory
representation on water management district boards.<BR>
<BR>
However, environmental groups, industry, urban areas and the districts themselves
all have their own water-use agendas and lobbyists working to influence
legislation.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This is not a two-sided issue,&quot; said Henry Dean, executive director
of the St. Johns River Water Management District. &quot;This is more like
a 10-sided or 12-sided issue.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

U.S. House</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON --(EnviroWorld)-- The U.S. House of Representatives
approved the Mercury-Containing &amp; Rechargeable Battery Management Act,
which promotes the recycling of batteries, the Gainesville Sun reported.
The reforms are intended to remove toxic elements found in batteries from
the waste stream.<BR>
<BR>
The bill streamlines battery labeling requirements, clarifies federal regulatory
requirements for battery collection programs and phases out the use of mercury
in most batteries.<BR>
<BR>
Battery collection programs have been slowed by federal regulations that
discourage retail stores that sell batteries from later accepting them for
recycling because the worn batteries fall under federal industrial waste
requirements. The bill exempts retail stores from those requirements.<BR>
<BR>
The bill also enacts a uniform labeling system for batteries, which often
vary because of different state requirements.<BR>
<BR>
The bill had the support of both environmental groups and the battery industry.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>FT. LAUDERDALE--(EnviroWorld)--(c)Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel,
reprinted with permission--What do you do about a tax-paid pollution cleanup
program that is hundreds of millions of dollars in the red?<BR>
<BR>
The Florida Legislature's answer: Make taxpayers pay more. You may have
seen bulldozers, big piles of dirt or drilling equipment at the corner gas
station. The reason is that across Florida, underground gas tanks have leaked.
Because Florida is highly dependent on its underground water resources,
those leaking tanks are considered one of the state's biggest pollution
problems.<BR>
<BR>
For that reason, many legislators and environmentalists believe it's not
as important who pays for the cleanups, but that cleanups happen as quickly
as possible.<BR>
<BR>
So, look for the taxpayer tab to go even higher if legislation moving forward
in Tallahassee this spring succeeds. The bills (CS/SB 648 and CS/HB 1127)
would make another 4,000-plus gas stations and other contaminated sites
eligible for state-financed cleanups. The land owners would be responsible
for up to 25 percent of the cleanup costs.<BR>
<BR>
If adopted, it would add up to $1 billion to the tab, state officials estimate.<BR>
<BR>
Legislators defend their proposal, saying it will encourage land owners
to clean up rather than cover up.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We had to figure that there are folks out there who cannot afford
to clean up,'' said Everett Kelly, D-Tavares, House Natural Resources chairman.
&quot;And I suspect that if a person doesn't have any money and he finds
some buried drums on his property, he's going to just cover them up.&quot;<BR>
But regulators from Broward, Palm Beach, Dade and Alachua counties opposed
the idea.<BR>
They say many of these land owners failed to come forward when the state
offered to pay for the cleanup, and some even thumbed their noses at regulators.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We hate to see the addition of a new amnesty program because, quite
frankly, it's going to let a lot of people in for a free cleanup who we
don't think should be eligible,'' said Tim Neal of the Palm Beach County
Department of Environmental Resource Management. &quot;It actually benefits
someone who was not in compliance.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A major player pushing the idea is Rick Dantzler, D-Winter Haven, Senate
Natural Resources chairman.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There just has been so much strife and consternation over this issue
over the years,&quot; Dantzler told the Natural Resources Committee. &quot;It's
going to take a mind shift in some ways.&quot; </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>INGLIS -- (EnviroWorld) -- At least 13 Inglis homeowners are
losing ground this week, the St. Petersburg Times reported. Their property,
along the Withlacoochee River, was discovered to have high levels of lead
and arsenic by Environmental Protection Agency Officials more than a year
ago, and officials must now remove about 12,000 cubic yards of dirt to remediate
the area.<BR>
<BR>
The land was formerly the site of Barker Chemical Co., a fertilizer manufacturer.<BR>
<BR>
The cleanup will take several months, though individuals will only be displaced
from their homes for two or three weeks. The agency will try to landscape
the homesites back to their previous appearance.<BR>
<BR>
Costs for the project are estimated at $2.7 million. EPA tests of soil on
the south bank of the river, in Citrus County, found arsenic and lead levels
within EPA limits, but because Florida Department of Environmental Protection
has stricter standards for the metals, cleanups may eventually occur in
that area also.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- In 1994, Jacksonville got $1.3
million from a state agency to buy the 123-acre Blue Cypress Park in Arlington
with a condition that the land be used as a public park. Now the City Council
is trying to change that stipulation so that the area can become an 18-hole
golf course, the Florida Times-Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
Tuesday, the council voted to amend the city's plan for the park, but council
members will still have to convince the Florida Communities Trust to go
along. The Trust kicked in half of the park's purchase price, and trust
chairman James Murley has written to the city that the grant was given with
the expectation that the property be used as a public park.<BR>
<BR>
Among other opponents of the course are the Sierra Club and the owners of
another public golf course in Arlington.<BR>
<BR>
The idea came about when former pro-golfer Steve Melnyk approached the city
last year with a proposal to convert the park into a city-owned but privately
managed golf course. The park has had a course in the past. <BR>
<BR>
The city council proposal will be sent to the Florida Communities Trust
for consideration at its meeting next month.</BLOCKQUOTE>

issues</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- House Speaker Newt Gingrich defended
his record on environmental protection Wednesday and said that country must
move toward &quot;a new environmentalism&quot; favoring incentives over
regulatory edicts from Washington, the Associated Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
Gingrich rejected criticism that the House GOP leadership was bent on rolling
back environmental regulations. But he said that too often his leadership
team has focused &quot;on process,&quot; instead of why some environmental
laws need to be changed.<BR>
<BR>
Moderate Republicans in congress have raised concerns that their party was
being perceived as seeking to destroy a quarter-century of environmental
laws. Gingrich has sought to counter those concerns.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Most Americans see themselves one way or another as environmentalists,&quot;
said Gingrich. But he added that the last 25 years of environmental policies
too often have relied on &quot;an adversarial style&quot; that has discouraged
cooperation.<BR>
<BR>
The federal government should continue to set broad standards but leave
up to states, businesses or citizens how those standards should be met,
Gingrich suggested in remarks to an environmental forum.<BR>
<BR>
EPA Administrator Carol Browner said her agency has moved toward greater
cooperation and flexibility &quot;since day one&quot; despite a GOP drive
in Congress to slash its budget. She said House Republicans at the same
time have sought to &quot;dismantle 25 years of progress&quot; in environmental
protection.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;While strengthening public health and environmental protections, the
Clinton administration has made real responsible changes to streamline the
system {and} make some of the changes that Congressman Gingrich is only
now starting to talk about,&quot; Browner said in response to Gingrich.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>FREDERICK, Md. -- (EnviroWorld) -- The nation's largest maker
of solar-power systems, Solarex, saw a 30 percent gain in sales, topping
the $40 million mark, the Associated Press reported. Lower production costs
and higher Third World demand were cited by Solarex president Harvey Forest
as major factors in the companies success.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Two billion people live in conditions without electricity,&quot; Forest
said. &quot;We've been able to sell into countries where there is a need
for electricity.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Among the company's upcoming projects are a 500 kilowatt rooftop installation
on top of the Trade and Technology Center in Bonn, Germany, and a photovoltaic
power plant in the Thar Desert of Rajasthan, India with a 50 megawatt capacity.<BR>
<BR>
Previously, Solarex has supplied solar modules for applications in South
Africa, Indonesia, Peru, Morocco, Pakistan and Latin America.<BR>
<BR>
According to Allan L. Frank, editor and publisher of &quot;The Solar Letter,&quot;
sun-generated electricity now costs about 18 cents a kilowatt-hour. That's
about twice as much as fossil-fuel derived electricity, but cheap enough
for remote places.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--In a move that surprised many, the
House last evening quickly took up the Underground Tanks Cleanup bill (CS/HB
1127), approved the 9 amendments adopted only the day before by the Appropriations
Committee, and then passed the bill. It now goes to the Senate. <BR>
<BR>
In the meantime, environmental industry lobbyists voiced concerns over a
controversial amendment to the bill that would discount the value of tanks-cleanup
reimbursement applications now in the backlog by 3.5 percent. About $350
million is currently owed by the state to contractors who have performed
cleanup work and are awaiting state reimbursement.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We don't want to kill the bill but there will be litigation,&quot;
says lobbyist Carter McCain. &quot;If discounting withstands a legal challenge
it will be devastating to contractors and landowners.&quot;<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- Without question, Tampa Electric Company
(TECO) is responsible for a large part of the nitrogen oxide emissions that
foul the air and water of Tampa Bay. But while environmentalists are hailing
a proposed EPA rule that would require the use of NOx-reduction equipment
at generating plants such as TECO's, the utility is attempting to wage a
public relations numbers battle, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Nitrogen oxides, or NOx, are a major contributor to acid rain and smog.<BR>
<BR>
Currently, TECO's coal-fired plants in south Hillsborough County spew 80,000
tons of NOx a year into the atmosphere and are under no restrictions for
that pollutant. By comparison, Florida Power &amp; Lights controversial
proposal to burn the alternative fuel Orimulsion in the area would have
generated 13,000 tons of NOx a year.<BR>
<BR>
But TECO is arguing that supporters of the EPA rule,which would require
TECO to cut its emissions by half, are overstating the utility's contribution
to pollution. For example, while local regulators say TECO generates 65
percent of the NOx pollution in Hillsborough and Pinellas counties, company
officials say the number is really only 40 percent.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I think that's a major confession,&quot; Tom Reese told the Tribune.
Reese is an attorney for the environmental group Manasota-88, which just
claimed a victory in the Orimulsion battle with Florida Power and Light.
&quot;It's like saying, 'I only had five beers, officer.'&quot;<BR>
<BR>
And while the EPA estimates that the rule would only create a 10 cent jump
in a $100 utility bill, TECO also says those numbers are too low. Company
officials estimate that retrofitting their stacks with NOx controls will
cost $200 million with $65 million annual operating costs.<BR>

to trees in state preserve</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--Volunteers at San Felasco Hammock
State Preserve will plant 10,000 longleaf pine seedling this weekend to
replace those that have fallen victim to beetles in the past three years,
the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
More than 100,000 pines have been lost in the preserve at Devil's Millhopper
State Geological Site. <BR>
<BR>
The rice-sized beetles, although a natural phenomenon, are responsible for
killing trees in parks, pine plantations, yards and vacant lots. Thousands
of trees in the northwest area of Gainesville were forced to be chopped
down after being invaded by the insects.<BR>
<BR>
The Florida Park Service has asked for $80,000 from the legislature for
restoration, and although the amount of trees to be planted is far less
than those that were lost to the beetles, officials said some areas of the
forest needed thinning-out anyway.<BR>
<BR>
Those wanting to plant trees should contact preserve manager Randy Brown
at (352)462-7905.</BLOCKQUOTE>

pace</STRONG> </A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)--Government scientists reported new
data that the ozone layer is continuing to shrink at an unacceptable pace,
the Florida Times-Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Global ozone is declining...on the order of 4 percent per decade,&quot;
said David Hoffman, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
Climate Monitoring and Diagnostic Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado. <BR>
<BR>
However, awareness about the disappearing ozone layer has been growing in
the past twenty years. <BR>
<BR>
Scientists maintain that strict adherence to an international agreement
banning production of ozone-depleting chemicals will likely bring improvements
as early as the next decade. <BR>
<BR>
Yesterday's report adds to earlier studies, confirming initial data of the
rapidly decreasing ozone, even as governments move to lower the use of harmful
chemicals, such as freon and other chlorofluorocarbons.</BLOCKQUOTE>

new electricity rates</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)--Major changes were ordered Wednesday
in the way electricity is sold at the wholesale level, reported the Orlando
Sentinel and the Tampa Tribune.<BR>
<BR>
Federal Regulators say the new rules should save customers as much as $5.4
billion a year, affecting the electric rates of millions of people. <BR>
<BR>
The new rules, effective 60 days after they are published in the <CITE>Federal
Register</CITE> , will require public electric utilities to open their transmission
lines to competitors and to share information pertaining to available transmission
capacity.<BR>
<BR>
According to the new rules, the transmission service offered by utilities
to others must be the same as they provide for themselves. The order also
requires full recovery by the utility of &quot;stranded costs,&quot; expenses
which go unrecovered if power customers move to another supplier. <BR>
<BR>
Some concern has arisen that increased opportunities for selling power will
lead to more air pollution by power plants. However, Commissioner William
A. Massey is confident that &quot;the final rule will not cause a black
cloud of ozone to descend on the Northeast.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

this week</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>DELAND--(EnviroWorld)--For the second time in the past week,
a bear has wandered into a residential area of Volusia County, the Orlando
Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
A 300-pound black bear positioned itself in a pine tree off U.S. Highway
17-92, just south of DeLand, on Wednesday. Just two days earlier another
black bear was founding nesting in a tree in DeLand. Scientists are sure
the bears are two different animals because of the distinctive white blaze
on the chest of Monday's bear. <BR>
<BR>
The Florida black bear is a threatened species, numbering 1000 to 1500 statewide.
Bears will often emerge from their natural environment to search a neighborhood
for food, especially as development claims their original territories. <BR>
<BR>
However, lack of natural food isn't considered as severe a problem in Volusia
County as in other areas of the state. The two bears spotted in DeLand are
thought to have come into town to stake out their new home for the year
and perhaps to establish territory for breeding, said Dan Miller, game commission
biologist. <BR>
<BR>
Wednesday's bear was treated in the same manner as Monday's furry visitor.
Biologists waited until nightfall to give the bear a chance to calm down
and descend from the tree. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TARPON SPRINGS -- (EnviroWorld) -- The federal Environmental
Protection Agency has drafted a three-year cleanup proposal for the defunct
Stauffer Chemical Plant that calls for moving hazardous materials to a corner
of the site and capping it, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
None of the contaminants would seep into the groundwater because cement
would be injected into the soil to stop the irrigation. A 10-foot-high sodded
mound would cover about 35 acres. Cleanup would cost $9.4 million.<BR>
<BR>
The EPA proposal is being reviewed by the state Department of Environmental
Protection. A public hearing has been scheduled for 7 p.m. on May 17 at
Gulfside Elementary School in Holiday.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- With area water wars still at hand,
three legislators are working on a bill that they hope will pass through
the House Community Affairs Committee and make its way to the floor by the
end of next week, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Rep. Carl Littlefield, R-Dade City; Rep. R.Z. &quot;Sandy&quot; Safley,
R-Clearwater; and House Majority Leader Jim Davis, D-Tampa have been working
on a new water bill. But some area politicians aren't happy with the approach
and are concerned that the bill will be a complete surprise, different from
any bill already proposed.<BR>
<BR>
Littlefield told the Tribune that one idea presented in the bill is the
formation of a new commission of state lawmakers and area politicians. This
Water Supply Development Policy Commission would include 18 members and
be authorized to hold public hearings and to devise a water resource system
that keeps the Tampa area supplied without further damaging the environment.
The new commission wouldn't replace the West Coast Regional Water Supply
Authority or the Southwest Florida Water Management District.<BR>
<BR>
A previous bill sponsored by Sen. Jack Latvala would set minimum flows and
levels for lakes and rivers, but Littlefield told the Tribune they wouldn't
be specific enough to address the area's varied geography.<BR>
<BR>
The water wars stem from dried up lakes and wetlands, which Pasco and Hillsborough
residents and politicians blame on Pinellas County's use of the area water.
But Pinellas officials blame drought on the dried up water sources and claim
the pumping has been done under legal state permits.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>INGLIS -- (EnviroWorld) -- 13 property owners in Inglis have
been asked to leave their homes for almost three weeks so the Environmental
Protection Agency can remove the soil that is contaminated with lead and
arsenic, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
Tony Best, the environmental scientist coordinating the work for the EPA,
told the Sun the contamination was discovered last spring when an area homeowner
sent away a soil sample to be analyzed. The soil was found to contain high
levels of lead and arsenic. <BR>
<BR>
Federal workers discovered 522 parts per million of arsenic in areas with
the heaviest contamination - the government's tolerance is 0.7 parts per
million. The lead areas contaminated the most contained 6,756 parts per
million - the government's tolerance is 500 parts per million.<BR>
<BR>
The project is expected to cost $2.7 million and will be paid for with Superfund
cleanup money. 80 percent of the money will be spent on removing the soil
and hauling it to a specialized landfill. The remaining 20 percent will
be used to replace the soil, lawns and trees, in addition to providing housing
to residents while their yard is being worked on.<BR>
<BR>
It is believed the contamination is a result of Barker Chemical Co.'s import
of pyrite to make sulfur in the area 30 years ago.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- Congress passed a spending bill
on Thursday for fiscal 1996, which offered various cuts in funding to federal
agencies, but provides gentler cuts to environmental agencies, according
to the Associated Press. <BR>
<BR>
The bill was the product of grueling talks between the White House and Congress.
In the end, the administration had won $5 billion more than the House had
approved months ago - but still leaving spending for all federal agencies
$20 billion below 1995 levels, according to the nonpartisan Congressional
Budget Office. <BR>
<BR>
However, democrats preferred to focus on the money they restored which included
$305 million for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration - a 2
percent cut from last year instead of the 11 percent reduction the House
initially approved. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency will
receive $6.5 billion - $700 million less than it spent last year. The EPA
had been forced to cut back on inspection and enforcement activities because
of money shortages since October, but is expected to have additional funds
to deal with backlogs, according to administration sources.<BR>
<BR>
The bill was sent to President Clinton yesterday for his promised signature.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE --(EnviroWorld)-- Cecil Field Naval Air Station
received the Defense Department's top award for environmental restoration
for an innovative approach to its cleanup - a partnership of its contractors
and federal and state regulators that speeds up the process and saves money,
the Florida Times-Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
The base's Restoration Advisory Board is a 17-member community panel that
advises the base on cleanup issues. The board cuts down on the bureaucratic
and political redtape involved in a cleanup, said Steve Wilson, the Navy's
environmental coordinator for the Jacksonville base.<BR>
<BR>
In 1989, the base was placed on the Superfund list of the nation's most
polluted places. The pollution was a result of contamination from jet fuel,
paint strippers, grease, pesticides and other pollutants that have accumulated
since the base was commissioned in 1941. Reckless dumping during the 1950s,
'60s and '70s helped to contribute to the pollution.<BR>
<BR>
It is expected to take as long as 30 years and up to $100 million to finish
the cleanup.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Bilirakis and Thurman criticized for wildlife refuge vote</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG -- (EnviroWorld) -- U.S. Reps. Michael Bilirakis
(R) and Karen Thurman (D) were criticized by St. Petersburg Times writer
David Hackett because they voted for a bill called the National Wildlife
Refuge Improvement Act.<BR>
<BR>
One aspect of the bill is that it would make recreation one of the official
purposes of America's 508 national wildlife refuges. Environmentalists,
including Interior Secretary Bruce Babitt, oppose the bill because it could
allow commercial trapping on the refuges, weaken the government's ability
to expand the refuges, and enable military uses of the lands.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;None of this sounds consistent with what President Theodore Roosevelt
had in mind in 1903 when he authorized establishment of the first national
wildlife refuge at Florida's Pelican Island,&quot; Hackett writes. &quot;Today
national wildlife refuges exist primarily to preserve critical wildlife
habitat and species that depend upon it. Recreational activities are accommodated,
too, in fact quite liberally. ... But the mission of preservation comes
first. That means U.S. Fish and Wildlife officials can close parts of refuges
when it becomes necessary to protect habitat from activities incompatible
with preserving threatened and endangered species of<BR>
plants and animals.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Neither Thurman or Bilirakis would comment directly about their votes for
the bill. While Bilirakis' press secretary said that the congressman believed
in wildlife conservation, but also allowing people access to see wildlife,
he would not elaborate on why this particular bill was necessary.<BR>
<BR>
One of the examples of how the bill could endanger wildlife that Hackett
points out is at the refuge on Egmont Key. &quot;U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service officials are working on a well-advised plan to limit access to
the island, a plan that boating enthusiasts would be in a much better position
to thwart if the refuge bill were law today.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Thurman's press secretary said the representative believed it maintained
enough federal power for protection of wildlife, but that she may support
changes to the bill, which passed the House 287-138, if it reaches House-Senate
conference committee.</BLOCKQUOTE>

against cement plant</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Florida Chapter of the American
Lung Association has asked the Gainesville Sun not to use material in a
letter, written on the Association's letterhead, that is critical of a proposed
cement plant in western Alachua County.<BR>
<BR>
Residents near the proposed plant have engaged in a legal battle with the
company that wishes to build it, Florida Rock Industries. One of the residents'
concerns are emissions from the plant. While Florida Rock has promised to
use state-of-the-art pollution controls, plant opponents have been reluctant
to believe the company.<BR>
<BR>
The American Lung Association letter was written by environmental consultant
and ALA volunteer Alex Sagady. It was addressed to plant opponent Phyllis
Saarinen and states that Florida Rock's proposal does not use the best available
technology and that plant emissions could harm people sensitive to air quality
in the area. The letter was signed by ALA chapter executive director Sandra
Kessler.<BR>
<BR>
But Florida Rock officials complained that the letter was carelessly written
and asked for a retraction. Florida Rock Vice President Fred Cohrs told
the Sun, &quot;For the Lung Association to say it (an electrostatic precipitator)
is not the best available technology is totally inaccurate.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In response, Kessler asked the Gainesville Sun not to quote from the letter,
and said the the ALA would not take up the plant as one of its issues.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Florida budgets</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>BROOKSVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The various interests embroiled
in the Tampa Bay area's water wars have spent $3,522,410 on attorney and
witness costs since 1994, the Tampa Tribune reported. Expect the costs to
continue.<BR>
<BR>
St. Petersburg added $700,000 to its budget this month for its fight against
the Southwest Florida Water Management District, and West Coast Regional
Water Supply Authority is planning for an additional $265,000 tab through
October.<BR>
<BR>
The expenses began to accumulate on March 1, 1994. At that time, as the
heavily developed area began to draw so much water from its wellfields that
permanent environmental damage was feared, the Southwest Florida Water Management
District issued an emergency order to reduce water pumping. Pinellas County,
St. Petersburg, and West Coast, which is the area's main water supplier,
all sued to overturn the order. Since then, more lawsuits and challenges
have been filed, and officials say there is little chance for a compromise
at this point.<BR>
<BR>
The basic issue before the parties are four water-use permits for Pinellas
and West Coast with a minimum level clause. The permit would require that
pumping stop if water levels in the local aquifer drop below a set level.
An administrative hearing for the permits is set for July.<BR>
<BR>
It is possible that the sides may agree to abide by the findings of an impartial
scientific study. However, the complexities of arranging such a study hurt
such a proposal, the Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
The latest entrant to the fight is Hillsborough County, which is seeking
to protect its wellfields from overpumping.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Environmental Protection Agency at odds</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- A northwest Hillsborough developer's
strategy of &quot;divide and conquer&quot; may be working, the Tampa Tribune
reported.<BR>
<BR>
While state regulations enforced by the Southwest Florida Water Management
District would allow the developer to fill in some wetland property if a
greater amount of wetlands are restored elsewhere, the county Environmental
Protection Agency has issued a flat &quot;no&quot; on the proposal.<BR>
<BR>
So, the developer, Stephen Dibbs, has filed a lawsuit asking a circuit judge
to determine whose rules apply. The argument is that the county EPC can't
have rules which conflict with state regulations.<BR>
<BR>
While a Swiftmud official told the Tribune that the EPC could in fact have
different rules, the lawsuit touched off an argument between the agencies
over whose rules were tougher.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It must be bargain basement day at Swiftmud,&quot; EPC Executive Director
Roger Stewart told the Tribune. Swiftmud officials said their rules were
stricter, though, since a developer must restore more wetlands than they
destroy. EPC rules only require a one for one substitution, if allowed.<BR>
<BR>
Prior to the filing of the lawsuit, EPC staff had argued with the county's
attorney over a settlement offer from Dibbs which the EPC felt would limit
the agency's power. Dibbs wants to fill in three acres of wetlands on a
20-acre parcel.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>APOPKA--(EnviroWorld)--The Public Service Commission in Talahassee
will begin several weeks of hearings today in the Southern States Utilities
rate increase proposal, The Orlando Sentinel reported. The state's largest
water-sewer utility, is seeking an $18.1 million rate increase for its 152
water and sewer systems. <BR>
<BR>
Southern States serves more than 100,000 customers in 21 counties statewide,
including 34,000 households in Central Florida.<BR>
<BR>
PSC member, Diane Kiesling, has dubbed the proposed increase the most complex,
contentious water and sewer rate the state has ever seen. <BR>
<BR>
The utility claims that it needs the rate increase to pay for $100 million
in improvements to its water and sewer systems made in the past four years.
However, consumer attorneys will try to prove that the commission should
decrease Southern State's rates by $10.36 million.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WINTER HAVEN--(EnviroWorld)--A potential offer by U.S. Sugar
Corp. to buy some or all of the citrus holdings of Winter Park's Jack Berry
Corp. would be a huge deal, but wouldn't mean big changes to the juice industry,
reported The Orlando Sentinel. <BR>
<BR>
Harvey Heller, president of Heller Brothers Inc. in west Orange County,
and Stephen Caruso, president of Citrus World Inc. in Pole County, said
both U.S. Sugar and Berry are in the bulk orange-juice processing business
and their plants are relative neighbors west of Lake Okeechobee.<BR>
<BR>
The deal is currently in the talking stages, but if it does go through,
it would essentially be a consolidation.<BR>

think</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ST PETERSBURG--(EnviroWorld)--The oxygen-depleting marine toxin
red tide is the top suspect in the record numbers of manatee deaths in Southwest
Florida this year, reported The Orlando Sentinel. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The evidence is pretty compelling there is a connection,&quot; said
Alan Huff, who is helping to oversee the Department of Environmental Protection's
investigation of the die-off. <BR>
<BR>
Clues suggesting a red tide include high concentrations of the algae in
the affected zone of the Gulf of Mexico, on and off throughout the past
18 months. Lesions found on the lungs of dead manatees could mean that the
manatees inhaled the toxin. <BR>
<BR>
Experts speculate that the 152 manatees that have died since March 5 must
have gotten intense doses of red tide to die as fast as they did, within
two to three days. The animals may have inhaled the red tide toxin when
they came up for air. The toxin crashes against waves at the water's surface
and creates highly a concentrated aerosol, said Karen Stedinger, a red tide
researcher at the Florida Marine Research Institute. <BR>
<BR>
An unprecedented 251 manatees have died so far this year, already 45 more
than the record set in the entirety of 1990.</BLOCKQUOTE>

season</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>DAYTONA BEACH--(EnviroWorld)--This Wednesday marks the official
start of sea turtle nesting season, and Volusia County beach officials hope
they can accommodate both the turtles and the beach traffic, The Orlando
Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
In response to a federal lawsuit, Volusia County officials are working to
make the beach more turtle-friendly by the big day. To shelter the soft
sand where turtles typically nest, motorists driving and parking on the
beach will have to keep their cars at least 30 feet away from dunes and
sea walls along the coast. Posts will mark the 30-foot conservation zones
to help motorists steer clear of the areas. A $15 fine will punish violators.<BR>
<BR>
County officials hope to end the lawsuit by getting a habitat conservation
plan approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The plan would make
the driving rules more or less stringent on certain parts of the beach,
depending on sections where the most sea turtles nest.<BR>
<BR>
Also, county officials are working on parking alternatives near sections
of the beach where driving would be banned entirely under the plan. Included
are dozens of new parking spaces planned along the edges of county owned
roadways, including a stretch of Atlantic Avenue in Ponce Inlet. <BR>
<BR>
The sea turtle nesting season continues through the end of October.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)--Radian International LLC agreed last
week to drop nearly $15 million in contracts with the Environmental Protection
Agency, ENR reported.<BR>
<BR>
The decision came about in the wake of the EPA's probe into whether Radian's
corporate relationship with Dow Chemical Corporation is a conflict of interest.<BR>
<BR>
The contractor is now negotiating to sell its EPA contracting unit, but
hasn't yet confirmed a buyer, said Donald Carlton, Radian CEO. <BR>
<BR>
Carlton felt the issue was not going to be resolved. &quot;There was no
way to set aside EPA's perception of a conflict of interest. We could not
continue as a successful EPA contractor,&quot; he said. <BR>
<BR>
Radian had 13 separate accounts with EPA for technical support to the agency
in its development of several different environmental regulations. The EPA
had expressed concern over a possible conflict in Radian's work in developing
data to support a recently proposed rule limiting volatile organic compounds
in consumer products, including some made by Dow. <BR>
<BR>
EPA says that Radian has until June 15 to divest itself of agency contracts.
Carlton says the eventual sale will affect about 100 Radian employees.</BLOCKQUOTE>

land in high recharge areas</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>BROOKSVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Voters approved it eight years
ago, but a proposal to give property-tax breaks to owners of land important
to the state's water supply may finally become law, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Called bluebelt lands, property which lies in areas which provide high levels
of aquifer recharge could be assessed at discounted values if state lawmakers
approve a bill sponsored by Rep.Robert Sindler, D-Apopka. In general, high-recharge
areas are elevated lands with good soil drainage. To get the reduced appraisal
the land could not be developed except to have a single family home.<BR>
<BR>
Voters approved a constitutional amendment with the same effect in 1988,
but the legislature has so far failed to pass a law to put the amendment
into effect. Part of the problem has been whether counties should be reimbursed
for lost revenues. Sindler's bill gives counties the power to grant bluebelt
reductions, so state reimbursement is not considered.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>PALM BEACH -- (EnviroWorld) -- Donald Trump wants to build a
120-slip marina for Mar-a-Lago Club where members prefer boats to BMWs.
But the mayor says it could damage the environment, the Orlando Sentinel
reported.<BR>
<BR>
Trump filed an application with the Treasure Coast Regional Planning Council
to dredge sand from the shallow Intracoastal Waterway so boats can dock
along the club's pink wall. Trump said the marina would cost about $7 million
with dredged sand being used to widen the beach in front of the club.<BR>
<BR>
Mayor Paul Ilyinsky said he is concerned a marina would damage wildlife
and that the town doesn't need more docks. It already has about 78 slips,
while Palm Harbor Marina across the water has 160 slips.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>MIAMI -- (EnviroWorld) -- President Clinton expressed concern
about rapidly rising gasoline prices yesterday and ordered the Energy Department
to pump up the nation's fuel supplies, the Associated Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
The president authorized the &quot;orderly sales&quot; of about 12 million
barrels of oil from the nation's strategic petroleum reserves. Such a move
was authorized by Congress last week as part of an overall appropriations
bill.<BR>
<BR>
Sen. Bob Dole, Clinton's probable challenger in the presidential election,
said, &quot;I'm glad he's finally concerned about gas prices. I'm glad we
finally got his attention.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Gasoline prices jumped 5 cents per gallon in the past two weeks. The average
price of gasoline nationwide was $1.36 a gallon as of Friday.<BR>
<BR>
Further, Clinton said he was asking Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary to review
market circumstances and report within 45 days &quot;about the factors that
led to the run-up in prices.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

as agriculture</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- The House has approved a bill
that would classify clam farms, scallop beds and other underwater seafood
projects as agriculture, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
If Washington adopts the bill, residents who raise seafood and tropical
fish will be able to obtain the same federal benefits offered to farmers.
In addition, it would encourage private industry to develop aquaculture
businesses that would employ fishermen displaced by last year's net ban,
sponsors say.<BR>
<BR>
A similar bill is working its way through the Senate, sponsored by Charles
Bronson, R-Satellite Beach. Bronson told the Tribune that the plan is to
eventually create new jobs for some who lost their livelihoods to last year's
net ban.<BR>
<BR>
However, some environmentalists have criticized the attempt, saying the
bills would encourage projects that will pollute Florida's waterways. <BR>
<BR>
The bills would make some state-owned lands and water available for aquaculture
projects, and establish an aquaculture section within the Department of
Environmental Protection to coordinate permitting.<BR>
<BR>
But the bills don't clearly spell out what kinds of projects would be acceptable.
Oysters, clams and other &quot;filter feeders&quot; eat whatever comes along
and don't pollute underwater ecosystem, but fish kept in underwater cages
eat food that farmers bring in, which can cause damage, David Gluckman,
a spokesman for the Florida Wildlife Federation, told the Tribune.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;If you have to feed it, you're setting up a mini-sewage system that
can hurt the environment,&quot; Gluckman said.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO -- (EnviroWorld) -- A recent study by the Florida Game
and Fresh Water Fish Commission has determined that opossums are killed
by automobiles more often than any other creature, the Gainesville Sun reported.
This study will be presented at Florida's first Transportation Related Wildlife
Mortality seminar this week in Orlando. <BR>
<BR>
However, preventing the death of opossum's is low on the list compared to
other native Florida endangered animals.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What's killed most often is not necessarily what you're most interested
in saving,&quot; David Zeigler of the Department of Transportation told
the Sun. &quot;If you have 35 Florida panthers killed on the highway, and
3,000 armadillos, the armadillos certainly aren't a concern from a habitat
wildlife preservation viewpoint.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
John Wooding, a Gainesville-based biologist noted animal mortalites during
construction of an underpass on SR 46 near Sanford: 95 opossums, 74 raccoons,
25 rabbits, 22 armadillos, 20 gopher tortoises, and seven bears. Smaller
numbers of other animals were hit. Wooding will present his study at the
seminar.<BR>
<BR>
The meeting will present methods of slowing or preventing roadkill in threatened
or endangered species. More than 120 people are registered for the seminar,

The district had set a minimum level for Lake Brooklyn at 101 ft. above

the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
Officials now warn visitors and people who inquire about the park, at Boulware
Springs, about frequent thefts and vandalism to cars at the trail's parking
lot. The parking lot is well off the main road and hidden by trees. That
factor, coupled with the trail's low use -- only about 300 people a day
use the trail -- and closeness to poor neighborhoods are believed to contribute
to the high crime.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Hearings that are expected to
last several weeks began Monday as the Public Service Commission hears testimony
in what has come to be called &quot;Sewergate,&quot; the St. Petersburg
Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
At issue is a $18.1 million rate increase requested by Southern States Utilities
(SSU). The utility, which is parented by Minnesota Power, says it is not
making any money in Florida and must recover plant improvement costs of
more than $100 million. Residents served by SSU say the utility provides
poor service and many complain of substandard water quality.<BR>
<BR>
Public counsel Jack Shreve had asked that the case be thrown out because
of alleged misconduct by SSU. That issue concerned, in part, lobbying efforts
by SSU attorney Jeff Sharkey to have Governor Chiles intervene in the case.
Though the PSC would not dismiss the case, the misconduct arguments will
be allowed during the hearings. <BR>
<BR>
Shreve and other consumer attorneys on the case are asking that SSU's rates
be lowered by more than $10 million. SSU is the state's largest water and
wastewater utility, and serves customers in all parts of the state. A final
decision by the PSC is expected in August.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CLEARWATER --(EnviroWorld) -- While city officials and residents
all want to use reclaimed water, they can't figure out where to store it,
the St. Petersburg Times reported. Plans for the first phase of Clearwater's
reclaimed water system are nearly in place, but where the 5-million gallons
of water will go is causing a headache in the densely populated area.<BR>
<BR>
Most agree that the most economical place for storage would be three-story
tanks next to the plant where the sewage is treated. Residents of that neighborhood
have organized a strong opposition, however, and say the tanks would only
be an added eyesore to an already stinky and unattractive plant. In fact,
they are pushing to have the plant itself relocated -- at a cost of $75
to $100 million.<BR>
<BR>
Another option would be to store the water, which is mainly used for outdoor
watering purposes, in a planned downtown lake. But land acquisition and
soil cleanup necessary to start the project are a $6 million problem. Also,
the city's engineer warned city commissioners that ponds require more expensive
maintenance and don't last as long as tanks do.<BR>
<BR>
Finding other locations for the large storage tanks has so far stumped officials.
Because the tanks might negatively affect tourism in the areas that most
want the water -- Island Estates, Old Clearwater Bay, and Clearwater Beach
--it appears that the city has grown itself into a corner.</BLOCKQUOTE>

oil rights</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG -- (EnviroWorld) -- In the 1940's, the state
of Florida sold oil leases to its offshore land, a decision now haunting
state officials. Coastal Petroleum Co., which owns those leases, recently
won a Florida appeals court decision that puts them one step closer to drilling
within seven miles of the Gulf coast, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
State officials hope the company is bluffing.<BR>
<BR>
The court decision had to do with attempts by the government to require
Coastal to put up a $1.9 billion bond against environmental damages. But
Florida's First District Court of Appeals ruled that the Governor and Cabinet,
though designated as trustees of public lands, did not have the authority
to require that bond. Earlier court decisions found that the Department
of Environmental Protection also lacked that power.<BR>
<BR>
Assistant Attorney General Jon Glogau told the Times &quot;It may be that
the department (DEP) has to issue them a permit, which is something that
the state of Florida is not really thrilled about ... Actually, we're damned
unhappy about it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Coastal holds leases to a strip of land 425 miles long, from Naples to Apalachicola.
State officials believe that the company simply wants to prove that it can
drill there so that it can sell its leases back at a high profit.</BLOCKQUOTE>

in water war</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>BROOKSVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Southwest Florida Water
Management District (Swiftmud) has formally challenged that tactics of Pinellas
County's water attorney, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
The County is asking for an unusually large number of Requests for Admissions
from other entities in the water wars. The requests, or RFA's are documents
with specific statements that an adversary must agree or disagree with.
If Swiftmud agrees to a particular RFA, then Pinellas County won't have
to use court time to prove the statement. According to the Times, legal
experts said usually no more than 20 to 30 RFA's are allowed in a case.<BR>
<BR>
Pinellas County has requested 2,338 RFA's to Swiftmud alone. In addition,
the county's preliminary witness list contains 234 names, compared to 35
for Swiftmud and 40 for St. Petersburg.<BR>
<BR>
According to Swiftmud's objection, &quot;This tactic is oppressive, unduly
burdensome and beyond the realm of any notion of a reasonable attempt to
discover facts or narrow issues.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Pinellas County and other water suppliers in the Tampa Bay area are fighting
more restrictive water pumping permits from Swiftmud. The water management
district and officials in nearby counties with wellfields that supply bay-area
water believe that tighter restrictions are necessary to prevent permanent
environmental damage caused by overpumping.<BR>
<BR>
Pinellas County has rung up more than $2.4 million in legal fees since 1993
on water litigation -- a figure that's half the county budget for actual
water projects.<BR>
<BR>
Pinellas' water attorney, Ed de la Parte, told the Times that the legal
maneuver was necessary in such a complicated case, and, in the long run,
would save legal costs.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG -- (EnviroWorld) -- As some rural counties have
started banning sewage sludge imports from their urban neighbors -- sludge
which is sprayed onto open fields or mixed directly into soils -- counties
have begun to look for other ways to get rid of the smelly stuff. Tuesday
Pinellas County commissioners discussed two options for turning the sludge
into pellets that can be sold as fertilizer, the St. Pete Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Both options involve drying the sludge. The cheaper method requires trucking
the sludge to a composting facility, while the other way uses heat to speed
up the drying and creates a smaller pellet. Though costlier, the second
method was recommended by the county's utilities engineering director, Vic
Formby, because it would be less controversial than trucking and create
a more marketable product.<BR>
<BR>
The county would not directly sell the fertilizer pellets, but would contract
out for the privilege. The most famous sewage pellet product is Milorganite,
proudly produced by the residents of Milwaukee, and sold in many garden
shops. Formby estimated that a sludge-drying operation would cost Pinellas
about $2 million a year.</BLOCKQUOTE>

desire</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) --Tampa's Mayor Dick Greco recently expressed
a desire to prevent street flooding in a city where residents often complain
about poor drainage. But making real improvements could cost hundreds of
millions of dollars, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
City sanitary sewer director Ralph Metcalf told the Times that the kind
of large-scale improvements necessary to eliminate street flooding would
cost about $600 million.<BR>
<BR>
Currently, Tampa spends $3.89 million a year on drainage maintenance and
improvements. At that amount, the city figures it can keep 98 percent of
its buildings dry in a heavy storm -- 3.5 inches of rain in two hours.<BR>
<BR>
Metcalf said that first, city officials would have to determine how much
citizens would be willing to pay before they could decide how far drainage
improvements could go. Officials may want to ask residents that question
on a cloudy day. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;When it rains like hell, of course,&quot; Metcalf told the Times,
&quot;it's a higher priority.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ALTAMONTE SPRINGS--(EnviroWorld)--Water levels at Lake Orienta
have threatened to flood 90 lakefront buildings for the past three years,
and unless a proposal to pump some of the water out is passed, the problem
will continue, the Orlando Sentinel Reported. <BR>
<BR>
Aside from endangering the properties, the excess water is also responsible
for the closing of the city's only public boat ramp. &quot;There have been
times that the water was so high that it came within inches of homes,&quot;
city engineer Glenn Forrest said. <BR>
<BR>
The flooding is due to the fact that the lake is landlocked and there is
no connecting waterway into which water from Lake Orienta can naturally
flow. The problem can also be partially attributed to heavy rains during
the past few years.<BR>
<BR>
A $500,000 pump station to route some water from Lake Orienta eastward is
the proposed solution of City Officials. The water would exit through several
other lakes and creeks, ultimately passing into the St. John's River, and
finally out to the Atlantic Ocean.<BR>
<BR>
With approval, construction could begin as early as August and the station
could be operating by November. <BR>
<BR>
Altamonte officials expect the plan to be approved because they have worked
to ensure neighboring cities, Like Casselberry and other parts of Seminole
County, that the project will not have adverse effects on them.<BR>
<BR>
However, Casselberry opposes Altamonte's plan, fearing that the 2 million
gallons of water a day for six months out of the year sent into the city's
Gee Creek drainage basin would cause problems for Casselberry's Triplet
Lake chain. The city is concerned that the water would raise Casselberry
lake levels by 7 feet. Long term damage from moving that much water from
one water basin to another is another factor in the city's opposition to
Altamonte's proposal.<BR>
<BR>
Representatives with the St. John's River Water Management District, who
must approve the pumping plan, are scheduled to meet at 3 p.m. today at
the water district's Orlando office to discuss the proposal. Officials from
Casselberry and Seminole County are expected to be in attendance. </BLOCKQUOTE>

sought in House</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--On Tuesday, the state House sent
a bill to Gov. Lawton Chiles that would make laws on mangrove-trimming by
property owners stricter, reported the Tampa Tribune. The same measure was
passed by the senate on March.<BR>
<BR>
Concern had arisen that last year's bill was bad for the environment. The
1995 law allowed property owners to trim mangroves on their property and
adjacent lots without a permit. <BR>
<BR>
According to the new bill, people with trees 10 feet tall or shorter could
not trim them below 6 feet without a permit from the Department of Environmental
Protection. Also, under current law, property owners can trim trees up to
75 feet into the water, in front of their property. The new bill would reduce
that distance to 25 feet. <BR>
<BR>
The bill also prohibits the use of herbicides to remove leaves from mangroves,
and toughens penalties for violators.<BR>
<BR>
Mangroves provide homes for many forms of sea life, as well as acting as
natural barriers to beach erosion.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Everglades</STRONG> </A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>MIAMI--(EnviroWorld)--President Clinton pledged continued support
for Everglades restoration in a Miami meetingyesterday. Florida environmental
leaders attending the meeting included Winter Park-based Florida Audubon
Society president Clay Henderson, Everglades Trust Chair Mary Barley, Lt.
Governor Buddy MacKay, Nat Reed, and Jimmy Buffet, as well as South Florida
business leaders whose businesses depend upon a healthy Everglades. <BR>
<BR>
The group expressed their appreciation to the President for his commitment
to the Everglades Restoration. Included in his 1997 Budget is a penny per
pound assessment on Everglades' sugar to fund a massive clean-up of the
&quot;River of Grass.&quot; The group also thanked the President for the
intense federal efforts in South Florida as part of the restoration of the
Kissimmee River and Everglades ecosystem.<BR>
<BR>
Barley informed the president that environmental groups were pushing ahead
with a petition drive to amend the Florida Constitution to impose a penny
per pound assessment on sugar as called for in the Everglades Restoration
Plan. Karl Wickstrom, publisher of Florida Sportsman Magazine presented
the President with a new logo for the campaign showing a noose around south
Florida with the caption, &quot;loosen sugar's noose on the Everglades.&quot;
Clinton signed the logo and then added, &quot;Let's do it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Clinton pointed out the window to the hundreds of sugar employees protesting
outside the Biltmore Hotel. He noted that his administration had been responsible
for promoting new jobs and that &quot;we'll find them jobs too.&quot; </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>FT. LAUDERDALE--(EnviroWorld)--Now that Congress has decided
to kick an extra $200 million to $300 million into restoring the Everglades,
federal officials are asking whether you have any ideas about how it should
be spent, reported the Ft. Lauderdale Sun Sentinel. <BR>
<BR>
A series of meetings beginning this week will help shape the Everglades
restoration plan that federal scientists, engineers and bureaucrats have
been working on for three years.<BR>
While the outlines of that plan have been set, officials want to hear opinions
about exactly what should be done and in what order. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;This is not a process that says 'There's $200 million, what should
we spend it on?'&quot; said Terrence &quot;Rock&quot; Salt, executive director
of the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Interagency Task Force. &quot;You
can propose (an idea) and it will be considered in the context of the plan
we've been developing for three years.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The biggest question to be answered is whether the money will be used to
purchase sugar cane farms in western Palm Beach County -- the most controversial
part of the restoration plan -- or diverted to myriad other, less politically
risky uses.<BR>
<BR>
Among those could be overhauling the drainage system that blocks water from
flowing in natural patterns or purchasing land in far western Broward, Palm
Beach and Dade counties to buffer the Everglades and help conserve water.<BR>
<BR>
Many restoration ecologists say that, eventually, all or most of a long
list of projects will have to be completed if the Everglades is to be saved
from pollution and overdrainage.<BR>
<BR>
The meetings are scheduled Thursday in West Palm Beach, May 6 in Hollywood
and May 13 in Miami. For more information, call (305) 348-3095. </BLOCKQUOTE>

Bay water-war counties like compromise bill</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Tampa Bay may finally see the
white flag flying in the water wars if both houses pass a bill that area
lawmakers compromised on, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Hillsborough, Pinellas and Pasco lawmakers have agreed on a bill that calls
for the Southwest Florida Water Management District to set minimum water
levels in priority areas throughout the counties by Oct.1, 1997. The district
considers such levels when approving, curtailing or rejecting permits.<BR>
<BR>
A favored component of the bill for Pinellas lawmakers is the inclusion
of a scientific study on water levels and the impact of pumping. Hillsborough
and Pasco officials have claimed that area lakes and wetlands have dried-up
due to over-pumping from Pinellas County. But Pinellas claims that drought
is responsible.<BR>
<BR>
Other ideas in the compromise include a &quot;local sources first&quot;
idea, where the counties should produce more of their own water through
desalination or water reuse; that the West Coast Regional Water Supply Authority
will be asked to recommend to the legislature next year how the authority
should be run and what it should do about water supply; and a requirement
that water districts use a time-consuming method to set minimum water levels.<BR>
<BR>
The bill still must clear both houses by the end of the session Friday.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG -- (EnviroWorld) -- With red tide almost gone
in the Charlotte Harbor area and fewer manatee carcasses showing up, scientists
believe the manatee die-off may be over, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I think the die-off is tapering off,&quot; Bob Turner, of the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, told the Tribune. <BR>
<BR>
Turner, along with other scientists, believe that red tide, a natural marine
toxin produced by a microscopic organism, is to blame for the manatee deaths.
However, recent samplings show the red-tide producing algae is mostly gone
in the affected region. <BR>
<BR>
Red tide, which has been plaguing the coast on and off for the past 18 months,
can kill fish, sicken birds and irritate beachgoers' eyes and throats. The
cooler winter this year may have debilitated the manatees, making them more
vulnerable to the red tide. When a warm-water current came in with the red
tide, manatees were ready to feed, according to the Tribune.</BLOCKQUOTE>

waste problems</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- On April 19, EPA announced a
limited extension of a policy that relieves certain RCRA violators of punishment.
The &quot;Policy on Enforcement of RCRA Section 3004(j) Storage Prohibition
at Facilities Generating Mixed Radioactive/Hazardous Wastes,&quot; has been
extended until April 20, 1998. <BR>
<BR>
Because inadequate treatment technology and disposal capacity exists to
treat or dispose of many types of mixed waste, commercial generators and
many federal government agencies have little option but to store some of
these wastes until new technologies become available. Many mixed waste generators
may be subject to enforcement action or citizen suits even though it is
impossible for them to comply with the law. The extended policy clarifies
that a &quot;low enforcement priority&quot; applies only to mixed wastes
for as long as no treatment and disposal option exists.<BR>
<BR>
The policy states that violators who 1) are faced with an impossibility
of complying with the RCRA regulations and 2) are storing their wastes in
an environmentally responsible manner will be a low enforcement priority
for EPA. &quot;Mixed wastes&quot; contain both a hazardous waste and a radioactive
component. Hazardous wastes are subject to land disposal restrictions which
require generators to treat hazardous wastes to specified treatment standards
before they can be land disposed. <BR>
<BR>
RCRA section 3004(j) prohibits any storage of a land disposal prohibited
waste (including mixed waste) except &quot;for the purpose of the accumulation
of such quantities of hazardous waste as are necessary to facilitate proper
recovery, treatment or disposal.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
For additional information or to order paper copies of the FR notice, call
the RCRA<BR>
Hotline at 1-800-424-9346 or TDD 1-800-553-7672. The RCRA Hotline is open<BR>
Monday-Friday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.(EST).</BLOCKQUOTE>

says St. Pete water hosts a deadly parasite</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG -- (EnviroWorld) -- A study by the Washington-based
National Association of People with AIDS has listed 28 U.S. cities as &quot;high
risk&quot; for containing a deadly parasite in their water supply and St.
Petersburg was among those listed. However, city officials say the water
supply is safe despite the report, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
The parasite called cryptosporidium has caused problems in the past, more
notedly in Milwaukee, where in 1993, 110 people died from being infected
from the parasite and 400,000 became ill. Most who died were suffering from
immune-deficiency diseases such as AIDS.<BR>
<BR>
St. Petersburg officials say that because the water supply is from ground
water, not surface water, the risk of hosting this parasite is extremely
low. According to the Tribune, most cases of cryptosporidium occur when
cattle feces get into surface water, such as rivers or streams - the parasite
has a tougher time traveling into groundwater. <BR>
<BR>
The group that released the report said evaluations were based on testing
frequency, conditions allowing for the parasite and public information provided
by the water supply authorities.<BR>
<BR>
Associate Professor for marine sciences at the University of South Florida,
told the Tribune that St. Petersburg residents shouldn't worry about the
report, and the parasite usually occurs in groundwater only if there is
a problem with the well system.<BR>
<BR>
Robin Woods, a spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency, said
soon they will issue a rule that requires large water utilities to provide
testing for the parasite every 18 months. The data still must be reviewed

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- A compromise bill addressing
the Tampa Bay water wars unanimously passed the House on Thursday and is
expected to pass the Senate before the end of the session tonight, according
to the Tampa Tribune.<BR>
<BR>
The bill calls for setting minimum water levels for priority lakes, wetlands
and aquifers in Pasco, Hillsborough and Pinellas by Oct. 1, 1997. In addition,
a panel of independent scientists would study water levels and the impact
of pumping.<BR>
<BR>
Those involved in the bill agree that fighting won't stop in the Tampa Bay
area, but according to activists, at least it sends a message that something
needs to be done.<BR>
<BR>
The water wars began when Pasco and Hillsborough residents claimed that
Pinellas County's over-use of their water supply has caused area lakes and
wetlands to dry up. Pinellas disclaims any accusations, saying that drought
is the reason for the drying lakes and wetlands.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG -- (EnviroWorld) -- The city of St. Petersburg
is facing potential fines of nearly $1 million for polluting Tampa Bay and
Boca Ciega Bay last summer when heavy rains caused sewage overflows, the
Tampa Tribune reported. <BR>
<BR>
Between 25 and 54 million gallons of raw and partially treated sewage flowed
into the bays, resulting in high fecal coliform counts that forced beach
closings in St. Petersburg and nearby Gulfport. Officials from the Southwest
District of the state Department of Environmental Protection, which investigated
the spills, recommended St. Petersburg be fined $946,000.<BR>
<BR>
City officials were stung by the fine, saying the city is working hard to
correct damage to the sewer system. The city and Department of Environmental
Protection will most likely negotiate the fine and work out a plan that
could lower it or have the money applied to repairs.</BLOCKQUOTE>

to area water problems</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>BROOKSVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Edward de la Parte, the attorney
representing Pinellas County in a dispute over wellfield pumping permits,
has filed a request that the Southwest Florida Water Management District
admit to facts such as whether Pinellas runs a public water utility and
complex details of how the water district issues wellfield permits, the
Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
De la Parte said that if he doesn't get the information he wants, he will
call witnesses and present evidence to support those statements.<BR>
<BR>
On Friday, John Wilcox, a Tampa attorney representing the water district,
filed an objection to the request, calling it &quot;oppressive, unduly,
burdensome and beyond the realm of any notion of a reasonable attempt to
discover facts or narrow issues.&quot; He also said the number of facts
de la Parte is asking for would bury the district's attorneys, leaving no
time to prepare for the July hearing.<BR>

up gas tanks</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--Gov. Lawton Chiles said Thursday
that he would sign a bill aiming to clean up underground tanks tainting
Florida's groundwater with petroleum, The Orlando Sentinel reported. <BR>
<BR>
The measure, (HB 1127), passed by the state Senate and sent to Chiles, still
calls on taxpayers rather than oil companies to pay to prevent leakage from
tanks into drinking water.<BR>
<BR>
Chiles is hopeful that the Senate has passed a good bill, compared to last
year when he was forced to shut down all but emergency cleanups when the
project claims amounted to a $250 million deficit.<BR>
<BR>
Currently, tank cleanups are funded by a 2-cent-a-gallon tax that raises
about $160 million a year. The new bill would authorize using $65 million
of that money to finance a six-year $350 million bond-borrowing effort to
combat the estimated backlog of $323.5 million in cleanup reimbursements.<BR>
<BR>
The rest of the $160 million would be divided between $35 million a year
for new cleanup projects, and $60 million a year to the Department of Environmental
Protection for administrative costs and cleanups on the part of the state,
rather than private contractors.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>SANFORD--(EnviroWorld)--For over 50 years, the Jamaican iguana
was thought to have disappeared. Now the species is crawling back from the
brink of extinction with the aid of a breeding program at the Central Florida
Zoo, reported the Orlando Sentinel.<BR>
<BR>
The iguanas had been basically written off until their rediscovery in 1990
in the Hellshire Hills of southeast Jamaica. <BR>
<BR>
Fred Antonio, the zoo's head curator, likened the find to the hypothetic
rediscovery of a dinosaur.<BR>

Committee and the EPA Region 6 office. <BR>
<BR>
Landowners and lenders will be absolved of liability for previous contamination
under the<BR>

over wastewater treatment patent earns man a stint on chain-gang</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>LAKE BUTLER -- (EnviroWorld) -- A former University of South
Florida student who was awarded a patent and a prison term for a technique
to improve wastewater treatment efficiency is back in court, the Associated
Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
USF filed charges of grand theft and theft of trade secrets against Petr
Taborsky in 1989 after the former chemistry student was awarded a patent
for the use of superheated Clinoptilolite in treatment systems. Clinoptilolite
is a clay used in cat litter.<BR>
<BR>
A Hillsborough County jury convicted Taborsky of stealing trade secrets
and two notebooks, and sentenced him to one year's house arrest and 15 years
probation. But in 1992, when Taborsky won the patent, he refused to sign
it over to USF and was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison for violation
of probation. That term included eight weeks on a chain gang.<BR>
<BR>
Now Taborsky says new documents have emerged since his original trial which
challenge court testimony by the engineering professor who oversaw his work.
The professor and Taborsky both claim to be primary researcher for the technique
that removes ammonium from waste water.</BLOCKQUOTE>

off energy-conservation hook</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Among the legislation passed
on the final day of the session last week was a tiny amendment on energy
conservation that went under the noses of many that would have opposed it,
the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
The amendment reduces the number of companies that must comply with the
Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act. The Act requires companies to perform
an extensive evaluation of energy conservation programs and report on their
progress. The amendment slashes the list of companies from 23 to eight.
Gainesville and Tallahassee's municipal utilities are among those no longer
required to comply with the act.<BR>
<BR>
The same measure was defeated last year when more overt means were used
to attempt to pass it. Jim Davis, D-Tampa was a key player in backing environmentalists
opposed to the law then, but there appears to be little he could have done
last week. The amendment was added to a bill the ensured the Department
of Environmental Protection's trust funds would not expire.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;(The amendment's) not good,&quot; Davis told the Times, &quot;It's
a step backwards. The last thing the Legislature needs to do is back off
energy conservation, especially when fuel prices are about to go up.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Florida Senate passed its
version of a House bill covering water issues in Southwestern Florida on
the last day of the legislative session, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Just about anything controversial was removed from the final version of
the bill, which was sponsored by Sen. Jack Latvala (R-Palm Harbor) and Sen.
Ginny Brown-Waite (R-Spring Hill).<BR>
<BR>
The bill calls for minimum levels to be set on the most important lakes,
wetlands and aquifers in the Tampa Bay area. That should eventually allow
water managers to set limits on pumping from wellfields. One concession
made to ensure the bill's passage was that Pasco, Hillsborough and Pinellas
officials all agreed to abide by an independent scientific study of area
water levels to be used in setting the minimum levels.<BR>
<BR>
A provision that didn't survive was the &quot;local sources first&quot;
rule, which required water-users to exhaust all local water source options
before seeking outside water sources.<BR>
<BR>
Tampa Bay lawmakers conceded the bill would not come close to solving the
area's water wars, but expressed optimism that it was a move in the right
direction.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CRYSTAL RIVER -- (EnviroWorld) -- A coalition of more than a
dozen environmental groups has been writing legislators in an attempt to
stop passage of the National Wildlife Refuge Improvement Act, the St. Petersburg
Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
The Act passed the U.S. House of Representatives with bipartisan support
two weeks ago, but has not yet been brought before the Senate. The bill's
outward intention is to make access to National Wildlife Refuges easier
for a variety of recreation uses, including hunting and bird-watching. But
bill detractors say it will drain power from the government agencies to
protect wildlife from potentially harmful human uses. <BR>
<BR>
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is openly opposed to the act. Cameron
Shaw, manager of the Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge and a Service
employee, told the Times, &quot;The reserves are designated places for wildlife.
They are not parks.&quot; Shaw said the bill could take money away from
conservation efforts.<BR>
<BR>
Rep. Karen Thurman, D-Florida, who voted for the bill, said, &quot;Compatible
recreational uses are already allowed on these lands. The only difference
is this legislation would make it incumbent upon Fish and Wildlife to prove
why a certain activity is not compatible. ... These lands belong to the
public. They should be open for public use.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt is also opposed to the bill and
has asked President Clinton to veto it, should it come to the President's
desk.</BLOCKQUOTE>

environmental victories</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- In the closing hours of the
1996 Legislative Session, Florida's environmental causes won several battles.
Environmental highlights of the session included passage of the following
bills:<BR>
<BR>
Underground Tanks Reform, (SB1878), restructures underground petroleum storage
tank cleanup program and creates the Inland Protection Corporation. This
bill designates $65 million to pay existing cleanup debts; allows DEP to
prioritize the list of clean up sites; and marks $35 million for new site
cleanups.<BR>
<BR>
Restoration of Lake Apopka, (CSHB 2411/SB 2954), provides $20 million -
$12 million from the DEP and $8 million from the St. Johns Water Management
District - to initiate restoration efforts and land acquisition around Lake
Apopka; set phosphorus discharge limits, and provide for construction of
certain stormwater management systems.<BR>
<BR>
Environmental Lands, (CSSB 770), reauthorizes the nation's most aggressive
land acquisition program, Preservation 2000, including all smaller initiatives
like Rails-to-Trails, etc. It also creates a state tax exemption status
for park-related citizen support organizations.<BR>
<BR>
Mitigation Banking, (HB 715), represents a compromise between DEP, DOT and
Water Management Districts that balance growth with environmental preservation.
It consolidates all of DOT's mitigation into a single plan, giving DEP the
opportunity to develop long-range restoration priorities.<BR>
<BR>
Mangrove Trimming Reform, (SB 508), reforms last years' legislation and
places more stringent limits on mangrove trimming activities.<BR>
<BR>
Aquaculture Permitting, (HB 605), creates a new permitting process for aquaculture
farmers, establishes advisory council and calls for studies to evaluate
when and where aquaculture activities would fit into ecosystem management
objectives.<BR>
<BR>
Partnership in Parks, (CSSB 46), creates a matching grant program to use
public monies to match private donations designated for park development,
capital improvements and park operating costs. It also creates a state tax
exemption status for park-related citizen support organizations.<BR>
<BR>
Boating Safety Legislation, (HB 755), requires persons under the age of
16 to complete a boating safety education course prior to operating a marine
vessel with 10 or more horsepower. An 8-hour safety course is also required.
Violators will face a $50 fine.<BR>
<BR>
Beach Renourishment Projects provides appropriations of $15 million for
traditional beach renourishment projects in Sand Key, Boca Raton, Captiva,
Longboat Key and Venice. In addition $31.8 million is designated for beach
and dune recovery in the Florida Panhandle areas affected by Hurricane Opal.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>FORT LAUDERDALE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Across South Florida, authorities
have launched a campaign to expunge exotic plants that don't belong in the
Sunshine State and some home owners aren't happy, according to the Associated
Press.<BR>
<BR>
Many plants, such as melaleuca trees and royal poncianas were imported by
horticulturists or by accident on planes or ships and now they are dominating
native Florida plant life and animals. Residents, however, have become used
to the plants, which sometimes form privacy-promoting walls throughout their
property.<BR>
<BR>
Vicky Pestrichelli said she saw her once-rural Broward County neighborhood
transformed when a roadside row of melaleuca trees was chopped down. &quot;Now
I'm looking out my kitchen window and seeing Waterbed City trucks and all
the rest go by. It's horrible,&quot; Pestrichelli said.<BR>
<BR>
Ecologists, however, say that by eradicating the non-native species, the
cities and suburbs will be returned to &quot;The Real Florida,&quot; as
it's dubbed by the Florida Park Service.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Exotic species are like a cancer,&quot; says Frank Mazzotti, a University
of Florida researcher based in Davie. &quot;What (we're) seeing is the surgery.
We need to have time for the scar to heal and the system to begin functioning
normally.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. MARYS, Ga. -- (EnviroWorld) -- At Kings Bay Naval Submarine
Base, it is possible that nature and the military can coexist, the Florida
Times Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
The military base has given Paul Schonfeld, fish and wildlife manager at
Kings Bay, the important job of keeping Ospreys and other nesting birds
from building homes in the wrong places, but allowing them to do whatever
they want on nearly 16,000 acres of the land. An estimated 30 pairs of ospreys
live on the base already and according to Schonfeld, the birds have built
nests on 15 of 25 man-made platforms, with the remaining nests in trees.<BR>
<BR>
The main concern is Osprey's building nests on antennas and warning towers.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;An osprey nest built atop an antenna can interfere with communications
between the base and the Trident submarines,&quot; Schonfeld told the Times
Union. &quot;But our biggest concern is that these nests can block aircraft
warning lights.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
To solve the problem, wildlife workers built Plexiglas pyramids atop antennas
to prevent the ospreys form building nests.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to keeping an eye on the ospreys, wildlife management workers
at the base have built birdhouses and nesting platforms, wood duck boxes,
man-made saltwater swamps and freshwater ponds.<BR>
<BR>

year</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--Florida's Governor Lawton Chiles'
selection to chair the state's top environmental rulemaking body passed
his tortuous confirmation process in the state Senate this year--only to
have to repeat it next year.<BR>
<BR>
The full Senate did not vote on his confirmation to the Environmental Regulation
Commission despite two favorable committee recommendations, opting instead
to temporarily pass him for one year. Batchelor will return next year for
Senate confirmation after the Governor reappoints him to the job.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Now I'm seasoned,&quot; Batchelor said of a confirmation process which
drew unprecedented personal attacks.<BR>
<BR>
Of the criticisms leveled at him, Batchelor said he takes to heart the charge
that meetings are too long.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'll shorten the meetings but not at the expense of unfettered access
to testimony that any party may seek.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Batchelor did vow to begin hearings aimed at &quot;understanding the complex
issues relevant to the phosphorus rule&quot; that would set limits on this
nutrient being discharged by sugar growers north of the Everglades.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We can't just wait until the Department of Environmental Protection
brings us a rule to start understanding it,&quot; Batchelor told EnviroWorld.
&quot;I'm not convinced it will take five years to pass it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Batchelor was criticized by U.S. Sugar Corp. this Spring as being closed
minded to their interests. The sugar giant openly opposed his confirmation.<BR>
<BR>
Batchelor has set the first phosphorus rule briefing for the ERC's meeting
June 27 in Palm Beach.</BLOCKQUOTE>

finds no decrease in sperm quality among certain American men</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO -- (EnviroWorld) -- A study of semen samples in Los
Angeles, New York and Roseville, Minn. has found no evidence of a decline
in sperm quality during the last 25 years, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
The study bucks a number of other studies that show sperm counts and semen
quality have been declining worldwide during the past 50 years. Some scientists
have hypothesized that those declines could be the result of widespread
environmental pollutants.<BR>
<BR>
The study, led by Dr. Harry Fisch of the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center
in New York, analyzed semen samples from 1,283 men who were scheduling vasectomies.<BR>
<BR>
The findings were presented by researcher Eric Goluboff at the annual meeting
of the American Urological Association.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Other studies that described (declining sperm counts) have been fraught
with patient-selection and geographic biases,&quot; Goluboff said. &quot;There
are marked United States and worldwide variations of sperm counts, with
the counts highest in New York and lowest in the Third World countries.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But other researchers said the recent study had some biases of it's own.
Because the semen came from men who were having vasectomies and who, for
the most part, had fathered children, their sperm quality would be expected
to be better.<BR>
<BR>
Dr. Marc Goldstein, director of the center for Male Reproductive Medicine
and Microsurgery at Cornell Medical Center in New York, told the Sun, &quot;I'm
not sure what this data really means. One would have to do semen analysis
randomly on a cross section of the population as a whole in order to determine
whether there had really been any change in semen quality over time.&quot;<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Staff of the Alachua County
Commission are promoting a solution to the county's shortage of landfill
space, the Gainesville Sun reported. Although the county's Southwest Landfill
is nearly full according to present permitted limits, stacking garbage an
additional 55 feet higher shouldn't be a problem, staff members told commissioners
at a Monday meeting.<BR>
<BR>
For a small cost to obtain new permits, the county could extend the life
of the landfill through 2002 and save $7 million. Although that would create
a 100 foot tall mound, County Public Works Director Ed Culpepper showed
computer enhanced pictures that showed how well planted trees could shield
the view from residents.<BR>
<BR>
Some commissioners were reluctant to extend the life of the landfill, however,
as residents in the nearby community of Archer complained that they had
been promised the dump would close in 1998.<BR>
<BR>
No timetable for making a decision on stacking the garbage was set.<BR>
<BR>
Six companies have offered bids to provide waste disposal for Alachua County
in the future, and estimates for the cost of a new landfill run from $11
million to $16 million. The County will begin reviewing the proposals next
week.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- A construction company that
made a deal to pay a fine and do community service in order to erase felony
dumping charges, plans to hire high school students to perform the work,
the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
White Construction, a Chiefland-based road construction company, agreed
to pay $150,000 and do 50 hours of community service in connection with
illegal dumps found at property the company owns in Newberry.<BR>
<BR>
The dumps contained a variety of debris from road construction operations.
Company officials claimed the materials were going to be recycled, however
they lacked necessary permits to keep the debris at the site. The case worried
Alachua County environmental officials because the dump site was next to
open-water pits that provided direct connection to the aquifer.<BR>
<BR>
Though officials admitted they did not expect White Construction's owner,
Luther White, to personally perform the community service, they did hope
the company would send a better message to potential polluters.</BLOCKQUOTE>

dumps</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- State legislators passed a bill
tightening environmental regulations on construction and demolition dumps
as the session closed Saturday, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
Though most construction debris would seem relatively harmless, inspections
over the past few years have turned up a number of hazardous wastes at &quot;C
&amp; D&quot; dumps. Items such as car batteries, mercury-containing fluorescent
light bulbs and paint have been found at some sites. C &amp; D dumps, which
are expected to contain mostly vegetation, concrete, and wood, are not required
to have liners.<BR>
<BR>
Though the new law will not mandate liners, it will require groundwater
monitoring at dump sites, training of waste employees, and tougher examinations
of permit applications.<BR>
<BR>
The law was supported by the Florida Homebuilder's Association because it
will minimize the need for local communities to write their own, potentially
stricter, laws on the dumps.<BR>
<BR>
Chris Bird, of the Alachua County Environmental Protection Department, told
the Sun that Florida's new law still wasn't as tough as in many other states'
and though it was &quot;a step in the right direction, in my professional
opinion, I don't think it goes far enough.&quot;<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- An oil company embroiled in
a multi-faceted fight with the state of Florida over offshore oil, added
another dimension Monday, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Coastal Petroleum, Inc., a Lykes Brothers-backed company, is suing over
royalties it says were lost when Florida banned offshore oil drilling in
1990. In 1976 the company received royalty rights from the state for any
profits derived from drilling along a stretch of Gulf coast from Naples
to Apalachicola. Coastal is arguing that the 1990 ban amounts to a &quot;taking&quot;
of profits that it expected to make on the deal.<BR>
<BR>
The state argues that the company was fully aware that drilling might never
occur in the area when it made the deal.<BR>
<BR>
The case was originally dismissed in 1993, but an appeals court overturned
that ruling, bringing the situation to its present standing.<BR>
<BR>
In other lawsuits, the company is attempting to get permission to drill
for oil off Florida's coast in the areas it has leased. It has been speculated
that the company is not so much interested in drilling as it is in getting
the state to buy back the oil rights, at a large profit for Coastal.<BR>
<BR>
Coastal attorneys wouldn't reveal how much money the &quot;takings&quot;
suit is asking for.</BLOCKQUOTE>

on Captiva Island</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CAPTIVA ISLAND -- (EnviroWorld) -- Mariner Properties Development
Inc. has signed a contract for the purchase of nearly a quarter of Buck
Key, a 325-acre island near Captiva Island, to build 32 homes. The company's
president Ray Pavelka, however, says he's willing to sell the land to conservationists
at a discount, the Associated Press reported. <BR>
<BR>
The catch is that Pavelka wants conservationists and concerned residents
of adjacent Captiva Island to help Mariner transfer its Buck Key development
rights in order to build on Captiva Island.<BR>
<BR>
Buck Key is the site of a Calusa Indian village that now mostly belongs
to the J.N. &quot;Ding&quot; Darling National Wildlife Refuge. Mariner acquired
the tract of land from Ted Watrous for $3.8 million after 12 years of negotiating.
Conservationists who have tried for years to buy the Watrous site are concerned
with the situation.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;A lot of people are really upset,&quot; said Ann Bruning, Captiva
resident and Buck Key visitor since 1944, &quot;but we just don't know what
we can do about it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In March, the Captiva Civic Association Board officially announced it opposes
any development on Buck Key, or any transfer of development rights that
would increase Captiva's three-homes-per-acre density limit.<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service might be interested in buying the Buck
Key land, but not if it means building on environmentally sensitive land
on Captiva, refuge manager Lou Hinds said.<BR>
<BR>
Should no agreement be reached, Pavelka said Mariner would go ahead and
develop Buck Key - and feel good about doing it.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We develop with the environment in mind,&quot; he said. &quot;And
if we didn't develop it, someone else would.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

Authority will hold a public hearing Wednesday afternoon and evening to

The road will stretch from U.S. Highway 441 in Apopka to Interstate 4 south

13 businesses and part of a cemetery. <BR>
<BR>
No construction date has been set, but the authority has spent nearly $20
million to purchase land for the project. In addition, the state's legislature
approved a financing package that would provide another $20 million for
more land.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>SHADY HILLS -- (EnviroWorld) -- Construction of the Suncoast
Expressway hasn't even begun, but business interests are already scoping
out the area. Waste Management has spent more than $1 million to build a
new facility on 19 acres not far from the spot where the planned expressway
will intersect State Road 52, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Waste Management currently leases a facility on State Road 54 in Odessa,
but the lease is almost up and Phil Bader, the company's division vice president,
saw the new site was a wonderful opportunity for the firm.<BR>
<BR>
Like other business people, Bader told the Times he thinks the area around
the intersection of State Road 52 and the parkway will become a hub for
commercial and light industrial businesses.<BR>
<BR>
The proposed site still must be approved for rezoning from residential to
commercial by the Planning Commission. The request will be reviewed on Wednesday,
then considered by the Board of County Commissioners on May 29.<BR>
<BR>
If approved, construction of the new facility will begin in June. The facility
will include 16,000 feet of office space along with maintenance and parking
for 45 collection vehicles. In addition, Waste Management will operate a
cardboard recycling transfer station at the new site.</BLOCKQUOTE>

victim tells EPA: 'We are going to hang together or die together'</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>PENSACOLA--(EnviroWorld)-- Pensacola resident Anna Smith told
the Environmental Protection Agency she would not except their offer to
move into a dioxin-free home unless residents in surrounding communities
also got new homes, the Orlando Sentinel reported. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are going to hang together or we are going to die together,&quot;
said Smith, a member of Citizens Against Toxic Exposure who urge an all-or-nothing
stand. &quot;Hell can't be any worse than this.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Smith and other members of CATE are unsatisfied with the EPA's proposal
of moving only 66 of the most affected households away from &quot;Mount
Dioxin&quot;, a waste site whose soil is contaminated with the highly carcinogenic
industrial byproduct.<BR>
<BR>
The EPA says that moving all 350 homes would cost about $23 million, an
amount that would set new precedents in government Superfund cleanup sites.
<BR>
<BR>
The EPA is still undecided on how to clean up the abandoned site of Escambia
Wood Treating Co. plant, a.k.a. Mount Dioxin.<BR>
<BR>
Until it is cleaned, Smith said she will keep her windows closed to keep
the out contaminants.</BLOCKQUOTE>

customer interaction, remote control</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG -- (EnviroWorld) -- Florida Power Corp. is taking
its first steps into the next generation of power, the St. Petersburg Times
reported. Teaming up with the telecommunications manufacturer Scientific-Atlanta
Inc., the utility company is installing devices on 1,000 of its customer's
electrical meters.<BR>
<BR>
The devices will allow the company to read meters, shut off power, and detect
tampering remotely. While those capabilities don't offer much to the consumer,
ultimately such communication abilities may allow people to save money by
becoming energy management systems. Customers could interact with their
utilities to have large appliances turned off when unneeded, and the devices
could provide a single access point for all home communication needs.<BR>
<BR>
As deregulation comes to the utility industry, this kind of technology becomes
even more valuable. For instance, today the Public Service Commission is
set to rule on a plan by Florida Power to provide variable rates for electricity
to industrial customers depending on the time of day. Now customers pay
the same rate throughout the day, but if variable rates are allowed, a customer
could benefit by reducing power use during the most costly rate times.<BR>
<BR>
Tampa's TECO Energy has been testing a similar product for nearly a year,
the Times reports.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG -- (EnviroWorld) -- Complaints to the Public
Service Commission about Florida Power Corp. more than doubled from 1994
to 1995, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Records show 618 complaints were filed in 1995, compared to 295 in 1994.
About one in six problems were with billing, the Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Florida Power Spokeswoman Karen Raihill attributed most of the complaints
to glitches in a new customer service computer. Other problems were caused
by rougher than normal weather last year, and company downsizing that eliminated
1,000 jobs over a couple of years, leading to longer response times by both
technicians and phone operators.<BR>

To fix billing and service errors, Florida Power paid customers about $7,000

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Florida Audubon will be celebrating
International Migratory Bird Day with the 11th annual Baby Owl Shower on
May 11.<BR>
<BR>
At least 141 species of birds -- one-fifth of the bird species in North
America -- stop in Florida during their spring migration from the tropics.
Among these travelers are swallow-tailed kites, painted buntings, assorted
warblers, wood thrushes, cuckoos, grosbeaks, hummingbirds, and flycatchers.
As habitat continues to diminish for these birds, resulting in population
declines, the Audubon society stresses the importance involvement in conservation
efforts.<BR>
<BR>
The event will be held at Audubon's Center for Birds of Prey in Maitland
from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and will feature the center's own migratory birds
-- raptors -- and their babies. The center is located on Lake Sybelia Drive.

<BLOCKQUOTE>INDIAN SHORES -- (EnviroWorld) -- Workers at the Suncoast Seabird
Sanctuary released 160 cormorants Tuesday, the St. Petersburg Times reported.
The birds had been recovering from neurological disorders thought to be
connected to red tide.<BR>
<BR>
Since Jan. 20, hundreds of birds were rescued along the Gulf coast from
Sarasota to Tarpon Springs. Mike Del Grosso, a lab technician at the sanctuary,
told the Times that the birds were &quot;dehydrated, overheated, sort of
drunk acting. Some died. Others were treated, observed, recovered and released.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The birds' illnesses coincided with the epidemic of manatee deaths, which
some scientists believe were also caused by Red Tide. Barbara Soto, the
sanctuary's hospital supervisor, said that over the past 14 years, the cormorants
have always had illnesses whenever there were Red Tides.<BR>
<BR>
Red Tide results from toxins in the water produced by marine algae called
dinoflagellates. The dinoflagellates bloom periodically, but scientists

SSU overtures</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- As hearings in Southern States
Utilities request for an $18 million rate increase continue -- a case that
has come to be known as &quot;Sewergate&quot; -- lawyers fighting the increase
are providing evidence of SSU's lobbying efforts, the St. Petersburg Times
reported.<BR>
<BR>
The latest revelation, in Public Counsel Jack Shreve's attempt to show a
pattern of misconduct, is that SSU lobbyist Tracy Smith tried to get Sen.
Karen Johnson, D- Leesburg, to sign a letter of complaint against the Public
Service Commission (PSC) regarding an earlier rate case of SSU's. Sen. Johnson
refused to sign.<BR>
<BR>
The PSC has authority on regulatory issues governing the state's utility
companies and is presiding over the current hearings. The earlier case dealt
with a request by SSU to charge uniform rates for its customers all across
the state. In denying that request, the PSC was simply acting on a order
from the first district Court of Appeal, however the SSU letter only criticized
the PSC.<BR>
<BR>
Jack Shreve said the letter was evidence that SSU &quot;was trying to have
ex parte communications and influence the commission.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
SSU officials have also been heavily criticized for getting Lt. Gov. Buddy
MacKay and Commerce Secretary Charles Dusseault to send letters asking the
PSC to support SSU. <BR>
<BR>
Shreve and Deputy Public Counsel Charlie Beck have asked the PSC deny the
rate increase on misconduct grounds and further penalize the company by
reducing its profits. A decision by the PSC is expected late this summer.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO--(EnviroWorld)-- U.S. District Judge Anne Conway heard

on Volusia County beaches Tuesday, The Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
Leslie Blackner, the attorney representing two New Smyrna residents who
do not believe officials are doing enough to protect turtle zones, suggested
wire cable as a physical barrier to protect turtle nesting areas during

of cars trespassing the zones and claimed tickets and towing are not enough
to secure the area.<BR>
<BR>
Jeffrey Keiner, a private attorney representing the county government, said
some of the videos and photos are misleading because some of the cars may
have been issued tickets or towed. Keiner said county officials have complied
with Conway's previous order that instructed them to keep cars out of 30-foot
zones from the May-to-October turtle nesting season.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA--(EnviroWorld)-- A public hearing that would have addressed
the role of state officials on swamp areas was canceled Tuesday by Hillsborough
commissioners, reported the St. Petersburg Times.<BR>
<BR>
The commissioners, acting as the county's Environmental Protection Commission
(EPC), decided to get the opinion of a board of citizens advisers instead.
<BR>
<BR>
The hearing had been incited by Tampa developer Steve Dibbs, who plans to

issue is whether EPC rulings must be compatible with the rules of state
agencies. The EPC had previously denied Dibbs request to develop the 3-acre

<BR>
Dibbs wants the Southwest Florida Water Management District to oversee his
project because he believes they are more lenient than the EPC staff.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>DAYTONA BEACH--(EnviroWorld)--Mayor Bud Asher said Wednesday
that he will not put a request to ban beach driving on a small stretch of
Daytona Beach to comply with the City Commision's agenda, reported the Orlando
Sentinel. <BR>
<BR>
The development group Ocean Walk Properties LTD has expressed interest in
building hotels, restaurants and entertainment in a four-block area of Daytona's
tourist district. <BR>
<BR>
On Tuesday, developers attached a condition to their $100 million redevelopment
project: The city must ban driving on the four-tenths of a mile stretch
of shoreline adjacent to the redevelopment site.<BR>
<BR>
Asher said that he hoped the developers would withdraw the request to ban
beach driving, but continue to negotiate a development agreement for the
neighborhood. <BR>
<BR>
He went on to say that the city shouldn't be asked to consider the ban because
a debate over beach driving could polarize the community. Asher said that
the no-driving proposal could still appear on the commissioner's agenda
but only if one or more commissioners specifically asked him to put it there.

<BLOCKQUOTE>HUDSON--(EnviroWorld)--With the hot months of summer comes a
problem for residents along canals west of U.S. 19. Seasonal downpours will
flood septic tanks in neighborhoods, washing untreated sewage into homes,
yards, streets, and waterways, according to an editorial in the St. Petersburg
Times.<BR>
<BR>
Hudson Utilities, the privately owned company franchised to serve Hudson,
hopes to obtain credit needed to resume a stalled sewer project in the area.
The terms are dependent upon Pasco County allowing the utilities company
to slap property liens on homeowners who flout the state law by refusing
to connect and pay fees. <BR>
<BR>
Hudson Utilities' lender, Hough &amp; Co., said last year that it would
lend no more money to the sewer project until 150 recalcitrant homeowners
were forced to comply with state law. <BR>
<BR>
The editorial stated that although it is unclear whether these actions could
persuade the lender to reapprove credit for the project, it is the county's
duty to its citizens to try.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Florida is known for the Everglades,
coral reefs, beaches and cacti. That's right,cacti, an endangered species,
and foreign moths are contributing to its demise, the Florida Times Union
reported.<BR>
<BR>
Scientists know of only 13 semaphore cacti in the wild, which exists in
the Keys and is one of the six species of prickly pears native to Florida.
The plants can be ravaged by the larvae of caterpillars of the Cactoblastis
moth, the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission warned yesterday.<BR>
<BR>
To protect the semaphore cacti, environmentalists from The Nature Conservancy
have enclosed about half of them in screened enclosures. They have sent
tissue samples to botanical gardens to propagate new cacti and create a
supply in case the wild ones are wiped out.<BR>
<BR>
Scientists believe the moths either arrived in Florida naturally or on shipments
of prickly pears from the Caribbean during the late 1980s.</BLOCKQUOTE>

awareness of dying right whales</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The giant right whales are struggling
to survive and the Jacksonville Museum of Science and History is trying
to promote an awareness of the endangered species by opening a new exhibit,
&quot;Atlantic Tails,&quot; on Saturday, the Florida Times Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
There are only about 350 enormous whales still in survival. In the winter,
the females give birth to their young along the Northeast Florida-Southeast
Georgia coast. In the spring, the whales travel back up toward the coast
of Massachusetts.<BR>
<BR>
Throughout this period, the animals sometimes stray into Naval war exercises,
crossing ship lanes or fishing nets, contributing to the demise of the whale.
At one time, the whales were easily hunted because they stay close to shore
and move slowly. They yielded tons of oil and products made from their skin.
Hunting the right whale was banned in the 1930s, but its slow migrations
past busy ports have kept their fatalities on the rise.<BR>
<BR>
Recently, the Navy has been blamed for some of the whales' deaths. However,
Philip Hamilton, one of three scientists on the New England Aquarium's staff
who studies and lobbies for this species, told the Times Union that the
Navy has been cooperative in trying to help the situation by moving its
war exercises away from the animals.<BR>
<BR>
Other methods are being considered for protecting the right whales. One
method of making the animals move out of harms way is by sending out sounds
of approaching killer whale herds. It's a touchy method though because scientists
are concerned the whales will leave the habitat where they feed.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There are more people paying attention both environmentally and politically
,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;I have optimism that more will be done for
the species in coming years. Whether what we can do will be sufficient to
turn things around, I don't know.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

St. Petersburg lawyer Tom Reese told the Times he doubted Florida Power
&amp; Light will have much of a chance in court.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's a very weak case,&quot; he said &quot;I'm surprised they're taking
it up on appeal. It will just establish further precedent for us.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

bill</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Hotels, oil drillers, internet
services and a fish museum in line for tax breaks from a huge bill the Legislature
passed last week, better not count their money yet, the Associated Press
reported.<BR>
<BR>
Senate committees approved a $1.5 million business-prompt tax break package,
which, through loopholes, can bring exemptions and credits to $45 million.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I would say it may be a train going to nowhere,&quot; Chiles said,
indicating a possible veto.<BR>
<BR>
Chiles pointed out that business shouldn't be showered with tax breaks,
when social services for the needy are being cut by $400 million in the
$39.8 billion state budget passed. &quot;We don't know if we can run the
Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services because of cuts,&quot;
Chiles said.<BR>
<BR>
Among the more than 40 tax exemptions in the tax train bill, Chiles may
veto several environmental related issues including an exemption from sales,
rental, use, consumption, distribution and storage tax for solar energy
systems and components - worth $2 million a year; and a sales tax rebate
for International game Fish Association fishing hall of fame and museum
in Fort Lauderdale - worth up to $1 million a year for 15 years.<BR>
<BR>
Some items, however, may not be doomed, such as a five-year oil and gas
severance tax exemption designed to encourage petroleum exploration.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hopefully not,&quot; said Brian Bibeau, lobbyist for the Florida Independent
Petroleum Producers. &quot;It's on another bill as well. [Once Chiles considers
how such incentives could stimulate the economy,] we feel hopeful he's going
to sign the bill.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE --(EnviroWorld) -- Businesses are looking at ways
of reshaping their message after GOP attempts at environmental reforms backfired,
according to an article in the May 4 &quot;National Journal.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Putting a better spin on the issue is an important goal for the movement.
&quot;Let's stop calling it regulatory reform. We ought to talk about this
in terms of updating environmental safeguards,&quot; the article quotes
Charles DiBona of the American Petroleum Institute.<BR>
<BR>
Adopting a kinder, gentler tone is likely to be another tactic.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG -- (EnviroWorld) -- Because only about 1,500
black bears still roam Florida, officials seriously pursue those who commit
bearicide. This week Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission officers
retrieved a rifle they believe was used in a recent bear killing from a
St. Petersburg home, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
The bear carcass was found Jan. 22 in a Madison County forest that had been
leased to the Sundown Creek Hunting Club. After a Florida Department of
Law Enforcement ballistics lab determined that the animal had been shot
by a .35 caliber Marlin rifle, game commission Sgt. Neal Martin questioned
club members and found that only one, Gerald W. Taylor, used such a rifle.<BR>
<BR>
A search warrant was obtained for Taylor's home where the rifle was found.
Authorities are awaiting ballistics tests to confirm whether the gun was
the one used in the killing.<BR>
<BR>
It is a third-degree felony to kill a threatened bear . Punishment for the
crime could be five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Officials and legislators are
waiting for the fog to clear on a law affecting environmental regulation,
which was passed at the end of the session Saturday morning, the St. Petersburg
Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
The bill, part of frantic 133-page one-vote package, requires the state
Department of Environmental Protection to move state permitting employees
from Tallahassee to district offices. According to the bill that move will
improve service and streamline permitting, but now that they have had time
to actually read what they voted on, some legislators are worried about
the effects of the legislation.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I had no idea the amendment was that big,&quot; Sun. Rock Dantzler
told the Times. Dantzler is the chairman of the Senate Natural Resources
committee, which sponsored the original version of the bill.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;If we're talking about moving 300 state employees from Tallahassee
out to the field, that's a big policy decision that should not be made in
the rush of the last night of the session,&quot; Dantzler added.<BR>
<BR>
The DEP permits a diverse range of activities: dredge and fill operations,
coastal construction, mining, water and wastewater plants, aquatic weed
control and cleanup of polluted water among others. According to the Times,
DEP officials requested the amendment as the legislative session wound down,
in part to deal with anticipated budget shortfalls that would cut into money
for staff salaries.<BR>
<BR>
But some DEP critics found other motives in the request. Attorney David
Gluckman called the move an attempt &quot;to put permitting as far away
from (DEP leadership) as they can.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
DEP officials said they had just begun resolve details of the restructuring.
The agency would have until July 1997 to complete the moves, provided Gov.
Lawton Chiles signs the bill.<BR>
<BR>
The Governor's environmental policy coordinator Estus Whitfield told the
Times that signature was still in question.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The public perception - although it's not mine - for the state Department
of Environmental Protection to have delegated all the permitting for what
in many cases would be some very heavy-duty projects to the districts could
be connoted as a weakening,&quot; Whitfield said. <BR>
<BR>
Gluckman, who was less equivocal, said, &quot;I think that this is a product
of the fact that the agency (DEP) is dysfunctional. It's not working.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

Insurance Chief warms to climate change debate</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>LONGBOAT KEY -- (EnviroWorld) -- By Nanette Holland/ Correspondent
--Insurance companies in Florida can't afford to ignore scientific warnings
about global warming and sea level rise, the state's top insurance regulator
said Thursday.<BR>
<BR>
Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson, speaking at a conference on climate
change and the financial sector in Longboat Key, said Hurricane Andrew served
as a wake-up call to insurance industries of the potential threat they face
from changing weather patterns. After Andrew, insurers had to pay so much
money in claims that several companies went bankrupt and others pulled out
of the home insurance market in Florida altogether. Although Nelson has
led the fight to prevent insurance companies from abandoning Florida homeowners,
he admitted Thursday that Andrew may be a sign of things to come and that
insurance companies should take global warning into account when assessing
risk. <BR>
<BR>
Florida, with half the nation's $2 trillion in coastal property value, &quot;is
the most vulnerable of all the 50 states to the potential impacts of climate
change,&quot; he said. &quot;Our state would suffer relentless heat waves,
beaches being submerged by rising seas, contaminated drinking water and
more severe and damaging hurricanes. Obviously, the insurance industry has
a big stake in all this.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Nelson's acknowledgment that worldwide climatic patterns are shifting represents
an important turning point for the state, said a British scientist who spoke
at the conference. &quot;It's an encouraging sign that Americans are starting
to accept that global warming is in fact occurring and that they may be
willing to be more active in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in the
future,&quot; said Jeremy Leggett, an Oxford-educated academic and former
oil industry consultant who now heads a global warming education campaign
for Greenpeace International. <BR>
<BR>
Leggett, described in a recent Business Week article as a &quot;green warrior
in gray flannel,&quot; is spearheading an international effort to draw attention
to global warming by convincing the insurance and banking industries that
they are at risk if they do not consider the effects of temperature changes
when making investments. He is making headway in Europe and Japan, where
60 major insurance companies have pledged to weigh the effects of global
warming in their future financial decisions. But the going has been rougher
in the United States, and so far no American insurance companies have made
a similar commitment. Nelson said he would urge Florida's major insurers,
especially Allstate and State Farm -- the state's largest home insurers
-- to heed the warnings.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I can guarantee you that I will be sharing this information with their
very top executives,&quot; he said. <BR>
<BR>
The &quot;information&quot; includes estimates from a scientific panel convened
last year by the United Nations that global temperatures will rise an average
of 2 degrees and sea level will rise an average of 55 centimeters over the
next century.<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. contributes more greenhouse gases than any other nation, said Cory
Berish, a senior science advisor with the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The key issue among scientists is no longer whether the climate is
changing, but how quickly it is changing,&quot; Berish said. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>MIAMI--(EnviroWorld)--The Schaus swallowtail butterfly was nearly
wiped out by a combination of Hurricane Andrew, pesticides and hungry birds.
Only 17 existed globally after the 1992 storm. <BR>
<BR>
Now, the butterfly is being reintroduced to its natural habitat of South
Florida, the Associated Press reported. <BR>
<BR>
And the butterfly, which lives a total of three days, will soon be off the
extinction list thanks to UF zoologist Thomas Emmel who began breeding them
in a graduate student's kitchen.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's not just listing a species (as endangered) and watching it die,&quot;
Emmel said. &quot;But it's restoring it and bringing it back so the public
can enjoy it.&quot;<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO--(EnviroWorld)--Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s power-generation
division in Orlando joined forces with Florida Power Corp. for a the nation's
biggest power project to date, the Associated Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
Westinghouse will build Florida Power Corp.'s power generations for a $300
million plant being built near Bartow in Polk County. <BR>
<BR>
Though an exact amount of Westinghouse's financial disclosure was not revealed,
Randy Zwirn, executive vice president and chief operating officer of the
Orlando operation, said it &quot;is less than $100 million.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The plant will have the capacity to generate 470 megawatts making it the
largest project of its kind this year, said the Electric Power Research
Institute, an industry research organization in Palo Alto, Calif.<BR>
<BR>
The plant will be able to generate more power at lower costs, simultaneously
reducing emissions, Zwirn said. The project sets unprecedented use of Westinghouse
technology.<BR>
<BR>
Florida Power does not foresee the project producing higher electrical rates;
projections of population growth and revenues should absorb the extra costs
of the project, Joe Richardson, president and chief operating officer of
Florida Power, told the Orlando Sentinel.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)-- More than 1.8 million Floridians
drank water in the last two years that may have been laced with bacteria,
parasites, lead, chemicals and other contaminants, two environmentalist
groups reported Thursday.<BR>
<BR>
Some officials, such as Rep. John Mica, R-Winter Park, suggested that the
report was an election-year gimmick to hurt Republicans. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;All of the problems cited took place under current law,&quot; Mica
said. &quot;We are trying to make room for the flexibility to do things

&quot;They misrepresent the data,&quot; Al Walburton, spokesperson for the
American Water Works Association, said.<BR>
<BR>
Environmentalists cite statistics which show, they insist, that the public

Nationally, 900 people die and nearly 1 million get sick from ailments related
to drinking tap water, said Beth Kidder, spokesperson for the Florida Public

poised to begin Lake Apopka buyout</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO -- (EnviroWorld) -- With a $20 million allocation from
the state legislature, environmental officials are working on a land-buying
strategy for Lake Apopka, the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
The money won't cover the total cost to buy out all of the farmland around
the heavily polluted lake -- the farmer's asking price is $95 million. But
with hopeful eyes cast on Washington, state environmental officials want
to get started as quickly as possible. St. Johns River Water Management
District officials said buying the right piece of farmland could allow them
to begin creating a natural wetland cleansing system for the agricultural
runoff that has been polluting the lake for decades.<BR>
<BR>
The lake's farmers have united however, and are reluctant to sell their
land in piecemeal fashion. The largest landholders are A. Duda &amp; Sons
with 2,500 acres and a group of 12 farms called the Zellwood Drainage District
that controls 8,500 acres. The bargaining could become heated because the
buyout has a time limit. If nothing happens by July 1997, the water district
will impose strict limits on pollution levels in runoff.<BR>
<BR>
That the legislature approved any money for a buyout annoyed some environmentalists,
who felt that the farmers should help pay for the lakes' restoration.<BR>
<BR>
Legislators voted to let taxpayers foot the bill, however. Funding for the
buyout comes from the Water Management Lands Trust Fund ($8 million) and
the Conservation and Recreation Lands Trust Fund ($12 million).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- (EnviroWorld) -- At a speech
before oil and gas industry executives, a World Energy Council official
said oil would continue to be the fuel of choice worldwide for at least
50 years, Reuters reported.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;For the next few decades, probably up to 2050, there will be no shortage
of global resources of crude oil and natural gas ... no viable alternative

So far production from oil fields in the Middle East, Siberia and South

River</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Nitrate, a pollutant often associated
with dairy and chicken farms, is increasing in the middle reaches of the
Suwannee River, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
The highest levels of the chemical have been found in the 30 mile stretch
of river from Dowling Park to Branford. Overall the river's average of 0.6
milligrams of nitrate per liter of water falls well below safe drinking
water standards of 10 milligrams per liter, but well water tested from area
dairies found more than ten percent of the wells exceeded that level.<BR>
<BR>
Increased nitrate levels have also been found in area springs.<BR>
<BR>
While nitrate pollution can also come from fertilizer runoff and septic
tanks, the Suwannee and Lafayette county area has seen an explosion of the
chicken and dairy industry in the last 30 years. For example, there were
762,700 chickens in those two counties in 1964, and by 1992 that number
had risen to 6,716,683, according to the Sun.<BR>
<BR>
The danger of nitrates to humans is mainly to infants and the elderly. High
nitrate levels in drinking water have caused Blue Baby syndrome, in which
infants turn blue because the nitrates prevent their blood from carrying
oxygen.<BR>
<BR>
The chemical also threatens the Suwannee estuary, which could be damaged
by algal blooms. Experts said nitrate levels below the safe drinking water
level could result in such problems.<BR>
<BR>
Some area farmers have begun to take steps to reduce nitrate runoff, the
Sun reported. Poultry farmers can store chicken waste under roofs and can
compost dead birds. Dairy farmers can use methods that trampled cow paths
to recover so that they do not become channels for cow patty runoff. Animal
wastes can then be used as fertilizer, or disposed of in ways that allow
nitrates to vaporize.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Two weeks ago, Congress waived the law giving President Clinton authority
to resume listing action. <BR>
<BR>
Federal biologists have begun to reevaluate 10 types of the rare mussels
found in the region's rivers.<BR>

Ten different mollusks have been given highest priority, but some members
of Congress and local officials in the Florida-Georgia-Alabama area complained
that the mussel listings would curtail use of the rivers and stifle economic

Apopka's pollution targeted</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WINTER GARDEN--(EnviroWorld)--With $20 million in their hands,
regional water managers have begun shopping for farmland to help cut sources
of pollution devastating Lake Apopka.<BR>
<BR>
Farm owners around the lake, however, are reluctant to surrender the fertile
muckland that is a major source of their own profits and the nation's vegetables.<BR>
<BR>
Early this month, the Legislature approved spending the $20 million to buy
and protect environmentally sensitive land around the lake. The money was
taken from both Florida's Water Management Lands Trust Fund, and from the
state Conservation and Recreation Lands Trust Fund. <BR>
<BR>
The allocation was prompted by decades of heavy agriculture runoff that
has polluted the lake so heavily that it is close to dying. High levels
of phosphates have caused thick growths of algae turning the water to a
pea green color. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ST PETERSBURG--(EnviroWorld)--U.S. Secretary of the the Interior
Bruce Babbitt visited the Florida Marine Research Institute in St. Petersburg
yesterday where he attended a news conference and briefing by state scientists
on the unprecedented number of manatee deaths this year, the Tampa Tribune
reported. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;This is really a cause for alarm,&quot; said Babbitt, referring to
the death count of 265 manatees so far this year, already 59 more than the
previous record set in 1990. &quot;The good news is that this [Southwest
Florida] mortality is over.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As quickly as it appeared, the mystery illness has seemed to vanish, scientists
reported on Monday. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We'd have seen more sick animals [recently] if it wasn't over,&quot;
said Bob Turner, manatee recovery coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service. <BR>
<BR>
Researchers still aren't sure what the cause is, although many speculate
that red tide, a natural marine toxin, is involved in some way, according
to the Orlando Sentinel. Circumstantial evidence points the finger at red
tide, said Alan Huff, biological administrator for the Florida Marine Research
Institute. The red tide bloom became less concentrated in late April, coinciding
with the time manatees seemed to stop dying. <BR>
<BR>
However, scientists have not found red tide in the stomachs of manatees
as they did in 1982 when 37 animals died of the toxin. They are looking
in the lungs of the animals for signs of a new form of poisoning from the
toxin. Results should be available this week. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TARPON SPRINGS--(EnviroWorld)--The sponge diving industry is
dying in Tarpon Springs, dubbed the &quot;Sponge Capital of the World,&quot;
and one university has aspirations to salvage it, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
It seems that the tradition, passed from Greek father to son in the past,
has not been as appealing to the younger generation as an occupation in
recent years. As a last straw to save the tradition, St. Petersburg Junior
College plans to begin teaching a class on the sponge industry, starting
in July.<BR>
<BR>
There is concern, however, that the problem may not lay with the industry
alone, but with the resource itself. Tarpon Springs sponge divers say that
the sponges are scarce and they question the need to train others in gathering
them. Pollution has depleted the supply and there is little hope that it
will rejuvenate anytime soon. </BLOCKQUOTE>

stadium</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--Two pairs of osprey have found an
ideal nesting spot on top of the McKethan Stadium floodlights at the University
of Florida's baseball stadium, reported the Gainesville Sun. <BR>
<BR>
Looming 90 feet above the field on the first base and third base sides,
the birds return every February with a fresh supply of nesting materials
to build their home.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They get to be a nuisance,&quot; said UF maintenance director Bo Lauramore,
referring to the droppings and fish carcasses they leave on the playing
field. The spot is very attractive to the osprey because of its high roost
away from predators like raccoons, as well as its proximity to Lake Alice
for a feeding ground. <BR>
<BR>
In the 1950's and 60's the osprey population was devastated all across the
U.S. by DDT and other pollutants ingested through they fish they ate. However,
their comeback hasn't been hindered by the expansion of humankind and loss
of wilderness. Ospreys don't need the forest to make a home. As long as
a nest site is high enough, they will raise their young anywhere. </BLOCKQUOTE>

biologists</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)--With most conservation efforts focusing
on saving rain forests and other ecosystems on land, marine specialists
fear the endangerment of sea life as a &quot;slowly simmering crisis,&quot;
the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
Covering 71 percent of the Earths surface, the oceans are just as threatened
by human activity as the land that we live on. <BR>
<BR>
Last month, at a workshop sponsored by the nonprofit Center for Marine Conservation,
16 prominent marine specialists met to voice concerns and the damage to
marine systems. In the Chesapeake Bay, for example, fishermen now harvest
only 1 percent of the the oysters they did one century ago. Also, in the
Caribbean, sea corals have suffered a 90 percent reduction in the past 20
years.<BR>
<BR>
The object of the workshop was to make a plan to draw attention to the devastation
of marine systems on a national level. <BR>
<BR>
One of the problems is that relatively few marine creatures have been declared
extinct in recent years, compared to terrestrial creatures. Even if a species
has not been seen for many years, it is difficult to declare with absolute
certainty that the creature does not exist anywhere in the vast oceans.

erosion along Orlando lakes</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO -- (EnviroWorld) -- A 90-day study on the erosion of
Orlando lakes was presented to City Council members on Tuesday, and College
Park residents living along Lake Ivanhoe are not exactly happy with the
outcome, the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
The results of the study confirmed homeowners claims that the lake is eroding
along the shoreline. However, the primary cause is not fast moving water
vehicles but the lack of native water plants that is causing most of the
erosion. <BR>
<BR>
In addition, the report, prepared by city staff and a consultant, also says
that noise from the watercraft, the source of many homeowners complaints,
&quot;is well within the limits set forth for residential office, commercial
and industrial zoning districts,&quot; according to the Sentinel.<BR>
<BR>
The study was performed because of a proposed law to turn Lake Ivanhoe into
a no-wake zonewhen residents complained about boaters eroding the shore.
Boating enthusiasts resented the proposal saying that wealthy homeowners
were simply trying to cut off public access.<BR>
<BR>
The report contains several recommendations to curb erosion. Instead of
creating a no-wake zone, the report suggests using buoys to designate the
100-foot-from shoreline no-wake zone that already exists. It also suggests
establishing a larger no-wake zone near boat ramps - 200 feet instead of
100 feet.<BR>
<BR>
Other recommendations, according to the Orlando Sentinel, include: no-wake
zones 100 feet from the fish feeders on the west side of Lake Ivanhoe, regular
marine patrols during high-use periods, prohibition of boat-trailer parking
on residential streets, and planting more vegetation to slow down erosion.<BR>
<BR>
City staff is expected to present ordinances for consideration, based on
the recommendations.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CEDAR KEY -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Florida Marine Research Institute,
a branch within the Department of Environmental Protection to provide scientific
research on marine resources, began construction on a 10th field lab yesterday,
the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
The Cedar Key Marine Laboratory will be used to gather data to help state
fisheries managers understand area biology and ecology. In addition, monitoring
juvenile-fish populations will be an essential program in the lab to help
determine necessary regulations for the area.<BR>
<BR>
The lab will be built on State Road 24, a mile outside Cedar Key. Construction
is expected to take about 10 months.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ARCHER -- (EnviroWorld) -- Six companies have offered proposals
to Alachua County for waste disposal, the Gainesville Sun reported. The
plans offer a mixture of an aggressive recycling program and out-of-county
dumping.<BR>
<BR>
The Southwest Landfill near Archer, currently being used, will reach its
capacity in 1998 and bidders are suggesting alternatives for a new site.
In addition, county staff have proposed extending the life of the landfill
up to four more years past 1998.<BR>
<BR>
The proposals will force commissioners to decide if the life of the landfill
should in deed be extended, if shipping some or all of the county's trash
elsewhere is acceptable, and to determine the county's future involvement
near Archer and Orange Heights, where a new facility could be built, according
to the Sun.<BR>
<BR>
Regardless of what is decided from the proposals, County Public Works Director
Ed Culpepper told the Sun he will recommend purchasing and permitting the
county's site as &quot;insurance&quot; to give the county greater flexibility.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Whether we ever build anything or not, it is our backup plan,&quot;
Culpepper said.<BR>
<BR>
The companies that have offered proposals for the county's trash include:
Bedminister Bioconversion Corp.; Boone Waste Industries; Browing-Ferris
Industries; FCR Inc.; Norton Environmental; and Waste Management Inc.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WEST PALM BEACH -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Governing Board of the
South Florida Water Management District approved the purchase of 21,702
acres of land in Hendry and Collier County that is the major headwater to
the Big Cypress National Preserve and the Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve.<BR>
<BR>
The cost of the land is $11.5 million. The district will be looking to the
state's Conservation and Recreation Lands program for reimbursement of 50
percent of the purchase price.<BR>
<BR>
The acquisition includes the heart of the slough and uplands and hammocks.
The land is a major habitat protection area for the Florida Panther and
contains more than 11,000 acres of wetlands. The current owner of the property,

<STRONG>Restaurateur wins fight with state on submerged land payments</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. AUGUSTINE -- (EnviroWorld) -- In 1991, the Department of
Environmental Protection realized it had made an error: the agency had forced
a St. Augustine businessman to make lease payments on submerged land under
his restaurant for five years when officials realized the state didn't own
the land, the Florida Times-Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
The only trouble was that the DEP forgot to tell the businessman.<BR>
<BR>
But David Ponce, owner of the Conch House Restaurant, is now getting back
a total of $423,534 from the state. Gov. Chiles and the Cabinet ordered
repayment of the lease money last year, and the legislature just approved
a bill to pay Ponce for interest and other costs.<BR>
<BR>
The DEP, which realized the error while researching another submerged land
case, claimed it did not intentionally withhold the information about the
land under Ponce's restaurant.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nobody apparently put two and two together,&quot; John Costigan, Deputy
General Counsel for the department, told the Times-Union. &quot;It wasn't
a conscious effort not to tell Mr. Ponce.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The city of St. Augustine actually owns the land, and, thanks to a new ordinance,
will soon be asking Ponce for rent checks.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Seeking to avoid the complacency
which seemed to strike Floridians during last year's hurricane strikes,
Governor Chiles has declared June as Hurricane Awareness Month. Hurricane
season begins June 1.<BR>
<BR>
Evacuation of Florida's coastal counties is an on-going challenge for the
state. During Hurricane Opal, many Floridians evacuated too late, causing
traffic congestion in the Panhandle as the hurricane moved over land. Officials
encourage residents to evacuate the moment they are ordered to do so. In
addition, evacuees are encouraged to relocate to the closest inland place
that is safe in order to reduce traffic congestion.<BR>
<BR>
Division of Emergency Management Director Joe Myers also had advice for
state residents further from shore. &quot;We ask inland residents who do
not live in flood-prone areas, to be prepared to shelter in their homes
with a fully- stocked hurricane supplies kit to last their family at least
72 hours: canned foods, bottled water, medical supplies, personal hygiene
items, flashlights, portable radios and several extra packs of batteries,&quot;
he said.<BR>
<BR>
The 1995 hurricane season was Florida's most expensive since 1992 with Hurricane
Andrew and the busiest since 1985 with Hurricanes Elena, Juan and Kate.
According to the National Hurricane Center, the storm surge associated with
Opal was perhaps the widest and most extensive in Florida's history, with
heavy damage from Mobile through the Panama City Beach-Mexico Beach areas.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Florida commuters to B-BOPP to work, according to the Gainesville Sun.<BR>
<BR>
B-BOPP to work is an annual statewide event that promotes biking, carpooling,
using buses or walking to get to work. The event was designed to reduce
traffic congestion, parking demand, air pollution and commuter stress.<BR>
<BR>
The Florida Institute for Marketing Alternative Transportation reports that
73 percent of work commuters drive to and from work alone. If 10 percent
of these single-occupant drivers conserved, $40 billion in health problems
from air pollution could be saved annually and 12 million gallons of<STRONG>

<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE--(EnviroWorld)-- With the pending sale of its paper
mill company, the St. Joe Paper Co. is seeking a new CEO and name, according
to a Florida Times-Union report.<BR>
<BR>
When Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Winfred L. Thornton told shareholders
at an annual meeting that he was retiring, a nationwide search for a new
leader began.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Now that we're restructuring, we need somebody that can really take
and build the company for the future,&quot; said Thornton. <BR>
<BR>
St. Joe, a Jacksonville-based conglomerate with interests in five industries
including paper mills and sugar production, is one of the largest private
owners of Florida land. The company is selling off many of its holdings
to concentrate on real estate. <BR>
<BR>
St. Joe Corp., the new name given by shareholders, is selling its paper
mill in Port St. Joe and 16 box plants around the eastern United States
to a joint venture owned by Four M Corp. and Stone Container Corp. for $390
million. The deal is expected to close by the end of May.</BLOCKQUOTE>

October's dove hunt </A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- The famous raid of a North Florida
charity dove hunt caused sparks to fly at a hearing on Wednesday among congressional
members, the Gainesville Sun reported. The main issues presented at the
hearing were the tactics of U.S. game officers, the fairness of federal
hunting laws and the behavior of prominent Florida officials.<BR>
<BR>
Fish and Wildlife officials had charged 88 participants during a benefit
in October hosted by State Sen. Charles Williams in Dixie County for hunting
doves on a baited field. Fish and Wildlife officials contend they were simply
enforcing the laws against hunting migratory birds on baited fields.<BR>
<BR>
Despite claims by Williams and other prominent participants in the hunt
such as Alachua County Sheriff Steve Oelrich who say they saw no bait on
the field, an agent who oversaw the raid said &quot;tons&quot; of grain
had been scattered on the 200-acre parcel.<BR>
<BR>
Since the time of the raid, 86 attendees have paid fines, making the total
nearly $40,000. Though Williams and Oelrich don't agree with the charges,
they and others chose not to contest them because of the cost involved.
Oelrich told the Sun he also has to work on a daily basis with federal authorities.
&quot;It was not worth it to me to put this whole relationship in jeopardy,&quot;
Oelrich said. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>
The plan for the Orange Creek Basin was drafted by a committee formed in
1994 in response to complaints from residents of Orange and Lochloosa lakes
about low lake levels. The plan was approved unanimously by the board at
the urging of lake residents, environmental group representatives and Rep.
Bob Casey, R-Gainesville. Funding from the district is the key factor at
this point for implementing the plan.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ALACHUA COUNTY -- (EnviroWorld) -- A proposed cement plant for
Alachua County remains a concern for the American Lung Association, but
the group is not as vehemently opposed to the proposal as it had been, the
Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
The group has raised concerns about a proposed permit to construct a Florida
Rock Industries cement plant. The lung association is worried about whether
the plant actually will be able to reduce emissions with the technologies
they plan to use.<BR>
<BR>
After a meeting with Florida Rock officials on April 29, Sandra Kessler,
the Florida chapter of the American Lung Association's executive director,
sent a letter saying the group remains firm about its concerns. However,
Kessler said the group is pleased to learn Florida Rock will not burn hazardous
waste and cites other steps the company proposes to take to reduce pollution,
including burning only low-sulfur coal. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CEDAR KEY -- (EnviroWorld) -- A sea turtle that drifted from
its feeding grounds in North America was caught in a fishing net off the

off Cedar Key, the Gainesville Sun reported. Cedar Key was chosen for the
Kamp Ridley turtle because the species is often found in the areas biologically
rich coastal shallows estuary. <BR>
<BR>
These sea turtles have dwindled in numbers over the past fifty years. The
turtles nest in Rancho Nuevo in Mexico, then the hatchlings drift in the
Gulf Coast currents - some making there way to the tip of Florida. The Kamp

<BLOCKQUOTE>MIAMI -- (EnviroWorld) -- Quite often, the airplane you're flying
in could be carrying hazardous cargo, federal officials have said, according
to the St. Petersburg Times.<BR>
<BR>
Materials such as petroleum products, corrosive chemicals and radioactive
medical supplies can find their way onto passenger aircrafts, but strict
handling and packaging requirements have kept the &quot;friendly&quot; skies
safe.<BR>
<BR>
Every package is inspected for compliance with regulations before it is
released for shipment. Non-compliance can cause penalties of up to $25,000
a day per violation, and criminal charges could be brought forth.<BR>
<BR>
The issue of airplanes carrying hazardous materials comes forward with the
recent crash of ValuJet Flight 592 in the Everglades. Hazardous oxygen canisters
were carried as cargo aboard the plane and are suspected of having a role
in the crash, the Orlando Sentinel reported. <BR>
<BR>
ValuJet is not authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration to carry
hazardous cargo, but the canisters were labeled empty - therefore not classified
as hazardous. The canister labels may have been incorrect and an investigation
is taking place to determine if they had something to do with the crash
that killed 110 people.</BLOCKQUOTE>

bill of health</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA--(EnviroWorld)--The West Coast Regional Water Supply Authority,
Tampa's main water supplier, gave its product a clean bill of health this
week, reported The Tampa Tribune. <BR>
<BR>
After testing eight major water distribution points in Hillsborough, Pasco
and Pinellas counties this month, no trace of two bugs known for infesting
drinking water were found. The two parasites, cryptosporidium and giardia,
have contaminated drinking water throughout the world. <BR>
<BR>
In 1993 when cryptosporidium invaded water supplies in Milwaukee and was
blamed for over 100 deaths, suppliers around the world felt the pressure,
said John Troutt, resource monitoring manager for West Coast. <BR>
<BR>
Soon after the outbreak, West Coast's Technical Advisory Committee decided
to begin quarterly monitoring for crytosporidium and giardia. The testing
is voluntary and exceeds regulations for water monitoring, according to
Troutt. <BR>
<BR>
Most of the region's water supply comes from the Floridian Aquifer, an underground
source that is less vulnerable to parasites than surface water supplies.
<BR>
<BR>
Tampa, which gets its water supply from a surface system, checks for crytosporidium
weekly.<BR>

<BR>
Bill sponsor Rep. Tom Warner, R-Stuart, maintained that melaleucas on private
land spread elsewhere, pushing out vegetation. The bill would have applied
to properties of 5 acres or less. <BR>
<BR>
Homeowners asserted that it would be unfair for them to pay for eradication
of the trees, which could cost up to $500 per mature plant.<BR>

tide</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CRYSTAL RIVER--(EnviroWorld)--Dead catfish seen floating in
Crystal River during the past few days could signal a red tide, but environmental
officials said Tuesday they cannot confirm the suspicion, The St. Petersburg
Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The catfish are typically one of the first to be affected by red tide,&quot;
said Beverly Roberts, research administrator for the Department of Environmental
Protection's Marine Research Institute in St. Petersburg.<BR>
<BR>
Red tide--the phenomenon suspected of killing 155 manatees in southwest
Florida this year--is relatively uncommon in waters off Citrus County. Typically
the epidemic is found farther south on the gulf coast.<BR>
<BR>
Bob Gill, owner of Shrimp Landing off Fort Island Trail, said a crabber
told him the Red Tide had brought thousands of the bottom-dwelling catfish
into Crystal River from the gulf.<BR>
<BR>
However, according to Seth Blitch, an environmental specialist with the
Department of Environmental Protection, reports of dead fish in the St.
Martins March Aquatic Preserve have been overstated.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There have been a few hard-head catfish, but mostly in the north part
of the river toward the Florida Power plant,&quot; he said. &quot;We'll
have a better idea when we get out there. It's too soon to tell what's causing
it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
An aerial survey of the region was planned for Wednesday and more water
samples will be tested this week to determine what has killed the large
number of catfish since Sunday.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CLEARWATER BEACH--(EnviroWorld)--Glenn Harman, senior biologist
for the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, spotted the year's first sea turtle
nest on Clearwater Beach Wednesday, according to The St. Petersburg Times.<BR>
<BR>
He followed imprints from a sea turtle's flappers which lead to a nest of
about 120 golf ball-sized eggs. The eggs were covered with a screen and
the area was squared off with stick posts and orange tape to warn beachgoers
on north Clearwater Beach.<BR>
<BR>
The aquarium hires temporary staffer from May to October to scout the beaches
and protect the nests. It takes about $60,000 dollars to protect the sea
turtles. <BR>
<BR>
To offset costs this year, people can adopt a nest for $25 dollars. The
nest &quot;parents&quot; will receive updates throughout the season and
a photograph of the nest. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Florida's most flamboyant former
governor has applied for state permits to pump fresh water from two north
Florida springs--one two miles offshore--and bottle the product for resale.<BR>
<BR>
Kirk Water Works, owned by former Governor Claude Kirk, is seeking Governor
&amp; Cabinet approval of its plan to build a pipeline to shore and bottle
water from a spring discharging into the Atlantic Ocean two miles east of
Crescent Beach, just south of St. Augustine. The plan also calls for a similar
system to be installed in Spring Creek, a freshwater spring in an esturine
area in Wakulla County, near Tallahassee.<BR>
<BR>
Department of Environmental Protection permitting chief Jeremy Craft said
the agency is concerned about the Spring Creek plan because of the &quot;delicate
esturine system that could be impacted by a change in salinity freshwater
removal may effect.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
However, DEP may sign off on Kirk's plan to pump water from the Crescent
Beach offshore spring as that freshwater &quot;is lost to the ocean directly&quot;.<BR>

of funding woes</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Florida Legislature's last
minute passage of a bill moving 300 environmental permitting staffers from
Tallahassee to remote locations around the state was driven by budget shortfalls
not by any sinister agenda to weaken environmental protection, according
to the head of the state's environmental permit program.<BR>
<BR>
State Senators told Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Ginger
Wetherell &quot;you've got to live within your means&quot; when a $4-million
shortfall in permitting program revenues was not &quot;fixed&quot; in appropriations
committee hearings, says Jeremy Craft, chief of DEP's Environmental Resource
Program. &quot;So she structured a deal that gave us a year in which to
make rational choices and rational budget adjustments. Otherwise, we'd have
all been on the street beginning July 1 this year.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Instead, the 133-page amendment passed in the waning hours of the Legislature
calls for staffers to move to the DEP's district offices around the state
and conduct permit review there. The bill also eliminates the remaining
Tallahassee ERP division staff, including Craft, beginning July 1, 1997.
&quot;We're all pretty depressed,&quot; Craft told EnviroWorld.<BR>
<BR>
Craft said he was developing a system to retain top staffers in Tallahassee,
but the details of that plan have yet to be worked out. &quot;We'll take
care of our top people.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As for the quality of permits written in the field, Craft is bullish. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The hardest line people we have are our field people. And we have
opportunities for tremendous hour savings in permit processing without impacting
the level of environmental protection,&quot; Craft felt.</BLOCKQUOTE>

told the Sentinel that the vote was &quot;a vital step in the process of
getting the industry the relief it desperately needs.&quot;<BR>

charged </STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>MIAMI -- (Associated Press) -- A Miami couple have been arrested
and charged with violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and conspiracy,
and wildlife officials said other charges may soon follow.<BR>
<BR>
The couple, Barbara and Jose Luis Torraguitart, were involved with the Santeria
religion and were apparently dealing in various animal parts to be used
for rites associated with that religion. Among the evidence collected was
a human skull and bones, which Metro Dade homicide officers are investigating.<BR>
Agents with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began the investigation after
learning &quot;high priests for the Santeria religion were using protected
animals for sacrifice,&quot; according to an affidavit by federal wildlife
agent Jorge Picon.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Information has revealed a large demand in the Miami area for restricted
or prohibited species of birds, mammals and reptiles,&quot; Picon said.<BR>
<BR>
Initially, the couple sold undercover agents counterfeit animal parts --
a fake manatee skull, bald eagle, and human fetus -- but the couple was
arrested when agents paid $1600 for two frozen barn owls, a hawk, tow elephant
tusks, a leopard skin and a rabbit fetus.<BR>
<BR>
So far, the charges pressed carry a possible 5-year prison sentence.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>DAYTONA BEACH--(EnviroWorld)-- A $100 million redevelopment
project to facelift a four-block beachside tourist district in Daytona beach
may ban beach driving. Some will not let that happen without public debate,
the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
At least two Daytona Beach commissioners, who want to keep beachdriving
legal, have asked for a public forum. So far, Daytona Beach Mayor Bud Asher
has decided against the debate because of the controversial idea of closing
part of the beach to drivers.<BR>
<BR>
The plan has been stalled since last week when Ocean Walk Properties LTD
developers asked for a half-mile traffic-free zone. This would also entail
closing some streets to traffic. Asher has not granted their request.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm disappointed that this project is on hold,&quot; Commissioner
George Burden said. &quot;There's enough blame to go around on why that
happened.&quot;<BR>

Burden said he will ask that a public forum be scheduled.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)-- Gainesville has seen a total of
0.00 inches of rain this month and the National Weather Service predicts
it could be another week before there is any rain, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
May is typically a dry month, but this is pretty unusual to see no rain
halfway through the month, meteorologist Tom Light said.<BR>
<BR>
The biggest concern is the brush fires that have steadily increased lately
due to the dry, hot weather.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We've had some areas with lots of problems with brush fires,&quot;
said Gainesville Fire Rescue spokesman Stuart Schwartz. &quot;When the summer
afternoon storms get here, they could dump a lot of rain, and that will
help. But if lightening strikes where there is no rain, coupled with the
windy conditions that usually accompany those storms, we could have serious
problems.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

power regulations</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG -- (EnviroWorld) -- In what state officials are
calling a first, Central Florida phophate giant IMC-Agrico Co. placed an
ad in the Wall Street Journal seeking help in lowering its electrical bills,
the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Largely the request is symbolic because Florida's electricity market is
still tightly regulated compared to states such as California and New York,
so IMC-Agrico is required to purchase most of its power from local providers.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I was surprised to see the ad,&quot; Joseph Jenkins, a Public Service
Commission official, told the Times, &quot;It's novel and probably the first
of its kind in the state.&quot;<BR>
But Jenkins said it probably wouldn't be the last, as industries begin pushing
for deregulation of state utilities to remain competitive with out-of-state
businesses.<BR>
<BR>
Large industries already get a break on power bills compared to residential
customers. The Times reported that customers such as IMC-Agrico pay about
4 cents per kilowatt hour. Residents pay approximately twice that.<BR>
<BR>
IMC-Agrico was also a member of the Florida Industrial Power Users Group,
a lobbying group that pushed several deregulation measures during the 1996
legislative session. The measures were disliked by utilities, however, and
failed.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CRYSTAL RIVER -- (EnviroWorld) -- Worried over plans to increase
the number of manatee sanctuaries along the coast of Citrus County, dive
shop owners and others in the tourism industry are squaring off against
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and environmentalists, the Tampa Tribune
reported.<BR>
<BR>
The seven existing manatee sanctuaries are completely off limits to humans
from Nov. 15 to March 31 and most of them are within the Wildlife Service's
jurisdiction in the Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge. Though no formal
plan has been made, officials are considering the addition of Three Sisters
Springs in Crystal River and Blue Water in Homosassa Springs to the sanctuary
list.<BR>
<BR>
But people who benefit economically from the manatees believe that the endangered
animal would better be served by efforts to maintain a clean habitat, not
restrict human interaction. They question<BR>
whether their activities harm manatees.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You don't appreciate manatees until you see them firsthand, and once
you do, divers are the manatees' greatest advocates,&quot; Doug Stamm, a
former aquatic biologist and diver told the Tribune. &quot;The (Crystal
River) manatees are ambassadors for their species. That would be lost without
interaction with people.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge manager Cameron Shaw disagrees.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;At Three Sisters there's a small sand shelf where the spring empties
into the canal,&quot; he said. &quot;Manatees like to sleep there, but they
can't because of people invading their bedrooms. On cold mornings you have
30 or 40 manatees trying to sleep and 70 or 80 people trying to watch them.
It's ecotourism run amok.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Earlier this year, 2,639 manatees were counted in a statewide census. In
Citrus County, the wintering herd numbered 304, up from 171 ten years ago.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- Agricultural trade organizations were
very successful in spreading the word about the coming plague of Brown Citrus
Aphid. The insect pest is expected to begin spreading through Florida's
commercial citrus crop soon at a cost of millions of dollars, and advance
news of the threat was able to generate $1 million in federal research funding.<BR>
<BR>
But the word may have spread too far, the Tampa Tribune reported. Some farmers
are complaining that bankers have heard about the problem -- knowledge which
could affect decisions to lend to citrus farmers who want to use their land
as collateral.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- The University of South Florida has
received a $41,000 grant from DuPont Corp. to study ventilating fabrics,
the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
The money is to be used to help develop fabrics for people who work in hot,
dangerous environments, such as pesticide applicators, and sandblasters.
Not only will advances in fabrics make workers more comfortable, they will
help the bottom line.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We found that wearing fabrics that helped (people) better tolerate
the heat and humidity could extend work time by as much as 20 percent,&quot;

towns difficult under devolution</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- A Gainesville Sun editorial
points out the difficulty that small towns now have in building water-system
infrastructure as the federal government devolves more responsibility onto
state and local governments.<BR>
<BR>
Because smaller towns were last in line for fat government grants to improve
water systems during the 70's, those towns were left out when the federal
well dried up. Now, with loans replacing the grants, small towns are facing
economic hardship because payments have to be spread over a smaller population.<BR>
<BR>
Citing Tom Arrandal, an environmental columnist for &quot;Governing,&quot;
the Sun writes that a small town's residents could end up paying 10 times
more for sewer service than people in larger cities. An out-of-reach cost
could lead to compliance problems for these municipalities.<BR>
<BR>
The Sun's position is that &quot;regulators ... recognize the problems small
towns face in complying, to be willing to give such communities more time
in which to comply and to give them more leeway to find less-expensive ways
to protect water quality.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

hauler pleads guilty to mail fraud </STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON-- (EnviroWorld) --Carnell Rivers of Hampton, S.C.,
and his corporation, Carnell Rivers Trucking Inc., pleaded guilty on May
13 to five felony counts for mailing false insurance documents to obtain
permits to haul infectious medical waste in South Carolina, Delaware, New
York and Pennsylvania. <BR>
<BR>
Thewastes were transported to a facility in Hampton County, S.C., where
they were incinerated. Insurance was required for hauling the wastes to
cover the cost of cleanup in the event of an accident. Rivers, one of South
Carolina's most active medical waste haulers, canceled the required liability
insurance of his firm in May 1993. From May 1993 until April of 1995 he
avoided insurance costs by directing employees to falsify insurance records
and submit false proof of insurance certificates through the mail and by
telefaxin order to obtain the state permits. <BR>
<BR>
Rivers will be sentenced after a pre sentence investigation has been completed.
Rivers faces a sentence of up to 25 years in prison and a fine of up to
$1.25 million. The case is the result of a cooperative effort between the
EPA Criminal Investigation Division and the Office of Criminal Investigations
of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON-- (EnviroWorld) -- On May 9, Michael Barlow, who
was convicted for his part in an illegal asbestos removal operation, was
sentenced in federal court to 15 months imprisonment. Phillips Banks,codefendant,
a Philadelphia real estate developer, was sentenced on May 8, to two and
one-half years in prison and fined $30,000. <BR>
<BR>
On Nov. 10, 1995, after an eight-day trial, a jury convicted Barlow on one
count of conspiracy to violate the Clean Air Act (CAA), one felony count
of failure to follow the National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollution
(NESHAP) work practices related to asbestos removal under the CAA, and one
felony count for violating the CAA by failing to notify authorities of the
asbestos removal operation.<BR>
<BR>
Banks hired Michael Barlow off the street and directed him to remove asbestos
pipe insulation from the basement and a crawl space above the 12th floor
of the building, even though Barlow was not trained or certified in asbestos
removal. Barlow then assembled a crew of untrained individuals who removed
the asbestos, spreading asbestos fibers in the lobby, basement, and 12th
floor crawl space of the building. The asbestos was then illegally dumped
in three locations in West Philadelphia. <BR>
<BR>
Banks had previously been fined $5,000 for improper asbestos removal by
the City of Philadelphia in a civil action in 1987. One of the aggravating
factors leading to a jail term for Barlow was the fact that he fled after
the charges were filed against him. This case was the result of a cooperative
effort by the EPA Criminal Investigation Division, the U.S. Attorney for
the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the FBI, and the Philadelphia City
Environmental Task Force.</BLOCKQUOTE>

calf stillborn in captivity</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA--(EnviroWorld)--Lowry Park Zoo's first attempt at having
a manatee calf born in captivity has failed.<BR>
<BR>
A sick, pregnant manatee transferred to the zoo three weeks ago gave birth
to a stillborn calf at 7 a.m. Monday, according to zoo spokeswoman Deborah
Carr. <BR>
<BR>
The mother remains in stable condition and is expected to recover from the
ordeal. She is one of four sick manatees delivered to the zoo's manatee
research area this year. She arrived at the zoo from Fort Myers, fighting
what is believed to be poisoning from red tide. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(Enviro World)--The California red-legged frog,
celebrated by Mark Twain for its jumping abilities more than 130 years ago,
was declared officially threatened and put under federal government protection
on Monday, reported the The Tampa Tribune. <BR>
<BR>
Critics in Congress claim that the law is overly intrusive on property owners.
There is concern that by listing the frog as endangered or threatened interference
may occur with the construction of the Los Vaqueros Reservoir project in
central California, as well as some highway construction. <BR>
<BR>
However, Mollie Beattie of the Fish and Wildlife Service, promised to develop
strategies in dealing with the concerns that &quot;balance conservation
with economic activities.&quot; She said recovery plans for the frogs would
begin immediately. <BR>
<BR>
In the 1860's, there were thousand of the species. Today, only three areas
are believed to hold more than 350 adults. </BLOCKQUOTE>

tourism</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CRYSTAL RIVER--(EnviroWorld)--Some developers, dive-shop owners,
and others dependent on tourism say they could be driven out by too many
manatee sanctuaries, reported The Gainesville Sun.<BR>
<BR>
Seven sites have been named by the federal government as sanctuaries. This
means that between Nov. 15 and March 31 the areas are off-limits to people
and boats. <BR>
<BR>
It is during these months that the manatees head for the warmer springs
to escape winter's chill. However, this coincides with the same time that
tourists pour into Florida fleeing the same cold.<BR>
<BR>
The huge refuge at Crystal River stretches across much of Western Citrus
County, and two more sanctuaries may be added. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;If they close these areas, there's no other spring or dive area to
go to except Kings Spring, and it has water-clarity problems,&quot; said
Sam Lyons, operator of Plantation Inn Marina and Dive Shop. <BR>
Lyons said that the government should focus their efforts on ensuring a
clean habitat for the creatures rather than a sectioned off place to view
them. <BR>
<BR>
The number of off-limits zones has reached seven but two more may be added
in an area adjoining Three Sisters Springs in Crystal River and Blue Water
in Homosassa Springs. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CLEARWATER--(EnviroWorld)--Last year, the proposed downtown
lake in Clearwater had much support from City Commissioners, as well as
funds up to $17 million set aside by city officials. However, one year later
the prospects for the lake have dimmed, according to the St. Petersburg
Times. <BR>
<BR>
The reason could be due to a revamping of the City Commission in the last
two elections. Four of the five commissioners now in office rode their way
to victory on platforms that promised, among other things, an aversion to
big projects. <BR>
<BR>
Also, a recent report indicated that environmental cleanup costs could be
substantial in the industrial area where the lake would be situated. <BR>
<BR>
City administrators explained on Monday that the $17 million allotted last
year for the project was never &quot;real money,&quot; just a &quot;number
next to a line item.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
However, the administrators are hoping to sell commissioners on the idea
some time in the next few weeks. They assert that the lake could provide
a place to treat stormwater runoff, while offering an added feature to area
apartments and offices. In theory, property values and city revenues would
rise. <BR>
<BR>
A decision on the lake proposal is expected in June. Clearwater is one of
nearly 200 applicants for 10 spots in the program. </BLOCKQUOTE>

law</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>MIAMI BEACH -- (EnviroWorld) -- Gov. Lawton Chiles signed a
bill on Monday mandating safety education for young boaters in Florida,
the Associated Press reported. The bill was passed by Legislature after
13 defeats in the past 10 years.<BR>
<BR>
Under the law, anyone 16 or younger must have boating safety training to
operate a boat powered by engines with 10 or more horsepower. The age requirement
will rise one year each year until 2001, when boater completion of the education
course will be required for anyone under the age of 22.<BR>
<BR>
Training can be an eight-hour boater education course approved by the state
DEP. The requirement can be bypassed if the young operator passes an equivalency
test.<BR>
<BR>
In 1994, Florida waters led the nation with 1,193 boating accidents and
74 boating deaths. Reports for 1995, not yet final, indicate 1,337 boating
accidents in Florida, including 78 deaths.<BR>
<BR>
The law takes effect Oct. 1. </BLOCKQUOTE>

to prevent lake erosion</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO -- (EnviroWorld) -- After a lake management study determined
that Orlando lakes need protection from further erosion, the City Council
passed an ordinance on Monday, which includes rules and a $100 fine for
rule-breakers, the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
Provisions within the ordinance include: a no-wake-zone around publicly
owned boat ramps and fish feeders; docking, loading and unloading permitted
only at publicly owned boat ramps or private property; and prohibition of
anchoring boats to signs, buoys, pylons, fish feeders or other objects protruding
from the water.<BR>
<BR>
The lakes affected by the ordinance include: Clear Lake, Lake Mann, Lake
Underhill, Big Lake Fairview, Lake Ivanhoe, Lake Lawne and Lake Baldwin.<BR>
<BR>
Previously, property owners on Lake Ivanhoe were hoping the new rules would
include a no-wake-zone throughout the entire lake because they believed
the fast-moving boats were eroding the shoreline. The study, however, showed
that most damage is caused by changing water levels and lack of native plant
species.</BLOCKQUOTE>

this summer</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld) -- The National Park Service is wrestling
with a budget squeeze made even more difficult by the toll of a harsh winter,
The Associated Press reported. The fallout for many visitors this summer
will be a noticeable drop in services and reduced access.<BR>
<BR>
Federal officials and private watchdog groups say deterioration and money
shortages are imperiling parks long considered national treasures. For too
many years maintenance has been postponed an park budgets have failed to
keep up with inflation, they say.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Everybody likes ribbon cutting. Nobody wants to fix the roof,&quot;
Roger Kennedy, director of the National Park Service, told the AP.<BR>
<BR>
This summer, a record 270 million people are expected to visit the 360 federal
parks, monuments and recreation areas. At the same time, proposals to increase
park fees have stalled in Congress over disputes about who should have to
pay higher fees and how much to increase them. Also, legislation that would
require private concessionaires to contribute more is in limbo.<BR>
<BR>
While the severe winter and flooding has hit some parks hard, Kennedy said
the bigger problems are decaying buildings and facilities and the inability
to continue educational services at adequate levels.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Visitors are going to find trails closed, they're going to find portions
of parks closed, campgrounds closed,&quot; Kennedy said. &quot;They're going
to see signs that say 'Don't drink the water' in some places, they're going
to find there are no ranger talks. The little things that make these places
park-like.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Gov. Chiles signed the property
insurance bill on Tuesday that was passed by lawmakers in the final hours
of the legislative session, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
The bill prevents hurricane insurers from leaving the state until 1999 --
an extension of a ban first imposed in 1993 after Hurricane Andrew. The
law is opposed by the insurance industry, but is aimed at protecting Florida
homeowners from losing coverage.<BR>
<BR>
The law maintains Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson's authority over the
industry. Nelson can reject rate increases and prevent insurers from canceling
policies.<BR>
<BR>
Insurers have complained that Nelson holds too much power and that the ban
on leaving the state is unconstitutional.</BLOCKQUOTE>

sugar tax</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Big Sugar has given $30,000
to a campaign that could stymie efforts at a constitutional sugar tax, the
Tampa Tribune reported. <BR>
<BR>
Sugar farmers are backing efforts by the Tax Cap Committee to get an amendment
passed this year which would require a two-thirds vote to pass any constitutional
tax. If successful, the amendment would apply immediately. That could benefit
Big Sugar because there will also be an amendment on the ballot to enact
a penny-a-pound tax on sugar for Everglades restoration.<BR>
<BR>
Two weeks ago, the Florida Supreme Court agreed to put Tax Cap's amendment
on the ballot Nov. 5. Big Sugar's donation represents a large portion of
Tax Cap's $82,481 budget, but it pales to the $2 million the industry gave
Tax Cap for similar purposes in 1994.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;All we're trying to do is make sure our industry and our company are
not unfairly penalized,&quot; U.S. Sugar lobbyist Robert Coker told the
Tribune. &quot;We're talking about a very punitive, unfair tax on Florida
sugar farmers. This type of tax should not be levied through a paid petition
drive funded by a single group of extreme environmentalists.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The sugar tax amendment is being pushed by the Save Our Everglades Alliance,
which is financed primarily by Orlando environmentalist Mary Barley, according
to the Tribune. <BR>
<BR>
The Tax Cap Committee is also trying to get three other amendments on the
ballot: a requirement that voters must approve all new taxes, a requirement
that states pay landowners whose property is devalued by regulations and
an easing of rules for getting other property rights amendments on future
ballots.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Dr. Daniel Canfield's findings will be released today in a report at the
Florida Lake Management Society's annual meeting. Canfield believes that
phosphorous inputs from the surrounding muck farms had little impact on
the bloom of thick algae that now chokes the lake. Instead, he says a 1947
hurricane stirred up nutrients and silt on the bottom of the lake, killing
important water plants on the bottom and allowing an algal population boom.<BR>
<BR>
If Canfield's theory is correct, Florida will be wasting the $20 million
approved by legislators this session to help buy the surrounding muck farms.
However, the St. John's Water Management District is sticking with its belief
that stopping the phosphorous-laden runoff will go a long way towards solving
the lake's problems.<BR>
<BR>
Canfield also said that a more feasible way to help the lake could be a
system of artificial reefs that would cut down on waves. That would cut
down on the stirring up of nutrients from the lake bottom that feed the
algae.<BR>
<BR>
But Canfield says that evidence shows that the lake was high in nutrients
before 19,000 acres of muck were drained to create post World War II farms.
Canfield believes the best solution to Lake Apopka's woes is a massive drawdown.
The Environmental Protection Agency suggested the same solution in 1979,
but couldn't muster support for the idea.<BR>
<BR>
SJWMD Director of Environmental Sciences Ed Lowe had little praise for Canfield's
theory.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This idea is not going to go too far down the road,&quot; Lowe told
the Sentinel. He added that most other scientists have supported the Water
District's stance.</BLOCKQUOTE>

thousands</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)-- Researchers from Texas to Pasco
County are trying to figure out why catfish have been rolling ashore since
late April, the Gainesville Sun reports.<BR>
<BR>
Beverly Roberts, research administrator for the Florida Marine Research
Institute in St. Petersburg, confirmed that the vast majority are catfish,
though other species of fish have been found. The veteran red tide researcher
has not found any obvious cause for the fish kill.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So far everything coming in to us at the lab has been too decomposed
to really learn anything from,&quot; Roberts said. &quot;What we are being
told is that the fish have been acting erratically -- swimming in circles
or thrashing at the surface -- and then dying. We don't think this is an
oxygen depletion problem because the deaths seem to be occurring throughout
the day, not just in the morning when oxygen deaths tend to occur in fish.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Marine researchers say they need to study the fish immediately after they
die. Roberts said anyone interested in assisting the lab should place the
freshly dead fish carefully in a plastic bag, put it on ice and call the
lab at (813) 896- 8626 to make arrangements to have the fish shipped to
St. Petersburg.<BR>

down Rodman Dam</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)-- Though money is tight on Capitol
Hill for new projects, U.S. Senators Connie Mack and Bob Graham intend to
ask Congress for $2 million to open Rodman Dam and restore the natural course
of the Ocklawaha River, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
The Rodman Dam was originally intended to create a navigable section of
the Cross Florida Barge Canal. Congress officially killed the project 50
years after it was first authorized. It was branded an environmental disaster
in the making.<BR>
<BR>
Even if the federal government allocated the money for the project, a battle
in state legislature would have to be won. A leading critic, state Sen.
George Kirkpatrick D-Gainesville, said he was not aware of the congressional
end-run.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;As far as I know, the Legislature still makes the law around here,
not the U.S. Congress,&quot; he said Tuesday. &quot;Both houses of the Legislature
said they did not want to do the restoration. We'll just have to see what
really turns out.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But restoration advocates say the dam is overdue to be removed. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It does an enormous number of services to mankind free of charge&quot;
Marjorie Carr said of a free flowing river. She also said it would cost
nothing to maintain, while the dam and reservoir are economic drains.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)--The House voted yesterday to roll
back the federal gasoline tax by 4.3 cents per gallon -- in time for the
summer driving season -- the Florida Times-Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
The 301- 108 vote to repeal the tax was a quick and popular move in the
election year. However, the tax cut would only be effective until the end
of the year and cannot become law until the logjam is broken in the Senate.
But Senate Majority Whip Trent Lott, R-Miss, said the bill would probably
not come up until early June, after the Senate returns from a weeklong Memorial

<BLOCKQUOTE>OLDSMAR--(EnviroWorld)--The Oldsmar City Council got things
started Tuesday by giving their blessings to a preliminary idea of Keep
Pinellas County Beautiful to build an environmental center at Canal Park,
reported the St. Petersburg Times. <BR>
<BR>
The center would hopefully draw students and adults from East Lake, Tarpon
Springs and other areas in North Pinellas throught a nature museum, nature
trails, outdoor and indoor classrooms, and community center and meeting
room.<BR>
<BR>
Tony LaPorte, a member of the KPCB board, told the council that the proposed
Oldsmar Center would be similar to one at Moccasin Lake Nature Park in Clearwater
and two others in St. Petersburg.<BR>
<BR>
The Oldsmar council did not make any financial commitments to the project
but it did authorize LaPorte to draft a tentative plan for the center and
its funding. A committee of city officials, residents and business leaders
will review the draft before it is presented to the City Council. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>PASCO COUNTY--(EnviroWorld)--Because Pasco County's reclaimed
wastewater is in such demand during the late-spring months, drinking water
is being used to meet the demand, according to the St. Petersburg Times.
<BR>
<BR>
This is ironic because the purpose of reclaimed water is to conserve drinking
water. At times during this spring, Pasco County officials have pumped up
to 100,000 gallons of drinking water daily into the reclaimed supply to
supplement it.<BR>
<BR>
Pasco's assistant county administrator for utilities, Doug Bramlett said
that at least 3-million gallons have been pumped into the reclaimed water
system this spring. <BR>
<BR>
Bramlett said that there will no longer be the need to add drinking water
after an expansion of the reclaimed system is completed over the next year.
<BR>
<BR>
The water is used by 10 Pasco golf courses and as many as 800 homeowners
connected with he system. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>MIAMI--(EnviroWorld)--Dade county commissioners say they cannot
allow Sunset Drive to be named after South Florida's premiere environmentalist,
106-year old Marjory Stoneman Douglas, while she is still alive, the Miami
Herald reported. <BR>
<BR>
The state agreed to the request by a group of South Dade women, but Dade
County said no. County commissioners restricted street-naming last year
when banker Abel Holtz, whose name adorns Northeast Second Avenue, was sentenced
to jail. The incident was an embarrassment to the city and the ordinance
doesn't allow for any exceptions, not even for the internationally esteemed
environmentalist. <BR>
<BR>
Carole Cotton, who organized the push for the street's naming is upset with
the decision. &quot;This community needs to say thank you while [Douglas]
is alive,&quot; she said. <BR>
<BR>
Commissioner Katy Sorenson agrees with Cotton. Today she plans to introduce
an amendment to the law that would allow the naming to occur. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Marjory Stoneman Douglas is Dade county's original Earth Mother and
it is a tribute to her and what she has done for us,&quot; said Sorenson.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WEST PALM BEACH--(EnviroWorld)--Attorney J. Clinton Scott's
request to build more homes than allowed on 120 acres west of Boca Raton
was rejected by county commissioners Monday, reported The Palm Beach Post.<BR>
<BR>
This was the first challenge to new growth rules in the 20,500-acre Agricultural
Reserve, setting the stage for a potentially precedent-setting legal battle.<BR>
<BR>
Scott said he will file a complaint within weeks under a 1995 state law
giving landowners new powers to sue government agencies over actions reducing
their property values. <BR>
<BR>
The complaint must be submitted six months prior to the law suit being filed
in order to give the county and land owner a chance to settle out of court.
This is the first complaint of its sort in Palm Beach County since the law
was enacted. <BR>
<BR>
Scott opposes county rules that allow him to build 119 homes on only 20
percent of his property. He wants the right to build 358 homes anywhere
on the land. Commissioners rejected his arguments by a 6-0 margin. <BR>
<BR>
The rules were enacted last year after a six-year moratorium on construction
in the Agricultural Reserve, which stretches along the western edges of
Boca Raton, Delray and Boynton Beaches.<BR>
<BR>
The rules are enforced to maintain the rural features of the area, while
giving landowners a development option. </BLOCKQUOTE>

the fault of Lake Apopka's decline</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WINTER GARDEN -- (EnviroWorld) -- A new study says agricultural
runoff from surrounding muck farms is not the cause of pollution that has
nearly killed Lake Apopka, once a premier bass-fishing playground, the Associated
Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
The study's researchers contend the true culprit is a 1947 hurricane that
scoured the lake bottom and killed most of the grasses and other plants.
They believe adding a new $20 million to the plan to buy some of the farmland
around the lake would accomplish nothing.<BR>
<BR>
The report was released by Daniel Canfield and Roger Bachmann, University
of Florida lake experts, at a gathering of environmentalists and scientists
in Ocala on Wednesday.<BR>
<BR>
Lake managers, however, criticized the theory, arguing that most scientific
research supports the view of the St. Johns River Water Management District,
which is running the cleanup effort. State and local environmental officials
blame decades of fertilizer runoff from area farms with destroying the lake,
which has already cost nearly $60 million in restoration projects.<BR>
<BR>
The Florida Legislature approved $20 million this month to help buy some
of the remaining farms most scientists say are the primary polluters. The
farms took over 19,000 acres of Lake Apopka's northern shore to produce
more crops during World War II. <BR>
<BR>
Rains from periodic farm drainage efforts have dumped millions of gallons
of phosphorus-rich water into the lake. But Canefield and Bachmann say their
research shows the lake was rich in phosphorus before the farms started
to discharge fertilizer in the 1940s. Ending the fertilizer flow won't solve
anything, they argue.<BR>
<BR>
Farmers welcomed the new research, with hopes they won't be forced to sell
their property to the state. In lieu of the new research, Canefield and
Bachmann have suggested a massive draining of the 31,000-acre lake to allow
plants to take root and kill the ever-present algae that blocks the sunlight.</BLOCKQUOTE>

programs</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CRYSTAL RIVER -- (EnviroWorld) -- Jack Critchfield, chairman
and chief executive officer of Florida Progress, Florida Power's parent
company, has offered to use his company's influence to help expand the Marine
Science Station's programs in Crystal River, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Critchfield said he would support any grant proposals or permit requests
made on behalf of the science station, which is run by the Citrus County
School District, though he couldn't offer any funding to the project himself.
<BR>
<BR>
Currently, a key component in the expansion is the acquisition of a 20-acre
tract on the Salt River. A private, non-profit group formed to support the
Marine Science Station, recently applied for $600,000 in state grant money
for the purchase of the Salt 44 condominiums.<BR>
<BR>
Additional expansion plans for the center include providing an aquaculture
program involving area universities that would reintroduce the bay scallop
into the Gulf of Mexico off Citrus County; other educational programs for
all ages; research activities involving high school and university students;
and an elder hostel to introduce groups to the marine environment.<BR>
<BR>
Currently, the station, which is not open to the public, is limited in what
it can do because of lack of funding.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>APALACHICOLA -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Dr. Julian G. Bruce State
Park on St. George Island will reopen tomorrow, after spending seven months

<BR>
The park closed when Hurricane Opal ripped through the Panhandle in October
of 1995. The storm wiped out roads and sand dunes, and destroyed 22 boardwalks,
162 signs and miles of St. George's famous sea oats.<BR>
<BR>
Park rangers and volunteers worked together to rebuild the roads and boardwalks,
and to replant thousands of sea oats. The first five miles of the park is
ready to use, but the east end of the island, a haven to fishermen, will
not reopen for several months.<BR>

Ribbon-cutting ceremonies will begin at 11 a.m. on Friday, and admission
will be free for the day. After Friday, the fee will return to its standard

<BLOCKQUOTE>BOCA RATON -- (EnviroWorld) -- Though Atlas Waste Magic was
recently cited for waste-handling violations by the state Department of
Environmental Protection, they will likely be granted permission from the
same agency to expand their operations, the Sun-Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
Atlas Waste Magic's 51-acre yard on Lox Road, near the Arthur R. Marshall
Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge, was recently charged with improperly
storing leaking car batteries and motor oil containers. In addition, commercial
waste was not being sorted properly according to the company's permit. Atlas
also received similar violations at its' Davie and Riviera Beach yards.<BR>
<BR>
Despite these violations, however, the DEP told the company it will grant
the request to expand its operations - increasing amount and type of trash
processed - adding another 1,500 cubic yards of waste hauled to the Lox
Road yard.<BR>
<BR>
Lee Hoefert, a DEP engineer, told the Sun-Sentinel, the violations would
not jeopardize Atlas Waste Magic's bid because the non-compliance letter
was a only warning, less serious than an actual notice of violation, which
has not been issued.</BLOCKQUOTE>

report: citrus inspector's actions show conflict of interest</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WINTER HAVEN -- (EnviroWorld) -- A report by the Inspector General
found that actions of the citrus inspector for the Florida Department of
Agriculture show a conflict of interest, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Lisa Young Rath is deputy director of the Fruit and Vegetable Inspection
Division; she is also a part-owner of some groves and has several family
members in the industry. According to the report, Rath ordered the release
of 6,280 gallons of unripe tangerine juice and showed favoritism towards
a Polk county packing house.<BR>
<BR>
Whether any actions will be taken by the Agriculture Department remain unclear.
While Ag Commissioner Bob Crawford's spokesman was quoted as calling Rath's
actions as &quot;questionable&quot; an official statement from the Agriculture
Department to the Inspector General said, &quot;We do not agree that the
fact (Rath has industry ties) ... is in itself a conflict, unless she used
those relationships in an inappropriate way.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Rath was appointed to the $60,000 a year position by Bob Crawford.</BLOCKQUOTE>

firms</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration earned a reputation in its first two decades for gung-ho
inspections that many businesses complained was antagonistic. As part of
attempts both to improve it's image and cut costs, the agency is no longer
targeting entire industries but individual firms with lots of workplace
industries, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
That should be good news to small-business owners, since businesses with
the most worker compensation claims are, not coincidentally, big employers.
For example, the top three Florida companies for claims in 1994 were Publix
Supermarkets, United Parcel Service and Walt Disney World.<BR>
<BR>
The 150 companies in the state with the most worker's compensation claims
will make OSHA's initial list. After an evaluation of each company's response
to worker complaints, OSHA will prioritize inspections.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The ones that work with us in a partnership will get the lowest priority
for inspection and the highest priority for assistance,&quot; Tampa OSHA
Director Larry Falck told the Tribune. &quot;And those that don't work with
us will get the reverse.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
OSHA is a division of the U.S. Department of Labor. The agency has been
under heavy pressure to become more business-friendly since the 1994 elections,
and legislation is making its way through Congress that would restrict OSHA's
power.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Corporation, an environmental management company based in Torrance, Calif.,
reported first quarter earnings of $400 million, down from a 1995 first
quarter of $424 million.<BR>
<BR>
The lower earnings were blamed on delays in funding Department of Defense
contracts as a result of the budget crisis, as well as sluggish demand from

<BLOCKQUOTE>AMARILLO, Texas -- (EnviroWorld) -- A Colorado company is using
a vacuum truck to suck live prairie dogs from their holes, the Tampa Tribune
reported. The enterprise is profitable because the animals are a valuable
pet in Japan.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;These little guys are worth $700 apiece,&quot; the inventor of the
prairie-dog vacuum, Gay Balfour, said. The vacuum only sucks out the smaller
of the rodents, which grow to about 30 centimeters.<BR>
<BR>
Balfour's company is named Dog Gone and has been in operation for five years.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- A National Science Foundation
survey found that many Americans were stumped by basic science questions,
The Associated Press reported. For example, of the 2006 adults surveyed,
only 44 percent knew that an electron was smaller than an atom. However,
85 percent knew that &quot;the oxygen we breathe&quot; comes from plants.<BR>
<BR>
More interesting, the survey found that 90 percent of college graduates
thought the benefits of research outweighed the risks, but only 48 percent
of those who did not complete high school agreed.<BR>
<BR>
Scientific ignorance does not stop at the newsroom door, either. An editorial
in today's Florida Times-Union credits gizzard shad with adding to Lake
Apopka's phosphorous levels. While harvesting the shad is intended to reduce
those levels in the polluted lake, the fish does not add to phosphorous
levels. Instead it consumes nutrient-rich plants and serves as a method
to concentrate the pollution.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)-- Florida Rock Industries threatened
to sue organized campaign opponents of its proposed cement in Newberry for
defamation, the Gainesville Sun reports.<BR>
<BR>
FRI officials issued an ultimatum to opponents to stop the spread of information
on hazardous waste burning and planting signs of opposition on the roadside
or be sued.<BR>
<BR>
FRI officials say opponents are deliberately using false information because
the company does not intend to burn hazardous waste. <BR>
<BR>
Opponents claim they are merely exercising their First Amendment rights
to voice environmental concerns about a plant with potentially dangerous
air emissions. Opponents have been spreading letters and a videotape illustrating
the effects of a similar plant in Texas that caused deformed livestock and
other purported health effects. <BR>
<BR>
A state hearing officer should rule soon whether FRI will be issued a state
environmental permit to build. </BLOCKQUOTE>

responses to the region's interlocking challenges.<BR>
<BR>
Features of the initiative include: regular interaction and communication
among grantees, coordination of requests and project design to assure that
ventures supported by the initiative complement each other and an emphasis
on experimentation, feedback and adaptation (not on end results).<BR>

president</STRONG> </A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Sierra Club, the nation's
largest grassroots environmental organization, has elected 23-year-old Adam
Werbach as its 46th President. Werbach is the youngest President elected
in the Sierra Club's 104-year history.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The environment is the primary issue that prompts this generation,
my generation, to take social and political action,&quot; offered Werbach.
&quot;Our job is to get the word out to them and to give them a place to
act on their anxieties and convictions. My goal is to make that place the
Sierra Club.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As a high school student, Werbach founded and served as the first director
of the Club's national student program, Sierra Student Coalition, which
has trained hundreds of student activists, registered hundreds of thousands
of new voters and involved tens of thousands of students in every state
with Sierra Club's conservation campaigns.<BR>
<BR>
Werbach also served for two years as a member of the Sierra Club's Board
of Directors and as a member of the Club's national membership committee
and volunteer development committee. He was named an &quot;Environmental
Hero&quot; during the Club's Centennial celebration in 1991.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>PORT ST. LUCIE--(EnviroWorld)--According to former employees,
toxic chemicals have been spilled and noxious fumes released routinely from
a company making bleach and packaging muriatic acid, reported The Tampa
Tribune.<BR>
<BR>
Inadequate construction and safeguards at the Allied Universal Corp. Plant,
located in a remote corner of southwest St. Lucie County, make pollution
unavoidable, said the former workers. Executives at the company dismiss
the accusations as retaliations of disgruntled workers, but two of the five
employees complained about the situation before they were fired. <BR>
<BR>
Certain company officials were concerned about the situation, too. Allied
Vice President Greg Francis wrote in a November memo that he thought the
St. Lucie Plant was &quot;an environmental nightmare waiting to happen.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Ricky Scott, former Allied Branch Manager, told investigators with the DEP
that chemical spills at the plant were a routine occurrence because of leaking
containment tubs. <BR>
<BR>
In some cases, the tubs had been eaten away by the acid they were meant
to contain. The leaks affected the grass and shrubs, Scott said. &quot;Acid
runoff goes directly into the ground,&quot; he told the DEP.<BR>
<BR>
Francis told The Tribune that the containment tubs were repaired in March.
He also acknowledged that, while fumes had been a problem, Allied has worked
to eliminate them. &quot;We're doing the responsible thing,&quot; he said,
&quot;we're improving.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
While insisting the plant is not polluting the area, Francis did acknowledge
that the plant doesn't have monitoring wells to check for pollution - allied
plants in Leesburg and Miami do. The company also operates in Georgia, Arkansas
and New Jersey. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>POLK CITY--(EnviroWorld)--On Friday, Polk County officials sent
a list of terms they want rectified to USA International Speedway in the
form of a consent agreement. <BR>
<BR>
The list was a reaction to two violations incurred by the company while
trying to expand a race track located in the Green Swamp.<BR>
<BR>
The infractions were adding more bleacher sets without getting an official
OK, and building a road through wetlands. State environmental officials
were not pleased that they were oblivious to the changes. <BR>
<BR>
The proposed agreement would prevent the speedway from holding any events
until required permits are obtained for the additional 2,000 bleacher seats.
Speedway officials are also required to cough up $5,000 to the county's
environmentally sensitive land buying program. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA--(EnviroWorld)--Some of the main evacuation routes on
both sides of Tampa Bay are under construction with June 1 marking the start
of hurricane season, reported The Tampa Tribune. <BR>
<BR>
However the construction barricades, causing traffic jams and frustrating
commuters, are designed to virtually vanish in the event of a full-scale
evacuation, said emergency and road officials.<BR>
<BR>
As soon as a hurricane watch is posted, road and law enforcement officials
would be on the telephone to emergency-response officials. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's not a problem that makes that big a difference,&quot; said Pinellas
County emergency management director David Bilodeau. &quot;You could literally
go through and, in 15 minutes, clear all the barricades,&quot; he said.
<BR>
<BR>
Road crews would expect to have at least four hours to complete the dismantling
process before an evacuation would be ordered. <BR>
<BR>
Projects are underway on Interstate 4 east of Tampa and on the Gandy Bridge
linking St. Pete and Tampa, both major evacuation routes.</BLOCKQUOTE>

EPA cleanup plans </STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TARPON SPRINGS--(EnviroWorld)--The U.S. EPA, which produced
many documents on the contaminated Stauffer Chemical property, has given
a watchdog group $50,000 to hire someone to translate the confusing reports
into layman's English, reported The St. Petersburg Times. <BR>
<BR>
The group, Pi-Pa-Tag (short for Pinellas-Pasco-Technical Assistant Grant),
will hire a technical advisor to scrutinize scientific studies of the hazardous
waste site and decipher the EPA's plans to clean it up. <BR>
<BR>
The group won't hire its advisor until at least next month, and the EPA
has already announced that it wants to begin cleanup on the 160-acre site.
The former plant on the Anclote River near the county line is on the Superfund
list of the nation's most polluted sites. <BR>
<BR>
The site is contaminated with above-normal levels of radiation and chemicals,
including arsenic and phosphorous. Arsenic is related to cancer and phosphorous
can damage the liver, kidneys, and other organs if ingested. <BR>
<BR>
The EPA has scheduled a public meeting for Wednesday to discuss their plans
to seal the hazardous wastes under a giant protective cap on about 40 acres
at the site.<BR>
<BR>
Besides putting a protective cap over 200,000 tons of chemical waste, the
EPA wants to pump cement into the ground under the capped area to keep contaminants
from leaching into groundwater. The groundwater also will be monitored.<BR>
<BR>
If the area is capped it will be covered with sod to look like a 10-foot-high
grassy hill. The area will be fenced and restrictions will prevent building
on the land. </BLOCKQUOTE>

The incident occurred at 8:21 p.m. Sunday at the College Park Publix, 2015
Edgewater Drive. Three people were treated for irritation to their eyes

endanger drinking water</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO -- (EnviroWorld) -- Central Florida's underground drinking
water supply is being threatened by contaminants that flow through drainage
wells, which control lake levels and keep streets from flooding, the Orlando
Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
There are nearly 400 wells in Orange, Seminole and Lake counties, flowing
directly into the Floridian aquifer. And with heavy rain, toxins, metals
and animals wastes often disappear underground into the aquifer.<BR>
<BR>
A series of studies by the Geological Survey has found chemicals such as
benzene, chloroform, toluene and methane in water pumped from the bottom
of the Orlando drainage wells. In addition, high levels of iron and manganese
also have been found above state limits.<BR>
<BR>
Experts often believe that the pollutants are diluted and filtered by the
fresh water contained in the aquifer, but it is not clear as to exactly
how much the spongelike rock layer can filter.<BR>
<BR>
A major concern stems from the DEP's approval to replace a crumbling well
on Lake Tennessee in Orlando last month, rather than closing it down to
prevent future contamination. In the past, the policy has been to simply
close down a well if a similar problem occurs and for the past 25 years,
the DEP and EPA have banned new ones from being built. Any new water discharges
sent underground must undergo expensive treatment to meet drinking water
standards, according to the Sentinel.<BR>
<BR>
The reason why the DEP is allowing the city to rebuild a new well is based
on the city's finances. Diverting water flow from wells requires an expensive
replumbing of Central Florida, where the money is not available.<BR>
<BR>
Vivian Garfein, local DEP administrator, told the Sentinel the change makes
sense because Orlando promises to improve the quality of the water going
down the new well. The discharge won't meet drinking water standards, but
will be better than the one it replaces, she said.<BR>
<BR>
The drainage wells are considered essential by many because they keep property
protected from flooding, but concern remains regarding potential disaster.
In 1984 a gasoline tanker overturned on Interstate 4 in downtown Orlando,
sending fuel flowing toward a drain well on Lake Luceren. Fortunately, crew
officials were able to divert the fuel, but a similar mishap could occur
again and nothing guarantees the city will remain safe, City Engineer Rick
Howard told the Sentinel.</BLOCKQUOTE>

in eating-up sludge </STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>OCOEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Bruce Eastman is hoping for big accomplishments
from little worms, the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
Eastman, a specialist with the Orange County Environmental Protection Department,
is looking to find out whether earthworms can effectively eliminate disease
causing viruses and bacteria from sludge, a byproduct of treated sewage.<BR>
<BR>
For two months, an experiment took place at the Ocoee waste-water plant,
where earthworms ate their way through 4,800 pounds of sludge. The experiment
was supposed to last until June, but ended last week when the worms ate
everything that was edible, according to the Sentinel.<BR>
<BR>
Laboratory results on the sludge will take a month, but Eastman and Barnell
Logue, president of The American Earthworm Co. of Orlando, which supplied
the worms, are optimistic that the worms can be used to help kill pathogens
in the soil. In fact, the semihazardous waste could be turned into high
quality potting soil after the worms have their way with it.<BR>
<BR>
Currently, most sludge is shipped from urban areas to sod farms and cattle
ranches, at the cost of the taxpayers. Ocoee spends more than $45,000 each
year to ship its sludge to a sod company.<BR>
<BR>
If test results are good, the experiment will likely be expanded to five
acres at the Ocoee plant. Worm-treated sludge will then be tested and sent
to local nurseries as a soil additive during the experiment.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- The driver of a red Toyota pickup
with a trailer carrying pool chemicals lost control of his vehicle in the
northbound lane of Memorial Highway in Tampa, causing the trailer to flip
and chemicals to spill, the St. Petersburg Times reported. The chemicals
included 40 gallons of liquid chlorine, nearly 7 gallons of muriatic acid
and an unknown amount of dry powder chlorine. <BR>
<BR>
The driver, Dorian Lee Smith, 22, of Tampa was taken to St. Joseph's Hospital

Travelers heading to Tampa International Airport were rerouted for nearly

Citadel Island has 6 acres of dry woods, 29 acres of wet marshes and a canal
lot in a neighboring subdivision. It is part of the estate of developer
H.P. Demery. An auction of the land last September only brought in one bid
for $300,000, but the listing agent, Sotheby's International Realty believes

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- Truck drivers and entomologist agree,
there have been less love-bugs gumming up windshields this season, the Tampa
Tribune reported. Though cool weather earlier in the year may have delayed
their emergence, some entomologists believe the insect's natural predators
are finally catching up with the food supply.<BR>
<BR>
Among love-bug consumers are robins, quail, earwigs, beetle larvae, centipedes
and, of course, passengers in convertibles.<BR>
<BR>
Love-bug populations typically peak twice a year in Florida -- once during
April and May, then again in late August and September. The first U.S. reports
of the creatures were in Louisiana 70 years ago, according to the Tribune.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- A trial judge Tuesday dismissed
a lawsuit challenging the net ban, the Associated Press reported.The lawsuit
had been filed by a group of five commercial netters and fish processors
and argued that voters did not realize the severity of the ban's economic
impact.<BR>
<BR>
Circuit Judge Philip Padovano rejected that argument, writing that he couldn't
strike down the amendment because it didn't violate any basic rights. But
he said his ruling shouldn't be taken as an &quot;attempt to minimize the
social and economic issues&quot; facing the commercial fishing industry
in the wake of the ban.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;However, the voters evidently reasoned that the ultimate harm would
be far greater if they did not take some action to protect the state's marine
resources,&quot; the judge wrote. &quot;The citizens of Florida made that
choice, and it would be presumptuous of this court to assume that they did
not understand the issue.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The ban, approved by 72 percent of voters, prohibited gill nets in all Florida
Waters, and the use of nets larger than 500 square feet within 9 miles of
the Gulf coast and 3 miles of the Atlantic coast.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Public Service Commission
has begun to hedge on a state-of-the-art coal gasification plant that Tampa
Electric Co. has been excitedly promoting, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
PSC officials are worried that the $500 million price tag could be an unnecessary
burden on TECO's customers.<BR>
<BR>
Joseph Jenkins, head of the division that regulates electric utilities at
the Florida Public Service Commission told the Times, &quot;It's probably
the most expensive power plant in the Southeastern United States.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The plant will super-heat coal to create natural gas. The process is more
efficient than traditional coal-fired power plants and much cleaner, according
to the company.<BR>
<BR>
But PSC officials said the cost of the plant may have risen too far beyond
a 1991 estimate of $380 million. The commission will hold hearings in July
to discuss the plant. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's a bit frustrating to think that after all of the regulation,
all of the oversight, all of the hearings and the permit processes . . .
that there could be more questions,&quot; company spokesman Mike Mahoney
told the Times. &quot;But we are not concerned. This power plant is moving
ahead on schedule.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The plant is located in southwestern Polk County and was built with a $130
million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy. It's capacity is 250 megawatts,
enough to power 56,000 homes.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>MELBOURNE--(EnviroWorld)-- Aided by heavy rains, hydrilla plants
are clogging up two lakes that feed into Melbourne's main water supply,
the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
The water level has been so high in lakes Seagrass and Hell N' Blazes that
workers cannot spray the pesky water weeds.<BR>
<BR>
It is feared that the heavy cover of hydrilla will break apart during the
summer rains and clog intaking pipes in Lake Washington, the major source
of water for the city. <BR>
<BR>
Water managers usually treat the weed with a nontoxic chemical that destroys
it over a period o weeks in the spring when when water levels are the lowest.
Over the last two years Brevard County has received over 140 inches of rain,
keeping the water levels high and sending water into the marshlands much
of the year.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK--(EnviroWorld)-- Of the 69 endangered
species in Florida, no other has endured such a steep, sudden decline as
the Cape Sable seaside sparrow, reports the Miami Herald.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This bird, more than many of the other species, is the proverbial
canary in the mine,&quot; said Craig Johnson, supervisor of the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service's South Florida Ecosystem Office. &quot;Its survival
is so closely tied to those wet prairies around the edges of the Everglades.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
More than half of all Cape Sable sparrows have vanished in the last three
years. The sparrows had a population of 6,000 for about 15 years since going
on the endangered species list in 1976. Today, only 2,500 remain. Most inhabit
marshes where one wildfire or hurricane might destroy them, ecologists say.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)-- Archer residents won a reprieve
Tuesday that would cease dumping for four-years, the Gainesville Sun reports.<BR>
<BR>
Alachua County commissioners voted 4-0 against extending the life of Southwest
landfill by piling trash 55 feet higher. The commissioners vote is expected
to close the landfill near Archer by mid-1998 when the present capacity
is exhausted.<BR>
<BR>
Since the county's future plans for waste disposal are in flux, County Public
Works Director Ed Culpepper said the plan was &quot;premature&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
The vote does sooth the town's anger over having to live with the litter,
odors, truck traffic and other related nuisances with having a landfill
in their backyards.<BR>

Commissioner Chairperson Margaret Eppes said she believed the county should
be able to develop a new waste disposal facility in the next two years.

attacks are expected to increase</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- As beach weather arrives in
earnest, a Floridian shark expert predicted on Wednesday, that more than
40 people will be attacked by sharks on the East Coat this year, continuing
a steady increase as more people spend more time in the water, the Gainesville
Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
Few, if any of the attacks will prove fatal, and recent history suggests
people swimming or surfing north of the Carolinas have little reason to
fear a shark bite, said George Burgess of the Florida Museum of National
History in Gainesville. Burgess oversees the International Shark Attack
File, a worldwide registry of shark attacks.<BR>
<BR>
Florida, which has already seen two shark attacks so far this year, will
probably experience about 25 to 30 before the year is out.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>PENSACOLA -- (EnviroWorld) -- Scientists believe the deaths
of hundreds of hardhead catfish in Perdido Bay may be related to similar
kills elsewhere along the Gulf Coast, the Associated Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
The catfish began washing ashore Sunday in the brackish bay on the Florida-Alabama
border, creating a huge stench. Other fish species appear to be unaffected.<BR>
<BR>
Researchers are studying similar catfish kills from Texas to Southwest Florida,
looking for a possible common cause.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm suspicious since this is just catfish and I'm wondering if it's
the same thing,&quot; said Dick Fancher, environmental administrator for
special projects in the Pensacola office of the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Gov. Lawton Chiles on Wednesday
signed a bill that would revive a program to clean up leaky underground
petroleum storage tanks, the Tampa Tribune reported. Flaws in the 10-year-old
program led lawmakers to put it on hold last year.<BR>
<BR>
Previously, companies paid to clean up sites and then billed the state,
but costs ran out of control and some of the worst sites remained untouched.
The state currently owes more than $300 million in backlogged reimbursements
and 11,000 eligible sites remain contaminated.<BR>
<BR>
Under the new law, the state will borrow money to pay off the debt and spend
between $60 million and $70 million annually to clean additional spills.
In addition, the measure contains strict new approval measures to combat
fraud and ensure the worst sites are cleaned up first.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>APOPKA -- (EnviroWorld) -- Gov. Lawton Chiles can be found on
the shores of Lake Apopka today for the signing of a $20 million cleanup
bill, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Chiles planned to formally sign the
bill this morning at the Tanner Auditorium in Winter Garden<BR>
<BR>
Earlier this month, the Legislature approved appropriating $20 million as
a down payment on 14,000 acres of muck-farm land along the northern shore
of the highly polluted lake.<BR>
<BR>
For years, the lake has been polluted by discharges from the citrus industry,
municipalities and the vegetable farms on the shore of the lake. The muck
farms, however, are the only remaining direct sources of pollution into
the lake.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Florida will spend $33.3 million
to buy more than 40,000 acres of land in the Panhandle swamp named Tates
Hell. The governor and Cabinet approved the purchase on Wednesday, the Orlando
Sentinel and Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
The purchase will give the state ownership of 60 percent of the 214,000-acre
area named for Cebe Tate, a mythical wanderer who was lost in the impenetrable
wetland, according to folklore. The Tates Hell region is in Franklin and
Liberty counties, and runs south from the Apalachicola National Forest to
the Gulf of Mexico, creating more than 750,000 acres of U.S. and state-owned
woods and wetlands.<BR>
<BR>
From the purchase, the state will work to restore the natural flow of surface
water to the Gulf of Mexico by filling in many of the ditches dug by timber
companies in the past. Officials hope this will improve water quality dramatically.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, the land purchase will create a 750,000-acre corridor of government-owned
land where the largest of Florida's five black bear populations can grow.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Forty thousand acres of habitat for the black bear and so forth is
a nice piece of land. Not many of those big ones left,&quot; Department
of Environmental Protection Secretary Virginia Wetherell told the Sentinel.<BR>
<BR>
The governor and Cabinet unanimously approved the purchases of three parcels
totaling 40,247 under the state's Conservation and Recreation Lands Program.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>HUDSON -- (EnviroWorld) -- State Sen. Jack Latvala is hoping
for a compromise that will settle a lingering sewer issue for some Hudson
residents, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
The issue stems from resident's malfunctioning septic systems that overflow
during Florida's rainy season, leaving them without use of their bathrooms.<BR>
<BR>
The sewer service provider in the area, Hudson Utilities, is looking to
prevent the overflow by expanding its system to 2,000 unconnected homes,
but can't do it until its lender provides a $3 million loan. In turn, the
lender won't provide the money until Pasco County allows the Utility to
put liens on property owners who don't pay the $1,600 connection fee. The
County won't grant Hudson Utilities that power because some residents oppose
it. <BR>
<BR>
Under Latvala's plan, before any part of a neighborhood can be connected,
a majority of its residents must vote to grant Hudson Utilities the lien
authority it desires, according to the Times.<BR>
<BR>
The proposal is being reviewed by County Administrator John Gallagher and
his staff, and then may be brought back to commissioners for consideration.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>BOCA RATON -- (EnviroWorld) -- International Foam Solutions,
Inc., has recently developed a new, environmentally safe technology used
to reduce and recycle polystyrene - the most common form of plastic.<BR>
<BR>
The process takes the polystyrene foam, shreds it and then sprays it with
Styro Solve, a blend of natural citrus-based and other biodegradable ingredients.
This process reduces the material's original size by 90 percent. The end
product is a non-toxic Poly-Gel, which is shipped back to IFS and its affiliate
recyclers, and is subsequently recycled and converted back into reusable
polystyrene.<BR>
<BR>
By reducing the amount of waste, municipalities, waste management operators,
manufacturers and distributors will benefit. In addition, foam used for
packing and shipping can be recycled and used for other products.<BR>
<BR>
For more information on the process, contact IFS at (800) 856-3626.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>HOMOSASSA SPRINGS--(EnviroWorld)-- The Manatee Advisory Committee
addressed revisions to the Manatee Protection Plan at a well-attended meeting
on Wednesday, the St. Petersburg Times reported. The proposed changes could
clear up confusion over boat speeds, end the summer sport zone in Kings
Bay and support a manatee education center for Crystal River.<BR>
<BR>
The committee discussed actions being taken to protect the manatees. Gary
Maidhof, County Environmental Planner, said that the manatee deaths seem
to be fewer than before the plan was implemented and that the manatee population
has increased since the sanctuaries were established by federal officials.
<BR>
<BR>
Cameron Shaw, manager of the Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge, disagreed,
saying that the trends have been around longer than the protection plan.<BR>
<BR>
The committee discussed various slow- and idle-speed zones in Kings Bay,
the area with the highest concentration of manatees each winter. Kings Bay
contains a summer sport zone and differing opinions were raised on whether
or not to eliminate that zone. Patti Thompson of the Save the Manatee Club
said there is information that shows that manatees use the area in the summer
also. No decision was made on the issue.<BR>
<BR>
Committee members agreed to suggest that a statement be placed in the plan
noting that a manatee interpretive education center is needed in Crystal
River for divers who would be in the water with manatees.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The concept of ecosystem management
was hailed by environmentalists, at least until it was implemented by Department
of Environmental Protection chief Virginia Wetherell with Gov. Lawton Chiles'
blessing. An article in June's Florida Trend reports that many former champions
of the concept, including the Florida Audubon Society, have now become critics
of it's practice.<BR>
<BR>
Ecosystem management was supposed to be a way to broaden protection for
whole systems without increasing regulations, thus allowing the uplands
of a valuable wetland to get some measure of development oversight. The
first time it was used in Florida was in 1992,when former Department of
Environmental Regulation head Carol Browner orchestrated an agreement with
Walt Disney World that allowed for more development of Lake Buena Vista
wetlands if the big mouse stayed out of Walker Ranch -- critical upland
property.<BR>
<BR>
But under Wetherell and Chiles, a system has been set up that divides the
state into 24 Ecosystem Management Areas (following riverine watersheds).
If a potential developer chooses, she may work with a special board of representatives
from interest groups and regulators to make a deal.<BR>
<BR>
Linda Young, publisher of the &quot;Pro Earth Times,&quot; told Florida
Trend that the result of this system is to &quot;take something that originated
as a good concept -- and still is -- and bastardize it into a slick marketing
plan for the rollback of environmental laws.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Environmentalists are worried that businesses could make sweetheart deals
with political appointees to the boards and avoid adhering to regulations.
But Ernie Barnett, DEP Director of Ecosystem Planning, told Florida Trend,
that misconceptions about ecosystem management were fueling much of the
concern.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The existing standards don't go away. The only thing we'll trade away
is freedom from some of the processes that applicants for permits have to
go through.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Ironically, it was business interests who were squirming over the concept's
potential before it was implemented. But with only a few pilot projects
off the drawing board, evidence is lacking on whether ecosystem management
is boon or bane.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>ALATAMONTE SPRINGS -- (EnviroWorld) -- Residents who lobbied
hard and won $1 million from the state, to improve flood conditions in their
neighborhood, say the work can't start soon enough, the Orlando Sentinel
reported.<BR>
<BR>
In fact, the summer rains have already caused flooding in some meadows,
and water levels are rising close to bridges in The Springs, a community
near the Little Wekiva River.<BR>
<BR>
The community is on the downstream end of a heavily developed area. The
development has increased runoff into the river and resulted in higher water
levels and heavy erosion of river banks. The riverbank sediment winds up
on the river bottom near The Springs and other neighborhoods where the river
slows, further raising levels. Add to the mix some dense aquatic plant growth,
and the result is a problem that the state legislators agreed to spend $1
million on.<BR>
<BR>
But 90 anxious residents, some with standing water in their yards, met recently
to ask when the flood control projects would begin, the Orlando Sentinel
reported.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The land borders the St. Johns River and has been used for timbering and

<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE --(EnviroWorld) -- Beginning June 30 scores of
civilians and military personnel working on Naval bases in Duval county
will have to submit to the annual emissions testing required for the county,
according to the Florida Times-Union. While most of the workers do not live
in Duval county, any vehicle that was manufactured after 1974 and is on
the base more than 60 days a year must meet emissions requirements. The
annual fee for the testing is $10.<BR>
<BR>
Auto exhausts are tested in Duval county to try and cut down on air pollution.
The 1992 amendment to the Clean Air Act requires federal facilities to comply
to the local emissions standards. The Pentagon has not made a decision on
whether or not to require testing on those military personnel vehicles registered
outside of Jacksonville.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)-- Though wildflowers dominate a field
that used to be a hazardous waste site, the cleanup job is not complete,
the Gainesville Sun reports.<BR>
<BR>
While soil excavation at the Florida Department of Transportation site has
been completed, groundwater cleanup, which could take up to eight years,
has only begun in Fairbanks, said DOT's project manager Curtis Barnes.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;In a lot of respects, it means closure,&quot; Barnes said. &quot;The
site is clean other than just treating the contaminated water.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The DOT began questioning the dump site when it became known that the site
was becoming hazardous. From 1956 o 1982 mostly paints, solvents and other
chemicals had been dumped there. In 1993, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency listed it on its Superfund hazardous waste list. State taxpayers
footed the $50 million bill to clean the site.<BR>
<BR>
Area residents are invited for a tour and briefing of the 10-acre site Saturday.

Cat fate now part of election-season propaganda</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)-- In an attempt to attract support
from animal lovers, some state politicians up for re-election have added
saving the Waldo Cat to their agenda, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
The three-year-old feline is believed to be an endangered Florida panther.
It was captured last year in Waldo, a rural North Florida community just
east of Gainesville. <BR>
<BR>
State Rep. Bob Casey, R-Gainesville, declared he is on a mission to &quot;rescue&quot;
the animal from captivity. He is also seeking help from other legislators.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I feel all this should be handled through the legislative committee
process. It's a state issue,&quot; said Casey. &quot;We can't just wash
our hands from what has happened to these animals.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Casey said he and about 200 other animal activists want the animal released
into the North Florida woods again.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We think that if there is any sort of panther population in North
Florida, Waldo will lead us to them,&quot; Casey said, noting that panthers
once roamed freely across much of the state until their population decreased
and thy migrated to an area near the Everglades.</BLOCKQUOTE>

fish kill attributed to Red Tide</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--by Shawn McGee-- Thousands of fish
that have been washing up along the Gulf coasts of Florida, Louisiana and
Texas are believed to have been affected by red tide, the Department of
Environmental Protection said Thursday.<BR>
<BR>
Red Tide, the same organism believed to have nearly wiped out the Florida
manatee, is a plant-like organism that produces toxins fatal to marine life.
Simultaneously, an apparently unrelated catfish kill is occurring in the
panhandle near Pensacola.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are fortunate to have detected the cause of this multi-species
fish kill so quickly and we will continue to monitor its extent and distribution,&quot;
said Virginia Vail, Bureau Chief, Office of Fisheries Management and Assistance
Services. &quot;Our next priority is to focus on trying to find the cause
of the recent catfish die-offs. Sampling is continuing in those areas where
only dead catfish have been found.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In some of the cases red tide is believed to be affecting the catfish, but
DEP said they believe there is a pathogen invading the waters.<BR>
<BR>
The red tide became more noticeable to the public after Memorial Day weekend
when many people visited the waters infected with the red tide which has
reddish-brown blooms. There have been no reports of people getting ill from
eating the fish, though it is recommended not to eat fish that are displaying
abnormal behavior such as lethargy or swimming in circles. <BR>
<BR>
However, some people may react to the red tide toxins with symptoms of respiratory
irritations, coughing and watery eyes.<BR>
<BR>
A hot line has been set up for anyone noticing fish kills or live fish acting
peculiar. The information will assist researchers in finding answers. To
report such incidents call 1-800-636-0511.</BLOCKQUOTE>

layer may have hope after all, scientists say</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)-- The ozone hole may begin to close
in the next 10 years if ozone-destroying chemicals continue to decline,
The Associated Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This is the very beginning of a change,&quot; said Stephen A. Montzka,
a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientist. &quot;This
is the first step toward the goal of closing the ozone hole.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The high-altitude layer serves as a natural barrier against ultraviolet
radiation from the sun. Excessive UV levels are responsible for skin cancer
among humans and damage to many plants and animals.<BR>
<BR>
Ground-level measurements on three continents and two Pacific Ocean islands
detected reduction of the group of industrial chemicals that erode the ozone
layer, Montzka said.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;A detectable signal for ozone recovery is expected around 2005 or
2010,&quot; said Montzka, a researcher in the NOAA laboratory in Boulder,
Colo., one of eight co-authors of the study.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- As part of streamlining efforts,
the Environmental Protection Agency announced the publication of an emergency
spills planning guide. The &quot;One-Plan Guidance&quot; is designed to
provide &quot;a common sense option for meeting multiple emergency planning
requirements under eight different federal regulations.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Intended to help facilities meet varied planning requirements of federal
agencies for oil and hazardous waste spills, the guide can be obtained by
calling the RCRA/Superfund Hotline at 1-800-424-9346 or 703-412-9810. It

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- Businesses that treat, store,
recycle or dispose of hazardous material produced by other industries must
now use the best air-pollution control technology available, the Environmental
Protection Agency announced May 31.<BR>
<BR>
EPA's final rule for air toxics for off-site waste and recovery operations
will affect approximately 250 facilities. The agency estimates the rule
will cut toxic emissions by 43,000 tons per year -- an 82 percent reduction
from current levels-- and reduce emissions of volatile organic<BR>
compounds (VOCs) by 51,000 tons annually -- an 82 percent reduction.<BR>
<BR>
Air toxics are those pollutants known or suspected of causing cancer, birth
defects or other serious health effects and include compounds such as benzene
and methylene chloride.<BR>
<BR>
Operations affected by this rule include hazardous waste treatment, storage
and disposal; industrial wastewater treatment; solvent recycling and used
oil recycling. Exempt are incinerators, municipal solid waste landfills,
publicly-owned sewage treatment works and cleanup activities at Superfund
and other remediation sites.<BR>
<BR>
EPA will require the affected operations to use maximum achievable control
technology,a term generally defined by the Clean Air Act as the best demonstrated
pollution control technology or practice in current use by similar sources.
Today's action will appear soon in the Federal Register, but accessible
now through EPA's electronic bulletin board system, the Technology Transfer
Network (TTN) at 919-541-5742 (backup number for access problems is 919-541-5384)

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- While automobile exhaust and
smokestacks are the most obvious contributors to urban air pollution, another
significant source are the small combustion engines in every garage. These
engines, on lawn mowers, leaf blowers, and chain saws are largely unregulated
and, combined, produce enough nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons to nearly
rival the pollution of cars and power plants.<BR>
<BR>
May 31, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it had signed a &quot;statement
of principles&quot; with manufacturers of lawn and garden equipment, the
small engine industry and state air quality representatives to reduce emissions
from handheld gasoline engines which produce less than 25 percent horsepower.<BR>
The targets of the statement are the the Phase 2 emission reduction standards,
to be reached from 2002 through 2005 and which would reduce ozone-forming
compounds of hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxides 30 percent from the Phase 1
levels. The program also would include<BR>
in-use testing to ensure compliance with the standards over the lifetime
of the engines. <BR>
<BR>
The agreement includes a particulate matter and toxics test program for
evaluating levels of the pollutants from handheld engines and would allow
manufacturers to label qualifying engines<BR>
as reducing more pollution than required. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>MOUNTAIN HOME, Ark. -- (EnviroWorld) -- The illegal burying
of thirty 55-gallon drums of chemical waste, including styrene and acetone,
at an Arkansas business led to a May 10 felony plea agreement by one businessman
and the indictment of two others on felony charges on May 17, the Environmental
Protection Agency announced.<BR>
<BR>
John Thomas Anglin, of Custom Quality Gel-Coat Inc., also known as C.Q.
Inc., plead guilty to<BR>
failing to report illegal disposal of hazardous wastes under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).<BR>
<BR>
Walter H. Schluterman and Ivan L. Due, both company officers, were indicted
on one felony<BR>
count of violating CERCLA, two felony counts of violating the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act and one felony count of conspiracy.<BR>
<BR>
The illegal dump was uncovered during a site inspection by the state as
C.Q. was in the early stages of building a storage silo over the dump site.
Anglin faces a possible three years in prison and a $250,000 fine under
the terms of the plea agreement. Schluterman and Due each face up to 23
years in prison and $1 million in fines if they are convicted on all counts.
The case was<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WHEELING, W.Va. -- (EnviroWorld) -- Three current and former
executives of Newell Specialty Chemical Co., a West Virginia chemical manufacturer,
were each sentenced on May 28 for criminal Clean Water Act violations, the
Environmental Protection Agency announced.<BR>
<BR>
Garland A. Middendorf, currently chief executive officer and majority stockholder
of Newell; Stuart W.Critchley, minority stockholder and former vice president
for operations; and John B. Fabriele, Jr., minority stockholder and former
vice president in charge of sales, received four month jail sentences to
be followed by four months of home detention and a $6,000 fine.<BR>
<BR>
The three pleaded guilty in January to one count each of negligently discharging
pollutants into a tributary of the Ohio River above the limits allowed by
Newell's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit. <BR>
<BR>
Newell, which is located in northern West Virginia, manufactures specialty
chemicals<BR>
for private customers. The company itself pleaded guilty in January to conspiring
to commit fraud in connection with the disposal of hazardous wastes generated
during manufacturing and will be sentenced June 10. This case was investigated
by EPA's Criminal Investigation Division, the West Virginia Department of
Environmental Protection and the FBI.<BR>

faces building stipulations</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>FORT MYERS--(EnviroWorld)-- As the foundation just begins to
dry for Florida Gulf Coast University, the 10th and newest state-supported
institution, controversy is still unsettled, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
Experts working for the school say construction will make the environment
better, not damage it. However, cynics believe that is what they usually
hear in regards to any construction in similar areas.<BR>
<BR>
To obtain the building permit, the university had to agree to a 10-year
plan of environmental restoration of 277 acres of wetlands. Also, another
121 acres of drier upland would have to be improved and updated, and the
creation of 20 acres of new wetlands on the 760-acre site would need to
be arranged.<BR>
<BR>
The South Florida Water Management District and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
want this plan to work, at least to the extent that improvements will offset
other areas where the natural environment was disturbed before the university
was conceived.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Urbanization has its impacts. You can't sugarcoat that,&quot; said

overturns $5 million verdict</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>MIAMI--(EnviroWorld)-- A $5 million jury verdict was overturned
in an appeal in favor of South Florida Water Management District on Wednesday.
In the laconic one-paragraph per curiam, the Third District Court of Appeal
found that SFWMD was not responsible for a boating accident on the Biscayne
Canal.<BR>
<BR>
In 1987, Alan Taylor of Miami, a passenger in a boat, sustained severe head
injuries when his head hit a footbridge over the Biscayne Canal in North
Miami. Taylor, believing the bridge posed unreasonably dangerous conditions
for boaters on the canal, sued the District and the City of North Miami.
Taylor claimed the governmental parties should have removed the bridge or
posted more warning signs of danger. The trial court awarded him $5 million.<BR>
<BR>
The appellate court said the District was protected by sovereign immunity,
however. (Sovereign immunity protects governmental entities from liabilities
for which private parties might have been responsible.)<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But the court also said that, even if the District were a private
party, it would have no responsibility for the accident,&quot; said Paul
Nettleson, a Miami attorney who argued for the District.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;If the District had been legally held responsible for this unfortunate
accident, it could have led the closing of public access to public lands
and waters throughout the state,&quot; he said.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--Environmental activists and Gov.
Lawton Chiles' office are criticizing as inadequate a plan to protect wildlife
and important natural areas from Northeast Florida's rapid development.
<BR>
<BR>
Some of Jacksonville's largest landowners and development interests have
endorsed the proposal by the Northeast Florida Regional Planning Council.
Business leaders, including the Davis family of Winn-Dixie, St. Joe Paper
and Herb Peyton's Gate companies, have put their weight behind parts of
the plan they want state officials to approve.<BR>
<BR>
At issue is a long-term plan to manage growth in Northeast Florida. The
planning council, a panel that coordinates actions among local governments,
drafted guidelines for the region to meet a series of needs, from affordable
housing and transportation to economic development.<BR>
<BR>
The plan has been sent to several state and local agencies for review and
comment. It is still in draft form, with the council expected to finalize
a policy this summer. If the final plan did not address the concerns of
other agencies, the state could challenge the plan officially, claiming
it didn't conform with state law. <BR>
<BR>
Chiles' office wrote in May that it thought the plan fell short of standards
established in state law for coherently identifying natural resources. Staffers
in the state Department of Community Affairs have raised some concerns.
Jacksonville Mayor John Delaney's office sent a letter generally endorsing
the plan. <BR>
<BR>
Environmentalists claim land that was omitted from the plan provides homes
for wildlife including bald eagles, sandhill cranes, black bears, red-cockaded
woodpeckers, gopher tortoises and kestrels. The council's proposal has been
criticized by the Sierra Club, the St. Johns chapter of the Audubon Society,
the St. Johns group TREES and the Taxpayer Protection Committee in Fernandina
Beach.</BLOCKQUOTE>

chief Wetherell</STRONG> </A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- A leading Florida environmental
magazine has called for the resignation of the state's top environmental
official.<BR>
<BR>
According to an editorial in the June issue of Florida Environments magazine,
a 40,000-reader<BR>
statewide environmental news journal, Florida Department of Environmental
Protection secretary Virginia Wetherell was responsible for &quot;too many
decisions ... that betray an agenda not consistent with sound environmental
protection.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Though Wetherell has been consistently criticized during her tenure for
being too cozy with business interests, the editorial focused on a major
shakeup in DEP structure that resulted from the recently concluded state
legislative session.<BR>
<BR>
As part of a last minute package of laws that legislators approved, Wetherell
engineered a restructuring of DEP's Environmental Resources Permit program.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;In the waning hours of the legislative session, DEP's leaders ghosted
an amendment that eliminates the 180-person Tallahassee-based ERP division
by moving rank-and-file permit staff out to DEP's district offices and laying
off top staffers.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This is the same ERP program that DEP fought so hard to protect only
months ago. DEP Secretary Ginger Wetherell last Fall proudly unveiled new
ERP program elements that 'provide applicants with one location to receive
their permit reviews, and increases agency accountability and efficiency
without loss of environmental protection.'&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Though the DEP has claimed the move was necessary to deal with budget restrictions
forced on the agency by the legislature, Florida Environments poked holes
in that official DEP reasoning and laid the blame squarely with Wetherell.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Wetherell made a unilateral decision that's fraught with monumental
ramifications, back doored it through the Legislature, kept her boss out
of the loop, and then spun a story that clouds the issue. ... At worst,
this is emblematic of a disdain for the environment and its protectors,
smacks of an arrogance of power and is a malicious abuse of process. At
best, it was just gross incompetence.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The editorial comes on the heels of a particularly critical article in the
June issue of Florida Trend magazine, the state's leading business publication.
That article focused criticism on Wetherell's ecosystem management initiative
and charges from environmentalists that the secretary's plan was nothing
more than &quot;slick marketing ... for the rollback of environmental laws&quot;
(A quote from Linda Young, publisher of Pro Earth Times).</BLOCKQUOTE>

dies at Clearwater Aquarium</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CLEARWATER -- (EnviroWorld) -- The dolphin named Halona, which
means fortunate one in American Indian, died at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium
on Sunday, the Tampa Tribune reported. <BR>
<BR>
Halona died from a chronic infection , which officials suspect was caused
by a fish spine or stingray barb that punctured her abdomen. The dolphin
did not respond to any antibiotics.<BR>
<BR>
The bottlenose arrived at the aquarium in 1994 for long-term rehabilitation
after receiving severe shark bites and cuts from fishing lines. Halona was
also know as Sunset Sam's companion, the aquarium's other resident dolphin.

this summer</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>MELBOURNE -- (EnviroWorld) -- A site on the Banana River in
Brevard County used as a halfway house to train manatees who can't initially
fend for themselves in the wild, may close down this summer, the Associated
Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
The problem stems from a die-off of sea grass at the site, a chief food
for the manatees, possibly from excessive rain and last winter's cold. Manatees
can eat about 100 pounds of the grass a day. <BR>
<BR>
Compounding the problem, experts are concerned there may not be enough time
to train the sea cows properly before they are set free in the fall. Experts
have spent much of their time worrying about a record 274 manatee deaths
this year, and now they may not be able to beat the fall's cooler weather.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's a setback because we had hoped to get a full season's use out
of this (program),&quot; said Jim Kraus, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife biologist.
&quot;But we're not writing anything off yet.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The program is meant to take pressure off the state's manatee rehabilitative
centers including Sea World in Orlando. Some of the manatees that need help
are born at the centers while others are taken there after being abandoned
by their mothers. Some of the animals must remain in captivity for years
because they wouldn't survive in the wild.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Lowry Park Zoo is booming with
manatees and though its manatee hospital has done wonders in helping sick
and dying sea cows, especially during the southwest Florida dying epidemic,
the zoo is feeling the strain financially, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
It costs about $30,000 a year to feed a manatee, which has totaled about
half of the zoo's $280,000 annual food budget. Because of the costs and
to make room for other sick manatees, the zoo often transfers manatees to
other centers, or if healthy enough, releases them back into the wild.<BR>
<BR>
Last month, the zoo was forced to send two of its manatee residents to Mote
Marine Science Aquarium in Sarasota to make room for other sick manatees.
Today, the zoo plans to release two of the recovered manatees back into
wild at the J.N. &quot;Ding&quot; Darling National Wildlife Refuge on Sanibel
Island.</BLOCKQUOTE>

official plant of Orlando</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ORLANDO -- (EnviroWorld) -- A recently discover plant by an
Apopka grower may become Orlando's official plant, the Orlando Sentinel
reported. The plant, called the Orlando Fern, was presented to the Orlando
City Council in a recent meeting.<BR>
<BR>
Horticulturist Alan Johnson, manager of production at Milestone Agriculture,
discovered the plant, which he said was mixed in with a bunch of other ferns.
It was the only curly stalk with golden tips.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;As with anything unusual at first you think it's a weed or a disease,&quot;
Johnson told the Sentinel. &quot;It was just a natural-occuring phenomenon.
It's caused by sun flares, an overdose of radiation. Things get screwed
up enough that something good comes out of it. This is fairly rare.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Currently, the ferns are being shipped to retailers in California, Texas,
Ohio and Europe. Milestone owner, John Carmi told the Sentinel he hopes
to build on the popularity of Orlando and increase sales of the fern. If
people associate pleasant thoughts with Orlando, then they may want a plant
bearing the name, he said.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Florida growers</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- A House appropriations subcommittee
has approved an amendment that will hold down the price of raw sugar, the
Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
The amendment to the 1997 appropriations bill would cap the price that U.S.
growers get for raw sugar by allowing more imports into the State when the
price rises to 21.15 cents per pound on the New York Market. In the sugar
provisions of the recently enacted federal farm law, the effective minimum
price that growers get for raw sugar is 18 cents a pound.<BR>
<BR>
According to the Sentinel, Dalton Yancy, a lobbyist for the Florida Sugar
Cane League, said the the amendment would end up transferring about $36
million a year from Florida growers to Savannah, Ga. refiners. In addition,
transportation costs to move the sugar up to Georgia would add another 2
cents a pound, that would cap the price for growers at 19.15 cents a pound,
only 2 cents below the price that would trigger imports.<BR>
<BR>
The amendment is sponsored by Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., who said the amendment
would lower consumer prices for the sugar as well as protect refinery jobs.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The current [federal] sugar program is crippling the cane sugar refining
industry and endangering the nations sugar supply to the point that refineries
are closing or temporarily shutting down,&quot; the Sentinel reported he
said.<BR>
<BR>
The federal sugar program does not use taxpayer funds to subsidize growers,
but instead it limits imports and manipulates supplies to ensure a base
price for U.S. growers.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE--(EnviroWorld)-- Duval County officials have decided
not to build a school near the toxic Hipps Road landfill in Westside Jacksonville
due to the potential danger the students would face, according to The Florida
Times-Union. <BR>
<BR>
The Hipps Road landfill was a 1960's dumping site for chemical wastes from
area Navy bases. The federal Superfund lists it as one of the nation's worst
toxic waste sites. Area residents have complained for years that the waste
has contaminated their drinking water and claimed that illnesses have been
caused as a result.<BR>
<BR>
However, Duval County was all set to build an elementary school less than
three-quarter miles from the landfill until city environmental officials
began raising questions as to the safety of the site.<BR>
<BR>
The assistant superintendent for facilities services, McGlade Holloway,
said she saw no evidence that the landfill had contaminated the site or
even posed a threat. As to why they have decided against the site, she said
&quot;It was just one headache that we didn't care to take on.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The new elementary school is needed to ease overcrowding at Chimney Lakes
Elementary School. </BLOCKQUOTE>

Florida rangers protect seagrass</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>MIAMI -- (EnviroWorld) -- The seagrass of Biscayne and Florida
bays is a critical, but fragile part of the marine ecosystem. And as part
of their role in protecting the grass, park rangers are wearing snowshoes,
the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Rangers must often wade in the seagrass covered plains that are part of
U.S. Park Service territory to investigate boating accidents. The snowshoes
prevent them from sinking into the silt and damaging the sensitive crust
of soil which supports seagrass. But, it is the boating accidents which
cause heavy damage to the system.<BR>
<BR>
In fact, a state environmental study estimated that 20 percent of Biscayne
Bay's grasses have been damaged by boat propellers, and rangers are serious
about fining violators.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I tell people it's like chopping down a giant sequoia at Sequoia National
Park or putting a plug in Old Faithful,&quot; Biscayne's Chief Ranger Wayne
Elliott told the Tribune.<BR>
<BR>
The seagrass acts as a filter to remove nutrients and sediment from the
water, thus it plays an important role in keeping the water clear. In addition
the grasses act as protective nurseries for many marine animals, and so
are vital to the ecosystem's food web.<BR>
<BR>
The rangers can assess fines of $150 to $5,000 for running a boat aground,
and current cases involve $30,000 estimates for seagrass damages, the Tribune
reported.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- First the University of Florida
provided free housing, now it's child care. Unfortunately for UF students,
these hand-outs are for bats. Since Wednesday, University workers have rescued
more than 71 baby bats that have fallen out of a specially built bat house
-- essentially a roof on stilts -- that sits across from a campus nature
sanctuary, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
The bat house was originally constructed in 1991 to provide an alternate
home for bats who were becoming a nuisance at the University's baseball
stadium. Though slow to relocate, the bat population at the house is now
estimated at 20,000 and growing.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What's happening is that some of the babies are not able to cling
to either their mothers or the sides of the house, an so they're slipping
away onto the ground,&quot; UF Pest Control Manager Ken Glover told the
Sun. &quot;The same thing happens in the real world.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The babies, products of a ten-day birthing season that started in late May,
are returned to the rafters of the bat house where they are safe from predators.
Two species of the mammal live at the house, the Southeastern bat and the
Brazilian free-tailed bat.</BLOCKQUOTE>

cobras</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ROCKLEDGE--(EnviroWorld)--Russell Crowe has one week to find
new homes for his 30 venomous cobras that have his neighbors living in fear,
the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
Crowe, 27, received 6 months probation after entering a no-contest plea
Tuesday to three charges of housing snakes in an unsafe and unsanitary manner,
even allowing one to escape. Brevard County Judge Phillip Fougerousse ordered
Crowe to clear the snakes out within seven days.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;He has to find persons to take them that have wildlife permits. He
can't just give them to anyone,&quot; said Thomas Quinn, the Florida Game
and Fresh Water Fish Commission lieutenant who wrote the citation against
Crowe. &quot;It would be a financial burden for anyone I know to house 30
cobras&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Crowe's collection was discovered after a monocled albino cobra crossed
his neighbor's path as she watered her garden. After Melbourne police killed
the snake, they discovered Crowe had about 40 more snakes in his home at
3735 N. Harbor City Blvd.<BR>
<BR>
Quinn advised concerned neighbors to kill any snake they see in their neighborhood.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Normally, we'd never advocate killing something, but this is a situation
you don't want to take any chances on,&quot; he said.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)-- Since the net ban amendment became
law in 1995, many fishermen have been seeking alternative marine life to
catch and alternative gear to use, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
The fishermen are seeking new types of gear that will fall into a loophole
of the ban that was approved by 72 percent of voters in 1994. <BR>
<BR>
This concerns the Marine Fisheries Commission, which will conclude a three-day
meeting today at the Radisson Hotel in Gainesville.<BR>
<BR>
Marine scientists are uncertain how new fishing techniques will affect various
species caught or the other marine life that depend on them for food.<BR>
<BR>
The commission is aware that some fishermen are using tarpaulin to guide
fish into smaller mesh netting. Tarp can be torn and discarded in the sea;
this will kill marine life on the bottom by blocking light.<BR>
<BR>
Net ban supporters say tarp shares the intent of the net and it is an oversight
that also needs to be prohibited.<BR>
<BR>
Some fishermen have simply decided to fish for other marine life such as
the cannonball jellyfish which are sold in East Asia as a delicacy.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Oyster harvesters were ordered
off Apalachicola Bay as state regulators found increasing red tide contamination
Wednesday, the Associated Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
A red tide influx has been blamed for the deaths of thousands of fish that
have washed up in recent weeks along the Gulf and for manatee deaths in
southwest Florida.<BR>
<BR>
Water-filtering shellfish such as oysters, clams and coquinas concentrate
the microscopic algae, and levels in the Florida Panhandle bay have become
unsafe for humans, said David Heil, marine resources chief in the Department
of Environmental Protection.<BR>
<BR>
Heil said it takes up to two weeks for oysters to cleanse themselves of
contamination after red tide disappears from an area. Shrimp, crab and fish
don't concentrate the red tide in their meat and are considered safe to
eat if behaving normally when caught.<BR>
<BR>
When eaten by humans, the fish contaminated by red tide can cause several
problems according to Heil including: mild tingling of fingers and toes;
numb mouth and facial muscles; reversal of sensations - hot feels cold,
cold feels hot; and breathing problems.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>MIAMI -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Benlate controversy reached the
courts again and after a four-week legal battle over the chemical's hand
in birth defects, the jury is expected to begin deliberations today, the
Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
In 1993, Donna and Juan Castillo began suit against the chemical's manufacturer,
DuPont, of Wilmington, Del., for contributing to a severe birth defect in
their son, John. John was born with no eyes, a condition called anophthalmia.
<BR>
<BR>
The Castillo's claim that a field-spraying tractor near their home was spraying
Benlate on strawberry crops when Donna was four to six weeks pregnant. She
said she encountered the chemical while taking a walk.<BR>
<BR>
DuPont is disclaiming that Benlate had no connection with the birth defect.
Clement Glynn, DuPont attorney, says that Benlate was not being sprayed
where Donna Castillo took her stroll because it had been a dry time of the
year and was unnecessary to spray the chemical. In addition, he said that
it wouldn't make any sense for the farm to spray close to the street where
it could drift onto passers-by. Glynn also sited that there is no medical
documentation that shows the exposure to Benlate caused the child's birth
defect.<BR>
<BR>
However, eye abnormalities have been linked to Benlate's key ingredient
in some laboratory studies, according to the Tribune. But Dupont says the
product doesn't pose human risks and &quot;the basis for these unsubstantiated
claims is animal experimentation performed to identify doses at which effects
will occur.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In 1991, DuPont voluntarily pulled Benlate from the shelves, after farmers
reported it was causing plants to die. The company paid more than $500 million
in settlements for plant injury cases, but in November 1993, stopped payments
saying that its research could find nothing wrong with the product.<BR>
<BR>
The Tribune reported that Castillo's attorney, Jim Ferraro said the key
element of the case is DuPont's negligence in thoroughly testing Benlate,
a product once widely used throughout Florida to ward off molds that are
common in muggy climates.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)--The non-profit Caribbean Conservation
Corporation (CCC) this week teamed up with the Center for Marine Conservation
and the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund to file an administrative challenge
of newly proposed Florida rules governing the use of coastal armoring. CCC
warns that the rule would violate the Endangered Species Act by allowing
obstruction of the nesting habitat of endangered sea turtles. <BR>
<BR>
Coastal Armoring includes structures such as sea walls, rock revetments
and other rigid structures that are built on the beach or dune system to
protect beachfront homes and other property from erosion. <BR>
<BR>
The proposed rule would also reverse a ban on armoring within the Archie
Carr National Wildlife Refuge on the coast of Brevard and Indian River Counties.
The Carr Refuge is the largest nesting site for green turtles and loggerheads
in North America. Since 1989, over $60 million has been spent by federal,
state, county and private entities to purchase and protect land in this
area.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>BROOKSVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--Florida Crushed Stone began expanding
its cement plant northwest of Brooksville on Wednesday, the St. Petersburg
Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
The $84 million expansion project is expected to be complete by mid-1997
and will double the company's cement production from 600,000 to 1.2 million
tons a year. In addition, 30 new jobs will be added.<BR>
<BR>
The project will add a second 30,000 square foot production line to the
existing plant, on a 100 acre tract near Cobb and Yontz roads. The new line
will consist of a raw mill, kiln, clinker cooler, finish mill and environmental
pollution equipment. <BR>
<BR>
Florida Crushed Stone had to get federal and state approvals to begin the
project. According to the Times, its application for an air-quality permit,
approved in October, was scrutinized by the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection and the National Park Service because of the potential impact
on the Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Reserve at the Citrus-Hernando County
line.<BR>
<BR>
The primary emissions from the plant are nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxides,
which, with the extension, will increase 75 percent. In addition, emission
of particulate matter can increase 25 percent, according to Al Linero, an
administrator in the DEP's bureau of air regulation.<BR>
<BR>
Concern with the plant's emissions has lead to issues dealing with potential
contributions to acid rain and asthmatic problems with nearby residents.<BR>
<BR>
To ease the concerns, the company will use the latest technology, including
an addition bag house filter, to keep emission levels will within state
and federal guidelines, Joe Piermatteo, senior vice president of Brooksville
operations for Florida Crushed Stone, told the Times.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We will meet or exceed all environmental concerns,&quot; Piermatteo
said.</BLOCKQUOTE>

of pesticides may intensify estrogenic effects</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- Scientists are publishing evidence
today that combinations of some pesticides result in intensified effects,
the Associated Press reported. The report, to be published today in &quot;Science,&quot;
centered on the estrogen-producing effects of the pesticides endosulfan,
dieldrin, toxaphene and chlordane.<BR>
<BR>
By themselves, the pesticides have only a very weak effect on the estrogen
gene, said John A. MacLachlan of Tulane University, leader of a team that
tested the chemicals.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;If you test them individually, you could almost conclude that they
were non-estrogenic, almost inconsequential,&quot; he said. &quot;But when
we put them in combinations, their potency jumped up 500 to 1000-fold.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The study adds to the growing body of knowledge surrounding the phenomena
of man-made chemicals that can disrupt the highly-sensitive hormonal system.
In a number of cases of extreme pollution, such chemicals have been documented
to alter the sexual and reproductive abilities of wildlife species.<BR>
<BR>
An Environmental Protection Agency official said the most recent findings,
if verified, could help spur changes in the way chemicals are reviewed for
use.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;These findings are astonishing,&quot; said Lynn Goldman, chief of
the EPA's Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances. &quot;The
policy implications are enormous about how we screen environmental chemicals
for estrogen effects.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

Thursday without reaching a verdict in a lawsuit blaming the maligned pesticide
Benlate with birth defects, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Donna and Juan Castillo are suing DuPont, Benlate's maker, for more than
$15 million. The Castillo's son John was born without eyes, and the couple
believes that Donna was exposed to the chemical while pregnant. Pine Island
Farms is a co-defendant in the case.<BR>

may get Governor's help</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- An attorney for Gov. Lawton Chiles
criticized the way a former researcher at the University of South Florida
has been treated by the courts in a legal fight over an invention, the Associated
Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It looks like a terrible use of the courts,&quot; said Dexter Douglas,
general counsel for the governor. Douglas indicated that clemency was one
option before the governor.<BR>
<BR>
USF and Taborsky have been in civil and criminal courts for seven years
fighting over ownership of a waste-water treatment invention based on the
common cat-litter ingredient, Clinoptolite. Taborsky has argued the invention
came out of his independent work after he left the University, but USF claims
Taborsky stole data accumulated during research paid for by Florida Progress.<BR>
<BR>
A jury convicted Taborsky in 1990 and he was sentenced to probation. Taborsky
later won patents on the research, angering USF officials and resulting
in a prison sentence for probation violation. Part of his imprisonment has
included time on a chain-gang.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't like his being in prison,&quot; said Kevin Carey, an attorney
representing USF. &quot;From the university's standpoint, what they want
is the research.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

parking</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>DAYTONA BEACH -- (EnviroWorld) -- Volusia County Council members
demanded Thursday that the town of Ponce Inlet produce an alternative parking
plan, or abide by a county plan that has drawn heavy fire from the community,
the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
Under the county plan, 205 parking spaces would be put along Atlantic Avenue
in Ponce Inlet, narrowing the road from four to two lanes. The county is
actively trying to reduce beach-driving to conserve sea-turtle habitat in
an effort to have a lawsuit dismissed, and Volusia officials are submitting
their habitat conservation plan to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for
approval.<BR>
<BR>
But Ponce Inlet residents say the loss of two lanes will cause a major traffic
and safety problem.<BR>
<BR>
The council decided to give Ponce Inlet at least two weeks to come up with
alternatives, but agreed to proceed with its plans if the community doesn't
come up with any ideas before the summer-driving rules are scheduled to
take effect.</BLOCKQUOTE>

on water </STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- A growing body of evidence is
showing that a common smog-producing pollutant is also damaging bays and
estuaries, according to an article in the June &quot;Florida Environments.&quot;
Yet, despite a legally binding decision on the issue by Florida's Governor
and Cabinet, a top Department of Environmental Protection official said
that the agency has no intention of regulating the well-studied pollutant
NOx based on its threat to water.<BR>
<BR>
The Governor and Cabinet, acting as the Siting Board, set a legal precedent
last April when it turned down Florida Power and Light's application to
burn the tar-based fuel Orimulsion at its Manatee Plant. That decision was
based partly on the fact that FP&amp;L's plans included an 85 percent increase
in NOx emissions.<BR>
<BR>
But Howard Rhodes, the DEP's Director of Air Resources Management, told
Florida Environments that the decision of the the Siting Board will have
no effect on DEP approvals of air pollution permits.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I think there is validity to the fact that NOx comes out of the air,&quot;
he said, &quot;(But) there is a more tenuous connection between what goes
up comes down and what the impact is. ... It's hard as the devil to trace
sources.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Florida's power plants released more than 260,000 tons of NOx, or nitrogen
oxides, in 1995, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. The
total from all human sources in the state was about 766,000 tons. Once in
the air, a NOx molecule may travel hundreds of miles and go through numerous
chemical reactions before ultimately falling back to earth as nitrate (in
the form of nitric acid). <BR>
<BR>
Nitrate is the most biologically useful form of nitrogen, and along with
phosphorous, is a key ingredient of fertilizers. In coastal waters, algal
growth is kept in check as long as these nutrients are not overly abundant.
<BR>
<BR>
A Tampa Bay National Estuary Program study estimated that NOx accounts for
28 percent of the nitrogen going into Tampa Bay. That estimate fits with
studies of other major eastern waterways, including Chesapeake Bay, that
have found NOx emissions account for 10 to 40 percent of the nitrogen going
into the water.<BR>
<BR>
Nitrate has also been implicated as a factor in the rapid deterioration
of Florida Bay, and is thought to be a major contributor to the seasonal
blooms of algae that lead to red tide outbreaks.<BR>
<BR>
Citing reductions in nitrate levels in Tampa Bay from improved sewage treatment,
Rhodes said, &quot;Clearly, It's a good idea to reduce nitrogen loading.&quot;
But Rhodes said that until scientists could definitively link the NOx coming
out of a smokestack with the nitrate in a body of water, the DEP would sit
tight.<BR>
<BR>
Tom Reese, the attorney who argued against the Orimulsion permit before
the Governor and Cabinet, said the DEP was legally bound to the Siting Board's
decision.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's equivalent to a final order of the Department of Environmental
Protection,&quot; Reese said, &quot;so DEP should begin to be consistent
with (that ruling).&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)-- President Clinton and Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole are trying to beat each other to the punch for credit of
the restoration and preservation of the Everglades, the Gainesville Sun
reports.<BR>
<BR>
Clinton requested $100 million be appropriated to Everglades restoration
projects in 1997. But $200 million has been approved through a 1996 farm
bill inserted by Dole to buy land in the Everglades Agricultural Area; the
state is expected to match the $200 million.<BR>
<BR>
A task force met Thursday to decide how the approved $200 million would
be spent. The task force prioritized a list for appropriations to be given
to U.S. Interior Department Secretary Bruce Babbit, who must decide how
to spend the money by July 1.<BR>
<BR>
Clinton's budget request will be considered by the House in the next week.

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- Vietnamese farmers in Hillsborough
County are fighting against a Department of Environmental Protection order
to stop growing water spinach, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Though the non-native plant can invade and clog waterways, it is also an
important food in the Asian diet. Seven Vietnamese farmers in the bay area
have asked that the DEP allow them to continue growing the plant under strict
regulations instead of imposing an outright ban.<BR>
<BR>
Though the farmers have found some support from local environmental officials,
the DEP has so far refused to compromise. Growing the plant is prohibited
by state and federal regulators, but Roger Stewart, executive director of
the Hillsborough County Environmental Protection Commission, said that local
growers did not allow the plant to escape their fields.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;My staffers who look out for wetlands in this county have never found
it growing wild in the ditches and streams around where it is grown,&quot;
Stewart told the Times.<BR>
<BR>
An estimated 200 supporters came to at a Saturday rally for the plant, called
Rau Mong by the Vietnamese.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CLEARWATER -- (EnviroWorld) -- A study for the Clearwater City
Commission determined that there were no major environmental or regulatory
problems standing in the way of creating a lake in downtown Clearwater,
the St. Petersburg Times reported. That's as long as commissioners are willing
to spend $50 million to do it.<BR>
<BR>
The figure was three times higher than initial project estimates, which
led Commissioner Bob Clark to say, &quot;I like it about three times less,
now.&quot; Other members of the commission also expressed reluctance to
build the lake without commitments from developers.<BR>
<BR>
No one argues that the lake would improve the look and raise property values
in the economically depressed 36-acre area, but the lake's actual value
is still in question. The University of South Florida is completing an economic
impact survey to help answer that question.<BR>
<BR>

compliance problems</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>INDIAN SHORES -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Suncoast Seabird Sanctuary,
which has become known nationwide for its efforts to rescue sick and injured
birds, must correct a couple of sanitation problems as a result of its success,
the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Since the sanctuary opened in 1972 with about a dozen birds, it has grown
to house 500 to 600 birds at a time. In addition, a condominium complex
was built nearby in the 1980's. Residents of the condominiums began to complain
about odors from the sanctuary and dunes of sand, feathers and bird feces,
topped with sea grapes, that blocked their view.<BR>
<BR>
Though the sanctuary's operator, Ralph Heath, won a battle over trimming
the sea grapes, a Department of Environmental Protection inspection spurred
him to agree to a municipal sewer hook-up. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It wouldn't have been acceptable to have someone dumping their own
wastewater from their house onto the beach sand,&quot; Alan Olds, a permitting
engineer with the DEP's industrial waste department told the Times. &quot;Somehow,
Pinellas County had decided (the water from the bird pens) shouldn't be
construed as wastewater, but it definitely is wastewater.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The sewer hookup will cost about $70,000 and county officials are trying
to help the sanctuary cut its water use to lighten the sting of the expense.
Though, the sewer connection should help the odor problem, condominium residents
are still fighting a legal battle to force Heath to do something about the
dunes. </BLOCKQUOTE>

area, hoping to entice the suburbanites to park and ride. They failed, according
to the St. Petersburg Times. <BR>
<BR>
The three facilities have a capacity of 482. Approximately 17 to 20 are
utilized from day to day. The HARTline spends $13,000 a year to maintain
the three lots. <BR>
<BR>
The bus system is planning an aggressive advertising campaign in the hopes

The Florida Department of Environmental Protection chief says she is not

</A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>RUSKIN--(EnviroWorld)--While many urbanites envy farmers' water
usage, the truth is that use is much less than perceived, the Tampa Tribune
reported.<BR>
<BR>
Water use has been close to equal between agriculture and urban life across
the Southwest Florida Water Management District except in Hillsborough,
Pasco and Pinellas counties where the public uses about three times as much
water as farming. While the public used 255 million gallons per day in 1994,
agriculture in the three counties used only 83 million gallons per day.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Agricultural use is highly visible. You can't deny it,&quot; said
Ron Cohen, irrigation expert for the district. &quot;On one side you have
people who want to get rid of agriculture because they're 'using all our
water.'&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Farmers believe they have been using more innovative and resourceful approaches
for farming than ever before. Citrus growers have resorted to micro-irrigation,
using tiny sprayers to water 10 to 12 gallons an hour per tree; the average
lawn sprinkler uses 240 gallons of water per hour. Also, strawberry growers
have installed the drip system which cuts water use in half by dripping
water directly onto the roots. Tomato growers have resorted to a seep system
that lets a small amount of water trickle through shallow furrows where
the water is absorbed by six rows of plants on both sides.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are the only water user that has reduced water use,&quot; said
Chip Hinton, executive director the Florida Strawberry Growers Association.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK-- (EnviroWorld)-- Tourists' view
over the Grand Canyon has been less than picture perfect. The Grand Canyon
Visibility Transport Commission formed to do something about it, according
to The Los Angeles Times.<BR>
<BR>
The commission, which includes California, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New
Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming and the Navajo, Hopi, Hualapai and Acoma Pueblo
tribes will endorse recommendations that would improve visibility 10 percent
daily over the next three decades. The plan would improve 16 national parks
and wilderness areas in the plateau of the Colorado River.<BR>
<BR>
Though most of the foul air comes from the Los Angeles region, the commission
wants everyone to take responsibility in curing the problem. <BR>
<BR>
Some of the recommendations include cutting sulfur emissions from power
plants and industries, low-emision vehicle standards and replacing fossil

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA--(EnviroWorld)-- Environmentalists, scientists, politicians
and the media all have different voices when it comes to meteorological
facts concerning global warming and the ozone, according to the Tampa Tribune.<BR>
<BR>
The 1996 &quot;State of the Climate Report: A World in Perspective&quot;
is a collection of essays that comment on the global climate change. But
some readers believe the report is biased considering it was written by
Western Fuels Association of Arlington, Va. a fuel cooperative composed
of consumer-owned utilities.<BR>
<BR>
The report, a chronology of 1995 events, states that previous models of
global warming were in error, top climatologists found little change in
average temperatures and forecasts of warming for the next century have
been scaled back dramatically.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;In future global warming forecasts you're going to see the numbers
(temperatures) ever so slowly drop,&quot; said Patrick J. Michaels, contributing
editor and a professor of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia.
&quot;That's because the earlier climate models reported too much warming.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--The Florida Game and Fresh Water
Fish Commission has caused questioning of its integrity in the handling
of a cougar caught near the town of Waldo, according to The Gainesville
Sun. The cat was captured last summer and thought by residents to be an
endangered Florida panther. <BR>
<BR>
The animal is a leftover from the relocation program that introduced cougars
into North Florida in the hopes of finding adequate habitat for panthers,
a subspecies of cougar. Once &quot;Waldo&quot; was determined to be a cougar,
not a panther, he was shipped along with other Texas cougars to a wildlife
exhibitor in New Smyrna Beach. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Waldo&quot; was supposed to find a permanent home at a zoo or licensed
exhibitor, but instead made his way to a ranch in Texas that intended to
use him in hunts. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found him there and
returned him to Gainesville. Some of the other cougars may still be at the
ranch. <BR>
<BR>
Last week, the commission found &quot;Waldo&quot; a permanent home at an
exotic wildlife sanctuary in Yulee. <BR>
<BR>
The confusion over the misplacement of the animal has brought the panther
program into question, though. State Rep. Bob Casey, R-Gainesville wants
to hold a public workshop to discuss the facts surrounding &quot;Waldo&quot;
and the other North Florida cougars.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- Odd as it may seem, Chesapeake
Bay may be threatened by receiving too much water, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
Rainy weather produced total freshwater inflow to the Chesapeake Bay of
101 billion gallons per day in May, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
That's 60 percent above the normal inflow of 63 billion gallons per day.
The water flowed into the rivers and streams after falling on farmland and
suburban lawn, as well as streets and parking lots. The result was more
nutrients, such as fertilizers, and sediments entering the bay.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>RIVERVIEW -- (EnviroWorld) -- Mining and manufacturing industries
throughout the Southwest Florida Water Management District consume nearly
236 million of the 1.2 billion gallons of water consumed each day across
16 counties These industries, however, are searching for ways to reduce
their water consumption, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
One company that is changing its use of water is the Cargill Fertilizer
plant located on the bank of the Alafia River. In the past, the company
used a large amount of water only one time before flushing it into the river.
Today, the company is reusing its water and is seeing the benefits of it.
According to Don Clark, senior vice president of operations at the plant,
10 years ago, Cargill took nearly twice as much water from Lithia Springs
as it does today, but produced only half as much fertilizer. Most of the
water used at the plant now stays there and is used over and over, Clark
told the Tribune.<BR>
<BR>
IMC Agrico, a major mining and manufacturing corporation, also has been
trying to lower its water consumption. In fact in January 1990, the company
's operations in Hillsborough and Polk counties consumed 69 million gallons
a day, this January, however it dropped to 15 million gallons. And at the
company's Four Corners and Hopewell mines, consumption dropped to nearly
zero by reusing water.<BR>
<BR>
The changes in the industry began when regulators started looking more closely
at the environment, Michael Molligan, a water district spokesman told the
Tribune. &quot;The big changes were in the mid '70s with water use rules
and permitting. Environmental protection became more strict, and as a result
you saw recycling and cleaning the water before discharge.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

error on key</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>PERDIDO KEY -- (EnviroWorld) -- An error in counting dwelling
units has prompted a construction moratorium on the Florida side of Perdido
Key, near Pensacola. And as far as residents are concerned, that's just
fine, the Associated Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We have a chance to not let the developers go crazy,&quot; said Perdido
Key resident Harry Sarajian. &quot;There's a quality of life we want to
maintain.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Escambia County's comprehensive plan, adopted in 1993, capped development
on Florida's half of the white-sand island at 1,844 units in mixed-use zones.
A count at that time put the existing units at 1,557, but officials now
say it was off by 476. That meant Perdido Key had 2,033 units and was in
violation of the limit before it even went into effect. The county has since
approved 389 more building permits.<BR>
<BR>
Assistant County Administrator Walter Munchheimer blamed the miscount on
a consultant who helped draft the comprehensive plan. The planning board
is to meet Wednesday to consider a proposal to increase the cap to 2,950.
However, it will take at least four to six months to get state approval.<BR>
<BR>
Members of a group called Friends of Perdido Key hope the situation will
help them in their battle to prevent construction of a 17-story condominium
that would be called Palm Beach Resort. It is unlikely the state would approve
raising the cap without stricter zoning and density restrictions, including
height limits that would preclude such a tall building, said David Theriaque,
a lawyer for the group.<BR>
<BR>
George Rethati, general managing partner for Atlanta-based Beach Colony
Properties, said he doubted the counting error would delay the company's
plans to build the condo by the end of the year. </BLOCKQUOTE>

quality and fish contamination</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Environmental Protection
Agency released two reports Tuesday that highlight current water quality
problems. <BR>
<BR>
According to &quot;Environmental Indicators of Water Quality in the United
States,&quot; fish-consumption warnings increased by 14 percent in 1995
and 10 million Americans are presently at risk from exposure to the contaminant
cryptosporidium.<BR>
<BR>
EPA Administrator Carol Browner said, &quot;The major concern regarding
the new fish advisories update is the number of advisories posted due to
contamination from chemicals like mercury, which is responsible for more
fish-consumption advisories than any other contaminant.<BR>
<BR>
Forty seven states now have some form of fish-consumption advisory. EPA
believes that some of the increase in advisories is attributable this year
to improved monitoring by the states.<BR>
<BR>
The new water quality indicators report also found <BR>
<BR>
-- nearly 10 million people remain at increased risk of exposure to microbial
contaminants such as cryptosporidium because their drinking water is not
adequately filtered -- down from 12 million two years ago;<BR>
<BR>
-- over one-third of shellfishing beds are closed or under harvest restrictions;<BR>
<BR>
-- over one-third of the sediment and fish tissue tested are contaminated
with mercury, PCBs and other chemicals;<BR>
<BR>
The number of water bodies under fish advisories rose by 209 in l995 to
a total of 1,740, representing 15 percent of the nation's total lake acres
and four percent of the nation's total river miles. All of the Great Lakes
and large portions of the nation's coastal areas are under advisories.<BR>
<BR>
The populations with the highest potential of increased risk are those who
routinely and exclusively eat freshwater fish from a single location or
region that is known to be impacted by contamination. The typical U.S. consumer
eating fish in moderation from a variety of sources and eating a variety
of fish species is not believed to be at increased risk.<BR>
<BR>
The advisories covered 46 chemical pollutants and multiple fish species.
In addition to mercury contamination, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls, a
now-banned electrical insulator) led to 22 percent of the advisories, followed
by the pesticide chlordane (seven percent); dioxin (three percent); the
banned pesticide DDT (two percent); and approximately 41 other chemicals.<BR>
<BR>
A four-page fact sheet on fish advisories (EPA-823-F-96-006) is available
from EPA. The full &quot;National Listing of Fish and Wildlife Consumption
Advisories&quot; is also available to the public free of charge on five
computer (PC-based, 3.5 inch) diskettes. The information contained in the
database may be used to generate maps for specific geographic locations.
Call or write EPA's National Center for Environmental Publications and Information,
11029 Kenwood Rd., Cincinnati, Ohio 45242, phone 513-489-8190. The document
number is EPA 823-C-96-011. The internet address for ordering is: waterpubs@EPAmail.EPA.gov.

Water Resource Center at 202-260-7786; or by writing to EPA's Office of

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE --(EnviroWorld) -- As the 1998 closing of the county
landfill approaches, Alachua County is taking steps to evaluate its disposal
option. A three-person committee recently ranked several companies based
on their proposals to the county and their financial stability, the Gainesville
Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
Browning-Ferris Industries and Bedminster Bioconversion Corp. won the top
spots on all three lists. One committee member, County Commissioner Kate
Barnes, gave Bedminister the highest ranking. That company proposes a composting
facility that would combine solid waste with sewage sludge to create a marketable
compost, but the plan would also require a restructuring of the current
curbside recycling program. BFI won the top spot on the other two members'
lists. BFI's financial stability was one of it's major assets -- an important
concern to the county, which will award a ten-year contract for disposal.<BR>
<BR>
Another financially strong company, Waste Management, did not fare as well
in the rankings because of the unpopularity of its &quot;RailCycle&quot;
proposal to ship garbage to a panhandle site by train.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Atsena Otie key</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CEDAR KEY -- (EnviroWorld) -- Cedar Key leaders have asked the
Seminole Indian tribe to help the state acquire nearby Atsena Otie key from
developers, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
Archeologists have found Native American pottery shards more than 5,000
years old on the group of islands that make up the key, and legends say
that it was a burial ground during the &quot;Trail of Tears&quot; forced
march from 1842 to 1845. The Sun did not receive comment on the issue from
the Seminoles.<BR>
<BR>
Depot Key Joint Venture currently owns the land and has plans to build 57
homes on 65 acres of uplands. The group's asking price of $3.4 million was
far more than the state Bureau of Land Acquisition's $1,925,000 offer, made
last November.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to seeking the Seminoles' help, Cedar Key and the Archaeological
and Historical Conservancy are sending letters to the state promoting talks
with the private group, Trust for Public Lands. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- Alachua County residents convinced
their commissioners to ban new billboards in the county for six months on
Tuesday, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
The Commission agreed, by a 4-1 vote, that the moratorium was necessary
while the county decides what new standards it will enact regarding the
signs. Residents recently became alarmed over the sudden appearance of several
new billboards along a heavily developed stretch of road.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- The Tampa City Council may annex nearly
1,000 acres of mostly undeveloped land from Hillsborough County. An editorial
in the Tampa Tribune warns against changing the existing development standards
on the land, should the annexation happen.<BR>
<BR>
Under current rules, 50 percent of the land must be protected wildlife habitat,
but other areas may be developed at a density of up to 3 homes per acre.
An east to west greenway is also mandated for the area. The editorial states
that &quot;development pressure is great. Landowners are seeking to have
the land -- East Meadows -- annexed by the city and rezoned for a 1,599-unit
subdivision.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;If rapidly developing Hillsborough County is to have any wildlife
left for future generations, leaders must preserve what little remains.
Mayor Dick Greco ... is doing a fine job, but environmental concerns do
not seem high on his list of priorities.<BR>
<BR>
Here, we expect city council members to take the lead. They must make sure
the annexation does not come at the expense of irreplaceable natural resources.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WINDERMERE--(EnviroWorld)-- After 15 years of studies, Orange
County commissioners voted Tuesday to construct two new boat ramps to the
Butler Chain of Lakes over the next four years, the Orlando Sentinel reported.
There is currently only one access ramp. <BR>
<BR>
Environmentalists, lakefront homeowners and city officials disagree with
the chosen sites and wanted the decision delayed again to allow for more
suitable sites to be found. Many are threatening lawsuits. The controversy
lies in the building of a ramp on small Lake Isleworth. Protesters believe
it would be more environmentally sound to build the ramps on the larger
lakes. </BLOCKQUOTE>

found a new place to nest in the face of dwindling habitat, according to
the Orlando Sentinel. The birds' beach homes have been taken over by human
beachgoers, but the birds found an acceptable alternative-- rooftops.<BR>
<BR>
The light-colored gravel on roofs is a similar habitat to the crushed shells
on beaches. The birds are camouflaged and they stay safe from predators.

Agency to spruce up the eyesore.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA--(EnviroWorld)-- California strawberries are being tested
for an illness causing parasite, the Tampa Tribune reported. More than four
dozen cases in Texas and Florida have been reported over recent months.
<BR>
<BR>
Florida strawberries have been tested and were found to be free of the parasite,
cyclospora, which can cause weeks of diarrhea, fatigue and cramps. The parasite
is found in fecal material.<BR>
<BR>
The California Strawberry Commission is welcoming testing by the Centers
for Disease Control and other public health agencies because they do not
believe the strawberries are responsible.<BR>

County officials in Palm Beach are advising that consumers wash or cook
produce before consuming it.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>NEW YORK--(EnviroWorld)--The number of ticks is unusually high
this year, according to the Gainesville Sun. Ticks carry disease that they
pick up from biting mice and deer. <BR>
<BR>
Lyme disease is commonly carried by ticks, although mostly seen in the Northeast
part of the country. Last year there was only one reported case of Lyme
disease in Florida; so far this year there have been three. Symptoms of
Lyme disease include a bull's-eye rash around the bite, flu-like symptoms,
arthritis, migraine headaches, vision loss and fatigue. <BR>
<BR>
Recent research has shown that the insects also carry two other infections-
babesiosis and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis - which can combine with
Lyme bacteria to cause more serious illness. These two micro-organisms may
explain why some people have trouble getting over an infection or don't
respond to antibiotics used to treat Lyme disease.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CRYSTAL RIVER -- (EnviroWorld) -- Federal regulators began questioning
Florida Power Corp. officials this week for specifics on how they plan to
ensure certain safety procedures are met at the company's nuclear plant
in Crystal River, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm interested in how you know things are better. I want some verification,&quot;
said Stewart Ebneter, regional Nuclear Regulatory Commission administrator
from Atlanta. &quot;Not just because you have waved some wand over and said
it was better.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Pat Beard, head of nuclear operations for the St. Petersburg-based company,
assured regulators Tuesday that Florida Power management sees no &quot;significant
safety problem&quot; at Crystal River.<BR>
<BR>
During the Tuesday meeting, NRC officials criticized top plant managers
about their response to repeated regulatory complaints of inadequate management
oversight and poor engineering work. Federal regulators are still investigating
a control-room test in September 1994 that pushed one of the plant's main
safety systems outside acceptable limits.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>LOOE KEY -- (EnviroWorld) -- Scientists are worried about the
survival of coral reefs off the Florida Keys after noticing an increase
in pollution fueled algae at a popular diving spot, the Fort Lauderdale
Sun-Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
In the past four months, the green algae known as cladophora has blanketed
the corals and sea fans in portions of the Looe Key reef. What concerns
scientists, is that the Keys' treasured coral reefs could start dying in
masses from the pollution. <BR>
<BR>
Cladophora thrives in waters where high levels of nitrogen - a substance
found in sewage and other waste products - are present, Bill Matzie, a researcher
at the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution told the Sun-Sentinel. <BR>
<BR>
Some scientists suggest that mishandling of sewage in the Keys is probably
partly to blame for the increase in nitrogen levels. Others say that the
increase in nitrogen is coming from sugar cane farms 120 miles north in
Palm Beach County - an effect of Everglades restoration projects.<BR>
<BR>
According to the Sun-Sentinel, other scientists disregard the connection
of nitrogen in the Keys water as an effect of the Everglades. <BR>
<BR>
Water flowing off the sugar fields is extremely high in nitrogen, Ron Jones
of Florida International University told the Sun-Sentinel, but the Everglades
in Broward and Palm Beach counties acts as a filter, cleansing the water
of the chemicals. Once the water reaches the mangroves of the southern Everglades,
it picks up more nitrogen from decomposing leaves and other plant material.</BLOCKQUOTE>

imprisoned scientist</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CRYSTAL RIVER -- (EnviroWorld) -- The state's top prison official
is looking for a way to free a researcher who was imprisoned because of
a patent dispute with the University of South Florida, according to the
Associated Press.<BR>
<BR>
A state judge sent Petr Taborsky, convicted of stealing two notebooks, to
a maximum-security prison in January after he refused to sign over patents
on a water purification invention to the Tampa university where he had worked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't know what he's doing in prison,&quot; Corrections Secretary
Harry Singletary said Tuesday. &quot;I don't see him as anybody threatening
the public safety.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Singletary said he hopes to transfer Taborsky, who has no prior criminal
record, to a minimum-security work-release center until a clemency hearing
can be held.<BR>
<BR>
In the meantime, Gov. Lawton Chiles' general counsel, Dexter Douglass, has
asked Attorney General Bob Butterworth and the Board of Regents to look
into South Florida's handling of what he termed a &quot;bizarre case.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The university spent more than $320,000 on a private law firm to push for
criminal penalties. Regents Chairman James Heekin of Orlando defended the
university. &quot;It doesn't sound any different to me than a guy who steals
books out of the library,&quot; he said.<BR>
<BR>
Campus police charged Taborsky with theft for taking his notebooks when
he left school and his research job in 1988. A jury convicted Taborsky of
theft in 1990. Circuit Judge Richard Lazzara sentenced him to a year of
house arrest, 15 years on probation and ordered him to make no further use
of the data.<BR>
<BR>
When Taborsky got the first of three patents in 1992, Lazzara ordered him
to sign it over to the university. When he refused, the judge sentenced
him to 3 1/2 years in prison.</BLOCKQUOTE>

find a temporary settlement</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>DAYTONA BEACH -- (EnviroWorld) -- After weeks of wrangling over
beach parking plans, officials from Ponce Inlet and Volusia County may have
reached some common ground, the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
At a Ponce Inlet Town Council meeting Monday, a counterproposal to the county's
plan for creating more than 200 metered parking spaces along a section of
Atlantic Avenue was offered by Ponce Inlet Town Manager Robert Burns.<BR>
<BR>
According to the Sentinel, Burns' plan includes shifting more than 100 parking
spaces from Atlantic to several streets in the nearby unincorporated community
of Wilbur-by-the-Sea. In addition, the plan would take advantage of a condominium
developer's offer to allow temporary parking at a vacant, 1.5-acre seaside
lot in Ponce Inlet.<BR>
<BR>
County officials must work quickly to put parking alternatives in place
because a set of strict beach driving rules will be placed this summer.
The new rules include banning beach driving in Wilbur-by-the-Sea and most
of Ponce Inlet and will go into effect if the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service
approves them as part of a habitat conservation plan that is under review.</BLOCKQUOTE>

lakes rejected</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ODESSA -- (EnviroWorld) -- A plan to add more water to northwest
Hillsborough lakes was rejected earlier this week by local water officials,
the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
David Bracciano, a resource analyst at the West Coast Regional Water Supply
Authority, asked the Northwest Hillsborough Basin Board to help fund his
plan with $579,000. But the board voted unanimously Wednesday not to give
money to the West Coast plan.<BR>
<BR>
The lake enhancement plan includes building underground pumps and channels
among 10 lakes in Odessa. The channels would divert water from thriving
lakes, to drier lakes. To get money to pay for the plan, West Coast had
hoped funding would come from basin boards. A basin board in Pinellas County
was also asked for funding, but refused.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There are just too many unanswered questions right now to fund it,&quot;
Bruce Wirth, director of resource project for the Southwest Florida Water
Management District, told the Times. Swiftmud, a parent organization of
the Northwest Hillsborough Basin Board, has recommended against the project.

<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG -- (EnviroWorld) -- The former University of
South Florida researcher who went to jail rather than relinquish a patent
is getting special attention from Governor Lawton Chiles, the St. Petersburg
Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Dexter Douglass, the governor's general counsel, said that he is bringing
up Peter Taborsky's case at the next meeting of the clemency board in September
and indicated that he may even present the issue before individual members
of the board before that date.<BR>
<BR>
Taborsky and USF have been fighting over rights to a wastewater treatment
method that the scientist won a patent for in 1991. At the time he was already
on probation for stealing lab notebooks from the school, which he claimed
contained private research data. The patent spurred USF to urge further
punishment for the researcher and Taborsky received a 3 1/2 year sentence
for violation of probation.<BR>
<BR>
But recent media attention has painted USF as overzealous in its pursuit
of Taborsky's punishment, and the publicity has earned the Gov. Chile's
attention.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;People do not go to the state prison - with no prior record - on a
first-time, non-violent offense,'' Douglass told the Times. &quot;They just
don't wind up on the chain gang in close confinement.''</BLOCKQUOTE>

new attitude</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG -- (EnviroWorld) -- Florida Power Corp. has never
been run by a lawyer, until now. But the ascension of Joe Richardson last
April to president and chief operating officer of the utility represents
the changing face of the business, and especially the intensifying competition
for industrial and big business customers, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
With corporations such as IMC-Agrico actively lobbying for deregulation
of Florida's power utilities, utility analyst Nancy Messer of A.G. Edwards
in St. Louis said that running a utility now requires much more than just
keeping a plant running.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;(Richardson) is probably better prepared than the old-style engineering
execs to deal with the different constituencies that utilities must balance
these days,&quot; Messer told the Times.<BR>
<BR>
The Times described the 47-year-old Richardson as mild mannered, pale and
lean. He was promoted from senior vice president of energy distribution
to replace retiring Allan Keesler, who had a reputation for a hard edge.
Richardson is also expected to become Chief Executive Officer of the utility
next year, a position currently held by Richard Korpan -- the no. 2 executive
at Florida Power Corp.'s parent Florida Progress.<BR>
<BR>
During the past three years, Florida Power's staff has been cut nearly 20
percent to 4,600 people. The utility has more than 1.2-million customers
in its 20,000-plus square miles of territory.</BLOCKQUOTE>

At Lizard Station lives the Grand Cayman Island rock iguana, the crocodile

However the area is closed to the public because the purpose of the project

and Cabinet approved on Thursday a fishing pier proposed for Juno Beach,
which has an estimated 1,100 turtle nesting sites per mile during peak nesting
season, the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>

A previous pier in the area was torn down in 1984.<BR>
<BR>
The new pier will be closed at night to reduce problems that turtles have

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)-- As the Legislature explores commercial
aquaculture of the Gulf Sturgeon, some environmentalists and a federal biologist
say it's a poor way to preserve the threatened fish, the Gainesville Sun
reported.<BR>
<BR>
Europe and Russia raise sturgeon for caviar. In the Western United States,
the white meat is raised and sold for up to $15 a pound in New York. However
Judy Hancock, of the Sierra Club's Florida Chapter said governement agencies
should be focusing on habitat preservation instead of commercialization.<BR>
<BR>
And Lorna Patrick, a biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
fears that introducing a commercial fish stock in with natives may decrease
genetic fitness and make the animals more susceptible to disease.<BR>
<BR>
The Gulf Sturgeon is a supspecies of the Atlantic Sturgeon, which has been
around for 200 million years. Patrick said that the fish may have evolved
genetic traits that allow it to survive in specific habitats, such as the
Suwannee River. Diluting the fish's gene pool with animals that are specially
bred for meat and eggs could weaken it, sh argues.<BR>
<BR>
Other researchers expressed skepticism of the danger, however.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)-- The South Florida Water Management
District has begun level one pulse releases from Lake Okeechobee to preserve
the coastal estuaries and littoral zone. <BR>
<BR>
Salinity conditions in the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie estuaries indicate
that fresh water discharges would not be harmful at this time. The level
one pulse release program, which mimics natural rainfall, discharged water
to Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie rivers where salt and freshwater mix. The
process peaks on day two or three then tapers off.<BR>
<BR>
Last year, due to 18 months of record rainfall, the District was forced
to make continuous lake releases from Aug. to Nov. 1995. A continuous freshwater

<BLOCKQUOTE>PORTLAND, Ore. -- (EnviroWorld) -- A lab owner who billed customers
for soil and water tests that were never performed pleaded guilty to submitting
false statements to the government June 3, according to an Environmental
Protection Agency press release. <BR>
<BR>
As part of a plea bargain, Robert Cyphers, former president and owner of
UST Environmental Services, pleaded guilty to four felony counts and will
serve a 30-month prison sentence. Cyphers operated a company whose primary
business was the removal of leaking underground storage tanks and the subsequent
cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater. Cyphers submitted over a thousand
fictitious laboratory analysis reports regarding the extent of soil and
groundwater<BR>
contamination to the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality.<BR>
<BR>
Cyphers began operating in Oregon in 1990 and performed work throughout
Oregon on over 100 sites. Of the few sites that have been re-sampled, analysis
has determined that petroleum contamination still exists. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>BECKLEY, W. Va. -- (EnviroWorld) --James D. Brackenrich, a professional
engineer and former<BR>
West Virginia state Senator, was sentenced June 10 for negligently filling
wetlands without a Clean Water Act permit, according to an Environmental
Protection Agency press release. <BR>
<BR>
He was sentenced to one-month imprisonment, five months of home confinement,
a $25,000 fine and one year of probation. Brackenrich must also submit for
EPA's approval a wetlands restoration plan that must be completed within
18 months.<BR>
<BR>
During his tenure in the West Virginia Senate, Brackenrich chaired the committee
which oversees environmental and natural resource legislation. <BR>
<BR>
Brackenrich, now employed by the West Virginia Department of Transportation,
admitted that in December 1992 he used bulldozers to dump dredged and landfill
material in wetlands without a<BR>
required permit from the Army Corps of Engineers. The wetlands are part
of the Meadow River<BR>
complex in southern West Virginia, the state's second largest wetlands area.
<BR>
<BR>
While the actual charge concerns work done in 1992, Brackenrich has stipulated
as part of his plea agreement that he and his now-deceased father also discharged
dredged and landfill material into<BR>
wetlands in 1988 without obtaining a permit. <BR>
<BR>
The case was investigated by EPA's Criminal Investigation Division and the
FBI in Charleston, W.Va., with technical support from the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- Billing it as the first-ever
extradition of an individual charged with environmental crimes in the United
States, the Environmental Protection Agency reported that Bruce R. Burrell
was returned to the U.S. from Costa Rica June 12.<BR>
<BR>
Burrell was arrested in Costa Rica in December 1995 based on an outstanding
arrest warrant<BR>
for violations of a number of U.S. statutes including the Clean Air Act,
smuggling, obstruction of justice, conspiracy, money laundering and tax
evasion. He had been indicted on 70 counts of violating federal laws in
September 1995 including the illegal importation of<BR>
freon (specifically CFC-12).<BR>
<BR>
Burrell and co-defendant Kersi Raja were charged with conspiracy to import
over 19,000 thirty pound cylinders of CFC-12 into the United States for
purposes of domestic commerce without the required permits and without paying
necessary import taxes. In addition, they also allegedly attempted to obstruct
the investigation of their activities by asking witnesses to give false
statements to investigators. <BR>
<BR>
If convicted on all counts, Burrell and his co-defendant face up to a maximum
of 700 years incarceration and over $28 million in fines. Officials from
the EPA, US.Marshals Service, U.S. Customs, the Internal Revenue Service,
INTERPOL and Costa Rican authorities all participated in the investigation
and extradition.</BLOCKQUOTE>

on water issues </STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ST. PETERSBURG -- (EnviroWorld) -- A Republican challenger to
state Rep. Helen Spivey's (D-Crystal River) seat is taking the incumbent
to task for her environmental positions and could divide the environmentalist
vote in the district, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Nancy Argenziano criticized Spivey, known as the &quot;Manatee Lady,&quot;
for her positions on several pieces of legislation that came before lawmakers
during the last session. Argenziano argues that Spivey has been too willing
to compromise with water-hungry Pinellas and Hillsborough Counties. But
Spivey counters that Argenziano is unfamiliar with the legislative process,
and how things get done in Tallahassee.<BR>
<BR>
Argenziano specifically criticized Spivey's sponsorship of House Bill 2713,
which was a train of proposals engineered during the waning days of the
session. Spivey's provision would have incorporated water resources into
local growth management, but Argenziano accused Spivey of not reading the
entire bill and said that other parts of the bill would have undermined
Citrus County's ability to protect its water.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I think she was duped,&quot; Argenziano told the Times, &quot;I wouldn't
have attached my name to that bill in any way.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
H.B. 2710 died in committee.<BR>
<BR>
Argenziano, who favors pushing other counties to exhausting their own water
supplies before using outside sources, and promotes desalination as an option,
may pull votes from hard-line water conservationists in Citrus, Marion and
Hernando counties. Both candidates are lining up political supporters for
the District 43 race. Republican Skip Steighner will also be competing for
the seat. </BLOCKQUOTE>

water to dried up wetlands</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>LAKE LOYCE--(EnviroWorld)-- Hillsborough and Pasco counties
are augmenting some lakes and wetlands through mechanical refill, the Tribune
reported.<BR>
<BR>
The program, arranged by the West Coast Regional Water Supply Authority
with other private and public refill projects, has a simple theory. When
a lake or wetland dries out because of drought, drainage or pumping from
nearby regional water wellfields, refill it with groundwater from the Floridan
aquifier. It operates on an as-needed basis.<BR>
<BR>
Eight additional sites in Pasco have restoration plans this year, using
at least 1 million gallons a day. Last year, authority engineers pumped
up to 2 million gallons a day into 17 lakes and wetlands at a cost of $375,000.<BR>
<BR>
Some critics argue that falling aquifer levels are the cause the lakes'
decline and that refilling is only cosmetic. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's like replacing the tiles on a leaky roof but not repairing the
rotten wood underneath,&quot; said Michael Molligan, a district spokesman
for the Southwest Florida Water Management District.</BLOCKQUOTE>

'green materials'</STRONG> </A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE-- (EnviroWorld)-- The 1996 University of Florida
&quot;Green&quot; Building Materials Conference will urge recyclable construction
for industrial use, the Gainesville Sun reported.<BR>
<BR>
The conference, scheduled June 24 and 25, will include discussions on issues
such as making carpet from recycled soda bottles, insulation from telephone
books and panel from compressed straw. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We want green materials to be a general part of the industry,&quot;
said UF architecture grad student Brag Guy, who will be leading a discussion
on measuring the amount of recycled products companies use in construction.
&quot;It's an economically powerful part of the market. Almost nobody would
say they are not for the environment.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Conference coordinator Gisela Bosch said she hopes the event brings architects,
large-scale and residential builders, manufacturers and students to expose
them to an environmentally aware side of the market. She said the conference
is the first of its kind.<BR>
<BR>
The conference is designed to be an information forum with over 50 businesses
contributing four-page reports on their ideas and concerns, said Bosch.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's not all the environmental side,&quot; Guy said. &quot;It's pure
business. It's definitely cheaper to recycle your waste.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>BROOKSVILLE--(EnviroWorld)-- Though some of his water wars foes
were ecstatic about the resignation of Pinellas Commissioner Charles Rainey,
others predict little change, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Pinellas County will still need water, Hillsborough Commissioner Ed Turanchik
said.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't know that Pinellas County's position changes with Commissioner
Rainey's departure,&quot; said Turanchik, who is also chairman of the West
Coast Regional Water Supply Authority, which Rainey helped form.<BR>
<BR>
Also skeptical that change would take place were the Coalition of Lake Associations.
Though pleased with Rainey's resignation, coalition member Gilliam Clarke
said he does not believe pumping will end when Rainey is leaves in November.<BR>
<BR>
Rainey has represented Pinellas on the West Coast board since 1973. The
focus of his 33-year political career has been on water issues in the region.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
Air quality measuring stations recorded unusually high levels of ozone June
6 throughout Hillsborough and Pinellas counties, the second violation of
federal standards within two years. Just one more violation may endanger
the Environmental Protection Agency's February ruling that gave a passing
grade to air quality standards in the bay area. <BR>

challenged water district with ads</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CLEARWATER -- (EnviroWorld) -- The water battles in the Tampa
Bay area reached new levels this past weekend, when Pinellas County launched
an advertising campaign that attacked the policy of state regulators, the
Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Pinellas officials plan to carry out their $300,000 advertising campaign
through this weekend. Ads are being placed in the St. Petersburg Times and
the Tampa Tribune, which challenge the Southwest Florida Water Management
District's contention that the county is the culprit in the dry-up of area
lakes and wetlands.<BR>
<BR>
The advertisements claim that the Swiftmud is planning to cut pumping from
the Floridian Aquifer and introduce new sources of drinking water that could
pose a public health risk. The first ad, published in Sunday's newspapers,
featured a series of pictures from Crews Lake in Pasco County over the last
43 years. The photos show the lake fluctuating in drainage and refilling
through the years, proving that this occurred before wellfields began pumping
water, Pick Talley, the county's utility director told the Tribune.<BR>
<BR>
District officials say that those photos show just one lake among dozens
that has dried out near wellfields and that historical trends prove a correlation
between pumping and environmental damage. Officials, however, don't plan
to &quot;waste taxpayers' money&quot; by retaliating against Pinellas' advertisement.<BR>
<BR>
District scientists have said that pumping at wellfields owned by Pinellas
County has sucked thousand of acres of lakes and wetlands dry in Pasco and
Hillsborough counties. The County, however, contends that drought, drainage
and development are the real causes of the lakes and wetlands drying up.</BLOCKQUOTE>

at wellfield</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CLEARWATER -- (EnviroWorld) -- Water being pumped from the Cypress
Bridge wellfield could double in the next four to six years if a new permit
is approved, the Tampa Tribune reported. The West Coast Regional Water Supply
Authority's board voted on Monday to seek permission to eventually pump
16 million gallons a day from the wellfield. <BR>
<BR>
The current permit allows the pumping of 8 million gallons a day, but expires
on June 27. The new permit, which must be approved by the Southwest Florida
Water Management District, asks to pump 12 million a day for the first few
years. If no impact on the environment is found, that number would gradually
increase to 16 million a day.<BR>
<BR>
The decision to increase pumping came over objections of representatives
from Hillsborough and Pasco counties who wanted to see reports on what impact
the increased pumping was expected to have, according to the Tribune.<BR>
<BR>
West Coast hydrologists said that the increase in pumping would not affect
the wellfield, which borders on Pasco and Hillsborough counties. But, some
officials are not satisfied with that, such as Hillsborough Commissioner
Ed Turanchik or Pasco County Administrator John Gallagher.<BR>
<BR>
After Monday's meeting, Turanchik said that West Coast is asking Pasco and
Hillsborough residents to believe that higher pumping limits would not cause
any environmental harm without showing proof.<BR>
<BR>
However, &quot;the phrase 'trust me' won't go very far in Hillsborough and
Pasco counties,&quot; Turanchik told the Tribune.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- After the busiest months of the year,
the Florida Aquarium is still facing financial problems, the Tampa Tribune
reported.<BR>
<BR>
In February, March and April, the aquarium posted its second-best performance
with $1.34 million dollars, yet the annual loss rose to $4.36 million.<BR>
<BR>
Aquarium officials originally expected to draw 1.8 million visitors the
first year and make the debt payments with money left over. Instead, attendance
was fewer than 1 million and officials had to scrounge $2 million out of
reserves to make a May 1 payment.<BR>
<BR>
One of the deciding factors determining the success or failure of the aquarium
could be area development, according to the Tribune. If Tampa is able to
finance developments, such as a convention center hotel and retail center,
then the aquarium may have a better chance.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We're in front of the neighborhood here,&quot; John Racanelli, president
and chief executive officer of the Florida Aquarium, told the Tribune. &quot;Until
some of that development comes in, it makes our hill that much steeper to
climb.&quot; </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- Despite a $36 million expansion at
the Museum of Science and Industry last year, attendance and income are
running below forecast, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
MOSI is owned by the county and run by the nonprofit foundation. Hillsborough
County provided $15 million in tax money to help pay for the expansion.
<BR>
<BR>
But, at the end of May, eight months into the museum's fiscal year, MOSI
reported an operating deficit of $876,862 - $500,000 more than expected.
The museum's president Wit Ostrenko, however, expects that the new 350-seat
MOSImax dome movie theater will help the deficit while kids are out of school
this summer.<BR>
<BR>
If things don't go according to Ostrenko's plan, then Assistant County Administrator
Edwin Hunzeker said MOSI may have to cut expenses.<BR>
<BR>
Ostrenko told the Tribune that five museum employees were laid off last
week, including four managers. &quot;We'll run lean and mean,&quot; he said.
The museum is left with about 130 paid employees.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>HUTCHINSON ISLAND -- (EnviroWorld) -- St. Lucie's Unit 2 nuclear
reactor was generating power again after a weeklong shutdown for minor repairs,
Florida Power &amp; Light said last week, according to the Palm Beach Post.<BR>
<BR>
The unit came back up late Thursday, one day after Nuclear Regulatory Commission
members visited the site to discuss plans to improve performance at St.
Lucie. At the time of the visit, both Unit 2 and Unit 1 were down.<BR>
<BR>
The Unit 1 reactor will be down until mid-July while tubes in its steam
generator are plugged in compliance with new federal guidelines on pipe
conditions. Its scheduled refueling outage was expected to end in June.<BR>
<BR>
When Unit 2 was shut off on June 6, FP&amp;L officials believed bearings
in the generator's rotating shaft had been damaged during an unplanned shutdown
of the reactor because of a malfunctioning valve on a feed-water pump. A
more thorough inspection showed that the bearings were undamaged and the
Unit could be returned to service.<BR>

Everglades</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- Florida Power &amp; Light is making
big plans restore nearly 13,455 acres of wetland that links the Everglades
with Biscayne National Park, the Miami Herald reported.<BR>
<BR>
FP&amp;L is planning to rip out invasive trees, plug old drainage ditches
and pump more fresh water into the marshes and mangrove swamps. When the
project is complete, the company will hand the land over to the state with
enough money to maintain it forever.<BR>
<BR>
But what does FP&amp;L get out of this deal?<BR>
<BR>
Well, the utility expects to pocket a nice profit for its work. FP&amp;L
is planning to sell 3,650 &quot;credits&quot; for its restoration project
in South Dade to developers, utilities, road builders and others who are
required by state and federal regulations to make amends for destroying
wetlands elsewhere, according to the Herald. FP&amp;L expects to have state
and federal permits by September to begin the project.<BR>
<BR>
This project, however, is opposed by Broward and Palm Beach counties, the
Environmental Coalition of Broward, The Redland Conservancy and a competing
wetland restoration company in Pembroke Pines. These groups say that this
project would pull business from developers elsewhere into South Dade, resulting
in a net loss of wetlands at the edge of the Everglades in Broward and Palm
Beach counties. A hearing will be scheduled later this summer with the state
to hear these issues.<BR>
<BR>
This project is called wetland mitigation banking, which was spurred two
years ago by legislation. Supporters of mitigation banking say that the
result is bigger, healthier marshes and swamps that provide a better habitat
for wildlife than smaller wetlands and marshes.<BR>
<BR>
Four mitigation projects have opened up in the past two years. And six other
proposed wetland banks around the state are awaiting permits or are in the
planning stages, according to the DEP. If FP&amp;L's restoration project
is approved, it would be the largest in the state.<BR>
<BR>
If FP&amp;L gets its permits, the utility would begin restoration by putting
part of the property - 4,125 acres between U.S. 1 and Card Sound Road -
into public conservation easement, Robert Kessler, the project's manager,
told the Herald. Then the company would begin removing exotic vegetation.
This could begin in the fall.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE--(EnviroWorld)-- Businesses in Gainesville will
be required to recycle by January, but residents may suffer a cost hike,
the Gainesville Sun reported. Presently only 11 percent of commercial waste
is recycled; residential customers recycle 40 percent of their waste. <BR>
<BR>
A successful commercial recycling program may raise the cost for the residential
customers who currently pay $13.50 a month. Additionally, the city is debating
whether or not the hauling companies should be able to choose where they
dump the waste they collect. Allowing a free market for the haulers could
increase costs further.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE--(EnviroWorld)-- The waters off the coast of Jacksonville
may be the site of undersea explosions next year, according to the Florida
Times-Union. The Navy is in the process of choosing a site to test its newest
submarine under combat conditions.<BR>
<BR>
The explosions are expected to kill fish, sea mammals, turtles and even
birds in the area. The Navy has conducted a thorough study according to
an environmental impact statement they just released. The study looked at
the impact at the Mayport Naval Station site and at an area off Norfolk,
Va. The study showed the impact to be similar at each sight with the exception
that eight times more marine mammals were expected to be killed in the Norfolk
area. At the Mayport site it is expected that one marine mammal and six
sea turtles may be killed during the series of explosions from May 1 to
Sept. 30, 1997. <BR>
<BR>
A public hearing will be held this summer in Jacksonville and a final decision
is not expected until December.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE--(EnviroWorld)--Land that was thought to be sold
to the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve in North Jacksonville will
now house an upscale subdivision, the Florida Times-Union reported. The
city approved the rezoning of the environmentally valuable marshland to
become a gated subdivision. <BR>
<BR>
The new project on the edge of Pumpkin Hill Creek will require the introduction
of wells and septic tanks on the edge of a state aquatic preserve. Pumpkin
Hill Creek was the last section of Duval County where shellfishing was allowed;
the state suspended harvest a few months ago due to pollution from septic
tanks. <BR>
<BR>
Jacksonville permits growth where they previously ruled against it. Rural
areas that were marked off-limits to developers are rezoned. On roads that
are already rush hour nightmares, more construction is being permitted.
Loopholes in the laws allow developers to build on land that is already
overdeveloped. Even after the city's professional planners reject land use
changes, the city council approves them anyway to make new projects possible,
according to the Times-Union. <BR>
<BR>
Protections written into the city's growth management law are violated because
of loopholes or lack of details. The Cedar Swamp never received the protection
it was promised because a follow-up law was never passed. The council has
now approved the construction of 140 homes near the swamp.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)-- When Tallahassee city commissioners
decided to build a new power plant without the input of citizens, Leon County's
Republican Executive Committee called for an independent review, the Tallahassee
Democrat reported.<BR>
<BR>
City commissioners unanimously voted May 8 to build a 250-megawatt power
plant without taking public input. After months-long review of several private
and city bids, the commission selected one of the city's bids. Some members
of the committee are not convinced the city should build its own plant says
GOP chairman Tom Woods. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's a real complicated issue,&quot; Woods said. &quot;I don't know
many people who know what it really is. I don't know that (people) are coming
out against the plant. They just don't know what it is.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
City Commissioner Scott Maddox will request town meetings in each quadrant
of Tallahassee for public input. Also, Tallahassee Mayor Ron Weaver drafted
a memo Monday requesting public hearings to be held at City Hall or a composed
presentation for interested groups.<BR>
<BR>
If built, the plant would be next to Purdom Power Plant on St. Mark's River
in Wakulla County. It would not begin running until the year 2000.</BLOCKQUOTE>

DEP cost benefit analyis</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>JACKSONVILLE -- (EnviroWorld) -- When environmental officials
discovered that The Nine-Mile Road Landfill<STRONG> </STRONG>in St. Johns
County had expanded 65 feet past its permitted boundary, they told the dump's
owner that the trespassing garbage would have to be removed. After all,
the construction debris landfill neighbors the St. Marks Pond Swamp, and
the company's permit requires that it keep a 200 foot buffer zone. <BR>
<BR>
But the expense of that solution weighed heavily when the Department of
Environmental Protection analyzed other options, and the agency decided
that the landfill operators could fill in some of the wetlands instead,
the Florida Times-Union reported.<BR>
<BR>
The decision, though it follows regulations, has angered both the Sierra
Club and the Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission, which criticized
DEP handling of the affair in a letter last week.<BR>
<BR>
Jacksonville DEP director Ernie Frey said the agency had no choice.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They're saying it's too much money to move the material,&quot; Frey
told the Times-Union. &quot;With this permitting situation, we just got
locked into a position. We did the best we could with the rules that we
had.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But the Game and Fish Commission's letter argued that better alternatives
to filling wetlands were available -- building a swale in the remaining
buffer zone, for example.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The logic of this just defies any reasoning known to man,&quot; Linda
Bremer of the Florida Sierra Club's wetlands commitee said.<BR>
<BR>
Rob Crawford, the landfill's general manager, said the dump expanded into
the buffer zone because debris was sliding down its sides. As part of the
wetland fill decision, the company must restore twice as much wetland area
as it destroys.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>BOCA RATON--(EnviroWorld)-- Allegedly infected strawberries
may carry more than just cyclospora, according to the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel.
A second parasite, blastocystis hominis, was found along with cyclospora
in a sample from the latest woman affected by the produce. <BR>
<BR>
The woman became ill hours after eating strawberries. Cyclospora usually
takes a couple of days before it makes an infected person sick. It is assumed
that the blastocystis in conjunction with the cyclospora caused the rapid
onset of symptoms.<BR>
<BR>
According to UCLA expert Lynne Garcia, transmission of blastocystis hominis
is through contaminated food or water. The symptoms associated with blastocystis
are diarrhea, cramps, fever, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. </BLOCKQUOTE>

The pit that was a former dump site for construction debris, tires and trees

County angered by Pinellas' proposal to refill wetlands on own property</A></STRONG></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>DARBY -- (EnviroWorld) -- Pinellas County wants to build an
oasis on property it owns in a water-starved area of Pasco County - with
the help of up to 4 million gallons of water per day, the Tampa Tribune
reported.<BR>
<BR>
Pinellas' proposal to refill up to 16 wetland areas on the Al Bar Ranch
with water pumped from the Floridan aquifer has sent Pasco officials and
water activists through the roof.<BR>
<BR>
Pinellas sucked the area dry in the first place by pumping water from the
Cross Bar Ranch wellfield, critics say, and now wants to replenish its own
property while leaving nearby Pasco homeowners dry.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They're our of their minds,&quot; Pasco County Commission Chairman
Ed Collins said, warning the proposal could wind up in court if the state
approves it. &quot;I'm willing to recommend to my board anything that it
takes to stop this from happening.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Pinellas purchased the 4,100-acre ranch in 1990 for $5.5 million, with plans
to turn it into a regional wellfield to supplement Cross Bar.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>PORT ST. JOE -- (EnviroWorld) -- The paper mill town of Port
St. Joe has ambitions of transforming itself into a resort community catering
to retirees and environmentally minded tourists, according to the Associated
Press.<BR>
<BR>
But Joe Hooper, who lives at nearby Cape San Blas, which the city wants
to annex, asked a nosy question during a public hearing Tuesday on Port
St. Joe's redevelopment plan. He wanted to know if the St. Joe Paper Co.
mill would dampen efforts to portray the coastal city in the Florida Panhandle
as a tourist mecca.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm talking about the aroma,&quot; Hooper said.<BR>
<BR>
City commissioners at first joked about the smell that prevailing winds
waft across Port St. Joe from the mill on the city's west side. But Sarasota
consultant Russell Moore of Design Studios West, which put the plan together,
said the mill remains the economic backbone of the city and residents should
continue to be proud of it.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't think it's something you put a big curtain around,&quot; Moore
said.<BR>
<BR>
City commissioners approved the plan, but the hard part will be following
through. <BR>
<BR>
Cape San Blas residents are skeptical about the plan's annexation proposal.
They want to know what they would be getting in return for paying city taxes
and are seeking insurance that their beaches won't be transformed into another
Panama City Beach.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>DELAND -- (EnviroWorld) -- Daytona Beach Community College has
plans to start a program by next June that will teach 100 people each year
how to make recreational boats, the Orlando Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
Today, the college will ask the Volusia County Council to authorize a $200,000
budget from the Port Authority to help launch the college's Regional Marine
Technology Training Center. <BR>
<BR>
The program will provide a trained work force for local boat manufacturing
companies. In addition, officials hope the center will attract new boat
manufacturers to Volusia and Flagler counties.<BR>
<BR>
Dan O'Brien, director of Port Authority Services, told the Sentinel the
training center would help Volusia County meet the goals it set in a 1994
economic development plan to strengthen the marine industry.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>OCALA -- (EnviroWorld) -- Law maintenance workers at a cemetery
in Ocala have said that for the past two years, used crank oil has been
dumped along the fences separating the cemetery and Wyomina Park Elementary
School, the Ocala Star-Banner reported.<BR>
<BR>
David Townsend, environmental health administrator for HRS, told the Star-Banner
that the owners of the cemetery, Hiers Funeral Home, were ordered to remove
and treat the soil. As of Tuesday, 6 to 8 inches of soil had already been
removed.<BR>
<BR>
John and Christopher Heitzman, lawn workers for Highland Memorial Park,
said they were ordered to dump the oil along the fence about three times
a year for the past 2 1/2 year. If they didn't listen they were threatened
with loosing their jobs, according to the brothers.<BR>
<BR>
Rick Sharp, the lawn worker's supervisor at the cemetery, told the Star-Banner
he never dumped any oil or ordered anyone to do it.<BR>
<BR>
Regardless of the situation, Townsend said the case will be referred to
the Department of Environmental Protection. But he doesn't think Hiers will
face any penalties because they cleaned the oil up quickly.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>OCALA -- (EnviroWorld) -- A coalition of private utilities proposed
a partnership with Marion County on Tuesday that would offer the county
more control over water and sewer business, the Ocala Star-Banner reported.<BR>
<BR>
County commissioners did not take any action on the proposal, but most are
eager to pursue it. Board members, who are trying to move the county into
the water and sewer business, believe a county-owned utility or network
of utilities would give the county more control over water supplies. In
addition, it would provide homeowners savings on insurance premiums by putting
fire hydrants in their subdivisions. The utilities will benefit from the
pact also as the city of Ocala continues to expand its service area<BR>
<BR>
The coalition includes 10 utilities including: Tradewinds Utilities, Marion
Utilities, Ocala Oaks Utilities, Windstream Utilities, Sunshine Utilities,
BFF Corp., C.F.A.T. H20 Inc., Residential Water Systems, Countrywide Utilities,
and A.P. Utilities. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>DARBY -- (EnviroWorld) -- Attorney's from two key parties in
one of the region's various water battles met earlier this week in attempt
to reach a possible settlement. But, by Tuesday morning, no agreements were
met, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
The main issue in the litigation is the Southwest Florida Water Management
District's right to key wellfield pumping levels to the condition of the
surrounding environment. <BR>
<BR>
When Swiftmud renewed pumping permits on three St. Petersburg wells earlier
this year, it attached environmental protection standards limitations that
prompted lawsuits. Swiftmud plans to attach these limitations to all wellfield
permits up for renewal.<BR>
<BR>
Swiftmud also has lawsuits pending with Pinellas County and the West Coast
Regional Water Supply Authority, both of whom are supporting St. Petersburg's
suit.<BR>
<BR>
If an agreement had been met on Monday, then St. Petersburg and Swiftmud
would be considering a settlement today at the council's meeting. And the
district board would be considering a settlement with St. Petersburg next
week.<BR>
<BR>
Now, the two sides will have to meet in court next month.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It looks like St. Petersburg has decided to join Pinellas County's
position of deciding everything by litigation instead of cooperation,&quot;
Honey Rand, a spokeswoman for the water management district told the Times.
&quot;When we walked away from the meeting, we believed we had an agreement,
at least at the staff level. We knew it had to be approved by the City Council
and our board, but we were very hopeful.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- Angered that the West Coast Regional
Supply authority has voted to apply for permits to pump extra water from
a wellfield on its northern border, Hillsborough County is looking at possible
measures to stop the action, the St. Petersburg Times reported.<BR>
<BR>
West Coast had voted to seek to double the amount of water it could pump
from the Cypress Bridge wellfield in south-central Pasco on the Hillsborough
border. The authority has been pumping 8 million gallons a day, but eventually
wants to boost pumping to 16 million a day.<BR>
<BR>
Objections from Hillsborough and Pasco counties came from concern over the
environmental damage that may occur from over-pumping. Hillsborough Commissioner
Ed Turanchik and Pasco Commissioner Ed Collins argue that to seek an increase
in pumping without data on environmental effects is foolhardy.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are not going to have the environmental damage that has been inflicted
in the past in northwest Hillsborough and Pasco happen again on our watch,&quot;
Turanchik said, according to the Times. &quot;The short-term advantage to
West Coast is going to turn into a long-term nightmare.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Turanchik wrote a letter on Wednesday to Jerry Maxwell, general manager
of West Coast, telling him what he thought. But as of late Wednesday, there
was no response from Maxwell.<BR>
<BR>
The permit request would have to be approved by the Southwest Florida Water
Management District, which has often been behind efforts to develop alternative
sources to groundwater.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>GAINESVILLE-- (EnviroWorld) -- Alachua County has short listed
three waste disposal companies in its search for future disposal, according
to the Gainesville Sun. Bedminster Bioconversion Corp, Browning-Ferris Industries
and Waste Management have each made the list, all with different plans for
the county's garbage.<BR>
<BR>
Bedminster and BFI both guarantee that at least 60 percent of the county's
waste will be recycled; Bedminster, by creating a marketable compost mixing
garbage with sewer sludge and BFI, by a wet/dry recycling center.<BR>
<BR>
Waste Management has no plans to recycle; they intend to ship the garbage
out of county by rail to a Panhandle landfill. <BR>
<BR>
Currently, the county recycles about 39 percent of its waste. The permit
for the Southwest Landfill near Archer expires August 1998.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CLEARWATER-- (EnviroWorld) -- County officials in Clearwater
are finally completing the Pinellas Trail. The 2-mile &quot;Clearwater Gap&quot;
will be closed when construction ends in May 1997, according to the St.
Petersburg Times. <BR>
<BR>
The last stretch passes through downtown Clearwater and will cost $900,000.
Officials plan to start the project in November. It was originally to be
completed in May of 1994.<BR>
<BR>
The trail was never completed because CSX Transportation refused to allow
the county to build a 10-foot-wide sidewalk on its easement. The easement
was granted to CSX by the city over 80 years ago to lay railroad tracks.
CSX says it is a safety hazard to have a recreational trail built that close
to a railroad right of way. <BR>
<BR>
The problem was solved by narrowing the trail on the railroad side and an
agreement by the county to build handrails and barricades around CSX buildings
along the trail. The county will also pay to have the company's signals
and other devices move out of the path of the trail.</BLOCKQUOTE>

State authorities who tested the facility found that it was releasing 10
times the acceptable level of fecal coliform into collection ponds. The

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE-- (EnviroWorld)-- After 15 years as director of
environmental compliance for Leon County, Helge Swanson was fired Wednesday
morning, according to the Tallahassee Democrat.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm still in a state of shock. I have until 5 p.m. to get out of my
office,&quot; Swanson said Wednesday. He declined further comment.<BR>
<BR>
Swanson's boss, Growth and Environmental Management Director Gary Johnson,
said that it not politics that determined Swanson's firing. Rather, it was
his attitude. Johnson claims Swanson was becoming increasingly difficult
to work with. Johnson ran Growth Management for one year.<BR>
<BR>
It is uncertain whether county commissioners will vote to reinstate Swanson.
At least two commissioners, Cliff Thaell and Gary Yordon, said they think
feel Swanson's firing was a wrong move.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm opposed to this, I think it's a mistake,&quot; Thaell said. &quot;Helge
has been a leader in our concern about the environment, and it sends the
wrong message at this time of environmental threats.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Yordon also said he would support a vote to reinstate Swanson, or to find
some way to keep his expertise in the county.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, local environmental activists are being sought by Thaell, Yordon
and County Administrator Parwez Alem to launch a nationwide search for the
next director of environmental compliance.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)-- Leon County officials voted to
reject Talquin Electric Cooperative's permit for a wastewater sprayfield
near Lake Iamonia, the Tallahassee Democrat reported.<BR>
<BR>
Talquin planned to build the sprayfield near the Golden Eagle golf course
which would extend service to Killearn Lakes communities. The permit would
have allowed 700,000 gallons per day of sewage discharge next to the 5,700-acre
Lake Iamonia near Tallahassee.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I was surprised at it and disappointed,&quot; said George Galloway,
a spokesperson for the utility. &quot;Until we've had a chance to go through
and evaluate it, I can't say what action we will take, if any.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Opponents were concerned that phosphates and nitrates would eventually flow
into the water because the plant would have been within 150 feet from the
lake.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There was basically a lack of ability to demonstrate that that would
not happen,&quot; said Helge Swanson, who was the director of Leon County's
Environmental Compliance department before being fired Wednesday (see story
in today's EnviroWorld). Swanson rejected the application because of the
&quot;high probability of nutrient pollution of Lake Iamonia.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Talquin may appeal the decision.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Volusia County officials said they are willing to reroute their plans and

Scarlett-Golden and George Burdon after Daytona Beach Mayor Bud Asher did
not put the developer's request on City Commission agenda. His reason: he
did not want the debate to be too divisive for the community.</BLOCKQUOTE>

by Hillsborough Commissioners</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA -- (EnviroWorld) -- Hillsborough County commissioners,
led by Ed Turanchik, are seeking ways to stop West Coast Regional Water
Supply Authority from increasing the amount of water it pumps from the county's
wellfields, the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
The Commission scheduled a workshop to discuss the county's options after
West Coast's board of directors voted Monday to increase pumping at the
Cypress Bridge wellfield from 7 million to 16 million gallons a day. <BR>
<BR>
Turanchik, who is a Hillsborough County commissioner and a member of West
Coast's board, voted against the pumping proposal, which must be permitted
by the Southwest Florida Water Management District (Swiftmud). Thursday,
Turanchik told the Tribune, &quot;There's no scientific basis we've been
shown that 12 or 16 million gallons a day won't harm the environment.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
One gambit Turnachik has proposed is for the county to delay approval of
funds for West Coast's water resource development plan. The Commission is
also discussing an appeal if Swiftmud approves West Coast's pumping permit.<BR>
<BR>
West Coast general manager Jerry Maxwell said an environmental impact study,
which predicts no environmental damage from the increased pumping, will
be delivered today to all members of West Coast's board, including Turnanchik.</BLOCKQUOTE>

4 million items, mostly butts</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON -- (EnviroWorld) -- In a single day of beach and
river cleaning, volunteers picked up 4 million pieces of trash, including
more than 800,000 cigarette butts, the Center for Marine Conservation announced.
Florida placed second to California in its cleanup efforts, according to
a story on the cleanup in the Tampa Tribune.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We need to teach people that butts do not degrade,&quot; cleanup coordinator
Seba Sheavly said. &quot;You will not believe what people will put into
the water thinking, 'Out of sight, Out of mind' is OK.'&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The September effort removed 445,384 pounds of garbage from the Florida's
coasts, and included 100,000 butts, 25,000 cans, and 900 condoms. According
to the national statistics, 64 percent of the rubbish came from individuals.</BLOCKQUOTE>

contracts</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TAMPA --(EnviroWorld) -- Hillsborough County has been served
by non-competitive waste-hauling contracts for 23 years; Thursday the County
Commission realized that changing that course will take more time than expected,
the Tampa Tribune reported.<BR>
<BR>
Though the county had expected to advertise bids for the contracts last
February, commissioners have not been able to flesh out details of the services
they want, and so voted to extend the current garbage contracts for 10 1/2
months.<BR>
<BR>
Those contracts were scheduled to end in November and are primarily held
by Waste Management, which handles most of the county's commercial waste,
and BFI, which collects most residential waste.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;If we were bidding exactly the same system -- don't talk about recycling,
yard waste or making any changes to the system -- the process would have
gone more quickly,&quot; County Administrator Dan Kleman told the Tribune.
&quot;We simply underestimated how long it would take.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>MIRAMAR -- (EnviroWorld) -- Workers began boring holes near
homes Tuesday looking for evidence of illegal dumping in a 307-home subdivision,
the Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel reported.<BR>
<BR>
The Hampshire Home subdivision surrounds a water-filled pit that was a common
area until 250 truckloads (more than 11 tons) of garbage were removed from
the site last March. Now, 100 homeowners are suing developer Lennar Homes
and have hired Subsurface Detection Investigations to look for more buried
rubbish.<BR>
<BR>
Thus far, they have found pieces of plastic, a hinge, scraps of metal and
a two-foot-long lawn-mower blade.<BR>
<BR>
Engineers are already examining the pit to determine how to curb the erosion
along its banks.<BR>
<BR>
Lennar has offered to fill the pit, check for debris elsewhere and buy unrepairable
homes, but the homeowners involved in the suit rejected the offer.</BLOCKQUOTE>

tune</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>MIAMI -- (EnviroWorld) -- Scientists and governmental policy
officials are making more definitive statements about the effects of global
warming as evidence of the phenonenah accrues, the Associated Press reported.<BR>
<BR>
A number of those officials, including Florida Insurance Commissioner Bill
Nelson and U.S. undersecretary of State for Global Affairs Timothy Wirth,
met in Miami Thursday for the Town Hall Meeting on Climate Change and Florida's
Future.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There is now overwhelming agreement in the scientific community that
as carbon goes up, we can see temperatures starting to go up,&quot; Wirth
said. &quot;The international scientific community is saying, 'This is happening.
Hey, pay attention. This could have disastrous consequences.'&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Chief among the worries for Floridians are an estimated $2 trillion worth
of insured coastal properties that face rising sea levels and more dangerous
tropical storms. Nelson said that 1992's Hurricane Andrew played a large
part in making the insurance industry aware of the potential effects of
global warming.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Global warming not only causes the sea to rise and threatens all infrastructure
along the coast, but it also spawns these intense storms,&quot; Nelson said.
&quot;Hurricane Andrew has redefined the allocation of risk through the
entire world.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The town meeting's tone was largely set by the United Nations International
Panel on Climate Change report, released last month, that brought together
the predictions of 2,500 experts. That report predicted that global temperatures
could rise as much as 6 degrees in the next century.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE-- (EnviroWorld)-- With several development issues
unresolved, one Leon county administrator says Helge Swanson is fired and
there's no going back, according to the Tallahassee Democrat.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I have made my decision. I cannot go back on my decision,&quot; said
Leon County's top environmental officer, County Administrator Parwez Alam.
<BR>
<BR>
Alam, who, along with county Growth and Environmental Director Gary Johnson,
fired Swanson, the Environmental Permitting Director, on Wednesday. The
reason cited for Swanson's firing was that he failed to conform to county
management style.<BR>
<BR>
Some people in the community believe Swanson was fired because he voted
against Talquin Electric Corporations bid to build a sprayfield company
within 150 feet of Lake Iamonia. &quot;The perception is that after the
perceived strong-arm tactics on the sprayfield, this was the result,&quot;
said Lane Green, executive director of Tall Timbers Research Station, an
environmental group which works to preserve the red-hills area around Lake
Iamonia.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't think this is an issue of referendum or popularity contests.
It's an issue of having good county government and being productive,&quot;
said Alam about Swanson's firing. Alam added that Swanson's firing had nothing
to do with the Talquin decision.<BR>
<BR>
Swanson also contends that his firing had nothing to with the Talquin decision.
Swanson was given one day notice before his firing and two weeks pay.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Leon County Lakes</STRONG></A></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)-- Pollution is deteriorating two
major lakes in Leon County so quickly that scientists and environmental
planners are calling for serious controls on development near the lakes,
according to the Tallahassee Democrat.<BR>
<BR>
At least one suggestion, a ban on all commercial development in the 27,000-plus-acre
drainage basin of Lake Jackson, is unlikely to be adopted by elected officials
due to its lack of popularity.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's clearly high time that people in Leon County realize that their
presence is affecting the quality of our lakes, and ultimately our drinking
water,&quot; said Bruce Means, one of the scientists of the Coastal Plains
Institute who presented their findings to Leon County commissioners.<BR>
<BR>
County commissioners asked the scientists to offer other, less harsh options.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Creating building moratoriums is not something that is a viable option,&quot;
said County Commission Chairman Bruce Host. &quot;From a common sense point
of view, you can't go that far with someone who has a legal right to use
their property.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile in eastern Leon County, similar deterioration was noted in Lake
Lafayette in a 1994 report by Skip Livingston, a Florida State University
biologist. His report suggested protection zones should be created around
the lake and its tributaries. Development would be limited just to houses
on the shores of the lake and water bodies that feed into it.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We need to get development where it won't hurt the environment,&quot;
said Helge Swanson, former county chief of environmental permitting, in
May referring to Lake Lafayette.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>HOLLYWOOD--(EnviroWorld)-- Legal parking will be easier in Hollywood
since the City Commission voted Wednesday to make dramatic changes to offer
short-term solutions for drivers, reported the Miami Herald reported.<BR>
<BR>
Some solutions, to name a few, include lowering hourly charges in Maurice
J. Connell parking garage on Johnson Street from $1 to 50 cents, unrestricted
parking at meters on beach streets and parking lots for city residents and
occupational license holders (excluding owners of hotels, motels and large
apartments) with set annual costs and permits for restricted parking on
beach streets for those with an occupational license to run a beach hotel
or motel.<BR>
<BR>
Sam Finz, Hollywood city manager, said the measures won't solve parking
problems on the beach, but it may help the city out of its financial woes.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>WEST PALM BEACH--(EnviroWorld)-- West Palm Beach county commissioners
may sue Delray Beach for the right to build a recycling plant along Congress
Avenue, reported the Palm Beach Post.<BR>
<BR>
The decision to sue will not be enacted for 90 days to allow the commission
to seek out an alternative site. If nothing comes up, the commissioners
will begin the legal battle.<BR>
<BR>
Delray residents are concerned that the 100 trucks in use daily along Congress
Avenue would choke traffic. &quot;The decision is unfair,&quot; said Delray
Beach resident Frances Fisher, 69. &quot;They'll make it impossible to travel.&quot;<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>PENSACOLA--(EnviroWorld)-- Though the catfish die-off has occurred
since mid-May, biologists and the Department of Environmental Protection
are now advising people to avoid the fish and the waters where they are
washing ashore, reported The Associated Press.<BR>
<BR>
The die-off has been noted throughout the Gulf of Mexico shores from Texas
to the Tampa Bay area. Biologists are not certain of what they are dealing
with. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's a real mystery,&quot; said Dick Fancher, environmental administrator
for the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation in Pensacola. &quot;All
we know for certain is something is killing only hardhead catfish, which
we've never seen before.&quot;<BR>

catfish, keep out of out of water where dead catfish have washed ashore
and avoid eating any type of catfish caught in the waters where the deaths
have occurred.</BLOCKQUOTE>

approach to environmental protection enforcement, according to the St. Petersburg
Times. Secretary Virginia Wetherell has encouraged voluntary actions by
companies that break regulations, collecting fewer fines and reducing the
number of people they take to court. <BR>

Revenues from enforcement this fiscal year dropped 75 percent to date. Last
year, enforcement yielded $7.8 million; this year it was $1.5 million, the
smallest sum this decade. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>RUSKIN--(EnviroWorld)-- State agencies converged on a Ruskin
slaughterhouse after decomposing greyhounds were found on the premises,
the Tallahassee Democrat reported. The Skip Lea Co. processes animal carcasses
into food for dogs, alligators and Florida panthers. <BR>
<BR>
The company was cited two months ago for allowing cow heads to rot in the
yard. A health inspector discovered an open trench draining water mixed
with blood and guts into an illegal septic tank. Animal Services investigators
dug up the remains of at least eight dogs behind the facility, operating
on a tip from the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Department. <BR>
<BR>
The company manager claims that someone dumped the dogs on the loading dock
two weeks ago. He stated that people often leave dead animals on the premises
and that they usually take them out back and bury them. These dogs were
not buried until this week, though, according to officials. <BR>
<BR>
A health inspector with the state Department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services cited the company for the rotting cow heads, but the issue with
the illegal septic tank was passed to the DEP as an industrial waste issue.
The DEP responded by telling Skip Lea that they did not need an industrial
wastewater permit, but that they should have the septic tank repaired by
an HRS licensed company. <BR>
<BR>
The DEP said they expected the Hillsborough County Environmental Protection
Commission to investigate the dead dogs. The EPC claims they were waiting
for the DEP to investigate, citing it a solid-waste disposal issue.<BR>

Skip Lea is not regulated by either state or federal agriculture agencies.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>NEW YORK--(EnviroWorld)-- Owens Corning filed suit in U.S. District
Court in Louisiana Wednesday, according to the Palm Beach Post. The former
producer of asbestos is suing three medical testing companies: Pulmonary
Advisory Services Inc., Pulmonary Advisory Services of Louisiana Inc. and
Pulmonary Advisory Services of Mississippi Inc. Owens Corning claims that
the companies falsified approximately 25,000 asbestos-related damage claims.
<BR>
<BR>
The company has been plagued with health claims for years due to asbestos,
a fibrous material used in insulation which is known to damage lungs when
inhaled. They face about 150,000 related claims. Owens Corning has not manufactured
asbestos since 1972. <BR>
<BR>
Additionally, The Miami Herald reported that the second quarter profits
for Owens Corning Corp. will be cut by $1.1 billion to cover asbestos claims
into the next century. More than 21,000 claims have been filed against the

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)-- Congress is considering a proposal
that would require municipal water systems to tell the public what contaminates
are in the local drinking water, the Gainesville Sun reported. The findings
would be placed in a water bill that would explain what pollutants were
found, what federal standards were violated and how the finding could affect
consumers' health. <BR>
<BR>
This is the latest in a surge of federal programs that deal with pollution
by making the information available to the public.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>SUWANNEE--(EnviroWorld)-- Two female black bears transplanted
from the Wekiva River to the mouth of the Suwannee River adapted well, according
to the Gainesville Sun. The success of the experiment has state biologists
planning a broader relocation program to restore Florida's threatened bear
population.<BR>
<BR>
The state Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission wants to use the Rock Springs
Run State Preserve population, the densest population in the state, as a
donor for bears over the next three years. Florida Park Service is unsure
about the request for donating bears, especially females, fearing it could
reduce the rate of reproduction.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>LOOE KEY--(EnviroWorld)-- An algae that occurs due to pollution
is threatening the reef at Looe Key, according to the Palm Beach Post. Indicative
of human or animal waste or farm runoff, algae of the genus Cladophora has
been spotted near the reef at the Looe Key National Marine Sanctuary. <BR>

Sources that could possibly be feeding the algae are septic tanks and shallow

<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON--(EnviroWorld)-- Proposed budget cuts by the House
Appropriations Committee could cause part of the federal right-to-know database
to be jeopardized, the Palm Beach Post reported. The Toxics Release Inventory
allows any citizen to get information on toxic chemicals released in the
workplace, transported through towns and put into consumer products. <BR>

A proposed 5 percent, $1.5-million, cut in the program would impede the

<BLOCKQUOTE>GREENBELT, Md.--(EnviroWorld)-- James J. Wilson, chairman of
the board for Interstate General, a real-estate development company, was
sentenced in U.S. District Court on June 17, for illegal filling of wetlands

<BR>
Additionally, two companies that took part in the development on the filled
wetland have been fined $3-million. Interstate General was fined $2-million
and St. Charles Associates was fined $1-million. Both companies were also
placed on five years probation during which they must develop an environmental
compliance plan to prevent future violations. <BR>

Daly'swritings, including a forthcoming book titled &quot;Beyond Growth: the Economicsof Sustainable Development,&quot; hold that growth must be stopped if thenatural environment is to survive. &quot;[E]conomic growth increases environmentalcosts faster than it increases production benefits and thereby makes uspoorer rather than richer in an inclusive sense,&quot; he writes.<BR><BR>Daly is at the forefront of a movement within economics called ecologicaleconomics, which is not yet accepted by mainstream economists. Robert Solow,of MIT, calls Daly an alarmist, and Paul Romer, of the University of Californiaat Berkeley, said Daly's writings are &quot;permeated with do-goodism andnot enough hard science.&quot;<BR><BR>Robert Goodland, of the World Bank, however, said Daly is an &quot;unsunghero.&quot; &quot;Herman made us realize that economics is the science ofscarcity.

The trend is likely to accelerate as the Environmental ProtectionAgency finalizes new emission standards for hazardous waste combustion facilities,according to a report by Environmental Information, Ltd. <BR><BR>Since 1994, 13 industrial facilities have ceased their hazardous waste operations.In the same period, only one facility built a new incinerator.<BR><BR>The EPA estimates that on-site and captive hazardous waste incineratorsburn roughly 800,000 tons of waste each year. EI's research suggests thatnumber is actually more than one million tons. Most of the waste burnedin company-owned units consists of liquid organic chemicals, but EI hasfound that sludges and solids make up a significant share of on-site burnvolumes.<BR><BR>A new EPA rule, proposed earlier this year, will set standards for emissionsof metals, dioxin, particulates and other pollutants. It is believed thenew standards is that more than half of the on-site hazardous waste operationswill be forced to close down. EI notes that this will only drive more businessto the commercial waste-burning industry.<BR><BR>To receive more information on this subject or EI, call 612-831-2473 orcall EI Customer Service at 800-593-6271.</H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3><BR><BR><BR><A NAME="anchor134704"></A><BR><HR><A HREF="../News/statenews.html">Return to State News Cover Page</A>| <A HREF="#anchor543885">Return to today's headlines</A><HR><A HREF="#anchor134704">FormerDEP general counsel will join Gray, Harris &amp; Robinson</A></H3><BLOCKQUOTE><H3>TALLAHASSEE--(EnviroWorld)-- After nearly 10 years as general counselto the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and its predecessor,the Department of Natural Resources, Ken Plante will join the Orlando-basedlaw firm of Gray, Harris &amp; Robinson, P.A.

Lawton Chiles has once again madea controversial appointment to the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.This time it's friend and campaign contributor Joe Bruner, the Florida Times-Unionreported. In 1990, Bruner was convicted in Louisiana of hunting after hoursand carrying a fraudulent license. <BR><BR>Since 1992, the commission has received several complaints against the manwho is now a member. Of those complaints, two were for baiting quail fieldsand two were for trying to force other hunters off state land. In 1993,Bruner was banned from the Gulf Coast Shooting Dog Championship for allegedlyfiring live ammunition at a dog trail and threatening members. <BR><BR>As a game commissioner, Bruner will be able to decide what may be caught,how many and where, and who may fish and hunt. As one of the five game commissionersin the state, he will also have say in the approval of wildlife managementareas. <BR><BR>Next spring, the Senate must confirm Bruner's seat on the commission, whichwould last until 2001.
