Jim Bakker received two standing ovations at a memorial service for his former
broadcast partner "Uncle" Henry Harrison. The past head of PTL ministries
spoke to nearly 2,000 people Feb. 12 at
the former Heritage USA complex in Fort
Mill, S.C. Bakker's sermon, which he
delivered at the request of Harrison's
family, was his first since being released
from prison after five years.
<BR>..."I've got my whole life in front of me,"
Bakker told the crowd, which was dominated by old friends and PTL supporters.
Grayer and thinner, Bakker spent the
hour on stage preaching about the power
of Jesus to save even sinners in prison.

Billy Graham, 76, said he may use video
to preach his own funeral message. Graham suggested to syndicated columnist
Cal Thomas on his CNBC cable program
that he might disclose hitherto confidential information at that time. Friends of
the evangelist speculated that it could be
anecdotes about national and international leaders who have died.
<P>
The American Bar Association chose Lee
Cooper, a Birmingham, Ala., lawyer, to
lead the 370,000-member group. The
ABA went on record as opposing any
congressional effort to return organized
prayer to schools. But Cooper, who said
he will use his influence to change ABA
policies, said that the return of prayer to
schools would be one step toward a
"spiritual revival" in the country.

Gary Bauer, head of the Family Research Council, has dismissed U.S. Surgeon General nominee Henry Foster,
Jr., as "Elders-Lite," a reference to controversial former Surgeon General
Jocelyn Elders. Foster may not use

Robert Tilton's lawsuit against journalist
Diane Sawyer, ABC News, and the Trinity Foundation, a religious media watchdog group (NIRR 4/4/94), has been dismissed  by a judge. Tilton, a former television evangelist, alleged a conspiracy to
drive his ministry out of business. At issue was a 1991 story on ABC PrimeTime
Live critical of Tilton and his ministry. A
libel suit against ABC News is scheduled
for trial in June.

Leslie Parrott nearly brought the house
down at Puyallup (Wash.) Church of the
Nazarene Jan. 28. The former president
of Olivet Nazarene University was

One hundred students and faculty
members from Christian colleges and
Bible schools were briefed by officials at
the White House and Supreme Court
Justice Clarence Thomas this month.
They were part of the yearly Federal
Seminars sponsored by the National Association of Evangelicals. Students also
met numerous political and religious leaders during the weeklong program. The
seminars, in their 39th year, encourage
students to consider careers in public
service and help them appreciate the role
the Christian faith plays in government.
Some 800 youth attended World Changers, a conference featuring motivational
speakers and music in Boise, Idaho, Jan.
14. Idaho Family Forum, an interdenominational group, sponsored the event to
challenge young people in their Christian
faith the way Promise Keepers challenges men, the group said. Speakers included John Eldredge of Focus on the Family
and Ted Baehr of the Christian Film and
Television Commission. 
<P>
More than 140,000 U.S. teen-agers
signed up to participate in World Vision's
annual 30 Hour Famine (NIRR 3/8/94),
Feb. 24-25. Participants will drink only
water and fruit juices. Funds raised from
sponsors are used to feed people
through projects of the Christian reliefand-development organization in the
United States and overseas. For information, call 1-800-7-FAMINE.
<P>
The Christian College Coalition is
changing its name to the Coalition for
Christian Colleges and Universities. The
new title reflects the Washington, D.C.based group's expansion to include
worldwide non-member affiliates. The
CCCU includes 90 member institutions
that enroll a total of 130,000 students.
<P>
The number of Catholic seminarians in
the United States dropped 3.4% in the
last year, according to the Seminary Directory. At the start of the 1994-1995
school year, there were 6,030 students
for the priesthood, compared with 6,244
the previous academic year.
<P>
A group of 80 physically handicapped
Catholic nuns have given their lives to
prayer. They belong to monastic prayer
communities located in France, Japan,
Holland, England, Rhode Island, and
Pennsylvania. The groups are known as
the Sisters of Jesus Crucified. Physical
suffering that is dedicated to God can
take on great value, just as Jesus' suffering did, Sister Margaret Mary Nolan told
the Providence Journal-Bulletin.
<P>
The group that governs training of
physicians decided that obstetrical residents must be taught how to perform
abortions. The Accreditation Council for
Graduate Medical Education said residents must take training unless they have
a moral or religious objection. The council can withhold accreditation from hospitals, which would then lose federal funds. 
<P>
Among voters who consider abortion
a priority issue, pro-life supporters outnumber pro-choice supporters 2-1, a poll
by Wirthlin Group of McLean, Va., found.

"The terrorists have awakened courage
as much as fear," Gloria Steinem told
religious leaders Jan. 22 at New York's
Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine during a Convention for Peace at
Women's Health Centers. The event was
organized by Planned Parenthood. Joan
Brown Campbell, general secretary of
the National Council of Churches, said
her presence with 18 other leaders was
"a sign that things are changing" in the
religious community.
<P>
Minneapolis cannot offer health-care
benefits to the partners of homosexual

appeals court ruled. The action upheld a
lower court decision that struck down the
city's policy last June.

Parishioners at five Washington, D.C.area Catholic churches sat in stunned
silence as a letter was read from the
pulpit after Sunday mass. In it, Cardinal
James Hickey announced that four
priests who had served the churches
were removed after confessing to sexual
abuse of boys. The priests, who range in
age from 50 to 70, were sent to four separate treatment facilities.    
<P>
A survey of church secretary salaries
found that Mennonite churches tend to
pay the highest ($10.50 per hour fulltime, $9.20 part-time), and Christian
Churches (Disciples of Christ) the lowest
($7.25 full-time, $6 part-time). Large
churches (more than 1,000 members)
pay an average $9.74 per hour, and
churches with fewer than 300, $8.45.
Other findings for full-time secretaries:
72% are members of the churches where
they work; 98% receive paid vacation
leave, but only 47% receive medical insurance; 91% work with computers, with
60% doing desktop publishing. Results
were published in Profiles, a bimonthly
newsletter for church secretaries.

"Despite legal changes, religious persecution continues" in Cuba, according to a
State Department report on human rights
abuses around the world. Foreign evangelists recently have been allowed to visit
the country and the Catholic Church
again has a bishop there. However, the
government still watches religious
groups, requires churches to register,
and imprisons some religious leaders.

Zimbabwe: Former British missionary
Guy Clutton-Brock, who died in Wales
last month at 88, was declared a hero by
the government. Clutton-Brock, an agriculturalist, arrived in the African country,
then Rhodesia, in the 1940s. He worked
with black nationalists, including many of
those in power today, to end colonialism
and white minority rule. He is the only
white person to be named among the
country's 38 official heroes.

Benin: A Christian church won a legal
battle with fetishists who worship snakes.
Fetishists stole the Azoule'-Cada Baptist
Church's sign after church members
killed two pythons they found in their
beds rather than letting them go. The
government told the fetishists to return
the sign and stop leaving snakes in the
beds. The village's mayor then authorized the church to show Christian films,
and more than 250 people attended.

South Africa: A mob stoned and burned
to death a 72-year-old man accused of
practicing witchcraft in a remote village,
police said. The crowd accused him of
causing lightning that killed a schoolboy
last month. Police and church leaders
launched an education drive to stem an
upsurge in witchcraft murders in the
Northern Transvaal province.
<P>
South Africa: Accused of embezzling
Scandinavian aid funds, anti-apartheid
clergyman Allan Boesak withdrew as
South Africa's ambassador-designate to
the United Nations. He said he would sell
his luxury home in a Cape Town suburb
to repay funds missing at the Foundation
for Peace and Justice, which he heads.
Press accounts place the amount between $600,000 and $1 million. Boesak
blamed his bookkeeper. Police also have
opened an investigation into the disappearance of $120,000 donated by singer
Paul Simon to a children's trust administered by Boesak, news outlets reported.

Sudan: Proclaiming religious tolerance,
Christian and Muslim groups in Sudan
have agreed to fight together against
fundamentalist Muslims in that country's
bloody civil war. The Islamic Umma Party
and the mostly Christian rebel groups
made the announcement in late December, News Network International reported.
The National Islamic Front in Khartoum,
the radical regime that rules northern Sudan, "has a mission of taking the whole
continent" for Islam, sources in the NNI
report said.

China: Vatican Radio broadcast a message from eight bishops of the clandestine Catholic Church in China. Beamed to
China, the messages focused on the
need for Chinese Catholics to remain
united with the pope. China's communist
rulers broke ties with the Vatican after
seizing power in 1949, and then set up
an independent Catholic church. However, Rome estimates that some 5 million
to 8 million Catholics there remain loyal
to the pope.
<P>
Israel: Many cars that are stolen from
Israel are resold in Palestine and "every
[Palestinian] car seller has an Israeli partner," Newsweek reported. Two Israeli soldiers recently were charged with smuggling dozens of cars into Gaza. Cooperation between Palestinian and Israeli police is practically nonexistent, and a deputy police chief in Gaza acknowledged
that most of his force's cars were stolen
from Israel.

Japan: Catholic bishops in Japan will
issue a pastoral letter observing the 50th
anniversary of the end of World War II,

Croatia-Bosnia: Declaring solidarity with
Bosnian Muslims, evangelical churches

Bulgaria: Baptists may lose their land
and their partially constructed church
buildings in Sophia. The mayor, under
pressure by Orthodox leaders and the

The Baptist World Alliance called on Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev to intervene and stop the "harassment." 
<P>
Estonia: Leaders of the Estonian Orthodox Church, which was banned under
former Soviet rule, have appealed to
world Orthodoxy's spiritual leader, Bartholomew I, to intervene in a dispute with
the Russian Orthodox Church. At issue is
control over the EOC's religious life and
property, they said. The EOC won restoration of its status and rights, and prevailed in several court cases seeking return of property. The Moscow-based
ROC, however, continues to fight rulings
in court.

Christian churches in Kobe, Japan, are gaining a higher profile in the
aftermath of last month's earthquake. Because churches are providing food,
shelter, and other aid, the Japanese are gaining a greater awareness of Christian
values, Kathy Anderson of Food for the Hungry told NIRR. Christians have
given their homes, time, and goods, although they themselves have suffered great
losses. Japanese people are generally reserved, but they are beginning to ask
questions about the church, Anderson said from the Mukonoso Evangelical Free
Church in Kobe. While touring the area on bicycles, Anderson and other staff
noticed that, even in the hardest-hit areas, many churches still are standing. She
speculated that God spared them for use as shelters and relief centers.
<BR>...Global Mission, Billy Graham's crusade to be televised to 165 countries
March 16-18 (NIRR 1/9/95), lost most of its 30 viewing sites in Kobe during the
quake. City leaders agreed to help by bulldozing an entire city block to clear an
area for an open-air meeting by satellite on a large screen. "Some of the greatest
meetings we have held in Japan have been in the Osaka-Kobe area," Graham
said at a Feb. 7 press conference to officially launch Global Mission.

An entire village near Yelets, Russia, turned to Christ in a single meeting,
Southern Baptist missionaries Larry Lindsey and Norman Lytle said. The men
went to Yelets to deliver $14,000 given by Binghamtown Baptist Church in
Middlesboro, Ky., Baptist Press said. The money was used to buy a building for
a 25-member congregation, the only evangelical group in the city of 140,000.
<BR>...A elderly woman in a nearby village, apparently the only believer there,
heard about the missionaries' visit to Yelets and arranged for a service in her village. All 80 villagers attended. Several of the Yelets believers sang, and both
missionaries preached during a two-hour service. As the service concluded, the
translator asked all who wished to profess faith in Christ as Savior to step forward. All 80 came forward. Lindsey thought they had misunderstood the appeal,
and explained further. They all said they understood perfectly and wanted to
become Christians. The elderly woman invited them to her home for a weekly
Bible study, which the Yelets Christians said they would help organize.

At least 1,000 Peruvians accepted Christ last month at a prayer meeting
that turned into a rally, evangelist Alberto Mottesi (NIRR 9/19/94) told NIRR.
About 20,000 people gathered in the Plaza de Armas in Lima, the center of
Peru's capital. A large number of unbelievers, including government leaders and
the families of a presidential and vice-presidential candidate, attended unexpectedly and responded to the gospel message. 
<BR>..."There are seasons of the Holy Spirit for nations and I believe Peru is at
its highlight," Mottesi said. In the past, evangelical church growth averaged 7%
in the mostly Catholic country, but in 1994 the church grew by 30% and 3,000
new churches began, Enrique Chirinos of the National Evangelical Peruvian
Council said. The determination of church leaders and the turmoil of Peruvian
society are factors in this growth, Mottesi said.

The so-called Toronto Blessing is manifesting itself in hundreds of German
Protestant churches, reports idea, the information service of the German Evangelical Alliance. The phenomenon (NIRR 7/11/94) is characterized by uncontrollable laughter, shaking, crying, and collapsing under the power of the Holy Spirit.
It began at the Toronto Airport Vineyard Church in 1993 and has moved into
many parts of the world.
<BR>...Reaction among German evangelicals is mixed. Rolfe Hille of the
German Evangelical Alliance termed it "religious madness" though not antiChristian. Rudi Penke of the Christian Centre in Frankfurt predicted the number
of churches swept into it will double within a few months.

Calling Christianity a "foreign religion that is culturally disruptive," many
African writers and academics advocate a return to traditional African religions,
according to Mark Shaw of Scott Theological College in Kenya. But the claims
"lack a historical consciousness and misunderstand the mass of 19th-century
missionary work," Shaw told NIRR. Shaw, the missionary scholar in residence at
the Billy Graham Center at Wheaton College, is writing The Kingdom of God in
Africa. It argues that Christianity is an authentic African religion with roots
dating to the second century in Egypt and the fourth century in Ethiopia. Many
Western missionaries who evangelized Africa were freed slaves and Caribbean
blacks who returned to spread the gospel, the book notes.

Challenging evangelicals with a "radical Christian social ethic" is the task
of Evangelical Contribution on Northern Ireland (11/14/94). Through literature,
conferences, and traveling "roadshows," ECONI encourages evangelicals to
renounce "ethnic tribal nationality" and embrace the principles of peace, reconciliation, and forgiveness, Development Officer David Porter told NIRR. The
group's slogan, "For God and His Glory Alone," is a direct challenge to those
Christians whose slogan "For God and Ulster" reflects the church's "besetting
sin" of identifying God along ethnic and national lines, Porter said.
<BR>...The group hosts an annual conference, which last year featured scholar
John Stott speaking on Christian citizenship, and encourages participation in a
yearly ECONI Sunday to reflect on the country's situation.

It's possible for a church to grow too large, superchurch pastor John
Bisagno told a Southern Baptist church-growth conference. Bisagno, who
preaches to 5,000 on Sunday mornings at First Baptist Church, Houston, said that
over the past few years his church has asked about 450 members to leave and
start new churches or revitalize struggling inner-city congregations. The 40
groups they helped nurture now have a Sunday school attendance of 3,000, he
said.

A center for studying the spiritual needs of the elderly has opened in St.
Paul, Minn. The Center for Aging, Religion, and Spirituality is located at Luther
Seminary, an Evangelical Lutheran Church in America school. The interfaith,
interdisciplinary center grew out of research funded by a Lilly Endowment grant.
Center Director Mel Kimball edited Aging, Spirituality, and Religion: A Handbook. The book compiles the insights of 50 authors on pastoral care, congregational life, community outreach, theological assumptions about psychology, and
aging. The center will hold a Geriatric Pastoral Care Institute July 17-28. For
information, call the center at (612) 641-3581.

Charities cannot fill the gap that substantial cuts in federal funding of
social programs would create, 116 charitable organizations said in a statement.
The groups said spending by charities on social programs is only a fraction of
government funding, and that charities cannot replace major lost federal revenues
while meeting new needs, Independent Sector reported. Higher fees and dues will
put charitable services beyond the reach of those they are supposed to serve, the
groups said. Signers include the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the
National Council of Churches, the United Church of Christ's Office for Church
in Society, and several Catholic and Jewish groups.

All Americans give to charities at roughly the same rate -- about 2.5%,

the poor give more of their money than do wealthier Americans.

Discipleship groups on a college campus in British Columbia, Canada,
have doubled in size each year for the last three years. Some 600 students meet
weekly in groups of four to eight at Trinity Western University, said Sue
Moomjean. She is director of campus ministries at the Evangelical Free Church
school in Langley, B.C. Members of Generation X crave a sense of community
because their home lives have been so disruptive, Moomjean told NIRR. Students often feel they're not heard at home or even in church, she said. "Where
else can they go but to their peers?" Some Trinity students also meet nightly at
the school to pray for revival, she said.

Resurrection, the annual United Methodist youth retreat, drew 7,350 teens
and counselors to Gatlinburg, Tenn., to hear preaching and contemporary Christian music. The event has become a wintertime ritual for UMC youth, growing
steadily since drawing 700 youths in 1984. The number of students who dedicated their lives to Christ and answer the call to the ministry during Resurrection
has increased over the years, Steve Blakemore, organizer of the event, told
United Methodist News.

Only half of the Southern Baptist Convention's 15 million members "contributed financially or attended at least one service last year," according to
Thomas Ascol. The pastor of a Baptist church in Coral Gables, Fla., Ascol also
edits The Founders Journal, published by a loosely knit group of Calvinists in
the SBC. He made his claim in a special issue that will be mailed to SBC
pastors, missionaries, seminary professors, and other leaders.
<BR>...One reason for the SBC's apparent growth is a high percentage of nonresident and inactive members, many of whom are not really Christians, he
wrote. He blames the influx of alleged non-Christians on "modern evangelistic
technique...geared toward getting a sinner to agree with some facts and recite a
prayer." He and other Journal writers urged the SBC to stress such doctrines as
election, the sovereignty of God, and the inability of people to repent and
exercise faith unless God first regenerates them. Ascol said numerical growth is
not necessarily a sign of spiritual vitality.

Toward a Theology of Mission and Evangelism for a New Century, a
conference of United Methodists, brought together missions and evangelism
professors, missions agency directors, and church leaders to clarify the role of
missions. It was called the most inclusive UMC missions meeting in 40 years.
<BR>...The meeting provided a forum for discussion among missions theorists
and practitioners, Thomas Thangaraj of Candler School of Theology at Emory
University said. "We were trying to avoid the twin dangers of having an unreflective missions policy and an `ivory tower' missions agency," he said.
<BR>...At the heart of the discussion was a division of thought between those
who emphasize acts of charity and those who say that the verbal proclamation of
the gospel is primary. Although the question went unresolved, all participants
agreed that the purpose of missions is to proclaim Jesus Christ as Savior.

Defying the church's official teaching, the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, D.C., declared that homosexuals who live together in monogamous
relationships should be "honored." The statement was adopted 134-32 at the
annual diocesan convention last month. It was drafted by Newark, N.J., bishop
John Spong last fall in response to a statement issued by theologically conservative bishops at the Episcopal Church's General Convention (NIRR 9/19/94). The
conservatives upheld the denomination's teaching that homosexual practice is
wrong, and rejected the concept of homosexual marriage. The Washington
diocese is the first to take an opposite stand.
<BR>...Denominational leaders said that although a number of bishops are
permissive on the issue of ordaining practicing homosexuals, an official blessing
of same-sex unions is nowhere in sight.

A book criticizing modern seminary education has raised controversy in
the United Methodist Church. Thomas Oden (NIRR 5/16/94), a professor at
Drew Theological School in Madison, Wis., and organizer of a movement of
traditionalists and moderates within the UMC, wrote Requiem: A Lament in
Three Movements. The book depicts seminary faculties as unconcerned about the
core of the Christian faith or interested only in their own careers, United Methodist News Service said. The book is "grossly unfair," according to Neal Fisher,
president of UMC-related Garrett Evangelical Theological Seminary in Evanston,
Ill. Executives of Abingdon Press, the book division of the United Methodist
Publishing House, said two books will be released soon reflecting other viewpoints on theological education.

Members of the Kansas House of Representatives are upset with their
new chaplain. They say Baptist minister Cecil Washington is being insensitive to
non-Christians with daily prayers that always mention Jesus. A Jewish member
said Washington should step down if he is unwilling to change. The chaplain
said God told him not to back away. Washington said he is sensitive to others,
but asked, "at what point should my sensitivity move me to deny Christ?"

Mormon Church-owned Brigham Young University's single-sex off-campus
housing policies do not violate federal law, a federal judge ruled in a lawsuit
filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. The group sued nine Utah County
landlords on behalf of two non-students, a man and a woman, who had been
turned away as prospective renters. The pair were rejected because they didn't
comply with policies that BYU requires of all certified off-campus housing.

The government of Lithuania agreed to review a draft law that discriminates against religious organizations that are not officially recognized. The
proposed law would have required newly created churches to apply for recognition to a committee consisting of "scientists, cultural workers, and community
members," Rutherford Institute International Coordinator Pedro Moreno told
NIRR. Those denied would be banned from receiving state funding for educational activities and the mass media, and would be required to wait 25 years to
reapply. Moreno represented Word of Faith Bible Church in an appeal before the
European Commission on Human Rights.

The accreditation committee of the Association of Theological Schools
placed Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary on probation for two years,
SBTS President Ken Hemphill (NIRR 8/8/94) announced. Committee members
cited matters related to personnel policies and academic freedom. The action
came in the aftermath of turmoil leading to the firing by conservative trustees of
President Russell Dilday last March. Fort Worth-based Southwestern is the
largest of six Southern Baptist seminaries. Hemphill said the school will appeal.
<BR>...Paige Patterson, president of Southeastern Seminary, Wake Forest,
N.C., charged in a newspaper interview that the ATS is biased against schools
that require professors to sign doctrinal statements. And Albert Mohler, president
of Southern Seminary in Louisville, Ky., said the ATS action "appears to be
rooted in a context of retribution." ATS officials said their ruling had nothing to
do with doctrine but with "appropriate governance" of a theological school.

The more multicultural the church becomes, the more "eloquent is its
testimony to the reconciling love of Christ," John Stott said. The Anglican
theologian spoke during the annual Congress of the Evangelistic Association of
New England. The convention drew 6,600 people to Boston under blizzard
conditions Feb. 3-4.

The primacy of expository preaching was the theme at the annual Bethlehem Conference for Pastors, held Jan. 30-Feb. 1 in Minneapolis. The interdenominational event, sponsored by Bethlehem Baptist Church, drew 250 pastors,
elders, and denominational leaders. Donald Carson, professor of New Testament
at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, encouraged pastors to resist pressures to
make preaching primarily psychological or topical. The most important thing
pastors can give congregations is the Word of God, he said. "Other things are
very important, but they must come out of an expository setting," Jon Bloom,
conference coordinator, said. For information, call (612) 338-7653.

"Spiritual mapping" is under way in more than 300 communities in North
America, according to The Sentinel Group of Lynnwood, Wash. Mappers
compile information about spiritual, demographic, and socio-economic influences
on their communities.
<BR>...The influences may be harmful, such as alternative religions and "social
bondage sites" like gambling casinos. Others are beneficial, including the
location of Christian organizations. The result is a portrait of the spiritual dynamics at work in a local community "that you may not see without mapping,"
said Mike McCausland, Sentinel Group vice president. The information, which
can be combined with mappings from adjacent communities, helps churches
develop prayer and evangelism strategies, he said.

Ads in college newspapers for human egg donors are raising ethical
questions. Infertile couples looking for eggs recently have published pleas at
Yale, Columbia, and other Ivy League schools, USA Today reported. The ads
offer $2,000-$5,000 for the eggs of healthy, attractive women of a specified age,
race, and height. Ads also have run in papers at the University of Chicago and
the University of California at Los Angeles. Ethicists say students may be
thinking more about paying college bills than producing children. The procedure
for donating eggs involves several injections of potent fertility drugs to enhance
ovulation. The health risk is uncertain, the publication said.

Christian Coalition Executive Director Ralph Reed warned the GOP that
evangelicals and pro-life Catholics will abandon the party if it nominates a
candidate for president or vice president who supports abortion rights. Addressing a Conservative Political Action Committee conference in Washington, Reed
said exit polls showed that one-third of voters in the last election were evangelicals and pro-life Catholics. They voted 69% Republican, he said. A number of
Republican leaders, including pro-life Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, a potential
presidential candidate, and former Vice President Dan Quayle, told interviewers
that it would be wrong to subject candidates to single-issue litmus tests.
<BR>...Gramm said the National Republican Senatorial Committee donated
$175,000 to the National Right to Life Committee in the closing days of last
fall's campaign. Confirming a Washington Post report, Gramm and NRLC
leaders said the group used the money for voter education and turnout efforts,
not for promoting individual candidates, which is illegal.
<BR>...Gary Bauer, who heads D.C.-based Family Research Council, told
reporters that he and James Dobson, head of Focus on the Family, had met
recently with GOP officials. Bauer said they warned the leaders that if they want
to continue getting the pro-family and pro-life vote, they must stop being hesitant
about making the case for family values.

Calling the Corporation for Public Broadcasting unnecessary and its
programming anti-Christian, the 818 voting members of National Religious
Broadcasters called on Congress to cut its funding. Passed at the NRB's 52nd
Annual Conference and Exposition in Nashville Feb. 11-14, the resolution says
the need for educational and cultural programming is being met by an increase in
new channels and frequencies. The resolution also recommends defunding the
Public Broadcasting System and National Public Radio, "...allow[ing] them to be
totally privatized and enter the real world of the marketplace." The NRB also
passed resolutions opposing new fees on radio and television broadcasters and
commending Congress for killing reinstatement of the Fairness Doctrine.
<BR>...More than 3,000 people attended the four-day event, which began with
country music's Ricky Skaggs and keynote speaker Adrian Rogers of Bellevue
Baptist Church in Memphis. Rogers, former president of the Southern Baptist

Unchanging Message in a Changing World. Other speakers included Shirley
Dobson and Bible teacher John DeBrine.
<BR>...For the second year in a row, President Clinton was not invited. Citing

Madonna and Michael Jackson are terrorists just as much as people who set

the pair should be brought to Pakistan for trial. The pop artists "are the torch
bearers of American society, [its] cultural and social values," spokesman
Nematullah Khan said. They "are ruining the lives of thousands of Muslims and
leading them to destruction, away from their religion, ethics, and morality." The
demand appeared to be in response to the extradition of Ramzi Yousef, a suspect
in the World Trade Center bombing in New York.

Many people give money to liberal and conservative groups with conflicting agendas, according to a Barna Research Group poll. Barna found that 10% of
contributors to the National Organization for Women also gave or would consider giving to the Christian Coalition, The Chronicle of Philanthropy reported.
Also, 18% of Christian Coalition donors supported or would consider contributing to Planned Parenthood. Nonprofit groups said some donors give to groups
they oppose as a way of obtaining materials and keeping abreast of their tactics.
Russ Reid, whose company released the findings, said few donors embrace the
entire agenda of any nonprofit group. He advised fund-raisers to learn which
aspects of their groups' missions appeal to which donors.

A 14-year-old Christian and a 44-year-old man were found guilty of blasphemy by a Pakistani court and sentenced to hang. Witnesses claimed the pair wrote
anti-Islamic slogans in chalk on a mosque wall in 1993, a charge the two denied
(NIRR 4/18/94). A third defendant was gunned down outside a courtroom in
Lahore last April. Church leaders claim Muslims are using the blasphemy laws
and false testimony to settle personal enmities. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto

Members of the Lesbian Avengers dumped hundreds of live crickets in
the office of Exodus International Feb. 8. The San Rafael, Calif., ministry urges
homosexuals and lesbians to leave a lifestyle it considers sinful. The dozen
women chanted slogans condemning Exodus and held signs that urged God to
send a plague on the ministry. Several members of the Bay Area Times, a
newspaper for the homosexual community, were there to take photos. Bob

Some 3,400 government, military, and business leaders from 170 countries
and 50 states gathered in Washington, D.C., for the annual National Prayer
Breakfast. Main speaker Andrew Young -- the former congressman, Atlanta
mayor, and United Nations ambassador -- emphasized that suffering binds people
to each other and to God in troubled times. President Clinton called for more
civility and less destructiveness in public debate. Supreme Court Justice Ruth
Ginzberg read passages from Deuteronomy in which God condemns bribery and
dishonesty, and calls for justice to be done. In the morning's main prayer, Gov.
John Engler, (R-Mich.), asked God to "send the Holy Spirit on our leaders." He
also asked for forgiveness of "our sins against the born and the unborn." It was
the only remark during the event that smacked of controversy, reminiscent of
Mother Teresa's denunciation of abortion at last year's breakfast. Billy Graham
spoke at several NPB meetings, including a banquet for internationals, a Prison
Fellowship event, and a dinner for 175 media people hosted by columnist Cal
Thomas. Half of the media people were non-Christians, Thomas noted.
<BR>...The breakfast is sponsored by the weekly House and Senate prayer breakfast groups. Its organizers are evangelistic members of a low-profile group
known as The Fellowship led by Doug Coe, a former Navigators missionary.
They packed two days of seminars and other meetings around the breakfast.                          
<BR>...Protestant and Catholic Church leaders from North Korea attended the
breakfast at the invitation of Graham, who visited their country last year (NIRR
2/7/94). The head of the delegation, the chairman of the Korean Catholics Association, later met with Clinton. It was the first time a delegation of North Korean
Catholics visited the United States and the first time a North Korean met with a
sitting president, John Akers, Graham's special assistant, told NIRR. The delegation stayed for 10 days, visiting with Graham in his North Carolina home and
touring several cities.
<BR>...After the breakfast, Clinton met for half an hour in the Oval Office with
eight religion writers. Apparently chafing from criticism in much of the media,
Clinton lamented the "inordinate premium" placed on "words that destroy." He
said he increasingly has less control over his reputation, but he has full control
over "my character." And, he added, "That's between me and God." He lashed
out at the Christian Coalition, calling it an arm of the GOP that is exploiting
Christians disturbed about what is happening in society.

The story of Abraham and Isaac gave Air Force Lt. Col. Mike Couillard,
trapped with his son, Matthew, in a blizzard in the Turkish mountains, courage to
leave him to find help. The father and son, who were skiing when the blizzard
hit, constantly prayed in a cave that sheltered them for seven days, Couillard's
mother, Cecille, told NIRR. Mike's decision to leave the cave came as he prayed
and looked to the stars. "God spoke to him about Genesis 22 and told him He
keeps His promises," Cecille said. "He felt he was leaving him in God's hands."
Before he left his son, Couillard, a Catholic, told Matthew what could happen
and explained to him what heaven looked like. Couillard eventually made it to a
village, where he collapsed. Villagers rescued the boy.
<BR>...In Lisbon, Maine, the Couillard family and in-laws gathered daily to pray
for Mike and Matthew. Praying the night before they were found, Cecille said
she felt as if "someone was hugging me and telling me they would be OK."
About 150 people attended a mass of thanksgiving at Holy Trinity Parish Church
after news of the rescue.

<A NAME="CAMPOLO,OTHERSCRITICIZEFALWELL"><H3>CAMPOLO, OTHERS CRITICIZE FALWELL FOR SELLING ANTI-CLINTON VIDEOTAPES</H3></A>
<P>
Prominent evangelicals criticized Jerry Falwell for selling videotapes that
raise serious allegations against President Clinton. The tapes, Clinton's Circle of
Power and The Clinton Chronicles, depict Clinton, who was then governor of
Arkansas, as a womanizer using government money to pay for affairs, a cocaine
user and part of a drug-smuggling operation, and the person responsible for
several mysterious deaths. Hillary Clinton is accused of having sex with Vince
Foster, a Clinton friend and White House aide who, officials say, committed
suicide. The tapes were produced by California-based Citizens For Honest
Government. Falwell sold about 40,000 of them, at $40 for the set of two, during
broadcasts of The Old Time Gospel Hour last spring and summer. About 60,000
copies have been marketed by other groups.
<BR>...Until now, evangelical leaders and broadcasters remained largely silent
about the tapes. But Tony Campolo, a sociology professor at American Baptistrelated Eastern College who is a personal friend of the president, last month
demanded time on Falwell's show to rebut them. In a letter, Campolo told
Falwell he was stepping in to defend Clinton because it is inappropriate "for
someone in his position" to do so himself. Campolo, who preaches in evangelical
and mainline circles, said Falwell preaches the gospel effectively, but confuses it
with conservative politics, and that "is not good for the church of Jesus Christ."
<BR>...But Falwell refused to allow Campolo on his show. "The President has at
his disposal the greatest amount of free media in the world," Falwell spokesman
Mark DeMoss told NIRR. "It is a little stretch to say he doesn't have the forum"
to respond to the tapes. Opening the show to anyone who demands time would
be inappropriate, DeMoss said. "We wouldn't ask for time in his (Campolo's)
classroom to challenge things he said." DeMoss said Falwell is willing to talk to
Clinton or any of his staff about the tapes.
<BR>...Other leaders have criticized the tapes. E. Brandt Gustavson, president of
the National Religious Broadcasters, told The Washington Post the tapes have
"no place in religious broadcasting." David Neff, executive editor of Christianity
Today, said someone should "independently speak to the allegations."

Several Evangelical Free churches are showing compassion to traumatized pastors who have left their ministries. Each of the nine congregations
commits itself to work with an EFCA pastor who may be burned out, depressed,
fired, or shamed by personal sin. The care, which also is available to missionaries and other EFCA Christian workers and their families, lasts as long as necessary for the pastor to recover and become productive.
<BR>...A "befriending team" helps find temporary employment and housing for
the pastor and his family. Some recovery churches build a house for their guests,
use a parsonage, or allocate rent money in the church budget. The team also
provides spiritual, psychological, vocational, and financial counseling.
<BR>...The local church is "exactly the kind of context in which healing can
take place," said John Herman, executive director of the EFCA Ministerial
Association. Pastors get time to rest, relax, and "not be dealing with pastoral
pressures at the same time." Recovery Churches have helped several pastoral
families return to ministry or make the transition to other careers, he said. For

a house church. Today the church has 17,000 members and is growing by 200 a

building a sanctuary closer to a higher-crime area "because they thought it was

Though unanticipated obstacles have led the CoMission (NIRR 7/25/94)
to reduce its numerical goals, "we are doing exactly the strategy we wanted to,"
Director of Communication Ivey Harrington told NIRR. Since many regions of

Fort Mill, S.C.-based group has reduced its original goal of placing 12,000
educators in the 120 administrative school districts there. The CoMission's
strategy of teaching morality and ethics to teachers is having success, however,
according to Chief of Staff King Crow. At the invitation of government officials,
CoMission leaders were asked to share their ethics-and-morality curriculum with

Forty-five leaders representing most of Rwanda's Protestant denominations

be reunited, according to Reg Reimer of World Evangelical Fellowship, who
facilitated the meeting. Although time and logistical problems prevented the
participation of Catholic leaders, organizers intend to include them in future
events, Reimer added.
<BR>...Stressing that reconciliation begins with telling the truth, one pastor said
the leaders must confront the fact that "people who took communion on Sunday
were killing other Christians." Another acknowledged the need to accept responsibility for the sins of their flocks. One Episcopal bishop confessed his bitterness
and anger, leading another minister to repent of his sins against the bishop. The
pastors, most of whom are in refugee camps in Zaire, Tanzania, or Kenya,
promised to urge the country's leaders to repent, to take the message of reconciliation back to their people, and to foster communication among disparate refugee
groups. Despite these hopeful signs, it is still too early to expect dramatic

Evangelical leaders and theologians resolved differences over Evangelicals and Catholics Together (NIRR 4/4/94), the statement of Catholic-Protestant cooperation issued last spring. The group was called together last month by

is central to the gospel. A statement signed by Bright, Colson, Kent Hill, and

Catholic doctrinal distinctives or endorsement of the Roman Catholic Church
system." The signers said they rejected proselytizing for denominational aggrandizement, but affirmed that "evangelism and church planting are always legitimate, whatever forms of church life are present already." The document is being

Church members are giving a smaller portion of their income to churches,
but are going into debt to purchase more luxury items, according to a Lilly
Endowment-funded annual report on church contributions. The report, by
researchers John and Sylvia Ronsvalle of empty tomb, inc. (NIRR 1/24/94),
covers giving patterns in 29 U.S. denominations from 1958 through 1992.
Overall, church members gave 2.52% of their income to churches in 1992, down
from 3.14% in 1958. Hardest hit: missionary and other benevolent causes outside
the local church. Viewed in 1987 constant dollars, support for such causes has
decreased 1.8% in the past 25 years, compared to a 24% increase in support for
local church needs. Congregational funding for 600 Protestant missionary-sending
agencies in the United States has remained flat since 1987, at about $2 billion,
the study said. In comparison, it noted that Americans spend $4 billion annually
on craft sales, $32 billion on diet programs, and $40 billion on leisure travel.
<BR>...There are three reasons for the findings, the Ronsvalles said. First, church
members express confusion about the purpose of denominational structures.
Second, the exodus of women into the work force left few volunteers to promote
missions and stewardship. Last, members have formed attitudes toward money
that are unconnected to their church or faith.

World Orthodoxy's top overseer, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew,
rejected a plan to forge greater unity among Orthodox denominations in America.
He ordered the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America to
abandon the plan, calling it a bid for independence from his office, according to
news accounts. After a closed-door emergency session, U.S. Greek Orthodox
bishops appealed to Bartholomew for understanding. A spokesman said the
bishops hope the matter can be resolved at the next meeting of the international
Orthodox community. Analysts blamed the flap on a publicity campaign by
traditionalists who oppose reform and efforts to modernize the church.

Relationships between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Vatican
improved significantly within the past year, according to Orthodox and Catholic
officials. They credit a Vatican plan to fund needy priests working in Russia.
The plan calls for helping 60 Catholic priests and 6,000 Orthodox priests with
about $1,000 a year (NIRR 5/30/94). Under the plan, Orthodox bishops determine who among their priests will receive the assistance. So far, about $3.4
million has been raised, and the first 280 priests began receiving aid last June.

Seventeen evangelical Christians have been arrested in Nepal since September 1994. The latest arrest occurred shortly before Christmas when police in
Bhojpur arrested and charged six Christians with proselytizing, which is illegal in
the predominantly Hindu country located between Tibetan China and India. The
men were arrested after complaints to police about Christian evangelical activities, Simon Pandi of the National Churches Fellowship of Nepal told News
Network International. Eleven other Christians will be tried for proselytizing and
could be sentenced to three years in prison if found guilty. Nepal is the world's
only Hindu kingdom, and Hinduism is the state religion.

A proposed new law introduced in the Russian parliament contains
restrictions that would limit foreign religious influence, Baptist Press reported. It
would require foreign religious workers to show an official invitation from
Russian counterparts. It also would require them to meet certain accreditation
standards. And it could affect some who travel to Russia from the West on
tourist visas and engage in religious work. The law specifically seeks to curtail
the activity of Western evangelicals who developed campaigns to teach Christian
values in public schools following the collapse of communism, religious freedom
experts in Moscow told BP. Parliament two years ago passed a Russian Orthodox-backed bill aimed at curtailing evangelical activities, but Russian President
Boris Yeltsin twice refused to sign it into law.

New changes in tax law make it more likely that ministers will have to file
income taxes as employees rather than as self-employed individuals, said tax
expert Richard Hammar of Springfield, Mo. If a church provides a Form W-2,
and the pastor reports that income on Line 7 of Form 1040 this year, then he or
she likely is filing correctly as an employee, he said. Most pastors have a "dual
status" when filing their returns. They are self-employed for Social Security
purposes, and pay their own FICA tax. But they also are employees for income
tax purposes, though their taxes are not withheld from paychecks, and they must
pay taxes quarterly. Also, they are eligible for tax breaks such as a housing
allowance. Special offerings and both congregational and designated individual
cash gifts to a minister should be reported on the W-2, Hammar said. Ministers
are in a category slated for special attention and audits this year, he added.
<BR>...A recent Tax Court ruling applies a sevenfold test in determining whether
the pastor is an employee. Among them: the church has the right to determine
how a minister performs work for the church; the church provides or pays for his
or her office; and the church has the right to discharge the worker.
<BR>...Self-employed people can deduct unreimbursed business expenses on
Schedule C or A, and ministers often take advantage of this provision, Hammar
says. But, he suggests, they should adopt an accountable reimbursement plan
with the church instead.

Christian youth in 24 states have distributed The Book of Hope -- a hiplooking book of Scriptures -- to their classmates in public schools. More than
12% of junior and senior high school students in Arkansas and 26% in Montana

student-initiated and student-led extracurricular Christian clubs so students can
distribute literature. For information, call 1-800-328-4673.

Reactions have varied to the ecumenical youth conference "Celebrate:
Gathering at the Crossroads." The event drew 1,807 students from eight mainline
denominations and a Catholic student group to St. Louis Dec. 28-Jan. 1. Conservative critics said that student participants were urged to abandon traditional
beliefs and embrace a radical theological and political agenda. The event was "a
celebration of neo-pagan silliness and intemperate politics," spokesman Mark
Tooley of The Institute on Religion and Democracy, a conservative think tank in
Washington, D.C., told Religion News Service.
<BR>...Critics were trying to force a narrow theological perspective on the
UMC, said Tom McAnally, director of United Methodist News Service. "Our
church is just not going to buy into" that kind of perspective, McAnally said.
"It's just too diverse."

"The bombers and assassins are not part of our movement," Rep. Robert
Dornan (R-Calif.) told thousands of cheering pro-life demonstrators on the White
House Ellipse. The gathering was part of the annual March for Life to protest the
Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision. Police estimated that 40,000 took part.
Organizer Nellie Gray rejected calls by abortion-rights leaders for pro-lifers to
tone down opposition to abortion. "The babies need us," she said. Dornan and
other members of Congress pledged to eliminate federal funding of abortions.
<BR>...Operation Rescue leaders said they will mount a national campaign to
press for repeal of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which was
signed by President Clinton last May. The effort will include protests at clinics
across the country, the group said. The Justice Department filed a civil damages
suit under FACE against four pro-life demonstrators in Fargo, N.D. They were
accused of harassing people at a Fargo clinic and violating local court orders.
<BR>...Four D.C.-area Bible-carrying demonstrators accused the Justice Department of having a double standard. They said federal agents failed to probe
complaints about an incident in which a man allegedly pointed a handgun at
them in front of an area clinic.

Planned Parenthood intends to raise $750 million in order to build 1,000

contends. Citing an article in the Santa Barbara News Press, STOPP says this

Less than 1% of fetal tissue from miscarriages and tubal pregnancies can

to harvesting fetal tissue from abortions.

Organizers of an international conference against pornography called for
tough action to stop the abuse of children by pedophiles from the United States
and Europe. Some 160 participants from 30 nations and various faiths, including
dozens of Christian denominations, gathered in Manila last month to discuss
ways to crack down on what they say is a global network of pornographers. 
<BR>...The technology of pornography is changing rapidly, the leaders said. The
worldwide computer network known as the Internet is "filled with hard-core
pornography," Deen Kaplan of the Religious Alliance Against Pornography said.
The end of the Cold War and liberalization of trade with the West brought
pornography into newly free countries, religious leaders from Russia, Eastern
Europe, and parts of Africa said. "Sex tourism" also has become commonplace in
10 countries in Asia, leaders said. Pedophiles molest large numbers of children
during long trips in Asia and sometimes record their acts on film or video.

The American Psychiatric Association no longer identifies pedophilia -sexual desire in an adult for a child -- as a psychiatric disorder, the American
Family Association said. The APA said pedophilia should be diagnosed merely
as a drive seeking to be fulfilled. Identical changes for diagnosing sexual sadism,
masochism, transvestitism, voyeurism, and exhibitionism were made in the
group's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.
<BR>...The American Medical Association stopped recommending efforts to
turn unhappy homosexuals into heterosexuals. Reversing policy, the group called
for "nonjudgmental recognition of sexual orientation by physicians."

New Senate Chaplain Lloyd Ogilvie told reporters he will adhere to the
pastoral priorities set by his predecessor. Ogilvie, 64, pastor of 4,500-member
First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood, Calif., for the past 22 years, was elected
to the $115,700-a-year post by unanimous consent of the Senate last month. He
succeeds Richard Halverson, 79, who retired Feb. 5. Halverson, who ministered
to the senators, their families, and staff in addition to opening daily Senate
sessions with a two-minute prayer, "has set the benchmark" for future chaplains,
Ogilvie said. Although the post is for a two-year term, incumbents routinely are
re-elected until retirement. Early in his ministry, Halverson had been an assistant
pastor at the same Hollywood church. Ogilvie, a broadcaster and author of 45
books, said he will shut down his radio and TV ministry around Easter. James
Ford, the House chaplain, was re-elected last month.
<BR>...Ogilvie and his church were sued last month by a former member of his
congregation. Elisabeth Saret claims she became pregnant during an affair with a
church elder who worked in the same law firm where she had worked. Her suit
charges that Ogilvie talked her out of an abortion, then refused to counsel her
further after she tried to kill herself. The minister told The Associated Press he
had counseled her regarding her pregnancy, but denied having known she had
tried to commit suicide. Had he known, he said, he would have referred her to
one of the church's trained professional counselors or its counseling center.

"I am not O.J.'s judge. God is," Rosey Grier told interviewers. Grier, the
former Los Angeles Rams star, is now a minister and serves as O.J. Simpson's
spiritual advisor. He said fame and riches caused Simpson to turn his back on
God years ago. But, he added, Simpson recently came back to God while in jail
awaiting his murder trial. In response to a TV reporter's question, Grier said that
as a minister he would keep his counselee's confidence, even if "an injustice"
had been disclosed. Grier added that if he were ordered to testify in court, there
would be "no jeopardy there [for Simpson]."
<BR>...Grier played a key role in uniting the divided Simpson defense team on
the eve of the trial, according to news accounts. Defense attorney Johnnie
Cochran, Jr., a longtime member and deacon of a Baptist church, assembled the
defense team in a room at the L.A. County courthouse, Time reported. Grier
presided over the session and turned it into a "very emotional" prayer meeting,
reporter Elizabeth Gleick said in a TV interview.
<BR>...Differences between the lawyers were set aside, and they reaffirmed their
commitment to Simpson, she said. Cochran said he asked Grier to lead prayer
meetings with the defense attorneys several times a week during the trial.

Television evangelist Jack Van Impe is distancing himself from a rumor
that United Nations forces are conspiring to invade the United States. Stories
published by Newhouse News Service and other news services blamed Van Impe
for starting a rumor that 50,000 foreign troops are being concealed in national
parks and underground cities throughout the United States. U.S. military spokesmen said the rumor is untrue.
<BR>...Van Impe "didn't say they're getting ready to invade." He merely was
passing along some information that had been given to his Rochester Hills,
Mich., ministry from other publications, John Lang, Van Impe's executive
director, told NIRR.
<BR>...One publication Lang cited is Relevance, published by Relevance Corporation of Birmingham, Mich. The publication's October 1994 edition describes "the
One World Movement's master plan," which is described as a conspiracy to
move American military forces out of the country and those of foreign nations
into the United States. A published story by Dave Helms of the Mobile Press
Register said invasion rumors were fueled by "informal militia groups springing
up around the country."

<P>
One hundred seventy of the nation's white and black evangelical leaders
held a long-awaited Convention on Reconciliation (NIRR 3/21/94) in Chicago
Jan. 6-7. Denominational heads, parachurch leaders, and college and seminary
presidents from across the country proposed ideas to rid the church of "the sin of
racism," according to Billy Melvin, executive director of the National Association of Evangelicals, which is predominantly white. 
<BR>..."I sensed a powerful move of God, that significant steps were taken
toward real repentance and reconciliation," said Bishop George McKinney of the
Church of God in Christ, a predominantly black denomination. Divisions between evangelicals have been "a blight" on the witness of the church. "We came
together to repent of that," McKinney told NIRR. Evangelical leaders recognize
that the church "has been negligent in pursuing justice" and in "telling the truth
regarding human relations and the will of God," he said. Relations between the
races have been "dictated more by the world than by Scripture."   
<BR>..."The motives are good and we are going to do the right thing now,"
McKinney said. He described a working committee set up to evaluate and
implement ideas suggested by the leaders as a "necessary step." Deeply held
practices "don't just go away. It will be painful and there will be some resistance. God is at work and He will make the crooked straight and the rough
places plain."
<BR>...Leaders of the NAE and the National Black Evangelical Association,
which split from the NAE in 1950 (NIRR 3/21/94), have talked seriously for a
year about racial reconciliation. The willing attitude of white leaders "is the most
significant hope for anything substantive happening," Lloyd Lindo, NBEA
president, told NIRR. Lindo said he is trusting the white leaders in the NAE,
who have shown "obvious readiness" to confront racism. "Revival will not
happen, in spite of tons of prayers, until racism is expunged and reconciliation is
born," Lindo said.

A former drug trafficker, extortionist, and gang leader now preaches the
gospel in the notorious Golden Triangle in Asia. David Yong Mo and his group
of evangelists, the Young Crusaders, draw 15,000-20,000 people to weekly openair crusades in east-central Myanmar (formerly Burma), located near Thailand
and Laos. Poppy fields dot the area, through which much of the world's heroin is
transported. Mo, 50, turned to Christ while near death after shooting heroin with
unclean needles. He is joined on the crusades by a rock band composed of
Christians who are former addicts.
<BR>...Mo's crusades apparently are unique in Myanmar, an isolated Buddhist
nation run by a repressive military junta. His group routinely is granted permits
to hold crusades because of the effectiveness of its drug-rehabilitation program in
the capital, Yangon. The residential school, which treats about 150 addicts,
combines counseling, Bible study, and vocational training, and has an 80% cure
rate. While recovering, many of the addicts suffer no withdrawal pangs because
of the power of prayer, Mo told NIRR. His facility has drawn the admiration and
curiosity of the World Health Organization and U.S. Department of State. But
Mo, who is supported by Advancing Native Missions of Charlottesville, Va., has
declined offers of financial aid from government groups because there are
"strings attached" that would compromise the gospel message, he said. Mo also
operates a home for abandoned and orphaned children and two leper colonies.

Evangelism opportunities are growing in India, according to an Assemblies

1990, membership doubled to 259,427 believers. The official, who wished to
remain anonymous, has 20 years of missionary experience in southern Asia. He
said growth is due to the emergence of India's 300-million-strong middle class.
This group is breaking away from traditional superstitions and religions and
embracing Christianity, the official said. 
<BR>...The greatest opportunities still lie ahead, the official said. With the sixthlargest economy in the world, India is ripe for economic expansion and development. Many schools and hospitals are operated by Christians, and the faith is
considered a positive, compassionate social force. Citing limited effectiveness of

"Please stop endangering Chinese Christians" by smuggling Bibles illegally into the country, Bao Jiayuan pleaded in a report published by Ecumenical News International. "Let us work together to help them instead," he appealed. Bao is the newly elected associate general secretary of the China Christian Council (CCC), the official Protestant church body in China (NIRR
12/26/94). Bibles smuggled to rural areas are subject to confiscation and their
recipients to arrest, he warned. He agreed that the 2.2 million Bibles published
annually by Amity Press in Nanjing are inadequate to meet demands. He said
production is expected to reach 4 million a year eventually. 
<BR>...Mark Szanderna of the Hong Kong-based Revival Christian Church,

The war-engulfed region of Chechnya, which straddles the 10/40 Window of

Christian churches or missionaries are located there, AD 2000 and Beyond's
David Hargrove told NIRR. At this time, there is no Chechen translation of the
Scriptures, according to Wycliffe Bible Translators.  
<BR>...The war for independence will create an opportunity for Christian relief
and missions groups to assist survivors and spread the gospel, George Law, vice
president of Wheaton, Ill.-based Russian Ministries, told NIRR. Speaking from
Moscow, Law cited a similar occurrence in the Russian Republic of Georgia,
where Christian missionaries helped restore the shattered lives and homes of
people there, resulting in a greater openness to the gospel. Despite horrible
destruction, the war could have positive results as "people become more aware
that the Chechens exist" and their Muslim worldview is challenged, Law said.
<BR>...More than 250 Jewish residents of Chechnya fled during the fighting.
Many left for neighboring countries and were airlifted to Israel, the official
Jewish immigration agency announced. It had lost contact with 12 Jewish
families still in Grozny during this month's assault by Russian troops, it said.

There is a growing evangelical Christian community among the Saraguro
Indians who live on the eastern slopes of the Andes mountains in southern
Ecuador. OMS International missionary Dean Davis told NIRR that there are
about 500 evangelicals among the Saraguros' 30,000 population and that he
recently oversaw the founding of five small evangelical congregations. The seed
was planted among the Saraguros, descendants of the Incas, during a deadly
cholera outbreak in 1992. Saraguro Christians and believers from other tribes
cared for the sick and dying, taught preventive measures, and "shared the
message of eternal life in Christ," Davis said, which broke down barriers of
suspicion and laid the foundations for trust and friendship. 
<BR>...The Saraguro Christians are making social advances as well. A radio
station, the only one in the region, is being built. It will employ Christians and
feature some Christian programming. Also, the Ecuadorian government has
recognized the Association of Indigenous Saraguro Christians, which is important
in giving rootless evangelicals an identity within their community, Davis said.

Prospects for a thaw in relations between China and the Vatican iced over
during the pope's visit to Manila. A 24-member delegation of clergy and lay
leaders from the government-sanctioned Chinese Catholic Church (Chinese
Patriotic Association) attended the Vatican's World Youth Day celebration, over
which the pontiff presided. It was the first official visit to a papal event since a
bitter split between the Vatican and China following the communist takeover in
1949. At that time, Catholics were forced to renounce the pope, many priests
were imprisoned, and Beijing created a Catholic group independent of Rome,
with bishops appointed by the government. The Vatican then infuriated Beijing
by establishing diplomatic ties with the Taiwanese government. Over the years,
the Vatican meanwhile secretly consecrated loyal Chinese priests and bishops,
who serve a growing underground network of churches loyal to the pope.
<BR>...Within the past two years, unofficial talks between Vatican and Beijing
officials signaled a thaw. Bishops from Beijing and Shanghai who came to
Manila were quoted in the press as confirming that relations with the Vatican
were improving. They insisted that they shared the same faith as all Catholics
and that their differences were political. But most of the Chinese delegation
walked out of the Youth Day mass, attended by a crowd estimated at several
million, when they spotted the flag of Taiwan among other flags in a procession
to the grandstand.
<BR>...The delegation released a statement, saying that Sino-Vatican relations
cannot be normalized until the Vatican severs its ties to Taiwan. Also, it must
refrain from interference in China's internal religious affairs.

the United States and Canada, according to the first major survey of organized
Islam on the continent. Half the masjids, or mosques, were organized since 1980,
the study showed. Nearly 40% of the masjids are affiliated with the Plainfield,
N.J.-based Islamic Society of North America. About 20% are aligned with Imam
W. Deen Muhammad of Chicago, who led the Black Muslim movement into
mainstream Islam. Some 30% are unaffiliated. The survey was carried out by the
Islamic Resource Institute in Fountain Valley, Calif.

Egyptian evangelical leader Samuel Habib called for understanding and
patience toward his country's treatment of Christian minorities and its efforts to
curb Islamic extremism. Critics showed up at his Washington, D.C., news
conference and denounced Egypt's alleged repression of Coptic Christians (NIRR
7/25/94). They charged Habib with misrepresenting the situation in Egypt.
<BR>...Habib, a Presbyterian and Bible society executive who is president of the
Protestant Churches of Egypt, was in the United States touring with Grand Mufti
Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi, Egypt's supreme Islamic authority. Tantawi vowed
to push for the lifting of laws that deny Christians the same rights given to
Muslim Egyptians. Christians are estimated to account for 10%-20% of Egypt's
60 million population. Most belong to the Coptic Orthodox Church.

A group of 147 Muslim businessmen, journalists, scientists, and students
in Pakistan has called for all citizens in that country to respect and protect the
rights of religious minorities. Billing themselves as "Citizens for Public Rights,"
the group took out a full-page newspaper ad condemning violence and discrimination against Ahmadi, Christian, and Hindu Pakistanis.

The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review an Ohio case to clarify the right
of private citizens to display religious messages on public property. A federal
appeals court in that case allowed the Ku Klux Klan to erect a cross in a Columbus, Ohio, park next to the Statehouse as part of a Christmas display. Regulators
had allowed a menorah and a Christmas tree to be displayed for several years,
but refused to give the Klan a permit for the cross in 1993 (NIRR 12/13/93). The
appeals court ruled that in a public forum "the religious content of private speech
is absolutely irrelevant" and cannot violate the Constitution's Establishment
Clause. Ohio's appeal to the Supreme Court said giving the public-forum
doctrine absolute precedence would make it hard for state and local governments
to avoid the appearance of taking a position on questions of religious belief.

Threatened with a $10,000 contempt fine and other court sanctions, First
Baptist Church of Markham Woods in Lake Mary, Fla., agreed to release names
of donors to a former member. Pastor William Parker warned that the ruling will
have a chilling effect on contributions to churches and other non-profit groups.
<BR>...The decision came in a lawsuit filed by Ann Haynes in 1993 after she
was removed from First Baptist's membership. Grounds cited were poor attendance, unchristian conduct, and refusal to work out conflicts within the church.
Haynes charged the church and Parker with misuse of funds, including failure to
account for how a $416,000 bequest was spent. Her suit cited a state statute that
requires a non-profit organization to disclose records to its members. (Federal
disclosure regulations exempt donors' names and contribution amounts.) In June
1994, all church records except names of contributors were turned over to
Haynes' lawyers. But on Jan. 10, a Seminole County judge ordered the church to
turn over records showing amounts and names of contributors. Parker is a
member of the Southern Baptist Convention's Executive Committee.

An elementary school in Spring, Texas, agreed to allow its students to wear
T-shirts with religious messages on them, the Virginia-based Rutherford Institute
said. Two children had been told they could not wear the shirts, which depicted
Jesus' bloody, nail-pierced hands and the slogan: "His pain, your gain." School
officials said the shirts promoted violence. They changed their policy after the
institute objected, a Rutherford spokesman said.

Wisconsin will include religious schools in its four-year-old school choice
program, if a measure backed by Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson is passed
by the legislature. The present voucher program is being phased in gradually.
Currently, it is restricted to parents of 1,500 pupils in Milwaukee. Thompson has
proposed spending $11.5 million to expand the program next year to an additional 2,000 students and include religious schools. Americans United for Separation
of Church and State, the ACLU, and other groups have vowed to fight the
proposal. Robert Dugan of the National Association of Evangelicals, which
endorses the inclusion of religious schools in school choice, called the plan a
"great breakthrough." Wisconsin officials say they believe their plan is constitutional because it funds parents and not schools.

Tens of thousands of young people around the world have a vision for
spreading the gospel, but lack the skills to fulfill that vision, said Greg Robert
Groh of the World Leadership Council, a nonprofit located in Denver. In two
years, the WLC has taught thousands of Christians during seminars in South
Africa, Greece, Russia, Canada, Sweden, and Romania. The culturally sensitive
seminars include a six-to-12-month preparation process in which Christian
leaders are identified and consulted to determine areas of need in a country.
Classes are tailored to fit the needs of a country. In countries where business
evangelism is needed, a business track is included. Other countries may need
courses in music and arts for youth ministry, and in Muslim countries a course in
apologetics is necessary.

Youth For Christ held 20 evangelism-training seminars called Change-Up!

Federal prosecutors "can now move confidently against commercial child
porn distributors," said John McMickle of the National Law Center. He commented after the Supreme Court refused this month to review the conviction of
Stephen Knox, the Pennsylvania man sentenced for possessing videos that
focused on the genitals of scantily clad young girls. The NLC, the legal wing of
the National Coalition for Protection of Children and Families, cited the leadership of Attorney General Janet Reno in appealing to the high court for a strong
interpretation of a federal law regarding child pornography. The scope of the law
has been expanded to protect minors from child pornographers who focus on
their private parts -- even if not completely nude.

Religious leaders seemed as divided as ever after abortion clinic killings
in Massachusetts on Dec. 30. Members of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice appealed to the nation's Catholic bishops to support a moratorium on
demonstrations outside abortion clinics. They also called for a dialogue on the
issues. Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston earlier had called for such a moratorium
(<A HREF="/NIRR/1995/010995.html">NIRR 1/9</A>). However, Catholic officials in Washington, D.C., said they did not
expect the bishops' conference to take up the issue. Cardinal John O'Connor in
a sermon at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York said he would call for a
moratorium on demonstrations only if a moratorium is called on abortions. He
denounced using violence against abortionists. Several pro-life leaders warned
against allowing pro-choice groups to dictate tactics or muzzle the free speech of
abortion foes. Abortion-rights groups know they can restrict "our life-saving
work if they can get us to stop using words that convey truth," Rescue America's
Don Treshman told Law. "Abortion is murder, and those who perform abortions
are murderers," he said.

A veteran abortion-rights activist was arrested and charged with threatening to blow up a Catholic church in Suffern, N.Y. Police said Alice Hand, 54, a
patient escort at a nearby abortion clinic, made at least three such calls to the
church. A priest traced the call. Hand told authorities she was distraught over
recent violence directed at clinics by abortion opponents. She blamed her action
partly on the Catholic Church's position on abortion, news accounts said.

People who are so mentally defective that they cannot live in society
should "be humanely dispatched," according to an article in the newsletter of the
Los Angeles chapter of MENSA. The group's members have IQs in the top 2%

article, which appeared to propose extermination of the homeless, mentally
retarded, old, and infirm, the Los Angeles Times reported. A writer said in
another story that "it is not clear to me why anyone would expend time and
effort and money on the homeless. What good are they?" The articles caused
outrage among the local chapter's 2,000 members, and Frey was fired.

Bigmouth, an automated voice-mail system, operates a prayer chain for First
Baptist Church in Gozaburg, Neb. The system, designed for telemarketing
appeals, "is a great ministry tool," said pastor Tim Burke, because it assures that
prayer requests and updates faithfully are passed along the chain. Church
members make requests, which are passed along the 60-person prayer chain.
<BR>...Formerly, the chain broke down when no one was home or the request
was accidentally altered, Burke said. But with Bigmouth everyone receives the

Cardinal John O'Connor can keep his job as archbishop of New York,
Roman Catholic officials said. O'Connor offered his resignation this month when
he turned 75, which is the Church's mandatory retirement age. Pope John Paul II
won't immediately accept the resignation because O'Connor is in good health,
Church officials said. The Philadelphia-born O'Connor, a former Navy chief of
chaplains, is considered by many to be the pope's leading advocate in America.
He is known for his plain-spoken defense of the Church's teachings.                                <P><A HREF="#MENU">Back to menu</A>

Under pressure, the Greek Orthodox
Church in the United States will tone
down a recent encyclical on mixed marriage (NIRR 11/14/94). In it, Archbishop
Iakovos, the church's top leader, lumped
Pentecostals with Buddhists, Hindus,
members of cults, New Age devotees,
and others as outside the Christian tradition. Pentecostals and some Orthodox
church members protested the encyclical.
As a result, officials said, a revised encyclical will instruct priests that
Pentecostals can marry Orthodox, depending on their beliefs and those of their
Pentecostal denomination. Iakovos has
feuded for years with charismatics in his
own denomination.

New York City will challenge the constitutionality of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, city officials said. Earlier,
Gov. Mario Cuomo bowed to pressure
from the American Jewish Congress and

A computer was used to "shave" the
beard and sideburns from a Hasidic prison inmate. New York prison officials
agreed to accept a clean-shaven computer image for the rabbi's ID photo instead
of forcing him to shave. Policy dictates
that prisoners be pictured clean-shaven,
but Rabbi Shlomo Helbrans said shaving
would violate his religious beliefs. He was
convicted in November of directing the
kidnapping of one of his teen-age students in a family religious dispute, and
received 4-to-12 years in prison.

A connection between fingerprint ridges and homosexuality is "highly speculative," said Exodus International, a San
Raphael, Calif.-based ministry to homosexuals. University of Western Ontario
researchers found that 30% of homosexual men in a test group had more ridges
on their left hands than their right, while
only 14% of the heterosexual men in the
group showed the same pattern. Even if
people are born with predetermined factors that push them toward homosexuality, "we all control our sexual choices" as

Potentially more than 1 billion people will participate in Global Mission,
a three-day Billy Graham crusade and Christian Workers' Conference. It will be
broadcast March 16-18 to countries with 70% of the world's population. The 
crusade will be beamed by satellite from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to 165 countries,
and translated simultaneously into 80 languages. Pre-produced segments of
culturally appropriate singing and testimonials will be broadcast before and after
the messages. The March 17 broadcast will air in the United States March 19,
and in 90 other countries in the months after the crusade. If 10% of viewers
respond, which has occurred in Graham's previous satellite broadcasts, "we're
talking about a hundred million people making decisions" for Christ, Billy
Graham Evangelistic Association President John Corts said. 
<BR>...In addition, a Christian Workers' Conference will feature three hours of
daily programming designed to teach evangelism. Programming will feature Luis

More than half the world's missionaries come from Third World countries,
according to Hans Finzel, director of CB International, missionary wing of the
Conservative Baptists. The trend shows that missions agencies succeeded in
creating national churches that caught the missionary vision. Growing numbers of
missionaries from Southeast Asia mean that "America no longer bears the burden
alone, but now stands shoulder-to-shoulder in partnership" to reach the world for
Christ, Finzel said. He said these regions, and some in South America and
Africa, can be de-emphasized and missionaries redeployed to less-evangelized
areas, such as the barely reached 10/40 Window (NIRR 11/23/94). 
<BR>...U.S. support for missions work is declining, Finzel said. Saturated donor
bases and the church's failure to convince people of the importance of missions
have resulted in less money. Old methods of raising missions support don't work
well on the baby-boomer and baby-buster generations, so new approaches are
needed, he said. Younger supporters value demonstrated results and a feeling of
personal involvement. "Institutions are out, people are in."

Japan is experiencing uncommon growth in Christian converts. Revival
services in the past year have resulted in 30,000 new believers. For Japan, "these
results are really remarkable," Paul Ariga of All Japanese Revival Mission said.

church leaders, and "strategic spiritual warfare." 
<BR>...More than 13,000 "prayer warriors" have spent 777,000 hours in prayer
since 1992 at more than 750 prayer meetings. The fruits of these efforts were
seen at a three-day crusade in 1992, the All Japan Revival Koshien Mission,
when more than 20,000 Japanese made commitments to Christ. "I knew then that
revival had come to Japan," Ariga said. Soon afterward, he and five other

John Salvi had a series of outbursts and arguments in church and with

reported. At a Christmas Eve mass in Seabrook, N.H., Salvi, 22, interrupted the
service with a confused harangue on "the problems of the Catholic Church and
its failures," the news accounts said. Church members and his parents escorted
him outside. As a child, Salvi had served as an altar boy at a church in Ipswich,
Mass. He spent his teen years in Naples, Fla., where the family attended St.
Ann's Catholic Church. Although the parish was not known for anti-abortion
activism, his parents took part in an annual pro-life demonstration, a "chain of

Acquaintances called him a Bible-quoting loner who pasted pictures of fetuses on

it himself. He was selective....He chose in his own mind what was right or
wrong," former friend Don Newton told The Washington Post. Neighbors who
entered his one-room apartment after the clinic shootings said they found a

he was captured, Salvi visited with a jail chaplain and spoke by phone with his

God isn't dead, He just hasn't been born yet, according to a new theory

life forms. In the future, life will include not only living creatures, but computers
that will be powerful enough to achieve a state of consciousness, Tipler says. At
some point, they will meld that consciousness with other life forms until it
envelops the universe. Then, the "life" will achieve total knowledge and power
with the ability to create "everyone who has ever lived in the form of software,
and...an ideal software world -- heaven." There will be a purgatory, but not a

his neighborhood, he decided to make some phone calls. Five pastors committed
to pray together, relationships developed, and the group now takes retreats
together, the Evangelistic Association of New England said. The churches held a
joint worship service this fall attended by 300 people. Pastors took turns confessing their sins to one another, washing each others' feet, and encouraging the
congregation to do the same.

Islamic fundamentalists in Egypt are expanding their influence by aiding
disaster victims. After devastating floods displaced 50,000 people and caused
hundreds of millions of dollars of damage, several Islamic groups provided aid.
Muslims gave food and blankets and opened their mosques for shelter, while
another Islamic group repaired the water system, Intelligence Digest reports.

Buddhist monks in Sri Lanka demanded that Pope John Paul II withdraw
remarks he made about their religion in his new book. The pope wrote in
Crossing the Threshold of Hope that Buddhism's doctrine of salvation is "almost
exclusively negative," and that Buddhism is largely an "atheistic system." The
monks said they were not satisfied by an apology issued last month by Sri
Lanka's Catholic Church. The country's population is 70% Buddhist.

Iran's parliament approved a ban on satellite TV dishes. Hard-line Islamic
clerics had pushed for the ban to curb increasingly popular Western shows they
view as promoting moral decay. Under the law, expected to take effect later this
month, the Ministry of Islamic Guidance and Culture can "safeguard cultural
boundaries of the country and of its families against destructive and indecent
satellite programs." Owners will have 30 days to remove their dishes.

An Assemblies of God pastor in Cairo was released Dec. 19 after spending
37 days in prison (NIRR 12/12/94). William Gayyid had been charged with
trying to convert three Egyptian women to Christianity. They had come to his
church and asked him to pray for them, church members said.
<BR>...Four other Coptic Christians arrested in October and November are
being held, according to the London-based International Institute for the Study of
Islam and Christianity. They include a Coptic priest, a deacon, a church worker,
and a girl converted from Islam and baptized by the priest, an institute official
said. The priest, Boulos Samaan Abd El-Sayed, was charged with scorning Islam,
encouraging apostasy, and forging official papers (NIRR 12/26/94).

The murder of four Catholic priests in Algeria was part of a "campaign of
annihilation and physical liquidation of Christian crusaders," the hardline Armed
Islamic Group (GIA) announced. It claimed responsibility for the deaths as
revenge for four GIA hijackers killed in a shootout on a French Airbus jet in
Marseille. Witnesses said the priests were shot by six men with assault rifles in
a town near Algiers. Three were French priests teaching in the town. The fourth
had come from Belgium and set up an association in Algiers to improve MuslimChristian relationships. All were with the Order of White Fathers, so-named for
their robes, also known as Missionaries of Africa. They ranged in age from 36 to
75. The Order's first missionaries to Algeria in 1873 were slain by their guides.
<BR>...The killings bring to at least 75 the number of foreigners slain since
1992 in the country. Two other French Catholic missionaries were killed in May,
and two Spanish nuns were gunned down in Algiers in October.

The oldest New Testament writings ever: That is how German scholar
Carsten Thiede described three papyrus fragments containing parts of the Gospel
of Matthew. Comparing their script and style with other Greek documents, he
dated them in the last quarter of the first century. A fragment of John 18 from
the early second century long has been acknowledged as the oldest Scripture in
existence. The Matthew fragments have been preserved at a library at Oxford
University's Magdalen College since their arrival from Egypt in 1901. Thiede, of
the Institute for Basic Epistemological Research in Paderborn, Germany, published his findings in the Journal for Papyrology and Epigraphics, a German
publication. Scholars quoted by the British press did not dispute him, but said the
findings would be difficult to verify.
<BR>...The fragments show the scribe using abbreviations for Jesus' name, in
line with the Jewish custom of not writing or pronouncing the name of God.
This, Thiede said, indicates that Jesus' followers believed He was God.

James Dobson of Focus on the Family joined the new national Commission

New Age author Marianne Williamson, guru to many of Hollywood's spiritual seekers, may have met her most influential fan yet. According to Esquire
magazine, Williamson met Hillary Clinton at a fund-raiser, was invited to the
White House, and spent the night in the Lincoln bedroom. Williamson wrote the
best-seller Return to Love (NIRR 3/23/92).

Bill Gothard almost was electrocuted in Moscow late last month, but the
near-tragedy resulted in many people coming to Christ. The founder of the
Institute in Basic Life Principles was holding a microphone that was not grounded while speaking to an auditorium of people. When Gothard touched the metal
portion of a chalk easel with his other hand, electricity surged through his body
and froze him between the two objects.
<BR>...Realizing he was "in a serious situation," Gothard summoned his
"remaining strength" and lunged to the floor, he said. The frightened audience
began crying. Then, the person in charge gave an invitation for salvation. "Many,
many responded because of what they saw," Gothard said. The near-catastrophe
was "a demonstration of how brief life can be." Gothard suffered an irregular
heartbeat for a day after the accident, but said he is feeling fine now.

The top religion story of 1994 was the role that conservative religious groups,
such as the Christian Coalition, played in getting out voters for the GOP election
landslide, according to a poll of Religion Newswriters Association members.
RNA members report religion full time for the secular press. Other top stories, in
order: the Catholic Church's attempt to define the role of women in the sanctuary; the fallout over the 1993 "RE-Imagining Conference" in Minneapolis; the
murder of an abortion doctor by Paul Hill, a former minister; and the progress of
the historic peace accord between Israel and the PLO.

NATIONAL & INTERNATIONAL RELIGION REPORT Volume 8, Number 26 December 
12, 1994 

SPECIAL ONLINE EDITION FOR CHRISTIAN INTERACTIVE NETWORK SUBSCRIBERS 

Sixty-two thousand churches in 25 years -- one church for every 5,000 
people in the former Soviet Union -is the ambitious goal of Project 
250. The church-planting strategy, coordinated by Russian Ministries 
and facilitated by several other Western missions groups, involves 
establishing 250 satellite-training centers to educate nationals in the 
Commonwealth of Independent States in evangelization and church 
planting. Peter Deyneka, Jr., president of the Wheaton, Ill.-based 
group, told NIRR the goal is large, but spiritual hunger is larger 
after decades of atheism. 
...Communists created an enormous curiosity about the God they insisted 
did not exist, and now that the floodgates have opened, "it is 
relatively easy to start a church in the Republic of Russia, Ukraine, 
and Belarus," Deyneka said. Started in 1992, Project 250's original 
goal was to train 250 church planters. Since then, more than 800 
people, some from the farthest reaches of the CIS, have trained at the 
project's facility in Moscow. Already they have planted about a 
thousand churches. Recognizing the tremendous opportunities, Deyneka 
and Russian religious leaders revised their goals. "We had no idea the 
impact" the program would have. 
...Russian Protestants, tried and tested by persecution, are bold and 
resolute, "the most dedicated missionaries I have ever met in my world 
travels and life," Deyneka said. For example: one church planter in 
Moldavia has started a church every nine months since 1990; in Armenia, 
missionaries walk 20 to 30 miles a day to fulfill their mission; in the 
remote north, one native Yakut Christian and a team of missionaries 
have started 25 churches in the past six years, Deyneka said. The 
Russian Orthodox Church should withdraw from the World Council of 
Churches and other ecumenical groups, the ROC's Theological Commission 
recommended. It said the action should be taken to protest "missionary 
intrusions" in Russia by non-Orthodox groups. A decision will not be 
made until church leaders consult with other Orthodox churches outside 
Russia, Ecumenical News International reported. 
...After the collapse of communism, many Western groups, mostly 
evangelical ones, launched outreach efforts in the former Soviet Union. 
Methodist, Lutheran, Presbyterian, and other mainline denominations 
also have been involved. 

All Christians have a duty to evangelize, the National Council of 
Churches officially affirmed. A policy statement adopted unanimously by 
the NCC's governing board at a meeting in New Orleans said evangelism 
is "inseparable" from the church. Denominations, missions 
organizations, and parachurch groups are called to work together to 
evangelize, the document asserts. 
...Evangelism must be "biblically centered, theologically sound, and 
respectful of our varied histories and traditions," the statement said. 
Sources credited leaders in the American Baptist Churches for getting 
the statement drawn up and approved. Many of the 32 mostly mainline 
Protestant and Orthodox denominations that belong to the NCC have 
suffered declines in membership over the past 25 years. Increasingly, 
groups within those denominations criticize the NCC, saying it has 
spent too much time on social issues and too little on evangelism and 
missions. 
...Billy Graham sent a congratulatory letter to NCC General Secretary 
Joan Brown Campbell. He praised her efforts "to bring about a renewed 
understanding of the priority of evangelism and a rededication to the 
practice of biblical evangelism within the churches you serve." 

"One million people would come to Christ today if they were only told 
the gospel," Avery Willis of the Southern Baptist Foreign Missions 
Board said. "But who will tell them?" At a time when missionaries are 
most needed, Western churches have lost confidence and retreated from 
the challenge, Baptist Press reported. 
...In 1988, there were 50,000 missionaries from the United States, but 
replenishment has not kept up with the attrition rate. By 1992 the 
number of U.S. missionaries had decreased by almost 10%. That is less 
than half the number AD 2000 and Beyond Movement leader George Verwer 
says Western churches should be sending. Some say numbers are declining 
because churches have lost their passion for spreading the gospel. 
Others say churches are reflecting self-centered values of baby boomer 
members. 
...Southern Baptist career appointments have fallen from 304 in 1985 to 
only 223 in 1993. For some, the concept of a "missionary call" has 
changed from a lifetime commitment to a short-term one. A survey by 
consultant Jim Slack revealed that Southern Baptist missionaries cite 
"change of call" twice as often as any other reason for retiring. 

Luis Palau's crusade in Paraguay was so popular that a local television 
station canceled the country's top-rated show and convinced officials 
to reschedule the national-championship soccer match so five of his 
services could be aired. Some 75,000 people attended three stadium 
rallies and 4,800 made commitments to Christ during the weeklong 
crusade by the Argentine-born evangelist. Broadcasts aired throughout 
central South America. Some 15,000 Christians from 120 churches plan to 
follow through with converts and distribute Going Forward With Christ, 
a book of basic Christian teachings. 

A wave of reconciliation occurred among Liberian Christians from 
hostile tribes attending the Danane Reconciliation Conference in 
November. More than 700 representatives of 26 tribes, some of whom were 
openly hostile and suspicious of one another, "wept in an very 
un-African display of emotion," said David Loudon of World Relief, 
which sponsored the conference. "Every tribe that had problems with 
another, even those whose problems went back to their ancestors, 
confessed and apologized for their sins against each other," World 
Relief's Brian Johnson told NIRR. Most tribal members are refugees from 
the civil war in Liberia, which has caused much distrust and bloodshed 
between the tribes. 
...More than 1.5 million people have been displaced by the five-year 
war, causing the tribes to make war on their fellow Christians. "The 
war divided the church terribly and caused great suspicion," Johnson 
said. "We wanted to reconcile the church and hope this example will 
lead to unification of the country." Reconciliation began when two 
women from opposing tribes became friends and publicly asked 
forgiveness of the other. 

British missionary Joy Bath, 44, an avowed virgin, is dying of AIDS. 
Doctors said she might not survive until Christmas. For 10 years she 
delivered babies at a hospital in Nyanga, Zimbabwe, and regularly 
handled contaminated blood. 
...One-third of the pregnant women she treated were HIV-positive, and 
she believes she became infected when she cut her toe badly while 
wearing sandals outside the operating room. She was quoted in the 
British press as saying: "I knew the risks. I'd do it again." 

Prominent Christian leaders will hold a nationally televised prayer 
meeting May 4, 1995, during the National Day of Prayer. The event will 
be televised from Moody Memorial Church in Chicago from 7-10 p.m. 
Central Time. National repentance, revival, and advancement of Christ's 
purposes will be the emphases of the "concert of prayer." 
...Christians across the nation will be encouraged to gather in their 
sanctuaries or homes to form a "single prayer meeting coast-to-coast 
numbering millions of Christians," organizer Robert Bakke of The 
Evangelical Free Church of America's National Prayer Advance told NIRR. 
Similar concerts of prayer are to be broadcast annually from 1995 until 
2000, Bakke said. 
...Participants include Joe Aldrich of Northwest Renewal Ministries and 
Multnomah Bible College; Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ; 
David Bryant of Concerts of Prayer International; George Brushaber of 
Christianity Today, Inc.; Paul Cedar of the Evangelical Free Church of 
America; Dick Eastman of Every Home For Christ; and E. Brandt Gustavson 
of National Religious Broadcasters. 
...Others are Jesse Miranda of Azusa Pacific University, a leading 
Hispanic Christian; evangelist Luis Palau; John Perkins, a leading 
black evangelical; David Rambo of the National Association of 
Evangelicals and The Christian & Missionary Alliance; Thomas Trask of 
the Assemblies of God; and Thomas Wang of AD 2000 and Beyond Movement. 

Saddleback Valley Community Church, Mission Viejo, Calif., announced it 
had raised $23.5 million in cash and commitments on a single weekend 
last month. Church leaders, who devised their own Time To Build 
campaign strategy, had set a $9 million goal. The money will be used to 
build a worship center, Sunday school buildings, and a youth center. 
With an average Sunday attendance of nearly 9,000, Saddleback is one of 
the largest and fastestgrowing churches in America. The congregation 
has met in 57 locations since its founding by pastor Rick Warren in 
1980 (NIRR 12/28/92). Four services are held in a huge tent, while 
Sunday schools are held in portable classrooms. 

Business entrepreneurs possess unique talents for fulfilling the Great 
Commission, but are under-appreciated by their churches. Most churches 
call entrepreneurs only when they need money, said Dennis Jones, 
founder of Harvest Fellowship, a ministry to executives. Jones believes 
initiative, resourcefulness, problem-solving abilities, and a sense of 
focus are qualities that entrepreneurs bring to the tasks of 
evangelization and church growth. 
...Harvest Fellowship, based in Virginia Beach, forms cell groups of 
professionals who learn to apply Scripture to business practices and 
then take short-term mission trips to Russia and Africa. Once the 
evangelistic fire is stoked, Jones said, they become dedicated to 
supporting evangelistic efforts -- not only through financial support, 
but with hands-on assistance as well. In Ghana, 15 new churches have 
been financed by local businessmen who heard Jones speak at a missions 
conference. In Russia, Harvest Fellowship built and equipped a new 
church with only $4,000. 

Jeffrey Dahmer was "an illustration of what true grace is all about," 
said the Church of Christ minister who discipled the serial killer. Roy 
Ratcliff told NIRR he had met with Dahmer for an hour every week since 
May 1, when he baptized him in a whirlpool at Columbia Correctional 
Center in southwest Wisconsin (NIRR 5/30). Dahmer, who was murdered in 
prison Nov. 28, had shown a gradual spiritual development, Ratcliff 
said. He became "considerate, caring, and compassionate." Ratcliff 
received a Thanksgiving Day card from Dahmer expressing appreciation 
for his friendship and "taking time and effort to help me understand 
God's Word." 
...Dahmer confessed deep remorse for his actions, which included the 
mutilation deaths of 17 boys and men. At one time he felt he was 
sinning against God because he had not been executed for his actions, 
Ratcliff said. A study of Romans 13, regarding submission of 
individuals to the state, convinced Dahmer he should not try to escape. 
Dahmer told Ratcliff he contemplated suicide but did not have the nerve 
to take his own life. 
...Dahmer was grateful when he survived a July 3 razor blade attack by 
another inmate, and did not have a death wish, Ratcliff said. Dahmer 
reportedly had agreed to discuss with Focus on the Family how addiction 
to pornography fueled his perversions. 

Mormons have been trying since September 1993 to shut down a Nevada 
pornography shop with round-the-clock picketing and surveillance. 
Protesters carry signs reading "Satan's Library" and "To The Victor 
Goes Our Children," and record license plate numbers and descriptions 
of patrons, which they report to the police if they think something is 
out of line. About 8,000 Mormons from Arizona, Nevada, and Utah have 
spent time monitoring business at the Mesquite, Nev., store. 
...Sam Cianciola, owner of Pure Pleasure Adult Book Store, said 
picketing cuts his profits in half, costing his store $5,000 a day. He 
vowed to fill the area with pornography. Organizers of the 
Mesquite-based anti-pornography group Help Our Moral Environment say 
protests will continue as long as necessary. Picketers hold church 
services in an adjacent lot. Pure Pleasure's parent company has sued to 
stop the picketers. 

A federal child pornography law was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
It rejected arguments that Congress has so vaguely worded the statute 
that it criminalized video and book sales that should be protected by 
the First Amendment. The 7-2 ruling overturned a 1992 9th U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals decision in a California case. Justices Antonin Scalia 
and Clarence Thomas dissented. They said by twisting meanings of the 
statute's language, the majority had put in place "a relatively 
toothless child-pornography law that Congress did not enact" and made 
it difficult for Congress to strengthen "that new law" [U.S. v. 
X-Citement Video]. 
...The high court turned down the appeal of a Florida man who said a 
Halloween celebration at his sons' elementary school offended his 
family. The use of brooms, cauldrons, and other symbols in a public 
school, along with teachers dressed as witches, violated the separation 
of church and state, he had argued. 

Excluding religion from public school curricula is bad for education, 
and it can be taught without unlawfully imposing religious beliefs upon 
students. That is the thesis of a new book of guidelines for teachers 
and administrators called Finding Common Ground: A First Amendment 
Guide to Religion. It was published by Freedom Forum First Amendment 
Center at Vanderbilt University. "Omission of facts about religion can 
give students the false impression that the religious life of humankind 
is insignificant or unimportant," the book contends. Furthermore, 
"failure to understand even the basic symbols, practices, and concepts 
of the various religions make much of history, literature, art, and 
contemporary life unintelligible," the book says. 
...Along with suggested guidelines for teaching religion as an academic 
subject, the book includes model school district policies on the proper 
way to go about it. 

There were few defeats for Christian conservatives in last month's 
elections. One of them occurred in Vista, Calif. (NIRR 4/4), where two 
conservative Christian members of the school board were removed in a 
recall vote. All five Christian conservatives who ran for the board's 
three vacant seats were defeated. A 3-2 conservative majority took 
control of the board in 1992. They fought to limit sex education, 
promote the teaching of creationism, reintroduce prayer to the school 
system, and curtail breakfast programs financed by the government. 
Board meetings that normally attracted 30 people quickly drew hundreds 
of shouting, clapping partisans, as well as reporters from across the 
country. Analysts said voters were tired of controversy and alarmed 
that financial and other problems had not been addressed. 

Puerto Rico's Supreme Court struck down the commonwealth's school 
voucher program, the most expansive of any on U.S. territory. The U.S. 
Constitution forbids giving public funds to private institutions, it 
said. Under the program, the government paid a secular or religious 
private school $1,500 toward the cost of educating a public school 
student whose family earned less than $18,000 a year. The tab this 
school year was $2.7 million for 2,013 students, news reports said. 

Hollywood may be changing for the better, media watcher Ted Baehr 
suggested. Ten years ago, Hollywood produced only two family films, he 
told a Baptist Press interviewer. In 1992 there were six, only three of 
which "measured up to our biblically-based standards." But, he added, a 
breakthrough came in 1993 and 1994. In 1994, 75 family films were 
produced, "and we were able to recommend 32 of them," Baehr said. 
...He believes there will be a greater movement toward family films as 
the U.S. population ages. Holly-wood's decision makers are changing 
their attitudes because they see how movies and television influence 
their children, he said. Baehr also credited the "dramatic" recent 
growth of Christianity in Hollywood for some of the positive change. 
...A 1979 poll of media leaders showed 7% associated with a church or 
some religion, Baehr said. By 1989, that figure had grown to 36%, and 
in 1994 it was 60%. 

No prime-time television scripts in the past two decades affirmed "the 
importance of faith, the power of prayer, and the possibility of 
miracles," according to Prime Time, a book by Robert and Linda Lichter 
and Stanley Rothman. The Flying Nun was the last successful television 
series to "portray clergy in a traditional fashion," they said. 
Analyzing TV scripts, the trio found that fewer than 1% of television 
characters worked in a religious vocation, and those who did were 
portrayed as "politically correct," according to USA Today. 
...Christy, the story of a young woman who teaches at an Appalachian 
mission school, returned to the airwaves Thanksgiving evening. Popular 
among Christians in its first two showings, the show garnered 14.4% of 
the viewing audience, beating Fox's Martin, Living Single and New York 
Undercover, while losing to NBC's showing of Home Alone and CBS' 
MacGyver special.  

Jim Bakker was freed Dec. 1 from a Salvation Army halfway house in 
Asheville, N.C. (NIRR 7/11), five years after his 1989 conviction. 
Bakker, 54, who was imprisoned in Minnesota and Georgia, was convicted 
of defrauding 116,000 followers of $158 million by overselling lodging 
guarantees and misusing $3.7 million in ministry money to buy homes, 
cars, jewelry, and vacations. He has not detailed his plans. 

Religious leaders in 27 U.S. communities have formed a common front to 
do more to prepare engaged couples for marriage (NIRR 11/1/93). 
Guidelines for counseling include sexual abstinence outside marriage, 
four months premarital preparation, and clerical mentoring. There's 
also a premarital inventory to determine compatibility, which can 
predict marriage survival with 86% accuracy, Michael McManus, author of 
the book Marriage Savers, said. Mentoring done by married couples whose 
marriages almost failed also is effective. Seven mentor couples in 
Jacksonville saved 39 of 40 marriages headed for divorce. The problem, 
McManus said, is some churches are "blessing machines and wedding 
factories." 

Despite Bill McCartney's resignation as head football coach at the 
University of Colorado, he continues to sit on the board of directors 
and serve as a speaker for Promise Keepers, the national Christian 
men's ministry he cofounded in 1990. The future is unclear, however. 
McCartney said at his resignation that he plans to spend a full year 
away from any full-time commitments to devote time to his family and 
personal prayer. 

The man who hurled himself at a gunman who was shooting at the White 
House said the Lord had prepared him to act quickly and decisively in 
such a situation. Harry Rakosky told NIRR that a few weeks before the 
October incident, he and his brother discussed whether Harry, a 
security specialist, would respond courageously if a gunman opened fire 
at an executive he was guarding. That conversation confirmed to him 
that "the Lord was preparing me," Rakosky said. Not skilled at 
"tackling anyone," Rakosky was the first to lunge at the gunman. 
Francisco Duran is charged with trying to assassinate the president. 
...Rakosky, a member of Wayside Chapel Evangelical Free Church in San 
Antonio, described himself as "a strong believer in a providential 
God." Nothing takes place "without His permitting it," he said. "The 
Lord put me in the right place at the right time." 

David "Moses" Berg, founder of the controversial Children of God 
movement now called The Family, died at age 75, a spokesman for the 
group said. However, many cult watchers and law enforcement officials 
are skeptical. Berg has been the object of a worldwide search by 
Interpol, the international police agency. He is wanted in Argentina 
and other nations on charges of inciting child sexual abuse and other 
crimes. 

More than 30 Jewish and conservative Christian leaders met behind 
closed doors in Washington, D.C., this month to negotiate a cease-fire 
of sorts in their public differences over social and political issues. 
Rabbi Yechial Eckstein, president of the International Fellowship of 
Christians and Jews, organized the meeting to defuse a "crisis 
situation." He said there had been division between the Jewish and 
Christian communities since release of a stinging criticism of 
Christian conservatives by the Anti-Defamation League last spring. The 
ADL report accused the Christians of hostility toward Jews and Jewish 
concerns. Eckstein said conservative Christians were among the Jewish 
nation's best friends. 
..."We established the line between differences and disdain," Philip 
Baum, national director of the American Jewish Congress, told Religion 
News Service after the meeting. Forest Montgomery, legal counsel for 
the National Association of Evangelicals, said the focus should be on 
what is happening to the culture. "We can disagree without rancor," he 
added. 

People of faith are more to blame for the nation's woes than are 
politicians, according to U.S. Senate Chaplain Richard Halverson (NIRR 
12/28). Believers who are politically ignorant or apathetic "abdicate 
their responsibility," he told NIRR, noting that lawmakers have 
authority to act only "with the consent of the governed." People of 
faith must understand issues, vote intelligently, and advise elected 
representatives, he said. Halverson, a Presbyterian minister, retires 
this month after 14 years of counseling senators and staff members. 
...Halverson's successor was to have been selected early this month by 
a committee comprised of Sens. Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.), Dan Coats 
(R-Ind.), and Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.). Many expected Halverson's son 
Chris, a Presbyterian minister who often has filled in for his father 
on the Senate floor, to be named. However, lobbying by several factions 
for a different choice forced the committee to delay its decision, NIRR 
learned. One faction was pressing the case for a female chaplain. 
Another, including a number of influential evangelical leaders, wanted 
the committee to choose a prominent black minister. 

Black churches have pledged to help the financially troubled NAACP. 
Predominantly black denominations have promised to raise $5 million 
from their members. The National Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People is struggling with a $4 million budget deficit. Some of 
the shortfall was incurred during the administration of former 
executive director Benjamin Chavis (NIRR 9/5), who used NAACP funds to 
settle a sex-discrimination claim. Chavis later was fired. Mainline 
Protestant and Jewish groups also have pledged support. 

Charity groups could be overwhelmed by hungry and homeless people if 
the new Republican majority in Congress succeeds in shifting the 
nation's welfare burden away from the federal government. When the 
impoverished no longer receive federal aid, they will ask local 
governments and charities for help, leaders of nonprofits say. Fred 
Kammer, president of Catholic Charities USA, told The Chronicle of 
Philanthropy he fears his group could not cope. 
...If a Republican idea becomes law, individuals' taxes could be 
earmarked for groups serving the needy. Some charity officials welcome 
incentives, but doubt new tax breaks would dramatically increase 
giving. 

The U.S. Postal Service did a hasty about-face and announced it will 
continue to issue a "Madonna and Child" Christmas stamp after all (NIRR 
11/28). The agency caused an uproar -- and incurred the wrath of 
President Clinton -- when it announced plans to end the stamp series. 
The Postal Service began the Madonna series in 1966. 

Second-class postage rates for nonprofits will increase 20%-23% under a 
Postal Rate Commission recommendation. The hike could come as early as 
Jan. 1 if approved by the U.S.P.S. governing board. The increase is 
part of a six-year plan to phase in higher rates. Publishers were hit 
with a 6% increase Oct. 1, and might get a 3% increase next October. 
...The second-class increases are worrisome, publishers say, noting 
they may cut jobs to make up the difference. At Baptist Record, a 
Mississippi newspaper, the increased postal cost will be $167,000 a 
year. God's World Publications in Asheville, N.C., publishers of World 
magazine and weekly newspapers for Christian students, will have about 
$100,000 added to its annual postage bill, according to Joel Belz, 
publisher. 
...Third-class nonprofit rates could rise 4%-5%, the U.S.P.S. said. 

Salvation Army bells aren't ringing at some 2,000 stores across the 
country that refused to allow SA kettles on their premises. Malls and 
store officials across the country -- including Boston's upscale Copley 
Place mall, Cincinnati's Thriftway Food-Drug, Michigan's Meijer grocery 
and department store chain, and Sears -- say that if they let one 
charity in, they will have to admit other charities, labor unions, and 
even picketers. 
...Toys For Tots -- the Marines' 48-year-old tradition of collecting, 
storing, and transporting toys for needy children -- has been 
restricted. A change in Department of Defense ethics regulations 
prohibits the Marines and other branches of the military from 
soliciting donations of cash, goods, and services. Earlier this year, 
it was discovered that none of the nearly $10 million the Toys For Tots 
Foundation raised in a direct-mail campaign went to buy toys, according 
to Money magazine. The campaign was so costly that all the donations 
went to pay its bills. 

The Vatican has projected a deficit of $22.4 million for its 1995 
operations, despite an expected increase in contributions from Catholic 
churches around the world. 

Employers can silence proselytizers whose religious views disturb other 
workers, a federal court ruled. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th 
Circuit in St. Louis upheld the firing of a Christian employee of the 
Polk County, Iowa, government. He had been ordered to stop religious 
counseling at work and remove a Bible from his office, according to the 
National Institute of Business Management. The judge distinguished 
between unconstitutional curbs on religious belief and allowable curbs 
on conduct at work, the institute said. 
...The employee supervised 50 people. Workers met in his office to 
pray, which caused a rift with others in the office. When news of 
imminent layoffs leaked out, those who did not share the supervisor's 
religious beliefs worried that they would be the ones laid off, the 
institute said. 

Pro-life protesters in New Jersey can picket closer to a doctor's 
residence, but still must observe other restrictions, the New Jersey 
Supreme Court decided. To comply with a recent U.S. Supreme Court 
decision, the state court shrank the so-called privacy zone outside a 
home from 300 feet to 100 feet. It also limited picketers to 10 at a 
time and to one hour every two weeks, with police notification 24 hours 
in advance. 
...Abortion foes said they are unhappy with the revision and will 
appeal again. At issue is an injunction that limits protests outside of 
the Westfield home of Dr. Elrick Murray, who reportedly performs 
abortions at a clinic in nearby Plainfield. 

Convicted murderer Paul Hill, 40, told CBS TV's anchor Connie Chung 
that he would not appeal a death sentence. He made the statement a week 
before Florida Judge Frank Bell sentenced him to die in the electric 
chair for murdering abortion clinic doctor John Britton and his 
bodyguard (NIRR 8/8). Friends of the former Presbyterian minister said 
he likely will stand by his vow. The typical inmate on Florida's death 
row spends about 10 years exhausting appeals. Hill said he had no 
regrets about the shootings because he had to stop the killing of 
babies. 
...Days earlier, Hill was sentenced in federal court to two life terms. 
He was the first person in the United States to be prosecuted for 
violence under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. "History 
teaches few lessons as clearly as the dangers inherent in those who 
kill in the name of God," prosecutor David McGee said. Hill, who 
defended himself, presented no evidence or witnesses after being told 
he could not use a defense of justifiable homicide. 

U.S. coins and currency can continue to carry the motto In God We 
Trust, U.S. District Judge Daniel Sparr ruled (NIRR 6/27). He dismissed 
a suit brought by the Freedom from Religion Foundation. 

The right of individuals to speak out against homosexuality is being 
defended in a case in New Jersey. Pastor David Cummings and his 
Orthodox Presbyterian Church challenged a homosexual-rights amendment 
to the state antidiscrimination law. The amendment states that anyone 
in the state who causes direct or indirect discrimination against 
homosexuals is subject to compensatory and punitive damages, said 
Rutherford Institute attorney Thomas Neuberger. 
...After Cummings' 1992 suit, the state exempted churches and pastors 
from prosecution under the law, but refused to exempt individuals, 
Neuberger said. Last month, the 3rd District U.S. Court of Appeals in 
Philadelphia said the amendment threatens Cummings' right as an 
individual, and directed a lower court to assess its "effect on our 
fundamental constitutional right of freedom of speech." Outcome of the 
case will help define the "rights of the people in the pew" in New 
Jersey and possibly set precedent nationwide, Neuberger said. 

The Church of England is reconsidering its ban on priests remarrying 
divorced people. The state church's governing General Synod called on 
bishops to study the issue, define current church practice, and report 
back. Britain has one of the highest divorce rates in Europe, with more 
than one in two marriages ending in divorce, published reports said. 
...British homosexual activists "outed" 10 Anglican bishops in a 
demonstration at the synod. Members of OutRage, a group pressing for 
change in church policy, leafleted the bishops. They also carried 
banners naming 10 prelates and bearing such slogans as "Tell the Truth" 
and "End the Hypocrisy." 
...Bishop Nigel McCulloch condemned the action, calling it an attempt 
to change policy "by the deplorable practice of causing hurt and 
embarrassment to individuals by spreading unsupported innuendos." 

Homosexual protesters stormed into Sunday mass at Westminster Cathedral 
in London, Britain's main Catholic cathedral. The 14 denounced Vatican 
opposition to contraception and released helium-filled condoms that 
floated to the ceiling. By its ban on condoms, the church is condemning 
millions of people to becoming infected with AIDS, Peter Tatchell of 
OutRage shouted at the stunned worshippers. The protesters left after 
10 minutes, news reports said. 

A nondiscriminatory language Bible, which may be published by Oxford 
University Press, is causing a furor in Britain, Reuters reported. The 
new Bible calls Jesus "The Human One" instead of the "Son of Man," and 
refers to God as "Father-Mother." References to the "right hand" of God 
have been removed and replaced with "the mighty hand" in an apparent 
effort to not offend left-handed people. Oxford said a team of scholars 
will decide whether it is suitable for publication in Britain. No 
decision has been made. It is scheduled to be released in the United 
States in February. "It's ludicrous to invent language in this way," 
George Austin, Archdeacon of York, told reporters. 

Two charismatic Christians in Australia were convicted of manslaughter 
in the death of a woman after a weeklong exorcism attempt in the town 
of Horsham. Leanne Reichenbach and David Klingner were sentenced to 
prison terms of four and three months, respectively. Reichenbach's 
husband and a fourth defendant received suspended sentences. In 
addition to praying, the four applied "rough and unwarranted" physical 
force at times to Joan Vollmer, 49, the judge said. Doctors said 
pressure on her carotid artery for four hours when she was held on a 
chair in intense heat triggered a heart attack that killed her. 
...A Pentecostal couple in New Zealand who battered their 12-year-old 
son to death during an exorcism attempt were not guilty of murder, but 
were insane, a jury in New Plymouth decided. Janice Gibson, 33, 
bludgeoned her son Dane repeatedly on the head with a concrete block 
while her husband held the boy down in their back yard last May. The 
parents loved and cared for their child, and didn't know what they were 
doing, their lawyer contended. The pair were ordered to a hospital for 
treatment. 

The murders of three evangelical leaders are being covered up in Iran, 
David Bentley of the Zwemer Institute of Muslim Studies said. The 1994 
slayings of Bishop Haik Hovsepian Mehr, Mehdi Dibaj, and Tateos 
Michaelian (NIRR 7/11) are yet to be solved. Though the Iranian 
government has implicated an Iraqi-based faction of the Mujahideen, 
some Iranian Christians believe the murderers are members of an Iranian 
government security force. "Nobody believes the Mujahideen did it," 
Bentley told NIRR. "They would find other means to embarrass the 
government if they wanted to, but they wouldn't have done this." 
...The Iranian government is responsible for the murders, a source told 
NIRR. Quietly eliminating Christian leaders has been the government's 
practice since worldwide protest after the public hanging of Assemblies 
of God pastor Hossein Soodmand in 1990 (NIRR 12/31/90). 
...Bishop Mehr's widow proclaimed forgiveness for her husband's killers 
at an awards ceremony for the martyr. "In the beginning I could not," 
but eventually, "God enabled me to forgive," Takoosh Mehr said. During 
the ceremony, Sir Fred Catherwood, former vice president of the 
European Parliament, presented the widow with the biannual Religious 
Liberty Award of the World Evangelical Fellowship. A memorial fund to 
assist persecuted Christians in Iran was established in the slain 
bishop's name. 
...Pastors are being forced to refuse Muslims entrance to their 
services, several churches are receiving bomb threats, and only two 
Christian churches in Iran are allowed to hold services in Farsi, the 
most common language in Iran, sources said. As persecution and the 
number of refugees from Iran increase, the Christian minority has been 
reduced to 80,000 compared with an official census count of 310,000 
three years before the 1979 revolution, according to World Christian 
News. 

Christianity is a "lifeless corpse" at a time when Islam is 
"experiencing revival," Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati said in a sermon in 
Tehran. The Iranian cleric's remarks were carried on Tehran radio in a 
report monitored by the BBC. "Christianity is truly lacking in divine 
and religious spirituality, and is an arid and useless movement," he 
was quoted as saying. He attributed part of the blame on centralized 
power invested in the pope. Meanwhile, he added, Islamic revival has 
given Muslims spirituality and strength "for administering the world." 

The president of Germany's Islamic Association protested a government 
decision to drop a Protestant holiday for repentance and prayer. It 
violated "religious feelings of the Christian population," he said. 

Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenie was named to succeed Grand Ayatollah Ali 
Araki, spiritual leader of the world's Shiite Muslims. Araki, who was 
at least 100 years old, died this month. Shiites are about 10% of the 
world's 1 billion Muslims. 

A pastor was jailed in Egypt for allegedly trying to convert Muslims, 
Assemblies of God officials report. AG pastor William Gayyid prayed 
with three Muslim women after services at his church in Cairo, and was 
arrested shortly thereafter. Gayyid is yet to be formally charged and 
is being held in Tora Prison, described by former prisoners as "a 
hellhole" of torture, deprivation, and starvation. Unofficially he is 
charged with using women to further his cause, preaching to Muslims, 
using magic to heal and deliver, and using religion to gather money for 
personal gain. Church authorities see the arrest as a direct assault on 
religious rights and are seeking Gayyid's release. 

Two Baptists from the Philippines were released and sent home after 
three months in a jail in Saudi Arabia, where they had been contract 
workers. They had been arrested by Saudi religious police for hosting a 
Bible study in their home (NIRR 10/3). 

A Pakistani Christian has been released by the country's high court. 
Gul Masih (NIRR 3/8/93), 44, was falsely accused and convicted of 
blasphemy against the Muslim prophet Muhammad, the court ruled, and set 
him free that day. The ruling will discourage Muslim fundamentalists 
from lodging false charges, said defense attorney Naeem Shakir. Justice 
Falak Sher expressed disbelief that the plaintiff would wait two full 
days to lodge blasphemy charges when, in some cases, those accused of 
blasphemy are killed on the spot. 

A shipment of 100,000 shoe boxes full of toy cars, dolls, school 
supplies, clothes, and candy was being shipped starting Dec. 8 to 
children in Rwanda and Bosnia in Operation Christmas Child. Samaritan's 
Purse, an international relief organization headed by Franklin Graham, 
and USAir, will fly 20,000 boxes from Charlotte, N.C., to Frankfurt, 
Germany. There they will be loaded onto trucks and shipped to Zagreb, 
Croatia, for distribution there and in Bosnia. The rest of the boxes 
are to be delivered by Dec. 18. For two years, Samaritan's Purse has 
operated the Samaritan's Children's Village, which cares for hundreds 
of Rwandan orphans, and a 72-bed field hospital in Bosnia. The 
organization has supplied $10 million worth of aid to the 
war-devastated regions. 

An unemployed Brazilian mother of seven burned a winning lottery ticket 
worth nearly $60,000 after her pastor urged her to do so, Brazilian 
newspapers reported. Maria Benoiza Nascimento, 39, said "Pastor Wagner" 
of an Assembly of God church in Fortaleza warned in a service that she 
could end up in hell if she went to Sao Paulo to collect her winnings. 
Church members chanted, "Burn it, burn it," she told reporters. She 
said her unemployed husband beat her when he found out what she had 
done. Newspapers said she had a change of heart and was negotiating 
with lottery organizers to see if she could get the money after all. 

A popular Beijing pastor was forcibly removed from his pulpit during a 
Sunday service, The Associated Press reported. Yang Yudong, in his 70s 
and senior pastor of Gangwashi church, long has irritated authorities, 
sources said. Young members of his congregation participated in the 
1989 Tiananmen Square democracy movement, and he has advocated 
democratic reforms. He also sought to distance his church from the 
government-sanctioned China Christian Council, or the Three-Self 
Patriotic Movement. 
...It was local CCC officials who removed him from the pulpit and 
announced his dismissal as pastor of the church, AP reported. Beijing 
CCC leader Yin Juzeng preached at all three services. AP said 
attendance at the church had grown dramatically under Yang's leadership 
in recent years, and is perhaps the most popular one in Beijing. 
...Yang's ouster followed publication of a letter by six of his church 
members. They told AP they had been subjected to weeks of government 
harassments and beatings. They appealed for worldwide prayer and 
support. The six had urged their congregation to defy government 
attempts to remove the pastor. 

Cambodian police hustled Pentecostal evangelist Mike Evans, 46, and his 
ministry team out of a luxury hotel in Phnom Penh in the middle of the 
night. The group was taken to the airport and put on a flight to 
Bangkok "for their own safety," officials told reporters. Evans, who 
lives in the Dallas suburb of Euless, Texas, had reserved the National 
Stadium for five "miracle" services. 
...Advertisements distributed throughout Cambodia and aired on radio 
and TV promised, "Blind eyes will open, the paralyzed will walk." Wire 
services reported that more than 30,000 people showed up for the first 
service on a Wednesday night; Evans said he was told it was more like 
70,000. The rally ended when crowds surged forward seeking to be 
healed. Authorities canceled the second rally, saying the Khmer Rouge 
had threatened to bomb the stadium. Hundreds of angry people rioted 
outside the hotel, accusing Evans of swindling sick, blind, and 
paralyzed people who had attended the service. Some demanded they 
receive compensation. 
...Evans insisted that the ads did not promise miracles. "Only God can 
heal. I came here to pray," he told an Associated Press reporter. He 
speculated that Buddhist priests may have been worried about losing 
some of their followers.

Southern Baptist leaders have urged Billy Graham to convene a meeting 
of leaders from each Christian denomination and parachurch group to 
develop a unified strategy to share the gospel with every American by 
the year 2000. 
...Graham seemed receptive to the idea during the Atlanta meeting, and 
promised to consider it prayerfully, Southern Baptist Home Mission 
Board President Larry Lewis told Baptist Press. Many denominations and 
groups have evangelistic efforts pegged to the year 2000, and some 
alliances have formed to coordinate projects and serve as information 
centers. As yet, however, no unified national outreach plan is in 
place. 
...Graham's five-day crusade in Atlanta broke barriers between races, 
generations, and denominations, observers said. "Atlanta, like every 
other great city in America, has great problems," Graham told racially 
mixed crowds averaging 62,500 at the Georgia Dome. The church is "the 
one force in the community that could make a change." Atlanta, which 
has a population of 450,000, was named the most-violent city in Money 
magazine's June issue. FBI numbers show it was the sixth-most-violent 
city in the country in 1993 and the worst for its size. 
...Interracial cooperation for this crusade was more evident than 
during Graham's 1950 and 1973 crusades there. It may have been the 
broadest cooperation of any event ever held in the city, organizers 
said. Co-chairmen were W. Frank Harrington, pastor of Peachtree 
Presbyterian Church, and Cameron Alexander, pastor of Antioch Baptist 
Church North, the city's largest African-American congregation. Leaders 
joining Graham on the platform included Coretta Scott King, Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference President Joseph Lowery, Sens. Sam Nunn 
and Paul Coverdell, Gov. Zell Miller, and George Bush, who was in town 
to speak at a motivational seminar. Jimmy Carter was honorary chairman 
of the crusade. 
...An average of 3,450 people a night responded to Graham's invitation 
to make a commitment to Christ. Some 21,500 youth and their parents 
attended a Saturday morning crusade featuring contemporary Christian 
musicians DC Talk and Take 6, and preaching by Graham, who is 76. More 
than 1,800 responded by making a commitment to Christ. 

"George Foreman's miracle" is what the sports world is calling the 
45-year-old heavyweight boxer's 10thround knockout of Michael Moorer, 
26. Foreman, the oldest man ever to fight for the heavyweight 
championship, knelt and prayed in his corner after the fight in which 
he regained the World Boxing Association heavyweight crown. The Nov. 5 
bout took place in Las Vegas almost 20 years to the day after the 1968 
Olympic gold medalist lost the heavyweight title in Zaire to an aging 
Muhammed Ali, who knocked him out. 
...The real miracle came several years ago, observers said. Foreman, 
one of the most powerful punchers in boxing history, was "a mean, ugly, 
cantankerous, horrible person" in his prime fighting days, promoter Bob 
Arum told Newsweek. But the scowling, monosyllabic Foreman changed 
dramatically after he became a Christian several years later. He spent 
a decade preaching the gospel, first on Houston street corners, and 
later in a church he built, The Church of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Foreman decided to enter the ring again in 1987 to support his new 
youth center. He earned about $2 million, a pittance by his past 
standards, for the championship fight. 
...The George Foreman who reentered the ring has been called a 
gracious, articulate man who found it hard to recall, let alone 
comprehend, his earlier nastiness, Newsweek said. Boxing is important 
to Foreman, his 14-year-old daughter Natalie said, but the most 
important thing in his life "is praising God." 

The first complete book of the Bible has been published in Gullah. It's 
called De Good Nyews Bout Jedus Christ Wa Luke Write. The Creole 
language is spoken by some 250,000 African-Americans in the South 
Carolina low country and the North Carolina, Georgia and Florida 
coasts. Although most Gullah speakers use standard English as well, 
there are 20,000 people who speak only Gullah. 
...The American Bible Society, which published the book, offered Luke 
24:6 as an example of the new translation. In the King James version, 
the passage reads: "He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake 
unto you when he was yet in Galilee." In Gullah, the verse reads: 
"Jedus ain't yah. E done git op from mongst de ded, an e da libe gin! 
Oona memba wa e done tell oona wen e been dey wid oona een Galilee." 

To some neighbors of Robert Schuller's Crystal Cathedral in Garden 
Grove, Calif., the twice-hourly ringing every day of the church's $5 
million carillon is a joyful sound. To others, such as Max Stauffer, 
who lives two houses away, it's "the most gosh-awful noise you ever 
heard." Stauffer tried two years ago to have the sounds classified as a 
nuisance under the city's noise standards. Since 1976, the church has 
acquired 19 homes -about one-third of the neighborhood -for employees 
or church members, according to news accounts. Church officials said 
they would meet with Stauffer and neighbor Mark McDaniel to discuss 
their grievance. 
...It's not just the sound that bothers McDaniel, but the selections. 
Instead of sticking to hymns, the bells play such fare as Three Blind 
Mice and I Dream of Jeannie with the Light Brown Hair, he told 
reporters. 

Evangelist Leroy Jenkins, 59, his son David, 30, and six other people 
were arrested in Florida on charges of fraud, burglary, grand theft, 
and racketeering (NIRR 4/19/93). The elder Jenkins was arrested while 
holding a weeklong crusade in Orlando and was released on bail. He is 
pastor of the Healing Hill Cathedral and head of the Leroy Jenkins 
Evangelistic Association, both in Delaware, Ohio. Authorities said the 
case involves a scam in which the younger Jenkins sold expensive 
furniture and other assets of elderly people, mostly in Tampa, on a fee 
basis. Instead, they said, he kept the money. An indictment accused the 
older Jenkins of receiving thousands of dollars worth of goods and 
participating in the scheme. He told reporters he is innocent. (Jenkins 
spent four years in a South Carolina prison after his conviction in 
1979 for conspiracy to commit arson and assault. His son was convicted 
on similar charges in 1988, and released from a Florida jail in 1991, 
news reports said.) 

An unlicensed health insurance operation that allegedly preyed on 
churches and missionaries by taking their premiums and not paying 
benefits was ordered to pay $1 million in restitution and $4 million in 
penalties (NIRR 2/21). A Texas judge ordered the judgment against Paul 
Gelatt, Paul Gelatt, Jr., and Mark Gelatt, Sr. The trio, also under 
indictment on related criminal charges, operated San Antonio-based 
International Benefits Association and several related companies. The 
firms were barred by court order in December from selling insurance in 
Texas. They reportedly were among the largest providers of health 
insurance to missionaries and their church sponsors since 1990. 

Middle East terrorists quietly are being presented with the gospel by 
Brother Andrew. The Dutch evangelist, known for smuggling Bibles into 
the former Soviet Bloc, for several years has traveled throughout 
predominantly Muslim countries, forming relationships and testifying 
about his faith in Christ. 
...Andrew is "on personal terms" with militants from Hezbollah in 
southern Lebanon, he told a Regent University missions conference in 
Virginia Beach last month. He often preaches and distributes Bibles to 
terrorists, who receive them eagerly, he said. He also meets with 
Hamas, the group that launched attacks against Israeli civilians to 
disrupt the peace process. Andrew has been asked to mediate between 
Hamas and the chief rabbi of Jerusalem, he said. 
...The young terrorists Andrew befriends act hardened and tough, he 
said. "They try to grow a beard like Khomeini's and carry a big gun. 
They tell me, `Me, Khomeini.' I say, `Me, Jesus.'" The head of Open 
Doors said that when he arrives at a headquarters of the terrorists, 
young men leave their houses. Soon there is a crowd waiting to receive 
Bibles and hear him speak. Recently he preached in Gaza to 400 Hamas 
members. Andrew said he considers terrorists desperate, neglected, 
displaced refugees, with no hope and sorely in need of Jesus Christ. 
..."The issue is Jesus. They (the Hamas) openly declare jihad (holy 
war) on the Lamb of God." Eventually, Islam will join forces with the 
remnants of communism and even with nominal Christianity, he said. 
Radical Muslims believe that Islam will conquer and rule the world, "so 
that any act of terrorism will be greeted with joy because they see it 
ushering in their kingdom," he said. 
...Andrew warned Christians in the West that they must find ways to 
form loving relationships with Muslims. Otherwise "they will come to us 
in judgment." He said Christians must "embrace them, including their 
guns, black beards, and hearts full of negative motivation." When 
Muslims see the beauty of Jesus, they will "forget everything about 
Muhammad." 

Parents of an Israeli soldier who was killed by his militant Islamic 
captors are not seeking revenge. Instead, they are opening a school to 
spread religious tolerance. 
...Esther and Yehuda Waxman endured the agony of their kidnapped son's 
death four days after they watched him beg for his life on video. Sgt. 
Nachshon Waxman, 19, was lured into a van outside Tel Aviv. His Hamas 
captors later killed him after a failed Israeli raid on their West Bank 
hideout. Nachshon hated conflict and fights, and was called "The Baby" 
by soldiers in his unit because he was skinny and didn't let them 
argue, his parents told The Associated Press. Their school will "teach 
youth from around the world about tolerance," they said. Muslims, 
including Hamas, are welcome. 

President Clinton addressed the Jordanian parliament during his visit 
to Amman, a first for an American president. He said the United States 
respects Islam as "one of the great religions in this cradle of 
civilization." But he attacked terrorists who "cloak themselves in the 
rhetoric of religion," saying, "You will not succeed: you are the past, 
not the future." 
...Prominent pastors, including Southern Baptist Convention President 
Jim Henry, accompanied Clinton to witness the historic peace treaty 
signing outside of Jerusalem Oct. 26. During his speech, Clinton mixed 
two beatitudes into a single misquote: "Blessed are the peacemakers, 
for they will inherit the earth." 

The Vatican established official ties with the Palestinian Liberation 
Organization. Coming 10 months after the Vatican recognized Israel 
formally, the move guarantees the Holy See a place in the Middle East 
peace process. It also boosts the cause of PLO leader Yasser Arafat and 
other more moderate Palestinians over radical opponents of peace, 
spokesmen said. A joint statement said the agreement will enable the 
Catholic Church to carry out its "spiritual, educational, and social 
service" among Palestinians. Both sides pledged to preserve "religious 
and cultural values" of the Holy Land and Jerusalem. 

Twenty-five years of conflict in Northern Ireland have left the 
Protestant church there "weary and visionless," said Howard Lewis, 
general secretary of the Northern Ireland Evangelical Alliance. But 
cease-fires by the Irish Republican Army and loyalist paramilitaries 
have caused Christians to see the hand of God at work again, he told 
NIRR. "God has given His church as a clear reminder of His sovereign 
power." 
...Cynics long have used fighting between Catholics and Protestants in 
Northern Ireland to "pour scorn on the Christian faith," even though 
the conflict has been more political than religious, Lewis said. The 
cease-fires remove that "false excuse for rejecting the Christian 
faith." 
...Peace will allow freedom for Protestants to enter Catholic areas of 
the province, and make people more relaxed about going out at night to 
attend evangelistic meetings, he said. Evangelist Luis Palau is to lead 
a crusade there next year. While Protestants in Northern Ireland have 
been indifferent to spiritual things, Catholics show a "most amazing 
hunger for the truth," Lewis said. 

Religious leaders from 30 countries called for creation of a world 
council of religions. Meeting in Khartoum, Sudan, last month, the 
leaders said such a council would enable major religions -- in 
particular Christianity and Islam -- to join forces against materialist 
and secularist world views, Ecumenical News International said. 
...Muslims are showing new interest in interreligious dialogue since 
September's United Nations population conference. Hassan Al Turabi, 
head of National Islamic Front of Sudan, said Christians and Muslims 
should form a coalition to "offer an alternative model of society" and 
"a new political world order." 

Amid rising tensions between members of their groups in Eastern Europe, 
Baptist and Orthodox leaders conferred last month in Istanbul. Their 
three days of talks explored respective historical roots and beliefs. 
Baptist World Alliance officials said their aim was to open later 
discussions that would include such divisive issues as evangelism. The 
Orthodox accuse Baptists of "sheep-stealing." 
...In Eastern Europe, especially Bulgaria, local Orthodox leaders have 
described Baptists as "a heretical sect" and charged that Baptists kill 
babies (NIRR 6/14/93). Theo Angelov, president of the Baptist Union of 
Bulgaria, said he was encouraged to hear Metropolitan Ioachim, the 
patriarchal vicar, greet Baptist leaders as "our esteemed and dear 
brothers in Christ." Ioachim said the way ahead could be "long and 
painful," but held out hope if people's hearts are open to "the 
guidance of the Holy Spirit." 

Seventh-Day Adventists and members of Pentecostal denominations, 
specifically the Assemblies of God, are not "of the Christian 
tradition," according to the leader of the Greek Orthodox Church of 
North and South America. Archbishop Iakovos named others in that 
category as Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, Christian Scientists, Jews, 
Muslims, Buddhists, and adherents of cults and New Age movements. The 
archbishop made the statement in a letter to Orthodox pastors and 
priests, published in the Orthodox Observer. He said Orthodox canons 
forbid marriages between Orthodox Christians and non-Christians to be 
blessed or recognized. 
...A "concerted effort," possibly "orchestrated by the Patriarch of 
Constantinople," is opposing Pentecostals because of their influence in 
Orthodox nations, said Peter Vourliotis. He directs Oakland, 
Calif.-based Greeks for Christ. "We don't need that," he told NIRR. 
"Fighting between ourselves doesn't do any good." 

Having an abortion raises risk of breast cancer by 50%, according to a 
seven-year study of 1,800 women. It is one of the largest studies to 
examine the link between abortion and cancer. Research was done by a 
team from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute in Seattle and 
headed by pro-choice epidemiologist Janet Daling. It is published in 
Journal of the National Cancer Institute. 
...Teen-age girls who had abortions after the eighth week of pregnancy 
have a greater-than-average risk of developing breast cancer. For them, 
the risk of getting breast cancer before age 45 went up 800%, Daling 
told Time magazine. That figure was not included in the report because 
more research needs to be done, she said. 
...The number of new cells in the breast increases dramatically early 
in pregnancy. These young, growing cells are especially vulnerable to 
malignancy, researchers say. In later stages of pregnancy, a woman's 
body releases hormones that help the cells mature, making them less 
susceptible to cancer, Time said. An abortion is thought to interrupt 
the production of these protective hormones. 

The rate of teens giving birth in the United States has dropped for the 
first time since 1986, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
reported. From 1986 to 1991, the rate had increased 27%. In 1992, the 
latest year surveyed, the rate dipped 2%, the CDC said. It reported 
60.7 births for every 1,000 women aged 15-19, down from 62.1 the year 
before. Statisticians speculated that a trend toward abstinence and 
increased use of condoms might explain the drop. 

"An evil action" should not benefit people, even if it did happen years 
ago, said British Catholic priest Leo Chamberlain, who heads an elite 
Catholic school in northern England. Tissue from an aborted fetus was 
used in Britain in the 1960s to develop a combined mumps, measles, and 
rubella vaccine. Health officials say no fetal tissue is present in the 
vaccine today. But, says Chamberlain, "murder 20 years ago is still 
murder." He has withdrawn his school from a national immunization 
program. Dr. Kenneth Calman, the country's chief medical officer, 
warned that outbreaks of rubella among young men last year had resulted 
in an increase of rubella infections among pregnant women. Such 
infections in early pregnancy place those fetuses at higher risk of 
congenital defects, he said. Catholic bishops announced that there is 
"no general obligation" on church members to refuse consent for their 
children to be immunized. 

Paul Hill should go to the electric chair. That is the recommendation 
of the Pensacola, Fla., jury that found him guilty this month of the 
murders of abortion doctor John Britton and his escort, James Barrett. 
Final sentencing is next month. Hill broke his long courtroom silence 
when he read a four-sentence statement before sentencing: "You have a 
responsibility to protect your neighbor's life, to use force if 
necessary to do so. In an effort to suppress this truth, you may mix my 
blood with the blood of the unborn and those who have fought to defend 
the oppressed. However, truth will prevail. May God help you to protect 
the unborn as you would want to be protected." The statement closely 
paralleled that of abolitionist John Brown, who was hanged for his 
violent opposition to slavery in the 19th century. Leading pro-choice 
advocates oppose death for Hill, saying it would turn him into a 
martyr. 
...Michael Hirsh, an attorney who wrote an article for the law review 
at Regent University arguing that killing abortion doctors could be 
justifiable homicide (NIRR 9/5), was fired from the American Center for 
Law and Justice. Keith Fournier, executive director of the ACLJ, said 
Hirsh was fired for offering to put the article's ideas into practice 
at Hill's murder trial. Hirsh raised the possibility of an appeal on 
grounds that Escambia County Circuit Judge Frank Bell erred by barring 
Hill's justifiable homicide defense. Regent and the ACLJ have condemned 
the Florida killings. 

Michigan's charter school law (NIRR 10/31) was struck down as 
unconstitutional. A Lansing judge ruled that in order to pass 
constitutional muster and qualify for state funding a school must be 
"under the immediate, exclusive control" of the state Board of 
Education and open to any student who wants to attend. Republican Gov. 
John Engler said he would appeal the decision. 

"Thou Shalt Not Bore Kids" is the first commandment for Bonnie Aldrich, 
1994's Henrietta Mears Sunday School Teacher of the Year. The national 
award is named for the teacher who founded nondenominational Gospel 
Light Publishers after becoming frustrated by the lack of high quality 
Sunday school materials. Aldrich teaches at Pulpit Rock Church, a 
Conservative Baptist congregation in Colorado Springs. 
..."Anyone who thinks of Sunday school as a warm-up for the eternal 
torment of hell has not been to Bonnie Aldrich's class, the Kids 
Clubhouse," wrote Steve Rabey, religion editor of the Gazette Telegraph 
in Colorado Springs. Classes are fastpaced so the kids don't have time 
to be bored. The classroom is crammed with used furniture, old license 
plates, spare tires, hub caps, soda cans, a basketball hoop, and other 
odds and ends used as props for her lessons. 

 Charles Swindoll was installed Oct. 27 as president of Dallas 
Theological Seminary, a leading conservative evangelical school. 
Swindoll has written more than 40 books and is a radio pastor known to 
millions for his Insight for Living broadcasts. Speakers at an 
inaugural conference on the theme "Charting A Bold Course" included 
Charles Colson and James Dobson. Swindoll, a graduate of the seminary, 
succeeds Donald Campbell as the fourth president in the institution's 
70-year history. 

Satanic rituals -- cults sacrificing animals and babies and engaging in 
perverted sex and cannibalism -- usually are figments of the 
imagination, the first in-depth national survey on the subject found. 
The survey of 11,000 psychiatric and police workers was directed by 
psychologist Gail Goodman of the University of California at Davis, and 
was conducted for the National Center for Child Abuse and Neglect. 
...Not a single case was found to substantiate reports of a nationwide 
network of satanic groups of people who prey on the young and sexually 
abuse them. While one would not expect to find corroborating evidence 
in many sexual abuse cases, there would be evidence when "people claim 
the rituals involve murders and the reported cases come from district 
attorneys or police," Goodman told The New York Times. 
...However, much evidence was found of individuals and couples who say 
they are involved with Satan or use the claim to intimidate victims, 
the researchers said. 

Many pastors are spoon-feeding sentimentality from the pulpit when they 
should be teaching hard truths about suffering and duty, a leading 
ethicist says. Young Christians need to know they will suffer for their 
convictions, said Stanley Hauerwas, professor of theological ethics at 
the Divinity School at Duke University. "You need to say, `It's time to 
die' rather than teaching all this `ultimate concern' bull," the often 
acerbic Hauerwas told a group of pastors and bishops at Evangelical 
Lutheran Church in America-related Roanoke College in Salem, Va. 
...The most important question in the world today is "Who has 
authority? Who can tell us what to do?" Hauerwas said. Pastors often 
fear exercising authority because they don't want to appear 
authoritarian, yet believers need direction, he said. If pastors do not 
reassert the authority of their office, they will face further erosion 
of their ministries, he said. 
...The situation is similar in academia, where "everything is up for 
grabs," Hauerwas said. College students should not be allowed to make 
up their minds, but "should be told they do not have minds worth making 
up," he told a convocation of students. Yet the modern university is 
afraid of students and treats them as "customers they have to please 
rather than people who must submit" to a discipline. 
..."Subjection of talent to discipline produces character," Hauerwas 
told the students. Christianity has answers to ethical issues such as 
college cheating, yet those answers are not being taught, he said. 

Religious harassment in the workplace will not be permitted by the 
government, despite withdrawal of Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission guidelines (NIRR 10/3). "Guidelines or no guidelines, we're 
going to enforce the law," Gilbert Casellas, new EEOC chairman, said. 
...Before Casellas took over, the EEOC withdrew new guidelines designed 
to tell employers what constitutes religious harassment under the 1964 
Civil Rights Act's ban against employment discrimination. Religious 
conservatives, fearing that believers would be prohibited from 
expressing their faith in the workplace, persuaded Congress to pressure 
the agency into withdrawing the guidelines or face a cutoff in funds. 

The Supreme Court agreed to review a case that pits freedom of speech 
and religion against interpretations of the Constitution's 
Establishment Clause. The case involves a student-run Christian 
publication, Wide Awake, at the University of Virginia in 
Charlottesville. School policy bars the use of student activity funds 
for fraternities, sororities, and political and religious organizations 
and activities. In 1990, editor Ronald Rosenberger and other students 
established an on-campus Christian group and published three issues of 
the journal. They distributed 5,000 copies of each issue free of 
charge. After the university rejected their request for $5,862 from 
student activity funds to pay for printing, they turned to the courts. 
At the time, student activity fees were allocated to 118 organizations, 
including Muslim Students Association, Jewish Law Students Association, 
C.S. Lewis Society, and 15 student publications. Rosenberger claimed 
the school's action violated his constitutional free-speech rights 
under the First Amendment. 
...Several court rulings however, upheld the ban. A federal appeals 
court agreed the school's policy discriminates against religious 
speech. But it said the policy was justified by the state school's need 
to separate church and state. In its appeal to the high court, the 
Christian group said it was being singled out unfairly. The 
Constitution, the students contended, "stands for neutrality, not 
hostility, toward religion." The case is the first church-state dispute 
the high court has accepted for its 1994-95 term. [Rosenberger v. 
Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, 94-329.] 
...In other action, the high court refused to hear the appeal of 
Anchorage, Alaska, rental agent Tom Swanner, who said it is against his 
Christian beliefs for him to rent to unmarried couples. Justice 
Clarence Thomas in a lone dissent voted to hear the case. Alaska's 
highest court ruled last May that enforcing fair housing laws does not 
deprive Swanner of his right to free exercise of his religion. 

A network of law firms around the world that promote freedom of 
religion, speech, and assembly is being initiated by the American 
Center For Law and Justice. Keith Fournier, ACLJ executive director, 
said he expects to see the centers opening in several countries in the 
next 10 years. They would be coordinated through an International 
Center for Law and Justice, he said. 
...Canadian Center for Law and Justice opened in Ottawa in June 1993. 
It is temporarily being underwritten by the ACLJ. Also, attorneys in 
the Philippines, Mexico, Australia, Russia, England, Egypt, Ireland, 
and Latin America have contacted the ACLJ for help, Fournier said. 

Mary was not a virgin when she bore Jesus, the Jesus Seminar (NIRR 4/4) 
concluded. The New Testament scholars concluded unanimously that Mary 
had sexual relations before she became pregnant with Jesus. The 
controversial academics disagreed on whether Jesus' biological father 
was Joseph or someone else, Religion News Service said. The 70-80 
Protestant and Catholic academicians meet twice yearly and vote on 
aspects of Scripture using paper ballots or colored beads dropped into 
a ballot box. 
...During their five-day meeting, the academics also concluded that 
Jesus did not descend from King David and was not born in Bethlehem. 
They said the visit of the Magi and the account of the flight of the 
family into Egypt are fabrications, that Jesus was not born at the time 
of a census described in Luke, and the slaughter of the infants 
described in Matthew did not happen. 
..."The Bible's report of the virginal birth of Jesus is reliable 
history," Bruce Corley, dean of the school of theology at Southwestern 
Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, told RNS. Corley 
indicated that an international team of more orthodox scholars plans a 
response within a year. 

Feminists continued their theological reformulation project and 
"re-imagined" Jesus at a conference in Minneapolis. The conference, 
much smaller than last year's controversial RE-Imagining conference, 
drew about 500 participants, Religion News Service reported. Some 
feminist theologians say the doctrine that Jesus died for people's sins 
makes God a bystander to abuse, according to conference speaker Rita 
Brock, a member of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and 
associate professor of humanities at United Methodistrelated Hamline 
University, in St. Paul. She asked, if Jesus' death was necessary to 
save people, are the forces of destruction -- the people who hated him 
and killed him -- doing God's will? Sponsors said the conference budget 
was underwritten solely by $14,000 in registration fees. 

The Vatican outlawed use of the ecumenical New Revised Standard Version 
of the Bible in liturgy. It also withdrew permission to use the New 
American Bible Psalter, a new translation of the Psalms in the modern 
Catholic Bible. Observers said the Vatican long has been upset by use 
of gender-neutral language in the volumes. Critics said the action 
undermines authority of U.S. bishops, who in 1991 approved the NSRV for 
worship. Cardinal William Keeler, president of the National Conference 
of Catholic Bishops, said the order applies to liturgical use only, not 
personal reading or Bible study. The National Council of Churches holds 
copyright for the NSRV, produced in 1989 by an ecumenical team of 
scholars. 

Clarence Pope, Jr., Episcopal bishop of the Diocese of Fort Worth, 
Texas (NIRR 2/8/93), and for years a leader of the Episcopal Church's 
traditionalist wing, has decided to convert to Roman Catholicism. Pope 
said he eventually will seek new status as a Catholic priest. He would 
do that under the Vatican's "pastoral provision," a legal procedure 
under which married Episcopal clergymen may be ordained in the Catholic 
Church. About 55 married Episcopal priests have become Catholic 
clergymen under the provision. 
...The move is unprecedented by a sitting Episcopal Church bishop in 
this century. In 1992, retired Bishop Graham Leonard of London (NIRR 
11/30/92) left the Church of England and became a Catholic priest. The 
Church of England is the central body of the world Anglican communion, 
to which the Episcopal Church belongs. 
...Pope came to believe that the seat of Christian authority had been 
divinely placed in Rome from the time of the Apostle Peter, he said. 
Pope, 65, who is married, had long prayed for "reunion between Rome and 
Canterbury." But when the Church of England voted in 1992 to ordain 
women to the priesthood, he concluded that "the pilgrimage I had longed 
to take corporately would now have to be taken alone." Traditionalists 
believe church leaders overstep their authority by ordaining women, 
because Jesus called only men as apostles. Five years ago, Pope founded 
the Episcopal Synod of America within the Episcopal church to give 
traditionalists an organizational base. 
...Delegates to the Fort Worth diocese convention last month rejected 
moving the diocese out of the Episcopal Church. Bishop Jack Iker, 
Pope's successor, opposed the resolution as too drastic, although he, 
too, is critical of the national church. 

Catholics who divorce and remarry cannot take communion unless they 
abstain from sex, the Vatican said last month in response to a letter 
from German bishops. The bishops had suggested leniency toward divorced 
and remarried Catholics who say they see no conflict between their 
private lives and their faith. In reply, the Vatican's doctrinal 
watchdog, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, reaffirmed 
the church's longheld position. Belgium's bishops, however, defiantly 
announced that their priests should not publicly refuse communion to 
anyone, except in cases of "provocation or grave scandal." It is up to 
a believer's conscience whether to take communion, they said. The 
Vatican explicitly rejected suggestions that the issue could be 
resolved by solutions based on personal conscience. Also, a group of 
leading German Catholics, including premiers from two federal states, 
issued a letter criticizing Rome's "pitiless severity" toward divorced 
believers. The policy is harmful to the church, they said. 

Pope John Paul II appointed 30 new cardinals from 24 countries. They 
bring to 100 the number of cardinals the pontiff has appointed out of 
the 120 under 80 years old who would be eligible to choose his 
successor. The choices increase likelihood that his successor will be 
neither liberal nor Italian, experts said. Appointments appeared to be 
aimed in part at strengthening the church's image in places where it 
was, or is, suffering. These include Bosnia-Herzegovina, Vietnam, Cuba, 
Lebanon, Belarus, and Albania. Three of the new cardinals spent years 
in prison or labor camps in Eastern Europe or the former Soviet Union. 
Five are from heavily Catholic Latin America. Many observers believe 
the next pope should come from that part of the world. 

A lawsuit aimed at blocking election of St. Petersburg, Fla., pastor 
Henry Lyons as president of the 8million-member National Baptist 
Convention USA, Inc., was thrown out by a federal court judge (NIRR 
10/17). The decision lifted a Sept. 29 restraining order prohibiting 
the denomination from conducting day-to-day business. Members of the 
Alabama NBCUSA filed the suit. They claimed that not all eligible 
voters were allowed to participate at the recent national convention of 
the denomination where Lyons, a political activist, was elected to 
succeed T.J. Jemison. Attorneys for Lyons argued that many didn't vote 
because they failed to meet eligibility requirements. 
...In a nine-page opinion, Judge Zinora Mitchell-Rankin ruled that both 
the First Amendment and the NBCUSA's revised constitution "preclude 
judicial inquiry or review of matters involving eligibility to vote." 
She also ordered the denomination and its Alabama convention to work 
out differences by themselves. 
...Lyons' biggest headache immediately is the problem of how to stop 
possible foreclosure on the denomination's new multi-million-dollar 
headquarters in Nashville, Tenn., NBCUSA officials said. The group was 
reportedly hundreds of thousands of dollars behind in note payments as 
of last month. 

Conservative Christians played an important role in the Republican 
sweep of last Tuesday's elections. At stake was the role religion 
should play in public life, along with "the role that religious people 
and values should have in influencing government policy," Christian 
Coalition director Ralph Reed told a National Press Club gathering 
earlier. Arthur Kropp, president of People for the American Way, had 
warned that the 1994 elections "will set a new high water mark for the 
religious right." PAW counted nearly 500 religious candidates running 
for national, state, and local offices. 
...Many Coalition-backed candidates won. Notable exceptions included 
Oliver North's U.S. Senate race in Virginia, and gubernatorial races by 
Jeb Bush in Florida and Michael Huffington in California. Analysts 
pointed out that all three were burdened by ethical questions in their 
background. "Values were below the surface in everything in the 
elections, and will play even more of a role in '96," Democratic 
pollster Celinda Lake told reporters. 
...Despite attempts by opponents to paint them as religious extremists, 
a number of candidates refused to downplay their faith. In South 
Carolina, David Beasley, 37, won the governor's chair in a contest with 
Democratic Lt. Gov. Nick Theodore. Beasley, a former state Democratic 
lawmaker, became a born-again Christian in the 1980s after listening to 
taped Bible readings and reading Christian books. He also switched to 
the GOP. He was a frequent speaker in churches throughout the state, 
telling how his faith changed his life and views. Although Beasley's 
campaign focused more on welfare, taxes, and crime than on religion, 
Theodore warned that a Beasley victory would bring "the popeship of Pat 
Robertson" to state politics. But voters in South Carolina, as in much 
of the religiously conservative South, did not see Christian 
conservatism as a negative factor. 
...In Washington state, GOP state Rep. Linda Smith, a conservative 
Christian, unseated a Democratic congresswoman. Smith did not enter the 
race until September as a primary write-in candidate. In Oklahoma, 
former pro football player Steve Largent won a Republican seat in 
Congress. He said he became a candidate after getting a message from 
God. 
...On the weekend before the election, the Christian Coalition 
reportedly distributed 33 million election guides to 60,000 churches. 
The group also mailed and handed out 15 million "congressional 
scorecards" at churches, polling places, shopping malls, and at various 
weekend gatherings. Democrats complained that the materials distorted 
their views, and that distribution was timed to make it too late for 
rebuttals to be effective. 
..."Don't hesitate to pray imprecatory Psalms over them," wrote Harry 
Valentine, a founder of the Capitol Hill Prayer Alert. The 
Washingtonbased group urged members to invoke such Scriptures, which 
call down evil or God's judgment upon the wicked, against those on its 
"Philistine List." The list included 25 incumbent Democrats who are 
"enemies of Christianity and/or biblical morality." 
...Such prayers are auto-suggestive, said Skipp Porteous of the 
Institute for First Amendment Studies, a group that tracks the 
Christian right. After repeated reinforcement of these prayers, "it 
doesn't take much for a religious fanatic to `hear the voice of God,' 
and go out and shoot someone." 
...Democrats mounted extensive efforts to enlist black churches to get 
out the vote on their behalf. Black clergy in New Jersey and elsewhere 
campaigned on behalf of Democratic candidates. In Texas, Gov. Ann 
Richards, who lost to George W. Bush, spent two Sundays prior to the 
election campaigning in four black churches. She called Bush a 
hypocrite for asking for black votes. 
..."All sides are using churches to the hilt, and they're allowing 
themselves to be used," University of Virginia political scientist 
Larry Sabato said in commenting on the fierce Virginia Senate race. 
North, with a Bible in hand, often began his rallies with a prayer and 
a testimony. During his concession speech, he told supporters that "if 
you keep your trust in the Lord, stay together, and persevere, we can 
yet take back our government," hinting at future runs for office. 
Similarly, incumbent Chuck Robb made the rounds of black churches. The 
Interfaith Alliance, a group partially funded by the Democratic 
Congressional Campaign Committee, fought North vigorously. Exit polls 
showed North received 80% of the evangelical vote; Robb received 
overwhelming support from blacks. 
...Times have changed since 25 years ago, when many Christians felt 
politics and government were so dirty and flawed that a good religious 
person stayed away from them, said Gary Bauer of the Washington, 
D.C.-based Family Research Council. "Today it is the mark of a man or 
woman of faith to be involved," he added. Christian talk radio, whose 
show hosts mimic their secular counterparts, also have exerted a 
growing influence in the last several years. 
..."There is still some breath left in the church-state separation 
body," Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for 
Separation of Church and State, told NIRR. Lynn said he is "just 
devastated" by overall results of the election. But he was heartened by 
Lawton Chiles' victory over Jeb Bush in Florida, since Chiles had "made 
a great point out of protecting public education" and Bush advocated 
vouchers for religious schools. North's loss shows "there is a danger 
when the electorate perceives your candidate as too closely tied to Pat 
Robertson and the Christian Coalition," he said. 
...Ballot initiatives were a mixed story. Wyoming rejected a ban on 
abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the woman's life. 
Oregon's ballot measure to allow the terminally ill to receive lethal 
medication was passed narrowly. 
...In addition, the defeated Wyoming pro-life amendment was the 
"perfect vehicle for determining what the public thinks," Lynn said. 
Oregon's assisted suicide initiative "does not demonstrate that when 
the church speaks on any issue, they are going to win," he said. Oregon 
and Idaho voters rejected measures that would have limited government 
efforts to protect homosexuals from discrimination. But in Alachua 
County, Fla., voters repealed an existing gay-rights ordinance. 
Colorado and Oregon voters rejected proposals to adopt the Supreme 
Court definition of obscenity, which relies on community standards. 
Casino gambling failed in some states, but Missouri and New Mexico 
approved forms of gambling. 
...Richard Cizik, legislative director for the National Association of 
Evangelicals, said prospects turned a lot brighter for progress on 
numerous health, consumer, and safety issues important to religious 
conservatives. He blamed "bare-knuckle politics as petty and detestable 
as the commercials" for blocking initiatives on those issues under the 
Democratic-controlled legislature. The GOP will use subpoenas to "clean 
out" corruption in government, he told NIRR. The public has no idea 
"how bad it is and how badly it has been covered up." 
...Christian conservatives have been "frustrated by constantly losing 
for the last two decades," said Martin Mawyer (NIRR 10/31), president 
of Christian Action Network. But Mawyer and others said Tuesday's vote 
will invigorate Christian conservatives rather than make them 
complacent because "they now see opportunities to win." Mawyer said CAN 
will have new clout to wage "bigger and better battles" on issues such 
as homosexual rights, funding for the National Endowment For the Arts, 
and school prayer. Abortion still is a weak issue for conservatives, he 
said. 
...Lou Sheldon, head of Traditional Values Coalition, said religious 
conservatives will not be lethargic "as long as Bill Clinton is 
around." Sheldon told NIRR the election was a "mandate that valueless 
government does not work." He said the vote also was a referendum 
against government's role in private lives. "Back off, Big Uncle, and 
stop snooping over our shoulders," he said. our shoulders," he said.

A new era of interracial cooperation in American Pentecostalism began 
this month. Black and white Pentecostal leaders formed a nationwide 
association of churches during a conference in Memphis characterized by 
repentance and forgiveness. Analysts said forming the new association 
may be the most important development in the 88-year history of 
Pentecostal Christianity in the United States. 
...Racial division has split Pentecostalism for 70 years. The 
Pentecostal movement began in 1906 at a revival in Los Angeles that 
attracted people of all races and classes. But by the mid-1920s, black 
and white Pentecostals divided into separate churches. When the 
Pentecostal Fellowship was formed in 1948, black churches were not 
invited to join. White Pentecostals have generally shied away from 
politics and civil rights, leaving a legacy of bitterness among blacks. 
...Growing regrets over the divisions prompted leaders two years ago to 
begin exploring possibilities for reconciliation. In Memphis this 
month, delegates disbanded the 46year-old association of 21 
predominantly white denominations, known as the Pentecostal Fellowship 
of North America. It was replaced by a multiethnic organization called 
the Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America. The PCCNA 
includes predominantly black Pentecostal denominations (the Church of 
God in Christ and the United Holy Church of America) and the largest 
predominantly white denominations (the Assemblies of God, Pentecostal 
Holiness Church, and International Church of the Foursquare Gospel). 
...The PCCNA accounts for 10 million of the 15 million Pentecostals in 
the United States. The others belong to independent congregations. 
...Before the vote, church leaders were moved to tears by an act of 
humility and racial reconciliation. White pastor Donald Evans 
unexpectedly stepped forward, knelt, and washed the feet of Bishop 
Ithiel Clemmons, the black minister who leads the Church of God in 
Christ. At the same time, Bishop Charles Blake, the black pastor of the 
West Angeles COGIC, of Los Angeles, washed the feet of Thomas Trask, 
general superintendent of the Assemblies of God. Vinson Synan, dean of 
the Regent University School of Theology, was speaking during the 
session when this occurred. He told NIRR that the act of asking for and 
giving forgiveness exemplified in the washings was one of the most 
moving things he had ever seen. "Everyone was weeping." 
...Synan said a message in tongues also was interpreted by Van Nuys, 
Calif., pastor Jack Hayford. The interpretation was that a movement 
began as one river, separated into two streams and became muddied. Then 
the streams came together again and many more people came to drink from 
it, Hayford said. 
...Some blacks and whites may resist cooperation, but the majority 
won't, observers predicted. Harvey Cox, a Harvard University religion 
professor whose book Fire From Heaven traces the rise of Pentecostal 
spirituality, told the Los Angeles Times that interracial cooperation 
among Pentecostals on the denominational level may take time to filter 
down to local congregations, where there is more autonomy. Most will 
remain black, white, or Latin "for a while, maybe for a long time," he 
said. COGIC's Clemmons said much more needs to be done to unify white 
suburban churches with urban black denominations. 
...A constitution for the group was drafted by Synan and adopted 
unanimously. It set up local chapters in major cities to identify 
leaders and foster fellowship among Pentecostal pastors. An annual, 
interdenominational Pentecost Sunday celebration also will be held 
around the country. 

Racism in the United States is an international human rights issue, 
according to a panel of nine prominent religious leaders and 
human-rights lawyers. Members of the panel, which was sponsored by the 
National Council of Churches and World Council of Churches, are from 
South Africa, Malaysia, Fiji, Barbados, Tonga, Jamaica, Argentina, 
Cameroon, and Zimbabwe. They took a 10-day, seven-city tour of 
impoverished sections of New York, Chicago, Oakland, Calif., 
Birmingham, Ala., El Paso, Texas, Okmulgee, Okla., and Washington, D.C. 
Some 50-75 witnesses at each site described racism in housing, 
employment, health care, education, and the criminal justice system. 
...Aaron Tolen of Cameroon, president of the World Council of Churches, 
expressed surprise at "the gravity of what we have seen." There is 
evidence of "gross and consistent patterns of racism throughout the 
fabric of U.S. society," the group concluded. Donald Woods, the white 
South African whose opposition to apartheid was chronicled in the film 
Cry Freedom, said he was moved by witnesses who wept as they described 
their hurts and the sense that no one was listening to them. Panelists 
asked the United Nations to monitor U.S. improvements in racial 
relations. 

Violence on television is "a very special issue" that affects children, 
and it appears to be related to violence in the streets, Surgeon 
General Joycelyn Elders told church activists who oppose violence. She 
was the opening speaker of a two-hour teleconference produced by the 
United Methodist Church in cooperation with the National Council of 
Churches, the Episcopal Church, Media Action Research Center, and other 
groups. The conference was downlinked to 130 churches, colleges, and 
religious offices across the United States and Canada. Churches and 
leaders must "help parents understand that managing media in the home 
is now part of what it means to be a parent," said Elizabeth Thoman, 
director for the Center for Media Literacy in Los Angeles and founding 
editor of Media & Values magazine. 

Hillary Rodham Clinton says the secular media do not know how to talk 
about religion "except in stereotypes." The press has done "a great 
disservice to many people who are in what is loosely called the 
religious right," she told Newsweek's Ken Woodward. "People who are 
searching for meaning and order in their lives are naturally going to 
be trying to have a theology that gives them answers to difficult 
questions posed by modern times," she said. Whether they identify 
themselves as evangelicals or fundamentalists, it is unfair to 
stereotype, she added. The daughter of a Sunday-school teacher who has 
taught classes herself, she called herself "an old-fashioned Methodist" 
who is proud of her church roots. 
...Clinton said she is "not comfortable" with condom distribution in 
schools. Because families and religions failed in many cases to guide 
and discipline the young, the issue must be addressed, she said. 
Conservative leaders noted that the interview appeared just before 
off-year elections in which a number of Democrats are in trouble. 

Sex education in schools has failed, Barbara Dafoe Whitehead said in 
October's Atlantic Monthly magazine. While that assessment is not new, 
it has seldom been taken seriously in such an influential secular 
publication, observers said. Whitehead, vice president of the Institute 
for American Values, made headlines for a 1993 article in Atlantic 
Monthly titled "Dan Quayle Was Right." It chronicled evidence of the 
destructive effect of divorce on children and criticized the media for 
glorifying nontraditional families. 
...Whitehead found that in New Jersey, which has had a strong 
commitment to comprehensive sex education since 1980, the proportion of 
teen births to unmarried mothers rose from 67.6% in 1980 to 84% in 
1991. Teens who learned about contraceptives tended to use them 
irregularly and unreliably, she said. 
...Whitehead did not claim that sex education caused the situation, but 
that it failed to prevent it. She concluded that sex education works 
best when coupled with moral and practical support. 

Sex shops are being franchised. The South Pointe company, a producer 
and distributor of adult videos and magazines in Cranston, R.I., plans 
to build a national chain of 500-600 "adult entertainment" stores in 
the next five years, USA Today said. The stores will sell X-rated 
videos and magazines, novelties, and men's apparel such as sweat shirts 
and jackets. 
...Stores can expect hefty profits, South Pointe CEO Carl Bruno said. 
Bruno, a former stockbroker, said South Pointe will expand its library 
of films, acquire adult entertainment distributors and stores, and 
produce films and CD-ROM. 

An insurance company is teaching churches to prevent -- or react after 
-sexual abuse by church workers. Brotherhood Mutual Insurance Co. of 
Fort Wayne, Ind., which insures 21,000 congregations, is holding 60 
seminars across the country. 
...An attitude that sexual abuse never could happen leaves 
congregations unprepared when it does, the company said. Churches 
should compose detailed behavior policies before any scandal occurs. 
That document can help prove in court that church workers were screened 
and supervised, the insurance company said. 
...Other suggestions from Brotherhood Mutual include:  Plan what to do 
when charges become public, and know how to deal with the press.  
Don't blame discord in the congregation on those who raise charges.  
Make background checks -- and even FBI checks -- on current and new 
church employees and volunteers.  Make sure two adults are present 
with a group of children until a new employee or volunteer has been 
with the church at least six months.  Confine contacts between adults 
or minors to church settings.  Hire no one who has a history of sexual 
misconduct, even if the person says he has been converted and is living 
a Christian life. A religious conversion carries no weight in court, 
the company said. 

Ordination of practicing homosexuals was rejected by Texas, Oklahoma, 
and New Mexico delegates of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) 
at the denomination's regional convention this month. Members in the 
Southwest Region, the church's largest, make up 10% of membership in 
the 1-million-member denomination. "Just when it seemed that the 
Disciples of Christ were going the way of our ultra-liberal partner 
denomination, the United Church of Christ, this renews hope that sanity 
will prevail," said Kevin Ray, executive director of Disciple Renewal, 
a Lovington, Ill., group within the Christian Church. The renewal group 
contends that denominational officials want closer ties with the UCC, 
but most of the laity does not. The group has challenged the 
denomination to poll members on the issue. A church spokesman responded 
that representatives from every region in the United States and Canada 
voted during the 1985 General Assembly to pursue partnership with the 
UCC. 

Americans should worry more about divorce and less about homosexuality, 
some conservatives are saying. William Bennett told the Christian 
Coalition conference (NIRR 10/3) that in terms of damage to children, 
the homosexual movement cannot be compared with "what divorce has done 
to this society." David Boaz of the Cato Institute scolded conservative 
publications for being "obsessed" with homosexuality. He pointed out 
that Cobb County, Ga., which passed a resolution against homosexuality, 
has a 20% illegitimacy rate and two divorces for every three weddings. 
...Political expediency may prompt conservative political groups to 
show that their social agenda is not confined to a few familiar issues, 
columnist John Leo wrote. But much of the shift also may stem from a 
sense of fairness, Leo said. After targeting homosexuals, women (for 
abortion), and blacks (for illegitimacy), it seems appropriate to "talk 
about a form of social devastation" indulged in by "straight white 
males, with little criticism and absolutely no stigma." 

"At least, misleading; at worst, compromising" of evangelical doctrine: 
that's Michael Horton's response to Evangelicals and Catholics 
Together, or ECT (NIRR 4/4). Horton, head of the Anaheim, Calif.based 
Christians United for Reformation (CURE) drafted Seven Suggestions for 
Evangelical-Roman Catholic Dialogue to point out what he saw as 
theological problems with the landmark document. In assuming doctrinal 
unity, evangelical Charles Colson and former Lutheran now Catholic 
Richard Neuhaus, key drafters of ECT, "found agreement that even 
liberal theologians haven't," Horton said. 
..."The main problem we had was that ECT assumed agreement on the 
doctrine of justification," Horton said. Its "fatal flaw" is that it 
skirts the importance of salvation by faith in Christ alone. This 
distinction makes true ecclesial communion between Catholics and 
Protestants impossible, he said. But CURE does not discourage all 
ecumenical cooperation. Evangelicals and Catholics "have every reason 
to fight together for the divinity of Christ, and on various moral and 
ethical questions." 
...Horton drafted the Seven Suggestions, but author-scholar J.I. Packer 
finalized the statement. Soon after, it was endorsed by 40 leading 
theologians, seminary leaders, and pastors, many of them in the 
Reformed tradition. Among the signers were James Montgomery Boice, John 
Warwick Montgomery, David Wells, Robert Preus, Al Mohler, R.C. Sproul, 
and Irwin Lutzer. 
...Packer signed both documents, seeing the CURE statement as a 
complement to ECT. But Horton views their treatise as a rebuttal. He 
said he and Neuhaus see their respective documents as "mutually 
exclusive." 
...Richard Land, head of the Southern Baptist Christian Leadership 
Commission, was the only other person to endorse both documents. Last 
month, the CLC trustees affirmed his signing of ECT. They unanimously 
disagreed with a motion raised by SBC messenger Robert Good, Sr., of 
Mississippi. Good had suggested the denomination censure Land and Home 
Mission Board President Larry Lewis for their participation, and also 
sought to bar future cooperative or ecumenical efforts. (Lewis was 
affirmed earlier by HMB trustees, although 11 later signed a minority 
dissenting report.) Land told Baptist Press he'd expected that liberals 
would fear Catholic-evangelical cooperation in the "culture war," but 
never anticipated such a venomous attack within the conservative 
denomination. He said he would have consulted with more people before 
signing the document if he'd "had any inkling that it was going to 
cause this kind of controversy." 

In Cobb County, Ga., some signs in stadiums are okay, but others are 
not. A pep banner at Wheeler High School stadium says, "Go Wildcats. 
You're In God's Grip." Mount Bethel United Methodist Church paid the 
Wheeler booster club for space to display the banner and school 
officials approved it. But at nearby Lassiter High School, officials 
refused to allow a banner from the Open Door Fellowship Church of God 
in Marietta. It proclaimed, "Jesus is Lord." They said the church could 
hang a banner, but it should be worded in a way that did not appear to 
be a school endorsement of a religious message. 

An inmate can perform satanic rituals in prison, starting on Halloween, 
a federal judge ruled. Robert Howard is serving a 10-year sentence in a 
minimum-security prison in Jefferson County, Colo., for kidnapping. The 
judge said a federal prison rule barring devil worship is 
unconstitutional. Some of the materials Howard wants -- candles, 
candleholders, incense, a gong, a black robe, a chalice, a short wooden 
staff -- could be used as weapons, prison officials argued. Howard 
plans to hold the rituals once a month from 2 to 5 a.m. He said they 
help him deal with the death of his father, and visualize people's 
deaths in order to purge his anger against them without killing them. 

Branch Davidians will build another church at the Waco, Texas, site 
where cult leader David Koresh and 78 followers died. A spokesman said 
the church will abandon the teachings of Koresh, who believed he was 
the Messiah, and choose a new leader. Surviving Koresh disciples said 
they will fight to lead the new church. 

Muslim protests prompted a Chicago greeting card company, Recycled 
Paper Greetings, to stop selling a card that offended them. The card 
featured a veiled, Arab-looking woman on the cover and contained the 
lines: "So, if you're feeling like Shiite, Don't Mecca big deal out of 
it." Muslim leaders said the card insulted Shiite Muslims, Islam's 
second-largest branch, by comparing them to excrement, and by making 
light of their holy city. Christian and Jewish leaders joined in the 
protests. In issuing a public apology, Recycled Paper -- the 
fourth-largest U.S greeting-card firm -- said the offense was 
unintentional. It also announced it was recalling all unsold stock. 
About 35,000 copies of the card had been sold in some 3,000 stores for 
a year before anyone complained, a company official told Religious News 
Service. 

"We are concerned that there is a political witch-hunt against the 
prolife movement," Patrick Mahoney said. Mahoney, director of the 
Christian Defense Coalition, Flip Benham of Operation Rescue, and Frank 
Pavone of the largely Catholic organization Priests for Life, met with 
Assistant U.S. Attorney General Jo Ann Harris and other Justice 
Department officials for 45 minutes. They said their followers have 
been intimidated by federal marshals in the aftermath of recent 
violence at abortion clinics and accused Justice officials of being 
overly zealous in enforcing the new Freedom of Access to Clinic 
Entrances law. FACE restricts protests around abortion facilities. 
...Harris replied that First Amendment activity, including protests at 
abortion clinics, remains protected, and that "detailed instructions" 
had been developed to protect those rights, a Justice spokesman said. 
The groups were invited to submit complaints of alleged illegal actions 
by marshals to a Justice mediator, as long as they have a factual 
basis, the spokesman added. "The law is going to be developed on a 
case-by-case basis," Harris reportedly told the group. 
...FACE prohibits "force or threat of force by physical obstruction" at 
clinics. But Benham said Harris refused to describe in detail what 
actions demonstrators can and cannot take under the law. "You've got to 
get arrested to find out what the law means," he told NIRR. That 
"creates fear that kills free speech and keeps us off the streets." 
...Mahoney's group also appealed to President Clinton to intervene on 
behalf of Randall Terry, Operation Rescue's founder. Terry faces a 
fivemonth federal prison sentence in connection with an incident at the 
1990 Democratic National Convention. Prolife protesters held out an 
aborted fetus to then-candidate Clinton (NIRR 7/27/92), violating a 
court injunction Democratic officials obtained in New York. Terry was 
convicted of masterminding the action. The Supreme Court rejected his 
appeal. 

Already in prison for wounding Kansas abortion doctor George Tiller 
last year (NIRR 11/29/93), Rachelle "Shelley" Shannon, 38, has been 
indicted for attacks in four other states. Federal grand juries in 
Portland and Sacramento charged her with arson and acid attacks at 
clinics in Oregon, California, Idaho, and Nevada in 1992 and 1993. She 
is serving 10 years for Tiller's shooting. 

Voters in Oregon could make the state the first in the country to 
sanction suicide for terminally ill people. On the ballot in next 
week's elections is Measure 16, the state's Death With Dignity Act. If 
approved, it would allow physicians to prescribe a lethal dose of 
medicine to dying patients who want to end their lives. However, the 
proposal forbids lethal injections, mercy killings, and suicide 
machines. It would be up to the patient to take deadly drugs. Doctors 
prescribing the drugs would be immune from prosecution. The Catholic 
Church is the main group fighting the measure. Catholic leaders say the 
proposal lacks adequate safeguards, doctors could be mistaken in their 
judgment about a patient's condition, and it is wrong for the state to 
approve suicide. 
...The state medical association remains neutral on the issue, but 
doctors say it merely would legalize what many physicians already do 
for terminally ill patients. Polls showed 60% of voters favor the 
measure. 

A despondent husband in rural Indiana was rescued by two computer users 
who live in other parts of the country. The man, 40, put a message on 
the Christian Interactive Network, an electronic bulletin board owned 
by Compuserve, saying his wife no longer loved him and "I am lost." 
...Coming across the message, some computer users began to type in 
prayers. But Sharon Herbitter of Tampa, Fla., was convinced she was 
looking at a suicide note. When she went on-line with her fears for the 
man, Kevin Tupper of Centreville, Va., read Herbitter's note and took 
action. 
...He notified police in the man's hometown of Miami, 60 miles north of 
Indianapolis, Ind., although he did not know the man's address. Miami 
deputies had been called to the home previously on domestic complaints, 
and knew where the man lived. They quickly arrived to find him slumped 
in a pickup truck in the garage with the engine running. 
...The man had listened to a Christian radio program, delaying the 
suicide attempt for a few minutes, Tupper later told NIRR. Police said 
the man would have died if he had breathed the fumes for 20 more 
minutes. He was taken to a hospital and then to a counseling center. 
...Tupper, a member of a charismatic Episcopal congregation, told NIRR 
that when the man subsequently contacted him on-line, he expressed 
gratitude for saving his life.  

Noah Webster Academy (NIRR 7/11), the first "charter school" approved 
under a new Michigan law that encourages innovation in education, has 
been denied state funding. Public school superintendent Robert Schiller 
said the academy's computer link-up, home school format is not 
providing public schooling as the legislation contemplated, but merely 
facilitating home schooling. The academy must have a site for classes 
and certified teachers, Schiller said. 
...The school enrolled 1,714 students around the state. They are taught 
through computers by 15 certified teachers. The school, which opened 
Sept. 1, will continue to operate without state funds -- $4,754 per 
pupil. Schiller approved funding for eight other charter schools in 
Michigan. The Michigan Education Association, the state's largest 
teachers' union, and the American Civil Liberties Union challenged the 
constitutionality of the charter school law. 

Church bus drivers will be required to undergo drug and alcohol testing 
under a new national law. It targets all drivers who operate buses or 
vans and who are required to have a commercial driver's license. The 
law takes effect Jan. 1, 1995, for charitable organizations with more 
than 50 drivers, and a year later for those with fewer than 50. For 
details, write to the Federal Highway Administration, Office of Motor 
Carrier Standards, Room 3107, 400 Seventh St. SW, Washington, DC 20590. 

The new Miss America, Heather Whitestone, is a profoundly deaf 
Christian whose faith motivates all she does. So say pastors and 
friends who have known her in churches in Birmingham and Jacksonville, 
Ala., and in the Baptist campus ministry at Jacksonville State 
University. She has been involved in several ministries to 
hearing-impaired people, Baptist Press reported. Whitestone grew up in 
the Episcopal Church, but started attending a Baptist church in St. 
Louis while attending a school for the deaf there. She also learned 
about God through closed-caption worship services on TV. She made a 
profession of faith in the 11th grade as a member of the youth group at 
Shades Mountain Baptist Church in Birmingham, church sources said. Her 
faith became inseparably linked to her talent in dance, they added. 
Friends in the Tuesday night Baptist worship services at JSU were among 
the first to see her perform the sacred ballet that propelled her to 
the top of the Miss Alabama and Miss America pageants, BP reported. 

Gospel singer Michael English, whose extramarital affair with gospel 
singer Marabeth Jordan led to his departure from Christian music (NIRR 
5/16), has recorded Healing with country singer Wynonna Judd. Copies of 
the song were sent to adult contemporary radio stations this month. 
...A few days after English returned his Dove Awards, including artist 
of the year, Wynonna announced her pregnancy and voiced her support for 
English's honesty. "Michael and I are not preachers. We are teachers," 
she said. English also is working on a mainstream album to be released 
by Curb Records. 

Recording artist Carman performed a free concert for 71,132 people at 
Texas Stadium Oct. 22 in what may be the biggest event in the history 
of contemporary Christian music. Security police turned many fans away 
from the packed stadium, causing traffic jams that stretched for five 
miles. Concertgoers came from five states to hear the mix of rock, 
hiphop, and rap at the home of the Dallas Cowboys. Some in attendance 
had camped out in the parking lot the night before. The crowd was 
nearly evenly divided between people over 30 and under 30. 
...Surrounded by dancers, Carman performed in the round beneath a big 
TV screen and lights. Christian fans had given concert tickets to 
friends who were not believers, and about 5,000 people came forward 
during the invitation. The concert was part of Carman's 85-city Raising 
the Standard tour, which has drawn 910,000 people, his record company, 
Sparrow Communications, said. The tour will continue in 10 more cities 
and close Nov. 18 in Tulsa, Okla. So far on the tour, nearly 40,000 
people have come forward to make first-time decisions for Christ, 
Joseph Jones, Executive Director of Carman Ministries, told NIRR. 
...Also, 650,000 Carman fans have signed a petition requesting a 
constitutional amendment favoring voluntary prayer in public schools. 
It will be presented at the White House at the end of the tour. 

Youth in the church think and act as their peers in some ways and 
unlike them in others, a Southern Baptist survey in Texas suggests. 
Some 96% of respondents said they attended church at least once a week, 
and 90% affirmed their faith in Christ. 
...On suicide, like many of their peers, 40% said they had either 
thought about (27%), planned ways of (6%), or tried (7%) taking their 
own lives, Associated Baptist Press reported. Of those who had thought 
about suicide, 39% said problems at home led them to consider it, while 
22% cited loneliness as the reason. 
...However, church youth were less likely than their friends to engage 
in risky behavior: 72% said they do not drink alcohol (half said their 
closest friends drink); 85% said they had not had sexual intercourse 
(nearly half said their friends are sexually active); 95% said they 
don't use illegal drugs (18% said some of their close friends are drug 
users); and more than 80% said they do not smoke. 
...Twenty percent of those who had sexual intercourse said they had 
been forced to -- half by a friend or acquaintance, one-third by a 
father, stepfather, or other relative. Among other findings: half 
believe abortion always is unacceptable; nearly 60% consider AIDS an 
issue that affects them; and about three-fourths said they welcome more 
information about AIDS from their churches. 

New England pastors aren't sure how well they're doing their jobs. 
Although 97% who responded to an Evangelistic Association of New 
England survey said their work is meaningful and enjoyable, changes in 
pastoral duties left 47% wondering if they have the right training or 
skills. 
...Pastors feel pulled in new directions. Ministers once focused on 
preaching, teaching, and leading people in prayer. But now, they say, 
they also must be social workers, fundraisers, counselors, and 
community outreach coordinators. More than 60% said their 
congregation's commitment to prayer and ministry to the unchurched is 
well below their expectations. They also said congregations were not 
thinking to the future. 
...Two-thirds believed their churches no longer had much impact on 
their society. New Englanders are in "a serious state of soul 
searching," inner confusion, conflict, and change, but pastors say 
churches have not risen to meet spiritual needs at such a "defining 
moment," said Mark MacDonald, EANE's director of church leadership 
services. Their congregants often resist change, the pastors said. Many 
parishioners want the church to remain as it has been, even though the 
world is changing, MacDonald's study showed. Trying to lead hesitant 
churches to change while remaining faithful to Scripture is sapping 
pastors' "spiritual vitality," he said. Only 52% expressed contentment 
with their own spiritual progress, largely due to competing demands and 
a lack of time. 
...Isolation and busyness also are obstacles to effectiveness, the 
study showed. More than 50% of pastors said they often feel "on their 
own," but want to work more with other clergy and lay leaders. But just 
as church programs and pastoral responsibilities are expanding, so are 
the schedules of laypeople who might be expected to assist, EANE found. 
...Until ministers are better integrated into the community of 
believers, receive more help from them, and get more time away from 
ministry, churches should expect increasing pastoral burnout, MacDonald 
said. 

Arlie Davis, soft-spoken pastor of Christ Wesleyan Church in rural 
Milton, Pa., was named 1994 Pastor of the Year by Under His Wing 
Ministries. Davis' congregation has nearly tripled, to approximately 
500, in the six years he has been pastor. 
...The 43-year-old father of two prays for two hours at the church 
every Saturday. Davis walks by pews, chairs, and benches praying for 
each person who will come to the service the next day. During those 
times, he also asks the Lord to prepare his own heart. Prayer has 
radically improved his effectiveness and his relationship with the 
church, he said. "The temptation is to prepare everything else but the 
biggest thing, your heart," he told NIRR. "If a pastor can't pray, he 
can't speak to his people for God." A few men from the congregation 
join him on Saturday nights, and some 1015 men pray on Sundays before 
the service. He credits attendance of 100 men from his congregation at 
recent Promise Keepers conventions for their commitment to prayer. 
... Under His Wing, a Williamsport, Pa.-based ministry designed to 
encourage pastors, missionaries, and Christian lay workers, received 
nominations from nine states for the annual award. Entries are sent in 
by congregants, and winners are chosen by a three-person committee. 

Police in the Bronx, N.Y., are getting a different kind of backup help. 
Parishioners at St. Luke's Episcopal Church "adopted" their local 
precinct, inviting them to special services and praying for them each 
Sunday. St. Luke's members also encourage other congregations to adopt 
police. They say that it can help bring the city closer together, 
especially at a time when officers in other neighborhoods have been 
arrested for corruption. 
...Police say they like the idea of being kept in people's prayers. 
"That we all get home safely, that's the prayer we need," Deputy 
Inspector James McShane of the 47th Precinct told The New York Times. 
In addition to its spiritual effects, the idea has forged better ties 
to the precinct. Police use the church auditorium for meetings and 
other activities, and police and clergy meet monthly to discuss 
neighborhood hot spots and how to keep youth out of trouble. 

Some 3,000 volunteers from the United States and Canada are gathering 
Oct. 31-Nov. 2 at a warehouse in Lancaster, Pa., to sort, count, and 
pack boxes of school supplies to be sent to Russian children. Each 
"carebox" will contain supplies such as pens, paper, crayons, glue, 
compasses, and rulers donated by families in the United States and 
Canada. 
...Josh McDowell Ministries, part of Campus Crusade for Christ, is 
coordinating Operation Carelift. The group will donate a children's 
Bible storybook, 90-day supply of children's vitamins, gospel bracelet, 
and a copy of McDowell's book More Than a Carpenter to each box. Last 
year, 3,014 volunteers prepared 38,848 boxes in the Lancaster 
warehouse. 

A "flying hospital" -- an airplane that can transport the equivalent of 
a 200-500 bed medical facility to remote areas of the world -- is being 
outfitted by Operation Blessing International. The Virginia Beach 
reliefand-development corporation is affiliated with Pat Robertson's 
CBN. 
...Facilities in the plane, formerly used for commercial service, will 
enable short-term volunteer doctors and dentists to provide general 
care and surgery around the world. Healthcare professionals also will 
educate medical workers in underdeveloped countries. The airplane's 
interior can be altered quickly to accommodate operating rooms, 
post-operation areas, equipment, or seating and sleeping areas to meet 
needs in each destination. After the plane lands, staff and equipment 
can be trucked to even more remote regions. The plane will fly its 
first mission, to Romania, in November. Full modifications are to be 
completed by late 1995. 

The new Billy Graham School of Missions, Evangelism, and Church Growth 
was dedicated at Southern Baptist Seminary in Louisville, Ky. The 
school is the first of its kind in the Southern Baptist Convention. It 
offers masters of divinity and theology degrees and doctorates in 
ministry and philosophy. 

Gone is the sign over the hotel registration desk that proclaimed 
"Jesus is Lord." And gone is the PTL-era name of the hotel itself. The 
501room Heritage Grand in Fort Mill, S.C., is now the Radisson Grand 
Resort. Malayan United Industries, which has owned the now-New Heritage 
USA for nearly four years, announced the change this month. Former 
Heritage Ministries executive Don Edwards called the change "a 
forerunner for deleting the Christian environment." However, the owners 
insisted it will still be known as a religious family resort. 

Missionary women will become midwives in order to save dying babies and 
young mothers in the Third World. Women are signing up for a 16-month 
midwifery and health-care course sponsored jointly by Youth With A 
Mission and the Vineyard Christian Fellowship's Institute of Maternal & 
Child Health, in Santa Teresa, N.M. Graduates of the Missionary Midwife 
program, which will start in August, will work in Africa and Asia. 
...The effort is a response to the United Nations population conference 
in Cairo last month (NIRR 9/19), which called for, among other things, 
wider access to abortions in poor countries with large populations. It 
is "extremely scary" that politicians see people as a "drain on the 
earth," said Vicki Penwell, a licensed midwife who will run the course. 
"Would people in America and Western Europe be willing to let their 
babies die to help the so-called population problem? Of course they 
wouldn't," she told YWAM Press. 

Strict regulations on advertising in nonprofit mail (NIRR 1/24) have 
been overturned. President Clinton signed a law that reverses postal 
rules. They would have kept charities from using third-class postage 
for mail that contained paid advertisements for goods and services not 
directly related to the group's mission. Lawmakers said the ban never 
was meant to keep charities from using paid ads to offset the cost of 
their periodicals. 

Negotiations broke down, and the Federal Election Commission is suing 
Lynchburg, Va.-based Christian Action Network (NIRR 7/25). The FEC 
charges that CAN improperly funded partisan advertisements during the 
1992 presidential campaign. Organizations that are tax-exempt are 
prohibited from using contributions to support the election or defeat 
of a political candidate. CAN ran a series of radio spots and newspaper 
ads that claimed then-Democratic nominee Bill Clinton supported job 
quotas and special rights for homosexuals. CAN President Martin Mawyer 
insisted that the ads did not support any political candidate. The FCC 
sued, he said, after he failed to agree to a proposed settlement that 
CAN pay a $125,000 fine. The suit seeks $1.26 million in penalties. CAN 
says it has about 60,000 active supporters. It reported $2.2 million in 
revenues last year. 

The Christian Children's Fund is spending 80% or more of the money it 
raises from donors on programs for needy children and their families, 
two charity-watchdog groups said. The Richmond, Va., group has been 
defending itself from charges by ousted board member Thomas Naylor that 
it misrepresents what it spends on the programs and misuses funds (NIRR 
9/19). The National Charities Information bureau, located in New York, 
said its review of the group's financial statements and other documents 
supports CCF's statements. The American Institute of Philanthropy, in 
St. Louis, said CCF spends 80% of donor money on the programs, although 
the figure may be closer to 70% when overhead for overseas offices is 
taken into account, The Chronicle of Philanthropy reported. 

Americans gave less time and money to charitable causes last year, a 
Gallup survey for Independent Sector found. Although 73% of households 
(71.5 million) reported charitable contributions in 1993, the average 
amount dropped to $880, down from $978 in 1989. For the first time, 
giving by Catholics ($508, or about 1.2% of household income) fell 
below that of people claiming no religious affiliation ($848), the 
survey showed. Other findings: Protestants gave $969 (2.5% of household 
income), down from $1,014 in 1991. Jews, Muslims, and those of other 
religious affiliations gave an average of $1,406, up by $328 from 1991. 
Independent Sector president Sara Melendez blamed the decline on 
people's insecurity about their financial well-being, and on changes in 
tax laws that reduced the number of itemizers. Survey respondents who 
intended to claim a charitable deduction gave 2.6% of their average 
household income, compared with 0.7% given by those who did not intend 
to itemize. 

Restaurants run by charities offer an alternative to soup kitchens. 
Fresh flowers, china, and waiters who know the diners' names give more 
of a sense of dignity to poor and hungry people, supporters say. Eight 
such restaurants are in operation and 10 are planned, according to The 
Chronicle of Philanthropy. 
...Religious groups operate many of the restaurants. In Boca Raton, 
Fla., a retired store owner helped raise $150,000 and persuaded an 
architect and contractor to donate their services to construct the 
3,600-square-foot Caf  Joshua. The restaurant will be run by a 
coalition of area churches and synagogues that recruit full-time 
volunteers to do most of the work. 
...Diners often are charged a small amount for each meal, and sometimes 
can avoid meal charges by working in the restaurant. In Portland, Ore., 
clients can pay for their meals at Sisters of the Road caf  with 
vouchers that local businesses sell for people to give to panhandlers 
instead of cash. 
...In addition to food, services include job training aimed at helping 
the homeless develop an employable skill. Bread and Roses Caf , run by 
St. Joseph's Center, a Venice, Calif., social-service agency, puts 
clients to work in a six-week course in restaurant work and 20 hours of 
on-the-job training. Caf  458 in Atlanta, run by Community of 
Hospitality, a nondenominational social-service group, requires a 
six-month program to kick drug habits. 

Eleven American sailors in white pants and T-shirts marched into the 
sea from a beach in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles. As bathers stopped 
to watch, U.S. Navy chaplain Dwight Webster of Bremerton, Wash., and 
his assistant walked down the column, immersing each man in baptism, 
Baptist Press reported. The men had become Christians aboard the USS 
Truxton through the ministry of Webster, an American Baptist. The 
sailors walked out of the water singing, then hugged one another, the 
chaplain, shipboard buddies from the 500-member crew who had come to 
watch, and members of a local congregation they had invited to take 
part. It was an astonishing and "mighty witness for the Lord" for 
sturdy young men to do that, said Southern Baptist missionary Leo 
Waldrop. Antillian men "don't respond very easily or quickly to 
religious matters," he said. 

Some 156,000 residents of Madagascar became believers during a Reinhard 
Bonnke crusade. Services were broadcast live on national radio across 
the island of 13 million people, which is off the southeast coast of 
Africa. Hundreds of people were said to be miraculously healed. 
...Bonnke said it was a privilege to minister to those who, to a large 
extent, are "total heathens." Traditional Malagasy religions, 
veneration of ancestral spirits, and witchcraft, are widespread, even 
among professed Christians. Some 53% of the people attest to belief in 
Christianity. There are still thousands of villages where traditional 
beliefs remain unchallenged by a Christian presence or church. 

Italian police broke up a demonstration beneath Pope John Paul II's 
Vatican windows. It happened during the final hours of a Vatican synod 
discussing the life of priests, nuns, and monks. Four American nuns who 
favor ordination of women, accompanied by supporters, marched into St. 
Peter's Square waving banners and singing, "We shall not be silenced." 
The nuns, whose views were not allowed to be presented at the synod, 
said women must be ordained in order to have equality in the church, 
Sister Donna Quinn of Chicago said.

Cultists in Switzerland and Canada were very different from 80 Branch 
Davidians who followed David Koresh to their deaths in Waco, Texas, 
last year, cult watchers said. Luc Jouret, 46, recruited bright, 
prominent people from social and business circles who were groping for 
answers to global problems. Jouret, persuasive and personable, lectured 
widely on spiritual topics in Western Europe for eight years while 
building a circle of followers who shared his belief in a coming 
apocalypse, said Johannes Aagaard, a Danish theologian and head of a 
cult-monitoring group. Canadian newspapers reported that Jouret held 
conferences on self-realization and motivation for employees of a 
government utility, Hydro-Quebec. Some attendees joined the sect. 
...Jouret spoke of heightened consciousness, personal auras, and other 
New Age beliefs. Those in his inner circle blended interests in the 
medieval Knights Templar; the Essenes, an ascetic Jewish sect; and 
Rosicrucianism, an eclectic system that claims to be descended from a 
medieval fraternity of the Rose Cross and teaches that humans can 
discover universal truth. The Swiss sect was identified as the Cross 
and Rose, then as the Order of Solar Tradition. Jouret founded the 
sect, the Order of the Solar Temple, in Quebec in the 1980s. 
...Swiss historian and cult expert Jean-Francois Mayer received a 
letter from the cult that he considers an authentic explanation of the 
deaths. "We are leaving this earth to discover, lucidly and freely, a 
dimension of truth and absoluteness, far from the hypocrisy and the 
oppression of this world, in order to produce the seed of our future 
generation," the letter said. Mayer said the letter explained that the 
Order of the Solar Temple felt persecuted in Canada, where Jouret faced 
weapons charges. He had urged his followers to stockpile an arsenal in 
preparation for an apocalypse, The Washington Post said. Nevertheless, 
cult experts said that, while in Quebec, Jouret never preached death in 
an apocalypse, but focused on survival of the elite after a cataclysm. 
Bertrand Ouellet of the Center for Information on New Religions in 
Montreal said Jouret and his followers envisioned themselves as 
medieval Knights Templar, the elect who would survive the crisis and 
lead new generations to a better world, the Los Angeles Times reported. 
American author and cult watcher George Mather said evidence at the 
sites convinced him that the cult is "a Satanist church" that performed 
Black Masses. 
...It is a mistake to believe that all cults will follow the examples 
of Jonestown and Waco and end in suicide and murder, but "it can happen 
again," Westmont College sociologist and cult watcher Ronald Enroth 
said. Groups with potential for self-destructive violence do exist, and 
"there are thousands and thousands of people in the United States who 
believe they are God," he told NIRR. 

The New Age has gone on-line on commercial computer services. The New 
Age Forum on CompuServe has drawn 45,000 participants worldwide. The 
3-year-old network includes information about astrology, tarot and 
mysticism, electronic conferences, and a library. 
...A growing number of on-line services cater to spiritual seekers. 
Users say the discussions change their lives. On-line forums are taking 
theological dialogue "out of the hands of the church hierarchy and the 
elites and turning it into a street brawl," said Jay Kinney, editor of 
Gnosis, a magazine that explores esoteric, mystical, and spiritual 
traditions. Kinney told Religious News Service that awareness of 
different religious beliefs causes conflict until people "realize they 
have to pay by the minute to give their opinions." 
...Christians sometimes share their beliefs over the forum, but are 
removed if their attitude becomes "abusive of what we do in our space," 
said Brad Hill, who oversees the forum's message board, conference 
rooms, and library. 

A new computer service lets people find information about nonprofit 
organizations. ReliefNet has been online for a month on the global 
network known as Internet. ReliefNet provides information on 
international relief efforts, offers users a way to make a pledge 
electronically, and serves as a link to other information about relief 
efforts posted on Internet. Users can show they want to make a donation 
by hitting a few keys. The network then tells the appropriate 
organization to get in touch with the donor to obtain the contribution, 
according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy. Donations may eventually be 
made by credit card over the network, organizers said. 
...ReliefNet was set up by EarthWeb, a company that helps organizations 
put their information on-line. EarthWeb hopes the group it created to 
run the project, ReliefNet Ltd., will be able to provide the service 
free to charities and pay for the effort with donations from corporate 
sponsors. Organizations on ReliefNet are Adventist Development Relief 
Agency International, American Friends Service Committee, CARE, Doctors 
Without Borders, International Medical Corps, Lutheran World Relief, 
MAP International, YMCA, Operation USA, and Oxfam America. 
...Most donors to relief organizations are over 40, so ReliefNet is 
designed to tell a younger generation about the work that is being 
done, Jack Hidary, EarthNet's director, told NIRR. The network also is 
trying to draw younger people by running ReliefRock, a promotion that 
allows ReliefNet users with multimedia computers to download short 
samples of songs by popular musicians. No organization on ReliefNet is 
obliged to participate in ReliefRock, and one Christian organization 
already has declined to do so, Hidary said. For more information send 
electronic mail to: info@earthweb.com. Or contact EarthWeb, 11801

Conservative Christians are hanging up on AT&T and other long-distance 
telephone carriers. Complaining of support for homosexuality, sales to 
telephone-sex companies, and sponsorship of morally questionable 
television programming, some 80,000 customers reportedly have left AT&T 
and other companies. They have switched to LifeLine, a long-distance 
company based in Oklahoma City that is run by conservative Christians. 
...LifeLine donates 10% of its customers' long-distance payments to 
churches or Christian organizations that the customers choose. 
Recipient groups must oppose abortion, homosexuality, and pornography. 
LifeLine donations so far have gone to 15,000 churches and conservative 
organizations, including the Christian Coalition, the American Family 
Association, Operation Rescue, and the Moore Foundation, a 
home-schooling advocacy group. Christian organizations and broadcasters 
have urged their members and listeners to switch to LifeLine. 
...AT&T spokesman Burke Stinson, who has acknowledged the company's 
support for homosexual rights, told Knight-Ridder Newspapers that the 
company is keenly aware that customers are defecting to LifeLine. AT&T 
was criticized by conservative religious organizations this summer for 
helping sponsor the Gay Games, an Olympic-style athletic competition 
that drew 11,000 competitors to New York. AT&T also holds seminars to 
teach employees to accept co-workers who are homosexual in order to 
reduce tensions at work. 
...Other long-distance telephone companies also have drawn the ire of 
conservative Christians, said Carl Thompson, senior vice president of 
AmeriVision. Sprint, GTE, and to a lesser extent MCI have sponsored 
objectionable television programming, Derek Hayden of the American 
Family Association told NIRR. Several of the companies also sell phone 
lines to companies that feature "dial-a-porn," Hayden said. 
...So-called affinity groups such as LifeLine are not new. For example, 
Working Assets Long Distance, which is carried by Sprint, offers its 
longdistance customers the chance to give 1% of their monthly charges 
to the National Gay & Lesbian Task Force, Planned Parenthood, or the 
American Civil Liberties Union. An advertisement by the group said it 
has given $2 million to these groups since 1986. Working Assets also 
prints on its monthly bills the names and phone numbers of decision 
makers on pending political issues, and lets its customers call them 
free. 
...To contact LifeLine, write or call AmeriVision Communications, Inc., 
at P.O. Box 7735, Moore, OK  73153, 1-800-800-7550. 

"Every company is a platform for ministry. Every CEO is a priest," said 
Ray Miller, head of the Fellowship of Companies for Christ 
International. Chief executive officers of some 300 corporations were 
challenged at the group's convention last month to run their businesses 
and personal lives according to biblical principles, according to 
Ethics & Religion columnist Michael McManus. Some 650 companies in the 
United States and abroad belong to the Atlanta-based group. FCCI firms 
pay for employees to attend Marriage Encounter sessions to strengthen 
their marriages, stress integrity in operating the company and 
excellence in the product, and believe in treating customers the way 
God would, FCCI members told McManus. Even the mission statements of 
FCCI companies include references to God. 
...Conference speaker David Rae, a former president of Apple Canada, 
told the business leaders that he used to spend too much time working. 
But he realigned his priorities and learned to delegate more 
responsibilities. Rae now spends two hours a day reading and memorizing 
Scripture, he said. Top priorities are his wife, family, and then his 
job, at which he spends no more than eight hours a day. 
...In addition to its conferences, the group sponsors local fellowship 
groups nationwide in which members pray, study case histories, and 
develop friendships. Tapes, books, and a newsletter also are provided. 
FCCI is located at 4201 N. Peachtree, Atlanta, GA 30341. Phone:

Gambling on airplanes? Former Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca has formed 
a venture capital company to finance interactive video systems to make 
it happen. They would be installed at every seat, allowing flyers to 
order movies and play video and casino games such as draw poker. Within 
10 years, airlines could make more money from gaming, movies, video 
games, phone calls, and shopping than from tickets, Iacocca predicted. 
"Like it or not, Americans like to gamble," he told USA Today. Iacocca 
will have to convince Congress first. Federal law bans U.S. airlines 
from offering gaming, although foreign airlines do. 

Hillary Clinton will not perform the duties of honorary chairperson of 
The Salvation Army's 1994 Christmas Campaign (NIRR 8/22). The Army had 
invited Clinton, as it has previous first ladies, to make 
public-service television announcements and use her photograph and 
message in promotional brochures, and she initially agreed to be 
involved. But Clinton placed too many restrictions on her participation 
in the campaign, according to an Army spokesperson. The Army has 
suggested that local individuals serve as Christmas chairpersons. 
...Christians heaped criticism on The Salvation Army after news outlets 
reported erroneously that Clinton had been asked to be spokesperson, 
rather than take the more limited role of honorary chairperson. A 
number of critical letters sent to Army headquarters have accused the 
organization of aligning itself with Clinton's positions on abortion 
and homosexuality. But that is not the case, Col. Leon Ferraez told 
NIRR. "The Salvation Army has never forsaken its basic mission of 
preaching the gospel." The Army recorded 153,537 decisions for Christ 
in 1993, he said. 

The Bible is unclear on abortion, President Clinton again suggested, 
this time during a 40-minute session with nearly 50 Baptist leaders and 
religion journalists summoned to a White House briefing this month. He 
said he had read and re-read Bible verses cited by the pro-life 
movement, with other materials from those groups. 
...His position nearly matches the 1971 Southern Baptist Convention 
resolution on abortion, he said. That resolution, passed two years 
before Roe v. Wade, affirmed the sanctity of human life but encouraged 
church members to support legislation allowing the possibility of 
abortion after "rape, incest, clear evidence of severe fetal deformity, 
and carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the 
emotional, mental, and physical health of the mother." Since 1980, SBC 
resolutions have been decidedly more pro-life. 
...Although views differ on the morality of abortion, the "real 
question" for government, Clinton said, is "whether government should 
criminalize abortion in all cases." He acknowledged that the number of 
abortions in the United States "is not good." He said his 
administration supports reducing unwanted pregnancies and promoting 
more adoptions. 
...As for homosexuality, he said that people "should not be judged by 
what they are or what they say, but by what they do." He added, "I 
don't believe that [approach to homosexuality] is an assault on 
American family values." The briefing was arranged by the 
Washington-based Baptist Joint Committee, a group that monitors 
religious liberty and other issues. 
...Finding quiet time to pray about difficult decisions is one of his 
current pursuits, the president said. He added that he has spent more 
time than ever reading religious books, some by people he knows and 
respects. Doing so has helped him cope with the "isolation of this 
job," he added. 

Chemically induced abortions that use a combination of two readily 
available drugs could win government approval in about a year, medical 
experts told reporters. The drugs are on the market, but are approved 
for other purposes. Dr. Mitchell Creinin of the University of 
Pittsburgh School of Medicine said he has been conducting multicity 
clinical trials for 20 months. The tests have been approved by the Food 
and Drug Administration. 
...In the abortion procedure, the woman receives an injection of 
methotrexate, followed four days later by misoprostol tablets inserted 
in the vagina to induce a miscarriage. There are no significant side 
effects, but the procedure is limited to the first eight weeks of 
pregnancy, Creinin said. Methotrexate is used to treat cancer, 
arthritis, psoriasis, and ectopic pregnancies. Misoprostol is used by 
pregnant women in labor and to prevent stomach ulcers. 
...A New York gynecologist who does not have FDA authorization said he 
has carried out 126 abortions using these same drugs. Dr. Richard 
Hausknect, an abortion-rights activist, told The New York Times that 
five of the cases required surgery to complete the abortion. The 
doctor, who reportedly charges $500 for an abortion, last month 
requested FDA approval to perform the procedure. An FDA spokesman said 
it is "legal and appropriate for a physician to prescribe an approved 
drug for any use that he or she feels is appropriate." He added that in 
Hausknect's case, the women should have been informed that it's an 
experimental treatment, which the FDA would prefer be monitored by 
outside observers. 
...The RU-486 abortion pill, widely used in Europe, still is illegal in 
the United States. It is not expected to be on the market for two 
years. 

Police arrested a man who shot at a pro-life demonstrator outside a 
Baton Rouge, La., abortion clinic. Ernest Edward Robinson, Jr., 22, was 
picking up his wife at the Delta Women's Clinic after a morning 
appointment when he encountered four demonstrators praying in front of 
the facility, police said. Words were exchanged, and Robinson fired at 
Richard Mahoney, one of the protesters, they said. Although no one was 
hit, Robinson was charged with attempted second-degree murder. 

Arson fires that damaged abortion clinics in the northern California 
cities of Chico and Redding were probably set by the same person, 
police said. The fires occurred about 70 miles apart, they noted. It 
was the fourth fire at the Redding clinic since 1989. At least two of 
the earlier fires were arson, officials said. The clinic also was 
heavily damaged by vandalism in an earlier incident. Federal 
authorities are assisting local police in their investigations. Redding 
pro-life leader Donna Ellis said she does not condone destructive 
actions, but they do not surprise her. The clinics, she said, have made 
enemies: husbands and boyfriends who would choose life, but have no say 
in the matter. 

In Canada, abortion ends more than one in four pregnancies, a 
government agency reported. There were 100,497 abortions in 1992 (or 
25.2 abortions per 100 live births), up 5.7% from 95,059 the year 
before, Statistics Canada said. Its report linked the higher figure for 
abortions to the increasing number of private abortion clinics allowed 
under a 1988 Canadian Supreme Court decision. 

Every government agency has been directed by President Clinton to 
appoint someone on its legal staff to monitor application of the 
Religious Freedom Restoration Act, White House Deputy Counsel Joel 
Klein announced. The president wants all government agencies to support 
free religious expression rather than hinder it, Klein said. Clinton 
issued the order after the Justice Department filed a brief favoring 
creditors in a bankruptcy case in Minnesota. The bankruptcy trustee in 
that case wants a church to return a couple's tithes so creditors can 
be paid. Clinton ordered the Justice brief withdrawn (NIRR 10/3). 

Religious liberty disputes figured in several of the more than 800 
cases rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court as it opened its current term 
Oct. 3. The court left standing a federal appeals court decision that 
struck down a Clearwater, Fla., ordinance on the grounds that it 
excessively entangled church and state. The ordinance, which targeted 
mainly the Church of Scientology, imposed substantial record-keeping 
and disclosure requirements on nonprofit groups that solicit funds in 
the city. 
...The high court threw out a lower court ruling that upheld a judge's 
order restricting abortion protests to 300 feet from a doctor's home in 
Westfield, N.J. The justices said the case must be reheard in light of 
the court's ruling last term in Madsen v. Women's Health Center. That 
case upheld a state judge's decision to establish an abortion-protest 
buffer zone in Melbourne, Fla., but found its 300-foot buffer 
excessive. 
...Also left standing was a decision by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court 
upholding a law requiring all preschools, elementary schools, and 
secondary schools to be licensed by the Education Department of the 
territory (NIRR 6/27). The Association of Christian Academies and 
Colleges of Puerto Rico had argued that disclosures and affirmations of 
internal information required by the law infringe on religious freedom. 
But the Puerto Rico court said the requirements are strictly secular, 
and are designed to assure good education. 

Parents in Jersey City, N.J., will test a school voucher program 
announced by state education officials. In the first phase of the 
five-year test, parents of children about to enter first grade or ninth 
grade will have a choice of sending them to a public or private 
(including religious) school. Vouchers will be offered to partially 
subsidize the cost. They will have varying values depending on the 
income and needs of each family, officials said. Vermont, Puerto Rico, 
and Milwaukee, Wis., also are using voucher systems. Teachers' 
associations and supporters of church-state separation opposed the use 
of vouchers. Critics charge they are a way to get around restrictions 
on public funding of religious schools. 

Christian Coalition-backed candidates for three school board slots in 
Lake County, Fla., were trounced in a GOP runoff this month. Two were 
running for re-election and the third was seeking to replace outgoing 
board chairwoman Pat Hart, a conservative. The conservative majority on 
the fivemember board last May adopted, but never implemented, a policy 
to teach that American culture is superior to all others. Hart blamed 
the election outcome on liberal media and teachers' union money. The 
board majority rolled back property taxes, cut school funding, placed a 
number of programs and new facilities on hold, and froze teachers' 
salaries. John Dowless, a state worker for the Christian Coalition, 
agreed with Hart. He said he was appalled by what he considered to be 
anti-Christian bigotry that was exhibited during the campaign. Many 
people seem to oppose the participation of conservative religious 
believers in politics, he said. He disagreed that the defeats were a 
bellwether for other areas of the nation. 

Grass-roots lobbying launched by the Christian Coalition and the Family 
Research Council at the last minute was given much of the credit for 
the demise of a bill to regulate lobbyists. The proposal would have 
banned gifts to lawmakers and set up strict reporting requirements 
regarding professional lobbyists' activities. Proponents failed to 
muster the two-thirds vote needed to cut off a GOP filibuster against 
it in the Senate as a result of the extensive lobbying campaign. 
...Christian groups said they were alarmed by the disclosure 
requirements, which they feared could infringe on their freedom. Gary 
Bauer's Family Research Council alerted James Dobson, who informed his 
radio audience about the pending bill. Pat Robertson flashed the 
telephone number for the U.S. Capitol switchboard on his 700 Club. The 
Christian Coalition activated a national fax network linking 1,000 
local chapters, each with its own fax or telephone tree numbering in 
the hundreds, Coalition director Ralph Reed said. Reed also posted 
alerts on the Internet and CompuServe electronic mail systems. 
...Rush Limbaugh piled on, appealing to his audience to call Congress. 
Then the American Civil Liberties Union weighed in, agreeing that 
constitutional issues were at stake. Congressman Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) 
mobilized the GOP's networks. Finally, business associations and 
corporations deployed their army of lobbyists into the fray. Tens of 
thousands of calls and faxes inundated Capitol Hill. Veteran members of 
Congress said they had seen nothing like it in all their years in 
Washington. 

Federal Election Commission has opened an investigation into the 
Chesapeake, Va.-based Christian Coalition in 35 states, a Columbia, 
S.C., newspaper reported. The inquiry is in response to complaints that 
the group, founded by Christian TV host Pat Robertson to educate voters 
and get them to the polls, violated the law on political activity in 
1992, The State said. The Democratic National Committee charged that 
the coalition raised money as a tax-exempt group but spent it on 
pro-Republican activities without registering as a political group. The 
DNC wants the FEC to order the coalition to organize a political action 
committee, to report contributions and expenditures, and refund all 
donations in excess of federal limits. Coalition spokesman Mike Russell 
dismissed the inquiry as a partisan ploy aimed at disrupting the 
group's activities, all of them lawful and "strictly nonpartisan." 

Christian money is promoting Islam, the conservative Presbyterian 
Layman newspaper charged. It criticized an anti-poverty grant of $4,100 
by the Giddings-Lovejoy Presbytery in St. Louis to the Clara Muhammad 
School. The school is one of about 35 across the country organized by 
followers of black Muslim leader W.D. Muhammad as an alternative to 
public schools. The presbytery is a regional entity of the Presbyterian 
Church (U.S.A.). National PCUSA officials said nothing in the 
guidelines for the church's $5 million anti-poverty program stipulates 
that groups receiving grants must be Christian. However, Jean Ann 
Swope, the minister who chairs the national program, concurred that the 
grant was inappropriate because all schools are outside the scope of 
the grants. 

A free tax guide for churches is available from the Internal Revenue 
Service. The new guide tells IRS auditors which issues to examine, what 
documents to ask for, and how transactions are most likely to be 
misreported, according to Pastor's Tax & Money. It is being released to 
the public so churches will know what is expected of them and what 
records they should keep. For a copy of Tax Guide For Churches and 
Other Religious Organizations, write to Freedom of Information Reading 
Room, P.O. Box 795, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044. 

The breakup of Protestant denominations is irreversible, William 
McKinney, dean at Hartford (Conn.) Seminary, told the Conference On the 
Future of Mainline Denominations. "What do they contribute to the 
kingdom of God?" he asked delegates. The meeting drew 75 leaders from 
11 denominations to Nashville last month to consider the implications 
of a twodecade decline in membership. Other problems include: national 
denominational structures have been criticized as bureaucratic, trust 
in churchwide agencies is wavering, and financial support for national 
and international missions is shrinking. 
..."We have to get over the '50s," said James Hudnut-Buemler, dean of 
faculty at Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, Ga. Denominational 
structures thrived when well financed, he said. But they were the 
result of "a confluence of factors never to be repeated in our lives." 
...Delegates agreed on the needs to encourage local pastors, network 
with congregations, and reach youth. New patterns of lay leadership 
also were stressed. Changes present the church with a "wonderful 
opportunity to rebuild itself," McKinney said. He cited a rediscovery 
of social and lay ministries and revitalized worship. 

A court will decide Oct. 26 whether activist pastor Henry Lyons, 52, 
will lead the 7.8-million-member National Baptist Convention USA, Inc. 
Lyons, of St. Petersburg, Fla., was elected president with less than a 
500vote margin in a five-man race in boisterous proceedings at last 
month's NBCUSA convention in New Orleans (NIRR 9/19). He narrowly 
defeated Franklyn Richardson, the denomination's general secretary and 
candidate favored by outgoing president T.J. Jemison. Members of 
NBCUSA's Alabama state convention filed suit in the District of 
Columbia, where the denomination is chartered. They challenged the 
validity of Lyons' votes, and claimed they had been unable to cast 
their ballots. Judge Zinora Mitchell Rankin granted the plaintiffs a 
temporary injunction that blocked Lyons from taking over on Oct. 6. At 
stake are personal power and perks as well as the future direction of 
the denomination, insiders told Religious News Service. 

Protestant pastors are divided evenly about their churches' impact on 
society, a poll by the Barna Research Group found. The church is having 
little impact, 41% said, while an equal number said churches are doing 
a "respectable, if not wholly successful job."  Just 3% said churches 
are "failing miserably," and 2% said they are doing "tremendous, highly 
respectable work." 
...More optimistic were respondents to a second Barna poll, taken at 
the same time among the general adult population. Seventy percent said 
they believe churches are serving people's needs either "very well" or 
"pretty well." Pollster George Barna said pastors have a different set 
of expectations from people in the pews as to what makes a church 
effective and influential. Many pastors expressed disappointment that 
people's lives are not noticeably changed by exposure to the church, he 
added. 
...Ignorance of basic teachings of the Bible was found in another 
nationwide Barna study. Most people own a Bible, but few have a 
consistently accurate understanding of its content, the study found. 
Cultural truisms repeated at Christmas and Easter are about the only 
elements of biblical teaching that people seem to retain, Barna said. 
The survey showed that less than half of all adults had read from the 
Bible in the past week. Much of the reading was a quick perusal of a 
few verses. 

Some 75% of married men and 85% of married women say they are faithful 
to their spouses. That was one of the findings of the survey of 
American sexuality by researchers from the University of Chicago and 
the State University of New York at Stony Brook in conjunction with the 
National Opinion Research Center. Those who have the most sex and are 
happiest with their sex lives are monogamous couples, the privately 
funded $1.7 million study found. Although 5% of the male respondents 
acknowledged having had a homosexual encounter, only 2.8% said they are 
homosexual or bisexual; 1.4% of women said they were lesbian or 
bisexual. Among other findings: the typical American man has six sex 
partners in his lifetime. The typical American woman has two. 

There is no evidence the General Assembly Council of the Presbyterian 
Church (U.S.A.) violated the denomination's constitution in its 
handling of issues related to the controversial 1993 "RE-Imagining" 
women's conference (NIRR 8/8), the PCUSA high court ruled. The decision 
came in response to official charges lodged by congregations in six 
states. The plaintiffs accused the council of failing to discipline 
agencies and individuals involved in the conference. They also called 
for public disavowal of certain views expressed at the conference. 

Robert Schuller said he will put his weekly Hour of Power TV church 
services on 35mm film and show them in movie theaters around the world. 
The first programs are scheduled to be screened next Sunday in 
Australia. They will be shown later this year in Europe, Hong Kong, and 
30 American cities. Admission will be free. Schuller, 68, told 
reporters that the theater showings are intended to bring together 
believers who feel "threatened or intimidated" by traditional churches. 
He said he got the idea while exploring alternatives to television, 
which is growing costlier and is not always open to airing of religious 
programs. His program was dropped from Europe's Super Channel after NBC 
bought it last May, costing him 200,000 viewers. He also was cut from 
Russian TV. 

Author John Grisham (The Chamber, The Firm, and other best-sellers) 
made a public profession of faith in Christ at age 8 in a Southern 
Baptist Church in Arkansas. "It was the most important event in my 
life," he told Will Norton, Jr., in an interview published in 
Christianity Today. 
...Grisham told of a Christian upbringing and of a lifelong interest in 
missions while practicing law. He said he went to Brazil last year as 
part of a short-term ministry team and helped build a new church. As a 
result of his 40 million-plus sales of novels and movie deals, he said 
he is able to contribute "an awful lot of money" to God's work. 
...Part of the sales success, he said, is because his novels are 
"reasonably clean." 

Billy Graham joined his oldest son, Franklin, 42, for the final two 
nights of the Franklin Graham Triangle Area Crusade in Raleigh, N.C. It 
was the second time this year that the elder Graham participated at his 
son's crusades. More than 54,000 attended the four-night crusade, and 
2,062 of those responded to invitations to commit their lives to 
Christ. "There's no doubt God has given Franklin the gift of 
evangelism, and I'm glad he's doing crusades," Graham said. "He reminds 
me a lot of myself at that age." Franklin Graham, president of 
Samaritan's Purse and World Medical Mission, conducts six to eight 
evangelistic crusades a year. 

Highway signs that pointed the way to Jimmy Swaggart's Bible college in 
Baton Rouge, La., were removed. State transportation officials told 
reporters that the school's enrollment had fallen to 75, not enough to 
qualify for the state-paid signs. The school, which had nearly 1,500 
students in the 1980s, fell on hard times after nationally publicized 
incidents involving Swaggart and prostitutes (NIRR 2/29/88). The 
school's name has since been changed to World Evangelism Bible College. 

Satellite technology linked 55,000 Christians from 30 denominations in 
what was called Canada's biggest prayer meeting, news reports said. 
Televised simultaneously to 25 Canadian cities, five Oct. 1 events were 
both uplinked and downlinked. Giant screens in Vancouver, Edmonton, 
Winnipeg, Ottawa, and Toronto displayed portions of the program. In 
addition, 15 centers were downlinked, and 10 participated in prayer 
without satellite linkup. 
...Calling Canada to prayer and repentance at Toronto's Skydome, the 
program included flagbearers from each of Canada's provinces. They also 
carried a flame to the center of the field where they lit the flame of 
unity. Singer Steve Green performed in Winnipeg and Joni Eareckson Tada 
in Edmonton. Prayers were said for political leaders and various ethnic 
groups. The goal of the rally was to encourage prayer for Canada and 
launch individual Canadians on a program of prayer for their 
communities. Rally participants each received a photocopied page from 
their community telephone book and were exhorted to pray for the people 
every week for two years. Organizers considered the rally a spiritual 
success, but said the turnout fell below expectations. 

More violence in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas claimed the 
lives of three evangelicals, news outlets reported. Catholic 
traditionalists attacked four evangelicals with guns and sticks near 
the bitterly divided town of San Juan Chamula (NIRR 7/25), officials 
said. Two men and a woman were killed, and a second woman was seriously 
wounded. An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 evangelicals, indigenous 
Indians, have been violently forced from their homes by the 
traditionalists. Catholics accuse converts of failing to respect the 
region's traditions and its religion, which combines Catholic and 
ancient indigenous rituals. Evangelicals claim they have been 
victimized because they refuse to drink alcohol. The alcohol is brewed 
and distributed by local chieftains and is an important source of 
income in the area. A government commission has talked with both sides 
and is trying to restore the peace, news sources said. 

Haitian refugees housed at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station in Cuba badly 
need spiritual counseling, World Relief's Tim Amstutz said. Some 15% of 
the 14,000 Haitians there were tortured by Haitian military or police. 
Living in increasingly violent detention centers, surrounded by barbed 
wire, only worsens the "mental struggle," he said. World Relief, the 
international assistance arm of the National Association of 
Evangelicals, coordinates counseling efforts by military chaplains who 
visit the seven camps. It also oversees distribution of clothes and 
medicine. 
...The Clinton administration asked World Relief to coordinate 
humanitarian aid for Cuban refugees housed in separate facilities at 
Guantanamo Bay. The 60-65 World Relief workers will face a bigger 
challenge doing that because of the larger number of Cubans -- some 
30,000 are housed at the base -- and because there is "no resolution in 
sight" to their plight, Don Hammond, WR vice president, told NIRR. 

Tickets are needed for Sunday services at Holy Trinity Brompton, 
England. The Anglican congregation, which is the focus of a revival in 
charismatic Christianity in London (NIRR 7/11), has become the place to 
be. On Sundays, the church is packed and pulsating with music, speaking 
in tongues, and laughter, according to Ecumenical News International. 
The church is in the affluent west side of the city. Church members 
have become involved in a controversial church planting method in which 
they target a dying church, join, then take over. Trinity's growth is 
being fueled by the Alpha initiative (NIRR 9/19) by which potential new 
members are evangelized through a course for new Christians. Laughter 
has spread to the Alpha weekend celebration suppers. 
..."I have known these people for a very long time and have never heard 
them laugh like that," said John Darling, who is a minister from 
Trowbridge, Wiltshire. 

A homosexual Christians' group accused the Church of England's new 
Bishop of Durham, Michael Turnbull, of hypocrisy. Britain's Lesbian & 
Gay Christian Movement urged him to support the right of practicing 
homosexuals to work as clergy. The BBC quoted him as having told a 
church conference earlier this year that homosexuality in "an admitted 
and open lifestyle was incompatible with a fulltime ministry." 
...A tabloid newspaper last month disclosed that Turnbull was convicted 
26 years ago of having sex with a farmer in a public lavatory. He was a 
chaplain to the Archbishop of York at the time. Church officials said 
they were aware of the conviction, but he had undergone rehabilitation, 
they had forgiven him, and the past should be forgotten. Turnbull, who 
is married and the father of three children, is to become Bishop of 
Durham this week. He succeeds David Jenkins, who retired in July. 
Jenkins is one of the most controversial bishops in Anglican history. 
He denied the existence of hell and questioned the virgin birth and the 
resurrection of Christ. 

Child slavery is not permitted by any religion, according to Hindu, 
Jain, Sikh, and Muslim leaders. They made the statement at a landmark 
meeting in India recently, where they pledged to support efforts to 
help free millions of Indian children under 14 from bonded labor and 
prostitution. Government officials estimate that some 20 million 
children of poorer families work, but charity groups place the figure 
at 55 million or more. Some 400,000 Indian children are prostitutes, 
the Hindustan Times reported. Many parents are forced by lenders to put 
children into labor because they cannot repay loans with 60%-70% 
interest per month. Child labor is illegal in India, but the law has 
not been enforced among the poorer castes. 
...The religious leaders called for establishment of a national 
commission on child labor. Their conference was organized in New Delhi 
by the South Asian Coalition Child Servitude (SACCS). They represented 
about 600 million Hindus, 160 million Muslims, 60 million Jains, and 40 
million Sikhs. SACCS estimates that 25 million other children in 
Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka are forced to work. Growing 
numbers of Arab male tourists seeking young virgins have increased 
demand for children in the country's sex trade, they add. 

Six Swedish Bible college students survived when the ferry Estonia sank 
Sept. 28 in the raging Baltic Sea. Passengers were asleep on the 
12-hour run from Tallinn, Estonia, to Stockholm when the ship rolled on 
its side, overturned, and sank. Sources said passengers numbered at 
least 1,006, but the number of survivors still is uncertain. Most 
passengers were Swedes. Many of Sweden's 8.5 million people knew, or 
knew of, at least one of the victims. Swedes called the disaster their 
greatest peacetime tragedy since World War II. 
...A group of 27 young Swedish evangelists, including 19 students from 
a Bible college in J nk ping, were aboard. Two leaders of the school 
were among the dead. One of the surviving students endured icy waters 
for three hours before being rescued. Another, Martin Nilsson, was 
asleep in a lower cabin, ran in pajamas to the top deck, released 
inflatable rafts, and "pulled others out of the wild sea." 
...The students were returning home from Tallinn after "a very blessed 
crusade" during which nearly 100 people became Christians, Estonian 
Pentecostal pastor Harry Leesment told NIRR. After the disaster, 
Estonian pastors gathered for "weeping, comforting one another, 
worship, and deep rededication to Christ," he said. The pastors 
received a "prophetic word" that God was challenging them to raise up 
100 young evangelists to take the place of each of the victims, 
Leesment said. "With great release of joy, we went into the next night 
with praise and dancing." 
...Clergy, relatively absent in secular Sweden, were seen all day on 
television screens. Dozens of clergy and psychologists counseled 
tearful relatives at the harbor terminal, where they waited for word 
about loved ones. Clergy also went on radio to read Scriptures, pray, 
and bring God's comfort, Leesment said. Bible students counseled by 
telephone. 
...God warned several people in dreams before the disaster, Leesment 
said. The night before the group left Sweden for Estonia, one student 
said he dreamed the ship sank and subsequently many turned to Christ. 
Others laughed at his fears, but the student who retold the story had 
just gotten married and decided not to travel to Estonia, Leesment 
said. Lecturer Margit Saks was awakened at 2 a.m. by a stark vision of 
a mother crying for her son, and got out of bed and prayed for God's 
comfort, he said. Another student awoke in the early darkness and felt 
moved to "walk the wild and windy seashore and pray over the furious 
seas." 

A homeless man has confessed to starting one of California's major 
wildfires last year hoping the flames would conjure "Gotam, the chief 
of a thousand demons," The Orange Country Register reported. The man, a 
Mexican immigrant, 26, told the newspaper he deliberately set the 
Laguna Beach blaze, which destroyed 366 homes and businesses, by 
touching a lighted match to dry grass. "I just like to look at fires, 
to see Gotam, and make him happy." 

 Heavyweight boxer Marvin Frazier was ordained as a Pentecostal 
minister at Faith Temple of God in Philadelphia. Frazier, who retired 
from the ring in 1988 with a record of 21-2, had been a deacon in the 
church for 15 years. The boxer told reporters he was a little nervous, 
but he "figured preaching couldn't be as hard as facing Larry Holmes or 
Mike Tyson," the only two men who beat him professionally. The first 
person to congratulate him at the ordination was his father, Joe 
Frazier, the former heavyweight champion. weight champion.

A pastor is an employee, not selfemployed, for federal income tax 
purposes, a federal court ruled. The decision affects nearly all of the 
20,000 United Methodist clergy who are licensed through regional 
conferences and supervised by a bishop, but are free to work day-to-day 
as they see fit. Virtually all of them file as self-employed 
professionals. Other denominations expect the ruling to affect them 
eventually. 
...Michael Weber, a pastor from Stonewall, N.C., deducted vestments, 
computer equipment, and books under business expenses  on Schedule C of 
his 1988 Form 1040. That section applies only to self-employed workers. 
The Internal Revenue Service disallowed the deductions. It said that 
Weber, as a church employee, can report business expenses only on 
Schedule A as  miscellaneous itemized deductions  to the extent that 
they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income. When Weber appealed, Judge 
Howard Dawson, Jr., upheld the IRS decision. 
...A legal concept known as the right-to-control test  is used to 
determine whether a minister is an employee or self-employed, the court 
said. The court found that Weber was subject to  significant control  
by the church -- including the annual conference, district 
superintendent, and bishop. The fact that Weber scheduled his own 
day-to-day activities merely demonstrates that  less supervision is 
necessary in conjunction with a professional,  the court said. 

A missions agency was forced out of business by a federal court 
judgment. Proclamation International of Pensacola, Fla., which assisted 
indigenous ministries in several developing countries, has ceased 
operations. PI, founded in 1984, was one of seven evangelical nonprofit 
groups ordered by a federal district court in Chicago to return a total 
of $500,000. The money was donated by a Chicago man who later was 
convicted of swindling his investors (NIRR 8/8). Proclamation 
International was ordered to return $51,228. 
...The basis of the ruling was not that the money was stolen, but that 
the donor was insolvent at the time of the donations, according to Don 
Dunkerley, PI's executive director. Under bankruptcy law, if an 
insolvent person gives money without receiving something of value, a 
fraudulent transfer has taken place, Dunkerley said. It had always been 
understood that a charity, using a donation according to donor 
instructions, has given something of value, he said. 
...The ruling  affects every church and charity in the United States, 
Dunkerley said.  Whenever a church or charity receives a donation, it 
is in jeopardy for 10 years [the statute of limitations], during which 
time it may learn the donor was insolvent and must pay his creditors.  
Several recipients of the donations have appealed the ruling. 

President Clinton did a turnabout in a case involving contributions to 
Crystal Evangelical Free Church in New Hope, Minn. (NIRR 10/4/93). The 
case, under review by a federal appeals court, involves a Minnesota 
couple who gave $13,500 to the church in the year before they went 
bankrupt. A federal bankruptcy trustee is seeking to force the church 
to refund the tithes so creditors can be paid, contending that the 
couple had no right to give the money. In its brief, which has been 
withdrawn, the Justice Department argued that the Religious Freedom 
Restoration Act does not apply. 
...Crystal has spent $200,000 on the case because of the ramifications 
for all churches, pastor Stephen Goold said. He added that Clinton's 
action delighted him and would help the church's case. James Smith, 
government relations head for the Southern Baptist Convention, said the 
withdrawal of the Justice Department from the case and scrapping of 
proposed harassment guidelines by the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission suggest that the administration is trying to improve its 
image among religious Americans. 

Protests from religious groups and Congress led the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission, by a 3-0 vote, to withdraw proposed guidelines 
against workplace harassment. Most objections centered on how the EEOC 
defined religious harassment (NIRR 3/7). Opponents warned that the 
proposal could lead to violations of an individual's right to free 
speech and freedom of religion. An EEOC spokesman credited the public 
outcry for the commission's decision. 

In a Democratic lovefest of sorts, President Clinton and New York Gov. 
Mario Cuomo took turns praising each other at the pulpit of the Bethel 
African Methodist Episcopal Church in Harlem. Clinton openly called on 
the congregation to support Cuomo over his Republican opponent, state 
Sen. George Pataki. The president, clutching a Bible and quoting from 
Isaiah, spoke at the end of the nearly twohour Sunday morning service 
Sept. 25. The New York Times said he joined in singing the hymns 
enthusiastically and swayed to the jazz-gospel soloists, at several 
points putting his arm around his wife. 
...Black churches long have provided a podium for Democratic 
candidates, although church-state separationists generally condemn 
similar partisan politicking in churches by religious conservatives. 

More than 3,500 Christian activists cheered a parade of Jewish, 
Catholic, and Protestant speakers at the annual two-day Christian 
Coalition convention in Washington, D.C. last month. They spoke out on 
morals and values, taxes, term limits, home schooling, and the right of 
religious conservatives to be involved in politics. In the five years 
since its founding, the group has become  one of the most powerful 
political forces  in American history, coalition founder and chairman 
Pat Robertson told the crowd. The nonprofit group has expanded to 
nearly 1.5 million members in 872 chapters in all 50 states, a 
coalition spokesman said. Its purpose is to educate, register, and 
rally voters to primaries and general elections. Organizers said the 
coalition will distribute more than 50 million voting guides at 
churches in November. The Scorecards don't endorse candidates, but list 
their positions on issues. 
...Speakers representing a who's who of conservative leadership took 
aim at a variety of targets. Former vice president Dan Quayle described 
religious conservatives as hard-working Americans who pay their taxes, 
love their families, and obey the law. Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) called 
for an end to  rewarding people for having illegitimate children,  and 
for a get-tough position on crime.  Democratic Gov. Robert Casey of 
Pennsylvania, a Catholic who has been coldshouldered by the Clinton 
administration for his pro-life stands, said it is a bitter irony that 
abortion on demand found refuge in the national Democratic Party --  
the party of the weak and the powerless. 
...For secular liberals,  we are the makings of their worst nightmare 
-Jews and Christians united,  said Orthodox rabbi Daniel Lapin, who 
heads a Seattle-based traditional values advocacy group. Hollywood film 
critic Michael Medved, a Jew, chided evangelicals for watching the same 
TV shows and videos as the general public, and doing little to change 
the industry's moral direction. Lutheranturned-Catholic scholar Richard 
John Neuhaus cautioned against mistaking political policy judgments for 
the judgments of God. 

Millions of dollars in funds from Pat Robertson's tax-exempt religious 
ministry, the Christian Broadcasting Network, were used to prop up a 
forprofit but money-losing venture started by Robertson, company 
documents obtained by Newsweek and ABC News show. The money was used to 
fund American Benefits Plus, a marketing company that has since been 
shut down. Its successor, KaloVita, sells vitamin supplements and other 
products is under new management. "Donor money never was used in Pat 
Robertson's profit making ventures," Gene Kapp, vice president of 
public relations at CBN, told NIRR. Kapp said there are "numerous 
errors" in the Newsweek article. 
...Democratic Rep. Pete Stark of California charged that Robertson has 
used money from Christian donors who responded to fund-raising appeals 
of his nonprofit religious ministries to launch a complex web of 
nonprofit and profitmaking organizations. He has proposed legislation 
to give the IRS additional enforcement powers to deal with such 
situations. Former CBN financial officer Robert Prigmore told Landmark 
News Service that the focus on Robertson can be explained in one word: 
politics. They're out to get Pat Robertson for his political beliefs,  
he said. 

Evangelist Tony Alamo was sentenced to a maximum six years in prison by 
a federal court in Memphis and fined $210,000 for income tax evasion. 
Alamo and his late wife formed a ministry for drug abusers and homeless 
young people during the Jesus Movement of the 1970s. They shuttled 
between communes in Saugus, Calif., and Fort Smith, Ark. The ministry, 
later known as Holy Alamo Christian Church, grew into a multimillion 
dollar network of enterprises ranging from a hog farm to upscale 
clothing design and sales. 
...Authorities have clashed with Alamo, whose real name is Bernie 
Hoffman, over taxes and treatment of his followers (NIRR 1/13/92). They 
worked for subsistence wages or no pay at all, while Alamo lived 
lavishly, prosecutors contended. They claimed the ministry took in $9 
million in one four-year period alone. Alamo, now 59, argued that he 
owed no taxes because he had no salary. He said he was the victim of a 
government conspiracy aimed at destroying churches. An appeal is 
expected. 

A federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., has reinstated a lawsuit 
against Jim Bakker. The suit claims he defrauded 150,000 people who 
purchased  lifetime partnerships  in his now-defunct PTL ministry. The 
suit seeks $260 million in damages.  

A former National Council of Churches executive who was fired for 
allegedly mismanaging church investment funds (NIRR 5/30) is suing his 
former bosses. Emilio Carrillo claims he was unjustly dismissed after 
making an $8 million church investment that became entangled in an 
investment scheme involving the Banka Bohemia in Prague, Czech 
Republic. Carrillo also claims in his $3.2 million suit against the NCC 
and its general secretary, Joan Brown Campbell, that he was defamed by 
their public statements against him. He said he kept his superiors 
abreast of the investments, and is a scapegoat. 

Lewis Nobles, Jr., was indicted in federal court on charges of 
embezzling $1.2 million from Southern Baptist-related Mississippi 
College to pay for prostitutes, lavish personal gifts, and real estate 
investments for himself. Last year, Nobles resigned as president of the 
2,000-student school in Clinton, Miss. He claims the missing money went 
to needy students. In a civil lawsuit, the college is seeking about $3 
million the school board claims is missing. The federal charges against 
him include mail fraud, money laundering, and income tax evasion. 
Nobles, who pleaded not guilty, faces up to 165 years in prison and $5 
million in fines if he is convicted. 

Clergy Appreciation Month is being celebrated by congregants nationwide 
in October. The annual effort was begun three years ago by Under His 
Wing Ministries of Williamsport, Pa., and now is being assisted by 
Focus on the Family. The goal is to acknowledge the contributions of 
-and the pressures facing -- America's religious leaders in the 1990s. 
Local congregations have been urged to honor their pastors in a special 
way on Oct. 9. A pastor of the year will be announced that day. 
...Pastors feel  isolated, lonely, insecure, and inadequate,  H.B. 
London, Jr., head of Pastoral Ministries at Focus on the Family, said.  
We want to say to these vital people, `You are a national treasure.'  
Pastoring is more difficult now because of the consumer mindset of most 
Americans,  London said. People used to ask what they could do for the 
church, but now they ask what the church can do for them, he said. 
Clergy Appreciation Month organizers urged people to pray for those in 
fulltime ministry and demonstrate their love and appreciation 
sincerely, openly, and often. 

Protestant ministers who are closet Catholics  are joining The Network, 
a 20-month-old national support group based in Steubenville, Ohio. More 
than 100 ministers -mostly men -- have searched out the organization, 
which provides a newsletter and access to others on the road to 
Catholicism, founder Marcus Grodi told NIRR. 
...Grodi, former pastor of an 800member Presbyterian church in Warren, 
Ohio, founded The Network soon after his 1992 conversion to 
Catholicism. The Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary graduate said 
Bible study, church history, and  a deep drive for truth  lead most of 
these pastors to conversion. The Network membership list is a secret. 
Most church members would be scandalized if they knew of their 
ministers' beliefs, Grodi said. 
...One western Pennsylvania member said he expects to lose his campus 
ministry job when he is found out.  Each morning, he slips through a 
sacristy door to hear Mass at his parish church. He and his family are 
ready to make sacrifices for a truer Christian faith, he said. 

A Christian AARP? A group similar to the American Association of 
Retired Persons -- but with a Christian dimension -- has been launched. 
The Christian Association of PrimeTimers (CAP) is a non-political 
fellowship for older Christians. Billy Melvin of the National 
Association of Evangelicals is chairman of the board, and the president 
is Roland Johnson. Membership costs $19.95 a year. Benefits include the 
bimonthly A Better Tomorrow magazine; a quarterly newsletter; 
Movieguide magazine; discounts on Bibles, books, and gifts; access to 
insurance for health, auto, and home; CAP conferences; access to a 
credit card; travel discounts; and ministry opportunities. 
...CAP wants to create a National Volunteer Organization, Johnson told 
NIRR. The group has extensive contacts in churches, missions, relief 
agencies, camps, retirement homes, and prisons, and will inform its 
members about volunteer opportunities there, he said. Society tends to 
push seniors to the side, but there is no biblical basis for retirement 
from the Lord's work, Johnson said. There are 36 million Protestants 
age 50 and over in the United States, and that number is expected to 
double in 15 years as baby boomers age, he said. For information: CAP 
at Box 777, St. Charles, IL, 60174; 1-800-443-0227. 

Feeding the homeless can continue at Western Presbyterian Church in 
Washington, D.C., a federal court ruled (NIRR 3/21). Under pressure 
from area residents, the city's zoning board earlier this year voted to 
ban the church's feeding program when it moved to a neighborhood a few 
blocks away. The church's feeding program  in every respect is 
religious activity and a form of worship,  the judge said. Religious 
rights lawyers were delighted that the judge applied the Religious 
Freedom Restoration Act to ban the government from telling the church 
how to minister. 

Black males in prison outnumber those in college, a new study found. 
The 583,000 black males in prisons and jails outnumber the 537,000 
enrolled in higher education, according to a study by the Sentencing 
Project, a private group that promotes social welfare programs and 
alternatives to prison. America's incarceration rate reached a record 
high last year and is second worldwide only to Russia's. American 
prisons held 1.3 million inmates, and the incarceration rate reached an 
all-time high of 519 for every 100,000 Americans, up 22% since 1989, 
the group reported. Blacks are being incarcerated at six times the rate 
of whites. 

Restrictions on state funding for poor women's abortions in 
Pennsylvania were struck down in federal court last month. Judge John 
Fullam ruled that the state cannot require women who seek 
Medicaid-funded abortions for reasons of rape or incest to report the 
crimes. Also, those seeking lifesaving abortions cannot be required to 
obtain certification from a second, independent doctor. He said state 
law conflicted with a recent amendment to federal law that does not 
allow such stipulations to be placed upon Medicaid funding. Before the 
U.S. law was changed last year, federal funds could not be used to pay 
for abortions. The state has appealed the decision, contending there is 
no conflict between the state restrictions and federal law. 
...Clinics in the state meanwhile have found a loophole in another part 
of the law. The law requires doctors to inform women of their options 
and the risks to abortion at least 24 hours in advance. Clinics have 
placed a doctor's counsel on tape, enabling women simply to phone in 
ahead of time. Such recordings also are used in Kansas, Nebraska, Ohio, 
North Dakota, and Utah. An appeals court upheld the legality of 
telephone recordings in North Dakota. 

Killing abortionists to protect unborn children is immoral, a panel of 
Southern Baptist ethicists said. Their statement says that divine moral 
law permits killing as an  unintended effect of the act of defending 
oneself or another,  but not as a premeditated act. It rejects 
citizen-imposed capital punishment, saying that only governing 
authorities can execute criminals. Legalized abortion on demand is a 
failure of a legitimate democracy, not the  imposition or decree of an 
illegitimate regime. 
...The document emerged from a consultation organized by the Southern 
Baptist Christian Life Commission in response to fatal shootings at 
abortion clinics. It affirms the sanctity of human life from conception 
and the moral obligation to oppose abortion actively. But, says CLC 
director Richard Land, the statement seeks to fence off the  violent 
fringe  from the  vast majority of the pro-life movement, which abhors 
violent protests. 

Because he removed an 11-weekold fetus from the womb of a woman during 
a hysterectomy, a gynecologist faces a criminal trial in a central 
England town next month. Barbara Whiten, 35, said she had been trying 
to have children for many years, but agreed to a hysterectomy to 
relieve pain in her womb after doctors told her she was infertile. She 
said she was unaware that she was pregnant when she entered the 
hospital for the operation in March 1993. After the surgery, Dr. 
Reginald Dixon told her he had removed a male fetus. 

Dr. Benjamin Spock bemoans the lack of spirituality among Americans in 
his latest book, A Better World For Our Children: Rebuilding American 
Family Values. Spock, 91, wrote the book to cure what ails society 
rather than offer advice for fevers and rashes, which he did in Dr. 
Spock's Baby and Child Care. The book has sold 40 million copies since 
it was first published in 1945.  Society is really sick,  he told USA 
Today. But  most sicknesses can be overcome.  Spock said divorce, 
materialism, and violence could be reversed or corrected if people 
would concentrate more on spiritual values. 
...To some, spirituality means religious belief, Spock said. But to 
teach atheists and agnostics he included  non-religious spiritual 
beliefs such as  dedication to family, respect for others, honesty, and 
the desire to contribute to the betterment of society.  Spock has been 
more spiritual in the last few years, and consults with Dr. Deepak 
Chopra, a mind-body, anti-aging guru, the newspaper said. 
...The permissive label still haunts Spock. In 1968, Norman Vincent 
Peale blamed a lack of patriotism, responsibility, and discipline among 
young people on Spock's advice to give babies instant gratification. 
Peale was wrong. The accusation has persisted because people must have 
a scapegoat for irritating or troublesome children,  Spock said. 

The longing to live forever hasn't died. Adherents in 16 countries 
belong to People Forever International, a group for those who think 
they'll live forever. The group began in 1960 when co-founder Charles 
Brown experienced what he calls his  cellular awakening  while 
meditating, the Arizona Daily Star reported.  We are a species that has 
the ability to perpetually renew itself,  Brown said.  The important 
thing is tapping into the intelligence of the cells themselves. 
...Brown offers no guarantees of immortality, since rejuvenation is an 
individual process, he said. About three members have died. Audits of 
PFI showed that Brown and his wife received salaries of $266,981, a 
$52,000 housing allowance, and use of a Cadillac and Land Rover in the 
1992-93 fiscal year, the Daily Star said. Brown extols the virtues of 
not dying and dismisses allegations that People Forever is a cult. 

The Philadelphia Conference on Cults, Occult, and the Word-Faith 
Movement drew more than 700 members of evangelical and secular 
counter-cult groups late last month. The aim of the three-day 
conference, held at Calvary Chapel of Philadelphia, in Feasterville, 
was to educate and network with those in mainstream religion to fight 
the growing presence of cults nationwide. Some 50 workshops were held 
on David Koresh and the Branch Davidians, New Age influences in 
education, mind control, and corruption in televangelism. Evangelicals 
approach cults -- or new religions -- from a doctrinal, rather than a 
behavioral perspective according to Bill Alnor, executive director of 
Evangelical Ministries to New Religions. For secular organizations, the 
concern is unethical and deceptive methods, including mind-control 
techniques, used to recruit and maintain members. 
...The conference aired the increasingly public dissent within the 
counter-cult community. The keynote speaker, Hank Hanegraaff, president 
of Christian Research Institute of Irvine, Calif., was removed from a 
panel on the Word-Faith Movement when he refused to allow the session 
to be taped. Hanegraaff has been sued by several former employees who 
allege financial improprieties (NIRR 9/19). The consensus of the panel 
was that  Word-Faith  or prosperity doctrine -- whose proponents 
include Kenneth Hagin, Kenneth Copeland, and Frederick K.C. Price -- 
has cultic dimensions, Alnor told NIRR. 

Naropa Institute, the nation's only accredited Buddhist-inspired 
college, celebrated its 20th anniversary this summer. The Boulder, 
Colo., school gives its 500 students standard Western academic fare of 
classes, papers, and tests, but adds an Eastern emphasis on 
contemplation, personal experience, and self-awareness. Buddhist 
studies instructor Judith SimmerBrown told the Colorado Springs 
Gazette-Telegraph that the curriculum is not New Age.  With the New 
Age, people can do just about whatever they feel,  she said. Naropa 
Institute emphasizes discipline,  which may put us on the conservative 
edge of whatever is happening in Boulder. 

Stock car fans call it the racetrack revival. Those close to the racing 
scene say Christian influence in stock car racing is extensive. 
Hundreds of crew members and fans, as well as 30-35 of the 40 top 
drivers on the NASCAR circuit, regularly attend chapel services held in 
garages two hours before races. The services, as well as one-on-one 
evangelism, are organized by Motor Racing Outreach, based in Charlotte, 
N.C. The ministry started six years ago as a Bible study among stock 
car drivers Darrell Waltrip, Bobby Hillin, and Lake Speed and their 
wives. It since has become instrumental in racetrack evangelism around 
the country, with Motor Racing Outreach evangelists visiting ill or 
injured drivers in the hospital. 
...Citywide ministry built around NASCAR races is the next goal of 
stock car evangelists. Christian leaders are planning a citywide 
outreach during next summer's Brickyard 400 race to be held at the 
Indianapolis Speedway. The event could attract some 400,000 people. 
Brickyard Impact 1995 is a series of various evangelistic events taking 
place over several months prior to the race, which will involve 
outreaches by local churches and the business community. The 
Indianapolis outreach may become a model for similar citywide events 
nationwide, Ralph Drollinger, executive director of Sports Outreach 
America, told NIRR. 

Even heavily churched areas such as Western Mich. -- where 9 out of 10 
people claim some religious affiliation -- desperately need  a revival 
of real Christianity,  evangelist Luis Palau said. More than 68,000 
people attended Palau's crusades last month in Grand Rapids and 
Holland, and 3,460 committed their lives to Christ. Nearly half made 
first-time decisions, trusting Christ for salvation, Palau's 
organization said. Some 565 churches from 50 denominations organized 
the event. 
...Among those who recommitted their lives to Christ was Jeannie Yang, 
12, who made national headlines a year ago when she divorced her 
parents. A man and a woman on the brink of divorce came to the Old Kent 
Park stadium and sat in different sections, then, during the 
invitation, walked across the infield, talked, and went forward 
hand-in-hand to commit their lives and marriage to Christ. 

Some 500 evangelical Hispanic leaders from the United States, Puerto 
Rico, and Canada will hold an unprecedented convocation next month to 
decide whether to form Alianza de Ministerios Evangelicos (National 
Alliance of Evangelical Ministries). The meeting, which will take place 
Nov. 17-19 in Long Beach, Calif., includes general sessions and 
workshops on social action, evangelism, and economic development. The 
group would provide a forum to debate Hispanic issues and unify 
Hispanics of various denominations and nationalities, said Jesse 
Miranda. He is associate dean at C.P. Haggard Graduate School of 
Theology at Azuza Pacific University, and chair of the convocation. 
...Hispanics have been  pretty much invisible  to the National 
Association of Evangelicals, Miranda told NIRR. The NAE has remained  
totally unaware of what is happening in the Hispanic community,  he 
said. They go about their business, and their issues are not our 
issues.  The NAE's Hispanic Commission has not addressed Hispanic 
concerns adequately, Miranda said. Billy Melvin of the NAE and Aaron 
Hamlin of the National Association of Black Evangelicals have been 
invited to the convocation and plan to attend, Miranda said. Also 
attending will be Esdras Betancourt, chairman of the Hispanic 
Commission of the NAE. The NAE group is composed of 15-20 key Hispanic 
leaders, but  can not do what a national association of Hispanics can 
do,  he told NIRR.  There is a desire for more unity and a bigger voice 
for Hispanics in the church.  An estimated 4 million Hispanics live in 
the United States, and a million more live in Puerto Rico and Canada. 
Some 25%-30% of the Hispanic population is evangelical Protestant, most 
of them Pentecostal, Miranda said. 

The first nondenominational, all Spanish-language satellite radio 
network began operation Sept 1. World Radio Network, a ministry of HCJB 
Radio, provides 24-hour programming in the United States and northern 
Mexico. Shows include 70% music and 30% teaching and preaching, 
including Spanish versions of popular Christian programs such as Focus 
on the Family, Insight for Living, and Radio Bible Class. Some programs 
from HCJB and TransWorld Radio also are included. The new satellite 
service, called Radio Cadena Manantial, serves five Spanish stations in 
Texas owned by World Radio Network, with a new station under 
construction in Nogales, Ariz. The goal is to establish stations in 
major Hispanic areas around the United States, the network said. 

Many of England's historic cathedrals are so desperate for money that 
they are seeking advertisers. The choir at Bristol Cathedral, for 
example, is sponsored by the British power conglomerate Nuclear 
Electric, Ecumenical News International reported. Lincoln Cathedral has 
been backed by the National Westminster Bank. 
...Selling off treasures even has been contemplated. The unique 
medieval map of the world -- the  Mappa Mundi  -- in the care of the 
Hereford Cathedral was withdrawn from sale only when a benefactor 
offered a large amount of money to save it. 
...The cost of maintaining and repairing the cathedrals is substantial. 
They have withstood the winds and elements for centuries and now must 
compete with the grime and pollution of the industrial age. Some of the 
country's 43 Anglican cathedrals attract tourists. Others are seldom on 
the itinerary, but still must be maintained for parish use. 
...A dilemma confronts these churches. Sponsors expect a return for 
their money, including several discreet advertisements placed where 
worshipers will see them. But some say cathedrals risk losing their 
proper atmosphere as houses of prayer. When Salisbury Cathedral began 
negotiating with McDonalds, the public protest was so great the idea 
was dropped, ENI reported. 

Early morning prayer is common in churches in South Korea. Every day of 
the year, no church in South Korea is without early morning prayer 
meetings, according to C. Peter Wagner, professor at Fuller Theological 
Seminary and author of Churches That Pray. When Wagner visited 
Myong-Song Presbyterian Church at 6 a.m., 4,000 people were praying. 
Meetings also had been held at 4 and 5 that morning, with the senior 
pastor leading, Wagner told Beacon magazine. In most Christian 
churches, many believers come at 10 p.m. on Friday and pray together 
until dawn. In the Yoido Full Gospel Church, 10,000 people pray through 
the night. More than 200 churches have purchased mountains on which 
prayer retreat centers are built. On David Yonggi Cho's mountain, 3,000 
people are always praying, and the number swells to 10,000 on weekends. 
...In New York City, several largelyKorean churches hold prayer 
meetings at 5 or 6 a.m. every day. Many of these churches are located 
in the Flushing section of Queens, which has one of the highest 
concentrations of Korean churches in the United States. All-night 
prayer sessions recently appeared in the United States, also. Members 
of Brooklyn Tabernacle pray all night six nights a week at the church. 
In 1990, 400 Korean businessmen paid for 40 black pastors to travel to 
Korea to see the fervor of believers there, Mack Pier of Concerts of 
Prayer International told NIRR. That gesture has spawned other attempts 
at reconciliation between blacks and Koreans, whose relationship in New 
York often is characterized by mistrust, he said. 

Children dying from Chernobyl radiation will get help from the Slavic 
Gospel Association. The children suffer from radiation-related 
illnesses, including leukemia and immune-system deficiency problems. 
They live in camps of 150-200 in Minsk, Belarus. Many have been 
abandoned by families that cannot care for them. 
...Christian churches in Belarus are caring for the children, but lack 
sufficient food, vitamins, and vaccines. SGA plans to begin providing 
these commodities next month, and to help train indigenous youth 
workers to minister to the children. Puppets and sound systems will be 
provided. Many children in the camps realize they are dying and have a 
great desire for spiritual comfort, SGA said. 

The Caribbean Mercy, part of Youth With A Mission's Mercy Ships fleet, 
plucked a dozen Cuban refugees from the water as their raft began to 
sink, YWAM said. The ship was on its way to the Dominican Republic when 
it came across the raft eight miles off the coast of Cuba. After 
treating the Cubans -- adults and children -- for dehydration and heat 
exhaustion, the ship handed the refugees over to the U.S. Coast Guard. 

President Clinton read the Bible as he sought guidance on whether to 
send U.S. troops to Haiti. Quoting unnamed friends of the president, 
U.S. News and World Report said Clinton found comfort and justification 
for military intervention in King David's words in Psalm 72. In the 
passage, David expresses confidence that God would help him, as a just 
ruler, relieve the suffering of the weak and break in pieces the 
oppressor. 
...Jimmy Carter taught his Sunday school class at Maranatha Baptist 
Church after his return from Haiti to Plains, Ga. He told the 300 
members and guests that Clinton's first four words on hearing the 
Haitian leadership's decision not to fight were, Thank God, thank God. 
...Carter said that the Haitian military leader, Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, 
had made a pact with his family to stay in their house during the 
invasion, even if it meant death. It was Mrs. Cedras who persuaded her 
husband to change his mind, Carter added. He also reportedly invited 
Cedras, a Methodist, to visit the Plains Sunday school class. 

Rwanda: Who is in charge of the churches?  The Holy Spirit,  Antoine 
Rutaisire of the evangelical group African Enterprise said. The few 
remaining pastors in the country face numerous challenges. The most 
immediate concern is the absence of pastors, priests, and church 
leaders, many of whom were killed or fled in the brutal ethnic violence 
that decimated their homeland. At least 92 Roman Catholic priests and 
350 monks, nuns, and lay workers were killed, including the archbishop 
of Kigali and two bishops, News Network International reported. 
Protestant leadership was equally devastated. Most top leaders 
evacuated to Kenya, Zaire, or the United States. There also have been 
massive losses in church memberships. One diocese of 250,000 members 
now numbers less than 10,000, and  we don't know how many will come 
back,  a leader said. Destruction and looting of church property is 
widespread. 
...The church also has a severe credibility crisis. Churches were 
discredited by aligning themselves far too much with the former 
Hutu-dominated regime and tribal politics, said Samuel Issac of the 
World Council of Churches. Christians took part in many massacres, 
according to Michael Twagirayesu, chairman of the Rwandan Bible 
Society.  We have to forget about all church memberships and evangelize 
Rwanda anew,  he said in the magazine Biblereport. About 80% of the 7.4 
million people belonged to a church in Rwanda, considered the most 
Christianized country in Central Africa. About 50% are Catholic and 30% 
are Protestant. 
...Nevertheless, surviving Christian leaders inside Rwanda are 
optimistic about starting over. Aid is coming from abroad, and some 
church refugees are returning. World Vision is training Christian 
trauma counselors, health professionals, and clergy mentors. The 
Christian relief agency also plans to develop a mass media campaign for 
reconciliation, establish a national conference for surviving church 
leaders, and implement regional reconciliation conferences, rallies and 
public meetings. Kigali authorities have approached Catholic Relief 
Services to help rebuild the ruined country, citing the relief agency 
as one of the few religious groups that still has credibility among 
Rwandans. 

German Christians are traveling to various European countries to ask 
forgiveness for Nazi war crimes. Ways to Reconciliation is a joint 
initiative of Catholic and Protestant charismatic groups. Participants 
speak at local church services. On Sept. 1, 1994, 55 years after the 
outbreak of World War II, the first group went to Poland to visit 
Gleiwitz, Auschwitz, and Krakau, according to the German Evangelical 
Alliance's publication Idea. Friedrich Aschoff, a founder of the group, 
said Christians want to ask God's forgiveness for ourselves and all 
those who cannot do so themselves.  Plans call for visiting 1% of the 
23,600 places in 29 European countries where German atrocities took 
place. 

The extradition of  Carlos the Jackal  from Sudan to France included a 
secret agreement that will harm the Christian minority of the African 
nation. The German news magazine Focus reported that to ensure the 
international terrorist's arrest, France supplied Sudan's central 
government with satellite pictures of rebel positions in southern 
Sudan. The mostly Christian population in the south has been oppressed 
by the country's fundamentalist Islamic leadership in a civil war that 
has raged since 1955 and has taken more than 2 million lives, Focus 
reported. 
...Carlos was arrested by French anti-terrorism experts Aug. 14 in the 
Sudanese capital of Khartoum. He is charged with planning and executing 
numerous plots for the People's Front for the Liberation of Palestine, 
and with killing 83 people. 

Religious police in Saudi Arabia burst into a Protestant church service 
in the capital of Riyadh, disrupting a congregation of about 50 
Filipino migrant workers, the French branch of Open Doors reported. 
Police arrested Filipino pastor Joel Cunanan and seven congregants, 
apparently on grounds that the service was illegal. 
...Churches are banned in Saudi Arabia. Services for internationals 
usually are conducted at embassies or discreetly in private homes. 
Americans attend services hosted at the British embassy. Cunanan and 
four others still were being held last month, the group said. 

A Christian business that helps others has taken hold in Beijing 
without interference by authorities, The Associated Press reported. The 
company, Holy Love Service Center, is run from of a two-room apartment 
by Wang Meiru, a 51-year-old divorcee who became a Christian 10 years 
ago. I was so beaten down by the Communist Party that I had no hope but 
to believe in Christianity,  she said. Wang was inspired to start her 
business ministry by a pastor who observed that many elderly people 
have no one to help with heavy jobs around the house. Holy Love sends 
workers to clients' homes to perform household chores such as shopping, 
fixing appliances, and tutoring children. Most of the several dozen 
workers are fellow believers. 
...A Chinese diplomat said he calls on Holy Love for chores around his 
house because Wang's workers are Christians who would not rob or cheat 
him. Holy Love barely breaks even because it donates services to the 
poor. Wang sometimes lets workers keep their earnings instead of 
deducting a percentage to cover expenses. 

India's education ministry vetoed plans to introduce sex education in 
the nation's schools. After months of debate, officials said they 
decided classrooms are not the appropriate forum to teach human 
sexuality. Religious and conservative leaders argued that it is a 
parent's responsibility to do that and not the government's. They said 
sex education in the classroom may send the wrong message to young 
people and promote promiscuity rather than abstinence. Proponents 
contended that parents are lax in their responsibility at home, and 
that with the onset of sexual content in the mass media, young people 
need proper information. Health experts, citing more than 1.6 million 
cases of the HIV infection, warned that the country faces a catastrophe 
from AIDS that education could help prevent. 

Islamic law in Bangladesh should be replaced by modern law in which men 
and women have equal rights, refugee feminist writer Taslima Nasrin, 
32, told a symposium on freedom of expression in Stavenger, Norway. 
Nasrin, a physician and an atheist, fled to Sweden after Islamic 
fundamentalists demanded her death after publication of her views in an 
Indian newspaper (NIRR 7/11). 
...She told the symposium that, in the interview, she had called for 
changes in Islamic law, upon which Muslim views of the family and women 
are based. Instead, she said, the reporter wrote that she had called 
for complete revision of the Koran, setting off a national furor and 
calls for her death. At the Stavenger conference, she called on  all 
the people of the world to fight against [Islamic] fundamentalism. 

California's domestic partner bill was vetoed by Gov. Pete Wilson last 
month. The bill would have allowed unmarried couples, homosexual or 
heterosexual, to register with the state and gain some of the same 
rights as married couples. Of the 10.4 million households in 
California, nearly 500,000 consist of unmarried couples, and more than 
90% of them are opposite-sex couples, according to the 1990 census. 
Proponents of the bill insist it would have helped older people who 
might lose Social Security or pension benefits if they were to marry. 
Opponents argued that the bill would advance the gay lifestyle. Wilson, 
a Republican, said government should not undermine marriage  by 
offering a substitute relationship. 

Michigan United Methodists are in an uproar over a pastor's 
announcement that he is gay. Richard Rossiter told the Detroit Free 
Press that he received the blessing of his area superintendent and 
Bishop Donald Ott before notifying his 287-member congregation in 
Coloma. After making the announcement, Rossiter filed for divorce from 
his wife. They have two children, ages 6 and 9. More than 80 
parishioners and clergy demanded he resign, the newspaper said. 
Rossiter, reputedly the first openly gay pastor of a UMC congregation, 
said that although he is homosexual, he has remained celibate.  I look 
forward to meeting a single lifemate in a committed, faithful 
relationship. 

Mary Ann Lundy was nominated to serve as a deputy general secretary of 
the World Council of Churches, the WCC announced. Lundy was forced to 
resign an executive post in the Presbyterian Church (USA) after helping 
plan the controversial  REImagining  conference on feminist theology 
(NIRR  5/30). According to the announcement, an unidentified WCC 
spokesman said Lundy had been chosen  entirely on merit.  The WCC 
Central Committee will vote on her selection next month. That is 
usually a formality.

Students in 20 countries on six continents will pray on the morning of 
Sept. 21 during this year's See You at the Pole campaign (NIRR 9/6/93). 
More than one million students in elementary, junior high, and high 
schools, and colleges are expected to gather at 7 a.m. local time at 
their school flagpoles to pray for their communities, nation, and the 
world. 
... Across the Nation, Around the World,  the 1994 theme, reflects 
increasing international participation in the event, according to Doug 
Clark of the National Network of Youth Ministries. In addition to the 
United States and Canada, participation is particularly strong in 
Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia, Clark told NIRR. Some adults also 
pray with the students, although the event is specifically student-led. 
Jim Henderson of American Center for Law and Justice has encouraged 
adults  to stand behind them -- far behind them. 
...Several student ministries -including InterVarsity, Navigators, and 
Campus Crusade for Christ -have encouraged participation in SYATP as 
the beginning of their fall campus events, Clark said. Last year, more 
than a million youths participated, said researcher George Barna, who 
surveyed the prayer gatherings. 
...A few meetings drew opposition and legal challenges from the 
American Civil Liberties Union last year, but the group has made an 
apparent turnaround. ACLU spokesman Robert Peck said his organization 
would defend students who were told they could not pray. According to 
the Rutherford Institute, students have a legal right to meet in school 
yards during noncurricular times and to distribute religious 
literature, as long as they do not disrupt school or infringe on the 
rights of others. 
...A 24-hour hotline gives basic information about SYATP. The number is 
619-592-9200. 

Student prayer has no place at school other than at high school 
graduations, U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate ruled. He said a 
Mississippi law was too broad to be constitutional, but added that 
prayer at graduations is protected by past court rulings. The law, 
which took effect July 1, would have allowed students to pray at school 
activities if they initiated it (NIRR 1/24). It also sanctioned 
voluntary  nonsectarian and non-proselytizing  benedictions and 
invocations. The legislation was introduced after a Jackson school 
principal, Bishop Knox, was suspended for letting students read prayers 
over the intercom (NIRR 12/27/93). 

A Michigan public school can no longer display a portrait of Jesus 
Christ that has hung in the school since it opened in 1962. The ruling 
by the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati upheld a 
federal district judge's decision (NIRR 12/13/93) in favor of Eric 
Pensinger, a 1993 graduate of Bloomingdale High School. Pensinger, an 
agnostic, objected to the display of Warner Sallman's Head of Christ. 
School officials argued that the painting should be allowed to stay, 
given the school's tradition and Jesus' role as a historical figure. 
The American Civil Liberties Union sued the Bloomingdale School 
District in 1992 on behalf of Pensinger and his mother. They argued 
that the school has no right to make a non-Christian feel like an 
outcast by displaying a picture of Jesus, and that the portrait caused 
Pensinger  psychological damage. The court rejected the school 
district's argument that the complaint was rendered inconsequential 
when Pensinger graduated, saying that other students could be affected 
as well. Senior Circuit Judge Ralph Guy concurred in the decision, but 
said it regrettably established  a class of `eggshell' plaintiffs.  If 
the school does not contest the decision within 30 days, it must remove 
the portrait, which has hung covered during the appeal process, the 
court ruled. 

Christians are befriending needy children in southwestern Michigan 
public schools. Adult volunteers spend at least one hour a week 
one-on-one with an elementary school child in the program Kids Hope 
USA. Academic tutoring is mixed with encouragement and hugs, Virgil 
Gulker said. He developed Kids Hope USA for International Aid, Inc., a 
Christian humanitarian organization based in Spring Lake, Mich. Each 
church contributes at least 10 volunteers, who undergo screening -- 
including a police check - and receive training. After a trial period, 
the program is expected to branch out across the United States. 
...Having someone to trust is worth more to a needy child than all the 
holiday baskets and clothing drives that now make up most churches' aid 
to the poor, Gulker said. Churches often shy away from public schools 
and complain about them instead of helping, yet many Christians are 
prepared to get involved in somebody's lives but don't know how, Gulker 
told NIRR. 

Three Sikh children can attend classes while wearing ceremonial knives 
(NIRR 5/2). A federal appeals court in San Francisco reversed a federal 
ruling and ordered the Livingstone (Calif.) Union School District to 
allow the knives, called kirpans. An attorney for the Sikhs cited the 
federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and the appeals court 
majority agreed. The California Legislature last month approved 
legislation allowing students to wear the knives for religious reasons, 
making the court case unnecessary (NIRR 9/5). 

Conservative Christian groups dismissed a People for the American Way 
report on censorship in public schools as hype. PAW said it documented 
462 challenges to library books, classroom materials, and a range of 
school programs and policies in 46 states during the 1993-94 school 
year. Of these challenges, 42% were successful, PAW said. PAW president 
Arthur J. Kropp blamed  right-wing political leaders.  But the 
Washington, D.C.-based Family Research Council accused PAW of trying to 
scare the public with overblown  stories of renegade parents 
`censoring' innocent children.  Christians who object to school 
materials are not censors but concerned parents who want what's best 
for their children,  Tom Minnery of Focus on the Family said. 

An elementary-school teacher spent six months visiting the homes of 
each of her 600 students to tell them about Christ. Joyce Gleave of 
Mustang, Okla., a public school teacher, has taught art in grades one 
through five for 23 years. At school, she was not permitted to 
distribute the 600 tiny olive wood crosses she brought back from a trip 
to the Holy Land. So she went to every student's home and gave each 
child a cross as well as a tract about salvation. The kids were 
thrilled, she wrote in Pentecostal Evangel. Not one parent was 
unpleasant or made Gleave feel unwelcome, and  many were moved to tears 
that I cared for their child,  she said. 

A course for interested non-Christians, taught in 400 United Kingdom 
churches, is helping thousands find faith. Alpha courses instruct 
groups of 12-30 inquirers in the tenets of the faith. The atmosphere is 
informal. Courses last several weeks since people who are raised 
without a Christian background need time to overcome suspicions, said 
the man who developed Alpha courses, Nicky Gumbel. He is curate at Holy 
Trinity in Brompton, England. 
...Since most church members know few non-Christians, the first Alpha 
courses usually draw church people and a few skeptical spouses. 
Inactive members, and then outsiders, hear about the course from 
enthusiastic students. The courses help congregations that have 
attracted no new members  break this vicious cycle, Gumbel said. 

Campus Crusade for Christ premiered its latest evangelistic film, The 
Scarlet Thread of Redemption, in Moscow. Many Russian leaders -- 
including members of Parliament, artists, and military officers -- 
attended the premiere of the Russian-language film, according to CCC 
founder Bill Bright. During the trip to Moscow, Bright prayed with 
members of the Russian Parliament for the future of their country. He 
also met with the head of the Russian navy. 

A Christian convert who showed the Jesus film in the former Soviet 
republic of Uzbekistan was arrested, tortured, and interned in a mental 
institution for several weeks. News Network International said the man, 
who became a Christian six years ago, was threatened by town elders in 
Samarkhand, local Muslim leaders, and KGB officials. The man, whose 
name has not been released, showed the film at least 25 times to crowds 
ranging from 50 to 350 at town halls, schools, and orphanages. 
...At the mental institution, he was taken to the basement, where he 
was beaten severely and burned on his arms, legs, and other parts of 
his body, NNI reported. 

Only tonight have I learned that God is for us and not against us,  
said one of several Holocaust survivors who embraced Jesus as Messiah 
last month in Belarus. The 100 Holocaust survivors were honored during 
a fourday festival that drew 23,000 people to a messianic Jewish 
festival in the capital city of Minsk. Some 7,000 people came to faith 
in Christ during the festival, organized by Hear O Israel Ministries of 
Rochester, N.Y. (NIRR 6/13). The group also has held festivals in 
Moscow and St. Petersburg, Russia, where it plans to open a Bible 
school and leadership training center this month. Another festival is 
planned Oct. 19-22 in Kiev, Ukraine. 
...The Minsk festival had a unifying effect among Jews and non-Jews 
throughout the country, David Levine of Hear O Israel reported the 
president of Belarus as saying. Nevertheless, the festivals have faced 
opposition from Orthodox Jews and ultranationalist anti-Semitic 
factions, Levine said. Moscow police foiled an attempt by the 
neo-fascist group Legion Werewolf to set fire to Olympic Stadium during 
the festival's closing night in Moscow, Levine said. 

A bus service run by Christians has helped more than 8,500 Jews 
emigrate from Ukraine in the last three years.  Exobus Project  buses 
take Jews from various cities to airports in Odessa and Kiev, the only 
Ukrainian cities where El Al Airlines lands. Travel by train or bus 
often is impossible or dangerous for Jews in Ukraine, according to Phil 
Hunter. He is director of Hull, England-based Good News Travels, which 
operates the service. 
...Exobus Project has one minibus, three coaches, and three vans. They 
are staffed by 20 volunteers from nine nations. On board, passengers 
sip hot drinks, get help with customs paperwork, and read a sheet of 
Old Testament Scriptures relating to the return to Israel of the Jewish 
people. Passengers pay a nominal fee, and the impoverished travel free. 
Funding comes from the International Christian Embassy Jerusalem. 
Ukraine has a tragic history of anti-Semitism, and as the economic 
situation worsens and political instability increases,  the possibility 
of the Jewish people again becoming a scapegoat is a distinct one, 
Hunter told NIRR. 

The first Jewish school in 25 years opened in Poland with 15 pupils. 
Sponsored by the cosmeticsfunded Lauder Foundation, it is located next 
to Warsaw's only synagogue. Poland's Jewish community once numbered 3 
million, but the Nazis killed most of them. The country's last Jewish 
school, in Lodz, was closed in 1969 by Communist rulers during an 
anti-Semitic purge, according to news accounts. 

Catholic taxi drivers in Seoul, South Korea, give preferential 
treatment to physically handicapped passengers. The Catholic Taxi 
Drivers Association of Seoul has 400 specially marked taxis that pick 
up disabled passengers from taxi stands first, Asia Focus reported. The 
effort will take extra  time, attention, and patience,  a taxi official 
said.  But we believe it is a Christian mission for us. 

Enemies cooperated in the name of Jesus in Burundi. Campus Crusade 
workers there had planned a mass evangelism campaign when an attempted 
coup and civil war broke out in the nation, located south of Rwanda. 
Hundreds of thousands died in the fighting between Hutus and Tutsis, 
and three-quarters of a million people fled the country. 
...As terror and massacres swept the countryside in Burundi, Campus 
Crusade's local director, Prosper N'Dabishuriye, prayed with 50 pastors 
who had agreed to participate in EXPLO '93. They decided to proceed 
with the campaign, which aimed to saturate Bujumbura, the capital city, 
with the gospel. On Dec. 27, 1993, the first day of EXPLO '93,  
something unusual happened  as  peace replaced war  in Bujumbura, 
Worldwide Challenge magazine said. On four consecutive days, 1,500 
Christians took to the streets to communicate the gospel. 
...People from one ethnic group stayed out late at night witnessing in 
areas dominated by the opposing ethnic group, the magazine said. Four 
Spiritual Laws booklets were presented to 18,500 people, and 35,000 
attended the 30 evangelistic meetings. During the four days, 13,052 
people indicated they had become followers of Jesus Christ. 

At least 70 people were killed in an attack during a recent mass at a 
Catholic church in northeastern Burundi, the Red Cross reported. Most 
were Hutu women and children. Aid workers said the attack followed 
replacement of the former bishop, who is a member of the Tutsi minority 
that ruled the country for three decades until last year, with a Hutu 
bishop. 

Five Christians were crucified in Sudan since July, reports say. A 
Sudanese Anglican bishop said he received confirmation that an Anglican 
priest and two believers from an unidentified Christian church died 
when they were crucified in the Nuba Mountains in July, News Network 
International reported. The executioners used sixinch-long nails. 
...Two Catholic converts in Wad Medani were sentenced by an Islamic law 
court to be crucified, the German press agency Idea Pressedienst said. 
Anglican Bishop Daniel Zindo said widows and orphans of slain Christian 
men are sold into slavery in north Sudan and Libya for $15 apiece. 

Medical missionaries and other doctors working in troubled developing 
countries face a one-in-four risk of acquiring AIDS, the founder of a 
British AIDS charity warned. Patrick Dixon of ACET (AIDS Care, 
Education, and Training) based his warning partly on an estimate that 
one-fourth of hospital patients in countries such as Uganda and Rwanda 
are HIV-positive. Every time a doctor cuts himself while performing an 
operation or is spattered in the face by a patient's blood, the risk 
heightens, he said. His warning is in a book, The Truth About AIDS, 
published by ACET. The charity is sending 7,000 copies to developing 
countries. 

The Vatican surprised many delegates at the United Nations population 
conference in Cairo this month when it gave limited support to a 
20-year blueprint for slowing the world's population growth. The forum 
focused not only on birth control, but on two concepts the Vatican 
backs: economic development, and giving women more power in their 
lives. Educated women have fewer babies, research shows. The Vatican 
had rejected final documents at 1974 and 1984 conferences. 
...The Holy See infuriated some diplomats with its vigorous fight to 
keep liberal abortion language out of the plan. It allied itself with 
more than a dozen Muslim nations, which objected to specific points in 
the sections on reproductive rights. The Vatican won limited support 
from 10 Latin American countries, but not from Brazil, the world's 
largest Roman Catholic country. Vatican delegates failed to block 
worldwide recognition that  abortion is a fact of life that governments 
must treat as an issue of public health,  The Associated Press said. 
But it did chip away at abortion language including:  Recognition that 
parents should be involved in adolescent sex counseling.  Elimination 
of  pregnancy termination  from the definition of reproductive health 
care.  Deletion of the phrase  sexual rights  from the document.  Two 
mentions that abortion should not be promoted as a method of family 
planning.  Inclusion of language that family and reproductive health 
matters should conform to local laws, cultures, ethics, and religions. 
...The plan is not legally binding on any nation, but does carry moral 
weight. It also bolsters the arguments of politicians and private 
groups that will be lobbying for its implementation. Funding remains a 
major challenge. Delegates set a target of $17 billion a year by 2000. 
...Controversy swirled outside the conference halls as well. An  
alternative  conference of mostly prolife and conservative religious 
delegates drew up its own recommended population plan. Muslim delegates 
convened separately for two days to plot how to make U.N. plans conform 
to Islamic beliefs and practices. Some Muslim states refused to take 
part at all in the U.N. conference. 
...American pro-life activist Keith Tucci was jailed briefly by Cairo 
police, allegedly on the basis of a complaint by a U.S. State 
Department official. Tucci credited help by Rep. Christopher Smith 
(R-N.J.) for his quick release. 

Billboards throughout Portugal feature a priest leaning against a 
motorcycle with a bottle of Royal Crown Cola and urging passers-by to  
Take this all of you, and drink.  Another billboard features a 
Carmelite nun kissing bottles of the soft drink, according to EP News 
Service. 
...Meanwhile, a billboard promoting San Miguel Beer uses an altered 
photo of the famous statue of Christ the King, which stands above Rio 
de Janeiro, Brazil. The ad shows Christ holding a mug of beer in one 
outstretched arm, while the other arm tips a beer to his lips. 

Luke Huber, head of a group that is planting churches along Brazil's 
Amazon River basin (NIRR 1/24), was killed in an airplane crash Aug. 4. 
Huber, 44, founder and director of Project Amazon, called PAZ, died on 
impact when the ultralight he was piloting stalled 300 feet above Lago 
Grande Lake and crashed, observers said. Huber and a passenger, who 
survived, were returning to the PAZ base from a village meeting. He 
leaves a wife and four children. 
...A family member told NIRR that Huber, who traveled extensively in 
Brazil, often said,  I am immortal until the Lord decides it's time for 
me to go home. 

An American missionary is striking a chord with Chile's elite. Gail 
Pauls of Charlotte, N.C.-based SIM is a violinist whose assignment is 
to play her instrument as  God's ambassador to the materially rich,  
according to SIM NOW. Pauls has performed with La Filharmonica in 17 
operas and concerts. The music is challenging, as is persuading the 
wealthy in Santiago that a relationship with God is not merely an 
emotional crutch for the poor, she said. 

Nothing is more important to God than rescuing what he created, 
evangelist Alberto Mottesi told a crowd of 30,000 at Panamerican 
Stadium in Cali, Colombia. The city, sometimes known as the drug and 
murder capital of the world, also has a high rate of uterine cancer and 
AIDS due to sexual promiscuity, Mottesi said. Among those who responded 
to Mottesi's message were prostitutes, drug dealers, homosexuals, and 
AIDS sufferers. 
... The light of the gospel penetrated the darkest realms of a society 
afflicted by corruption, immorality, and dysfunctional families,  
according to Eduardo Gomez, president of the Pastoral Association of 
Bogota. 
...Earlier, in Costa Rica, among those who committed their lives to 
Christ in the town of Perez Zeledon's were its most prominent 
prostitute and a well-known lawyer who had described himself as an 
atheist, Mottesi said. In Punta Arenas, 11 drug dealers came forward 
for salvation, which prompted other people to come to the stadium to 
see what was happening, an organizer said. 

About 40 military chaplains and their assistants are working 10-12 
hours a day, seven days a week, ministering to refugees and military 
personnel at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Baptist Press reported. Among other 
tasks, they lead Bible studies, prayer, and other religious services. 
More than 200 Haitian adults were baptized at one camp site, Southern 
Baptist chaplain Joe Cappar said last month. The chaplains also assist 
in social work among the refugees, Cappar said. Stress is deep and 
tensions are high in the camps, he said, but  opportunities for 
ministry abound. 

Sunday service turned into a Sunday of service for 250 members of Park 
Road Baptist Church in Charlotte, N.C. The pastor canceled the Aug. 21 
morning meeting and encouraged members to do acts of kindness in the 
community. Volunteers fanned out to 15 sites to paint and landscape a 
chapel for the homeless, clean concrete blocks for Habitat for Humanity 
homes, wallpaper and paint an emergency shelter, feed the poor, and 
lead devotionals at a nursing home. Senior adults and children stayed 
at the church to make tote bags and blankets for the homeless. The day 
closed with a 7 p.m. service at the church. 
... It became a religious renewal for our people,  senior minister 
Allen Laymon told NIRR. He said many of his congregants gave money to 
groups that minister to the poor,  but never had rubbed shoulders  with 
them. 

A pastor spent 22 hours in an open-air steeple, until parishioners and 
passers-by filled the church steps with food for a hunger center. David 
Bahr is pastor of Archwood United Church of Christ in Cleveland. Bahr 
fortified himself with a blanket, sleeping bag, food, lawn chair, 
cellular phone, and a urinal. His time in the tower netted $4,000 worth 
of goods, which covered the church's 10 36-foot-wide steps when he 
descended from the steeple, United Church News reported. 
...After the 6 p.m. news showed Bahr climbing the rickety ladders to 
the church's eight-story steeple, donations started coming from all 
over Cleveland.  Donations usually fall off in the summer, and I wanted 
to fill the shelves,  he said. 

Praising God loudly is no reason to be prosecuted, pastor Robert Wesley 
Hill of True Apostolic Assembly Church in Minneapolis contends. Hill 
has been ticketed a number of times for violating the city's noise 
ordinance, thanks to the shouting and amplified music at services of 
his boisterous 150-member congregation. He was arrested and jailed 
briefly last month for failing to show up for a court appearance. He 
said he was out of town at the time. Neighbors have registered 72 
complaints to the city over the past year, records show. The situation 
is worse in summer, when church windows are open. 
...Decibel levels approaching the noise of jets flying over the 
neighborhood were recorded by a city inspector. A city council member 
said he has arranged for the installation of storm windows at no charge 
to the church, and is raising money for air conditioning so that the 
windows can remain shut on hot summer days. 

Vast majorities of Americans said they believe in God (95%) and heaven 
(90%), according to the latest Harris Poll. But the survey also found 
significant numbers who identify themselves as Christians but who do 
not believe in some tenets of their faith. 
...Of the four in five people who describe themselves as Christian, 99% 
believe in God, 89% in the survival of the soul after death, 87% in 
miracles, 85% in the virgin birth of Christ, 78% in the devil, and 77% 
in hell. Harris officials said it was surprising to find that many 
non-Christians in the poll embrace uniquely Christian beliefs. These 
include the 52% who believe in the resurrection, and 49% who believe in 
the virgin birth of Christ. 

Half of U.S. adults by the year 2000 will be single, and churches need 
to do more for people without spouses, said Tim Cleary, a singles 
ministry specialist for the Southern Baptist Convention. He cautioned 
that churches need to be careful not to think of themselves as  
marriage bureaus.  They should be  showing single adults how to live 
their lives as whole people,  he said. 

Promise Keepers plans to finish what it started this summer in Texas. 
During the national men's convention in Denton June 11, a storm cleared 
the stadium, toppled a section of the stage, and shortened the 
schedule. So the group has reserved Texas Stadium in Irving, on Oct. 
28-29 for PK Texas II. Speakers include pastors Greg Laurie, Jack 
Hayford, Daniel DeLeon, and Louis Patterson, Jr.; Ed Cole of Christian 
Men's Network; author Gary Smalley; Wellington Boone of New Generation 
Campus Ministries; and Charles Swindoll of Dallas Theological Seminary. 
Some 230,000 men attended PK events this spring and summer, the 
Boulder, Colo.-based group reported. 

Greg Laurie drew 28,000 people over three nights to his Harvest Crusade 
in Sacramento, Calif., this month (NIRR 7/25). Some 240 churches from 
20 denominations participated in the event, held at the Arco Arena. It 
was Laurie's first indoor crusade. Some 2,216 people responded to 
invitations to commit their lives to Christ. More than 284,000 people 
have attended Laurie's Harvest Crusades this year in Anaheim, San 
Diego, and Sacramento, Calif., and Honolulu. The final 1994 Harvest 
crusade is in Albuquerque, N.M., on Oct. 28. 

Salvation Army workers remained throughout the night at the scene of 
the crash of USAir flight 427 near Pittsburgh. Forty volunteers and 
staff provided meals, refreshments, and counseling for families and 
friends of victims waiting for the flight at Allegheny County Airport. 
They also assisted security and disaster workers. 
...Others workers provided food at the temporary morgue at the airport 
after the crash, in which 132 passengers and crew died. Officers and 
staff also provided counseling and support for families of victims in 
Chicago, where the flight originated.  

Warning stickers are affixed to some Gideon Bibles in hotel rooms. 
Atheist and agnostic members of the Madison, Wis.-based Freedom From 
Religion Foundation are affixing the labels as a protest. FFRF 
spokesman Dan Barker, a former Pentecostal pastor, said the group is 
trying to discredit the Gideons and send a message to hotel guests.  
We're offended to have these Bibles in our rooms,  he told the 
Nashville Banner. 
...One label warns against taking the Bible literally. A newer one 
alleges that the Old Testament figure Gideon was a mass murderer. This 
one may have especially irked the Nashville-based Gideons 
International, Barker suggested. He said the group warned FFRF in a 
letter to stop placing stickers on Bibles, citing possible copyright or 
trademark infringement. The Gideons declined to comment on the flap, 
the Banner reported. The lay evangelistic organization gave out 40 
million Bibles free throughout the world last year, it said. 

Motivational speaker Peter Lowe is promising audiences quick tips on 
wealth and happiness -- and also is delivering spiritual renewal. Lowe 
runs Success '94, a traveling inspirational seminar that he takes to 40 
North American cities a year, drawing crowds up to 17,000. In addition 
to Lowe's own presentations, other speakers include former Secretary of 
Defense Dick Cheney, Desert Storm commander Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, 
Crystal Cathedral pastor Robert Schuller, and motivational speaker Zig 
Ziglar. Lowe speaks on the subject How To Sell More Effectively, 
including a pitch for Christianity as the path to personal success. 
...In Denver, Lowe, whose father was an Anglican priest and medical 
missionary, followed his presentation with an optional 15-minute talk 
about a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. According to the 
Colorado Springs Gazette Telegraph, about 10,000 of the 12,600 
seminar-goers stayed for the talk. Lowe asked his audience to join him 
in a prayer inviting Christ into their hearts, and asked those who had 
prayed with him to go to the back of the room to get a free book and 
tape. More than 6,000 did, the Gazette Telegraph reported. Lowe, who 
charged $79 a person for a seminar in Toronto, limits his income to 
$128,000 a year and donates heavily to charity, the paper said. 

The president of Christian Children's Fund, Paul McCleary, announced 
his retirement after months of controversy over accounting and 
management policies. McCleary said his retirement is not related to 
recent criticism by Thomas Naylor, who was voted off the CCF board in 
March. Naylor alleged the charity exaggerates the amount of money it 
spends on needy children and does not keep accurate records on how 
money is spent. Naylor also called CCF's board a team of cheerleaders 
who meet quarterly.  CCF denied Naylor's contentions. The 56-year-old 
charity, based in Richmond, Va., supports development projects in 38 
countries. Its 387,000 donors pay a monthly fee to sponsor an 
individual child where a project is located. The controversy has not 
hurt donations, according to Graham Spanier, CCF board chairman. 

The United Methodist Church's finance agency and its chief executive 
officer, Clifford Droke, have been sued for $500,000 by the agency's 
former general counsel. Craig Hoskins, 42, said he was fired after 
objecting to what he called Droke's heavy drinking and inappropriate 
conduct toward female employees. Hoskins said three women complained to 
him about Droke, who is a minister, United Methodist News Service 
reported. Hoskins' suit asks for back pay and monetary compensation. He 
also wants his job back. Droke's lawyer has not yet answered the 
charges. 
...A former employee of the United Methodist Reporter is suing the 
newspaper for $128 million, UMNS reported. Richard Jenkins, III, said 
co-worker Ron Thomas sexually assaulted him during a business trip. 
Thomas denied the charge. 
...The senior pastor of the third largest United Methodist church in 
the United States has been charged with sexual harassment. Barry 
Bailey, pastor of First United Methodist Church, in Fort Worth, Texas, 
is the subject of a complaint filed by youth director Cassie Allbaugh, 
UMNS reported. The suit was filed with the Texas Commission on Human 
Rights. 

Allegations are flying in a case that pits a group of former employees 
against The Christian Research Institute, based in Irvine, Calif., and 
its president since 1989, Hendrik  Hank Hanegraaff, 44. He hosts The 
Bible Answer Man, CRI's radio talk show, whose main topic is cults. 
...When employees questioned policies and practices that Hanegraaff 
introduced, they found themselves without jobs soon afterward, the 
exstaffers say. Their main criticism centers on a for-profit business, 
Memory Dynamics, Inc., and its Personal Witness Training program, which 
Hanegraaff and his wife operate. The ex-employees allege that employees 
and resources of CRI, whose 1993 revenue was $5 million, were used to 
benefit MDI. They also say that in 1992 CRI dropped its membership in 
the Evangelical Council on Financial Accountability to avoid rules that 
would not have allowed such a close relationship between CRI and MDI. 
...CRI officials acknowledge that the staff layoffs embittered some 
people, but blame most cutbacks on a downturn in finances and 
insufficient work. CRI attorney Sealy Yates said the ministry's board 
approved the working relationship with MDI, and that CRI gained 
significant income from selling MDI materials and Hanegraaff's 
controversial 1993 book, Christianity In Crisis (Harvest House). 
Nevertheless, guidelines were drawn up recently to create more distance 
between CRI and MDI and to avoid appearance of questionable doings, he 
said. 
...Brad Sparks, 38, sued CRI after his layoff last March. He contends 
his dismissal violated California's whistleblowers' law, noting that he 
had raised questions about possible conflict of interest between CRI 
and Hanegraaff's other business dealings. The CRI board issued a letter 
branding the allegations as false. Both sides have accused the other of 
violating scriptural guidelines regarding reconciliation. Yates said 
the ministry's finances have been harmed by the activities of Sparks 
and the other former staffers. CRI reportedly owes a number of radio 
stations thousands of dollars in past-due bills. 

Episcopal bishops sidestepped sexuality issues at last month's 
triennial General Convention. Among other things, conservative-backed 
proposals would have prohibited ordaining anyone who has sex outside of 
marriage, banned the blessing of same-sex unions, and declared sex 
outside of marriage to be against church law. Leaders of the 
2.5-million-member church, who met in Indianapolis, opted to consider 
the measures in a  more peaceful setting after further study and 
reflection. 
... I am appalled,  Bishop Peter Beckwith of Springfield, Ill., told 
his fellow bishops.  We have failed to deal with the one issue that is 
dividing this church.  Earlier, the bishops approved for study a 
document that upholds traditional teachings on sexual matters (NIRR 
9/5). Although most language that gay activists favored was stripped 
from the document, conservatives expressed concern that it did not 
explicitly prohibit ordination of homosexuals and the blessing of 
same-sex unions. 
...Liberals circulated a statement of their own, garnering the 
signatures of 52 active, retired, and assistant bishops. Among other 
things, the statement asserts that homosexuality and heterosexuality 
are  morally neutral,  that committed homosexual relationships  should 
be honored,  and that ordination is open to all baptized Christians. 
Bishop John Spong of Newark said he will continue to support, protect, 
and ordain homosexuals to ministry in the church. 

Original manuscripts of 500 of Charles Haddon Spurgeon's sermons will 
reside at Southwestern Baptist Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. The 
school will make two copies of the late British Baptist preacher's 
collection, one for itself, and the other for Spurgeon's College in 
London. Eventually, the originals will be sold, according to officials. 
The manuscripts were discovered about two years ago by a student 
cleaning out a storeroom at Spurgeon's College. Spurgeon principal 
Michael Quicke said Southwestern was chosen because its library and 
archives are  the best in the world among Baptist institutions. 

Lynne Boughton claims DePaul University, a Catholic school in Chicago, 
fired her because she is too Catholic. In a federal lawsuit, she said 
the school denied her an interview for a tenured teaching position 
because of her strict adherence to traditional Catholic beliefs. After 
she filed a charge of religious discrimination with the Illinois Human 
Rights Department, the lawsuit says, DePaul cut her course load and 
refused to renew her teaching contract. Boughton said she believes in 
the virgin birth, the resurrection of Christ, the inspiration of 
Scripture, a male-only priesthood, and the binding authority of the 
pope and bishops. But, she alleged, there was a pervasive atmosphere  
in the religious studies department that belittled the scholarliness of 
anyone adhering to such beliefs. 

Jerry Falwell will speak after all at the Arkansas Baptist Pastors' 
Conference next month. The conference originally was to have been held 
at Immanuel Baptist Church in Little Rock -- President Bill Clinton's 
home church. However, pastor Rex Horne told conference leaders that 
Falwell was not welcome to preach at Immanuel, Baptist news sources 
said. Horne said he was concerned about a video Falwell was promoting 
on his TV program. The officials canceled the speaking engagement, and 
Falwell reportedly said he understood. A number of pastors protested 
the decision, the meeting was moved to nearby First Baptist Church, and 
Falwell was re-invited. 
...Falwell's program, The Old Time Gospel Hour, has been carrying 
excerpts from a videotape that accuses Clinton of arranging for the 
murder of an Arkansas investigator, among other claims. On the program, 
Falwell calls Clinton  the most radical and controversial president in 
our nation's history.  He has been offering a copy of the tape to 
viewers for $43. 
...Several TV stations canceled the Lynchburg, Va., pastor's programs 
after protests about their political content. ACTS, the Southern 
Baptist cable TV network, declined a request to air the videotape, 
Associated Baptist Press reported. 

Pray for me,  President Clinton appealed to 60 religious leaders at a 
White House prayer breakfast Sept. 8. I'm doing the best I can, and 
some days that's not good enough,  he said. His audience included 
evangelicals, mainstream Protestants, and Catholics. He acknowledged 
that  a cultural war  is dividing the American people, but insisted 
that the  values we share are greater than the issues that divide, such 
as homosexuality and abortion. 
...Clinton urged religious people to stop screaming at each other, to 
study the Bible to find out what it teaches about the issues, and to 
try to find areas of agreement on which they can work together to 
change the country for the better, participants said. He indicated that 
although he subscribes to traditional family values, in a diverse 
society he must be a leader for all the people. For example, he said he 
is misrepresented often as believing homosexuality is equally desirable 
as heterosexuality.  I don't believe that,  he reportedly said. 
However, he added, as long as homosexuals are law-abiding citizens, his 
job is to treat them equally and see that others do the same. Citing an 
example of a positive approach to divisive issues, he told of an 
evangelical pastor from Michigan who, although he opposes 
homosexuality, started a ministry in his church for people with AIDS. 
...Clinton has met with groups of religious leaders every two or three 
months for the past year. In August, guests included noted church 
historian Martin Marty, Episcopal Presiding Bishop Edmund Browning, and 
Catholic philosopher Michael Novak. Clinton attends church weekly. 

The president went to New Orleans the day after the prayer breakfast to 
address the 114th annual meeting of the National Baptist Convention, 
USA, Inc. He called on his audience of thousands of black Baptists to 
help the nation arise from its  crisis of the spirit and crisis of 
values.  His solutions focused on how parents, communities, and 
churches can make a greater moral difference in the lives of children 
and young people. He also underscored the role of personal 
responsibility. He said that 40% of children born today are born out of 
wedlock, and that 27% of all pregnancies end in abortion.  I don't care 
what your position is, whether you're prochoice or anti-[abortion]: 
that's too many,  he declared.  You shouldn't have a baby when you're 
not married,  he said, calling it  wrong  and a  disaster.  His 
audience responded with applause and shouts of  amen. 
...Not so pleased was Jesse Jackson, the D.C.  shadow  senator. He told 
reporters that Clinton needs to focus on getting people jobs, not 
salvation. Jackson, who holds ministerial credentials in the 
Progressive National Baptist Convention, one of Clinton's potential 
rivals for the 1996 Democratic presidential nomination. 
...Clinton's speech echoed one by Republican and former Vice President 
Dan Quayle in San Francisco less than 24 hours earlier.  The single 
most important root cause of crime, Quayle said, is  the poverty of 
values.  Americans must address that issue, he said. In interviews 
afterward, both Clinton and Quayle paid tribute to each other for 
speaking out on the crisis in morality. 

A politically active pastor from Florida was elected president of the 
National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. Henry Lyons, 52, pastor of 
Bethel Metropolitan Baptist Church in St. Petersburg and an NBCUSA vice 
president, received 3,545 votes in a five-man race during the 
convention in New Orleans. Lyons, who headed Jesse Jackson's 1984 and 
1988 presidential campaigns in Florida, said he will concentrate on 
improving the denomination's organizational structure, paying off its 
debt, and steering the NBCUSA into greater social and political 
involvement. 
...Observers warned that storms may lie ahead. The NBCUSA historically 
has had conservative-minded leadership, and more than 6,000 votes at 
New Orleans went to candidates other than Lyons. In 1961, Martin Luther 
King, Jr. and some other civil rights leaders left the denomination to 
help form the Progressive National Baptist Convention after their 
candidate lost a bid for the NBCUSA presidency in a meeting marked by 
violence. Lyons indicated he will work at restoring ties to that 
faction. 

A hastily called prayer meeting in the rest room of Sen. John 
Danforth's office helped to rescue the nomination of Supreme Court 
Justice Clarence Thomas, according to published excerpts from a 
forthcoming book by Danforth. 
...The Missouri Republican, an ordained Episcopal priest, noted that 
Thomas had been reduced to tears over the state of his confirmation 
hearing, which probed allegations by Anita Hill. Just before Thomas 
made his final defense, he and his wife, Ginni, joined Danforth and his 
wife, Sally, for prayer in the privacy of the office rest room, 
Danforth wrote. After the prayer, the book says Danforth played a 
recording of Onward, Christian Soldiers on an office tape machine. 
Afterward, Thomas marched to the hearing room and delivered a forceful 
statement that rescued his nomination, the senator said. 
... Clarence has risen. Hallelujah, Danforth wrote in a note to himself 
at the time. Danforth, who is retiring from the Senate, hired Thomas as 
a recent graduate from Yale Law School to work for him when he was 
attorney general of Missouri. His book, Resurrection: The Confirmation 
of Clarence Thomas, (Viking) is due out next month.

Christians in Cuba are facing the economic and social crises there 
without anxiety, recent visitors to the island said. David and Margaret 
Fite watched Cubans put all the food they had on the table, not knowing 
where the next meal was coming from, but believing they are completely 
in the hands of the Lord, Baptist Press reported. The Fites, who were 
missionaries to Cuba from 1960 to 1969, were pleased to see the  result 
of the seeds we had sown there.  David Fite also taught at the Baptist 
seminary in Havana and had been jailed for four years as a political 
prisoner. The fact that churches are packed, Christians are faithful 
and enthusiastic, and the gospel is dramatically changing people's 
lives is  confirmation that God's work continues,  he said. 
...Much of the revival sweeping Cuba (NIRR 2/21) is taking place in 
illegal house churches. Thousands of believers meet regularly in homes 
or fields, informed sources say. Often, denominational congregations 
assist the fledgling groups of believers. Denominational churches must 
function carefully under Fidel Castro's socialist regime. Four 
prominent denominational leaders were arrested this summer, and two 
still are being detained, NIRR's sources, who requested anonymity, 
said. 
...Revival is being stirred by the acute shortage of food and by social 
disintegration, the same factors that are making Castro's grip on power 
increasingly precarious, observers say. The paranoia of political 
leaders and block captains  -- government monitors who report 
suspicious activities in their neighborhoods -- is increasing. They 
fear that foreign religious groups will destabilize Cuba. While foreign 
contributions to individual Cuban churches generally are welcome, 
proselytizing by foreign denominations and parachurch groups is 
forbidden. Dale Kietzman, chairman of the California-based Aid to 
Special Saints In Strategic Times, said he discovered on a trip to Cuba 
this summer that American evangelicals and their parachurch ministries 
are no longer welcome in Cuba. Large evangelistic organizations, 
including Billy Graham's, also have been forbidden to hold crusades in 
Cuba, and the pope has been denied a visit to the island. 
...Among religious groups shipping humanitarian aid to Cuba are Church 
World Service, the relief and development arm of the National Council 
of Churches. The NCC received permission to send $750,000 worth of 
food, medicine, hygiene items, and clothing to hospitals, nursing 
homes, and orphanages. Blessings International, based in Tulsa, Okla., 
will ship $1.25 million worth of medicines, as well as food and other 
relief items, to Havana this week on its Spirit Ship, a spokesman said. 
The ship will then sail to Haiti with more relief supplies. 

Missionaries are being forced to decide who lives and dies as they 
dispense food and medicine in Haiti. They come in, start to tell the 
story, and break down in tears,  Charles Gardner told NIRR. He is 
executive director of Sarasota, Fla.-based Agape Flights, a 
nondenominational missions support agency. Missionaries say their 
facilities are being surrounded by starving people, and they must 
decide who eats and who doesn't, he said. One missionary described how 
a child who was refused aid was found the next morning lying dead in 
the clinic. Think of the strength the Lord is providing as they make 
these decisions. Could you sleep tonight? Gardner asked. Unlike 
situations in which aid recipients are anonymous, Haitians begging to 
live may be people the missionaries know -- members of their 
congregation or parents of children who attended their schools. 
...Some missionaries who left Haiti when the embargo was imposed in May 
have returned, and some flights have resumed. But the aid they can 
deliver is  just a drop in the bucket,  Gardner said.  I could fly my 
planes there every day and I can't solve those problems.  Agape Flights 
and Missionary Flights International of West Palm Beach, Fla., have 
been allowed to transport missionaries, medicine, mail, and educational 
materials three to four times a week. The red tape necessary to gain 
approval for the flights is long, according to Richard Snook of 
Missionary Flights International. Flights must by approved by the 
United States, the United Nations, and Haiti. 
...World Relief, the international assistance arm of the National 
Association of Evangelicals, has become the lead humanitarian agency 
assisting Haitians taken to Guantanamo Bay Naval Station in Cuba. 
Several agencies are working with WR to provide counseling for the many 
who feel isolated and abandoned. Literacy and job-training programs, 
and help with tracing relatives are provided. Aid workers also identify 
women and children in need of special attention, and provide social 
services. Some health education and medical assistance also is given, 
World Relief said. 

A taboo was broken in Haiti last week when Jean-Marie Vincent was 
gunned down by unknown assailants in Port-au-Prince. The Catholic 
priest was the first Haitian cleric in memory to be murdered, news 
reports said. Minutes after the murder, an ambulance and car full of 
police appeared and removed the body. 
...Vincent championed the rights of Haiti's rural poor. He helped 
establish literacy programs, labor unions, and the sharing of seeds and 
harvests among sharecroppers. The farmers live under the same kind of 
system their ancestors endured during French and Spanish colonial rule. 
In the past, priests such as Vincent who challenged repressive regimes 
had been beaten or jailed, but not killed. Now Haitian clerics 
reportedly are afraid for their lives. 

Christian broadcasts are aired in 169 of the world's 360  
mega-languages,  and have the potential of reaching 78% of the world's 
people, according to World By 2000. The group, based in Victoria, 
Australia, is a project launched in 1985 by Far East Broadcasting, HCJB 
World Radio, SIM International, and Trans World Radio. The goal is to 
provide gospel programs by the year 2000 for every language in the 
world that has a million or more speakers. 

"The biggest pajama party in the world  drew 25,000 Australians who 
camped out in 40-degree weather to raise awareness of the plight of the 
homeless. The annual National Winter Sleepout raised more than $500,000 
for the nondenominational City Missions. The event was organized by 
schools, churches, and clubs in 500 locations around the country. The 
sleepout outside the Sydney Opera House, which drew 4,000 people, 
included music by some of Australia's top bands. A group of homeless 
youth, who were trained in music at the Sydney City Mission, performed 
songs from their compact disc, Kenneth Harrison of the Sydney City 
Mission told NIRR. 

Doctors ignore the inner-city poor, said a physician who has practiced 
what he calls  poverty medicine  for 11 years. Those who grew up with 
education and opportunities had not so much deserved our affluence as 
inherited it,  according to Dr. David Hilfiker. Not All of Us Are 
Saints is his book about leaving his medical practice in rural 
Minnesota in 1983 and moving with his wife and three children to 
inner-city Washington. Hilfiker is one of eight physicians at Community 
of Hope, a clinic operated by a Nazarene Church. The family lives on 
the top floor of Christ House, a medical recovery shelter for homeless 
men. In the book, he notes that Washington's 3,100 psychiatrists 
volunteered only 17 hours to the city's homeless and mentally ill, 
Newsweek said. 

"Intentional communities  in the inner city are difficult, but 
rewarding, groups of idealistic young Christians are finding. Five such 
communities have sprung up around Seattle's poor and racially diverse 
neighborhoods. The groups are sponsored by University Presbyterian 
Church, where the congregation is mostly white and middle class. The 
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A) also hopes to open seven new sites in 
Florida, California, Alaska, Great Britain, Argentina, and the 
Philippines this year. 
...Each community is a rented house occupied by five to seven men and 
women in their mid- to late-20s who commit themselves to live in the 
neighborhoods for a year or more, The Seattle Times said. The goal of 
the communities is to learn about urban life, said J.D. Ward, director 
of Urban Ministries for the denomination. Participants pay their own 
rent and expenses, and most work at regular jobs or go to school. They 
volunteer 7-10 hours a week at a church or ministry in their 
neighborhood. In their spare time, they develop friendships, learn, 
baby-sit, tutor, visit the elderly, or organize a block watch. 

Fired NAACP leader Benjamin Chavis, Jr., affirmed his solidarity with 
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan at a Sunday service of the 
breakaway African-American Catholic Church in Washington, D.C., news 
reports said. A United Church of Christ minister, Chavis told 1,000 
cheering congregants at Capitol Hill Imani Temple:  You can take away 
my job, you can take away anything, but I am not going to forsake Mr. 
Farrakhan as my brother.  His alliance with Farrakhan, a critic of Jews 
and other whites, figured in his recent dismissal from his job as the 
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's executive 
director. 

It is ethically permissible for doctors to harvest organs from live 
anencephalic infants -- babies with portions of their brain missing. So 
says the American Medical Association's nine-member Council on Ethical 
and Judicial Affairs. The council recommended that a baby be considered 
a potential organ donor if the diagnosis of anencephaly is confirmed by 
two doctors not part of the transplant team and if the parents agree in 
writing to the transplant. 
...John Glasson, chairman of the CEJA, was quoted in news reports as 
saying an anencephalic child  might be construed to have some rights, 
but they are unimportant as compared with the importance of making 
their organs available. 
...Anencephalic infants have no potential to experience consciousness, 
and die within a week of birth, the AMA's Anna Girard said. 
Approximately 30%-50% of the children under 2 years of age who need a 
transplant will die waiting for one, she told NIRR. The proposal, which 
is not yet official AMA policy, is  clearly illegal  in every state, 
Girard said. 
...Transplanting organs from a live donor is a radical departure from 
ethical standards dealing with handicapped newborns, some bioethicists 
said. It opens a Pandora's box for other individuals -- including those 
in a coma or persistent vegetative state, the retarded, and the senile 
-- to be used for transplants, critics warned. 

Tens of thousands of executed prisoners are the source of organ 
transplants in China, a human rights group said. Donors sometimes still 
are alive when their organs are removed, Human Rights Watch-Asia said. 
Executions are scheduled according to transplant needs. The consent of 
prisoners rarely is sought or is coerced in the last few hours before 
death, the group's report said. In some cases, kidneys were removed 
from prisoners the night before their executions. Some executions are 
deliberately botched to keep the bodies alive longer and improve 
chances of organ transplant success, HRWA said. 

A young widow's desire to have her husband's baby is conflicting with 
the teaching of her church. On May 21 of last year, Manny Maresca, 22, 
became the first person in history to donate sperm posthumously, 
according to the National Catholic Reporter. After a car accident that 
took his life, Maresca's parents and widow decided to allow sperm to be 
taken from his body to later impregnate his wife, Pam, 22. The sperm 
was frozen in an Orlando cryonics bank. 
...The Marescas, said to be devoted Catholics for generations, are 
adamant about having the Church's blessing for their plan. The Church 
sanctions only procreation that results from the natural union of two 
parents. Because Pam reportedly was taking birth control pills at the 
time of her husband's death, it will take several months before she 
becomes a good candidate for pregnancy through artificial insemination, 
NCR said. With the sample available, Pam has a 30% chance of becoming 
pregnant. 

Killing abortion doctors could be defended in court as justifiable 
homicide, according to an article in Regent University Law Review. 
However, the 500 copies of the student-run journal were not circulated, 
and a replacement edition will be published without the article, Regent 
officials told The Washington Post. They said the article was withdrawn 
at the request of its author, Michael Hirsh, a recent graduate. It was 
written before the July killing of a doctor at a Pensacola, Fla., 
clinic, allegedly by ex-Presbyterian minister Paul Hill (NIRR 8/8), 
they said. The article focuses on antiabortion activist Michael 
Griffin, convicted of the 1993 murder of abortion doctor David Gunn at 
a different Pensacola clinic (NIRR 3/22/93). Regent officials denounced 
the clinic killings, but defended Hirsh's right to publish the article. 

California legislators approved a proposal to create the nation's first 
statewide registry for domestic partners. It would extend limited 
benefits to people, including homosexual couples, who live together. 

Black and white Americans report different reasons for deciding to 
divorce, according to a study by Ohio State University psychologist 
Andrew Schwebel and Vanessa Moore of the Veterans Administration 
Medical Center in Washington, D.C. Extramarital affairs, physical 
abuse, and the need for personal growth and freedom were more often 
cited by black couples than by white couples. Whites cited family 
issues such as child care, child rearing, and poor communications as 
their biggest problems. 
...U.S. divorce rates are 7.9 per 1,000 people for whites and 10.2 per 
1,000 people for blacks, government figures show. The findings were 
published recently in the Journal of Divorce and Remarriage. 

The Vermont Supreme Court ordered a member of a communal church to pay 
child support to his exwife even though the church's doctrine prohibits 
such payments and the man has no income. Eugene Hunt has been a member 
of the Community at Island Pond for 14 years. His wife left the church 
in 1989, and they divorced a year later, according to court papers. 
Hunt contended that neither he nor the church recognizes his wife's 
decision to leave him, and so he cannot support her outside the church 
community. The court found that Hunt's obligation to care for his 
children outweighs his freedom of religion. 

Walt Disney's reputation as a producer of wholesome family 
entertainment may be blemished further by the company's latest foray 
into adult film making, according to Focus on the Family's Family 
Issues Alert. Hollywood Pictures and Touchstone, both Disney 
subsidiaries, are releasing Color of Night, which contains nudity, a 
publication editor said. Producer Richard Rush was quoted as saying the 
home-video version of the movie will include sex scenes cut from the 
theater version. Purchasing Disney children's books and videos or 
attending Disney theme parks helps  subsidize the dark side of the 
Disney empire,  the publication said. 

Evangelicals are dwindling in number, pollster George Barna said. Only 
7% of American adults hold evangelical beliefs and commitments, 
compared with 9% last year and 12% in 1992. People who once held 
orthodox Christian views have embraced a much broader set of beliefs, 
he said. There is a big trend toward a diverse and inclusive 
spirituality.  For example, one of the eight standards Barna used to 
categorize respondents as evangelical is belief in an error-free Bible. 
Those who strongly agree that the Bible is totally accurate in its 
teaching dropped from 47% three years ago to 38% this year, he said. 
...Barna's latest study, reported in his Virtual America (Regal Books), 
divides the population into non-Christian (65%) and born-again 
Christian (35%) classifications. The latter, down from 40% in 1992, is 
composed of people who say they have an ongoing, personal commitment to 
Christ that is still important today, and they believe they are going 
to heaven because they have confessed their sins and accepted Jesus as 
their Savior. 
...Evangelicals are a sub-category within the born-again group. They 
also must agree on:  the importance of religion in life,  whether 
salvation depends on doing good works,  the omnipotence of God,  
Satan's existence as a real being,  whether Christians have a personal 
mandate to witness to others. 

Following intense debate, bishops of the Episcopal Church approved a 
softened version of a controversial document on sexuality. Meeting in 
Indianapolis for the 2.5-million-member church's 71st General 
Convention, the House of Bishops downgraded the statement from a 
pastoral  teaching to a  study  document (by a vote of 88 to 81), 
removed language that homosexuals had favored, and attached for study a 
conservative-oriented affirmation that was critical of the draft 
version of the sexuality statement. The affirmation, drawn up by 18 
bishops in several Midwest and Southwest states and signed by a total 
of 101 bishops, reasserts the church's traditional teachings on 
chastity and marriage. It also declares that premarital or homosexual 
relations cannot be condoned by the church (NIRR 8/8). 
...Conservatives failed, however, to strip the controversial section, 
Guidelines While We Continue the Dialogue,  from the proposed document. 
Critics said the guidelines were vague and might permit individual 
bishops to bless same-sex unions or to ordain non-celibate homosexuals. 
But the document's enabling resolution confirmed a 1979 General 
Convention resolution opposing ordination of practicing homosexuals. In 
the end, several leaders of the conservative wing said the document had 
been changed sufficiently to warrant their vote. For priest Todd 
Wetzel, president of the activist, evangelical group Episcopalians 
United, the amended statement is  a sign of hope that the church is 
returning to a centrist position on sexuality. 

Another celebrity conversion: Alice Cooper, who reveled in his image as 
one of the most decadent rock stars of the '70s and once claimed to be 
an incarnated witch, has changed his tune. Cooper, a preacher's son 
whose birth name is Vincent Furier, now plays golf with singer Glen 
Campbell and theologian R.C. Sproul and has taught a Sunday school 
class, according to World magazine. Cooper still is under contract with 
Epic records and wears scary makeup, but the lyrics to his songs belie 
that image:  What about truth/what about life/what about glory/what 
about Christ/what about peace/what about faith in God above, Cooper 
wrote. 

Leading Jewish conservatives signed an ad in the New York Times last 
month defending Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition political action 
group from attacks by the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish 
organization. The ad castigated the ADL for a study in which it labeled 
the religious right a  threat to pluralism and tolerance in America.  
It described the Christian Coalition as one of Israel's and the Jewish 
community's best friends. The 75 signers included Irving Kristol, 
Herbert Zweibon, and Midge Decter, who co-authored the text with Rabbi 
Daniel Lapin. Lapin, an Orthodox rabbi, heads Toward Tradition, a 
suburban Seattle-based group. 

Congress voted to forbid the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
from enforcing its proposed guidelines on religious harassment in the 
workplace. The Senate voted 8810, and the House 322-98, to require the 
EEOC to remove religion as a category in its guidelines on harassment. 
The measure specifies that any new EEOC regulations must not restrict 
the portrayal of religious symbols or expressions of belief. It also 
requires the EEOC to hold public hearings on any new guidelines related 
to religious harassment, and also to receive additional comment before 
issuing any new regulations. 

Where to face during prayer has become a troublesome issue for Muslims 
in North America. The world's 1 billion Muslims pray five times each 
day by turning toward Mecca, Saudi Arabia -- site of the Ka'ba, Islam's 
holiest shrine. But among the 4.5 million Muslims in the United States 
and Canada, there is a question over which is the proper direction to 
turn, according to Knight-Ridder Newspapers. Some favor turning 
southeast, the straightest route on a flat map. Many more favor the 
northeast, the shortest route on the globe. 
...The issue is not a petty one to Muslims. Determination of Qiblah, or 
the proper direction to the Ka'ba, is required to establish everything 
from the placement of mosques to the burial positions of Muslim dead. 
The question has divided Muslims  in very sinister ways,  Mahmoud 
Ayoub, professor of Islamic Studies at Temple University, said. 

Fighting, violence, and gangs are the biggest problems confronting 
America's public schools, a Gallup poll of adults found. Overall, 18% 
of respondents gave top billing equally to those categories, as well as 
lack of discipline. Among nonwhites, 31% rated violence as the worst 
problem. Ranked next were insufficient financial support for schools, 
drug abuse, and low standards or quality of education. Among suggested 
solutions, 86% called for stronger penalties against student possession 
of weapons. Other solutions: training for school staffs, more 
vocational or job training, drugand-alcohol abuse programs, values and 
ethnic education, and education to reduce racial and ethnic tensions. 
About two-thirds of respondents had no children in public schools, 30% 
did, and 6% had children in religious or private schools. 

California lawmakers reversed themselves and voted to approve a measure 
that would allow students to carry knives in public schools for 
religious purposes. The bill was prompted by a Livingstone High 
School's ban of Sikh students who carry ceremonial daggers, which are 
said to be an integral part of their religion (NIRR 5/2). The case has 
been in the courts, with the American Civil Liberties Union backing the 
Sikhs. 

A Georgia teacher was suspended on opening day of classes at South 
Gwinnett High School in Snellville for refusing to obey a new state law 
requiring a moment of silence. American government teacher Brian Bown 
said he could not  follow a law that is patently unconstitutional.  
Instead, he led his class in a discussion of the new law, according to 
news accounts. The law's language specifically says the observance, 
limited to no more than 60 seconds,  is not intended to be, and shall 
not be conducted as, a religious service or exercise.  However, critics 
contend it is a veiled attempt to bypass court rulings against 
state-ordered prayer. School Superintendent George Thompson recommended 
that Bown be fired.  American government teachers don't pick and choose 
in front of students what laws they're going to follow,  he said. 
...Bown sued in federal court to seek reinstatement and to have the law 
declared unconstitutional, but U.S. District Judge Frank Hull rejected 
the bid. School attorneys argued that Bown was not required to 
implement or enforce the law, but could have left the room for the 
40-second period observed by his school. Instead, they said, he 
disrupted the class, which is why he was suspended. Bown contended that 
the intent of the law is prayer.  In my classroom that morning when 
class began, there were Bibles out on desks,  he said. 

Molly Marshall was forced to resign her position as associate professor 
of theology at Southern Baptist Seminary in Louisville, Ky. Marshall 
was accused repeatedly of deviating from the school's positions on such 
issues as atonement, universalism, God, and the Bible. Each time, 
inquiry panels cleared her. Panel members, including conservatives, 
often established that she had been misquoted and falsely charged. In a 
letter to seminary president Albert Mohler, she affirmed her belief in 
Christ's atonement, the necessity to turn to Christ alone for 
salvation, a hereafter of life eternal or punishment depending on one's 
relationship with Christ, and the other doctrines in the school's 
guidelines. She said she was  worn out by the years of pressure  and  
unfair representations  of her views, Baptist news services said. 
...Faculty members voted overwhelming to call for changes in the 
seminary's disciplinary policies for teachers. Faculty expressed  
affirmation and support  for Marshall. The school's Student Government 
Association called for  full and public disclosure  of all the aspects 
surrounding Marshall's departure. Mohler denied that gender had 
anything to do with his action.  Even though I believe the New 
Testament excludes women from teaching authority and the pastorate in 
the church, this does not mean women should not teach on the faculty of 
the seminary or even in the school of theology,  he said. 

The General Association of Baptists in Kentucky, a black group, voted 
to oust several member churches because they have licensed women to 
preach, a violation of association rules. Men were the only voters at 
the meeting. Women in the association's congregations do not have the 
right to vote on business decisions. 

Seminaries aren't producing the types of pastors that churches need, a 
study sponsored by the M.J. Murdock Charitable Trust of Vancouver, 
Wash., found. The trust actively supports theological education in the 
Pacific Northwest. Often, church leaders feel that seminaries are out 
of touch with the realities of the parish, while seminary professors 
suspect an anti-intellectual bias exists in the pews, the study found. 
Also, churches often send spiritually motivated students to study for 
the ministry, only to see piety take a back seat to intellectual 
pursuits at the seminaries. 
...Seminaries are producing more specialists, and churches need 
generalpractitioner pastors. In some ways, new pastors are no better 
prepared to face modern-day parish challenges than they were decades 
ago, the study concluded. Kenneth Meyer, president of Trinity 
Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Ill., acknowledged that his 
school had altered only two courses between 1975 and 1990, according to 
a Religious News Service report on the study. 
...Among recommendations in the study: Seminaries need to do a better 
job of screening because some students are emotionally unfit for the 
ministry. As the percentage of women in seminaries grows, churches 
should take steps to include female seminary graduates in their 
programs. The curriculum also should  include more internships and 
training in basic leadership and management skills. 
...Seminaries are top-heavy administratively; they should reorganize to 
cut overhead costs and become less dependent on tuition revenues, and 
offer more internships, personalized instruction, and field 
supervision. Also, schools should place major emphasis on spiritual 
formation. 

A diverse coalition of 67 groups that pushed for passage of the 
Religious Freedom Restoration Act last year (NIRR 11/15/93) is working 
to defend it in the courts. New York officials are challenging RFRA in 
six cases, arguing that Congress lacks the authority to restrict powers 
reserved to the states. 
...RFRA requires any government body, before limiting the free exercise 
of religion, to demonstrate that its action serves a  compelling 
interest and is the  least restrictive means  to do so. Briefs have 
been or will be filed by the 67-member coalition. They were prepared by 
Marc Stern of the American Jewish Congress, with assistance from 
attorneys with the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs, the 
National Council of Churches, the Christian Legal Society, People for 
the American Way, the Home School Legal Defense Association, and the 
Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, according to a 
Baptist Press report. 

Equal access to state-owned facilities will be given to religious 
speakers, according to a consent order signed by a federal judge in 
Albany, N.Y. The order sanctions a voluntary agreement between New York 
state and Albany minister Peter Whitehouse (NIRR 7/11), director of 
missions and evangelism for Our Savior Lutheran Church. Whitehouse 
wanted to use a state-owned park for an evangelistic outreach. New York 
attempted to stop him, claiming that preaching on stateowned land 
violated the separation of church and state. But Whitehouse, backed by 
the American Center for Law and Justice, charged that his civil rights 
were being violated. In June, he obtained a temporary restraining order 
permitting the outreach, which took place as planned. 

"You changed my life tonight, the 18-year-old told evangelist Dave 
Roever.  I've been mocked all my life because I don't have hands,  the 
young man said, holding up his arms and revealing only stumps.  But you 
don't have a face. If you can be happy, I'll never let anyone steal my 
joy again.  The remark was made by one of more than 2,000 young people 
who accepted Christ during meetings in Australia led by the Fort Worth, 
Texas, evangelist. 
...Roever, a Vietnam veteran who was badly scarred by a hand grenade 
explosion in the war, found audiences open to the gospel. Most who 
attended the meetings had never heard of a relationship with Christ. 
Once youth come to salvation in Australia, they quickly form Bible 
clubs and support networks that make unsaved youth feel like they're 
missing out, he said. A 40-minute documentary of Roever's story, Scars 
That Heal, was released by World Wide Pictures last fall, and his 
appearances generated considerable media attention. 

Regular healing services alternate among denominations in rural 
Bucyrus, a community of 13,000 in north central Ohio. Presbyterian, 
Assemblies of God, Lutheran, Baptist, Episcopalian, Nazarene, and 
Methodist congregations sponsor the services. Many people have been 
healed at the services, which began three years ago, Ken Damon, pastor 
of First Baptist Church, told NIRR. 
...Congregations also cooperate to quench thirsts at the annual 
Bratwurst Festival. Volunteers from four of the congregations shared 
the job of staffing a free-water booth at the three-day event. Some of 
the 4,000 passersby who accepted the water expressed surprise that 
Baptists and Pentecostals could work together on anything, Damon said. 
Others remarked that the cooperation showed the church  being visible 
and giving rather than withdrawn and taking. Thousands of free 
brochures on marriage and family life also were given out, and a 
religious cantata was presented during the fair. 

A free community seminar to encourage Bible study drew a big response 
with its promises not to attempt to convert people or ask for money. 
According to IdeaSource, a newsletter,  Learning to Read the Bible 
Effectively  drew 105 registrants for a six-session seminar at a 
congregation in North Industry, Ohio. A second set of sessions was 
planned in order to accommodate the overflow and additional applicants. 
...The seminar was advertised by a brochure mailed to 10,000 homes. It 
spelled out what participants would learn. Sessions were led by two 
laypeople and held in a community center. The focus was on removing 
obstacles that make reading Scripture difficult, rather than on 
doctrine, the publication said. 

Some 1,700  Methacostals  met in Washington, D.C., in August for 
Aldersgate `94. The 16th National Conference on the Holy Spirit was 
sponsored by United Methodist Renewal Services Fellowship. Events 
included preaching, workshops, prayer in small groups, and 
praise-and-worship, which included dancers. The United Methodist 
fellowship is committed to renewal of the church by the Holy Spirit, 
and says it is  not an adversary caucus. 

"God is truly doing a mighty harvesting,  evangelist Peter Pretorius 
said after more than half a million people became believers during two 
crusades in Zaire. Pretorius said 564,520 responded to calls for 
salvation over the five days of meetings held in Mbuji-Mayi and 
Kananga. Attendance was nearly 1.5 million, Pretorius told Life 
Outreach International, a Euless, Texas, group that helps support his 
missionary efforts. 
...Some 95% of the people in the central African nation are Christian, 
but many nominally so, according to Patrick Johnstone's Operation 
World. Many no longer attend church. 

Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of a Nobel peace prize for his fight 
against the old South Africa, rebuked the country's new rulers for 
self-indulgent extravagance.  They stopped the gravy train only long 
enough to get on,  he told a Johannesburg audience. Stung by the 
criticism, President Nelson Mandela announced he would rein in runaway 
salaries and spending. News stories noted, for example, that staff 
members of the African National Congress elected to Parliament in the 
first all-race elections in April now enjoy annual salaries of $44,725, 
up from $9,000 when they were with the ANC. Newspapers have reported 
spending binges by government officials for silverware and cutlery, 
limousines, luxury hotels, and international travel. Tutu also 
denounced the continuing international arms trade. 

A Swedish nurse serving a shortterm stint in Somalia for a Christian 
relief group, International Aid Sweden (IAS), was kidnapped from a 
school in Mogadishu and held for more than two weeks last month. Lena 
Thelander, 28, said she was held in solitary confinement in two houses 
and allowed only to read her Bible and a book on African history her 
captors gave her. She had only bread and papaya to eat. The kidnappers 
released her after IAS refused to pay a ransom and local clan leaders 
intervened. After her release, Thelander flew to Nairobi and spoke with 
reporters. She said Somalia remains in a state of anarchy with a 
growing insecurity and fear among aid workers there. 

Helicopters flew teams of young evangelists from Europe and the United 
States into remote villages in Albania to show the Jesus film this 
summer. Student missionaries operated out of two base camps. Groups of 
six or seven volunteers were flown unannounced to the outskirts of the 
villages in the helicopters, which were provided by Helimission, a 
Swiss organization. There they unloaded equipment, walked to the 
villages, and asked permission of the mayor to show the film for four 
nights. The teams returned to the base camps, but later were airlifted 
back into the villages that had been most receptive to the gospel. 
There they spent two days discipling village leaders and starting Bible 
studies and churches. More than 15,000 people in 175 villages watched 
the movie, and more than 2,300 became believers, according to Baptist 
Press.  A week before, these people had never heard about Jesus, and 
now they were gathered for a service, Campus Crusade volunteer Matt 
Harmon of Ohio University said. 
...One student team saved the life of an infant and mother, who had 
delivered the child during the night. Both were gravely ill. Workers 
radioed a helicopter, which ferried the mother, baby, and father to 
Tirana. There, two Campus Crusade workers took them to the hospital and 
remained to comfort the father. An attending physician said the mother 
and baby would have died within hours without medical aid. The next 
day, the baby's father found his way to the base camp, where he asked 
the workers to name the baby. 

Young people from Eastern Europe brought  an amazing dimension of faith 
and commitment  to an International Youth Conference in Hamburg, 
Germany, organizers said. It was the first time in 40 years that young 
people from the former Eastern Bloc attended the conference, which is 
sponsored by the World Methodist Council. Some 750 young adults from 48 
countries gathered at the conference. Speakers came from South Africa, 
Kenya, Brazil, and Australia. 

Catholicos Vasken I, 85, patriarch of the Armenian Apostolic Church and 
an Orthodox leader of the ecumenical movement, died last month in 
Yerevan, Armenia. He was spiritual leader of Armenians around the world 
since 1955. Christianity was declared Armenia's state religion in 301. 
The mother church outside Yerevan was built in 303. 

Germany's two main denominations attacked the welfare policies of 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats, alleging they had divided 
society into winners and losers.  Society shares responsibility for the 
living conditions of its worst-off,  a joint study of the Catholic and 
mainline Protestant churches said. The statement was published two days 
after Kohl said in a broadcast interview that he wanted cuts in 
unemployment and other benefits after October's elections to ensure 
that jobless people don't end up making higher incomes than 
wage-earners. 

Vandals defaced the Catholic cathedral in Szczecin, Poland, with 
swastikas and anti-German slogans hours before the church's first 
German-language Mass since 1945, a Polish news agency reported.  
Germans Go Home  was one of the slogans painted on walls and doors. A 
priest from Germany celebrated the Mass, which Polish Catholic leaders 
will allow to be held monthly in the cathedral as part of 
reconciliation efforts between the two countries. 
...The city was part of Germany and called Stettin until the end of 
World War II. It was given to Poland in exchange for eastern 
territories lost to the Soviet Union. Most of the city's Germans fled 
West. The Baltic seaport city was resettled by Poles and renamed 
Szczecin. After Germany's 1990 unification, its government signed a 
treaty recognizing the border with Poland. In return, Poland agreed to 
recognize the rights of 200,000 Germans in Poland by providing for 
creation of Germanlanguage schools, cultural facilities, and church 
services. 

Russia wants to be included in ongoing talks with Israeli and 
Palestinian leaders about the final status of Jerusalem, special envoy 
Victor Posuvaliuk announced. As grounds, he cited Russia's large 
Orthodox Christian community -- the world's largest -- and its sizable 
Muslim population, as well as  historically rich traditions and ties 
with the Holy Land.  Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinians have been 
wrangling over control of Jerusalem's holy sites. Russia's involvement 
ostensibly would give the Orthodox Church a say in those deliberations, 
observers noted. The Russian diplomat said his country has been holding 
high-level talks in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan. Israeli Deputy Foreign 
Minister Yossi Beilin told reporters he welcomed any contribution 
Russia might make in accelerating the peace process. 
...Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, however, rejected the envoy's bid to 
be part of talks on the future of Jerusalem. The city's status, he 
said, is not open to  international discussion. Palestinian leaders 
said they did not oppose including Russia in talks, news reports said. 

Palestinians for the first time will be in charge of Christmas 
celebrations in Bethlehem, Israeli and Palestinian tourism officials 
announced. They said they will jointly promote the celebrations. 
Palestinian Minister of Tourism Elias Freij also is mayor of Bethlehem. 
He led efforts the past six years to shut down the city of 30,000 as 
part of the Palestinian protest against Israeli rule.  We would like to 
celebrate Christmas this year under the flags of peace,  he said. 

Echoing other Muslim leaders and the Vatican, Iran's health minister 
said this week's U.N. population conference in Cairo ignores Islamic 
values and promotes  sexual liberty.  Alireza Marandi was quoted by the 
Iranian news agency as saying the drafters of the document seemed to 
have disregarded the religious views of the Islamic world and  
formulated the text with a sense of sexual liberty, a phenomenon that 
is prohibited in Islam.  He added that Iran  will do its best to adapt 
the final document to the [country's] religious ethics. 

A move is under way in Israel to amend the Law of Return, which permits 
anyone with one Jewish grandparent to qualify as a Jew and be awarded 
instant citizenship and benefits. Officials said they are worried that 
because Israel is relatively prosperous and industrialized, millions of 
destitute people in impoverished lands will want to come. Officials 
fear the immigrants will claim to be Jewish or members of a lost tribe 
of Israel, or will agree to an easy conversion. The head of immigration 
for the quasi-official Jewish Agency told The Associated Press he will 
propose limited immigration rights to those with a Jewish parent. 
Opponents criticized such moves as racist. 

Malaysian officials apologized for the burning of a Croatian wooden 
cross by two Muslim soldiers assigned to United Nations peacekeeping 
duties in Bosnia. They said it was a case of poor judgment rather than 
malice. The soldiers had intended to use the wood to build a bench, 
they added. Two Christian soldiers among the 1,500man Malaysian unit, 
most of them Muslims, replaced the cross in a hillside ceremony near 
Sarajevo. 

A Greek temple on an island off Cyprus was dedicated to the worship of 
Apollo, archaeologists from New York University confirmed. Discoveries 
this summer ended years of speculation as to which divinity was 
worshiped on Yeronisos, Greek for  holy island.  It lies 10 miles north 
of Paphos, the ancient city dedicated to worship of the goddess 
Aphrodite.

Christian schools are becoming more racially integrated and 
academically strong, The Wall Street Journal said. Many of the schools 
sprang up in the last 20 years to avoid courtordered integration. 
Although socalled white flight from public schools still exists, 75% of 
Christian schools today are interracial, researchers estimate. 
Christian schools have been prompted by competition for students and 
pressure from parents to place a new emphasis on academic excellence. 
They now are the choice of a growing number of families frustrated with 
public schools, the Journal said. One million children attend 10,000 
Christian schools, and enrollment is climbing 10% a year. 
...Black, academically-and-morally rigorous day schools are one of the 
fastest-growing segments of the Christian education movement. An 
example is Love Christian Academy, a fouryear-old private school in 
Nanuet, N.Y., where 127 of 135 pupils are black. At the school, 
third-graders are taught to write resumes and eighthgraders study 
organic chemistry. All 12 of the 5-year-old kindergartners last year 
scored in the 99th percentile in the math and reading sections of the 
Stanford Achievement Test, the school said. 
...Love Christian Academy does not tolerate uninvolved parents. If they 
skip monthly meetings with teachers, or arrive late, they are fined 
$100. The 3,000-member Redeeming Love Christian Center, a Pentecostal 
congregation, has invested $7 million in Love Christian Academy through 
tithes and donations. 

The opening of school will be delayed one day this year because Rosh 
Hashana, the Jewish New Year, is the day after Labor Day. Several large 
public school districts, including those in New York and Los Angeles, 
agreed to delay school so Jews can observe the holiday. Rosh Hashana, 
the second-most important holiday on the Jewish calendar, falls after 
Labor Day about once every 30 years. 

One of the first preschools in the country devoted entirely to children 
affected by AIDS will open in Charlotte, N.C., this fall. 
Administrators of Agape Park were turned down for two years by churches 
and synagogues before members of Holy Trinity Lutheran Church voted to 
house the center. Agape Park will provide free day-care and programs 
for children as well as support for parents beginning in September. 

People get what they pay for -which means they think free vacation 
Bible school doesn't have much value, First Baptist Church in 
Newburyport, Mass., suspected. So the church paid several teachers in 
its congregation to put together a music-and-drama camp, and charged 
$15 per student. The rolls quickly filled. "They pay us to teach their 
kids Bible songs!" church member William Swilling told the Evangelistic 
Association of New England. Swilling got the idea when he noticed that 
Newburyport's free baseball league at the recreation center had 
virtually no players, but the paid league was full. 

A Mississippi law allowing prayer in school was put on hold by a 
federal judge in Jackson until he decides whether it is constitutional. 
The law took effect July 1. It allows voluntary "non-sectarian and 
non-proselytizing" invocations and benedictions as long as students 
initiate them. State chapters of the ACLU and People for the American 
Way challenged the measure on behalf of 14 parents and students. The 
judge granting the temporary injunction said the law is vague. The 
statute was passed after Jackson principal Bishop Knox was suspended 
for allowing students to read prayers over the intercom (NIRR 
12/27/93). 

Texas Southern University in Houston should "closely scrutinize" its 
practice of opening convocations, faculty meetings and commencement 
ceremonies with a Christian prayer, Texas Attorney General Dan Morales 
advised. The practice at the publicly funded, mostly black school 
raises constitutional problems, he said. 

Evolutionary psychology, a growing academic field, is painting a new 
portrait of human nature and sexuality, according to Robert Wright, 
author of the book The Moral Animal: Evolutionary Psychology and 
Everyday Life. The field examines how the process of natural selection 
has shaped the human mind. Until now, scientists believed that the 
evolutionary purpose of human sexuality was to maintain the family 
unit, Wright said in Time magazine. But evolutionary psychologists 
believe infidelity is natural, and people are designed to fall in love 
but not to stay in love. 
...Males advance evolution by sowing their seeds "far and wide," while 
women are more discriminating and seek mates with the "best genes." 
These strategies conflict and undermine love, the psychologists say. 

A child-rights group challenged Ohio's faith-healing law. A state 
statute allows a religious defense in felony child-endangerment and 
manslaughter cases. The suit was filed in federal court in Cincinnati 
on behalf of Children's Healthcare Is a Legal Duty (CHILD) and other 
plaintiffs. It claims the law deprives children of legal protections 
and endorses one religious belief over others. CHILD says it has 
documented the deaths of children after medical care was withheld on 
religious grounds in more than 15 sects. 

Growing up in single-parent homes: 18 million American children. That's 
27% of all children, or twice that of 1970, according to the Census 
Bureau report Marital Status and Living Arrangements. The single parent 
is almost as likely to be nevermarried (35%) as divorced (37%). 
Single-parent fathers increased from 9% to 13% since 1970. Some 3 
million children under 18 live with one or more grandparents. 
...Other findings: the number of never-married adults increased to 42.3 
million, twice as many as in 1970, and they account for the largest 
share of the 72.6 million unmarried population; unmarried couples 
living together last year numbered 3.5 million, nearly seven times the 
523,000 unmarried-couple households in 1970; people who live alone 
doubled to 23.6 million -- one in eight adults. 

Three divorces and you're out for United Methodist clergy in central 
Illinois. A minister contemplating a third divorce will be placed on a 
year's involuntary leave of absence under a new guideline adopted 
there. "We have to wonder about the relational skills of the 
clergyperson and his or her ability to live up to covenant 
faithfulness" when a third marriage fails, ministerial official Randall 
Robinson told the United Methodist Reporter. Imposed leave should not 
be seen as punitive, but as a "time-out [for] healing," he said. 

A church is not responsible for a car accident caused by its volunteer, 
the Supreme Court of New Hampshire ruled. Luc and Leeann Boissonnault 
sued the Federated Church of Bristol after the couple was injured in a 
collision between their motorcycle and a car driven by church volunteer 
Elizabeth Seeler. When the accident happened, Seeler, an elected member 
of the church finance committee, was delivering church financial 
records to the church treasurer, Religious Freedom Reporter said. The 
Boissonnaults argued that Seeler was an agent of the church, but the 
court said she was an independent contractor and the church had no 
control over her actions. 

New Yorkers came to Christ in record numbers during a month-long Jews 
for Jesus tract-distribution campaign in July, the group said (NIRR 
7/26/93). JFJ reported the largest response in 21 years of New York 
City campaigns. Gentiles and Jews who accepted Christ as their Messiah 
numbered 415, and 2,700 expressed interest in learning more about 
Christianity. Twenty-nine JFJ workers handed out 1,144,626 pieces of 
literature to passersby in subways, on street corners, and in Times 
Square. 
...Tracts were culturally relevant and sometimes humorous. Titles 
included "Beware of Religious Fanatics Handing Out Pamphlets," and "A 
Message to Suits." The evangelists also performed street drama, sang on 
street corners, and marched. For the first time, there was no organized 
opposition to the campaign, JFJ's Susan Perlman said. Jews for Jesus 
also held similar campaigns in Toronto, Paris, and Moscow this summer. 

A comprehensive directory of prayer ministries and prayer leaders in 
the United States is being compiled by the AD 2000 & Beyond Movement. 
Included are ministry descriptions, addresses, phone and fax numbers, 
and names of key personnel. Eddie Smith, a Baptist minister and U.S. 
Prayer Track coordinator, is assembling the data. Smith's address is 
7710-T Cherry Park Drive, Suite 224, Houston, Texas 77095. 
...AD 2000 is recruiting 25,000 congregations to "adopt" one of the 
world's 2,500 people-groups that still are unreached by the gospel. 
Volunteer congregations would research the culture and history of their 
group, establish communication, and eventually send a team there. Plans 
call for each of the 10 churches that adopt an unreached group to share 
information among themselves. Coordinating the effort is Adopt-A-People 
Clearinghouse, P.O. Box 17490, Colorado Springs, Colo. 80935. Their 
telephone number is 719-574-7001. 

Some 2.2 million free meals are being distributed to disadvantaged 
families across the United States this summer by Operation Blessing's 
Hunger Strike Force Convoy '94. OB, a ministry founded by Pat 
Robertson, began giving away the 3.4 million pounds of food and 
supplies in New York late last month. Trucks will visit 17 U.S. cities, 
ending in Pittsburgh on Oct. 20, the group said. 
...OB's refrigerated tractor-trailers collect donated fresh fruit, 
vegetables, and canned fruit gleaned from farms, processing companies, 
and manufacturers. They distribute it to disadvantaged families in 
inner cities, and disaster victims. In the first two years of its 
operation, the Strike Force distributed 19.5 million pounds of free 
food, clothing, and other supplies in 76 cities. To make sure 
individuals with the greatest need obtain the goods, vouchers are 
distributed through local agencies and churches. Disaster victims also 
receive new clothing, water, toiletries, bedding, building and medical 
supplies, and cleaning products. 

Sacramental use of peyote by American Indians was approved by the House 
of Representatives. Similar legislation was pending in the Senate. 
Peyote, a cactus whose buttonlike outgrowths are dried and chewed as a 
hallucinogenic drug, has been used in religious rites by Native 
Americans for many years. Some 50 U.S. Indian tribes use it, primarily 
through the Native American Church of North America. The legislation 
would codify protections that already exist in federal regulations and 
28 state laws. 

New Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer will be a centrist on 
church-state issues, many senators said. Breyer was confirmed by the 
Senate in a 87-9 vote as the 108th justice. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, 
ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said Breyer "rejects the 
extreme secularist view" of an absolute wall of separation between 
church and state. Breyer recognizes that there are "vast areas where 
religious institutions can neutrally receive benefits from government," 
Hatch said. 
...Not all agreed with that appraisal of Breyer. Sen. Trent Lott 
(R-Miss.) said the judge's ruling in a religious school case turns the 
high court's precedents in religious freedom cases on their heads. In a 
1989 appeals court decision, Breyer ruled that a Baptist school's 
free-exercise rights were not violated by requiring its secular 
curriculum to be approved by local school district officials. 

A religious discrimination suit was filed in federal court in Cleveland 
against the nearby city of Strongsville, Ohio. The 65-member Southwest 
Victory Center Church accused city officials of wrongfully preventing 
the church from moving into a leased building in an industrial area. 
The lawsuit said the city's planning commission voted 5-0 to deny the 
church an occupancy permit. The action is illegal, since it restricts 
religious practices without any compelling reason, the suit said. It 
noted that the office park already is occupied by facilities that care 
for children and the elderly, and athletic fields, as well as by 
businesses. Attached to the legal papers was an affidavit from another 
pastor who had looked for a site for his own church. He said Mayor 
Walter Ehrnfelt told him, "We run churches out of town." 

A federal judge invalidated a Cincinnati charter amendment that denied 
homosexuals protection against discrimination. U.S. District Judge 
Arthur Spiegel, in a 75-page decision, said the measure was 
unconstitutionally vague and violated the First Amendment rights of 
homosexuals. He also issued an order prohibiting the matter from ever 
appearing on a ballot again. The amendment, approved by voters last 
fall (NIRR 11/15/93), barred the city from enacting or enforcing 
discrimination laws based on sexual orientation. It also eliminated 
sexual orientation as a basis for such discrimination complaints. 
Business leaders and hotel officials, who said the city lost millions 
of dollars because of convention boycotts, applauded Spiegel's 
decision. The city plans to appeal. 

American Baptists stand to lose churches -- whichever way they turn. 
Conservative American Baptist congregations have threatened to leave 
the denomination if regional or national leaders affirm homosexuality, 
according to The Christian Century. At the same time, liberal 
congregations that have joined a three-year-old association that 
welcomes gays, lesbians, and bisexuals are facing removal from the 
denomination, the publication said. 
...Two seemingly conflicting resolutions on homosexuality were adopted 
by the General Board in 1992. One declares homosexuality is 
incompatible with Christian teaching, while the other acknowledges a 
diversity of views and calls for dialogue on the subject. The ABC has 
held together a mix of conservative and liberal congregations for 50 
years. American Baptists have long been leaders in the ecumenical 
movement and in social reform, but also have a strong evangelical 
contingent that believes the Bible prohibits homosexuality. 

Collapse of the "theological center" is creating confusion and 
hesitation in mainline churches, said Leander Keck, professor of 
biblical theology and former dean of Yale University Divinity School. 
Keck spoke at what was described as an "intense and often acrimonious" 
theological conference July 19-23 in Craigville, Mass. About 100 
theologians, pastors, seminarians, and laypeople from the United Church 
of Christ attended. 
...Keck questioned whether an indecisive church can lead effectively. 
Others at the conference said mainline churches have allowed political 
and social agendas to control theology. That drew a challenge from Paul 
Sherry, president of the UCC, who said theological convictions motivate 
the UCC's social commitments, and not the other way around. Sherry said 
he sensed that a "serious biblical and theological engagement" is 
emerging in the denomination. Leaders of "Confessing Christ," a 
year-old centrist movement in the UCC, called for a Christ-centered 
renewal and commitment to defending people who are victims of 
injustice. 

United Methodist planners narrowed to five the number of cities 
considered as new headquarters site of their denomination's 
480-employee mission agency: Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, and 
Washington. The selection is to be made by September 1995. The General 
Board of Global Ministries is based in New York. 

Fallout from Pensacola: The U.S. Senate condemned by a vote of 98-0 the 
killing of Dr. John Britton and his bodyguard, allegedly by former 
Presbyterian minister Paul Hill, at an abortion clinic (NIRR 8/8). The 
measure, an amendment to an appropriation bill, also called on federal 
law enforcement agencies to enforce and investigate activities under an 
earlier federal law to protect abortion clinics. "Those of us who are 
pro-life and feel very strongly about protecting the lives of the 
unborn also feel very strongly about protecting the lives of those that 
are born," Sen. Bob Smith (R-N.H.) said. Hill pleaded not guilty to the 
federal charges. 
...Attorney General Janet Reno said the Justice Department was 
investigating whether there is a nationwide conspiracy by militant 
abortion opponents to attack clinics and workers. An aide said some of 
the nation's 3,000 abortion clinics would receive temporary protection 
from federal marshals after consultations with local police. The FBI 
reportedly was circulating a list of 25 pro-life advocates, including 
several independent or breakaway ministers, who had signed a 
declaration that abortion makes homicide justifiable. 
...In Alabama, Catholic priest David Trosch, suspended by the Church 
for his support for lethal force against abortion doctors and one of 
the declaration signers, denied a conspiracy, The New York Times said. 
...An anonymous caller phoned a Catholic church in the Miami area and 
threatened to kill 20 clergymen in retaliation for the two deaths at 
the abortion clinic in Pensacola, Catholic officials said. The FBI and 
police were notified, and Catholic and Episcopal priests were warned to 
be careful and dress inconspicuously. A fire that destroyed a Planned 
Parenthood clinic in Brainerd, Minn., was deliberately set, authorities 
said. Earlier, a firebomb damaged an abortion clinic in Falls Church, 
Va., the same day as the Pensacola killings. 

An abortion clinic in Greenville, S.C., sued its former manager and 
assistant manager under the federal RICO statute. The suit by Palmetto 
State Medical Center claims the pair tried to put the clinic out of 
business by booking phony appointments to keep doctors from seeing real 
patients. The two women were fired in March after the doctor who owns 
the clinic taped phone conversations they had with each other and an 
abortion foe. 

Fetuses feel pain, so anesthetics should be administered before 
abortions, a new study in the medical magazine The Lancet finds. 
Researchers at Queen Charlotte's Hospital in London measured 
stress-hormone levels in fetuses 23-34 weeks of gestation by taking 
blood samples from their umbilical cords and abdomens. Pro-life leaders 
said the research shows the humanity of unborn children. A commentary 
on the study said unconscious patients can respond to stimuli without 
feeling pain. 

Hillary Clinton is spokeswoman for The Salvation Army's 1994 Christmas 
campaign, the organization's largest fund-raising effort of the year. 
Clinton has taped a public-service television announcement for 
broadcast during the holiday season, and the Army is preparing 
brochures featuring a message from her. 
...The Army received "a number of comments" from people unhappy about 
the choice, according to Jim Bradley of The Salvation Army's national 
communications office. Callers said Clinton's stands on abortion and 
homosexuality conflict with Army positions. The Army does not consider 
the spokeswoman's role to be political, Bradley said. Several other 
first ladies have been spokeswomen. 

Christian Family Day at Busch Stadium in St. Louis was a hit. This 
year's fourth-annual day of Cardinals baseball, music, and testimonies 
drew a sold-out crowd of 52,000 fans last month. That included 10,526 
church members and their guests. Fans came from 350 churches and 
parachurch groups in 14 states. Testimonies came from baseball players 
such as Tommy Herr, a former all-star second baseman who played on 
three championship Cardinal teams in the 1980s. 
...The sight of Christians having fun -- and the witnesses of well 
respected Cardinals heroes -- has "portrayed a lot healthier image of 
Christianity and Christians to the St. Louis community," said Michael 
McHardy. He is general manager of Christian radio station KSIV-AM, 
which cosponsored the event. Other co-sponsors are added each year as 
more Christian business people become involved, McHardy said. Local NBC 
and ABC television affiliates and the "very liberal" St. Louis Post 
Dispatch portrayed Christian Family Day in an upbeat manner, McHardy 
told NIRR. "It's a user-friendly way to share the gospel," he said. 

The Commonwealth Games in Vancouver, B.C., attracted Christians from 
various Canadian denominations for an evangelistic outreach. The 
population of Victoria -- approximately 300,000 -- is expected to 
double when 3,000 athletes and 300,000 fans arrive for the games, Aug. 
18-28. An estimated 1 billion people will watch the games on TV. 
...Outreach is being coordinated by Island Alive, a group of 40 
churches and other organizations in Vancouver. International Teams of 
Canada and Youth With A Mission also are working with Island Alive. 
Groups will distribute 115,000 copies of an evangelistic souvenir 
booklet from the International Bible Society. Training for Triumph 
includes facts about Victoria, a schedule, and a gospel presentation. 
Some booklets will be distributed during the 3- to 5-hour wait to board 
the ferry to the island, IBS' Davyd Hepburn said. Drama, music, 
door-to-door witnessing, and sports clinics also are planned. "The 
Communists told me there is no God. Now the Communists are gone and God 
is here," a woman said at an evangelistic tent meeting in Blansko, 
Czech Republic, last month. Once known as "Red Blansko," the city of 
20,000 people located in the southeast part of the country, was a 
notorious stronghold of communism. Many Communist Party officials lived 
there, commuting to jobs at a munitions factory in nearby Adama. 
Blansko once seemed impenetrable to the gospel, but spiritual hunger is 
prevalent and the church is growing. 
..."This is a very special place in God's heart," said Cindy Keehn, an 
American missionary with the Minnetonka, Minn.-based Christian Outreach 
International, who lives in Blansko. A COI group of 96 mostly college 
and high school athletes, musicians, and evangelists traveled from the 
United States and Canada to hold several days of evangelistic meetings 
there last month. In addition to the tent meetings, the group led some 
120 Czech and Polish children to Christ, including the National Youth 
Choir of Poland and its adult leaders, at a music camp there. 
...The entire rosters of three local sports teams -- men's and women's 
basketball and field hockey -- came to Christ in Uzgorod, Ukraine, 
after their COI opponents sang and preached to them during the 
halftimes of games. COI football player Bill Berghoeffer told NIRR that 
the short-term mission experience was life-changing for his teammates 
as well as those they witnessed to. Football players act tough, but 
seeing the extreme physical and spiritual poverty of Eastern Europeans 
broke through emotional barriers, he said. "Now we aren't afraid to cry 
-and still knock heads [during the games]." Additional ministry through 
song, drama, and testimony on a public square and in hospitals in 
Uzgorod resulted in numerous additional decisions for Christ, said Jack 
Isleib, COI's executive director. 
...Also in Uzgorod, the Brunswick, Ga.-based MAP International 
delivered some $650,000 worth of donated medicines to hospitals. 
Central City Hospital has only about 150 of 2,000 medicines it needs, 
and 60% of necessary medical equipment, said Valerie Chevnisko, chief 
of doctors. "It is because of you that we exist," he told MAP 
representative Phil Craven. 

Russian Orthodox priests are using questionable methods to raise money 
for their cash-strapped churches, The Moscow Times reported. Despite 
opposition from fellow priests, some are marketing mineral water. 
Others are blessing apartments, businesses, bars, and casinos. At least 
one is accepting money for waving incense and sprinkling holy water 
over used cars, the newspaper said. He charges 30,000 to 50,000 rubles 
($15 to $25), depending on the car, the Times noted. "Many churches are 
in great need of renovation," one of the priests said. A church 
spokesman said priests are authorized to bless homes, businesses, and 
other property, but not to ask for money for blessings. 

A former propaganda radio network in Ukraine is being used to broadcast 
the gospel. Communist radio broadcasters once drilled indoctrination 
into listeners in public buildings and hotel rooms. Loudspeakers could 
be turned on and off only from broadcast headquarters. But that network 
now airs the weekly Christian radio program Voice of Love from stations 
in Kiev and Rovno to more than 102 million people in Ukraine and 
neighboring nations. Many live in areas where there are no evangelical 
churches. Thousands of listeners to the program, aired Saturdays at 9 
p.m., have sent the station testimonies about their conversions, 
according to Christian Aid Mission, a non-denominational support agency 
based in Charlottesville, Va. 
...Six Ukrainian brothers began Voice of Love and related ministries. 
Under communism, the brothers, whose last name is Radchuk, traveled 
from village to village preaching, although it was dangerous to do so, 
John Linder of Christian Aid Mission told NIRR. In 1990, with new 
freedoms, the brothers established the Good News Samaritan mission to 
aid the poor and preach the gospel. Pawel Radchuk now runs the 
fledgling mission, his brother Slavik conducts a series of evangelistic 
crusades, and another brother, Vasily, directs the radio program. 

The world's largest annual migration of people was targeted for 
evangelism. More than 40 groups cooperated to reach the estimated 1 
million Moroccan expatriates who migrate south through Spain to their 
homeland, or vacation in Spain, during late July and early August. More 
than half the North African Berbers are employed in southern Europe, 
mostly in France, organizers said. Evangelistic groups planned to 
distribute more than 100,000 New Testaments plus other literature, 
along with audio cassettes of the Jesus film in Arabic and Riffi Berber 
languages and schedules of Christian radio broadcasts beamed into 
Africa from Europe. 
...Team members were surprised at the openness and gratitude shown by 
the Moroccans, Baptist Press said. Many Berbers said it was the first 
Bible they ever had seen. Berbers seemed distant at first, but "when 
you talk to them and get to know them a bit, they are warm and open," a 
team member said. The Berbers were nominally Christian until Islam was 
brought to Morocco by invading Arab armies in the 7th century. There is 
a revival of Berber culture going on, and some are seeking an identity 
in their Christian past, according to Patrick Johnstone's Operation 
World. 

In Haiti, Catholic bishops and leaders of an evangelical council called 
for three days of prayer Aug. 12-14 for the future of the country. They 
appealed for divine protection from invasion threatened by the United 
States under a United Nations resolution. All schools, businesses, and 
government offices closed Aug. 12, while churches remained open 
throughout the weekend. Banners bearing the message, "Savior, Haiti is 
in Your Hands" appeared around Portau-Prince, according to news 
reports. 
...Fifty American missionaries in Haiti check on each other's safety 
daily by ham radio. "Pray for our safety, that we would have godly 
wisdom, that we would be strong and of good courage," Southern Baptist 
missionary David Heady told Baptist Press. Several hundred of the 
estimated 2,000 missionaries on the island left when the U.S. State 
Department called for evacuation in June. 

Guatemala's former president Efrain Rios-Montt, an evangelical and 
retired general, was elected to the Guatemalan congress. Rios-Montt ran 
on an anti-crime, anti-corruption platform. His rightist Guatemalan 
Republican Front (FRG) will hold the majority of seats there, according 
to published results. He hopes to run for president in 1995. 

Land-mine detonations kill or maim 300 Cambodians a day, the American 
Friends Service Committee said. Mines were planted throughout the 
country during the past 25 years of war, and 10 million live mines 
remain. Several non-government organizations -- including the Friends 
committee, the Catholic Maryknoll order, and Handicapped International 
-- operate a rehabilitation center in Phnom Penh. It manufactures 
prosthetic limbs and teaches Cambodian amputees to use them, according 
to Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) News. The National Rehabilitation 
Center, which shares property with a Buddhist monastery, rehabilitates 
25 land-mine victims at a time. Five monastery monks will help fit 
patients with prosthetic limbs. 

Rwandan Christians smuggled hundreds of their terrified countrymen to 
safety in neighboring Zaire before the mass exodus from Rwanda several 
weeks ago. Members of the Hutu and Tutsi tribes used their homes to 
hide the people, many of whom are war orphans cowering in the bush. At 
a given signal, in an operation reminiscent of the American Civil War's 
Underground Railroad, Christians in groups of 12 to 15 led the refugees 
at night on foot along secret routes or by fishing boat to the border. 
There they were handed over to Zairian Christians and taken to the 
towns of Goma and Bukavu. If caught inside Rwanda by warring militia, 
such children would likely have been shot or immobilized by severing 
their Achilles tendons. Mark Mosely of MAP International, the Christian 
medical relief group that helped organize "Operation Moses" and is 
providing aid in the area, told NIRR he visited an orphanage in Goma 
that housed 400 children, 250 of whom were smuggled out by Christians. 
Once in Zaire, some of the refugees are transported to resettlement 
centers. 
...All was not grim in Rwanda, Mosely told the Savannah NewsPress. For 
every heinous act, machete or machine gun wound, or every orphaned 
child, "I saw five acts of bravery that renewed my faith." 

Americans are digging deep to ease Rwandan suffering, donating at the 
same levels they did during famines in Somalia and Ethiopia last year. 
The top 20 U.S. aid groups working in Rwanda have raised more than $6 
million from individuals and $50 million from corporate gifts, 
according to Mike Kiernan of InterAction, a Washington, D.C.-based 
coalition of agencies. Mail rooms are filled with checks and 800 
numbers are swamped with calls from people concerned and moved by the 
plight of Rwandans, Kiernan told NIRR. 
...In what may be the biggest donation of drugs ever, pharmaceutical 
giant Eli Lilly gave a $30 million supply of the oral antibiotic Ceclor 
to MAP International. Lilly had warehoused large doses of extended-dose 
Ceclor, its expiration date nearing, while it awaited approval from the 
Food and Drug Administration for the higher dosage. 
...Samaritan's Purse shipped 33 tons of medicines, generators, 
surgical, obstetrical, and pediatric equipment and supplies, and 
vehicles to Kigali, Rwanda. The Boone, N.C., relief organization has 25 
doctors, nurses, and relief workers in Rwanda. The group also is caring 
for 500 orphans in Rutare, 15 miles north of Kigali, and providing 
medical care for 100,000 Rwandans in a refugee camp in Rutare. 
...World Vision is caring for 5,000 unaccompanied children in nine 
centers in Zaire and Rwanda. At least 50,000 children have been 
separated from their families or no longer have parents. Each day, more 
children come out of hiding and arrive at the centers. Feed the Hungry, 
Lutheran World Relief, and Church World Service also announced 
increased efforts to alleviate suffering in Rwanda. 

Congo replaced independence day celebrations with a requiem mass for 
142 people, many of them children, killed in a stampede at a 
Brazzaville Catholic church. More than 100 others were injured, some 
seriously. News reports said tens of thousands of people had flocked to 
the church for a Friday night service. It featured Abbot Isidore 
Malonga, who preached all week at the church. Radio ads promised 
miracles at the Friday service. Witnesses said 2,000 people who jammed 
in the church were preparing to leave when a downpour occurred. 
Thousands outside rushed for cover. As people lost their footing, they 
were trampled to death, Reuters reported. 

Radical Muslims threatened France with retaliation for a police 
crackdown after fundamentalists in Algiers killed five French 
officials. The outlawed Algerian Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) said it 
will retaliate if France does not free a number of Muslims, including 
several clergy, detained after the attack on a French embassy housing 
compound in Algiers. Islamic guerrilla groups have been fighting to 
topple the Algerian government, and have warned foreigners to leave the 
country or face death. Some 4,000 lives have been lost in the violence 
since the government's 1992 cancellation of elections, which FIS was 
expected to win. Islamic leaders in Paris warned the radicals that such 
violence in France could prompt a backlash against the country's 4 
million Muslims. Police already have stepped up identity checks. They 
have also taken other security measures, which resulted in the 
detentions, news accounts indicated. Authorities also banned the sale 
or distribution of five Muslim publications in France on grounds they 
supported terrorism. 

Thousands of cheering British Muslims in London called for the 
destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic superpower. 
All international organizations, including the United Nations, are "in 
the hands of the imperialist superpowers [and] are unacceptable to 
Muslims and Islam," Farid Kassim, spokesman for the militant group Hizb 
ut-Tahrir, told the International Muslim Khalifah Conference. Some 
7,000 people attended the conference. 

Muslims who consider their sect's leader to be the messiah have been 
banned in Malaysia. Officials said Sufi Muslims known as Al Arqam teach 
a heretical brand of Islam. The officials claim to have tapes and 
transcripts in which sect leader Ashaari Muhammad, 57, tells how the 
movement will take over Malaysia, Indonesia, and central Asia. El Arqam 
members in Malaysia number 100,000, with more in other countries. 
Ashaari was exiled to Thailand, but later left. In Jordan, he vowed to 
return to Malaysia to confront his accusers. 

Muslim extremists released unharmed a Catholic priest held hostage in 
the southern Philippines for two months (NIRR 8/8). They had demanded a 
ransom of $115,000 for Cirilo Nacorda, 36, but received only $1,900 
from government negotiators, officials said. They said that Barahama 
Sali, second-in-command of the fundamentalist Abu Sayyaf group, ordered 
the release as he lay dying from gunshot wounds suffered in an ambush 
by government troops. The priest prayed for his captor before the rebel 
leader died, a Manila radio station reported. Nacorda had been seized 
in a June 8 attack on a bus. Rebels allegedly killed 15 Christian men 
on the bus for refusing to recite Islamic prayers. 

Bangladeshi physician-turnedauthor Taslima Nasrin, 32, fled to Sweden 
under a death threat from Islamic fundamentalists. She had spent two 
months hiding in her country. Nasrin reportedly had called for revision 
of the Koran so women would be better treated by Islam (NIRR 7/11), an 
alleged violation of the country's blasphemy law. In a deal with the 
Bangladesh government, she paid bail and was permitted to leave the 
country pending a trial. 
...Mahmoud Aldebe, chairman of the Islamic Council in Sweden, said 
Nasrin has nothing to fear from Muslim groups in Sweden. "To punish 
those who blaspheme Islam is for God to do, not us," he told reporters. 
But he called on the author to refrain from being "provocative" while 
there. An estimated 200,000 Muslims live in Sweden, mostly immigrants 
from Bosnia, Iran, and Turkey. Swedish officials said Nasrin can remain 
as long as she likes. Meanwhile, thousands of Muslim militants took to 
the streets of Dhaka and demanded that Nasrin be returned to Bangladesh 
so they can hang her. 

Controversy is spreading over a play about Jesus at this month's 
theatrical festival in Edinburgh, Scotland. The play, Passion, portrays 
Jesus as an ordinary man who did not die on the cross. Instead, he made 
love to Mary Magdalene, a former prostitute, on the Mount of Olives 
before escaping to France, where they raised two children. City 
official Moira Knox called the play a "blasphemous and crass mockery of 
the life of Christ," newspapers reported. 

Muslim scholars joined the Vatican and other conservative religious 
forces in criticizing the proposed world population control document to 
be acted upon at a United Nations conference in Cairo next month. The 
Islamic Studies Center at the al-Azhar University in Cairo, Islam's 
most prestigious educational institution, said the document's vague 
wording condones extramarital sex and easy abortion, undermines 
parental authority, and could encourage prostitution. 

Catholic priest Robert Van Handel was sentenced to the maximum eight 
years in prison for molesting a 14year-old boy while he ran the Santa 
Barbara (Calif.) Boys Choir. Van Handel was one of a dozen people 
accused of participating in sex acts or questionable activities with 34 
boys who attended St. Anthony's Seminary from 1964 to 1987. He wrote in 
his diary that he became sexually aroused by watching boys sing in the 
choir. Earlier, another priest was sentenced to jail in the case. 
Authorities said the statute of limitations had expired on many others 
who would have been prosecuted. Judge Patrick McMahon castigated Van 
Handel for betraying his trust. The school closed in 1987. 

A London man convicted of plotting to blackmail the Catholic Church 
with false allegations of sex abuse by priests was given a jail 
sentence of 18 months. Mark Callaghan, 35, and a friend who has fled to 
Thailand sent letters to bishops in Britain demanding  550,000 (about 
$845,000). The letters warned that unless the money was deposited in a 
bank account, the authors would tell the press or sue. 

An Episcopal bishop's son accused retired priest J. Faulton Hodge of 
abusing him sexually for 12 years. Jeffrey Haines, 34, son of Bishop 
Ronald Haines of Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit for $130,000, saying 
the abuse lasted until he was 20 years old. Hodge formerly served 
parishes in Asheville, N.C. Haines said he recovered memory of the 
molestation while undergoing therapy. His lawyer, Denis Ventriglia, 
said no hypnosis was involved in the therapy, and that he tried to 
settle the matter privately but church leaders were intransigent. The 
suit also names the Diocese of Western North Carolina and current and 
former bishops, saying they knew or should have known about Hodge. The 
priest denied the charges, saying Haines is out to make money. 

Nearly 200,000 Catholic Filipinos rallied in Manila Aug. 14 to protest 
an anti-contraceptive campaign by the government of President Fidel 
Ramos. The demonstration came in response to a call by Cardinal Jaime 
Sin. Its purpose was "to make known to the president and his cabinet 
our indignation and outrage at the abuses being allowed by the 
government against the family and our children," he said. He said 
educators planned to give pornographic materials and films to children 
to popularize contraceptives. In 1986, the prelate's call for a "people 
power" rally sparked an uprising that toppled then president Ferdinand 
Marcos. 
...Government officials the next day said they worked out a compromise 
with the church for a document the Philippines will present at the U.N. 
population conference. Details were not disclosed, but presumably the 
government agreed to support the church's anti-abortion stance. 

The Coptic pope is a dictator, several Coptic priests in Egypt say. 
They allege that Pope Shenouda, head of the 2,000-year-old Orthodox 
denomination that claims the allegiance of 10 million Copts, 
excommunicates or exiles to monasteries those who question his 
policies. They say his resistance to financial accountability has 
raised questions in the minds of some donors. 
...Shenouda disciplined parish priest Agathon Anba Bishoy, former 
secretary to the patriarchy, in July. Newspapers reported that the pope 
exiled Agathon to a monastery because of his "unnecessary involvement 
in financial matters of the church." The priest, who refused the papal 
order and was excommunicated, said the pope exiled him for opposing his 
policies. The pope "is human, he is liable to make mistakes, and when 
we point out these mistakes, he regards it as treachery," Agathon said. 

A pastor resigned his 16-year ministry after his arrest on 
drunkendriving charges on the way home from Foxwoods casino in 
Massachusetts. John Wibley apologized to his 250-member congregation at 
First Assembly of God in Worcester for being "enticed" to enter the 
casino after spotting it from the highway. Newspapers quoted him as 
saying that he did not gamble, but browsed shops and watched boxing 
matches. 

George Cornell, a pioneer in reporting religion for the secular press, 
died at age 74. Cornell, an Episcopalian layman and author, was a 
religion writer for The Associated Press for 43 years. 

...Jacob A.O. Preus, 74, president of the Lutheran Church-Missouri 
Synod 1969-1981, who led a purge of theological liberalism from 
Concordia Seminary; in Burnsville, Minn., of an apparent heart attack. 
...Paul Anderson, 61, 1956 Olympic gold medalist in weightlifting, 
sports evangelist billed as "the world's strongest man," and director

Bandit soldiers in Sudan held seven members of a Samaritan's Purse 
medical relief team hostage for 21 hours while storming a village in 
southern Sudan late last month. The seven -- five from the United 
States, one from the Philippines, and one from Canada -- were meeting 
with leaders in the village of Fangak when gunfire and mortar 
explosions broke out. The team took refuge in the Samaritan's Purse 
supply house, lying on the floor to escape injury. The soldiers 
proceeded to "trash and steal just about everything in the house," said 
Paul Jones, a physician and leader of the team. One soldier grabbed a 
female team member by the arm, but relented when team members gathered 
around her. They remained confined until the soldiers allowed them to 
radio the United Nations for a rescue plane. The plane flew them to 
safety in northern Kenya. Jones speculated that the soldiers may have 
been a "renegade splinter group just raiding for the sake of raiding." 
...The civil war that has raged for 10 years between southern and 
northern forces (NIRR 3/7) is "a holocaust few know about," says 
Brother Andrew of Open Doors. A million and a half people have died 
from starvation or murder, and five million have been driven out of 
their homes. Some have gone to concentration camps hidden in the 
desert, he said. Grisly reports abound of Christians crucified for 
their faith, churches burned, families torn apart, and lands seized. 
Nevertheless, thousands of Muslims are coming to Christ in Sudan, 
Brother Andrew said. 

Opposition from the Orthodox Church and the Communist Party forced 
Operation Mobilization to cancel an Aug. 3 evangelistic mission to the 
port city of Varna, Bulgaria. OM decided not to let the ship Doulos 
dock in order to protect the safety of OM workers already in Bulgaria. 
Instead, the ship planned to anchor off Varna while the 300 
missionaries on board spent the day praying for "the shrinking 
religious freedom in Bulgaria," OM's Lane Powell said. Democratsia, a 
Bulgarian newspaper, published an article calling the visit a 
"propaganda aim" and alleging that the Doulos would bring "literature 
from a pile of other religions and sects." The article also printed the 
private address of Judith Fredericsen, OM's leader in Bulgaria. Local 
Varna papers published articles identifying the Doulos as part of the 
"Moonie sect" and urging Orthodox bishops to board the ship and throw 
the literature into the sea. The Communist Party paper published a 
private letter written by Fredericsen, which had been stolen from her 
files, OM said. 

Russian police roughed up three Jews for Jesus missionaries as they 
handed out tracts in Moscow subway stations, JFJ coordinator Avi Snyder 
said. One was American Jennifer Shapiro. The others were a Russian 
female volunteer and a male worker from Ukraine. Snyder said the 
incidents were further evidence of increasing hostility toward 
evangelicals by authorities. Regulations ban advertising and littering 
in the museum-like Metro stations, but the rules are unevenly enforced, 
observers said. Shapiro said that when an officer told her to leave the 
station, she claimed she had a religious right to be there. Two other 
officers joined in shoving and dragging her, she said, then took her 
into a room for questioning. She also alleged that they made 
anti-Semitic remarks about her to passersby. After a short time, they 
released her, and she returned to her post to hand out more literature, 
she said. JFJ workers are equipped with plastic trash bags and gloves 
to clean up discarded literature. 

Zimbabwe will not allow any more missionaries into the country unless 
they have special skills that make them "a valuable asset to the 
country," a government cabinet minister announced. "We had over a 
century learning the Bible from overseas missionaries, and now we no 
longer need them to come and teach us," Home Affairs Minister Dumiso 
Dabengwa said in a Harare newspaper interview. But, said Murombedzi 
Kuchera, general secretary of the Zimbabwe Council of Churches, "we 
wonder how the government knows that we do not need foreign 
missionaries since they have never discussed the issue with us." He 
said the African country is desperate for doctors, teachers, and 
theological lecturers. More than 200 missionary doctors who serve in 
the former British colony are expected to have their work permits 
readily renewed. The church in Zimbabwe is regarded as the main 
contributor to health, education, and farming services in rural areas, 
the German Press Agency reported. At least a fourth of the nearly 11 
million population is considered nominally Christian. 

Among those killed in Rwanda are a Jesus film team member, a staff 
support person and her family, and two Free Methodist Church pastors 
who were volunteers with the film teams. A Campus Crusade spokesman 
said the killings occurred early last month. The film was being shown 
to large groups of Rwandans who had left their homes to seek refuge 
from violence rooted in political and ethnic conflict, he said. Prior 
to the crisis, film teams had shown the Kinyarwanda translation of 
Jesus to hundreds of thousands of people throughout the country. 
...Several translators of the new interconfessional Kinyarwanda Bible 
were killed, and others have not been heard from, News Network 
International reported. Denominational and mission sources say losses 
of life and property among the Christian community have been 
devastating. One-fourth of all Catholic priests in Rwanda were 
murdered, a Catholic information agency estimated. 
..."This is horrible. People are everywhere with absolutely nothing. 
The people are absolutely miserable," Bamoleke Ruvamwabo, director of 
Community of Baptist Churches in Goma, Zaire, told World Relief. The 
group is providing water containers, soap, bowls, cups, and plastic 
sheeting for shelter. Southern Baptists have concentrated on saving the 
lives of children in two UNICEF camps who have become separated from 
their parents. The children were to be fed powdered formula mixed with 
water pumped from nearby streams and purified by solar-powered systems 
provided through the SBC Foreign Missions Board. The Evangelical 
Lutheran Church in America and the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod were 
sending regular shipments of food, quilts, clothing, and tools. 
Missionary Aviation Fellowship was providing communication services to 
Christian agencies and local churches assisting the refugees, and 
transporting vaccines and medical personnel. Funding for the flights 
came from an emergency grant from Campus Crusade for Christ. Other 
relief agencies assisting Rwandans include: American Red Cross, 
AmeriCares, CARE, Adventist Development and Relief Agency, Concern 
Worldwide, Catholic Relief Services, Church World Service, Doctors 
Without Borders USA, International Rescue Committee, Oxfam America, 
Mennonite Central Committee, Operation Blessing, Save the Children, 
World Concern, World Relief, and World Vision. 

Memorial services were held last month for Mission Aviation Fellowship 
pilot Alan King and a Brazilian national missionary, Hernan Artigas. 
Their single-engine MAF plane crashed and burned just after takeoff 
from an airstrip in Venezuela, apparently from an engine malfunction, 
MAF workers said. 

Southern Baptists complained to the Israeli government after an attack 
on the home of an American missionary. They requested reimbursement for 
damages and assurances of police protection after militant Jewish 
settlers, angered by the return of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat to Gaza, 
stormed through the neighborhood one night last month, shouting, 
looting, and throwing rocks through windows. Jerusalem House, owned by 
the Baptist Convention of Israel, serves as a student center and a home 
for American missionary Ray Hicks and his family. It is in a 
predominantly Arab section of Jerusalem. Hicks said Israeli soldiers 
and helicopters with searchlights followed some 2,000 rioters, but made 
no effort to stop them. He said his family was frightened and narrowly 
escaped injury from rocks and shattered glass. A gate, though damaged, 
withstood battering and prevented the mob from entering the facility, 
he added. 
...Lutherans are protesting an Israeli military raid July 2 on an East 
Jerusalem hospital operated by the Lutheran World Federation. LWF 
officials said the grounds for the incident remain unclear. They said 
the Augusta Victoria Hospital was kept in a state of siege for almost 
an hour, and a number of doors were forced open or broken. 

A U.S. missionary priest was kidnapped while saying Sunday Mass in a 
Catholic chapel in a remote town in the southern Philippines. Muslim 
guerrillas with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) rescued him 
after a gun battle with the abductors, church officials said. Clarence 
Bertelsman, 63, from Belleville, Ill., was wounded in the hand, but two 
of his kidnappers were killed and two others wounded in the shootout. 
The MNLF and government are negotiating a truce to end a 20-year 
insurgency. Smaller extremist groups are continuing their rebellion. 
...A Catholic priest was still being held by Islamic gunmen in the 
southern Philippines last month. He was one of 74 people abducted from 
a bus by the fundamentalist Muslim Abu Sayyaf rebels in June. They 
killed 15 Christians in the group, reportedly for declining to recite 
an Islamic prayer, and freed 57. Another escaped, leaving priest Cirilo 
Nacorda, 36, as the only captive. The rebels threatened to kill him 
unless they received a ransom of $115,000. Church and government 
officials refused to hand over money, and government assaults on Abu 
Sayyaf hideouts failed to free him. Rumors said fundamentalists would 
turn over the priest to the MNLF. 
...More than 1,500 Christian vigilantes in the Philippines are ready to 
kidnap or kill Muslims in an "eye for an eye" campaign against the 
Islamic extremists, a retired Catholic bishop told reporters. 
Government officials announced they would not allow civilian volunteers 
to arm themselves and take the law into their own hands. A church peace 
group warned that a religious war could erupt soon. 

Some 120,000 people made public professions of faith in Christ during 
Reinhard Bonnke's crusade in Zaire. Bonnke tripped off a curb and broke 
his foot as he made his way through crowds of well-wishers at the 
airport in remote Lumbumbashi. Undaunted, the German evangelist 
preached -from a borrowed bar stool -- in a stadium the next six days. 
Organizers reported cumulative attendance of 350,000, with more than 
90,000 at the final meeting. Some 120 local churches sponsored the 
crusade, and thousands of pastors and other church workers from across 
Zaire attended daily leadership seminars. More than 60,000 people 
attended a Saturday afternoon session in the stadium to hear Bonnke, a 
Pentecostal, explain how to experience the baptism of the Holy Spirit, 
organizers said. 
...Bonnke met with President Frederick Chiluba of neighboring Zambia, 
and led the president's son to Christ, the evangelist's aides said. 
Then he traveled to Seoul, South Korea, to address 30,000 people in six 
meetings at the World Holy Spirit Conference. Next, Bonnke traveled to 
the Caribbean island of Trinidad for a five-day crusade. The crowd of 
55,000 at the final service was the largest gathering in the history of 
Trinidad and Tobago, local officials said. 

More than 20,000 teen-agers thronged into Washington, D.C., for the 
first part of Youth for Christ's five-day DC/LA '94 evangelism 
conference. They met with thousands of other teens July 29 on the 
National Mall to celebrate True Love Waits, a nationwide campaign in 
which young people promise not to have sex until marriage. Beginning at 
dawn, thousands of teens hammered more than 200,000 small stakes 
holding cards into the Mall lawn. The abstinence cards were signed by 
teen-agers from across the country. That evening, many of the youths 
danced and sang in the rain at a concert featuring Christian rock music 
stars. Campus Crusade for Christ's Josh McDowell and other speakers 
urged the teens to be faithful to their commitment and future mates. 
...At the White House, a delegation of about 150 teens, sporting white 
ribbons pinned to their T-shirts, listened as President Clinton read 
prepared remarks. There is a limit to what the government can do to 
influence people's conduct, he said. It is far more important for 
Americans to govern their own behavior through a sense of morality, he 
said, praising the teens for deciding to abstain from premarital sex. 
Southern Baptist organizer Richard Ross said the youths found Clinton's 
remarks interesting, but were disappointed that no time was left for 
them to talk with him. Some in the group wanted to discuss condom 
distribution in schools, The Washington Post reported. 

"The hosts of hell are as mad as hell because youth are here lifting up 
the name of Jesus and shaming Satan," declared Pastor Bernice King of 
Atlanta's Greater Rising Star Baptist Church. Her greetings prompted a 
chorus of cheers from the more than 35,000 mostly high schoolers at the 
five-day triennial National Youth Gathering of the Evangelical Lutheran 
Church in America in Atlanta last month. King is the youngest daughter 
of the late Martin Luther King Jr. About 8,000 of the young people 
spent afternoons helping out in 44 ministries and aid agencies 
throughout the Atlanta area, organizers said. An interactive video 
program brought the teens together each morning for Bible study in 22 
hotels throughout the area. 
...A revival tent was set up in the convention center's exhibition 
hall, and thousands flocked to optional afternoon meetings. There were 
oldtime hymns, sermons, and altar calls, said youth minister David 
Delaney of Roanoke, Va., an organizer of the event. Those responding to 
the invitations to become proclaimers of the gospel were given five 
flat nails as reminders of the sufferings of Christ. They were 
instructed to give them to others and explain their meaning. "They gave 
out 10,000 nails around Atlanta," Delaney told NIRR. 

A standing-room-only crowd of 52,000 men at the University of 
Colorado's Folsom Stadium in Boulder brought to 230,000 the number of 
men attending this year's six-city Promise Keepers men's conferences 
(NIRR 6/13), organizers said. 

Membership has dropped below 1 million in the Christian Church 
(Disciples of Christ) for the first time in the 20th century, church 
officials announced. The denomination, which reported 961,268 members 
at the end of 1993, was founded in 1832 in Lexington, Ky. 

Only 26% of 1992 tax returns listed deductions for charitable 
contributions, according to a Chronicle of Philanthropy analysis of 
Internal Revenue Service data. Those taxpayers reported donations of 
$63.4 billion -almost two-thirds of the $99.2 billion the American 
Association of FundRaising Counsel Trust for Philanthropy estimates was 
given to charity by individuals that year, COP reported in its July 26 
issue. State by state, taxpayers in Utah led in per-capita giving 
($485), in giving the largest share of per-capita income (3.1%), and in 
having the largest average amount among returns listing charitable 
contributions ($3,871). District of Columbia residents placed second 
with $459, 1.6%, and $3,110, respectively. Analysts attributed the 
strong showings to large committed church populations. 
...Other findings: Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and Maryland were 
next highest in percentage of per-capita income donated. West Virginia 
residents gave the least ($105). Tennessee was third highest in 
contributions per return claiming charitable contributions ($3,109); 
New Hampshire, Maine, Vermont, and Rhode Island ranked lowest. 

The U.S. Senate approved legislation ordering the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission to drop religion from proposed guidelines that 
define unlawful harassment in the workplace. Curiously, the Senate also 
said that any new guidelines on religious harassment must ensure that 
symbols or expressions of religious belief are not restricted and 
cannot be used to prove harassment. The measure was added as an 
amendment to an appropriations bill and sent to the House-Senate 
conference committee considering the bill. Under the House version of 
the bill, the EEOC is prohibited from spending money to enforce the 
proposed guidelines as originally worded by the agency. The EEOC is 
drafting a revised version. "The Senate measure was overkill," the 
Christian Legal Society's Steven McFarland said. "We need religious 
harassment guidelines to protect believers and unbelievers alike." 

The first American has been named to the Salvation Army's top 
international leadership position. Gen. Paul Rader, territorial 
commander for the Salvation Army U.S.A.'s western region, took the helm 
of the Londonbased organization last month. An evangelistic holiness 
denomination that emphasizes social welfare work and operates along 
paramilitary lines, the Salvation Army was founded in London in 1865 by 
William Booth. It was introduced to the United States in 1880. Rader, 
60, the 15th person to hold the top post, has degrees from Southern 
Baptist Seminary and Fuller Seminary. He is the son of Salvation Army 
officers and comes from a family long involved in evangelism. 

A priest who does not believe God exists was dismissed by his Anglican 
bishop. Eric Kemp, bishop of Chichester, England, said he had allowed 
the priest, Anthony Freeman, 48, to remain in his parish one year "in 
hope he would move back from that extreme position, but he hasn't." 
Freeman has written in a book: "There is nothing out there -- or if 
there is, we can have no knowledge of it." Sixty-five of his fellow 
clerics protested his dismissal in a letter published in a major daily 
newspaper. They said the decision "reverses a long Church of England 
tradition that tolerates and values a wide range of views." Freeman 
directed post-ordination training prior to his 12-month probation. In 
his final sermon, he denied that he is an atheist. He said there should 
be room in the church for different ideas about the ways in which God 
exists. 

Biblical inerrancy will be a basis for future hiring of faculty at the 
4,000-student Southwestern Baptist Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, new 
president Ken Hemphill, 46, told reporters after his unanimous election 
July 28. Trustees described him as a scholar with a pastor's heart. 
Hemphill has headed a Southern Baptist Convention church-growth center 
since 1992. Before that, he was pastor of First Baptist Church, 
Norfolk, Va., where, in 11 years, membership grew from 1,000 to nearly 
7,000. 
...Among the headaches awaiting Hemphill is the issue of Southwestern's 
accreditation status. The Association of Theological Schools notified 
the seminary it must explain why it should not be placed on probation. 
ATS reportedly stated concerns about institutional integrity, freedom 
from external harassment, academic freedom, evaluation processes for 
president and faculty, and fiscal integrity. The notice was prompted by 
the firing in March of Russell Dilday as president in a confrontation 
with trustees, sources said (NIRR 6/27). 
...Dilday, 63, was hired by Baylor University last month to teach 
homiletics at the new George W. Truett Seminary and to serve as a 
special assistant to the university president. Truett, founded as a 
moderate response to the conservative resurgence in the SBC, is 
scheduled to begin classes this fall in temporary facilities at nearby 
First Baptist Church in Waco, Texas. 

Ecclesiastical disobedience in Grand Rapids, Mich.: A leading regional 
unit of the 225,000-member Christian Reformed Church in North America 
voted "in principle" to defy a decision of the denomination's synod. 
The synod, by a vote of 95-89, declared in June that Scripture bars 
women from the ordained ministry (NIRR 7/11), and that such ordinations 
are a violation of church law. It also urged congregations served by 
ordained women to release them by June 1, 1995, and not to ordain any 
more. Last month, Classis Grand Rapids East voted to allow its 15 
churches to decide whether the word "male" in church law "is operative 
in their particular settings." Five of the 15 CRC churches that have 
ordained women elders are in the area governed by the classis. All five 
said they will refuse to release the women, Reformed Believers Press 
Service said. Other churches indicated they may ordain women, too. 
First Christian Reformed Church called and hosted the special classis 
meeting. Many CRC executives and most professors at CRC-related Calvin 
College belong to churches in the classis. 
..."It is a solemn decision for a body in the Reformed and Presbyterian 
tradition to advise ecclesiastical disobedience," retired Calvin 
professor Henry Beversluis said. "We have got to teach respect for law 
and order.... We must be ready, as Martin Luther King was, to suffer 
the consequences," he added. 

RE-Imagining may prove to be a "gift from God," said James Heidinger 
II, of Wilmore, Ky., editor and executive secretary of Good News, the 
unofficial evangelical caucus in the United Methodist Church. The 
church is talking about theology, and "we are being forced to think 
doctrine again," he said. Heidinger was one of several speakers at last 
month's annual Good News "Summer Celebration" who portrayed last 
November's ecumenical RE-Imagining women's conference in Minneapolis 
(NIRR 6/13) as a symptom of what's wrong in the church. Nearly 500 
people from 30 states and Canada attended the three-day event in 
suburban Dallas. 
...United Methodist Bishop William Lewis of Fargo, N.D., challenged 
Good News to identify any church members who worship the goddess 
Sophia. He promised to pay the group $100 for each name and address. 
His challenge appears as a letter to the editor in the current issue of 
Good News, the caucus' bimonthly publication. Because the conference 
program paid homage to Sophia, the personification of the biblical 
concept of wisdom, critics accused participants of pagan goddess 
worship. Lewis implied that increased fund raising might be the main 
reason behind the Good News assault on RE-Imagining. Editors denied the 
suggestion. 

Eighteen Episcopal bishops said the final draft of a proposed pastoral 
statement on sexuality is too vague on important issues, lacks biblical 
perspective, and ignores past actions of the church's policy-making 
body, the General Convention. The statement is to be presented to this 
year's convention, which opens late this month in Indianapolis. The 18 
active and retired prelates from several Midwest and Southwest states 
circulated a response to the draft and invited fellow bishops to sign 
it. It emphasizes the importance of chastity, defines marriage from a 
biblical perspective, affirms "absolute faithfulness" as a mandate for 
marriage partners, and declares premarital or homosexual relations 
cannot be condoned by the church. It also counsels "tolerance and 
loving pastoral care" for those who fail to maintain chastity. But, it 
adds, "neither the church nor its bishops have the authority to 
compromise in principle, or give approval in practice, to standards 
less or other than our God has given us." 
...The final draft disapproves of ordaining active homosexuals, but 
approves of "chaste, faithful, and committed lifelong unions between 
mature adults." It may be amended in Indianapolis, or minority reports 
may be included, officials said. 

Help from fellow Christians stopped the National Organization for Women 
from padlocking and selling an evangelical church's buildings and 
property. New Covenant Church in Pompano Beach, Fla., a charismatic 
congregation with Presbyterian roots, deposited $210,000 into an escrow 
account while it appeals a court decision, pastor George Callahan said. 
The money was donated or loaned by Christians around the country. The 
case began in March 1989, when church members picketed an abortion 
clinic. Callahan and his board allowed Operation Rescue to rent the 
church building for a rally. Shortly afterward, some of those at the 
rally, including the pastor, conducted a sit-in at the clinic. The 
clinic, assisted by NOW, filed suit, alleging that the demonstrators 
conspired to violate patients' rights, harass and intimidate patients 
and staff, and bankrupt the clinic. The court awarded a judgment of $1. 
...But NOW sued the church under the federal Racketeering Influenced 
and Corrupt Organization Act, and won a judgment of $234,000. The 
clinic's lawyer agreed to settle for $200,000, but the church didn't 
have the cash. Last month, the lawyer began proceedings to seize the 
church buildings and other assets, including Sunday offerings. The 
judge agreed to delay the forfeiture if the church could deposit the 
money plus $10,000 interest in escrow. The case attracted attention 
from rights monitors, and Jay Sekulow of the American Center for Law 
and Justice said his group will help defend the church. 

Most pro-life leaders quickly condemned the killings at an abortion 
clinic in Pensacola, Fla. Many faxed statements to the media denouncing 
violence. Representatives of at least 14 religious and other pro-life 
groups held a news conference in Washington, D.C., to condemn violence 
and to affirm respect for all life. Violent protesters "are not 
pro-life," said Myrna Gutierrez of Americans United for Life. Several 
leaders acknowledged privately that the killings have hurt the 
movement. 
...Not all pro-life leaders were as inclined to censure Paul Hill, the 
man charged with the deaths of abortion doctor John Britton and his 
escort, James Barrett. Don Treshman of Rescue America told The New York 
Times that a new civil war may have begun. He was quoted as saying: "Up 
to now, the killings have been on one side, with 30 million dead babies 
and hundreds of dead and maimed mothers. On the other side, there are 
two dead doctors. Maybe the balance is going to start to shift." 
...Justifiable homicide as a means to stop abortion was debated at a 
prolife summit Hill attended in Chicago three months ago. For months, 
he had proclaimed his support for that view, and some participants went 
to the meeting to confront him. But Hill said little, several recalled. 
Most participants denounced violence as a means to stop abortions. But 
a few supported Hill, creating a divisive climate in a movement long 
known for its unity, Joseph Scheidler of Pro-Life Action League told 
reporters. 
...Hill, 40, started in the Presbyterian Church in America. He 
graduated from Bellhaven College and Reformed Seminary (M. Div. 1983), 
in Jackson, Miss. He was ordained in the PCA in 1984 and pastored two 
churches in South Carolina. He switched credentials to the Orthodox 
Presbyterian Church and took the pulpit of an OPC church in Lake Worth, 
Fla., in 1989. He was removed a year later after clashes with the 
elders on several matters, including his views on abortion, sources 
said. His OPC credentials were lifted in 1992. Hill then moved to 
Pensacola and worked as an auto restorer. He and his family attended 
independent Trinity Presbyterian Church in nearby Valparaiso. 
...Hill became more extreme in his views, his friends say, after 
physician David Gunn (NIRR 3/21) was shot to death by demonstrator 
Michael Griffin outside another Pensacola abortion clinic last year. 
Days later, Hill went on Phil Donahue's TV show and said the homicide 
was justifiable. Elders at Trinity, disturbed by his views and unable 
to convince him to moderate them, excommunicated Hill in June 1993, 
according to Michael Schneider, a PCA minister. Hill began holding 
services in his home. Meanwhile, he had founded Defensive Action, an 
anti-abortion group, and often demonstrated outside clinics. Workers 
say he was not demonstrating, but appeared to be stalking Britton. 

Italy's plunging birth rate reached an all-time low last year, a 
government statistics institute said. Some 538,000 babies were born in 
1993, the lowest number recorded since the founding of modern Italy in 
1870, and 60,000 fewer than in 1992. Italian couples are having fewer 
children, doctors say, because of financial constraints and use of 
inexpensive birth control -- in spite of church teaching against it in 
the predominantly Catholic country. "Selfishness has prevailed....The 
joy of giving life has been extinguished," the Vatican newspaper 
lamented. 

Church opposition helped defeat a bill in Ontario, Canada, that would 
have redefined spousal and marital status to include homosexual 
couples. The proposal had passed a preliminary reading, however, the 
Catholic Church and the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada mobilized to 
contact legislators. Constituents flooded provincial offices with 
thousands of calls, faxes, and letters, Christian Week reported. The 
bill was tabled by a vote of 6859. Don Cousens, a conservative 
legislator and Presbyterian minister, told CW that lawmakers voted 
against the bill because of "very forceful" arguments from the church. 

India's Parliament passed a law to prevent doctors from telling 
parents-to-be the sex of their fetuses. The action was taken to help 
stem the widespread abortion of females. Violators face three years in 
prison, a fine of more than $3,000, and suspension from the medical 
profession. No national statistics are available for abortions of 
female fetuses or for female infanticide, which is practiced in some 
tribal regions. However, the last census showed that the number of 
females per 1,000 males declined from 934 to 929 between 1981 and 1991. 

"Science and religion are cousins" that search for the truth in 
different ways but "have much to say to each other," said John 
Polkinghorne. A physicist and president of Queens College in Cambridge, 
England, Polkinghorne addressed 400 international scholars, scientists, 
theologians, writers, and artists July 10-23 at the third triennial 
C.S. Lewis Summer Institute there. In workshops, lectures, and 
discussions, world-class astronomers, physicists, biologists, 
theologians, and philosophers joined those in the literary, visual, and 
performing arts to address the theme "Cosmos and Creation: Chance or 
Dance?" 
...Cambridge '94 was unlike any conference they had ever attended, 
participants said. Academics from a variety of disciplines represented 
a broad spectrum of contrasting views. Lecture topics included 
fundamentalism, the Big Bang, and Darwinism. Debate centered on 
creation of the universe and the activity of God in the contemporary 
world. 

Seven evangelical non-profit groups must return $500,000 contributed by 
a Chicago man who was later convicted of swindling his investors, a 
federal district court in Chicago ruled. A lawyer for six of the 
organizations said they will appeal. 
...The case involves money siphoned from four companies by Michael 
Douglas between 1987 and 1989. He is serving a 12-year prison sentence 
for the $30 million fraud. A court-appointed receiver filed suit to 
return the donations. The receiver, Chicago lawyer Stephen Scholes, 
contended that the nonprofits, like Douglas' other beneficiaries, 
received money that belonged to his creditors and investors. The 
charities, which spent the money by the time the suit was filed, argued 
that this would set a dangerous legal precedent. They said they knew 
nothing about Douglas' illegal activities, and cannot investigate every 
donor's background before accepting contributions. They also said it 
would be unfair to be required to raise new funds, in effect asking 
donors to pay for the wrongdoing of another donor. 
...The judgment affects these organizations: African Enterprise, 
Monrovia, Calif. ($166,000); Bethany Evangelical Free Church, 
Clintonville, Wis. ($26,000); Heart Cry International, Round Lake 
Beach, Ill. ($12,485); Hindustan Bible Institute, Union Mills, N.C. 
($74,989); International Students, Inc., Colorado Springs ($120,450); 
Proclamation International, Pensacola, Fla. ($51,228); and World Vision 
International, Monrovia, Calif. ($57,500). 
...Scholes already has collected nearly $560,000 from 11 other churches 
and charities he sued, The Chronicle of Philanthropy reported. Six 
other nonprofits agreed to pay $80,550 without suits being filed. 

Publisher Alfred A. Knopf confirmed that it has agreed to pay Pope John 
Paul II a $9 million advance for his book, Crossing the Threshold of 
Hope. Insiders were quoted as saying there is concern about whether the 
firm can recoup the amount. 

Secret meetings between the Vatican envoy to Mexico and two at-large 
Tijuana drug traffickers have the country in an uproar. Bishop Jeronimo 
Prigione acknowledged last month that he had arranged to have a Tijuana 
priest transport the pair, Ramon and Benjamin Arellano, secretly from 
Tijuana to Mexico City for meetings last December and January. The 
brothers are leaders of Mexico's biggest drug cartel, suspected in the 
killing of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo at the Guadalajara 
airport in May 1993. The government, which is offering a $2 million 
reward for their capture, says the killers mistook the prelate for 
their intended victim, a rival drug lord. They also are under 
indictment in the United States for smuggling drugs. They reportedly 
denied involvement in the shooting of the cardinal. One of the brothers 
said he was at the christening service of his godson at the time, and 
that the Tijuana priest can vouch for him. 
...Politicians, business and labor leaders, and newspaper editorialists 
have called on Prigione to reveal details of the meetings or leave his 
post. He replied that as a Catholic official he is not obliged to 
divulge such information. He said the brothers did not tell him 
anything the government does not already know. Prigione huddled with 
government and church officials late last month to discuss the affair. 
He said he will resign only if the pope orders him to do so. 

Israel recognized Jordan's "special role" in administering and 
preserving Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem. The agreement was part of 
the historic non-belligerence pact signed by Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin and Jordan's King Hussein during their summit at the 
White House last month. White House officials said Israel and Jordan 
made the decision without American intervention. President Clinton, 
flanked by the leaders at the signing ceremony, lauded it as a step to 
peace in the Middle East. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said it 
was proper that Jordan's long-standing responsibility for maintaining 
the sites be acknowledged. 
...The agreement infuriated leaders of the Palestinian Liberation 
Organization. PLO chairman Yasser Arafat said that oversight of the 
holy places "is the jurisdiction of the Palestinians." Arafat has 
pledged to establish a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its 
capital. Israel captured East Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan 
in the 1967 Six-Day War, and has vowed never to relinquish territorial 
control of its united capital. However, Rabin last year agreed to give 
the PLO administrative control of the West Bank and Gaza. Seeking to 
defuse the dispute, Jordan said it supports the PLO's campaign to gain 
political sovereignty over East Jerusalem. That goal does not clash 
with Jordan's custody of Muslim sites there, officials said. Arafat 
dispatched a team last week to negotiate an understanding with Hussein. 

Pakistan's blasphemy laws are being used to terrorize religious 
minorities and must be changed (NIRR 5/2), London-based Amnesty 
International said. Hundreds of Pakistanis -mostly Christians and 
members of the outlawed Ahmedi Islamic sect -- are in jail as 
violators, news sources reported. Others branded as blasphemers have 
been attacked by vigilantes. Violators of the laws can be punished by 
death, and in its report, AI documents some of the deaths. 
...In Dhaka, Bangladesh, tens of thousands of people poured into the 
streets to demand a strict anti-blasphemy law and the death of Taslima 
Nasrin. The fugitive physician-writer allegedly called for revision of 
the Koran to gain better treatment for women (NIRR 7/11). Government 
officials said a blasphemy act would push the country back to feudal 
times. Protest leaders warned they will try to topple the government if 
their wishes are not met. 

Religious art work by home school children can be included in a public 
mural at the California Center for the Arts, officials in Escondido, 
Calif., said, reversing an earlier decision. The dispute began when 
officials invited children to enter art tiles for the display, 
requiring a $5 entry fee. However, they declined to accept tiles from 
seven home school children because they contained religious symbols. 
The city reversed its position after Rutherford Institute attorney Brad 
Dacus questioned the constitutionality of the decision. "Whenever the 
government opens up a forum for expression, it cannot discriminate 
against individuals solely because of their religious beliefs," Dacus 
said. That would be "open and blatant hostility to religion," he said. 

Prayer in school was an issue in the U.S. Senate. Voted down 53-47 was 
an amendment to an education act proposed by Sen. Jesse Helms (RN.C.). 
It would have denied funds to any public school system that prohibits 
voluntary prayer in public schools. The senators then agreed, 93-7, to 
an amendment by Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.). It would cut off the 
federal funds only if a federal court finds a school district 
"willfully violated" a court order to allow constitutionally protected 
prayer. 
...Although the Senate voted 6336 to cut off federal funds to any 
public school district that teaches acceptance of homosexuality as a 
lifestyle, the amendment faced an uncertain outcome in the House-Senate 
conference committee. The proposal by Helms and Sen. Bob Smith (R-N.H.) 
was sparked by constituents who brought the senators sample materials 
used in schools, aides told reporters. It would apply whether federal 
money is used for such purposes direct or indirectly. However, another 
amendment was passed 99-0 that conflicts with the Helms-Smith measure. 
Introduced by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), it would cut funding to 
any schools that encourage sexual activity, whether homosexual or 
heterosexual, and only if federal funds were used directly to do so. 
Most public schools receive about 15% of their financing from the 
federal government, analysts say. Earlier, the House passed a measure 
similar to, but less stringent than, the HelmsSmith proposal. 
House-Senate conferees are expected to hammer out a compromise version. 

Israeli schools will begin teaching Conservative and Reform Judaism, 
Israel's education minister announced. The policy reverses years of 
teaching only Orthodox doctrine and further reduces the influence of 
the country's Orthodox rabbinate. The rabbinate controls marriage, 
divorce, and other policies governing civilian life. Courts recently 
have recognized non-Orthodox conversions to Judaism, and have mandated 
the inclusion of Conservative and Reform Judaism in government funding. 

Religion classes should be dropped from Quebec's public schools, the 
Quebec Teachers Federation urged in a resolution. The QTF also 
recommended abolishing the division of schools by religious categories. 
Public schools in the largely French-speaking province are divided into 
Catholic and Protestant categories, and are supported, subsidized, 
supervised, and controlled by the provincial government. For centuries, 
until the 1960s, the Catholic Church ran the French Catholic school 
system on behalf of the government. 
...References to religion could be made in the context of history 
lessons or discussions about cultural differences, the QTF said. This 
approach already is taken by most of the Protestant schools, according 
to published sources. The 126,000-member QTF is the largest teacher's 
federation in the overwhelmingly Catholic province. Most of its high 
school and elementary school members work in French Catholic schools. 
...The QTF stand complements an independent move to divide schools 
along linguistic lines (French and English) rather than religious ones. 
Many of the Catholic school boards have vowed to fight such proposals. 
A recent study found that 85% of French-speaking Quebecers want their 
children to receive religious instruction in school, Religious News 
Service noted. 

Six in 10 physically disabled believers feel their congregation does "a 
lot" (36%) or "some" (25%) to make it easier for them to participate in 
religious activities, a survey by Louis Harris and Associates found. 
However, 25% of respondents said their congregation does "not much" 
(9%) or "nothing" to aid participation. On church and synagogue 
attendance, 36% said they attend once a week or more (versus 43% of 
people without disabilities), 49% reported attending at least monthly 
(compared with 58% of people without disabilities), and 39% said they 
never attend. Younger disabled people (ages 16-24) and seniors between 
65 and 74 were more likely to attend than others. Among those who 
attend services, 55% said the attitudes of other worshipers encourage 
their attendance. Only 3% felt others discouraged their attendance. The 
survey was sponsored by the National Organization on Disability. Mary 
Jane Owen, executive director of the National Catholic Office for 
Persons with Disabilities, said most dioceses have their own disability 
offices. Increasingly, they are being expanded, she said. 
...When people with disabilities are looked upon as untapped resources 
for the church, rather than liabilities, then churches and the disabled 
both will benefit, said Kathy Reeves, who oversees UMC disability 
ministries. oversees UMC disability ministries.

An outreach to Hispanics in connection with the World Cup soccer 
playoffs attracted 3,000 to the campus of East Los Angeles College July 
16, organizers reported. The daylong fete, billed as "L.A. Celebraci 
n," featured a number of well-known Hispanic gospel singers and 
performers. Participants cheered when Hugo Perez, a starting striker 
(forward) for the U.S. World Cup team, showed up to tell of his faith 
in Christ. Evangelist Nicky Cruz preached, and scores of attendees -- 
including some teary-eyed street gang leaders -- walked the aisle to 
indicate they received Christ, said Steve Quatro of Sports Outreach Los 
Angeles, who helped coordinate the event. More than 50 churches of 
various denominations cooperated in the celebration, and participants 
represented nine Spanish-speaking nationalities, he said. 
...Celebraci n capped a series of evangelistic efforts in World Cup 
playoff cities around the country (NIRR 6/27). Across Los Angeles, 
churches sponsored some 35 soccer clinics, World Cup game parties, 
youth evangelism teams, literature distribution, and hospitality 
centers and services for overseas guests. One important results is that 
churches learned how to take advantage of high-profile opportunities to 
reach out in creative ways, Quatro said. 

A harvest of souls is waiting in the pews, but the church needs to 
change some of its practices, pollster George Barna told the North 
American Conference for Itinerant Evangelists (NIRR 7/11). Most 
Christians still use the King James version of the Bible, which he said 
requires 12thgrade reading skills, but 49% of adults older than 25 
can't read at an 8th-grade level, Barna's figures show. A million high 
school graduates last year lacked a 2nd-grade reading ability, he 
added. 
...Evangelistic outreaches should target specific audiences, Barna also 
said. Intergenerational conflicts and differing values mean that a 
meeting that reaches one segment of society often will miss another. 
For example, it is rare that one meeting will appeal to both baby 
boomers and baby busters, he said. 

Baby boomers show signs of attending church less after they move into 
their empty-nest stage, according to research by sociologist David 
Roozen of the interdenominational Hartford Seminary. Using data from 
1990, for example, he found that 53% of older boomers with preteen 
children reported attending church three times a week or more. However, 
just 37% of people born between 1946 and 1955 with children no longer 
at home said they attended church regularly. At the same time, their 
children are at a stage where many experiment and leave organized 
religion, as their parents did in the late 1960s and 1970s, he noted. 
...As a result, churches and synagogues will face considerable pressure 
to fill their pews in the next two decades, Roozen warned in his study, 
Empty Nest, Empty Pew: The Boomers Continue Through the Life Cycle. 
"It's something that needs to be taken seriously, particularly within 
old-line Protestantism," he told The Associated Press. But many older 
people stay in churches for community and friendships. The same holds 
true for older boomers as well, said another expert on boomers and 
religion, sociologist Dean Hoge of Catholic University. 

Over 144,000 people thronged this month to Anaheim Stadium for a 
three-day Greg Laurie Harvest Crusade, the fifth consecutive year it 
has been held. The mostly youthful participants sang and danced in the 
aisles to the music of Ricky Skaggs, Deniece Williams, the Maranatha 
Praise Band, and others. Some 534 congregations helped plan the crusade 
and supplied 2,800 volunteer counselors, according to organizers. They 
said that about 12,600 responded to Laurie's calls to commit their 
lives to Christ. Respondents received literature and were to be 
contacted by local churches. Harvest also teamed up with Canning Hunger 
Ministries and The Salvation Army for a food drive at the stadium that 
collected enough food to feed 30,000 families, a Harvest Crusade news 
release said. 
...A Kids' Crusade Saturday morning saw about 1,800 of the 16,000 
attending respond to an invitation to receive Christ, organizers said. 
The 90-minute extravaganza of music, choreography, and children's 
characters featured Psalty the Singing Songbook, singer and children's 
author Mary Rice Hopkins, and a 1,700voice children's choir. 
...Nearly 1 million people have attended Harvest Crusades since 1989 in 
California, Arizona, Washington, and New Mexico, the release noted 
(NIRR 7/26/93). Other meetings are planned this year for San Diego and 
Sacramento, Calif., Honolulu, and Albuquerque. Laurie, 41, a convert 
from the Jesus movement era, is pastor of the 12,000-member Harvest 
Christian Fellowship in Riverside, Calif., one of the largest churches 
in the United States. 

One of the largest groups of Christian missionaries ever to be sent out 
at one time -- 265 people -- will begin ministering in the former 
Soviet Union. A ceremony for workers in The CoMission (NIRR 3/7), 
planned for Aug. 3-4 at Olivet Nazarene University in Kankakee, Ill., 
will include a four-hour conference for volunteers and a blessing 
service. The missionaries will spend a year in Russia or a neighboring 
republic exposing public school educators to a course on Christian 
ethics and morality, conducting community Bible studies, and discipling 
new believers. Counting the latest group, more than 700 missionaries 
have traveled to the former Soviet Union under the auspices of The 
CoMission's five-year project, which will end in December 1997. 

In spite of growing civil unrest, Orthodox, Protestant, and Catholic 
leaders from throughout the former Soviet Union and the Baltic States 
have taken an unprecedented step toward forging closer relations. More 
than 100 delegates held three days of talks in Moscow last month, 
according to Ecumenical Press Service. The group denounced the use of 
religion for "fanning up conflicts." Religious justification for 
violence is "a sin against the Lord and the Gospel," the group's 
statement said. Chairmen of the conference were Metropolitan Kirill of 
the Russian Orthodox Church, Petr Konovalchik of the Union of 
Evangelical Christians-Baptists of the Russian Federation, and 
Archbishop Tadeusz Kondrusevic of the Catholic Church. 
...The delegates agreed to establish a forum to coordinate peace-making 
initiatives and resolve "inter-confessional problems." Recently 
established religious bodies will be denied membership in the 
ecumenical forum. Ioann Mirolyubov of the Latvian Old Believers' Church 
spoke of foreign proselytizing missionaries and New Age cults as being 
"an invasion into others' cultural space." 

 Russian dictator Vladimir Lenin ordered 70,000 churches destroyed as 
part of his "enormous fanatic belief in the Communist Utopia," claims a 
Russian historian who studied once-secret files. Dmitry Volkogonov, a 
retired general and senior military adviser to President Boris Yeltsin, 
called his Lenin the first honest book about the leader. The author's 
views would have been considered treasonous a decade ago. Volkogonov, 
66, a former Soviet Army propaganda chief, once considered Lenin a god, 
and still finds it painful to reassess the Soviet founder. He said he 
frequently receives insulting or threatening phone calls, and estimates 
that tens of millions of people remain loyal to Lenin. 

Persecution of Christians in Uzbekistan has increased. Citing a statute 
that says churches cannot meet in public buildings, police evicted a 
Russian charismatic church and two Korean churches from their meeting 
places in Tashkent, capital of the Central Asian republic. No such 
statute exists, a foreign diplomat was told by the Committee for 
Religious Affairs. News Network International reported that a Tashkent 
evangelist was tortured and interned in a mental institution after 
police warned him to stop showing Jesus in public. The film has been 
limited to private showings since 1990 when Muslim extremists 
demonstrated against it. In April, the government threatened Christian 
and other non-Muslim groups with loss of legal status if they 
evangelized Muslims or distributed literature in the Uzbek language. 

Chinese authorities ordered new controls on religious activity in a 
Muslim-dominated region of Ningxia province, the official Xinhua news 
agency reported. Some clerics "were using the cloak of religion to 
meddle unduly in education, marriage, and family planning," a religious 
affairs spokesman was quoted as saying. He said that more than 2,000 
mosques, temples, and churches had been opened in the province over the 
past 10 years, creating a demand for more clergy, who increasingly have 
been involved in government affairs. 
...The new law appears to target both Muslims and Buddhists. It 
requires government approval for opening mosques and temples, forming 
religious organizations, and publishing religious books, pictures, or 
video or audio tapes. Foreigners are permitted to take part in services 
in approved mosques and temples, but they may not form religious groups 
or schools, nor may they proselytize for new members, appoint 
clergymen, or preach, Xinhua reported. Official figures place the 
rapidly growing Muslim population of the province at 1.6 million out of 
a total population of 4.9 million. Xinhua indicated that the Buddhist 
and Catholic populations also were expanding. 

East Timor has become "hell," says the former Portuguese colony's 
Catholic bishop. Bishop Carlos Filipe Belo blames the Indonesian 
government for its arrests and constant intimidation of Christians, and 
for spreading Islam among the territory's Catholics. He made the remark 
in an interview with Reuters as mainly Muslim Indonesia marked the 18th 
anniversary of its annexation of East Timor, an action the United 
Nations has refused to recognize. The majority of East Timor's 750,000 
residents are Catholic. Jakarta has denied the claims, but Belo said 
military and police officials head commissions to spread Islam in East 
Timor. Police and Catholic demonstrators have clashed repeatedly since 
troops disrupted a Catholic funeral in 1991, shooting and killing up to 
200. Last month, troops entered a church and disrupted a service, 
residents told the Reuters news agency. 

Insurgent tribesmen in an area of India where many atrocities have 
taken place "confessed their terrible sins" and made decisions for 
Christ. More than 1,000 Naga tribesmen were among the 75,000 who 
responded to an altar call given by Shiwoto Sema, director of Nagaland 
Christian Revival Church. Some 120,000 people from northeast India and 
Myanmar attended the evangelistic service in Kohima, making it one of 
the largest Christian gatherings ever held in the Indian state of 
Nagaland, organizers said. The war-torn area is in the adjacent state 
of Manipur. Northeast India was largely christianized at one time. But 
Naga revolutionaries are trying to take land from Christians, reports 
Lance Thollander of Charlottesville, Va.based Christian Aid Mission. 
Many people have died, and hundreds of churches and homes have been 
burned in uprisings, he said. 

"The demon of sectarianism," if left unchecked, is a threat to "the 
very existence" of Pakistan, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto warned in a 
speech to lawyers and judges in Lahore. The preceding day, two young 
boys were killed by a bomb as they prayed in a Sunni mosque, the latest 
of a series of violent incidents involving mosques. Observers blame 
feuds between militant members of the country's majority Sunni Muslims 
and their rivals among the minority Shiites. 
...Since her re-election last year, Bhutto has been criticized by 
Islamic fundamentalists, despite her efforts to appease them. She has 
covered her head, backed away from promises to repeal strict Islamic 
laws, and named fundamentalists to key posts. This month, 
fundamentalists offered a reward for the death of her law minister 
after he proposed making it a crime to falsely accuse someone of 
insulting Islam. Hundreds of people, including Christians, are in the 
country's jails under a law against blaspheming Islam, The Associated 
Press reported. The law minister said some people have been falsely 
accused to settle personal disputes (NIRR 4/18). 

The world's 10 most severe persecutors of Christians are Saudi Arabia, 
Afghanistan, Sudan, China, Comoro Islands, North Korea, Iran, Egypt, 
Morocco, and Yemen, according to Open Doors with Brother Andrew. All 
the countries except China and North Korea are in the Muslim world, 
where Christians often are subjected to intimidation or persecution. 
...In Saudi Arabia, Christian gatherings, made up mostly of foreign 
workers, must be held in secret, Open Doors indicated. Leaders are 
targeted, beaten, imprisoned, or expelled. Afghanistan has 48,000 
mosques, but not one Christian church building, and open professions of 
Christianity can be fatal. In Sudan, the non-Muslim south has been 
under siege. Attempts to eliminate the Christian presence include 
bombings of church services, mass kidnappings, widespread murders, and 
the destruction of entire villages. In China, house churches are 
pressured severely and there is a tremendous shortage of Bibles. The 
Islamic Republic of the Comoros, made up of islands between Madagascar 
and Mozambique, intensely persecutes its few hundred Christians, Open 
Doors said. 
...In North Korea, the regime is so repressive that little is known 
about the underground church, except that it has survived. Arbitrary 
arrests and Islamic religious education for children have led to 
emigration of large numbers of Christians in Iran. Persecution of the 
Egyptian Coptic Church is growing, including harassment, discriminatory 
laws, and destruction of churches. In Morocco, small groups of 
Christians gather secretly in eight cities, but risk imprisonment if 
discovered. The few thousand Christians in Yemen are mostly foreign 
workers and refugees who have little opportunity for fellowship and are 
under continual pressure, the group said. 

Iran's top judge accused the Iraqbased Mujahideen Khalq opposition 
group of launching a campaign of bombings and assassinations aimed at 
fomenting sectarian conflict. In news reports, Ayatollah Muhammad Yazdi 
said the Mujahideen were behind the killing of two Christian pastors 
(NIRR 7/11), the bombing last month of Iran's holiest Shiite Muslim 
shrine, and other attacks. He said the group wants to kindle civil war 
between the Shiites and majority Sunnis, and between religious 
minorities and the ruling power or the Shiites, "so that the system 
would lose control...." Meanwhile, Iranian TV showed three women who 
had been arrested and accused of being main agents of the Mujahideen. 
Iran's news agency said one had confessed to the killing of Protestant 
leader Tateos Michaelian. 

Discrimination against Copts is common, Pope Shenouda of the Egyptian 
Coptic Church said in a published interview in Cairo. The government 
has often portrayed him as a symbol of harmony between the country's 
largely Muslim populations and the 810 million Copts. But, Shenouda 
told reporters, "national unity" may be an empty slogan. He said Copts 
face obstacles in building or repairing their churches. In a disaster, 
when Copts' homes are destroyed, they do not receive state 
compensation, unlike other victims, he said. Copts all love their 
country, he added, but they no longer participate in the political 
process because they often have trouble receiving voting cards from 
local police stations. 

Liberia's war zone is the site of church planter Edward Kofi's 
evangelistic ministry. He holds crusade meetings, discipleship training 
seminars, and is "encouraging the brethren while we try to rebuild our 
facilities." Many rebel fighters and bloodthirsty warlords have found 
peace in God through the ministry, EP News Service reported. Kofi, who 
started African Christian Fellowship in 1968, said several of his 
missionaries are dead and 60 are missing. His group planted 117 
churches by the time Liberia's civil conflict began in 1989. 

Bulgaria has refused legal status to 24 parachurch organizations, which 
may be forced to cease all public activities. Among the groups denied 
or losing their registrations are Gideons International, Scripture 
Union, and a charity affiliated with the Church of God. Recent changes 
to Bulgaria's Persons and Family Act require non-denominational 
religious organizations to obtain government approval before 
registering. Christo Matanov, head of the Directorate of Religious 
Affairs, told News Network International that the panel would consider 
the rights of religious groups and their "victims." Matanov said he has 
received complaints from parents whose children have been "taken into 
churches, away from family and schools," but did not specify groups 
guilty of these actions. 

Many of the world's Gypsies soon will have access to the entire New 
Testament in their own language. The United Bible Societies is 
completing a translation in Kalderash, the Romani dialect understood by 
the greatest number of Gypsies in central and eastern Europe. Because 
of migrations, at least a dozen distinct dialects have evolved in the 
Romani language. Only portions of the New Testament had been available 
in Kalderash. The Baptist General Association of Virginia will pay for 
a first printing of 2,000 testaments, and Cooperative Baptist 
Fellowship missionaries will arrange distribution. 

If it takes military force to oust Haiti's illegal government, there 
will be no objection from top leaders of the National Council of 
Churches, Joan Brown Campbell, NCC secretary general, indicated. She 
told reporters the NCC keeps in close touch with the Clinton 
administration as well as with exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, 
whom the NCC believes should be returned to power. "It appears that all 
processes of pressure and dialogue" have failed to work, Campbell said. 
In the meantime, "bloodshed and violations against a defenseless 
population continue in ever-increasingly inhumane ways, with the 
silence and complacency of powerful sectors within Haiti." 

Still missing: missionary Raymond Rising, 51. He was working in 
Colombia with the Dallas-based Summer Institute of Linguistics, an arm 
of Wycliffe Bible Translators, when he disappeared March 31 (NIRR 
4/18). He was last seen motorcycling back to Loma Linda, the 40-acre 
Wycliffe jungle base, and has not been heard from since. Co-workers 
assume he was abducted by guerrillas whose rebel movement is known by 
its Spanish initials, FARC. Since the abduction, Wycliffe has increased 
security at Loma Linda, home to 80 families, The Associated Press's Tom 
Ragan reported. Only vehicle travel is permitted after 6:15 p.m., and 
all residents must be in their homes by 11. A garrison of government 
troops guards the base's airstrip, although they would be no match for 
the thousands of rebels in the area, he noted. 
...FARC is demanding $3 million for two New Tribes missionaries 
-Timothy Van Dyke and Stephen Welsh -- kidnapped last January (NIRR 
4/18). New Tribes, based in Sanford, Fla., suspended its work among 
tribal people in Colombia following the abductions. The mission will 
not pay a ransom, spokesman Mel Wyma told Ragan. "If we did, we'd be 
putting every missionary around the world on the market." Three other 
New Tribes missionaries were seized by guerrillas near the Colombia 
border in Panama in January 1993 and still are missing (NIRR 6/13; 
2/22/93). 

Evangelicals took hostage the mayor of San Juan Chamula in the southern 
Mexican state of Chiapas in an ongoing conflict to get back their land 
(NIRR 1/24). A firefight with the mayor's Catholic supporters left two 
dead and several injured. The Catholics, who held several evangelicals 
hostage, swapped captives with the evangelicals. Both groups agreed to 
meet with state and federal officials to settle the conflict. The 
trouble stems from an incident last September, when 584 Indian 
evangelicals were expelled from their homes in San Juan Chamula 
following long-standing differences with large landowners. 

Paid advertising not related to a non-profit organization's purpose can 
appear in its publications mailed at bulk rate, according to an 
appropriations bill approved by the U.S. Senate. Sen. Dennis DeConcini 
(D-Ariz.) sponsored a measure relaxing postal rules that prohibited use 
of third-class rates unless publications included only advertising 
"substantially related" to the group's stated purposes, DM News 
reported. Church and parachurch groups had been concerned about 
increased postage costs (NIRR 6/13). The House version of the 
appropriations bill does not include a similar provision, but 
representatives of both chambers planned to meet to devise a compromise 
measure. 

The FEC has threatened to levy a $250,000 fine against the Forest, 
Va.-based Christian Action Network. The Federal Election Commission 
contends that an anti-Clinton TV ad that CAN aired during the 1992 
presidential campaign violated election law. Tax-exempt groups are 
allowed to discuss or debate issues in an election but are barred by 
law from urging the support or defeat of particular candidates. CAN 
insisted the ad was informational in nature. 
...The group warned in a series of fund-raising letters that it "could 
literally be shut down by the federal government in a matter of days," 
and its president, Martin Mawyer, could be sent to jail. A CAN 
spokesman said negotiations with the FEC had broken down, and that the 
agency was objecting to the fund-raising letters. 

Landlords who refuse to rent apartments to unmarried heterosexual 
couples for religious reasons have a right to do so -- unless the state 
can prove a "compelling interest" to forbid such discrimination, the 
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled. However, the judges voted 
4-3 to return the case to the trial court in order to give the state 
another chance to prove it has a compelling interest that outweighs 
religious exercise rights. 
...The case involves Paul and Ronald Desilets, Catholic co-owners of an 
apartment in Turners Falls, Mass., and an unmarried couple who filed a 
complaint of discrimination (NIRR 1/25/93). The state trial court said 
unlawful discrimination had occurred, but that the commonwealth's 
interest in eradicating marital status discrimination is not 
sufficiently compelling to justify penalizing religious exercise. The 
Desilets were supported in a brief filed by the Christian Legal 
Society's Center for Law and Religious Freedom (CLRF). The National 
Association of Evangelicals, Southern Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists, 
and several Catholic groups joined in the brief. With this decision, 
CLRF's Steven McFarland said, Massachusetts joins several other states 
"in refusing to adopt for their state constitution the U.S. Supreme 
Court's 1990 reasoning that allows the state to burden free exercise of 
religion without a compelling reason." 

School officials cannot bar a volunteer religious club from meeting in 
the afternoon at a junior high school in Ladue, Mo., a U.S. appeals 
court ruled. The decision reversed a lower court ruling. The case stems 
from 1992, when several residents complained about the religious nature 
of the Good News/Good Sports Club. The club met monthly at 3 p.m. so 
participants could ride the last bus home. Ladue school district 
amended its use-of-premises policy to close its facilities  from 3 to 6 
p.m. to all community groups except for scouting and athletic groups. 
It also prohibited any religious content in the scouts' meetings during 
these hours. The court said the policy served no compelling government 
interest and results in viewpoint discrimination. 

A 16-year-old pro-life activist has been arrested 70 times for protests 
at abortion clinics across the country. This month, Jamie Tellier (NIRR 
3/8/93) was sentenced to six months' probation and ordered to perform 
48 hours of community service for a protest at a clinic in Pittsburgh. 
It was her first conviction. She and her mother, who was arrested in 
the same demonstration, moved to suburban Pittsburgh from Texas last 
year, according to news reports. 

America's Catholic bishops formally served notice to Congress that they 
are willing to sacrifice their support for universal health-care 
coverage if abortion services are provided as a benefit. In a letter to 
House Speaker Tom Foley, they warned that "special interest pressures" 
may be "leading Congress to ignore the will of the American people on 
both these essential priorities." But, the bishops said, "compromise 
must not come at the expense of the unborn, the unserved, the 
undocumented, and the uninsured." They said they will fight any bill 
containing such compromise. 
...Like the bishops, religious conservatives are opposed to inclusion 
of publicly funded abortions in any national health plan, but they also 
tend to be cool or even hostile toward universal coverage concepts. 
Jewish and mainline church groups are on record backing both universal 
coverage and inclusion of abortion services. 
...In another letter to Foley, 75 House members said they would not 
support any measure that excludes abortion coverage as a benefit. All 
five bills approved by congressional committees include such coverage. 
They also include conscience clauses that allow hospitals and doctors 
to refuse to perform abortions. The bishops say the clauses are too 
weak and do not prevent the use of taxpayer funds to subsidize 
abortions. 

Americans may be changing their minds about abortion, or at least about 
who should pay for it. A TimeCNN poll this month found 52% of 
respondents opposed a national health care plan that would pay for 
abortions. In a similar survey in May 1993, only 44% were opposed to 
"guaranteed abortions." 

An Ohio township opposes President Clinton's national health plan 
because it would "allow for the killing of life as a basic benefit." 
The three trustees of Munson Township outside of Cleveland, all 
Catholics, voted unanimously to send a formal antiabortion resolution 
to Ohio's senators and other politicians. "Munson Township is a highly 
Christian community," Trustee Ronald Smith said, "and if you are 
Christian, you are opposed to abortion." Jewish residents were quoted 
as denouncing the action. 

Michigan became the fourth state where courts have struck down laws 
that set mandatory waiting periods and require special information for 
women who want abortions. A suburban Detroit judge sided with prochoice 
groups, ruling that Michigan's informed-consent law violates the state 
constitution's protection of privacy. Courts in Massachusetts, 
Kentucky, and Tennessee have struck down similar laws in those states. 
A South Dakota law is on hold pending a court decision there. 
...A federal judge rejected the portion of Michigan's abortion law that 
prevented women who are victims of rape and incest from having a 
publicly funded abortion. U.S. District Judge Benjamin Gibson in 
Detroit said the state law violates federal Medicaid law, which allows 
for federally financed abortions in cases of rape, incest, or life 
endangerment. 

The pro-life plank has got to go, say Govs. Pete Wilson of California 
and Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, both Republicans. They will 
work to remove the abortion-opposition plank from the party's national 
platform. Other GOP officials, including Sen. Arlen Specter of 
Pennsylvania, said the abortion stance is contributing to the image 
that the Republican party is intolerant. 

Toning down their rhetoric: conservative religious Republicans in 
Washington state. To reach unchurched voters, the conservatives formed 
a somewhat shaky alliance with moderate Republicans. They worked 
together closely to craft a platform appealing to mainstream voters. 
The goal was to reverse heavy losses the GOP sustained in a statewide 
shellacking two years ago, the Spokane Spokesman-Review reported. 
...Critics on the right said religious conservatives sold out. Critics 
on the left said it's a smoke screen to mislead voters into accepting a 
farright agenda. The GOP platform, adopted June 25, upholds the 
"sanctity of the unborn" and the principles outlined in two anti-gay 
rights initiates proposed for the November ballot. Doug Burman, 
architect of the anti-gay rights campaign, told the Spokesman-Review he 
would rather convince people on the issues than divide them with talk 
of religion. 

New groups are emerging to combat religious conservatives. One, the 
Interfaith Alliance, will not endorse candidates or take positions on 
specific public policy issues, said spokesman Herbert Valentine, a past 
ministerial moderator of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). Instead, the 
alliance will counter religious conservatives' claims that equate their 
positions with authentic Christianity while dismissing opponents as 
secularists, he indicated. "We especially deplore the suggestion that 
to be fully franchised one must not only be Christian, but espouse a 
particular understanding of the life of Christ," National Council of 
Churches General Secretary Joan Brown Campbell said at a Washington 
news conference announcing the Alliance. Valentine named such groups as 
the Christian Coalition, the Oregon Citizens Alliance, and the 
Traditional Values Coalition as part of "the radical religious right." 
They have a "dangerous political agenda" and "pose a serious threat to 
the American principles of tolerance and liberty," he alleged. 

Lauding separation of church and state, Protestant and Jewish leaders 
issued a four-page manifesto declaring their commitment to the concept. 
The group offered guidelines for the role religion should play in the 
political life of the nation. Signed by some 80 individuals and 
organizations, the statement was handed to Vice President Al Gore at a 
White House ceremony by Rabbi James Rudin of the American Jewish 
Committee and James Dunn, a leader of the so-called moderate faction of 
Southern Baptists. The signers said they "share a vision that avoids 
both the theocratic tendencies on the one side [of the separation 
issue] and the hostility toward religion associated with the other." 
They strongly criticized groups that call America a Christian nation or 
that characterize their opponents "as sinful or ungodly." 
...The manifesto was issued a week after the July 5 appearance in USA 
Today of a full-page ad by the American Center for Law and Justice. The 
ad compared the current status of the separation of church and state to 
the Berlin Wall. It warned of "a new wall of oppression and 
intolerance," and cautioned that America may be facing a "religious 
cleansing." 

Political correctness suffered another defeat at Carnegie-Mellon 
University in Pittsburgh. Recent grad Mark Mooney, 21, a Catholic (NIRR 
4/18), won his second battle against the school after running afoul of 
homosexual activists three years ago. In 1991, the school fired Mooney 
from his resident assistant job when he walked out of a sensitivity 
training seminar rather than wear a button displaying a symbol of the 
homosexual-rights movement, as CMU required. Mooney filed a lawsuit, 
and last month the school settled the case out of court. Participants 
were barred from disclosing details of the settlement, but student 
affairs dean Michael Murphy acknowledged to reporters that "it's not 
appropriate that anybody be asked to declare a belief he doesn't hold." 
Mooney, who earlier was cleared of disciplinary charges involving a 
run-in with campus homosexuals, noted that the school has not 
apologized for any of its actions. However, he said, as a result of the 
litigation, the Campus Interfaith Council is working with the 
university to ensure that the religious beliefs of all students are 
respected in the training of resident assistants. 

A San Diego judge ordered the Boy Scouts of America to pay $5,000 to a 
police officer who alleged that he was ousted as the leader of an 
Explorer post because he was homosexual. The judge said the Scouts are 
a business establishment, and under California law businesses are 
barred from such discrimination. 

Mel White conducted a weeklong "fast for understanding" in front of 
Focus on the Family headquarters in Colorado. The former ghostwriter 
for leading evangelicals (NIRR 8/9/93), who announced in 1991 he is 
gay, said he targeted Focus and its founder, James Dobson, because they 
lead a "war of disinformation" against homosexuals. Focus' radio 
programs, articles, and books cause gays and lesbians "long-term 
suffering, self-loathing, and even death," White charged. 
...White spent the week in a motor home on public property, where he 
held press conferences and led a "profamily rally" to show that 
homosexuals can create happy families, the Colorado Springs Gazette 
Telegraph reported. He drank only water and Gatorade. White is the 
author of Strangers at the Gate, a book about his unsuccessful efforts 
to change his sexual orientation. He also participated in a gay 
PrideFest, and in a communion service at the Pike's Peak Metropolitan 
Community Church, a congregation in the largely gay and lesbian 
denomination. White, an ordained minister, is dean of the MCC's massive 
church in Dallas. 
...Dobson was in Europe during the week, but he challenged White by 
letter to document his assertions that Focus programs and Dobson's 
writings have been bigoted, scripturally unsound, or mean-spirited. "On 
all occasions, the comments made were respectful, caring, and 
compassionate," Dobson wrote. "Take a month or two to check the record. 
You'll find not a word that dehumanizes any individual or any class of 
people." Dobson said he opposes homosexual activists' agenda because he 
disagrees with their objectives, and is especially concerned about 
efforts to use public schools to "undermine heterosexual marriages and 
the institution of the family." Taking such a position is not hatred of 
homosexuals, Dobson said. "It is a reflection of deep convictions about 
what is good for children, good for families, and good for the nation." 
Dobson said he would meet with White if he would "come privately for 
purposes of honest dialogue" rather than book promotion. 

Openly gay or lesbian adults are no more likely than heterosexual 
adults to sexually abuse children, according to a study published in 
Pediatrics. Researchers, led by Dr. Carole Jenny, director of the 
childprotection team at The Children's Hospital in Denver, studied one 
year of child abuse cases at the hospital. Of 269 cases in which an 
adult was suspected, the offender was identified by the child's 
caregiver as a possible homosexual in only two of them, the researchers 
said. In 222 of the cases, the suspect was a heterosexual partner of a 
relative of the child, they added. Although some of these were samesex 
cases, they did not classify the abusers as homosexuals, they 
acknowledged. Jenny indicated she undertook the study to counter 
lobbying by Colorado for Family Values. CFV contends that homosexuals 
are responsible for as much as 50% of all child molestations. "Any 
study that comes to the conclusion that [same-sex] pedophilia does not 
constitute homosexual behavior, I'm immediately skeptical of," said CFV 
Executive Director Kevin Tebedo. 

Confronted by his bishop about allegations of sexual abuse, Catholic 
priest John Hesch denied them, and hours later shot himself to death in 
his church-owned home in Richmond, Va. Diocesan sources said Bishop 
Walter Sullivan's investigation was prompted by the April 24 suicide of 
a 21-yearold member of an area church where Hesch formerly served. 
Parents of the victim asked that Hesch be excluded from participation 
in the funeral. Two former teachers of a Catholic school where Hesch 
taught sex education said they told the diocese in 1985 that parents 
and pupils were complaining about how the priest physically handled the 
children. 
...Hesch's death came 16 days after the suicide of the 46-year-old head 
of the diocesan Office of Christian Formation. Gerry Van Ostern's widow 
said he had been sexually abused by priests when he was a seminarian. 
Although Van Ostern and Hesch were friends, Sullivan said he doesn't 
believe the two deaths are related. He added that his investigation was 
incomplete. 

Catholic clerics warned female parishioners in Florida's Tampa Bay area 
to carry their purses with them when they leave the pew. Officials said 
six churches reported losses within recent weeks, mostly involving 
older women attending daily mass. 

An inmate won a United Methodist award for evangelism June 20. Eddie 
Williams, a prisoner at Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New 
York's largest maximum-security prison, was honored with the 1994 
Denman Evangelism Award, given by the Troy Annual Conference in memory 
of a noted lay evangelist, who died in 1976. Williams, who has served 
10 years at Clinton, was nominated by fellow inmates for his active 
Bible study, prayer life, and patient and friendly witness. He said he 
accepted the award "for every incarcerated man or woman who struggles 
to live out Christian faith in such a hostile environment," United 
Methodist News Service reported. 

Rejected: the Church of England's General Synod rebuffed proposals to 
separate church and state. By a vote of 273-110, delegates defeated a 
motion to lift direct state control over the appointment of diocesan 
bishops and over church legislation. In a voice vote, the synod also 
overwhelmingly rejected amendments that would have established a 
commission to review the constitutional relationship between the 
Anglican Church and the British government. Archbishop of Canterbury 
George Carey firmly opposed the proposed changes. 
...In other action, the synod rejected permitting laity to preside over 
communion, even though the practice has become common in many churches. 
Officials also reported to delegates that it will cost the church more 
than $4.5 million to compensate clergy who have resigned or will quit 
within the next year because they oppose the church's decision to 
ordain women. Of the church's 10,247 paid male clergy, 139 have 
resigned, and another 71 have announced they will quit. 

Churches seeking to avert a split along liberal-conservative lines have 
found a solution: dual denominational membership. Twenty-one 
congregations in the generally liberal United Church of Christ also 
have joined the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference. The 
CCCC extends membership to evangelical churches that are congregational 
in polity, or belong to the National Association of Congregational 
Christian Churches, Brett Kristoff of the UCC Board for Homeland 
Ministries said. The CCCC, which in 1993 experienced the largest net 
increase in growth in its 46-year history, numbers 38,000 people in 209 
churches. Dual-member congregations can maintain loyalty to the UCC 
while meeting needs of theologically and socially conservative 
congregants, Clifford Christiansen, CCCC conference minister, told 
NIRR. 

It's unanimous. Kenneth Hemphill is the choice of a selection committee 
to become president of 3,000-plus student Southwestern Baptist Seminary 
in Fort Worth. Hemphill, 46, a former pastor of First Baptist Church in 
Norfolk, Va., presently directs the Southern Baptist Center for Church 
Growth in Atlanta. An expert on expository preaching, Hemphill will 
replace Russell Dilday, ousted in a dispute with trustees earlier this 
year (NIRR 3/21). 

Black Baptist churches by the hundreds, perhaps thousands, are being 
caught up in a charismatic renewal movement sweeping the country. This 
month, 20,000 people in the movement rocked the Superdome in New 
Orleans for four days, singing, dancing, shouting praises, and speaking 
in tongues, the Times-Picayune reported. "We do not take our direction 
from any convention, but directly from God," pastor Paul Morton of the 
city's 10,000-member Greater St. Stephen Full Gospel Baptist Church 
told the crowd. Morton, 43, launched the movement less than two years 
ago. He is the first presiding bishop of the Full Gospel Baptist Church 
Fellowship, which he says has linked 2,500 Baptist churches nationwide. 
Many congregations of the 5.5-million-member National Baptist 
Convention, U.S.A., reportedly have identified with the fellowship. 
..."This is the pre-eminent movement on people's minds, one that has 
major black church leaders taking notice and fretting about its 
development," said Robert Franklin, who directs black church studies at 
Atlanta's Emory University. "Many people think of their churches as 
refuges from the storm," he said. "But the problems of the streets are 
so urgent that many want their church to become a place of empowerment 
to confront the storm." 
...The movement faces two potential dangers: emphasizing individual 
spirituality at the expense of the church community, and becoming a 
separate denomination, Franklin said. The latter, he said, would risk 
loss of the fervor that now comes from its tension with the larger 
Baptist community. Indeed, organizers of the Superdome conference 
complained that traditional Baptist denominations have fallen into the 
grip of "spiritual apartheid," in which gifts of the Holy Spirit are 
not welcome. Spirit are not welcome.

"This is a wonderful day to be alive. God has allowed us to live to see 
a new dawning for evangelism," Billy Graham told 2,500 evangelists, 
spouses, and students at the June 28July 1 North American Conference 
for Itinerant Evangelists. Graham said he is praying for "a new touch" 
of the Holy Spirit. "Seldom has the soil of the human heart and mind 
been better prepared than today. I've never seen so many come to 
salvation in such a short time," Graham said. America is at the center 
of "a great revival," he said, prodding evangelists not to "sleep 
through" it. The gathering of evangelists from 49 states and nine 
provinces was sponsored by the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association 
and 40 denominations and associations. 
...Evangelists were abuzz over signs of coming revival. "Everywhere we 
go we're seeing souls saved," said Baltimore's Pat Kelly, who formed 
Lifeline Ministries in 1986 after 13 years as a major league baseball 
player. He counted 87 from among 130 youngsters coming to Christ at a 
Pittsburgh baseball clinic, two dozen at a Maryland prison, and more 
than 40 at Teen Challenge in Pennsylvania recently. Christmas Trotter, 
who works in the Cabrini Green area of north Chicago, said young people 
are taking notice of spiritual matters. Assistant pastor Ulysses 
Bestey, who works in a day-care ministry to non-Christians in Kansas 
City, said children as young as 4 are coming to God, and "challenging 
their parents about making a decision for Christ." Nazarene pastor 
Kenneth Dove has seen his Fulton, Ky., church grow 30% in 18 months. 
Disheartening world events are creating "a hunger for real spiritual 
truth," he said. 
..."We're ripe for revival," said John Hayford of Edmonton, Alberta, 
Canada, an evangelist with the Pentecostal Assemblies. "There are a lot 
of pockets of prayer in Canada." As part of a nationwide prayer focus 
Oct. 1, teams already are praying for cities to repent. Southern 
Baptist itinerant evangelist Dale Griffith said several churches in 
Georgia and Texas have exploded in revival over the past several years. 
Alvin Reid, professor at Houston Baptist University, is more optimistic 
about a movement of God than he has been for years because various 
Christians are praying together. A core group wants to "get on the 
cutting edge of evangelism" in order to "set everyone else ablaze," 
said Steve Mowery, professor of missions at Pennview Bible Institute in 
Pennsylvania. "The walls have fallen for evangelists," Phil Farnsworth 
of Jackson, Mich., said. 

An extraordinary phenomenon has rippled across Argentina, Canada, 
Britain, the United States, South Africa, and India. Consistent reports 
describe a state similar to drunkenness, including shaking with 
laughter, crying, slipping into a trance, and falling to the floor. 
Repentance, warm feelings of love and peace, the "return of prodigals," 
and a number of salvations also have been reported. Some say they have 
experienced physical or emotional healing, or spiritual refreshing at a 
time when they were close to burnout. Observers say such phenomena are 
not new among charismatic or Pentecostal circles, but rarely have they 
become widespread so quickly. 
...The excitement started Jan. 20 for a small church in Mississauga, 
Canada, near Toronto. John Arnott, pastor of Vineyard Christian 
Fellowship-Airport, told Charisma magazine he began holding special 
services (NIRR 3/21) after attending meetings led by Orlando pastor and 
healing evangelist Benny Hinn and after visiting Argentina last 
November. In that South American country, a decadelong revival launched 
by evangelist Claudio Freidzon (NIRR Special Report 7/1/91) is 
continuing. Also instrumental in bringing renewal and ministering at 
the Toronto church was Arnott's friend, Vineyard pastor Randy Clark. 
Disheartened and nearly burned-out, Clark's fervor was rekindled when 
he was prayed for during meetings at Rhema Bible Church in Tulsa, Okla. 
The services were led by evangelist Rodney Howard-Browne, who moved 
from South Africa to the United States in 1987. The Canadian movement 
quickly crossed denominational lines into Baptist, Presbyterian, 
Anglican, Pentecostal, charismatic, and other groups in Toronto, 
Ottawa, and Vancouver. Meetings full of manifestations of the Holy 
Spirit at Airport Vineyard have continued six nights a week. The 
400-seat sanctuary is packed each time, associate pastor Steve Long 
told NIRR. 
..."We don't know why God has picked our dumb little church," Jeremy 
Sinnott, one of Airport Vineyard's pastors, told The Sunday Telegraph 
of London. As reports of miraculous manifestations spread, pilgrims 
from the city's suburbs, the United States, Europe, Australia, 
Singapore, and Hong Kong swarmed to Toronto to receive what now is 
dubbed the "Toronto Blessing" and spread it to their home churches. 
Vineyard Christian Fellowship founder John Wimber also spoke at the 
church recently. 
...Congregations in Chicago, San Francisco, Houston, Dallas, Boston, 
Buffalo, Orlando, and Lakeland, Fla., have experienced renewal. They 
have come under the ministries of evangelists Howard-Browne, Hinn, 
Cindy Jacobs of the Colorado Springs-based prayer ministry Generals of 
Intercession, and other lesser-known leaders touched by the Holy Spirit 
at meetings in which the phenomena occurred. Congregants reportedly 
have been freed from addictions, eating disorders, and depression, and 
several have had powerful mental impressions of the lost going to hell. 
Prophesies also are reported. Meetings often involve repentance. When 
that happens, the laughter stops and crying begins, observers say. 
..."Revolutionary, to put it mildly," Gary Eberts, a pastor at the 
independent MidWest Christian Center in Tinley Park, Ill., said 
describing the effect that a month of meetings led by Howard-Browne had 
on his church. Hundreds of baptisms were performed and so many 
marriages were healed that "our counseling load has virtually 
disappeared," Eberts told NIRR. Some participants who collapsed to the 
floor remained there for hours, and in one case, cleaners the next 
morning had to vacuum around them. One of 300 people who became 
Christians during the meetings was a leader of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization in Chicago, Eberts said. The "return of prodigals," the 
salvation of new believers, and the sense of "encounter with God at a 
very deep level that produces lasting changes" in people characterizes 
the meetings, he said. 
...In England, the "times of refreshing" have fallen on several hundred 
congregations in many denominations, including New Church, Anglican, 
Baptist, and Pentecostal, Britain's Alpha magazine reported. Terry 
Virgo, leader of the New Frontiers network of churches, said he never 
had seen "lives changed so rapidly and the atmosphere of a church 
altered so swiftly." Gerald Coates of Surrey-based Pioneer People 
church prayed for "a man of great control" who had "never fallen under 
the power of the Spirit in the 15 years I've known him." The man began 
"weeping under conviction," told Virgo he was "overcome with a sense of 
the awesomeness of God," fell to the floor, and could not move. Many 
say they don't want to live with sins they previously tolerated, Virgo 
said. Ron Stringer of The King's Church in Penzance said people he had 
counseled for years because they were "full of fear or self-imposed 
restrictions" changed almost overnight. Elli Mumford of Holy Trinity 
church, in Brompton, admitted her sense of "spiritual bankruptcy" prior 
to God's touch and said she hadn't had such "an appetite for ministry 
in years." Several churches reported 20-30 conversions to Christ in 
recent days. 
...English people "probably don't expect things like this to happen to 
us," but "it is rather pleasant when they do," one man said. Although 
believers have been wary of ridicule from the secular press, newspaper 
coverage of the events in The Times, The Independent, and The Sunday 
Telegraph, has been surprisingly sympathetic, observers said. 
...Renewal is not yet a revival, but may be preparation for one, some 
leaders say. In a revival, many unbelievers come to faith in Christ, 
which has not happened on a widespread basis, they say. But leaders do 
speak of a growing momentum and anticipation of further outpourings. 
...Calm voices are reminding the church of the need for wise and 
thoughtful leadership in the midst of the excitement. "If not handled 
right, it will provide disruption and division in the church," said 
Nick Cuthbert, pastor of Birmingham Riverside Fellowship. "We need to 
glue ourselves to the Scriptures," he said. 
...Criticism from within the church also has surfaced, and Christians 
who dislike the charismatic movement "are bound to be suspicious of 
this latest outburst of enthusiasm," The Sunday Telegraph said. 
Derbyshire Baptist pastor Alan Morrison told the Telegraph that 
"thousands of Christians are being hoodwinked" by a religious craze. If 
the focus remains on manifestations of the Spirit rather than sound 
teaching, the renewal is in danger of getting off track, Baptist 
pastors who attended or heard of the meetings at Airport Vineyard told 
Faith Today magazine. George Carey, the archbishop of Canterbury, 
declined to visit Airport Vineyard during a trip to Toronto recently. 
Carey, however, sent a representative to the service. The Anglican 
church leader is said to be delighted by talk of revival, but reluctant 
to back what some view as self-induced hysteria. In England, renewal 
leaders and local networks are meeting, and some church groups are 
providing guidelines and apologetics. Bill Jackson of Champaign 
Vineyard Church in Urbana, Ill., has written a widely circulated 
14-page document that seeks biblical precedent for the phenomena. 
...Similar manifestations of the Holy Spirit were common in 18th and 
19th century awakenings, said Fuller Seminary professor C. Peter 
Wagner, who himself has been "overtaken by laughter." The current 
renewal may be "part of many things the Lord is doing to prepare us" 
for a coming revival, he told NIRR. "Maybe the Lord is saying we've 
suffered enough" and is filling Christians with joy. Virgo said, "We 
have longed for such days, and pray that God will give us wisdom and 
spiritual energy to serve Him well" during such an "outpouring of the 
Holy Spirit." 

Two Iranian church leaders have been murdered in Tehran. News Network 
International said Tateos Michaelian, 62, chairman of the Council of 
Protestant Ministers in Iran, was shot to death late last month. He had 
succeeded Bishop Haik Hovsepian Mehr, who was killed in January (NIRR 
3/7). Michaelian was senior pastor of St. John Armenian Presbyterian 
Church in Tehran. The body of another pastor, Mehdi Dibaj, of the 
Assemblies of God, was found in a park in Tehran, authorities announced 
July 5. Dibaj spent 10 years in prison before being convicted of 
apostasy for converting from Islam to Christianity. He was put on death 
row last year, then abruptly freed in January after an international 
campaign publicizing his case. Several days after Dibaj's release, 
Mehr, an Assemblies of God leader who led the campaign for Dibaj's 
freedom, disappeared. His body was found in the street with stab 
wounds. 
...At least three other Christians are under arrest, including two 
church leaders and Hassan Shahjamali, a permanent U.S. resident. 
Observers are divided over who is responsible for the murders, the 
Iranian government or a powerful Muslim faction it is unable to 
control, NNI reported. 

Thousands of Bangladeshi Muslims marched repeatedly through the streets 
of Dhaka, calling for the death of writer Taslima Nasrin. She has been 
in hiding, possibly in a Western embassy, since Islamic clergy placed a 
price on her head for saying in a published interview that Islamic law 
concerning women should be revised. Late last month, she said on 
Australian television that Islam treats women as slaves. "If women want 
to live like human beings, they will have to live outside the religion 
and Islamic law," she said. 

China is persecuting a Christian sect through arbitrary detentions, 
torture, and exorbitant fines, the New York-based Human Rights 
WatchAsia charged in a 21-page report. The Chinese believers, based in 
Henan province and said to number 200,000, are known as the "Shouters" 
for their practice of shouting Christian slogans in unison. The group 
is linked to the teachings of Witness Lee, a Taiwanese-American, and 
his Local Church movement, which emphasizes the Second Coming and 
contends that denominationalism is a sin. 

Church mediators will help keep peace in Rwandan refugee camps packed 
with thousands of displaced, traumatized, grieving people. Workers sent 
by Church World Action-Rwanda, a joint project of the World Council of 
Churches and the Lutheran World Federation, will help mediate conflicts 
among refugees in camps outside Rwanda and inside the nation when 
possible, news reports said. 

Non-Catholic, private schools must teach Catholicism, according to a 
new law in Bolivia. Enacted in late June, the measure also doubled the 
amount of Catholic instruction required in tax-supported schools. 
Bolivia is the only nation in South America that has a constitutional 
unity of church and state. Halting the growth of the evangelical 
segment of society is the purpose of the regulation, according to 
Demitrio Reynos, Bolivian undersecretary of education. Evangelicals 
make up 11%-12% of Bolivia's population. 

Britain's monarch should no longer be the defender of only the Church 
of England, but should champion all religions, Prince Charles, 45, the 
heir to the throne, said. He gave his opinion in an interview with BBC 
television. To many, his remarks were a warning that the days of 
special status for the Church of England are numbered. This week, 
disestablishment -- separation of church and state -- is on the agenda 
at the denomination's general synod. Several church leaders have called 
for ending state control over appointment of bishops and legislation 
approved by the synod. During the interview, the prince confessed to 
adultery during the final stages of his marriage to Diana, from whom he 
separated two years ago. 

An American pastor in England is being dismissed by British Methodists 
for his stand against homosexuality. John Gillespie, Jr., 37, pastored 
British Methodist churches for six years. This year, he refused to sign 
the yearly allegiance to the British Methodist Conference, required of 
every minister. The conference adopted a policy affirming "the 
traditional moral teaching" of the church and "participation and 
ministry" of lesbians and gays. Gillespie said it is unclear whether 
the policy refers to practicing or non-practicing homosexuals, and 
whether "ministry" means the ordained ministry. He was tried by a 
church panel, found guilty of refusing to affirm allegiance to the 
British Methodist Conference, and was informed about his July 1 
dismissal. Gillespie says he is not a rebel, but is trying to be 
faithful to his understanding of Scripture and "what it means to be a 
Methodist." 

An avowed homosexual is "one who affirms publicly and intends it to be 
known that she or he engages in or intends to engage in physical sexual 
behavior with a person of the same gender." So said a statement adopted 
by the United Methodist Church's California-Pacific regional 
conference, the first UMC conference to develop a working definition of 
what it means to be homosexual. It also said the practice of 
homosexuality is an "active involvement, with behavior that has a 
sexual-romantic focus."  The issue of homosexuality and ministry has 
been debated in the 8.9-million-member UMC for more than 20 years. In 
1972, the church's General Conference ruled that homosexual behavior is 
contrary to Christian teaching and the UMC Book of Discipline. A law 
forbidding ordination of "self-avowed, practicing homosexuals" was 
added later to the Discipline code, but differences arose over 
interpretations. The UMC's Judicial Council ruled last year that the 
General Conference and each regional conference must develop their own 
definitions. 

The death of a woman who underwent an abortion at a Florida clinic has 
prompted abortion opponents to step up their protests. A medical 
examiner said the woman, 30, bled to death from a severed artery. A 
National Organization for Women spokesperson said the death was tragic, 
but does not "negate the fact that legal abortion is a very safe 
surgical procedure." The Pensacola Women's Medical Services clinic, 
where the abortion was performed, has been the target of frequent 
protests. Abortionist David Gunn was shot to death there in March 1993. 
"When the doctor died, [the story] was all over the country," said 
protest leader John Burt (NIRR 3/22/93). "When a woman dies, no one 
cares." 

"Devastating consequences for the pro-life movement." That's what 
rights lawyer Jay Sekulow says will result from the Supreme Court's 
ruling about buffer zones in Madsen v. Women's Health Center. The high 
court, in a 6-3 decision written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, 
upheld a Florida judge's order keeping protesters 36 feet away from a 
Melbourne clinic. Under the ruling, judges can issue injunctions that 
ban abortion protesters from public streets and sidewalks near clinics. 
..."The voice of peaceful pro-life protest around abortion clinics was 
not silenced" by the ruling, said Steven McFarland of the Center for 
Law and Religious Freedom. The court struck down some restrictions in 
the Florida case as too broad. These included applying the buffer-zone 
limits to private property near clinics, barring demonstrators from 
approaching abortion-seeking women within 300 feet of the clinic, 
picketing at the same distance near the homes of clinic staff, and 
banning "images observable" inside the clinic. 

California's abortion consent law is unconstitutional because it 
violates minor females' right to privacy, a state appeals court ruled. 
The 1987 law, unenforced because of court challenges, requires 
unmarried women under 18 living at home to get parental or court 
permission for abortions. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld 
such laws under federal standards, California's constitutional right to 
privacy has been interpreted by state courts to be more protective than 
its federal counterpart. 

A group of 35 House Democrats warned Speaker Thomas Foley they will not 
vote for any health-care reform plan that includes abortion in the 
package of minimum guaranteed benefits. Combined with existing 
Republican opposition, the letter means that it will be virtually 
impossible to pass any version of the Clinton plan unless abortion 
services are removed, analysts said. 

The United States will take a prochoice stand on abortion at a United 
Nations conference on world population control in Cairo in September 
(NIRR 6/27), President Clinton told a National Academy of Sciences 
gathering. His announcement was seen by many as a reply to Vatican 
pressure to remove abortion from the conference agenda. Vice President 
Al Gore told a population forum in Washington that the Vatican's 
opposition to abortion and artificial contraception had created an 
"unnecessary tension" with the White House. He lauded Catholic efforts 
to reduce child mortality and improve women's status. "Let's find ways 
to work together," Gore said. 

Another abortion-inducing drug is undergoing a clinical trial, the 
University of California medical center in San Francisco announced. 
Methotrexate, a relatively inexpensive anti-cancer drug, is being 
tested in conjunction with a hormone on women who are fewer than eight 
weeks pregnant. The combination was used in testing on 175 pregnant 
women at San Francisco General Hospital, where doctors said results 
compared with those of RU-486. Doctors said the drug is an alternative 
to, not a replacement for, surgical abortion. 

Planned Parenthood is winning back donors with handwritten letters. The 
group's affiliate in Chapel Hill, N.C., sends two-page letters to large 
contributors who have stopped giving. Six or seven parties are held 
each year, with each volunteer writing four letters using personal 
stationery. Volunteers wrote 163 letters last year, and Planned 
Parenthood received gifts from 102 of the recipients. Most 
computer-produced mailings yield far fewer responses. Planned 
Parenthood lets letter writers know when one of their appeals has 
prompted a donation, and the volunteers send thank-you notes or call 
the contributor. 

Proposed legislation in Spain would eliminate virtually all 
restrictions on ending a pregnancy during the first 12 weeks. If 
pregnancy presents "a serious personal, family, or social conflict," 
government services would inform her about abortion. A woman could 
abort within three days after acquiring the information. Since 1985, 
abortion has been legal in mainly Catholic Spain in cases of danger to 
the mother's life, rape, incest, or fetal malformation. Analysts expect 
the bill to pass despite opposition by the Church. 

Religious activities during gaypride days in New York City included a 
noon "Hands Around the God Box" demonstration outside the Interchurch 
Center at 475 Riverside Drive, which houses the headquarters of the 
National Council of Churches and the offices of many mainline 
denominations. Some 200 members of the homosexual-oriented Universal 
Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches and others tied a 
rainbow-colored ribbon around the building, nicknamed the God Box. MCC 
ministers listed complaints about how churches and church members 
allegedly have discriminated against homosexuals. The NCC has denied 
membership and observer status to the MCC over the past 13 years (NIRR 
6/28). NCC General Secretary Joan Brown Campbell took part in the 
ribbon tying to show support for homosexuals in "places where we can be 
supportive." 

Lesbian motherhood is an aberration of nature and a "complete and 
radical" break with God's plan for the family, according to an 
editorial by a theologian in the Vatican newspaper. The article 
commented on a controversy in Italy involving a doctor who said he 
artificially inseminated a lesbian so she and her partner could raise a 
child. The editorial said children have a right to be born into a 
normal family. It warned that children of unmarried mothers, including 
lesbians, are affected adversely. "Homosexuality cannot be considered 
normal," it said. "One must make every effort to eliminate or correct 
it." 

In a blistering letter to bishops of the Episcopal Church, Presiding 
Bishop Edmond Browning denounced an evangelical renewal group for 
publicly releasing a copy of a controversial embargoed draft statement 
on sexuality. He labeled the action by Episcopalians United for 
Revelation, Renewal, and Reformation as an "utterly reprehensible" 
attempt to derail the process established by the bishops to formulate 
church policy and its official statements. 
...The draft of the proposed pastoral letter called for the church to 
develop moral and ethical guidelines for homosexual, as well as 
heterosexual, relationships. "We believe sexual relationships reach 
their fullest potential as healthy relationships and minimize their 
capacity for ill when in the context of chaste, faithful, and committed 
lifelong union between mature adults," the draft said. "We believe this 
is as true for homosexual relationships as for heterosexual 
relationships, and that such relationships need and should receive the 
pastoral care of the church," it added. 

Women cannot be ordained as ministers, the Christian Reformed Church 
voted at its synod, held last month at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, 
Mich. The 95-89 vote among the delegates -- all of them male -followed 
two days of procedural maneuvering, emotional protests, and sharp 
debate. It reversed an opposite vote of 95-88 last year. To take 
effect, the 1993 action would have had to be affirmed at this year's 
synod. A day after the vote, the denomination told local congregations 
to remove from office any women ordained to the lesser office of elder. 
Turmoil over the issue has caused some 15,000 members -- mostly 
opponents of women's ordination -- to leave the 300,000-member 
denomination. A number of congregations have withheld funds, according 
to Reformed Believers Press Service, an independent news service that 
often clashes with denominational offices. 

Recent deaths: David Adeney, 82, scholar, veteran missionary to China 
and former missions head of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship; Tom 
Skinner, 52, evangelist, former chaplain for the Washington Redskins 
and founder of inner-city ministries. 

The Evangelical Free Church of America aims to double its 1,200 U.S. 
churches to 2,400 by 2000. The denomination will plant many of the 
churches in urban areas and in the South. EFCA President Paul Cedar 
challenged delegates at the denomination's 110th Annual Conference, 
held June 23-26 in Louisville, Ky., to "get out of the comfort zone" 
and care for physical and spiritual needs of people in cities. Some 30% 
of the denomination's planting efforts are directed there now. 

Unitarian-Universalists gave preliminary approval to include pagan, 
American Indian, and other Earthcentered traditions in its statement of 
religious principles. The action was taken by 2,500 delegates in a 
close vote at the group's national convention in Fort Worth. Final 
approval is subject to a two-thirds vote at next year's convention. If 
approved, the inclusions will be added to a list of traditions 
recognized as shaping the Unitarian Universalist faith. The group lists 
more than 140,000 members in more than 1,000 churches. 

A team of 150 traveling evangelists is presenting the gospel in rural 
communities bypassed by large evangelistic events. The six-year Youth 
With A Mission campaign, called the Impact World Tour, began in tiny 
Spooner, Wis. The weeklong visit included sports events, music, and 
artistic performances at 10 meetings. A total of 933 people responded 
to invitations to become Christians, and some are considering 
missionary service. Commitment to prayer and cooperation among churches 
also increased, local leaders said. The tour plans to visit several 
states each year until the turn of the century. This year's three-month 
leg of the tour also goes to Iowa, South Dakota, Montana, and 
Minnesota. 

Attending religious services is important to teen-agers, according to a 
Gallup Youth Survey. Of 518 teens surveyed, 49% said regular attendance 
at worship services is very important, and 34% said it is somewhat 
important. Only 17% said attending church or synagogue regularly is of 
little or no importance. More than half (54%) said they had attended 
services during the preceding week. Among this group, 68% rated 
attendance very important. Non-whites were more likely than whites to 
consider attendance very important (64% vs. 47%), as were Protestants 
than Catholics (63% vs. 36%), and Southerners (60%) and Westerners 
(50%) than those in the East (37%). 

Home schoolers linked by computer have formed a state-funded school in 
Michigan that will teach creationism along with evolution, traditional 
morals and ethics, and patriotism. Noah Webster Academy is the first 
"charter school" approved under a new Michigan law that encourages 
innovative schools. More than 750 students have enrolled in the 
academy, which opens Sept. 1. The school will qualify for $5,500 per 
student in state aid. It plans to hire a dozen teachers, buy a 486 
multimedia computer and laser printer for each family whose children 
enroll, and offer college financial aid to each of its graduate. 
...It's not a religious school, Noah Webster's founder, Lansing 
attorney David Kallman, insists. He describes the academy as a 
high-tech distance-learning center that will connect home schoolers 
around the state via computers, satellite video transmissions, and 
toll-free numbers. The academy has been recruiting students at 
conferences of Christian home schoolers, but Kallman noted that, in 
addition to Christian students, 20 Jewish and 10 Islamic children also 
have been signed up. The academy will offer courses, administer 
standardized tests, organize field trips, subsidize textbooks, and 
provide counseling for children from kindergarten through high school. 
...The academy is a ruse to get public tax money into private schools 
that teach religion, Beverly Wolkow, executive director of the Michigan 
Education Association, said. The American Civil Liberties Union's 
Howard Simon told The Wall Street Journal that Kallman manipulated the 
system by gaining its charter from a tiny, nearly bankrupt, rural 
school district, to which the academy will pay 1% of its state funds. 
Kallman described the payment as a fee for administrative expenses, but 
Simon calls it a "kickback." Michigan's school superintendent said the 
charter is legal, but it appears to be legal, it stretches the statute 
to its limit. 

Catholics who favor choice in education are organizing a nationwide 
campaign to press for public support for parochial schools. 
Representatives from all 13 of the Church's U.S. regions met in 
Washington, D.C., last month and formed the National Coalition of 
Catholic School Parents' Associations and a National Advisory Committee 
for Parents of Catholic Schools Students. Courts generally have found 
choice proposals involving aid to religious schools unconstitutional, 
and voters have tended to reject such proposals. However, Catholic 
groups may take a new approach: parental choice as a means of improving 
education of minority students in ghettos. There are 8,345 Catholic 
elementary and high schools nationwide with an enrollment in the 199394 
school year of 2.57 million. 

New York lawmakers are exploring ways to get around a U.S. Supreme 
Court decision last month that outlawed as unconstitutional a public 
school district for Satmar Hasidic Jews. The single-building Kiryas 
Joel Village School District was created in 1989 to provide education 
to children who have disabilities in the ultra-Orthodox village. The 
other children attend private religious schools. Most church-state 
experts and even leaders of other Jewish groups hailed the decision. 
However, Gov. Mario Cuomo criticized it, saying that although 
government cannot force anyone to be religious, it does not mandate 
that people be punished for being religious. Observers said that 
although the district will likely be absorbed by an adjoining school 
district, the setup can remain essentially the same. 

Nativity scenes may be displayed by cities and counties without 
violating the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution, the 
Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled in a 5-2 decision. The case originated in 
1990 when members of the Freedom from Religion Foundation tried to stop 
the village of Waunakee from displaying a nativity scene in a park. A 
county judge dismissed the case, and Wisconsin's supreme court last 
month upheld the ruling. 
...Lawyers for both sides were stunned by wording of the decision. It 
took issue with the U.S. Supreme Court's three-fold test for 
determining constitutionality in church-and-state cases: whether a 
government action has a religious purpose, endorses religion, or 
fosters an "excessive entanglement" of government and religion. It said 
the high court had expanded the meaning of "establishment" beyond that 
envisioned by the Constitution's framers, resulting in too broad an 
interpretation of "endorses." 
...Courts must protect the rights of majorities as well as minorities, 
the justices said. They noted that Christmas is a national and state 
holiday, and "has its historical origin in the birth of Jesus." Craig 
Parshall of The Rutherford Institute, which represented Waunakee, said 
the justices appear to be challenging the U.S. Supreme Court to review 
their decision. 

A Lutheran minister won the right to hold an evangelistic preaching and 
music event in a local park. State officials in Albany, N.Y., had 
sought to deny use of the park to Peter Whitehouse, director of 
missions and evangelism at Our Savior Lutheran Church in Albany. The 
temporary restraining order on his behalf came in response to a lawsuit 
filed by the American Center for Law and Justice. The ACLJ's Jay 
Sekulow argued that free speech is protected in public forums such as 
the park, and the policy of discrimination based on speech content is 
unconstitutional. 

Religious and political banners can be displayed during World Cup games 
at RFK Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C., a federal judge ruled. 
Stadium officials, citing security concerns, had ordered Paul O'Brien 
not to display his "Save Bosnia" and "Jesus" banners. But Judge Stanley 
Harris said the order was a denial of O'Brien's freedom of speech, and 
that no one would be harmed if the banners were displayed. 

Churches in suburban Atlanta's Cobb County are distributing 50,000 
gold-embossed, poster-sized copies of the 10 Commandments. They are 
protesting the recent Supreme Court decision banning display of the 
Commandments on a plaque at the local courthouse. Some area ministers 
said the court ruling called attention to erosion of religious faith 
among Americans. "This may be one of the powerful ways God can work 
through the blunder of the courts," pastor Randell Mickler of Mount 
Bethel United Methodist Church told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 

Rules against religious harassment will remain in the EEOC's guidelines 
to work place conduct (NIRR 6/27), predict many church-state experts, 
as well as key members of Congress and EEOC commissioners. But the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will change its proposed rules 
to affirm workers' rights to religious expression in the work place, 
they say. Both houses of Congress have voted to ask the EEOC to clarify 
its proposed changes. Critics said implementation of the guidelines as 
written could have made work places "religion-free zones" and muzzled 
speech of believers. 

Liberals accused religious conservatives of hypocrisy for complaining 
after Democrats lashed out at them last month in an apparently 
uncoordinated series of attacks. The religious right can dish it out 
but can't take it, columnist Michael Kinsley said. Conservatives 
accused Democrats of "Christian-bashing" and religious intolerance 
following attacks by California Rep. Vic Fazio, President Clinton, 
Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, and other Democratic leaders. 
...Fazio, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, 
charged that evangelical groups such as the Christian Coalition were 
using underground tactics and questionable funding to subvert and take 
over the Republican Party. They want "to carry views that are 
distinctly religious over into government and to try to impose those as 
laws," he told a National Press Club audience. His comments came 
following wins by candidates favored by religious conservatives in GOP 
conventions in Virginia, Minnesota, Texas, and other states. "People of 
traditional faith have become effective, and this makes the left 
quake," Indiana Sen. Dan Coats said. 
...Clinton said he was tired of being pounded by conservative 
broadcasters and the "scurrilous" misinformation they are spreading 
about him. In a St. Louis radio talk show interview, he compared Jerry 
Falwell to the money-changers Jesus threw out of the temple. Falwell is 
selling an anti-Clinton videotape, Circle of Power, for $43. Produced 
by Californiabased Jeremiah Films, the tape contains many accusations 
by Clinton foes, including one that claims the president ordered the 
murders of "countless people."  Another accuses Hillary Rodham Clinton 
of sexual improprieties. (Other conservatives, including former 
education secretary William Bennett, denounced the tape and distanced 
themselves from Falwell.) Said Clinton: "I do not believe that people 
should be criticized for their religious convictions, but neither do I 
believe that people can put on the mantle of religion and then justify 
anything they say or do." 
...Elders attacked the "un-Christian religious right" for opposing sex 
education and AIDS awareness programs. "We've got to be strong to take 
on those people who are selling our children out in the name of 
religion," she said in a keynote address to several hundred 
participants at the Lesbian and Gay Health Conference during gay pride 
celebrations in New York. She urged homosexuals to take the lead in 
health-care reform to get their concerns addressed. Elders' speech 
prompted a call for her resignation by 87 House Republicans. 
...All 44 Republican senators wrote to Clinton asking him to disavow 
attacks against Christians based on "religious bigotry." Republican 
leader Robert Dole of Kansas suggested the attacks were diversionary 
tactics that were prompted by gloomy prospects for Democrats at the 
polls in November. 

A Mormon scholar has been excommunicated for apostasy. David Wright, an 
assistant professor of Judaic and Near Eastern Studies at Brandeis 
University, is the sixth Mormon intellectual expelled since September 
(NIRR 5/17/93). In his writings, Wright argued that the Book of Mormon, 
the church's major scriptural work, is not ancient, but was written by 
founder Joseph Smith. Wright also said prophets' declarations are not 
infallible. He was fired from Brigham Young University in 1989 for 
reasons similar to those that led to his excommunication. Wright was 
deeply upset about the action, he told The Chronicle of Higher 
Education. 

Freemasonry is a "Christless religion" that teaches a false view of God 
and salvation, according to the Church of God (Anderson, Ind.). A 
resolution adopted by the denomination's General Assembly June 15 said 
membership in such secret societies and lodges that take oaths is 
incompatible with loyalty to Christ. Church of God researchers agreed 
with conclusions in the three-volume The Southern Baptist Convention 
and Freemasonry, written by SBC layman James Holly, that much of 
Masonic ritual and teaching is heretical. 
...Church of God leaders said they were puzzled over last year's SBC 
ruling that membership in a Masonic order should be left up to 
individuals as a "matter of personal conscience" (NIRR 3/7). The Church 
of God (Anderson, Ind.) has some 219,000 members in the United States 
and 365,000 more worldwide. 

Angels will be big on CBS this fall. Heaven Help Us features Ricardo 
Montalban as an angel who helps Melinda Clarke earn her wings. Two 
other shows are Touched by an Angel with Roma Downey and Betsy with 
Dolly Parton. Spokesmen said ABC and NBC had no angel series planned. 
...Spiritual awakening in Hollywood is genuine, but not necessarily 
Judeo-Christian, said Hollywood writer and producer Ron Austin. A 
religious syncretism may be emerging, he wrote in The National Catholic 
Register. Political idealism, sex, the occult, psychotherapy, and the 
New Age still are plentiful but no longer on the cutting edge, he said. 
Any spirituality -- including traditional religion -- is getting a 
hearing among Hollywood's creative people. 

O.J. Simpson was upheld in prayer on the floor of the U.S. Senate by 
Presbyterian minister Richard Halverson, 78, chaplain of the upper 
house since 1981. The nation had been traumatized by "the fall of a 
great hero," he said. Judging "whether he is innocent or guilty rests 
with our system of justice. But our hearts go out to him in his 
profound loss." The minister asked God to comfort those who had been 
"disillusioned by the fall of their idol," Simpson's loved ones, the 
victims, and the victims' families. 
...After statements by people who felt that not enough compassion had 
been shown for the victims, Halverson returned to the floor a few days 
later with a longer prayer for them and for all victims of domestic 
abuse. Soon afterward, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) in a speech took 
note of Halverson's prayer. "It seems we talk more and more often of 
fallen heroes, but we sometimes forget who they fall on," she said. 

If Jim Bakker passes muster during his stay at a Salvation Army halfway 
house in Asheville, N.C., the former TV evangelist will gain full 
release from prison in December. Bakker, 53, was transferred to 
Asheville from federal prison in Jesup, Ga. He will work at a local 
business during the day and return to the halfway house at night, The 
Charlotte Observer reported. 
...Bakker served about four and a half years of an eight-year sentence, 
which had been reduced from 18 years. He was convicted in 1989 of 
defrauding his followers in the PTL ministry of millions of dollars. 
While in prison, he and his wife, Tammy Faye, divorced. She later 
married Roe Messner, a contractor who built much of the former PTL 
complex. As he was released, Bakker again asked forgiveness of those he 
had hurt "by my sin and arrogant lifestyle." He also asked pardon from 
the church for "pain and shame I brought" to them and to the name of 
Christ. 

Unvaccinated Christian Science students were the center of an outbreak 
of measles that infected 200 people, the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention reported. The outbreak was centered at Principia 
College in Illinois, and a Christian Science school in nearby Missouri. 
Principia's staff, faculty, and students are Christian Science members, 
although the school is not officially affiliated with the sect. The CDC 
said many students were vaccinated after the outbreak, but most already 
had the disease. Although most church members rely on spiritual healing 
without medical help, church doctrine does not prohibit vaccinations. 
prohibit vaccinations.

The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) has averted a split. Liberals and 
conservatives had been bitterly divided since November's "RE-Imagining" 
conference (NIRR 6/13), which included what conservatives characterized 
as worship of a female deity and mockery of orthodox doctrine. But 
delegates to the denomination's 206th General Assembly, held June 10-17 
in Wichita, Kan., voted for reconciliation in the 2.7-million-member 
denomination. They approved a statement calling for "critics of the 
church's leadership and critics of the critics to cease and desist and 
allow healing to happen." After the 516-4 vote, delegates in the 
assembly hall cheered, applauded, wept, and hugged. 
....Theological orthodoxy was upheld. "We reject teachings that deny 
the tenets of our faith," the report said. "Let there be no doubt that 
theology matters, that our Reformed tradition is precious to us, and 
that we intend to hand it down to the next generation." On the other 
hand, individuals have the right to explore theological options, the 
report said. It acknowledged that problems are bound to happen at 
conferences involving people of various faiths, and it supported the 
Presbyterians who attended, planned, and funded the conference. New 
guidelines on spending denominational money were requested. The report, 
an official response to presbyteries around the country, does not call 
for further investigation of the conference. The denomination cut $2.4 
million from its budget after many congregations withheld donations to 
protest the PCUSA's giving $66,000 to the conference. Parker 
Williamson, editor of the conservative newspaper Presbyterian Layman, 
said he thought the congregations now would release the funds. 
...Clergy sexual conduct was a second flashpoint at the convention. 
Delegates approved measures prohibiting ministers from blessing 
same-sex unions, and requiring clergy to demonstrate "the Christian 
life and faith as defined by Scripture and the Confessions." A motion 
against sex outside heterosexual marriage, which conservatives 
considered a curb against adultery but liberals said penalized 
homosexual clergy, was defeated. 

The Scottish Episcopal Church has voted to admit women to the 
priesthood. The action, taken at the General Synod this month, leaves 
the church in Wales as the only Anglican denomination in the British 
Isles to bar women priests. 

All 200 members of an Episcopal congregation converted to Catholicism. 
St. Mary the Virgin Episcopal Church of Arlington, Texas, became St. 
Mary the Virgin Catholic Church. The switch was caused by opposition to 
the ordination of women. It is the sixth U.S. Episcopal church to 
become Catholic under provisions approved by the Vatican in 1980. 

Southern Baptist conservatives failed to get their hand-picked 
candidate elected president of the denomination for the first time in 
15 years. Jim Henry's election as president of the SBC, on a 
9,876-8,023 vote, was seen as a victory for those who want to move 
beyond theological and political battles. Henry, an Orlando pastor, is 
a theological conservative who supports less-antagonistic relationships 
with moderates. He was elected during the mid-June SBC convention in 
Orlando. Henry defeated Fred Wolfe, the candidate endorsed by 
conservative leadership of the 15.2-millionmember SBC, the nation's 
largest denomination. Henry was supported by Russell Dilday, whose 
firing in March as president of Southwestern Baptist Theological 
Seminary (NIRR 4/4) outraged many conservatives as well as moderates. 
Dilday said Henry's election, while welcome, may come too late to 
soothe the anger of those alienated from the convention. 
...In other actions at the SBC convention, delegates:  Voted not to 
investigate the firing of Dilday. A motion to ask Henry to appoint a 
committee to do so failed 45% to 55%.  Endorsed health-care reform but 
criticized abortion coverage.  Said born-again believers may be found 
in all Christian denominations, and endorsed dialogue with Catholics. 
...A resolution approved by the SBC Executive Committee urged the 
denomination's agencies not to accept money from the Cooperative 
Baptist Fellowship, the moderate SBC caucus. Thus contributions could 
be made only to the organization generally, with the board determining 
how the money would be allocated. 

The church must recapture its right to interpret the Bible, which it 
has surrendered to academia, speakers at a June 6-8 conference said. 
More than 400 Catholic, mainline Protestant, evangelical, and Eastern 
Orthodox theologians attended "Reclaiming the Bible for the Church: A 
Conference Concerning the Crisis of Biblical Authority and 
Interpretation," at St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minn. It was 
sponsored by the 2-year-old Center for Catholic and Evangelical 
Theology, which encourages the "catholic tradition" in doctrine, 
institutions, and liturgy. The independent, interdenominational 
center's board is composed mainly of Lutheran church leaders. 
...Clergy have succumbed to academia's claims to be the "only 
legitimate interpreter" of the Bible, Robert Jenson, professor of 
religion at St. Olaf and associate director of the center, said. While 
systematic theologians study philosophy, psychology, and sociology, 
they have bypassed biblical exegesis, Jenson said. Delegates at the 
conference said they rejected a "pre-critical" biblical interpretation 
-- or biblical fundamentalism -but still are searching for a "churchly 
framework" for interpretation. 

Retired heavyweight boxing champion Evander Holyfield says he has been 
healed of a serious heart ailment after evangelist Benny Hinn laid 
hands on and prayed for him. Holyfield wants to re-enter the ring, but 
his doctors warn him not to. The fighter, who at 31 has made $100 
million in the ring, pledged $265,000 to Hinn's Orlando Christian 
Center. 

A World Cup soccer outreach (NIRR 4/18) drew several thousand people 
June 18 to the Sylvan Theater, near the Washington Monument. The crowd 
brought blankets, lawn chairs, and picnic food for the day-long 
International Sports Outreach Festival. Featured were testimonies by 
former soccer player Kyle Rote, Jr., and Washington Redskins assistant 
coach Bobby Jackson, and contemporary and gospel music. Evangelist Luis 
Palau told the crowd that sports makes a "wonderful goal but a terrible 
God." 
...Hundreds of churches, denominations, and parachurch groups are 
participating in the outreach in the nine cities hosting the games -- 
Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, Orlando, San 
Francisco, and Washington. South Florida, Atlanta, Charlotte, 
Minneapolis, Indianapolis, Seattle, and Phoenix also are holding 
outreaches. Events continue through July 17, the day of the final 
match. They include prayer rallies hosted by Concerts of Prayer 
International, sports rallies by the Luis Palau Evangelistic 
Association, breakfasts by the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and 
soccer clinics by Missionary Athletes International. Palau's group, New 
Life Resources, The Navigators, The International Bible Society, Here's 
Life America, Here's Life Inner City, Church L.I.F.E., and Christian 
Businessmen's Committee provided videos, live lectures, and kits to 
train workers. 
...International Bible Society provided an NIV New Testament called 
Path to Victory, a 32-page souvenir booklet, and a four-page soccer 
scripture leaflet. Radio Bible Class published a World Cup edition of 
Sports Spectrum magazine. American Bible Society and New York Bible 
Society donated tracts to each city. 

Billy Graham bought air time on MTV for the first time in an effort to 
draw young people to his crusade in northern Ohio. Graham's crusade at 
Cleveland Stadium June 8-12 drew crowds averaging 42,800 each night. 
Some 3,950 responded nightly to the evangelist's invitation to make a 
commitment to Christ. On Saturday, more than 65,000 young people packed 
the stadium to hear testimonies by the Cleveland Cavaliers' Mark Price, 
performances by the rap group DC Talk and Michael W. Smith, and 
Graham's remarks. 
...Graham, 75, who has 19 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, 
increasingly has reached out to young people in the last several years. 
In Cleveland, in addition to the spots on MTV, Graham purchased time on 
youth-oriented programs on Fox TV to invite young people to the 
stadium. Also, rock 'n' roll stations WZAK and WJMO provided 
interviews, promotional spots, giveaways, and liveremote vans at the 
stadium to invite young people to the crusade. 
...Graham spoke with O.J. Simpson by telephone after the former 
football star was arrested on charges of murdering his former wife and 
her friend. Simpson, who was being held in a Los Angeles jail on a 
suicide watch, told Graham that his mother took him as a boy to a 
Graham crusade in San Francisco. Graham prayed with Simpson and planned 
to contact the families of the victims. 

Some 12.5 million people in more than 1,000 cities in 178 nations were 
expected to join in the first global March for Jesus on June 25, 
organizers said. Marches -- including a floating march on a ship at sea 
-- were planned for every time zone. Events in the Philippines, South 
Korea, and the United States were expected to draw more than a million 
participants each. Five million marchers were expected in Brazil. In 
Burundi, 10,000 from the Hutu and Tutsi tribes were planning to march 
in the capital. Zagreb, Croatia, and Novi Sad, Serbia, both were 
planning events with various ethnic groups marching together. There 
were 100,000 expected in South Africa, and 10,000 in Japan. A small 
group was to march in the winter dark of Antarctica. 
..."A Day to Change the World," also on June 25, involved a projected 
160 million Christians, coordinated by the AD 2000 missions group, who 
were praying for unreached people. David Bryant of Concerts of Prayer 
International was supervising an effort to hold 1,000 Concerts of 
Prayer worldwide. An additional 5,000 concerts of prayer were to be 
conducted by others. Esther Network International was mobilizing and 
training a million children and youth around the world to pray for 
unreached children. Some 50 million people were volunteering to pray 
daily and fast at least one day a week during June. Other Christians 
were to participate in "prayer expeditions" to the world's 
least-evangelized countries and cities, organizers said. 

More than 10,000 Haitians have died from the hardships of the embargo, 
Haitian missionary leader Cebian Alexis said. The poor cannot buy food, 
and malaria, typhoid, and diarrhea are almost everywhere, he said. 
...Humanitarian aid to Haiti has been bottlenecked by Washington's May 
6 executive order banning noncommercial flights, except in emergencies, 
to the Caribbean nation, said Richard Snook, president of West Palm 
Beach-based Missionary Flights International. MFI had been sending 
three DC-3s full of medical supplies a week. The State Department and 
the United Nations have been approving emergency flights, but it has 
been taking weeks to get clearance for them, Snook told NIRR. MFI has 
rented a second warehouse to store the growing backlog of medical cargo 
it cannot ship. Until it takes a shipment of supplies into Haiti, MFI 
also is unable to fly American missionaries out, he said. Commercial 
flights are fully booked. 
...As June 25 approached, with its additional ban on commercial North 
American flights to and from Haiti, Mission Aviation Fellowship planned 
to end its decade of support of missions, relief and development work, 
disaster aid, and medical services for Haiti. The Redlands, 
Calif.,based group blamed a lack of sufficient aviation fuel and 
growing risk to American personnel. 

Uncovered: remains of the plane that carried Nate Saint, Jim Elliot, 
and three other missionaries to martyrdom in the Ecuadorian jungle four 
decades ago. The Piper PA-14, pillaged and abandoned by the 
missionaries' attackers, was discovered June 4 in a sandbar. MAF pilot 
Bill Clapp retrieved a 7-foot section of the plane, but heavy rains 
forced postponement of its complete removal. 
...The slaughter of the five as they tried to contact the Huaorani 
Indians, then known as Aucas, made headlines worldwide in January 1956. 
The men's sacrifice inspired several books and animated a generation of 
new volunteers for missions in the 1950s and 1960s. The tribe was 
contacted successfully 19 months later by Saint's sister Rachel and 
Elliot's widow, Elisabeth. Ten years after the massacre, Saint's 
daughter Kathy was baptized by two of her father's killers, who had 
become leaders in the Huaorani church. A Huaorani translation of the 
New Testament was given to the indigenous church in 1992. 

A violent dispute is disrupting the 2.5-million-follower Batak 
Protestant Christian Church, Indonesia's largest Protestant 
denomination. The trouble began when the government appointed Bishop 
P.W.T. Simanjuntak to replace ousted Bishop S.A.E. Nababan as leader of 
the church in the Medan region of Sumatra in late 1992. According to 
news accounts, Nababan was known for a controversial emphasis on social 
action and individual rights. His backers rejected the switch, and 
began holding their own meetings, a move opposed by the majority 
faction. They claim at least 10 people have been killed, 3,000 injured, 
and 200 arrested in clashes and raids during the past 18 months. 
...Some 220 pastors marched into Parliament this month to protest what 
they called a government-led crackdown on their wing of the church. 
Among them was at least one injured pastor who said he and three other 
dissident church members had been detained by police and tortured for 
holding an illegal meeting. Some pastors said they had fled the island 
after a new government-backed task force, whose members included 
Mafia-style gangs and former soldiers, terrorized church members, 
burning houses and churches. During a hearing in Parliament, 
Indonesia's armed forces chief denied the military was behind a 
crackdown. 

A senior Iranian cleric said that Iran's spiritual and political 
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has the authority to overrule "fatwas," 
religious decrees issued by Muslim clergy. The pronouncement was made 
by Ayatollah Ali Akbar Meshkini, speaker of Iran's Assembly of Experts, 
the body that selects the country's top leader. Khamenei this month 
issued a ruling that banned people from stabbing themselves in the head 
during Shiite mourning rituals, a common practice. The late Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989 issued a fatwa sentencing British author 
Salman Rushdie to death for blasphemy in his book The Satanic Verses. 
Leaders have said the fatwa still stands. 

Tens of thousands of refugees crowded into church complexes to seek 
safety in Rwanda. As Tutsi rebels approached the capital city of Kigali 
this month, the Hutus butchered 63 people, including nine Catholic 
priests, at a church compound, United Nations sources reported. Days 
later, at a Catholic seminary complex where 35,000 refugees had 
crowded, four Tutsi guards opened fire killing three Hutu bishops and 
10 other clerics. The dead included the archbishop of Kigali and the 
president of the country's Catholic bishops' conference. Rebel leaders 
denounced the atrocity. They said one of the murderers had been shot 
trying to escape, and that the others are being sought for punishment. 
At another Catholic church in Kigali, Hutu militiamen took 60 Tutsi 
teen-age boys and killed them at a site where other massacres have 
taken place, sources said. 

A European-wide Protestant denomination could develop out of the 
Leuenberg Church Fellowship, an association of 80 Lutheran, Reformed, 
and United churches. Delegates to a meeting in Vienna in May said a 
European synod may be 10 years away for the Reformation groups, which 
ironed out doctrinal differences in 1973 and now are seeking to find 
common ground on several social and political policies, Ecumenical 
Press Service reported. 

Vatican-sponsored scientists embarrassed the Church when they 
recommended that couples bear only two children to curb world 
population growth. The report by a Vatican advisory panel neither 
listed recommendations on how to limit growth nor contradicted Vatican 
teachings on abortion or contraception. Nevertheless, it was an 
embarrassment to the Vatican because it contradicted Pope John Paul 
II's statements on the United Nations conference on population, to be 
held in Cairo in September. The 70page report was prepared by the 
Pontifical Academy of Sciences, composed of 80 scientists of various 
religions and nationalities. Vatican Radio said the academy is 
advisory, with no voice in official church teaching. 

The Israel-Vatican treaty clears the way for the Vatican to have a say 
in peace negotiations on the future of Jerusalem, according to Vatican 
and Israeli officials. They said the treaty was made possible by 
Israel's recent peace accord with the Palestinian Liberation 
Organization. A dissident PLO faction, however, expressed regret. It 
said Palestinians had expected the Vatican to continue refusing to 
establish full ties until Israel completely ended its occupation of 
Arab land. Some Jewish leaders gave most credit for the accelerated 
agreement to Pope John Paul II, in whose native Poland many of the 
atrocities of the Holocaust occurred. The way also is open for healing 
wounds in past relationships between Catholics and Jews, they said. 
"Effects of his papacy will be felt for generations," said Rabbi Lori 
Forman of the American Jewish Committee in New York. 

For the first time, fascist Russian leaders held talks with Messianic 
Jews. The nationalist group Pamyat is widely perceived to be intensely 
antiSemitic. Messianic Rabbis Jonathan Bernis and David Levine of New 
York and Andrew Shishkoff of Israel met last month with Pamyat founder 
Dmitri Vasilyev and Russian Orthodox priest Oleg Stenjaev, Pamyat's 
spiritual adviser. 
...Vasilyev denied being anti-Semitic, but said he wanted to improve 
Pamyat's public image, Levine told NIRR. Levine challenged the Russian 
nationalist to stop blaming Jews for killing Jesus, causing the 
Bolshevik revolution, controlling the media, and conspiring for world 
domination. Shishkoff urged Vasilyev to empathize with Jews since they 
and the Russians have suffered greatly. 

Israel's Supreme Court took a step toward granting recognition to 
non-Orthodox branches of Judaism. The court told the Ministry of 
Religious Affairs, long dominated by the Orthodox, that it must fund 
schooling and cultural activities for the Reformed and Conservative 
branches. The Orthodox, who predominate in Israel, reject other groups 
mainly because they do not share the belief that the Old Testament is 
God's absolute Word. Orthodox legislators have used their power to ban 
recognition of marriages, divorces, and other services performed by 
Reformed and Conservative rabbis. They also seek laws to disqualify 
conversions performed by non-Orthodox rabbis. Orthodox exclusivism will 
be ended, and "the values of pluralism, religious freedom, and 
conscience will be carried out," Reform Rabbi Uri Regev said after the 
court decision. 

"There is a real possibility for the Holy Spirit to move among the 
Hasidim" after the June 12 death of Menachem Mendel Schneerson, said 
Susan Perlman, associate executive director of Jews for Jesus. Some 
200,000 members of the ultraorthodox ChabadLubavich sect considered the 
rabbi to be the Messiah. They believed he was ready to reveal himself 
as such, and many carried electronic beepers expressly so they could 
respond immediately. His death, at age 92, was an inconceivable event 
for them. "A huge community is now leaderless," Perlman said. "They 
have to be questioning all that they have been told." Schneerson did 
not name a successor in his will, disappointing followers who hoped he 
would pick another leader to guide the movement. 

The most liberal branch of Judaism said a congregation must affirm 
belief in God to be permitted membership. By a vote of 115-13, the 
board of trustees of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the 
congregational arm of Reform Judaism, rejected the application of 
Congregation Beth Adam in Cincinnati to join 865 Reform congregations 
in the UAHC. Beth Adam is a self-described "humanistic synagogue" that 
has removed all references to God from its liturgy. Rabbi Robert Barr 
said members of his congregation infuse the liturgy with "their 
personal beliefs regarding the nature of the deity." 

An Orthodox rabbi and his wife are in the matchmaking business. 
Yeheskel and Pearl Lebovic of Clifton, N.J., take credit for 750 Jewish 
marriages in 13 years, with a divorce rate of less than 1%. They 
currently have 6,000 clients. The business is different from secular 
dating services. The Lebovics see themselves as alleviating a threat to 
Jews: zero population growth as a result of intermarriage, delayed 
marriage, and non-marriage. They have traveled to most major cities 
around the country interviewing clients, who are charged $180. If a 
couple marry, each of the two partners is asked to make an additional 
$360 contribution. 

A homosexual couple will serve as associate pastors at a United Church 
of Christ in Seattle. University Congregational Church hired Peter 
Ilgenfritz and David Shull of Chicago to share one ministerial position 
and salary. The two ordained UCC ministers said they met at Yale 
Divinity School in 1984 and have been together for eight years. They 
applied to about 150 churches, some for individual pastorates, but most 
often for joint pastorates, and received 115 rejection letters. The 
others never replied, they said. Each will work three days a week in 
missions, social action, and adult education. Gail Crouch, an associate 
pastor, said 76% of the 1,200 members voted to approve the hirings, and 
seven congregants have left the church in protest. Some members who 
voted against the hiring were opposed mainly to a jobshare arrangement. 
Most are willing to give the men a chance, Crouch told NIRR. It is 
thought to be the first mainline congregation with a gay ministerial 
couple, she said. 
...The church "did not set out to hire a gay couple," Crouch said. 
Fifty clergy applied, and the two men "together had more gifts to offer 
than any single individual." Crouch said the church has some gay and 
lesbian members, but also many families, most of whom are white and 
upperclass. It is "a pretty traditional church" located across from the 
University of Washington campus. 

Exodus International, a Christian ministry to homosexuals and lesbians, 
says it was "trashed" by a PBS documentary, which aired this month. The 
83-minute film, One Nation Under God, was critical of the ex-gay 
movement, and Exodus International in particular. It linked Christian 
ministries that promote "homosexual recovery" with such techniques as 
electro-shock therapy and exorcism. While the film makers implied that 
homosexuality is inborn and cannot be changed, testimonies of thousands 
of former homosexuals and lesbians "attest to the fact that 
homosexuality can be overcome through the power of Jesus Christ," Bob 
Davies, Exodus International's executive director, said. 
...The film focused on Michael Bussee and Gary Cooper, founders of 
Exodus International, who worked as national spokesmen until they left 
the group and their marriages to become homosexual lovers. Cooper died 
of AIDS before the release of One Nation, and the film is dedicated to 
his memory. The fact that Bussee and Cooper deserted their marriages 
does not invalidate the testimony of "former homosexuals and lesbians 
who have achieved satisfying marital relationships," Davies said. 

The medieval church blessed gay marriages, according to a controversial 
new book. Historian John Boswell of Yale University wrote Same-Sex 
Unions in Premodern Europe (Villard Books), a history of marriage from 
ancient Greece and Rome to the late Middle Ages. The book shows how 
terms such as "brother and sister" were used for siblings, heterosexual 
spouses, and homosexual couples. Boswell claims that Christian 
veneration of certain same-sex pairs of saints, including the Apostles 
Peter and Paul, and even Jesus and his "beloved disciple," John, 
indicates an acceptance of homosexual attraction. Cartoonist Gary 
Trudeau did a week of "Doonesbury" strips around Boswell's book, and 
ABCTV's Day One recently broadcast an interview with Boswell by John 
Hockenberry. That interview was taped last fall; Boswell now is gravely 
ill and unavailable for comment. 
...Boswell's scholarship is biased, critics say. Boswell, who is gay, 
studied ceremonial prayers and liturgies from the Byzantine tradition. 
In that period, homosexuality was punishable in church law by two or 
three years of penance and in civil law by torture, castration, and 
execution, Jesuit scholar Robert Taft told Newsweek magazine. Other 
critics say that Boswell's "same-sex unions" actually are celebrations 
of brotherhood or fraternity used for reconciling warring siblings, and 
for adoptions. 

Editors at The Seattle Times assigned reporters to attend church. The 
purpose was to help them understand conservative Christians, and to do 
a better job covering two anti-gay-rights initiatives proposed for the 
November ballot. Times editors said they were surprised by Pat 
Robertson's GOP primary victory in 1988, and by the narrow margin of 
victory for an abortion-rights initiative. "We don't want to be 
surprised again," editor David Boardman said. 
...The paper put together a list of churches and required the entire 
regional staff of 20 reporters to spend 20 hours over six weeks 
attending services and church functions or interviewing church leaders 
and members. Some reporters took offense at the assignment, which was 
the topic during several heated staff meetings. "They're sending out an 
army to sneak around the bushes" of conservative churches, one reporter 
said. 

Pat Robertson's International Family Entertainment enterprise is 
negotiating with Vietnam's government to build a microwave/cable TV 
system, an official of the Christian Broadcasting Network told Reuters. 
The system would beam dozens of channels to homes, first in Hanoi and 
eventually elsewhere in Vietnam, a spokesman said. IFE also agreed to 
buy Dorothy Hamill's Ice Capades, a touring skating show seen by about 
2 million people last year. Under the arrangement, IFE and Hamill, who 
will stay with Ice Capades as president, will produce a number of TV 
specials, an IFE spokesman said. Family Channel, which reaches 59 
million homes, is the 10th-largest U.S. cable network. 

Radio is reaching Tibetans more effectively than books, a Tibetan 
Christian minister visiting the United States says. Canada-educated, 
ethnic Tibetan, and a resident of India, Stephen Hishey toured in May 
and June, telling his views on taking the Christian gospel to the 6 
million Tibetans in five Himalayan countries of Asia. His research 
shows that 63% of Tibetans own shortwave radios and search the 
frequencies three-to-four hours each evening for Tibetan-language 
alternatives to Chinese propaganda broadcasts. Five million Tibetans 
live under Chinese rule. 
...Buddhist monks and philosophy students listen avidly and send 
letters, Hishey said. His shortwave broadcasts include biblical 
messages and items on Tibetan culture. 
...An uproar occurred in 1989 when he distributed his book, a Christian 
apologetic, among Tibetan Buddhists of northern India. Hishey told NIRR 
that even though a mob of 12,000 people converged on his home demanding 
action against him, he and his family escaped unharmed. The 
difficulties inspired his search for alternative ways to evangelize. 

Nuns are massaging the body as well as the soul. An increasing number 
work as massage therapists in hospitals, women's centers, retreats, 
hospices, retirement homes, and convents. Many say they are motivated 
by the belief that touching the body can touch the soul, according to 
the Chicago Tribune. Some clients have been abused, and never have been 
touched lovingly, Marie Clare Scheible, a Franciscan nun, said. Sexual 
connotations attached to massage therapy are so strong that nuns often 
have trouble convincing their superiors that it is a respectable 
profession. At least 12 nuns have studied at the Chicago School of 
Massage Therapy in the last several years. The National Association of 
Bodyworkers in Religious Service, a group for religious people who work 
in massage or acupuncture, numbers 150 members. 

 "In God We Trust" on the nation's currency is being challenged in a 
lawsuit filed by the Freedom from Religion Foundation, a Madison, 
Wis.-based organization of atheists and agnostics. The group sued in 
U.S. District Court in Denver on June 8 to remove the inscription. 
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Treasurer of the United States 
Mary Ellen Winthrop were named as defendants. "E Pluribus Unum," which 
means from many come one, is the "appropriate and accurate motto, and 
not controversial and inflammatory," Anne Gaylor, president of the 
group, told Religious News Service.  

The IRS should investigate church involvement in a political campaign 
in Pennsylvania, Americans United for Separation of Church and State 
said in a letter to the agency. At issue is a memo that a school 
official at Easton Catholic School in the Allentown area sent home with 
pupils. The memo urged parents to volunteer at the polls for a state 
Senate candidate in the Republican primary who favors tax aid to 
parochial schools. Federal tax law bars religious taxexempt 
organizations from taking part in political campaigns of particular 
candidates. After a newspaper publicized the action, a second memo was 
sent apologizing for the endorsement. The school official told 
reporters she had acted at the request of an executive at the Diocese 
of Allentown. 
...The apology does not absolve the school or the diocese of 
wrongdoing, AU head Barry Lynn said. He urged the IRS to investigate 
and "assess appropriate penalties" as a message to other "non-profit 
groups that believe they can ignore the law."  AU registered a similar 
complaint in 1992 when the Church at Pierce Creek in Binghamton, N.Y. 
(NIRR 12/14/92), took out full-page newspaper ads saying a vote for 
candidate Bill Clinton was a sin. That investigation is in progress, 
RNS reported. 

Christians are weeding out "sin stocks" -- shares in alcohol, tobacco, 
gambling, and pornography firms -from their investment portfolios, and 
are putting their money in "socially responsible" stocks. A number of 
funds use moral criteria for investing. Others use ethical criteria in 
community relations, employee relations, the environment, concern for 
women and minorities, military involvement, nuclear power, excessive 
compensation of executives, and tax disputes. 
...Socially responsible investing takes the needs of others into 
account, not just the bottom line, said Gary Moore, a former Paine 
Webber broker who runs his own investing and consulting firm in 
Sarasota, Fla. He told NIRR socially responsible investing can be as 
lucrative as other options. Ethical behavior reduces risk, said Moore, 
author of The Thoughtful Christian's Guide to Investing (Zondervan). As 
an example, last year tobacco stocks fell more than 50% and may drop 
further, Moore said. Socially responsible funds performed well over the 
years, brokers say. 

More small loans are being made to help Christian entrepreneurs in 
underdeveloped countries start or expand their businesses. The loans 
are offered to people who lack collateral to qualify for commercial 
credit. They average $100 to $1,000 and must be repaid with interest. 
...Opportunity International, a non-denominational group based in Oak 
Brook, Ill., is the largest Christian microenterprise development 
agency. Loans have "power to transform people and cultures" and are 
more effective than merely "relieving the symptoms," Jim Damron of OI 
said. It makes loans in 20 countries and has a portfolio of $8 million. 
"Around the world, this is what the churches are crying out for -- 
jobs," he said. Missions and evangelism cannot be sustained 
indigenously without effective economic development, he said. Most 
loans go to Christians, which strengthens the local church, Damron 
said. Other groups doing similar work include World Vision, Mennonite 
Economic Development Associates, and Latin America Mission. A handful 
of secular organizations also are involved. 
...World Relief, the international assistance arm of the National 
Association of Evangelicals, funds so-called community banks in five 
countries. Loans usually go to women, who receive $30 to start or 
expand a business. Upon repayment, they can qualify for additional 
loans of increasing amounts, up to a few hundred dollars. Borrowers 
belong to groups of 15-25 who are trained for six weeks and meet to 
talk about their businesses. 

In a 94-0 vote, the U.S. Senate approved a resolution asking the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission to drop religion from proposed 
guidelines on unlawful harassment in the workplace (NIRR 3/7). It also 
asks the EEOC to make clear in any new guidelines that religious 
symbols or expressions of religious beliefs are not to be restricted 
and cannot be used to prove harassment. As originally drafted, the 
guidelines define unlawful harassment as any verbal or physical conduct 
that "denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual 
because of his or her religion or that of his or her relatives, 
friends, or associates." In the House, the Appropriations Committee 
voted down a similar measure. The move could lead to floor debate in 
the full House. 
...Prior to the Senate vote, religious leaders at a committee hearing 
warned that the EEOC guidelines threatened individuals' religious 
freedom. However, some mainstream religious groups insisted that some 
protection is needed against religious bias in the workplace. Oliver 
Thomas, special counsel for the National Council of Churches, told 
reporters that if religion were eliminated from the proposed 
guidelines, "it would signal to the American people that religious 
harassment is of less concern, and therefore of less significance, to 
the federal government than racial or sexual harassment." Even worse, 
he added, "some might mistakenly assume religious harassment is 
permissible." He did call on the EEOC to "disclaim any attempt to 
create a `religion free zone' in the workplace as some have charged."  
A fact sheet the EEOC circulated said much of the behavior 
conservatives fear might be banned would be permissible, including 
wearing a cross or a yarmulke or sharing one's religious beliefs. 

Conservative Christians carried the day for their candidates in key 
Republican conventions. In Minnesota, they helped creationist-farmer 
Allen Quist, 49, win endorsement for the gubernatorial post over 
incumbent Gov. Arne Carlson, who has supported abortion and gay rights. 
Carlson said he would seek nomination in September's primary election. 
At the Texas GOP convention, religious conservatives took control of 
the party (NIRR 5/30). An estimated 70% of the 12,000 delegates were 
evangelical Christians, abortion opponents, and home school advocates. 
Delegates selected conservative Dallas lawyer Tom Pauken, a Catholic, 
as party chairman, and swept a number of moderates on the party's state 
executive committee from office. They also adopted a platform plank 
advocating "total constitutional rights for the unborn child." The 
Virginia-based Christian Coalition and its state affiliates were active 
in the conventions. 

"Dialogue dinners" are giving people with differing worldviews a chance 
to talk with each other in politically charged Colorado Springs. 
Citizens Project (NIRR 2/21), a group formed to counteract the growing 
conservative influence of the evangelical community in the city, 
founded and organizes the informal gatherings. 
...The purpose is to broaden people's understanding of others, 
challenge stereotypes, find common ground, and discover ways to coexist 
as a community despite differences, organizers say. Groups of 8-10 meet 
at least three times over dinner or dessert. Each group is composed of 
equal numbers of participants who identify themselves as leaning toward 
orthodox or progressive beliefs. Participants don't try to reach 
consensus on issues or convince others to change their beliefs, 
organizers say. Each group has a trained facilitator to ensure that all 
participants have an opportunity to be heard. Divisions in Colorado 
Springs are "not going to get healed unless people are talking face to 
face," said Amy Divine of Citizens Project. "The perception that there 
is this huge difference" among people gets broken down at dialogue 
dinners, she said. "The bulk of values are shared." 

A coalition of political opposites is urging approval of a saliva test 
for HIV, saying it could save many lives. The coalition includes 
members of AIDS and minority organizations as well as the National 
Association of Evangelicals, whose members come from 42,000 evangelical 
churches. The NAE has accused the U.S. government of foot-dragging in 
considering approval for the testing device OraSure. It consists of an 
absorbent pad on a stick, which is placed in the mouth. A gum fluid 
that contains more HIV antibodies than plain saliva is collected, and 
the swab is inserted in a preservative until it is analyzed at a 
laboratory. Epitope Inc., the Beaverton, Ore., company that developed 
OraSure, says studies prove the device is comparable to blood-testing 
methods in detecting HIV. It also can be useful in diagnosing a variety 
of other ailments and the presence of drugs. In January 1991, Epitope 
began selling OraSure to the insurance industry, which used it to 
screen prospective policyholders for HIV more inexpensively than by 
blood testing. Five months later, the FDA decided OraSure needed 
government approval and ordered it withdrawn. Despite the FDA's promise 
to finish its deliberations within 18 months, OraSure has been off the 
market for three years. The NAE blames special interests, including 
some companies that make blood tests. 

Public schools can teach children about religions without violating the 
separation of church and state, a federal appeals court in San 
Francisco ruled. The court upheld a ruling that rejected a lawsuit by 
conservative Christian parents in Woodland, Calif. The parents, Douglas 
and Katherine Brown, objected to the elementary school curriculum 
Impressions (NIRR 10/4/93). They said their children were subjected to 
anti-Christian teachings including lessons about witchcraft and other 
rituals, and were forced to participate in role-playing and imitate the 
rituals. However, the appeals court said readings about other religions 
did not constitute impermissible endorsement of them. 

Prayer was part of the graduation ceremonies at a number of high 
schools across the country. In Zeeland, Mich., the ACLU spent months 
trying to find a pupil willing to be a plaintiff in a prayer-blocking 
lawsuit. No one volunteered, the ACLU dropped the matter, and the 
students prayed. After ACLU objections to prayers last year, the local 
school district adopted a prayer policy patterned after one in Texas 
that had been upheld by federal courts. It allowed student-initiated 
prayer, free of input from faculty. 
...A Loudon County, Va., court forbade religion in ceremonies this 
year. So a youth ministry recruited graduating seniors from each of the 
high schools and arranged for a local radio station to broadcast their 
prayers on the Sunday before graduation. 

A school district violated a fifthgrader's First Amendment rights by 
forbidding her to hand out religious pamphlets, a federal judge in 
Tampa ruled. Amber Johnston-Loehner, 13, said she asked her elementary 
school teacher in Lakeland, Fla., for permission to distribute 
pamphlets during "non-instructional" time in October 1992. The teacher 
asked the principal, who threw the pamphlets away, according to a 
lawsuit filed by Amber's mother. The pamphlets were about Jews for 
Jesus, alternatives to Halloween, and other religious topics. The judge 
faulted the Polk Country School Board for imposing a policy of prior 
restraint based solely on content. Officials thought they couldn't 
allow religious material on school grounds, a board member told 
reporters. 

Ten religious schools in Puerto Rico have been ordered to shut down by 
July 1 because they refuse to comply with a state licensing procedure. 
The schools complied with all health, safety, and building regulations 
required by the commonwealth, but refused to "compromise religious 
convictions," said Edric Vivoni, the Rutherford Institute attorney 
handling the case. The Puerto Rican Supreme Court upheld a lower court 
ruling requiring religious schools to obtain state licensing. U.S. 
Supreme Court Justice David Souter denied a request to delay 
implementation of the ruling. In the United States, only Hawaii 
requires religious schools to be licensed. 
...Several hundred church leaders and members of the community have 
protested the ruling by camping out in front of the Capitol in San Juan 
for the last two months. "Many of us are willing to go to jail to 
resolve this issue," said Vivoni, who is one of the demonstrators. U.S. 
pastors also have joined the protest. Licensing would be a state 
intrusion into curriculum -- a practise the schools reject, said 
Rutherford attorney Anne-Marie Amiel. Rutherford will ask the U.S. 
Supreme Court to hear an appeal in the case based on the Religious 
Freedom Restoration Act, she said.

New regulations in China permit churches to register independently of 
the government-sanctioned Protestant organization known as the Three 
Self Patriotic Movement (NIRR 3/7), and its church arm, the China 
Christian Council, according to Chinese church officials in Nanjing. 
The officials faxed NIRR an English translation of a government 
document, Registration Procedures for Venues for Religious Activities, 
dated May 1. 
...To qualify as such a venue, an existing congregation of believers 
must regularly take part in religious activities. The congregation also 
must have a name, a fixed place to meet, a professional pastor or other 
qualified leader, an organizational structure with management 
regulations, and a source of funds to support itself. An application 
for registration must have the endorsement of local authorities. The 
government's Religious Affairs Department must act on the application 
within 75 days of its receipt. If registration is deferred or denied, 
the department must inform the congregation in writing and explain its 
decision. Previously registered churches must exchange their present 
certificates for new ones. "We believe it is our responsibility as 
Christians to serve and support all of our brothers and sisters in 
China, no matter where they worship," Wenzao Han, CCC executive vice 
president, said. 
...Thousands of China Christian Council congregations meet in homes, 
which CCC leaders refer to as "meeting points." But many thousands of 
other house groups have chosen not to become part of the CCC for 
doctrinal, political, or other reasons. Many of these independent house 
churches have been targeted in government crackdowns this year, 
apparently as part of an effort to prevent organized dissent and to 
minimize unauthorized contacts with foreigners. 
..."Legalization now is possible for groups that do not wish to be 
affiliated with the Three Self council," evangelist-educator Werner 
Burklin of Boca Raton, Fla., said. He has been visiting and ministering 
in China since 1981. Nine leaders of unregistered house churches from 
across China met with Burklin in Wuhan and briefed him on their 
situation. They are courageous people who love God deeply, Burklin 
said, "but they showed their utter contempt of the country's laws." 
Burklin attributed much of the leaders' hardship to their disregard of 
laws rather than to government disdain of their faith. 

Ten thousand Russians, including 5,000 Russian Jews, declared a new 
faith in Jesus Christ during a Messianic Jewish music festival at 
Moscow's Olympic Stadium in mid-May. More than 30,000 people attended. 
Musicians included the group Kol Simcha, composer-singer Marty Goetz, 
and violinist Maurice Sklar, according to festival organizers Hear O 
Israel Ministries of Rochester, N.Y. The "fullscale sound and light 
production" was filmed for Russian national television. The highly 
publicized event drew opposition from anti-Semites and Hasidic Jews, 
according to HOI Director Jonathan Bernis. 
...Many of the 200 Russians who helped organize the event were converts 
from a similar festival in St. Petersburg last year (NIRR 6/14/93). 
About 80 Europeans, Americans, and Israelis also assisted with this 
year's production. A new Moscow congregation for Jewish and gentile 
believers formed after the festival and will be pastored by three 
Messianic leaders, two who are American and one who is Russian. Similar 
festivals are scheduled this year for Kiev, Ukraine, and Minsk, 
Byelorussia. 

Alexander Solzhenitsyn, 75, pledged to help bring about a spiritual 
revival in Russia and help establish true democracy. He made his 
comments at a news conference in Vladivostock after returning to Russia 
for the first time since his exile 20 years ago. "Without faith in God, 
a man is nothing," he said. However, he added, the spiritual revival 
Russia needs must be based on Russian values, not imported Western 
ones. He envisioned a key role for the Russian Orthodox Church in the 
nation's rebirth. 

Malta is hard ground for those carrying an evangelical message, 
according to Protestant ministers on the Mediterranean island south of 
Italy. Rob Malone, a regional official with InterVarsity Christian 
Fellowship, said there are four evangelical Protestant churches in 
Malta, serving fewer than 400 evangelicals in a country of 375,000 
people. Two Baptist fellowships, an Assemblies of God church, and an 
independent Pentecostal group are overwhelmed by a wave of Jehovah's 
Witnesses and a deep-seated Roman Catholic tradition embraced by more 
than 90% on the island. "It's ingrained in these people that being a 
good Maltese means being a Catholic, even a bad Catholic," Malone said. 
Those who become evangelicals are ostracized, and evangelistic 
literature sometimes is torn up and thrown on the ground, he said. "We 
just have to pray that the quality of teaching will enable the laity to 
mobilize themselves, like they see the Jehovah's Witnesses doing." 

Ten thousand Catholics and Protestants in Belfast, Northern Ireland, 
heard author and sociologist Tony Campolo preach about reconciliation 
with God, neighbors, and enemies. Tickets to the sold-out, five-night 
series of benefit lectures cost the equivalent of $5, and proceeds went 
to local charities. Meetings were held in Catholic and Protestant 
sections, and in the city center. More than 200 people a night 
registered decisions for Christ. Most attending were young. 
...Evangelicals have volunteered to occupy homes rebuilt in the 
formerly bombed-out no-man's-land between Catholic and Protestant 
communities, according to Campolo. Habitat for Humanity, which built 
the developments, hosted a dedication attended by Catholic and 
Protestant officials, who prayed together and acknowledged that 10 
years ago such a thing could not have happened. 

Catholic Canadians cheered, sang, and swayed during a passion play 
geared to teens at the Skydome in Toronto May 12. The event, which drew 
40,000 people, was the culmination of a vision-building "Journey of 
Hope" program organized by 16 Catholic school boards of Ontario, 
according to Christian Week. While 2,700 young people acted out scenes 
from Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension, backed by a 
2,000-voice youth choir, huge images flashed on the Jumbotron screen. 
When the organizing committee was searching for a way to address 
hopelessness among today's students, "our focus became Jesus," Kitty 
McGeilly, program coordinator, said. 

Some 62,000 men jammed the Indianapolis Hoosier Dome June 3-4 for the 
third of six Promise Keepers '94 conventions. Billed as the largest 
single gathering of men with the purpose of honoring Jesus Christ, the 
convention had no trouble competing for media and public attention on 
the same week as the Indianapolis 500 auto race and the NBA playoff 
series between the New York Knicks and Indiana Pacers. Quipped 
conference emcee Bob Horner, "We had to turn away over 16,000 and they 
ended up going to some basketball game on the other side of town." 
...More than 3,000 men responded to an altar call the first evening of 
the conference. Speakers included Joseph Stowell, president of 
Chicago's Moody Bible Institute; Bill Bright, founder and president of 
Campus Crusade for Christ; pastor Bill Hybels of Willow Creek Community 
Church, Barrington, Ill.; pastor Jeffrey Johnson of Eastern Star 
Baptist Church of Indianapolis; author Gary Smalley; Bishop George 
McKinney of St. Stephen's Church of God in Christ of San Diego; and 
Promise Keepers founder Bill McCartney. Steve Green, Larnelle Harris, 
and Steven Curtis Chapman made appearances. 
...The nation's hopes do not lie in Washington, but in Jesus Christ, 
said Republican Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana, for which he received a 
2-minute standing ovation. John Maxwell, pastor of Skyline Wesleyan 
Church of San Diego, listed guidelines for dealing with sexual 
temptation. 
...At one point, Maxwell was overcome with emotion, and a hush settled 
over the animated crowd. After a few moments, a voice from the far 
reaches of the stadium shouted, "We love you, John!" causing an 
outbreak of applause characteristic of the event: men helping men live 
for God. 

Spiritual and physical shaking was going on at Luis Palau's crusade 
June 1-5 in Van Nuys, Calif. The event drew 54,100 people, and was 
reportedly the first cross-denominational crusade ever held in the San 
Fernando Valley. Some 215 churches from 25 denominations helped plan 
the event. An hour and one minute after the crusade began, a 3.7 tremor 
shook the city, which had been the epicenter of a major earthquake Jan. 
17. The opening-night tremor reminded everyone in Tom Bradley Stadium, 
where the crusade was held, of God's tremendous power, said Fred Baye, 
director of crusade media and public affairs for the Luis Palau 
Evangelistic Association. Baye said 2,184 people came forward during 
the crusade to make decisions for Christ. Many Christians in the valley 
see the crusade as an impetus for evangelism, he said. Musicians at the 
crusade included Smokey Robinson, Leon Patillo, Steve and Linda Tavani, 
the Newsboys, rap group Limit X, and Darlene Koldenhoven. Actor Dean 
Jones also gave his testimony. 

An institute for church planting in the Pacific Northwest is being 
formed in Portland by representatives of some 30 denominations. The 
institute is an outgrowth of meetings held since last April among 
leaders wishing to plant churches for an expected wave of new converts. 
"Since God intends to bring revival," as evidenced by the "massive 
movement of prayer" in the United States, "we must begin to prepare 
culturally appropriate churches for those converts now," said Jack 
Dennison, professor of pastoral ministries at Multnomah Seminary and a 
leader of the group. 
...House churches will comprise the next wave of growth in the church 
in the United States, Dennison said. They will begin as "houses of 
prayer," or groups of local Christians who commit themselves to pray 
for their neighbors and develop friendships with them. One advantage is 
that no money, new facilities, or land are needed, he said. Also, 
houses of prayer provide a family focus for evangelism and a model of 
unity in the Body of Christ, since Christians from several 
denominations are involved, he told NIRR. Some will grow into 
full-sized churches. 

Jews for Jesus strongly denied an accusation, made in Modern Maturity 
magazine, that it uses cult-like recruiting techniques. The publication 
is sent to the 30 million members of the American Association of 
Retired Persons. An article by free-lance writers Catherine Collins and 
Douglas Frantz quotes former Jews for Jesus member Ellen Kamentsky as 
saying seniors are perfect targets because they are "easy to influence, 
often home, plentiful, and lonely." In her 1992 book, Hawking God, 
Kamentsky tells how she wandered through nursing homes to prey on older 
people trying to adjust to life changes. 
...Jews for Jesus is "reeling" from the accusation, said Bob 
Mendelsohn, the group's District of Columbia branch leader. If 
Kamentsky's story is true, she violated Jews for Jesus policy, which is 
to visit individuals in nursing homes only when invited, he said. 
Mendelsohn said the article implies Jews for Jesus seeks to swindle 
seniors out of their savings. "Our policy is never to accept donations 
from unbelievers or to accept them when we are ministering in public," 
Mendelsohn said. 

More than 10,000 radio listeners pray for troubled teen-agers who call 
a Christian help line. "The healthy and the hurting" listen to the 
national weekly call-in radio show, host Dawson McAllister told 
Religious Broadcasting magazine. He asks listeners of his live program 
to pray at least 20 days a month for a specific teen-ager who has 
called the off-air, toll-free line. Prayer partners often offer their 
homes, money, travel, or whatever else is needed to help the hurting 
teens. The program receives 3,900 calls for help each month. 

Southern California's "raves" -secret, all-night, drug-and-dancing 
parties -- provide witnessing opportunities for members of Calvary 
Chapel in Costa Mesa, Calif. Tracy Herman, assistant to the church's 
assistant pastor Oden Fong, said the parties draw as many as 3,000 
people in their teens to mid-20s to abandoned warehouses or Indian 
reservations. Partiers dance, often alone, to the monotonous beat of 
techno music. They also take designer drugs, use virtual-reality 
devices, and dress according to a party theme, such as Alice in 
Wonderland. Often there is no lighting, except for strobes and lasers, 
and "there are no rules," Herman said. At the raves, the evangelists 
hand out "really hip tracts" and talk to the partiers, many of whom 
have never heard the gospel, she said. Response to the gospel at the 
raves is almost always positive, she said. 
..."Most of the people in our group look like them," Herman said. The 
Calvary Chapel movement has spread to 523 churches in the United 
States, and 82 more worldwide, drawing many young and counter-cultural 
individuals. The Costa Mesa church has a weekly attendance of 20,000. 
Fong, 43, also witnesses at the raves and is well-accepted by the 
partiers. The Chinese-American pastor heavily used LSD before becoming 
a Christian. 

AIDS activists from 12 denominational and Jewish ministries formed the 
Council of National Religious AIDS Networks. The purpose is to enlist 
grass-roots church and synagogue members to care for people with HIV or 
AIDS. The group forged an interfaith declaration at its initial meeting 
in Washington, D.C. The document, which will be circulated among 
churches and synagogues for their members' signatures, calls on signers 
to seek compassion, love, and justice for people with AIDS, their 
families, and their loved ones, and to promote prevention of the 
disease. The ministries will add their databases to the AIDS National 
Interfaith Network, a group of AIDS ministries around the country 
founded in 1988. 
...The first full-time AIDS chaplain at the University of Alabama at 
Birmingham describes himself as a former "typical Southern homophobe." 
Malcolm Marler, a married Southern Baptist and one-time cornerback at 
Clemson University, counsels 1,000 AIDS outpatients at the UAB School 
of Medicine's clinic. "All the issues the church recoils from" -- such 
as sex, infidelity, homosexuality, promiscuity, and drug addiction -- 
are contained in the disease, he told Associated Baptist Press. Some 
patients come to Marler because they are afraid to tell their pastors 
they are HIV-positive, he said. 

Jimmy Swaggart's ministry is sinking, according to an Associated Press 
report. Ratings for his weekly TV program, once viewed by 3 million 
Americans, is down to about 100,000 households, according to Arbitron. 
His ministry was $4.5 million in the red in 1991, the latest year for 
which tax records are available, AP said. Courts since have ordered 
judgments totaling more than $3 million in several lawsuits (NIRR 2/21) 
against Swaggart and his ministry. At the ministry's $100 million 
complex in Baton Rouge, La., a state agency pays $2 million a year to 
lease several buildings. Meeting halls are rented for business 
conferences and a local hospital. A Baptist church, and a day-care 
center also rent space, AP reported. An unfinished 12-story dormitory 
for the once-flourishing Bible college sits abandoned, while enrollment 
at the school is down by more than 75%. A health and fitness center, 
built for the school's students, sells memberships to the public. 

Jim Bakker's former aide in the PTL ministry has established a 
legaldefense fund for the jailed son of Florida Pentecostal pastor Karl 
Strader, according to The Ledger of Lakeland. Richard Dortch of Tampa 
Bay set up the fund, saying family friend Daniel Strader, 36, lacks 
money to pay a lawyer. Strader has been charged by the Florida State 
Attorney's office with numerous felonies in a pyramid scheme involving 
$3.7 million in investments belonging to 64 mostly elderly Floridians, 
including parishioners at his father's church. His bail has been set at 
$3.5 million. 
...The elder Strader, pastor of the Carpenter's Home Church in 
Lakeland, claimed the media and government already have presumed that 
his son, head of Interstate Investment Services, is guilty. The younger 
Strader, a graduate of Oral Roberts University, had paid some of the 
money owed and with a heart "still tender toward God" would repay more 
if he gets the opportunity, his father said. Arraignment is June 20. 

Nigerian con artists still are targeting U.S. churches with 
sudden-windfall pitches. In one recent case, a letter purportedly from 
a law office in Lagos informed St. Joseph's Cathedral in Sioux Falls, 
S.D., that a man died leaving the church $3 million in his will. The 
letter said $90,000 was needed to pay taxes before the money could be 
released. The Sioux Falls diocese wired the money to Nigeria, and 
parish priest Donald Kettler made plans to travel there to pick up the 
bequest. However, church officials began hearing of similar stories 
from religious organizations in other states, involving the same 
Nigerian contacts. 
...Kettler canceled his trip, and the diocese began proceedings to 
recover its money. Luckily, he said, the diocese had arranged for the 
wire transfer to be deposited only in an official government account, 
with carefully worded conditions requiring the bequest to be 
legitimate. A U.S. Attorney told reporters that the Internal Revenue 
Service and a Justice Department task force are investigating. Scams 
operating out of Nigeria have targeted mission groups for the past 
several years (NIRR 5/6/91). 

Dutch addicts take drugs in church, and also sell them. In the 
Netherlands, addiction is treated as a medical problem rather than a 
crime, and laws against selling heroin and cocaine seldom are enforced. 
The Dutch Protestant Pauluskerk in Rotterdam has ministered to 
hard-drug users for 15 years, providing food and shelter for hundreds 
of addicts. Drug use at the center has been tolerated for four years, 
but dealing has always been banned. Because of violent episodes with 
dealers, pastor Hans Visser recently invited them to make sales at the 
church as long as there is no violence and no mixing of drugs with 
dangerous chemicals. Visser also accepted contributions from the 
dealers, which he has given to tax authorities. 
..."Many people may think I'm wrong, but in private, police and local 
government agree with me," Visser told Reuters. The policy has been 
successful, he said. Visser wants to make hard drugs legal and take the 
drug industry away from the trafficking Mafia, he said. 

Moral and spiritual decline is increasing in the United States, 75% of 
American adults said in a Newsweek poll. Respondents ranked crime, 
drugs, family breakups, and low moral and ethical standards as the 
problems that concern them most, the magazine said in its June 13 
issue. Some 72% of respondents said they believe lingering questions 
about President Clinton's character have hurt his ability to exert 
moral leadership. As examples of good role models, Billy Graham and 
retired Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin Powell came out on top, 
with each selected by more than 60% of the respondents. 

A landlady who refused to rent an apartment to an unmarried couple 
because of her belief that sex outside of marriage is a sin has been 
vindicated in a California appeals court. The ruling overturned a 1989 
finding by the state's Fair Employment and Housing Commission that 
Evelyn Smith of Chico, a 61-year-old Presbyterian, was guilty of 
violating antidiscrimination laws. She was ordered to post a statement 
in her rental units saying she would not discriminate against unmarried 
couples, and to pay a $954 fine. The three-judge panel of the Third 
District Court of Appeals said that protecting unmarried couples 
against housing discrimination is not a "compelling state interest," 
and state law must give way to the "exercise of her fundamental 
rights." 

Two of three Southerners believe the Bible is not only literally, but 
historically and scientifically, true, an Atlanta Journal-Constitution 
survey found. Outside the South, this belief falls to 52%. Eight of 10 
Southerners say angels exist and believe in the devil. Also:  92% say 
adultery is wrong, but only 48% say it is immoral to fantasize sexually 
about a man or woman other than one's spouse.  82% prayed and 47% read 
the Bible in the past week.  53% say the United States is a Christian 
nation and that government should pass laws to support that idea. 
Outside the South, two-thirds disagree with that viewpoint. 
...Evangelism is not a priority for many Christians, the poll found. 
Only 32% of Christians outside the South, and 52% of Southerners, 
agreed that converting people to the faith is a "very important" 
activity for the church. Listed as "very important" activities by 
Southern respondents (two-thirds of those polled): providing moral 
guidance for young people (91%), worshiping (87%), and helping the 
needy (86%). 

Anti-gambling activists from a dozen denominations last month launched 
the National Coalition Against Gambling. The "campaign of moral 
resistance" will work against "the alarming proliferation" of gambling 
across the United States, organizers said. Some 70 clergy and laity 
attended a Chicago conference, sponsored by the United Methodist Board 
of Church and Society, which launched the campaign. Most of those at 
the conference have been active in grassroots movements opposing 
state-sponsored lotteries, horse racing, off-track betting, riverboat 
gambling, landbased casinos, and legalized video poker. Several said 
they had family members whose personal lives and careers had been 
wrecked by a gambling compulsion, United Methodist News Service said. 

"Mentor" programs, which match role models with troubled teens, are 
growing in popularity in churches, according to USA Today. Those 
involved include national leaders such as Jesse Jackson, who is pushing 
his "Reclaim Our Youth" program to predominantly black churches coast 
to coast. Frank Tucker of Church Association for Community Service has 
linked more than 50 churches to provide mentors in Washington, D.C. 
...One boy symbolizes the nation's despair and hope over juvenile 
crime. Percy Campbell of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., was called "Crime Boy" 
for his 57 arrests by the age of 12. Then, with the help of Dennis 
Grant, an elder at Fellowship Center Church, he began to be known as 
"Church Boy," his dramatic change recorded at a party marking one year 
free of crime. Now some are dubbing him "Backslide Boy" after a recent 
arrest for breaking into a shed to steal a bike. People want to see 
Campbell's saga end happily, but real life for him, and thousands of 
other young people, is not so simple, Grant told reporters. 

The Ecumenical Coalition on Women and Society intends to counteract the 
influence of "radical forms of feminism" in the church and society. The 
brand of feminism exemplified by last year's "RE-Imagining" conference 
(NIRR 5/2) threatens the social witness and theology of mainline 
churches, said Dianne Knippers, president of the Washington, D.C.-based 
Institute for Religion and Democracy. The IRD formed the coalition for 
those who believe that the Judeo-Christian tradition best protects the 
dignity and rights of women. A brochure introducing it is being 
distributed at United Methodist, Disciples of Christ, Presbyterian 
Church (USA), and Episcopal meetings this summer. 

The Orthodox Church in America has canonized a Pennsylvania priest. 
Alexis Toth was proclaimed a saint in April by the Holy Synod of 
Bishops. 
...Thousands of pilgrims from the United States and Canada came to St. 
Tikhon's Monastery in South Caanan, Pa., on May 29 to watch the 
canonization. Toth, who now is called St. Alexis of Wilkes-Barre, 
formed 17 churches during his ministry. He is only the second person in 
the United States to be canonized by the Church. The first was St. 
Herman, a monk in Alaska who was pronounced a saint by the Church in 
1970. 

Postage rates may increase by 20% in 1995 for non-profit organizations 
that send magazines, newsletters, and other periodicals at second-class 
rates. The Postal Service originally had sought only a 14% increase, 
according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy. Tax-exempt groups pay 
nonprofit rates on the editorial portion of their publications, and 
regular secondclass rates on advertising that makes up more than 10% of 
the publication. The increase is part of the Postal Service's request 
to raise rates for all mailers in 1995. A rate decision is due Jan. 8, 
and new rates would take effect in late January or February. 

Cardinal John O'Connor of New York warned that President Clinton's plan 
for employer-mandated health coverage, which includes abortion, "would 
make it impossible for Catholics to be Catholics." The Church employs 
700,000 workers, many of them in its 600 hospitals, 300 nursing homes, 
and hundreds of other health facilities around the country. Under 
federal mandate it could be required to pay for employee abortions. A 
"conscience clause" exemption in the plan is not strong enough to 
protect the church against lawsuits from employees demanding that 
abortions be covered, church leaders say. 
...U.S. Catholic leaders are ambivalent about Clinton's health-care 
plan. On one hand, they are calling for universal coverage, not just 
universal access; but on the other, they are demanding exclusion of 
abortion coverage, as Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago explained at 
the National Press Club in Washington last month. Both are integral to 
a Christian ethic supporting life, he suggested. Endorsing the 
government's role, he said, "We cannot rely on the [health-care] system 
to correct itself; without intervention, things are getting worse, not 
better." 

A boycott of Roussel-Uclaf, the French maker of the abortion drug 
RU-486, and its U.S. subsidiaries was announced by a coalition of 
groups opposed to abortion on demand, including the National Right to 
Life Committee and the Christian Life Commission of the Southern 
Baptist Convention. The coalition plans to release a products list, the 
CLC's James Smith said. 

Hardly was the ink dry on President Clinton's signature on the new 
Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, when the American Life 
League filed suit against it in federal district court in Alexandria, 
Va. The group asked for an injunction preventing enforcement of the 
law. ALL contends that FACE violates First Amendment guarantees of 
freedom of speech, assembly, and religion. Elsewhere in the country, 
several lawsuits against the act also were filed. 
...The White House, flooded with phone calls generated largely by a 
Christian Coalition campaign, used its enhanced voice-mail system to 
divert most calls to an automated comment line, the New York Times 
reported. The calls came from people seeking unsuccessfully to have 
Clinton veto the act. Many who asked to speak with senior officials by 
name were connected instead to a recorded message and told to leave a 
message or express opinions about selected issues by punching 
touch-tone numbers, the newspaper said. 
...The law "will have no effect on our plans or tactics...to picket, 
counsel, distribute literature, and rescue," Don Treshman of 
Houston-based Rescue America said. 

Pro-life protesters chained and cemented themselves to two cars 
blocking a Milwaukee abortion clinic June 4. They claimed they were the 
first to break the new FACE act signed into law on May 26. "It is wrong 
for any law to penalize lifesaving action," said Monica Migliorino 
Miller, spokeswoman for the two dozen demonstrators. Police arrested 
eight people on state charges of disorderly conduct. Federal 
prosecutors two days later charged six of them with violating FACE. A 
first offense carries a maximum penalty of six months in prison and a 
fine of up to $10,000. 

San Francisco police use of "paincompliance techniques" to arrest 
uncooperative pro-life demonstrators in 1989 was reasonable, a federal 
appeals court said in a 2-1 ruling. The decision upheld a jury's 
verdict in a lawsuit filed by six members of Operation Rescue. Police 
used a martialarts device known as nunchakus to squeeze the protesters' 
wrists and force them to move after their arrests. Dissenting Judge 
Andrew Kleinfeld said society cannot accept "brutality" as a response 
to this sort of non-violent protest, which was also practiced by 
Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. 

Ron Lewis, a Baptist minister, Christian bookstore owner, and newest 
Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives, said he will 
oppose new taxes, support cuts in federal spending, help pass crime 
legislation and welfare reform, and stop "the war on tobacco." Lewis 
won a Kentucky special election to replace Rep. William Natcher, who 
died last March after serving in the position for 40 years. Democrats 
had held the seat for more than 100 years. The election has brought the 
House of Representatives count to 256 Democrats and 178 Republicans. 
...Backed by an intense base of Christian conservatives, Oliver North 
was nominated as Virginia's GOP Senate candidate. The move has split 
the party and set the stage for an unpredictable and acrimonious 
campaign, observers say. North, whose three felony convictions for 
lying to Congress about the Iran-contra affair were later overturned, 
is considered a patriotic hero by some. "We send the Clintons and their 
cronies a simple but unmistakable message: this is our government, you 
stole it, and we're going to take it back," North said in his 
acceptance speech. 

Three Orthodox rabbis on Colorado's rabbinical council have split with 
the body after more than 50 years of working together. The split with 
the more-liberal rabbis came over the issues of abortion, assisted 
death, and homosexuality. Similar tensions in rabbinical councils in 
other parts of the country indicate more splits may be imminent, Rabbi 
Marc Angel, a leader of Orthodox Judaism, told Religious News Service. 

It's constitutional for Cleveland to rent space to the Catholic Church 
for a chapel at Hopkins International Airport, a federal appeals court 
in Cincinnati ruled. The local diocese has paid $100 a month plus 
utilities since it opened the chapel in 1986. Plaintiffs included 
Americans United for Separation of Church and State. The appeals court 
noted that chapels exist in at least 16 other U.S. airports. Two other 
federal appeals courts also ruled such chapels constitutional. 

Sikhs, Jews, and others cannot wear religious headdress in meeting 
halls of the Royal Canadian Legion, a war veterans group. The 2,500 
delegates at the Legion's convention in Calgary voted overwhelmingly to 
reject a proposed bylaw that would permit such headgear. Legion 
branches prohibit head coverings in their meeting places as a show of 
respect for those killed in war. "My legion is my temple, and in my 
temple they don't wear hats," a member told the convention. 

Illegal house churches in America? "It is my house, where I can have 
freedom to worship, and they won't let me," says Buddhist priest Thuong 
Thich Nguyen Tri. He is under pressure from his neighbors in Garden 
Grove, Calif., and a lawsuit by city officials for conducting services 
in his home. The city offered to settle the suit if he stops 
celebrating religious holidays at his house, removes a statue of Buddha 
from his front yard, and limits visitors to six at a time. As many as 
400 people gather at the house, some parking in nearby driveways. 
Ordinances call for a $500 penalty or six months in jail for operating 
a house of worship without permits. 

Bishop Knox can return to work as principal of a Jackson, Miss., high 
school pending an appeal by the school district, the Mississippi 
Supreme Court ruled. Knox had been suspended without pay last December 
for allowing students to read prayers over an intercom (NIRR 5/2). A 
county judge ruled in April that Knox had been wrongly disciplined and 
should be reinstated with back pay, and school officials appealed. 
Lawyers said it may take two years for the court to make a final ruling 
on Knox's pay and status, and to decide if the school district should 
have guidelines for classroom prayer. 

A state-mandated Good Friday holiday in Illinois schools is 
unconstitutional, a federal district judge in Chicago ruled in a 
lawsuit filed by a Chicago schoolteacher, with support from the 
American Jewish Congress. The holiday designation "conveys the 
impermissible message that Christianity is a favored religion," Judge 
Ann Williams said. Nevertheless, local school districts retain the 
right to schedule holidays, and most still will give pupils the day 
off, school officials and a spokesman for the attorney general's office 
told reporters. 

Students at six high schools and four elementary schools in Hawaii have 
been told they cannot use a Michael W. Smith song at their graduation 
and end-of-the-year ceremonies. According to the Rutherford Institute, 
the song Friends has been censored because it mentions the words "Lord" 
and "Father." Herman Aizawa, superintendent of schools, said he feared 
the schools would be open to lawsuits if they permit the lyrics to be 
played. After parents and students picketed outside Molokai High 
School, Aizawa told them the schools won't stop the students if they do 
something "impromptu" during graduation. 

Schools need not allow Sikh students to wear a small dagger, considered 
a symbol of religious devotion, a federal judge ruled in Sacramento, 
Calif. Khalsa Sikhs are required to wear a kirpan after they are 
baptized. School officials in Livingston, citing local and state policy 
banning knives on school grounds, refused to allow the children of a 
Sikh family to wear the sheathed blades under their garments. The 
parents sued, but Judge Garland Burrell, Jr., ruled the school 
district's interests "override [the family's] hardship." 

Unrest at Regent University: The school fired three law professors who 
had protested the removal of Law School Dean Herbert Titus last year 
(NIRR 4/4). Officials denied their ouster was a result of their 
protests. Paul Morken, Roger Bern, and Lionel Postic were dismissed 
because of "a lack of scholarship" and "a bad attitude," Dean J. Nelson 
Happy told reporter Mark O'Keefe of the Virginian-Pilot. The simmering 
dispute is over what Regent founder-chancellor Pat Robertson described 
as "a narrow definition of Christianity" at the law school that could 
prevent it from obtaining full accreditation from the American Bar 
Association. Observers say some Regent teachers adhere to 
Reconstructionism, which contends that the church should strive to set 
up a government regulated by biblical teachings and principles. During 
Regent's graduation ceremonies in Virginia Beach last month, a small 
plane circled overhead trailing a banner that said, "Reunite Us With 
Titus." Bern, Morken, and three current professors filed lawsuits 
charging that Regent's new teaching contracts and review procedures 
violate what they describe as long-standing tenure policy and threaten 
job security. 

Creationist views must be banned from science classes, the American 
Civil Liberties Union argued in suing a suburban Pittsburgh school 
district on behalf of two students and their parents. The case involves 
Warren Kooi, technology administrator of the Moon Area School District, 
who gave a guest lecture on creationism to a high school biology class 
studying evolution. Students the following day were asked to discuss 
their opinions of evolution and creationism. School officials said 
their intent was to present a broader picture to students and to 
examine creationism from a scientific perspective. The suit seeks a 
court order banning the teaching of creation theory, unspecified money 
damages, and attorneys' fees. 

An Aberdeen, Miss., couple and their former pastor pleaded guilty in 
the 1991 death of the couple's 13year-old diabetic daughter. Pastor 
Richard Vaden of the now-closed Grace Baptist Church counseled the 
couple to choose prayer over medical treatment, court documents said. 
The couple pleaded guilty to negligent manslaughter, and Vaden as an 
accessory before the fact. Authorities said they would be placed on 
probation. Vaden preached fasting and anointing as exclusive means of 
healing, a former church member told reporters. 

A sexual-misconduct judgment of $1.2 million against a diocese will 
stand. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review a decision of the 
Colorado Supreme Court against the Episcopal Diocese of Colorado and 
Bishop William Frey. The decision had declared them negligent in hiring 
and supervising Paul Robinson, an assistant priest who became sexually 
involved with a parishioner he counseled at St. Philip and St. James 
Episcopal Church in Denver. The diocese had psychological reports that 
gave it a reason to believe the minister should not counsel vulnerable 
individuals, the court said. The Colorado Council of Churches and 
several other religious organizations filed briefs arguing that the 
ruling amounts to unconstitutional government interference in how 
religious organizations hire and supervise their employees. 

A San Diego grand jury said parents and therapists prodded nine 3and 
4-year-olds into concocting allegations of sexual abuse and other 
offenses. The charges were leveled against Dale Akiki, a former Sunday 
school teacher at Faith Chapel, an evangelical church in suburban 
Spring Valley. After seven months of testimony about animal sacrifice, 
ritual torture, kidnapping, and infant slaughter that supposedly took 
place in 1988 and 1989, a jury acquitted Akiki last November after 
deliberating just seven hours. He had been held in custody for more 
than two years. County supervisors asked the grand jury to investigate 
handling of the case, and it issued its report June 1. The panel 
criticized District Attorney Ed Miller for failure to supervise his 
deputies, some of whom believed that satanic ritual abuse was 
widespread. 

Satanic ritual abuse of children in Britain is a myth, the country's 
government said after an investigation found no evidence of it in 84 
alleged cases it studied. Sociologist Jean La Fontaine, who teaches at 
the London School of Economics, was commissioned in 1991 to investigate 
the claims. Allegations ranged from human sacrifice and cannibalism to 
sexual abuse of children as an act of devil worship or witchcraft. Part 
of the blame, she said, rests on Christian fundamentalists who 
emphasize the dangers of Satanism. Most British child abuse is found in 
families and networks of pedophiles, she said. 

Thousands of families died trapped and cowering in village churches in 
Rwanda. The victims had fled there for protection, said Roger Winter, 
director of the U.S. Committee for Refugees, a private humanitarian 
agency. From May 15-18, Winter traveled 300 miles in Rwanda. He wrote 
in The Washington Post that in many churches in many towns, refugees' 
bodies were ripped by the fragments of hand grenades lobbed through 
church windows. Others were hacked to death with machetes. "Now the 
church steeples towering over most hushed towns have been transformed 
into markers that fix locations of entrapment and slaughter." 

A court in Bangladesh ordered the arrest of Muslim novelist Taslima 
Nasreen, 31. Police charged her with maliciously "outraging the 
religious feeling of the Muslims" after a newspaper reported that she 
favored revising the Koran. Nasreen, who went into hiding, said she was 
misquoted by the newspaper, but added that she does favor changes in 
the Sharia, the strict Islamic legal code, to give Muslim women more 
rights. An Islamic group last year offered a reward of $1,250 for her 
death as punishment for her book, Shame, which describes the plight of 
the Hindu minorities in Muslim Bangladesh. 

Three missionaries still held hostage by guerrillas in Panama were 
named 1994 Missionaries of the Year by Under His Wings Ministries of 
Williamsport, Pa. David Mankins, Mark Rich, and Richard Tenenoff are 
with New Tribes Mission, based in Sanford, Fla. They served the Kuna 
Indians in Pucuro, and had a growing group of believers when kidnapped 
on Jan. 31, 1993 (NIRR 2/7). 
...Relatives and colleagues of the men have had "many heavy days and 
heavy hearts" since the abduction, said Mel Wyma, foreign secretary of 
New Tribes and the grandfather of Rich's wife. Wyma said the group 
listens for radio messages from the captors, but has heard nothing 
since January. Before that, the kidnappers maintained contact, 
demanding ransom, and threatening the hostages. 

Christy isn't on CBS' fall television schedule, but 13 new episodes 
will be used as a mid-season replacement, the network announced. The 
series drew good ratings and a devoted following among Christians. It 
is based on Catherine Marshall's book about the life of her mother. 
about the life of her mother.

Murders have diminished inside a Medell n, Colombia, prison, plummeting 
from 600 to one annually. The dramatic reform in the maximumsecurity 
Bellavista Prison came through preacher Oscar Osorio, according to News 
Network International. For 11 years, Osorio repeatedly risked his life 
to tell inmates about Christ. The conversion of a few hundred among 
4,000 inmates has ended riots and transformed the prison, which holds 
violent criminals. Inmates painted over images of corpses and weapons 
drawn on the walls with human blood. Several converts are studying for 
Christian ministry. In 1992, the Minister of Justice made Osorio the 
first Protestant appointed to a public chaplaincy in Colombia. Late 
last year, the National Director of Prisons allowed Christian inmates 
to transfer to other prisons targeted for evangelism. 

Jeffrey Dahmer "wanted his sins washed away," said Roy Ratcliff, the 
Church of Christ minister who baptized him. The serial killer was 
immersed in a whirlpool at Columbia Correctional Center in southeast 
Wisconsin. He is serving 16 consecutive life sentences after being 
convicted in 1992 of killing 17 young men. Dahmer, 33, sometimes 
dismembered and ate parts of his victims. 
...Dahmer became interested in religion after a Virginia woman sent him 
information about a Bible-study course, news reports said. Ratcliff met 
with Dahmer in April to assess his commitment. The inmate appeared to 
be at peace with himself and convinced Ratcliff that "he wanted God in 
his life." The baptism also was attended by the prison chaplain and two 
security officers. 

A former narcotics investigator was honored for his work as a prison 
chaplain. Karl Holsberg was named 1993 Chaplain of the Year by Fairfax, 
Va.-based Good News Jail and Prison Ministry. The group trains and 
places chaplains in the United States and four foreign countries. 
...Holsberg once was known as "Narc Angel" in the drug world for 
helping people, whom he had put in jail, to enter rehabilitation 
programs. An ordained Congregational minister, he directs CONCORD 
Ministries, a drug-and-alcohol abuse ministry headquartered in Herndon, 
Va. As senior chaplain of the Fairfax Country Jail, Holsberg helps 
15,000 inmates each year. He oversees 30 weekly worship services and 
266 volunteers from 50 churches. Holsberg spends 50 hours a week inside 
the jail, and additional time seeking contributions and volunteers for 
the ministry. His wife, Robbie, coordinates 40 volunteers from local 
churches who minister to female inmates. 

More than 50,000 men attended the Promise Keepers conference in Anaheim 
Stadium May 13-14. It was the first of six Promise Keepers '94 
conferences (NIRR 5/2). About 5,000 men made a first-time commitment to 
Christ, or renewed their commitments, when Santa Ana, Calif., pastor 
Daniel de Leon challenged the crowd to return to God. Pastors E.V. 
Hill, Chuck Smith, Jack Hayford, Charles Blake, Chuck Swindoll, and 
Promise Keepers founder Bill McCartney were the other keynote speakers. 
...Singers Larnelle Harris, who is black, and Steve Green, who is 
white, wrote a song for the conferences and performed it publicly for 
the first time. At one point in the song, Green turned to Harris and 
sang alone: "For our nation's shameful sin, I need to ask your 
forgiveness." Harris and Green joined in the chorus for which the song 
was named, "Teach Me to Love." Men in the stadium wiped away tears as 
the singers embraced. 
...The only woman to take the stage, Connie Schaedel, described the 
impact Promise Keepers had on her husband, Bud. Last summer, Bud 
returned from the convention in Boulder, Colo., "on fire," she said. He 
urged men in his Whittier, Calif., church to attend this year, and also 
made his own reservations. But he died of cancer 18 days before the 
event. His son-in-law attended in his place, and with him were 250 men 
from his church wearing badges that read "In Memory of Bud Schaedel." 
Connie concluded her remarks with a thank you -- for the joy her 
husband experienced as a Promise Keeper, and for the joy she 
experienced as a "promise reaper." During the final session, Schaedel's 
son-in-law made a personal commitment to God. 

Lutherans are targeting Latino communities in Philadelphia for 
evangelism. Susan Ericksson, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Synod's 
assistant to the bishop for urban ministry of the Evangelical Lutheran 
Church in America, said members of established Philadelphia 
congregations are brainstorming for ministries to attract Latinos, a 
growing segment of their communities. The regional ELCA recently 
planted a Hispanic Church in Northeast Philadelphia. 
...Parishioners of the new Iglesia Luterana Nueva Creacion have been 
out of the Catholic Church awhile, pastor Patrick Cabello Hansel told 
NIRR. A study of the city's Hispanic Protestant churches shows that 
parishioners in smaller churches do not "feel like faceless 
statistics." Temple University researcher Edwin Aponte said the pastors 
know and care for each family. These churches have increased from 40 to 
85 in 10 years. 

The Way International is making a comeback after years of numerical and 
financial decline, and internal strife. Outside its own circles, the 
group is widely considered to be a cult because of its non-trinitarian 
theology and alleged use of mindcontrol techniques. Its doctrinal 
language mirrors orthodox Christianity, but beliefs include the concept 
that Jesus is the son of God, but not God the Son. Bill Greene, a 
member of the Trustee Cabinet of the Way International, told NIRR that 
The Way teaches that Jesus is not God, but that allegations about use 
of mind-control techniques, threats, or other manipulation are 
unfounded. I could leave today and "not fear for my life, my safety, or 
the safety of the members of my family," he said. 
...The group aggressively proselytizes on virtually every campus in the 
nation, according to Hal Mansfield of the Fort Collins, Colo.-based 
Religious Movement Resource Center, an affiliate of United Campus 
Ministries. Mansfield said he routinely gets calls from students 
concerned about their friends' deepening involvement with the group. 
Greene said The Way has no organized college outreach, but acknowledged 
that individual members of local groups witness one-on-one. 

Christian music video channel Z Music has been purchased by Gaylord 
Entertainment, which owns TNN (The Nashville Network) and is majority 
owner of CMT (Country Music Television). Gaylord paid an undisclosed 
price to buy an option for purchase of 95% of the 1993 upstart. It will 
take over management of the cable network immediately, Gaylord 
officials announced. They said they will move Z Music headquarters to 
Nashville from Lake Helen, Fla., and work to increase the subscriber 
base. Contemporary Christian music is one of the fastest-growing 
segments in the record industry today, Gaylord President E.W. Wendell 
said. Z Music is in markets reaching 10 million households, including 1 
million cable subscribers. In contrast, TNN reaches 58 million 
households and CMT reaches 25 million. 

Billy Graham plans the "most farreaching evangelistic outreach in the 
history of the church." On March 1618, 1995, a crusade in San Juan, 
Puerto Rico, will be broadcast by satellite to 165 countries in 50 
languages. A three-day Christian Workers Conference also will be 
transmitted with the crusade. 
...Increasing hostility will confront the evangelical church throughout 
the world, Graham told an audience at his alma mater, Wheaton College. 
He spoke May 14 during the opening of the newly renovated museum that 
bears his name. The museum now features additional exhibits on the 
history of evangelism in America. 

American GIs are returning to Vietnam as builders and healers. In the 
past three years, 200 war veterans and their families have traveled at 
their own expense to give humanitarian aid through S. Lake Tahoe, 
Calif.based Vets with a Mission. These evangelical Christians, most in 
their 40s and 50s, are doctors, educators, business leaders, and clergy 
from various denominations. 
...The groups have built primary health-care centers and clinics, 
delivered $6 million of medical supplies, distributed 10,000 
Vietnamese-language Bibles, and financed an orphanage. Although a third 
of the volunteers have no military experience, others visit old 
battlefields and meet former enemies. Groups make the trip in January 
and June each year. 

One thousand Britons and Irish are responding daily to an evangelistic 
mailing by Reinhard Bonnke Ministries. RBM mailed a booklet to the 23.7 
million households in Great Britain and Ireland the last week of March. 
In early May, RBM's U.S. director, Ron Shaw, said the group had 
received 20,000 response cards indicating the senders had become 
Christians as a result of reading the booklet. With the help of 1,200 
volunteers, an RBM staff of 15 in England was sending 
computer-generated reply letters to link each respondent with the 
minister of one of 15,000 volunteering churches. The organization plans 
similar efforts in other European nations and the United States. 

A Pentecostal association has been formed by Native Canadian Christians 
in Ontario and Quebec. First Nations Fellowship elected a board of 
elders and appointed Simeon Trapper as general overseer of the group, 
which is based at the National Native Bible College on the Tyendinaga 
Mohawk Territory near Desoronto, Ont. FNF includes representatives of 
the Cree, Chippewa, Cayuga, Mohawk, Oneida, and Ojibway nations. Its 
purpose is to encourage cooperation among churches, ministries, and 
native leaders. FNF also will provide Bible training for crisis and 
substance-abuse counseling, treasurer Adrian Jacobs said. 

Forced to resign: two executives of the National Council of Churches in 
the aftermath of the $8 million loss of NCC funds in an investment scam 
(NIRR 4/4). The pair are Emilio Carrillo, director of the NCC's Office 
of Human Resources, and his boss, Robert Soong, who headed the Office 
of Finance and Administration. Officials said Carrillo placed the funds 
without proper authorization, but with Soong's knowledge, with Libra, a 
small investment firm in Reston, Va. Libra supposedly used the $8 
million to buy questionable notes issued by a Czech bank, contrary to 
warnings by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. NCC President 
Joan Campbell told Religious News Service an audit found that neither 
Carrillo nor Soong benefited personally from the venture. The pair, 
suspended after disclosure of the loss, will get severance packages, 
officials indicated. 

A looming financial crisis for the Church of England may lead to 
closure of churches throughout England, especially in poorer dioceses, 
and the layoff of some of the denomination's 11,000 clergy, some 
observers warn. The crunch stems from losses estimated at $1.9 billion 
from property investments in the 1980s by the Church Commissioners, the 
charity that manages church investments. Net income for 1993 fell 4%, 
to the equivalent of $232.5 million, Commissioners' figures show. The 
denomination receives no state aid, and it relies on the Commissioners 
for a quarter of its $900.6 million operating costs. The charity pays 
for the $104.2 million cost of pensions for 10,600 clergy and helps pay 
clergy salaries. However, its contribution to salary subsidies fell to 
$87.06 million, or about 37% of its 1993 income. An added burden is 
about $4.5 million in stipends over three years for some 200 clergy 
leaving the church because they disagree with the church's new policy 
of ordaining women priests. Those over age 50 in that group are being 
given early retirement and a pension. 

Regular churchgoers could be headed for the endangered species list, if 
trends found by a Louis Harris poll continue. The number of adults 
saying they attend church, synagogue, or other houses of worship at 
least weekly dropped from 51% in 1986 to 43% in 1994. Those attending 
less than monthly increased from 14% to 19% in the same period, and 23% 
of respondents said they never attend church, up from 21%. Church 
attendance is "notoriously overreported as a socially desirable 
activity, so true attendance figures are surely lower than those 
reported," Harris President Humphrey Taylor said. 

Cooperative Baptist Fellowship will encourage its churches to donate 
money to Fellowship-endorsed seminaries rather than Southern Baptist 
Convention ones. The Fellowship, formed in 1990 by SBC moderates, took 
the action at its annual meeting in Greensboro, N.C. CBF members were 
angered by the March 9 firing of popular (Southern) Baptist seminary 
President Russell Dilday (NIRR 4/4). Last year, Fellowship members sent 
$493,037 to SBC seminaries, all of which now are controlled by 
conservatives. Another $268,004 was sent to two new seminaries created 
by moderates -- Baptist Theological Seminary at Richmond (Va.), and 
Truett Seminary at Baylor University. 

Three-day revivals in packed sanctuaries around the country are 
conducted almost weekly by the pastor of the country's largest United 
Church of Christ congregation. Jeremiah Wright, Jr., leads 6,000-member 
Trinity UCC in Chicago. He may be one of the only ministers in the 
generally liberal UCC who follows the example of Congregational 
revivalist Jonathan Edwards, United Church News said. Wright, reputedly 
a forceful orator, usually preaches in churches other than the UCC. 
Most invitations come from Methodists, Presbyterians, Baptists, and 
Pentecostals. 

Resigned: Mary Ann Lundy, a Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) official and 
chief target of critics of last fall's ecumenical "RE-Imagining" 
conference" on feminist theology in Minneapolis (NIRR 5/2). Lundy 
directed the Women's Ministry Unit when the conference was being 
planned, and advised the planning committee. 
...The announced departure came a week after James Andrews, stated 
clerk of the General Assembly, wrote a 12-page letter to local and 
regional PCUSA leaders and executives. He warned that the RE-Imagining 
dispute had plunged the 2.8-million-member church into a crisis that 
may create a damaging and permanent upheaval. He described RE-Imagining 
as "christologically inadequate," but contended that it was important 
to recognize its experimental nature. The denomination's General 
Assembly is scheduled in mid-June. 

 United Methodist bishops say they'll become more active in teaching 
doctrine. Meeting in Rochester, N.Y., they affirmed a doctrinal 
commitment to historic Christian faith. In response to what the bishops 
termed "doctrinal ferment," they will conduct a theological analysis of 
the concepts of wisdom in the Bible. The action was seen as a response 
to alleged worship of Sophia, the goddess of wisdom, at last year's 
"RE-Imagining conference" (NIRR 5/2). The bishops' findings are to be 
presented at their October meeting. The bishops urged United Methodists 
to discuss their differences in the Wesleyan tradition: in essentials, 
unity; in non-essentials, freedom; and in all things, charity. 
...The bishops are not willing to offend anybody, retired Bishop 
William Cannon said. The bishops' action was totally inadequate, he 
said, calling on them to publicly repudiate the conference. 

Pastors' Prayer Summits have spread across the country and are headed 
overseas. This year, summits are being held in 62 cities across the 
United States and Canada. Many other cities and 15 foreign countries -- 
including Japan, South Africa, India, Colombia, Brazil, Australia, 
Argentina, and Chile -- have scheduled or inquired about the summits, 
organizers say. The four-day summits are interdenominational 
prayer-and-worship retreats for pastors and other Christian leaders. 
Many who attend say divisions, competition, and jealousy among pastors 
are broken down. Summits often are life-changing experiences where 
disheartened pastors are rejuvenated, others say. The first such summit 
was organized by Multnomah Bible College's Joe Aldrich in Salem, Ore., 
in 1989 (NIRR Special Report 10/8/90). Today, 36 facilitators from a 
variety of parachurch groups and churches help run the summits. 
...A "desperation for God" that exists among pastors today accounts for 
the popularity of Pastors' Prayer Summits, said Terry Dirks. He is vice 
president under Aldrich at Portlandbased International Renewal 
Ministries, formerly called Northwest Renewal Ministries. Pastors have 
"done the best that man can do" and are hungry for "a true, holy, 
heaven-sent revival," he said. The meetings also have sparked the 
growth of pastors' prayer groups in many cities, Dirks told NIRR. 

President Bill Clinton prayed with National Day of Prayer leaders in 
the Oval Office on May 4. Shirley Dobson and Kay Parker of the National 
Day of Prayer, David Bryant of Concerts of Prayer, Vonette Bright of 
Campus Crusade for Christ, Dick Eastman of Every Home for Christ, and 
National Prayer Breakfast organizer Doug Coe stood in a circle with 
Clinton in front of his desk and had "a beautiful time of prayer" for 
about 20 minutes, Eastman said. 
...The group prayed for Clinton, not at him, Eastman said. The prayer 
leaders went as "simple believers to pray for our president in 
accordance with the Lord's directive." Each person who prayed cited 
Scriptures about leadership. Clinton, who did not pray aloud, expressed 
appreciation and seemed moved, Eastman said. The invitation to the Oval 
Office was arranged by one of the president's assistants. Clinton made 
time for the leaders, who were meeting nearby to prepare for the 
National Day of Prayer the next day. 

Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee who is suing President 
Clinton for alleged sexual harassment, has a legal defense fund. 
Abortion opponent Pat Mahoney announced that his group, the Christian 
Defense Coalition, has established the fund. Mahoney told reporters he 
was angry that the CDC had to do what the National Organization for 
Women should have done. 
..."We will not take the right wing's bait by heralding or attacking 
either person," NOW President Patricia Ireland said. Jones and Clinton 
deserve their day in court, she said. Mahoney predicted that Jones' 
legal fees could surpass $100,000, and that contributions would go to 
her two lawyers. 

Religion should be excluded as a category from proposed guidelines of 
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on discrimination in the 
workplace, because the guidelines "may result in a workplace in which 
religious expression and religious freedom are suppressed." So says 
Rep. Howard P. "Buck" McKeon (RCalif.). After complaints from dozens of 
members of Congress and thousands of citizens, the EEOC reopened the 
period for public comment on the guidelines until June 13 (NIRR 5/2). 
...Last fall the commission expanded the guidelines as adapted for sex 
discrimination to other areas covered by Title VII of the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964, including religion. The guidelines define harassment as 
"verbal or physical conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or 
aversion toward an individual." Critics warned that Christians and 
other religious believers could be sued for discussing their faith with 
co-workers. Lawyers who talked with EEOC members said they were told 
religion would be removed. Nevertheless, the Senate Judiciary Committee 
scheduled a hearing on the guidelines for June 9. 

The Supreme Court declined to review a St. Paul, Minn., case in which a 
potential juror was excluded because of his religion. The black juror 
in a criminal trial involving a black defendant, was a Jehovah's 
Witness. The prosecutor, asked to explain her peremptory strike, said 
she had found in her experience that Jehovah's Witnesses "are reluctant 
to exercise authority over their fellow human beings in this 
courthouse." The judge accepted her explanation, the defendant later 
was found guilty, and the conviction was upheld on appeal. In the 
Supreme Court deliberations, Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin 
Scalia dissented, saying the case should have been taken. They cited 
cases in which the high court had refused to allow exclusion of jurors 
based on race and gender. On the majority side, Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsberg said the Minnesota Supreme Court, in upholding the conviction, 
observed that religious affiliation is not as evident as race or 
gender, and that ordinarily, an inquiry into religious beliefs is 
improper. 

Taking a stand on religious freedom, the Justice Department sided with 
students wanting Bible clubs in high schools, upheld as a right under 
federal law, but being disputed by school administrators. The 
department filed a friend-of-the-court brief in federal appeals court 
backing the right of Melanie Ceniceros to convene a lunchtime Bible 
club at San Diego's University City High School. A lower court, 
supporting the school's principal, had ruled that the club involves an 
advancement of religion. School authorities ruled that lunch hour is an 
instructional time, even though other clubs meet at that time and half 
the students opt to go home. 

Joycelyn Elders' support for homosexual sex should be disavowed by 
President Clinton, Cardinal James Hickey again said. The surgeon 
general stated her views in a publication for homosexuals, which 
interviewed her. On other occasions, Elders has publicly criticized the 
Catholic Church and conservative Christian groups. As a federal 
official, she continues to advocate a re-definition of the family, the 
Washington archbishop wrote in a letter released to the press. Hickey 
sent his first letter in March. 
...Six weeks later, Clinton replied, emphasizing that it is part of the 
president's job to build a society that promotes tolerance and 
acceptance of diversity. He neither disavowed nor apologized for 
Elders' remarks, as Hickey had asked. Recognition of differing opinions 
does not imply endorsement in a matter of such complexity, Clinton 
wrote. In his second letter, Hickey wrote that Americans have a right 
to know whether Elders is "speaking for your administration." 

Therapy for homosexuals who want to become heterosexual was to be an 
agenda item for some 16,000 psychiatrists at this month's 150th annual 
meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in Philadelphia. A 
proposed resolution called for restrictions to be placed on such 
therapy. But the 280-member APA governing assembly sent the measure 
back to a subcommittee to reword it, saying it was vague and confusing. 
The subcommittee's next meeting is in Washington, D.C., in September. 
...Homosexuals have been pressing the APA for years for a clean bill of 
health. Recently, they were successful in having homosexuality removed 
from medicine's official list of psychiatric disorders and illnesses. 
The proposed resolution said that homosexuality should not be seen as a 
psychological disorder, implying that no therapy therefore is needed, 
but it said psychiatrists should be respectful to those who want 
therapy to practice heterosexuality. 

Same-sex partners will enjoy the same marriage-leave benefit the 
British Broadcasting Company gives heterosexual married couples: a week 
of paid leave to go on a honeymoon. As other couples, they also were to 
receive a gift certificate worth $113. The BBC explained that it was 
extending its marriage provision to bring it into line with its equal 
opportunities policy. But following a barrage of protests over such use 
of public money, the state-supported network said it was suspending the 
payment for all staff pending a reassessment of its benefit package. 
The new marriage policy also recognizes heterosexual couples who aren't 
legally married but who have made a formal commitment to their 
relationship. The formal commitment can be in the form of a humanist 
ceremony performed by an individual not licensed to perform marriages, 
the BBC said. 

Leaders of 40 national groups opposing homosexual rights met for two 
days in Colorado Springs to discuss strategies for elections in 
November. The gathering, organized by Colorado for Family Values (NIRR 
7/12/93) and held at a conference center operated by The Navigators, 
was the first national meeting of its kind, the Washington Times 
reported. CFV led the only successful statewide effort to win voter 
approval of an anti-homosexualrights measure. A state judge 
subsequently struck down Colorado's Amendment 2, and the case is 
pending before the state supreme court. The measure bans laws that 
afford special status to homosexuals or give them the same civil-rights 
protections as minorities. Organizers are gathering signatures for 
statewide ballot measures in Arizona, Idaho, Michigan, Missouri, 
Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. The Florida Supreme Court ruled the 
measure's language in that state was unconstitutional, but organizers 
say they will try again next year or in 1996. Courts elsewhere have 
nullified such ordinances passed by numerous local communities on 
constitutional grounds or on the premise that such legislation is a 
state prerogative rather than a local one. 

Religious conservatives gained control of the Republican Party in 
Texas. Evangelicals were elected last month for the party's June 10-11 
convention, giving them a majority there. The Christian conservatives 
took advantage of lack of interest among moderates at precinct caucuses 
and state senatorial-district conventions. Many were members or backers 
of the Texas Christian Coalition, the 50,000-member state chapter of 
Pat Robertson's national group. 
...A conservative bent is showing in other areas of Texas. Three 
religious conservatives defeated school board incumbents May 7 in the 
Dallas suburb of Plano. Also, voters in Austin, a university town with 
a liberal image and record of electing progressive candidates, repealed 
by an almost 2-1 margin a policy to provide health insurance to 
unmarried partners of city workers, including those in samesex 
relationships. The action was widely seen as rejection of the 
homosexual-rights movement. 

Catholic Charities of San Francisco may lose $1.5 million in AIDS 
contracts because its board of directors has balked at a city 
requirement that its members disclose their sexual orientation. The 
rule is to guarantee that service providers are sympathetic to their 
target populations, city officials say. But Catholic leaders say that 
sexual orientation of board and staff members is a private matter, and 
the charity adheres to a "don't ask, don't tell" policy. The city 
council is holding up renewal of a $412,000 contract for a residential 
program for homeless and destitute AIDS patients, citing failure to 
comply. 

Broad abortion coverage will be included in the Clinton national health 
plan, if a vote in a House Education and Labor subcommittee is a 
preview of the final outcome in Congress. The panel voted 16-11 to kill 
an amendment by Rep. Ron Klink (D-Pa.) that would have permitted 
abortions only when needed to save the life of the mother or when the 
pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. Opponents contended that 
private insurance plans for most Americans already provide abortion 
coverage. 

Approval of the abortion drug RU-486 will not lead to more abortions in 
the United States, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala 
said on ABC's This Week With David Brinkley last week. She also said 
she hopes the Food and Drug Administration will approve its use. The 
Population Council, a reproductive-health non-profit, will test the 
drug on 2,000 women this fall. RU486 was designed to abort pregnancy up 
to seven weeks after conception. Tests on its use as a contraceptive 
have begun in San Francisco. 

Out of jail after almost 14 months: Chaya Temima Patanelli, 40, an 
abortion protester. She was arrested last year for wrapping herself 
around the steering wheel of an old station wagon that was blocking an 
abortion clinic in Cherry Hill, N.J. It was a minor charge, but she 
refused to identify herself, saying she heeded only the law of God. A 
judge consigned her to jail until she decided to comply. In jail, where 
she was known as Jane Doe C., she refused to comply with the rules as 
part of her protest, and spent much of her time in solitary 
confinement. Police identified her by tracking arrest records in 
connection with at least eight abortion demonstrations in other states. 
After she was identified, the judge convicted her of the original 
charges and fined her $350, which he suspended in lieu of her time in 
jail. But she was ordered to pay $150 in court costs, which she refuses 
to pay, her supporters said. 

Sexually active teens typically have their first intercourse under 15 
years of age, a random telephone survey of teen-agers in grades 9 
through 12 found. Of the 503 polled, 36% said they had had sexual 
intercourse (down from 54% in a 1990 federal study), and 5% reported 
having had sex other than intercourse. Among sexually active girls, 62% 
said they should have waited until they were older before having sex, 
while 41% of the boys said that. And 71% of the girls said they were in 
love with their last sexual partner, while 45% of the boys were. 
Although 81% of the sexually active boys said sex was a pleasurable 
experience, only 59% of the girls said they felt that way. Ten percent 
of the respondents said they had a sexual experience for which they had 
not given their consent, and 8% said they were under the influence of 
alcohol or drugs when they first had sex. Only 2% said they had a 
sexual experience with someone of the same sex. The poll was conducted 
by the Roper Starch firm. 
...Good kids aren't saying no to sex, according to a study of Chicago 
junior high students. Church attendance, high grade-point average, high 
self-esteem, and sex education did not halt early sexual initiation, 
researcher Michael Benson of Northwestern University found. "These are 
results a lot of people don't want to hear," he told USA Today. Benson 
presented the findings during a meeting of the American College of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists. 

The Clinton administration eliminated funding for teen chastity and 
adoption programs from its 1995 budget. While revoking funds of the 
Title XX Adolescent Family Life program, the budget allots $6.8 million 
for a new Office of Adolescent Health, according to the Washington 
Times. 
...The advantages of abstinence were acknowledged by the office of 
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, which insisted that 
abstinence programs were not being gutted. Many will be eligible to 
compete for funding under the new health office, her spokesman said. 
The Office of Adolescent Health is to fund programs that fight teen 
violence, drugs, sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy, and mental 
health problems. The office also is to encourage health education and 
contraceptive information and services for teens. Unlike the Family 
Life Program, the Office of Adolescent Health has no mandate to fund 
programs helping pregnant teens choose adoption. Abstinence is "not in 
their vocabulary and it's not in their budget," said Sen. Don Nickles 
(R-Okla.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Congress is 
scheduled to debate its appropriations for HHS funding later this 
summer. 

For Jews unable to wait until marriage, sex still can be a holy 
experience if religious moral standards are followed. That's according 
to a report that seeks to develop a contemporary sexual ethic for 
Conservative Judaism, the nation's largest branch. Guidelines for sex 
outside of marriage, the report suggests, include avoiding coercive 
sex; modesty in speech, dress, and sexual activities; honesty about 
each partner's commitment to the other; and fidelity. It condemns 
adultery as a violation of Jewish law, and condemns casual and 
promiscuous sex. The report, a proposed pastoral letter from the 
Rabbinical Assembly's Commission on Human Sexuality, has been referred 
to the group's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, which is expected 
to begin its review in the fall. The assembly represents 1,500 
Conservative rabbis who serve 1.5 million synagogue members. 

A survey about the Holocaust was flawed. A widely publicized Roper poll 
showed that a third of Americans think the Holocaust might never have 
happened. But confusing wording of the question skewed its results, 
said Burns Roper, who is retiring as chairman of the company. A revised 
survey from Roper Starch Worldwide, formerly known as the Roper 
Organization, is to be released soon. A Gallup poll in January, which 
stated the question more clearly, found that 9% expressed doubt and 4% 
were unsure the Holocaust happened. 

Jews will return to Shanghai, said Rabbi Arthur Schneier, president of 
New York-based Appeal of Conscience Foundation. Some 20,000 German, 
Austrian, and Polish Jews fled the Nazis to the Chinese city in the 
late 1930s. Later, many of them immigrated to Israel and North America. 
Now, Shanghai is developing as a center of commerce and finance. 
Schneier, who discussed religious freedom with government officials and 
religious leaders in the People's Republic, said that when enough Jews 
move to China, government recognition to form synagogues will be 
granted. 

China released six religious dissidents, apparently as a gesture to win 
President Clinton's approval on the Most Favored Nation trade status 
question. Clinton must decide by June 3 whether to renew the status, 
something he pledged to do only if China had made progress in human 
rights. At the same time, China also tightened already extensive 
restrictions on individual rights, according to U.S. and international 
watchdog agencies. The six included Catholics and Protestants, one of 
whom was badly tortured during interrogation, news reports said. They 
had been arrested more than a year ago on charges of activities 
connected with illegal house churches, including unauthorized contact 
with foreigners. 
...Citing dissident sources, the May 19 Human Rights Watch/Asia and 
Human Rights in China alleged that there were 500 previously unknown 
cases of people tried in connection with the Tiananmen Square protests 
five years ago, with 200 still in jail. Human Rights Watch said known 
cases of political and religious imprisonment represent "only the tip 
of the iceberg." Chinese officials denied the reports. 

Church-state relations in Myanmar have improved greatly, said a 
Christian leader in the capital city of Yangon. The believer, who asked 
not to be named, told NIRR that although Buddhism is favored, it no 
longer is the official religion of the southeast Asian nation, also 
known as Burma. Catholics preached Christianity there in the 1500s, as 
did Protestants in the 1800s, but Communists expelled all Westerners in 
the 1960s, and persecuted Burmese Christians. 
...Myanmar does not oppose Christianity, the leader said, but 
evangelicals must exercise discretion in public speech and behavior. 
Preachers who criticized Buddhism (the religion of 87% of Myanmar's 43 
million people) have been arrested in recent months, a seminary student 
told NIRR. A Christian convert's public destruction of his idols also 
can lead to similar treatment, according to a pastor's wife who wished 
not to be named. Approximately 6% of Myanmar's population is Christian. 

Capitulation in Pakistan: the government acceded to demands by 150,000 
Muslim demonstrators from the northwestern tribal area of Malakand, 
granting implementation of Islamic law in the district. The Pashtoon 
tribespeople were led by Muslim religious scholars and clerics who, in 
a violent exchange with police in Islamabad, called for an armed 
uprising by the Pashtoons. 
...A system of religious courts, each headed by a religious scholar who 
will have the same judicial powers as those of a magistrate, will exist 
under the agreement. Some Muslim groups are pressing for Islamic law to 
be established throughout Pakistan, a move that religious minorities, 
including Christians, adamantly oppose (NIRR 5/2). Special courts 
already exist to rule on whether judgments by regular courts violate 
Islamic law. 

Civil disobedience by churches is spreading in Germany, with about 200 
Lutheran/Evangelical and Catholic parishes so far hiding foreign 
refugees or proclaiming their readiness to do so, according to news 
accounts. Germany and its states recently enacted stricter laws to 
control immigration, making it almost impossible for foreigners to get 
political asylum. Among those being hid are two Turkish Kurds 
authorities want to deport. They could be tortured or killed if sent 
home, Lutheran pastor Wolfram Stauffer warned. 

An international appeal to assist some 6,000 Russian Orthodox priests 
who live in dire poverty was announced by the German-based Catholic 
group Aid to the Church in Need. The charity, whose main mission 
formerly was to provide Bibles to Catholics in the Soviet Union and 
Eastern Europe, said its goal is to raise enough funds so that each 
Russian priest can receive an average $1,000 in assistance. Plans call 
for Russian Orthodox bishops to administer the funds to priests 
locally. Many Orthodox priests in Russia earn no more than $30 a month 
and have little time for their pastoral ministry other than celebrating 
the liturgy, charity officials said. The priests must work other jobs 
to support themselves and their families. 

The Orthodox Church is not linked to politics in Moscow, Belgrade, and 
Athens, according to the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, 
Bartholomeos I. In an interview with Le Monde of Paris, the patriarch 
said that shared spiritual interests of the three centers of Orthodoxy 
do not constitute a political bloc. 

Belief in God is waning in France, but belief in the devil is up, a 
poll for the newspaper Le Monde showed. It found that 61% of the French 
more or less believe in God, compared with 66% of those asked the same 
question eight years ago. Thirty-four percent believe in the devil, up 
from 24% in 1986. Some 56% said they believed Jesus was the son of God 
(down from 64% in 1986). Non-believers were most numerous among people 
18 to 24, with 48% saying the existence of God is improbable or 
impossible. 

Jacques Ellul, 82, a renowned French theologian, died of cancer of the 
lymphatic system in Bordeaux, France, May 19. A leader of the French 
Resistance against the Nazis, one-time mayor of Bordeaux and a 
sociologist, Ellul wrote more than 40 books and 1,500 articles, 
according to his bibliographer, Joyce Hanks, acting chair of foreign 
languages at the University of Scranton. 
...Ellul was a pivotal figure of the 20th century, according to Darrell 
Fasching, chairman of religious studies at the University of South 
Florida at Tampa. Fasching, author of The Thought of Jacques Ellul, 
told NIRR the Protestant Frenchman taught religious leaders how to 
think theologically about technology. Ellul said the modern church 
needs to oppose the deification of technology. 
...Evangelicals and the radical left were the two groups that most 
avidly followed Ellul's ideas, Fasching said. According to Hanks, it 
was Ellul's broad perspective, staunchly biblical and grounded in law 
and sociology, that made his theological works so appealing. She told 
NIRR that three forthcoming films, based on interviews with Ellul over 
the past two years, are in varying stages of production. 

Missionary hostage released in Cambodia: Melissa Himes of Food for the 
Hungry International (NIRR 4/18). Physically unharmed, she survived six 
weeks of captivity, forced labor, and occasional threats. From her 
hometown in North Carolina, Himes said she was a stronger person 
because of the experience. Karen Randau, FHI's director of public 
relations, expressed thankfulness that the agency had prepared for such 
contingencies prior to the kidnapping. 
...The crisis arose over a dispute caused by another agency failing to 
deliver on a promise to dig water wells, according to a statement 
released by Himes. FHI declined to identify that agency. Although no 
ransom money was paid, Himes and two Cambodian colleagues dug a well 
while in captivity as part of a release agreement. Randau said the 
agency also had provided two truckloads of humanitarian materials. 
...Some missionary and relief sources expressed concern about a 
possible new wave of abductions for political and financial ransom. A 
rash of non-political vehicle thefts in the country already has 
occurred because of the economic vacuum left by the departure of United 
Nations officials and troops last November, a missions official told 
NIRR. 

An extremist Muslim group, outlawed in the Middle East, operates freely 
in London, according to the London-based International Institute for 
the Study of Islam and Christianity. Hizb ut-Tahrir ("Liberation 
Party") seeks the death of Jews and homosexuals and espouses the 
formation, by force if necessary, of a pan-Islamic state under Sharia 
law. 
...The group also promotes war with Israel and the killing of Jews 
before Messiah comes. Hizb ut-Tahrir has been responsible for attempted 
coups in Jordan, Syria, Iraq, and Tunisia, IISIC reported. Membership 
in the society carries the death penalty in Iraq. Anti-Semitic leaflets 
were circulated by the group among students and Asian Muslims in London 
universities this year. sities this year.

National Day of Prayer participation continues to grow. Requests for 
information about the annual event, held May 5, increased from 18,000 
last year to 27,000, according to the National Day of Prayer Task 
Force. Again this year, 49 state governors issued Day of Prayer 
decrees, with Connecticut Gov. Lowell Weicker declining to do so. 
Puerto Rico issued a proclamation this year for the first time. 
President Bill Clinton issued a statement urging Americans to seek 
divine assistance to relieve suffering, reduce hatred, violence and 
abuse, and to "restore families across our land." The American Civil 
Liberties Union and some atheists lodged complaints about government 
encouragement of the religious observance. 
...Nearly 1,000 people gathered in Washington, D.C., for a three-hour 
service on the Capitol's west steps. Speakers ranged from former D.C. 
delegate Walter Fauntroy and other local black clergy to leaders of 
national parachurch organizations. The service, which emphasized the 
need to safeguard the nation's young people, capped a series of events 
around the nation's capital. 
...Hundreds of prayer events were held in Southern California, 
including a rally at Quakes Stadium in Rancho Cucamonga, where 4,500 
people heard Raul Reese of Calvary Chapel and Bob Vernon, former 
assistant police chief of Los Angeles. Some 2,000 people attended a 
prayer breakfast with Richard Halverson, U.S. Senate chaplain. Of the 
several dozen breakfasts held, most had at least 500 in attendance, 
Foursquare pastor Jerry Homme said. More than 70 communities held noon 
rallies, and many groups held evening prayer meetings. 
...The largest prayer meeting in Chicago's history is what organizers 
are calling a May 5 concert of prayer, held to coincide with the 
National Day of Prayer. The event was broadcast live on Christian 
television and radio from Moody Memorial Church. Thousands of people 
gathered at churches and Bible-study groups in greater Chicago to watch 
on TV, organizers said. Steve Bell of Concerts of Prayer International, 
who did the radio commentary along with CPI's David Bryant, told NIRR 
that the power of the Lord, evident during the interdenominational, 
multi-ethnic event, "just melted people." 
...Denominational Prayer Leaders Network, a group composed of church 
leaders from evangelical, Pentecostal, and mainline denominations 
representing 140,000 congregations, is asking every Christian 
television and radio station in the nation to broadcast a similar event 
next year, Robert Bakke of the Evangelical Free Church in America's 
National Prayer Advance told NIRR. The 1995 national concert of prayer 
again will be held at Moody, then will move to other churches around 
the country starting in 1996, Bakke said. Christian leaders, including 
college and seminary presidents, and heads of mission organizations, 
denominations, and church movements, would be among those attending the 
event. It also will be broadcast into churches and homes around the 
country for a simultaneous national concert of prayer. 

A special new state Bible was used when Nelson Mandela was sworn in as 
South Africa's first black president. The 2,192-page volume, bound in 
brown calf leather and edged with gold, was printed by the Bible 
Society of South Africa, with parallel text in English and Afrikaans. 
The cover inscription is Romans 13:6, "The authorities are God's 
servants who give their full time to governing." Mandela and his 
deputies signed a goat-skin parchment inserted into the Bible for the 
occasion. South Africa is "one of the few countries where the head of 
state signs and is witnessed in a state Bible," a Bible Society 
spokesman said. Society executive Donald Tolmie said he hopes the Bible 
will be more than just a symbol of state. "May it be a medium whereby 
God's message of love, peace, and hope bring calm, reconciliation, and 
healing to our land." 
...The nationally televised session in Pretoria, where Parliament 
elected Mandela president, opened with prayer. Anglican Archbishop 
Desmond Tutu then presented him to tens of thousands of cheering 
supporters outside. 
...As part of his bid to bring reconciliation to a fractured nation, 
Mandela attended weekend Muslim, Jewish, and Christian services after 
his election, news sources said. At a synagogue in Cape Town, he paid 
tribute to the role of Jews in opposing apartheid, and called on those 
who had gone overseas to return and help build for the future. He had 
addressed a Muslim congregation at a Cape Town mosque earlier. The new 
government must curb corruption, and religious groups can play a key 
role in that effort by promulgating moral values, he said. Last Sunday, 
he spoke to a church rally at a stadium in Soweto, the black township 
outside Johannesburg where the 1976 uprising against apartheid began. 

Continuing horror in Rwanda has many missions groups calling for 
prayer. Rwandan church leaders were seen alive in Tanzanian refugee 
camps, to the amazement of missions officials. Free Methodist missions 
leaders had feared the worst for Christian friends after seeing 
gruesome news reports of the carnage, said Doane Bonney, the Free 
Methodist's U.S. general director of missions. FM missionaries Jim 
Kirkpatrick and Tim Kratzer were elated to speak with a dozen Free 
Methodist pastors and their families in the camp, Bonney told NIRR. The 
Rwandan pastors are ministering in the camps where they are refugees 
themselves, Bonney said. The ministers circulate through the camps, 
noting which parishioners are there and giving them spiritual help as 
they can. 
...Some problems were created by the glut of relief workers and 
journalists at the camps in Tanzania, which have an estimated 170,000 
refugees, Bonney said. World Vision has supplied tools for camp 
building, cooking utensils, blankets, and other goods, but has not yet 
been assigned another role by the director of the U.N. High Commission 
on Relief, according to WV's Public Relations Coordinator Judy Jones. 
...Post-trauma support is being supplied to four Conservative Baptist 
missionary families by CB International. The missionaries are strong, 
capable people, but "they have been put through hell, and I don't say 
that lightly," Bruce Swanson, CBI's director of missionary development, 
told NIRR. They endured days of gunfire, mortar attack, and watching 
neighbors kill each other, he said. They left behind not only their 
possessions, but 10-15 years' investment in the lives of people they 
love. After "critical incident stress debriefings," the families 
understandably are experiencing confusion, nightmares, and grief, 
Swanson said. It has been traumatic to see ABC's Nightline reports of 
continued slaughter while they are unable to communicate with their 
friends in Rwanda, he said. 

The first private university in subSaharan Africa opened April 23 in 
Mutare, Zimbabwe. Africa University, founded by United Methodists, is 
being called a model of how African leaders, African-Americans, and 
black institutions can work together to improve the continent's future. 
More than 6,000 people from around the world attended the ceremonies. 
...Africa needs skills, training, and hope, speakers said. Those were 
the goals of the two United Methodist bishops credited with the idea 
for an African university: Emilio J.M. de Carvalho of Angola, who will 
be the school's chancellor, and Arthur Kulah of Liberia. Only 33% of 
Zimbabwe's 10 million people are literate. By the year 2000, Africa 
will account for 20% of the world's population, but it has only enough 
colleges to educate 2% of its students, James Salley, assistant 
chancellor for development, told USA Today. 
...American schools are helping Africa University as well. Clark 
College, a black institution in Atlanta, is setting up the school's MBA 
program. Bennett College President Gloria Scott serves on the board. 
African-American scholars such as Josiah Young, a professor at Wesley 
Theological Seminary, are volunteering to teach. United Methodist 
congregations are providing scholarships. 

Bishop Knox cannot return to Wingfield High School until the 
Mississippi Supreme Court reviews his case. Last month a judge 
reinstated the principal (NIRR 5/2), suspended last fall by the Jackson 
public school district for allowing a student to pray over the school 
intercom. But the high court, acting on a motion by school officials, 
issued a stay on the judge's order. Judge W.O. Dillard also had ordered 
the school district to develop prayer guidelines consistent with his 
opinion that student prayer is permissible over school intercoms. 
School attorney James Keith said the board will be unable to comply 
because "those guidelines would be inconsistent with federal 
precedent." Christian rights watchdog Jay Sekulow of Pat Robertson's 
American Center for Law and Justice agrees that a school intercom 
announcement does not constitute a public forum. 

A gay Lutheran campus minister with AIDS committed suicide in Chicago 
last month. Police said Philip Knutson died in his garage of carbon 
monoxide poisoning from the fumes of his car, which he apparently 
started. Knutson took leave from his work with the Division for Higher 
Education and Schools of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America in 
January. He publicly announced his homosexuality at that time, and said 
he was in the advanced stages of AIDS-related illness, Religious News 
Service reported. Days before his death, he established an endowment at 
his alma mater, St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minn. The fund will 
finance programs on contemporary issues and the church, including the 
issue of sexuality. St. Olaf will sponsor special studies on 
homosexuality every four years, an official announced. 
...A sexuality study has split the faculty at the largest seminary in 
the ELCA. Sharply conflicting statements, each signed by some two dozen 
teachers at Luther Northwestern Theological Seminary in St. Paul, 
Minn., have been issued in response to the study, RNS reported. The 
21-page study was prepared by a task force as the draft of a social 
statement for the 5.2-million-member ELCA. It urged members to 
challenge traditional condemnations of homosexuality, and argued that 
responsible biblical interpretation supports a move to bless committed 
same-sex unions. 

At least two TV stations yanked a recent episode of Northern Exposure 
that depicted a homosexual wedding. Station executives at CBS 
affiliates in Monroe, La., and Dothan, Ala., denied that their 
decisions were based on advertiser pressure, letter-writing campaigns, 
or controversial content. They suggested their decisions to air other 
programming were in the interest of serving their communities. 
Meanwhile, homosexual activists criticized the show's producers for 
deciding not to have the gay men kiss. 

Gospel singer Michael English returned four gospel music awards, 
including the industry's highest honor, after acknowledging an 
extra-marital affair with another married gospel performer, Marabeth 
Jordan. She is pregnant with English's child, Gospel Music Association 
President Bruce Koblish said. English returned the four Dove awards -- 
including one for artist of the year -- he won a week before. Koblish 
said English told him about the affair, and said the GMA would keep the 
awards in storage until English chooses whether to reclaim them. The 
GMA is not a policing organization, Koblish added. 
...English and Jordan had sung together on the Mercy Tour to raise 
money to build a home for unwed mothers. Jordan's group, First Call, 
has replaced her. Warner Alliance, English's record label, said it 
would drop all promotion, marketing and sales of his contemporary 
Christian music. English also has been a member of the Gaither Vocal 
Band. Christian radio stations debated whether to stop playing 
English's songs, as did Nashville's WNAZ. Some bookstore managers 
considered emptying their shelves of his products, The Associated Press 
reported. Sources speculated on whether English would resume his 
career. Nashville journalist and music insider Dan Daley told RNS that 
English represents too much money to the recording industry to vanish 
into obscurity for long. 
...The Dove Awards were sponsored by Target retail stores. Its parent 
company, Dayton-Hudson, has donated $200,000 over 10 years to abortion 
provider Planned Parenthood. The GMA and Christian singers Amy Grant 
and Michael W. Smith have entered into business relationships with 
Target over the last two years. 

Pro-life leaders vowed they will never pay the judgment against them. A 
Houston jury ordered four pro-life organizations -- Operation Rescue, 
Lambs of Christ, Rescue America National, and Dallas Rescue -- and 
their leaders to pay $204,585 in actual damages to Planned Parenthood 
in connection with protests during the 1992 Republican National 
Convention. 
...Punitive damages of $1.01 million were assessed against two of the 
groups and their national leaders at the time: Operation Rescue, 
$350,000; Keith Tucci, $150,000; Rescue America, $355,000; and Don 
Treshman, $155,000. The jury found that protesters had conspired to 
disrupt business operations of PP's clinic in violation of Texas 
commercial law. PP said it had to pay for extra security and fire 
protection, damage by vandals, and the cost of hiring people to escort 
clients into its clinic. It was joined in its suit by operators of nine 
other clinics, but PP alone sought punitive damages. Treshman said the 
groups were considering an appeal but that whatever the outcome, "Not a 
penny of pro-life funds will ever enrich the coffers of Planned 
Parenthood or any other abortuary." 

Federal penalties were lowered for abortion protesters convicted of 
blocking clinic entrances, damaging clinics, or intimidating patients 
or staff. A congressional conference set the new penalties at a maximum 
fine of $10,000 and six months in prison for a first offense, and a 
maximum penalty of $25,000 and 18 months in jail for subsequent 
offenses. The House version of the bill called for fines 10 times 
higher and up to three years in prison. The Freedom of Access to Clinic 
Entrances (FACE) bill (NIRR 4/18) imposes federal penalties on those 
who intentionally intimidate, injure, or interfere with clinic staff or 
patients by using force, threatening force, or physically blocking 
their way. Opponents argued that the legislation singles out abortion 
opponents for punishment, thereby threatening their right to free 
speech. The Hatch Amendment to FACE (NIRR 4/18) also makes it a federal 
offense to impede access to, or to damage, a place of worship, and 
levies the same penalties. If passed, the legislation, which went to 
the Senate last week, is expected to be signed into law by President 
Clinton. 

U.S. testing of RU-486 for use as a morning-after "emergency 
contraceptive" will take about a year and will involve 150 female 
volunteers, doctors at San Francisco General Hospital said. They 
emphasized that the French abortion pill will not be given to pregnant 
women, but will be used to avoid potential pregnancies. 
...It's a smoke screen, Richard Glasow of the National Right to Life 
Committee said. He disputed the claim, saying the drug does not prevent 
conception, the union of egg and sperm. Dr. David Grimes, who will 
oversee the study at the hospital, said medical opinion considers the 
beginning of a pregnancy to be the implantation of the fertilized egg 
in the uterus, which occurs about two weeks after conception. Further, 
he said, the drug may prevent fertilization itself or other early 
actions in the conception process. The study will test the drug's use 
up to five days after sex. The World Health Organization is sponsoring 
global clinical trials of RU-486's use as a contraceptive. Studies 
eventually will involve 2,100 women at 14 sites, WHO officials said. 
RU-486, manufactured by Roussel-Uclaf, was designed to end a pregnancy 
once a woman realizes her condition, up to seven weeks after 
conception. 

"A competent, terminally ill adult has a constitutionally guaranteed 
right under the 14th Amendment to commit physician-assisted suicide," 
Seattle federal judge Barbara Rothstein said. Her 32-page ruling was 
the latest on Washington's law barring assisted suicide. Rothstein 
equated a patient's right to ask for help in dying with that of 
refusing life-sustaining medical treatment. The state law was 
challenged by three terminally ill patients who wanted to commit 
suicide with the help of their doctors; five physicians who care for 
the terminally ill; and Compassion in Dying, a Seattlebased 
right-to-die group (NIRR 2/7). 
...Dr. Jack Kevorkian's acquittal in Michigan sends a frightening 
signal to this nation's 49 million people with disabilities, said Joni 
Eareckson Tada, a quadriplegic and advocate for disabled persons. The 
message is that courts can say a person is better off dead than 
disabled, she said. Michigan's law against assisted suicide last week 
was struck on a technicality under the state constitution. The appeals 
court also ruled 2-1 that the Michigan constitution guarantees no 
rights to such suicides. In addition, two previously dismissed murder 
charges from 1991 were reinstated against Kevorkian. 

The "father wound" -- men's unfulfilled longing for a father's love  
-is epidemic today, said author Gordon Dalbey. Many men have fathers 
who abandoned or abused them in childhood. Since fathers are the key to 
men's sexual identity, these men are desperately confused, Dalbey told 
the San Diego Christian Conference on Trauma and Sexuality. Yet the 
church is making matters worse by stressing that they follow a strict 
code of moral conduct rather than appropriate the love and forgiveness 
of Father God, he said. 
...Christians are terrified to talk to each other about their sexual 
wounds, so they hide behind religion, Dalbey said. The result is that 
they avoid relationships instead of drawing deeper into them. Dalbey 
sees some hopeful signs. A number of men around the country, broken by 
drug addiction, divorce, and other traumas, have been "forced into the 
Father's arms," and have received forgiveness and wholeness, he said. 
The San Diego conference, attended by 170 lay people and therapists, 
concluded with several men apologizing to women for hurting them, and 
women confessing they tried to control men. It was a powerful event, 
Dalbey said. 

Christians talk about victory in Christ, but many are feeling pain, 
according to Pauline Bartosch. She and her husband, Bob, founded La 
Habra, Calif.,-based Overcomers Outreach in 1985. The non-profit 
organization is a non-denominational ministry intended for church 
members who have addictions and compulsions, but who won't attend 
Alcoholics Anonymous or other 12-Step meetings. Bartosch said that 
before Bob received help, he thought he was "the only alcoholic in the 
entire Baptist church." Sharing the pain with others in the group can 
be liberating, she told NIRR. 
...Overcomers has 1,000 groups internationally, and held its fourth 
annual Christians in Recovery Conference in Albuquerque last month. The 
non-profit group offers Christians a chance to see recovery principles 
in the Bible. Whereas traditional 12-Step groups discuss an unnamed 
"higher power," Overcomers Outreach groups help Christians worship 
their higher power by name, she said. 

Faith and religious values have a rightful place in debate about public 
issues. That premise won Yale University law professor Stephen Carter 
the prestigious Louisville Grawemeyer Award in Religion. His book The 
Culture of Disbelief: How American Law and Politics Trivialize 
Religious Devotion was published in 1993 by Basic Books (NIRR 10/4/93). 
Officials at Louisville Presbyterian Seminary and the University of 
Louisville, which jointly confer the award and its $150,000 cash prize, 
say Carter, an Episcopalian, is the first non-theologian to receive it. 
Carter warns that the United States has pressured people of faith to be 
hypocritical, "to act publicly, and sometimes privately as well, as 
though their faith does not matter to them." 

Another Anglican turns Catholic: retired bishop Graham Leonard, 72, 
converted last month and has become a Catholic priest. Leonard, who is 
married, retired as Bishop of London in 1991, after 10 years as the 
third most-senior churchman in the Church of England. A conservative 
and outspoken critic of the church's recent decision to ordain women, 
Leonard is the highest-ranking Anglican to leave over the issue. 

Traditionalists and moderates within the United Methodist Church have 
mounted an aggressive ad hoc movement to halt what they feel are 
liberal trends in the denomination. The coalition urged UMC pastors and 
congregations to join a "Confessing Movement" to unite Methodism and to 
prevent schism and mass exodus. 
..."We face the peril of abandoning the Christian faith, and thereby 
becoming unfaithful disciples of Jesus Christ," the group said after 
April's Consultation on the Future of the Methodist Church, held in 
Atlanta. The denomination has equivocated regarding the person of Jesus 
Christ, been distracted by false gospels, and compromised the Methodist 
mission to "declare the true gospel to all people and spread scriptural 
holiness." 
...The group is determined to stay within the United Methodist Church, 
said Thomas Oden, a theology professor at Drew Theological School in 
Madison, N.J. Oden, an organizer of the consultation, told NIRR the 
movement would attract those who are not willing to see teaching about 
Jesus Christ neglected. Laity support for the Confessing Movement is 
extremely broad, he said. The vast majority of Methodist laypersons are 
moderate to traditionalist, "not nearly as far left as the clergy and 
bureaucratic elites of the church." 

Orthodox Easter caused a stir in Albania. Greece accused the country of 
banning observances by Albania's ethnic Greek minority the weekend of 
April 30. In protest, Greek officials canceled a meeting of the two 
countries' foreign ministers, and demanded an explanation. A spokesman 
told Reuters that Albania's refusal to allow Greek churches to 
commemorate the burial and resurrection of Christ was "a rude insult to 
religious freedom." 
...The bells of the Kremlin's Ivan the Great bell tower in Moscow rang 
out at midnight to signal the start of Russian Orthodox Easter masses. 
Muscovites had worked for two years restoring the bells. They were 
tested earlier in the day, the first they had rung since being banned 
by Vladimir Lenin in 1918. The test chiming ended abruptly after a man 
approached the bell-ringers and said the noise was disturbing President 
Boris Yeltsin, Reuters reported. 

CBN will sue Romanian TV for reneging on an agreement to broadcast four 
Easter programs. "They were inspiring, uplifting," and family oriented 
programs, Christian Broadcasting Network marketing executive Richard 
Thomas said at a news conference in Bucharest. However, state TV 
officials claimed that the programs "were just a pretext for a large 
campaign...to promote Baptist, Pentecostal, and evangelical churches." 
They said the Virginia Beach-based ministry had not abided by script 
agreements, and claimed the final programs had a much stronger 
religious message than officials had approved. The shows were scheduled 
to air during Orthodox Easter observances, which took place late last 
month. 

Evangelicals doubled in number late last month in Gdansk, Poland, 
according to the Luis Palau Evangelistic Association. Seven such 
churches in the port city had only 750 members before more than 700 
adults committed their lives to Christ during the April 28-May 1 Palau 
crusade. LPEA distributed some 20,000 evangelistic booklets, and the 
British Foreign Bible Society and Bristol, England-based Eurovangelism 
supplied additional Christian literature. An evangelical Catholic 
movement, Oasis Catholic Fellowship, also supported the crusade, which 
was covered extensively on television. 

Magazines for Christians are popping up across Eastern Europe for the 
first time in history, due in part to a new publication ministry. The 
Eastern European Magazine Training Institute was founded two years ago 
by former editor and Wheaton College graduate Sharon Mumper, who lives 
in Austria. Mumper arranges writing conferences and does consulting for 
European Christian magazines such as Lydia. She organized a two-week 
training seminar in Ustron, Poland, last month. More than 30 people, 
representing 11 publications from five Eastern bloc countries, 
attended. 
...American representatives from the Christian publications 
Discipleship Journal, Christianity Today, and Latin America Evangelist 
joined Mumper and editors from Tarax, a Christian youth magazine in 
Croatia, to lead workshops on circulation, marketing, advertising, 
writing, and editing. DJ editor Susan Maycinik told NIRR that the 
conference, the second of its kind, gave the Europeans a practical look 
at publishing a magazine. Such Christian publications could impact 
society, especially those that can "cross over into Poland's Catholic 
market or other non-Christian markets in other countries," Maycinik 
said. In many cases, the magazines are new and the editors are recent 
converts who are ethusiastic and have a strong desire to reach people 
with the gospel. 

Eastern Europe will see the start of 50 to 75 new Bible schools over 
the next several years, according to Don Brugmann of Greater European 
Mission. National groups are asking western agencies for information 
about how to launch the centers. Most will be correspondence or 
non-residential schools, allowing pastors to attend while serving their 
churches. 
...The Europrofs program, sponsored by GEM, will bring western pastors 
and professors to teach seminary classes in Slavic countries. The 
program, instituted at the request of local church leaders, eventually 
will replace its western teachers with nationally based pastors. Few 
qualified teachers speak Slavic languages, so interpreters will be 
used, GEM's Mark Mackey said. 
...In Eastern Europe, most pastors lack basic Bible and theological 
education. Of the 51 known churches in one district of Ukraine, for 
example, 20 do not have pastors, and only three pastors have had formal 
training. 

More than 1,000 doctors in Ukraine's prominent medical university 
indicated they placed their faith in Christ during an April 1-10 
physicians conference, according Sid Stansell, director of Issa 
International of Hampton, Ga. Fifty-six American medical students, 
doctors, and interns conducted medical seminars, clinics, apartment 
evangelism, and visits to orphanages and children's hospitals. The 
seminars dealt with spiritual issues, as well as training in 
otolaryngology, dentistry, cardiology, surgery, and psychology. 
..."What does an atheistic doctor have to offer a dying patient?" the 
president of the Ukrainian State Medical University, which hosted the 
conference, asked. Such keen interest in spiritual issues in the 
medical establishment astonished the American Christian doctors, 
Stansell said. "They are hungry for the gospel out there." New 
believers will be mentored by some of 400 Ukrainian physicians trained 
since its first medical conference last year. 
..."The Lord gave us the opportunity," Stansell told NIRR, noting that 
his ministry is not a medical organization. He said a chance connection 
with the head of the Christian Medical Association of Ukraine made the 
conference possible. Based on the number of Ukrainian Bibles 
distributed to participants, Issa estimates that 10,000 attended the 
seminars at several locations in Kiev. Campus Crusade for Christ 
provided Bibles and literature, and the Kansas City-based Heart to 
Heart, a grassroots aid network, supplied $5 million worth of medical 
supplies and equipment. 

The Ukrainian "Christ for Kiev '94" expanded into a "crusade on tour" 
to six cities, according to Loves Park, Ill.,-based Slavic Gospel 
Association. Scarcity of fuel in the country inspired sponsors to go to 
the people rather than expect crusade-goers to travel to the capital 
city, SGA's Joel Griffith told NIRR. The outreach was organized by the 
Union of Evangelical Churches-Baptist, the largest Protestant 
denomination of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Two prominent 
speakers were UEC-B President Grigory Komendant and Calvin Leung, 
president of Costa Mesa, Calif.,-based Global Evangelical Missions 
Society. SGA provided prison ministry, crusade speakers, Bibles, and 
training for altar counselors and follow-up workers. 

One-tenth of Russia's population could turn the country right-side up, 
according to Alexandr Zaichenko, a leading Russian economist and 
president of the Association of Christians in Business. If those who 
believe the Bible and have a personal relationship with Christ reached 
that 10% critical mass, it would be enough to build the new Russia, the 
Kremlin's first nonCommunist cabinet member told NIRR. Zaichenko toured 
the United States in April promoting a RussianAmerican Christian 
University and the Russian New Geneva Study Bible. 
...Christians must glorify God with both their words and work, 
Zaichenko said. Russia needs an institution for training its 
professionals and pastors. The country also needs a Christian think 
tank to offer alternatives to a secular-atheistic model for society, he 
said. 
...Economic privatization of Russia will lead to evangelization, 
Zaichenko said. Instead of collectivist irresponsibility, private 
ownership will cause Russians to experience personal responsibility in 
a new way, he said. Until now, they would blame their poverty on 
American imperialism or other "enemies of the people." Understanding 
personal rights and responsibilities will lead to belief in 
accountability for the rights of one's neighbor and a new credible 
foundation for understanding responsibility to the Creator, he said. 

Every Home for Christ will begin a Bible school this month in Magadan, 
Siberia, the area where more than 10 million Russians were exiled by 
Josef Stalin. The school will meet in a church whose pastor is a former 
professor of Marxist philosophy, EHC's Dick Eastman said. Students will 
study for six months, then spend six months evangelizing and starting a 
church in a town they select, he said. 
...EHC plans to test a literature campaign across Southern China and 
Laos, and to re-establish its program in Vietnam. EHC, founded in 1946, 
has distributed gospel booklets in 128 nations. Eastman said the group 
has reached every home in 66 countries with gospel literature, and has 
received more than 15 million written responses to EHC materials. 

Seminaries and theological schools in Canada will unite to form a 
cooperative advanced-degree network this fall. Associated Canadian 
Theological Schools, Canadian Theological Seminary, Prairie Graduate 
School, and Regent College have formed the Calgary Graduate Theological 
Network, Alliance Life magazine reported. Under their experimental 
agreement, the schools will combine their resources to offer a larger 
class selection and professorial pool than any of them could 
individually. The CGTN's three-credit courses count toward 
master's-degree or certificate programs at any of the four schools. 

China is rounding up and arresting religious believers as part of an 
overall crackdown (NIRR 4/18), New York-based Human Rights WatchAsia 
said in an updated report. Also being targeted are film directors, 
poets, and publishers, along with advocates of Tibetan independence. 
The group's update this month indicated that the situation is worse 
than noted in its 650-page February report. That document indicated 
that 1993 was the worst year for human rights since the crackdown on 
pro-democracy activists in Tiananmen Square in 1990. Another recent 
report by Amnesty International shows similar findings, and notes that 
death sentences and executions increased in China during 1993. 
...Beijing lawmakers cracked down on dissidence May 6. The government 
announced 18 new regulations to control China's growing dissent groups. 
The rules, aimed at growing unrest and pockets of armed resistance, 
will increase police powers to control of ethnic separatists, secret 
societies, China-based human rights groups, and "superstitious sects," 
according to news reports. 

Peruvian authorities freed a lay evangelist charged in connection with 
a crime for which several military officers already have been 
sentenced. Juan Mallea Tomaylla, 35, was arrested last June after 
giving a ride in his taxi to several people who later were caught in 
possession of propaganda for the Shining Path guerrilla movement. 
Anti-terrorist police accused Mallea of having been implicated in the 
deaths of a university professor and nine students last year. After 
their graves were discovered, authorities said the 10 had hidden 
deliberately in an effort to bring disrepute to the military, but were 
slain by the Shining Path. Evidence later showed that an army group was 
responsible for the killings, and eight officers were courtmartialed 
and sentenced to five to 20 years in prison. 
...There were no grounds to try Mallea, a judge ruled in March, and the 
Supreme Court upheld the ruling last month. At a news conference, 
Mallea said he had been tortured and his legal rights violated. After a 
nationwide media campaign to secure Mallea's release, the National 
Evangelical Council's Rafael Goto told reporters that at least 55 
evangelical preachers in Peru have been jailed unfairly on charges of 
subversion. 

Protestants are burning Catholic paintings, Catholic bishops in 
Guatemala say. They called for government help to stop the practice and 
avert a possible religious civil war. The churchmen said members of the 
Bethania church have designated Fridays as the day to burn the images. 
"Each of the works that is lost...has a religious and historical 
value," and those who burn or steal them deserve to be punished, the 
bishops said. Onethird or more of the country's 9.5 million people are 
affiliated with evangelical churches, church growth experts estimate. 

Egyptian Christians can't advocate their faith in a way that challenges 
Islam, according to Menes Abdul Noor, pastor of Cairo's Garden City 
Church. Noor told Pulse that it is illegal to approach Muslims on the 
street evangelistically, to sell Muslims Christian books packaged as 
Islamic works, or to broadcast sermons that question the Islamic faith. 
...Muslim Egyptians are free, however, to listen to Christian 
broadcasts, buy explicitly Christian books, or initiate dialogue with 
Christians in which their two religions are compared. Since 1976, Noor 
has recorded radio programs broadcast throughout the Arab world by 
Trans World Radio. His 12,000-seat church, the Middle East's largest 
Protestant congregation, conducts three services each Sunday and holds 
prayer meetings, Bible studies, and student meetings most evenings of 
the week. The growth rate of the Protestant population in Egypt is 
2.7%, as compared with a 0.5% gain for Catholics and a 1.6% loss for 
Orthodox. 

A computer hypertext may provide ammunition for missionaries fighting 
the spread of Islam in Africa. Muslim ministry experts at Fuller 
Theological Seminary and at a London missions agency are planning an 
"Islamic hypertext," an electronic document containing up-to-date, 
Muslim-specific arguments to counter those made by a new wave of 
Islamic evangelists in Africa. According to former United Church of 
Christ missionary Curt Byers, native Muslims frequently visit Christian 
missions on "sheep-stealing expeditions." These preachers use ethnic 
and scriptural arguments to tear down years of Christian missionary 
effort. The hypertext will enable grass-roots ministers to answer the 
critics with the most timely and well-researched information experts 
can provide. The responses will use Scriptures from both the Christian 
and Muslim traditions. The project is only part of the recent 
proliferation of computer technology on the missions field. 

Some 115 Arab Christian leaders from 21 Arab-speaking nations across 
North Africa, the central Middle East, and the Arabian Peninsula met 
recently at a secret location in the Middle East. Leaders of the Arab 
World Evangelical Ministers' Association (AWEMA) are acutely aware of 
dangers of persecution by their neighbors, exploitation by Western 
Christians, and inter-ethnic mistrust among themselves, according to 
Partners International executive Francisco Velasquez, who attended as 
one of 45 nonArab observers. 
...The growing unity experienced by the 9-year-old grassroots alliance 
is exciting, Velasquez said. The groups' interaction is bridging the 
geographic distances and ethnic differences that have divided 
Christians who are Bedouin, Phoenician or Egyptian. One participant 
said it had been as if she had seen a lion in the desert, had dared to 
draw closer, and she discovered it was her brother. 
...Non-Arab Christian observers, dubbed "internationals," were advised 
to respect the indigenous nature of the movement and to avoid 
manipulative partnerships that create dependency. The internationals, 
in turn, affirmed the need to form more personal relationships with 
Arab brothers and form partnerships that leave the initiative and 
direction of ministry in Arab hands. Arab expositors emphasized the 
necessary work of the Holy Spirit to produce unity among believers. One 
speaker reviewed centuries of persecutions of Middle Eastern Christians 
by Western crusaders. The Christian Arabs testified to dangers at home, 
God's faithfulness to them, and God-given visions for ministry. Having 
proven capable of organizing themselves and addressing their issues in 
the presence of more experienced internationals, AWEMA next will 
arrange a meeting to teach invited non-Arabs how to minister in the 
Arab world, Velasquez said. 

"A breakthrough for missions" has been achieved, said Frank Kaleb 
Jansen, executive director of Colorado Springs-based Adopt-A-People 
Clearinghouse (NIRR 8/9/93). The 600page, two-volume, comprehensive 
"working list" of the world's ethnolinguistic groups was presented at 
the Adopt-A-People Consultation III April 24-26. Some 200 contributors 
supplemented the work of the project's five co-producers: AAPC, AD 2000 
and Beyond, Mission Advanced Research and Communication Center, the 
Southern Baptist Convention's Foreign Mission Board, and the Peoples 
Information Network. The church has access to 90% of the available 
knowledge about locating groups that can be adopted for prayer and 
ministry, Jansen said. 
...The "scary, pioneering work" of evangelizing unreached peoples is a 
nuisance to treasurers of Christian groups, who would prefer to 
continue with familiar missions programs like repairing school roofs, 
Jansen told NIRR. The thing that can move a church to do 
ground-breaking work for unreached groups is the force of organized 
intercessory prayer, he said. Jansen speculated that fear of making 
difficult commitments may have partially accounted for the low turnout 
of invited church representatives attending the consultation. 

A fourth vessel has been purchased by Mercy Ships, a missions fleet 
that delivers free health care to lesserdeveloped nations. The 
Norwegian passenger-cargo vessel Polarlys, renamed the Caribbean Mercy, 
is 265 feet long and weighs 2,200 tons. It will be staffed by a 
volunteer crew of 212, including doctors, nurses, navigation officers, 
and engineers. The ship is due to sail from Norway to Tampa, Fla., late 
this month, then to the Dominican Republic in June for an eightweek 
visit to offer health clinics and community-development assistance. The 
ship is to be fitted with an onboard hospital to care for the blind. 
Mercy Ships, a ministry of Youth With A Mission, currently operates in 
the South Pacific, Africa, and the Caribbean Basin. Mercy Ships' goal 
is to build a fleet of 10 ships by the year 2003 in order to serve 1 
million people a year. 

National Clergy Appreciation Day will be Oct. 9, according to 
proclamations by the governors of South Carolina and Missouri. Under 
His Wing Ministries of Williamsport, Pa. (NIRR 3/21), is promoting the 
special day in all 50 states. Leaders in Idaho, Hawaii, Iowa, North 
Carolina, and Kentucky have asked the group to find sponsors for the 
day in their states, according to UHWM's Jerry Frear. 

Sold for 1 million pounds: the only complete copy of William Tyndale's 
16th-century translation of the New Testament from Greek into English. 
The British Library last month announced it will pay about $1.5 million 
to acquire the Bible from Bristol Baptist College in southern England, 
its guardian since 1784. Another Tyndale Bible at St. Paul's Cathedral 
in London has 71 missing pages. In an age when only clergy and scholars 
could read the Bible, Tyndale hoped his translation would make it 
possible for the "boy that driveth the plough to know more of the 
Scriptures." Catholic leaders condemned Tyndale's work as heresy, and 
burned him at the stake in 1536. 

Procter & Gamble again was victimized by a false rumor about ties to 
Satanism. A flyer being distributed in some churches states that the 
president of the Cincinnati-based company said on the Phil Donahue show 
on March 1 that he is associated with the Church of Satan. The flyer, 
addressed to "fellow Christians," also indicates he said that a portion 
of profits from the company support the satanic church. The handout 
goes on to urge Christians to boycott a list of Procter & Gamble foods, 
as well as its cleaning and hygiene products. 
...It never happened, said a spokesman at Journal Graphics, the New 
York company that sells transcripts of television talk shows. A 
spokesman for Procter & Gamble said the rumor has surfaced every year 
for the past several years. The company has sued a dozen people in the 
last few years for spreading the rumor. few years for spreading the 
rumor.

The hand of God was evident in South Africa, Mangosuthu Buthelezi told 
reporters. The black conservative leader cited the providential 
influence of events leading to his Inkatha Freedom Party's last-minute 
decision to participate in the country's first allrace elections last 
week. 
...The persistence of a Kenyan Christian statesman was a key factor. 
Scholar Washington Okumo was one of seven international mediators who 
visited South Africa in mid-April to resolve constitutional differences 
separating Inkatha, Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, and the 
government. When the others left, believing their mission had failed, 
Okumo remained to speak with Buthelezi. The two had met at a prayer 
breakfast in Washington 20 years earlier, and had kept in touch since 
then "on the basis of Christian fellowship," Buthelezi said. An 
aircraft malfunction April 15 forced Buthelezi to return to a 
Johannesburg airport, where Okumo was waiting with proposals to resolve 
the dispute. "God prevented me from leaving," Buthelezi said. Okumo's 
mediation with President F.W. de Klerk and Mandela eventually led to an 
agreement, he added. 
...A Jesus Peace Rally in Durban that Sunday was another factor. More 
than 25,000 people, including a number of political leaders, attended. 
Buthelezi, ANC, and government officials reviewed the draft proposals 
at the rally, while Okumo hurried off to confer with Mandela. At the 
podium, rally organizer and evangelist Michael Cassidy, head of African 
Enterprise, called on South Africa's political leaders to humble 
themselves under God, forgive each other, and promote a spirit of calm 
and tolerance among their followers as a sign of political maturity. 
"We are here to say `No' to war, and `Yes' to peace...`No' to calamity, 
and `Yes' to Christ," he said. Later, Cassidy called for a leadership 
summit to bring about peaceful change. He indicated that Zulu King 
Goodwill Zwelithini, an Anglican, had sent a message saying he was 
praying that the interdenominational rally would result in "a new 
spirit of tolerance and understanding among all people and between all 
parties." Under the agreement that led Buthelezi and Inkatha to cease 
boycotting the vote, the Zulus would gain an autonomously governed 
region. 

More than 2,000 pygmies from Central Africa have accepted Christ. 
Evangelists from Colorado Springsbased Every Home for Christ traveled 
11 days by canoe to reach the remote Ituri rain forest in Zaire. There 
they entered a clearing and played a cassette of the gospel in their 
native dialect, put to music. After 30-40 minutes, natives began to 
stir and leave their hiding places in the forest, EHC President Dick 
Eastman said. Evangelists also left salt, a rare commodity for pygmies, 
on stumps of trees to draw them into the clearing. 
..."When a pygmy repents, it is one of the most amazing things you'll 
ever see," Eastman told NIRR. He indicated that pygmies consider 
themselves inferior to outsiders and rarely make eye contact with them. 
But when they pray to receive Christ they weep and sob, then "lift 
their eyes and look at you, and the biggest smile will come across 
their faces," he said. 

The gruesome martyrdom of a pastor in central India led to several 
hundred conversions to Christianity. A former Hindu who had changed his 
name to Paul James was murdered by a crowd of extremists as he spoke in 
a field prior to a Feb. 20 church service in the Phulabani district. 
..."Jesus, forgive them," eyewitnesses said James called out as his 
assailants cut off his hands and legs, and severed his torso. The 
attackers also decapitated James, an outspoken believer who had planted 
27 churches. The murder has drawn heavy media attention in the area, 
which is charged with Hindu-Muslim tensions. Some, but not all, of 
James' assailants reportedly have been caught. 
...The attackers' hatred and violence have left many Indians wanting to 
emulate the love shown by the victim, said K. Anand Paul, head of 
Gospel to the Unreached Millions. "The gospel is spreading because of 
persecution," said Paul, who has been beaten seven times and kidnapped 
once by fanatical religious groups. "We are risking our lives to do 
this. People need to pray for us." 

Thousands of Pakistani Christians marched through Lahore demanding that 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto repeal a law that requires the death 
penalty for blasphemy against Islam. Led by bishops of the Church of 
Pakistan and leaders of other minority religious groups, demonstrators 
also called for the arrests of three alleged Muslim extremists who shot 
and killed a Christian accused under the blasphemy law (NIRR 4/18). 
They threatened a hunger strike if the government failed to act. 
Minority legislators also pressed for change. Powerful people misuse 
the law to "avenge their personal animosities with the help of the 
police," Rofan Julius, also a clergyman, said. 
...Angry Pakistanis stoned a village doctor, doused him with kerosene, 
and burned him to death. He had been accused of burning a copy of the 
Koran. An Urdu-language newspaper reported the man accidentally knocked 
the book from his wife's hands during an argument, and it landed on a 
stove and caught fire. 

A Communist hitman in Thailand was brought to Christ by the native 
missionary he was sent to kill, according to Gospel for Asia. Tongsai 
Soonaruk, a missionary in Udornthani, reported that the man approached 
him and said, "If you don't stop sharing about Jesus, I will shoot 
you." Soonaruk responded that he was not afraid to die because "I am 
sure of my eternal life in heaven." The soldier was stunned. Soonaruk 
later led the man in a prayer of salvation. Soonaruk told GFA that the 
convert now is witnessing among his former comrades. 

A global consultation on the Bible, held in Dalfsen, Holland, April 
20-25, drew 200 leaders in Bible translation, publishing, and 
distribution. The purpose of the conference, sponsored by Forum of 
Bible Agencies, was to cooperate to avoid duplication of time and 
resources. In a statement, the leaders from nearly 60 countries 
confessed they had "sometimes engaged in sinful competition." 
...Western cultural dominance is hindering ministry in Third World 
churches, delegates said. The West must acknowledge the reality of a 
strong, mature church in the Third World, or it will "not only sound 
outdated, but ridiculous," Brazilian pastor Ricardo Rodrigues said. 
...Much work remains in Bible distribution and translation, delegates 
agreed. While the West has "spiritual anorexia" from unwillingness to 
read the Bible, the Third World suffers from spiritual hunger because 
the Bible often is not available, said the Lausanne Committee's Fergus 
Macdonald. United Bible Societies indicated that for every literate 
Christian in the world to own a New Testament by the year 2000, some 
200 million Bibles would have to be distributed every year. But in 
1993, the actual figure fell short of this by one-third. While 2,062 
languages have at least a portion of Scripture, 4,000 languages have no 
Scripture at all, participants were told. 
..."A new Dark Age is coming to Europe," said Michael Green, special 
adviser to the Archbishop of Canterbury. Yet, the church has a 
"wonderful opportunity" because successful, wealthy, and artistic 
secular people are finding that "materialism is not enough," and are 
open to "any ideas on the table." 
...New methods for communicating biblical truths must be found, 
delegates agreed. Several speakers urged them to make greater use of 
video and interactive computer programs in the West. Third-World 
delegates said oral story telling, drama, and art were important means 
of communication. "We do not need to choose between word and image.... 
Both are necessary," the final statement said. 

More than 150,000 men are expected to attend Promise Keepers 
conferences this summer. PK's national meeting last year in Boulder, 
Colo., drew at least 50,000 participants (NIRR 8/9/93). The first 1994 
conference, May 13-14 in Anaheim, will feature California pastors Jack 
Hayford, E.V. Hill, Chuck Smith, Charles Swindoll, and PK founder Bill 
McCartney. The five other conferences take place May 14 in Boise, 
Idaho; June 3-4 in Indianapolis; June 11 in Denton, Texas; June 18 in 
Portland, Ore.; and July 29-30 in Boulder. The conferences will 
continue to stress faith, relationships, family, church, brotherhood 
with other believers, and community life, PK's Kevin Skattum said. 
Tentative sites for 1995 include Atlanta, Washington, Minneapolis, 
Houston, Denver, Seattle, and Southern California. 
...New Man magazine will premiere at PK's Anaheim conference. The first 
issue of the bimonthly publication will feature a cover story on 
McCartney. The publication is designed to "encourage and equip men of 
integrity," and non-Christians seeking spiritual meaning in their 
lives. PK also is developing a series of "video magazines" for use by 
men in small Bible study and fellowship groups. 

Presbyterians are re-imagining their budget. The Presbyterian Church 
(U.S.A.) has downsized projections for missions in anticipation of 
financial protests over the infamous REImagining conference, for which 
the denomination was a key backer (NIRR 1/10). The staff leadership 
team of the General Assembly Council lowered 1994 revenue expectations 
by $1.9 million, and predicted a $1.2 million cut for 1995 missions, 
PCUSA News reported. 
...As of March, at least 185 of the PCUSA's 11,500 congregations 
indicated to church headquarters in Louisville, Ky., that they planned 
some kind of protest withholding. The churches accounted for $1,152,593 
in contributions to the denominational missions in 1992. Some churches 
also are reneging on pledges to the Bicentennial Fund, from which much 
of the RE-Imagining seed money came. The financial shortfall also will 
affect presbyteries and synods. The cuts will mean a greater need for 
cost-efficient management, but not staffing cuts, officials in 
Louisville said. Leaders of the 2.8-million-member PCUSA said the topic 
is certain to dominate discussion at the denomination's annual General 
Assembly in June. 

The laity must remain distinct from the priesthood for theological 
reasons, Pope John Paul II told a Vatican conference on lay 
participation in priestly ministry. He said lay people should refrain 
from taking up duties that are not proper for them. The blurring of 
that distinction, he warned, has caused "grave damage to the 
theological identity both of lay people and priests, and consequently 
to the entire work of evangelization." The Vatican is concerned about 
situations in places such as Switzerland and Germany, where "lay people 
are basically standing in for priests," a bishop told Religious News 
Service. A shortage of priests and a push by church members for a 
greater role in ministry have resulted in lay men and women taking over 
many tasks of priests, especially in the United States and western 
Europe (NIRR 4/18). 

The Vatican blessed altar girls, which many Catholic parishes in the 
United States and elsewhere have allowed for a decade. Revisions to 
canon law in 1983 omitted specific bans against letting females assist 
priests at Mass, but their participation was not sanctioned officially 
by the Church. U.S. bishops asked the Vatican to rule on the issue 
years ago, but opposition by traditionalists slowed deliberations 
within the Church's Congregation for Divine Worship and the Sacraments, 
sources indicated. 

An out-of-court settlement ended the $10 million sex abuse lawsuit 
Steven Cook filed against the Cincinnati Archdiocese and Catholic 
priest Ellis Harsham (NIRR 3/7). Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk said the 
settlement would save the archdiocese at least $100,000 in legal fees, 
but cost it an opportunity to clear the defendants before a jury. Cook 
originally had named Cardinal Joseph Bernardin in the suit, but dropped 
the prelate as a defendant in February. Cook said he was uncertain that 
his hypnosis-induced memories of Bernardin molesting him were accurate. 
He stood by his claim that Harsham molested him as a high school 
student, allegations the priest denied. Cook's attorney said his client 
settled the suit because he has AIDS and did not want to face a lengthy 
court case. 

An Episcopal bishop will be reinstated next month after a one-year paid 
leave -- despite admitting to an affair with a teen-age boy. Presiding 
Bishop Edmond Browning said it is "in the best interest of the church" 
to return Steven Plummer, the church's first Navajo bishop, to his 
leadership role over the Navajoland Area Mission in Arizona, New 
Mexico, and Utah. Browning added that the 225member House of Bishops 
voted in a closed session last month to accept his recommendation. 
..."Somewhat betrayed" is how members of the national Episcopal Council 
of Indian Ministries feel about the church's handling of the case, ECIM 
President Virginia Doctor told reporters. "We didn't think it was 
appropriate for a holy leader who is alleged to have done child sexual 
abuse to continue in that ministry." The group had asked Plummer to 
resign over his two-year tryst. News accounts also told of a division 
among the 1,500 church members in the Navajoland Area Mission, with the 
governing council split over age lines: older members are willing to 
forgive and forget; younger members want Plummer to step down. 

Church was no refuge for the president April 24. Randall Terry, former 
head of Operation Rescue, Pat Mahoney of the Christian Defense 
Coalition, and some followers concluded their nine-city "Impeach 
Clinton '94" bus tour outside Washington's Foundry Methodist Church, 
where the Clintons regularly attend. Sidewalk demonstrators prayed, 
chanted, and protested Clinton's stand on abortion and his alleged 
personal shortcomings. "We're here to confront the president and call 
on him to repent," Terry said. 
...Inside, the pastor's sermon noted a broad range of tough domestic 
and foreign problems Clinton must handle. "The president of the United 
States is entitled to know the people of America are praying deeply and 
spiritually for him," J. Philip Wogaman told the congregation, 
prompting vigorous applause. As the Clintons stepped onto the sidewalk 
after the service, Mahoney led a prayer aloud. "Father, this is not a 
Christian president," press accounts indicated he said. Terry and 
Mahoney later continued their protest outside the White House. The 
Clintons' Easter service at Foundry Methodist Church was interrupted by 
an AIDS activist. 

Hillary Clinton's faith led her to seek reform for America's 
health-care system. In a speech to Church Women United, the first lady, 
a United Methodist, said, "If you take your faith seriously, you have 
to [respect] the value and the lives of your fellow human beings." She 
also said her faith had helped her get through questions about 
Whitewater, cattle futures, and her ethics. 
...Clinton acknowledged that she struggles, sometimes unsuccessfully, 
with living by the principles of her faith. She said her parents and 
teachers at school and church taught her about "always being true to 
myself and always holding myself accountable, but according to more 
eternal values." She said it was not the headlines, but the "daily 
prods that come to me from the voices of my parents and the voices of 
my church...that I worry about most." 

Church health-care plans must be recognized under the Clinton reform 
proposal, the president told Don Walter, director of Pensions and 
Benefits Services for the Kansas City, Mo.based Church of the Nazarene. 
After a 90-minute televised town meeting, Walter spoke with Clinton, 
suggesting that churches are "unique small employers" that have 
different needs than other small businesses or profit-making companies. 
..."We obviously can't raise the price of religion if a health-care 
plan requires us to pay more money. We're already paying more than we 
can afford," Walter said. He suggested that churches, like other small 
businesses, should receive cost-containment subsidies, but not at the 
cost of losing their independence to increased governmental control or 
bureaucracy. Clinton aides who spoke with Walter said they had been 
working with Catholic bishops, but were interested in his views, 
Nazarene News Service reported. In a follow-up letter, Walter said "it 
will be necessary for many of us to lay aside our personal political 
agenda" and cooperate to make health-care reform successful. 

President Clinton adjusted his schedule to address an April 26 
Washington Insight Briefing sponsored by the National Association of 
Evangelicals. After expressing appreciation for the NAE's public policy 
and legal staff, he turned his attention to social problems facing 
America. On crime, he said, "We all agree we need more police on the 
street." His solutions included stiffening penalties for violent 
criminals and instituting prevention programs. 
...On teen pregnancy, Clinton cited evidence that both abstinence-based 
and safe-sex prevention programs have had successes and failures. A 
common thread in both approaches was the influence of caring adults who 
communicate values to children, he said. Clinton said local communities 
should decide which kind of education works best for them. 
...The NAE's Bob Dugan asked Clinton how he would fulfill the last part 
of his campaign promise to make abortions "safe, legal, and rare." The 
president said he supported legislation proposed by Sen. Howard 
Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) to facilitate adoptions. This, he said, was 
necessary because many states have policies that make inter-racial 
adoptions difficult. Clinton then stressed again a need for other 
programs that would reduce the number of teens having sex and babies. 
...Family and community breakdown, as well as joblessness, are the 
greatest problems facing the American people, Clinton said. "Whether we 
like it or not, whether we believe it is right or not, half of all 
mothers of children over the age of six work. We need to make it 
possible to succeed as workers and parents." 

Churches will have a new liaison office within the federal Department 
of Housing and Urban Development. HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros made the 
pledge April 21 while addressing more than 300 clergy and lay leaders 
from a dozen denominations at "The Black Church's Economic 
Responsibility for a New Urban Agenda." The conference was sponsored by 
Harvard Divinity School and the 2.5-millionmember Progressive National 
Baptist Convention. Cisneros called for the government and churches to 
work together on fair, decent, more-affordable housing, homelessness, 
and community revitalization, according to Religious News Service. He 
praised churches for their work in creating housing for the elderly and 
helping the homeless. In the future, any subsidized housing that 
reverts to HUD for resale will be offered to non-profits at a 30% 
discount, RNS reported. 

The EEOC extended its comment period until May 15 to allow the public 
more time to express its views on harassment guideline changes (NIRR 
3/7). The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission proposed 
modifications that would redefine religious harassment to include any 
workplace action or item that creates a "hostile" or "intimidating" job 
environment for others. The changes would put religious harassment on a 
par with sexual harassment, a federal crime. The original comment 
period deadline passed before many Christian groups were apprised of 
any changes to the federal agency's policies. Still, numerous groups 
rallied their supporters to protest new rules they said could create 
"religion-free" workplaces. 
...Christians responded en masse, and many received replies from their 
representatives or senators, Focus on the Family's public policy 
division reported. Most congressional letters, however, contained 
information drafted by staff at the EEOC, which incorrectly indicates 
it is only codifying existent law, said Atlanta labor lawyer Dudley 
Rochelle, who is credited with bringing the EEOC proposals to public 
attention. Focus, the Traditional Values Coalition, and other groups 
monitoring the progress of the revisions urge an immediate and 
continued protest to the EEOC, Congress, and the White House over the 
religious harassment issue. 

A group of Sikh students will not be returning to a California 
elementary school while the courts consider their religious freedom 
case. Five Khalsa Sikh students have been barred from classes in the 
Livingston School District since January for wearing small stainless 
steel knives known as kirpans. Sikhs are required to wear the knives at 
all times as part of their faith. The ACLU filed suit, arguing that the 
school district's restriction against the knives is an unconstitutional 
infringement of their religious freedom. An attorney for the Sikhs 
asked for an injunction to allow the pupils to return to class while 
the issue is thrashed out in court. A federal judge refused the 
request, but said he might reconsider following a full hearing this 
week. 

A fourth-grader's right to religious freedom may have been violated by 
his principal. Raymond Raines, 11, and his mother, Ellen, allege that 
several times he was stopped from praying quietly in the Waring 
Elementary School cafeteria. Their lawsuit, filed in federal court in 
St. Louis, also claims that Principal Cleveland Young disciplined 
Raymond for saying grace. The plaintiffs say Raymond was placed in 
detention in the cafeteria as punishment, and was "held up for 
embarrassment, contempt, and ridicule." The suit, which asks for 
unspecified damages, says the student is a Christian who regularly bows 
his head, folds his hands, and whispers a brief prayer for meals. 
...Young denied the accusations, and school officials said there was no 
evidence to support them. The principal and officials told reporters 
the school has no regulations that would prevent a pupil from saying 
grace. "All of this is a misunderstanding between the principal and the 
parent," said School Board President Earl Nance, Jr., a clergyman. 
Ellen Raines, who has since enrolled Raymond in a private school, says 
she wants the public school system to adopt and distribute a policy 
that explicitly allows pupils to engage in private prayer. Nance 
insists it is not needed because current policy recognizes the rights 
of pupils to hold any religious beliefs they wish. The Raineses are 
being represented in the suit by the Rutherford Institute, a 
Virginia-based religious-rights watchdog group. 

Bishop Knox did not violate the Constitution or school regulations by 
allowing students to read prayers over the intercom last November at 
Wingfield High School in Jackson, Miss., Judge Chet Dillard ruled. 
Students had voted to have prayers read over the school intercom, but 
protests led the school to discontinue the practice after three days 
(NIRR 1/24). The school superintendent fired Knox for insubordination. 
School board attorneys said Knox was told several times not to allow 
the prayers because they were unconstitutional. Amid protests 
nationwide, the board downgraded the principal's ouster to suspension 
without pay until July. 
...The judge ordered Knox restored immediately to his post with back 
pay. "We have completely missed the main objective of the Founding 
Fathers of our country when we reach the point where we construe our 
Constitution to allow students to have abortions, yet forbid them to 
pray in school," Dillard said in passing judgment. The Mississippi 
legislature recently passed a law allowing student-initiated prayer in 
schools beginning July 1. 

Puerto Rico's school voucher system has been halted. Under the plan, 
passed by the Legislature last year, students attending religious 
schools were given vouchers to help fund their education. A judge said 
the vouchers violate a section of the commonwealth's constitution that 
prohibits use of public funds "for the support of schools or educating 
institutions other than those of the state." Since Puerto Rico is a 
U.S. territory, American voucher advocates and foes saw the case as a 
gauge of the constitutionality of similar measures. 

The U.S. Army enlisted homeschool graduate Nathaniel Brown April 13. 
The Baptist pastor's son from Carlton, Mich., originally was denied 
entrance to the service because of his atypical educational background. 
The 17-year-old scored a 71 on his Armed Services Vocational Aptitude 
Battery, 21 points higher than required for general entrance. But local 
recruiters had no more openings for Tier 2 applicants, those with 
non-traditional high-school diplomas or equivalency degrees. 
...The move to reconsider Brown came from Operations headquarters at 
Fort Knox, Ky. Col. John Myers, director of Public Affairs for Army 
Recruitment, said applicants are considered on their merits, but within 
general guidelines. All recruits, he told the Christian radio talk-show 
Point of View, must be "mentally, morally, and physically qualified," 
which Brown proved to be. Brown told NIRR he did not think the Army had 
a bias against home-school applicants. Instead, the regulations were 
designed to save recruiters time and research, he said. Media attention 
and pressure from home-school advocates are said to have encouraged the 
Army to rethink its decision. The private also credited a lot to 
prayer. "I feel it's God's calling for me to go," and to serve his 
country, he said. 

Same-sex marriages may be legalized in Hawaii, unless the state can 
show a compelling reason for banning them. Last year the state Supreme 
Court said Hawaii must justify its denial of a marriage license in 1992 
to homosexuals Joseph Melillo and Pat Lagon. The state's high court 
overturned a state judge's dismissal of the gay couple's lawsuit, which 
alleged discrimination on the basis of gender. The court ruled that 
Hawaii's ban on same-sex marriages may be unconstitutional, but gave 
the state an opportunity to prove otherwise. The trial is to take place 
a year from now. 
...Late last month, the state House passed a bill defining Hawaii's 
compelling interests. It identifies a concern for the health and 
well-being of future generations. This, it said, is the basis for state 
regulation of marriage, including the issuance of licenses to only 
male-female couples. "The bill does not denigrate anyone's lifestyle, 
or dictate to anyone how to live their lives or who to love," House 
Judiciary Chairman Terrance Tom said in response to protests by 
homosexuals. The measure also creates an advisory board to study the 
possibility of domestic partnerships for homosexuals. Some suggest this 
would make the constitutionality issue moot. 
...A Senate proposal bypasses the compelling interest debate, leaving 
that issue for the state attorney general to argue in court. Instead, 
it contends that the Supreme Court illegally overstepped its bounds, 
and intruded on the legislature's sole constitutional authority to make 
laws. 
...No matter the decision, opponents and proponents of same-sex 
marriage are predicting tourist boycotts. In addition, lawmakers in 
other states warn they may refuse to recognize same-sex marriages. 

The woman who admitted she shot abortion doctor George Tiller outside 
his Wichita, Kan., clinic last summer drew a sentence of nearly 11 
years. The judge refused a prosecution request to double the time that 
Rachelle "Shelley" Shannon spends in prison. She was convicted March 25 
of attempted murder in the attack on Tiller, whose clinic has long been 
a target of pro-life activities (NIRR 4/4). At the sentencing, Shannon 
compared herself to Jesus, and insisted she had done nothing wrong. 

A pro-life center misled women by advertising free pregnancy tests and 
"options counseling," a judge in San Diego ruled. From now on, Judge 
Alpha Montgomery decreed, the Center for Unplanned Pregnancy must tell 
every caller that its counseling is "from a biblical anti-abortion 
perspective," and that CUP neither performs abortions nor provides 
abortion referrals. The judge also barred the center from performing 
pregnancy tests, or giving away over-the-counter kits, according to 
reports from the Southern California Christian Times. Under the ruling, 
CUP, which is located in the basement of a Presbyterian church, may not 
advertise in the Yellow Pages under clinics, abortion service 
providers, birth control information, or pregnancy options counseling. 
...Planned Parenthood filed the suit. Spokeswoman Leslie Sebastian said 
a woman, identified only as Jane Roe, found the center's ad in the 
Yellow Pages and went to get a pregnancy test, news sources said. "She 
went in, wanting abortion information, knowing nothing about this 
clinic," she testified. "While she was waiting for her pregnancy test 
results, they showed her an anti-abortion videotape, and it made her 
feel awful." The plaintiff later dropped out of the lawsuit, Christian 
Times reported. Two other centers named in the suit settled out of 
court, agreeing to change their advertising practices by identifying 
themselves as pro-life organizations, and a third closed. The decision 
"basically limits free speech rights and religious speech, it's going 
to severely limit what we do," Alan Shryer, the chairman of CUP's board 
of trustees, told The New York Times. 

Questions on abortion and contraceptives for teens were left unresolved 
at a three-week United Nations world population conference. The New 
York conference was to hammer out a proposed 20-year plan to stabilize 
world population growth, in preparation for final approval at a larger 
U.N. meeting in Cairo in September. Many delegates, including the U.S. 
ones, advocated the inclusion of abortion as part of the plan, and said 
it should be made easily accessible, as should the distribution of 
contraceptives to teens. But opposition by the Vatican and several 
other religious groups, along with several Latin American countries, 
prevented the inclusions. 
...The final document will not advocate legalizing abortion, U.N. 
official Nafis Sadik told a news conference. But she insisted that 
nations deal with its consequences as a health hazard, saying about 
250,000 women die each year from botched abortions. The plan calls for 
economic development, health care, equality of men and women, and 
better education for girls. It also contains language that would 
empower women to make choices on contraceptives and health needs. 
...Pope John Paul II called President Clinton on the final day of the 
conference, the White House said. Aides said they discussed the 
population conference, but declined to divulge details of the 
conversation. The Vatican earlier expressed its displeasure with the 
Clinton administration's stand on abortion. 
...Rescind the memo, 11 evangelicals urged Clinton in a letter. Led by 
Charles Colson and James Dobson, the co-signers asked him to void a 
March State Department cable asking U.S. consulates to lobby for a more 
liberal U.N. policy on abortion. Colson, Dobson, Charles Swindoll, John 
Perkins, Brandt Gustavson, Paul Cedar, Joseph Stowell, Bill Bright, 
Edwin Young, Billy Melvin, and D. James Kennedy described the cable as 
"an unprecedented misuse of our diplomatic corps for political ends," 
adding that the pressured countries, many with strong abortion laws, 
would "deeply resent what they regard as cultural imperialism." The 
leaders pleaded with the president "not to make the United States an 
exporter of violence and death." 

Prayers for government officials, such as Gov. Roy Romer and Sen. Ben 
Nighthorse Campbell, are being aired in Colorado. Crawford Broadcasting 
Company's radio station KLZ in Denver is holding live, hour-long prayer 
sessions every Monday morning as station DJs pray for invited guests. 
"The Changing Heart of Colorado" program is sponsored by the Rocky 
Mountain Prayer Network and Concerts of Prayer. Radio show host Joy 
Mandell told NIRR the sessions are one-of-a-kind in the nation. 
..."Our goal is not to criticize their opinions, but just to bless 
their positions as leaders. We're trying to build relationships with 
these men and women," Mandell told NIRR. She said the show is simulcast 
on Colorado Crawford stations to 60,000 listeners in Wyoming and New 
Mexico. She said the show hopes to promote racial reconciliation 
throughout Colorado, and that several pastors have joined her to pray 
on the air as well. Crawford is considering expanding the prayer show 
to its 15 other stations around the nation. 

Americans' interest in religion is much greater than in sports, 
Associated Press religion writer George Cornell said in a column last 
month. He noted that religious giving in 1992 totaled $56.7 billion, 
about 14 times the estimated $4 billion spent on professional baseball, 
football, and basketball, the three largest sports. Using Gallup Poll 
figures, Cornell placed cumulative attendance at houses of worship 
during 1993 at 5.6 billion. This, he said, was 55 times greater than 
the 103-million total attendance reported by the three main 
professional sports leagues. Attendance at all U.S. sporting events 
totaled 388 million in 1990, according to one publication's tally. 
Religious services drew about 13 times more people, Cornell said, with 
attendance of 5.2 billion. 
...Full-time religion reporters are rare at newspapers and major 
broadcast outlets. Only about 50 of 1,600 dailies and one TV network 
have even one full-time religion reporter, although nearly all have 
multi-member sports staffs. 

Report about religion seriously and accurately, Billy Graham urged in a 
speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors in Washington last 
month. He offered suggestions on how to do it: make it a matter of 
policy to report more religious news, both from the local community and 
the broader world; probe the religious, moral, and ethical dimensions 
of some headline stories; establish contacts with religious leaders to 
better understand them and their work; and seek qualified journalists 
for the religion beat. Examples of important religion news that have 
received scant, if any, attention from the secular press include 
dramatic church growth in China and the changing religious situation in 
the former Soviet Union, he said. 
...The presidency deserves more respect from newspapers, which should 
stop constantly probing Bill Clinton's personal life, Graham said in a 
question-answer period. "He probably made mistakes [and] did things 
that he regrets, as I do, as we all do." Graham agreed that a 
president's character is relevant, but "none of us is perfect" and "the 
press has gone too far." 
...Fellow evangelical Cal Thomas chided Graham several days later in a 
nationally syndicated column for being too hard on the press about the 
presidential character issue. It touches everything from legislation to 
conflicts of interest, and if that is not relevant to the press, then 
"we are unindicted co-conspirators in the general cultural decline," he 
wrote. 

Richard Nixon is in heaven, Billy Graham told a CNN call-in show 
audience the day after the former president died. The evangelist said 
Nixon was raised by a devout Quaker mother, and in his youth "gave his 
life to Christ" after an invitation at Los Angeles' Church of the Open 
Door. Graham remembered that Nixon had said he regretted many things 
about his Watergate period, including "some of the language on the 
tapes." But Graham told callers he still felt Nixon was a man of 
genuine faith, whose positives outweighed his negatives. 
...The evangelist preached at the president's funeral, as he did at 
services for Nixon's wife, Pat. In a statement, Graham said he and 
Nixon had been "close personal friends" since 1950. Graham and his 
wife, Ruth, were frequent guests at the White House while Nixon was 
president, and the evangelist conducted several Sunday services there. 
Graham said he later sought Nixon's advice prior to his historic visits 
to the former Soviet Union, China, and North Korea. 
...Graham was among the first at the hospital after the stroke that was 
to take Nixon's life. The evangelist, who was in New York on personal 
business, said he was unable to see the former president, but prayed 
with his daughters, Tricia Cox and Julie Eisenhower. He also spoke by 
telephone with President Clinton about Nixon's condition. 
..."A kind, decent, caring human being" was Charles Colson's eulogy of 
Nixon. The Prison Fellowship founder, who was convicted on Watergate 
charges, remembered his former boss as "a man of extraordinary 
intellect, vision and courage." 

Marvin Gorman accepted more than $1.8 million in an out-of-court 
settlement with rival TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart (NIRR 2/21). His 
original suit asked for $90 million, and was filed after the two traded 
allegations of sexual misdeeds. Half of the money will go to Gorman's 
attorney Hunter Lundy, under an order by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Jerry 
Brown. Of the remainder, 90% will go to the estate of Gorman's bankrupt 
ministry, and 10% to Gorman and his wife, who filed for personal 
bankruptcy. 

A pastor won $5 million in this year's Reader's Digest sweepstakes. 
Lonnie Harris, 47, leads the 35-member independent Bethel House of 
Prayer in Clovis, S.C. He, his wife, and four children flew -- all for 
the first time -- to Digest headquarters in suburban New York to pick 
up a check for $287,000, the first installment of a projected 29-year 
payout, Religious News Service reported. Harris was replacing the door 
hinge of his 1975 Ford van when the letter arrived. He said he planned 
to buy a new van large enough to carry the amplifiers used by his 
traveling gospel music group, and "maybe some new clothes." Harris also 
wants to help the needy in his community. 

Christy captured 20% of the viewing audience on its first Thursday 
night airing, beating The Simpsons, Byrds of Paradise, and The Sinbad 
Show, according to ratings reports. The series is based on Catherine 
Marshall's novel about her mother, who left the comfort of Asheville, 
N.C., to teach at an Appalachian mission school in 1912 (NIRR 
12/27/93). The book rocketed from 120th to 15th on the best-seller list 
since the show began, said Executive Producer Ken Wales, who is an 
evangelical. He told Religious News Service that the pilot series will 
be a test of public desire for more shows about values and faith. "The 
entire industry is waiting to see what happens to this show. If it 
doesn't work, the best chance is already taken." Several Christian 
media groups asked supporters to urge CBS to renew the show for a full 
season. 

Young Life will recruit staff for the ministry through new programs, 
according to YL President Denny Rydberg. The first of three new 
programs, Young Life Corps, is modeled after the Peace Corps, and 
begins this fall. Recent college graduates, or others in their early 
20s, would volunteer to minister on university campuses or in city 
ministries. Mentored by current Young Life staffers, YLC volunteers 
would raise some of their own support, but would live rent-free with 
host families. Second, the Young Life Internship Program will offer 
ministry opportunities to college juniors. They will train for two 
years while doing volunteer work. The third program, Second Wind, will 
provide similar training to career-changers. 
...YL will expand with two more camps due to a space crunch. The 
ministry has purchased property in Alum Springs, Va., and is trying to 
raise $24 million to buy the 960-acre Crooked Creek Ranch near Winter 
Park, Colo. About 25,000 youth attended YL camps last year, but 4,000 
prospective campers were turned away because facilities were full. This 
year's camps will run at 110% occupancy, Rydberg said. 

The only evangelical minister in Sarajevo will start over in Serbia. 
After five years of cultivating a congregation of believers and 
purchasing a building among the 500,000 Muslims in the Bosnian capital, 
Boris Kacarevic and his family left their scattered flock and destroyed 
building. Bob Savage of Partners International said Kacarevic has not 
given up. After a time of healing and renewal, the church planter with 
the Evangelical Church intends to begin again in an unevangelized city. 

Bucharest's first local radio station to offer Christian programming 
went on the air April 11. The 2 million residents of Romania's capital 
finally can hear Christian programs produced locally, according to 
Elisei Rusu, a Romanian missionary collaborating with Chicago-based 
International Teams. Rusu told NIRR that 94.2 FM is the first of five 
Christian stations scheduled to debut in Romanian cities this year. 
...The stations will form the Voice of the Gospel FM radio network. The 
outreach is being launched by the Evangelical Alliance of Romania and 
the Romanian Missionary Society. Rusu said he knew of no objections by 
the Orthodox church to the broadcasts, which will include interviews 
and discussions of contemporary issues. Christian programming had been 
available in Romania only from Radio Free Europe and HCJB's satellite 
broadcasts. 
...Timotheus Bible Institute has begun training 50 prospective religion 
teachers for Romania's schools. In 1990, the government approved 
religious education in public schools, but many still lack trained 
teachers. Classes are meeting in rented space until construction of the 
school is finished next spring. Rusu said Timotheus will instruct 175 
students, including pastors who will commute to class, and will house 
50. Immanuel Bible Institute in Oradea also is training Protestant 
teachers. It is sponsored by the Wheaton, Ill.,-based Romanian 
Missionary Society. 

Correction: The Brethren in Christ Church reports it saw a 7.3% rise in 
total giving (to $22.8 million) and a 1.7% increase in membership in 
1992. according to its stewardship director, Ed Rickman. The preface to 
the 1994 Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches indicates that its 
statistics are drawn from a variety of sources and may not be 
comprehensive, thus cannot always be used to compare figures among 
denominations. figures among denominations.

Brutal persecution of Protestants is increasing steadily in the former 
Soviet Union. A systematic "cleansing" of Protestants, similar to that 
experienced by all faiths under Stalin, could occur soon in the 
Commonwealth of Independent States, said Boris Perchatkin, an 
evangelical Christian and former Soviet dissident. As order breaks down 
in Russia and the surrounding republics, strongmen attached to the 
Muslim and Russian Orthodox establishments are filling the power void, 
Perchatkin told Baptist Press. In February, the Russian Army formed an 
alliance with a million-member military organization with historical 
roots in the Cossack people. The groups pledged loyalty to Russian 
Orthodoxy and war against Protestants, he said. The danger to foreign 
missionaries is great in Cossack areas, Perchatkin told NIRR. 
Protestantism is seen as a American plan to interfere, with the 
sinister motive of stealing Russia from the Russians. 
...The worldwide euphoria in recent years over Russia's freedom is 
fading, he said. "One and a half years ago, I myself didn't believe 
this was going on," Perchatkin told BP. But as his organization, the 
Russian American Institute for Adaptation, uncovers increasing evidence 
of persecution, "this horrible picture is forming. We have a very short 
time." 
...Many Russian Christians fear for their lives and thousands are ready 
to leave, Perchatkin warned U.S. congressmen, advisers to President 
Clinton, and State Department officials. He brought signatures of 700 
Protestant families -- mostly Baptist, Pentecostal, and Seventh-Day 
Adventist -- who he said would leave immediately if Western nations 
would take them. Some fear their own violent death after hearing for 
months of kidnappings, tortures, murders, lynchings, and threats. 
Perchatkin told NIRR that many of these people will not pick up a 
weapon in self-defense because of their faith. 
...Evidence of atrocities -- including personal testimonies and 
photographs -- helps document the persecution so Christians can enter 
the United States. The evidence is gathered by Perchatkin's group, 
which is based in Portland, Ore., and employs six fulltime workers in 
Moscow, including former Catholic dissident Valery Sanderov. Former 
Orthodox dissident Gleb Yakunin (NIRR 11/29/93) is a consultant. In 
addition to evidence of persecution however, current U.S. law requires 
that refugees have a close relative in this country, effectively 
closing the door to many, Perchatkin said. Some 30,000 Russian 
immigrants entered the United States from 1988 to 1990, while the same 
number have been admitted during the past four years. Perchatkin said 
officials still allow eight Jewish immigrants to every two non-Jewish 
ones. 

The need for trained pastors in the former Soviet Union has prompted 
Regent University to establish the Institute of Leadership Training 
this fall. Its six-month courses in Kiev, Ukraine, will teach some 300 
Christian leaders from the C.I.S., said Carolyn Hedgpeth, Regent 
adjunct professor and institute principal. 
...CBN has compiled a database of the more than 5,000 people who 
respond weekly to its broadcasts to the C.I.S. Since beginning its work 
there, the Christian Broadcasting Network has seen some 10 million 
responses, Hedgpeth told NIRR. The Association of International Mission 
Services, led by Regent professor Howard Foltz, is recruiting churches 
and agencies in the United States, Southeast Asia, and Europe to help 
plant churches and to sponsor training for new pastors, who often have 
as little as three weeks' theological education. AIMS uses the database 
to help U.S. missions and congregations invite CBN respondents to 
attend church-planting rallies. More than 100 churches have been 
started, and 18 more will be organized this month, Hedgpeth said. 

Rwanda's tribal war has killed thousands of church members. Clergy, 
nuns, and employees of religious relief groups have been shot, hacked, 
and bludgeoned to death. This month, decades-old tensions erupted when 
Hutus acted to avenge the killing of the Hutu presidents of Rwanda and 
Burundi, whose plane was shot down, allegedly by Tutsi rebels opposing 
the government. 
...Churches were packed until the recent reign of terror, said Jim 
Kirkpatrick, the Free Methodists' area director for Equatorial Africa. 
Their churches had been experiencing a "most heartening harvest, real 
growth, and good leadership training," he told NIRR from Nairobi, 
Kenya. Pastors and lay evangelists, amazed that they had survived last 
year's interethnic warfare, eagerly were evangelizing their fellow 
countrymen. People were repenting because they had seen how short life 
can be, Kirkpatrick said. 
...At the Jesuit-operated Christ Spiritual Center in Kigali, the 
capital, majority tribal Hutus broke in, locked visiting Belgians and 
Spaniards in a room, then killed the Tutsi Rwandans. They included 
three Jesuit monks, five diocesan priests, 11 nuns, and a social 
worker, according to reports radioed to the Vatican. Others reportedly 
were massacred at a Franciscan mission in Kigufe. At offices of Western 
relief groups in Kigali, including British-based Oxfam, gunmen shot 
dozens of workers in front of expatriates, a Belgian charity official 
said. 
...U.S. and European troops escorted many foreigners to neighboring 
Burundi, also a powderkeg of unrest, where they boarded planes for 
Nairobi. Having huddled in fear for days, many of the 250 Americans in 
Rwanda, most of them church workers, hurriedly drove to the airport 
during lulls in the shooting, dodging bodies, bullets, and fires along 
the way. Baptist missionary David Hooten, who fled with his two young 
children, described the scene as murderous and chaotic -- "a complete 
mess, a shattered state, a destroyed people." 
...After a bloodbath at a SeventhDay Adventist college northwest of 
Kigali, 72 foreigners escaped unharmed to Zaire. Gerry Karst, an 
Adventist official in Maryland, told reporters that by then the bodies 
of about 200 Africans were strewn across the Central African University 
campus. The Adventists have 300,000 members, and is the second-largest 
church mission in Rwanda (only Catholics have more). Other 
denominational leaders told NIRR that all of their missionary families 
had escaped: 15 Southern Baptists, 19 Free Methodists, four 
Conservative Baptists, and two Evangelical Friends missionaries were 
reported safe in Nairobi. One American Adventist stayed in Kigali. 
..."Just pray," Free Methodist Bishop Aaron Ruhumuriza told Kirkpatrick 
by telephone from Kigali. He said he was harboring 50 native believers 
in his home because they could not escape. Kirkpatrick said that 
missionaries who fled Rwanda delivered an unconfirmed report that 
African Christians taking refuge in a Free Methodist church were 
massacred. Other churches' missionaries fear the same for their Rwandan 
friends and spiritual co-workers. 
...The fighting may taper off in the next month or so, Kirkpatrick 
speculated. Although many missionaries will wait, hoping to return, 
those who witnessed the most violence may need more time to recover, he 
said. Hooten said, "We would love to [go back], but life is dangerous 
out there." Eleazar Ziherambere, secretary general of the Baptist Union 
of Rwanda, appealed by telephone for Christians to pray "that the God 
of miracles will bring peace." 

"An inexpressible tragedy," Pope John Paul II called the events in 
Rwanda. Opening a month-long Vatican Synod on Africa, the pontiff 
appealed for an end to "the homicidal violence [and] fratricidal 
massacres." The African church, he said, is called to promote "an 
urgent and radical work of reconciliation." Fourteen African cardinals 
and 160 bishops, along with scholars and prelates from other countries, 
are participating in the synod. Agenda items include relations with 
Islam and local religious traditions, Africa's AIDS crisis, and 
political instability. The synod's working document warned that 
Christians and Muslims must avoid "a dangerous collision course," as 
both religions seek converts. 

Top South African politicians attended an Easter service with an 
estimated 1 million adherents of the country's largest church. At Zion 
Christian Church, President F.W. de Klerk, African National Congress 
leader Nelson Mandela, and Zulu nationalist Mangosuthu Buthelezi joined 
in prayer with other political leaders. They were not allowed to speak 
since the congregation observes strict political neutrality, according 
to news accounts. The service, part of an annual pilgrimage, took place 
on a hillside at a church village in rural Transvaal. ZCC Bishop 
Barnabas Lekganyane called on the politicians to do more to create 
peace in the troubled country. He said he had met privately with each 
of the leaders and considered them peace-lovers. 

The revival in China today is unequaled in the 2,000 years of the 
Christian church, according to Tony Lambert, author of The Resurrection 
of the Chinese Church and editor of Overseas Missionary Fellowship's 
China Insight. Lambert told NIRR that although revival is occurring 
throughout the country, it began in Henan and Wenzhou, two areas the 
atheistic government specifically had targeted 30 years ago for 
religious cleansing. "It is the work of God, not the Western church," 
Lambert said. But the growth is not without persecution. Amnesty 
International said China has detained more than 30 Christians since two 
new regulations on religion took effect in January (NIRR 2/21). 
Authorities also recently placed six Protestant preachers detained 
since last summer in a labor camp, AI said. 
...When missionaries "charge into China where angels have feared to 
tread," they often create dangerous situations for both foreign and 
Chinese Christians, Elizabeth Lowe of OMF's China Awareness program 
said. Lowe, a Chinese Christian educated in the West, told 80 
participants at an OMF seminar in Denver that the government 
increasingly resists consumerism, Islam, and Christianity. 

Millions of World Cup soccer fans will be the focus of an evangelistic 
campaign in nine U.S. cities this summer. The campaign is being 
coordinated by Pasadena, Calif.-based Sports Outreach America (SOA). It 
is the first time the World Cup, the world's largest sporting event, 
has been held in this country. The best 24 soccer teams in the world 
will compete in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, New York, Chicago, 
Boston, Detroit, Washington, and Orlando. The tournament begins June 17 
and culminates with a final game in the Rose Bowl July 17. 
...Christian literature -- including a special edition of Sports 
Spectrum magazine and the International Bible Society's Sports New 
Testament -will be handed out to visitors. Local church members will 
distribute literature door-to-door, at airports, games, and World Cup 
breakfasts. Professional and semiprofessional players will run 
outreach-oriented soccer clinics and tournaments for children. In Los 
Angeles, evangelistic crusades by Luis Palau, Raul Reis, and Greg 
Laurie will be held in connection with the games, as will a one-day 
soccer festival and Spanish concert called La Celebracion. 
...An even larger outreach is being planned for the 1996 Atlanta Summer 
Olympics (NIRR 5/31/93). Together with the World Cup they make a 
"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity" for American evangelism, according to 
SOA Executive Director Ralph Drollinger. Some 100 national ministries, 
including 40 denominations, are meeting in Atlanta April 27 to form a 
cooperative outreach to America's 200 largest population centers during 
the Olympic games. 

A drug firm's prayer network has attracted physicians in 325 offices 
throughout the nation. General Injectables and Vaccines, a medical 
distributor in Bastian, Va., offers the ministry to its 100,000 
customers. A leaflet explaining the service is tucked into invoices. 
Doctors who request more information receive a letter from GIV, along 
with studies showing the health benefits of intercessory prayer. When 
physicians call a special toll-free number, a counselor takes the 
prayer request and enters it into a computer file. Twenty GIV employees 
pray for the requests daily or weekly. Three full-time staff ministers 
log requests, follow up on them, and pray. "Praying for our customers' 
needs is the best service we can provide," GIV President John Gregory 
told Physician magazine. In addition to the prayer ministry, GIV also 
runs a homeless shelter, a food bank, and a program to help the poor 
find housing. For information, call 1-800-772-9123. 

Church groups meet in pubs in order to attract unchurched British men 
"for a pint and a chat, and perhaps a few words from an invited 
speaker," said Max Sinclair, chairman of Christian Viewpoint for Men. 
CVM includes 100 groups across England. Unchurched men often consider 
church a strange environment where they "don't quite understand the 
etiquette or language," Sinclair told Alpha magazine. The men are more 
willing to attend events or meetings that are tailored to them, he 
said. 
...Patience is needed with unchurched men seeking Christ, Sinclair 
said. It often takes them four years to come to Christ. Men who are 
considering Christianity need the "freedom to challenge, ask questions, 
and bat it around," he said. Even then, it is easy to "blow it by 
expecting too much of them" once the men begin to assimilate into the 
church. Unchurched men are afraid of being "emotionally mugged" by 
being forced to share their feelings, or being thrust too quickly into 
leadership roles. 

Madrid's largest evangelical church consists largely of recovering drug 
addicts. The congregation, Betel (Spanish for Bethel), is the spin-off 
of a drug rehabilitation ministry with the same name, founded nine 
years ago by WEC International missionaries Elliott and Mary Tepper. 
About 700 recovering heroin addicts reside in Betel communities in 10 
cities around Spain. The Madrid church has more than 400 members, 250 
of whom are former or recovering addicts, minister Kent Martin told 
NIRR. The organization also works in Naples, Italy, in Ceuta and 
Melilla, Morocco, and in Brooklyn, N.Y. 
...Many former addicts in the church are infected with the AIDS virus. 
Betel's first convert, now a ministry leader, is among them. The same 
is true for many of Betel's key leaders in 11 of the 15 cities where 
the ministry works. Martin urged Christians to "dare to believe that 
God will heal them physically as He has done spiritually." 

One Christian was shot to death in Lahore, Pakistan, and three others 
wounded by gunmen on a motorcycle, were identified by witnesses as 
Muslim extremists. They had just attended a court hearing in which 
three of them, including a 13-year-old, were accused of blasphemy, a 
capital crime. The fourth was a family friend. 
...Chanting Muslims demanded their execution from outside the 
courthouse. The three were arrested last June for allegedly writing 
anti-Islamic graffiti on mosque walls. An imam accused the youth of 
scrawling antiMuslim slogans, and tossing scraps of paper inscribed 
with derogatory remarks against the Prophet Muhammad into mosques. 
However, Pakistani human rights monitors said the youth is illiterate 
(NIRR 11/15/93). 
...Hundreds of non-Muslim Pakistanis have been arrested under blasphemy 
laws introduced in the early 1980s, and cases can take years to 
resolve, news sources reported. Defendants often claim the charges have 
been fabricated (NIRR 3/8/93). Six Anglican Pakistani bishops called 
for the country's blasphemy law to be repealed, saying it "is being 
used as a weapon of persecution against Christians." The prelates made 
their appeal at the funeral of the slain Christian, Manzoor Masih, 35. 
This month, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's cabinet agreed to amend the 
blasphemy laws. Convictions for false accusations of blasphemy would be 
punishable by 10 years in jail. Of Pakistan's 120 million people, 
approximately 6 million are nominally Christian, researchers say. 

The evacuation of Jews from the former Yugoslavia continues. The 
Wallenberg Center, a Christian ministry in Budapest, Hungary, has 
helped relocate Jews in peril, especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Working closely with the humanitarian Jewish Agency, a Wallenberg team 
has made several visits to Sarajevo, according to the International 
Christian Embassy in Jerusalem. Most Jews have left the areas of 
heaviest fighting, but a few hundred waited too long to leave and are 
trapped in the war-torn enclaves. In addition, the center's staff took 
aid to distribute among the 500,000 refugees in Belgrade. 
...The Wallenberg Center also provides medical aid and clothing to 
elderly Jews in Romania, Hungary, and western Ukraine. Staff members 
Rhys and Karen Davies say their delivery of aid to a Ukrainian 
synagogue last winter brought them in touch with 200 death camp 
survivors. The Davieses said the synagogue leaders thanked them for 
their assistance and indicated their interest in emigration to Israel. 

A missionary was kidnapped in Colombia. Ray Rising, a 51-year-old radio 
technician for the Summer Institute of Linguistics, never returned from 
his March 31 trip to Puerto Lleras. He was seen leaving the town to 
return to the SIL base at Lomalinda, but a search party found his 
motorcycle between the two sites. Earlier this year, rebel groups 
threatened to seize Americans as "prisoners of war." But neither the 
mission nor Rising's wife, Doris, an SIL computer operator, has heard 
from guerrilla groups demanding ransom or claiming responsibility for 
his disappearance. SIL missionaries Timothy Van Dyke and Stephen Welsh, 
both abducted in January, still are missing. The translation agency 
requests prayer for all. 
...A Food for the Hungry worker, Melissa Himes, remains a ransomed 
hostage of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. The 24-year-old and three 
Cambodian staffers were abducted March 30. They reportedly went to 
settle a dispute over the digging of wells with the National Army for 
Democratic Kampuchea. Two of her three colleagues were released to 
convey a message to the FFTH field office. The other was freed later. 
...An April 3 note from Himes indicated she was being treated well, and 
that the rebels were holding her because they want more wells drilled. 
The Scottsdale, Ariz.-based relief group has said it cannot afford to 
pay the ransom, but it is willing to do additional development work in 
guerrilla-held areas. 

Disruptions of churches by protest groups must be prosecuted, the U.S. 
Civil Rights Commission told the Justice Department. The commission 
asked Justice to enforce existing laws that ban such intrusions. 
"Actions of religious bigots should not be tolerated in a nation 
dedicated to religious freedom," the commission's April 1 letter said. 
Of special concern are the growing number of intrusions at religious 
services by homosexual activists protesting churches' stands against 
homosexual practices and condom distribution, the commission said. Acts 
of vandalism at churches and synagogues also were noted as causes for 
stepped-up enforcement. Panel members also voted unanimously to urge 
Attorney General Janet Reno to address the issue publicly. 
...The letter echoes legislation sponsored by Sen. Orrin Hatch (RUtah), 
a Mormon. The Senate approved his religious freedom amendment to the 
Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (NIRR 12/13/93). The 
addendum, not included in the House-passed version of the FACE bill, 
bars interference with individuals' rights of religious freedom at 
churches and synagogues, and prohibits destruction of religious 
property. The bill is in committee to resolve differences between 
versions. 

A witch sued two pastors recently in Jonesboro, Ark. Self-proclaimed 
Wiccan Terry Riley charged that Nazarene pastors Bob Wirtmiller and 
Terry Schakelaar violated his religious rights by encouraging local 
building owners not to rent space for his occult-supply business. 
Nazarene News Service said that Riley brought the suit after he was 
evicted from a building owned by a member of Wirtmiller's church. He 
took his claim of discrimination to the media, and later organized a 
march of supporters. A judge in Craighead County Court dismissed the 
charges April 4. 

School districts discriminate against churches when they charge them 
higher rents to use the facilities, a federal appeals court ruled. The 
Fairfax County (Va.) School Board had been charging churches from two 
to five times as much as other nonprofit groups that rented for the 
same time period (NIRR 2/8/93). After a certain period of time, 
churches were expected to move elsewhere. The board could be liable for 
more than $1.1 million in overcharges to eight congregations, according 
to news accounts. Fairfax Covenant Church, which filed the lawsuit, is 
seeking more than $340,000 in back rent and interest, pastor Benny 
Phillips said. School officials, who said they plan to appeal, 
estimated that 50 churches use county school facilities. 

The Impressions reading series passes constitutional muster and can be 
used in public schools, the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals 
ruled. A group of Christian parents sued Chicago's School District 200, 
complaining that the series (NIRR 10/4/93) fostered religious belief in 
"wizards, sorcerers, giants," thus violating church-state separation 
under the First Amendment. The plaintiffs also said the series 
indoctrinates children against their Christian beliefs by "teaching 
tricks, despair, deceit, parental disrespect, and by denigrating 
Christian symbols and holidays." The court affirmed a district court 
decision. The religion that was allegedly being established "seems for 
all the world like a collection of exercises in `make-believe' designed 
to develop and encourage the use of imagination and reading skills," 
the court said. 

State-sponsored prayer in public schools is a bad idea, said 400 rabbis 
and Christian clergy, including the heads of several denominational and 
national agencies. They signed an open letter to school superintendents 
and local school board presidents. The clergy said their opposition was 
based on "our faith and our belief in the sanctity of prayer." The 
letter, organized by People for the American Way, is the first 
full-fledged effort by mainstream religious leaders to counter the 
campaign of some conservative Christians to restore prayer to public 
schools. Among the letter's signers were officials from the Evangelical 
Church in America, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A), and the United 
Church of Christ. 

Released-time education will present the gospel to more than 250,000 
public school students -- including more than 100,000 who have no 
church affiliation -- this school year (NIRR 10/4/93). Released-time 
programs, in which public school students voluntarily leave their 
campuses to pursue religious instruction, now exist in 2,000 school 
districts, according to the Ellijay, Ga.-based National Association for 
Released Time Christian Education. 
...The program has grown from 109 programs last year to 120 now, with 
10-15 new programs expected by next fall, according to NARTCE Director 
Roger Blankenship. There are programs in more than 30 states. Thousands 
of young people already have become believers through the program, he 
said. A young satanist who tortured animals and drank their blood came 
to faith in Christ. He had heard the gospel from a student whose life 
had been touched through the released-time program, Blankenship told 
NIRR. 
...Interested parents can start a program in their community, invite a 
NARTCE speaker to their church to explain the ministry, sponsor a 
child's released-time class for $10 a month, or coordinate an area-wide 
releasedtime workshop. For information, call (706) 276-7900. 

Charismatic experiences at Messiah College created a stir this month at 
the Brethren in Christ school. Students in the new Narrow Gate 
Fellowship practiced exuberant worship. Spiritual gifts and physical 
and emotional healing were reported. Student leader Andy Wertz told 
NIRR that an uproar over the events prompted a meeting with 
administrators in early April to correct false impressions about the 
group. Critics had accused the group of having charismatic doctrinal 
views that were exclusivist and self-serving, College Chaplain Eldon 
Fry told NIRR. 
...Prayer groups are thriving at Messiah, according to Fry. Student 
attendance at three intercessory fellowships, two of which are new this 
year, has mushroomed from a few dozen students to about 500. The 
Grantham, Pa., college has an interdenominational student body among 
which Fry noted "real healing, a real move of the Spirit." Some 
students have felt rejection, others have asked cautious questions 
creating "healthy conversations," while others have sensed God's 
presence, he said. 

U.S. youth leaders are uniting May 3-4 to pray for the country's young 
people. Presidents of 25 parachurch organizations and denominational 
ministries will gather for the second time in Washington as a precursor 
to the National Day of Prayer. They will pray and "compare notes" on 
their ministries, according to Paul Fleischmann, executive director of 
the National Network of Youth Ministries. James Dobson will lead an 
informal time of sharing during the meeting. 
...A large rally at Atlanta's Georgia Dome also is planned for Feb. 
10-11, 1996. Youth ministries will hold separate conferences, then come 
together for a joint rally, seminars, and exhibits, Fleischmann said. 
Already more than 20 organizations are committed to the event, 
including almost all major parachurch organizations. Many youth workers 
have dreamed of such an event, Fleischmann said. 

Sexual satisfaction and religious upbringing are correlated "more 
positively than negatively," according to a new poll of "predominantly 
(85%) Protestant, conservative, married men who describe themselves as 
religious." Researcher Archibald Hart, dean of the School of Psychology 
at Fuller Seminary, indicated in his new book, The Sexual Man (Word), 
that 81% of respondents were clergy. 
...Of those with "excellent" sex lives, 31% said they were raised in a 
strongly Christian home, while 20% had no religious upbringing. Those 
who said their sex life was not good were more likely to come from 
nonreligious homes. More than 80% of respondents said their faith 
increased their respect for women and their understanding of the role 
of sex in life; fewer than 1% said their religion distorted sexuality. 
...The poll also found problems. About 75% said their youthful sexual 
education was inadequate. A sense of guilt about sex was "regrettably 
disproportionate [among those] who grew up in religious homes," Hart 
said. "Inducing guilt without adequate instruction [about sex 
and]...how to be self-forgiving will create an obsessivecompulsive 
sexuality," he added. Some 65% said pornography was destructive to 
their sexual development. Respondents typically were introduced to 
pornography at age 15, and between 6% and 10% said they still were 
addicted to it. 
...Sexual arousal at work? Just under 60% reported it, and 53% cited 
women's "provocative dress" as the most common culprit. Nearly onethird 
acknowledged that on-the-job sexual arousal interfered with their 
duties. While 28% of respondents admitted to flirting and 29% to 
"overfriendliness" with female colleagues, nearly 20% said they had 
received "an overt or subtle sexual advance" from a woman at work. 
...To make the workplace safer for both sexes, Hart advises bosses not 
to harbor employees who cannot contain their sexual interests, to 
include spouses in staff events, to enforce appropriate dress 
standards, and to educate staff on laws concerning harassment, the 
hazards of workplace sex, and AIDS. 

Religion is losing its influence on society, 69% of Americans (up from 
56% in 1974) said in a Gallup/USA Today/CNN survey. Of those surveyed, 
59% said religion is "very important" in their lives and 29% said it is 
"fairly important." Other findings: 64% say religion can answer all or 
most of today's problems; 70% belong to a church or synagogue; and 66% 
attend religious services at least once a month (35% weekly). Asked 
"Would you describe yourself as a born-again or evangelical 
Christian?", 45% of respondents replied yes (compared with 41% in 
1991). The results are similar to those of other recent major polls 
(NIRR 4/4). 

Giving to Protestant churches declined 3.12% in 1992 to $16.6 billion, 
according to the 1994 Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches. Most 
of the 44 denominations that reported figures saw either decreases or 
only small increases in contributions. Even the Presbyterian Church 
(U.S.A), which experienced a 13% increase in giving in 1991, saw 
donations fall by 2.7%. 
...Two churches saw large gains. The Brethren in Christ experienced a 
rise in contributions of 15.4%, to $19.2 million, despite a 4.3% 
membership drop. The conservative Congregational Christian Conference 
saw a 23.7% increase in its contributions, to $27.3 million, with an 
8.4% rise in its membership. 

Attendance is dwindling at British institutional churches -- Anglican, 
Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, and Methodist. The Christian Research 
Association, which publishes the United Kingdom Christian Handbook, 
reports that century-old Pentecostal groups are growing the fastest. 
Surpassing even the independent, charismatic churches' growth, 
Pentecostal churches have grown by 65,000 members since 1975 to 170,000 
today. Anglican and Catholic churches both lost about 500,000 members 
during the same period. 

No women priests in Wales: the country's Anglican Church failed to 
approve female ordination. Lay members of the governing body voted to 
accept the measure, but it fell short of the two-thirds majority needed 
among clergy members. The church's five bishops, who voted last year to 
accept women priests, said they will call for another vote next year. 

About 30,000 Australians "reclaimed Easter" in 400 cities and towns by 
participating in public marches and celebrations. According to 
organizers, 12,000 marched from four gathering points toward the Sydney 
Town Hall, forming a great human cross. In Adelaide, 3,000 Christians 
did the same. 
...Fun fairs, free to the public, drew 400,000 across the country. In 
Brisbane, where both Anglican and Catholic archbishops participated in 
prayer and Bible reading, 80,000 attended, national coordinator Mal 
Garvin said. More than 12,000 in the city attended an Easter drama over 
five days of Holy Week. 
...First-time participation rose this year, according to Garvin. His 
ministry, Fusion, organized a threepart "Awakening '94" program for 
Australian churches. From Perth to Tasmania, many Christians 
participated for the first time in "Easter '94." They also launched 
phase two, "Operation Reconnect," a 12-week effort to link spouses, 
families, and communities with churches. Phase three will be the Global 
March for Jesus June 25 (NIRR 6/14/93). Garvin said 700 churches 
already have registered. 

Chinese churches in Canada have doubled in size in a decade. Of the 230 
congregations, 104 are in Toronto, according to the National Task Force 
on Evangelism. Churches reach out to second-generation Chinese. They 
target the 44 softball teams among Chinese youth in the Ontario 
capital. Also, Chinese churches have scheduled citywide evangelism 
crusades by Chinese churches for eight metropolitan centers this fall, 
according to the Chinese Coordination Centre for World Evangelism. 

Jim Bakker will preach a different message after he gets out of federal 
prison in Jesup, Ga., this September (NIRR 11/29/93), according to his 
lawyer, James Toms. "It won't be a right-wing, Republican commitment," 
Toms told The Charlotte Observer. "There will be a strong core of 
calling for justice and equity as part of the gospel. You'll see a 
Bible-believing liberal Democrat." Toms told NIRR that the PTL founder 
is "a man of considerable intellect" who has a "very strong compassion 
for the poor and for those in prison, which is entirely consistent with 
a literal acceptance of the gospel." Bakker, who once was known for 
focusing on prosperity theology, gained an "even stronger conviction 
about obeying God's Word" during his incarceration and study of 
Scripture, Toms said. 
...Bakker got a one-day furlough to visit his ailing father. He also 
walked through New Heritage USA and visited the remains of his 
burneddown house in Tega Cay, S.C. "I don't know where I will be called 
to serve God, but I do believe I have a message to share," Bakker said. 
He will spend his first 90 days of freedom in a halfway house near 
Asheville, N.C., before moving to a stillundetermined location. Bakker 
said he wants nothing to do with the life that led to his rise and 
downfall. 

Priestless parishes are growing in number. Between 1970 and 1993, the 
number of priests in the United States dropped from 58,000 to 51,000. 
Potential replacements also are sparse, with the number of students in 
diocesan or Catholic seminaries declining from 29,000 to 6,000. Because 
of the priest shortage, 10% of U.S. Catholic parishes, about 2,000, 
have no resident pastor. In 71 dioceses, parishes are administered by 
someone other than a priest. 
...A possible solution for the Chicago Archdiocese is the "parish 
coordinator" plan. Coordinators would counsel parishioners, direct 
finances, and perform other pastoral duties except administering the 
sacraments. Nuns and laity would lead some Chicago parishes. Among 
candidates for the position would be religious sisters and parish 
laywomen already serving in various capacities, the National Catholic 
Register reported. Under the parish coordinator plan, priests still 
would be available to say Mass and perform other sacramental duties. 
...Enrollment at U.S. Catholic schools edged upward by 9,000 pupils 
last year, with 25% of the increase in California, church officials 
announced at the annual meeting of the National Catholic Educational 
Association in Anaheim. The association represents more than 200,000 
educators serving 7.6 million students. 

Second-career ministers are moving from pew to pulpit, and church 
experts say they are welcome because of the clergy crunch. So many Baby 
Boomers are entering seminaries that they have pushed the average 
student age into the mid-30s or higher in many denominational schools, 
according to USA Today. 
...Tenure, seniority, and finances are common sacrifices for 
secondcareerists. Many were accustomed to service roles as teachers, 
social workers, and stay-at-home moms before seminary, but lawyers, 
doctors, business owners, athletes, engineers, and retired military 
officers are changing careers as well. 
...Second-careerists often bring life-and-work experiences and 
problem-solving skills uncommon to other pastors. But these 
accomplished, mature professionals quickly discover humility. It is 
naive to think that "you can just whiz in there as a marketing expert, 
a sales manager, with a plan to change the whole situation," said 
Robert Hicks, who traded 27 years in the business world to enter a 
Presbyterian seminary. 

Leaving Lutheranism: prominent scholar Robert Wilken plans to join the 
Roman Catholic Church. The professor of religion at the University of 
Virginia will be received into the Church in a ceremony in July. Wilken 
said he has devoted his life to "bring Lutheranism closer to the main 
trunk of western catholicism," but that in the last 10-15 years the 
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America has been moving the other way. 
"There is no sense any longer of a common tradition that everybody in 
the church is somehow beholden to," he told NIRR. Wilken, who is also a 
writer and consultant for First Things magazine, said his decision was 
personal, not political. Roman Catholicism has a "seriousness about the 
spiritual life and prayer that is not found in Lutheranism," he said. 
...The theological elite are drifting away from the Lutheran Church, 
Robert Benne of Roanoke College told NIRR. Benne is head of the 
religion and philosophy department at the ELCA school in Salem, Va. 
Racial, gender, and clergy-to-laity quotas for church policy-making 
bodies are the main factors that push academics "over the edge," he 
said. Quotas are "powerful signs that [the ELCA] no longer takes 
theology seriously," he told NIRR. "What is it that holds together the 
apostolic faith to make sure it is transmitted, taught and preached" 
faithfully to future generations, Benne asked. To some academics, the 
"most plausible leader is the bishop of Rome," he said. 

The landmark document Evangelicals and Catholics Together (NIRR 4/4), 
which outlines areas of political and theological agreement between 
prominent leaders of the two camps, has evoked mixed and sometimes 
guarded reactions. While many evangelicals favor maintaining a working 
political relationship with Catholics, some fear the document distorts 
the historical distinctiveness of evangelical Protestantism. 
..."In the Dark Ages into which we are entering," Christians who 
"believe in moral absolutes need to stand very close to each other," 
said David Wells of Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. Yet, Wells 
told NIRR, he is unhappy about the document's "blurring" of some 
theological questions. Catholics and evangelicals can affirm the 
document's statement that Christians are saved by grace through faith, 
"but they will mean different things by it," he said. That is why 
Protestant reformers inserted the word only in that phrase, he said. It 
is "essential to the preservation of the reformist point of view." 
...Sheep-stealing is condemned, but the right to preach the gospel is 
upheld in the document, said John White, president of Geneva College in 
Beaver Falls, Pa., and an original signer. "There have been times we've 
evangelized Roman Catholics because they are Roman Catholics," he told 
NIRR. "We need to be evangelizing people from all denominations who do 
not have a relationship with Jesus." The document will allow Catholics 
and evangelicals to be "vigorous cobelligerents on cultural issues in 
their communities," he said. 

Between 10 and 20 states are refusing to pay for abortions for poor 
women who are victims of rape or incest. In December, the Clinton 
administration ordered states to finance Medicaid abortions, set March 
31 as the deadline to comply, and threatened to cut off billions in 
funding if they did not. The order was based on an interpretation of a 
change in the Hyde Amendment to allow Medicaid coverage of such 
abortions. Many officials say state laws that forbid paying for the 
abortions are not superseded by the federal order. Planned Parenthood 
filed suit to force Michigan to comply. A 1988 voter initiative there 
banned abortions for the poor except to save the life of the woman. 

The Vatican is at odds with President Bill Clinton over a United 
Nations plan to limit world population growth. The U.N. proposal deals 
with issues such as contraception and abortion in "an ethical vacuum," 
a papal representative complained. Under the plan, to be acted upon at 
an international conference on population in Cairo in September, all 
countries are to guarantee access to family planning for everyone, 
including adolescents, by the year 2015. A main goal is to slow growth 
enough so that the world's present population of 5.5 billion will 
increase to only 7.27 billion, instead of a projected 10 billion, by 
2015. Among other things, the plan approves abortion in cases of rape 
and incest. For months, the U.S. administration has vigorously lobbied 
for broader abortion language. 

A gay professor's charges that a Catholic student harassed him were 
unfounded, officials at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh 
decided. Nevertheless, they placed Patrick Mooney, 21, on "disciplinary 
probation" until his graduation next month. Mooney removed a poster 
from a school wall. The ACT-UP ad featured a picture of New York 
Cardinal John O'Connor next to a condom. It read "Stop the Church" and 
"Know Your Scumbag." Officials said Mooney's action violated both the 
school's poster policy and the free-speech rights of the campus 
homosexual organization that hung the poster. Homosexual activists on 
campus called for Mooney's expulsion. 
...Drama professor Tim Saternow charged the student with "harassment on 
the basis of sexual orientation." Earlier last month they had discussed 
the poster, but Mooney told reporters that he did not know Saternow was 
gay, and that he was only trying to defend his religious beliefs from 
attack. Officials clamped a gag order on Mooney as another part of the 
disciplinary action. Mooney's lawyer noted that violation of the poster 
policy calls for a fine of $10, but said he will appeal. He alleges the 
poster itself violated school policy because it did not include the 
name of its sponsoring organization, and it was "deeply offensive" to 
the religious beliefs of Catholic students. 

The Boy Scouts can bar gays as scout leaders, California's Second 
District Court of Appeals ruled in a 21 decision. Noting that the 
Scouts' moral code disapproved of homosexuality, the court said that 
"the imposition of a leader who is an improper role model is a severe 
intrusion upon the First Amendment activities of an expressive 
association" such as the Boy Scouts of America. The court also said the 
BSA group is a private membership organization, not a business. It is 
therefore exempt from the state's civil rights act, which forbids 
discrimination by businesses. Even if the Scouts were a business, it 
said, the constitutional right of freedom of association would override 
the state's interest in outlawing discrimination based on sexual 
orientation. In February, the Fourth District Court of Appeals had 
ruled that the BSA was a business, and therefore could not bar atheists 
as members (NIRR 3/21). atheists as members (NIRR 3/21).

A group of 40 prominent evangelical and Catholic scholars and leaders 
has agreed that Christians must stop aggressive proselytizing of one 
another's flocks and work together more closely to "contend against all 
that opposes Christ and His cause." 
...Many see Evangelicals and Catholics Together: The Christian Mission 
in the Third Millennium as a historic effort to transform contentions 
over theological differences into cooperation based on common faith in 
Christ. "We dare not by needless and loveless conflict between 
ourselves give aid and comfort to the enemies of the cause of Christ," 
the statement, signed March 29 in New York, says. Not since the 16th 
century have Protestants and Catholics "joined in a declaration so 
clear in respect to their common faith and common responsibility," said 
Richard John Neuhaus, a Catholic priest and head of the Institute on 
Religion and Public Life. 
...The two groups did not gloss over their theological differences on 
biblical interpretation, the meaning of sacraments and ordinances, 
veneration of Mary or saints, and baptism. The document does not 
represent an official stance of any denomination, although Neuhaus said 
he had received strong encouragement from "appropriate parties at the 
Holy See." 
...Although the document addresses the relationship between 
evangelicals and Catholics, it acknowledges that belief in "the one 
Christ and one mission includes many other Christians," most notably 
Eastern Orthodox and Protestants outside the evangelical camp. What 
brought the two communities together to this point, some signers said, 
are the experiences of worshiping together in the charismatic movement 
and working together for political causes, such as the pro-life 
movement. Evangelical Protestants "have much more in common with 
Bible-believing Catholics" than with liberal Protestants, Prison 
Fellowship's Charles Colson said. 
...The Christian mission must include increased evangelism efforts to 
reach "resurgent spiritualities and religions that are explicitly 
hostile to the claims of the Christ," such as Islam, the statement 
said. The declaration, Neuhaus said, is not the basis for a partisan 
conservative agenda or meant to "align with one particular party or 
another." But other areas where the two groups can work together are: 
fighting for religious freedom; taking responsibility for the "right 
ordering of civil society" without falling prey to the idea that "it is 
within our power to build the Kingdom of God on earth"; protecting 
human life, especially the "most vulnerable," including the unborn; 
promoting parental choice in education; battling pornography and 
"anti-religious bigotry in entertainment media"; upholding free-market 
economics; and renewing appreciation for Western culture. 
...The drafting committee consisted of Colson, Neuhaus, Eastern 
Nazarene College's Kent Hill, and George Weigel of the Ethics and 
Public Policy Center. Others involved with development since the 
project's inception two years ago include Fordham University's Avery 
Dulles, Southern Baptist Convention officials Richard Land and Larry 
Lewis, and Catholic archbishops William Murphy of Boston and Francis 
Stafford of Denver. Public endorsers include Bill Bright, J.I. Packer, 
Michael Novak, Pat Robertson, Os Guiness, New York's Cardinal John 
O'Connor, and others. 
..."I'm putting the storm windows and doors on," said Colson, whose 
praise of Mother Teresa put him in disfavor with some evangelicals. 
Although some conservative Protestants condemn any ties with Catholics, 
he said, people in the pews are ready to embrace Catholics as partners 
in faith. "More people are going to call up and say, `Praise the Lord 
you did this' than will be upset." 
...The statement is "further alarming evidence" that "the ecumenical 
church, which will be the church of the Antichrist, is rapidly 
forming," according to Bob Jones, III, a leading fundamentalist and 
president of Bob Jones University. Jones told NIRR that just because 
some Catholics and Protestants stand united against social ills "does 
not mean that we share a common Faith," because Catholicism "opposes 
Christ and His cause." 

"Fundamentalism actually invites people to a kind of intellectual 
suicide," the Vatican said in warning its faithful against interpreting 
the Bible too literally. "The fundamentalist approach is dangerous, for 
it is attractive to people who look to the Bible for ready answers to 
the problems of life," the Pontifical Biblical Commission said in a 
125-page document, The Interpretation of the Bible in the Church. It 
suggests that when people do not find obvious answers in Scripture, 
they are more prone to abandon their faith completely. The document 
defends the historical-critical method of interpretation championed by 
theological liberals. It acknowledged that a conservative approach to 
Scripture is gaining more and more adherents, both in the Catholic 
Church and in other denominations. 

"The most significant prayer movement in the world" continues to unfold 
in New York City, said David Bryant of Concerts of Prayer. The movement 
began seven years ago at a mass rally at First Baptist Church in 
Flushing, Queens. Weekend prayer rallies are held in 10 regions of the 
city, along with pastors' prayer summits and concerts, and "pace-setter 
retreats" for those who mobilize prayer in their churches. 
...Prayer is rejuvenating the New York church, Bryant said. He 
theorized that without the unity and dynamism created by local prayer, 
Billy Graham's three metro New York crusades in the last five years 
might not have taken place. 
...U.S. prayer movements must harmonize their visions, Bryant said. As 
an example, he cited a two-hour, May 5 prayer meeting for revival at 
Chicago's Moody Memorial Church. Scheduled on the National Day of 
Prayer, the service will be televised on religious networks. Although 
pastors' and citywide prayer summits, Marches for Jesus, special days 
of prayer, and spiritual warfare have proliferated, Bryant told NIRR 
that prayer leaders should "articulate, biblically, what spiritual 
awakening looks like" so they are aiming toward the same goals. "Such a 
consensus has been a crucial element to revival." 

Sports drew men into a New Orleans church and started a revival there. 
When men were scarce at inner-city Franklin Avenue Baptist Church 
several years ago, pastor Fred Luter announced that any man could come 
to his home to watch a professional boxing match on closed-circuit TV. 
Ten of those men came to church the next morning. 
..."That was enough, because men draw other men," Luter said last month 
during Black Pastor Appreciation Day at Southeastern Seminary in Wake 
Forest, N.C. He told Baptist Press his congregation grew from 63 
members in 1986 to 1,800 people today. The church has a 50-voice male 
chorus, and an active men's fellowship and missions group, which 
started an addiction-recovery program. 
...Luter still uses sporting events to draw men and youth, and offers 
programs promoting families. "Our church women are doing their part. 
Now we've got to keep raising men where they ought to be -- and that's 
in the Lord's church, serving Him." 

Most of World Vision's domestic relief operations will move from Los 
Angeles to Seattle by September 1995. High medical insurance premiums, 
salaries, and costly government regulations prompted the move, WV 
President Robert Seiple told Religious News Service. The move is 
expected to save the organization $5 million a year. World Vision's 
domestic relief operation has 525 employees, but the agency plans to 
operate with a staff of 400 in Seattle. It will freeze salaries for two 
years to bring wages in line with that area's cost of living, officials 
said. 
...World Vision International's 152 employees will remain in Monrovia, 
Calif. WV's research center, MARC, will stay to work with the School of 
Missions at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, as will an office 
that will continue serving Los Angeles' relief needs. 

The combined 1993 income of 45 of Colorado Springs' 70 religious 
organizations approached $400 million, according to a survey conducted 
by Steve Rabey, religion editor of the Gazette Telegraph newspaper. 
Focus on the Family led with income of $88,196,402, followed by the 
Navigators and NavPress with $78,000,000, Compassion International with 
more than $54,000,000, Young Life with $50,285,054, and the Christian 
and Missionary Alliance with $32,900,000. Each figure was up $3-$10 
million from 1992 revenues. Respondents also had a combined local 
annual payroll of $55,072,685. 
...Non-profits are attracted to Colorado Springs' mild climate, natural 
beauty, and low operating costs, Alice Worrell, executive vice 
president of Greater Colorado Springs Economic Development Corp., told 
NIRR. World by 2000, the Dave Dravecky Foundation, Master Books, 
Christian Camping International/USA, and Friendship International 
Ministries joined the community in 1993. This year, the 
California-based Association of Christian Schools International, the 
Chicago-area Greater European Mission, and David C. Cook Publishing 
also will relocate to the city, Worrell said. 

Non-profit organizations may be required to send copies of their annual 
tax returns to anyone who requests them. The proposed reforms are aimed 
at curbing excesses by executives of charities. Non-profits already 
must have their Form 990s available for inspection at their offices, 
but need not provide copies. The forms contain details of income and 
expenses, salaries of top officers, and other information. Maximum 
penalties for filing late or inaccurate reports would be increased from 
$5,000 to $50,000. Other proposals presented by the Treasury Department 
to a House Ways and Means subcommittee call for a 25% excise tax on 
excessive salaries and benefits paid to executives, repayment of those 
monies to the charity, and an excise tax of 10%, up to a maximum of 
$10,000, levied against board members and officers who approve the 
excesses. 

Two high-ranking members of the National Council of Churches staff have 
been suspended pending an investigation. More than $8 million in 
council funds appears to have been lost in illegal and unsound 
investments. Without proper authorization, Emilio Carrillo, director of 
the NCC's Office of Human Resources, placed the funds with Libra Ltd., 
a small investment firm in Reston, Va., Religious News Service 
reported. Robert Soong, his supervisor and the council finance officer, 
knew about the investment but failed to challenge it, according to J. 
Martin Bailey, the council's communications director. 
...The invested money was used to purchase securities issued by Banka 
Bohemia. The money was intended to help small companies in the former 
Czechoslovakia convert from a statedominated economy to private 
enterprise. The project got out of hand when unidentified partners 
allegedly traded photocopies or forgeries of the notes, RNS said. 
...The $8 million is a substantial part of the NCC fund that pays 
health insurance premiums for retired staff, RNS said. Officials in the 
NCC, which was in financial straits before loss of the funds, say they 
remain hopeful the money can be recovered. The NCC has filed an 
injunction in a London court to freeze the assets of Keetley 
Investments Ltd., a firm connected to the case. NCC General Secretary 
Joan Brown Campbell assured her staff that salaries and health 
insurance premiums will be paid, and that no pension money is involved. 

Few of the 10 largest U.S. denominations reported membership increases 
or drops of more than 1%, according to The Yearbook of American and 
Canadian Churches 1994. 
...The statistics are based on reports for 1992, said editor Kenneth 
Bedell of the National Council of Churches, which publishes the 
yearbook. Percentages reflect differences from 1991: Roman Catholic 
Church, 59.22 million (+1.63%); Southern Baptist Convention, 15.35 
million (+.83%); United Methodist Church, 8.72 million (-.71%); 
National Baptist Convention USA, 8.2 million (+2.5%); Evangelical 
Lutheran Church in America, 5.23 million (-.2%); Presbyterian Church 
(U.S.A.), 3.75 million (-.53%); Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, 2.6 
million (+.09%). The Episcopal Church reported 2.49 million members, a 
gain of 20,000. Several large black denominations reported no change 
from previous figures, but analysts blamed lax record-keeping and 
reporting, adding that other studies showed growth. 

A California-based ministry is offering Europeans alternatives to 
traditional church models. Linus Morris' Christian Associates 
International in Thousand Oaks is planting what he calls high-impact 
churches in Europe, and also offering existing church leaders training 
in their approach. 
..."Europe is not post-Christian, as many say, but pre-Christian," 
Morris told Pulse. He sees little evidence that the present generation 
of European urbanites has heard enough of the gospel to reject it. 
...CAI emphasizes advance demographic study, relational evangelism, a 
mobilized laity, cell groups, and evangelistic social events for 
believers and non-believers. Morris told NIRR that for those who are 
open to such changes CAI has held seven conferences for church leaders 
in four cities. 
...Their goal is to plant Englishspeaking, international churches in 20 
European cities. These, in turn, would launch 20 national-language 
churches. In the 1980s, Morris helped start an evangelical congregation 
in Amsterdam that now has a 50-member Dutch offshoot. Similar groups 
have been formed in Geneva, Barcelona, Stockholm, Dublin, and Zurich. 
Other CAI church-planting teams work in Paris, Budapest, Riga, and 
Moscow. Teams also are scheduled to go to Dublin, Berlin, and Vienna. 

About 140,000 Albanian soldiers have been evangelized by Albanian 
Christians in the past year, according to a Holland-based ministry 
called The Bridge. A network of churches, led by Tirana's Bashkesia 
Relindja ("Church Reborn"), has held gospel concerts at 12 army bases 
at the request of the minister of defense. Soldiers heard a 
presentation of the gospel and received an Albanian New Testament, The 
Bridge's U.S. director, Ragnhild Ulrich, told NIRR. One-third of the 
soldiers expressed interest in further meetings. The minister of the 
interior has requested similar programs for police academies. 
...Igballe Rugova leads the Church Reborn, which ministers to the 
capital city's upper class. Rugova, an ethnic Albanian and a Muslim who 
became a Christian in 1985, gained notoriety in the late 1980s as a 
broadcast personality on Yugoslavian television, Ulrich said. When she 
returned to her Albanian homeland in 1991, Rugova found she had easy 
access to cultural and government leaders. Her church is attended by 
about half of the national choir and two Cabinet members. 
...Church Reborn also planted a "youth church" by hosting a Christian 
rock concert. Two weeks after the evangelistic event featuring 
Christian artist Darrell Mansfield, 500 young people were meeting 
weekly for worship and Bible study. They call their church The Rock. 

In a $1.2 million age-discrimination suit, a judge ruled against the 
Catholic Archdiocese of St. Paul-Minneapolis. The case involved a 1991 
education office reorganization in which nine women, ranging in age 
from 48 to 68, were dismissed. Church officials said the move was aimed 
at improving efficiency. But Judge Joanne Smith last month ruled that 
the reorganization actually was carried out with the intention of 
terminating the women and replacing them with women 35 and under, in 
violation of Minnesota's Human Rights Act. Archdiocesan officials said 
they will appeal. 

A jury in Minneapolis delivered a $14.2 million wrongful-death verdict 
against the Christian Science church and five members (NIRR 9/6/93). 
The judge, however, reduced the actual damages portion of the verdict 
from $5.2 million to $1.5 million. The suit was filed by Douglass 
Lundman after his 11-year-old son died. Ian's mother, a member of the 
church, had declined to seek medical treatment for him. It was the 
first civil wrongful death case against the church to go to trial, 
church sources said. 

A city council member withdrew a proposal that would have restricted 
church activities in New Haven, Conn. Alderman Sandra Astarita said her 
plan would have made churches "better neighbors" by requiring them to 
increase parking, limit church-sponsored events, restrict noise from 
bells and chimes, and regulate rental of church buildings to outside 
groups. She withdrew the proposal following a packed public hearing 
where many residents complained it was unconstitutional because it 
would entangle government in religious affairs. 

A federal judge dismissed a $60 million lawsuit by TV preacher Robert 
Tilton and his Dallas church (NIRR 1/24) against ABC News, PrimeTime 
Live journalist Diane Sawyer, WFAA-TV of Dallas, the Dallas Morning 
News, and the Trinity Foundation, a religious watchdog group in Dallas. 
Tilton had accused them of conspiring to deprive him and members of his 
Faith Word Outreach Center of their civil rights. He claimed that 
negative publicity had cost the church millions of dollars, forcing him 
to cancel his TV shows. 

Theology professor Graydon Snyder, 63, is suing Chicago Seminary and 
its sexual harassment task force for unspecified damages. In 1992, a 
female student complained to the task force that Snyder had used an 
inappropriate story from the Talmud in an introductory Bible class. 
Snyder, who has taught at the United Church of Christ-related school 
for eight years, said he used the story as an example of differences in 
the way people are judged in the eyes of God. The narrative, which 
Snyder has used for 34 years, is about a roofer who fell on a woman and 
then had sex with her. "The New Testament says [that] if you think 
about doing the act, you've done it, [while] the Talmud says if you do 
the act, but didn't think about it, you didn't do it," Snyder said. 
...After the complaint, Snyder was summoned to two harassment hearings. 
Afterward, he wrote a letter of apology to the student, but admitted no 
wrongdoing. The panel placed him on probation, and circulated letters 
to the school's 250 students and faculty explaining why he had been 
punished. Snyder was ordered to undergo therapy, and advised not to be 
alone with students or staff members. Snyder no longer teaches the 
seminary's Introduction to the Bible course. He said his suit will help 
establish boundaries of academic freedom. 

Pat Robertson has accused eight of the 14 professors at Regent 
University's Law School of acting like cultists. The comparison was 
made in a Feb. 22 letter circulated among Regent's faculty, according 
to Religious News Service. "No rational professional person seeks to 
destroy the source of his own employment and career advancement," 
Robertson wrote. "Only cultists of the order of Jim Jones or the Branch 
Davidians do such things." 
...The letter is the latest salvo in a dispute between Robertson, 
chancellor of the university, and Herbert Titus, the former law school 
dean (NIRR 7/26/93). The eight professors filed a complaint with the 
American Bar Association about the inappropriateness of Titus' 
dismissal and its threat to Regent's academic freedom. The professors 
also reiterated Titus' claim that Robertson, a former presidential 
hopeful and head of the Christian Broadcasting Network, is trying to 
moderate the school's image to boost his political agenda -- a charge 
Robertson denies (NIRR 2/7). Robertson's letter came as an ABA 
factfinding team conducted a review to determine if the school should 
receive full accreditation. In most states, graduation from an 
ABA-accredited school is a prerequisite to the bar exam. 

An arrogant and isolationist management style, insubordination, and 
serious "doctrinal and policy differences" caused the firing of 
Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary President Russell Dilday 
(NIRR 3/21), trustees said in a March 21 statement. They also said 
Dilday debated the "right of the Southern Baptist Convention to revise 
its overall direction," and that his refusal of a $400,000 retirement 
offer caused public "embarrassment and potential permanent injury to 
the seminary." 
..."Words can't adequately express my shock" at the accusations, Dilday 
told reporters. He insisted that he was collegial, never disobeyed 
board policies, and tried to negotiate compromises between seminary 
moderates and conservatives. Dilday said the trustees apparently "acted 
precipitously," and then "scratched around to find reasons for their 
action." 
...Students, faculty members, key financial backers, and fund-raisers 
of the Fort Worth, Texas, school continue to protest the firing. 
Associated Baptist Press reported that the firing had cost the seminary 
at least $15 million in gifts and pledges. The Association of 
Theological Schools, one of two groups that accredits the seminary, 
censured the school, stating that its action was a violation of 
accepted practices, and "places in jeopardy the vitality and basic 
integrity of the institution," ABP reported. 

The Vista (Calif.) School Board adopted a sex-education program that 
teaches students abstinence only. The 3-2 vote capped hours of stormy 
debate over the curriculum, known as Sex Respect (NIRR Special 
Supplement 11/1/93). Critics, led by Planned Parenthood, contended it 
is ethnicand gender-biased, inaccurate, ineffective, and promotes a 
religious viewpoint. Supporters argued that it is the only viable 
message to help teen-agers avoid pregnancy and sexually transmitted 
diseases. Board President John Tyndall was quoted as disputing the 
religious-viewpoint allegation. "Which religion does it promote? All 
the major religions, I think, hold up the ideal of a monogamous, 
heterosexual relationship as a value worth attainment," he said. A 
court challenge is expected. The board's conservative Christian 
members, who comprise the majority, recently survived an attempt to 
have them recalled after a widely publicized debate over scientific 
creationism (NIRR 11/1/93). 

Plagued by violence in its public schools, the District of Columbia 
City Council approved a bill that would permit student-led, 
non-sectarian, nonproselytizing prayer in the city's school system. It 
was introduced by council member Marion Barry, the former D.C. mayor 
who spent six months in jail after being caught in a drug sting. He 
said his life has been turned around by his prison experience and 
prayer. "I am an example of how it works: anybody who has come from the 
depths to [where] I have risen has to be a miracle," he said. 

Religious faith is more important to Americans than many might guess. 
An early March poll for U.S. News & World Report's April 11 issue found 
that 93% say they believe in God or a universal spirit. Of those 
polled, 65% believe that religion is losing its influence on American 
life, although 62% say religion is increasing its influence in their 
personal lives. 
...Other findings: 80% of Americans (including 71% of college 
graduates) say the Bible is either the actual word of God to be taken 
literally (34%), or is the inspired word of God, although not 
everything in it can be taken word for word (46%); 77% attest to having 
been guided by God in making important decisions; 76% believe God is a 
heavenly father who can be reached by prayers; 51% describe themselves 
as having traditional moral values and accept God's authority as 
recorded in the Bible; 46% describe themselves as born-again, defined 
as a turning point "in your life when you committed yourself to Jesus 
Christ" (26% say their conversion was sudden or a combination of sudden 
and gradual aspects); and 60% say they attend church or synagogue 
regularly, and half of them attend weekly. 
...Respondents were asked to agree or disagree with a list of 
statements: "We have to keep church and state completely separate" (53% 
agree, 42% disagree); "There is no one set of values that is right" 
(48%, 44%); "Each individual must determine what is right or wrong" 
(70%, 25%); "The president should be a moral and spiritual leader" 
(78%, 17%); "Our government would be better if policies were more 
directed by moral values" (84%, 9%); "Individual freedom is critical to 
democracy in this country" (91%, 4%); and "God is the moral guiding 
force of American democracy" (55%, 35%). 

President Bill Clinton says he is "an honest, struggling believer, 
trying to grow every day." He told ABC's World News Tonight he could 
not do his job as president or grow as a person if he did not have 
faith in God. Clinton said his faith provides him with "a solace and a 
support in the face of all these problems I sometimes am not smart 
enough to solve." 
...Clinton, a Southern Baptist, made clear his differences with many 
evangelical Christians. To those who oppose abortion rights, he said he 
does "not believe it is self-evident from the Bible that all abortions 
are murder." Clinton also said the stricture against homosexuality did 
not make it into the Ten Commandments, "but thou shalt not bear false 
witness did." It is not right to say Christianity, faith, or character 
"should be evaluated totally on the basis of these two issues," he 
said. 
...The format of the network TV interview reduced Clinton's sharing of 
his faith to sound bites that did not delve enough to clarify his 
beliefs, said Marvin Olasky, journalism professor at the University of 
Texas at Austin. Clinton is a "post-modern president," and "everything, 
including his religious faith, is subjective," Olasky said. 

The Jesus Seminar claims that four well-known stories in the New 
Testament are not accurate. The controversial organization of 
theologians, which votes on the authenticity of the words attributed to 
Jesus (NIRR 1/10), held its semiannual meeting last month in Santa 
Rosa, Calif. The scholars concluded that Jesus did have a last meal 
with his disciples, but it was not the Passover Seder. The story of a 
woman's anointing Jesus' feet and wiping them with her hair might be an 
embellishment of an incident in which a woman performs a gesture of 
hospitality for Jesus, the group said. The scholars also said Gospel 
versions of the feeding of the masses with a few loaves and fishes are 
untrue. Stories about Judas' betrayal are "Christian fictions" that 
early Christians made up to symbolize all Jews who rejected Jesus, the 
group said. 

Christian bookstores are being bombarded with requests for Embraced by 
the Light. The book recounts former hypnotherapist Betty Eadie's 1973 
experience, when, after undergoing a hysterectomy, she allegedly died 
and returned to life five hours later with the secrets of Jesus. 
Embraced is on several best-seller lists, and has been discussed widely 
on talk shows. 
...The book mixes truth with heresy, Bookstore Journal's associate 
editor Linda Vixie said. But when Christian retailers tell customers 
they don't stock the book, "people get furious at them," Vixie told 
NIRR. 
...Author Eadie is a Mormon, according to Christian retailer Daryl 
Westfall. He began investigating the book after his Berean Bookstore in 
Phoenix received more than 80 requests for it. The book describes Jesus 
as "a god," claims that all religions are necessary, and recounts 
Eadie's trip with spiritual "escorts" who showed her other-worldly 
truths. 

Renewal leaders in many of the largest U.S. and Canadian mainline 
denominations expressed "profound concern" over RE-Imagining, last 
November's controversial ecumenical women's conference (NIRR 4/21). 
They denounced the meeting, saying it was a "trampling underfoot" of 
the gospel and an "attempt to reconstruct Christian faith." At a March 
14-15 meeting in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, they called participants 
and their supporting denominations to "renounce idolatrous worship, 
false teachings, and syncretism," and to "reaffirm their faith in God 
the Holy Trinity." 
...United Methodist women remain faithful to the church, officers of 
the Women's Division of the UMC's Board of Global Ministries said. The 
division "has not engaged in goddess worship and will not do so," and 
"believes in the Triune God incarnate in Jesus Christ," its 
administrative committee said. Membership in ecumenical groups and 
attendance at their events does not indicate "an uncritical acceptance 
of agenda or positions," the women's statement said. 

Pro-life and pro-choice advocates who are willing to risk disapproval 
from their peers are working together on issues of shared concern. 
Local chapters of the Common Ground Network for Life and Choice have 
formed in Buffalo, Washington, Milwaukee, Cleveland, San Francisco, and 
Denver. The network is an offshoot of the Washington-based Search for 
Common Ground, a non-profit that helps international adversaries deal 
constructively with conflict. Local meetings are confidential to avoid 
public criticism. 
...One aim is to foster dialogue, Mary Jacksteit, a Presbyterian 
laywoman who co-directs Common Ground, told NIRR. She and colleague 
Adrienne Kaufmann, a Benedictine nun, studied conflict-resolution at 
Northern Virginia's George Mason University. People want to talk to 
"the other side," and will do so when they realize they will be 
listened to rather than debated, Jacksteit said. 
...Dialogue sometimes evolves into working relationships, often on 
issues that affect women and children, such as child care, adoption, 
and prenatal care. In Missouri, pro-life attorney Andrew Puzder, who 
authored the state's abortion restrictions, worked with abortion 
provider B.J. IsaacsonJones, who heads one of the nation's largest 
reproductive-health clinics. Their joint efforts led to passage of a 
law to assist women addicted to crack cocaine. Abortion-related riders 
had stalled the bill in the legislature. 

Any health-care reforms adopted by Congress should include abortion 
services, according to the interfaith Religious Coalition for 
Reproductive Choice (formerly the Religious Coalition for Abortion 
Rights). Funding also should cover contraception, preand postnatal 
care, and voluntary sterilization, the RCRC said in a statement last 
month. The call was in direct opposition to the lobbying efforts of 
Catholic bishops and evangelical and conservative bodies opposed to 
abortion coverage, including the Southern Baptists' Christian Life 
Commission and Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition. The RCRC includes 
mainline Protestant denominations and agencies, Jewish groups, and 
organizations such as the American Humanist Association, the Unitarian 
Universalist Association, and the American Ethical Union. 

Rachelle "Shelley" Shannon may serve up to 13 years in prison. She was 
found guilty of attempted firstdegree murder in the shooting of 
abortion doctor George Tiller in Wichita, Kan., last August (NIRR 
9/6/93). Shannon also was found in contempt of court for refusing to 
name the intermediary who obtained the handgun she used to shoot the 
52year-old Tiller. Sentencing is April 29. Shannon, 37, the mother of 
two teen-age children, said during testimony that if her $1 million 
bond had been low enough, she would have tried to bomb Tiller's 
abortion clinic, which is one of a handful in the United States that 
performs abortions in the final trimester of pregnancy. 

"We believe that biblical faith is the solution to our ecological 
problems," says the Evangelical Declaration on the Care of Creation. 
The statement was issued by the Evangelical Environmental Network (NIRR 
10/18/93), a member of the interfaith Religious Partnership on the 
Environment. More than 100 key evangelicals endorsed the declaration, 
which describes signers as "followers of Jesus Christ, committed to the 
full authority of the Scriptures, and aware of the ways we have 
degraded creation." 

As a police helicopter buzzed overhead, Bishop Robert Fannin salvaged a 
robe and liturgical stoles from the ruins of Goshen United Methodist 
Church. The Piedmont, Ala., church was razed by one of about 30 
tornados that ripped across portions of five states on Palm Sunday. 
...Just before the tornado hit, the children at Goshen had been singing 
Jehovah Jireh, My Provider, based on the biblical account of Abraham's 
willingness to sacrifice his son to the Lord. Among the 90 injured and 
20 dead were two children, including pastor Kelly Clem's daughter 
Hannah. Clem told United Methodist News that she and her husband, Dale, 
were pained by the death, "but I'll never regret these four wonderful 
years with that child." UMC pastors of the Anniston District have 
lightened Clem's pastoral load, comforting individual families of the 
church and helping make funeral arrangements during the week. "We're in 
grief right now," Fannin said, "but we always build and go on." 
...The UMC's Committee on Relief immediately began collecting funds for 
storm victims, and Church World Services sent a disaster team to assess 
needs. The Salvation Army sent canteens to storm-damaged areas across 
the South, and provided food for more than 1,700 victims, firemen, 
policemen, and other relief workers. In north Georgia, where at least 
18 died as some 450 homes were destroyed, the Salvationists gave 
families up to $300 for food, medical prescriptions, and other needs. 
In the Charlotte, N.C., area, where at least two died and more than 300 
buildings were damaged, area Thrift Stores filled requests for food and 
clothing. 

Churches are having a harder time securing liability insurance. News 
reports attribute the phenomenon to recent years' court judgments in 
clergy sex abuse cases. In some of the cases, insurance companies 
themselves have gone to court to try to avoid having to pay hundreds of 
millions of dollars. Some companies are offering church liability 
policies that exclude child abuse and pastoral liability. Several 
insurance executives were quoted in news accounts as saying their 
companies do not want to cover churches any longer. 

Former pastor Richard Jones, 30, was sentenced to 189 years in prison 
for sexually assaulting two teen-age boys who were members of his 
Family Life Church in Flat River, Mo., which has since disbanded. 
Prosecutors said Jones must serve 28 years before being considered for 
parole. A jury found him guilty of 27 incidents during 1990 and 1991. 
The victims testified that Jones told them the acts he forced on them 
were sanctioned by the Bible. The pastor claimed that the boys were 
trying to get revenge for his confronting them about their alleged 
drinking and sexual activities. 

For the first time, the Immigration and Naturalization Service has 
granted asylum to a homosexual seeking refuge from alleged persecution 
based on sexual orientation. A Mexican using an alias, Jose Garcia, was 
awarded the status last month in California. In the past, INS rejected 
such arguments, and fought in court against two similar decisions by 
immigration judges in other cases. Garcia told reporters he had 
"suffered unspeakable degradations" at the hands of Mexican authorities 
"for the sole reason that I am gay." INS officials said there has been 
no policy change but that such requests will be handled on a 
case-bycase basis. 

Tuna fishermen aboard Chinese vessels in the Caribbean have proven to 
be a "missions gold mine," according to Southern Baptist missionaries 
James and Sheila Wang. The couple, who are residents of Santo Domingo, 
discovered in 1991 that every October and April dozens of Chinese tuna 
boats dock for a month at Philipsburg, capital of St. Maarten. Wang, 
the 65year-old pastor of Chinese Baptist Church, and his wife travel to 
the Dutch island to show the Jesus film and lead Bible discussions for 
the fishermen. About 60 of the seamen have accepted Christ, according 
to Baptist Press. 
...Around the coast at Cole Bay, pleasure yachtsmen are the "unreached 
people group" sought out by Baptist ministers Tom and Patti 
Higginbotham. By radio they welcome every yacht to the bay with a 
weather report and an offer for assistance. Later, Tom visits them in 
his outboard motorboat, called The Commission, distributing tourist 
information, a map of the island, a tract, a New Testament, and details 
about St. Maarten International Baptist Church. 

Christian Surfers Australia is working to link the beach with the 
church. The interdenominational group has moved from being just a 
fellowship to a mission organization, said its promotions officer, Rod 
Wilson. 
...CSA's 20 clubs conducted their 10th anniversary Jesus Pro-Am March 
12-13. The invitational competition of amateurs and professionals 
featured about 100 Christian and non-Christian surfers. They converged 
on the coast at Bendalong, 150 miles south of Sydney, to vie for $7,000 
in cash prizes. In addition to "catered food, unbiased judging, and 
positive commentating," the competition included low-key personal 
evangelism. Campsite meetings featured music and talks on the Christian 
faith, said CSA Secretary Brett Davis. 

An Eritrean church once seemingly doomed to extinction recently 
baptized 20 believers, and 30 more are attending a new converts' class. 
Until becoming a nation last year, Eritrea was part of northern 
Ethiopia. In the 1970s, Ethiopia's Marxist regime prohibited the Kale 
Heywet Church from training leaders, but allowed it to operate its 
orphanage. Today, leaders who were raised in that home are instructing 
and baptizing converts among the church's two congregations and three 
small fellowships, SIM International reported. Kale Heywet and other 
churches are growing and investing in relief, economic development, and 
gospel outreach ministry. 

Islam is growing rapidly in neighboring Ethiopia. Evangelical leaders 
there told News Network International that Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, 
Libya, Sudan, and Yemen are funding multimillion-dollar enterprises. 
Their mosque construction and relief efforts are seen as an attempt to 
draw Ethiopians to the faith. Evangelicals, too, have been accused of 
buying converts with relief and development aid, but Muslim efforts are 
more consistent. 
...Few Ethiopians of any faith support the agenda of militant Islamic 
fundamentalists, said Gabriel Galatic, a Food for the Hungry spokesman 
who is an Ethiopian Mennonite. Many Christians and Muslims have 
sympathy for each other because they shared in the hardships caused by 
Marxist persecution, the 1980s famine, and the anti-Marxist revolution, 
he said. 

SIL is helping missions agencies be prepared in cases of terrorism and 
hostage-taking. Donald Johnson told NIRR that the Summer Institute of 
Linguistics, which has studied disaster readiness since the 1981 
killing of Bible translator Chet Bitterman in Colombia, co-sponsored a 
seminar for other agencies. Registration reached the 60-person limit 
for a March 24-26 seminar in Dallas. Representatives came from 
InterVarsity, United World Mission, Food for the Hungry, TEAM, New 
Tribes Mission, and other groups. 
...The longer a hostage is held, the greater the chances of being 
released unharmed, said Bob Klamser, head of Crisis Consulting 
International, the ministry that co-sponsored the seminar. The retired 
law enforcement officer who specialized in hostage negotiation said 
terrorists rarely capture, feed, and guard hostages they intend to 
kill. He said 95% of missionary hostages are released. Prisoners should 
maintain personal daily routines, and interact respectfully with 
captors, treating them as individuals, not as part of terrorist 
organizations. 
...Terrorism may not be a major concern for some missions. Street 
crime, natural disasters, or civil unrest may be greater threats, 
Klamser said. Although governments, militaries, and businesses are 
spending millions of dollars on guards, armor-plated cars, and guns, 
these options are impractical for missionaries. They "can't minister 
from behind a bunker," Klamser said, but working "where God has sent 
them is the safest place in the world to be." 

Christians are meeting together for the first time in Tibet. A house 
church of 30 believers recently formed in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, 
according to Tony Lambert of Overseas Missions Fellowship. Lambert got 
the first reliable report of the gathering from an 80-year-old Chinese 
Christian who went to Lhasa. As an expert on the church in China for 30 
years, Lambert previously had known only of scattered individual 
Tibetans coming to faith through gospel radio, he told NIRR. The 
Tibetan house church was organized when "four or five Chinese 
Christians were called of God over the last 10 years to Lhasa to work 
and witness," he said. 

Hundreds of church members in Mongolia's fledgling Christian community 
rallied in Ulan Bator last week to protest a government ruling that in 
effect bans most church activities. Altanchimeg Gibbens, head of the 
Mongolian Bible Society (NIRR 3/21), reported that a decree of the 
capital's city council would implement a recent parliamentary action to 
regulate churches. It bans all church meetings and religious activities 
in state-owned buildings, requires detailed information on every church 
member and minister, and subjects churches to periodic inspections and 
annual reviews by the council. Only one of about a dozen church groups 
has been granted registration, Gibbens said. That group has ties to 
Southern Baptist workers, she said, and prospects of heavy aid from 
abroad. Since virtually all buildings are governmentowned, and all 
church groups meet in such facilities, the decree has the effect of 
closing them, she said. effect of closing them, she said.

Vol. 8, No. 7                                           March 21, 1994 

White and black evangelicals will discuss reconciliation at a summit 
next year. Leaders of the predominantly white National Association of 
Evangelicals and the National Black Evangelical Association (NIRR 
5/3/93) will meet in January. The NAE has been slow to work with its 
African-American counterpart, the group's president, Don Argue, 
acknowledged. Chicago pastor Lloyd Lindo, president of the NBEA, said 
he was optimistic. "For the first time in 35 years of ministering in 
the United States, there is welling up within me a significant hope 
that a fresh wind is blowing that will bring reconciliation," Lindo 
told The Dallas Morning News. "We must work for reconciliation so that 
the kingdom of Jesus Christ will no longer be hindered by racism." 
..."Right now, we don't know each other," said Elward Ellis, president 
of Destiny Movement, Inc., which works to involve more African-American 
Christians in international missions and community outreach. "I get on 
the expressway at one exit. You get on at another, so that you bypass 
my house," he said in a sermon during the Sunday night service at the 
NAE's 52nd annual convention in Dallas March 6-8. The message of the 
American church will never be known worldwide "if we cannot even 
understand each other," he said, adding that once officials get past 
the "manifestos and documents," they will have to take some risks to 
"really know each other." 
...President Bill Clinton declined NAE's invitation to attend the 
convention. Argue read Clinton's letter telling NAE officials he was 
unable to attend. As a matter of policy for the last 13 years, every 
president has been invited to the convention, NAE Executive Director 
Billy Melvin said. He told NIRR that he was disappointed Clinton did 
not come. Reacting to criticism of the invitation to Clinton, Melvin 
said that the NAE had "absolutely no apology to make for our policy. 
It's an invitation to the office more than it is to the person or his 
party." 

Christians must take the gospel to the world in a way people can 
understand, even if they are accused, as Jesus was, of being "too much 
the friend of sinners," Knute Larson, senior pastor of The Chapel in 
Akron, Ohio, told members of the NAE convention. Many of the world's 
ways of communicating are not sinful, and should be used by the church, 
he said. The cross of Jesus is less of an offense to the unsaved than 
are the methods some Christians use to communicate the gospel, Larson 
said. "To make use of the `neutral culture,' just as the sinful culture 
does, is what I'm calling the church to," Larson said, distinguishing 
between worldly ways of thinking and worldly ways of communicating. 
However, the result of non-traditional outreach methods, such as 
management and marketing techniques, support groups, and sports, must 
be to lead others to Christ, he said. 
..."The so-called religious right has lost its right to be heard by a 
large segment of the general public," Argue said in his final address 
as NAE president. "Our positions regarding abortion and homosexuality 
are very clear, but we need balanced, articulate, biblical leadership" 
so we do not "alienate the very people we are trying to lead," Argue 
said. "Some have violated Jesus' command to love their enemies and do 
good to those who persecute them." David Rambo, president of the 
Christian and Missionary Alliance since 1987, was elected to succeed 
Argue. 

"Most whites are sleepwalking," unaware of discrimination or blind to 
its impact on minorities, a Louis Harris poll concludes. The "Taking 
America's Pulse" poll, conducted for the National Conference of 
Christians and Jews, found that, while different minority groups harbor 
strong negative prejudices toward each other, they are united in their 
bitter feelings toward white Americans. The survey found that "white 
Americans' vision of how minorities are faring is much more positive, 
diverging widely from the assessment of people of color about their own 
prospects." The poll also reveals a degree of hope. Overwhelming 
majorities of each group are willing to "work with each other to deal 
with pressing community issues such as education, child care, and 
violence." 

Americans do not understand what the church is preaching, according to 
a poll by Barna Research Group. A survey of American adults found that 
few people could explain, in even remotely accurate terms, the meaning 
of commonly used religious terms such as the Great Commission (9%), 
John 3:16 (35%), evangelical (18%), or the gospel (37%). Among adults 
who describe themselves as born-again Christians, fewer than expected 
could correctly explain the four terms: the Great Commission (25%), 
John 3:16 (50%), evangelical (43%), and the gospel (84%). 

A Girl Scouts recruiter said she was fired for refusing to keep secret 
the group's national policy of allowing lesbians and homosexuals to be 
employees and members. After Brenda Mailand, an evangelical Christian, 
discovered the group's sexual-orientation policy, her boss at the 
Michigan Capitol Girl Scouts Council, headquartered in Lansing, warned 
her not to divulge it to the public. Mailand, who was hired to promote 
the Girl Scouts in churches, religious schools, and home schools, 
decided she could not adhere to the policy. She said it deceived 
parents, prospective members, and the public. When she refused to sign 
an agreement to keep silent, she was fired, she said. 
...Mailand's personnel records state that she is a Christian and a 
"threat" to the Girl Scouts, according to the Rutherford Institute, 
which is representing her in a lawsuit. "It might be a different case 
if they brought everyone in and asked them to sign a non-disclosure 
statement," but no other employee was asked to sign the statement, 
Rutherford attorney David Melton told NIRR. "What was really offensive 
is that Brenda never revealed anything and never indicated she was 
going to disclose" the policy to anybody, Melton said. The Girl Scouts 
engaged in a "preemptive strike" to protect their "stealth policies," 
he said. 
...The Boy Scouts of America cannot ban boys who decline to swear duty 
to God, a California appeals court ruled. The decision upheld a lower 
court's 1992 ruling reinstating twins Michael and William Randall (NIRR 
11/30/92, 5/18/92), who were expelled in 1991 for refusing to say "God" 
in the Scouts' oath. Judge Thomas Crosby based his ruling on a 
determination that the BSA is a business rather than a religious 
organization. California's antidiscrimination act, he noted, prohibits 
businesses from excluding people because of their religious beliefs. 

The abrupt firing of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary 
President Russell Dilday by conservative forces who control the 
Southern Baptist Convention has evoked bitter reactions from some of 
the school's students and faculty members. Trustees voted 26-7 to fire 
Dilday after a contentious three-day meeting during which the 
63-yearold president refused to take early retirement, according to 
news reports. Within minutes of the vote, locks were changed on 
Dilday's office door, and he has been asked to vacate the on-campus 
president's mansion by June 7, he said. Dilday had led the Fort Worth, 
Texas, school, which is the largest seminary in the United States, 
since 1978. 
..."Why?" students yelled as newly elected trustee Chairman Ralph 
Pulley read a terse statement announcing Dilday's dismissal to more 
than 1,000 people gathered in the seminary's main auditorium. Several 
days later, some 300 pastors, students, faculty members, and alumni 
rallied to urge that the firing be reversed. Texas Baptist President 
Jerold McBride said the chance for that happening is non-existent. 
"These kinds of people [the trustees who fired Dilday] never admit 
error," he told Associated Baptist Press. Southwestern trustees also 
voted to withdraw an invitation to Keith Parks as the seminary's spring 
commencement speaker, despite Dilday's recommendation to keep him. 
Parks, former president of the SBC Foreign Mission Board, is missions 
coordinator of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, a group of moderate 
Southern Baptists critical of the SBC's conservative leadership. 
Trustees also delayed Dilday's recommendations to reorganize the 
administration, and faculty tenure recommendations. 
...Dilday repeatedly had spoken harshly of what he has called the 
"Orwellian mentality" and tactics of conservatives in their rise to 
power, and nearly was fired in 1984 and 1990 because of his 
outspokenness. He did not earn the conservatives' enmity because of his 
or Southwestern's theological leanings. The SBC Peace Committee, which 
conducted a study of orthodoxy at all the schools, found Southwestern 
to be essentially blameless. Dilday told The New York Times that the 
firing caught him off guard because the board's executive committee had 
given him a glowing appraisal a day earlier. His theology reportedly 
was conservative enough to mute some criticism. 
...Conservatives who insist on a literal interpretation of the Bible 
have controlled leadership of the 15.2million member SBC since 1979. 
That has allowed them gradually to replace most trustees of the 
denomination's six seminaries, and now, to force out presidents at 
three of them. Conservatives also control numerous church agencies, 
from its news service to its Foreign Mission Board. 

Battles continue to rage in the United Methodist Church and the 
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) over the November 1993 gathering called 
RE-Imagining: A Global Theological Conference by Women (NIRR 1/10). 
Both denominations supported the conference financially, and officials, 
especially women, from both churches attended. Their participation has 
drawn fire from conservatives in the denominations for what they 
describe as unorthodox, heretical, and aberrant speeches and rituals 
that took place at the gathering. The meeting's worship events included 
invocations to a feminine deity of wisdom, Sophia, and prayers 
rejoicing in women's bodily fluids. 
...A United Methodist group, the Commission on the Status and Role of 
Women, defended church leaders who attended the conference. Ann Sherer, 
a bishop and president of the commission, said women should evaluate 
for themselves the merits of ideas that are not part of United 
Methodist tradition. Meanwhile, 800 United Methodist women signed a 
statement challenging critics. "We can talk of God as a mineral -- Rock 
of Ages -- but when we speak of God as feminine, it creates a crisis," 
Susan Morrison, a bishop and signer of the statement, said. 
...The General Assembly Council of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) 
declared that no violations of church policy occurred as a result of 
national staff members' participation in the conference. The council 
refused to fire Mary Ann Lundy, who directed the Women's Ministry Unit 
when the conference was being planned. However, it called for a review 
of guidelines for staff members' conduct when their personal views 
conflict with denominational policy, and a re-evaluation of funding for 
such events. 
...A new conservative group, United Methodists for Faith and Freedom, 
called for disciplinary action against those attending. Also, the 
conservative United Methodist Good News caucus denounced RE-Imagining 
and its planners, and urged the church's bishops to confront the 
denomination's "theological crisis." Earl Hunt, a retired United 
Methodist bishop, said at the biennial Congress on Evangelism in Myrtle 
Beach, S.C., that efforts to fuse worship of Sophia with Christianity 
are an "attempt to reconstitute the godhead." The editor of The 
Presbyterian Layman and 5,000 supporters also have charged that the 
conference was dominated by heresy and paganism. 

For the 32 female deacons who were ordained this month as priests in 
the Church of England, little will change (NIRR 3/7). In addition to 
their duties as chaplains, educators, or parish workers, they will be 
allowed to consecrate the communion elements. In time, some may become 
vicars of churches, though it will require another vote of the church 
before they can become bishops. The 32 women, the first to benefit from 
the historic vote in 1992 that opened the priesthood to women in 
Britain, were consecrated by Bishop of Bristol Barry Rogerson in a 
service that was attended by about 1,000 and was televised live. 
...The church has about 1,200 women deacons, all eligible for 
ordination, church sources said. Throughout the Anglican Communion, 
there are 1,381 women priests in 12 of the 28 self-governing Anglican 
"provinces," including 1,031 in the U.S. Episcopal Church, according to 
the Anglican Consultative Council. Two women are diocesan bishops: Mary 
McLeod in Vermont (NIRR 11/15/93) and Penelope Jamieson in New Zealand. 
Parishes may refuse to accept a woman priest, and bishops cannot be 
compelled to ordain women or accept them in their dioceses. 

Gospel singing drowned out the shouts, whistles, drumming and screams 
of 150 pro-choice, gay, and lesbian demonstrators outside Chicago's 
Armitage Baptist Church March 9 (NIRR 5/4/92). Demonstrators from 10 
militant organizations -- including Sister Serpent (a witches group) 
and Queer Nation (a homosexual group) -- had organized the protest on 
the street during the regular Wednesday night prayer service at the 
multi-ethnic church. The demonstration was planned to coincide with the 
anniversary of the death of David Gunn, the abortion doctor shot 
outside the Pensacola Women's Medical Services clinic on March 10, 
1993. Earlier this month, Michael Griffin, 32, was convicted of 
first-degree murder in the killing and sentenced to life in prison. 
...Inside the church, the service became a concert of prayer for the 
demonstrators and for revival in the land. Midweek services at Armitage 
normally attract 200 people, but 1,400 from 50 Chicago churches that 
had heard about the planned demonstration came to support Armitage. The 
crowd of worshipers overflowed from the main auditorium into a second 
auditorium and into the street. Outside the church, contained behind 
police lines, the demonstrators screamed, banged drums, and held signs 
that read "Fight the Christian Right" and "No Return to Backyard 
Butchers." After the demonstration had been going on for about an hour, 
seven buses from Salem Baptist Church pulled up and people streamed out 
onto the front steps of the church. When the Salem choir started 
singing, the protesters tried briefly to compete with them, fell silent 
and listened for about 15 minutes, then "broke up and slid into the 
night," Armitage's pastor, Charles Lyons, told NIRR. 
...The protesters had distributed flyers to drum up community 
participation in the demonstration. They failed to gain as many 
supporters as they wanted, Lyons said, because Armitage has earned a 
good reputation in the community as a church that helps others, 
including doing such things as funding an alternative school last fall 
when the city lacked money to open it. Lyons said he also "had to tell 
the local street gangs to stay away, because they were going to come in 
our behalf and bust heads." There was a "sense of God in all of this," 
Lyons said. "God's people came together and God's people prayed." 

Michael Novak, winner of the $1-million Templeton Prize for Progress in 
Religion for 1994, is little known to the general public, but stirs 
debate within academic and theological circles. Novak, 60, a former 
Roman Catholic priest, who once was a leading liberal theologian, 
philosopher, and anti-war activist, became disillusioned with liberal 
politics. He is known for his view that free enterprise, when 
controlled by moral forces, is the best economic system for lifting the 
poor, and for his criticisms of collective economics and liberation 
theology (NIRR 5/21/91). Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime 
minister and a staunch conservative, was among the Templeton judges. 
Novak, who also served as a U.S. ambassador for human rights, is a 
Religion and Public Policy scholar at the American Enterprise Institute 
in Washington, D.C. He said he will use the money to endow 
scholarships, fund Crisis (a lay Catholic journal he edits), and 
support a school in Bangladesh, where his brother, a missionary, died 
in 1964. 

Pulitzer Prize-winning author Alice Walker's story Roselily was removed 
from a California state readingcomprehension test for 8th- and 
10th-graders. The story describes the thoughts of a black Southerner as 
she prepares to marry a Muslim and move to Chicago. Traditional Values 
Coalition leaders and others said the story was antiChristian because 
the Muslim man suggests Christians are following "the wrong God," and 
the woman associates Christianity with ropes, chains, and handcuffs. 
TVC's Beverly Sheldon said Roselily is an example of standardized 
testing that teaches politically correct values rather than measures 
academic achievement. The state Board of Education removed the story 
from the test on grounds that disclosure of it as part of the test, 
along with sample questions published by Southern California 
newspapers, had compromised the testing process. 
...The California Teachers Association and the National Writers Guild, 
prodded by Walker, called for restoration of the story to the test. 
Attorneys for People for the American Way and the American Civil 
Liberties Union denounced the board's action as censorship. Two other 
stories, including another by Walker, were dropped from the tests on 
other grounds (violent content and anti-meat bias). After a noisy 
hearing this month, school board members agreed to allow all three 
stories to be included on the approved list for 1995 exams. 

The U.S. constitutionality of school vouchers for religious schools may 
be tested first in Puerto Rico. Superior Court Judge Alfredo Alicea 
Lopez heard arguments on a motion in a case against Gov. Pedro 
Rossello's plan to distribute $1,500 vouchers to 6,500 students in 
seven communities, including those who attend sectarian schools. Puerto 
Rican lawsuits can be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The case is 
important as the first test of "educational choice" programs, according 
to Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which, along 
with the American Civil Liberties Union, supported the plaintiff, the 
Puerto Rican Teachers Association. The Washington, D.C.-based Institute 
for Justice argued for the defense in the Asociaci n de Maestros de 
Puerto Rico v. Torres case. The judge could rule as soon as next month. 

The Vatican announced the creation of the Pontifical Academy of Life, a 
combination think tank and lobby, to work against use of contraception, 
abortion, and euthanasia. Its 70 researchers and communicators will 
include nonCatholics and non-Christians who subscribe to the Catholic 
Church's teachings on pro-life issues, a Vatican spokesman said. Among 
other things, they will focus on problems in medical advances and how 
they relate to the promotion and defense of life, he said. 
...The Vatican announced it has established full diplomatic relations 
with South Africa, describing the move as a "just recognition" of the 
country's drive to end apartheid. A Vatican document on racism in 1989 
had condemned a "prolonged state of repression" in South Africa. The 
Vatican also said it has established diplomatic relations with Jordan. 
In nearby Iraq, Chaldean patriarch Rufael Bedaweed told a news 
conference that Pope John Paul II has accepted an invitation by the 
Iraqi government to visit that land, but no date was announced. The 
pope is scheduled to visit Lebanon in May, but some church leaders are 
urging him to stay away because of possible dangers. Also, the pontiff 
reportedly will visit the United States and the United Nations in 
October. 

The Freedom From Religion Foundation is out to stop public officials 
from participating in prayer breakfasts: from local observances to the 
annual National Prayer Breakfast in Washington. This month, a judge in 
Denver denied a request by the Madison, Wis.-based group (NIRR 11/1/93) 
for a temporary restraining order to forbid state and local officials 
from taking part in a prayer luncheon sponsored by the Denver 
Leadership Foundation, part of a national prayer-breakfast movement 
headed by Doug Coe in Arlington, Va. Judge Larry Naves said religion's 
role in American life is widely acknowledged, and noted that the 
National Prayer Breakfast has been sponsored by congressional groups 
for more than 40 years. 

A retired Jewish couple from Maryland sued the National Park Service 
after a Christian employee of a park concession invited them to attend 
worship services at amphitheaters in Big Bend (Texas) National Park. 
The suit accuses the park service of violating the First Amendment by 
having too close a relationship with Christian Ministry, a New 
York-based group that has conducted services in national parks for 40 
years. The couple alleges that park officials permit the group to 
advertise and conduct religious services without permits; provide 
rent-free or subsidized housing to the group's staff; and reserve park 
service jobs for its ministers. Warren Ost, Christian Ministry's head, 
denied any direct ties with the park system, and said the group's staff 
who happen to be employed in the park system don't proselytize on the 
job. The couple said the employee, who was on duty at the time, walked 
into their room at a park lodge when they were unclothed, and issued an 
invitation "to join in worshiping our Lord and Savior." 

Because of perceived violations of public trust by non-profit groups, 
Congress is considering the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1993. The bill, 
already passed by the Senate but held up in the House Committee on the 
Judiciary, will require non-profit groups that engage in political 
lobbying to reveal the details of their actions. Most such groups hold 
501(c)(4) non-profit tax status, as opposed to 501(c)(3) status which 
most churches, educational facilities, and charitable groups fall 
under. Non-profits already must disclose to the IRS the amounts they 
spend on lobbying, but the legislation's new rules would require them 
to disclose contracts and the issues lobbied. 
...The act poses both short-term and long-term problems, according to 
Sarah Schmidt of Gammon and Grange, a Washington firm specializing in 
non-profit law. She told NIRR that in addition to imposing more 
form-filing administrative burdens on lobbying groups, the law could 
have a more permanent effect on how other non-profits achieve their 
purposes and goals. Although, she said, the law has few immediate 
implications for most 501(c)(3)s, which cannot directly lobby without 
endangering their tax-exemptions, such groups could be affected if they 
are members of or affiliated with 501(c)(4)s, the primary targets of 
the legislation. 
...More than 320 religious and secular non-profits are opposing the 
bill as written. They claim it will deter non-profits from engaging in 
advocacy and education efforts on a wide range of issues. In a Feb. 7 
letter to committee Chairman Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Texas), the groups 
insisted that they support the principle of public disclosure, but 
warned that the legislation would subject them to "multiple and 
non-consistent" reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Leading 
non-profits in the charge against the act is Washington-based 
Independent Sector. 

Federal and state governments will be watching independent colleges and 
universities more closely if proposed federal regulations are enacted. 
Schools whose students receive federal loans or grants could be forced 
to comply with conditions that are at cross-purposes with their mission 
statements, conservative Christian educators say. The regulations would 
implement Title IV, Part H of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992. 
Religious and secular colleges, led by the National Association of 
Independent Colleges and Universities, have protested the regulations. 
The Department of Education is accepting public comment until March 21. 
...Any one of 12 criteria could prompt a government review. Criteria 
include questions about rates of student loans, standards of financial 
responsibility, measurement of student academic performance, compliance 
with health and safety standards, and a student's potential earning 
power versus tuition costs. Regulators would include newly established 
state Post-Secondary Review Entities, accrediting bodies with stricter 
procedures, and a federal eligibility and certification process in the 
U.S. Department of Education. 
...The regulations are meant to correct abuses by some for-profit 
schools, such as technical-training schools, but have gone too far, 
Jerry Self, assistant director of the Southern Baptist Education 
Commission, told NIRR. The paperwork "would make private education 
almost grind to a halt," he said. "It's true that there are crooks out 
there in higher education, and they should be stopped," said Richard 
Gathro of the Christian College Coalition. "But to sweep private 
colleges with the same broom" would waste time and diminish the 
effectiveness of colleges, he told NIRR. 

Professor Dean Kenyon's "intelligent design" theory of origins of human 
beings has been censured by his colleagues at San Francisco State 
University. A 27-5 vote of the biology faculty in February declared the 
senior department member's theory unworthy because "there is no 
scientific evidence to support the concept." In the 1970s, Kenyon was a 
leading advocate of the chemical evolutionary theory, the idea that 
life arose from a "primordial soup." He since has changed his mind as a 
result of examining studies that show that complex genetic information 
does not "self-organize" from simple chemicals. Kenyon said he believes 
his recent censure is the first of its kind to be passed anywhere in 
higher education. February's resolution did not recommend any action to 
be taken against Kenyon, but resulted in a charged academic atmosphere. 
Colleagues in other academic disciplines reportedly have asked whether 
other non-traditional theories will be subject to censure. 
...The controversy emerged in 1992 when Kenyon was reprimanded by the 
school's administration for discussing his views in an introductory 
biology class. Not only did Kenyon teach standard evolutionary 
theories, but he also presented evidence for his later theory. 
Administrators, however, accused him of teaching religion, not science. 
Last January, they removed him from his class and reassigned him to 
labs. When the American Association of University Professors, the 
Academic Freedom Committee, and the Academic Senate at San Francisco 
State all protested, Biology Department Chair John Hafernik decided to 
reinstate Kenyon. 

Following a barrage of protests, US West reversed its decision to ban 
Christian symbols and references from nursing home ads in its 300 
Yellow Pages directories in 14 states (NIRR 3/7). The firm had 
instituted the ban reportedly under pressure from the fair housing 
division of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
Instead, nursing homes that use religious symbols to advertise in the 
Yellow Pages must insert a statement of nondiscrimination, such as, 
"All faiths welcome without preference," a US West spokeswoman said. 

To ensure that Islamic religious and social values are not undermined 
by foreign TV programs, Saudi Arabia is installing a $200-million 
wireless cable television system that will control reception of outside 
programming, news sources reported. A royal decree this month banned 
the use or manufacture of any means for receiving and distributing 
foreign satellite broadcasts. 
...A Moroccan film festival awarded top honors to an Israeli 
documentary. The Arab hosts warmly welcomed and openly introduced the 
two young Israeli filmmakers, Alon Bar and Eitan Ben-Nun, according to 
one of the film's sponsors, the International Christian Embassy 
Jerusalem. The men were housed in a separate hotel and were presented 
their award in a private meeting. Although numerous filmmakers 
boycotted official events the pair attended, it has "deep political 
significance" that they were not only invited but awarded the Golden 
Crown for best documentary, Bar said. The English-language film, 
Exodus: The Mountain of God, is a study of the area in the Negev desert 
that an Italian archaeologist believes to be Mount Sinai. The film has 
been subtitled in seven languages, and it will be marketed by an 
American video company, according to ICEJ. 

Prime-time TV network news shows aired 212 religion stories out of 
18,000 news items last year, according to Media Research Center in 
Washington, D.C. About 25% dealt with the pope's visit to Denver, and 
25 stories were devoted to coverage of sex-abuse allegations, since 
withdrawn, against Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, MRC said. Among the other 
most-commonly reported items were Supreme Court rulings and activities 
of the religious right. Baptists, who comprise about 20% of the U.S. 
population, were covered in one news story all year. Of the 212 
religion stories, 78 were brief items read by the anchor, MRC noted. 
CNN ran the most stories, 73, but ABC's 46 items gave it the highest 
stories-per-hour average. Coming in lowest were CBS with 31 stories and 
MacNeil-Lehrer on PBS with 17. The study did not include the Branch 
Davidian showdown with authorities or the World Trade Center bombing. 

Evangelist James Robison's television program Life Today, which was 
canceled by the Family Channel last fall, also has been dropped from 
two morning slots on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. TBN spokesman 
Terry Hickey indicated the network was going to show another type of 
evangelistic broadcasting. Robison said in a letter to supporters that 
the loss of air time had created a "very critical time financially for 
the ministry." Life Outreach International is active in missions, 
evangelism, and relief in North America and 24 foreign countries, 
Robison said. 

David Briggs has succeeded George Cornell as top religion writer at The 
Associated Press. Cornell retired at age after spending 43 years at the 
AP religion desk. A columnist and reporter, Cornell has covered most of 
the significant denominational and ecumenical events and developments 
since the 1950s. His columns, which began in 1951, were the first on 
religion to be carried by a news wire service. Briggs, 38, a Yale 
Divinity School graduate and former religion writer for the Buffalo 
News, was hired five years ago to assist Cornell. 

Jerry Falwell is publishing a newspaper again -- but he is not reviving 
the Moral Majority. Falwell, who heads Liberty University in Lynchburg, 
Va., has begun a monthly, 12-page tabloid called Liberty Flame. The 
publication addresses social-political issues and is targeted for 
pastors. The initial mailing was 50,000 copies. The new publication is 
not preliminary to additional political involvement, and no new 
organization is being formed, Falwell spokesman Mark DeMoss told NIRR. 
Falwell is "never again going to travel the country three to four days 
a week," but instead will continue to tend to administrative duties at 
Liberty University and speak at pastors' conferences, DeMoss said. 
Falwell has not had a publication for five years. He formerly published 
Fundamentalist Journal and Moral Majority Report, which became Liberty 
Report and ceased publication in 1989. 

Printers may turn down jobs on the basis of their beliefs without being 
subject to state discrimination charges, a Franklin County, Vt., court 
ruled. The case involved a St. Albans print shop, whose owners refused 
to print membership cards for a group of Catholics who support abortion 
rights. Judge Linda Levitt ruled last month that owners Malcolm and 
Susan Baker's First Amendment rights to free speech and free exercise 
of religion outweighed the claim of Linda Paquette, leader of the 
pro-choice group, under the state's anti-discrimination statute. The 
decision reversed a ruling in Paquette's favor by the Vermont Human 
Rights Commission. An appeal is expected. 

A group of black ministers, including Nation of Islam leader Louis 
Farrakhan, bought WLGO-AM radio in Columbia, S.C., and announced plans 
to buy more stations. The ministers belong to the African American 
Religious Connection, which buys air time to discuss society's "moral 
crisis" and the "economic trials" faced by blacks, and to broadcast 
gospel music, an AARC spokeswoman said. 
...Farrakhan came under attack by five prominent black ministers in 
Boston and nearby Cambridge. In a public letter, they accused him of 
hypocrisy for preaching against black-on-black violence while failing 
to condemn crimes allegedly linked to the Nation of Islam. They 
demanded to know what role, if any, he may have had in the 
assassination of black leader Malcolm X in 1965. The slaying occurred 
two years after Malcolm X broke with Nation of Islam leader Elijah 
Muhammad. Farrakhan took Malcolm X's place as leader of the group's 
Harlem branch. One of the letter's signers was Eugene Rivers (NIRR 
7/12/93), whose father was a black Muslim who worked with both Malcolm 
X and Farrakhan. In a speech in Amherst, Mass., Farrakhan acknowledged 
that he had considered Malcolm X an enemy, but denied having anything 
to do with his death. 

Feeding people is not the church's primary function, a District of 
Columbia zoning board said in not allowing Western Presbyterian Church 
to feed breakfast to homeless people at its new location, a few blocks 
from its old site. Residents had told the city they did not want 
undesirables, whom they said the feeding program would attract to their 
neighborhood. Pastor John Wimberly argued that the church has an 
inherent right and duty to feed the poor. Western Presbyterian has 
appealed the ruling. 
...Angered at the decision to restrict church programs for the poor, 
scores of District of Columbia pastors and other leaders called on all 
congregations with church-based community activities -- from Scout 
groups and day-care centers to shelters for the homeless and Alcoholics 
Anonymous meetings -- to dare the city to start requiring permits. 
...Constitutional scholars said the conflict could become a test case 
for the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. It requires governments to 
prove there is a "compelling state interest" in regulating religious 
institutions. 

A former skeptic who regularly denounced Christianity on television and 
radio talk shows now is in the fulltime ministry. Austin Miles became a 
guest on religious talk shows in the 1960s. As a circus ringmaster in 
Memphis, Tenn., in 1964, he prayed for a spectator who had ostensibly 
dropped dead of a heart attack -- and the man apparently returned to 
life. "I was probably the only one in the crowd who didn't have faith," 
he told NIRR. 
...Miles eventually became embittered by the actions of several 
Christian organizations, which exploited him, he said. "I began to feel 
it was my duty to warn the world and stop Christianity," he told NIRR. 
He wrote the books Don't Call Me Brother and Setting the Captives Free, 
intended to expose the shortcomings of evangelists, and appeared on 
talk shows hosted by Larry King and Geraldo Rivera. 
...When Miles was hired as a skeptic for the CBS-TV special Ancient 
Secrets of the Bible, "I began a deep study of the Bible, like I had 
never done before," he said. As "an investigative writer," Miles 
discovered that the Bible was true, he said. Miles pastors a small 
church in Oakley, Calif., works to reconcile himself to his former 
foes, and speaks to groups about his experiences. 

Pastors now have an 800 number to call for confidential prayer, 
encouragement, and information. The National Pastor's Encouragement 
Line helps pastors, missionaries, Christian workers, and lay leaders 
with the stresses of ministry. Jerry Frear, founder of Under His Wing 
Ministries of Williamsport, Pa. (NIRR 2/8), and several volunteers, 
staff the line, which has been operated for a year as a toll line. 
...Most callers just need to talk and know they are not alone with 
their problems, Frear told NIRR. About 20% of the callers have more 
serious needs, and are referred to crisis intervention centers or 
pastoral-support ministries. The line is available Monday through 
Friday from 5 to 7 p.m. at 1-800-UPLIFT-U (or 875-4388). Under His Wing 
also gives a Missionary of the Year Award, Pastor of the Year Award, 
and is working to establish a National Pastors' Appreciation Day. The 
fledgling Christian community in Mongolia faces discrimination and 
restrictions by parliament and courts, and factionalism within, 
according to Altanchimeg Gibbens. The country's best-known Christian 
helped translate the New Testament into Mongolian and founded the Bible 
Society of Mongolia. Two months ago, the country's Constitutional Court 
struck down several provisions of a restrictive law on church and state 
relations passed by the Mongolian parliament last November, but let 
stand eight others (NIRR 1/24). These include banning "organized 
propagation of religion" by foreigners; forbidding religious 
instruction and gatherings in schools and other state facilities; 
requiring respect by the state for Buddhism as the predominant 
religion; banning activities considered alien to traditions and customs 
of the Mongolian people; requiring permission from local and national 
governments to establish churches; and establishing the government's 
right to regulate the number of clergy and church locations. 
...Christians in the formerly Communist-run country have grown from a 
handful in 1990 to more than 2,000 today, Gibbens told NIRR. They meet 
in rented halls and homes, she added, noting that so far only one group 
has won government approval as a church. Some believers want to defy 
the government and aggressively pursue outreach and other activities, 
while others advocate a low-profile approach. She said some blame the 
government's harsh stance against highly visible campaigns by ministry 
workers from the West for giving Buddhists and hard-liners leverage in 
seeking the public's support for regulation. 

Some 45,000 Christ-centered dictionaries are being distributed in 20 
countries across Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe, according to a 
recent report released by All Nations Literature. Already 90,000 have 
been distributed by "paper missionaries" in China, Hong Kong, India, 
the Commonwealth of Independent States, and Ghana. The 900page English 
dictionary includes definitions of scientific, medical, and spiritual 
terms, and is distributed primarily as an evangelism tool to people who 
want to learn English. The report said several mission agencies have 
requested copies of the dictionaries for use in public schools, 
churches, and seminaries. ANL reports that 700 million people are 
studying English as a second language. 

Compassion International has begun development work in Ethiopia. Since 
the civil war recently ended there, thousands of children have been 
abandoned, orphaned, displaced, or abused. The Ministry of Education 
reports only one in 10 children attends school. Compassion hopes to 
provide education, health services, food, and Christian education to 
2,000 children by the end of June. Compassion's newly appointed 
Ethiopian director, Shiferaw Michael, a Christian in the former 
Communist regime, said, "I consider it a miracle that I was not 
demoted, dismissed, or imprisoned," Michael said. He believes the 
"harvest is great in Africa," and Compassion will play a major role. 

A new program aims to mobilize churches to adopt one drug addict and to 
help see the person through to recovery. Churches participating in the 
One Church-One Addict program would appoint a small committee of 
members who provide help for a recovering addict. The laymen would 
learn about substance abuse at government and private programs, then 
help provide job training, psychological or spiritual counseling, 
referrals to professional treatment, or mediation with employers or 
relatives. Pilot projects will begin in Maryland and Illinois, and also 
may involve mosques and synagogues, organizers say. An estimated 2.7 
million Americans are hard-core drug users. 
...Funding of $350,000 for the first year comes from foundations and 
private donations, said George Clemens, the Catholic priest from 
Chicago who founded the program. Clemens gained national attention in 
the 1980s when he adopted four children and became the subject of a 
television movie. He also is known for his One Church-One Child 
campaign to find African-American adoptive parents for black and 
biracial children. The program has led to adoptions for more than 
40,000 children in 39 states, he said. Co-sponsor of One Church-One 
Addict is the Washington D.C.based American Alliance for Rights and 
Responsibilities, which aims to popularize the "communitarian" ideal of 
citizens taking responsibility for solving social problems instead of 
looking only toward government (NIRR 11/30/92). 

About 43,000 youth groups across North America participated in See You 
At The Party March 5. For the second year, Christian students hosted 
local pizza parties for their peers while tuning in to a satellite 
broadcast featuring music and testimony on Trinity Broadcasting Network 
(NIRR 3/8/93). See You at the Party has permanently changed the 
church's stance toward youth ministry, organizers said. The event 
provides training for students to share their faith, which "jump-starts 
a lot of groups toward outreach," said Dann Spader of SonLife 
Ministries, which sponsored Operation Powerlink with Josh McDowell 
Ministries. "Many kids have taken the resources and ideas and have 
expanded them in creative ways to reach their friends with the gospel," 
Spader said. have expanded them in creative ways to reach their friends 
with the gospel," Spader said.

Vol. 8, No. 6                                                           
        March 7, 1994 

Christians are angry about the possibility of a federally mandated 
"religion-free" workplace. In light of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling 
declaring sexual harassment to be discrimination, the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission, which enforces federal civil-rights laws in job 
matters, is revising standards by which to judge discrimination under 
Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The EEOC is in the process of 
issuing Guidelines on Harassment Based on Race, Color, Religion, 
Gender, National Origin, Age, and Disability. 
...By widening harassment to include religion, any workplace mention or 
display of faith could be illegal under federal law, critics said. They 
indicated that in the worst scenarios a religious calendar, cross 
jewelry, a personal invitation to a Bible study, or a post-sneeze "God 
bless you" in the workplace could mean charges of religious harassment. 
The guidelines, they say, would discourage free speech and free 
exercise of religion for employees and employers. "Verbal or physical 
conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an 
individual" because of religion would constitute harassment under the 
new guidelines. EEOC guidelines define harassment as conduct that 
denigrates or shows hostility to an individual on religious grounds. 
The action must: create, or mean to create, a work environment that is 
intimidating, hostile, or offensive -- or one that unreasonably 
interferes with work performance; or otherwise hinders employment 
opportunities. Harassment would be judged by the standards of a 
"reasonable person," but should take into account the particular 
sensitivities of members of the alleged victim's faith. 
...Because EEOC could make the changes at any time, Christian groups 
urge an immediate response. Because the time for public comment to the 
EEOC has expired, several organizations asked their supporters to tell 
Congress and the EEOC that they oppose the religious provisions. Some 
suggested targeting Reps. William Ford (D-Mich.) and William Goodling 
(R-Penn.), the ranking members of the Education and Labor Committee, 
which oversees the EEOC. News sources report that more than 45 House 
members already have signed a letter of opposition sponsored by Rep. 
Howard "Buck" McKeon (R-Calif.). Citing the Religious Freedom 
Restoration Act, which bars government from interfering on religious 
issues without a "compelling interest," the congressmen asked Acting 
EEOC Chairman Tony Gallegos to remove the religious category from 
consideration. 

Yellow Pages publishers are telling customers they can no longer use 
religious symbols in their housing advertisements. US West, which 
produces 300 Yellow Page directories in 14 states, and Bell Atlantic, 
which publishes 240 Yellow Pages directories in six states near 
Washington, D.C., instituted the policy changes after the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development investigated them for possible 
discrimination. HUD mandates that ads related to housing -- from 
rentals and real estate to lending banks, trailer parks, and nursing 
homes -- can not display items that appear to discriminate on the basis 
of religion, family status, age, or gender. Religious symbols or 
phrases in an ad can be viewed by a customer as implying their business 
is not welcome, US West spokeswoman Susan Poulos said. US West told two 
church-related nursing homes in St. Cloud, Minn., to delete religious 
symbols from their ads. 
...Critics see the action as interfering with the free exercise of 
religion. Bob Knight of the Washington, D.C.based Family Research 
Council said the ban on religious symbols amounts to "using government 
power to openly attack religious freedom." HUD's fair-housing division 
head is Roberta Achtenberg, a lesbian activist and former San Francisco 
City Supervisor who has been criticized previously by conservatives for 
her attempt to force the Bay Area Boy Scouts to accept homosexual 
Scoutmasters. Nelson Dias, chief counsel for HUD, said he wants to 
strike a balance between fighting discrimination and allowing full 
freedom of religion, according to news reports. 

Home schoolers created an uproar over a bill in the U.S. House of 
Representatives. A provision of a $12.4billion elementary and secondary 
education spending bill (H.R. 6) would have required teachers to be 
certified in their assigned subjects, effectively banning home 
education for about 99% of home schoolers. When word of the threat to 
home schooling became known, tens of thousands of calls and faxes 
jammed Capitol switchboards for a week on the issue, which many said 
generated more than the issue of homosexuals in the military. 
...Stunned by the amount of opposition, lawmakers voted 424-1 to scrap 
the certification requirement. They then added amendments to the bill 
to assure teachers in home schools, private schools, and religious 
schools that they are not subject to certification requirements. The 
votes were "a tribute to the response of pro-family America," said Gary 
Bauer, president of the Family Research Council. 

A Miami church lost a $4-million negligence suit for hiring a youth 
minister who sexually abused nearly a dozen teen boys. A Dade County 
Circuit Court jury found Wayside Baptist Church guilty of negligence in 
hiring Steve Geren, who has been fired from the staff and is serving a 
15-year prison sentence for sexual battery. The church was not found 
negligent in its supervision of Geren. The money was awarded to one of 
the victims, Daniel Artis, for emotional pain and the cost of 
psychological treatment. 
...Wayside's pastor, Murrill Boitnott, worked with Geren previously at 
a Lakeland, Fla., Baptist church, got a reference from the pastor of 
another church where Geren was a ministry intern, and read Florida 
Baptist Children's Home documents that approved Geren to be a foster 
parent. He found no reason to doubt his character, he said. What 
Boitnott did not know was that Geren had told a pastor several years 
previously about his abuse as a child and homosexual tendencies, 
Boitnott said. "The court expected me to be omniscient," he told NIRR. 
He acknowledged that no police or background checks were made on Geren, 
although Geren had no previous convictions. Wayside Baptist facilities 
suffered $4 million in damages by Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and have 
not been able to secure a $850,000 loan to rebuild because of the 
negligence judgment, Boitnott said. 
...Churches must exercise special care in screening potential employees 
or volunteers who would work with youth, children, or other "vulnerable 
parts of the congregation," said J. Brent Walker, general counsel for 
the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs. The screening process 
should include a "thorough application with a lot of penetrating 
questions," an extensive interview, at least three to five written 
references followed by phone calls, and a criminal-record check by 
authorities in locations where the applicant has worked, Walker told 
NIRR. 
...Very careful supervision also is necessary, Walker said. Church 
policy should state that new members of the church should not be 
allowed to work with youth or children for six months, because "if 
you've got a pedophile, they'll be deterred from working if they know 
they have to wait," he said. Also, churches should never allow any 
adult to be alone with a child, "particularly where there could be a 
compromising situation," he said. This is not only to deter sexual 
abuse, but to protect the alleged wrongdoer. Groups such as the Boy 
Scouts are "much further down the line in screening workers," and to 
the degree they have tightened their screening processes, it is 
"pushing child abusers toward the church," Walker said. 

Religious groups were among the thousands of investors defrauded of 
$450 million between 1987 and 1993 by a Manhattan bill collector whose 
financial empire collapsed a year ago, according to several lawsuits. 
Steven Hoffenberg is charged with operating Towers Financial Corp. of 
New York as an enterprise that used fraud to obtain money from 
investors. He asserted it was a $700-million management-services 
conglomeration. 
...Towers Financial Corp. allegedly siphoned the money through a 
variety of illegal means. It reportedly concocted fictional financial 
records to deceive potential investors, padded the company's inventory 
of discounted invoices, transferred company money to private accounts, 
and sustained Hoffenberg's opulent lifestyle and political influence by 
using company funds. Much of the money raised from later investors was 
used to repay those who bought in earlier, creating what is called a 
Ponzi scheme, said Richard Walker, the regional administrator for the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC has filed a civil suit in 
the case, and suits by the Towers board and a class-action suit by 
victims also are pending. 
...Arab World Ministries, an interdenominational, evangelical mission, 
lost $300,000 that missionary families had raised to provide for their 
retirement and the education of their children, said U.S. Director 
William Saal. Towers had been paying dividends and "appeared to be 
producing the kind of income" expected, Saal said. Other religious 
groups that purchased promissory notes from Towers were: Bible 
Literature International, Columbus, Ohio, $300,000; St. John's Priest 
Relief Society, Ozone Park, N.Y., $65,500; Western Catholic Union, 
Quincy, Ill., $50,000; Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Church, 
Ozone Park, $100,000; St. Catherine of Alexandria Roman Catholic 
Church, Brooklyn, N.Y., $185,500; Immaculate Conception Church, 
Waterbury, Conn., $100,000; and Agasha Temple of Wisdom, North 
Hollywood, Calif., $1,050,000. Other victims include large commercial 
banks and pension funds for small companies and unions, according to 
court records. Because Hoffenberg squandered much of the money, 
prospects for the thousands of people who entrusted their savings to 
Towers Financial Corp. are bleak. "For us it's a tragedy. We're all 
sitting tight, waiting and praying for the grace of God to prevail," 
Saal told NIRR. 

The value of hypnosis in refreshing memory has come under more 
suspicion. Steven Cook, the man who accused Roman Catholic Cardinal 
Joseph Bernardin of sexually abusing him two decades ago (NIRR 
11/29/93), voluntarily dropped his lawsuit against the Chicago prelate, 
claiming his memories of abuse now were unreliable. Cook had said the 
memories on which he based the $10-million suit arose during and after 
hypnosis. Before undergoing hypnosis, Cook had no recollection of ever 
having met Bernardin, according to court documents. Court papers also 
showed that the therapist who administered the hypnosis, Michele Moul, 
is not a licensed psychiatrist. Defense attorneys claimed the 
techniques used do not meet standards necessary for admission as 
evidence. Federal and state courts have allowed evidence gained from 
hypnosis only if certain standards and safeguards are met. In Ohio, for 
example, hypnosis must be done by a licensed psychiatrist or 
psychologist and detailed recordings must be made of a client's 
memories prior to the session. The U.S. Supreme Court noted that there 
is no consensus among the American medical establishment on the use of 
hypnosis to refresh memory. 
...Only Bernardin was dropped from the suit, which also accuses the 
archdiocese of Cincinnati and archdiocesan officials, including current 
Cincinnati Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk, of negligence. Ellis Harsham 
remains accused of the abuse, which allegedly occurred in the 1970s 
while Cook was a teen-ager and a pre-seminarian. 

The verdicts in the Branch Davidian case might encourage some cults to 
continue in their wrongdoing, said Cynthia Kisser, head of the 
Chicago-based Cult Awareness Network. A San Antonio jury acquitted all 
11 sect members of murder-conspiracy charges, but found five guilty of 
the lesser crime of voluntary manslaughter, and convicted two others of 
weapons abuses. Kisser told Religious News Service that the verdict and 
fear of church-state entanglement could make the government and the 
public less likely to get involved when people with religious 
backgrounds commit crimes. Kisser predicted the case would probably be 
soon forgotten, an unfortunate fact since a continuing dialogue on 
religious liberty versus individual rights is necessary (NIRR 
12/13/93). "It's so tragically true that with cult-related activity, no 
one wins." 
...David Koresh is coming back, says a follower. Briton Renos Avraam 
told reporters that the Branch Davidian leader (NIRR 4/5/93) would 
return within three-and-one-half years of his April 19 death in the 
fire that destroyed the cult's Waco, Texas, compound. Avraam said 
Koresh will return "in great majesty and glory . . . like the ghost 
rider in the sky." He said Koresh's Second Coming would put many to 
shame for their disbelief, and would prove the leader, who claimed to 
be the Son of God, "was no charlatan." Other members of the sect hold 
the same belief. Avraam made his comments from a San Antonio jail, 
where he awaits sentencing for his manslaughter conviction. 
...Koresh's mother says her son has spoken to her in a series of 
life-like dreams. Bonnie Haldeman told the Associated Press that said 
she had never put much faith in such communication, but one dream in 
which her son said, "I'm all right, Mama" was "so real." She asked God 
to bless the jurors after she heard that they found the Davidians not 
guilty of the most serious charges. Haldeman also expressed sorrow for 
the families of the slain federal agents and Waco compound inhabitants. 

The Southern Baptist Convention decided not to reopen its debate over 
Freemasonry. Some Masonic teachings are incompatible with Christianity, 
but membership in a Masonic group is "a matter of personal conscience," 
the executive committee of the Home Mission Board said, affirming an 
earlier report (NIRR 6/28/93). Masons have an estimated 3.5 million 
members nationwide, including 1.3 million Southern Baptists. 
Individuals should let their consciences guide them "in light of the 
Holy Scripture and in light of the findings of the report," Larry 
Lewis, president of the Home Mission Board, told the press. It would 
not have been appropriate for the SBC to dictate how local churches 
should respond to Freemasonry, he said. 
...The action is being interpreted by some as an endorsement of Masons, 
so the issue will not go away, dissenting executive committee trustee 
Walter Collett told Associated Baptist Press. The resolution affirming 
the report attacked implications that it was "developed under the 
supervision of Masons, and that fear of financial repercussions caused 
us to compromise on this issue." 

St. Paul Lutheran Church in Oakland, Calif., wants to keep Ross Merkel, 
its gay pastor. Merkel has led the 260member church for 15 years. At a 
celebration of his ordination last year, he told his parishioners he 
was in an 11-year "committed relationship with another man." Because 
the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America has a policy banning 
practicing homosexuals from being clergy, the denomination recently 
held a hearing to determine Merkel's fitness to minister. Although half 
a dozen church members testified on their pastor's behalf, the 
10-member disciplinary committee of the Sierra Pacific Synod ruled it 
had no choice but to make the "painful" but necessary decision to 
defrock Merkel. He has until March 25 to leave the parish, but members 
of St. Paul, some of whom are homosexuals who have joined since 
Merkel's coming out, say they plan to defy the denomination's order and 
keep him as their pastor, even if it means leaving the ELCA. 
...Presbyterian churches in the More Light Network planned to celebrate 
March 6 as "Coming Out Sunday." The service, based on the theme "For 
All The Saints," is an invitation to gays and lesbians to "come home to 
the church and make it a more inclusive and inviting place," according 
to Lindsay Louise Biddle, the Minneapolis minister who coordinated the 
event. The liturgy also called the PCUSA to accept homosexuals as full 
partners in ministry. The date was chosen because it was the first 
anniversary of a Rochester, N.Y., church's commissioning of Jane Spahr 
as a traveling lesbian evangelist (NIRR 6/28/93). 

A crowd of mourners booed demonstrators and pelted them with eggs and 
fruit, ending Kansas pastor Fred Phelps' attempt to protest the funeral 
of gay journalist Randy Shilts. Phelps, who leads Topeka's Westboro 
Baptist Church (NIRR 10/18/93), said he and others would picket the 
Feb. 22 service for the San Francisco Chronicle reporter and prominent 
AIDS author, who died of the disease at age 42. "Someone needs to say 
he's not a hero," said Phelps, who claims news media glorify 
homosexuals who die of AIDS. About 50 riot-geared police officers set 
up barricades to separate the protesters from the mourners and to 
prevent violence. Phelps and a dozen supporters arrived shortly after 
the 1 p.m. service began at San Francisco's Glide Memorial Church. Some 
carried signs reading "Shilts in Hell" and "No Fags In Heaven," 
according to news reports. But several hundred mourners who could not 
fit inside the church's sanctuary chanted loudly and some hurled things 
at Phelps and his group, who left under police escort within minutes of 
arriving. Inside the church, news of their departure was met with a 
standing ovation. 
...A California-based conservative group also decried Phelps' actions. 
Traditional Values Coalition condemned Phelps' "caustic rhetoric." The 
group said its sympathies went out to Shilts' family and friends over 
their loss. 

Those who support campaigns to limit the rights of homosexuals "are 
gravely mistaken about the values that make our nation strong," 
President Bill Clinton wrote to the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, a 
political action committee for homosexual candidates. "The essential 
right to equality must not be denied by a ballot initiative or 
otherwise," Clinton wrote. Several gay-rights groups requested a 
presidential statement against movements in 11 states to reverse laws 
protecting homosexuals from discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation. Five days later, Clinton's letter said that it is "a 
simple principle of justice" that all people be judged solely on their 
merits. 

The Christian Coalition and Planned Parenthood have launched rival 
media blitzes over the Clinton administration's health-care plan. 
Christian Coalition announced plans to spend $1.4 million to inform 
Americans of what it says are dangers of the plan: price controls, 
employer mandates, and abortion coverage. The CC will target 
evangelical and Catholic churches, asking parishioners to forward 
postcards to their congressional representative and senators. In 
addition, the group plans TV, radio, and newspaper ads, and five 
regional forums. 
...Days after the CC announced its campaign, Planned Parenthood 
revealed a similar media strategy to encourage support for the Clinton 
plan. Its $10-million public education-lobbying operation will focus on 
the needs for universal coverage and comprehensive reproductive health 
care, including abortion. The group said other health-care plans would 
result in more teen pregnancies, unwanted births, poverty, and sexually 
transmitted diseases. 
..."Christians of a broader spirit are deeply offended" by the 
Christian Coalition campaign, a National Council of Churches statement 
says. The NCC's one-page pastoral message indicates that Christians 
hold many political and ideological views, and that the CC should not 
imply that its position is the only Christian view. The NCC comprises 
32 Protestant and Orthodox denominations, and is considered the leading 
U.S. ecumenical group. The Protestant Health Alliance, speaking for its 
more than 200 religious health-care providers, agreed with the NCC 
position. The PHA does not back any specific proposal to date, but 
seeks a comprehensive reform "based on ethical values and principles" 
to remedy the "moral injustices" of the current system. 

Pennsylvania's abortion restrictions will take effect March 20, some 
five years after they were first voted into law. The measure will 
require women considering abortion to view photographs or drawings of 
fetal development at 18 stages of the pregnancy. The information 
includes a comprehensive list of agencies in each county that offer 
alternatives to abortion. Women then must wait 24 hours before 
undergoing the procedure. The law also requires minors to have parental 
consent, or permission from a judge in certain cases. (Federal courts 
earlier struck down the provision that would have required spousal 
notification. Abortion clinics and the state compromised last month to 
remove a requirement to submit all their abortion counseling materials 
to the Pennsylvania Bulletin, the state's legal publication of record. 
Abortion providers say they are willing to comply with the compromise 
provisions, but will continue legal challenges to the law. 

England will allow foreigners to have RU-486-induced abortions if they 
follow strict conditions. Until recently, British law forbade 
dispensing the abortion pill to non-residents, but the Health 
Department said it will not prosecute women who meet the requirements. 
Women who wish to end their pregnancies with the drug must travel to 
England, stay overnight at London's Marie Stopes Health Clinic, and pay 
$500. They must get approval from two doctors at the clinic, and inform 
their regular physician of their plans. Before the abortion, they must 
prove they are less than nine weeks pregnant, and must agree to return 
for a follow-up visit one week after the abortion, news sources 
reported. The clinic, which has used RU-486 since 1991, estimates it 
uses the drug for 6% of its 22,000 abortions annually. American 
abortion-rights groups have said they will refer patients to the London 
clinic. Vatican officials said using the drug or similar "day-after" 
pills means automatic excommunication from the Roman Catholic Church. 

A Norwegian abortion foe has linked return of the stolen painting The 
Scream to airing of the graphic abortion film The Silent Scream on 
state TV. The country's most valuable work of art, painted by artist 
Edvard Munch, was taken from Oslo's National Gallery on Feb. 12. Borre 
Knudsen, a dismissed state Lutheran minister who has protested Norway's 
policy of providing state-paid abortions through the 12th week of 
pregnancy, said in a radio interview that the 1893 painting "would 
emerge again" if NRK state television aired the film, which shows a 
12-week-old fetus being aborted. NRK TV spokesmen told reporters they 
have received no demands to show the film, nor would they show it. News 
reports indicated that, during the interview, Knudsen carefully avoided 
responsibility for the theft and first-hand knowledge of who had the 
painting. But, he said, "We have sent a signal." 
...The thieves also may have sent an earlier warning signal. Two days 
before the robbery, a radio station received an anonymous fax featuring 
The Scream, which Norwegian pro-lifers have used to symbolize the 
emotional turmoil of abortion. The fax pictured a woman's fist 
squeezing a crying fetus. The text read, "Which is of greater value: a 
child or a painting?" Police are continuing their investigations, but 
have made no arrests. 
..."This is the first time in the history of Norway that someone has 
been denied entry on the basis of religion and belief," said Gordon 
Peterson, one of 12 American pro-life activists turned away at Oslo's 
Fornebu airport. News reports indicated that police officials feared 
the protesters, invited by "radical" Norwegian abortion opponents, 
might disrupt Olympic opening ceremonies. When police found pro-life 
pamphlets and banners in the Americans' luggage, they confiscated the 
materials and evicted the travelers on suspicion of "planning to commit 
criminal offenses." Peterson, pastor of Calvary Temple near 
Minneapolis, told Religious News Service that Norwegian police 
indicated the Federal Bureau of Investigation had provided them with a 
list of abortion opponents. The Norwegian Embassy in Washington 
confirmed an information exchange between the two countries. 

Organizers of the Winter Olympics gave $1 million for religious work 
during the games. The money, contributed to the Lillehammer Outreach 
Committee, was used for ministry by local congregations of the State 
Lutheran, Greek Orthodox, and Pentecostal churches. "This was a 
breakthrough for churches here," Lowrie McCown, executive director of 
International Sports Coalition, told NIRR. In Lillehammer, churches 
hosted gospel concerts, and pastors from various countries served as 
official chaplains in the Olympic village, where they staffed "quiet" 
chapels. The Outreach Committee also worked with the Norwegian Bible 
Society to produce a Lillehammer '94 souvenir New Testament and hymnal 
for the athletes. McCown and his team of five from Quest Atlanta '96 
were taking notes and preparing strategies for the upcoming Summer 
Olympics. 
...The games provided so many opportunities that one minister compared 
it to Pentecost, when so much of the world came together with a unique 
opportunity for ministry. Baptist missionaries and local churches in 
the area, along with two missionaries from Japan and Spain, worked as 
interpreters, witnessed, and helped with worship, Bill Peacock of 
Southern Baptist Foreign Mission Board told NIRR. The FMB teamed with 
Action Discipleship Ministries of Georgia, a ministry to high school 
and professional athletes. ADM president David Guinn organized the 
16-member team. The eight U.S. and eight international pastors served 
as interpreters or chaplains in the Olympic village. Team member Fred 
Dallas faxed daily progress reports to the Action Ministries Fax 
Network, which relayed the information to home churches, campus 
ministries, newspapers, and bookstores in five states. The ADM team 
joined the European Baptist Mission, and received official credentials 
from the Lillehammer Olympic Committee, unlike past Olympics. Six 
hundred Norwegian Christians were joined by 200 Christians from other 
parts of the world for a three-week Youth With A Mission outreach. Some 
75 people made commitments to Christ through gospel dramas and 
evangelism among crowds at the three Olympic sites, and two missions 
conferences have been planned in response to the enthusiasm of the 
participants. 

An army of 12,000 lay missionaries may evangelize troubled cities in 
the United States. Leaders of the CoMission, the massive ministry to 
the former Soviet Union (NIRR 2/8/93), are formulating a strategy to 
redirect the skills, energy, and enthusiasm of the group's short-term 
volunteers when they return to America. Initial plans for an American 
CoMission call for up to a dozen mission and parachurch agencies to 
train returning lay missionaries for ministry in several American 
cities. The CoMission's five-year work in the former Soviet Union ends 
in late 1997. 
..."We've been asking ourselves, would God initiate something like the 
CoMission for us in the same way he has for Russia?" Terry Taylor, U.S. 
director of the Navigators, told NIRR. Taylor, who also chairs the 
CoMission's training and materials committee, said the new American 
missions movement could be as effective as the CoMission if the 
"supernatural fingerprint of the Holy Spirit is on every aspect." The 
idea for a home-missions initiative sprang from prayer spearheaded by a 
number of leaders, including Joe Aldrich of Northwest Renewal 
Ministries and David Bryant of Concerts of Prayer. At a three-day 
Lausanne prayer summit attended by 300 pastors last fall (NIRR 9/6/93), 
pastors were extremely open and honest in their discussions with each 
other, Taylor said. Similar prayer summits subsequently have taken 
place around the country. 
...The cooperation that has characterized the CoMission also would be a 
model for the new home-missions thrust, Taylor said. The CoMission 
began when 50 denominational and parachurch leaders began to work 
together in a way that is "absolutely remarkable," said Bruce Wilkinson 
of Walk Through the Bible, chairman of the CoMission executive 
committee. "Whenever there is a broken and humble spirit among 
leadership, it's amazing what can be accomplished," Wilkinson said. 
..."Getting the ministry out of the hands of the professionals and into 
the hands of laity" is what the CoMission is all about, Taylor said. If 
laity have been lethargic, complacent and lukewarm, "it is because they 
have not been challenged or trained to do what they've been asked to 
do." When the laity "is awakened, look out. The 12,000 lay people that 
come home may very well be the seed of revival in this country," Taylor 
said. 

"Amazing freedom exists for those who go through channels and take time 
to build relationships" in China, East Gates Ministries President Ned 
Graham told NIRR. East Gates workers have traveled legally in China for 
years, visiting with hundreds of house-church pastors, and have 
distributed 200,000 Bibles in the last 15 months -- all without any 
governmental hindrance to them or the house churches. A law signed Jan. 
31 (NIRR 2/21), which penalizes unauthorized ministry by foreigners, 
also legalizes preaching and teaching by foreigners, Graham said. The 
omission of registration requirements for house churches gives the 
churches flexibility without giving local authorities a license for 
persecution, Graham told NIRR. Nevertheless, laws in China are in 
constant flux. In some areas witnessing is tolerated, in others it is 
totally suppressed. 
...Four U.S. ministries will train Chinese pastors for registered and 
unregistered churches, according to East Gates. The Billy Graham 
Evangelistic Association, Campus Crusade for Christ, the Navigators, 
and Werner Burklin Ministries (NIRR 11/15/93) will teach theology and 
evangelism. Ned Graham offered the training to meet a need expressed by 
Bishop K. H. Ting, head of the official Three Self Patriotic Movement 
churches. House churches also need basic pastoral training and Bibles, 
and many house church leaders are willing to participate in activities 
with Three Self churches, Graham said. For the first time, the 
Religious Affairs Bureau approved in advance the number of Bibles that 
Amity Press may print for the year: 2 million, a significant increase 
over 1993. The bureau also gave its first approval to sell Bibles in 
bookstores, if the books are printed in China. 
...Money, not religious freedom, may have been a cause for the arrests 
of American Dennis Balcombe and six other foreigners in China (NIRR 
2/21). Balcombe, pastor of a Hong Kong church, told NIRR he had 
difficulty collecting an investment of several thousand dollars in the 
state-run Department Store in Fangcheng, the city where he and the 
others were arrested last month. After two collectors representing 
Balcombe failed last year to obtain his investment, Balcombe was told 
by Chinese friends there was a plot to arrest him on false charges if 
he attempted to collect personally. Balcombe doubted the rumor until 
after his unceremonious expulsion from China last month. 

Relief groups are able to work in southern Sudan only because United 
Nations troops are in neighboring Somalia, said Franklin Graham, 
president of World Medical Mission. He told NIRR that the arrival of 
U.N. forces in Somalia "scared the stuffings out of Sudan's 
government." To avoid invasion, Sudan's government opened the wartorn 
south to U.N.-sponsored relief groups, such as WMM, last year, Graham 
said. When American soldiers pull out of Somalia, Graham expects the 
Sudanese government to pressure U.N. relief workers to leave. But 
Khartoum probably would let relief workers stay if American churches 
applied pressure on Sudan through the U.S. Congress, he said. The 
majority of the people in southern Sudan are strong Christians 
oppressed by an Islamic terrorist regime in the north, exerting what 
amounts to a holy war against the church of Jesus Christ, he said. 
...War, political pressure, ministry to the sick, and evangelism have 
existed side-by-side. Despite pressure from Khartoum to stop 
evangelistic activities, WMM doctors have witnessed and done mass 
evangelism. They have organized public showings of the Jesus film, 
which have doubled the size of the church in eastern central Sudan 
along the Sobat River, Graham said. WMM's Bible distribution in Sudan 
was as inflammatory as importing guns, a relief worker said. Meanwhile, 
doctors have battled an epidemic of relapsing fever with antibiotics. 
To prevent recurrence, they also have dusted with insecticides and 
trained villagers in sanitary precautions. 

Croatian and Bosnian refugees are meeting for Bible study in 
warehouses, where they also receive food, clothing, and medicine, 
according to Agape, an evangelical relief agency based in Osijek, 
Croatia (NIRR 7/12/93). Agape operates 21 such distribution centers in 
the former Yugoslavia, and five meal-distribution centers in Croatia. 
Volunteers from local churches staff the centers, distribute Christian 
literature, and provide counseling and evangelistic follow-up. As of 
January, 530,000 people had registered with the Office for Displaced 
Persons and Refugees in Croatia. 
...Croatian schools and public libraries have been given 350,000 New 
Testaments and other Christian books in the past year, and copies of 
the Gospel of Mark are being distributed to every household in the 
larger cities in Bosnia and Croatia. A Christian radio program produced 
by Agape now is broadcast by 75% of Croatian stations, and a home for 
war orphans under two years old is being planned. 

The Anglican Church will ordain its first women priests on March 12 at 
Bristol Cathedral (NIRR 11/15/93). The Church of England Synod met to 
draft the canons necessary to change church law. Although Archbishop of 
Canterbury George Carey, the church's leading cleric, issued a broad 
appeal for unity, the meeting was disrupted several times. West London 
vicar Paul Williamson had sought a last-ditch injunction to ban women's 
ordination. His allegation that Carey and Archbishop of York John 
Habgood were guilty of treason for making "fundamental changes" to 
England's official religion was summarily rejected by a High Court 
judge as exceptionally "far-fetched." (Williamson vowed to appeal.) 
Before the Feb. 22 Synod meeting, the Anglican-Catholic group Ecclesia 
held a mock funeral for the Church of England, saying it had been 
killed by a "sinful act of apostasy." Forward in Faith, the leading 
dissident group, requested, unsuccessfully, that the Synod drop the 
ecclesiastical changes from its agenda. The group reported that seven 
bishops and more than 700 clergy will join the Catholic Church because 
of the decision. News reports indicate more than 1,200 women have 
immediate plans to enter the Anglican priesthood. 

Thousands of shocked Christians from across Iran traveled to Tehran to 
attend funeral services after the still unexplained murder of Haik 
Hovsepian-Mehr, the nation's most prominent leader (NIRR 2/7). The 
crowd not only jammed the sanctuary, but overflowed the basement and 
went out into the courtyard and street, according to one news report. 
Hovsepian was leader of the Assemblies of God churches in Iran and 
chairman of the Council of Protestant Ministers. He was also an 
outspoken critic of the increasing repression of Iranian Christians, 
and had launched an outspoken campaign to overturn the death sentence 
of fellow pastor Mehdi Dibaj. More than 2,000 mourners attended 
Hovsepian's three-hour burial service in Tehran's Christian Cemetery. 
In London, Brother Andrew of Open Doors told 1,000 people at a memorial 
service that ISLAM -- "I Sincerely Love All Muslims" -- should be the 
motto of all Christians. Hovsepian's three brothers, also pastors, gave 
messages in Persian, Armenian, and English at another memorial service 
to 1,000 people held at Church on the Way in Van Nuys, Calif. 
...The Iranian judiciary announced it is holding a suspect in the 
Hovsepian murder case. Andrew Whitley of Middle East Watch told NIRR he 
had seen neither a name for the suspect nor independent confirmation of 
the arrest, but noted that the matter was being addressed in high 
levels of Tehran's government. The impact of Hovsepian's death on the 
Iranian church remains unclear, a source said. 

Canada's House of Commons dropped Jesus Christ from the opening prayer 
it has used since 1877. The members of Parliament unanimously voted 
Feb. 18 to change the morning invocation, which some members of 
Parliament said no longer reflected the country's diverse religious 
complexion. Also deleted were outdated references to the British Empire 
and Royal Family, Religious News Service reported. The revised prayer 
offers thanks to Almighty God for blessing Canada, and requests divine 
wisdom, strength, and knowledge for the Parliament, the Governor 
General, and the Queen "to make good laws and wise decisions." 

There is an "outpouring of the Holy Spirit" in Toronto, according to 
ministers of the Vineyard Christian Fellowship. What started as weekend 
services for 120 people on Jan. 28 has grown for weeks into a nightly 
influx of 3,000 people at meetings in six locations, according to Randy 
Clark, the St. Louis VCF pastor whose ministry lit the fires. Clark, 
who said he does not consider himself a particularly successful pastor, 
told NIRR that events in Toronto are "not a Vineyard thing, not of man, 
but of God's kingdom." Pastors and prodigals alike are being drawn to 
the "blessings of the peace of God," he said. Physical healings and 
15-30 commitments to Christ nightly, mostly rededications, have been 
reported by John Arnott, pastor of the VCF church in which the Toronto 
phenomenon began. Hundreds of adults and children have been "falling 
out in the Spirit." Meetings, which last into the early hours of the 
morning, are characterized by laughing, joy, shaking, and dancing, 
witnesses said. 
...Pastors from other denominations are coming to learn more. On Feb. 
23, some 200 leaders from Alliance, Nazarene, Anglican, United, and 
Pentecostal churches met to hear VCF pastors describe the events, 
Arnott's assistant, Carol Low, told NIRR. As word of the phenomenon 
spread, eager and skeptical people came from across Canada and the 
United States, Clark said. After participating, some pastors reported 
similar outbreaks upon returning home to Montreal, Quebec City, Ft. 
Wayne, New Orleans, Quincy, Ill., and Southern California. Onlookers 
have included Christian academics Clark Pinnock, John White, and Guy 
Chevreau; a gang member who accepted Christ and brings his friends; and 
foreign residents of Toronto, according to Clark. 

The National Conference on Prayer and Spiritual Warfare drew more than 
1,000 ministry leaders, mission executives, and lay persons to Anaheim, 
Calif., Feb. 21-23. "We have gathered here to talk about war," author 
George Otis Jr. declared. The conference, sponsored by AD 2000-United 
Prayer Track, Spiritual Warfare Network, and INJOY, emphasized 
mobilization of intercessory prayer for people groups resistant to the 
gospel, as well as understanding spiritual strongholds that fortify 
that resistance. Attention was given to "identificational repentance" 
-a process whereby long-standing spiritual wounds between people groups 
are addressed as a prelude to evangelism. 
...Plenary speakers included Fuller Seminary Professor C. Peter Wagner, 
Edgardo Silvoso of Harvest Evangelism, River of Life Ministries' 
Francis Frangipane, and Cindy Jacobs of Generals of Intercession. With 
the stated goal of "hearing what the Spirit is saying to churches 
today," the conferees recognized a need for urgency. Dick Eastman of 
Every Home for Christ reminded the delegates that if current trends 
continue "more people will have come to Christ during the last decade 
of this century than in all of recorded history." 
...Recognizing the controversial aspect of "strategic level spiritual 
warfare" (a term popularized by Wagner) Tom White of Frontline 
Ministries urged conferees to maintain a biblical foundation for 
spiritual warfare, as well as humble dependence on God. "I do not 
personally find sufficient scriptural evidence to support direct 
confrontation against principalities and powers. Our job is to do the 
exposing. God does the disposing," he said. 

C-Net, a worldwide, electronic bulletin board network for Christians, 
is finding backers. No such project has inspired support from as broad 
a spectrum of evangelical foundations, according to C-Net supervisor 
Bill Thatcher, director of Seattle-based International Christian Media 
Commission. C-Net will not be dominated by the religious right, but 
will include an evangelical community that is more ecumenical, like 
that of Europe, he told NIRR. C-Net's global conferencing is an 
economical alternative to international travel, Thatcher said. When a 
natural disaster or socio-political crisis occurs, churches and 
Christian organizations around the world can organize quickly, he said. 
The service, which began a year ago, is accessible by dialing local 
telephone numbers in 90 countries. A program that allows readers to 
download and then view documents off-line may be available by late 
summer, and transmission of audio and video by next year, he said. 
(C-Net's phone number is 206-781-0461.) 
...Critics say C-Net may not be practical for agencies concerned about 
confidentiality. C-Net functions in conjunction with 12 major and 30 
minor computers managed by the Association of Progressive Communication 
and the Institute of Global Communication, groups that some 
conservative critics consider allies of extreme liberal causes. No 
electronic communication network enjoys absolute security, Thatcher 
concedes, but that is because government intelligence agencies screen 
international transmissions. ICMC, an international, non-profit 
organization of Christian media professionals, insists that C-Net is 
secure, since operators use a password. media professionals, insists 
that C-Net is secure, since operators use a password.

Vol. 8, No. 5                                        February 21, 1994 

China is increasing restrictions on religious activity among foreign 
visitors and its citizens, the official press agency, Xinhua, reported. 
Premier Li Peng signed decrees into law Jan. 31 forbidding foreigners 
from proselytizing or "establishing religious organizations, organs for 
managing religious affairs, or centers or schools for religious 
activities." Foreigners may continue to conduct their own private 
worship services. Another law bans house churches not registered under 
the Protestant and Catholic associations officially recognized by the 
government. It was not clear how the new law restricting house churches 
differs from previous policies, under which independent house churches 
were branded illegal and their leaders subjected to fines and jail 
sentences. 
...Laws also limit what can be done inside registered churches, and ban 
sermons that "disturb the public order," news accounts said.  Analysts 
in Washington expressed surprise at the decrees, coming at a time when 
the Communist-ruled country's favored-trade status and human-rights 
record are under review (NIRR 2/7). 
...Chinese Public Security Bureau officers arrested seven foreigners 
(including three Americans), and seven Chinese house-church members in 
the middle of the night Feb. 10 for "illegal religious activities," 
news reports said. The foreigners were released after five days, but 
three of the Chinese still were being held. One of those released, 
Dennis Balcombe, American pastor of Hong Kong's Revival Christian 
Church, was deported, but may sue police for robbing him of $12,500 and 
electronic equipment, and refusing to let him contact the U.S. Embassy. 

New opportunities for ministry in Vietnam could result from President 
Clinton's Feb. 3 lifting of the decades-old trade embargo against the 
country, according to Robin Shell, vice president of Food for the 
Hungry. There is a strong spiritual longing in Vietnam, and many people 
desire reconciliation with God, Shell said after a trip to the Hong Ngu 
district to meet government and church leaders. One church more than 
doubled in size in the past year, Shell said. 
...Vietnam would like to follow China's example in controlling church 
activity, according to Cliff Westergren, director of overseas 
ministries for the Christian and Missionary Alliance denomination. 
Vietnam is moving toward a free-market economy, but, like China, wants 
to regulate the church, Westergren told NIRR. Reopening trade with the 
United States will likely lead to re-establishment of diplomatic 
relations and improvement of ministry groups' access to visas and work 
in the country, he said. 
...Assemblies of God churches in Vietnam are growing at a tremendous 
rate even though they are subject to suspicion and persecution, and are 
denied official recognition by the government, Robert Houlihan, the 
group's U.S. director of Asia Pacific Missions, told NIRR. Ironically, 
Hanoi has granted legal status to AG relief and development workers but 
not to their Vietnamese AG colleagues. They jointly provide three 
children's homes, two drug rehabilitation centers, and three medical 
clinics (NIRR 6/14/93). Very little Christian ministry exists for women 
in Vietnam, according to a report from the Women's Track of AD2000 and 
Beyond. 

Civil war and persecution have spurred revival in southern Sudan, 
according to Susan Bergman DeVries writing for Pulse. During 10 years 
of atrocities in the East African country, one Anglican diocese of 
"nine stagnant churches" burgeoned into 300 congregations, many with 
more than 500 members. Quoting from denominational educators working 
there, DeVries said new Christian converts from animism "seem to have a 
near tangible sense of the presence of God and his power to protect." 
One Presbyterian pastor baptized 9,000 last year. In refugee camps, 
where churches have sprung up, people create art depicting biblical 
deliverance stories. More than 2,000 indigenous hymns have been 
composed, according to the Pulse report. 
...Islam is considered to be an enslaving religion in southern Sudan 
because the Islamic government in the north is bent on destroying the 
black African culture of the south, DeVries said. The shape of the 
cross has taken on new significance, gaining wider use in church 
buildings, church workers' clothing, and in processionals to and from 
services. International relief workers left southern Sudan this month 
as an offensive by government troops and planes battered the Sudan 
People's Liberation Army in the south. Fighting drove 110,000 civilians 
toward the Uganda border, according to news reports. The United 
Nations' Operation Lifeline Sudan and UNICEF evacuated foreign staff. 

This is the golden age of the church in Cuba, according to Albert 
Ehmann of WorldTeam Canada. Churches are growing quickly, many 
believers are young and enthusiastic, and extraordinary cooperation 
exists among Christians, he said. Training and materials are in short 
supply, Ehmann said. The Bible has become the best seller in Cuba, and 
the government has requested 100,000 Bibles per year for the next five 
years to sell in its 236 government-operated bookstores, he said. 
Communist officials want speakers to present a Christian perspective on 
morals and ethics, he said. House churches also are reportedly 
flourishing in Cuba. 
...A peace group has vowed to send aid to Cuba despite an official 
embargo and U.S. government orders. Minneapolis-based Pastors for Peace 
opposes the embargo. The activist group plans to collect medical and 
school supplies, bicycles, powdered milk, and carpentry tools this 
month in a dozen Canadian and northern U.S. cities. They plan to take 
the goods to Laredo, Texas, and transport them into Mexico for shipment 
to Cuba, news reports said. 
...The White House is reviewing the embargo on travel to Cuba (NIRR 
5/31/93). The system of granting permission to travel there often is 
arbitrary and possibly unconstitutional, analysts said. Certain 
categories of people are excepted from the embargo, including 
journalists, scholars, and those with close relatives on the island. An 
amendment to the State Department authorization bill, being considered 
by the Senate, asks the President to allow travel to Cuba for 
humanitarian, religious, or educational reasons or for public 
performances or exhibitions. 

American missionaries nationwide were victims of a medical insurance 
scam that left their claims unpaid, prosecutors said. Paul Gelatt and 
sons Gary and Mark, all of San Antonio, Texas, were indicted by a 
Travis County, Texas, grand jury for running the unlicensed 
International Benefits Association Insurance Co., prosecutors say. 
...The number of missionaries involved is not yet known, but the 
company failed to pay a total of $800,000 in claims, a spokesman for 
the Texas Department of Insurance's fraud unit told NIRR. Sponsoring 
churches often had to pick up the tab, but no missionaries were driven 
into bankruptcy by unpaid bills, said Richard Chowning, 
missionaryin-residence at Abilene Christian University in Abilene. At 
least 50 Church of Christ missionaries were victims of the alleged 
scam, Chowning said. 
...Brochures and pamphlets were used in soliciting insurance premiums 
from missionaries, said Mark Lane, assistant district attorney with the 
Travis County District Attorney's office. Mailings also were sent to 
missionary departments of colleges and other institutions, news reports 
said. 

Some 85% of the 1.8 billion children in the world live in developing 
countries and 78% are growing up in nonChristian settings, according a 
study by researcher Bryant Myers in World Mission magazine. Other 
statistics: every day 40,000 children under the age of five die; half 
of the world's 36 million refugees and displaced people are children, 
and many of these children are unwanted, exploited and uneducated; 
girls usually are significantly worse off than boys, and often die 
younger. The report is important for missionaries, because most people 
who become Christians do so between the ages of four and 14. 

Last year, portions of the Bible were translated into 44 more 
languages, bringing the total to 2,062, reports the London-based United 
Bible Societies. About 80% of the world's people have access to at 
least a portion of scripture in a language they can understand, if not 
their native tongue, UBS spokesmen indicated. Some 337 of the world's 
approximately 6,000 languages have translations of the complete Bible, 
and the New Testament is available in another 799. Smaller portions of 
the Bible are available in an additional 926 languages. 

Four out of 10 people who call themselves evangelicals don't believe 
there is such a thing as absolute truth, according to a Barna Research 
Group poll. "That's the heart of the problem we're struggling with," 
George Barna told NIRR. "Think about the implications for evangelism, 
personal spiritual growth, and having a church that really is the salt 
and the light. It's pretty frightening," he said. Of all U.S. adults, 
71% say there is no such thing as absolute truth. 

Churches must adapt their methods to societal changes, focus more on 
results, emphasize lay training, and cooperate with one another to 
survive into the next century, said Gordon MacDonald, senior pastor of 
the 3,000member Grace Chapel in Lexington, Mass., New England's largest 
evangelical church. MacDonald spoke at the Evangelistic Association of 
New England's 34th annual Congress, Feb. 4-5 in Boston. More than 6,000 
people from 750 churches in 30 denominations attended. Popular authors 
addressing the theme of "A Future and a Hope," included Eastern 
College's Tony Campolo, San Antonio pastor Max Lucado, and Stephen 
Arterburn, chairman of the Southern California-based New Life Treatment 
Centers. 
..."Ministry in the future is going to have to be results-based," 
MacDonald said. "We have to change because the times demand it. . . 
Change will happen whether we want it to or not," he also said. 
Churches of different denominations in the same community may have to 
"align, not merge" some of their programs. With stretched budgets and 
stressed personnel, as many as 30 churches could sponsor a single youth 
ministry, MacDonald said. Denominationalism, he said, "is probably 
dead." Training lay leaders and organizing their ministries will become 
the most important aspects of church life in the next decade -- more 
important than preaching because preaching is "an importable 
commodity." 

"Religious Leadership in Secular Society," a conference on modern 
social and scientific challenges, drew 700 Jewish and Christian leaders 
and scholars from 90 countries to Jerusalem Feb. 1-4. Heads of 50 
national religious bodies were present, including those from Catholic, 
Anglican, Reform, Coptic and Eastern Orthodox churches. 
...Workshops featured experts in fields such as genetic engineering, 
religious education in pluralistic societies, the family, quality and 
quantity of life, and the search for spirituality in the modern world. 
Genetic engineering offers the "temptation to play God a little," said 
Archbishop Maxim Hermauik of Winnipeg, Manitoba. 
...Theological differences were downplayed in the face of greater 
challenges of secularism and nihilism strengthening their grip on 
society. However, Rev. George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury, urged 
participants to resist the outlook that all faiths are descriptive of 
One Reality, since doing so would imply that religions should give up 
their attempts to convert people of other cultures and religions. 
...Plenary speakers in addition to Carey included Cardinal Joseph 
Ratzinger of the Vatican, Chief Rabbi Cyril Harris of South Africa, and 
Professor Marvin Wilson of Gordon College. Wilson, the most prominent 
evangelical participant, made a plea for a new relationship between 
Christians and Jews. The church needs to better appreciate its Hebraic 
heritage and foundation, Wilson said, noting that Gentile believers 
have been "grafted into Israel," according to Romans 11:17. Wilson 
stated that the "dejudaization of the church" and ignorance of its 
Jewish roots was partially responsible for the Holocaust. He called for 
churches to re-evaluate what they teach about Judaism. 

Dismissal of a $10 million lawsuit against the Church of Scientology is 
a victory for religious freedom, Scientologists said. The New York 
State Supreme Court dismissed Jo Ann Scrivano's suit against the Long 
Island Church of Scientology. In 1987, she voluntarily participated in 
Dianetics auditing, a form of personal counseling common in 
Scientology. Soon after, she sued the church and three leaders for 
malpractice, fraud, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
This month, the court ruled that auditing is a "central practice" of 
the Los Angeles-based religion. As a rite of "a bonafide religious 
sect," (as the Internal Revenue Service ruled last year), it warrants 
First Amendment immunity, the judge said. The decision shows that 
courts realize they must not evaluate the merits of religious beliefs 
and practices without a compelling state interest to do so, Scientology 
attorney Michael Hertzberg said. 
...The Church of Spiritual Technology, a spinoff of the Church of 
Scientology, spent $13 million to build elaborate archives in 
Trementina, N.M., Petrolia and Crestline, Calif., to preserve the words 
of the church's founder, L. Ron Hubbard, for a millennium, IRS records 
show. Hubbard died in 1986. 

It's time for psychiatrists to take a patient's religious experience 
more seriously. That is the message contained in the upcoming edition 
of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, a reference guide for mental health 
professionals. It will include a new entry titled "Religious or 
Spiritual Problems." By recognizing religious problems as a category of 
concern distinct from any mental disorder, the revision reflects 
psychiatry's steady movement away from a tendency to treat religion as 
a delusion or as evidence of immaturity, escapism, or neurosis, 
according to New York Times religion writer Peter Steinfels. 
...The kinds of religious or spiritual problems that may lead people to 
seek help "include distressing experiences that involve loss or 
questioning of faith, problems associated with conversion to a new 
faith, or questioning of other spiritual values," according to the new 
manual. 

Chaplain Garland Robertson was drummed out of the U.S. Air Force nearly 
three years after questioning use of force against Iraq in the Gulf 
War. Robertson expressed his ethical reservations in a letter to the 
editor of the Abilene Reporter-News two weeks before the start of the 
war. The letter was met with angry telephone calls from base commanders 
and retired people at Abilene's Dyess Air Force Base. Robertson clashed 
with superiors and other chaplains, and was forced to undergo 
psychological examinations. Finally, an Air Force board of inquiry 
expelled Robertson from the service, granting him an honorable 
discharge but saying he had exhibited poor leadership. 
...The case illustrates the tension between military chaplains' duties 
to the church and their commander-inchief. Robertson, a member of the 
Baptist Peace Fellowship of North America, persisted in raising 
questions about the Gulf War after his commander told him to keep 
quiet. At stake is not only health benefits and a $29,000 annual 
military pension, but also the right of military chaplains to raise 
ethical concerns that conflict with national policy, Robertson told 
NIRR. A ruling in Robertson's appeal to the Secretary of the Air Force 
is due by April. 

Armed Forces Radio and Television Service's only radio programming 
block for religious teaching, aired on Sundays, has been cut. Because 
about 70% of AFRTS's radio audience is between the ages of 17 and 26, 
and surveys of military personnel showed a decided preference for 
music, Chaplain David Smith, who coordinates AFRTS's faithbased 
formatting, revamped the programming in April. The bulk of the 
religious radio broadcasts now consists of "contemporary mainstream" 
music (most of it Christian), with some interfaith feature programs. 
Smith told NIRR his responsibility is to best serve the needs of a 
majority of listeners (NIRR 7/13/92). 
...Bible study and teaching proved to be "poor programming choices" 
because the segment of the audience most likely to tune in was 
attending chapel services when the programs would air, Smith said. For 
that reason, programs such as Charles Stanley's In Touch, Billy 
Graham's Hour of Decision, and the Salvation Army's Wonderful Words of 
Life were dropped from the schedule. Smith said that since the programs 
were removed he received no complaints from listeners or chaplains. 
AFRTS's reduced hours and more mainstream trend have raised concerns 
among National Religious Broadcasters and representatives of the 
evangelistic programs that were dropped. The removal of preaching and 
teaching programs has "significant ramifications" for religious freedom 
and access for U.S. servicepeople, a spokesperson for the Salvation 
Army program told NIRR. 

A radio "shock jock" in Atlanta who made regular, hateful diatribes 
against Christians has professed belief in Christ. David Paul Staves, 
known to hundreds of thousands of late-night and afternoon listeners 
over WSB-AM in Atlanta as David Paul, gained top ratings by being 
outrageous, including bringing in dancers to strip in front of him 
while he described their action on the radio. Staves also would advise 
young people to steal from the church offering plate, and to sue their 
parents if they forced them to go to church, according to Baptist 
Press. 
..."I used to say that the only time I would enter a church was to blow 
it up," Staves told a Macon, Ga., evangelism conference. Staves was 
converted after leaving the station in a contract dispute. He took a 
job as a car salesman and was impressed by the quiet witness of a 
fellow salesman. 

Figure skater Tonya Harding's Feb. 13 profession of faith was 
"extremely authentic," pastor Gary Henecke told NIRR. The day after she 
was cleared to skate in the Winter Olympics, Harding went forward 
during the invitation at First Church of the Nazarene in Portland, Ore. 
Henecke left the pulpit and walked to the altar with Harding and her 
roommate, Stephanie Quintero. Then Harding and Henecke knelt, held 
hands, and the pastor led Harding in a prayer of salvation. "Now you 
are not only skating for America, but you are skating for Christ," 
Henecke told her. 
...Harding was "broken" and crying, Henecke said. Harding's profession 
could have been insincere, "but I have been pastoring for almost 30 
years, and I got no feeling of staging," Henecke told NIRR. Henecke 
said that previously he had not met Harding and that she had not 
attended his church. 
...Oregon pastor Eugene Saunders helped authorities break the Nancy 
Kerrigan clubbing case by alerting officials after he overheard Shawn 
Eckardt, Harding's bodyguard, bragging about how he coordinated the 
attack on Kerrigan at a Detroit ice-skating rink. Saunders told 
reporters that church members supported him for his part in "making 
sure that justice is going to be done." 

Pastor-television evangelist Robert Tilton's constitutional right to 
freedom of association was violated by a Texas district judge's order 
to turn over church documents, the Texas Supreme Court ruled. Attorneys 
for plaintiff Norma Smith said that they were entitled to see records, 
membership rolls, and financial assessments of Tilton's Word of Faith 
World Outreach Center Church, located outside Dallas. Smith's lawsuit 
accuses Tilton of intentionally inflicting emotional distress after the 
death of her husband, Tommye, a former supporter. The court said Judge 
Eric Moye was incorrect to rule that Smith was entitled to see the 
documents as part of the legal discovery process. Last summer, the 
ministry turned over more than 8 million documents to Smith's attorneys 
while appealing the order. 
...Tilton was less successful with a case before the U.S. Supreme Court 
last month, in which the justices ruled that lower courts were correct 
to dismiss his 1992 federal slander suit against six men. Tilton 
alleged that four lawyers and two members of the Trinity Foundation, a 
church-monitoring group in Dallas, made slanderous state-ments to news 
media (including ABC's PrimeTime Live), filed frivolous lawsuits 
against him, and pressured the Texas attorney general to investigate 
him. Tilton said their actions led many followers to consider him a 
fraud. The defendants claimed they were protected by the free-speech 
provision of the First Amendment. 

ABC News hired Peggy Wehmeyer as network television's first 
correspondent reporting on religion full time. Wehmeyer covered 
religion and social issues for 10 years on WFAA-TV, ABC's Dallas 
affiliate, and was an information director at Dallas Theological 
Seminary, where she also studied. Wehmeyer will report for World News 
Tonight and possibly for one of ABC's weekly news magazines. 

Religious conservatives who write letters to entertainment industry 
executives typically are uninformed and their input is ignored, 
Blockbuster Video CEO Wayne Huizenga told an audience at Calvin 
College's annual lecture series. Studio executives listen to informed 
criticism, said Huizenga, who grew up in a Dutch Calvinist church in 
Chicago and attended Calvin College in the '50s. Former U.S. surgeon 
general C. Everett Koop, author Os Guinness, Fuller Seminary President 
Richard Mouw, and columnist David Broder were among other speakers 
during the Grand Rapids, Mich., school's month-long series. 

Mother Teresa injected a controversial note into the annual National 
Prayer Breakfast Feb 3. With President Bill Clinton and his wife, 
Hillary, seated to her right, the diminutive, 83-year-old Catholic nun 
condemned abortion as "the greatest destroyer of peace today . . . 
because Jesus said, `If you receive a little child, you receive me.' So 
every abortion is the denial of receiving Jesus, the neglect of 
receiving Jesus." Most of the more than 3,000 listeners, many of them 
influential American leaders, interrupted her with sustained ovations. 
She also spoke about contraception, prayer, love, and care of the old 
and the poor during her 33-minute speech. 
...The President followed Mother Teresa to the microphone and commended 
her for a lifetime commitment to helping the needy. He reminded his 
audience that "we have come here to pray for those in authority." 
Clinton also cautioned that although America is a land where there is 
freedom of religion, its people should not be seeking freedom from 
religion, a comment that prompted enthusiastic response. 
...Clinton called for humility, honesty, and fairness, and a 
relinquishment of bitterness and resentment. Doing this, he said, "will 
permit us to focus on helping others." Analysts suggested that the 
President, distressed by opponents' barbs, scrutiny of his private life 
in the mass media, and seeming rejection by many Christians, was 
appealing for a greater degree of personal acceptance. 

Mother Teresa filed a friend of the court brief at the U.S. Supreme 
Court in an unusual abortion case. The brief supports the case of 
Alexander Loce, a New Jersey man who tried to prevent the abortion of a 
fetus he fathered, and who says civil rights begin at conception, news 
reports said. 

"I would never, never, never, never, never mean to say" that NARAL 
thinks "abortion is a bad thing," said Kate Michelman, president of the 
National Abortion Rights Action League. After the Philadelphia Inquirer 
quoted her as saying that "we think abortion is a bad thing. No woman 
wants to have an abortion," Michelman insisted she was misquoted -- 
until she found the reporter had a tape recording of their December 
interview. The front-page Inquirer article also made clear NARAL's 
broadened mission to uphold reproductive rights, its emphasis on 
preventing teen pregnancy, and its encouragement of abstinence. The 
NARAL president said her comments should be interpreted in context with 
the group's position that the high number of abortions in America 
"represents a failure of [social] policy" to prevent women from facing 
the dilemma. 

Planned Parenthood forced three San Diego-area crisis pregnancy centers 
to change their advertising policies. The centers were defended by The 
Rutherford Institute in a lawsuit that charged them with deception. 
Both sides claimed victory in an out-of-court settlement, under which 
the centers agreed not to advertise under the headings of "abortion 
services," "clinics," or "birth-control providers," and to add the 
phrase "offering alternatives to abortion" to their publicity, 
according to news accounts. A fourth center is fighting the suit. 

Jack Kevorkian enlisted the help of parishioners at a Michigan church 
service to secure a constitutional right to choose death. Late last 
month the retired pathologist addressed about 700 congregants at St. 
Paul's Presbyterian Church in Livonia, urging them to assist with 
gathering the 250,000 signatures required to put an amendment measure 
on the November ballot. Most of the congregants applauded Kevorkian's 
call for legalizing physician-assisted suicide. Pastor Thomas 
Egglebeen, a death-with-dignity advocate, said scriptures report six or 
seven suicides, and "in no way at all is the person condemned." Two 
people, holding Bibles aloft, interrupted Kevorkian's address, claiming 
that St. Paul's had been cursed by his visit. Michigan has charged 
Kevorkian four times since enacting a law against assisted suicide. 
News accounts indicate Kevorkian has attended 20 deaths since 1990. 

They called it womb-robbing of the unborn, and about 50 members of 
Britain's Parliament joined with clergy and physicians to stop the 
practice. Because female fetuses carry millions of eggs, they have been 
seen by some as a source of donor eggs. By harvesting the eggs and 
maturing them in a laboratory, researchers could later fertilize the 
eggs and implant them in infertile women's wombs. Researchers in South 
Korea already have conceived a test-tube baby from an egg taken from a 
dead woman, according to news sources. 
...The legislators especially are concerned about fetal egg harvesting 
undertaken at Scotland's Edinburgh University, where the procedure was 
successful with mice. Public and government outcry stopped research on 
the project, and Britain's Human Fertilization and Embryonic Authority 
has begun a six-month investigation. Researchers say they could perfect 
the technology within several years. 

A group home in Seattle for people with AIDS will be the first such 
facility in the Northwest operated by an evangelical Christian 
organization. CRISTA Ministries, a prominent evangelical Christian 
service organization, plans to establish the home, which would serve 
six to 12 people at a time, the majority of whom would be gay men. The 
facility would provide food, transportation, physical therapy, and 
counseling to its residents, CRISTA officials said. 
...Some mainline religious groups in Seattle already have established 
group homes for people living with AIDS. The Multifaith AIDS Project 
has two group homes and is looking to start a third.  University 
Unitarian Church operates DeWolfe House. The Catholic Archdiocese 
contributed $100,000 to the development of Bailey Boushay House, a 
nonsectarian nursing home and adult day program for people with AIDS. 

A conference on "healing" homosexuality was held at National 
Presbyterian Church in Washington, D.C., making it one of few 
congregations in the nation willing to endorse the controversial 
Transformation Ex-Gay Ministries (NIRR 5/3/93). Opening a church to 
groups that meet to overcome homosexual orientation and lifestyle by 
education, prayer, and peer-group support has been slow to gain 
acceptance. The group, which coordinated the conference, teaches that 
homosexuality arises from a failed childhood bonding with a same-sex 
parent, followed by gender-identity confusion that may lead to 
same-sexual abuse to fulfill a need for intimacy. 
..."If you walk into a Christian function and say, `I'm a recovering 
homosexual,' they would clear the room," Falzarano told The Washington 
Times. Conservative churches are embarrassed to have homosexuals on 
their property, and liberal churches fear protests from homosexual 
activists, Falzarano said. 

The U.S. Senate said no to NAMBLA and other groups that encourage 
pedophilia. In a unanimous vote, the senators agreed to cut U.S. 
contributions to the United Nations by $119 million unless it ends its 
ties with groups that condone sex between adults and children. The 
1,000-member North American Man-Boy Love Association is a member of the 
Brussels-based International Lesbian and Gay Association, a group which 
the U.N. recently granted consultative status. The amendment approved 
by the Senate was offered by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.). 
...There may be a wholesale change of tactics and outlook in the gay 
rights movement. Homosexual-rights groups have long supported sexual 
outcasts, but now are trying to distance themselves from pedophiles, 
observers say. Pedophiles "are not welcome in the family of gay men and 
lesbians who live upstanding and honorable lives," said Pat Norman, 
co-chair of a gay-rights march on the U.N. June 26. Other gay activists 
are turning away from the radical tactics of groups such as ACT UP, to 
more traditional and moderate ways of making their point, such as 
writing letters to members of Congress or joining a Red Cross chapter, 
according to news reports. "It's tactically smart for more 
moderate-seeming gay groups to ask their more bizarre brethren to put a 
lid on it," said Bob Knight of the Family Research Council. 

United Methodist bishops defined "self-avowed practicing homosexual." 
The Council of Bishops said the phrase describes a person who engages 
in sexual acts with others of the same sex, and the acts "are either 
witnessed or openly acknowledged." The council admitted that the 
definition is based on sexual behavior rather than predisposition, and 
that regional bodies and ordination panels of the UMC would retain the 
responsibility for assessing that behavior. 
...The issue is important in the 9-million-member denomination because 
of confusion over who can be ordained to the ministry. Some Methodists 
have held that homosexuals who acknowledge a homosexual orientation, 
but remain celibate, should be eligible for ordination. 

The Episcopal Church has approved a restructuring that places 
responsibility for ministries with parishes and their dioceses. 
Shrinking funds coming from the parishes to the national church forced 
the decentralization of the 209year-old denomination. The restructuring 
was approved at a Norfolk, Va., meeting of the Executive Council, the 
denomination's top administrative unit. Final approval is to be decided 
at the General Convention in August. 
...The new role of the national church will be to link groups 
performing specific ministries, help streamline them, and encourage 
others to begin. The national body will forge new partnerships with 
local churches, dioceses and nine provinces in the months ahead, 
Presiding Bishop Edmond L. Browning said. 
...Restructuring involves elimination of 43 jobs -- 17% of the 
denominational work force. The $4 million in budget cuts are part of a 
three-year, $129-million fiscal plan. Facing elimination are a national 
AIDS project, assistance to three black Episcopal colleges, and a 
program that has 50 volunteers in assignments around the world. 

A new, black "charismatic Baptist" fellowship says it wants to maintain 
its Baptist roots. Member churches of Full Gospel Baptist Church 
Fellowship, begun in March 1993, will operate as Baptists in structure 
and administration, but be charismatic in theology, said Kenneth Ulmer 
of Los Angeles, who will be consecrated as a FGBCF bishop in March. 
"You can't ride two horses going in opposite directions," Caesar Clark, 
vice president-at-large of the National Baptist Convention USA, told 
The Dallas Morning News. "They're either Baptists or they're not." 

Alliance Defense Fund organizers hope to get Christians to pool 
financial resources to protect values that matter to evangelicals. The 
Phoenix-based group was launched to make sure conservative 
public-interest law firms are as well-funded as their more secular 
counterparts, namely People for the American Way, the American Civil 
Liberties Union, and "radical" pro-choice, feminist, and 
homosexual-rights groups. 
..."Christians have not been united in their efforts to defend 
religious freedom," said Larry Burkett, a founding member, along with 
James Dobson, Don Wildmon, D. James Kennedy, Bill Bright, and Marlin 
Maddoux. ADF will funnel money from foundations, organizations, 
businesses, parachurch ministries, individuals, and numerous churches 
and synagogues to established volunteer lawyers and firms. The goal is 
to challenge opposing legal agendas at national, state, and local 
levels, founders said. 
...By 1997, the group predicts it will help fund 150,000 work hours, 
worth $26 million. Cases funded with grants will include religious 
freedom, sanctity of life, family preservation, education, and 
prevention of pornography. ADF also will fund legal aid for the needy, 
and training courses for volunteer attorneys, as well as start a legal 
referral service, drawing from a national database of interested 
attorneys it will establish. 

Colorado Springs will become headquarters to the Coalition on Revival, 
now based in Sunnyvale, Calif. COR President Jay Grimstead announced 
the move in a December letter to supporters of the "traditional values" 
ministry. Groups that monitor the religious right are concerned because 
they consider COR to be a radical, politically active Christian 
networking think tank. They say COR leaders hold reconstructionist 
views that are based on Old-Testament law, and will seek to make 
America a theocracy. The Colorado Springs-based Citizen's Project, a 
political watchdog group, predicts some of the nearly 60 Christian 
ministries in the Springs may try to distance themselves from COR. 
...Among COR's plans upon arrival in June are the establishment of 
Kingdom College. A brochure indicates the school will train Christian 
activists to "systematically and effectively rebuild their civilization 
on biblical principles." COR plans to open Kingdom College to "would-be 
world changers" by August 1. 

Some 35,000 American Catholic families are home schooling. Though the 
vast majority of home schoolers nationwide are evangelical Protestants, 
home schooling is growing by 30% each year among Catholics, according 
to the National Catholic Register. The newspaper estimates that 15% of 
Catholic home school families use Catholic curriculum, and that home 
schoolers account for as much as 2% of all school-aged children. 

Texans are calling for reinstatement of voluntary prayer in public 
schools. Commissioners and city councils recently have been decrying 
the 1963 U.S. Supreme Court decision banning school-sponsored prayer as 
an important factor in the deterioration of American religious and 
moral beliefs. Galveston officials are the latest to endorse such a 
statement. In the past six months, 134 Texas counties and more than 50 
cities or towns have adopted similar resolutions. The resolutions do 
not change state law, but they often are used to lobby Congress. 
...The resolutions are unnecessary and unwise, said Weston Ware, 
citizenship associate with the Texas Baptist Christian Life Commission. 
Ware told Associated Baptist Press that students' religious free-speech 
rights already have protection under the Equal Access Act of 1984, 
which allows voluntary student-led groups access to public school 
campuses, and prohibits discrimination on the basis of meeting content. 
Ware also said the resolutions expose public school students to 
whichever religious majority might control their school board. 

The Virginia House of Delegates approved two bills regarding student 
prayer in public schools. The first clarifies that students may 
"voluntarily engage in student-initiated prayer" so long as they uphold 
the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion, and do not 
interfere with church-state separation. The second directs the attorney 
general and state Board of Education to draft guidelines on the rights 
and restrictions "relating to prayer and other religious expression" in 
public schools. Kent Willis of the Virginia chapter of the American 
Civil Liberties Union has called the bills redundant, because students 
already have the right to pray voluntarily as individuals. 

The first broad, national study of indebtedness among seminary students 
found that 52% of master of divinity graduates and two-thirds of those 
enrolled for other master's degrees borrow no money during seminary. 
While 48% incur some indebtedness during seminary, 25% borrow less than 
$10,000, and 15% borrow $10,000 to $20,000, according to the study by 
Auburn Theological Seminary. Only one M.Div. graduate in 14 incurs 
$20,000 or more in debt. Among students who become significantly 
indebted, single students borrow more than married students, the study 
showed. More African-American students (58%) than whites (45%) borrow 
money. 
...The study contradicts notions common among seminary presidents that 
the rising debt load of students is a pressing problem, according to 
Anthony Ruger and Barbara Wheeler of Auburn Theological Seminary. The 
results of the study appeared in an article in The Christian Century. 
People assume the extreme stories are the norm -$25,000 to $30,000 in 
debt. "The stories of extreme debt are not the norm, but the 
exception," Ruger told NIRR. 

Forty-four percent of Baby Busters -- people between the ages of 18 and 
29 -- say religion is important in their lives, according to a new 
Gallup poll. That compares to 54% of Baby Boomers (ages 30-39), and 73% 
of seniors (ages 50 and over). Fifty-nine percent of Baby Busters claim 
allegiance to a church, compared to 68% of the Baby Boomers, and 77% of 
seniors, Gallup said. 
...Baby Busters may seem less religiously oriented than the preceding 
generations, but a comparison with young adults of a decade ago finds 
little difference, Gallup said. What remains to be seen is whether the 
major faiths and denominations can attract young people as members who 
will identify themselves with a specific denomination or set of 
beliefs, Gallup said. 

Louisiana preachers Jimmy Swaggart and Marvin Gorman are settling their 
1987 defamation suit out of court. The insurance companies responsible 
for paying any judgments insisted on the compromise. Terms of the 
settlement were not disclosed. Gorman won a $6.6-million judgment in 
1991 against Swaggart and his ministry. Although Gorman confessed to an 
instance of adultery, his suit had maintained that Swaggart ruined his 
ministry by spreading untrue stories of repeated extra-marital affairs. 
The suit said Swaggart's actions were an attempt to reduce competition 
by Gorman's ministry, and to exact revenge. Gorman was instrumental in 
seeing that photos of Swaggart and a prostitute received wide media 
attention. The proposal will go to a bankruptcy judge handling Gorman's 
debts. Both evangelists still broadcast, but to much smaller audiences 
-- Gorman from Metarie, and Swaggart from Baton Rouge. 

Billy Melvin will retire as executive director of the National 
Association of Evangelicals on March 31, 1995, after 28 years in the 
association's top post. A search committee has been named to find 
Melvin's replacement, who is to take office after the association's 
annual convention on March 5-7, 1995. 
...Operation Rescue is moving its headquarters to Dallas from 
Summerville, S.C. Keith Tucci, head of the prolife group, will be 
replaced by Flip Benham, co-founder of the organization's Dallas-Fort 
Worth branch. 
...Deaths: James McLeish, former InterVarsity president and chief 
operating officer, died Jan. 30 at age 72 in Kissimmee, Fla. McLeish 
worked for IV from 1951 to 1985.  . . . Dr. Walter H. Judd, former 
medical missionary to China, member of Congress, and prominent critic 
of communism, died of cancer at age 95 in Mitchellville, Md. China, 
member of Congress, and prominent critic of communism, died of cancer 
at age 95 in Mitchellville, Md.

Vol. 8, No. 4                                                       
February 7, 1994 

The clergy-penitent privilege is being challenged by criminal 
prosecutors who argue that it unfairly restricts evidence and testimony 
that could lead to convictions, according to The Wall Street Journal. 
Privilege issues are sensitive because of current public support for 
strong measures against crime, lawyers say. The most common challenges 
to the privilege are in cases of possible child abuse reported to 
pastors. 
...Courts around the country have begun to tip the balance toward a 
narrower view of the clergy-penitent privilege, according to the 
Journal. Nine states -- Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, 
Missouri, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming -- permit clergy to break the 
privilege without permission of the worshiper. The trend undermines the 
sanctity that worshipers expect in their spiritual communications, 
religious-rights groups and civilliberties lawyers say. 
...Most states still give the laity some protection in communications 
with the clergy, though seldom as much as attorney-client, 
doctor-patient, or spouse-to-spouse communications. States increasingly 
are showing significant deference to the psychotherapist-patient 
relationship, the Journal said. 

For the 1994 tax year, the Internal Revenue Service will be looking for 
more than canceled checks as documentation for lump-sum charitable 
contributions of $250 or more. Written or printed acknowledgement from 
the church or non-profit beneficiary is required after Jan. 1, 1994. 
The IRS said some taxpayers had filed returns claiming to have made 
charitable donations that were actually payment for goods or services, 
such as church suppers, lecture tickets, books, tapes, or day care. For 
medical and other kinds of deductions, the IRS will continue to allow 
canceled checks to serve as receipts. 
...IRS Publication 17 indicates written acknowledgements must: include 
the amount of cash or describe any property donated; note whether goods 
or services were exchanged for the contribution; give a description and 
goodfaith estimate of the value of donated goods; be received by the 
donor before the return is filed. If contributors receive an 
"intangible religious benefit" from a donation (admission to a ceremony 
or lecture, for example), the acknowledgement must say so, but no value 
estimate is necessary. IRS employee Sylvia Gibbs also told NIRR that if 
contributors write two or more checks to the same charity on the same 
day, and their total is $250 or more, the IRS may count them as one 
contribution. None of the changes affect filing for the 1993 tax year. 

The Catholic Church and the Southern Baptist Convention will oppose any 
health-care reform legislation, no matter how good, if it includes 
abortion coverage, representatives of the two denominations told a Jan. 
26 House subcommittee examining various reform proposals. 
...Including abortion coverage would "assault the conscience of 
millions of Americans," said Helen Alvare of the National Conference of 
Catholic Bishops' Secretariat for Pro-Life Activities. Ben Mitchell, 
director of Biomedical and Life Issues for the Southern Baptist 
Christian Life Commission, told the subcommittee that proposals such as 
those presented by the Clinton administration would force religious 
groups and local churches to fund abortion against their wills. He 
criticized the opt-out clauses as a "presidential placebo for the pain 
of a wounded conscience." 
...Although abortion was deemed the key health-care-reform evil, 
Baptists also identified other concerns at a Jan. 18 consultation with 
leading Christian ethicists, family advocates, physicians, abortion 
foes, theologians, and legislators. Problems they identified in the 
Clinton proposals included: (1) government intrusion with mandated 
providers or health care alliances that would erode trust in the 
physician-patient covenant; (2) threats to religious liberty and 
freedom of conscience with taxpayer-funded abortion or services that 
ostensibly could lead to legalized euthanasia or assisted suicide as a 
money-saving means; (3) restriction of medical resources based on age, 
quality of life, or disability; (4) interference with families by 
allowing "family-planning" services that bypass parental consent or 
involvement; and (5) potential impact on Southern Baptist individuals, 
entities (such as hospitals), and agencies. Key elements for any reform 
include cost reduction, liberal access to health insurance, and medical 
aid to the needy -- any of which could be accomplished without a 
government-controlled health care system, participants concluded. 

The RICO decision is significant, but not that important 
constitutionally, pro-life attorneys said about the U.S. Supreme 
Court's Jan. 24 ruling that allows the law to be used to prosecute 
abortion protesters. Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote for the 
unanimous court that the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations 
law need not apply only to acts with a financial motive (NIRR 5/31/93). 
"It was a narrow decision on a procedural matter," said American Center 
for Law and Justice Chief Counsel Jay Sekulow. He added that the court 
was not ruling on whether Joseph Scheidler and other pro-life 
defendants were involved in a nationally organized conspiracy to use 
force, violence, or intimidation against abortion clinic operators or 
potential clients, as the National Organization for Women alleged. The 
case has been sent back to a lower court to decide that issue, he said. 
In a concurring but separate opinion, Justices David Souter and Anthony 
Kennedy warned against the danger that some could try to use RICO to 
squelch First Amendment rights, a claim made by numerous abortion foes. 
...The court has agreed to hear a case with stronger constitutional 
implications, Scott Thomas of the American Family Association Law 
Center said. Madsen v. Women's Health Center will decide whether judges 
can create a protest-free "bubble zone" around a Melbourne, Fla., 
abortion clinic. The case will be argued in April. 

A fetus that is viable at the time of a fatal injury is a human being, 
Oklahoma's Court of Criminal Appeals ruled, establishing a new state 
precedent. The decision came in response to an appeal of a first-degree 
manslaughter conviction. A drunken driver was sentenced to eight years 
for causing the death of a woman's fetus, expected to be born four days 
after the 1990 accident. Doctors performed an immediate Caesarian 
section, but the baby was brain dead. Because the legal change cannot 
be applied retroactively, the court reversed the conviction. 
...Oklahoma joins Massachusetts and South Carolina in rejecting the 
"born alive" common law, followed since the 1300s. Before the Oklahoma 
ruling, an unborn child could not be the victim of a homicide unless it 
had been removed alive from its mother's body before its death. Medical 
and technological advances made the "born alive" principle obsolete, 
the judges said. The court said the ruling would not apply in cases of 
legal abortions. 

Right-to-die supporters in Washington state hope to find their own 
"equivalent of Roe v. Wade," said an attorney representing three 
terminally ill patients, four physicians, and the Compassion in Dying 
organization. They filed suit questioning the constitutionality of a 
state law banning doctor-assisted suicide. The group maintains that if 
the 14th Amendment guarantees the right to decide how to live, then 
competent, terminally ill adults should be allowed to decide how to 
die. In 1991, Washington citizens voted down Initiative 119, which 
would have decriminalized "aid in dying" for the terminally ill. 
Promoting a suicide in Washington remains a felony, punishable by up to 
five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. The plaintiffs are forcing the 
case because federal courts never have ruled on such a suit, and the 
decision could establish precedent. Assisted suicide is illegal in 30 
states, including Michigan, where Dr. Jack Kevorkian has been charged 
with the crime. Critics of assisted suicide say it minimalizes the 
sanctity of life, and opens the door to legalized euthanasia. 

The Loudon, Va., School Board will not appeal a ruling banning all 
prayers at its public schools' graduations. Late last month, members 
voted 7-3 to discontinue their challenge of U.S. Judge Albert Bryan, 
Jr.'s decision that student-led prayers violate church-state 
separation. Although six in the majority said they personally support 
graduation prayers, they could not justify the mounting legal expenses. 
Students, parents, and teachers initiated the lawsuit, and because the 
board lost the most recent appeal, it must pay both sides' legal bills, 
currently about $130,000, according to The Washington Post. 
...Money triumphed over morality, claimed those who favored a continued 
legal battle. They also said the decision sets a dangerous precedent 
for Northern Virginia schools. Although local churches and several 
Christianrights defenders offered to help fund an appeal, board members 
said they could not risk a potential liability of $500,000 if they lost 
the case. In addition, some saw dangers in accepting help from legal 
groups with strong ideological viewpoints. School officials said this 
year's ceremonies will be the first ever without some kind of prayer. 

"For the rest of my life I want to be a bridge-builder," Billy Graham 
said at a Beijing banquet held in his honor Jan. 25 at the Great Hall 
of the People. He urged China's leaders to face moral and spiritual 
issues that accompany their present rise in economic stature. At the 
back-alley home of a minister, Graham acknowledged the Chinese church's 
vigor, and encouraged it to pray for world-wide evangelism. 
...Reiterating his aspirations for reconciliation, Graham went to North 
Korea Jan. 27 for six days of sermons and lectures. The invitation to 
Graham signaled North Korea's openness to more contact with the United 
States despite conflict over Pyongyang's suspected nuclear missile 
program, analysts said. Graham spoke with President Kim Il-sung and 
conveyed a message from President Bill Clinton, the Korean Central News 
Agency said. 
...Graham, who in 1992 became the first foreign religious leader to 
preach in the North Korean capital, encouraged reunification of the two 
Koreas. In South Korea, Protestant and Catholic Christians outnumber 
Buddhists. For five decades, North Korea has suppressed religion other 
than the worship of its leader, Kim Il-sung. However, the government in 
recent years built a Catholic and a Protestant church and restored 
Buddhist shrines, according to press reports. Graham addressed students 
at Kim Il-sung University (NIRR 4/20/92; 4/6/92). 
...Moon Ik-hwan, South Korean Presbyterian minister and New Testament 
scholar, died Jan. 18 of heart failure at age 76. Moon, who translated 
the Bible into Korean, was imprisoned several times for his dissident 
activities in support of democracy and Korean reunification (NIRR 
3/22/93; 1/15/90). 

Iran's top evangelical leader, Haik Hovsepian-Mehr, has been found 
murdered. He had disappeared three days after the apparent success of 
his campaign for the release of Iranian Assemblies of God pastor Mehdi 
Dibaj, who had been sentenced to death for religious conversion (NIRR 
1/24). Hovsepian, head of Iran's Assemblies of God and of the nation's 
Evangelical Council of Pastors, disappeared Jan. 19. An investigation 
is being sought by Middle East Watch, a New York-based human-rights 
group. 
...Iran released Hovsepian's body to his family Feb. 1 and ordered a 
funeral to be held the next day, Christian Solidarity International 
said. Iranian Christian leaders in Europe had expressed hope that 
church officials from around the world would attend Hovsepian's 
funeral. The Springfield, Mo.-based AG in the United States said 
Hovsepian had told them of persecution in early January, saying, "If we 
die or go to jail for our faith, we want the whole Christian world to 
know what is happening." 
...Hovsepian, 48, an ethnic Armenian, had increased his criticism of 
Iranian authorities for their persecution of the evangelical church in 
Iran, Middle East Watch said. A wave of persecution of evangelicals in 
recent months is part of a plan by Iran's Supreme Revolutionary 
Cultural Council, led by the Ministry of Islamic Guidance for 
Minorities, and endorsed by Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali 
Khamenei, said Patrick Sookhdeo of London-based International Institute 
for the Study of Islam and Christianity. 
...Arrests, imprisonment, interrogation, and torture of Muslim converts 
may still be continuing, sources say. In recent years, churches were 
closed in Sari, Gorgan, Ahwaz, Kerman, and Kermanshah, and only one 
meeting per week is allowed at a church in Urumieh, sources said. In 
Mashad, pastor Mohammed Sepehr has replaced Hosein Soodmand, who was 
executed in 1990, but Sepehr is being arrested, interrogated, and 
beaten once a week, sources said. In June 1993 in Isfahan, the 
Assemblies of God congregation was gathered in a private garden when 
police scaled the walls and surrounded the group, warning against 
future services. In Kermanshsah, at the Assyrian Pentecostal Assembly, 
converts have been beaten with thick wires and hanged upside down, 
sources said. 

Colombian guerrillas kidnapped New Tribes Mission workers Timothy 
Bambay and Steven Welch in January. Abductors apparently were 
protesting the presence of U.S. drug agents in Colombia, news sources 
said. 
...The one-year anniversary of the kidnapping in Panama of three 
missionaries arrived with recent evidence that the men, held for $5 
million ransom, are still alive. A radio transmission in December gave 
the first evidence since last April that New Tribes Mission workers 
Charles Mankins, Mark Rich, and Richard Tenenoff had not been killed. 
Payment of ransom is against the policy of both NTM and the U.S. 
government (NIRR 11/29/93). 

An outreach being called Norway's largest evangelism campaign will 
bring 1,000 missionaries for the Winter Olympics. The effort to 
influence athletes and spectators from 80 countries is being organized 
by Youth With A Mission. President of the Lillehammer Organizations 
Committee, Gerhard Heiberg, has endorsed the activity, calling it "A 
positive thing." Youth With A Mission organizers and staff members will 
join several local churches from throughout the country in providing 
prayer rallies and open-air evangelism at the three competition sites 
of Hamar, Gjovik, and Lillehammer. YWAM's Nordic regional director, Alv 
Magnus, hopes the event will create a new wave of missionary service in 
Norway. 

A British Christian missionary has been invited to teach at an Islamic 
training center in Uganda. Robin Watson lectures about Christianity and 
leads debates at the Islamic Training Institute of Bugembe and at the 
Masjid Noor "Mosque of Light." As a result of his work, Watson has 
received a public commendation from Hilaal Said, secretary of the 
Ugandan Muslim Dawa Association. According to Said, Watson's work at 
informing the Muslim community about Christianity "will give room for 
students to decide for themselves." Watson, who is often accompanied on 
his visits by converted Ugandan Muslims, hopes his work will stimulate 
compassion in hospitals and prisons. 

Chinese authorities have arrested 14 independent Christian leaders for 
religious reasons, according to information smuggled out of China over 
the last two months, the Puebla Institute said. Among those arrested 
are seven underground Catholic priests and seven evangelical 
house-church leaders. At least six of the 14 have been sentenced to 
"reform through labor" for between one and three years, and at least 
five of the six sentences were handed down without trial or other due 
process, the human-rights group said. 
...The arrests come as China is trying to present a better image to the 
Clinton administration, which has issued an executive order 
conditioning renewal of China's Most Favored Nation trade status on 
progress in human rights. 

Anti-Semitic assaults, threats, and harassment rose 23% in the United 
States last year, reports the AntiDefamation League. The New York-based 
organization said it was told of 1,079 incidents, up from 1992's figure 
of 874. The figure for all anti-Semitic acts, 1,730, was the 
second-highest in the ADL survey's 15-year history, topped only by 
1991's record of 1,879. 
...Anti-Semitic acts at colleges jumped 7% last year, up 126% since 
1988, ADL said. Contributory factors include revisionists' ads in 
college newspapers claiming that the Holocaust never happened, and 
speeches with overtly anti-Semitic tones and themes, such as a recent 
campus lecture at New Jersey's Kean College, research director Alan 
Schwartz said. There the Nation of Islam's Khalid Abdul Muhammad, an 
aide to Louis Farrakhan, called Jews "the blood suckers of the black 
nation." Such "in-your-face anti-Semitism" was deeply troubling, ADL 
National Director Abraham Foxman said. Numerous leaders, including 
Jesse Jackson, have repudiated Muhammad's remarks. 
...ADL noted that 25 Jewish cemeteries were desecrated (a 50% jump over 
1992), although vandalism dropped 8% (to 788 acts), probably because of 
improved security at public properties. Arrests for anti-Semitic acts 
fell 30%, with 60 in 16 states. ADL indicated arrests might have been 
higher had police considered verbal intimidation. Of the 44 states 
reporting any anti-Semitic acts, New York, New Jersey, Florida, 
California, and Massachusetts had the most. 

Members of some 3,000 Southern Baptist churches are building "walls" of 
prayer around their cities in hopes of rousing revival. Larry Thompson, 
pastor of Dauphin Way Baptist Church in Mobile, Ala., began the prayer 
alert because Christians had "left the wall," and Satan had "decimated 
the body." 
...Watchman PrayerNet intercessors each pray for an hour a week, 
coordinating their efforts so that every hour of the day someone or 
some group in the church is praying. Accountability is built in: as the 
intercessors finish their scheduled hour, they call the group or 
individual scheduled to pray next. Late-night and early-morning prayer 
slots often are filled by college students and senior citizens, said 
Craig Schroeder of Watchman PrayerNet in Boston. Organizers said the 
idea has spread to hundreds of churches outside the Southern Baptist 
Convention, making the networks interdenominational. 

Southern California churches are mobilizing earthquake-relief efforts, 
but many are hard-pressed because of their own damage. Until churches 
are equipped to give assistance, thousands of victims will go without 
aid. Denominational bodies are reaching out to member churches. 
Donations to help earthquake victims have come from private citizens, 
corporations, foreign cities, and the queen of Jordan. Cost of the 
Northridge quake may exceed $30 billion, making it the costliest 
natural disaster in U.S. history. 
...World Vision has set up a grant program to help churches repair 
their damage and care for victims. Many denominations -- including 
Methodist, Foursquare Gospel, American Baptist, and others -- are 
involved in the program, called First Family Assistance Grant, said 
World Vision's Cathy McCaul. World Vision is looking for churches 
across the country to adopt a quake-damaged church through funding and 
volunteer help, McCaul told NIRR. 
...Condemned churches in Los Angeles haven't stopped congregations from 
meeting. More than 25,000 pounds of food, water, baby supplies, and 
blankets were distributed to earthquake victims in the parking lot -- 
where services also have been held -- of the Sepulveda Calvary Chapel, 
two miles from Northridge. The supplies came as a result of a four-day 
food drive from 15 churches in Phoenix and Food for the Hungry. A 
volunteer team that worked with Calvary Chapel and two other Los 
Angeles churches to meet the physical needs of the residents "weren't 
quite prepared for the psychological impact the earthquake has had," 
Sally Digges of Food for the Hungry told NIRR. "There's going to be a 
long-term emotional and spiritual impact on these people," she said. 
"Many of the recipients have a frightened, animal-like look," according 
to Lesa Caban of Food for the Hungry. 
...The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America flew crisis counselor 
Gary Harbaugh to Los Angeles in January to advise denominational 
leaders about the long-term emotional effects they can expect, based on 
the experience of others before them. "We called them `disaster 
pastors'," said Harbaugh, referring to ministers he and his wife, 
Marlene, counseled for one year after Hurricane Andrew. He heads the 
Orlando, Fla.,-based Leadership Support Services of the ELCA. When 
Harbaugh left for California, "every one of [the pastors] asked that 
their names be given to colleagues in the quake region. They were 
willing to come out and help in any way they could because they were so 
grateful for the help they had received, he said. 

Grace Lutheran Church in suburban Seattle raised $1 million from 1986 
to 1993 to help relieve world hunger, and the church now plans to raise 
another million. While giving has grown, the church has grown 
numerically -- from 300 to more than 800, according to The Lutheran. 
..."Compassionate hearts grew along with the people's commitment of 
resources to hunger issues," said pastor Edward Markquart. Twenty years 
ago at an annual congregational meeting, he challenged members to feed 
the hungry. Parishioners began to help wherever and whenever they were 
needed, taking missions trips to Haiti and Jamaica, and working at a 
food bank and an inner-city mission. Five nights a week, a church van 
transports homeless men from inner-city Seattle to sleep in beds at the 
church. Grace Lutheran youth have helped repair an orphanage in 
Tijuana, Mexico, and remodel a fellowship hall at a Hispanic church in 
nearby Toppenish. 

Seven inner-city Dallas churches with diminishing Anglo memberships 
have given their facilities to nearby Baptist churches with growing 
Hispanic congregations, according to Baptist Press. The churches deeded 
their property to other congregations, some of which were struggling 
financially. 
...Hundreds of members of Nueva Vida Baptist Church sang and marched 
the mile from their small, older building to begin a new era in the 
650-seat sanctuary of Second Baptist Church. Services in the new 
facility will be conducted in English and Spanish.  Leaders from 12 
denominations, ranging from liberal to conservative, have begun yearly 
strategy sessions to discuss mutual problems and concerns. The 
meetings, which began last year, have drawn increasing attendance, ELCA 
Communications Director Eric Shafer told NIRR. 
..."Denominations are not dying, they are changing," Robert Bacher, 
assistant to the presiding bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in 
America, told the leaders in Chicago recently. Denominations 
represented included Presbyterian, Episcopal, Baptist, and Methodist. 
...Churches face similar challenges, such as the need to restructure 
denominational offices and "strengthen the linkages between their 
congregations and regional and national structures," Bacher said. Other 
issues faced by the denominations include hiring quotas, mission 
support, fund-raising, cost-cutting, and policies relating to 
homosexuals. 

National church budgets are shrinking because the church has taught 
responsible stewardship, said churchgrowth expert Lyle Schaller. Church 
members know money should be used effectively for the Lord's work, and 
they trust themselves, more than anyone else, to do that, Schaller told 
coordinators of Mission Partners, an Evangelical Lutheran Church in 
America program that allows congregations to support new ministries 
directly. 
...Mission Partners' congregations give one-time gifts of money, loans, 
equipment, or supplies to new ministries, or volunteer their time and 
skills on projects, the ELCA News said. Gifts go directly to the new 
ministry without administrative expenses. Mission Builders, a companion 
program, uses retired carpenters, construction workers, or other 
volunteers throughout the country to work for ELCA congregations 
constructing church facilities. A critical question for denominations 
future is "Do you trust lay people?" said Schaller. 

A 78-year-old Christian businessman, Robert Levelle, and his 
eight-person staff of Dwelling House Sav-ings and Loan, counsel their 
clients from a biblical perspective on the Lordship of Jesus and 
practical steps to financing a home. Levelle, who is black, helps 
provide mortgage and home improvement loans to low-income families in 
the Hill district of Pittsburgh. Since 1957, Dwelling House has 
provided 878 mortgage loans to African Americans, 134 mortgage loans to 
whites, 275 home improvement loans and 12 mortgage loans to churches in 
the community. 
..."We lend to the person no one else will take," Levelle told NIRR. In 
past years, as the bank suffered 16 breakins and eight robberies at gun 
point, Levelle refused to install special security. "Bars on the 
windows would communicate that we don't love and trust the community, 
and we do. We haven't had a break-in the past 15 years now. The people 
here now know we're Christians," Levelle said. The community has also 
seen the difference Dwelling House has made. In 1960 only 12% of the 
residents owned homes, compared to 40% in 1990. Dwelling House has over 
$18 million in assets and 5,000 savers from 46 states and nine 
countries. These accounts, says Levelle, make mortgage loans possible 
to poor people who never before dreamed of owning a home. 

Christian professionals are sharing their expertise with struggling 
businesses in Richmond, Va. Seventy volunteers from Needle's Eye 
Ministries, an interdenominational Christian outreach to business 
people, staff Needle's Eye 911, an outreach program whose name reflects 
the sense of urgency that teetering businesses feel. 
...Volunteers such as lawyers, accountants, and personnel experts 
analyze the businesses' problems and develop solutions. Some 35 
companies have been helped by "911," which began two years ago. 
Needle's Eye also offers monthly luncheons in five locations, followed 
up by inquirers' meetings, Friday morning Bible studies at local 
restaurants, seminars on business attitudes and ethics, and small-group 
ministries. 
...About half of the business people who come to Needle's Eye for help 
are not Christians, said Judson "Buddy" Childress, Jr., who founded 
Needle's Eye in 1977. Some were referred by a Christian friend to whom 
they confided about their business problems, he told NIRR. 

Detroit church members are easing the return of former prisoners into 
their communities. Volunteers from 25 inner-city churches have 
committed themselves to mentor former prisoners, offering them 
friendship, support, and help with spiritual development. The mentors, 
along with a client-advocate from Prison Fellowship, help former 
inmates find jobs, housing, assistance to recover from substance abuse, 
or locate other social services. Prisoners are screened and selected 
for the program on the basis of need, personal commitment to change, 
and desire to return to live in the tough north Detroit neighborhoods. 
The mentors, who train and become certified by Prison Fellowship, 
initiate contact with prisoners six to 12 months before their release, 
and continue the relationship for up to three years. They also help the 
families of the former prisoners connect with social agencies and the 
church. 
...Several large suburban Detroit congregations have become partner 
churches in Transition of Prisoners, or TOP, and help find jobs and 
make other connections to businesses. The Kellogg Foundation 
contributed a $500,000 matching grant to TOP, with the balance being 
raised from other large donors. Assistance for repeat offenders is 
particularly crucial now, since Michigan lawmakers have proposed 
abolition of parol and also life imprisonment for three-time violent 
offenders, said TOP program director Joe Williams. 
...Prisoners have a Bible created especially for them. Free on the 
Inside is a New International Version with 75 pages of study helps 
designed for inmates, and testimonies from ex-convicts. The 
International Bible Society gave 40,000 Bibles to prisoners and 
chaplains in 1993, and has been "flooded with requests," said IBS's 
Glenn Paauw. 

Fifty-nine percent of Americans in 1993 said religion plays a very 
important part in their lives, a Gallup poll found. Women (65%) are 
more likely than men (52%) to consider religion important. Blacks (87%) 
are far more likely than whites (56%) to consider religion important. 
...As income increases, the importance of religion frequently declines. 
Two in three people who earn less than $20,000 in annual household 
income (67%) consider religion very important, compared to less than 
half of those earning $50,000 or more annually (45%). Those who did not 
attend college said religion was very important in their lives (62%) 
compared to those who did (55%). 

A Washington Superior Court acquitted cult deprogrammer Rick Ross of 
abduction charges. He had been accused of taking Jason Scott, 18, from 
his mother's home near Seattle, in an attempt to change his religious 
affiliation. Scott's mother, Kathy Tonkin, claimed her three sons' 
devotion to the Life Tabernacle Church in Bellevue was splitting her 
family, so she hired Ross to convince them to leave the church. Ross, 
40, swayed the two younger sons, but took Scott against his will and 
held him captive for five days in 1991, court testimony indicated. 
Tonkin also had hired three others to confine her son. Two who pleaded 
guilty to coercion were sentenced to 30 days in jail. Another testified 
for the state and was not charged. Civil rights activists, displeased 
with the Ross verdict, say it sets a dangerous precedent. Life 
Tabernacle pastor Harold Kern told reporters that by Ross' definition 
90% of American churches could be considered cults. 

A British survey corroborates the statistic that about one man in 90 -- 
not one in 10 -- is actively homosexual. London's Daily Mail heralded 
"The Gay Myth and the Truth" in a front-page story announcing the 
results of the Sexual Behaviour in Britain interviews with 19,000 
people. Of the men surveyed, 1.1% said they'd had a male sex partner 
within the last year, with the percentages rising to 1.4% within the 
last five years and 3.5% any time during their lives. About 6.1% of the 
men said they'd had some other kind of homosexual encounter. 
...Of the women surveyed, 1.7% said they'd had a lesbian sexual 
partner, and 3.4% had had a homosexual experience. The 1948 Kinsey 
study on human sexuality established the widely quoted estimate that 
10% of the American population is homosexual. Like the new British 
survey, a federally funded American study (NIRR 5/3/92) found 1.1% of 
men were actively homosexual in the last year. 
...The British Parliament is to vote on whether to lower the age of 
consent for homosexual men from 21 to 16, the consent age already 
established for heterosexuals and lesbians. England decriminalized 
homosexuality in 1967, earlier than most countries, but its consent age 
is higher than anywhere else in the European Community. Proponents say 
the current law discourages open AIDS education among gay boys. Medical 
officials say that the average age for a first homosexual experience is 
15.7. Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader John Major, whose 
moral and political crusade to return Britain to traditional family 
values was rocked by recent ministerial sex scandals and resignations, 
is said to favor age 18. 

An Episcopal divinity school is "willing to make apartments available 
to committed same-sex couples," according to its new campus housing 
policy. Trustees of the 150-student General Theological Seminary 
changed the rules Jan. 10, partially in response to a tenured lesbian 
professor's complaint to the New York City Commission on Human Rights. 
She claimed GTS' policy discriminated against her and her domestic 
partner on the basis of sexual orientation. Bishop Craig Anderson, 
seminary president, said the church, not the state, should resolve the 
matter. 
...The new policy continues to deny campus housing to other unmarried 
couples, and requires homosexual clergy or seminarians seeking 
ordination to have prior approval to live there from their diocesan 
bishops. Students and faculty are expected "to order their lives in 
accordance with the doctrine, discipline, and worship of the Episcopal 
Church" under the new policy, Episcopal News Service reported. At the 
most recent meeting of its policy-making body, the 1991 General 
Convention, the church said sex was appropriate only within the 
confines of legal and lifelong monogamous marriage between a man and a 
woman. 

Time Warner, Inc., may launch a magazine for gay and lesbian readers, a 
spokesman said. Although the considerations are "very preliminary," the 
ventures division of the company is said to be discussing the 
possibility with Maer Roshan, 26, who raised the idea with executives. 
Roshan was editor-in-chief of the defunct QW magazine, which closed 
when its key backer died of AIDS. Roshan is said to favor a crossover 
kind of homosexual magazine, which could appeal to heterosexuals as 
well. Time Warner officials said the division nearly always has about 
five proposals under consideration, most of which never are launched. 

School sex education does not seduce teens to have intercourse as much 
as some conservatives may think, says researcher David Kirby of ETR 
Associates, a nonprofit group interested in improving the behavior of 
youth. He presented his study of 23 school-based sex-ed programs in a 
paper to the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank 
in Washington. Sex-ed programs of the late 1970s and early 1980s that 
focused only on contraception may have encouraged younger teens to have 
sex at an earlier age, but did not convince older teens to do so, Kirby 
said. His study showed that today's classes (which, he said, often 
teach abstinence, postponing sex until later in life, contraception, 
and how to resist social and peer pressures) have not tended to hasten 
the onset of intercourse. 
...The classes that most effectively changed sexual behavior combined 
several emphases, and were age-based, Kirby said. Instruction for 
younger children, less likely to have had sexual experiences, should 
cover contraception, but focus more on delaying or abstaining from 
intercourse. Lessons for older youth, more likely to be sexually 
active, should include abstinence and resistance skills, but should 
focus more on condom and contraceptive use, he said. 

"Simply turn the set off," Pope John Paul II said in his strongest 
attack yet on television. In a message for the Catholic Church's 38th 
World Day of Communications, the pontiff said TV too often glorifies 
sex, pornography, and violence, distorts or manipulates news accounts, 
and encourages advertisers to exploit base or unrealistic views of 
life. The pope said parents -- not "an electronic baby-sitter" -- 
should be the key educators of children. TV also tended to isolate 
family members from each other, cut off conversation and prayer, and 
make youth video dependent. He urged families to communicate their 
raised ethical expectations for the television industry by 
communicating with media managers, producers, network executives, and 
government officials. 

Newhouse News Service has bought Religious News Service (NIRR 10/4/93). 
The financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed in the Jan. 26 
announcement. The Dallas-based United Methodist Reporter sold the 
religious wire service because it did not need to own RNS, although it 
relied heavily on its reporting. Newhouse Editor Deborah Howell said 
RNS's new owners planned to maintain its independence, and to expand 
its service to the religious press. RNS currently serves 270 clients 
five days a week. The changeover is scheduled for July 31, and RNS 
headquarters will move from New York to Washington. Judy Weidman will 
remain as RNS executive editor. 

Regent University is compromising academic freedom to aid Pat 
Robertson's political ambitions, says Herbert Titus (NIRR 7/26/93), the 
dismissed founding dean of the graduate institution's law school. In an 
interview with Mark O'Keefe, a Regent graduate and reporter for the 
Virginian-Pilot and Ledger-Star, Titus alleged he was fired because his 
outspoken personality and religious and legal views (considered 
controversial by some administrators and trustees) were deemed a 
liability to Robertson's desire to run for president again in 1996. 
Spokesmen for both Robertson and his Christian Coalition say the CBN 
founder has no plans to ever again launch such a campaign. 
...Titus also says his firing will hurt Regent's chances to retain law 
school accreditation with the ABA. The American Bar Association granted 
the Regent law school provisional approval in 1988, but the ABA may 
withdraw that endorsement if the school does not earn full 
accreditation this year. Titus was offered an endowed chair in law, and 
a recent compromise deal that if he stopped threatening to sue he would 
be paid until 1996. He refused both in the belief that he should be 
allowed to complete the accreditation process he began as dean. Regent 
officials say a new law dean was named to shift teaching to more 
practical law skills, and to help more graduates pass the bar exam. 

It wasn't quite politics as usual at the Jubilee Celebration of the 
National Religious Broadcasters in Washington, D.C. Key speakers at the 
50th anniversary convention focused on the primary role of the church, 
not party politics. 
..."God does not ride the backs of donkeys or elephants," said Tony 
Evans, pastor of Dallas' 2,500-member Oak Cliff Bible Church and 
president of Urban Alternative. Urging interracial cooperation within 
the church, he said "we may have come over on different ships, but 
we're in the same boat now." John Hagee, pastor of San Antonio's 
10,000-member Cornerstone Church, said the nation is engaged in a great 
civil war for its soul, and that it is time for the church "to take a 
stand," and "take America back" to morality. Christians must not fail 
to speak out on policy issues that impact the family and children, said 
Focus on the Family's James Dobson. Prison Fellowship founder and 
former Nixon aide Charles Colson said the church must "zealously guard 
the independence of the Gospel," not allowing it to be taken hostage by 
or used to the advantage of any political party. Although Christians 
should be civil and respect the office of the president, they also have 
a "right and duty to call him to biblical fidelity." 
...The NRB Executive Committee announced that, contrary to tradition, 
the President had not been invited to attend the convention. Although 
the NRB resolution said the reason was that Bill Clinton's positions 
were "blatantly contrary" to Scripture, new Chairman Bob Straton also 
told reporters that NRB leaders "felt hurt" that the White House lacked 
the courtesy to respond to either of two invitations extended to the 
president last year. Other NRB resolutions condemned television 
violence, praised Russian President Boris Yeltsin's defense of 
religious liberty, and opposed reinstatement of the "Unfairness 
Doctrine," as NRB President E. Brandt Gustavson called it. The law, 
repealed in 1987, would require broadcasters to give equal time to 
opposing viewpoints on controversial subjects. 
..."The response to this convention marks the end to the televangelism 
scandals," said outgoing NRB Chairman David Clark. Spokesmen said the 
convention had an almost-record attendance of more than 3,800 NRB 
members and other participants, and NRB started a waiting list for 
those who were not among the more than 200 exhibitors. In saying the 
organization was focused on ministry, not "hype, glitter, and glamour," 
Clark called the religious broadcasters to lead lives of righteousness 
and holiness, or resign their NRB memberships. 
..."The football game is on now because the Devil is afraid" men will 
hear the Word of God, Bahamian author and motivational speaker Myles 
Munroe told attendees at the 20th Black National Religious Broadcasters 
celebration Sunday night, scheduled the same time as the Super Bowl. 
Using the BNRB theme of Operation SOFT: Save Our Families Too, Munroe 
said positive male role models (especially fathers) and individual 
responsibility were keys to restoring fragmented families. His emphasis 
on men was also a common thread in remarks by pediatric neurosurgeon 
Ben Carson of Johns Hopkins, Baton Rouge pastor Dwight Pate, and BNRB 
Chairman Glenn Plummer. Several gospel musicians led worship and 
praise, and Lola Falana testified of her miraculous healing from 
multiple sclerosis. 
..."Most people can handle greater challenges than what we set before 
them," pastor and author Charles Swindoll told the broadcasters at the 
anniversary dinner, saying that difficulties "lead us into the future." 

Jack Kemp of Empower America emphasized the importance of religion in 
the political process. "Our political order depends on our religious 
order, which stands behind it and undergirds it," Kemp said. 
..."We must not politicize the church," Focus on the Family's James 
Dobson told a NRB breakfast gathering. "My greatest fear is that 
[politics] will split us and divide us," Dobson said.  The price that 
society will pay for abuse and rejection of its children is 
"incredible," and will hit the nation "like a storm," he said. 
...Campus Crusade's Bill Bright described NewLife 2000, the group's 
overall evangelistic strategy, which includes showing the "Jesus" film 
in 300 major languages and 1,000 dialects to 6 billion people, and 
using a variety of other evangelistic methods, including starting 
ministries on 8,000 college campuses in strategic metropolitan areas 
worldwide and helping participating denominations start a million new 
churches.

Missouri will have to wait for riverboat gambling, since parts of the 
law legalizing it are unconstitutional, the state Supreme Court ruled 
late last month. Gaming Commission officials had hoped to license the 
state's first floating casinos by spring, but the court unanimously 
ruled that the legislature had no authority to opt for lottery-like 
games on the boats. The Missouri Constitution says the people of the 
state must vote to amend the constitution to approve games of chance, 
such as slot machines and bingo. Skill-based games like Poker and 
Blackjack would be allowed, however. The Aug. 2 primary is the earliest 
scheduled opportunity for citizens to vote on the issue, which drew 
heavy opposition from several religious groups before originally 
passing in 1992. 

Jimmy Carter called religious leaders an "untapped resource" in 
improving health care. The former president spoke to 125 clergy and 
doctors invited to the Carter Center's Interfaith Health Program in 
Atlanta to explore how faith groups can play a larger role. He said all 
America's religions are "trying to serve God through the alleviation of 
suffering." Carter, a Southern Baptist, suggested that churches and 
religious groups launch adopt a community where they could immunize 
children against disease, help expectant mothers with pre-natal care, 
or ensure that elderly citizens receive regular checkups and their 
daily needs. Faith groups should put their differences aside, he said, 
to help restore hope in the health-care system, and strengthen disease 
prevention, community empowerment, and health education, especially on 
smoking and mental health. 
...U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, speaking at the interfaith 
meeting, praised volunteer church clinics, and proposed an "integration 
of church and state." She said government has the medical technology, 
and religious leaders have an understanding of their communities. 
Although voluntary church partnerships with public agencies would help 
the poor, they would not take the place of national health-care reform, 
Elders said. 

The first 150 of 500 Russian-language church libraries have been 
packaged in Moscow and are en route to congregations in the 
Commonwealth of Independent States. The joint project of Hands for 
Christ and Mission Possible Foundation is providing churches with a set 
of more than 60 books on basics in conservative Christian faith and 
doctrine, as well as videos, tracts, and cassettes in Russian. To equip 
500 churches for Christian education, the library ministry researched 
and selected from available Russian Bibles, Christian classics, and 
reference materials available from three Russian and three American 
publishers. 

Christians around the world will pray for Muslims during Ramadan, the 
holy month of prayer, fasting, and submitting to Allah, on Feb. 11 to 
March 12. Members of many denominations and local churches in scores of 
countries will use a devotional guidebook, published by YWAM, which has 
been printed in 12 languages. Intercessors also are asked to fast 
during the period, but not to actually observe Ramadan. 

The survey also found Protestants were more likely to say religion was 
very important to them (66%) than Catholics (54%) (54%).

Vol. 8, No. 3                                         January 24, 1994 

Iran released Assemblies of God minister Mehdi Dibaj rather than 
execute him Jan. 16 after an international outcry on his behalf. He had 
been condemned to death under Islamic law, or Sharia, for converting 
from Islam to Christianity about 45 years ago. 
...Imprisoned and frequently tortured since 1983, Dibaj testified to 
his Christian faith when given the opportunity to recant at a trial 
Dec. 3, according to press reports. The court's verdict cited Islamic 
law, which stipulates that one "born Muslim" who abandons the faith 
must repent or be killed. Dibaj was born to Muslim parents and observed 
some of Islam's religious duties at age 12. 
...After three unsuccessful appeals to the Supreme Court, Dibaj said he 
was ready to accept the verdict "with joy and peace," asking that a 
cross remain around his neck and that his body be given to a medical 
school, according to Baptist Press. By court standards, his failure to 
file another appeal within 20 days made the Dec. 21 execution order 
final, according to News Network International. After human rights 
groups protested, the U.S. Department of State urged Iran to honor its 
commitment as a party to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by 
releasing Dibaj. The French government also issued an appeal to Tehran. 
...Since Dibaj's release, Iranian authorities have denied sentencing 
him to death, despite international circulation of the original 
verdict. Iranian Christian leaders said that Dibaj was released on 
condition that he appear in court to answer new charges, including 
spying. 
...Iran hanged AG pastor Hossein Soodmand in 1990 after a conviction 
for spying. In separate instances, two other Iranian converts renounced 
their faith when threatened with execution during the past 14 months, 
BP reported. 

Some Christians in Iran are speaking out rather than remaining silent 
about increased government persecution in recent years. Last May, 
Tehran ordered non-Muslim shopkeepers to post signs announcing their 
religious affiliation, Baptist Press reported. In June the government 
ordered all Christian churches to sign a statement declaring they will 
not evangelize Muslims. In October, the government mandated that 
identity cards that are used when doing business must identify the 
bearer's religion. 
...Last year brought a wave of intimidation, beatings, arrests, and 
church closings in Iran, Iranian Christians told NIRR. Under intense 
pressure, most Christian denominations signed letters to the United 
Nations expressing appreciation for the full freedom they enjoy. Only 
the Assemblies of God and Brethren churches refused to sign the papers, 
the sources said. Iranian Christians outside Iran encouraged Christians 
worldwide to contact Iranian embassies and government offices, calling 
for a stop to the campaign of persecution. 
...In the United States, groups ministering to Iranians say resources 
are low, even though Iranian interest in Christianity worldwide seems 
high (NIRR 12/13/93). An evangelical broadcaster to Iranians said that 
every ministry to Iranians is "under-staffed and under-supported." 
Iranian Christians International President Ebrahim Ghaffari said that 
ICI's proposal for an institute to train Christians for ministry to 
Iranians remains unimplemented, while the needs for it increase. 

An eight-person home group started by an Iranian Christian has 
developed into a network of Iranian-Christian fellowships in the 
Central United States. 
...When Iran-born Amir Adib Yazdi and his wife, Dolores, converted from 
Islam to Christianity, they began to see themselves as missionaries to 
Muslims. They invited friends to their home to eat a Persian meal and 
watch the Jesus movie in the Farsi language. The group outgrew the home 
setting and began to meet in a chapel of Evangelistic Temple, a Tulsa 
Pentecostal Holiness church, on Sunday mornings. Soon, an Iranian 
fellowship was organized as a satellite church, with Yazdi as pastor. 
...The Yazdis' vision grew to include Iranians in other cities. By 
sending a letter to every person with a Persiansounding name listed in 
telephone directories, Yazdi and his wife established home groups in 
Oklahoma City, Dallas, Houston, Wichita, and Kansas City. Other groups 
are planned in Austin and San Antonio. The Yazdis attend initial 
meetings, then maintain regular contact with the groups, which are 
nondenominational and intentionally not political. 
...Response to the letters has been enthusiastic. Some 25%-30% of those 
invited actually attend, share a meal, watch the film, and enjoy 
fellowship. Many Iranians feel a great sense of loss of land and 
family, and are "really searching," Yazdi told NIRR. 

Arab Christian oil workers are conducting covert "oilpatch church 
meetings." Four Libyans oil workers began meeting almost two years ago 
for prayer at their work area in an Arab country. They gather before 
work six days a week near a loud diesel tractor so the engine noise 
will prevent their prayers from being overheard, an Iraqi Christian 
told the Korean American Center for World Mission. Within 14 months, 
the number of believers in Christ grew to 16, and now more than 60 new 
believers continue to meet for prayer beside the tractor, the report 
said. The Italian oil supervisor on that shift has arranged for a 
Maltese pastor to visit the oilpatch church monthly. 

Evangelists are planting churches among the impoverished and largely 
unreached Brazilians in villages along the Amazon River basin. 
Brazilian nationals, converted and trained through the ministry of 
Morton, Ill.-based Project Amazon, or PAZ, live with their families and 
travel from village to village by steel boats, built in a PAZ shop in 
Santarem. In addition, PAZ workers staff medical boats, delivering 
primary health care, providing vaccinations and dental care, and 
promoting hygiene. 
...Some 350 churches have been planted, ranging in size from just a few 
people to about 1,000, along the 4,000mile-long Amazon. The goal is to 
plant 10,000 churches by 2050, and "we are very far ahead of schedule," 
said Luke Huber, PAZ founder and director. Currently 60 PAZ boats 
travel along the Amazon. Six support bases for resupply have been 
established, and 11 more are planned. 
..."Our job has changed from one of dreaming and starting to one of 
training and developing, to one now of encouraging and fueling the 
national movement," Huber told NIRR. Several hundred national workers 
staff PAZ, while a handful of U.S. and Canadian missionaries act in 
support roles. Plans also call for using the PAZ model of river 
evangelism in Uruguay, Peru, Bolivia, and Mozambique. 
...New evangelical churches are blossoming in Brazilian cities, (NIRR 
3/22/93) with five evangelical churches established every week between 
1990 and 1992, according to a survey published in Latin American 
Ecumenical News. The main con-centration of the churches is in Rio de 
Janeiro, where 710 congregations were opened. 

Mexico has agreed to long-standing demands by Chamula evangelical 
Christians to punish their persecutors and to provide food, shelter, 
clothing, and resettlement assistance for those recently evicted from 
their homelands. The action came after the government poured troops 
into a battle with Indian rebels called the Zapatista National 
Liberation Army, in the state of Chiapas. The government was criticized 
for engaging a force of 14,000 heavily equipped troops against a rebel 
army of 1,000 to 2,000. A cease-fire and initial negotiations came 
after more than 100 casualties. None of the evangelical Chamulas 
participated in the Zapatista National Liberation Army. 
...Many Indians who had converted to the evangelical faith were being 
intensely persecuted by local authorities prior to the New Year's Day 
uprising in Chiapas. Some 30,177 displaced Indians living near San 
Crist bal are evangelical converts, expelled from San Juan Chamula, 
about eight miles away, according to Juan Rico of the Evangelical 
Alliance (EA) of San Crist bal and the Altos region. The region has 
responded to the gospel at a tremendous rate in the past four years, 
Southern Baptist representative Charles Collins told Baptist Press. 
...Oppression of the evangelical Indians contributes to unrest in 
Chiapas, CONEMEX (NIRR 1/10) President Raul Ruiz Avila told NIRR. 
Evidence of the oppression, accumulated by San Crist bal attorney Abd 
as Tovilla, is well known, he said. Tovilla founded Chiapas State 
Committee for Evangelical Defense in 1984 and currently heads EA. 
Despite evangelical appeals, 578 born-again San Juan Chamula believers 
were expelled late in 1993, EA said. 

Three provisions of Mongolia's new law imposing strict controls on 
non-traditional religions (NIRR 12/27/93) have been struck down. The 
Constitutional Court rejected sections of the law that prohibited 
teaching or evangelizing outside houses of worship, banned "religious 
propaganda by foreign citizens," and required registration of Muslim 
and Buddhist places of worship, according to Jubilee Campaign, a 
London-based human rights group that provided legal counsel to a 
Christian Mongolian challenging the law. 
...Public pressure by Christians world-wide is still needed, said Ann 
Buwalda, Jubilee's Annandale, Va.,-based U.S. director. Mongolians' 
human rights are violated by the remaining provisions of the law that 
survived the first challenge, including government regulation of the 
number of clergy, number and location of churches, and the 
establishment of Buddhism as the state-recognized religion, she told 
NIRR. Japan enjoys economic and political success, but its people are 
searching for meaning in their lives, Billy Graham said. The evangelist 
tried to fill that spiritual void with the Gospel of Christ in Mission 
94, his only foreign crusade of the year. Addressing the Foreign 
Correspondents Club, Graham, 75, said he was conducting his sixth 
Japanese crusade Jan. 13-16 to encourage the Japanese people to open 
their minds and hearts to the Bible message. Although active Christians 
comprise less than 1% of Japan's 124 million people, since 1970 the 
Bible has been a best-seller in Japan, with more than 1 million 
complete Bibles, and 10 million portions of Scripture distributed 
yearly. 
...In an effort to reach Japan for Christ, Graham booked the 
40,000-seat Tokyo Dome, usually reserved for baseball games and rock 
concerts, and set up approximately 60 satellite centers to accommodate 
thousands more participants. Graham held crusades in Tokyo in 1967 and 
1980, but said he wanted to reach a new generation in the world's 
largest city, which has 27 million inhabitants. The first and second 
meetings of Mission 94 each drew about 15,000 people, most of them 
already Christians, reporters said. Nearly 1,200 local evangelical 
churches participated and helped fund the $4.5-million evangelistic 
effort. Using a favorite text, John 3:16, Graham told his audiences 
that even if they did not accept Christianity, Jesus was relevant to 
their cultural-social problems, and the Bible would help them in their 
everyday lives. 
...The usual crusade youth night coincided with Adult Day, a national 
holiday to recognize those who in the coming year will turn 20, and 
reach Japan's traditional age of accountability. At the Saturday 
evening meeting, 58% of attendees were under 35, and the evangelist 
drew a beyond-capacity crowd of 45,000, which Billy Graham Evangelistic 
Association Spokesman Larry Ross said constituted the largest gathering 
of Christians in Japan ever. About 12% of those attending that night 
responded to Graham's message -- four times the usual response at an 
American crusade, BGEA officials indicated. 
...More than 40% of respondents at Mission 94 meetings were men, a 
higher-than-expected percentage. Graham's staff also noted that his 
messages were translated into five languages besides Japanese, and 
counselors reported a strong response from foreign graduate students, 
and African and Asian businesspeople working in Japan. 
...The crusades are said to have encouraged confidence among veteran 
missionaries to Japan, who often have seen little response to years of 
efforts. Graham said he hoped Mission 94 would "change the direction of 
the Japanese church," and encourage greater outreach. In addition, 
Japan's 300 indigenous missionaries to 36 foreign countries have a 
special mission, especially to the Pacific Rim, he said. "There is no 
greater export than the Gospel of Christ." 

Bosnian Muslims are coming to Christ because of the efforts of seven 
Atlanta churches. Two years ago, the 300member Northside Community 
Evangelical Free Church sent a team to live in the Gasinci refugee camp 
in Croatia. Since then, six other churches joined the effort, creating 
Church Resource Network International, which has sent 19 teams totaling 
120 people. 
..."This work is the most credible incarnational ministry in all 
Croatia," said Peter Kuzmic, an official at Agape, a relief agency in 
Osijek, Croatia. The teams live in the camp and provide clothing, 
firewood, children's activities, and Bible studies for the largely 
Muslim populated camp. 
...Last summer, officials removed all but Muslim refugees at the camp 
so relief agencies could provide exclusively for the refugees. However, 
Northside's pastor John Rowell told NIRR that his church now has a 
long-term team that lives in a nearby apartment, and will send 
short-term teams throughout the year to provide relief and outreach. 
Rowell said the Bosnians initially could not believe Americans would be 
willing to live in the camp because the conditions were so bad. "It 
demonstrates that small churches can be aggressively involved in 
missions." 

Late in December, nearly 80,000 young people attended an ecumenical 
gathering in Munich hosted by more than 300 local parishes. The 
Encounter of European Youth, organized by the ecumenical community of 
Taiz  in eastern France, featured themes of confidence, solidarity, 
kindness, resistance to pessimism, and prayers for peace, according to 
Ecumenical Press Service. For the first time in the Encounter's 16-year 
history, a majority of students attending were from Eastern Europe. 

Five denominations and 10 parachurch groups joined True Love Waits, a 
campaign originated by Southern Baptists to stop teen-agers from having 
sex before marriage (NIRR Special Supplement 10/4/93). The 
denominations are Assemblies of God, Church of God (Cleveland, Tenn.), 
Evangelical Covenant Church, Pentecostal Church of God, and The 
Wesleyan Church. Several contemporary Christian recording artists also 
support the campaign. The campaign has changed adult attitudes about 
teens, helping them realize that "young people can make good decisions 
on their own, based on good information," Jimmy Hester, organizer of 
the program, told NIRR. 
...True Love Waits received its biggest boost when the 
59-million-member Catholic Church came on board. The National 
Federation for Catholic Youth Ministry plans to send literature 
discussing adolescent sexuality to 180 dioceses. The Evangelical 
Fellowship of Canada also is participating. The campaign has drawn 
interest among teens in Kenya and Hungary, where 72 Budapest students 
sent in pledge cards to Hester, and has received newspaper coverage in 
London, Hester said. 
...The original goal of gathering 100,000 teen pledge cards has been 
raised to 500,000. Organizers hope for enough pledge cards for a 
display stretching from the Capitol to the Washington Monument at a 
Youth for Christ conference on July 29. 

Big cities are seeking advice from small-town churches on ways to help 
teen parents. Teen Parents Succeeding, a nonprofit day-care program in 
Syracuse, Ind., provides day care while teen parents finish school in 
exchange for the parents attending parenting-skills support groups.  
TPS has received inquiries for advice from cities and towns from 
California to New York. 
...Teen Parents Succeeding is a joint effort of 30 churches in three 
rural communities of Indiana. Contributions of time, finances, and 
volunteers by churches, businesses, and service organizations make TPS 
one of the country's few community-based teen parenting programs, 
according to Director Jackie Plikerd. The three-year-old program has 
provided ministry services for 19 young parents, nine of whom already 
have graduated. 
...The program has brought communities together as pastors participate 
and encourage their members to get involved. "Too often Christians 
think the government should do this, that the government will take care 
of it. TPS proves that Christians can do it," Plikerd told NIRR. 

Sunday school rooms at East Side Baptist Church in Fort Smith, Ark., 
become doctor's examining rooms, medical labs, offices for nurses, 
social workers, and nutritionists, and Bible classes for children each 
Tuesday night. 
...Agape Prenatal Clinic volunteers give free medical care to expectant 
mothers who are unmarried, indigent, or for some other reason are 
without health insurance, according to Baptist Press. Many referrals 
are made through two local crisis pregnancy centers or by word of 
mouth. In addition to the medical exams, women have lab work, are 
advised whether they are eligible for government assistance, and are 
offered spiritual counseling. Many patients bring their children. 
Another group of volunteers provides Bible study for children and sends 
Bible leaflets home to parents. 

Combining ministry to the poor with Super Bowl XXVIII, Habitat for 
Humanity and the NFL are "blitz-building" four homes for low-income 
families in the Atlanta area. Several NFL players, in addition to other 
notable volunteers including heavyweight boxing champ Evander 
Holyfield, Miss America Kimberly Aikin, and former congressman Jack 
Kemp, are expected to help tackle the project. The work will be 
acknowledged on Super Sunday air time donated by the NFL. The 
foundations were already laid, so construction could begin Jan. 19, 
Millard Fuller, president and founder of Habitat, told NIRR. The event 
will end Jan. 28 with a worship and house-dedication ceremony in which 
Bibles will be presented to the four families who will live in the 
homes. 
...Souper Bowl Sunday, a Fellowship of Christian Athletes-sponsored 
soup drive, also will take place Jan. 30. As they leave worship 
services, church members across the country will be encouraged to 
donate one dollar each, which youth groups will send to local soup 
kitchens, food banks, or other missions. FCA Public Relations Director 
Don Hilkemeir told NIRR that more than 1,900 churches in 20 
denominations contributed more than $144,000 last year. FCA also will 
host an NFL-recognized Super Bowl Breakfast on Jan. 28 for some 5,000 
athletes, coaches, fans, and their families. Former Washington Redskins 
coach Joe Gibbs will speak, Hilkemeir said. 

A Nazarene ministry helped feed 12,000 families while presenting the 
gospel in Memphis, Tenn., and Jackson and Fayette, Miss. Neighborhood 
Christian Center distributed 12,000 food baskets, with a total value of 
$500,000, on the Saturday before Christmas. The effort was the largest 
distribution of food boxes by a Nazarene compassionate ministry in the 
history of the denomination, leaders said. Baskets were distributed to 
the working poor, persons who had lost jobs, the elderly, and the 
handicapped. 
...People who received the boxes were required to attend one of 38 
separate church services on the Saturday of the giveaways. Services 
included singing, a sermon, and an invitation to accept Christ. The 
baskets were handed out at the close of the services. One Memphis 
pastor said that his church would run three vans on Sundays to 
accommodate all the persons starting to attend because of the event. 
Some 500 volunteers worked for three weeks prior to the distribution to 
help raise money and secure in-kind gifts, pack boxes, and distribute 
them. 

A Christian welfare-reform group plans to copy its model nationwide. 
Family Hope USA, begun in Michigan, where welfare reform and recession 
have hit hard, has gained glowing support from state politicians 
including Gov. John Engler, and from Empower America's Jack Kemp, and 
already has ministries in California and Florida designing programs to 
fit their communities. 
..."The working poor provide a challenge and opportunity for the church 
to respond," according to Joel Samy, president of Family Hope, USA. The 
Zeeland, Mich., group was founded late last year to help those living 
from paycheck to paycheck -- without government assistance. Family Hope 
is a partnership between community organizations, volunteers, 
corporations, churches, and professionals who donate goods or services. 
...Recipients must be employed, but have an income below $14,000 a 
year, the poverty line for a family of four. Some 37 million Americans 
fit that description, yet 47% of them receive no state or federal aid, 
Samy told NIRR. Some of the participants are longtime working poor; 
others' financial woes are linked to accidents, layoffs, or medical 
bills. Family Hope screens applications against lists from other 
agencies, documents their employment, and confirms that applicants are 
not receiving or seeking government funding. 
...Family Hope provides health care, car maintenance, home repairs, and 
financial counseling. In return, recipients agree in writing to perform 
community service equal in dollar value to the assistance they 
received. They volunteer at missions, clothing drives, shelters, food 
pantries, and other local charity agencies, which sometimes refer 
eligible parties to Family Hope. 
...The program also has evangelistic elements. Each family in need is 
matched with a mentor family in a partner church to build a two- to 
three-year support system. Most of the churches in the coalition are 
evangelical (including some mainline and Catholic congregations) or 
Pentecostal. Family Hope also encourages each employed family member to 
earn at least a high-school equivalency degree to help assure a 
self-sufficient future. Partners produce training materials for 
churches, and serve in discipleship ministries. 

Gun buy-back programs offered urban churches nationwide a way to honor 
Martin Luther King and combat violence. Florida's undertaking was an 
example of the church leadership in the community inspiring positive 
changes, Arthur Jackson, pastor of Miami's New Shiloh Missionary 
Baptist Church, told NIRR. "There are five gun factories in Dade County 
alone," he said, adding that new guns cost about $100 each. Local 
ministers and community leaders offered $25 for each working gun in the 
statewide initiative, which had the blessings of National Baptists, 
Pentecostals, United Methodists, Seventh Day Adventists, and other 
denominations, he said. Such buy-backs will take place monthly in 
Miami, funds permitting, he said. 
...Washington's Union Temple Baptist Church joined a youth consecration 
service with Funds for Guns, a buy-back program urging gun owners to 
"Just Dump It." Pastor Willie Wilson, along with former heavyweight 
boxing champ Riddick Bowe, who is Catholic, and his manager, Rock 
Newman, offered $100 for working guns. Wilson said the 
youth-helping-youth approach was unique, and "will encompass a sense of 
spirituality and bond that has been lost." The program spent $360,000 
helping to rid Washington of guns. 
...Across the country, other churches and civic organizations held 
similar events, some offering grocery coupons, clothing and shoe 
certificates, CDs, sports tickets, or day-care services instead of 
cash. In Philadelphia, children traded toy guns for other playthings. 
...Earlier this month, President Clinton's call to personal and moral 
renewal to combat violence drew support from an interfaith coalition of 
nearly 50 religious leaders. They said faith plays an important role in 
ending urban crises, and that religion could replace the fear of 
violence with hope and reconciliation. 

Per-member giving is declining in evangelical churches and holding 
level in U.S. mainline churches, according to a study by empty tomb, 
inc., a Champagne, Ill.-based research organization. Evangelicals still 
contribute more of their income than mainliners do, but giving dropped 
9% from 1985 to 1991, from 5.25% to 4.79%, while in the same period, 
mainline giving increased slightly, from 2.81% to 2.84% 
...As long as evangelical churches continue to grow numerically, 
continued decline in per-member giving may not affect their programs 
the way it has in some mainline communions, which have cut staff at the 
national level, the study said. Yet the study should create a "healthy 
anxiety" about church giving, said Sylvia Ronsvalle, its co-author. "As 
we are bringing people into the Kingdom, are we really teaching them to 
obey?" she asked. 
...While the study fell short of predicting the end of local 
congregations and denominations, it warned that church giving patterns 
point in that direction. Extinction of the national and regional 
structure of the church as it is constituted today is not inevitable, 
but is entirely possible, the study concluded. 
...The research group also is studying attitudes in the church, and is 
reaching sobering conclusions. "The church doesn't seem to have a 
compelling vision," according to preliminary findings of how 
congregational attitudes are influencing giving, Ronsvalle told NIRR. 
Church members who are willing to sacrifice are increasingly in short 
supply, and as church members have "changed from stewards to 
consumers," church leaders have followed the trend, Ronsvalle's 
findings show. 

A toll-free phone line dedicated to exposing Jehovah's Witnesses 
beliefs has become so popular that, from now on, callers will have to 
pay. Watching the Watchtower, a confidential service based in Danville, 
Va., gave weekly taped commentaries about the beliefs of the Jehovah's 
Witnesses, or the Watchtower Tract and Bible Society, as the church is 
known. Many Protestant groups consider the 4.2-million-member church a 
cult because members deny Jesus was God and believe only 144,000 souls 
will enter heaven. 
...The service received so many calls from across the country in its 15 
months of operation, that the cost of the toll-free line was a problem. 
George Kesterton, director and a converted Jehovah's Witness, told 
Baptist Press the service had accumulated a $6,000 phone bill. 
Kesterton, a volunteer with the interfaith witness department of the 
Southern Baptist Home Mission Board, took a job to pay his bills. He 
worked with local ministries to provide a similar line at (804) 
793-1554, and said any area could duplicate his model, with pastors 
trained to counsel callers. 

Darrow Parker, host of the Radio Bible Class Day of Discovery program, 
resigned after confessing marital infidelity and personal failures. 
Parker, RBC's best-recognized African-American, had served with the 
Grand Rapids, Mich.-based ministry for seven years as a featured 
musician, on-air personality, and manager of print materials. "We 
cannot escape the fact that certain behaviors and violations of trust 
disqualify a person from public ministry and leadership," especially in 
cases of sexual sin, wrote RBC President Mart DeHaan in an emotional 
letter last month. He asked contributors to pray for the Parker family, 
and indicated that the ministry was supporting the Parker family 
through its transition, and was providing counseling as part of 
Parker's process of repentance and spiritual restoration. 

Ads that offer taped and sheet music for Christians to reproduce and 
use for a one-time fee are well-meaning, but misleading, said Elwyn 
Raymer of Nashville's Church Music Publishers Association. 
...Kingdom Praise ads for its "free access music" club could put 
members in violation of the copyright act, Raymer said. Copyright 
infringement might be a common practice, but it still is illegal, and 
many composers and lyricists wouldn't produce music if they couldn't 
make an income from it, he told NIRR. 
..."Our heart is to free the music and free the gifts," Johnny 
Berguson, coordinator of Mansfield, Penn.-based Kingdom Praise, told 
NIRR. Kingdom Praise gives songwriters the option to make their 
copyrighted material more accessible to the church, which otherwise 
cannot legally copy the words to a song on an overhead transparency or 
print lyrics in church bulletins without licensed permission from the 
copyright owner. Since November, 5,000 people have requested the 
company's first tape, Kingdom Praise from Nashville at the Belmont 
Church. Purchasing one copy entitles members to duplicate the music 
"freely for ministry," but not commercially. Kingdom Praise pays 
royalties to songwriters on copies sold, "and there's nothing to 
prevent their registering for a license also" to control commercial use 
of their material, Berguson said. 
...A business perspective is "the wrong starting point" for Christian 
artists, said Wayne Berry, lyricist for the Belmont Church tape. A 
concern for the bottom line limits the flow of God's gifts through the 
body of Christ, because artists tailor their products to what will 
sell, he said. He urged those in the arts to "let God be sovereign and 
meet our needs." 

Evangelical Press Association launched a protest campaign over changes 
and proposed changes in postal rates for second- and third-class mail. 
Bob Terry, editor of the Missouri Baptist Convention's Word & Way, told 
NIRR that before the Nov. 22 changes, publications with less than 10% 
advertising were mailed at second-class, non-profit rates. 
Organizations paid for-profit rates on only the amount of advertising 
that exceeded 10%. Under the new law, secondclass mailers pay 
for-profit rates for the entire portion of the publication that 
contains advertising. 
...The greatest danger is in third-class proposals, which would keep 
non-profits from using the discounted rate to mail materials that, in 
any degree, seek to buy, sell, recruit, or promote, Terry said. Ads 
need not be paid under this U.S.P.S. definition. For example, if in a 
weekly church bulletin a pastor encouraged attendance at an upcoming 
annual meeting or asked youth choir members to buy t-shirts for their 
upcoming missions trip, the bulletin could not be mailed third-class, 
Terry said. He indicated the U.S. Postal Service disregarded unrelated 
business income tax, or UBIT, standards. Instead, U.S.P.S. adopted a 
"substantially related" test, under which non-profits can be charged 
higher postal rates for any materials whose purposes do not match those 
for which the organization was founded and granted a non-profit mailing 
permit, Terry said. He estimated the differences could cost non-profit 
mailers an additional 40%, and urges all EPA members to protest the 
changes before Feb. 9. 

It's been a banner year so far for traveling evangelist Guy Aubrey, 
whose outlawed John 3:16 signs touched off a lawsuit against the 
Cincinnati Reds (NIRR 11/4/91). Earlier this month, U.S. District Court 
Judge S. Arthur Spiegel ruled that the team's 1993 Sign and Banner 
Policy and its standard that fans' signs be baseball-related were 
"inherently arbitrary" and unconstitutionally overbroad. . . Aubrey's 
signs first struck out during the second game of the 1990 World Series. 
James Knicely, the attorney handling the case for the Rutherford 
Institute, told NIRR that Aubrey is a baseball fan who intended to 
proclaim the gospel with his sign, although that was not his sole 
motive for attending the game. Burns International Security guards at 
the city-owned Riverfront Stadium told the nondenominational minister 
he could not display a religious banner because it breached Major 
League Baseball and Reds' "good-taste" standards. Aubrey sued, claiming 
his freespeech and religious rights had been violated. The Reds revised 
their banner policy several times, usually in response to Spiegel's 
rulings that the policy was vague. Last April, Aubrey again was 
prohibited from displaying a banner, although he had reworked it to 
read "Go Reds, John 3:16" to meet the 1993 "baseball-related" 
guidelines. Spiegel said the standard was "even more flawed" than the 
earlier policy. 
...The Reds have since banned all non-commercial signs, although the 
team may change its position, Knicely said. Because damage awards still 
are in question, the Reds have not appealed Spiegel's latest decision, 
he said. 

Mississippi's House approved 109-8 a bill to allow student-initiated 
prayer in public schools. As long as student prayers are not sectarian 
or proselytizing, teachers may permit them, the bill says. Although 
opponents tried to limit student-led prayer to non-compulsory events, 
their proposal was unsuccessful. They continue, however, to question 
the constitutionality of the measure. The bill, which does not sanction 
state prayer, goes to the Senate for approval. 
...Former Jackson high school principal Bishop Knox (NIRR 12/27/93) has 
filed a court appeal, two months after he was suspended for allowing a 
student to pray over the intercom. According to his attorney, Scott 
Thomas of the American Family Association Law Center, Mississippi has 
no grounds for his suspension, and the school district bypassed Knox's 
constitutional right to a fair hearing. Thomas said he hoped to secure 
the back pay Knox was denied. Thomas also indicated his client has 
several job offers. 

"A dry secularism, devoid of mystery and passion, cannot breathe life 
into the values of our nation," Vice President Al Gore said at a 
Richmond, Va., ceremony on the second annual Religious Freedom Day. The 
Council for America's First Freedom established the Jan. 16 holiday, 
recognized by 35 states, as a way to memorialize Thomas Jefferson's 
Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom, passed 208 years ago. The 
vice president said religious faith helps Americans preserve their 
families, ensure safety in their communities, and illuminate the 
important questions of society. In his address, Gore, a Southern 
Baptist, cited modern religious persecution of Muslims in Bosnia, 
Baha'is in Iran, and Shiite Muslims in Iraq. He also decried religious 
hatred between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland, and 
Hindus and Muslims in India. Gore said America's founders recognized 
that "the only way to avoid religious war was to allow religious 
freedom." 

Religious conservatives were visible in the crowd at inaugural events 
for Virginia's new governor, George Allen (NIRR 12/13/93). CBN founder 
Pat Robertson and Republican senatorial hopeful Oliver North were among 
those who attended the Jan. 22 swearing-in ceremony, at which Tom 
Skinner, an urban evangelist and former chaplain for the Washington 
Redskins (which Allen's father coached), gave both the invocation and 
benediction. 
...Allen's Saturday prayer breakfast featured David Barton, an advocate 
of returning religious symbols and prayer to public schools. Critics 
pegged Barton, who home schools his children, as a leader of the 
religious right and proponent of state religion. Allen, who favors 
school choice, did not select Barton as the speaker. "All I know is 
that he quotes the Founding Fathers," the governor, a self-described 
"Jeffersonian conservative," said. Allen added that he did not agree 
with Barton's goal of hanging copies of the 10 Commandments in public 
school classrooms. 

Longtime Republican Randall Terry is asking the religious right to 
divorce the Party. He said the GOP had "used" religious conservatives 
long enough. Since Clinton's election, he said, Republican leaders have 
provided virtually no leadership, and have betrayed their platform of 
support for family values and opposition to abortion. Terry made his 
comments in Washington at the start of a nine-city speaking engagement 
that ended Jan. 23 with The Resistance, a pro-life prayer, lobbying, 
protest, and rescue effort culminating with the annual March for Life. 

Twenty-one years after Roe v. Wade, individuals from churches, 
ministries and families prayed and fasted for 21 days beginning Jan. 1. 
Greater St. Louis Crisis Pregnancy Centers launched the coalition among 
pro-life Protestants and Catholics, said Executive Director Don Riker, 
and issued the grassroots call to prayer and repentance. Intercessors 
For America served as national facilitator. 
...The vigil was designed to satisfy God's desire for repentance, IFA 
President Gary Bergel told NIRR. The 21day period represented the years 
of legal abortion since the Supreme Court decision, but was also a 
biblical pattern practiced by the prophet Daniel, he said. To stay 
focused on one point each day, participants followed a guide "for 
mourning and weeping throughout the land." A daily scriptural text 
(most from the Old Testament) preceded a suggested prayer. Intercessors 
(many of whom wore red armbands or ribbons) were encouraged daily to 
repent of their own sins, pray for others, and proclaim God's Word in 
worship. 
...Those praying honored and mourned those who have been aborted as 
well as encouraged confession and cleansing, but not condemnation, for 
those who had fathered or conceived children who were aborted. A 
written guide included prayers for strengthening families, spiritual 
deliverance of children, and penitence. Many grandmothers, grieved by 
promiscuity and abortion in their families, have prayed to prevent 
further generational damage, he said. 
...The vigil complemented other January pro-life efforts, such as 
Sanctity of Human Life Sunday observations and the annual March for 
Life in Washington. Although the observance was designed not to focus 
on politics, its "spiritual empowerment" may energize pro-life lobbying 
and legislative action, said Bergel, adding that he senses a vast 
American prayer movement that will release healing across the land. 
Bergel said that although it is difficult to ascertain the number of 
participants, IFA mailed information to 5,000 of its prayer-program 
churches (representing about 200,000 members), and 2,100 pro-life and 
200 prayer movement leaders. 

Churches and Christian relief agencies mobilized an immediate response 
to the Jan. 17 Los Angeles earthquake, providing medical care, 
clothing, food, water, and shelter. 
...Seattle-based World Concern focused its efforts on the needs of the 
poor, "those who were already destitute before the disaster struck," 
Director Dick Colenso said. Wheaton, Ill.-based World Relief, the 
assistance arm of the National Association of Evangelicals, was 
providing technical expertise, helping churches identify and prioritize 
needs, and providing financial aid to churches helping earthquake 
victims. CBN's Operation Blessing added $10,000 to its Los Angeles area 
fund, and shipped 10,000 wool blankets to evacuees. Oklahoma City-based 
Feed the Children sent truckloads of emergency supplies such as bottled 
water, food, and hygiene items. Monrovia, Calif.-based World Vision 
established an emergency clearinghouse to meet needs and provide grants 
to low-income families through area churches. Other groups involved 
included Church World Service, Salvation Army, Catholic Charities USA, 
and numerous denominational groups. 
..."Our home is trashed. It looks like a bomb went off," Rebecca DeWitt 
of Thousand Oaks told NIRR. Her husband, Larry, pastors Calvary 
Community Church in Westlake Village. Although several homes of church 
members on her street suffered damage, "nobody's homeless," she said. 
The DeWitts were out of town when the quake hit, and returned to find 
their armoire fallen across their bed. Because the dresser drawers were 
jammed, Larry could reach only one t-shirt. It read, "Build Your Castle 
On The Rock." 
...Doug Posey, one of five "area pastors" for the 3,000-member church, 
told NIRR he called on 23 families in his assigned area. He spent the 
day checking on their needs and offering help. The earthquake was "a 
hit-or-miss kind of thing." In some homes, only pictures fell off the 
walls; in others, televisions flew across the room, he said. 
...This earthquake "knocked me off my feet," said Dwight Elrich of Van 
Nuys, Calif., a veteran of three previous major quakes. A music 
minister at Bel Air Presbyterian Church, Elrich told NIRR his 
condominium looked like a war zone, but he plans to stay. "There's 
nothing left to hit me but the building itself." Van Nuys experienced 
three sharp aftershocks during Elrich's interview with NIRR. 
...Jack Hayford's Church on the Way in Van Nuys programmed its 
answering machine with periodic updates on church functions. "Curfew 
permitting," the message said, the church would hold a Wednesday night 
service of worship and prayer "for our church family, our valley, and 
our city." 

Bible Christian Union (BCU) merged with The Evangelical Alliance 
Mission (TEAM) Jan. 1. at Wheaton, Ill.based TEAM's 104th annual 
conference. BCU International Director George Murray will direct TEAM, 
replacing retiring Richard Winchell. 
...The two missions, both members of the Interdenominational Foreign 
Mission Association, were a natural combination for a merger because 
BCU's ministries in more than a dozen European countries complement 
TEAM's work on other continents, Murray said. The merger will increase 
the ratio of home-to-field staff and give BCU access to TEAM's 
missionary-care operations. BCU, which was founded 90 ago in Estonia, 
will move from Hatfield, Pa., to Wheaton. Even with the costs of 
severance packages and moving headquarters, BCU saved money, Murray 
said. Other missions are talking about merging, but "aren't ready to go 
public," Murray told NIRR. 

Upland, Calif.,-based World Gospel Crusades, Inc., merged with The 
Bible League of South Holland, Ill. WGC'S U.S. offices closed, but the 
operation in Colombia will be maintained as a department of TBL, 
operating in cooperation with DAWN Ministries and the Latin America 
Mission, said TBL's Latin American Director, Edward Meyer. Joseph 
Rogers, president of the 44-year-old WGC, joined TBL's 
scripture-placement ministry as a field director in California. 
...All of Colombia will be reached much faster because of the merger, 
said WGC officials, who voted unanimously for the merger. Field work is 
expanding rapidly, and The Bible League intends to expand its use of 
WGC's saturation evangelism methods to 90 countries where the League 
has its Bible-distribution operations. Biblestudy leaders will be 
trained and indigenous churches will be formed, Meyer said. . . The 
U.S. offices of Asian Outreach closed Dec. 15 because of health and 
financial considerations, said founder Paul Kauffman. Funds for work in 
Asia will be transmitted through Costa Mesa, Calif.,-based Mission 
Ministries. Paul Kauffman. Funds for work in Asia will be transmitted 
through Costa Mesa, Calif.,-based Mission Ministries.

Vol. 8, No. 2                                                       
January 10, 1994 

More than 35,000 public decisions for Christ resulted from a 
cooperative evangelism effort in Argentina from Nov. 23-Dec. 12, 
according to the Huntington Beach, Calif.-based Alberto Mottesi 
Evangelistic Association (AMEA). The Argentine division of Every Home 
for Christ engineered a literature-distribution campaign in 43 cities 
and towns south and north of the capital. The Billy Graham Evangelistic 
Association trained counselors, and AMEA held public crusades in 21 
localities. The Cooperaci n 2000 plan produced the largest-ever 
evangelistic crusade attendance in the northern province of Corrientes. 
A church of 30 people in the city of Bolivar, pastored by Gregorio 
Dominguez, reportedly quadrupled its usual Sunday attendance following 
the crusade. 
...The outreach also experienced occult opposition and major mishaps. 
Luis Alberto, a Baptist pastor in Corrientes, said one of his 
parishioners saw neighbors practicing rituals to thwart the evangelists 
and their projects, according to AMEA. Mottesi told NIRR three leaders 
of the Christian movement suffered serious injuries in auto accidents 
just prior to the campaign, one requiring rescuers to work two hours to 
free a couple from their demolished car. A truck that contained all of 
the printed publicity materials for an area was stolen. When the 
materials were reprinted, they were destroyed by a fire in the home of 
the project's treasurer. 
...Evangelicals will continue to gain respect from societal leaders in 
Latin America, Mottesi said. Prominent leaders of government, industry, 
and culture heard Mottesi and his associate, Nicaraguan lawyer Gustavo 
Sevilla, speak at special breakfasts and banquets. Christian and 
Missionary Alliance pastor Hector Herrera reported that such a spectrum 
of influential people in the southern city of Mar del Plata had never 
been so confronted with the need to make a choice for Christ, and many 
(some with tears in their eyes) signed cards indicating such a 
decision. 
...Argentina's Congress may discard the constitutional requirement for 
a Roman Catholic president and vice president. Negotiations in November 
and December between President Carlos Menem and his predecessor, Raul 
Alfonsin, paved the way for congressional action. Despite Argentine 
evangelicals' objections, the legality of government aid to the 
Catholic church and the mandatory government registration of 
non-Catholic religious groups will not be addressed by the 
congressional action, news sources indicated. 

Mexico's President Carlos Salinas de Gortari initiated a meeting with 
hundreds of Mexico's evangelical pastors Dec. 7, breaking with 
secularist tradition. Salinas hosted a banquet for 500-600 pastors of 
the Mexican Evangelical Confraternity (CONEMEX) at Los Pinos, the 
presidential palace, according to pastor Victor Richards, head of 
Intercessors for Mexico in El Paso, Texas. As the president listened 
attentively, three pastors "spoke from the Word," affirming the need 
for prayer and faith for the Mexican nation, Richards said. Presented 
with a Bible translated into one of Mexico's indigenous languages, 
Salinas wrapped his arms around it saying he would never be able to 
read that copy, but he could appreciate its significance. 
...Before Mexico's 1992 reforms, no religious group or minister had 
legal standing in Mexico, and clergy could not vote. Richards told NIRR 
that one year ago, Salinas hosted evangelicals in lieu of accepting 
their invitation to attend a CONEMEX-sponsored event (NIRR 12/28/92). 
Skeptics doubted that Salinas would follow through on a pledge to open 
annually his doors to the Protestant leaders, but Salinas' initiative 
indicated an increasing openness to evangelicals, Richards said. 

Disabled people in the Third World and Eastern Europe are gaining 
mobility with wheelchairs donated from "the basements, closets, attics, 
and garages of America," according to JAF Ministries, the disability 
outreach of Joni Eareckson Tada. The California-based group has joined 
missionary Mark Richard to launch Wheels for the World. 
..."All I wanted to do was give one lady a wheelchair," Richard told 
NIRR, describing a Guatemalan woman he saw crawling across a muddy 
highway in the rain in 1988. Richard asked a disabled friend in the 
United States if he knew who might donate a used wheelchair to include 
with a load of supplies he was driving to Guatemala. 
...When the word went out, people donated 20 chairs. Macariah, the 
polio-ridden widow he had seen on the road, was overwhelmed when she 
received her chair. Another wheelchair enabled a woman to attend the 
church she could see from her house, he said. Recipients "just weep and 
cry, put up their hands to the Lord, and praise God." . 
...Wheels for the World recently sent 150 more wheelchairs and other 
medical equipment to Guatemala. A boat carrying 100 chairs is now on 
its way to Ghana, and there are requests from Bulgaria and other 
countries. Eight Christian schools in Southern California are starting 
a drive to collect wheelchairs, Richard said. Instead of buying a new 
chair for $2,000, volunteers can collect, refurbish, and deliver a used 
chair for less than $100. 

Since July's terrorism at Capetown's St. James Church, attendance has 
increased, requiring overflow facilities for the South African 
congregation. On July 25, racial separatists threw hand grenades and 
sprayed bullets into the worship service, wreaking bloody mayhem and 
killing 11, including five visiting Russian seamen. After the memorial 
services, 350 people requested evangelistic booklets, according to the 
rector and senior minister, Bishop Frank Retief. He told NIRR that the 
church has received an estimated 1,000 requests for spiritual help 
since the tragedies at midyear. More than 200 people applied for 
membership. 
...The press was puzzled by the lack of hatred or revenge-seeking on 
the part of church members, Retief said. Doctors, police, and 
journalists commented on the sense of peace among the church people the 
night of the attack -even expressions of forgiveness to the unknown 
assailants, news reports said. Retief said several rescue workers, 
police, and reporters have remained in regular contact with the church, 
some attending the services. At least two have made spiritual 
commitments. The congregation, part of the Church of England of South 
Africa, a small evangelical denomination with Anglican roots, is 
providing speakers at inter-faith discussions, schools, and civic 
groups in a new form of witnessing. Clive O'Kill, whose 17-year-old 
son, Richard, died protecting two others, said, "If my son's death 
could be a turning point in the history of South Africa . . . then I'll 
thank God for it." 

Racial reconciliation is spreading through churches, businesses, and 
neighborhoods in Jackson, Miss. Mission Mississippi began last fall 
when 24,000 blacks and whites gathered for rallies in a football 
stadium, signifying a milestone in race relations. Support for the 
movement has ranged from wealthy and influential citizens, including 
Mayor Kane Ditto and Gov. Kirk Fordice, to blue-collar workers. Leaders 
from 66 churches have supported the movement, and local television 
stations and major corporations have offered funding and exposure. 
...Author and businessman Patrick Morley and evangelist Tom Skinner 
spoke to 80,000 people at Jackson schools, business luncheons, and 
rallies. The two men, who organized the movement, have been friends for 
17 years. After a speech at one inner-city school, Morley, who is 
white, and Skinner, who is black, embraced on stage. "There were gasps. 
They'd never seen anything like that before," Morley told NIRR. 
...Mission Mississippi is meant to be more than a few pep rallies. It's 
a 10- to 20-year plan to beat racism one friendship at a time. "The 
problem is that we don't know each other," Morley said. Participants 
have swapped business cards or phone numbers with a person of another 
race and agreed to meet with that person three times for 50 minutes 
over a meal or coffee. A Mission Mississippi Christmas party drew a 
mixed-race crowd of 350 people, and weekly prayer breakfasts and 
monthly prayer rallies are being held, said Lee Paris, chairman of the 
executive board. 

Some 150 volunteers from 38 churches, many of them white, are helping 
build two southwest Mississippi churches to replace those set on fire 
by white teen-agers who targeted their all-black congregations. Both 
churches burned to the ground April 4, the 25th anniversary of Martin 
Luther King's assassination, bringing back memories of the 1960s, when 
200-300 churches burned across the state and racial violence was almost 
a daily fact of life. White teens used hymnals to ignite the first fire 
and screamed racial epithets as flames raced through the second, 
prosecutors said. The three convicted teens will serve federal prison 
sentences, news sources said. 
...Many in Summit, Miss., have come forward with everything from nails 
to cash. A bank in the blue-collar town supplied meeting space until 
the rebuilding, which is financed by donations, is finished. Most 
people feel a lot of wrong has been done over the years, and this was 
one thing they could do to make it right, a volunteer said. 

Just as the early church sanctified Saturnalia into Christmas, Kwanzaa 
has become an additional religious holiday in some black churches. The 
name of the African-American holiday Kwanzaa, is Swahili for "first 
fruits of the harvest," and is celebrated Dec. 26-Jan. 1. Maulana Ron 
Karenga, a California professor and black social activist, established 
the non-religious observance in 1966 to raise cultural awareness among 
African Americans. With seven nights of candle-lighting, blacks 
celebrate, in order, the principles of (1) unity; (2) 
self-determination; (3) collective work and responsibility; (4) 
cooperative economics; (5) purpose; (6) creativity; and (7) faith. 
..."We Christians have sought to shape [Kwanzaa] to be a reflection of 
our journey with Christ," said Los Angeles pastor Andrew 
Robinson-Gaither. His Faith United Methodist Church held a "See Christ 
in Kwanzaa" service, modeled on the "Seven Last Words of Christ" 
program many congregations use. Robinson-Gaither told Religious News 
Service that no black Christian could deny the importance of Kwanzaa's 
seven principles, nor the importance of maintaining both a cultural and 
religious identity during the holiday season. Nationally, other black 
churches, most of them in mainline denominations, have held their own 
celebrations of African-based culture, values, and community, and have 
encouraged individuals and families to do the same. Some clergy have 
made Kwanzaa presentations to schools and churches to share the 
celebration with those outside the black tradition. 
...Like Christmas, Kwanzaa is growing too commercialized for some of 
its 13 million American celebrants. New York City recently hosted a 
Kwanzaa Holiday Expo. News sources said several black leaders were 
displeased by the participation of Anheuser-Busch, AT&T, Hallmark, 
Pepsi-Cola, and Revlon. They said corporate marketing departments 
inappropriately capitalized on a black heritage celebration. Instead, 
they supported African-American businesses that provide Kwanzaa goods. 
Trade experts say the Kwanzaa market reached $100 million this year. 

Focus on the Family seminars have "gotten onto the radar screen of the 
militant homosexuals." John Eldridge, founder of FOF's Community Impact 
Seminars, told NIRR that local activists have protested three of the 
seminars in Washington, Colorado, and southern California. Before a 
Stand Up For The Family seminar in Victoria, British Columbia, a 
women's group circulated pamphlets calling Focus on the Family 
"anti-gay rights, anti-choice, anti-feminism, and extremely racist." 
They urged people to "drown out the voices of intolerance and hatred." 
..."We feel it's a case of mistaken identity," Jeff Kemp told NIRR. 
Kemp represents Washington Family Council, which co-sponsored Community 
Impact Seminars in Bellevue and Spokane and will host one in Tacoma on 
Feb. 5. "Homosexuals think these are political training seminars 
against them. But the content, tone, and spirit are different. Our 
speakers make clear our attitude ought to be cordial and polite." 
Police kept protesters who "brought signs and made noise and stood 
around all afternoon" at the Bellevue seminar from disturbing the 1,200 
who attended, he said. 
..."We're delighted that they come," Eldridge said. "We invite them 
into the seminar. They really have a caricature of what it's about." 
The seminars are designed to promote compassion and loving involvement 
in the lives of homosexuals, he said. Eldridge asked one lesbian what 
she heard in the seminar that promoted hate and intolerance. "Nothing," 
she said.  Although much of government, the courts, media, and 
universities ignore the serious moral discourse that the church calls 
for, individuals within each of these sectors are having "grave second 
thoughts about their presuppositions," said Richard John Neuhaus, 
president of the New York-based Institute for Religion in Public Life. 
...Spiritual inquiries may be expressed "in a fumbling way" since 
"there is a lot of intimidation going on," Neuhaus told NIRR. When 
people do stick their necks out, they should be encouraged, not 
attacked, he said. Although society is "maddeningly confused," and 
Americans are divided and in conflict, Christians have no right to 
despair, Neuhaus said. "I don't think the jig is up -- that's God's 
judgment, not ours." 
...Anti-Catholicism is a compliment to the Church, according to 
Neuhaus, a former Lutheran pastor who now is a Catholic priest. In many 
ways, the Catholic Church still is the most formidable institution that 
defends and advances moral truth, so those who are opposed to these 
truths understandably view the Church as their enemy, Neuhaus told the 
Pittsburgh Catholic, a diocesan newspaper. 

Stories about President Clinton's sexual impropriety have led to 
discussion about how high a standard public figures should meet. 
Reaction to the charges might reveal more about the public and our 
culture than it does about Clinton, said Michael Cromartie, senior 
fellow of Washington, D.C.-based Ethics and Public Policy Center. If 
people say it makes no difference what a person's private virtues or 
vices are, "then it shows how simple-minded we have become," he told 
NIRR. If the allegations are true, they raise serious questions about 
the president's character, which has important implications for public 
policy decisions, he said. Also, if they are true, then this overtly 
religious president exhibits a seemingly sharp disconnection between 
his public professions and his private behavior, Cromartie said. "That 
is politically dangerous, and -- more importantly -- pastorally sad." 

Fifty-nine percent of Canadians define themselves as "spiritual" but 
not "religious," according to a study of English-speaking Canadians 
commissioned by several television networks. The 1991 Statistics Canada 
study reported in the Toronto Globe and Mail revealed that while 80% 
consider religion important, only 44% think the same of belonging to a 
religious group. As church attendance continues its decline, 83% say 
attendance does not prove one's faith. At the same time, 70% say they 
have constructed their "own personal religion." 

"Maybe the economic tightening is God's way of drawing our attention to 
a new way of acting ecumenically," said Bruce McLeod, president of the 
Canadian Council of Churches. Officials say the organization, which 
comprises 19 denominations, has been losing revenue steadily over the 
last three years, and funds may be drained to less than $15,000 by the 
end of 1994. Increasing expenditures also have contributed to the 
financial woes, Religious News Service reported. Member churches, which 
give grants to support the CCC, have experienced their own economic 
difficulties, and the situation has forced the council to use reserve 
funds accumulated during the 1980s. The CCC has formed a committee to 
consider how to stabilize its finances. McLeod said a realistic 
consideration of the situation gives the CCC's churches an opportunity 
"to engage each other about their visions and priorities." 

The National Council of Churches wants more participation from 
Pentecostals, evangelicals, and Roman Catholics. In 1994, the NCC will 
reach beyond its current membership, newly installed NCC President 
Gordon Sommers told NIRR. He noted that past conversations of this 
nature have been led by Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Bishop 
Herbert Chilstrom (NIRR 9/20/93). The ecumenical commitment to 
discussions on faith and unity in Christ will benefit from the 
publication of the Catholic edition of the New Revised Standard 
Version, he said. 
...The ecumenical movement is pained by its tight funding, Sommers 
noted, adding that all social institutions have had to adjust from the 
well-financed projects of the past. However, commitment to Church World 
Services remains high, he said. Change is a part of life, and when 
organizations fail to change, they are doomed to extinction, he said. 
In 1994, the National Council of Churches will continue to examine 
proposals for change, with the goal of involving its entire membership 
in the work toward universal Christian unity, Sommers said. 

The Episcopal Church plans more staff layoffs at its New York 
headquarters. In a Dec. 21 letter, Presiding Bishop Edmond Browning 
warned of impending terminations because of diminished financial 
resources. The denomination is projecting a $4- to $5-million shortfall 
in 1995. Browning asked top staff to discuss the proposed budget 
changes with supervisors and assess the implications for their work. 
The church's Executive Council is expected to act at its January 
meeting on a budget, which will be reviewed by the General Convention 
in August. 
...The layoffs would be the second staff shakeup of the 1990s. Two 
years ago the church eliminated about 20% of its staff positions at 
national headquarters because of budgetary shortfalls. Episcopal 
financial difficulties are being caused mostly by the growing tendency 
among parishes to keep more of their offerings for use locally. Only 33 
of the denomination's 118 dioceses fulfilled their most recent 
fiscal-year obligations to the national church. 
...The General Convention set the 1994 budget at about $27.8 million, 
pared down from $34 million because of the shortfalls. The 1995 budget 
may have to be set at between $22.7 million and $24.1 million to make 
up for the lack of funds, according to Ellen Coke, Episcopal Church 
treasurer. 
...The financial crisis comes amid reports of increasing 
dissatisfaction at local and regional levels with the national church. 
Critics say national church programs are politically driven by special 
interest groups. Critics also are calling for cutbacks in national 
church staff and programs, and asking that church headquarters be moved 
out of New York to a less expensive location. Others have called for a 
smaller General Convention with less-frequent meetings and a limit on 
legislation to be processed. 
..."I believe the decline represents the judgment of God," said Jon 
Shuler, executive director of the Shaping Our Future Symposium in St. 
Louis. Membership in the Episcopal Church in recent years, 
"institutional inertia," and confusion about what it all means, has led 
to depression and despair around the country, he said. Nevertheless, 
the best days lie ahead, because "God wants His church to grow," Shuler 
told the Central Florida Episcopalian. 

Not enough clergy understand the importance of belief in a 
pre-tribulation rapture, PreTrib Study Group Chairman Tim LaHaye told 
NIRR. The group, dedicated to championing the position, held its second 
annual meeting Dec. 14-16 in Dallas. Last year's meeting, sponsored by 
Harvest House Publishers, was kept secret to prevent endtime extremists 
and date-setters from bombarding the group with requests and materials, 
he said. 
...The "dean of prophecy scholars," Dallas Theological Seminary's John 
Walvoord, addressed this year's meeting, as did Dwight Pentecost, 
Charles Ryrie, Kay Arthur, Hal Lindsey, and others in discussing 15 
"timely prophetic issues." The 65 prophecy scholars, Christian 
educators, and authors were selected as representatives of their 
schools, ministries, and publishers. They tend to be biblical 
literalists who believe Christ will return before a seven-year 
Tribulation, during which the Antichrist is to rule. Because the 
pre-trib position crosses denominational lines, members range from 
fundamentalists to mainliners to charismatics. For next year's December 
meeting in Dallas, members will be permitted to invite a potential 
member. 
...A permanent research center will serve as a prophecy think-tank. The 
center (which will be funded by donations from congregations, 
organizations, and individuals) will promote the pre-trib position with 
publications, conferences, and other activities to help tell the church 
that Christ could return at any time. The group said that consciousness 
of an imminent rapture historically has (1) encouraged holy living in 
an unholy age; (2) increased interest in world missions; and (3) 
fostered greater dedication to evangelism and soul winning. 
...LaHaye said too few young pastors have sufficient grounding in 
prophecy to feel comfortable preaching on the subject. The center hopes 
to provide a cassette-of-the-month club featuring prophecy scholars and 
inspirational pre-trib speakers to help pastors speak more 
authoritatively on the one-third of the Bible that is prophetic. The 
center also will help counteract the "rash of unscriptural and harmful 
speculation" that members expect to plague the church as a new 
millennium approaches. Next year the group hopes to publish a book 
giving "pre-trib answers to post-trib questions," LaHaye said. His 
Washington-based Family Life Ministries temporarily will house the 
research center. Evangelical author and pastor Tommy Ice will serve as 
Executive Director, starting March 1. 

A scholar whose study of Jesus touched off a furor has received an 
endowed chair worth $3 million. Oregon State University Professor 
Marcus Borg, an OSU philosophy professor and member of the 
controversial Jesus Seminar, received a $1.5 million donation from Al 
Hundere, a San Antonio aviation engineer and 1938 Oregon State 
graduate. The state of Oregon will match the grant to create one of the 
richest chairs in religious studies. 
...The money is to be used to fund lectures and conferences at the 
university, hire additional professors in religious studies, fund a 
program on ethics, science, and the environment, and give Borg a raise. 
The Jesus Seminar studied the Bible in an effort to determine the 
authenticity of the words attributed to Jesus. The panel concluded that 
Jesus probably said only about 20% of statements attributed to him, and 
that the rest were added by the early Christian community. The Jesus 
Seminar published "The Five Gospels," an edition of the four 
traditionally accepted gospels and the Gospel of Thomas, a text 
discovered in 1945 that church authorities have not accepted as 
authentic. 

"This was no Christian meeting," said Faye Short about the RE-Imagining 
conference partially sponsored by national agencies of the United 
Methodist Church. Short, who represents the Evangelical Coalition for 
United Methodist Women (ECUMW), said the four-day November meeting was 
heretical, neo-pagan, and blasphemous. About 2,150 women and 60 men 
(nearly half of whom were Methodists or Presbyterians) from 27 
countries joined in Minneapolis for the conference, designed to 
celebrate the midpoint of World Council of Churches' Ecumenical Decade 
of the Churches in Solidarity With Women. 
...Speakers, most of them feminist theologians, led participants in 
"re-imagining" a church where everyone shares common visions of 
spirituality. Attendees borrowed from Native American and Eastern 
faiths, in what critics called a syncretic approach to Christianity. 
CLOUT (NIRR 3/11/91) held an unscheduled rally in which about 100 women 
joined to "celebrate the miracle" of being Christian Lesbians Out 
Together. Most critics, including Short, especially noted an unorthodox 
liturgical blessing and communion-like service using milk and honey. 
The ceremony invoked the wisdom spirit of "Sophia, Creator God" in a 
celebration of women's sensuality and "warm body fluids," the Institute 
on Religion and Democracy (an ECUMW group) reported. In the UMC's Good 
News, Short called for the directors of the church's Women's Division 
"to repudiate and repent" of its support. 
...Themes of goddess worship and the invalidity of the concept of sin 
were pervasive, said Presbyterian Layman Editor Parker Williamson. 
Because the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) helped fund the conference 
with a grant of more than $65,000 from its Bicentennial Fund, several 
regional sessions have voted to withhold financial contributions to the 
denomination's Louisville, Ky., headquarters. Other Presbyterians have 
launched church actions to fire staffers who backed the conference, 
which also received funding from national agencies of the Evangelical 
Lutheran Church in America, the American Baptist Church, and the United 
Church of Christ. 

Santeria is gaining popularity among white middle-class professionals. 
"Anglo-Saxon Americans have become heavily involved" in the Afro-Cuban 
religion, which uses magical herbal prescriptions, healing, spiritism, 
and animal sacrifice (NIRR 6/28/93), according to scholar, author, and 
former Santeria priest Raul Canizares. 
..."A lot of white people do it to get ahead in their careers," he told 
NIRR. "The magical component" helps alter events or one's fate, said 
Canizares, who teaches a course on Santeria at the University of 
Florida in South Tampa. An estimated 1 million Americans practice the 
religion, which began in Nigeria and was brought to the 
Spanish-speaking Caribbean by Yoruba slaves. Santeria is practiced most 
widely in Hispanic communities from Miami to New York to Chicago. 
...Santeria's gods are not immortal and must be fed, he said. Animals 
are killed as part of rituals for birth, death, marriage and the 
initiation of priests. Blood is offered to the gods, and the meat is 
cooked and eaten by worshipers of such deities as Shango, the god of 
thunder and lightning; Elegba, the god of destiny; and Ogun, the god of 
war. Santeria, whose followers have disguised their beliefs by adopting 
the trappings of Catholicism, ordinarily is practiced secretly in homes 
rather than churches. Most initiates are sworn to a code of silence. 
..."It is not just Santeria. A lot of alternative religions are 
attaining popularity. Wicca is growing at a tremendous rate, too," said 
Canizares, a Cuban native who was initiated into the priesthood at age 
7, had spent 10 years, three hours a day, studying its oral traditions. 
Canizares, whose "religion now is academia," recorded many of those 
traditions in his book Walking with the Night. Although it was written 
as a scholarly treatise, "people are using it almost as a sacred text," 
he said. 

Samuel McClellan can drink wine at Communion, despite his status as a 
Colorado inmate. Prison authorities settled his November lawsuit, which 
alleged that their rules against using intoxicants on or off prison 
property infringed upon his First Amendment right to freedom of 
religion. He said officials refused to exempt him, even though a sip of 
wine would not cause drunkenness. McClellan, whose sentences for 
forgery and theft total seven years, has been allowed to leave the 
facility for Sunday services at St. Mark's Church in Craig, where the 
prison is located. He says he is a devout Episcopalian and an active 
and faithful member of the church, assists the pastor in various 
activities, sometimes as church organist or a lay reader. Under the 
agreement, McClellan, 64, may drink consecrated wine at Eucharist, but 
must agree to submit to drug testing should officials suspect 
intoxication. 

Christian media insiders say the Mormons and psychic hot lines are 
doing something right: they advertise. Mainline churches could 
evangelize more easily and help reverse sagging memberships by taking 
to the airwaves, Cathy Sargent Mester of Pennsylvania State University 
at Erie said in a paper she presented at the National Conference on 
Christianity and Communication, held at Regent University in Virginia 
Beach. Although Methodists, Presbyterians, and Lutherans sponsor some 
programs on the Faith and Values cable network and on radio, the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints still provides the strongest and 
most successful model. Its well-crafted television ads are stimulating 
but non-threatening, and portray a "we-can-help" attitude, she said. 
...Mester suggested that denominations look past the problems they have 
found with television advertising: high costs and, especially, negative 
attitudes. She said TV is not just the "moral villain" many mainline 
churchgoers have thought. Churches should budget some of their missions 
dollars to participate in a "media revolution," since families have 
become increasingly dependent upon television to meet various needs. If 
denominations don't join, she said, their goals may go unmet. 
...Pathway Press has produced campaigns for the Church of God 
(Cleveland, Tenn.) that its local churches can easily adapt for 
individualized use. Two of its generic print ads read "We'll Altar Your 
Problems" and "The Perfect Church For People Who Aren't." A special 
holiday ad shows a tie in a box, but reminds viewers that "Eternal Life 
Is A Gift You'll Never Have To Return." Vince Stone of the 
Tennessee-based company said in the denomination's Evangel magazine 
that the only denominations using advertising as a serious outreach are 
the Mormon and Episcopal Churches, both of which have had successful 
commercial campaigns. 
...Stone suggests how denominations can advertise best: (1) Aim to 
produce high-quality ads that are simple, creative, and memorable. If 
necessary, hire a professional or agency; (2) see the costs as a 
long-term investment; (3) realize effective ads need not be electronic 
(print ad production is usually cheaper than electronic, and local 
newspapers provide good coverage and cost efficiency); (4) expect to 
run multiple or repeated ads. Recall generally sets in after three 
viewings or hearings; (5) run newspaper ads on pages where other church 
ads do not appear (not on the religion pages); and (6) produce 
follow-up materials that relate to the ads and draw people back to the 
church. Welcoming packets, visitation committees, or a pastoral letter 
of welcome have been effective, Stone says. 

More than 2,000 people packed Manhattan's Marble Collegiate Church to 
honor Norman Vincent Peale. He had a stroke and died at home Christmas 
Eve at the age of 95. Ordained as a Methodist, Peale changed to the 
Reformed Presbyterian Church in America in order to assume the Marble 
Collegiate pastorate, which he held for 52 years. In addition, Peale 
was a world renowned and prolific author, editor of Guideposts 
magazine, and popular radio personality. He also was a personal friend 
of several presidents, including Richard Nixon, who attended the 
service. 
...Peale was criticized and hailed for simplifying biblical concepts 
into popular phrases; questioning the appropriateness of the Catholic 
John Kennedy's presidency; and revolutionizing Christian counseling 
with his American Foundation of Religion and Psychiatry. At the 
service, Peale's widow, Ruth, announced plans to distribute copies of 
his 1952 best-seller, The Power of Positive Thinking, to churches, 
corporations, drug rehabilitation centers, and self-help groups across 
the country in hopes that it "might make a difference in this 
generation." Representatives at the church told NIRR that all memorial 
donations would go to help the work of the Peale Center for Christian 
Living, founded in 1940 in Pawling, N.Y., the author's hometown. 

A first-ever Christian "baseball fantasy camp" was a big hit with 
participants. Campers worked out and received instruction from 13 
current or former pros, including the Montreal Expos' Gary Carter and 
the Atlanta Braves' Joe Alvarez. They also played intra-squad games, 
and attended conferences in the evening led by Steven Lawson, who is a 
pastor, author, and former sports writer. 
...The Florida camp gave men 25 and older the chance to live out 
childhood dreams, and have fellowship with Christian baseball players 
without the rowdy parties that may occur at secular baseball fantasy 
camps, Athletes In Action Baseball Director Ron Hobar told NIRR. 
Because many men love sports, competition, and winning, they often find 
themselves feeling far more passionate about athletic or business 
pursuits than they do about their walk with Christ, he said. A final 
game at Osceola County Stadium, in Kissimmee drew about 250 fans, 12 of 
whom accepted the Lord, Hobar said. Also, when two players entered the 
stands to sign autographs, three fans they spoke to returned the next 
day having given their lives to the Lord. 
...Organizers say they are not discouraged by the low turnout for the 
camp -- 21 men -- and plan to attract more participants, possibly by 
reducing the $2,395 cost of the six-day camp, planned for December 1994 
or early in 1995. 

"We're seeing an incredible number of people come to Jesus Christ," 
recording artist Stephen Tavani told NIRR. He and his wife, Linda, say 
they have received "lots of letters from people who wouldn't ordinarily 
listen to Christian music," but who heard their first album, Urban 
Missionaries. "A lot of prayer went into that record," he said. 
...Stephen, who is white, used to write music for Smokey Robinson and 
TV specials, and Linda, who is black, was "Peaches" of the 1970s pop 
music duo Peaches and Herb. Now they travel with evangelists Nicky Cruz 
and Mario Murillo, and sing at rescue missions, schools, prisons, 
military bases, and nightclubs, as well as on the street. "People are 
hungry," he said. "They respond to an unpolluted, uncompromising gospel 
presentation." 
...Since beginning their Winning Our World (WOW) ministry six years 
ago, the Tavanis have seen 27,000 people -- 7,000 of them gang members 
-- come to Christ. In a Fort Worth federal prison, 21 of the 24 gang 
members at their Jan. 3 concert became believers. One was a noted 
Colombian drug dealer. A month ago, concerts in five Chicago gang 
districts resulted in 1,600 conversions. Tavani said that in 
documenting conversions, they "make sure people understand what they're 
doing and are really ready to repent." 
...The couple's secular background keeps the media open to their 
message, Tavani said. They pray with reporters before and after every 
interview. While ministering with Cruz in San Antonio (NIRR 11/1/93), 
one of their staff members was mugged and shot to death in front of her 
9-year-old son. In a news conference after the slaying, Tavani gave an 
altar call and several responded. "Only Jesus can fill up all those 
little places inside where it's so lonely. We have a heart for people 
who would never come to a church. You have to aggressively and 
creatively go get them," Tavani said. 

Students from 18 states and three countries spent part of their 
Christmas holidays praying and developing strategies for reaching their 
classmates for Christ. At the three-day Something's Happening USA 
conference, sponsored by churches and Christian youth organizations in 
San Diego, Calif., and the National Network of Youth Ministries, 
students listened to nine national youth leaders, including authors 
Josh McDowell and Jacob Aranza, Mike MacIntosh of Horizon Christian 
Fellowship, and Concerts of Prayer leader David Bryant. 
..."I never knew before I came here the extreme importance of prayer," 
a Rhode Island student wrote to conference sponsors. "I'm going home 
unafraid and excited to share God's word." A student from Tennessee 
said he had learned about prayer and spiritual warfare "in an 
incredible way." Former NFL player Miles McPherson told conferees, "God 
will change your generation one heart at a time." 
...Seeing 850 kids pray together over their vacations was "pretty 
amazing," said Barry St. Clair, executive director of Reach Out 
Ministries in Norcross, Ga. St. Clair, who attended with his 9th-grade 
son, told NIRR he sensed a real interest in "practical and hands-on" 
particulars of prayer and evangelism. Children are gathering to 
worship, praise, and pray to discover what God would have them do on 
their campuses, he said. "I think this is a foretaste of what we'll 
begin to see happening across the country." 

Urbana '93:  Twentysomethings  Consider  Missions By Jo Kadlecek 

More than 17,000 young people from 77 countries braved bitter cold to 
attend Urbana '93, InterVarsity Christian Fellowship's triennial 
missions conference. According to IVCF-Urbana Executive Director Dan 
Harrison, 25% of the delegates were post-college, young professionals, 
25% were Asian Americans, and 10% were international students. "The 
color of the mission force, like the world, is changing," he said. The 
delegates (most of them college students on break) attended workshops 
and multi-media seminars. All over the University of Illinois campus, 
275 mission agencies, Bible colleges, and seminaries were on hand to 
discuss ministry opportunities. Urbana organizers targeted seven focus 
areas for exhibits and workshops: five dealt with ministering to 
Buddhists, children/youth, Hindus, the Tribal world, and Muslims; and 
two covered hunger/development, and "tentmaking" evangelism. 
...Urbana '93 was designed for a new generation of students, IVCF 
President Steve Hayner said. Featured were a more culturally diverse 
worship team, multi-media presentations, trained pastoral counselors, 
and 1,700 small discussion groups that met twice a day for Bible study 
and prayer. Urbana hosted about 300 workshops and as many exhibits, 
many on the challenges of communicating to a world that denies 
absolutes. Women and people of color had high visibility, as did 
Broadway actor/IVCF staffer Bruce Kuhn. He dramatized passages from 
John's Gospel, and led workshops at which hundreds expressed desires to 
minister in the arts. Organizers chose "real people from the mission 
field" to speak rather than have "big names" as a drawing card, IVCF 
Board Chairwoman Karen Mains told NIRR. "InterVarsity is concerned 
about how we make Christianity relevant in our culture and on 
campuses," she said. 
...This generation sees hopelessness all around them, which gives them 
great openness to the Gospel, said Geri Rodman, IVCF staff worker at 
the University of California-Berkeley. Harrison's assistant Paula 
Esealuka told reporters that she and other youth do not think they can 
change the world, but "do think we can change our neighbors." Chicago 
IVCF member Brenda Salter-McNeill told NIRR the twentysomethings will 
"call the church back to integrity" because they will no longer 
tolerate the broken promises and relationships so many have 
experienced. Harrison said, "This generation is ready to commit, and is 
getting involved in record numbers," but are serving on short-term 
missions before they decide on careers. He said these global and 
urban-living experiences stretch young lives. 
...More than 150 members of international student movements attended 
Urbana '93. Most belonged to the International Fellowship of 
Evangelical Students. IFES, a worldwide interdenominational fellowship 
of autonomous national student movements, links movements in more than 
120 countries. More than 300 foreign students from 60 nations stayed in 
Urbana for an additional four-day conference for Christian 
international students. The conference concluded with a two-hour prayer 
meeting during which participants prayed with fellow nationals. 
...The conference also spotlighted ministries to people with 
disabilities. Joni Eareckson Tada, herself a quadriplegic, addressed 
hundreds at six workshops. She told NIRR that technological and medical 
advances allow more people to survive injuries, but the church has been 
slow to meet the special needs, struggles, and hurdles of persons with 
disabilities. Pastors should be ready because "disabled people will 
inevitably come to their congregations," Eareckson Tada said. She said 
that students came to her workshops "not because of me, but because of 
a passion for the disabled. That's different from the last Urbana." 
..."The world is getting younger, yet resources are being spent on 
adults, and we're ignoring children," Harrison said. Even though 
children are more responsive to the Gospel, it is difficult to find 
children's missions workers, or cooperative missions efforts similar to 
those that commonly reach teens or college students, he said. One way 
to reach children, according to Food For the Hungry missionary Paul 
Arneson, is through popular culture. He also said opportunities abound 
to help the overlooked or "throwaway children" -- street urchins, 
girls, or the disabled. 
...Of Asian American communities, 97% are unchurched, according to 
former IVCF staff worker Peter Cha, a Korean-American. He said the Los 
Angeles riots were a wake-up call to the fast-growing Korean church in 
America, noting that Korean-Americans have vast economic and 
educational resources that could be used to improve the community. Cha 
called for racial reconciliation and friendship evangelism on campuses. 
Hundreds of Christian professors and graduate students from secular 
universities met to discuss strategies to impact their campuses. 
...Racial reconciliation took many forms. In one plenary session, the 
17,000 Urbana delegates knelt to repent corporately for racism and 
ethnic ignorance. Others, like Navajo college student Doug Katenay, 
described their crosscultural experiences. Katanay and 20 others taught 
English to Mongolian university students on a month-long IVCF mission 
trip to Ulan Bator last summer. "The Mongolian people thought they had 
a lot in common with us," he said. At least three Mongolians professed 
new faith in Christ as a result of the project. At least three 
Mongolians professed new faith in Christ as a result of the project.

Vol. 8, No. 1                                                      
December 27, 1993 

Representatives from 22 denominations met for a Dec. 9-11 missions 
summit to discuss their goals, strategies, and progress in world 
evangelism. Hosted by AD 2000 and Beyond in Colorado Springs, leaders 
from evangelical, Pentecostal, and mainline denominations, as well as 
independent charismatic fellowships, joined leaders from 30 parachurch 
ministries. 
...Prayer has become a priority in many of the denominations, as has 
sending missionaries to mega-cities by the year 2000, according to the 
reports. Youth work, development of indigenous leadership, church 
planting, and reaching Cambodia were other priorities. After several 
reports, Ralph Winter of the U.S. Center for World Missions noted that 
"the differences in theological emphasis don't have a lot to do with 
the work going on in missions overseas." 
...Of the world's 12,000 people groups, 6,000 have professing 
Christians; 1,800 have some mission activity, but no breakthrough; and 
1,200 have no Christian influence whatsoever, Patrick Johnstone, 
chairman of AD 2000's Unreached Peoples Resource Network, told the 
leaders. He said interdenominational field ministries and intercessory 
prayer networks will be keys to reaching the 2,000 least-evangelized 
groups. Johnstone suggested building on the momentum of the successful 
10/40 Window prayer effort and the upcoming Day to Change the World "to 
focus informed, persevering prayer on these remaining hard-core 
segments of the unreached." 
...Six new churches are born every day in South Korea, but only 3-5% of 
Asia's population is Christian," said Bong Rin Ro of the World 
Evangelism Fellowship Theological Commission in Seoul. Rin Ro said Asia 
has three church-growth rates. First is rapid growth, most obvious in 
Korea, China, and Indonesia -- where 20% of the population is 
Christian. "The church there is alive, but [Christians] experience 
great oppression from radical Muslims and government officials." 
Second, slow growth is seen primarily in Japan (with a 0.9% Christian 
population) and Thailand (with 0.5%). Malaysia is experiencing a rapid 
exodus of the Christian population to Australia, the United States, and 
Europe because of persecution by Muslims. Third is minimal growth, if 
any. This is most common in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, Rin Ro reported. 

The most serious attempt in history to obliterate religion has been 
followed by its most dramatic revival, according to sociologist Andrew 
Greeley. His report on the religious views of nearly 3,000 Russians was 
released this month by the National Opinion Research Center at the 
University of Chicago (NIRR 5/31). 
...Although most Russians have lived all their lives under socialism, 
some 22% said they recently have come out of atheism into belief in a 
God who concerns Himself with every human being personally. An 
additional 25% said they always have believed. Younger generations were 
more highly represented in the recent conversion category, whereas 
older Russians were more numerous among longtime believers. Roughly 
twice as many women were new converts to theism as were men. About 
two-thirds of all the theists considered themselves believers in 
Russian Orthodoxy. Religion researcher David Barrett welcomed the 
study, part of the International Social Survey Program, as the first 
batch of "solid information" about religion in Russia today. Some 75% 
of Russians profess a great deal of confidence in the church, but 43% 
say the church should stay out of politics. 
...Other traditional Christian beliefs and practices proved to be less 
popular than the 47% rate of theism in general. Some 40% of the 
Russians polled believed in life after death, with 33% reporting belief 
in heaven, and 30% believing in hell. While 25% pray at times, 10% said 
they pray daily. Only 32% ever attend church services, including the 8% 
of Russians who attend at least once a month. 

Russia's Dec. 12 elections yielded mixed results for religious 
Russians, says an American interfaith group that monitored the voting 
from Moscow. Among the more ominous effects, they said, was the 
election of ultra-nationalist parliamentarians, led by Vladimir 
Zhirinovsky. Rabbi Arthur Schneier, president of the Appeal of 
Conscience Foundation, said at a news conference that the outspoken 
politician's rise to power is evidence of the "increasing divisiveness 
in Russian society." Schneier said the election results were more a 
vote of protest against President Boris Yeltsin and his democratic 
reforms than support for Zhirinovsky. Leonid Kishkovsky, ecumenical 
officer for the Orthodox Church in America, said he doubts most 
Russians will agree with Zhirinovsky's extreme positions: the inclusion 
of Alaska in a reconstructed Russian empire, support for Iraq's Saddam 
Hussein, blaming Jews for Russia's rising anti-Semitism, and a 
proclamation that he is "tyrant" who "will follow in Hitler's 
footsteps." 
...Although Russians adopted a constitution that guarantees religious 
freedom, many Western groups may be wise to change the ways they 
evangelize in Russia, according to Robinson Mitchell of the Association 
of Christian Missions (ACM). An affiliate of the Church of God, 
(Cleveland, Tenn.), the ACM is the evangelism arm of the formerly 
unregistered Pentecostal churches in the Commonwealth of Independent 
States, and has a Moscow office. A hallmark of the constitution is 
freedom of conscience, including the right for individuals and groups 
to profess any, or no, religion. It also allows citizens to spread 
their religious beliefs, all of which are equal before the law, but 
forbids claiming the superiority of, or speaking against, any faith. 
This makes apologetics all the more important, Mitchell told NIRR. To 
slow the growth of cults, which often focus on new converts, missions 
groups and denominations will need to become "evangelical ecumenicals," 
and focus on the non-negotiable tenets of Christianity they share, he 
said. 
...Russia's general climate toward foreign missions efforts could 
thwart support for religious freedom, Mitchell said. Russians are 
tiring of the well-financed Western groups that practice "Christian 
colonialism" in the larger cities, he said. In an effort to save the 
masses, these groups offer free humanitarian aid and Bibles, then tout 
their evangelistic successes on American TV, even though Russians will 
accept almost anything that is free because of economic uncertainty. 
Mitchell said these groups rarely cooperate with local churches, or 
have education programs for new converts. As a result, many citizens, 
especially in Moscow, are losing interest in attending gospel rallies. 
Mitchell said ministries that focus on long-term church development, 
administration, and discipleship (as well as training for indigenous 
Christian leaders to lead churches and reach the roughly 130 different 
people groups in the C.I.S.) will do the most to begin a 
self-propagating, self-sustaining missions movement in Russia. 

Lutherans are launching a three-year, $98.7-million evangelism 
campaign. The goals are to recruit and train 100,000 volunteers across 
the United States, expand operations in television, radio and print, 
and increase outreach overseas. Already $15 million has been collected 
for the campaign, which officially starts in January. 
...Emphasis is on getting more people into the pews, not just being a 
national program with little benefit to local congregations, Lutheran 
Church-Missouri Synod officials said. The denomination hopes the 
campaign will encourage 1.2 million additional people to at least visit 
Lutheran churches by the year 2000. The 2.6-million LC-MS, the more 
conservative of the nation's two major Lutheran bodies, has maintained 
an even membership over the past 30 years. 
..."Go, Tell a NEW Generation," is the biggest thing ever to come out 
of the Missouri Synod side of Lutheranism, said Dale Meyer, principal 
speaker on The Lutheran Hour weekly radio broadcasts. "People have been 
[stuck] in idle, but now they'll have the chance to put it into gear," 
he told NIRR. International Lutheran Layman's League, an auxiliary 
ministry of the church and a sponsor of the radio ministry program, is 
sponsoring the campaign. 
...Volunteers will conduct workshops in local churches, operate mobile 
educational units, and respond to inquiries from the public. They also 
will distribute written materials that suggest the church has valuable 
insights to share. 
...An advertising initiative will expand North American media 
ministries and strengthen programs in former communist-bloc countries, 
China, and Muslim nations. The Layman's League plans to begin a 
30-minute television talk show; On Main Street will feature Meyer 
interacting with a live audience about biblical insights on current 
social issues. In addition, Living for Tomorrow ads, which focus on the 
problems of everyday life and encourage people to contact local 
congregations for help, will be expanded. The ads appear in print, on 
television, and on radio. 
...The last phase of the initiate will expand on the Layman League's 
work overseas. The league distributes cassette tapes to Chinese 
Christians, and transports food, clothing, medical supplies, and 
equipment to orphanages, hospitals and churches. Radio and television 
broadcasts also may be beamed to Latvia, Ghana, Cuba, and Slovakia. 

Black and white Pentecostal denominations, operating separately for 
eight decades, are seeking to restore unity. The themes of forgiveness 
and reconciliation rang clearly at a recent Atlanta convention of the 
Pentecostal Fellowship of North America (PFNA) attended by 3,000 black 
and white Christians in Atlanta, according to Pentecostal historian 
Vinson Synan. The PFNA was founded in 1948 by white denominations that 
separated from African-American Pentecostals between 1908 and 1924. 
All, however, claimed ties to the racially integrated movement in Los 
Angeles: the 1906 revival at the Azusa Street Mission led by black 
pastor William Seymour. The current PFNA leadership and black 
Pentecostal leaders have been deliberating on the need for 
reconciliation, which Church of God in Christ Bishop Gilbert Patterson 
and Foursquare pastor Jack Hayford acknowledged. 
...If necessary, the 45-year-old association of 19 denominations will 
disband as a first step in a plan to "bring back the unity," PFNA 
Chairman E.B. Underwood told NIRR. A task force of 20 white PFNA 
representatives and 20 black Pentecostal leaders will meet in January 
to plan steps toward unity by October 1994. We "allowed the culture to 
divide" us, Underwood said, but PFNA leaders feel "there's a divine 
hand at work, something very special going on. We're getting a second 
chance." 

Southern Baptists are concerned about a two-year decline in the number 
of baptisms they have performed. According to Steve Whitten of the Home 
Mission Board, 1993 baptisms declined to 350,000, down from 367,000 in 
1992 and 397,000 in 1991. The estimate was based on interviews with 
state directors of evangelism. 
...The study showed that 3% of the churches accounted for nearly 24% of 
the baptisms. Churches reporting few baptisms typically had memberships 
of fewer than 100, and were located in rural areas. 
...The situation shows "a desperate need for revival," Darrell 
Robinson, Home Mission Board vice president, told Baptist Press. Every 
church needs an intentional strategy for evangelism and a goal for 
baptisms, he said. 
...A 60-day soul-winning thrust, in which Southern Baptists will be 
asked to share Christ at least 60 times, is planned from Jan. 9 to 
March 30. Churches then will have a "harvest revival" between March 12 
and Sept. 30, denominational leaders say. 

From Jan. 1 through Feb. 8, Southern Baptists will ask God to help Bill 
Clinton. Last month the denomination mailed copies of Pray for the 
President to its 40,000 pastors for use in their churches. The 40-day 
guide encourages intercessors to pray that God will give the President 
and Vice President Al Gore wisdom, resistance to temptation, 
self-control, the ability to be models of Christian leadership, and 
courage to stand for what is right. The booklet suggests brief 
Scripture readings, and directs those praying to focus on a current 
event that would benefit from God's intervention. Since its 
publication, Clinton has been accused by Arkansas state troopers of 
sexual improprieties. 
...Harmony Baptist Church pastor Richard Lay wrote the booklet when he 
tired of Clinton-bashing after last year's elections. He told Baptist 
Press that friction over Christian values and longtime Democratic party 
loyalties had disturbed the spirit of his 150-member St. Louis 
congregation. When he realized his own lack of prayer for the nation's 
leaders had not helped, he wrote the guide. The Southern Baptist 
Brotherhood Commission began offering the 35 , tract-sized booklet July 
4, and has distributed tens of thousands since. SBC President Ed Young 
gave a copy to Clinton in a September prayer meeting at the White House 
(NIRR 10/4). 

"Legislators are loving it -- they are so grateful," Michigan Prayer 
Network coordinator Susan Sorensen told NIRR. The network links 
legislators with a volunteer, who telephones regularly to take prayer 
requests, which then are shared confidentially with a group in the 
network. 
...Michigan organizers believe it is the first such network in the 
country. The prayer network is nonsectarian and nonpartisan, and is 
intended only to be supportive, Executive Director Randall Hekman said. 
It is organized by The Family Forum, a Lansing-based nonprofit 
educational and research organization that promotes Christian values. 
...All 148 Michigan state legislators received a letter asking if they 
wanted a prayer partner, and 90% said yes, Sorensen said. Currently 110 
have a prayer partner. "Anyone who knows our Legislature knows they 
need all the help they can get," Howard Simon, executive director of 
the Michigan American Civil Liberties Union, told the Detroit Free 
Press. The Legislature is beset by partisan feuds and special 
interests. 
...One senator's prayer partner has 49 people joining her in prayer as 
he shares requests, with different intercessors praying each day of the 
month. One representative nearly cried when her prayer partner spoke 
with her on the phone for the first time, Sorensen said. 
...The politicians have asked for grace to grow in the likeness of 
Christ, that their relationship with their wives and families would be 
strong despite the demands of the job, that their health will be good, 
that God will give wisdom in campaign strategy, and even that God will 
bless campaign opponents in their individual lives. They also have 
sought grace to respond to political attacks with discretion, and that 
they would not become prideful. 

For many parents, students, and teachers, the 21-word prayer read over 
the intercom at Wingfield High School in Jackson, Miss., just before 
Thanksgiving began an open revolt (NIRR 12/13). 
...The firing of Bishop Knox, Wingfield's soft-spoken principal, for 
allowing the prayer to be read, prompted walkouts and rallies by 
thousands of students in 15 Mississippi counties around the state. A 
coalition of teachers, superintendents, and parents, both whites and 
blacks, supported the students, and gathered at large rallies at the 
state Capitol. Gov. Kirk Fordice openly supported Knox, and declared 
the events to be the start of a movement. Several Mississippi 
politicians plan to offer school prayer bills when the Legislature 
reconvenes in January. 

...The Jackson school board overruled Superintendent Ben Canada and 
reversed the firing, but suspended Knox without pay for the rest of the 
school year, saying he showed a lack of professional judgment. "I was 
delighted to be reinstated, but disappointed that I cannot return until 
July of 1994," Knox told NIRR. Knox had been approached by students who 
voted to recite the prayer, which mentioned God, but not Jesus Christ. 
Knox said he was not sure whether he would return, nor whether to 
appeal the school board's decision in a Mississippi court. 
...Although school-sponsored prayer has been banned since 1962, the 
issue has never fully been settled. Many schools, especially in the 
South, openly ignore the prohibition. A recent ruling by the 5th 
Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction over Texas, Louisiana, 
and Mississippi, allowed student-initiated, student-led, nonsectarian, 
non-proselytizing prayer at public school graduations. 

A great majority of adults believe that prayers should be part of the 
program at public school graduation ceremonies, a Gallup poll showed. 
The feeling is strongest among Protestants and Catholics. Least support 
is found among Jews, members of other minority faiths, and those with 
no religious affiliation. 

Two adults in three think it is possible for communities to agree on 
basic values to be taught in local schools, according to a Gallup poll. 
While some are skeptical that agreement could ever be reached on what 
values to teach, there are a number of bedrock values supported by at 
least nine of 10 adults, the survey showed. 
...Nearly everyone -- 97%-- believes honesty should be taught. Teaching 
the value of democracy was supported by 93%. Patriotism and love of 
country were supported by 91%, and caring for family and friends by 
91%. Moral courage should be taught, according to 91% of adults, and 
90% endorse teaching the "golden rule." Acceptance of people of 
different races and ethnic backgrounds should be taught in the schools, 
93% said. Teaching religious tolerance is endorsed by 87%, and 73% 
believe schools should teach acceptance of people holding unpopular 
political or social views. 
...Less support is found for issues of a more private nature. The 
teaching of sexual abstinence outside marriage is supported by 66%, but 
56% believe schools should teach about a right to abortion, and 51% 
about tolerance for homosexuals and bisexuals.  Many young, 
conservative Protestants still take seriously the admonition that sex 
should occur only within the confines of marriage, an East Tennessee 
State University study shows. 
...White Protestants from conservative churches are much more likely to 
marry in their teens than are whites in other Christian groups, 
researchers found. Among groups ranging from Southern Baptists to the 
Churches of Christ, 43% of white women reported marrying by age 19 as 
compared to 10% of mainline Protestants and 7% of Catholics. Among 
white men surveyed, 18% of conservative Protestants reported marrying 
by age 19, as compared to 10% of mainline Protestants and 7% of 
Catholics. 
...Researchers speculated that children in conservative Protestant 
households are much more likely to view early marriage as the way to 
engage in socially approved sex. As romantic relationships grow deeper 
by the late teen years, the pressure to have sex builds, they said. 

"There is no single definition of a family," said United Nations 
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in announcing the International 
Year of the Family. At the General Assembly conference, he said 
families reflect the diversity of their societies. He was critical of 
countries that enacted economic policies without concern for their 
impact on families, and also emphasized the rights of children "to be 
nurtured and protected," of women to be respected within the unit, and 
of the disabled to "have access to the means of reaching their full 
potential." 
...U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala also 
addressed the group on the importance of "thinking globally about 
reproductive health." Without using the words abortion or 
contraception, she affirmed women's and families' freedoms to choose 
when and how many children they have. She applauded the Clinton 
administration for restoring funding to the International Planned 
Parenthood Federation and U.N. Population Fund, and called for greater 
job availability and a global approach to stopping the spread of AIDS. 
...Marital fidelity helps build strong families, thus stronger 
societies, Catholic Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago told the U.N. 
assembly. Repeating some of the same themes supported by the National 
Conference of Catholic Bishops in its recent Follow the Way of Love 
statement on family life, he said many divorces occur because marriages 
"run out of energy" or "wither away." He said no one advocated 
"remaining in a highly conflictual and abusive situation," but that 
divorce takes a "terrible toll" on children and parents, as well as 
communities. 
...Bernardin and Ellis Harsham both will have their day in court May 9, 
despite the cardinal's request for a separate trial. U.S. District 
Judge S. Arthur Spiegel decided the sexual abuse cases should be heard 
together, and agreed to expedite the trial because the plaintiff, 
Steven Cook, has AIDS. Both Bernardin and Harsham have denied Cook's 
claims of sexual abuse at St. Gregory Seminary 17 years ago (NIRR 
11/29), and Bernardin wrote his accuser a letter offering to meet with 
him to pray with him and offer spiritual guidance. Cook has not 
responded, news sources indicated. Also named in the $10-million 
lawsuit are the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, and the auxiliary bishop and 
rector of the seminary when the abuses were alleged to have occurred. 

A cartoon asking "How much abuse can you afford to remember?" caused an 
uproar the Diocese of Falls River, Mass., would like to forget. The 
Dec. 10 issue of The Anchor, the weekly diocesan newspaper, ran the 
satirical panel, in which a receptionist for "Dr. Vic Timm" asks a 
client what kind of abuse memory he wanted the psychiatrist to uncover. 
A sign listed his rates: $10,000 for memory of abuse by a parent, 
$20,000 for a teacher, $30,000 for a priest. 
...The cartoon was anything but funny to victims of former Falls River 
priest Frank Porter, sentenced last month in the high-profile sexual 
abuse case. "They are ridiculing us," said Frank Fitzpatrick, one of 
Porter's accusers and founder of the Cranston, R.I.-based Survivor 
Connections. He said running the panel, circulated by the Cartoonists 
and Writers Syndicate, was a "revictimization" of those who had 
suffered through the molestations. 
...The Falls River diocese apologized, and Bishop Sean O'Malley said he 
was embarrassed that such a statement would have appeared in a Catholic 
journal. The diocese, he said, had a strong desire to help those Porter 
abused to heal and to reconcile with the Church. Fitzpatrick has 
suggested that the diocese take action against the Anchor staffers who 
allowed the cartoon to run. 

Religious charities were rated at the top in three of six non-profit 
categories analyzed by Money magazine. Top scorers were United Jewish 
Appeal in social services, MAP International (a medical assistance 
program) in relief and development, and Campus Crusade for Christ in 
proselytizing. It was Money's first inclusion of a religious category. 
Money judged the groups on their average percentage of income spent on 
programs over the past three years. 
...UJA used 95% of its funds to aid 4 million Jews in 50 countries. 
Needs ranged from immigrant assistance to AIDS ministries. Runners-up 
in the social services category included the Catholic Medical Mission 
Board (91%), Catholic Charities USA (87%), Christian Relief Services 
(86%), and the Salvation Army (85%). 
...MAP spent 95% of its 1990-1992 income on its work at more than 650 
clinics and hospitals in 118 nations, aiding people of all faiths. 
Others in the top 10 were Catholic Relief Services (94.6%), 
International Rescue Committee (93.5%), Food for the Hungry (91.4%), 
Feed the Children (90%), Mennonite Central Committee (90%), American 
Red Cross (88.2%), UNICEF (84.9%), Save the Children Foundation 
(83.5%), Church World Service (81.5%), Christian Children's Fund 
(78.9%), World Vision (78.9%), and Habitat for Humanity International 
(72%). 
...Campus Crusade spent 84% of its revenue on programs. It has 11,800 
paid staffers worldwide, but 9,400 raise money for their own salaries. 
Others in the category were The Navigators (83.5%), Wycliffe Bible 
Translators (81.5%), Focus on the Family (77.9%), and the Billy Graham 
Evangelistic Association (76.7%). 

Efforts to feed the hungry and house the homeless are being 
overwhelmed. Many charities say that donations have increased, but have 
not kept pace with the sharp increase in demand for services. The 
result is that some charities have been forced to turn away needy 
people or scale back, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy. 
...More than a million people may not receive assistance from the 
Salvation Army this holiday season. Donations are down by about 12%, 
and more people are requesting aid. "We are really desperate," Col. 
Leon Ferraez told NIRR. The organization raises roughly one-third of 
its annual income during the Christmas season, and Ferraez said the 
shortfall is "really frightening." Donations usually increase when 
times are bad, he said. Fund-raisers for Midwest flooding also may have 
drained donors' resources. "People only have so much money to give," he 
said. 
...Demand for housing aid is also on the rise, but shelter officials 
say they are having a hard time persuading donors to give because 
donors are frustrated that homelessness problems have not improved. 
...The picture is bleak for many groups. Bread of Life Mission, a 
Seattle charity, will shut down one of its two shelters for the 
homeless because of trouble raising money. Seattle's Lutheran Compass 
Center, which provides temporary housing for the homeless and runs a 
soup kitchen, plans to shut down its feeding operations on Jan. 1 after 
an increase in demand and cut in United Way funds. 
...Many hunger and homelessness groups are using a variety of 
approaches to raise more money and be more efficient, including 
direct-mail holiday appeals, marketing strategists, and new 
fund-raisers. 

An organist in Virginia picked a name from her church's Angel Tree to 
teach her children about giving. Instead, the woman (who prefers 
anonymity) said her 9-year-old son, John, taught her. When he saw that 
the 10-yearold boy whose name they selected wanted an inexpensive 
version of the same Sega Genesis computer game he'd requested for 
himself, John told his mother, "I want that little boy to have mine." 
...Stories like this are not unusual for the Prison 
Fellowship-sponsored ministry, National Project Coordinator Mark Morgan 
told NIRR. Many sponsors go beyond the specific request. Instead of the 
used bike suggested for one child, a Sunday School class took a 
collection to buy him a new one, and used the left over money for a 
helmet. Sometimes they extend their caring to the child's family, 
inviting them to dinner, buying them appliances, or paying their 
utility bills. Angel Tree is more than a present under the tree, Morgan 
says. It is an open door to ministry throughout the year. 
..."We've exceeded our goal" for the year, Morgan said. Through 50,000 
volunteers in 10,000-12,000 churches, Angel Tree provided clothing, 
toys, and Bibles for well over 350,000 children of prison inmates. 
Still, these represent only one-third of the estimated 1 million 
children of inmates in this country. Angel Tree started 11 years ago in 
two malls in Alabama, providing Christmas presents for 556 children. 

Letting Santa Claus co-exist with the baby Jesus can confuse children 
"only if the parents are confused," Jack Hayford, senior pastor of 
Church on the Way, Van Nuys, Calif., said in an interview with the Los 
Angeles Times. 
...Hayford said he sees nothing in the Word of God that argues against 
celebration or "simultaneously showing care and compassion." Charisma 
has received more negative than positive responses to Hayford's article 
defending Santa Claus in its December issue, the newspaper said. "Santa 
is a dramatic emblem of a world crying out for a larger-than-life daddy 
who will love his kids even when they're not perfect," Hayford wrote. 
...Calls to Hayford's church have been mostly positive. His secretary 
reported that most people feel "liberated" by his views. Hayford told 
NIRR he is "sacrificing nothing holy of the appropriate focus on Jesus 
at this season" and that "those who feel otherwise aren't listening or 
have chosen a small-souled course in life, which can never be satisfied 
by any degree of effort or explanation anyway." 

More than 200 Christians will distribute hope and hot chocolate in 
Times Square on New Year's Eve. The "Hope for the New Year" outreach to 
more than 400,000 celebrants is sponsored by New York Christian Urban 
Partnership, a coalition of several hundred city churches and 
organizations. NYCUP Ministries Coordinator Joan Wilkin told NIRR that 
20 churches will send teams of 10 to pass out hot chocolate and `Hope' 
tracts. 
...Wilkin said the group hopes to distribute 54,000 tracts that night 
as it joins Christian radio station WMCA, which will broadcast live. 
This is the fifth year the coalition of churches has joined in the 
year-end outreach. Although city-area churches will hold services on 
New Year's Eve, NYCUP will send teams to minister across denominational 
and cultural barriers. "What an appropriate time to be proclaiming the 
Gospel," said Richard Galloway, NYCUP executive director. NYCUP also 
organizes annual Passion Play outreaches designed to coincide with the 
Fifth Avenue Easter parade and New York City Marathon. 

The Freedom From Religion Foundation wants Wisconsin to harken to its 
holiday herald. "State/Church: Keep Them Separate" reads the group's 
banner, which hung in the State Capitol Rotunda. The Madison-based 
group said its streamer is a response to citizen complaints, and 
maintains Wisconsin should not allow a Hanukkah menorah or annual 
nativity pageant on public property. FFRF members also say the state 
should not hold a Christmas-tree-lighting ceremony, at which government 
officials lead hymn-singing. Although the group sometimes files 
lawsuits to stop such actions, the 3,000-member FFRF, instead, 
requested a state permit to hang the banner until Dec. 27. FFRF 
President Anne Gaylor said members of the group are often mistaken for 
"Grinches," but "there are few things more positive than defending the 
First Amendment." 
...FFRF is protesting against 16 paintings of Christ displayed in 
city-owned Washington Park in Ottawa, Ill. This year, as last, FFRF has 
hung a banner reading "Jesus Is A Myth," as well as others banners, at 
the site. Because a vandal cut down the organization's banners, both 
religious and non-religious volunteers are sought to guard the 
displays, which must be removed by Dec. 31. 
...The display has been a legal battleground for years. The 
privately-owned paintings were commissioned in the mid-1950s, but a 
successful lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union forced their 
removal in the late 1980s. Last year, in response to a challenge by the 
National Legal Foundation, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously 
overturned the ban. Mongolia's new law restricting some religions will 
be reviewed by order of President Punsalmaagiyn Orchibat. The nation, 
heavily dependent on foreign aid, received protests from the U.S. and 
British governments, news reports said. 
...The Nov. 30 legislation forbids the introduction of religious 
activity from outside the country and gives the national government 
authority to control the number of church workers, according to News 
Network International. It is presently scheduled to take effect Feb. 1 
and would curb activity of the Christian population, which has grown 
from virtually nothing to 2,000 since Communism ended in 1990. The law 
gives the state control over the locations of church buildings, and 
prohibits teaching or other religious activity outside the buildings 
for all religions except Buddhism, Islam, and shamanism. 
...The right of Mongolian citizens to believe in a non-Buddhist 
religion is affirmed by the law, but state recognition is granted to 
Buddhism as the rightful source of the people's historic and cultural 
unity. 

Beijing has announced new controls over the estimated 2,000 expatriate 
Christian professionals working there as teachers and experts. Now all 
specialists and organizations must register with the State Bureau of 
Foreign Experts, according to News Network International. They can no 
longer bypass the SBFE red tape, as commonly done in the past, by 
signing job contracts directly with individual Chinese institutions. 
...Interest in Western religion is, nevertheless, high among Chinese 
intellectuals. After recent talks with officials at several Chinese 
universities, Daryl McCarthy, Executive Director of the Overland Park, 
Kan.-based International Institute for Christian Studies (IICS), told 
NIRR he was surprised by requests for courses on church history, New 
Testament Greek, and comparative religion, and that whole university 
departments deal with religion. Despite Beijing's new steps to regulate 
incoming religious influences, the rapid economic changes in China are 
creating great interest in anything Western, including religion, 
McCarthy said. 

A Moroccan man's conversion has brought him a three-year prison 
sentence. Mustapha Zmamda, 29, a native of Casablanca, heard about 
Christianity three years ago from an Arab-language radio program 
broadcast from Marseille, France, according to L'Opinion, published in 
the Islamic nation's capital. In October, he and 18 others who were 
enrolled in a Way of Life correspondence course were ordered in court 
to renounce Christianity and ties with the missionary group. When 
Zmamda alone refused, a tribunal punished him with the maximum sentence 
on Nov. 2. 

"Wally [Tope] wouldn't want attention on the fact that he was a victim 
of the riots," Gretchen Passantino told NIRR. While evangelist Tope was 
urging looters in south-central Los Angeles to repent, two of them 
turned on him, beating him severely. "God bless you," Tope told the 
ambulance drivers on the way to the hospital, before lapsing into a 
19-month coma. Tope died Nov. 24. Passantino, who with her husband, 
Bob, runs Costa Mesa-based Answers in Action, an outreach to cult 
followers, said Tope would have wanted the rioters to share eternity 
with him. 
...Tope, 54, a converted Christian Scientist, often witnessed at cult 
gatherings and on talk shows. He founded Frontline Ministry to train 
Christians to witness to cultists around the world. He once "chased the 
Mormon Tabernacle Choir" around Europe, former roommate Randy Shelton 
told NIRR. He remembers Tope as a fearless evangelist, a field general 
who "wanted to be on the front lines. His passion was to engage people 
in the gospel." 
...At Tope's Dec. 10 memorial service, his co-worker Kurt Van Gorden 
called Christians back to evangelism. "I recognized many of them as 
people saved in the Jesus Movement of the '70s, who used to be active 
in beach and street evangelism -- but aren't anymore," he told NIRR. 
Van Gorden, who is expected to merge Frontline Ministries into his Utah 
Gospel Mission and Jude 3 outreach, urged the 350 people attending to 
carry on Tope's work. 

"They aren't interested in our church, but they are interested in our 
God," said Dale Sykes, minister of education at Second Baptist Church 
in Jacksonville, Ark. 
...The congregation holds some of its Sunday school classes in a gas 
station and pool hall, setting plywood and tablecloths over the pool 
tables for makeshift classrooms. The purpose is to attract low-income 
children and parents it might not reach otherwise. 
..."We probably have the only Sunday school [site] that sells ketchup 
and condoms," Sykes told Baptist Press. Sunday school classes also meet 
at the Hallelujah Trailer Court. Combined average attendance for the 
two classes is 40 per week, including mostly children 12 years old or 
younger. 
...Second Baptist members once said they did not know any poor people, 
but since starting the additional Sunday School, the church has held a 
fall festival and Thanksgiving dinner for the two classes. Members also 
sponsored a Christmas party and play. "I hope Second Baptist meets on 
every square block of the city," Sykes said. A spiritual renewal has 
accompanied the Marshall University football team's rise to national 
prominence from the ashes of the nation's worst college football 
disaster. In 1970, 75 people died when Marshall's chartered plane 
crashed, in effect demolishing the Huntington, W. Va., school's 
football program. Although it took years to rebuild the program, 
Marshall captured its first NCAA Division 1-AA national title in 1992. 
Even though MU lost a Dec. 18 rematch with Youngstown State, 17-5, it 
was the team's third consecutive trip to the finals. 
...The on-field resurrection followed the 1990 resumption of pre-game 
chapels under new coach Jim Donnan. Average attendance this season 
ranged from 15 to 30, and one speaker drew 50. "Most of the coaches 
attended a couple of chapels, which we haven't seen in the past," said 
team chaplain Bob Bondurant. One player who attends every session is 
quarterback Todd Donnan, the coach's son. Despite leading his teammates 
to the title game, he was plagued by problems this fall. "I think Todd 
faced adversity very well," Bondurant said. 
...The excitement surrounding the 1992 crown helped spark formation of 
a Fellowship of Christian Athletes campus chapter last winter. 
Co-advisor Stan Cotten, MU's radio announcer, said the group has 
attracted a number of coaches from other college sports, too. "We feel 
good about what's going on," he told NIRR. "I believe that God has 
cracked open the door here. I'm interested in what He has in store." 
Mandatory evening study sessions kept the football squad away from FCA 
this fall. Still, three varsity members gave their testimony at a 
Campus Christian Center meeting during the playoffs. Bondurant added 
that the championship also boosts community spirit, dampened by 
Huntington's job and population losses over the past decade. 

Free Congress Foundation is touting its National Empowerment Television 
as "C-SPAN with an attitude." The Washington-based educational and 
conservative networking organization launched the public-affairs 
network earlier this month. Because NET is carried on satellite via 
Hughes C-Band Galaxy 7 (Transponder 20 vertical), cable systems 
nationwide can pick up the unscrambled signal at no cost, as can more 
traditional channels. According to publicity materials, NET targets an 
audience that Equitrend identifies as "pragmatists" -- Americans who 
respond to honest, educational, constructive suggestions and 
traditional, patriotic messages. Although NET is nonpartisan, Chief 
Executive Officer Burton Pines said viewers will share a belief that 
government is out of control. 
...FCF-NET President Paul Weyrich's interview show fills one of eight 
hours of original programming each day, as do a morning talk show, a 
program on the American family, a show about home-based business, and a 
Capitol Watch. Altogether, NET expects to have 33 new programs, 
covering everything from cultural trends to children's concerns, wine 
to Washington insiders' views, politics to post-Cold-War military 
strategy. 
...NET will feature religious programming, including USA Pray, hosted 
by Intercessors for America's Gary Bergel and Capitol Hill Prayer 
Alert's Pierre Binum. The channel also will air programs produced by 
Concerned Women for America, Accuracy in Media, the American Life 
League, and the Cato Institute. In addition, Empower America's William 
Bennett and the Christian Coalition's Ralph Reed serve as NET board 
members. With a first-year budget of $10 million, NET is organized as a 
tax-exempt non-profit, with a donation base. Pines said NET's on-air 
fund raising would be every bit "as annoying as public television." 

VISN and ACTS will vanish from cable television listings Jan. 1, but in 
their place will be F&V. The Faith and Values Channel is the new name 
for the combined Vision Interfaith Satellite Network (co-owned by 59 
Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, and Jewish groups) and the American 
Christian Television System (owned by the Southern Baptist Convention). 
The two networks joined last year to share one cable channel, but the 
unwieldy name combinations left officials considering other options. 
...VISN President Nelson Price announced the decision, saying F&V is a 
more viewer-friendly name, that also clarifies the station's mission 
and will help viewers find its programming. A "stronger and more 
visible position" is especially important in "the coming 500-channel 
environment," said Price, a United Methodist. The network, which 
features a variety of Christian and interfaith programming, now reaches 
20.3 million cable households via 1,450 systems in 4,600 American 
communities. As on VISN/ACTS, F&V will prohibit proselytizing, on-air 
fund raising, and maligning other faiths. 

The Winter Olympics will not interrupt CBS' broadcast of Christy. The 
network has postponed the new series' scheduled January debut (NIRR 
11/29). Producer Ken Wales decided the show, based on Catherine 
Marshall's bestselling novel, will begin this March. Wales, excited 
about Christy's prospects, told NIRR the two-hour pilot tested well on 
national cable stations. "I expect it to be CBS' number-one new show. I 
hope it will run seven years."

Vol. 7, No. 26                                                     
December 13, 1993 

Drink blood or go to jail, authorities are telling Hmong Christians in 
northern Vietnam. Confidential sources told NIRR that personal letters 
from believers, and copies of complaints filed at their local 
government offices, describe house-to-house searches for evidence that 
families still practice ancient spiritual rites and cultural 
traditions. Christian families, who refuse to drink animal's blood as 
part of spirit worship, may be heavily fined. The letters report that 
after imprisoning and beating Christians "authorities play games with 
them," forcing them to kneel and worship government leaders or their 
wives, a spokesman for the believers told NIRR. Officials regularly 
confiscate or destroy Bibles and radios, a key source of information on 
the world outside Vietnam. Authorities have raped Hmong women, and 
poisoned children while Christian parents work in the fields. Some 
believers have fled to surrounding jungles to avoid persecution and to 
hold Bible studies and prayer meetings without fear of capture. Sources 
asked not to be identified in order to maintain the communication 
channels and protect victims from additional persecution. 
...Despite the reported mistreatment, the number of Christians among 
the Hmong is rising. Sources in northern Vietnam estimate that 
believers number as high as 330,000 in a population of more than 1 
million. Many have believed in response to native-language gospel 
programs of the Far East Broadcasting Co., a Vietnamese pastor who 
visited the country three weeks ago told NIRR. 

Bible translator Charles Walton phoned home five days late for his wife 
Janice's birthday, but she did not mind. The linguistic researcher had 
just been released from 23 days of captivity in the southern 
Philippines in the hands of Muslim secessionist guerrillas (NIRR 
11/29). 
..."Janice, it's me," Walton told his wife, explaining he was free and 
on his way to Manila. "I rushed out and finished the Christmas 
shopping" in response to the news, she told NIRR. "I've never taken 
prayer so seriously before or felt the effects of it so strongly." She 
said God used the interaction with her husband's captors for His honor. 
..."Knowing my father, I'm sure he [was] talking their ears off," 
Walton's son Ken told NIRR during the captivity. "He's well-versed in 
Scripture and in Islam." The younger Walton was on leave from Fort 
Bragg, N.C., joining his mother and sisters, Jean and Lois, in 
Philadelphia while awaiting news of the developing negotiations. They 
took their mother out to a low-key birthday dinner Dec. 2. Ken Walton 
told NIRR the family had been asking prayer for God's guidance for 
Muslim Congressman Bensaudi Tulawie of Jolo Island, who was negotiating 
on behalf of the Filipino government for Walton's release. Janice 
Walton flew to Los Angeles for her husband's return. 
..."I am emotionally tired. I want to thank God for His mercy in 
bringing about my release," Walton told reporters. Philippine officials 
declined to say whether any of the kidnappers' demands had been met; 
but radio stations said the government had agreed to a prohibition of 
fishing by foreign vessels in the area, and revival of Muslim control 
of trade between the Jolo Islands region and Malaysia. Philippine 
military officials said radical Islamic gunmen had abducted at least 25 
people this year, nine of whom remain in captivity. 

Among Muslim peoples, Iranians are the most open to the message of the 
gospel, News Network International reports. A study by Colorado 
Springs-based Iranian Christians International reveals that, worldwide, 
Iranians are converting at a rate more than double that of any other 
Islamic group. Two of 10 Persian speakers who hear a personal 
presentation of the gospel will immediately embrace the message, and 
"the other eight will thank you for sharing," a minister told Ashton 
Stewart, spokesman for Persian Speaking World, an association of 
ministries to Iranians and other Persian speakers. There are, however, 
only 30 national pastors for the 13,500 believers in Iran, and even 
fewer for the 13,000 Iranian believers elsewhere. 

A former Baptist, Abdul-Rasheed Muhammad, is the U.S. Army's first 
Islamic chaplain. Muhammad, 40, was commissioned as a captain at a Dec. 
3 Pentagon ceremony, where he was sworn in by Col. Herman Keizer, Jr., 
a Baptist Army chaplain and executive director of the Armed Forces 
Chaplain Board. Although Muhammad was raised by Baptist parents in 
Buffalo, N.Y., an Army spokesman said he converted to Islam in the 
1980s. The imam, a former enlisted supply specialist, leaves a 
chaplaincy at the Albion Correctional Facility for Women and the 
Orleans Correctional Facility for Men in New York state. The American 
Muslim Council has endorsed Muhammad, who holds degrees in 
anthropology, counseling education, and social work. He begins the 
Army's chaplain officer basic course in January at Fort Monmouth, N.J., 
and will be assigned to Fort Bragg, N.C., in April. 
...It took the Army 10 years to find its only Muslim chaplain, who will 
give spiritual aid to its 1,400 soldiers who practice Islam. The Air 
Force, Navy, and Marines count 1,100 Muslim personnel. The Coast Guard, 
whose chaplains are provided by the Navy, told NIRR it has a small, 
growing number of Muslims, but no exact count. 
...The search is on to find a Buddhist chaplain, but Army spokesmen 
said the quest will take some time. Together, the 1.7-million-member 
armed services have 3,152 ministers covering 243 denominations and 
faiths. 

Asia now has more evangelicals than the West, according to Patrick 
Johnstone. The author of Operation World, a missions reference standard 
for 20 years, said the turning point occurred in the 1980s when the 
rate of conversion in Third-World countries grew, in some cases as a 
result of the Jesus film project and other technological advances. 
Johnstone said the world's 140,000 full-time Christian evangelizers are 
missionaries to other lands, cross-cultural missionaries within their 
homelands, or expatriate missionaries. His "Assessment of the 
Evangelical Church in the World" was delivered to a Dec. 7 meeting of 
the AD 2000 Global Assessment Task Force. 
...The Assemblies of God in Brazil alone has more evangelicals than do 
all the denominations in Europe. Johnstone said Westerners have used 
"imperialistic" approaches to evangelism beyond the former Iron 
Curtain. "I am deeply ashamed of the way we as evangelicals treated 
Eastern Europe when the [Berlin] Wall came down." By presuming to have 
all the answers, "we crushed their initiative." 
...Johnstone told NIRR that the percentage of the world's population 
that is Christian has steadily declined throughout the century, mostly 
because of Westerners' "defections" from the faith. He said the numbers 
of believers were so large that increased conversions in other parts of 
the world only now are beginning to counterbalance the losses. In 
addition, he said, retention of new converts is lower than it could be. 
He said one dynamic that has changed mission work is a tendency for 
Christians to compromise with prevailing worldviews -- humanism in the 
West, tribal witchcraft and magic in the East. "Consequently, the next 
generation is being lost." 
...Although children have little missiological literature, the 
recruitment of young people into the world evangelism movement is vital 
to the spreading of the gospel, Johnstone told NIRR. Although growth 
rates in Islam can be attributed to high birth rates and automatic 
inclusion in the faith, evangelical growth rates worldwide reflect only 
actual conversions. 
...Johnstone's global missions research information is due to be 
released in a database format next year. "I believe [that] by the end 
of this decade, we will get much done in world evangelization." 

Navajo Indians are using the Bible to learn how to read in their native 
language, thanks to a new ministry of All Nations Literature in 
Colorado Springs. The Navajo Literacy Training program began about a 
year and a half ago in response to the high illiteracy rate on a 
northern Arizona reservation. A weeklong class and a color-coded 
instructional video use Scriptures to teach Navajos to read the 
56-letter language. About 20% of the 250,000 Navajos speak only their 
native tongue, and most of them never have attended school, Program 
Director Stephen Watkins told NIRR. "So we decided to make the program 
self-instructional. Since they can't read, they can watch a video that 
teaches them to read . . . . This gives them unlimited practice in 
their home." Watkins also said ANL plans to distribute the video to 
families throughout the reservation. All Nations' literacy training 
class has graduated 20 Navajos, two of whom are pastors who want their 
congregations to learn to read Navajo. 

Navajos are coming to Christ, according to an article by native Navajo 
Lorena Lynch in Good News, the United Methodist magazine. In 1977, the 
Shiprock (N.M.) Church began the Four Corners Native American Ministry 
to reach the people group for Christ. Although the nearest reservation 
is about the size of West Virginia, the outreach's leaders believed its 
simple tent revivals, house meetings, and trust in God would have a 
ripple effect. In addition to building a shelter for abused women and 
children, a counseling center for alcoholics, a thrift store (which 
Lynch runs), and a day-care school, the ministry now has 17 churches 
within a 150-mile radius. Each has its own Navajo preacher. 
...The Navajo are their own "Third-World country," with a collective 
culture, language, and national sovereignty, Lynch said. Of the 
approximately 220,000 Navajos, about 25% are Christian, and half the 
population is 19 or younger, she said. For those reasons, they need 
missionaries, like those from the Mission Society for United Methodists 
who minister among the natives. Although the Methodists have only one 
ordained Navajo preacher (but several lay pastors), two natives are 
studying for the ministry. 
...The Holy Spirit is moving among Navajo Christians and Native 
Americans, Lynch said. This is evidenced in Navajo worship services, 
which feature hand-clapping praise music, emotional confessions at the 
altar, and prayerful testimonials to the goodness of God. Ministers 
read Scriptures from a Navajo translation of the Bible, and sermons 
often focus on the grace of God, and His power to deliver them from sin 
and fear of death, owls, or witchcraft. Most church services last for 
two to five hours. "If a Navajo preached for only 20 minutes, the 
people would throw him out. My people want to get filled up. They don't 
want to leave church feeling empty." 

The gospel brought hope to the troubled paradise of St. Croix in the 
Virgin Islands, according to a Fort Worth, Texas, missions group. 
"Thank God we were able to see over 3,000 young people saying `yes' to 
Jesus," said Ivan Walters, Caribbean representative for Lay Witnesses 
for Christ International. "The gates are now wide open for us to 
continue where we left off." LWCI founder Sam Mings says drug and 
alcohol abuse, splintered families, and sexual promiscuity plague the 
island. Mings, his wife, Sharon, and 12 world-class athletes recently 
completed their nine-day "Reach Out '93: St. Croix" crusade. 
...Olympic gold-medal-winning runner Joe Deloach and former Harlem 
Globetrotter Andre Bryant shared their personal testimonies, and gave 
exhibitions in dozens of churches, schools, and housing projects. The 
athletes' popularity also opened the way for Gideons International to 
distribute New Testaments in schools. Mings said one high school 
principal, who had confiscated Uzi machine guns, described his school 
as a "war zone" because of its rapes and "turf" battles. Still, even 
some of the toughest students responded. "We could tell them the real 
answer: a personal relationship with Jesus Christ," Mings said. "We 
can't do that in American schools." He said many of the students said 
they were overwhelmed, but wanted their lives to count for something. 
"The main thing I saw in their eyes was: `There is hope,'" Mings told 
NIRR. Walters said one principal later expressed his appreciation for 
the Bibles. St. Croix businessmen are ready to support the soul-winning 
effort, he added. 

A "suitcase radio transmitter" and satellite-delivered Christian 
programming were among the points of interest at the Panama City 
meeting of Latin American Christian broadcasters, or COICOM. The Nov. 
21-24 assembly of 273 Latin American Christian broadcasters and 
publishers was addressed by Alberto Mottesi, Hermano Pablo (Paul 
Finkenbinder), and Bill Bright. Alan McGuirl of Galcom International 
exhibited the portable transmitter and solarpowered radio sets that can 
help a small-town church set up its own community radio ministry for as 
little as $1,500. 
...Because of recent growth, no one knows how many Christian stations 
are on the air in Latin America. COICOM estimates 300 radio stations 
and 20 TV channels. The biggest recent undertaking is the joint effort 
of HCJB and TransWorld Radio for a satellite network called ALAS (wings 
in Spanish) for both secular and Christian stations. 

"We try to get into a black market wherever we can," Paul Eshleman, 
director of the Jesus Film Project, recently reported. Thousands of 
"illegal" copies have been reproduced in unauthorized trade, he said, 
although the project office has distributed 500,000 copies of the 
evangelistic video. The film also is being dramatized for an audio 
version for distribution to blind people and for radio ministry in 
closed countries. Of 521 million who have seen the video, 35 million 
have indicated decisions for Christ, he said. Jesus has been produced 
in 267 languages, with 141 still in translation. The ministry is 
working with 397 denominations and missions in 201 countries to show 
the film daily. 

Exactly one year after New York Jets football star Dennis Byrd 
shattered his neck, paralyzing himself and ending his professional 
career, a two-hour television drama of his life has gone into 
production. 
...Rise & Walk: The Dennis Byrd Story will be broadcast as a two-hour 
docudrama later this television season on Fox Night at the Movies. 
Filming began Nov. 29, the anniversary of the Jets-Kansas City Chiefs 
game in which Byrd collided with a 280-pound teammate while attempting 
to tackle the Chiefs' quarterback. 
...The film, which stars Peter Berg in the title role, traces Byrd's 
life from his youth as the son of an ordained minister on the Oklahoma 
prairie, through his years of football glory, his accident, and the 
rehabilitation that tested Byrd's spirit as he battled doctors' 
prognosis of lifetime paralysis. The film is based on his Zondervan 
autobiography. 
...Byrd now walks and has full use of his arms and hands, but still 
undergoes physical therapy. He is a commentator with CBS, supervises a 
foundation in his name for disabled children, and shares his testimony 
on TV and at banquets. "Every place where Satan attacked me, every 
apparent weakness, turned into a blessing, a gift." 

The FCC's ban against indecent broadcasts from 6 a.m. to midnight was 
struck down in court as unconstitutionally broad. The U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia said it could be possible for the 
Federal Communications Commission to regulate indecent speech in a 
constitutional manner, but it did not explain how. The FCC policy, 
drafted at the request of Congress, defined indecent programs as those 
that describe, "in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary 
community standards . . . sexual or excretory activities or organs." 
...It is the third time the court has struck down indecency policies. 
Congress originally tried to enact a 24-hour ban on indecent 
broadcasts, and when that was struck down, an 18-hour ban was proposed, 
with the time from midnight to 6 a.m. serving as a "safe harbor" for 
indecent speech. Both bans were struck down. 

Because of a corporate promotion of Wayne's World, "traditional 
families can no longer trust McDonald's," the American Family 
Association's Don Wildmon said. The world's largest restaurant chain is 
promoting a film that endorses Hollywood's "left wing social agenda," 
including "promiscuity, irresponsibility, and profanity for teenagers," 
he said. A box-office smash last year, the movie features Saturday 
Night Live's Mike Myers and Dana Carvey. AFA reported customer 
complaints over offensive language and sexual innuendo had led hundreds 
of franchises, many of them in the South, to refuse to participate in 
the month-long sales pitch. AFA's Alan Wildmon told NIRR these owners 
might suffer financially, "but they care more about principle than 
profit." AFA has not called for a boycott, but urges concerned citizens 
to call their local restaurants. McDonald's also is offering $5.99  
videos of Ghost, The Addams Family, and Charlotte's Web, which have 
drawn little complaint, Alan Wildmon said. 

Americans agree on family issues when they look at them from a child's 
perspective, a national survey by the Washington, D.C.-based Family 
Research Council has found. Too often, contentions arise because they 
are portrayed as "a clash between the needs of children and the 
apparent needs of adults," said Gary Bauer, president of the 
conservative educational and lobbying group. Among the poll's findings: 
83% believe children fare best in two-parent families; 57% would like 
to have more family time; 89% of dual-earner couples believe care by a 
mother is better for children than day care; 76% would rather live in a 
place that strongly upholds traditional family values; 72% say the 
changes in family life over the past three decades "have generally been 
for the worse." 
...When people are asked to view family issues through the eyes of 
adults, the response is very different: 51% say couples should divorce 
if their marriage isn't working; 56% believe a woman should be able to 
have children out of wedlock without anyone passing judgment; 67% say 
women should have the right to have an abortion. Most cultural 
questions divide America into three groups: those who consistently take 
a pro-child position; those who hold a consistent pro-adult view; and 
those who are deeply torn or confused on these issues, the report said. 

A divorced father who is forbidden to share his religious beliefs with 
his children has appealed his case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Robert 
Lange can visit his children only in the presence of a third party to 
ensure that he does not mention his faith. In their 1990 divorce, 
Lange's former wife, Elizabeth, received custody of their three 
children. He is a member of the Good News Messengers Church, but his 
ex-wife does not agree with his religious beliefs. 
...The Wisconsin trial court's decision constitutes state preference 
for the mother's faith over the father's, Lange's petition states. He 
asserts in the document that the court's decision deprived him of his 
relationship with his children because his faith impels him to share 
his beliefs with others. 

The Supreme Court allowed the Boy Scouts of America to exclude boys who 
refuse to express a belief in God. The justices rejected an appeal by 
10-year-old Mark Welsh, who was barred from a suburban Chicago Cub 
Scout pack after he said he was an agnostic. The Scouts say that duty 
to God is central to the organization's mission. 
...In an unusual move, the 4.1-million-member organization asked the 
court to use the case to speak definitively about its First Amendment 
rights, saying there are limits to its financial and administrative 
ability to litigate such cases. The group has been attacked in court 
for excluding girls from membership and homosexuals from leadership 
positions, but so far has not been forced in a final court order to 
abandon its restrictions. 

'Tis the season for annual arguments over church-state separation. 
Ohio's Statehouse will have its traditional religious display, despite 
an earlier decision of the Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board to 
discontinue the practice. The board's original plan was to prevent 
legal repercussions and heated conflicts that similar displays, 
including one by the Ku Klux Klan, caused last year in Cincinnati. 
Numerous citizens protested the prohibition, and Gov. George Voinovich 
and legislative leaders from both parties warned that the attorney 
general's office had said the ban could pose a constitutional problem. 
The panel subsequently voted 8-0 to allow the display of a Christmas 
tree, and a menorah sponsored by the Chabad House of Columbus, a 
conservative Jewish values group. 
..."If the Jews are going to have a menorah, we should put up a symbol 
of our Lord," said Cleveland's Vince Pinette, a grand titan of the 
Knights of the KKK. The group has requested a permit to add a cross to 
the Ohio Statehouse's holidays display. A Cincinnati group, Knight 
Riders of Ross County, again has requested permission to erect a cross 
in the city's Fountain Square. "We want to put Christ back in 
Christmas," said a group spokesman. The city council has banned 
displays that could lead to or be interpreted as "fighting words," but 
the ACLU has indicated it will challenge permits denied on that 
subjective basis. Klansmen indicated that this year's cross would be 
stabilized with concrete and sand buckets to protect it from vandals 
and protesters. 
...Despite objections from the town's only rabbi, a menorah will stand 
with a Christmas tree and Santa in front of the Wilmette, Ill., village 
hall throughout the holidays. Rabbi Stuart Altshuler and 20 supporters 
protested the Hanukkah display, saying the Wilmette government was 
"getting involved in an area it should not." A resident representing 
the Anti-Defamation League said such a religious display on public 
lands could open the village lawn to any faith group that requested 
equal time -- a concern city officials described as exaggerated. 
Addition of the menorah would be a symbol of Christian-Jewish unity, 
village manager Heidi Voorhees said. The display goes up this month. 

Will the "Lemon test" get squeezed out when the Supreme Court decides 
Board of Education v. Grumet? Next year the high court will hear 
arguments on whether creation of a New York public school district to 
accommodate handicapped Hasidic Jewish children from the Kiryas Joel 
community is constitutional. In doing so, the court again will 
reconsider the constitutionality of its landmark 1971 decision in Lemon 
v. Kurtzman (NIRR 6/14). The three-part ruling says that laws or 
government practices violate the First Amendment if they have a 
religious purpose, primarily advance or promote religion, or 
excessively entangle government and religion. 
...The test has been under increasing pressure inside and outside the 
court. A majority of the court's justices have said it is ambiguous and 
too stringent. Critics of an increasingly secularized society have 
looked for ways that government can accommodate religious concerns. 
Proponents of the standard say it offers protection against churchstate 
entanglement, and should not be altered. The court's decision is due by 
June. 

It makes no difference if Jesus is flanked by Abraham Lincoln and 
Martin Luther King, Jr. The picture of Christ hanging in the hallway of 
Bloomingdale (Mich.) High School still is unconstitutional, U.S. 
District Judge Benjamin Gibson ruled. The arrangement was a compromise 
in a lawsuit brought by former student Eric Pensinger, who said the 
school's display of Warner Sallman's Head of Christ was a violation of 
the First Amendment (NIRR 2/22). Pensinger's attorneys from the 
American Civil Liberties Union and school district counsel settled on 
allowing the picture of Jesus (covered during the appeal process) to 
remain on the wall, but to be accompanied by similarly sized portraits 
of other historical figures. A disclaimer explained that the pictures 
were funded privately, and did not constitute school endorsement of any 
religion. The school also had agreed to pay the $13,000 ACLU bill. 
Pensinger, a 1992 graduate who says he has been harassed over his 
lawsuit, said the compromise was "better than nothing." 
...But Gibson asked, "How can you compromise constitutional rights?" 
Citing the 1971 "Lemon test," he said the display still unnecessarily 
entangled religion and government. The school has moved for a dismissal 
from the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 

"A man can't regret a right decision," said Bishop Knox, former 
principal of Wingfield High School in Jackson, Miss. Superintendent Ben 
Canada placed Knox on indefinite paid administrative leave last month 
for allowing Student Council President Kim Fails to read a prayer over 
the intercom. On three consecutive days Fails recited, "Almighty God, 
we ask that You bless our parents, teachers, and country throughout the 
day. In Your name we pray, Amen." 
...Knox maintained that student-led, non-sectarian, non-proselytizing 
prayers have been upheld in court. Because Wingfield's 902 students 
were asked whether they wanted a prayer recited daily during morning 
announcements, and students approved the measure by a 490-96 vote, the 
prayer was permissible, he said. 
...The superintendent and the ACLU reminded Knox, who remains on leave, 
that the U.S. Supreme Court banned school-supported prayer in 1962, and 
the court cases refer only to graduation ceremonies and only in 
specific states. Canada said Knox had overlooked those distinctions. 
...Local public support favors Knox. Of about 2,500 Jackson residents 
who responded to a Clarion-Ledger poll, 97% said he should not have 
been disciplined. Several parents have hung yellow ribbons on school 
property, and members of local ministries and Jackson's largest 
Southern Baptist church have issued statements supporting Knox. When 
more than 200 students in six area schools were suspended for staging a 
walkout protest, Jackson school officials agreed the teens could return 
to school without any blots on their permanent records. 

An interfaith prayer rally to end gang violence in Denver turned 
controversial. When Mayor Wellington Webb announced he would join local 
ministers for a Dec. 5 service to draw attention to increasing urban 
violence, the Freedom From Religion Foundation quickly took him to 
court. The group claimed the mayor's announcement of the Sunday rally 
and its taking place at a state-owned convention center constituted a 
"blatant attempt to link church and state." A judge allowed the prayer 
rally to continue, but reprimanded Webb, a Democrat, "to quit pushing 
religious views." The judge said Webb had the right to attend the rally 
as a private citizen, not as a government employee. 
..."I'm Wellington Webb, and I'm here. I had to make that statement so 
I don't get into trouble with anybody." Citizen Webb said he believed 
in prayer and the freedom of religion, for which he received two 
standing ovations. 
...Many local clergy were offended at Catholic Archbishop J. Francis 
Stafford's comments about the rally. In an opinion column in a Denver 
newspaper, he wrote, "I can't help noting that the community seems to 
turn to prayer only as a last resort. Somewhere inside each of us is a 
skeptic who discounts religious faith." Jewish, Protestant, and 
Catholic leaders gathered to discuss their dissatisfaction. "I'm 
offended," said Gary Wolper, pastor of Central Presbyterian Church. 
"He's ignoring the fact that churches have been working together for 
years to end gangs and violence." Father Tom s of St. Cajetan's Church 
insisted that working together to cease the violence was good, but "it 
is not just prayer that allows you to solve the problem, but education 
and jobs." News reports said as many as 3,000 people attended the 
rally, at which 36 Christian, Jewish, American Indian, Buddhist, and 
Muslim leaders prayed. 

George Allen's nomination of Kay Coles James for Virginia's secretary 
of health may quiet critics who said the governor-elect distanced 
himself from the religious right and abortion-rights foes during the 
election. James is vice president of the Family Research Council, and 
served as a spokesperson for the National Right To Life Committee. In 
addition, James, a Virginia native, was former associate director for 
the Office of Drug Policy in the Bush administration, director of a 
national mentoring program linking corporations and disadvantaged 
youth, assistant secretary for public affairs in the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services, and commissioner of the National Commission 
on Children in the Reagan administration. Allen was accused of a lack 
of support for fellow Republican and unsuccessful lieutenant governor 
candidate Michael Farris, a born-again Christian and outspoken 
conservative. 

"He kept saying, `I'm not leaving. I promise I'm not leaving.' And he 
really meant it," said Susan Titus Osborn, a longtime member of Charles 
Swindoll's First Evangelical Free Church in Fullerton, Calif. But she 
and 10-year member Lucille Moses told NIRR they knew their pastor could 
not continue there once he assumed the presidency of Dallas Theological 
Seminary. "I went through my grief" when he accepted the presidency, 
Osborn said. "I knew it was just a matter of time [till he left]." She 
says the church will not fall apart. "It is not built around one man. 
[Swindoll] never wanted it built around a man." 
...Swindoll, 59, said "soul-searching, prayer, and counsel" led to the 
decision to give up the pastorate to train young people for ministry. 
After he assumes his new position next July, he and his wife, Cynthia, 
plan to move to Tennessee, where he plans to establish a 
non-denominational church and relocate his Insight for Living radio 
ministry, which his wife runs. The Swindolls also hope to devote more 
time and attention to their children, one of whom lives in Nashville, 
and to their grandchildren. They have "begun to re-evaluate the 
entirety of their ministry," and planting a church "can happen only if 
he can keep his family a priority," Roger Kemp, spokesman for Insight 
for Living, told NIRR. Even if Swindoll resumes the pastorate, "his 
thrust will be on training seminary graduates," Kemp said. 

Universities exclude scholarship that reflects religious viewpoints, 
especially traditional Christian ones, George Marsden told some of the 
7,000 participants at the largest-ever joint meeting of the American 
Academy of Religion and the Society of Biblical Literature in 
Washington, D.C., last month. The discrimination is "typically promoted 
in the name of tolerance, pluralism and diversity," said the historian, 
whose studies of American fundamentalism and evangelical Protestantism 
are considered landmarks in church history. Marsden said in a speech 
that he had seen applications for jobs and graduate admission dismissed 
because applicants revealed a Christian motivation for their work. 
Often young professors feel obliged to keep their religious views quiet 
until they get tenure, he said. 
...Marsden's observation should not be used as "a license to whine on 
the part of those who have nothing valid or valuable to say, or do not 
say it well," University of Chicago church historian Martin Marty told 
the New York Times. Still, he agreed, "Religion gets pushed to the 
sides and trivialized by higher education."  If academic religious 
experts help law enforcement agencies understand new religious 
movements, they can avoid confrontations such as the one between 
federal officers and the Branch Davidians near Waco, Texas. "We can't 
wait for the next crisis," said Nancy Ammerman, associate professor 
sociology of religion at Emory University's Candler School of Theology. 
"A task force must be formed," said J. Philip Arnold (NIRR 10/18), 
director of the Reunion Institute, a Houston-based religious 
think-tank, who attempted to negotiate with cult leader David Koresh.  
A scholar and a scientist revealed that cold-war technology has opened 
a new window on deciphering ancient biblical manuscripts. The invisible 
became visible when an advanced infrared imaging system, enhanced by 
electronic cameras and computer image-processing technology, was used 
to decipher a fragment of the Genesis Apocryphon, a popular retelling 
of Genesis stories. Researchers were stunned when the phrase "He wrote 
the words of Noah" appeared on the manuscript. In visible light the 
fragment had appeared to be ruined, and even the usual infrared methods 
revealed only illegible characters and a hint of a text. 
...The technology was developed for aerial and space reconnaissance, 
and has been extended to civilian earth surveys and improved methods of 
observing the planets and the stars. Working closely together on the 
project were Gregory Bearman, who designs remote-sensing instruments 
for spacecraft at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, and Bruce 
Auckerman, a Semitic scholar at the University of Southern California 
School of Religion. Bearman has proposed that a full array of such 
technology be modified for regular use in deciphering and studying 
ancient manuscripts. Other objects for examination could be parchments 
with writing that has been erased to make room for new writing, and 
also the faded designs of ancient textiles.  In addition to the more 
orthodox discussions of Christianity (for example, John Wesley's view 
of suicide, and the role of God in a post-modern context), other 
AAR-BSL papers covered feminist responses to violence, health care 
ethics, eco-spirituality, the Clinton administration's attempt to 
produce a new civil religion, neo-pagan festival rites, Asian faith 
practices, goddess worship, erotic empowerment, traditional religions' 
role in fostering homophobia, and the role of advocacy in academic 
religious studies. 

Postponed: the Dec. 6 first-degree murder trial of pro-life protester 
Michael Griffin. Charged in the shooting death of abortionist David 
Gunn (NIRR 11/29), Griffin and his defense co-counsel, Robert Kerrigan, 
requested a fourth trial date delay to allow time for them and the 
Florida Department of Law Enforcement to examine newly found evidence. 
On Nov. 21, another bullet was discovered at the site of the crime. 
Prosecutors have alleged that this bullet might be the last of three 
said to have struck Gunn. Escambia County (Fla.) Circuit Judge John 
Parnham rescheduled the trial for Feb. 21. 

The holiday recess of Congress has stalled enactment of FACE until next 
year. The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (NIRR 11/29) still 
must go to conference to work out differences between the versions 
passed in the House and the Senate last month. Because committee 
members were not named in time for the Nov. 25 adjournment, conferees 
will be named late in January. 
...A religious liberty amendment sponsored by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) 
may polarize the FACE dialogue, Baptist Press reported. The addition, 
passed only in the Senate version, would grant worshipers the same 
protections afforded to those seeking to enter an abortion clinic. 
Those who obstruct, blockade, or commit violent acts against people who 
wish to enter religious services would be punished with the same 
severity as FACE violators. Some prolife forces fear that FACE 
supporters in the House, in addition to abortion- and homosexual-rights 
activists, will seek to scratch the amendment. Others disagree, 
especially in light of overwhelming congressional support for the 
Religious Freedom Restoration Act. If the government will protect 
abortion clinics, it also should protect churches, said James Smith, 
director of government relations for the Southern Baptist Christian 
Life Commission. "After all, the free exercise of religion is 
explicitly protected by the Constitution, while abortion is not." 

Canada should prohibit people from profiting from the sale of babies, 
sperm, embryos, and fetal tissue, according to a government study 
released in Ottawa Nov. 30. The $28.2-million, four-year study by the 
Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies has been beset by 
controversies, including the firing of four of the seven original 
commissioners, news accounts said. The 1,300-page report of 293 
recommendations also suggested the criminalization of advertising of 
surrogate birth service, or receiving a fee for arranging them. Health 
Minister Diane Marleau has not yet said when the government will 
implement the commission's key recommendation: establishment of a 
federal agency to regulate all aspects of the new technologies. Critics 
objected to such intrusion into provincial jurisdiction over health 
care. 
...Some Christian and right-to-life groups expressed concern over 
apparent contradictions in the report, Faith Today's Marianne Meed Ward 
told NIRR. The Winnipeg, Manitoba-based Alliance for Life (AL) noted 
that the report's explicit acknowledgement of the dignity of human life 
contradicts its acceptance of creating new human beings to be used for 
"research purposes" during the first 14 days of their existence. AL 
said the report was inconsistent to disallow abortion for sex 
selection, but to allow it to prevent the birth of disabled children. 
The Evangelical Fellowship of Canada expressed regret that the report 
failed to address related matters it would endorse: inclusion of 
marital status among criteria for receiving infertility services; a ban 
on developing sperm banks where genetic fathers bear no responsibility 
for, nor ties to, their children; and ways to avoid forcing school and 
hospital personnel to compromise their religious beliefs. 

Two days before World AIDS Day, a group of 14 clergy and religious 
leaders met with President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore for 
a 90-minute interfaith White House prayer and discussion breakfast. The 
disease and compassionate treatment of its victims were the focus of 
the Nov. 29 meeting, at which most participants represented religious 
bodies and churches with an interest in helping to solve the problems 
of HIV infection. Participants included a Catholic priest, a Jewish 
rabbi, and Protestants ranging from the largely homosexual Universal 
Fellowship of Metropolitan Churches to mainline AIDS ministries to 
conservative Christian groups. 
...Ed Dobson, pastor of the evangelical Calvary Church in Grand Rapids, 
Mich., opened in prayer. He asked that "in the midst of programs and 
politics they would see the face of human suffering," a spirit Dobson 
said permeated the whole meeting. Several participants said they were 
gratified by the president's willingness to meet with them, listen to 
their suggestions, and ask how he could help rally support. The leaders 
said their discussion focused on personal experience, not the politics 
of health-care reform. Just as the White House recognized their 
efforts, several participants lauded the administration for urging 
expanded AIDS/HIV treatment and research programs, and for establishing 
a National AIDS Policy Office, headed by Kristine Gebbe, a Lutheran, 
who attended the meeting. 
...Clinton said he was encouraged to hear that the evangelical church 
is responding to the AIDS epidemic with greater -- not lesser -- 
enthusiasm, as the National Association of Evangelicals' Richard Cizik 
reported. Cizik said many help ministries are run by conservative 
Christians who call the spread of HIV and AIDS "disease-based 
genocide." Cizik called for "a policy of routine testing, reporting, 
and partner notification for HIV, as we do for every other sexually 
transmitted disease." Particularly sad, he said, is resistance by 
public health officials "to take the practical moral actions that will 
help stop the spread of the epidemic among communities of color." 
...The AIDS National Interfaith Network coordinated a Dec. 1 mass bell 
ringing among churches and synagogues. Participating houses of worship 
were asked to sound their carillons 13 times, one for each year of the 
epidemic. In addition, most dimmed their lights for 15 minutes in 
memory of those the disease has killed. 
...The 1.6-million-member United Church of Christ has produced an AIDS 
prevention curriculum for use in all UCC churches. Affirming Persons -- 
Saving Lives is designed for instruction in both children's Sunday 
school and adult study groups. Although the 1,000-page lesson plans 
emphasize abstinence from sex and drug use as the only sure-fire way to 
avoid AIDS, they also provide safe-sex discussion questions. 

In one of the worst criminal cases of pedophilia in the United States, 
former Catholic priest James Porter was sentenced to 18-20 years in 
prison for the molestation of dozens of boys and girls in three eastern 
Massachusetts parishes in the 1960s (NIRR 3/8; 1/25). He could be 
considered for parole in about six years. 
...Porter, 58, overpowered or ambushed his victims, often telling them 
they would be punished if they told anyone of the incidents. Prior to 
the sentencing, Porter listened to a litany of charges from the adults 
he had assaulted as children. In court they told anguished stories of 
their assaults, shattered childhoods, and hopes for vindication. 
...At least half of the 22 victims who testified were speaking publicly 
for the first time. Several bitterly denounced the failure of the 
Catholic Church to act promptly, even when some parents told church 
officials that Porter had sexually assaulted their children. Victims 
described themselves as being plagued by nightmares, depression, drug 
and alcohol addictions, suicide attempts and failed marriages. "My own 
son asks me, `Dad, why don't you ever talk about religion? Why don't 
you ever talk about God?'" one victim testified. 
...Porter admitted to molesting nearly 100 children in Massachusetts, 
but victim advocates say he may have abused more. Earlier this year, he 
completed a six-month jail term in Minnesota for molesting his 
children's baby sitter in 1987. He faces a series of similar civil 
lawsuits in Minnesota and New Mexico. 
..."The church and society can learn a lot from this case if we really 
examine it and not push it into the deep recesses of our minds," David 
Clohessy of the Chicago-based Survivors Network of Those Abused by 
Priests, told NIRR. A "purely punitive approach won't ultimately remedy 
the problem," SNAP's national director said, but "without a lengthy 
sentence, victims feel their pain is minimized, and that really worries 
me. out a lengthy sentence, victims feel their pain is minimized, and 
that really worries me."

Vol. 7, No. 25                                                          
    November 29, 1993 

The bells of Moscow's Kazan Cathedral pealed across Red Square for the 
first time in decades during the church's reconsecration this month. 
The gold-domed edifice was built in 1636 to house an icon considered to 
be miraculous. In 1936, Josef Stalin had the church partially torn down 
to make space for military parades and public toilets. The cathedral 
stands about 100 yards from Communist leader Vladimir Lenin's tomb. 
Hundreds gathered in freezing weather for the event, officiated by 
Russian Orthodox Patriarch Aleksi II. Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov is said 
to have spent 3 million rubles on the painstaking restoration, called a 
government "plea for forgiveness." The church, in turn, fed the 
construction workers during the two-year project. Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin said the government will retain ownership of the 
priceless icon, but has allowed the church to use it in its services. 

For "conscious disobedience," the Russian Orthodox Church defrocked 
parliamentarian-priest Gleb Yakunin, the foreign news service Interfax 
reported. The Holy Synod's decision is said to be based on the priest's 
refusal to withdraw as a candidate for deputy for the pro-Yeltsin 
Choice bloc in Moscow's Dec. 12 parliamentary elections. Church 
headquarters said in a statement that clergy participation in Russia's 
political struggle "runs counter to the church's pastoral approach to 
the resolution of social problems." 
...Yakunin, however, insists that church rulings allow priests to serve 
in political activities, as long as they do not invoke the name or the 
position of the ROC. Wearing a black cassock and crucifix on a chain, 
Yakunin told reporters the church's "hysterically sick reaction" was 
designed to prevent him from further unveiling Orthodox collaborations 
with the KGB. ROC leaders, including Aleksi II, have admitted the 
church hierarchy often appeased the Kremlin under communism, but the 
patriarch has not repented formally for this cooperation, although 
critics have called for a public apology. The church, which needs 
reform, Yakunin said, had embarked upon a "road to stagnation" with 
such moves, including support of a draft law to limit Western religious 
activity in Russia. The dissident has promised a challenge, but said 
even if he is not restored to his priestly status, his future is 
clearest in the legislature. 
...Three Moscow-based ministries, in cooperation with Russian 
Christians, issued a call to pray for the country's first democratic 
parliamentary elections. New Life Ministries, Campus Crusade for 
Christ, and Peter Deyneka Russian Ministries are hoping the Dec. 5-12 
intercession effort will help keep the elections equitable, free, and 
non-violent. Russian voters must decide whether to accept or reject 
Yeltsin's proposal for a new constitution. Communist hard-liners are 
said to be gaining strength as the election draws closer. "If we fail 
to pray and act now, Russia's first democratic election could be its 
last," NLM director Dan Peterson said. 

Ministry to the former Soviet Union could be maximized by cooperating 
with existing Orthodox congregations, said speakers at "To Russia with 
Love." About 150 leaders of large American churches attended the Nov. 
16-18 convocation in Pasadena, Calif. Carl George, director of the 
Charles E. Fuller Institute, convened the conference to increase 
effectiveness and decrease resentment against Western evangelism in the 
Commonwealth of Independent States. Christians headed to the C.I.S. 
need to learn about Russian Christianity so they avoid making "stupid 
and offensive statements" when they visit, George said. 
...East and West "mis-see" each other, but the conference was an 
amazing opportunity for evangelical pastors to compare perspectives 
with Eastern and Russian Orthodox priests, George said. Westerners are 
preoccupied with projects, he said, but the Orthodox seek 
relationships. "If a collaborative effort results, that's fine." 
Westerners often confuse Eastern Orthodoxy with Catholicism, or assume 
Orthodox believers are not Christians. He said some in the Russian 
Orthodox Church, with its more than 50 million adherents, resent 
Western efforts to "evangelicalize" their people, and "are offended 
with what they perceive as an `outsider' ministry of proselytization, 
which fails to offer due respect to [its] 1,000-year history of 
Christianity." George told NIRR, "Where we speak of the next fiscal 
year, they speak of generations and centuries. They have an unhurried 
approach to the worship of God." 
...George said speakers' accounts of religious persecution were moving. 
One of every three Orthodox Christians was systematically tortured and 
murdered by the KGB. Speakers said more Christians were martyred under 
70 years of communism than during the first four centuries of 
Christianity, prompting one leader to tell his Western counterparts, 
"Our faith is confessed in our martyrdoms, yours in your sermons." 
...Plenary speakers, who educated church leaders on the history and 
perspectives of Orthodox Christianity and the spiritual needs of the 
C.I.S., included Archpriest Vladimir Vorobyov and Andrei Borisovich 
Efimov of St. Tikhon Moscow Theological Institute; Archimandrite 
Pankratiy, abbot of Valaam Monastery near St. Petersburg; and Leonid 
Kishkovsky, ecumenical officer, Orthodox Church in America. George said 
a "decade-long parish-to-parish exchange program" could enable C.I.S. 
churches to "multiply their evangelistic efforts." This task in the 
post-communist C.I.S. is a huge one, speakers agreed, and includes 
organizing and training believers, renewing nominal Christians, and 
evangelizing the unsaved. 

The world didn't end, but two leaders of the doomsday cult that 
beguiled hundreds of devotees to Kiev, Ukraine, for a prophesied 
apocalypse were charged by Ukrainian prosecutors with fraud, 
embezzlement, and corrupting minors. 
...Marina Tsvygun and Yuri Krivonogov, the "living god" and "prophet" 
of the White Brotherhood cult, were informed of the charges in their 
jail cells. They were arrested when they led about 60 followers into 
St. Sofia Cathedral, site of their forecast Nov. 14 "resurrection." The 
group brawled with police and damaged priceless icons. 
...Police said Krivonogov tricked followers into handing over valuables 
and property. Many of the cult's followers are young people disoriented 
by rapid changes in post-Soviet society. About 500 followers, most of 
them from the neighboring republic of Russia, were being held and 60 
were on a hunger strike to press for their release. Children of cult 
members were being held at Kiev's main detention center. 
...Police had feared a logistical nightmare, that thousands of cult 
devotees would descend on the city for the promised end of the world on 
Nov. 14, and did not rule out violence or mass suicides. Nothing 
happened, but the cult has made 20 converts in the Baltic town of 
Lebork, Poland, police there were quoted as saying. 

Hattie Newell cried all day Nov. 18, remembering 12 family members who 
died in Jonestown in 1978. This anniversary was "the worst it's ever 
been," the Highland, Calif., resident told NIRR. She said only the Lord 
kept her and two brothers from being among the 913 victims. Newell, 
then 19, worked with cult leader Jim Jones for six years as a nurse and 
counselor. "As a medical person, I would probably have had to help 
administer" the poison that killed them all, she said. The first of her 
family to join People's Temple in San Francisco, she accompanied cult 
members -- including her mother, two sisters, five younger brothers, a 
nephew, and five cousins -- by bus to airports in New York and Florida. 
Each time she saw someone off to Jonestown, Guyana, Newell was packed, 
had her passport, and wanted to go, but "Jim said no." 
...Although cult members in San Francisco lost shortwave contact with 
Guyana Nov. 18, they had no advance warning of the mass murder. Newell 
said the TV news made her wish she had died with them. "I went down to 
the brink of no return," she told NIRR. "When I heard Jim died, I felt 
grief, but it was hard to hate him. I had no faith in God. Jim had told 
us he was our god." Newell accepted Christ at a Baptist church in 1982. 
Sharing her story and "warning others" has become her personal 
ministry. "I wish I could tell Mom I'm sorry I got them involved." 
...Several relatives of those who died in Guyana are raising money to 
erect a memorial wall in Oakland, where hundreds of the massacre 
victims, many of them children, are buried. 

A United Arab Emirates court has sentenced a Briton to six months in 
prison for giving Christian literature to Iranians. Ray Amey, 41, was 
convicted of promoting Christianity as a religion superior to Islam. 
The UAE forbids proselytizing by non-Moslems. Amey, who is to be 
deported after serving his sentence, had distributed New Testaments in 
the Farsi language, according to British Vice Consul David Gessing. 

American Bible translator Charles Walton was abducted by armed gunmen 
Nov. 14, the latest victim of religious unrest in the southern 
Philippines. The 30-year researcher with the Summer Institute of 
Linguistics was taken from his home in the Sulu archipelago, a 
predominantly Muslim region of the southwestern Philippines, according 
to SILManila. Filipino officials said his captors, thought to be 
members of the radical Islamic secessionist group Abu Sayyaf (NIRR 
5/17), want Bible translators expelled from the Muslim region, and 
foreign vessels prohibited from fishing their territorial waters. They 
also sought assurances that police would not retaliate if they released 
Walton without harming him. Walton's wife, Janice, was in Philadelphia 
when he was abducted, SIL indicated. 
...Philippine Vice President Joseph Estrada said on Nov. 22 that Walton 
was alive and well, although it was not known where he is held. SIL 
indicated the linguist suffers from cerebral malaria and a gall bladder 
problem. Press reports indicated the abduction was seen as an 
embarrassment for President Fidel Ramos as he was visiting President 
Bill Clinton in an effort to woo American investments. Negotiators have 
ruled out paying ransom, which often is demanded by Abu Sayyaf 
kidnappers. Walton is said to be the seventh foreigner kidnapped by 
gunmen in the southern islands in the last two years. None has been 
seriously injured. 

Guerrillas who kidnapped three New Tribes missionaries in southern 
Panama (NIRR 5/3) are no longer claiming the men are CIA spies, 
demanding $5 million for their release, or threatening their deaths. 
Dave Mankins, Rick Tenenoff, and Mark Rich taught Bible studies in the 
Kuna language to residents of Pucuro village. They have not been seen 
since Jan. 31, the night armed men led them, hands tied, into the 
jungle. 
...Since April 8, the captors have refused to prove that the men still 
are alive. Speaking from New Tribes Mission headquarters in Sanford, 
Fla., foreign secretary Mel Wyma told NIRR, "They say the men are well 
-- we're thankful for that -- but we have to wait for proof." The 
mission monitors the airwaves from early morning to late evening for 
sporadic radio messages from the guerrillas, who are thought to have 
Colombian connections. For some weeks, radio contact was replaced by a 
tribal courier who met with guerrillas and transported mail and 
personal items intended for the captives. Earlier this month, the 
guerrillas told the courier not to return. The captors have broadcast 
two or three messages since then, and Wyma said New Tribes is 
attempting to establish regular contact. 
..."They're on an emotional roller coaster," Wyma said of missionary 
wives Nancy Mankins, Patti Tenenoff, and Tania Rich, and their eight 
children, who range in age from 24 to 1. Wyma (who is also Tania Rich's 
grandfather) said New Tribes fields questions for the families, who 
returned to the States early in February. Still, the families are 
"struggling." Rich does not know his grandmother passed away in 
mid-November; and Sara Mankins wants her dad to help plan her wedding. 
Still, Wyma said, "They know their men are the Lord's. They're really 
His prisoners." 

Television evangelists Jim Bakker and Jerry Falwell "embraced and 
prayed together" at the federal prison in Jesup, Ga., where Bakker is 
serving an eight-year sentence for defrauding followers of his PTL 
ministry. The Pentecostal Bakker had asked the fundamentalist Falwell 
to assume control of the financially beleagured complex, which later 
was forced into bankruptcy. Falwell requested this "pastoral visit," 
his spokesman, Mark DeMoss, said. 
...Bakker said contemplating imprisonment and the breakup of his 
31-year marriage put him through "the depths of despair, and when I 
could not feel God's presence, I cried out like Job, `Thou God slay me, 
yet I will trust Him.'" He said in a recent prayer letter that the 
experience became "one of the great turning points of my life," and "a 
shower of tears was the beginning of the inner healing that God gave to 
me." 

President Clinton delivered an emotional, sermon-like speech from the 
pulpit where Martin Luther King gave his last message. A wide class 
gulf has opened within black America, so that while some are moving up, 
many others are falling into dire poverty, he told 5,000 black 
ministers attending the 86th annual Holy Convocation of the Church of 
God in Christ (COGIC). King, who was assassinated in Memphis in 1968, 
"did not live and die to see 13-year-old boys get automatic weapons and 
gun down 9-year-olds just for the kick of it," Clinton said. "How would 
we explain it to Martin Luther King if he showed up today?" he asked, 
pounding the pulpit at Mason Temple COGIC. 
...Clinton insisted that while the government should play a large role 
in fostering social justice, it is no substitute for nurturing families 
and strong communities. The church also is a good place to provide the 
structure, discipline, and love today's inner-city children and their 
families need, Clinton said. In addition to decrying urban violence, 
Clinton tied together health care reform, family leave, quality 
education, and the North American Free Trade Agreement, portraying them 
as related forms of security: health security, personal security, and 
job security. A week later, Clinton took his campaign against crime to 
a Catholic church in a Hispanic neighborhood of Los Angeles, this time 
invoking the memories of Hispanic labor leader Cesar Chavez, and slain 
Catholics John and Robert Kennedy. 

On Nov. 16, President Clinton signed the long-awaited Religious Freedom 
Restoration Act as about 200 religious and civil leaders watched. The 
law requires a "compelling state interest," such as health or safety, 
before government may hinder the religious practice of Americans. 
Government also must use the least restrictive means of safeguarding 
its interests (NIRR 11/15). "The government should be held to a very 
high level of proof before it interferes with someone's free exercise 
of religion," Clinton said. He spoke of the important roles that people 
of faith have played throughout American history. The country's 
founders placed religious liberty as the first freedom in the Bill of 
Rights because they understood its significance, Clinton said. "They 
knew that religion helps give our people the character without which a 
democracy cannot survive." Almost 30 states this year proclaimed Nov. 
21-27 as Christian Heritage Week. Nearly 50 representatives cosponsored 
House Joint Resolution 113, introduced by Nick Rahall (D-W.Va.), to 
gain national status for the event. Rus Walton of the Marlborough, 
N.H.-based Plymouth Rock Foundation (PRF) told NIRR that lethargy in 
the House in no way reflects the enthusiasm he has seen for the event 
across the country. Local celebrations typically include mayoral 
speeches, prayers, and music by American Legion bands or church choirs. 
Special observances at the New Testament Church in Plymouth, Mass., 
will mark the start of the PRF's year-long effort to promote the 
resolution. 
...In proclaiming Nov. 21-28 National Bible Reading Week, President 
Clinton acknowledged the unique place of the Bible in the nation's 
history. "Many of our highest ideals, rights, and freedoms are derived 
from these Scriptures. Dozens of our greatest colleges and universities 
were founded primarily to provide an education that had the Bible at 
its foundation," he said. Since Franklin Roosevelt's administration, 
such presidential messages have been read in local celebrations of the 
event, sponsored by the Laymen's National Bible Association, formed by 
New York civic and business leaders in 1940. Participants include Bible 
societies, churches, synagogues, and other civic groups. Clinton urged 
frequent, careful Bible reading, saying he has struggled with questions 
asked by Job and Paul, and gains strength from the words of Jesus and 
the Psalms. 

The probing questions of Jesus, Paul, and Socrates may offer a better 
model for today's youth evangelism than does the impersonal preaching 
style of mass evangelism. According to the Glendale, Calif.-based Barna 
Research Group, today's young Americans do not automatically accept 
ready-made, complex systems of belief from authority figures. Whereas 
34% of senior citizens report annoyance when people try to tell them 
about their religious beliefs, 50% of Baby Busters say they find it 
objectionable. Nevertheless, the Busters spend more time thinking about 
ultimate questions than they let on, the Barna report indicated. The 
younger generation is fascinated with ideas that capture their 
imaginations, and wants ideas offered in an open discussion forum, 
without pressure or judgment. 
...Some of today's most talented evangelists travel the college 
circuit, allowing students to ask their toughest questions, according 
to Barna. Using an interactive method, they often answer an inquiry 
with a leading question of their own, as did Jesus when asked about 
paying taxes to the oppressive government of Caesar. Those who engage 
in this Socratic type of evangelism must be well-versed in the ideas of 
Christianity and its competitors, and ready to respond appropriately to 
the inquirers' detours, Barna's research concluded. 

Proponents of the Veritas Forum at Ohio State University fired off 
critical letters to the editor of the collegiate Lantern in early 
November. The critics objected to "a double standard for 
newsworthiness" because the school newspaper failed to report the 
content of any of the 14 Christian-sponsored events attended by an 
estimated 4,500 to 6,000 over four days. Forum organizer Howard 
VanCleave told NIRR the events were designed to raise thoughtful 
questions about Christ's claims to truth. Among featured speakers were 
Alvin Plantinga, director of the Notre Dame Center for Philosophy of 
Religion; Walter Bradley, professor of Mechanical Engineering at Texas 
A & M; and noted academics in the fields of astronomy, divinity, and 
law. The Lantern's response, an unsigned editorial, cited its coverage 
in announcements of the lectures the day before the Forum began. 

Mississippi can require an unmarried woman under 18 to get written 
approval from both parents or from a judge before obtaining an 
abortion, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled. The court rejected, without 
comment, a constitutional challenge to the law brought by abortion 
clinics and doctors. 
...One parent's permission is sufficient only when the parents have 
divorced, when one parent is not available in a reasonable time, or 
when the pregnancy has resulted from incest by the father. The law 
allows such a girl to avoid telling either parent if she gets the state 
court judge's permission after proving she is mature and well-informed 
enough to make the decision on her own, or that the abortion would be 
in her "best interest." Such court proceedings must be speedy and 
confidential, the justices decided. 

Demonstrators are free to carry signs naming women and teen-age girls 
who have abortions, much the way newspapers publish births, marriages 
and obituaries, Detroit Judge John Kirwan ruled. He dismissed a lawsuit 
against activists Lynn Mills and Sister Lois Mitoraj, who carried the 
signs outside a Livonia, Mich., clinic in 1991. The names came from 
abortion opponent Robert Thomas, who retrieved discarded records from a 
clinic trash bin. 

Legislation cracking down on violence at abortion clinics cleared the 
U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. The chambers hope to work out 
relatively minor differences, and President Clinton has said he will 
sign the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances bill, known as FACE. If 
enacted, the bill would prohibit destruction of clinic property, as 
well as the use of force, threats, or physical obstruction to interfere 
with women seeking abortion services. It would also allow federal 
authorities to investigate clinic attacks or impose injunctions against 
abortion foes. 
...Supporters want the law put into effect before the December trials 
of the protesters accused of the fatal shooting of Florida abortionist 
David Gunn (NIRR 3/22) and the non-fatal shooting of Kansas doctor 
George Tiller (NIRR 9/6). Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), who led the 
floor debate for the bill, said FACE does not hinder peaceful pro-life 
protests. Those who peacefully picket, pray, sing, or counsel outside 
clinics and do not block the entrances "have nothing to fear from this 
law," Kennedy said. 
...Critics say the bill interferes with free-speech rights, and imposes 
too stiff a penalty on those who stage nonviolent sit-ins or try to 
block traffic. Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) said it goes far beyond 
discouraging violent extremists, and "seeks to silence the entire 
pro-life movement" by discouraging individuals from speaking out for 
fear of "being selectively and aggressively prosecuted." First-time 
offenders would face a year in jail, and repeat offenders three years 
under the House bill. Senate penalties are not so severe, but still 
make blockades a felony. "It will not stop us," Operation Rescue 
spokesman Patrick Mahoney told reporters. 
...Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) offered a religious liberty amendment that 
would make it a federal crime to interfere with persons lawfully 
exercising their religion or to intentionally damage or destroy a place 
of religious worship. The amendment was approved on voice vote. 

The fallout continues over the disruption of a Sept. 19 church service 
by homosexual activists in San Francisco (NIRR 11/1). The offices of 
Mayor Frank Jordan and several supervisors reportedly have been flooded 
with calls from outraged Christians. In September, Hamilton Square 
Baptist Church pastor David Innes and several colleagues had asked 
believers to telephone or write to city officials in protest against 
"this travesty against our church and our religious freedoms." In 
addition, several Christian media have aired either audio or video 
tapes of the disturbance. Jordan issued a statement that said "freedom 
of religion will be protected on an equal footing with the freedom of 
assembly," but urged people not to make the city "a cause celebre for 
[an] agenda of intolerance and hate." 
...Protected by 30 "dearly-beloved black ministers-in-training," Lou 
Sheldon led several hundred Christians from across the country on a 
15-minute procession from Hamilton Square Baptist to City Hall Nov. 8. 
Sheldon, chairman of the Traditional Values Coalition, spearheaded the 
rally and march to remind the city's supervisors of their obligation to 
protect all the rights of all citizens, "even if they do not share 
their beliefs." TVC and other conservative groups began planning their 
march shortly after the incident at the church, where Sheldon was the 
featured speaker for the evening. Sheldon said that when he called for 
help, police told him that the Board of Supervisors would not support 
efforts to disband the protesters. For this reason, Sheldon told NIRR, 
men and women, many of them ministers and non-Anglos, came "to stand 
tall and strong for religious liberty" and against such "blatant 
persecution" and "anti-Christian bigotry." Carole Migden, one of the 
board's two avowed lesbian members, called the rally a 
"well-orchestrated publicity stunt to generate support for an extremist 
attack on lesbians and gay men." 
..."It's politically correct to beat up on people of the Christian 
faith," Sheldon said in the public comment portion of the meeting. A 
Baptist pastor from Kansas City told the board several major 
corporations were considering canceling conventions. The Christian 
contingent was counterbalanced by about a dozen people, most of them 
gay or lesbian, who spoke against the intolerance of the religious 
right, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Hamilton Square pastor 
David Innes said he intended to ask the board to adopt a resolution 
condemning the disturbance, but supervisors closed public testimony 
before he had the chance. 
...A gay man spit on Sheldon as he left the podium, despite the 
presence of more than 70 police officers (most in riot gear) and his 
bodyguards from the Oakland Christian Center. The incident was captured 
by local TV and Christian Broadcasting Network crews. The man was 
charged with battery, and police arrested two other men on various 
misdemeanor charges, including inciting a riot, disturbing the peace, 
trespassing, battery, and resisting arrest. Police, whom Christians 
originally accused of indifference, also say they are seeking criminal 
charges against those who damaged church property. 

The U.S. Department of Justice went scurrying for cover after its 
change in child pornography laws was strongly criticized by Congress, 
the president, and approximately 1,500 people a day who called 
department offices. 
...The uproar came in a criminal case involving videos of young girls 
who posed seductively while wearing clothes. The department argued that 
visual depictions of children cannot be lascivious under the law unless 
genitals or pubic areas are fully visible and the conduct of the 
children depicted is intentionally sexually explicit. 
...The new doctrine "would instantly legalize the underwear-oriented 
wing of the kiddie-porn industry," said Gary Bauer of Washington-based 
Family Research Council. Much of the material is produced by bribing 
unsuspecting girls to perform "gymnastics" for the camera, and is easy 
to produce because girls need not be persuaded to undress. "Why should 
the intent of the victims -- rather than that of the perpetrators -- be 
determinative?" Bauer asked. 
...President Clinton took the unprecedented step of publicly ordering 
Attorney General Janet Reno and the Department of Justice to prepare 
new legislation after the Senate unanimously rejected the DOJ's 
interpretation. 
...What is needed is not a new law, but "to vigorously apply the 
current law," said Patrick Trueman of the American Family Association, 
who is former head of the Justice Department's Child Exploitation and 
Obscenity section. Trueman said Clinton's action was a political move 
that doesn't show a real attempt to deal with the issue. 

The $10-million sexual abuse lawsuit against Catholic Cardinal Joseph 
Bernardin may have come too late. Bernardin, 65, head of the Chicago 
diocese (the second-largest in the United States), one of the church's 
most prominent Americans, and a leader in efforts to confront sexual 
abuse by clergy, was accused of molesting a boy two decades ago. Ohio 
law requires lawsuits that allege infliction of emotional distress on 
minors to be filed within four years of the plaintiff's reaching 
adulthood, or by age 22. Bernardin's accuser, Stephen Cook, is 34. Even 
though the suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati, legal 
experts say the judge must apply state standards. 
...Cook claims that Bernardin sodomized him and that another priest, 
Ellis Harsham, repeatedly sexually molested him as a high school 
student in the 1970s. Both clerics have denied the accusation. "I have 
never abused anyone at any time at any place," Bernardin said. The 
cardinal has said he will cooperate with an investigation by the 
Professional Fitness Review Board, which he established in 1992 to deal 
with complaints against priests. Bernardin also has sought a private 
meeting with his accuser. Cook, now a substance-abuse counselor in 
Philadelphia, said he did not remember the alleged abuse until last 
month, while undergoing therapy. 
...Three of Harsham's former students said the priest showed them 
pornographic movies and fondled students, the Dayton Daily News 
reported. "He'd tell you a dirty joke in the confessional," one former 
student also said. 
...American bishops circled the wagons around Bernardin. Meeting at the 
three-day National Conference of Bishops in Washington, they applauded 
Bernardin and promised him prayers as he deals with the accusations. 
The bishops, however, asked the Vatican for more leeway to dismiss 
priests guilty of sexual abuse. A panel urged bishops to use more 
effective methods to weed out sexual abusers from the priesthood and 
help priests live chaste lives. 
...The bishops also: denounced a rising tide of hostility against 
immigrants; urged husbands to share housework; announced plans to 
mobilize a million churchgoers to lobby against abortion; advised a 
foreign policy that avoids isolationism and unwise intervention abroad; 
and condoned the use of U.S. military force to rescue people from 
hunger or mass violence. 

Without admitting liability, the Servants of the Paraclete settled out 
of court rather than face trials in which they might be penalized much 
more, the Albuquerque Journal reported. The settlement is a victory for 
25 men who say they were abused as youths by former priest James 
Porter, who received treatment for pedophilia at the order's Jemez 
Springs, N.M., center. The men will divide $525,000 in cash, plus 
another $5.6 million in damages which three companies that insured the 
center will pay. Porter, who has admitted to sexually molesting 
children in other states, is scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 6. 

If Americans would take the inspiration and infallibility of Scripture 
more seriously, and teach the Word of God, they would see church growth 
in quality as well as quantity, William Kumuyi told NIRR. The pastor of 
the 115,000-member Deeper Life Bible Church in Lagos, Nigeria, lectured 
on church growth at Fuller Seminary and was keynote speaker at the 8th 
Annual International Conference of the North American Society for 
Church Growth in Pasadena, Calif., Nov. 18-19. Encouraged by the 
resources he found in America, he said, "Some people are talking about 
the post-Christian era, but the Christian influence on your society is 
large. Maybe you take it for granted." 
...Kumuyi's church began in 1973 with 15 people, and now has 70,000 
adults. Deeper Life's trained leaders have planted 4,700 other churches 
in Nigeria, and the church has sent missionaries to 34 African 
countries. One missionary family sent to Ghana planted 450 churches, 
totaling 24,000 adults. Kumuyi attributes this growth to leadership 
development and to laity involvement. Their programs include expository 
Bible study, evening cell groups, demographic studies of needs, and use 
of all available media -- radio, video, newspapers, and cassettes -- 
for evangelism. Kumuyi also said the Nigerian church was blessed with 
"dramatic manifestations of God's power" -physical healing and 
deliverance from demonic powers. 

Church on the Way's 19th Pastors' Conference in Van Nuys, Calif., 
stressed faithfulness and fruitfulness. Many of the 1,250 ministers 
representing 26 denominations in 33 states and 10 countries called the 
Nov. 8-11 conference "as practical as any they have ever been to," Dan 
Hicks, senior associate pastor and director of the church's pastoral 
care committee, told NIRR. "Pastors came to us needing refreshment, 
having been `beaten up' in the work of ministry. Our purpose as a 
church staff was to serve them." 
...Solving the problems of racism should be among the church's top 
priorities, not the government's job, said Church on the Way pastor 
Jack Hayford. He said Jesus broke down racial barriers from the 
beginning of his ministry, and the apostles had to resolve 
Jewish-gentile issues in the early church. Hayford also emphasized the 
power of Christ's blood on behalf of ministers. He said the Lord will 
supply all they need to fulfill their task. 
...Victory Outreach founder Sonny Arguinzoni spoke on having a vision 
for ministry, rather than a maintenance mentality. When he urged those 
whose vision had died to come for prayer, more than 75 pastors 
responded. Other speakers included Charles Blake, West Angeles Church 
of God in Christ; Bob Schmidgall, Calvary Temple Assembly of God in 
Naperville, Ill.; Jim Garlow of Metroplex Chapel, Dallas-Fort Worth; 
and John Holland, president of Foursquare International. Workshops 
covered worship, study methods, ministry to spiritual-emotional needs, 
and developing lay ministry. One workshop discussed sociological 
challenges facing the church, and how to keep a social agenda from 
becoming more social than spiritual. 

The fifth annual convention of the Christian Community Development 
Association drew 1,200 black, Hispanic, white, and Asian Christians to 
Jackson, Miss., late in October. At the four-day conference, network 
members and urban ministries from 90 cities in 35 states and four 
countries addressed economic development, AIDS ministries, justice, 
racial reconciliation, health-care reform, leadership training, 
housing, and the role of the local church. Innercity outreaches, youth 
panels, community organizations, churches, and colleges provided 
resources and exchanged strategies for effective ministry. CCDA also 
provides membership directories, consultations, regional workshops, job 
placement services, and monthly publications to address issues often 
associated with ministry to the poor. "We have redefined the gospel 
because we're a living demonstration of God's love," CCDA founder John 
Perkins told NIRR. 
...Perkins started CCDA in Jackson, so this year's convention theme was 
"Looking Back, Moving Forward." Attendance has grown from 60 to 1,200 
in five years. "People have responded because CCDA is radical and 
relevant, and because the government is not doing it," conference 
administrator Adonya Seldon told NIRR. CCDA President Wayne Gordon of 
Chicago's Lawndale Community Church said CCDA has "minimal national 
authority," and "appeals to the `average' person." Perkins said CCDA 
had "helped bridge the gap between evangelism and social action." 
..."Christians in America have preached only half the gospel -- 
personal salvation," plenary speaker Tom Skinner said. The Harlem 
evangelist and community developer said evangelicals often erroneously 
portray poverty as only a spiritual problem, and ignore the economic 
issues that perpetuate it. "If we are going to help poor people, we 
need to start telling them the truth." Perkins, Noel Castellanos of 
Chicago's LaVillita Community Church, Dolphus Weary of Mendenhall 
Ministries, Robert Lupton of Atlanta's FCS Ministries, and former 
Philadelphia Mayor Wilson Goode also spoke. Gordon called all members 
to focus their ministries on people, not programs. "We must pray, seek 
God's face, and repent for forcing our own ideas on the poor." Eastern 
College President Roberta Hestenes said, "The model of the Christian 
life lived out in the toughest places in the world is the most powerful 
tool for evangelism." 

Two days of debate with their younger counterparts prompted the old 
guard among Evangelicals for Social Action to scrap their draft for the 
Chicago Declaration II. Some 120 theologians, businesspersons, 
musicians, professors, writers, and activists had gathered to 
"reconsider what we should do in the midst of a worsening social and 
moral crisis" that has taken place in the 20 years since their original 
proclamation was published. Many of the signers of the first Chicago 
Declaration (such as ESA President Ron Sider, Sojourners founder Jim 
Wallis, and urban community developer John Perkins) abandoned their 
rough four-page document, and created another that reflected the 
concerns of the younger leaders: racism, xenophobia, the religious 
right, sexism, family values, and environmentalism. Overnight, core 
leaders, along with selected younger members, redrafted a two-page 
document, combining repentance and remorse for much of the past with 
dreams, prayers, and commitments for the future. The paper was 
presented to the 500 ESA conference participants at the final meeting 
Nov. 21. 
..."We made a conscious effort to encourage our younger evangelical 
leaders here. We value their input," Sider told NIRR. He said the 
document will be distributed in interested denominations, churches, and 
ministries, as well as in ESA's new monthly magazine, PRISM, in hopes 
of fostering "a vision for holistic ministry." Wallis told NIRR he was 
hopeful the event would move the group forward. "There is more 
evangelical social concern than in 1973, and yet the public perception 
of the word evangelical is right-wing. We have to deal with that 
paradox." International evangelist Vinay Samuel said the document would 
be shared internationally. "What happens in America's Christian 
community affects the rest of us in the Two-Thirds world. This 
encourages more holistic partnerships in missions." 
..."These younger leaders feel like they discovered a new community," 
PRISM Editor Gordon Aeschliman told NIRR. He said 40% of the conference 
participants are under 40 years old. Many are graduate students, 
grassroots activists, and editors whose names could emerge as leaders 
in the future. "The core leaders' willingness to include us modeled a 
partnership and sensitivity to the Holy Spirit -- Kingdom values for 
social activists," he said. 
...Not everyone, though, was as excited about the ESA meeting. A 
handful of protesters picketed with signs that said, "Campolo, Foster, 
Sider, GO HOME" and "Christian Rock Kills." The placards referred to 
workshop leaders: Eastern College professor Tony Campolo, writer 
Richard Foster, and a conference-sponsored rock concert with musicians 
Phil Keaggy, Randy Stonehill, and Rick Elias. ESA staff member Allen 
Johnson told NIRR that he had talked with the protesters and invited 
them to the congress, but they felt "the conference was ushering in the 
New Age because social ministry doesn't change hearts, and to come in 
would give the appearance of evil." 
..."The time has come to create Christian prisons," Campolo said. 
"Current prisons are schools for crime." Campolo also advocated gun 
control, victims' rights, economic development, environmental concerns, 
and greater evangelical acceptance of those who struggle with 
homosexual desires. Campolo did not approve of gay and lesbian 
behavior, but disapproved "of a church that has quit loving the 
oppressed whom Jesus never stopped loving." Other workshop leaders 
included missiologist/seminary professor Samuel Escobar, Concerts of 
Prayer founder David Bryant, Eastern College President Roberta 
Hestenes, Episcopal Bishop William Frey, and writer/professor Howard 
Snyder. 
..."Twenty years ago we started something, and have kept it on the 
burner," Perkins, often referred to at the conference as the Dean of 
Social Action, told NIRR. "This statement will have impact only if we 
live it out." 
...The new visionaries probably will come from the streets, Wallis told 
NIRR. Last spring he helped coordinate the Kansas City national gang 
summit (NIRR 5/17). He now is involved in creating a national, 
church-based support network that encourages gang truces. It would 
build on earlier summits, regional meetings with gang members, and the 
National Coalition to End Barrio Warfare. "Gang members who want to 
stop the violence told me they just woke up," and evangelicals could 
fill the vacuum by drawing kids "into a movement that is known for its 
compassion rather than its exclusion." Wallis also said pastors must 
stop thinking of themselves as just maintenance people, and see 
themselves as co-visionaries who help people see new possibilities in 
their communities. 
..."I hope to God we will make progress on the dignity and equality of 
women, and on racial reconciliation by the next Chicago Declaration," 
Sider told NIRR. He said the 2,000-member organization is growing so 
quickly that it has refocused its mission to help provide tools for 
holistic ministry to 1,000 leaders and churches. "But we must continue 
to recover a sense of holiness, prayer, evangelism, and the power of 
the Spirit." 
...The arts provide an arena for Christian witness and social action, 
ESA workshop leaders said. Aeschliman said that to reach Generation X 
(the 20-something crowd), "Christian leaders have to link artists with 
society. Art is a significant part of spirituality; it's our ability to 
touch society." Rez Band's Glenn Kaiser told NIRR that too many 
Christian artistic decisions "are market-driven rather than Spirit-led. 
But artists are the conscience of the world." Word/Epic Records 
Marketing Director Tom Willett said thinkers should "determine a 
Christian aesthetic," and the group should devote itself "to new ways 
of integrating faith with the arts." 

Katherine Marshall's Christy will become a CBS TV series. Although the 
late author is best-known for A Man Called Peter, the story of her 
first husband, Presbyterian pastor and U.S. Senate Chaplain Peter 
Marshall, Christy is considered the first modern Christian novel to 
successfully cross over into the secular market. Since its publication 
in 1967, it has sold more than 8 million copies in 84 printings. The 
novel is based on the experiences the author's mother had while 
teaching school in rural Tennessee as a teen-ager in 1912. 
...MGM had planned to film Christy in the late 1960s. When the company 
was sold, the project was dropped. MTM Productions acquired the rights 
and began filming in the Great Smoky Mountains in September. Kellie 
Martin (Life Goes On) plays Christy; Tyne Daly (Cagney and Lacey) plays 
Miss Alice, a Quaker mission worker; and Tess Harper (Tender Mercies) 
plays Fairlight. Ken Wales and Barney Rosenzweig are co-producing the 
series, which will run as a two-hour pilot Jan. 1 or 2, and in six 
one-hour episodes. 
..."Intense spiritual warfare" between Christian and secular forces has 
accompanied the filming, Marshall's second husband, Leonard LeSourd, 
told NIRR from Townsend, Tenn. "The enemy doesn't like this." LeSourd 
and his wife, Sandra, are spending November on location as unofficial 
advisers. "We have a lot of people praying. wife, Sandra, are spending 
November on location as unofficial advisers. "We have a lot of people 
praying."

Vol. 7, No. 24                                                     
November 15, 1993 

President Bill Clinton asked 12 evangelical leaders for spiritual 
guidance at a White House breakfast Oct. 18. Those attending were 
pastor Bill Hybels of Willow Creek Community Church; Christian 
Community Development Association leader John Perkins; Fuller 
Seminary's new President Richard Mouw; Taylor University President Jay 
Kesler; Foursquare pastor Jack Hayford of The Church on the Way; Azusa 
Pacific University professor Jesse Miranda; Eugene Habecker of the 
American Bible Society; World Vision's Bob Seiple; Wheaton College 
history professor Mark Noll; author and Christianity Today columnist 
Philip Yancey; and Eastern College President Roberta Hestenes and 
sociology professor Tony Campolo. The Washington Times indicated that 
Christianity Today Executive Editor David Neff was involved in the 
selection of those invited, but NIRR sources indicated Hybels helped 
select the participants at the meeting. 
...Vice President Al Gore and some of Clinton's staff joined the 
president as he asked for, and listened to, each leader's concerns. 
Reporters were not invited to the meeting because, as the president 
said, "There is no agenda." He said he simply wanted to hear from 
people in the evangelical community, and to meet for Christian 
fellowship, sources told NIRR. White House Press Secretary Dee Dee 
Myers described the closed meeting, Clinton's second with evangelicals 
(NIRR 9/6), as "charging his batteries." 
..."People have asked me, sometimes mockingly, can someone be a 
Christian and a Democrat?" Hestenes told NIRR after the meeting. "And 
my own answer is: this president is both. I'm absolutely convinced of 
his deep and sincere faith. He knows his Bible." Hestenes also said 
each member of the group was given the freedom to express his or her 
own concerns and issues as the president listened and asked questions. 
The 12 were not "co-opted, but went to the White House with our own 
convictions. It was a significant time of sharing," she said. Noll told 
NIRR the meeting was "an intentional combination of real religion and 
real politics -- which is hard to disentangle." Clinton, he said, had a 
"genuine religious motive" for holding the meeting, which also served a 
"political purpose." Hestenes also indicated the high point of the 
meeting for her "was the opportunity to pray for the president at his 
request." 
...The meeting showed progress, Perkins told NIRR. "We ought to be 
encouraged by what we're seeing in his openness, but not gullible 
enough to [think we're] `deal making.' I feel nothing but hopefulness 
in where we have come so far." He said the leaders helped sensitize 
Clinton to evangelical and biblical concerns, and let him "know we are 
his friends -- in terms of trying to help him, stir him, and pray for 
him as he guides the people." Perkins said although Clinton expresses 
his faith differently from many evangelicals, that is not the issue. 
"The crisis in evangelicalism is that we've allowed issues to divide, 
and have missed opportunities." Clinton assured the leaders of an 
ongoing dialogue, and future meetings between the administration and 
the evangelical community are likely. 

Democrats and Republicans are almost equally likely to say they hold 
Judeo-Christian religious beliefs, a Gallup poll of more than 40,000 
1992 voters indicates. Of Democrats, 89% say they fit the profile, with 
39% calling themselves born-again Christians. For Republicans, the 
figures are 91% and 41%, respectively. Democrats are more likely to say 
religion is very important in their lives (65% to 63%), but Republicans 
are more likely to be church members (79% to 71%) and to have attended 
services recently (50% to 39%). Independents are less likely to be 
church members or to consider religion important. About 65% of both 
Democrats and Republicans say religion is losing influence in American 
life, but about 63% of both say it provides relevant solutions to 
modern problems. 

Pepperdine University is experiencing "great spiritual renewal" in the 
aftermath of California's recent fires, according to campus minister 
Scott Lambert. Flames burned a 10-mile path to the school, affiliated 
with the Church of Christ, and encircled it. Two of the 26 fires raging 
across Southern California threatened Pepperdine employees and 
buildings many times. At the advice of firefighters, who set up their 
command center on campus, 400 of the 1,600 students in campus housing, 
plus some faculty families, took refuge overnight in the gym rather 
than evacuating. Lambert told NIRR there was a "tremendous sense of 
peace" there. His family spent much of the night in their car on a 
roadside "watching the glow on the side of the hill" and praying. He 
called it a "God-fearing moment." 
...The next night, 75 students, "twice the usual number," met for a 
midweek prayer service at which Lambert discussed the power and mighty 
works of God. He challenged students to use this as an opportunity to 
give non-Christians a godly perspective on tragedy and what really 
matters in life. Flames, which leveled 390 homes in Malibu, came within 
100 yards of Pepperdine buildings. Classes resumed when roads opened 
three days later. The Sunday after the fires, at Malibu Church of 
Christ on the Pepperdine campus, pastor Dan Anders preached 
"Thanksgiving Came Early," a sermon on God's mercy and on supporting 
those who suffer. "God is merciful," Lambert said, adding there is no 
simple answer as to why some "righteous people" in the area lost homes. 
...The fires came within a few blocks of the U.S. Center for World 
Mission in Pasadena, which houses dozens of Christian ministries. June 
Douglas of the Zwemer Institute reported conditions were "terribly 
smoky and dirty," with "embers and ashes everywhere." She said planes 
were dropping clouds of pink fire retardant on the surrounding hills as 
she went to work. Fuller Seminary canceled classes so faculty, staff, 
and students living in threatened areas of Pasadena could check on 
their homes. School of Mission Dean Dudley Woodberry and his wife, 
Roberta, were among those evacuated for a night. Reinhard Bonnke 
Ministries in Laguna Hills remained safe, unlike much of the hard-hit 
Laguna Beach area. 
..."It's OK to cry. We have Kleenex in the pews for you today," pastor 
David Worth told those who assembled at his Malibu Presbyterian Church 
for an interdenominational sharing and healing service. There local 
clergy and the community honored firefighters, shared griefs, and 
celebrated victories. "To those of you who lost homes, our hearts go 
out to you," he said. Dan and Lisa Cislo were among 15 church families 
whose homes burned. "It's hard to feel like a victim when everyone -- 
people we know and total strangers -- has been so gracious," Lisa said. 
..."Fire Victims Help Yourself" read the sign above piles of donated 
goods ranging from beds to bicycles outside Our Lady of Malibu Catholic 
Church. Several churches in affected areas set up Red Cross relief 
centers and collection points for food and clothing. A local Christian 
psychologist, Pepperdine, and UCLA faculty members are offering 
workshops on traumatic stress on Pepperdine's campus and in various 
religious facilities across the area. 

A late-night Nov. 4 fire gutted Ellis Hall, a men's dormitory at Church 
of God's Lee College in Cleveland, Tenn. All 72 students escaped, but 
about 20 were hospitalized for burns, smoke inhalation, or other 
injuries. Some who leapt from second-story windows suffered cuts and 
broken bones. The cause of the fire, possibly an arson, which 
apparently began in a ground-floor prayer room, is under investigation. 
Some 100 firefighters brought the blaze under control after four hours. 
David Tilley, Lee's vice president, told NIRR donations from the 
2,000-member student body and community have been overwhelming. 
Businesses nationwide have offered assistance and services, he said. 

Jerry Falwell's Liberty University managed to avoid foreclosure when 
investors agreed to take on the school's $16 million debt (NIRR 6/14). 
Household Finance Corp. held the third and last lien against the 
Lynchburg, Va., campus. Before classes started in August, the company 
had indicated it planned to foreclose on the property. But a company 
spokesman said HFC had recently sold the debt to a group of local 
investors. Terms of their agreement keep the names of the buyers and 
the sale price confidential. Liberty has 4,800 students enrolled this 
semester. 

By a 2-1 margin, California voters defeated Proposition 174, which 
would have given parents tax-funded vouchers to help finance their 
childrens' education. Dennis Brown, superintendent of Brethren 
Christian Junior and Senior High School in Cypress, told NIRR that 
voters were frightened by the "scare tactics" and power of the 
opposition. Brown said powerful lobbies and critics of the measure 
probably could have prevented implementation, had it passed, because 
"their coffers are unlimited." 
...Brown called the present system "taxation without representation," 
but was concerned that vouchers would give government a "foot in the 
door" of Christian schools. He also said parents who pay less might be 
less committed to Christian education. "People who can't afford to send 
their kids here do anyway -- they sacrifice. Our open houses are 
packed," he said, adding, "Where your treasure is, there your heart 
is." 
...The Association of Christian Schools International found 132 of its 
member schools in California supported the voucher proposal, 21 were 
opposed, and 25 were neutral. ACSI took no position on the proposition. 

Teach religion and have prayer in school, British parents said. A 
recent National Opinion Poll showed 58% of parents preferred that their 
children receive a religious rather than a non-religious moral 
education. England's Alpha magazine said parents expressed several 
reasons they endorsed teaching about God and prayer: 20% wanted to 
inspire their children's faith, 38% considered it instruction in 
history and culture, and 36% wanted to teach a moral code. 
...England's 1988 Educational Reform Act mandates daily worship in 
British schools, but government inspectors found that barely 50% meet 
the requirement. Local committees are required to ensure that half of 
religious education content is about Christianity. Some say other 
national curriculum requirements are squeezing out the religious 
instruction. A survey of local religious education officials showed 
that only a minority mentioned any need for Bible readings and hymns. 
...British parents, however, regard religious education to be more 
important than music or art instruction. About 46% of those that The 
Independent surveyed thought the Bible should be taught as truth, and 
70% wanted prayers to be conducted. Eight in 10 parents thought their 
children should learn about faiths other than their own, but seven in 
10 also believed parents should have the right to withdraw their 
children from religious activities. 

The British Parliament has cleared most of the Anglican Church's 
hurdles to ordaining women. Within a week of each other, the House of 
Commons voted 215-21 in favor of the move, and the House of Lords 
rejected an opposing amendment 135-25, automatically passing the 
ordination legislation. Parliamentary approval and royal assent are 
necessary for key modifications of Church of England policy, since 
Anglicanism is the state faith. The Church of England's leading 
figures, Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey and Archbishop of York 
John Habgood, applauded Parliament's approval, and urged unity within 
the church. Twelve of the 70 million-member Anglican Communion's 28 
self-governing provinces, including the U.S. Episcopal Church, already 
allow women priests. 
...The conservative evangelical Church Society had mounted a legal 
challenge, saying ordination of women priests represented a 
"fundamental change" in Anglican doctrine. As such, it was not within 
the scope of powers delegated to the Church Assembly in 1919, and to 
the General Synod in 1969 as the church's top policy-making body. The 
society also said such major changes required an Act of Parliament in 
order not to lower the status of the church as England's established 
faith. The Ecclesiastical Committee, a group of 30 members from both 
houses, approved the church's proposal July 12. Judges, however, ruled 
in favor of the Anglican Church in the dispute. 
...Queen Elizabeth is expected to sign the law prior to the General 
Synod's special Feb. 22 meeting, at which it will approve the canons 
necessary to implement the law. The body is also expected to establish 
three "flying bishops" to oversee the parishes that oppose women's 
ordination on theological grounds. News reports indicated the first 
women priests could be ordained by April, but probably after Easter, 
since ordination is uncommon during the Lenten season. Catholic 
Cardinal Basil Hume said England's Catholic churches continue to 
prepare to accept Anglican laypersons and priests who change their 
denominational loyalty in protest. 

The Episcopal Church placed its first U.S. female bishop Nov. 1, with 
the consecration of Mary Adelia McLeod as head of the Diocese of 
Vermont's 10,000 members. Although the conservative Episcopal Synod of 
America protested that women's ordination is contrary to Scripture and 
church tradition, Presiding Bishop Edmond Browning installed McLeod, 
55, in the presence of her son, Harrison, and husband, Henry, both 
ordained priests. McLeod has served with her husband as co-rector of 
Charleston, W.Va.'s St. John's Church since 1983. Also attending the 
ceremony were Barbara Harris of Massachusetts, who was the world's 
first woman consecrated as a suffragan, or assistant bishop, and Jane 
Dixon of Washington, D.C., the only other U.S. woman to hold the 
suffragan post. McLeod described her election as "a message to women," 
and "a sign of hope." 

When William Farmer became a Catholic layman, he lost his membership in 
the United Methodist Church, the UMC's Judicial Council decided at its 
session Oct. 27-30 in Atlanta. The nine-member high court upheld a 
Texas bishop's ruling that church law does not allow an ordained UMC 
minister "to hold membership simultaneously in another denomination," 
United Methodist News Service reported. Farmer's 1990 decision to join 
the Catholic church, which he said was a gesture toward ecumenical 
unity, constituted a withdrawal from the UMC, and thus terminated his 
membership. The council said church law allows ordained clergy to 
minister in other denominations in "Word, Sacrament, and Order," but 
does not permit dual membership. 

James Jelinek was installed as Episcopal bishop of Minnesota Oct. 29, 
despite two challenges over his views on homosexual ordination. One 
complaint came from the conservative group Episcopalians United, which 
contended that the diocese considered only those open to homosexuals' 
ordination. Another concern of opponents was that Jelinek, 51, had said 
he would not be bound by the bishops' standard vow on the matter. 
Presiding Bishop Edmond Browning turned complaints aside, saying a 
majority of 117 standing committees consented to Jelinek's election, as 
did a majority of 112 diocesan bishops. Both were needed for the former 
San Francisco pastor's consecration to proceed. To consider ways 
evangelical institutions should address the needs and demands of 
homosexuals, about 65 Christian leaders and academics met at Geneva 
College for three days in October. The invitation-only conference was 
billed as "Homosexuality Debates: An Evangelical Perspective." Such 
deliberation was long overdue, according to John White, president of 
the Beaver Falls, Pa., school. Sessions included a graphic video on gay 
lifestyles and sexual practices, discussions by ministers who were once 
practicing homosexuals, and academic studies on what causes individuals 
to "turn gay." Issues of military and church leadership, housing and 
educational discrimination, and personal counseling of homosexual 
Christians were addressed. 
...Conclusions? "Homosexuality is complicated," one Wheaton, Ill., 
participant said. Psychologist Phillip Van Bruggen, who led one of the 
sessions, said participants' talks were compassionate and scripturally 
based -- and that all agreed that sexual practices outside heterosexual 
marriage are "not justified." Otherwise, participants reached no 
uniform views or policy decisions, he told NIRR. Lynn Buzzard, head of 
the newly founded Geneva Center for Law and Public Policy, planned to 
issue a conference summary. The college co-sponsored the event along 
with the National Association of Evangelicals and various other 
evangelical professional societies. 

About 62% of Cincinnati voters said yes to Issue 3, reversing a 1992 
anti-discrimination ordinance protecting those of "homosexual, lesbian, 
or bisexual orientation." The city council passed the civil rights 
protections for homosexuals 11 months ago, but voters nullified the 
measure, saying homosexuals should not be given additional civil rights 
clout in hiring or housing. Mark McNeil, who owns five Christian radio 
stations, spearheaded the initiative, which was promoted under the 
slogan "Equal Rights, Not Special Rights." The wording of the measure, 
which avoided religious and moral arguments, was nearly identical to 
that of Colorado's Amendment 2, currently under state Supreme Court 
scrutiny to determine its constitutionality. News accounts indicated 
that out-of-state groups donated $150,000 to the Cincinnati effort to 
amend the law; about half those funds came from Amendment 2's 
promoters, Coloradans for Family Values. In response, several groups 
that opposed Issue 3 have issued boycotts or canceled conventions. 
...Voters in Lewiston, Maine, repealed by a 2-1 margin specific 
gay-rights protections, and Portsmouth, N.H., voters passed by a 3-2 
ratio a non-binding referendum that denies protection from 
discrimination based on sexuality. 

In cases of divorce, only the parent with legal custody of the children 
may direct their religious training, the Canadian Supreme Court ruled 
Oct. 21. The court decided against James Chen Young, a Jehovah's 
Witness who wanted to raise his three children in his faith. His 
ex-wife, Irene, a member of the United Church, objected, saying her 
custody allowed her to oversee their spiritual upbringing. The court 
agreed with the mother, saying custody also granted the right to make 
major decisions on the minors' schooling and health care. The judges 
said the children's best interests must take precedence over arguments 
that their father's faith would not harm them. Religious freedom is not 
absolute in Canada, the court said. Although Young cannot force his 
children to attend church services with him, he may talk about his 
faith when they visit, as long as the discussions do not distress the 
children. 

President Clinton's signature is expected soon on the Religious Freedom 
Restoration Act, passed 97-3 by the Senate Oct. 27. The legislation, a 
slight modification of the version the House passed in May, was backed 
by a wide variety of interfaith, religious-interest, and church-state 
separation groups. The act will restore the "compelling state interest" 
test for government interference in religious practices, and require 
that any restrictions must be imposed in the least burdensome way. The 
bill allows for exceptions for cases of public health or safety. The 
"compelling state interest" standard was in effect for 30 years until 
the U.S. Supreme Court's 1990 ruling in Employment Division v. Smith. 
Voting 6-3 in the Oregon case, the high court ruled that unemployment 
compensation was unjustified for state workers fired for using peyote 
in Native American worship. Since then, religious groups have sought to 
restore what they deem full religious freedom. The Senate also refused 
58-41 to exempt prisoners from coverage under the new law. State 
attorney generals had said the RFRA might impede order and security in 
correctional facilities. 

After saying they received threats that they "wouldn't come back 
alive," 13 former members of Set Free Christian Fellowship canceled a 
news conference in Visalia, Calif. They had planned to "go public" with 
allegations that the Anaheim-based organization's leader, Phil Aguilar, 
45, abused his position of authority. 
...Set Free, its membership down to about 350 from a peak of 5,000, 
recently relocated in Visalia. Twelve local pastors tried to meet with 
Aguilar, who was once imprisoned after drug and child abuse 
convictions, to discuss the claims, but were unsuccessful. They then 
sent a letter voicing their "grave concern" to 237 school districts, 
radio stations, newspapers, and ministerial fellowships in three 
counties. Enclosed with the letter were a study by cult researcher 
Ronald Enroth and an article from Christianity Today that detailed 
charges against Aguilar. Pastor Jeff Pierce of Immanuel Christian 
Fellowship told NIRR that Aguilar may have thought Visalia was a 
"podunk backwoods town" that he could "hoodwink as he has Anaheim," 
where the mayor and chief of police were strong supporters. 
...Set Free members accuse the concerned pastors of jealousy, and told 
NIRR the group's purpose is to "save souls." Since relocating, Set Free 
has held anti-drug assemblies in public schools, purchased two 
businesses, donated weight equipment to the Police Activities League, 
and performed other community outreaches. In response to the pastors' 
request for a meeting, a spokesperson for Aguilar announced that Set 
Free will leave Visalia. Aguilar has sent his assistant, Wayne Palmer, 
to Seattle with about 25 members, Palmer's daughter reported. 
...Transcribed interviews with 13 ex-members, several of them related 
to Aguilar by marriage, repeatedly refer to mind control, child and 
spousal abuse, financial mismanagement, and health violations. They 
said they continue to fear Aguilar's power over them, and his violent 
temper. They took their allegations to the Orange County District 
Attorney's office. Senior investigator Jerry Hodges told NIRR criminal 
activity could not be corroborated. 
..."There's not a day we don't praise God we're out," Chuck and Sheila 
Walstead, who left Set Free last year after seven years, told NIRR. 
Despite professional help, Sheila says her sense of betrayal and hurt 
run so deep that she finds it hard to trust people or commit to a new 
church. "It's like a death. I feel as if Phil took something I'll never 
get back, but I know God's bigger than that." Another ex-member, Eileen 
Jackson, who spent more than three years in Set Free with her husband 
and two sons, denied that they are full of bitterness and anger. "The 
Bible says to shine a light on a false teacher. We want to see him 
stopped." 

Ternae Jordan's cry to "Stop the Madness" (NIRR 11/1) hit home Oct. 27 
when his son was shot in the head, a random victim of an inner-city 
squabble. The Fort Wayne, Ind., pastor's 15-year-old namesake was 
wounded while waiting for a ride home from piano lessons at the Old 
Fort YMCA downtown. Police Sgt. Jim Zamora said some youths had been 
expelled from the building for fighting earlier that evening. When they 
took their dispute outside, it turned violent. Shots fired into the 
YMCA lobby struck the young Jordan in the back of the head. Rushed to 
St. Joseph Medical Center in critical condition, the boy initially was 
given little chance for survival. Parishioners from the Greater 
Progressive Baptist Church joined their minister and his wife to pray 
for God's intervention. The boy's condition has stabilized, although 
doctors still have been unable to remove the bullet from his brain. 
Jordan said his son has been able to squeeze his mother's hand and 
respond to some commands. 
..."If God wants to use Ternae Jordan, Jr., to help stop the violence . 
. . then we're willing," the pastor tearfully said at a news conference 
the day after the shooting. He said his son's injury will only 
intensify efforts to bring an end to urban violence in Fort Wayne. 
Mayor Paul Helmke said the shooting serves to remind people to stick 
together, and watch for suspicious activity. Police Chief Neil Moore 
said a 17-year-old has been arrested, but the youth's identity will not 
be released unless he is charged as an adult. 

Prayer lowers blood pressure, helps heal wounds, heart ailments, and 
headaches, and even influences the action of bacteria and medications. 
Larry Dossey, chief of staff of Dallas Hospital's Medical City and a 
battalion surgeon in Vietnam, compiled medical evidence to prove it in 
his book, Healing Words: The Power of Prayer and the Practice of 
Medicine. The internist told workshop members at the C.G. Jung 
Institute, West Los Angeles, that the medical profession has "skirted a 
gold mine of information" in ignoring the beneficial effects of prayer 
and meditation on patients -- although intercession should be a partner 
with, not a substitute for, drugs and surgery. Effective prayer can 
take many forms, from specific requests to providential phrases such as 
"Thy will be done" or "Let it be," he said. 
...Strong religious beliefs make growing old easier, say researchers at 
Southern California College. They found that the elderly who actively 
practice their faith tend to be more optimistic and cope with illness 
better than their nonreligious peers. In a study of senior citizens, 
with an average age of 73, more than 90% said prayer was important, and 
God was a source of strength and support in hard times; 84% said their 
relationship with God helped prevent loneliness. The results were 
released at a joint meeting of the Society for the Scientific Study of 
Religion and the Religious Research Association last month in Raleigh, 
N.C. Lead researcher Shirley Albertson Owens said the findings are 
another positive correlation between faith and aging, and that medical 
professionals and religious leaders should not discount the spiritual 
needs of older people with failing health. 

With the successful cloning of a human embryo, science caught up with 
science fiction and surged ahead of ethics, religious leaders said. 
They expressed concern after an announcement that researchers at George 
Washington University Medical Center duplicated human embryos, which 
developed abnormally. 
...Scientists said cloned embryos could be frozen so infertile couples 
could later conceive identical twins or triplets. Representatives for 
key religious bodies condemned the research as a potential 
commercialization, animalization, and devaluation of human life. The 
research raises questions of embryo ownership, and could encourage 
cloning to provide body parts for a sort of human organ farm, they 
said. The Vatican, which condemns most reproductive technology, 
requested a ban on what it called perverse research, and the United 
Methodist Church called for an executive order that bans human cloning 
at all facilities that receive federal funds. 

Joshua Vandervelden is not entitled to $1.1 million from the doctor who 
tried to abort him in 1979. The U.S. Supreme Court let stand, without 
comment, a Wisconsin appeals court ruling that he could not 
successfully sue Benjamin Victoria because Vandervelden's mother, Linda 
Noie, had hired the physician to end her pregnancy sometime between its 
sixth and eighth week. The procedure was a failure, and Joshua was born 
with ear damage. A jury originally agreed with Vandervelden that 
Victoria was guilty of battery -- unlawful and intentional use of force 
resulting in physical harm. But the appeals court said that never 
before had a fetus that could not live outside the womb been 
"considered to be a person entitled to legal protection." 

Violent abortion protests should be left to men, said Rachelle 
"Shelley" Shannon, who acknowledged shooting abortion provider George 
Tiller (NIRR 9/6). In an interview with the Wichita Eagle, Shannon, who 
is being held on $1 million bail, said now she believes that "as far as 
guns and bombs and that kind of thing," women "should just stay out of 
the way." Still, Shannon, who has pleaded innocent to attempted murder, 
believes her attack on Tiller was justified, although she did "a lousy 
job." She said, "I'll always know I did the right thing." 

"I need to raise $1.89 million right now. The Lord gave me a vision to 
revive Christian radio in America," talk show host Bob Larson said on 
his Nov. 2 broadcast. "I've got Jesus and you. You haven't done 
enough." Larson said God told him the exact amount to raise. "When God 
gives you a vision, you don't have to check His math," he told his 
listeners. Larson's ministry reportedly is not in financial difficulty. 
..."I get in a lot of trouble because . . . I'm not as dead, boring, 
and unannoying as the rest of the folks are out there in Christian 
radio," Larson said. His call for funds came after two Crawford 
Broadcasting Co. radio stations stopped carrying his live Denver-based 
TalkBack show, and changed to Christian music-only format, leaving 
Larson's show aired on only one local station. Larson and his office 
were not specific about use of the money because "enemies and critics" 
would try to stop him, he said. He later said he wanted to buy a 
religious radio network. 

Sam Chappell, former attorney for several Christian artists, including 
Petra and DC Talk, was sentenced on Oct. 8 to 25 months in prison (NIRR 
5/3). Chappell pleaded guilty in a Nashville court to two counts of 
fraud, and admitted to having diverted funds from his clients and 
longtime friends Sandi Patti and Carman. The judge ordered Chappell to 
repay the more than $400,000 he had taken for personal use. 

"Son of Sam" or son of God? Convicted killer David Berkowitz, whose 
notorious murder spree in the 1970s left six dead and terrorized 
thousands of New Yorkers, says he now is a Christian. Berkowitz planted 
cryptic letters at murder scenes, signed "Son of Sam," that were laden 
with satanic symbolism used to bait police and panic the public. He 
said in a series of prison interviews broadcast on the syndicated 
television show Inside Edition that a satanic cult was behind the 
murders, which he called sacrifices to the devil. Police maintain that 
Berkowitz acted alone. 
...Berkowitz, 40, is a mild-mannered prison preacher and model inmate, 
the New York Daily News reported. He uses the 16 cents an hour he earns 
as a jail janitor to send Bibles overseas. Berkowitz said he became a 
believer in 1988 when he heard God talking to him in his cell, news 
reports said. A fellow inmate gave him a Bible and changed his life, he 
said. Berkowitz is serving six 25-year sentences in a Sullivan County, 
N.Y., prison. 
...Berkowitz offered no excuse for the killings. "I am so very sorry 
that it happened," he said in the interview. "People who didn't deserve 
to have lost their lives." 

Pakistani clerics want a Christian boy tried for blaspheming Mohammed. 
Salamat Masih, believed to be 11-15 years old, and two Christian men 
were arrested in the central Punjab province, and accused of inscribing 
derogatory statements against the founder of Islam on mosques, acts 
which are capital offenses. The boy is illiterate, according to his 
attorney. Charges were raised by Maulana Fazlul Huq, a mosque prayer 
leader, and backed by other clerics who organized demonstrations 
outside a courthouse demanding the boy's execution. Masih has spent six 
months in jail, but has been ordered released on bail by Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto. The adults, also charged with blasphemy, have been 
refused bail. 

The entire Christian community of the Persian Gulf nation of Bahrain 
sponsored an October lecture series by scholar and apologist Ravi 
Zacharias. The Islamic government of the island nation permitted the 
standing-room-only meetings, sponsored by the country's 30 churches and 
Christian organizations, according to the Norcross, Ga.-based Ravi 
Zacharias International Ministries. While all Bahraini Arabs are 
considered Muslims, churches are allowed to serve the substantial 
expatriate work force, which includes Pakistanis, Indians, Europeans, 
and Koreans. RZIM spokeswoman Danielle Durant told NIRR that Zacharias' 
message, The Journey of a Skeptic, detailed Christ's answers to four 
basic life issues that every individual faces: origin, meaning, 
morality, and destiny. Reportedly, the next night at his mosque a 
Muslim leader who attended Zacharias' lectures repeated key points from 
one of his talks. 

Chinese police in Shaanxi Province arrested 25 underground Protestants 
suspected of talking to journalists about the beating death of Lai 
Manping (NIRR 6/14). The Hong Kong-based Chinese Church Research Center 
said a missionary pastor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, informed 
them of the Sept. 1 raid. Police were reportedly angry that news of the 
incident had reached the West, and wanted to know who was responsible. 
When the pastor left Northern China in mid-October, six churchgoers 
remained jailed. 

A group of Chinese Christians has been worshiping together for five 
generations, Christian Chronicle reported. The believers describe 
themselves as New Testament Christians, practice baptism by immersion, 
and celebrate the Lord's Supper weekly. Cliff Baird, a longtime 
missionary to the Orient, spoke in August with leaders of the movement, 
which has several churches. Key church figures have been arrested and 
jailed this year by Public Security Bureau officials, who demanded they 
sign a document agreeing not to worship together. Although two 
disbanded their congregations, the leaders said they told authorities, 
"We have worshiped God for five generations. We will not stop now." 
They were released from custody, and continue to conduct worship 
services. "God will protect us," they said. 

CHINA NOTEBOOK By Edward E. Plowman 

A team of us spent two weeks last month visiting Christians in four 
major cities in southern and eastern China. I was anxious to see the 
changes since my trip there in 1988 (NIRR 5/23/88). We traveled to 
Guangzhou (formerly Canton), Nanjing (the major center of organized 
Protestant work), Shanghai, and Fuzhou. To assess the current 
situation, I attended church services and a young-adult Bible study 
session, visited seminaries and a Bible school, and interviewed scores 
of church officials, pastors, lay leaders, students, church members, 
and even recent converts, young and old alike. What I learned could 
fill a book, but I will mention just a few points in summary: 1. China 
is undergoing rapid change as new economic policies take hold and 
capital from the West pours in. Changes are occurring on the religious 
scene, too, though not as dramatically. The China Christian Council 
(CCC), the government-sanctioned Protestant organization, says nearly 
9,000 churches have reopened since 1979 (all churches had been closed 
during the Cultural Revolution and their property confiscated). The CCC 
also reports that throughout the country of 1.2 billion people, more 
than 20,000 "meeting points" have been established. CCC leaders use the 
term to differentiate between their house-church congregations and the 
thousands of independent house-churches not recognized by the 
authorities. No one really knows, nor is there a way to know, how many 
Christians there are in these churches. The official estimate is 6 to 8 
million -- the attendance the CCC reports in its churches (although 
some of its leaders privately guess twice that number). Other estimates 
range into the tens of millions. The churches increasingly are 
populated by young people. Although the government still prohibits 
baptism of minors, Sunday schools and youth groups are being 
established. Of late, there also has been a revival among older and 
retired believers, many of them well-educated. They have begun 
returning to the churches after hiding their faith for decades, some 
even joining the Communist Party, to protect prestigious jobs and 
social positions. Several -- an English teacher, a literacy worker, an 
organist, and a choir director -- told me they are ashamed of their 
past, and are devoting "100%" of themselves to "the Lord's work" to 
"make up for the lost years." Many churches are sponsoring literacy 
classes that use the Bible as the main text, to reach people from 
minority language backgrounds. A growing number of churches also are 
hosting English study classes, using dual-language Today's English 
Version Bibles and English-Chinese hymnbooks as texts. 2. Bibles are 
rolling off the Amity press in Nanjing at a record rate. We arrived in 
Nanjing on the weekend Amity celebrated the printing of the 6-millionth 
copy since its operations began in September 1987. Amity is a 
joint-venture printing company involving a secular Chinese corporation, 
the CCC, and United Bible Societies. Last year, the firm produced just 
under 1 million Bibles, along with a million hymnbooks, Bible study 
materials, and a number of books for seminary and Bible-school 
students. This year's projections call for 1.6 million Bibles, 
including 50,000 copies of a Catholic version, and 1.5 million hymnals, 
according to Mike King, an American production executive who came to 
Amity from Youth With a Mission. The Bibles are parceled out from four 
national distribution centers, including one in Beijing, the capital, 
and 28 regional ones. Each costs an average equivalent of $1, nearly a 
day's pay for many Chinese. Still, the volumes "don't last longer than 
a day in most of the centers," King said. Needs are especially great in 
rural areas, he added. 3. The churches have made great strides in 
recruiting and training a generation of new young leaders. More than 
1,000 students have graduated from the CCC's 13 seminaries (12 are 
college-level Bible schools; the anchor school, Union Seminary in 
Nanjing, offers a seven-year program). Another 800 are enrolled. Many 
hold to biblical inerrancy, a position that seems to prevail at the 
lower-level schools. Provincial and regional Bible schools have been 
organized, and are training thousands of lay leaders to head the CCC 
meeting-point congregations. These full-time resident courses of study, 
anchored to Bible exposition, last from three months to a year. 
Additionally, evening Bible school programs in a number of cities train 
other tiers of lay leadership. Church officials estimate that 100,000 
lay workers have received instruction so far. Werner Burklin, a former 
Youth for Christ evangelist, has been conducting training series for 
pastors, seminarians, and lay leaders in a number of cities. At each 
site, he leaves workbooks, and sets of six to eight books printed in 
Hong Kong as mini-libraries for churches. Burklin, whose ministry is 
based in Florida, has been making trips to China, land of his birth (to 
German missionaries), since 1981, and he has become perhaps the West's 
best-accepted itinerant worker in CCC circles. 4. The interest in 
Christianity among intellectuals is at its highest since 1949, Bishop 
K.H. Ting, the CCC's top officer, told me. Religion courses are among 
the most popular at many universities. Nanjing Seminary faculty members 
teach the religious-studies courses at the city's largest teachers' 
college. The head of the Shanghai Seminary is leading students at a 
local teachers' college in a 15-session Introduction to the Bible 
course. A number of scholarly journals deal with religion. No longer is 
Christianity seen as an opiate, Ting said. Meanwhile, groups of 
Christian students have begun to meet openly on some university 
campuses. I met a number of pastors, seminarians, and young 
professionals who said they became followers of Christ as a result of 
influence by American Christians teaching English in Chinese 
universities on a short-term basis. 5. Limitations on religious freedom 
seem to be loosening. However, at local and county levels, some 
authorities forbid congregations (both CCC and independent) to 
register, and they interfere in other ways with church work and 
leadership choices. The central authorities in Beijing seem opposed to 
such harassment, and the fact that Ting and other CCC leaders have 
called publicly for such repression to cease lends credence to this 
conclusion. The government has begun laying off many in its bloated 
Religious Affairs Bureau, and this could lessen the number of 
confrontations. CCC leaders say that many of the independent house 
churches want to register with authorities, but have been turned down. 
All that is needed is a new category of recognition, they add. Yet 
there also is the matter of control. The independents want, in effect, 
separation of church and state. As of now, the government insists on 
having some mechanism in place to monitor and regulate church 
activities in accord with social policies. For the Protestants, this 
tool has been the Three Self Patriotic Movement, but the TSPM, too, is 
evolving. Most CCC officers now hold similar titles in the TSPM. There 
are hints that this is by design as part of a future phase-out of the 
TSPM. 6. Along with all the positive signs, serious questions are 
beginning to emerge about the future of the Chinese church. The CCC is 
essentially a government-imposed church union. Many CCC leaders, young 
and old, say denominationalism will return by the end of the decade. 
Some young leaders already disagree over doctrinal distinctives, and 
are not as willing to compromise as their elder mentors. Disunity is 
ahead, several told me. Helping to fuel this trend is the influx of 
workers from ministries in Hong Kong and the West who are promoting 
their own agendas and biases. Most seem to be targeting the independent 
house churches, but some are bypassing the CCC and dealing directly 
with local CCC leaders and churches, moves that have sown seeds of 
divisiveness in the CCC. Several leaders warned the Western ministry 
"invasion" could result in further sanctions against the Chinese 
church. The bottom line: changing times and attitudes seemingly have 
brought the Chinese church to the threshold of its greatest opportunity 
for outreach in the history of the country. Some church leaders would 
caution outsiders to exert restraint and sensitivity to protect that 
opportunity exert restraint and sensitivity to protect that opportunity.

Vol. 7, No. 23                                                      
November 1, 1993 

Evangelist Nicky Cruz has been called back to the streets. The former 
New York City gang leader, whose conversion was dramatized in The Cross 
and the Switchblade, said he felt God leading him to spend more time 
doing aggressive, "in-your-face" urban outreach with his Save Our City 
projects (NIRR 3/23/92). 
..."It just seemed like the Holy Spirit was leading us to San Antonio," 
Patrick Dow of Colorado Springs-based Nicky Cruz Outreach told NIRR. 
Dow said NCO did not target the city because of its demographics, 
although Cruz is Hispanic. The city, however, has been plagued by 
drugs, violent crime, and gang activity along racial lines. For three 
weeks before the Sept. 9-12 campaign, more than 200 former addicts and 
ex-gang members from across the country pounded the pavement, parks, 
and basketball courts. The teams presented Christ through open-air 
preaching, sidewalk drama, and one-on-one witnessing "with dopers and 
gangbangers" in government housing projects and some of the city's 
roughest neighborhoods, Cruz said. He was amazed that so many 
"desperate and hopeless" street children, some as young as eight, came 
forward for prayer, "looking for a way out." More than 2,000 people 
became Christians during the three weeks, NCO reported. 
...Cruz's four nights of citywide rallies were as "fast-moving" and 
"unchurch-like as possible," Dow told NIRR. The first two, held in 
local parks, featured Christian pop and rap music. Approximately 4,500 
attended the two outdoor meetings (despite the rain), and 650 responded 
to the altar call. A key feature of Saturday's crusade at a San Antonio 
high school was the performance of The Duke of Earl II, a 20-minute, 
multimedia drama performed live by 30 former addicts and gang members 
from San Jose, Calif. Because the 7 p.m. crusade could accommodate only 
half the crowd, Cruz and the actors repeated their messages again at 
10. Hundreds responded to Cruz's invitation. 
..."Maybe you people have the answer," a police officer said after two 
gangs gave their lives to Christ at Sunday's meeting at the downtown 
Municipal Auditorium. During NCO's year-long planning, law enforcement 
officials had told them San Antonio's drug- and gang-related crime 
problems had no solution. Police had required security searches before 
allowing gang members, many of whom wore their colors for rivals to 
see, into the arena. More than 5,000 attended, and approximately 1,700 
responded to the altar call. Said Cruz, "I can assure you that the 
majority . . . were new converts, many of whom had never stepped foot 
in a church in their lives." In addition to setting up ongoing 
assistance programs with a network of established inner-city 
ministries, Dow said NCO is planning Save Our Cities campaigns for 
Phoenix, Washington, and Denver. 

God wants a place "deep in the heart of Texans," evangelist Luis Palau 
said during his Oct. 20-24 Greater Fort Worth Crusade. Focusing on 
solutions to America's ills, he said that "unless we change the heart, 
we haven't changed anything." Without a massive spiritual reawakening, 
America is just 20 years behind Europe in its rejection of 
Christianity, he told reporters. Palau, known for international 
outreach, especially in Latin America, has redirected his focus on 
re-evangelizing the United States (NIRR Special Supplement 8/9). The 
Portland, Ore.-based Luis Palau Evangelistic Association's campaign 
includes a new radio program, half-hour television specials, and 
comprehensive crusades scheduled for at least four U.S. metropolitan 
areas. 
...In Fort Worth, the Argentine-born evangelist made specific appeals 
to youth involved in gang activity, whom local police estimate to 
number about 4,000. Gang members, identifiable by their colors, came to 
the Sunday night crusade by invitation. When some gang members were 
among the first to respond to the altar call, the crowd spontaneously 
burst into applause. Fred Baye, LPEA's director of crusade media and 
public affairs, told NIRR that off-duty police officers reported seeing 
known drug sellers in the crowd. One "major" dealer reportedly went 
forward to receive Christ. Baye said 45,000 attended the crusades, and 
1,500 committed their lives to Christ. 
...The campaign was the first united, city crusade in the area since 
Billy Graham's visit 42 years ago, Baye told NIRR. About 500 churches 
in Tarrant County and the adjoining Metroplex, representing some 40 
denominations and various ethnic communities, participated in the 
crusade and related events. The weekend prior to the crusade, Palau 
held a Saturday dinner meeting with 1,800 fellow Hispanics, and hosted 
an all-Spanish service for 3,000 on Sunday night. Local cooperating 
ministries also gathered donations of non-perishable food and 
health-care products to distribute to the needy. Inner-city pastor 
Ternae Jordan is tired of burying black teen-agers who haven't had time 
to live, and is working to prevent street violence. Gang members avoid 
police, but trust Jordan, who pastors Greater Progressive Baptist 
Church in Fort Wayne, Ind. Once, before a service, a gang member called 
to tell Jordan he was about to hurt another gang member who had crossed 
him. Jordan, 36, left church, raced to the youth, and talked him out of 
it, then returned to the pulpit in time to preach. 
...But Jordan would rather prevent violence than intervene to stop it. 
Jordan, a former high school teacher, created Stop the Madness 
day-and-overnight camps, which feature physical activities, chores, 
Bible studies, and mentoring. More than 1,000 young people, some 
referred by juvenile probation officers, have attended. 
...Gang members are just kids from broken homes who are looking for 
security, Jordan told NIRR. Rather than point fingers, he helps campers 
"define their own issues" and face up to where they have been and are 
heading. In a nightly psychodrama, campers confront another camper 
playing God, who judges their deeds. "To watch them go through that is 
a very powerful thing" that jolted several gang members to turn their 
lives around, Jordan said. 

Urban youth are dancing their way out of the crises in their Atlanta 
communities. FCS Urban Ministries has created a four-part dance program 
called Moving in the Spirit. According to Executive Director Dana 
Marschalk, the program "provides a message of hope and 
self-determination" for thousands of children surrounded by poverty, 
violence, and drugs. In the Stepping Stones track of the program, about 
275 young people participate each week at 10 local community centers, 
she said. The classes introduce children to the arts as a means of 
"giving voice to issues in these children's lives." The next phase, The 
Apprentice Corporation, uses dance to teach workplace values and life 
skills to 12- to 18-year-olds. The program actually "employs" youth to 
learn the creative skill in intensive training sessions, and organizes 
extensive tours for the young artists to perform at theaters, churches, 
camps, and housing projects throughout the country. Moving in the 
Spirit also provides The Performance Company, which brings 
professionals of diverse backgrounds together to dance, and to serve as 
role models and teachers. The program includes a counseling, mentoring, 
and training center for the youth called The Resource Network. Says 
Marschalk, "We offer the skills and spiritual support they need to 
begin taking charge of their own lives. Through the art of dance, they 
shape self-esteem and discipline." 

The performing arts are the new "language" of witness in the former 
Eastern Bloc, believes Colin Harbinson, director of Youth With A 
Mission's Academy of Performing Arts in Canada. "Music, dance, drama, 
and fine arts can communicate Christ as effectively and more 
sensitively than much Western-style preaching," he said. 
...Bulgarian officials and YWAM missionaries are organizing a 
Christian-based international arts festival to be held next May in the 
capital city of Sofia. National leaders issued the invitation because 
they were impressed by a similar event in St. Petersburg, Russia, last 
year. The 1994 festival will feature performers from the United States, 
the United Kingdom, and Uganda. "We believe that the arts -- presented 
with integrity -- provide a wonderful, contextualized way of presenting 
the values of the Kingdom of God," Harbinson said. In light of the 
recent restrictions in Russia and Bulgaria, YWAM officials believe the 
arts festival is "a low-key approach" to missions. 

Since communism fell in Bulgaria, evangelical ministry -- and 
challenges to it -- have risen abruptly. According to a report in World 
Pulse, one Congregational missionary alone has planted 22 churches 
there in two years. But such growth, which is widespread, has created a 
leadership vacuum. The need for trained pastoral leadership is only 
partially being met by two non-denominational training institutions, 
the Baptist-founded 420-student Bulgarian Biblical Academy-Logos, and 
the 300-student Bulgarian Center of Christian Education. 
...The Directorate of Religious Affairs has denied recognition of an 
alliance of five Protestant denominations. News Network International 
reported native evangelical leaders see the decision as an attempt to 
prevent a religious power block. Various groups recently have been 
denied permission to build churches on their property or rent public 
halls. And missionaries, like Ben Campanjen, a Bible courier from Open 
Doors with Brother Andrew, and Augustin Vencer, international director 
for World Evangelical Fellowship, have been denied entrance into 
Bulgaria. 
...The Bulgarian mass media are frequently hostile to evangelicals, 
associating them with cult leaders David Koresh and Jim Jones, 
according to Protestant missionaries there. George Verwer, Operation 
Mobilization director, told NIRR the press claimed literature that 
evangelicals distributed fostered suicidal tendencies among the youth. 
...Some well-meaning, independent evangelists have made cultural 
blunders, warned Assemblies of God workers collaborating with the 
Bulgarian Pentecostal Union. They said Bulgarians reportedly have been 
offended by hand-clapping and waving during worship because such 
demonstration was at one time expected behavior at Communist Party 
rallies. Loud preaching, too, has disturbed Bulgarians, who prefer a 
calm, rational presentation of Scripture, they said. 
...Leaders of Bulgaria's predominant faith, the Eastern Orthodox 
Church, view all other groups as sects, said AG personnel. They said it 
is regrettable because "Bulgarian Orthodox doctrine is similar to 
Protestant doctrine," so there is a need to establish channels of 
communication to promote understanding. 

A group of U.S. pastors and theologians is seeking dialogue between 
Russia's evangelical and Orthodox groups, according to Christianity 
Today. Bradley Nassif, president of the U.S.-based Society for the 
Study of Eastern Orthodoxy and Evangelicalism (SSEOE), said during 
September meetings at Wheaton College he had urged Russian Orthodox 
leaders to participate in talks, and to facilitate establishment of a 
Moscow chapter of the 3-year-old SSEOE. The Russian Orthodox Church had 
supported legislation to limit the estimated 700 foreign, Christian 
groups active in Russia, but the proposed law was opposed by Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin and squelched by recent events. 
...As in Bulgaria, religious rivalry reportedly manifests itself in the 
Russian mass media. In early October, broadcasts in St. Petersburg 
included warnings three times daily regarding crusade rallies conducted 
by the Association of International Mission Services, a Virginia 
Beach-based missions consortium. AIMS spokeswoman Carolyn Hedgpeth told 
NIRR the warnings apparently backfired, because the St. Petersburg 
rallies, a cooperative ministry between AIMS and the Christian 
Broadcasting Network, drew larger crowds than their simultaneous 
campaigns elsewhere. Meetings resulted in the planting of three 
churches in one week. Hedgpeth said three Russian Orthodox priests 
quietly observed one of the meetings, but citizens showed no signs of 
intimidation. She said one Russian told her, in effect, "We are well 
acquainted with persecution; it's revival we need help dealing with." 

The Viet Cong imprisoned Cuong Nguyen for six years, six months, and 
eight days, including more than a year in solitary confinement for 
"pastoring a growing church." Still, he is one of many Vietnamese 
Christians ready to return to Vietnam as missionaries as soon as their 
government permits. Cuong chaired the Fifth Vietnamese Church 
Leadership Development Conference in Garden Grove, Calif. The event 
drew 126 Vietnamese Christians and veteran Vietnam missionaries from 
Canada, Australia, and Europe, as well as 500 people from the local 
community, to discuss strategy for taking the gospel to their homeland. 
Jesse Miranda of Azusa Pacific University, who spoke at the conference, 
told NIRR he sees increasing unity and teamwork among the Vietnamese. 
They are realizing that their common linguistic and cultural heritage 
makes them specialists to reach their people here and in Vietnam, he 
said. 
...Cuong hopes to establish a seminary in his homeland, which has 
permitted no theological schools since 1975. Despite alternate periods 
of boredom and of intensive interrogation day and night in the 
concentration camp, Cuong said he had a "real good time" leading 52 
other prisoners to Christ and praying with them. Since their release, 
many of his converts have written him encouraging letters, indicating 
they are teaching Sunday school and catechism classes in Vietnam. 

As October drew to a close, so did the Praying Through the 10/40 Window 
initiative (NIRR 10/4). Organizers estimate at least 20 million 
Christians in small Bible studies, schools, mega-churches, national 
networks, rallies, and conferences prayed for evangelism efforts among 
the world's least-evangelized. 
...The prayer "spread like wildfire," reported the Christian 
Information Network, a sponsor of the movement. For instance, hundreds 
of interdenominational Christians and children gathered in Brisbane, 
Australia, for concentrated times of prayer, and lessons about the 
10/40 countries. Approximately 2 million Koreans prayed, including 
several hundred who met at Kwang Lim Methodist Prayer Mountain. In 
Poland, 5,000 leaders joined together "to look beyond their own 
national struggles." And more than 100,000 of Fiji's 800,000 residents 
joined the initiative. 
..."We know that New Zealand, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam were all 
involved," according to Luis Bush of AD 2000 and Beyond. "Even nations 
in the Middle East, including 2,000 believers in the capital of one of 
that region's most closed countries, were involved." Hundreds of 
national Christians in Nepal organized a prayer march through the 
capital. Japanese believers leased a 60,000-seat stadium near Osaka for 
a prayer rally. Cambodian Christians joined at the Killing Fields 
Museum to acknowledge "the goodness of God for carrying us through such 
a national atrocity and to remind ourselves that those million people 
who died went to the next world without Christ." 
...News of the 10/40 Prayer Window was broadcast over 550 stations in 
Chile and on Back to the Bible radio broadcasts airing in 17 languages 
on 765 stations around the world. The CIN also reported that women's 
fellowships, special prayer breakfasts, and citywide rallies joined 
together in prayer. At one Louisiana Christian school, 4ththrough 
7th-graders were "trained in effective spiritual warfare and 
intercessory prayer" as a result. 
...Many nations reported that this movement brought together 
charismatics, evangelicals, and mainline church members, according to 
the CIN. The response has led organizers to schedule another prayer 
initiative for June. 

The prayers of New Providence Methodist Church were answered Oct. 16 
when Army pilot Michael Durant returned from captivity in Somalia. As 
soon as news broke that Durant's helicopter had been shot down, the 
Clarksville, Tenn., congregation began regular prayers for Michael, his 
wife, Lorrie, and their 14-month-old son, Joey. The Durants married 
five years ago at the church, where both are members, United Methodist 
News Service reported. When Durant was returned to his base at Fort 
Campbell, Ky., late the night of Oct. 16, pastor Donald Phillip Ross 
and his wife met with the family to join hands and thank God. "For me 
it symbolized all the prayers from all the world that had been lifted 
up on his behalf," Ross said. 

As news broke of lighter-than-expected verdicts in the Reginald Denny 
beating trials, relieved members of First African Methodist Episcopal 
Church gathered spontaneously at the church to praise God. Pastor Cecil 
Murray told reporters, "We seem to have had law, and not just order," 
which proved "liberty and justice aren't just for white folks." As a 
precaution, however, First AME, which led the city's efforts to heal 
and rebuild after the riots, immediately sent groups of men to 20 
locations throughout the city to defuse potential racial violence. 
Defendants Damian Williams and Henry Watson were acquitted of the more 
serious charges related to their assault on Denny during the LA riots 
last year. Defense attorneys had claimed the attack was precipitated by 
anger over the acquittal of four white Los Angeles police officers 
charged with using excessive force in the arrest of African-American 
Rodney King. 
...Williams' mother, Georgiana, credited Jesus with saving her son from 
a life in jail. She told 400 dancing, chanting, gospel-singing members 
of LA's Greater Bethany Community Church, "If anybody tells you that 
prayer doesn't work, tell them to see Mama Williams." Holding a Bible, 
she said the media never understood the source of her inner strength. 
"You see, what they didn't know: I was standing on the Word." 
...Juror 188, the only alternate not impaneled during the trial, said 
she cried when the verdicts were read. She told NIRR they sent a 
negative message: that it was OK for people who disliked or disagreed 
with the Rodney King decision to vent their anger and frustration by 
throwing rocks at cars, robbing stores, or pulling people from the 
streets and beating them up. The juror, a white woman in her 30s, also 
said that when they first were sequestered, a majority of the jury, 
which consisted of several Christians besides herself, seemed "of one 
mind" about the guilt of the defendants. She believes they were 
intimidated by the rest of the jurors. 
...E.V. Hill, pastor of Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church in LA, said 
he was "pleased with the system" and hoped people would accept the 
verdict. He told NIRR he hoped the jurors were not "guided by fear of 
racial backlash." He said such a motivation would set a "very dangerous 
precedent," conveying the message that if communities do not like 
something they can "just get mad." 
...Bob Vernon, assistant chief of police at the time of the Denny 
beating, said the trial was highly politicized. He told NIRR there was 
"no way the jury members could erase the terror of those first riots, 
even if they wanted to." But Vernon urged people to "get this behind 
us," whether they agreed with the verdict or not. 

It is only a first draft, ELCA Bishop Herbert Chilstrom is reminding 
Lutherans who are outraged by a proposed church statement on human 
sexuality. The preliminary 21-page position paper by a 17-member church 
task force contains views some have found controversial. Although 
sections on the normality of masturbation and the morality of condom 
distribution have drawn fire, the most often attacked part of the 
report deals with homosexuality. It does not address homosexual 
ordination, but says biblical references often used to condemn 
homosexuality do not speak "directly" about either "involuntary sexual 
orientation" or monogamous sexual relationships between those with a 
homosexual predisposition. The report also urged tolerance and 
"affirmation of gay and lesbian persons, and their mutually loving, 
just, committed relationship of fidelity." Chilstrom urged church 
members to respond based on a reading of the actual document, not wire 
service articles that detail, sometimes inaccurately, the most 
sensational elements of the report. The earliest the Evangelical 
Lutheran Church in America would vote on a final presentation would be 
the 1995 Churchwide Assembly. 

Most U.S. Episcopalians -- 70% -- say sexually active gays and lesbians 
still can be faithful Christians, according to a denomination-sponsored 
survey. The church polled nearly 20,000 members in 75 of 96 dioceses to 
gauge popular opinion for sexuality discussions in parishes and at a 
recent House of Bishops meeting. About 75% of the parishioners polled 
also thought heterosexual couples could live together without being 
married and still remain good Christians. Steering committee chair, 
retired Bishop O'Kelly Whitaker, said the sexual survey was the widest 
conducted by the church to date, but that participants were not 
necessarily representative Episcopalians. 

A San Francisco pastor whose church service was disrupted by gay and 
lesbian activists fears such intimidation could spread to other 
churches if left unchallenged. The Sept. 19 evening service at Hamilton 
Square Baptist Church was interrupted by 75-100 protesters who invaded 
the church grounds and blocked the doors for several hours, according 
to pastor David Innes. They also shouted at, grabbed at, and threw 
rocks at church members who tried to enter, and threatened them as they 
left the service, he said. A woman demonstrator exposed her breasts to 
people near the church, as others blocked a nearby intersection by 
lying down in front of cars. The rioters also replaced the church's 
Christian flag with a rainbow banner (a symbol of homosexual rights), 
and pelted the church caretaker with eggs when he tried to stop them, 
Innes said. The crowd broke a door jamb with its pounding, and kicked 
at emergency exit doors. The pastor said elderly and physically 
disabled worshipers inside the church were especially scared, as were 
youngsters in the lobby who heard the chant, "We want your children. 
Give us your children." 
...The reason for the conflict: a presentation by Lou Sheldon of the 
Traditional Values Coalition, whose group has opposed homosexuality on 
moral grounds. After a delay, he finally spoke for about 25 minutes, 
telling the congregation about the work his organization is doing, and 
emphasizing "the spiritual nature of the battle," Innes told NIRR. The 
church did not publicize Sheldon's appearance, although regular 
attenders and members were notified of the evening schedule in the 
church bulletin. Two local newspapers, however, discovered Sheldon was 
to speak, and announced the event, one using what Innes called 
"intemperate, inflammatory language." In addition, some protesters 
distributed flyers, purportedly from the church, containing views it 
does not hold. 
...Police response was inadequate, Innes told NIRR, although they have 
been very cooperative since the event. At the time, however, he said 
officers often looked the other way while church property was being 
destroyed and parishioners traumatized. "Police are afraid of their 
careers if they take any aggressive action against this segment of the 
community," he told NIRR. Officers made no arrests. 
..."You don't start a battle you're not going to win," Lt. Anthony 
Novello of San Francisco's Northern (Police) Station told NIRR. But 
city police have allowed demonstrators less leeway since former Police 
Chief Frank Jordan became mayor, Novello said. "Once lawlessness 
started, we used to let it go a step further than it is now." The 
police officer said that, despite the pastor's view that the service 
was not an open meeting, critics may sometimes have the right to attend 
such services. Nevertheless, he quickly added that those who legally 
enter a church service have no right to remain if their conduct is 
disruptive. California penal code 602.11 prohibits people from 
obstructing those entering or leaving church services. 
...But "the real problem is down at city hall" where the Board of 
Supervisors is "working in tandem with the homosexual community," Innes 
told NIRR. He characterized some officials as vocally or openly hostile 
to conservative churches. A few members are neutral, and only Willie 
Kennedy "has been a real friend to us," Innes said. 
...Hamilton Square Baptist has been distributing copies of a tape made 
during part of the riot. The church also has been calling for support 
from other churches nationally in seeking the arrest and prosecution of 
the culprits. "It's a precedent issue. If they establish they can do 
this, there will be no end," Innes told NIRR. 

The pope has provoked a lawsuit in Colorado. Gov. Roy Romer, Denver 
Mayor Wellington Webb, and other state employees are defendants in a 
class action suit filed Oct. 21 by the local chapter of the Freedom 
From Religion Foundation. FFRF, based in Madison, Wis., claims that 
state authorities used taxpayer monies, municipal personnel, and public 
facilities for the pontiff's August visit to the Mile High City for 
World Youth Day (NIRR 8/23). An attorney for FFRF said John Paul II had 
promoted Roman Catholicism in Denver for a week, and should have held 
Mass in a church rather than a city park. City officials maintain the 
event helped the Denver economy, and that the decision to use city 
funds was "not guided by religion." FFRF is demanding the unspecified 
funds be returned to the public treasury to ensure separation of church 
and state under the U.S. Constitution. 

A Denver nurse has been warned against praying with patients. Serena 
Garreux, a psychiatric nurse at Denver General Hospital, was given a 
written reprimand by her supervisors for accompanying an unassigned 
patient to the chapel for prayer. When the patient asked Garreux to 
pray, she did so, and encouraged the patient to "place her problems in 
her hands and give them to God." According to DGH officials, the 
patient "reported feeling very uncomfortable and distressed by the 
interaction," and felt "powerless to say no or to leave." Officials 
warned Garreux that she "failed to assess what prayer meant to the 
patient, and did not have adequate knowledge of the patient's previous 
[spiritual] history." The nurse was instructed to make "immediate 
improvement in this area," or face other disciplinary action such as 
suspension or dismissal. Two weeks ago, Garreux filed a counter 
grievance with hospital officials; her appeal has been forwarded to a 
third committee for hearing. 

Scientologists are saying it is about time the IRS finally recognize 
their church as a religion. An Oct. 1 Internal Revenue Service 
announcement names the church as a charitable and religious 
organization, thus entitled to taxexempt status. More than 150 
church-related groups also will qualify. IRS spokesmen said the 
government recently was able to make the legal determination because 
for months the church had provided the necessary details on their 
operating purposes. The IRS for nearly 40 years had disputed that 
Scientology, founded by the late L. Ron Hubbard, is a faith. Critics 
say Scientology is a brainwashing, self-help-oriented scheme to 
generate money for its leaders. Hubbard's Dianetics: The Modern Science 
of Mental Health, which some consider a sort of Scientology scripture, 
has sold more than 11 million copies since publication. The Los 
Angeles-based group says it has more than 7 million followers, and 
operates exclusively for religious and charitable reasons. 

Teaching Science in a Climate of Controversy may cause a controversy in 
California, where more than 3,000 public high school biology teachers 
were sent a 1993 revision of the book. The paperback was prepared by 
the Ipswich, Mass.-based American Scientific Affiliation (ASA), an 
organization of 2,400 scientists who are also Christians (NIRR 8/23). 
The book, which includes exercises to help students separate evidence 
from inference, urges teachers to present evolution as science, not as 
disguised ideology. John Wiester of Buellton, who has taught origins at 
Westmont College and Biola University and who heads ASA's three-man 
Committee for Integrity in Science Education, told NIRR, "We are very 
disturbed about the Darwinist agenda masquerading as science in the 
classroom." He hopes the book will prevent controversies over the 
teaching of evolution, such as in Vista, California's school district 
(NIRR 8/23), which he sees as "fueled on one side by dogmatists who 
attack evolution because they believe it can't possibly be true, and on 
the other side by dogmatists who believe it simply has to be true." 
Evolution should be taught with all its open questions and unsolved 
problems, not as a boring "done deal," Wiester said. 

Now that doctors can "see" death take place in the brain, more 
physicians are pondering questions of life and death, says Kenneth 
Schemmer, M.D. A relatively new technology called positive emissions 
tomography shows activity, or a lack of it, in the cerebral cortex, the 
part of the brain that directs the body's actions and supports 
purposeful human life. Physicians question what occurs when a patient's 
body is sustained by a life-support system, but the "human person is 
gone," said Schemmer, head of the ethics committee at California's La 
Mirada Hospital. "Science describes what it sees," but scientists 
increasingly want deeper answers, he said. Many doctors he has met are 
open to biblical ideas, such as Paul's statement that absence from the 
body is presence with the Lord, he told NIRR at a New England meeting 
of the San Clemente, Calif.-based Hospital Christian Fellowship. 
...Euthanasia and related issues are forcing society to define when a 
person is alive, to say "this is a person, this is not," Schemmer told 
the group. "If the cerebral cortex is functioning, then they are a 
human being, and need to be treated with every right and privilege." 

A neurologist confirmed last month that Joseph Aldrich has Parkinson's 
disease. For a year the president of Multnomah Bible College and 
Biblical Seminary had been noticing some troubling, recurring health 
problems: shuffling walk, loss of balance, deteriorating handwriting, 
glazed eyes. He canceled immediate travel plans, asking to be excused 
from several speaking commitments. "Although adjustments must be made, 
I anticipate, Lord willing, continuing in ministry at Multnomah," 
Aldrich, 52, told faculty, staff, and students at the Portland, Ore., 
schools. 
..."I don't know what all this means, but I am resting in Him," said 
Aldrich, an evangelism author and leader of the Northwest prayer 
movement. "I'm convinced His purpose is good, and that it will bring 
glory to Him." 

Youth With A Mission International Executive Director Floyd McClung is 
resigning from his position after seven years. McClung, who is expected 
to leave by the end of 1993, is considering whether to establish YWAM's 
Mission Village, a combination retirement/conference center and 
leadership development program, in Colorado. 
...McClung's resignation has encouraged some operational reordering. 
Loren Cunningham, YWAM founder and president, has written an open 
letter to the 7,000 YWAMers in 120 countries requesting prayer and 
input on how to improve internal operations. The 33-year-old mission 
organization has drawn both criticism and praise for its autonomous 
structure worldwide and lack of formal headquarters. 
..."We're not falling apart. It's not a crisis," Paul Filidis, YWAM's 
director of research and information, told NIRR. He said the size of 
the mission prompted some to call for more standardized coordination so 
all YWAMers could be heard. Filidis said that, although opinions vary 
over reorganization, many had called for more accountability, and 
definition and enforcement of the organization's mission. 

Addition of the Billy Graham School of Missions, Evangelism, and Church 
Growth will be a "quantum leap" for Southern Baptist Theological 
Seminary, as well as the denomination, said the seminary's newly 
inaugurated president, R. Albert Mohler, Jr. He heralded the trustees' 
launching of a fifth graduate college at the Louisville, Ky., graduate 
school Oct. 14 to a gathering of about 9,000. Officially welcomed by 
Gov. Brereton Jones, Graham himself affirmed the need for a renewed 
commitment to train ministers of evangelism. Graham said America's 
greatest need is "a spiritual awakening" to restore morality and 
integrity. The college is the first Graham has allowed to bear his 
name, although the seminary has an endowed chair of evangelism named in 
his honor. 

Yale University, an academic environment often hostile to Christianity, 
is quietly coming alive with the gospel. "God is doing some marvelous 
things," said Hugh Hedges of International Students USA. For example, 
D. James Kennedy, pastor of Fort Lauderdale's Coral Ridge Presbyterian 
Church, spoke Oct. 7 to the largest gathering of Christians at Yale in 
many years. Some 1,500 students and members of the New Haven, Conn., 
community heard his message, "Absolutes in a Relativistic Age," which 
was "just what Yale needed," Hedges told NIRR. "Life cannot be lived 
without meaning and hope," Kennedy told the audience. Atheistic 
theories of the origins and nature of the universe are "the reason so 
many college students commit suicide today -- because life has been 
robbed of all of its meaning and significance." Christian Broadcasting 
Network founder Pat Robertson also spoke Oct. 8 at a Yale forum on law 
and religion, presenting statistics on how a society's religious values 
tend to diminish crime. 
...Many of the 50 area pastors who attended Kennedy's speech will plan 
Evangelism Explosion training programs at a meeting at Yale Divinity 
School Nov. 11. "People were excited but surprised to find that a lot 
of evangelical pastors have been praying regularly for Yale," said 
Siafa Johnson, a leader of the student group. 
...Many opportunities to win students to Christ are wasted, Johnson 
told NIRR. "Most Americans don't know how these young students are 
searching for the meaning of life. It breaks my heart that more 
churches seem not to be aware," said Johnson, who also leads a 
fledgling international student group at Columbia University in New 
York. 
...The movement at Yale is individual, not institutional. "God will 
work at Yale. But Yale as an institution can never go back to its 
religious roots," because the school is too diverse, Johnson said. 
Nevertheless, Yale has an evangelical chaplain, Jerry Streets, and 
evangelical services are being held at Dwight Memorial Chapel. "God is 
being lifted up, right in the center of Yale," Hedges told NIRR. 

Bob Holmes -- The One-Man Volleyball Team -- has offers to speak in 
public schools coming out of his ears. He told NIRR they are open to 
his ministry since he provides an exciting exhibition for students. 
Holmes singlehandedly plays teams of six: selected faculty, girls' team 
members, and "the most athletic guys" in the student body, then 
delivers a message on abstinence from drugs, alcohol, and premarital 
sex. Holmes invites students back for an evening meeting in which he 
shares his faith in Christ. Often, troubled teens seek his advice after 
hearing his message. Although Holmes speaks in schools, he ministers to 
all ages. 
...Holmes never played volleyball in high school or college. An 
evangelist since 1978, he began to play one-onone in his back yard for 
exercise. Soon he was playing six-on-one and winning. Realizing his 
talent could draw crowds, he decided to play volleyball as an opener 
for his message. Since 1986, he has played more than 5,000 games, 
sometimes as many as 26 a day. He has lost only about 110. Holmes 
credits his endurance and talent to God, believing that if he were to 
strive for trophies instead of sharing Christ he would lose his 
ability. 
...Holmes wishes more churches would cooperate to use him as a vehicle 
for community evangelism. Too often, he says, they don't. For example, 
when he was asked to speak in every high school in one county, an 
excited pastor sent 75 letters to churches seeking help for a crusade. 
Only one church responded. If churches would unite to sponsor a crusade 
in a neutral environment, such as a local stadium, he could reach more 
people for Christ, Holmes told NIRR. Most people come to his 
exhibitions because friends invite them, not because they saw an ad, he 
said. 

As Joe Carter's ninth-inning homer flew over the left field fence, many 
of the Toronto Blue Jays thanked God for their second consecutive Major 
League baseball championship. But both Toronto and the Philadelphia 
Phillies had a spiritual component that was overlooked in most World 
Series coverage. 
...In Toronto, veteran chaplain David Fisher said the Blue Jays' 
Christian commitment was the strongest in the team's 17 years of 
existence. Chapel attendance averaged 12 to 14, and seven to nine 
players (plus radio announcer Terry Howarth) came to Wednesday 
afternoon Bible studies. Nearly half the players -- 23 of 50 -- 
attended Toronto's Sunday chapel services during the Series' opening 
weekend. Yet media coverage of the players' faith seemed to dwindle: "I 
don't know if the players weren't as vocal as in the past, or if the 
media didn't report it," Fisher said. "In articles about [designated 
hitter Paul] Molitor, or [outfielder Joe] Carter, or some of the 
stronger Christians, their faith was rarely mentioned." He said that in 
previous years sportswriters noted the religious beliefs of well-known 
Christian players, but often in a negative light. "I'm wondering if 
it's not better the way it is now." 
...Fisher said awareness of these nine Toronto believers is growing. 
The leader of Epistle Sports Ministries said he received more requests 
for speaking engagements for players such as Molitor than ESM could 
handle. Fisher said he frequently spoke about the spiritual influence 
on the team. A major boost came from a newspaper article about first 
baseman John Olerud and his wife, Kelly, in which she talked of their 
Christian commitment. 
...Although some of the Philadelphia Phillies perpetuated their media 
image as hard-charging "bad boys," both on and off the field, the team 
experienced a resurgence in chapel and Friday afternoon Bible studies. 
"Last year if there were three or four guys at chapel, it was like a 
revival," said John Hibbard, the minister who has led team Bible 
studies for a decade. "This year it ran seven to 10 consistently, 
depending on who was pitching and taking batting practice in that 
hour," he told NIRR. Of first baseman John Kruk's comment during spring 
training -- "The chapel leader is afraid to come into the clubhouse" -- 
both Hibbard and his son Jack, who coordinates the program, laugh. They 
say the statement, circulated on national media, was obviously 
tongue-in cheek and "ridiculous," since they visited the clubhouse 
throughout the season. 
..."It seems like the Lord's been bringing guys on the team who know 
Him," added Jack Hibbard. He noted the July acquisition of pitcher 
Roger Mason as a key in strengthening chapel and Bible study. 
Outfielder Milt Thompson, an active church member in St. Louis in the 
off season, coordinated the players' chapel involvement. It was an 
excellent year, Hibbard told NIRR, with two players coming to salvation 
and two rededicating their lives to Christ; but he cautions that this 
is no revival. "Frankly, going to chapel is not a popular thing to do 
here. But I'd rather have two or three guys who are growing and are 
interested in reaching the rest of the team than 20 guys who just came 
because they felt it was the right thing to do." 
..."Any report on the Blue Jays would be incomplete if the wives' 
chapels and Bible studies weren't mentioned," said Fisher, whose wife, 
Carol, scheduled weekly guest speakers for the women's chapels. Maureen 
Patrick, a pastor's wife, drove the 80 miles to Toronto every Wednesday 
night to review biblical principles of marriage for the Bible study. 
"They wanted [the Bible study] at game time, so they started at 7:30, 
and often were still going at 10:00," Fisher said. Wives had the 
freedom to leave at any time to watch the game. "But there was such an 
interest they would just stick around." 
...The Phillies wives' Bible study also provided spiritual strength. 
John Hibbard's wife, Carolyn, spurred her family's involvement with the 
Phillies in the early 1980s. Former Philadelphia 76ers General Manager 
(and then Phillies' chapel leader) Pat Williams asked her to lead a 
Bible study for the wives. John later followed with the men. "Looking 
to next year, I think the women are more enthusiastic than the men 
about what could take place," he said. 
...The chaplains credit Baseball Chapel with strengthening the 
Christian influence in the major leagues. Founded in 1973 by 
now-retired Detroit News sportswriter Watson Spoelstra, the program 
provides Sunday services around the league for players who cannot 
otherwise attend church. John Hibbard said the solid Christians will 
meet together anyway, but the chapel gives support to the "guys on the 
fringe," who need it. "If they're laughed at, at least they've got 
eight or nine other guys around to back them up," Hibbard told NIRR. 
Fisher said Baseball Chapel has been a vital constant to the teams. 
"The players know on Sunday there will be a service where they can hear 
the Word of God, and be away from everything else that's happening. And 
fellowship with their Christian teammates -it's vital to personal 
growth on all the teams." 

"Whenever there were, like, two outs or two strikes or something, I'd 
ask God for help -- and it worked," Long Beach (Calif.) Little League 
All-Stars shortstop and pitcher Sean Burroughs told NIRR. The All-Stars 
recently became the first U.S. team to win the world title two years in 
a row. Through the Western regionals and the World Series, Burroughs 
pitched 20 consecutive innings without allowing a hit. During the 
Series, the 13-year-old struck out 32 batters and got nine hits, 
including two home runs. Burroughs told his mother that when his team 
needs to rally, "I've been asking God to give me something to hit. He 
hasn't let me down yet." been asking God to give me something to hit. 
He hasn't let me down yet."

Vol. 7, No. 22                                                      
October 18, 1993 

Talk more, shout less was President Bill Clinton's suggestion to the 
religious right. Religious conservatives "seem to believe that their 
number one obligation is to make whatever they think is wrong illegal," 
and ignore the "affirmative duties" people have to one another, he said 
in a speech to fellow graduates of the Yale Law School's Class of 1973. 
The president said he accepted differences of opinion over moral issues 
as an American tradition. Clinton said his plea was not an attack on 
those "motivated by their own version of what they think God wants them 
to do," but a call for those polarized by the abortion issue to build 
on shared values with dialogue and compromise. 

The religious right is "one of the most maligned groups in the 
country," Rush Limbaugh said in an interview in the November/December 
issue of The Door. According to EP News Service, the radio-TV pundit 
described Christian conservatives as "decent" people who resist "the 
notion that religion is a disqualifier for serving in government." He 
said, however, some Christians send him "vicious hate mail" for not 
using his programs "to promote whatever they think the Christian agenda 
is." In his first interview with a Christian periodical, Limbaugh said 
he was raised a Methodist, and was influenced by a "deeply religious" 
father who believed neither in hell nor the Book of Revelation. 
Although he is seen as the defender of the rich, he downplayed the role 
of wealth in bringing happiness. "Jesus holds the answers to all the 
everyday problems that you face." 

California is cultivating conservatism -- 21% of adults consider 
themselves members of the religious right, and 32% call themselves 
"born again," reveals a new Field Institute poll. Although 54% of 
residents of the state, known for its liberal stereotype, say their 
religious beliefs do not influence their political views, more than one 
in five say their faith colors their opinions on policy and lifestyle 
choices. Most who identify themselves with the religious right also 
identify themselves as Republicans who voted for George Bush last year. 
More than 67% oppose acceptance of a homosexual lifestyle as normal, 
and conservative Californians believe by a two-to-one margin that gays 
and lesbians should not serve in the military. Although the school 
voucher initiative on the Nov. 2 ballot meets with no consensus among 
religious Californians, nearly 80% of the religious right (and a 
majority of religious moderates) support a constitutional amendment to 
permit prayer in public schools. 

Religious students tend to do better in school than those who are not, 
reveals a recent Gallup/CNN/USA Today poll of 803 teens. Gallup 
categorizes the most successful students, 27% of teens, as 
"All-American Achievers." They are most likely to say religion is "very 
important" to them, a statement affirmed by a majority of 13- to 
17-year-olds. The All-American Achievers think good grades are 
important, earn mostly A's, enjoy school, often participate in 
extracurricular activities, and plan to attend college. These most 
successful students demonstrate high self-esteem, and 73% of them live 
with both parents. 
..."The more religious parents are, the more likely they are to provide 
a family support system," Gallup Vice President David Moore said in 
explaining the link between religion and student achievement. These 
parents generally earn incomes well above average, serve as role models 
for their children, and regularly eat dinner as a family. 

Money's 1994 college guide excludes independent Christian schools. Best 
College Buys limits its picks to 1,003 colleges and universities "that 
welcome students without regard to religious backgrounds," the 
magazine's editors say. 
...If Christian schools don't deal with being omitted, "it could 
further marginalize Christian education," said David Winter, president 
of Westmont College in Santa Barbara, Calif. The non-denominational 
evangelical Christian school was not named on the listing, although 
Westmont generally has been included on similar lists of top liberal 
arts schools. Some academics believe that religious colleges contribute 
to national divisiveness, but Winter told NIRR they actually produce 
graduates with "greater understanding of religious differences, 
contributing to pluralism." 
..."Tell me that isn't Christophobia," Richard Gathro of the Christian 
College Coalition said of the Money magazine exclusion. "All we're 
asking here is a little pluralism. We're not asking the University of 
Maryland to be Christ-centered," Gathro told NIRR. Although most 
Americans "affirm individual pluralism," he said, "a lot of 
institutional elites cannot accept confessional pluralism -- that is, 
what we believe as a group." 

Cult deprogrammers be warned: "It is never OK to kidnap an adult or 
child," U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis said at Galen Kelly's sentencing 
to seven years and three months in prison. A Virginia jury found Kelly 
guilty of kidnapping Debra Dobkowski, a Washington, D.C., resident who 
was mistaken for her roommate. Kelly's intended target was a member of 
the Circle of Friends, a group alleged to be a cult. Kelly previously 
was tried for conspiracy to kidnap Lewis DuPont Smith to deprogram him 
from political allegiance to Lyndon LaRouche. Although Kelly has been 
linked informally to the Chicago-based Cult Awareness Network, CAN 
Executive Director Cynthia Kisser said, "Obviously we're opposed to" 
kidnapping. 

Two Bible scholars say David Koresh planned to surrender to federal 
authorities. Although an April 19 fire destroyed the Branch Davidian 
compound and much of the evidence on the group, cult member Ruth Riddle 
escaped to safety with a computer disk. Koresh's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, 
asked James Tabor of Charlotte, N.C., and Phillip Arnold of Houston to 
examine a 13-page manuscript saved on the disk. The researchers say the 
document is the beginning of the cult leader's interpretation of 
Revelation's Seven Seals, which prophesy the end of the world. Tabor 
and Arnold indicated that Koresh had dictated only on the first seal, 
but had worked on his explanation consistently until the night before 
the fire. Five days before the blaze, Koresh told FBI authorities he 
would surrender and lead his followers out as soon as his 
interpretation was done. News reports indicated federal officials 
doubted Koresh's word. 

Exorcism is not a legitimate psychological treatment. An Arizona board 
revoked the license of Kenneth Olson, a psychologist and Lutheran 
minister who said he cast demons from a 10-year-old last year. Foster 
parents referred the boy, a victim of physical and sexual abuse, to 
Olson because repeated hospital treatments had not stopped his violent 
behavior. Olson said he laid hands on the child and prayed for him. 
News reports said the minister had a Bible, holy water, and a crucifix 
nearby. The exorcism was discovered when Olson billed the state $180 
for a two-hour session. The Board of Psychologist Examiners, which 
earlier had placed Olson on probation for a 1988 exorcism, described 
the action as "an experimental technique," and "ritual on someone who 
had already been ritually abused." But "no one seems to care that the 
boy seems to be cured," said Olson, who claimed he would perform other 
necessary exorcisms. The foster mother says the boy's condition is 
improved markedly. 

Federal courts earned a B+, B-, two C's, and a C- on their second 
annual Report Card on Religious Freedom, released by the American 
Jewish Congress and the David Kahn Religious Liberty Resource Center. 
The survey of 21 constitutional professors scored federal judges better 
than last year. But, said project director Sylvia Neil of the AJC, some 
religious liberties remain in jeopardy. 
...The Supreme Court's decision to allow Santerians free practice of 
religion earned the highest grade, in the category of "freedom from 
explicit government discrimination against individuals due to their 
religious belief." The scholars assigned the lowest grade on "freedom 
from indirect government burdens or restriction on religious 
practices." The First Amendment experts blamed fallout from the Smith 
"peyote" case (NIRR 4/23/90), which could be reversed if Congress 
passes the Religious Freedom Restoration Act or Native American Free 
Exercise of Religion Act later this month. The B- was awarded for 
"freedom from government inculcation of religion in public schools," 
and the C's for "freedom from government promotion of religion" and 
"freedom from government financial entanglements with religious 
institutions." 

The city of Baltimore has no right to decide what is and is not kosher, 
U.S. District Judge Benson Legg ruled earlier this month. Although the 
city's Bureau of Kosher Meat and Food Control may enforce kosher 
standards, Legg said the commission's staff of rabbinical inspectors 
"excessively entangles civil and religious authority." He acknowledged 
the city's ordinances had a "commendable" purpose in seeking to protect 
consumers from fraud, but agreed, in effect, with a similar 1992 New 
Jersey Supreme Court decision that said secular bodies have no business 
making spiritual determinations. The Washington Post indicated the 
ruling could affect how food inspectors enforce Jewish dietary laws in 
at least 20 states. Baltimore officials say they feel certain their 
kosher food laws are constitutional, and will appeal the case. 

Martin Luther wouldn't recant, but the ELCA is turning its back on some 
of his comments about Jews. Ecumenical officers of the Evangelical 
Lutheran Church in America are preparing a statement that will 
repudiate the reformer's views. Delegates to the recent Churchwide 
Assembly in Kansas City voted to issue a resolution distancing the 
denomination from Luther's references to Jews as "alien murderers and 
bloodthirsty enemies" who "practice all sorts of vices." In a 1543 
tract, On Jews and Their Lies, Luther suggested that Christians burn 
synagogues and confiscate Jewish homes, property, and money. Some 
scholars claim that these views, as well as Luther's position on 
church-state relations, encouraged the German people to accept Nazism. 
The ELCA pledged to "live out our faith in Jesus Christ in love and 
respect for the Jewish people" by opposing "anti-Semitism in church and 
society." 

Jews are among the United States' most "unchurched" people, reports a 
new study called Synagogue Affiliation: Implications for the 1990s. 
Researched by Brandeis University's Cohen Center for Modern Jewish 
Studies, the survey of 2,500 Jewish households found that only 25% of 
American Jews attend services at least once a month. (About 40% of 
Christians make the same claim.) Only 39% of Jews are synagogue 
members, which the report says may be inflated since many of these may 
not pay dues. Approximately 33% attend on High Holy Days or other 
religious observances, and 23% go for rites of passage (weddings, 
memorial services, etc.), Religious News Service reported. 
...Most likely to attend synagogue are adults under 25 and over 75 
years old (45%), families with children ages 10-17 (73%), Jews with 
graduate degrees (45%), and those with household incomes over $80,000 
(49%). Orthodox Jews (65%) more often belong to a synagogue than do 
Conservative Jews (52%) and Reform Jews (40%). 

When John Paul II released his encyclical The Splendor of Truth, both 
he and the church had the esteem of American Catholics. Gallup reports 
nearly 75% approve of how the pope leads the church, and a majority 
consider themselves strong in their faith. More than 80% are satisfied 
with the social services Catholics provide to the poor. 
...Personal conscience rather than papal pronouncement guides the 
morality of 73% of American Catholics. While 60% of those over age 50 
believe sex outside of marriage is always wrong, only 30% of those 
under 50 believe so. More than 75% of American Catholics believe in 
divorce and remarriage within the Catholic Church, and 61% say those 
who remarry without annulment still can be good Catholics. The study 
says 84% believe in the use of artificial birth control, and 82% 
disagree with leadership's prohibition of condom use to prevent the 
spread of AIDS. Nearly 60% believe the church should ease its absolute 
rejection of abortion. On the practice of homosexuality, 35% said it 
does not prevent a person from being a good Catholic. 
...American Catholics' attitudes about the priesthood are changing. 
Approval for allowing priests to marry has risen to 75%, from 49% in 
1971. Since 1974, those who favor women's ordination has increased from 
29% to 63%. In the last week, 49% of those interviewed had attended 
Mass, and in the last month, 14% had gone to confession. 

Although Catholic college students esteem the priesthood, they do not 
suggest it as a career choice, according to a national survey of 250 
Catholics at both religious and secular schools. Only 32% of those 
polled said they would encourage their sons into the vocation, and 68% 
would not or were not sure whether they would. Still, 99% of those 
polled affirmed the importance of the priesthood, "a wonderful 
statistic for priests to know," researcher Terrance Berntson, a 
Minnesota parish pastor and former seminary professor, told the 
National Catholic Reporter. Primarily, priests should be spiritual 
leaders (84%), counselors (8%), or social reformers (4%), respondents 
said. 
...Why so few priests? Students attributed mandatory celibacy (94%), 
the lack of a family setting (89%), and expectations of high moral and 
spiritual development (73%) as the most significant causes for the 
shortage. Among the causes rarely chosen to explain the lack of priests 
were low income, clerical garb, parish housing, long hours, the 
authoritarian nature of work, the amount of confidentiality necessary, 
and fear of being suspected as a child molester. 
...The shortage of priests could be solved by selection of female 
deacons and allowing laypersons to share some priestly 
responsibilities, students said. The next most popular solutions were 
allowing priests to marry, or the ordination of women. Berntson and his 
research colleague, sociologist Diane Pike of Augsburg College, 
reported few differences between men and women, or students at secular 
and Catholic institutions. 

Is the Diocese of Scranton, Pa., casting its pearls before swine by 
advertising for priests on MTV and VH-1? Catholic officials there 
defend their recruitment techniques, designed to counteract their 
falling number of priests, a 37% decline since 1966. A cable 
advertising agent suggested the 30-second ads. The diocese paid $450 to 
air 50 spots locally this month. The half that will run on MTV are 
geared to reach young people who might consider the priesthood. Those 
to be broadcast on VH-1 are aimed at career-changers weighing their 
vocational options. The ads feature priests talking about the lives 
they originally planned or gave up -- happily -- to heed the call. 

Landlords who view sex outside marriage as sinful may refuse to rent to 
unmarried couples. The California Supreme Court reversed itself Oct. 4, 
and decided not to review a Court of Appeals ruling in favor of a 
Catholic couple in Downey. In 1987, Agnes Donahue and her late husband, 
John, turned down the housing request of a woman and her boyfriend 
because of religious convictions. The Fair Employment and Housing 
Commission had ordered the landlords to pay the unmarried couple 
damages, but the owners appealed on the grounds that their religious 
views were protected by the First Amendment. Thomas Donahue, who 
represented his parents in the suit, told NIRR that his mother was 
"delighted, of course," by the court's action. 

Since running its full-page ad, "In Defense of a Little Virginity," in 
USA Today in April 1992, Focus on the Family has been "bombarded" with 
requests to run it in city newspapers, media president Paul Hetrick 
told NIRR. It has appeared in 1,100 U.S. newspapers, and soon will have 
run in 237 Canadian cities, seven foreign countries, and 31 school 
newspapers. The ad presents abstinence from a scientific and medical 
perspective, not a moral one, Hetrick said. The financial response has 
enabled the organization to produce and distribute more than 30,000 
copies of the abstinence video Sex, Lies, and the Truth. Both the ad 
and the video are "flying in the face of everything else kids are 
hearing these days," Hetrick said. 

Fundamentalist Christian Jane Halliday joined NBC's LA Law firm, 
McKenzie-Brackman, as a series regular on the Oct. 7 season opener. 
Halliday, played by Alexandra Powers, graduated from Bob Jones 
University and Harvard Law School, and worked for a public defender in 
Texas before moving to Los Angeles. Executive Producer William 
Finkelstein told NIRR he introduced a fundamentalist to provide 
interesting dynamics with the other characters, most of whom are 
liberal or not religious, and because Christians with any depth are 
rarely portrayed in TV plots. Maureen Milligan, Finkelstein's 
assistant, told NIRR that Halliday is young, beautiful, and determined 
to remain a virgin until marriage. "We gave the character a religious 
background without making her out to be a joke or caricature," Milligan 
said. "There are a lot of stereotypes to break." 
...The American Family Association's Donald Wildmon said Halliday 
should have warmth, moral integrity, and the ability to stand for her 
beliefs "in a rational and reasonable way." He said AFA would publicly 
applaud such a positive step, but he doubts the entertainment elite 
know enough about religion to depict it accurately. Focus on the Family 
spokesman Bob DeMoss told the Los Angeles Times he hoped the writers 
would consult mainstream Christians in developing Halliday's character. 
Finkelstein said he and his staff are consulting the Bible. 

Soon-to-be released: a video docudrama about Charles Watson, the 
follower Charles Manson called "Tex." Biola University professors Tom 
Nash and Michael Gonzales said they "both kind of gulped -- hard" at 
the proposal that their film-making class take on the project, which 
Jeremiah Films will distribute. "We didn't want to glamorize crime," 
Nash told NIRR. But they became convinced Watson's conversion is real, 
"not just a ploy to get out of prison." Watson is serving a life 
sentence in Mule Creek State Prison in Ione, Calif. 
...Incarcerated since his conviction for seven murders in 1969, Watson 
wrote about his conversion in Will You Die for Me? The woman who later 
became his wife came to Christ through reading his book. He and Kristin 
have three children, and run Abounding Love Ministries, which sends 
cassette tapes about Jesus Christ to prisoners. 
...The film, Forgiven: The Charles (Tex) Watson Story, is "about a good 
boy from a Christian home who slides into degrading sin," Nash told 
NIRR. "We can identify with him. If God can forgive him, He can forgive 
anybody," Nash said. Biola students play most of the parts; 
professionals play Watson and Suzan LaBerge, the daughter of Leo and 
Rosemary LaBianca, two of Watson's victims. Watson told NIRR that 
meeting LaBerge enabled him to understand the hurt he had caused many 
people. Receiving her forgiveness was healing to him, he said, but it 
has brought her criticism and alienation from her family. 
...Deputy District Attorney Stephen Kay, who helped prosecute Watson, 
opposes his parole, as did victim Sharon Tate's mother, until her 
death. "This religious thing, I don't believe it," Kay told the Los 
Angeles Times. He said Watson remains "a cold-blooded killer" and a 
"danger to society." But Nash told NIRR, "If Watson ever got paroled 
and moved in next door to me, I would have no problem with it." 

Retired Episcopal Bishop E. Otis Charles is gay, he announced last 
month in a letter to fellow bishops. Charles said he no longer could 
"remain silent, invisible, or unknown" about his sexual orientation, 
and that his life before his coming out had been "wrenching." He said 
he had prayed to be healed from "feelings I schooled myself to believe 
were unnatural," but in 1976 explained his struggles to his wife, from 
whom he is separated. He said his decision to reveal his sexual 
identity was personal, not driven by any misconduct. Until recently, 
Charles served as dean of the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, 
Mass., a post he assumed after leading the Utah diocese from 1971 to 
1986. Pastor Fred Phelps wants to continue picketing churches that are 
too soft on homosexuals, but a new Topeka ordinance will prevent him 
from protesting within 30 minutes before and after worship services. 
The legal measure, recently passed by the city council, also orders 
demonstrators to remain more than 100 feet away. Phelps and his 
followers from Westboro Baptist Church (NIRR 5/3) also frequently 
protest at the funerals of AIDS victims, who are "worthy of death," 
they say. Demonstrators often carry signs announcing their view that 
"God Hates Fags." 
...A violent protest led to the law, news sources reported. When a 
Phelps supporter tackled pastor Gerald Weeks outside his First Lutheran 
Church for his criticism of Phelps, about 5,000 Topeka church members 
from several denominations signed a petition demanding action. Phelps 
maintains the new ordinance violates his First Amendment free speech 
rights; opponents say Phelps' crusades amount to intimidation. Phelps 
says he will appeal to federal court. 

A statement that homosexuals pose no political threat since so many are 
dying of AIDS led Long Beach, Calif., councilman Douglas Drummond to 
vote for his own censure. Drummond had made the remarks, which he 
described as "insensitive and intemperate," in a September speech to 
members of the Eagle Forum of California. He also told the pro-family 
group that Cuba's quarantine on AIDS patients was admirable, and that 
allowing homosexuals to adopt children was "pitiful." More than 16 
civic groups called for Drummond's reprimand, news sources indicated. 
The city council voted unanimously that his comments had been "highly 
inflammatory and prejudicial." Drummond maintains he is not a 
prejudiced bigot, and says he does not plan to resign. 

Billy Graham says he "deeply regrets" saying he thought AIDS might be 
"a judgment of God." The evangelist told the Cleveland Plain-Dealer he 
was tired when he made the statement, but should have clarified his 
remarks to 44,300 people in his recent crusade in Columbus (NIRR 10/4). 
Graham had been preaching on how God hates sin, a belief he says he 
continues to hold, but "to say God has judged people with AIDS would be 
very wrong and very cruel." Graham called the newspaper to retract his 
statement after seeing letters that criticized his view. 

A Hindu doctor in Calcutta says the Bible can help stop AIDS (NIRR 
6/28). Adaniandra Nag of the Vivekananda International Health Centre, 
recently told an AIDS workshop of church volunteers and social workers 
that "if people followed the Bible, AIDS would not have spread so 
much." He noted that the World Health Organization follows a similar 
theme, and recommends having only one sexual partner. 
...A Christian approach to AIDS also impressed a Ugandan gynecologist. 
Pius Okong, an AIDS expert and member of Rome's International 
Charismatic Renewal Office, organized small renewal prayer groups from 
his hospital to take Christ into the homes of the HIV-infected. They 
bring food, clean, and pray for patients. The New Zealand-based World 
Digest of Christian Healing reports that before the program started, 
some people had been infecting others deliberately because they did not 
want to die alone. The government has backed Okong's program. 

God is working powerfully in the large cities of French-speaking 
Africa, according to Ray Bakke, executive director of the Chicago-based 
International Urban Associates. Bakke and IUA Senior Associate Steve 
Ujvarosy recently met in Bordeaux, France, with 65 African ministers 
from 18 cities. The agency and church pastors gave specific reports of 
the work God is doing in their cities. 
...For instance, in the midst of economic and social crisis in 
Kinshasa, Zaire, church planting has accelerated as never before; 
Cotonou, Benin, is undergoing a spiritual revival with conversions 
among the political elite; in Lome, Togo, pastors reported many 
miraculous deliverances amid the civil war; in Ouagadougou, Burkina 
Faso, there is "great joy over a new Christian radio station, and 
Christian prayer cells in some Islamic schools"; and in Libreville, 
Gabon, every district of the city is experiencing media evangelism and 
prayer cell groups. 
...By the end of the decade, Africa will have more than 95 cities with 
1 million or more inhabitants, Ujvarosy said. This urban expansion is 
fueled by "exploding birthrates and massive migration," Bakke said. 
Relatively few traditional missionaries have been trained in urban 
ministry, so few are positioned to meet the emerging pastoral needs. 
Churches, parachurch agencies, and Christian laity, too, are unprepared 
for the metropolitan growth, they said. 
..."Today, the church and people of Africa seem to be largely forgotten 
by Americans, who are bombarded with images of need and opportunity in 
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union," Ujvarosy said. IUA links 
groups that proclaim the gospel, plant and renew churches, and seek 
social transformation of African cities, "so that the glory of God may 
be visible," Bakke said. The network includes 139 urban leaders and 
ministry partnerships from 32 cities in eight countries, spokesperson 
Lisa Tomkins told NIRR. Next year IUA hopes to coordinate an evangelism 
strategy consultation on how to reach Africa's urban French-speakers. 

Remarried: Tammy Faye Bakker. On Oct. 3 in Rancho Mirage, Calif., she 
wed Roe Messner, the Kansas developer who built much of PTL's Heritage 
USA facilities at Fort Mill, S.C. Bakker reportedly sang Jesus Loves Me 
at the ceremony, and the couple honeymooned in Hawaii. Messner recently 
divorced his wife, Ruth Ann, and last year, Bakker divorced her husband 
of 30 years, Jim. The televangelist is serving an eight-year prison 
sentence for crimes related to the PTL ministry's finances. The 
Bakkers' daughter, Tammy Sue, who runs New Covenant Ministries, 
requested prayer for God's blessing on the marriage, and for God's 
perfect will in both her parents' lives. 

Christian Broadcasting Network founder Pat Robertson stepped down as 
president of the ministry on the 32nd anniversary of its first 
television broadcast. Citing competing demands on his time, Robertson, 
63, turned over the running of CBN's daily operations to Michael 
Little, 45, a 21-year CBN employee and group vice president for CBN 
International. The move affords Robertson more time to devote to his 
other organizations. He, however, will continue to host the network's 
flagship program, The 700 Club, as well as assist Little in directing 
the future of CBN, especially as its influence grows overseas. He also 
will remain chief executive official and chairman of the board. 
...The change is not related to politics or profit, CBN spokesman Gene 
Kapp told NIRR. Robertson is appealing a recent Federal Election 
Commission order to repay nearly $400,000 in expenses related to his 
unsuccessful 1988 bid for the Republican presidential nomination; and 
has met with criticism over money-making ventures using CBN funds (NIRR 
9/6). Leaving the CBN presidency "was strictly a decision borne of a 
very busy schedule," Kapp said. 

Amid investigations, lawsuits, and allegations of fraud, Robert Tilton 
announced he is going off the air. The Texas televangelist will stop 
broadcasting Success 'N Life and Sunday services from his Word of Faith 
World Outreach Center on Oct. 29. Tilton's attorney, J.C. Joyce, told 
reporters last month that the church's income had fallen from $7 
million a month to between $1-$2 million of late. Joyce said the 
scale-down will entail laying off 150 employees by Jan. 1, leaving 32 
at a ministry that once employed 800. Tilton largely blames an ABC 
PrimeTime Live program that suggested he was a spiritually insincere 
and shady fund-raiser. He has filed suit against the network. 
...Days after his announcement, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear 
a legal appeal from Tilton. The high court let stand a 5th U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals decision allowing Texas Attorney General Dan Morales 
to investigate Tilton for possible consumer fraud and violations of 
charity solicitation laws (NIRR 8/23). Tilton claimed the request for 
documents from his church violated his First Amendment religious 
liberties. 

Never before has the American public had such low regard for the 
honesty and ethical standards of clergy. According to a new Gallup 
poll, only 52% rate their confidence in ministers as very high or high 
(11% and 41%, respectively). Approximately 34% of Americans judged 
clergy to have average ethical and honesty standards; but 9% rated 
pastoral standards as low, and 2% deemed them very low. Gallup 
theorized that recent scandals and religious cult activity are 
partially responsible for the ratings dip, typical of a documented 
decline in confidence in religion. 
...Pharmacists were trusted most, as they were last year (NIRR 
11/30/92). Clergy ranked fourth, below college teachers and engineers. 
Until 1988 they had ranked first. Physicians and police officers also 
earned majority approval ratings. Among those least-trusted were 
lawyers, real estate agents, TV talk show hosts, labor union leaders, 
stockbrokers, insurance and auto salesmen, those who make TV 
commercials, and local, state, and national politicians. 

The Hyde Amendment held in the debate over Medicaid's abortion funding. 
In a compromise move, the House voted 311-115 to keep restrictions 
prohibiting federal funding of abortion for poor women unless their 
lives were endangered. But legislators widened the law to allow 
abortions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest. 
...Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders urged women to vote against 
legislators who try to remove abortion coverage from the Clinton health 
plan. She said she hoped members of Congress would not be "so 
narrow-minded" as to "deny a complete range of reproductive health 
services" to women. She said any prohibition against "an approved 
medical service is absolutely wrong," since abortion decisions should 
be left to the "discretion of a woman, her doctor, and her God." Elders 
also said the proposed "sin taxes" might discourage young people from 
smoking and drinking, "but I as surgeon general can't decide what 
should be taxed." 

Pro-lifers in more than 900 cities across the United States and Canada 
participated in the National Life Chain Oct. 3 (NIRR 10/19/92). 
Demonstrators peacefully lining major city streets held signs bearing 
messages such as "Abortion Kills Children," "Adoption: the Loving 
Option," and "Lord Forgive Us and Our Nation." Participants were asked 
to pray, and to be kind to abortion activists who attempted to disrupt 
the chain. 
...Prayer -- not attendance -- was the emphasis of this year's event. 
The group did not compile national statistics this year "because we've 
been too concerned with numbers, and have failed to trust sufficiently 
in the all-wise and all-powerful God we serve," said Royce Dunn, 
National Life Chain director. Although last year's Life Chain was the 
largest ever, with more than 1 million participants, it did not end 
abortion in America, Dunn told NIRR. America needs "God's merciful 
intervention," which can be accomplished only through serious prayer, 
he said. Organizers responded positively when Dunn redirected Life 
Chain back to its original mission of intercession, he said. Please Let 
Me Live, Life Chain's Yuba City, Calif., sponsor, said the Oct. 2, 1994 
event also will emphasize prayer. 
...Abortion terminates a pregnancy, but not motherhood, Dunn told NIRR, 
and "women intuitively know and endure this painful truth." He said 
pro-lifers best protect women's rights because they minister to all 
these needs. Still, "we must acknowledge our past failure to defend and 
aid the victims of abortion, both child and mother." 

When 20,000 squatters overran a Haitian government housing project and 
ran onto the grounds of his church, Rigaud Antoine was perturbed. But 
the Port-Au-Prince pastor took advantage of the situation to broadcast 
the gospel. He placed loudspeakers outside the church, Bethlehem 
Evangelical Baptist, expanding his congregation of 350 to include the 
thousands of squatters living in close quarters outside. "I reach every 
one," he told NIRR. 
...Sometimes 100 squatters a week come to Antoine after the services to 
tell him they listened to his preaching and accepted Jesus Christ. The 
next Sunday, the new believers "bring their own chairs and umbrellas 
and listen outside" the packed church, he told NIRR. 
...Antoine feeds 900 squatter children a day at his school, and has 
been asked to feed 300 more. It is often their only meal of the day, 
since many of their parents lost jobs when factories left the country 
in Haiti's political upheaval. "They call me pastor and bring their 
children to me," Antoine told NIRR. "I don't know how I'm going to have 
room for them. . . . When the squatters moved to my land, I was very 
upset. But when they started to come to the Lord, I realized this was a 
special ministry." 

It is time to be a missions force, not a mission field, Hispanic 
evangelicals will tell their churches. The Hispanic Missionary Congress 
of North America, known by the Spanish acronym COMHINA, drew 1,100 
leaders to Orlando, Fla., Sept. 20-24 to learn from speakers such as 
Jesse Miranda, Alberto Mottesi, Rudy Gir n, and William Taylor. 
...Urging a vision for Hispanic ministry in the Middle East, Africa, 
and Asia, the conference emphasized congregation-based rather than 
denomination-driven missions. COMHINA President Jos  Cintr n told NIRR 
that organizers had learned from the mistakes of COMHINA's predecessor, 
a 1987 Brazilian conference for all Latin Americans. Unlike the Sao 
Paulo event, seen as the epicenter of the growing missions movement, 
COMHINA was planned from the beginning to focus on follow-up. 
Participants committed to further networking, promotion, and prayer. 
After four days of plenary sessions and workshops on world missions, 
400 pastors pledged to move their flocks toward becoming 
missionary-sending congregations, a rarity among Hispanic churches. 
...Any conference where 1,100 people agree it is time to do missions is 
a great success, Cintr n told NIRR. After daily practice of a model for 
missions prayer, all participants promised to try to organize 12-person 
intercessory groups in their home churches. The congress drew leaders 
from 20 countries and 24 states, but half came from Florida alone. Gir 
n told NIRR that organizers felt God's leading to schedule similar 
conferences in other localities with large Hispanic populations, 
especially in California, Texas, New York, Chicago, and Toronto. 
Already planned is a 1997 repeat of the Sao Paulo conference that will 
unite Latin American evangelicals from Alaska to Patagonia. 

CHIEF wants to send a sizable contingent of Native Americans to the 
Urbana missions conference this winter. The Phoenix-based Christian 
Hope Indian and Eskimo Fellowship promised to recruit 500 Native 
Americans to attend InterVarsity's triennial convention. Only about 1% 
of Native Americans are born-again Christians, and their average church 
has 20-40 in weekly attendance. CHIEF's discipleship coordinator, Huron 
Claus, told NIRR that for real growth to occur in these churches, 
"we've got to see and participate in what God is doing in the world." 
...The fellowship sent Native American, short-term missionaries to 
Mongolia this summer. They intended to visit the tepee-dwelling 
"reindeer people," a nomadic group resembling the North American Plains 
Indians, said Claus, a descendant of Kiowa and Mohawk tribes. He said 
heavy rains in the remote Asian country prevented them from traveling 
north so that God could use them to address problems in the capital. He 
told NIRR the fledgling church in Ulan Bator had split because 
Mongolian Christians divided their loyalties among different 
denominations, agencies and programs. Drawing from similar experiences 
of Native Americans, CHIEF members counseled the missionaries and 
Mongolian Christians about working together toward the higher purposes 
of God. 
...Mongolia's Ministry of Education has approved a mission-supported 
proposal to establish kindergartens. Missionaries in the program hope 
to teach Mongolians self-reliance in a post-Communist era, said the 
proposal's sponsor, Rick Leatherwood of Newark, Ohio-based Mongolian 
Enterprises International. The missionary community is joining with 
communities of rural tent dwellers to undertake the pilot program, 
which they aim to make selfsupporting and a model program for all 
Mongolia. 

As India suffered its worst earthquake since 1935, U.S.-based Christian 
groups mobilized to aid the victims. Church World Services, the relief 
arm of the National Council of Churches, sent massive aid through its 
partner group in India, Church's Auxiliary for Social Action. CASA's 
initial assistance consisted of medical goods and services, a feeding 
program, 10,000 tarpaulins for shelter, thousands of utensil kits, and 
thousands more blankets. The NCC's appeal for more financial aid drew 
an immediate contribution from many member denominations. 
...Evangelicals, too, speedily sent assistance through several 
parachurch agencies.  World Relief, an arm of the National Association 
of Evangelicals, partnered with the Evangelical Fellowship of India's 
Commission of Relief to send tents, medicines, blankets, food, and safe 
drinking water. World Concern joined with InterMission Industrial 
Development Association in India to provide emergency medical care, 
temporary shelter, food, clothing, and water. WC reported the 
earthquake leveled 90% of the 25 villages around its base in the city 
of Puri. World Vision committed $250,000 to the emergency aid effort, 
and MAP (Medical Assistance Program) International focused on providing 
medical care and supplies. Numerous conservative denominations 
forwarded aid through their individual relief groups. 
...News from some earthquake-leveled parts of India is still sparse, 
says Anand Chaudhari, director of Ragistan Bible Institute and 
president of the Association of Evangelical Theological Education 
(AETE) in India. From the offices of Partners International in San 
Jose, Calif., he told NIRR many phone lines are still down, and 
confusion is rampant. The Indian government is not allowing relief 
agencies -- Christian or non-Christian, Indian or foreign -- into the 
area until the army has better control of the situation, he said. None 
of AETE's 83 seminaries, Christian schools, and Bible colleges are in 
damaged areas, and Partners International reports that all its workers 
in India are safe. 
...Operation Mobilization leaders in India said the army was 
coordinating medical clinics and setting up tents for the homeless. 
While there was no shortage of food, clothing, or blankets, there was a 
great need for shelter, they said. The mostly Hindu region is 
traditionally hostile to the gospel, but OM notes a great need for 
victim counseling. Many, especially the old, reportedly feel guilty for 
surviving because numerous younger ones died. Once government officials 
allow relief groups to enter the area, OM says it intends to show the 
love of Christ by comforting the grieving, and helping the illiterate 
fill out forms for government aid. 

The new Evangelical Environmental Network is joining other green 
religious groups to preserve the planet. Leaders from the National 
Association of Evangelicals, the Christian Life Commission of the 
Southern Baptist Convention, World Vision USA, and other key Christian 
agencies and schools announced the launching of the EEN at an Oct. 4 
White House meeting with Vice President Al Gore and key scientific and 
religious environmentalists. After a local church worship service, EEN 
President Ron Sider of Evangelicals for Social Action, and other 
delegates explained how the group would nurture awareness and action 
among evangelicals on environmental issues. 
...Among EEN's plans are an Oct. 28-29 Christianity Today institute 
that will culminate in theologians and activists drafting an 
Evangelical Environmental Declaration, an outline of a biblical 
framework for action. Sider said the group is seeking endorsements for 
the EED from evangelical denominations, renewal movements, parachurch 
bodies, colleges, seminaries, and prominent congregations. World Vision 
will spearhead efforts among evangelical relief and development 
agencies, and members will recruit "covenant congregations" committed 
to stewardship. In addition to a regular newsletter, various leadership 
training seminars and workshops will prepare clergy and Christian 
educators to lead study and implementation plans. Sider said local 
congregations can "combine prayer and action, worship and analysis, 
deep personal love for the Creator, and for the Creator's garden." 
...EEN is partnered with the National Religious Partnership for the 
Environment (NIRR 1/25), a broad-based coalition of mostly Catholic, 
Jewish, and mainline Protestant church groups. Through connection with 
the NRPE, the EEN also will share a consultative relationship with the 
Union of Concerned Scientists, represented at the meeting by 
best-selling theorist Carl Sagan. The joint group, which claims to 
represent more than 100 million Americans, announced a three-year, $4.5 
million effort to place environmental justice issues before 53,000 U.S. 
congregations. Sagan said the religious-scientific partnership creates 
an "extremely powerful effort" to save the earth Sagan said the 
religious-scientific partnership creates an "extremely powerful effort" 
to save the earth.

Vol. 7, No. 21                                                       
October 4, 1993 

Thousands participated in and hundreds responded to Operation 
Mobilization's Love Europe outreach this summer. After a week of 
training in Offenburg, Germany, more than 2,500 OM-associated believers 
evangelized in the annual event, which reaches 25 countries in Europe, 
the former Soviet Union, the Middle East, and North Africa. OM Director 
George Verwer told NIRR the program had its difficulties as well as its 
blessings. With thousands of participants, some traveling as far as 
Kazakhstan, he said they are grateful no major catastrophes happened. 
Verwer said that the change in Albania is "so spectacular it's hard to 
grasp." He said OM is training Albanians for leadership, but they're 
all new believers. When Love Europe reports are compiled, organizers 
expect results similar to last year's 800 recorded decisions for 
Christ. 

The Protestant church in Albania is growing at an annual rate of 39%. 
According to the newly released edition of Patrick Johnstone's 
Operation World, affiliation with Orthodox Christianity and Catholicism 
also are increasing in the former Communist stronghold, at rates of 22% 
and 20%, respectively. Johnstone's prayer almanac for the nations says 
the fledgling evangelical movement, which comprises only 0.06% of the 
population, is seen by leaders of the Islamic, Orthodox, and Catholic 
establishments as competition. The evangelical church's growing pains 
include both infighting within the born-again camp and the need for 
native-trained leaders. 
...Growing interest in mission and prayer-related books reportedly 
inspired Zondervan Publishing to print 323,000 copies of Operation 
World -- its largest first press run ever. The prayer manual is an 
update of an earlier edition published by WEC International and STL 
Books. A new companion book for children, You Can Change the World, was 
authored by Johnstone's late wife, Jill. For each letter of the 
alphabet, the youth guide contains an illustrated entry for both a 
nation and a culture/people group. The primer on culture, missions, and 
comparative religion offers a weekly lesson, beginning with "Albania, 
the Land that Prayer Changed." 
...Hundreds of North American missions agencies are listed, ranked, and 
indexed in the new 1993-1995 edition of the Mission Handbook. The 
reference work, released by MARC, the World Vision-sponsored Missions 
Advanced Research and Communication Center, offers current data and 
perspectives on the state of world missions and key players among 
Protestants and Catholics with headquarters in North America. 

Between 20-25 million Christians worldwide will be "Praying Through the 
Window," says the campaign's chairman, Dick Eastman of Every Home for 
Christ. The October intercession effort, which will focus prayer on 
what missiologists call the 10/40 Window, will be one of the "most 
comprehensive prayer campaigns in history," he said. 
...The 10/40 Window extends from West Africa to East Asia, between 10  
and 40  north of the equator (NIRR 2/8). Home to more than 60 
countries, it holds two-thirds of the world's population. As the 
birthplace of all major religions, some 1 billion Hindus, 1.1 billion 
Muslims, and 600 million Buddhists live in this third of the Earth's 
total land mass, reports HCJB World Radio. Missions experts estimate 
that only 8% of Christian missionaries serve in Window countries, home 
to 97% of the world's least-evangelized people. "For centuries, these 
peoples have been cut off from the gospel by geographic, linguistic, 
cultural and spiritual barriers," according to the Caleb Project. 
...To break those barriers, at least 249 teams will travel on "prayer 
journeys" to every Window country, according to the Christian 
Information Network. Others will pray from their homes. Jane Hansen, 
president of Women's Aglow International and campaign co-chair, said 
almost 500,000 women in the group's 2,500 chapters in 105 nations will 
focus their prayer on the Window. The Esther Network targeted about as 
many 8- to 12-year-olds to pray as well. HCJB supporters will pray that 
10/40 inhabitants will "turn on their radios to the gospel programs 
being beamed into that area." One African minister with AD 2000 and 
Beyond wrote to 20,000 African ministers to encourage each to mobilize 
at least 100 intercessors; more than 5,000 pastors agreed to 
participate and recruit. Caleb Project's Greg Fritz reported that 
"African Christians are renting stadiums for prayer meetings, and 
Koreans are hosting 24- to 48-hour continuous prayer vigils for 
unreached peoples." The Sentinel Group's George Otis, Jr., said that 
some 3,000 Japanese intercessors hope to have prayed 180,000 hours 
before Oct. 1. The month will conclude in Japan, Brazil, and other 
countries with prayer rallies in some of their largest sports arenas. 
...A network of Christian organizations has developed systematic 31-day 
prayer calendars, literature, maps, workshops, and seminars for the 
more than 1,300 denominations and parachurch ministries participating 
worldwide. Together they will establish task forces, schedule 
prayer-fasting meetings, and encourage prayer volunteers to adopt a 
city, country, or people group as their 10/40 intercessory focus. 
..."Imagine the impact this massive prayer effort could have on all 
ministries and agencies with plans to penetrate the 10/40 Window in 
this final decade of the 20th century," said Luis Bush, international 
director of AD 2000 and Beyond. "It could be the turning point for the 
region of our globe that seems to have suffered more than any other 
since Christ gave His disciples a commission nearly 2,000 years ago to 
evangelize all the world."

"We are servants to whatever the international students need," Larry 
Mullins, pastor of International Christian Church, told NIRR. His 
50-member congregation in Mobile serves the University of South 
Alabama's 900 foreign students from 140 countries. Church members 
collect, clean, and loan 200 mattresses to students each year. They 
also repair and loan bicycles, find used cars, provide rides to the 
airport, or visit students in the hospital. Many students attend 
church-sponsored weekly fellowships and monthly luncheons at the 
school. "The world is coming to us in America. We stress going over 
there, but our best bet is to win them here and send them back home," 
he said. 
...Of the 100 students won to Christ in the last five years, many have 
been "closet converts" from 10/40 Window countries, Mullins said. "If 
they get converted here, they are in major trouble." Students, 
especially from China or Muslim countries, told the pastor that they 
must beware of "plants" on campus who spy on their activities. 
..."One morning the Chinese communist agent showed up at church. Of 
nine Chinese students in church that day, only three came back. You are 
fighting a real war," Mullins said. "There was a master's-level 
biologist who got baptized, and within two weeks her parents were here 
telling her she had to denounce Christ. It is a difficult thing for a 
lot of Americans to believe." 
...Church members and medical students also staff two free clinics in a 
poor farming community nearby. At the church, "everybody gets involved 
or they leave," Mullins said. "It is so different from what we call 
church in America. Most have fairly radical ideas of what it takes to 
lay your life down and preach the gospel." 

"Youth ministry is tougher than ever. So is being a kid," says Young 
Life's new president, Denny Rydberg. He told NIRR that kids still have 
the same pressing needs they have had for years: a sense of identity, 
security, safety, meaning, and purpose. "But there are so many more 
demands and pressure on kids today than even 10 years ago." 
..."Youth ministers today have to be more sophisticated. Building a 
trust level takes longer because kids have been beaten up," Rydberg 
said. "That's why the 22,000 youth who come to YL's summer camps 
experience adventure and enthusiasm with a Christian message." He said 
YL, as it has for 52 years, will continue to help young people 
"discover who Jesus Christ is. That hasn't changed." 
...Rydberg is, however, a change for Young Life. The first president 
from outside the organization, Rydberg is a longtime college and youth 
minister, author of 10 books, and former editor of The (Wittenburg) 
Door. In his new role, he will lead more than 1,300 staffers, 8,500 
volunteers, 7,100 committee members, and some 100,000 high school and 
junior high youth who attend YL activities worldwide. "I hope to 
enhance what YL is already doing." 
...Rydberg has set four priorities for YL: (1) creating a healthy, 
growing ministry; (2) creating more camp facilities; (3) emphasizing 
more work with urban youth, and recruiting more minority staff members; 
and (4) building the international program to involve youth in missions 
and overseas partnerships. "My goal is to have healthy people on 
healthy teams doing healthy ministry. I want to take care of our staff 
as well as the kids we serve," he told NIRR. 

More and more public school students are leaving their campuses to 
receive religious instruction, according to the National Association 
for Released Time Christian Education (NIRR 4/19). At a summer NARTCE 
conference in Milwaukee, 50 Midwestern educators, church volunteers, 
and parents gathered to exchange ideas and information about their 
programs. NARTCE Director Roger Blankenship and Rutherford Institute 
attorney Tom McClure explained how public school students could be 
released to attend Bible studies, off-campus religious instruction, or 
church-sponsored activities during school hours. Plenary sessions and 
workshops dealt with starting a program, discipline and discipling 
youth, public relations, and how to select speakers and topics. 
..."The phone is ringing off the hook here," said National Program 
Director Dianne Schoggins. She said many of their inquiries come from 
people concerned about their children, and looking for educational 
direction. "People want [youth] to have a better foundation, the kind 
they aren't getting in the public schools." Schoggins told NIRR that 
part of the interest is because of a recently published book by Focus 
on the Family author Sherrie Fuller. In Helping Your Children Succeed 
in Public Schools, Fuller mentions the positive impact of participation 
in programs by NARTCE, which has a national membership of 2,000. 
...Ellijay, Ga., where NARTCE headquarters is located, has the largest 
release-time program. Last year, 90% of the local graduating class 
participated in the program, and 160 students regularly participate. "I 
believe our ministry is the biggest need in religion today," Schoggins 
told NIRR. "If we equip our youth -- tomorrow's leaders -we'll all be 
better off." For more information, call (404) 635-7100. 

"Organized campaigns by a handful of religious right groups" yielded a 
record number of attempts to ban schoolbooks and materials, according 
to People for the American Way's Attacks on the Freedom to Learn 
1992-1993 Report. It named Citizens for Excellence in Education, Focus 
on the Family, and Eagle Forum as the most active groups representing 
"the single largest anti-public education force in the nation." Most 
complaints involved materials "perceived to be at odds with religion," 
then materials which treated sexuality offensively, and third, 
materials deemed profane. In the last decade, the five most frequently 
challenged materials were the Impressions reading series, three 
self-esteem programs (Pumsy in Pursuit of Excellence, Quest, and 
Developing Understanding of Self and Others), and the Michigan Model 
for Comprehensive School Health Education. Each was the subject of 
"considerable direct-mail and newsletter campaigns" by the religious 
right, the report said. 
...The 41% success rate of these challenges was "disturbingly high," 
the PAW report said, and constitutes censorship. But Janet Parshall, 
special assistant to the president of Washington, D.C..-based Concerned 
Women for America, rejected the criticism. "That 41% is not an increase 
in censorship," she said. "We should be cheering it as greater parental 
involvement in the schools." 

San Francisco was the rallying place for "Church, State, and the 
Religious Right," the 46th national conference of Americans United for 
Separation of Church and State. The Silver Spring, Md., religious 
liberties watchdog group coordinated the Sept. 19-20 convention. 
Debates pitted leaders from the Traditional Values Coalition against 
the Institute for First Amendment Studies, and the Rutherford Institute 
against the American Civil Liberties Union. 
...Americans United's fifth annual report showed that the number of 
church-state conflicts continues to grow. Between September 1992 and 
August 1993, AUSCS reported 247 incidents at local and state levels, up 
from 196 in the previous year. Conflicts were divided into four 
categories: (1) religion in public schools; (2) free exercise of 
religion disputes; (3) public funding of religious organizations; and 
(4) state endorsements of religion. The group, which claims 50,000 
individuals and 4,000 religious and church bodies as members, named as 
two key threats the religious right's "systematic war of criticism 
against separation, especially in public schools." Equally as 
dangerous, the group said, were the attitudes of Americans, whom polls 
say overwhelmingly support the concept of church-state separation, but 
who, in practice, favor restoration of school prayers and government 
display of religious symbols. 

For liberalism to survive as an important political force, it must 
"accommodate the very deep spiritual values that move tens of millions 
of Americans," said Yale Law Professor Stephen Carter, author of The 
Culture of Disbelief: How American Law and Politics Trivialize 
Religious Devotion. Increasingly, public leaders who express religious 
convictions are deemed "right-wing" or "un-American," Carter said on 
The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour. Policies and causes should be evaluated on 
their own merits; the use of spiritual language to defend them should 
not in itself be considered objectionable, said Carter, an 
African-American and Episcopalian. He cited the Civil Rights Acts of 
1964 as a "good use of religious rhetoric," unlike many of the speeches 
at 1992's Republican Convention. 
..."I don't think there is any hostility toward religion in American 
life," Carter said. Many Americans list religion as the, or one of the, 
most important motivating forces in their lives. "Millions of Americans 
want to feel a resonance between the kind of spiritual values that move 
them and the kind of rhetoric that's welcomed in public debate." He 
noted that in 1992 "Bill Clinton [had] the ability to combine a clearly 
liberal social agenda with an ability to talk [of] the same spiritual 
things that made people of deep religious conviction feel welcome 
rather than repulsed. We need more of that." Several weeks ago, Clinton 
told a gathering of clergy (NIRR 9/6) that he had read Carter's book 
while on his vacation, and urged those in attendance to read it as 
well. 

Southern Baptist Convention leaders got what they have wanted for 
months: a meeting with the president. SBC President Ed Young and SBC 
Executive Committee President Morris Chapman spent about 90 minutes in 
a Sept. 16 White House meeting with Bill Clinton and Vice President Al 
Gore. Young and Chapman were accompanied by Wendell Estep, pastor of 
First Baptist Church in Columbia, S.C., and Rex Horne, pastor of 
Immanuel Baptist Church in Little Rock, which the president attended 
regularly while governor of Arkansas. 
...Some SBC leaders say they have been snubbed by the White House, 
which did not invite any of the denomination's top officials to 
interfaith meetings, including a recent prayer breakfast. Others 
suggest that Clinton and Gore, both Southern Baptists, were equally 
snubbed when not invited to the SBC's annual meeting (NIRR 6/28), which 
issued statements against the administration's stands on abortion and 
homosexual rights. 
...The topics arose again, as Young and Chapman expressed reservations 
about Clinton's apparent support for the pro-choice position and gay 
and lesbian agendas. Clinton affirmed his support for abortion rights, 
but expressed a strong personal distaste for the practice, especially 
when used as convenient contraception. Gore issued an impassioned 
environmental charge for churches to stop neglecting their biblical 
mandate as stewards of the earth. 
...Horne, who arranged the meeting, described it as a "frank, 
forthright, but also friendly" discussion. Although the leaders did not 
always agree, Young said the meeting was "very congenial, very warm" 
and had "no tension." The six men prayed together, and Estep urged the 
president to consider appointing a conservative evangelical to a high 
post to help his administration look "more like America" than the "far 
left." Chapman said the president was "a willing listener," and that he 
hoped they could have continued dialogues over areas of disagreement. 

The war over abortion cannot be won without personal dialogues with 
abortion providers, says former clinic coowner Carol Everett. She told 
NIRR that pro-lifers must commit to a "long-term, difficult" process of 
"building a relationship so that they trust that you don't have an 
ulterior motive." Everett left what she calls the "abortion industry" 
in 1983 after discussions with a minister resulted in her religious 
conversion. 
...Building bridges requires you to be a listener, not a talker, 
Everett said. Her Love an Abortionist program, part of her Dallas-based 
Life Network, encourages pro-lifers to make regular overtures to 
specific abortion providers, such as taking them cookies. "Yes, they're 
going to throw them at you the first few weeks. But pretty soon they 
are going to wonder about you because you keep coming back to them with 
this unconditional love." It may take years, she said, but "when they 
are willing to ask you questions, then you've earned the right to 
speak." Everett told NIRR about 150 U.S. abortion workers have left the 
business, including two doctors who later married their evangelizers. 
...Pastors walk a tightrope on the topic of abortion, Everett told 
NIRR. While they may feel "an obligation to call sin `sin,'" they also 
know that many women in the pews have had abortions, and they don't 
want to hurt them. Everett, who has served as an expert witness in 
legislatures and courts, said 70% of women who enter abortion clinics 
say they are Christians, and 27% attend church weekly. Since 25% of 
U.S. women have had an abortion, as have 17% of church-going women, she 
urges ministers to speak against abortion, but to go "heavy on the 
grace side" and provide post-abortive counseling. "Once you lance that 
wound, it can start to heal." 

"Basic human greed lies behind any of the problems in health reform," 
said C. Everett Koop. The former U.S. Surgeon General (NIRR 2/22; 
10/23/89) said coming to grips with the "spiritual dimension" of the 
health-care crisis is "the only ultimate solution to our problems." He 
said many groups are more interested "in their wealth than the health 
of people." At least 965 lobbying groups are "fighting like mad" to 
stake their claims in President Clinton's national health-care plan, 
Koop said. 
..."Patients are among the most greedy in the whole health-care 
equation. They want everything, when they want it, and they expect 
perfection," said Koop, who spoke to a group hosted by Keene (N.H.) 
State College's Christian Fellowship. "Many still believe we are our 
brother's keeper," said Koop, an evangelical Presbyterian. "But how 
deep is that concern?" He cited a poll showing 70% of Americans want to 
help the poor get health care, but only 20% themselves are willing to 
pay an additional $200 to do it. 
...America's religious-based tradition of altruism could accelerate 
health-care reform, but today's "chaos of rights" and spirit of 
individualism could impede reform, Koop told the group. "In an earlier 
time, the strength of the Judeo-Christian heritage, as an expression of 
Scripture, did provide a basic ethical consensus," a goal that is 
"increasingly difficult in our pluralistic society," he said. 
..."Americans have three basic incompatible demands when it comes to 
health care: immediate access, the most high-tech care available, and 
reasonable cost. I can provide any two, but not three," Koop said. 
Doctors, hospitals, insurance companies, patients, and taxpayers insist 
on doing things their own ways. 
...Koop said he is not a salesman or a point-man for Clinton's reforms, 
but the former Reagan appointee has agreed to moderate some health-care 
dialogue. "I'm standing between Mr. Clinton and his wife and the 
medical profession, and trying to interpret them to each other." The 
Clintons' health-care plan is raising serious apprehensions among some 
churches and Christian non-profit organizations. Churches and other 
non-profit employers will not be exempt from participating in the plan, 
said James Cobble of Matthews, N.C.-based Christian Ministry Resources. 
Under the Clinton proposal, employers would pay 80% of premiums and 
employees 20%. "In all likelihood, [churches] will be required to 
supply these benefits. It will cost millions," Cobble said. Nationally, 
40% of pastors and more than half of non-ordained church employees do 
not have health coverage from their churches, Cobble found in a recent 
poll of more than 9,000 church staff members. "While churches view this 
as an issue of fairness and justice in society, they tend to have a 
certain myopia when it comes to their own employees," he told NIRR. 
...Abortion coverage "would be a concern for many Christians," said 
Sylvia Nash of Christian Management Association, a Diamond Bar, Calif., 
group that assists managers of Christian organizations. The Clintons 
have indicated they want abortion covered under the plan, which 
conservatives have decried for months (NIRR 5/31). 
...The government's track record of administrative inefficiency is 
another concern. Christians want to help the poor, but "the government 
hasn't given us a tremendous reason to believe that they can be 
efficient," Nash said. "I conclude that medical care could only get 
worse if they push a program on us," said communications consultant 
Doug Ross of Tempe, Ariz. "There will be heavy negotiations with 
Congress, and only time will tell the results it will have on Christian 
organizations," Nash said. 

The Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, with House and Senate 
differences ironed out, affects charities in several ways, according to 
Nonprofit Alert: (1) When a contribution exceeds $75, and is given in 
exchange for something of value (a meal, a book, etc.), the charity 
must issue a receipt indicating the fair market value; (2) exchanges of 
goods or services claimed as deductions must be documented 
appropriately if the donor gives more than a $75 donation and receives 
something of value; (3) deductions for gifts over $250 must be 
documented by the charity; (4) some moving expenses may no longer be 
deducted; (5) the deduction for business meals and entertainment 
expenses will be reduced from 80% to 50% in 1994; (6) employer-given 
assistance toward education under Section 127 has been extended; (7) 
spouses' travel expenses have been reduced; and (8) increased tax rates 
for incomes above the $140,000 and $250,000 levels may motivate 
increased charitable giving from households earning above those 
thresholds. 

More than 15,000 people toured Focus on the Family's new Colorado 
Springs headquarters during its dedication Sept. 25. Much of the 
16-year-old ministry's 400,000-square-foot, multimillion-dollar 
facilities was donated, Chief Operating Officer Paul Nelson told NIRR. 
Founder James Dobson said the new campus, which employs 1,300, would 
better equip FOF to reply to the 10,000 letters and calls the ministry 
receives daily. FOF's mail is largely response to Dobson's half-hour 
radio show, broadcast on more than 2,000 U.S. radio stations daily, and 
heard in five different languages across 11 time zones world wide. 
Nelson said it costs $350,000 a day to operate FOF. 
..."I'm terrified to be running this ministry," Dobson told reporters. 
He said an unprecedented number of people were asking for Focus' help. 
"I don't know how to explain it except that people are very concerned 
about the family." The American family's greatest threat, he said, is a 
pace of living that leaves them exhausted. Dobson said FOF had been 
"careful to spread [its] money and resources as far as possible to 
reach as many aspects of culture as possible." Dobson has never 
received a salary from the ministry, and Nelson credited FOF's 2 
million constituents with continuing the organization's 52 separate 
ministries. 
...The dedication ceremony featured the Cadet Chorale and the Wings of 
Blue parachute team from the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado 
Springs. Former Colorado Sen. William Armstrong and Colorado Springs 
Mayor Bob Isaac hailed Focus for its positive influence. Isaac 
expressed amazement that so many "Focus-phobics" fear the organization. 
"They haven't lobbied. . . or tried to exert influence," he said, 
adding the group had brought jobs and an emphasis on family values. 
Other speakers included Kay Coles James, vice president of the Family 
Research Council, a Focus-founded education and lobbying group in 
Washington, and Tony Evans, founder of Urban Alternative, who urged the 
crowd to put aside racial differences and "reclaim the territory Satan 
has seized illegitimately." 
...James Dobson and Chuck Colson are a dangerous duo, the Prison 
Fellowship leader said a friend recently told him, because they "are in 
the battle for the soul of a nation." That being the case, Colson noted 
he was in good company, and continued his keynote address that warned 
of the "death of conscience today, mostly in our young people." He 
blamed the breakdown of the family for America's lack of a moral code, 
a contributor to the breakdown of society. He predicted the moral chaos 
would lead to tyranny within five years, unless Christians can save the 
family. He suggested they defend pro-family policies, stop the church 
from just appeasing its parishioners, stand for truth, and show the 
love of God incarnate. 
...The church needs a strategy to demonstrate Christian truth to the 
world at every level, Colson told NIRR, but it does not seem to have 
one. "No one has yet made the connection that if we can change popular 
culture, we can change cultural values," he said. This lack of 
understanding is indicative of the church's failure to teach a 
Christian worldview, Colson said. "People have said to me that we can't 
talk to pagans. But we can't retreat, and we can't just politicize -- 
that's pure humanism." 
...Pastors, who are on the front lines, must see their role to view 
popular culture as a bridge, to bring Christian truth, and to cultivate 
public virtue in society, Colson told NIRR. This can be done, Colson 
believes, through seminars and education so that ministries "begin 
demonstrating the Kingdom of God" to a post-Christian world. "People 
today are far more hostile to the gospel," but Christians cannot afford 
to react in a negative way. "Our strategy has to be to overcome evil 
with good." 

When it comes to media relations, "Christians tend to curl up in their 
own little world and get comfortable," said Jerry Theisen, pastoral 
assistant at Crystal Evangelical Free Church (NIRR 5/17). So the 
Minneapolis congregation declared August Media Month. Over the course 
of four Sundays, their forums about television, radio, newspapers, 
music, film, and theater attracted 1,000 church members and 50 people 
from the community. Local Christian and non-Christian broadcasters, 
producers, station managers, disc jockeys, actors, directors, and film 
critics spoke and answered questions from the audience. 
..."The purpose was to challenge believers to take seriously their role 
in influencing the media with righteous standards," pastor Stephen 
Goold told NIRR. Some sessions were low-key, others more emotional. One 
HIV-positive questioner wept as he asked how the media handle 
Christians who have AIDS. In another session, a community liaison from 
the Minneapolis Star Tribune faced questions over the newspaper's 
perceived liberal bias. 
..."The media are big, but not oblivious to pressure," Theisen told 
NIRR. Contrary to popular Christian belief, participants "learned that 
their voices are listened to," whether in letters of complaint or 
praise, he said. 

Religious News Service turned 60 years old last month. Founded by 
British journalist Louis Minsky in 1933, the service was funded with a 
$10,000 grant from the National Conference of Christians and Jews. RNS 
began as a weekly, interfaith column sent to about 100 selected 
publications. The service, now owned by the United Methodist Reporter 
in Dallas, provides resource material to 72 daily newspapers and 
several hundred religious organizations, broadcast stations, and 
smaller news outlets through its syndication services. 
...RNS has expanded its coverage to approximately 40 articles a week. 
Executive Editor Judy Weidman said the growth will help meet the varied 
needs of media nationwide and "the expanded appetite for news." 

American Reform Jewish and World Muslim League leaders seek to foster 
"Judeo-Islamic fraternity" in the United States. They contributed to an 
interfaith manual they believe to be the first of its kind, 
Shalom/Salaam. The handbook for Jewish-Muslim dialogue was published by 
the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. Union of Reformed 
Synagogues spokesman Richard Cohen told NIRR the materials encourage 
joint meetings and programs based on ideas and experience of the expert 
contributors. The two religious groups are confronted with 
"surprisingly similar problems in [American] society that is still 
overwhelmingly Christian," said Jonathan Sarna, chair of Near Eastern 
and Judaic studies at Brandeis University. "The neutral American 
environment should make possible a level of religious interaction 
between Jews and Muslims that would be unthinkable either in Arab 
countries or in Israel." 
...Years before Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed 
their historic agreements, a similar spiritual peace accord was 
launched. Musalaha, Arabic for reconciliation, is the name of a 
3-year-old Jersualem-based ministry that unites Arabs and Jews who 
believe in Jesus Christ. Founder Salim Munayer told NIRR that deeply 
ingrained suspicion and fear affected unity until staff started holding 
seminars in the desert: living together in Bedouin tents, eating from 
common bowls, and traveling by camel to wells and threshing floors 
precious to their common ancestors. "We pair one Arab and one Jew on 
each camel, and they spend the day doing everything together," he said. 
"It's amazing how fast mutual dependency and common discomfort break 
down political barriers." 
..."With Jews and Palestinians making peace, it's no wonder there are 
Jews believing in Jesus, too!" was one response to a holiday greeting 
Jews for Jesus ran in 20 major metropolitan newspapers between the 
Jewish New Year and Yom Kippur. The full-page ad wished readers "A 
Blessed and Happy 5754!" and listed the names of 2,000 Jews who believe 
"that Y'shua (Jesus) is truly the Messiah of Israel, according to the 
prophets." Fourteen Jewish Christian congregations sponsored the 
$250,000 campaign. Response so far has been "very encouraging," both 
from Christians and seekers, said Susan Perlman, associate executive 
director of Jews for Jesus. "Many found the idea of a megagreeting card 
like that engaging," she told NIRR. New York parents of a California 
staff couple whose names were included called to tell their son, "You 
didn't have to be so extravagant to wish us happy Rosh Hashana!" One 
day after the ad ran in the Los Angeles Times, thieves broke into 
Ahavat Zion Messianic Synagogue in Beverly Hills, and stole the Torah 
(Scroll of the Law), an essential centerpiece of Jewish worship. Rabbi 
Stuart Dauermann said the crime may have been triggered in part by his 
congregation's help with the ad. 

Billy Graham borrowed Ohio's state motto, "With God, All Things Are 
Possible," for his Columbus crusade Sept. 22-26. The evangelist first 
held meetings in the state capital in 1964. In anticipation of large 
crowds, workers added 15,000 extra seats to Cooper (formerly Jet) 
Stadium to double the capacity. 
...Some were driven -- literally -- to pray for the crusade. Several 
intercessors covered Columbus' highways by car, while two older women 
drove around the state border, more than 1,000 miles, praying for the 
crusade and the people of Ohio. In addition, hundreds of the 500 
churches supporting the evangelistic outreach held prayer meetings 
across the area. The weekend before the crusade began, 800 young people 
formed a prayer chain around the stadium. 
...Graham was "converted" to a Buckeye fan in a meeting with Ohio State 
University President Gordon Gee before the first crusade. The two 
discussed the needs of students, whom Graham said he hoped to meet 
since 17 buses were available to shuttle people from the campus to the 
Saturday meetings. Wearing an OSU lapel pin, the evangelist said he 
wanted to reach a "whole new generation." Two of his five crusades 
focused on providing youth with meaningful answers to their problems, 
including suicide, drugs, a lack of moral teaching, abuse, sex, and 
crime. He said that youth violence was "not just a Florida problem -- 
it is an American problem, and it may be a world problem. We know it is 
a spiritual problem, and the gospel of Christ has the power to help 
bring that under control." 
...The five-day crusade drew a standing-room-only total of 173,500 
people, and had the support of Ohio Gov. George Voinovich and Columbus 
Mayor Greg Lashutka, both of whom sat on the platform. Former Cleveland 
Indian Andre Thornton, and American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole 
were among the high-profile Christians who gave strong testimonies of 
their faith. Musical guests, all new to Graham crusades, included 
gospel artist Juli Henderson, country star Ricky Skaggs, the Glenn 
Draper Singers, and Dove Award winners 4 Him. In addition, Nashville 
legends June and Johnny Cash joined Graham for the final evening. On 
the average, nearly 35,000 attended each night, and more than 2,200 
came forward in response to nightly invitations to receive Christ, the 
Billy Graham Evangelistic Association reported. BGEA will follow up 
with evangelistic radio broadcasts throughout October. Graham is 
scheduled to return to Ohio in June for a crusade in Cleveland. 
...The crusade had an Asian outreach as well. Graham met with Japanese 
church leaders representing more than 600 Tokyo congregations 
participating in Mission '94. The Jan. 13-16 crusade at the Tokyo Dome 
will be beamed by satellite to some 100 locations across the islands. 
Organizers, who attended one of the Columbus meetings, said Graham's 
sixth Japanese crusade comes at a critical time. Less than 1% of the 
country's population is Christian, a barrier leaders hope to see broken 
and replaced by a unified vision for church growth. 

Never before have the highest-ranking religious affairs officials from 
the People's Republic of China visited the United States. East Gates 
Ministries International is hosting the nine leaders on an eight-city 
U.S. tour, which began at EGMI's Seattle headquarters Sept. 19. The 
Chinese delegation came to America to study the relationship between 
the government and Christian churches, and to see how religious 
activity impacts the country, both socially and spiritually, said Zhang 
Sheng-zuo, director of China's Religious Affairs Bureau under the State 
Council. The delegation will report its findings to Beijing's Communist 
Central Committee after it returns Oct. 12. 
...EGMI President Ned Graham said he hoped the delegation's report 
would yield "greater freedoms for all Chinese Christians" and those of 
other faiths. Before their departure, the Chinese leaders were told 
that Beijing was moving to relax religious restrictions. Clergy who had 
been imprisoned for their faith were released, and the Three Self 
Patriotic Movement, China's sanctioned Protestant church, would stop 
required registration of house churches. 
...The delegation is said to be especially curious about American 
youths' interest in Christianity, the effect of cults on society, and 
improving communication and religious exchanges between American and 
Chinese churches. The nine leaders will meet with representatives of 
several Christian organizations, including the Salvation Army, Prison 
Fellowship, the American Bible Society, the Institute on Religion and 
Democracy, and the National Association of Evangelicals. In addition, 
the leaders are scheduled to worship at several Chinese churches, 
Robert Schuller's Crystal Cathedral, and E.V. Hill's Mt. Zion 
Missionary Baptist Church. 
...In Washington, they also will meet with Justice Department 
officials, numerous legislators, and the Congressional Ethics and 
Public Policy Committee. In Houston the leaders will meet former 
President George Bush, who served as ambassador to China. On the 
California agenda are discussions with state dignitaries, Gov. Pete 
Wilson, and former President Richard Nixon. The leaders also will speak 
with local, state, and federal agency officials and parachurch leaders 
in New York, Atlanta, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. 
...The trip could have "far-reaching effects" on Chinese religious 
attitudes and Sino-American relations, said Billy Graham, whose 
Columbus crusade the delegation attended. His wife, Ruth, who was 
raised in China, said she was pleased to see the "beginning of a new 
era" in which China would extend further religious freedoms. EGMI's 
Project Light, under an agreement with the Chinese government, will 
distribute 1.1 million Bibles, especially to believers in house 
churches, in hopes of reconciling all China's Christians. 

Russia's controversial religion law is in effect dead, although 
political stability could resurrect it. Before dissolving the hard-line 
parliament that passed the revised measures, President Boris Yeltsin 
reportedly returned the bill unsigned to the Supreme Soviet. Until 
Yeltsin and the hold-out legislature, which has been meeting despite 
its dismissal, settle their squabbles over democracy, missions experts 
say, the bill is unlikely to be enacted. 
...Russian Orthodox Patriarch Aleksy II was in the United States to 
celebrate the bicentennial of Orthodoxy in North America when the news 
broke. Although his church strongly supported the bill, he had few 
comments on Yeltsin's move, except that he supported democratic 
government, and had called for compromise, "peace and calmness," to 
avoid a bloody civil war. Father Gleb Yakunin, a born-again Orthodox 
dissident and the bill's leading opponent in the parliament, told a 
Washington meeting sponsored by the Institute of Religion and Democracy 
that Aleksy, who once stripped him of his parish, probably would no 
longer stand with his allies in the disbanded legislature. The 
million-member Orthodox Church in America, which hosted the patriarch's 
trip, has taken no official stand on the law. OCA officials in New 
York, however, agree with their Russian brothers that many western 
groups do not understand Orthodoxy as a Christian faith, nor respect 
its 1,000-year tradition in Russia. 
...Aleksy retraced the steps of the eight monks from St. Petersburg who 
brought the faith to Alaska 200 years ago. After liturgies and visits 
to historical Orthodox sites in San Francisco and Chicago, the 
patriarch returned to Russia five days earlier than expected, forgoing 
scheduled meetings with President Clinton and United Nations Secretary 
General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. Religious News Service quoted a 
spokesman for the OCA, who surmised that the patriarch wanted to be 
with his people to lend spiritual support during the crisis. 

Equal access to the pastorate? Between 70% and 80% of American adults 
find it "perfectly acceptable for a woman to be the pastor or head 
minister of a church," according to the Barna Research Group. Whether 
Catholic or Protestant, rich or poor, male or female, married or 
single, parents of minors or not, American laity generally accept 
female religious leadership. The numbers are lower among those 
classified as "born again" and "evangelical" (67% and 45%, 
respectively). George Barna said conservative churches are holding out 
for doctrinal reasons which "few Christians understand and which 
millions reject." Approval ratings for women as clergy were higher than 
the national average among mainline Protestants (86%), Americans not 
attending church regularly (85%), voters registered as independents 
(84%), college graduates (81%), and the 18- to 27-year-old Baby Busters 
(81%). 

The new International Lutheran Council may help conservative Lutherans 
protect their historic confessions and beliefs in the inspiration and 
infallibility of Scripture. The ILC was formed Sept. 9 in Guatemala as 
a counterpart, but not competition, to the more liberal Lutheran World 
Federation; in fact, churches from Nigeria, India, South Korea, New 
Guinea, and the Philippines are members of both the ILC and the LWF. 
Among the 25 bodies from 18 countries that joined as founding members 
is the 2.6-million-member Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, but the 
5.2-millionmember Evangelical Lutheran Church in America did not, 
Religious News Service reported. ILC documents urge member 
denominations "to share information, study theological questions and 
concerns together, and issue statements when asked to do so by its 
members." Members will also work closely on missions and ministry 
efforts. 

For the first time, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship has commissioned 
three new missionary couples who are not Southern Baptists. CBF 
President Keith Parks led services last month to appoint the six, 
including his son, Stanley, and his wife. The younger Parks will serve 
in an Asian country, undisclosed because of the sensitivity of working 
among unreached Muslim peoples. The other two couples, the Bengstons 
and the Williames, will serve in Miami, Fla., and in the Czech Republic 
at a Baptist seminary, respectively. The couples are the first new 
career missionaries for the CBF, which has 20 other missionaries, all 
serving in Europe. 

EXTRAS, MOST OF THEM USABLE: +PEOPLE/ Little League--jes 9/17+ How old 
is Sean? SAVE FOR WORLD SERIES "Whenever there were, like, two outs or 
two strikes or something, I'd ask God for help -- and it worked," Long 
Beach Little League All-Stars shortstop and pitcher Sean Burroughs told 
NIRR. The All-Stars recently became the first U.S. team to win the 
world title two years in a row. Through the Western regionals and the 
World Series, Burroughs pitched 20 consecutive innings without allowing 
a hit. During the Series, he struck out 32 batters, and got nine hits, 
including two home runs. Burroughs told his mother during the game, 
"When I have two strikes against me, I've been asking God to give me 
something to hit. He hasn't let me down yet." (Long Beach 
Press-Telegram) 

+WORLD REL/ Santeria.lar+ Save for Halloween Santeria is gaining 
popularity among white middle-class professionals. "Anglo-Saxon 
Americans have become heavily involved" in the Afro-Cuban religion, 
which uses magical herbal prescriptions, healing, spiritism, and animal 
sacrifice (NIRR / ), according to scholar and former Santeria priest 
Raul Canizares. "A lot of white people do it to get ahead in their 
careers," he told NIRR. "The magical component" helps alter events or 
one's fate, said Canizares, who teaches a course on Santeria at the 
University of Florida in South Tampa. An estimated 1 million Americans 
practice the religion, which began in Nigeria and was brought to the 
Spanish-speaking Caribbean by Yoruba slaves. Santeria is practiced most 
widely in Hispanic communities from Miami to New York to Chicago. 
...Santeria's gods are not immortal and must be fed, he said. Animals 
are killed as part of rituals for birth, death, marriage and the 
initiation of priests. Blood is offered to the gods, and the meat is 
cooked and eaten by worshipers of such deities as Shango, the god of 
thunder and lightning; Elegba, the god of destiny; and Ogun, the god of 
war. Santeria, whose followers have disguised their beliefs by adopting 
the trappings of Catholicism, ordinarily is practiced secretly in homes 
rather than churches. Most initiates are sworn to a code of silence. 
..."It is not just Santeria. A lot of alternative religions are 
attaining popularity. Wicca is growing at a tremendous rate, too," said 
Canizares, a Cuban native who was initiated into the priesthood at age 
7, had spent 10 years, three hours a day, studying its oral traditions. 
Canizares, whose "religion now is academia," recorded many of those 
traditions in his book Walking with the Night. Although it was written 
as a scholarly treatise, "people are using it almost as a sacred text," 
he told NIRR. +MIN/ SYATP--jen pr/faxes/intvw+ Participation in this 
year's See You at the Pole student-led prayer gathering may have 
doubled last year's figure of one million. "From 1 million to as many 
as 2 million junior high, high school, and college students came to 
pray this year," said Paul Fleischmann, 

Although Barna Research will not release its official counts on See You 
At The Pole until later this month, organizers are pleased with the 
turnout. Paul Fleischmann, executive director of the National Network 
of Youth Ministries (NNYM), the San Diego-based group promoting the 
rally, reported that 
...NNYM reports a 30% increase in attendance in San Diego. 
Internationally, 35,000-40,000 students are estimated to have turned 
out for Canada's first organized movement. In Russia 60 students prayed 
in Red Square. Legal roadblocks were minor, said Jay Sekulow, chief 
counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice, and students' free 
speech rights were constitutionally protected despite opposition in 
more than 20 states. +MIN/ Innercity/Pastoral pastor--9/25--lar+--may 
get to add a told NIRR. Inner-city pastor Ternae Jordan is tired of 
burying young black boys who haven't had time to live. Jordan, pastor 
of Greater Progressive Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Ind., created Stop 
the Madness campaigns to prevent street violence. More than 1,000 young 
people, some referred to Jordan by Fort Wayne's juvenile probation 
department, have attended day-and-overnight camps. Role-playing and 
discussions help them form a deeper sense of purpose and set goals. 
Camping also includes swimming, chores, Bible study, canoeing, and 
singing by the campfire. A mentoring program matches each camper with a 
African-American role model. 
...Gang members trust Jordan, and many of them call him at home, 
sometimes late at night. One called the pastor as he was getting ready 
to preach. Jordan said the youth told him he was about to hurt another 
kid who had crossed him. Jordan hurriedly left the church to talk the 
young man out of such violence. 
...But Jordan would rather prevent violence than intervene to stop it. 
Jordan, 36, who is black and is a former high school teacher, doesn't 
believe gang members are evil. He insists they are kids from broken 
homes for whom gangs become their families, giving them security and 
people who care about them. gangs become their families, giving them 
security and people who care about them.

Vol. 7, No. 20                                                    
September 20, 1993 

Moscow's struggle over religion laws may be tied to the larger battle 
for constitutional reform. The Russian parliament's lone evangelical, 
Gleb Yakunin, said President Boris Yeltsin will veto the newer, more 
restrictive religion law passed by the Supreme Soviet Aug. 27 (NIRR 
9/6). The foreign bureau of Baptist Press reported that, by Sept. 8, 
more than 170 U.S. congressmen and European leaders had expressed 
concerns about the law to Yeltsin. Russian Orthodox legislator 
Vyacheslav Polosin again has taken his campaign for the new law to the 
mass media, but Orthodox Patriarch Alexy II has lobbied less actively 
than before. 
...Yeltsin must act on the law by Sept. 20, and any legislative attempt 
to override a veto will be challenged in Constitutional Court, Yakunin 
said. Both Yeltsin's delay of his veto until the deadline and the 
potential court case are attempts to buy time for Russia to move closer 
to adopting a new constitution, Baptist Press indicated. The current 
draft of the constitutional reform package is said to guarantee freedom 
of religious practice. 

Despite uncertainty over the Russian law, about 350 Ministry of 
Education officials studied Christian ethics in the city of Kislovodsk 
Sept. 14. American delegates from the International School Project 
(ISP), a division of the Jesus Film Project, presented their curriculum 
to the educators, spokesman Mike Waid said. Participants, including 
curriculum writers, school administrators, and 20 officials from the 
educational division of the Russian Orthodox Church, represented 150 
regions of the Commonwealth of Independent States. At the convocation, 
they observed training techniques, and reviewed elementary and 
secondary public school curricula that integrate biblical morals and 
ethics. Waid told NIRR that although current legislation restricts 
Christian activities, the convocation ministry is likely to continue 
"because of its professional emphasis on education." ISP is talking 
with Russian Orthodox Church leaders about forming a partnership since 
"they want to see these things happen, too," he said. 
...ISP surveyed the 4,701 Russian, Bulgarian, and Albanian educators 
who attended one of its 38 convocations. Of the 1,350 who responded, 
96% indicated that since attending the convocation they have been 
reading and discussing the Bible in their classrooms. Almost 80% said 
they would favor meeting monthly with others who are also using the 
Christian Ethics curriculum, and 71% report having shown the Jesus film 
to their students. 

A Lutheran musical team hopes the story of its "miracle" will help 
bring Russians to Christ. The short-term missionaries with Fellowship 
Ministries, based in Tempe, Ariz., were returning from a missions trip 
to Siberia when their plane lost both engines over Alaska, Religious 
News Service reported. As the pilot glided the plane toward a splash 
landing, his six passengers prayed and planned how to survive the 
crash. Each held on to empty five-gallon gas cans as the plane sank 
into the sea. Although they quickly were plagued by hypothermia, they 
prayed, cited Bible verses, and tried to stay together. Eventually, 
another pilot spotted them and radioed for help. Two helicopter survey 
crews pulled them to safety; some of the seven had been in the icy 
water for an hour. News of the crash has reached Russia, and musician 
David Anderson said, "The team is praying that people who are drowning 
in their own troubles and problems will understand that the God who 
rescued this group will also rescue them." 

More than 1,000 voting members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in 
America met in Kansas City, Mo., to be "Rooted in the Gospel." At the 
church's third biennial Churchwide Assembly Aug. 25-Sept. 1, officials 
of the fourth-largest U.S. Protestant denomination approved Freed in 
Christ, a social statement on race, ethnicity, and culture. They also 
put forth a two-year study of a plan to ensure that ELCA governing 
bodies contain at least 50% laity, of which half are male and half are 
female. Remaining voting members would be ordained ministers, and at 
least 10% of all voting members would be people of color or those who 
speak English as a second language. In Caring for Creation, ELCA 
delegates expressed concern over the "degradation of God's gracious 
gift of creation," and urged members to be hopeful as they heed "the 
call to justice and commitment" to the environment. 
...The ELCA will have diaconal ministers, but they will not be 
ordained, despite a recommendation to do so. After five years of study 
and debate, the assembly voted 790-192 to establish the new order of 
ministry. Diaconal ministers will be laypersons who serve the church as 
professionals -- education or music ministers, for example. They would 
not provide word or sacrament service as would ordained ministers 
"entrusted with special responsibility for the application and spread 
of the gospel and this church's teaching." The ELCA, however, affirmed 
the historical Lutheran emphasis on the priesthood of the believer, and 
all baptized Christians' call to minister in the name of God. 
...ELCA's 1992 membership decreased by 0.2%, to 5,234,568, but giving 
increased about 4%, the Office of the Secretary reported. Donations 
totaled more than $41 million, most of which stayed at local church 
levels. Gifts to a variety of church benevolence causes also increased, 
and delegates allocated $12.25 million for ELCA World Hunger in 1994, 
as part of the denomination's nearly $79-million churchwide budget. 
...By 1997 the ELCA may have full communion with three other bodies: 
the United Church of Christ, the Reformed Church in America, and the 
Presbyterian Church (USA). Delegates voted 753-119 to move forward on 
the unity plan (NIRR 4/19), which would allow members to take communion 
at any of the churches. As well, clergy could preach to other 
congregations. In another effort to put aside centuries-old 
differences, the ELCA is seeking a separate full communion agreement, 
also by 1997, with the Episcopal and Roman Catholic churches. 
...Herbert Chilstrom surprised delegates by announcing he will not run 
for re-election when his second term expires in 1995. Chilstrom, the 
church's first national bishop, led the merger that created the ELCA, 
and also named the new denomination. His successor will be elected at 
the 1995 assembly in Minneapolis, which is expected to undertake 
questions of homosexual ordination and representational quotas for 
churchwide groups. 

After a 20-year relationship, Thomas Perea is suing his former Catholic 
priest for transmitting HIV to him. Named in the suit are retired 
priest Delbert Blong, 67, and the Diocese of Pueblo, which Perea says 
should have known about the abuse. The priest-parishioner relationship 
began in 1971. Perea said Blong took advantage of his emotional 
distress as a confused 15-year-old, and sexually molested him. Perea 
also said he broke off his involvement with Blong last year. He said 
that after seeing a television show featuring members of the 
Chicago-based Survivors Network for Those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, 
he came to see himself as a victim. 
...But who infected whom? Perea claims that his only unprotected sex 
was with the former priest. He alleged Blong admitted to having 
multiple partners, and refused to have "safe sex" in their encounters. 
Blong, who is also HIV-positive, admitted to the Denver Post that his 
sexual relationship with Perea was "very wrong." But he told the Rocky 
Mountain News and NBC's Today that Perea was his only sexual partner, a 
suggestion that Perea infected Blong. The case is said to be the first 
alleging a priest infected a parishioner with the AIDS virus. 

"This group is not politically correct," says Joseph Nicolosi, a 
licensed clinical psychologist who helped found a growing national 
organization that promotes change for homosexuals. Some 200 therapists, 
psychoanalysts, social workers, counselors, and other mental health 
professionals have risked stigma and censure from their peers by 
joining the National Association for Research and Therapy for 
Homosexuality, in Encino, Calif. Others who agree in principle with 
NARTH have stayed in the closet, the group's leaders say. 
...NARTH challenges the attitude that trying to cure homosexuality is 
unethical, and criticizes psychiatric associations that promote 
acceptance of a homosexual lifestyle as normal. "Those of us who 
believe homosexuality is a treatable condition share information and 
refine therapeutic techniques," Nicolosi said. "Many studies from many 
therapists show a 25%-30% complete cure rate," and many more "benefit 
in significant ways from therapy." 
..."Homosexual behavior is a thwarted attempt to repair oneself with 
sex," Nicolosi told NIRR. Homosexuals commonly seek masculine attention 
because of the lack of affection and approval from their fathers, said 
Nicolosi, who has treated some 240 men for homosexuality in 12 years. 
That lack turns to envy, then to idolizing and eroticizing another man, 
he said. "In the normal scheme of things, we are attracted to 
opposites. For the homosexual man, it is men who are mysterious." 
..."Good psychology is good theology," Nicolosi said. "The healing of 
homosexuality is friendship -- Christian, non-sexual intimacy," he told 
NIRR. "We are all heterosexual. Our Christian tradition saw that nobody 
could be homosexual -- it is against nature. Adulthood means 
heterosexuality." 

"The church is finally aware that simply preaching against 
homosexuality is not enough," Joe Dallas, former Exodus International 
president, told NIRR. The interest generated by the group's annual 
meeting this summer, and other such gatherings, is evidence, he said. 
Over 500 representatives from more than 40 regional ministries to those 
involved in homosexuality gathered at Asbury Theological Seminary in 
Wilmore, Ky., to network, and attend seminars and workshops by a number 
of experts, including Exodus president John Smid, and Dallas, who now 
directs Genesis Counseling in Orange, Calif. Keynote speaker Jean 
Norment from Servants of His Heart called on participants, many of whom 
are ex-gays, to "cry out for holiness. In the process, you will be 
healed." 
..."The church is responding to a two-pronged wake-up call," Dallas 
said. First, Christians "need to voice our united resistance to the 
movement toward normalizing homosexuality." But second, "and easily as 
important, we also need to voice our united concern for the many women 
and men who struggle against homosexuality, and who are our sisters and 
brothers within the church." Dallas said that in conjunction with next 
year's Exodus conference in Colorado, similar smaller meetings would 
take place all over the country. He said the church is "looking toward 
ministry. That's the half of the effort that's been missing so far." 

No one showed up for church Aug. 22 at Christ Chapel in Madison, Conn., 
but that's how the pastor planned it. "It's always a risk when you do 
something like this," said Tom Ruotolo, who canceled the Sunday service 
at his Christian and Missionary Alliance (CMA) church. He urged his 
congregation to visit other evangelical churches in a show of Christian 
unity. Ruotolo produced a handout listing 15 churches -- including 
Episcopal, Assemblies of God, Brethren, Lutheran, Baptist, 
Congregational, and independent -- and alerted their pastors to expect 
visitors. Most of Ruotolo's parishioners participated, though a few 
opted to attend "Bedside Baptist," he joked. 
...Pastors at host churches had "all kinds of reactions," Ruotolo told 
NIRR. "Some really didn't know what to do with it, and some were 
overjoyed." The church the Ruotolo family visited introduced the 
guests, then asked him to speak briefly and sit next to the podium 
during the message. Others chose not to recognize the visitors. 
...Ruotolo said pastors often talk about unity, but still tend to be 
protectionists. "We talk about the doctrinal issues and differences, 
but the real issue is attendance." He acknowledged that unity Sundays 
might lead some people to switch church memberships, but questioned 
whether pastors should limit their parishioners' choices. "If they 
really like another church better, then maybe that's where they should 
be," he told NIRR. 

"A lot of us pastors are making ourselves sick and crazy trying to 
figure out how to score with yuppie boomers," said Ronald Weinelt, 60, 
founder of a support group called the Association for Battered Clergy, 
in Rincon, Ga. He told NIRR that many pastors function around some 
addictive patterns: "workaholism, perfectionism, control, 
successorientation, domination by statistics, or a need to be 
caretakers, people-pleasers, fixers, and rescuers." 
..."We are addicted to being good," Weinelt, a minister for 35 years, 
told NIRR. "The overwhelming majority of clergy have come out of 
dysfunctional home environments, and we are working that stuff out." 
But many church systems are "sick" and "co-dependent," he said. "We try 
to fix the stuff inside us by pleasing people. I don't think that is 
what Jesus was all about." Weinelt said a full life should balance duty 
to God, self, and others. 
...Pastors also are frustrated by parishioners' decreasing commitment, 
but increasing expectations of church of leaders, Weinelt told NIRR. 
"That's a real crazy maker." To help deal with these problems, Weinelt 
publishes The Parish Chute, a newsletter that mixes serious discussion 
with humor (1-912-826-5528). "As a fat boy growing up in an alcoholic 
home, I learned one way to deal with [my anger] was to be funny," he 
told NIRR. He said a "spiritual experience akin to the 12-step recovery 
program" can serve as a solution to help pastors accept their 
limitations. 

Sept. 19 was National Ministers Day in Assemblies of God churches. 
Terry Raburn, national director of the Division of Church Ministries, 
told NIRR that since 1982 the denomination has set aside the third 
Sunday of September as a time for "each church to thank, honor, and 
reward its pastor for his services." This year's theme, A Good Minister 
of Jesus Christ, was based on I Timothy 4:6. The AG suggested that 
church boards lead their members in appreciation tributes. To help, the 
denomination provided each congregation with an idea kit that detailed 
how other AG churches chose to encourage their pastors. Denominational 
officials have no statistics on how many congregations participate 
since specifics are left up to individual churches. 

Are fewer Americans attending church than previous polls have shown? A 
new study indicates that previously accepted rates reported by Gallup 
and other polls may be twice what they should be. In What the Polls 
Don't Show: A Closer Look at U.S. Church Attendance, Samford religion 
professor Penny Long Marler, Notre Dame sociology professor Mark 
Chaves, and the United Church Board for Homeland Ministries' Kirk 
Hadaway found that about 20% of Protestants and 28% of Catholics attend 
church on any given week. Chaves told Religious News Service that in 
telephone interviews, respondents tend to over-report what they 
perceive as "socially desirable behavior." Hadaway began the study 
because of the inconsistency between cited polling figures, church 
attendance records, and denominational claims of falling membership. 
The researchers used a variety of methods in their study, presented at 
the annual American Sociological Association meeting last month. 
Pollster George Gallup, Jr., had not seen the study, and told RNS he 
would have to examine its data collection methods before making any 
comment. 

Today's teen-agers want to discuss the existence of God, especially 
with peers, parents, and church leaders. The Gallup Youth Survey, 
conducted by the Princeton Religion Research Center, shows that 
three-fourths of the 64% who expressed great interest in discussion are 
church-goers. Between 50% to 56% of teens wanted to discuss the meaning 
of their lives, the existence of heaven and hell, how to decide right 
from wrong, and causes for hatred in the world. About 80% of young 
people wanted to discuss these issues with friends, family, or clergy, 
but only about 40% desired to engage teachers or college professors in 
such dialogue. Forty-three percent said they were very interested in 
exchanges about why bad things sometimes happen to good people. 

More than a year after Hurricane Andrew, Christians and steel companies 
are supporting its urban victims. MasterServe, a Christian construction 
ministry based in Fort Lauderdale, will construct 200 homes in Florida 
City using more than 1,000 tons of steel donated by six companies of 
the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). Because MasterServe will 
use steel in the framing and roofing systems, the homes in hurricane 
country will cost less and reportedly will be 25 times stronger than 
those with wood frames. 
...The project, dubbed Andrew Estates South, will provide free homes 
worth $50,000 to residents with incomes under $15,000. MasterServe 
President Gene Sitter told NIRR he concluded last November that no one 
was assisting the low-income people who were unable to replace their 
destroyed and uninsured homes. When Sitter learned from a business 
associate that the steel industry was looking to showcase the use of 
steel in home building, he approached the AISI on the possibilities of 
helping Andrew's hardest-hit homeowners. Sitter told NIRR, "The Lord 
kept moving it from there and touching hearts, and now it has become a 
reality." Other companies are donating trusses, siding, paint, and 
engineering services. Shipping is being provided by the American 
Trucking Association, Gifts in Kind America, and Operation Blessing. 
Sitter expects to begin construction this fall, as permits are 
approved. 

Churches that follow the old "barn-raising" model can get a lot done 
quickly, says Hard Hats for Christ Director Jim Hodges. For example, a 
Washington state Bible church completed a sanctuary and Sunday school 
rooms in just two weekends when 40 volunteers from seven area churches 
pitched in. Hodges' group, based in Kelso, Wash., coordinates 
construction volunteers to work on camps, schools, hospitals, churches, 
and mission agencies. Hard Hats for Christ has completed construction 
projects in 19 countries, most recently in Japan, Albania, and Canada. 
...But passivity is more common today among Christians than cooperative 
activism, said Hodges, who claims the church has changed in the 23 
years since he founded the group. Christians "would rather be 
ministered to than minister. The church has a welfare mentality. It 
wants to receive rather than participate," Hodges told NIRR. The 
attitude can lead to poor stewardship of money, he warned. "A lot of 
Christian agencies expect free work. If I don't have a volunteer 
available, they'll hire a plumber at full price" rather than do the 
work themselves. 
...Still, "we do projects wherever we're called," Hodges' assistant, 
Aric Fisher, told NIRR. He said the group also gives professional 
contractors and everyday handymen a chance to serve churches and 
agencies when their funds are tight. Hodges said that if more people 
would volunteer to help, Hard Hats for Christ could focus more on its 
other key goal: to organize Bible fellowships and provide more 
evangelistic outreaches among blue-collar workers. 

Plans to completely evangelize Costa Rica by the end of the decade show 
"amazing promise," believes Luis Bush, international director of AD 
2000 and Beyond. At a Partnership 2000 summit in early August in San 
Jose, Costa Rica, representatives from 30 major Christian organizations 
working in Latin America (including the Billy Graham Evangelistic 
Association, Campus Crusade for Christ International, the Alberto 
Mottesi Evangelistic Association, and the Christian Broadcasting 
Network) joined to coordinate evangelization strategies. A special 
report says their purpose is to help Latin America's national churches 
saturate each country with the gospel. 
...The vision is not to remain behind church walls, "but rather to 
focus beyond them," said Rudolfo Saenz, president of the Evangelical 
Association of Costa Rica, a sponsor of the Costa Rican pilot project. 
The initiative has the support of 90% of the country's evangelical 
churches, with leaders from major denominations sitting on the steering 
committee. Bush reported the summit also encouraged churches to play a 
significant role in world missions. 
...Costa Rican churches agreed to send at least 500 missionaries to 
more than 50 unreached peoples in a church planting movement, Bush 
said. Along with the churches' "remarkable unity" is "a desire to do 
things right," he said. The group plans a Costa Rica National Congress 
with other Latin American leaders in February to "spread the vision." 
Bush also said that soon as many as 100 major Christian organizations 
in Latin America will use the Costa Rica model, which is "likely to 
have a major impact on saturation evangelism, church planting, and 
cross-cultural missions in and from the Latin American nations for many 
years to come." 

The newly formed Cambodian Christian Federation will help churches in 
Cambodia learn to cooperate, according to one of the CCF's founders, 
Vek Huong Taing, Campus Crusade for Christ's Cambodian national 
director. Taing is widely known among Cambodian Christians; his sermons 
are aired by the Far East Broadcasting Co., and on many visits he has 
helped existing house churches with evangelism and discipleship. He 
recently returned from a six-week tour of Cambodia, where he helped 
plant new churches -- five in the Battambang province alone. Taing told 
NIRR, "If the churches all have the same goal -- to work hard for God 
-- unity will come." 
...In 1975, Taing, his wife, and their infant son stayed with the young 
people they were discipling, despite the Khmer Rouge attack on Phnom 
Penh. Eventually, they were driven into the jungle in Battambang, where 
they ate nothing but grass and bark for weeks. They remember thanking 
God for a special second anniversary "feast" -- the head and skin of a 
dead rat. According to Taing's biography, Ordeal in Cambodia, after 
four years under the Khmer Rouge, they escaped across the Thai border, 
then to Long Beach, Calif., where Taing pastors a Cambodian church. 
...Of the 300,000 Cambodians the Khmer Rouge drove into Thailand, 
20,000-30,000 received Christ in refugee camps, Taing told NIRR. Now 
that they are back home in Cambodia, their hearts are open and "the 
spiritual harvest is there," he said. But many, encouraged by new 
political freedoms, look to the Sihanouk government, rather than to 
Christ, to meet their needs. Foreign missions tend to focus more on 
social work than on soul-winning, he said. "We have to work for God 
before the door closes again. He gives us freedom to worship and serve 
Him. We have to take advantage of that." Taing and his wife, Samoeun, 
hope to return to Cambodia to work full time with Christians there.  An 
alliance of international radio ministries spread a blanket of prayer 
over the global regions not yet covered by their gospel programming. On 
the World by 2000 Day of Prayer Sept. 10, staff of the Far Eastern 
Broadcasting Co. (FEBC), World Radio Missionary Fellowship-HCJB, the 
Society for International Ministries, and Trans World Radio met at 
studios and transmitting sites around the world, where they closed 
offices or reduced schedules to permit times of group prayer throughout 
the day. The agencies agreed in 1985 to identify the world's 
mega-languages (spoken by 1 million or more people) which had no gospel 
broadcasts. Avoiding duplication and gaps, they divided stewardship 
responsibilities for those people groups, and are developing gospel 
radio programs for each. In the last six years, the agencies have added 
broadcasts in 51 new mega-languages. "Our focus on mega-languages does 
not preclude the leading of the Holy Spirit in developing broadcasts 
for smaller groups," Jim Bowman, FEBC's director for field operations, 
told NIRR. 

Evangelical Christians are pleased with recent changes to Canada's 
Broadcast Act, Christian Week reported. This summer the Canadian 
Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) voted 8-6 to 
relax its policies. For the first time since 1932, Christian 
organizations will be allowed to hold broadcasting licenses. 
Single-faith broadcasters had been prohibited from owning stations, 
although Christian programs are aired on commercial and interfaith 
stations, such as Vision TV. Canadian media officials had maintained 
the limited number of frequencies made it necessary for all 
broadcasters to present a balance of religious views. But the 
availability of some 200 channels made restructuring of the industry 
and compromise possible. 
...The importance Canadians placed on religious values frequently 
surfaced during months of public debate, said CRTC Chairman Keith 
Spicer. He said the CRTC must balance its support for freedom of 
expression with its concerns over the promotion of religious 
intolerance and the excesses of American televangelism. The CRTC 
proposes that all-Christian cable channels will operate on a 
"discretionary" tier, where subscribers would pay to unscramble their 
signals. They would maintain strict guidelines on Canadian content, 
fund raising, and "balanced" opposing viewpoints. Local and regional 
stations, though, will be required to reflect the range of beliefs of 
only the communities they serve. This month the CRTC will review plans 
submitted by religious broadcasters. Willard Thiessen, head of the 
National Christian Broadcasters, said implementation will likely be hit 
and miss. Professionals concur that changes possible under the new 
interpretation of the law are unlikely to take place until 1995. 

U.S. cable television has been told to broadcast the gospel. New 
Federal Communications Commission regulations require cable companies 
to air local, full-power commercial television, including religious 
stations when requested. Stations are not compensated, and must deliver 
a good quality signal and not duplicate other programming. 
..."From a Christian perspective, this law has been a blessing in 
really getting the gospel carried further," said Bob Higley, national 
cable director of the Santa Ana, Calif.-based Trinity Broadcasting 
Network. TBN has added 5 million households in the last three months as 
a direct result of the "must-carry" regulation. Meanwhile, cable 
companies claim the new laws infringe on their First Amendment rights. 
Several legal challenges are pending. 

...Cable companies often were discriminatory against religious 
programming, Christian broadcasters said. "Religious stations were not 
being given the same type of carriage as other stations. The new cable 
law makes it a level playing field," Higley told NIRR. Philip Mowbray 
of Chicago's WCFC, a Christian television station, told NIRR, "The 
cable people had their way with broadcasters for years and didn't take 
care of their customers as they should have, so the legislators took 
care of the cable systems." 
...A new fee structure gives cable companies incentive to add stations. 
Guidelines allow cable companies to base fees on the number of stations 
they offer. That has boosted religious networks and other small 
networks, Higley said. 
...Satellite religious networks, which do not come under provisions of 
the regulation, must compete harder for a diminishing number of 
available slots on the cable now that local stations have guaranteed 
carriage. The satellite signal for TBN, which has both local and 
satellite components, was dropped in markets in Florida and 
Massachusetts recently as local broadcasters acquired must-carry 
rights, Higley said. 

NYPD Blue is too blue for some ABC television affiliates. Nearly 40 
stations are refusing to run the new program, touted by creator Stephen 
Bochco as network TV's first "R-rated" series. Decency crusader Don 
Wildmon, head of the American Family Association, said he expected even 
more local stations to join the record number of markets rejecting the 
program. Affiliates reportedly told Wildmon they had received more 
complaints about the show than any other in television history. The 
show, which Bochco said he designed to push television standards for 
sex and nudity, violence, and language, debuts Sept. 21 at 10 p.m. EST. 

It took five trucks to carry Robert Tilton's records from Tulsa to 
Dallas so the televangelist could comply with a judge's order (NIRR 
8/23). The documents were requested last year as evidence in a lawsuit 
brought by Norma Smith against Tilton and his Dallas-area church. 
Smith's lawyers described the flamboyant delivery as a publicity stunt. 
They have not yet determined whether the records they requested are 
within the five truckloads of material, news sources indicated. Tilton 
refused to deliver the documents when first subpoenaed, so state 
District Judge Eric Moye assessed him $81,742.50 in legal fees. Tilton 
said he expected to be taken to jail, so the fine was a lesser evil. 

A former Sudanese Muslim leader was both imprisoned and un-imprisoned 
for his Christian faith, according to News Network International (NNI). 
Sylvador Ali Ahmad, 38, was an imam over one district of Khartoum for 
11 years, but came to Christ in 1988 after doing comparative study of 
the Koran and the New Testament. For his apostasy, his wife divorced 
him. Years later, and under a more Islamicized government, Ahmad was 
arrested and challenged to recant his faith, which he refused to do. A 
High Court sentenced the "infidel" to six months in prison. It also 
dismissed him from his teaching position, divested him of his military 
rank, prohibited him from taking custody of his children, and took away 
his car, house, and bank account, he told NNI. 
...Ahmad spent three months in Omdurman Prison, but so many inmates 
were gathering for his Bible studies and prayer groups that authorities 
moved him to Gerif Prison. Again, Ahmad's bold teaching about Jesus and 
his miraculous answers to prayer reportedly drew numerous inmates to 
the Christian faith. Shortly before his release, Ahmad alleged that 
prison officials tried to take his life. When a prison vehicle taking 
Ahmad to the river mysteriously stalled, his guards were too unnerved 
to try to drown the captive. After his release, Ahmad told NNI, "They 
must have decided it was better for me to be outside the prison." 

Saudi Arabian religious police increasingly have persecuted Christians 
and Shi'ite Muslims since the start of the Persian Gulf War, according 
to London-based Amnesty International. Non-Muslim worship, even 
private, is forbidden in the kingdom, and authorities "are given free 
rein to raid private homes and arrest those caught praying" in secret 
worship services and Bible studies, the human rights group reported. 
Amnesty documented 329 cases of Christian arrests since August 1990. 
During the war, while U.S. forces defended the country, authorities 
raided three Christian meetings. Members of the fellowships were 
detained, beaten, and some flogged with 150 lashes. Most victims were 
short-term workers from the Philippines, South Korea, India, and other 
developing countries. Only four Westerners were detained, typical of 
the religious tolerance extended to military allies during the Iraqi 
conflict. Overall, hundreds of Christians have been arrested, 
mistreated, and eventually deported, often without charge or trial, the 
report said. 
...Scores of Shi'ites, who comprise 10% of Saudi Arabia's 14 million 
people, also have been plagued. Sunni Islam is the country's official 
religion, and because Shi'ites often protest against the government, 
they are both religious and political targets. Amnesty International 
urged the kingdom to accept international statements of human rights 
and to pass laws guaranteeing religious freedom. Saudi authorities have 
made no response to the report. 

The Parliament of the World's Religions was proof that the "Gnostic 
Empire" will strike back, Peter Jones told NIRR. The professor of New 
Testament at Westminster Theological Seminary, in Escondido, Calif., 
said plenaries by politicians and technocrats made it clear that the 
organizers had a pre-programmed agenda "to create liberalhumanistic 
unity" (NIRR 9/6). Among such demonstrations were approval of The 
Declaration of Global Ethic, which outlined core values and beliefs 
common to many faiths. Jones also said that "facilitators" were primed 
to ensure that nothing, including substantive theological issues, would 
stop the parliament from realizing its unstated goal: a mystical 
experience of pluralism. "The apostle Paul would doubtless have called 
the pagan `interfaith' celebrations `fellowship with demons,'" Jones 
said. Some Greek Orthodox groups agreed, and withdrew because of 
participation by Wiccans and other "quasi-religious" elements. Four 
Jewish groups left in protest because Louis Farrakhan (NIRR 5/31) of 
the Nation of Islam would be allowed to participate, despite his 
"anti-Semitic notions." 
...Traditional Christianity and Christian missions were implicitly and 
sometimes explicitly criticized by the parliament's 6,000 delegates 
from 150 world religions. David Steindl-Rast, for example, said he 
would not use Scriptures mentioning "Jesus" or "God" because use of 
those words would offend some faiths and cause disunity. 
...That did not deter Charles Colson, who opened his Sept. 2 acceptance 
speech for the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion (NIRR 2/22) 
with the words, "I speak as one transformed by Jesus Christ, the living 
God. He is the way, the truth and the life." Colson spoke of the four 
illusory "horsemen of the present apocalypse": that man is innately 
good, utopia is around the corner, truth is relative, and man is 
autonomous. Colson's address, in which he called for international 
religious liberty as "the essence of human dignity," drew several 
hundred parliament delegates, although the Templeton award ceremony was 
not officially affiliated with the centennial event. 
...Since some viewed attendance as a potential compromise of Christian 
testimony, evangelicals were scarce at the parliament. Some Christians, 
including cult-watcher Dave Hunt, criticized Colson as a pawn of 
ecumenism. Living Truth Ministries' Texe Marrs said the Prison 
Fellowship leader was wrong to associate in any way with a meeting that 
featured occultists, was funded by Illuminati money, and encouraged the 
rise of a universal church. A larger world religious parliament is 
planned in New Delhi, India, next February. 

Journalists are not "overwhelmingly irreligious skeptics," but they may 
not know how to cover religion, according to the Freedom Forum First 
Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University. A "great chasm of 
misunderstanding" has resulted from the "clash of alien cultures," 
Freedom Forum Chairman John Seigenthaler said. In its nine-month 
Bridging the Gap study, the center surveyed and interviewed 
approximately 1,000 clergy, religion writers, and newspaper editors. 
Co-authors Jimmy Allen, Southern Baptist founder of the ACTS television 
network, and John Dart, religion writer for the Los Angeles Times, 
found that 92% of religion writers said religion is very or somewhat 
important in their lives; 72% of editors responded that religion is 
either very or somewhat important to them. When asked to identify their 
faith, only 4% of writers and 9% of editors indicated none. 
...Clergy overwhelmingly said news coverage of religion is "biased, 
unfairly negative, and too sensational." But just as "religious figures 
fear being misunderstood, journalists fear making mistakes and 
incurring religious wrath." The cardinal sins of the print medium, the 
co-authors said, are a refusal to take religion seriously, a lack of 
well-informed reporters, and intellectual laziness about getting facts 
straight. TV coverage too often lets its time constraints and 
entertainment priorities override in-depth religious reporting. 
Television reporters also focus almost exclusively on scandals and 
religious pageantry, they said. 
..."Good journalism and good religion ought not to be enemies," Allen 
said. Clergy can help by learning what journalists find newsworthy, and 
by keeping themselves accessible to the media. They should also provide 
clarifications or request retractions for inaccuracies. Journalists, in 
turn, should take at least one religion course in their training, and 
should be allowed to participate in religious seminars and groups, the 
report concluded. 

Southern Baptist Convention President Ed Young will pay $60,000 in back 
property taxes. The Houston Chronicle reported Sept. 1 that the 10-year 
tax bill is owed on Young's $600,000 home. Second Baptist Church, which 
Young pastors, owned the parsonage in 1979, but has been transferring 
ownership incrementally to him since then. The church erroneously paid 
full property taxes on the parsonage until 1983, when it was granted 
the tax exemption it requested. The church then, however, failed to 
note Young's share of the ownership, which has increased by 
one-fifteenth each of the last 14 years. Attorney Lynn Carter, chairman 
of the deacons, said there is no delinquency since Young received no 
bills for overdue taxes. Penalties are unlikely, although interest 
could be assessed at 1% per month, according to the Chronicle. Church 
officials say the situation was the result of a mistake, not a 
conscious effort to avoid paying taxes. Each week 350,000 homes are 
reached for Christ, and by 1995 the number could be 500,000, said Dick 
Eastman, president of Every Home for Christ. EHC's first World Congress 
in 11 years drew 250 workers from 70 countries to Colorado Springs Aug. 
29-Sept. 3. After giving evangelism progress reports on their 
countries, the leaders planned how to bring their goals to fruition. 
They also "entered into covenants to continue the work," Eastman said. 
...EHC's national leaders are recruited to coordinate "distribution 
crusades" with local churches. To date, they have spread 1.8 billion 
gospel tracts in 147 nations. Within each tract is a response card to 
request information about Bible correspondence courses, local churches, 
and Christianity. These efforts led to the formation of 15,000 Christ 
Groups, or "baby churches," where none existed before. Eastman told 
NIRR he was hopeful that increased cooperation between international 
ministries would lead to crusades in every nation by the year 2000. He 
also credited God's divine timing in opening "campaigns in countries 
that three years ago would have been impossible." 
...For example, in Nepal, Christians were jailed and beaten just two 
years ago. Now they can distribute gospel tracts from village to 
village. According to EHC's Solon Karthak, 45% of the mostly Hindu 
country has been evangelized, largely by Nepalese church volunteers, 
but also by Christian businessmen, engineers, and missionaries from 
India, Europe, and the United States. Christians face little danger or 
fear of reprisal, he said. Churches are growing, and many focus on 
worship and praise. Since medicine is scarce, physical healing also is 
emphasized as evidence of God's power. Karthak also reported that Nepal 
has its first Christian magazine. 
...India's newly planted village churches are "bursting at the seams" 
with new converts, said EHC Regional Director B.A.G. Prasad. About 500 
churches are planted each month, and various groups plant 15 every day. 
He said 28 Christian organizations are working together on the new 
global project to plant 5,000 missionaries by the year 2000. As a 
result of cooperation and an "enormous volume of prayer," EHC-India 
staff and Prasad reported supernatural healings and miracles, "positive 
proof of God's presence going before us and blessing the efforts." 
...In Sri Lanka, many Buddhist monks have "given their lives to the 
Lord," reported Sam Thevabalasingham, EHC's director there. Many have 
completed Bible correspondence courses, and are pastoring small village 
churches near the same temples where they used to worship Buddha. Their 
witness is having "great impact," he said. 
...Many former Soviet people "have Christian hearts, but Communist 
minds," according to regional director Paul Ilyin. He said 7 million 
homes in four republics have been reached with Gospel literature, and 
EHC has received 500,000 responses since 1991. "If we had a pastor, we 
could start a church every day." Still, the "damage" from communism is 
widespread, and will require much work and prayer, he said. Youth 
especially are responding to the gospel (and to cults), and Russia's 
greatest needs are youth ministers, long-term missionaries, and 
well-printed Bibles. 
...Chinese Christians are arrested everyday for spreading the gospel, 
according to EHC's Enoch Tan. Christian literature is classified as 
anti-government propaganda, so individuals cannot respond to it without 
danger. Active Christians are under close surveillance by local 
communist party officials, so Christian foreigners or groups "cannot 
really do much in helping the Chinese Christians catch and fulfill the 
Great Commission," Tan said. Still, the Chinese want to know about life 
outside of China, "and about the Book and the man called Jesus." EHC 
estimates China has 800,000 Christians, more than 5,000 house churches, 
and that each month 80 new Christians are baptized in some areas. Tan 
also reported a distribution ministry is under way in Vietnam, 
Cambodia, and Malaysia. 
...Homelessness is a growing problem for ministries in Africa. Nearly 
5.7 million Africans have been driven from their home countries by 
either war or hunger, and roughly 17 million have been displaced within 
their own borders, EHC Anglo-Africa Director Fred Creighton said. He 
said many of EHC's directors themselves have had to flee their 
countries because of persecution, ethnic cleansing, or war. But 
Creighton also said Africa is tremendously receptive to the gospel. In 
Zambia, declared a Christian nation in 1991, Waddy Shibemba said, 
"We're even having to ration our gospel tracts, they are going so 
fast." Ghana's Director Karl Menyah organized several three-day prayer 
and fasting conferences that "created widespread opportunities to 
minister." And in South Africa, "Apartheid is ending because people are 
praying, not because they're negotiating," EHC's Hennie Hanekom said. 
...Greece has only 9,000 evangelical Christians in its population of 10 
million, George Gounaris told NIRR. Greece's 150 evangelical churches 
are served by only 20 full-time paid pastors from various 
denominations. In visiting the churches, he found that many are without 
"prayer support, basic tools, and materials" to reach people. Gounaris 
cited two reasons for the lack of evangelicals in Greece: the strength 
of the Greek Orthodox Church, and a Greek law that forbids 
proselytizing. Since foreign missionaries "cannot be successful in 
Greece," he said, "our people must hear the message from their own. But 
if we can support local believers, we can reach the whole country." 
..."The relationship of prayer and evangelism is inseparable," Eastman 
told the EHC directors. Within the next few years, EHC hopes to 
complete its Jericho Center, a 24-hour prayer hub for world missions.

Vol. 7, No. 19                                                     
September 6, 1993 

"There has not been such grotesque bigotry since the days of black and 
white drinking fountains in the 1950s," said the lawyer for Eugene 
Lumpkin. The San Francisco minister was dismissed from the city's Human 
Rights Commission after expressing his viewpoints on the Bible and 
homosexuality. "They are saying there is no room for anyone who holds 
traditional religious beliefs. It is appalling," Rutherford Institute 
attorney Brad Dacus told NIRR. 
...Although Lumpkin had voted on the commission in support of 
homosexual rights and causes, activist groups and the Board of 
Supervisors had pressed for his dismissal for some time. Earlier 
Lumpkin had told the San Francisco Chronicle that, according to the 
Bible, "the homosexual lifestyle is an abomination against God." 
Initially, Mayor Frank Jordan stood with Lumpkin, who is black, and 
pastors Ebenezer Baptist Church in Haight-Ashbury. Mayoral spokesman 
Noah Griffin said Jordan considered the pastor's First Amendment 
rights, and that to push the issue would do little to heal the rift 
between the city's African-American and gay communities. 
...But Jordan said he had no choice but to fire Lumpkin after an 
appearance on a KTVU talk show. When the host pushed Lumpkin to express 
whether he believed biblical passages in Leviticus called for the 
stoning of men who have sex with other men, the pastor said, "Sure, I 
believe it. I believe everything in the Bible." Lumpkin later told the 
Chronicle he had been misunderstood, and that the execution method was 
an ancient law, not his personal belief. He said he does not advocate 
violence or gay-bashing on biblical grounds, as some maintained. 
...Lumpkin's failure to disavow potential violence was his 
"prerogative, but not when he represents the mayor," Griffin told NIRR. 
Griffin also insisted Jordan was not coerced into firing Lumpkin. 
"They've been friends for 20 years. If he was caving in to political 
pressure, he wouldn't have stood by him in the first place," he said. 

A Colorado Springs Baptist pastor and his church are being sued for 
baptizing five children. According to the Rocky Mountain News, attorney 
Ed Farry, Jr., filed suit against Dean Miller and the 1,000-member 
Cornerstone Baptist Bible Church. The parents allege their children 
were lured to a May 1 church carnival, coerced into changing into 
baptismal robes, and then were immersed in a Plexiglas tank. 
...Of the charges raised, Farry said, "Forcing the children to disrobe, 
we believe, is outrageous [conduct]. We believe dunking them is an 
offensive touching, and that is battery. We believe enticing them with 
a carnival, then making them go into a small room and be baptized 
before letting them go, is imprisonment." The suit also claims the 
church was negligent, and interfered with the parents' rights to 
"instill their own family values." 
...The newspaper quoted Miller as denying the church baptized the 
children without parental permission, and as saying that his church 
distributed flyers and told parents of the carnival and the baptisms. 
Miller told NIRR, "I've never talked with anyone from the Rocky 
Mountain News." The paper said some children told their parents a 
minister had "told them they would be killed by bee stings if they 
weren't baptized." 
...A bee illustration was used during a Children's Church meeting to 
teach how Christ "took the sting out of death for us all," Miller said. 
Cornerstone's bus ministry, which requests parental consent for 
children who come, advertised its regular weekly children's meeting as 
featuring carnival-like games and a huge water fight. The pastor said 
nothing in the bee analogy mentioned baptism, although a flyer for the 
meeting lists the bus ministry's four goals, which were presenting the 
Gospel, leading participants to Christ, baptizing new believers, and 
grounding them in a local church. 
...Miller said the church's defense attorney from the Ohio-based 
Christian Law Association is confident of winning the case. He told 
NIRR, "Simply, we don't have to worry about the court situation because 
there's no truth" to the allegations. Although the congregation is 
"grieved," it is responding positively, Miller said, because "they know 
we were attacked wrongly," and "have been prepared for such 
opposition." 
...An "SOB, an illegitimate b------, a cultist, and a scumbag who 
deserves to fry because of what [he] did to those kids" was what Miller 
said two radio talk-show hosts called him when he was interviewed live 
on their national programs. "Even the people who called in agreed with 
the disc jockeys for calling me those names." He told NIRR he never 
dreamed society looked at gospel preachers in such a negative way. "I 
thought we were respected for maintaining values in the land." 

"The fact that we have freedom of religion doesn't mean we need to try 
to have freedom from religion," President Bill Clinton told 250 
religious leaders at a White House prayer breakfast last Monday. Guests 
represented a variety of denominations, world faiths, ecumenical 
coalitions, Christian periodicals, and parachurch groups. He said that 
people of faith should admit that their beliefs influence their 
convictions, feelings, thoughts, and actions, but Americans must 
approach their religions "with a certain amount of humility." He urged 
against equating a personal assurance that "God is on our side" with 
belief that He is "therefore against our opponent." Clinton also 
supported the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which is stalled in 
the Senate. Saying he had considered the issues while on vacation, 
Clinton told the leaders, "Sometimes I think the environment in which 
[political leaders] operate is entirely too secular," and said some of 
society's problems were unlikely to be solved by sheerly secular 
approaches. 

The Christian Coalition tops the list of influential religious right 
groups, says Skipp Porteous of the Institute for First Amendment 
Studies (NIRR 9/9/91), an information clearinghouse on Christian 
socio-political movements, in Great Barrington, Mass. Of the 22,000 
leaders and groups in IFAS' database, "they concern us the very most," 
Porteous said of the group established by Pat Robertson. "They have 
great organizational abilities, and claim to be growing at 10,000 
members a week, though a lot of chapters are falling apart," Porteous 
told NIRR. CC Executive Director Ralph Reed says the group will be 
widening its focus to include more economic concerns, and noted the 
group has names of 350,000 activists and 400,000 contributors, and 
would likely raise $12-14 million this year. 
..."If people like Pat Robertson came to power, they would impose 
draconian measures, quick-fix solutions for very complicated problems," 
said Porteous, a former Pentecostal minister. He has nothing against 
Christians, or their running for office, but doesn't think "imposing 
values is the answer." He told NIRR, "Most Christian Americans are not 
extreme. I don't feel the religious right represents mainstream 
Christian America." 
...Porteous also expressed concern about James Dobson's Focus on the 
Family. The organization "claims to be religious, but is very much 
political," he said. In IFAS' guide to grass-roots opposition, 
Challenging the Christian Right: The Activist's Handbook, Focus is 
described as "well-entrenched and extremely popular," and "ahead of 
most Christian Right groups in the development of a loyal, if 
unwitting, political constituency." 
...Rounding out IFAS' Christian Right top 10 are, in alphabetical 
order, the American Family Association, Chalcedon, Coalition on 
Revival, Concerned Women for America, Free Congress Foundation, 
National Association of Christian Educators/Citizens for Excellence in 
Education, Operation Rescue, and Traditional Values Coalition. "Other 
groups worth noting," IFAS reports, include the Christian Action 
Network, Christian Advocates Serving Evangelism, Eagle Forum, Oregon 
Citizen's Alliance, The Report, Rutherford Institute, and Strategic 
Christian Services. 

"Nothing short of outrageous" -- that's how Pat Robertson described 
allegations of unethical behavior over the establishment of a 
for-profit company with non-profit funds. The Virginian-Pilot and 
Ledger-Star reported that the Christian Broadcasting Network used $2.8 
million of ministry monies on KaloVita, a cosmetics and vitamins 
company that sells Sea of Galilee skin care products and The American 
Whey nutritional supplements. CBN and Robertson each own half the firm, 
which also goes by the names American Benefits Plus and American Sales 
Corp. 
...The arrangement raised red flags with non-profit watchdog groups. 
Robertson told the newspaper he became a co-owner in the company to 
"keep it alive" and protect the ministry's interests. He personally has 
lost money in the deal, he said, and denied charges that his 
involvement was a conflict of interests. Since its founding in 1990, 
the profit-making arm has lost more than $4 million. 
...The company is expected to turn a profit this fall, then all CBN 
funds will be reimbursed, Robertson said. Attorney Gordon Robertson, a 
KaloVita board member, said the goal is to set up several profit-making 
enterprises that will generate long-term funding for CBN, especially 
after his father is no longer at the helm. 
...CBN's attorneys acknowledged that the Internal Revenue Service has 
been reviewing the ministry's taxes, but the lawyers said the ministry 
was on firm legal footing. Earlier this year, the IRS indicated it had 
targeted more than 10 television ministries for investigation, but 
declined to name them. Some speculate that because Robertson did not 
inform donors that CBN spent the money on KaloVita, the IRS grew 
suspicious. The company paid Robertson no salary, although it did pay 
him $38,600 last year for speeches and media endorsements. CBN 
spokesmen were not available for comment. 
...The Salem Radio Network has acquired the rights to all CBN Radio 
Network operations. The deal gives Salem talk, commentary, 
entertainment, and public affairs programs, musical specials, and 
hourly newscasts. In addition to joining the CBN Radio's 200 stations, 
Salem adds two CBN SpaceCom satellite channels. The deal also will 
allow Broadcast Equities, CBN Radio's former parent company, to focus 
its resources on news programming. 

On Aug. 27, Russian legislators backed even stronger restrictions on 
foreign missionary groups and native churches than they did with their 
first passage of amendments to the Law on Freedom of Conscience and 
Religion (NIRR 8/23), news sources reported. Although President Boris 
Yeltsin expressed some agreement with points in the document passed 
July 14, he deferred his approval until the law better met with 
international human rights standards. Members of the largely hardline 
Supreme Soviet countered his suggested changes with their own tougher 
stance. 
...The newest amendments give state support to "the traditional 
confessions of Russia," namely the Russian Orthodox Church, which 
encouraged the new measures. First debated Aug. 20, the changes also 
move to confine foreigners primarily to churches specifically 
established by and for foreigners, Russian expert Peter Deyneka told 
News Network International (NNI). Foreigners could work with Russian 
Christians, but only in activities approved by the Russian government. 
Officials could shut down churches for various reasons. Even native 
religious minorities might lose legal protection since many churches 
remained unregistered under the original religious freedom law, Lauren 
Homer, an attorney who works with Western religious groups that have 
Russian operations, told NNI. Administrative penalties or criminal 
charges could follow "coercion to attend or leave religious 
associations," Southern Baptist foreign missions sources indicated. In 
addition, foreign missionaries may not "offend the religious feelings" 
of Russians, and the Ministry of Justice would decide what groups 
receive permits to work in Russia. 
...As before, Western lawmakers and officials are urging the Russian 
president to veto the new religion law. Several Christian groups asked 
the Clinton administration to discuss the situation with Russian Prime 
Minister Victor Chernomyrdin at a meeting with Vice President Al Gore. 
Although the measures can take effect without his signature, Yeltsin's 
veto would force further action. It is uncertain when the law will be 
enacted. 

Sudan's renewed bombing in Western Equatoria is displacing tens of 
thousands of refugees, the New Sudan Council of Churches reported in 
August. NSCC and other church leaders in southern Sudan issued a 
statement of concern. They say the Khartoum government of the north, 
composed primarily Arab Muslims, continues to terrorize the 
predominantly black, Christian, and animist south. The result may be a 
mass exodus into Uganda, about 10 miles away from the bombing sites. 
About 100,000 refugees already have crossed the border because of 
fighting between factions of the Sudan People's Liberation Army and 
against government forces. Most of those who fled to Uganda earlier had 
been displaced to camps run by the United Nations, a UN official said. 
The refugees in Uganda, the NSCC statement said, need food and shelter, 
especially since more refugees are on the way. 
...The U.S. State Department believes Iran is contributing to the 
Muslim persecution of Christians in Sudan. According to the National 
Association of Evangelicals, the Khartoum government plans to resettle 
Christians from the south to the militantly Islamic north, where Muslim 
law strictly governs education and worship of all kinds. Both the U.S. 
and Egyptian governments have alleged that the Iranian government has 
been backing and training Muslims in Sudan in hopes of spreading 
militant Islam into more moderate Arab states. Both Sudan and Iran deny 
these allegations. Washington added Sudan to its list of terrorist 
states last month. 
...Reportedly 1.5 million people are on the verge of starvation as the 
cumulative effects mount from nearly three decades of civil war. On 
Aug. 19, Samaritan's Purse, a Boone, N.C.-based relief agency, 
announced plans to send a six-person medical team to Sudan. The workers 
will fight an epidemic of relapsing fever said to be claiming 200 lives 
per day. "We can't help everybody, but we're going to do what we can," 
said Franklin Graham, SP's president. 
...Relief efforts are routinely blocked, however, according to a 
Sydney, Australia, relief agency official. Graham Romanes of Community 
Aid Abroad said Sudanese officials blocked relief to half a million 
people in the Nuba mountain region for the past year, according to the 
Reuters news agency. "This [famine] is becoming larger than Somalia and 
much bigger than Ethiopia was in 1984 and 1985," he added. Romanes said 
the government ordered the closing of CAA's office in Nyala last month, 
as well as a relief agency jointly run by Christians and Muslims. 

In Albania, once called Europe's most secular state, 70% of university 
students believe in God, according to a survey conducted by state 
universities in Tirana and Shkoder. Most of Albania's 3.3 million 
inhabitants claim some religious affiliation: Muslims, 65%; Orthodox, 
18%; and Catholics, 12%. The National Catholic Register cited a Vatican 
Radio report on the survey, which also found 84% of Albanian students 
oppose religious discrimination. 

A movie or TV screen can draw a bigger crowd in rural India than an 
American evangelist preaching live, according to Indian pastor C.D. 
Jebasingh, president of Galilean International Films and Television 
Service. His partner uses Tom and Jerry cartoons to draw a crowd. Then 
he turns down the sound and ad-libs his own evangelistic message over a 
megaphone. "When my wife and I stayed in a convent in India, the nuns 
would roll a TV set outside on Saturday nights, and 100 people would 
come to see whatever was on it," Ralph Budelman of Pasadena's U.S. 
Center for World Mission told NIRR. They spoke at the Second Annual 
Forum on New Media Strategies for India, held at William Carey 
International University in Pasadena, Calif. Jebasingh and Budelman 
coordinated the forum with C. Ray Carlson, president of International 
Films, Inc., in Pasadena. Twenty-five Christian missions leaders 
discussed present and future use of visual media in India. They 
concluded that they can take all the donated 16mm Christian films they 
can get. They appealed for Christian producers and ministries to send 
used or excess films to Carlson's office. (P.O. Box 40400, Pasadena, CA 
91114.) 
...The Gospel is getting regular exposure on Indian national television 
on Christian holy days, according to AD 2000 Global Monitor. Several 
short Christian documentaries, musical films, and dramas produced by 
Sheila Samuel and her India-based Samuel Video have aired on Christmas, 
Good Friday, and Easter for the past three years. The newsletter 
reported that "tens of millions, possibly hundreds of millions, of 
Indians have been evangelized through these broadcasts -- they have 
heard and seen the gospel, and had an adequate opportunity to respond 
to it." 

The 1893 World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago was the event most 
responsible for introducing Buddhism and other non-Christian religions 
into the United States, according to James Stephens, director of the 
Sonrise Center for Buddhist Studies in Sierra Madre, Calif. Recent 
study of Buddhist documents reveals that Eastern philosophies and even 
the architecture at accompanying Columbian Exposition profoundly 
affected many who attended. 
...Paul Carus, who owned Open Court Publishers, became so enamored with 
Buddhist teachings at the Parliament that he wrote The Gospel According 
to Buddha. Religious scholars name the book as a key contributing 
factor in the spread of Buddhist philosophy. Carus also funded the 
writings of D.T. Suzuki, a famous Zen scholar, to help propagate 
Buddhism in America. Stephens told NIRR that Open Court's current 
"catalog is distinctly full of philosophical material that would be 
considered incompatible with a Christian worldview," he said. 
...Buddhism played an important role at the Second Parliament of the 
World's Religions, which began in Chicago Aug. 28 with the goal of 
"fostering understanding among world faiths." The PWR was to declare a 
global ethic, and conclude Sept. 5 with a lecture by the Dalai Lama, 
the exiled Buddhist who is Tibet's spiritual leader. Stephens told NIRR 
that Sonrise's employees "attended to gather additional research about 
current Buddhist movements around the world, but we were also convinced 
that a Christian response was essential and that this provided a unique 
opportunity for us." He said since 48% of all immigrants today are from 
Asia, Christians have an increasing responsibility to develop a 
theology of world missions. He cited the frequent inadequacy of 
believers to deal with the presence of world religions in America, and 
questioned whether Christians will be prepared to meet the challenges 
of religious pluralism that the Parliament encouraged. 

"The only people helping us are `snakeheads' -- and Christians," 
Chinese children smuggled to the United States told Pastor David Lee, a 
Hong Kong-born social worker with the Chinatown Service Center in 
Southern California. Snakeheads are smugglers who work with an Asian 
crime syndicate to transport Chinese hoping to escape to better lives. 
Among the recent boatloads of refugees have been at least 160 minors, 
many whose parents promised the smugglers about $30,000 so their 
children could avoid the hardships of life in China. 
...Packed 300 to a boat, under unsanitary conditions, most refugees 
became sick, Lee said. Sometimes the girls were forced to sleep with 
the crew to get enough food. Police found some of the Chinese, 
completely out of food and water, huddled under the Golden Gate Bridge 
in May. Others were caught aboard ship. 
...Approximately 80 children have been detained in juvenile halls for 
about four months while they wait for relatives to claim them or for 
the courts to grant them political asylum. "They are kept in cells. 
Their parents are far away. They aren't used to the food. They must 
sign forms they can't read, so they are forced to rely on lawyers sent 
in by snakeheads," Lee told NIRR. Depression, frustration, and shock 
characterize the children, Lee said. 
...Five Chinese churches are working with the children, including Lee's 
Conservative Baptist Chinese Church. Members regularly visit the 
children, some as young as 11, in groups of three to four. "We bring 
them Chinese food, and help them fill out the forms," Lee said. "We 
teach them prayers and Christian songs, and give them Bibles in simple 
Chinese." 

"I believe Jesus Christ told them to do it," Chinese immigrant Liu 
Jiang told reporters who asked why U.S. immigration officials granted 
him an asylum hearing. Of the 658 Chinese immigrants smuggled to the 
United States on three ships, Liu was the only one granted a formal 
hearing. The others were returned to China. Lui was sent by helicopter 
to an immigration detention center in San Pedro, Calif. 
..."I really feel that coming to America is just like going to heaven," 
said Liu, a 22-year-old teacher. He said when he began to seek converts 
in his small village in Fujian Province, he was threatened with arrest, 
which prompted him to leave China. During the escape voyage, Liu said 
other immigrants tormented, mocked, and beat him. They also threw his 
Bible into the ocean. 
...Liu hopes American Christians will help him find employment and 
teach him more about his faith. He acknowledges having only a 
superficial understanding of Christianity, but wants to learn more so 
he can return to China to teach others some day. Liu's attorney, Helen 
Sklar, told NIRR that claims of religious persecution are rare among 
the smuggled Chinese. Liu's hearing date has not been set, she said. 

Chinese population-control policies have some refugees seeking asylum, 
reports The Age, a Melbourne, Australia, newspaper. Democracy 
supporters Li-li, 29, and her fiance Gu Guo Rui, 38, bribed shipping 
officials to let them escape Shanghai. Li-li became pregnant after 
arriving in Australia, and feared reprisals under China's one-child 
policy. Guo Rui has a child from a previous marriage, and having a 
second child is considered "political defiance." Guo Rui says 
authorities in rural China "catch pregnant women like they catch pigs," 
and drag them to the "hospital" for forced abortions, even in the last 
months of pregnancy. Li-li has had her baby, but awaits a federal court 
ruling on a class action suit, filed on behalf of 700 asylum-seekers, 
against the Minister for Immigration. 
...Australia's leading pro-life legislator, Sen. Brian Harradine, 
successfully argued for another couple, Luo Hai Ling, 22, and Chou Feng 
De, 27, who sought asylum in Australia in order to have a second child. 
While facing deportation with 56 others, Hai Ling found herself 
pregnant, and appealed to the Catholic Archbishop of Perth. If forced 
to return to China, she too feared coercive abortion, sterilization, 
and imprisonment or fines. Australian officials deny that her pregnancy 
was the reason the couple was granted asylum. 

Since men disguise, but harbor, real guilt from allowing or encouraging 
abortions, CareNet began Bible studies this month to help them deal 
with their shame. The 10- to 12-week-long Bible studies, believed to be 
the first of their kind, will delve into that pain to encourage 
forgiveness and healing. The men's grief "many times is a lot deeper 
and harder to pull out," said Cheryl Jakubowski of the Washington-area 
Christian Action Council, which sponsors CareNet's nationwide network 
of 450 pregnancy care centers. These men sometimes "feel less than a 
man" because "they have given permission for killing their own 
children," she told NIRR. "If you believe men are supposed to be 
protectors and providers, what does it say to any man who could not 
protect and provide for his child?" Men who have paid for abortions or 
have coerced women in any way to have them share the same feelings of 
guilt, she said. 
...The men's study grew from a similar post-abortive women's course by 
Linda Cochran, a psychiatric nurse from Patterson, N.Y. She said that, 
even after having written the women's study, her anger prevented her 
from doing the same for men. "I didn't care whether men were healed or 
not," she told NIRR, until one evening, two men confronted her. They 
had been using the women's Bible study to seek healing, and the three 
"shared their confusion and anger and mistrust" until the barriers 
fell, said Cochran, who describes herself as post-abortive. "Just as I 
was a victim of believing a lie, they were too," she said. "Men are 
still, in a way, removed from their feelings about [abortion] because 
they are still believing it wasn't their decision, their choice." 
..."When men start getting healed, it is going to be really exciting. 
It is almost like they will be getting their voices back," Jakubowski 
said. "God is doing something in his Kingdom." 

The pastor is pro-life. His parishioner is a nationally known abortion 
provider. But the shooting of George Tiller, allegedly by an abortion 
foe, has not yet polarized Wichita's Reformation Lutheran Church (NIRR 
9/9/91). "We are humble before God on the subject of abortion," pastor 
Joel Thomas Schmalz told NIRR. "The church has members of every 
viewpoint. By and large, the church makes a strong effort to work 
together." 
...The church has been picketed because of Tiller's attendance. As one 
of the few U.S. doctors who will perform late-term abortions, he was 
the prime target of Operation Rescue's 1991 protests in Wichita (NIRR 
7/29/91). But Schmalz, who says he presents classic Lutheran doctrines 
in a thought-provoking way, said Tiller "listens very carefully" and 
considers others' positions, and often participates in the adult 
discussion forums the church holds. "The word of God carries with it 
its own power, and then change comes as the work of the Holy Spirit," 
Schmalz said. 
...Tiller "seeks to practice medicine in a way that is lawful, moral, 
ethical, and spiritual," his pastor told NIRR. He said Tiller takes a 
personal interest in his patients, and "on numerous occasions he and 
his wife have taken into their home a woman who is ambivalent or 
regretful about her abortion decision," he said. "No pastor knows the 
inner workings of members of the church. God is still in charge." 
...Held on $1 million bail for Tiller's shooting is abortion protester 
Rachelle "Shelley" Shannon, a homemaker from Grants Pass, Ore. 
Shannon's former pastor, H. Vern Shipley of Wesleyan Church in Medford, 
said Shannon had dedicated herself to pro-life activism. "She became 
more obsessed with the idea than what I felt was good," he told NIRR. 
He said the church was accepting, but not all members agreed with her. 
Shipley said the conservative evangelical church did not subsidize her 
frequent attendance at protests organized by Operation Rescue or 
Advocates for Life, a ministry based in Portland, Ore. Shipley said 
violence "would be very much out of character for the Shelley we knew." 
But the Pensacola (Fla.) News Journal indicated that, in the last few 
months, Shannon had written 25 admiring letters to Michael Griffin, who 
stands trial this month for the murder of abortionist David Gunn (NIRR 
3/22). She reportedly called him a great hero, and said, "I pray God 
will raise up more like you." 
...Most of the largest groups opposing abortion, including Operation 
Rescue, denounced Tiller's shooting. They described the act as 
unjustifiable, inappropriately violent, the work of one person, and a 
deterrence to progress to protect the unborn. Some criticized the media 
for focusing on pro-life groups that condoned the crime. 
..."We believe abortion is murder. The same rules apply to stopping 
Tiller as if [Shannon] were trying to stop a murder," Advocates for 
Life leader Andrew Burnett told NIRR. Abortionists have "to have built 
up a monstrous denial or justification system" to do what they do. 
Though they may "have the best intent in the world, but if you are 
doing something that's wrong, it's still wrong," he said. 
...The Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights said Tiller's motivation 
is based on his faith. "Some people can't understand that there are 
people who are pro-choice because of religious beliefs, not in spite of 
them," RCAR spokesman Jay Heavner told NIRR. Advocates of abortion 
rights say violent incidents like the Tiller shooting and Gunn murder 
underscore the need for Congress to pass the pending bill that would 
make it a federal crime to obstruct the entrance to a clinic. 

Arrested: Keith Tucci. Wichita police removed the Operation Rescue 
national executive director from Tabernacle Baptist Church, where U.S. 
Attorney General Janet Reno was meeting with clergy, community leaders, 
and law enforcement officials at a drugs-gangs discussion. Tucci, who 
was not invited to the meetings, was arrested on outstanding warrants 
related to 1991 protests in the city, police said. According to news 
sources, Tucci and other OR leaders have unsuccessfully sought to meet 
with Reno to discuss the administration's abortion policy. 

Two court decisions involving the Christian Science Church may trouble 
faiths that heal primarily with prayer. Because evidence was improperly 
withheld from the jury, a Massachusetts appeals court overturned the 
involuntary manslaughter conviction of David and Ginger Twitchell. 
Their 2-year-old son, Robyn, died in 1986 from a bowel obstruction 
after they tried to save him using spiritual healing alone. But the 
court insisted parents, regardless of religious faith, have a legal 
duty to provide medical care for gravely ill children, and ruled a 1971 
law exempting Christian Scientists from some child-neglect statutes is 
not a shield from criminal prosecution when a child dies. 
...$14.2 million was the award of a Minneapolis jury to Douglass 
Lundman, whose 11-year-old, Ian, died in a diabetic coma in 1989. Found 
guilty of wrongful death in the civil suit were the Christian Science 
Church and six of its practitioners, including Ian's mother, Kathleen 
McKown, who relied only on prayer to heal him. McKown did not know of 
her son's diabetes, but doctors testified that had Ian been diagnosed 
in time, he could have been saved. All convicted parties share 
responsibility for $5.2 million in damages, with Ian's mother 
accountable for 25%. Judge Sean Rice assessed the Boston-based church 
alone an additional $9 million in punitive damages. 
..."This is a very difficult time for Christian Scientists. If they 
don't mobilize, their way of life is threatened," Stephen Lyons, the 
Twitchell's defense attorney, told NIRR. Cases generally pit the right 
to practice religious faith against the state's duty to protect 
children. As special interest groups debate the issues in court, 
"loving, caring and compassionate" people such as the Twichells "become 
pawns in a game of competing interests," Lyons said. 

Prayer was priority one for about 220 Christian leaders who gathered 
for the Northwest Prayer Summit in Portland, Ore., Aug. 19-22. 
Sponsored by the Lausanne Committee and Northwest Renewal Ministries, a 
division of Multnomah Bible College, the event drew selected leaders 
from major North American ministries, seminaries, mission agencies, and 
denominations. Before registering, Campus Crusade for Christ President 
Bill Bright confirmed that there would, in fact, be no speakers, 
workshops, or seminars, and that "nothing [was] planned but to come 
together to seek Christ," NRM spokesman Don Stern told NIRR. 
Participants, including 60 women and a small number of AfricanAmerican 
and Asian pastors, "broke into small groups to pray and share their 
hearts," Stern said. Praise and worship meetings complemented sessions 
marked by intercession, confession, and reconciliation. One Christian 
leader told Stern the summit was the "most God-controlled, and 
therefore, the most meaningful gathering in my 49 years of ministry." 
David Bryant of Minneapolis-based International Concerts of Prayer told 
NIRR, "Leaders and laypeople alike are beginning to realize that prayer 
is the fountainhead out of which everything else must flow." 

This year's See You at the Pole could further a fledgling "spiritual 
awakening among young people," said Paul Fleischmann, director of the 
sponsoring San Diego-based National Network of Youth Ministries. The 
Sept. 15 event is supported by numerous denominations and ministries. 
Organizers hope for an even larger turnout than last year at the 7 a.m. 
meeting, which drew more than 1 million students to prayer at public 
schools and colleges. 
...Every school in the country will know about this year's event. The 
Rutherford Institute and the American Center for Law and Justice sent 
letters and booklets to every secondary school principal, 
superintendent of schools, and state superintendent of schools to "let 
them know what students' rights are, what events will take place, and 
politely tell them they best not interfere," Jay Sekulow, chief counsel 
for the ACLJ, told NIRR. Rutherford has sought an injunction against 
Corpus Christi, Texas, schools, which last year reprimanded several 
high school students for participating. Although the board says it has 
changed its policy, attorney Kelly Shackleford said the legal maneuver 
was additional assurance that "they, in fact, will not interfere." He 
told NIRR, "We're going to make sure the kids won't have to pray in 
fear." 
...But "we don't want to take it out of the hands of the kids," Doug 
Clark of the National Network of Youth Ministries told NIRR. He said 
See You at the Pole remains "student-initiated and student-led." In 
addition to increased U.S. participation, thousands more Canadian 
students have been urged to join by Vision 2000, a coalition of 90 
Christian organizations. See You at the Pole events have been added 
this year in South Africa, Japan, and Australia; they join related 
international gatherings scheduled for Mexico, Germany, Senegal, and 
Russia. 

O.S. Hawkins may end three years of turbulence at the Southern 
Baptists' largest congregation. On Aug. 29, he accepted the senior 
pastorate of First Baptist Church of Dallas. The church was stung last 
year, according to Baptist news services, when Joel Gregory abruptly 
resigned less than two years after accepting the position. Gregory said 
that 83-year-old pastor W.A. Criswell was not relinquishing leadership 
as promised (NIRR 10/19/92). Criswell has since retired, but preaches 
occasionally at the 28,000-member church. A 46-year-old native of Fort 
Worth, Hawkins has pastored the 10,000-member First Baptist Church of 
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for 15 years (NIRR 8/23). Hawkins assumes the 
new job Oct. 3, and brings with him a history of training lay 
evangelists and ministering to the poor. He was open to allowing 
Criswell, who has pastored the church for almost 50 years, to preach 
occasionally. 

A coup for followers of Wicca: a third-generation witch has taken a 
seat among the Salem (Mass.) Religious Leaders Association. Shawn 
Poirer, high priest of the Coven of the Black Rose, joined the 
inter-faith group last month. Marta Flanagan of the First Universalist 
Church became Poirer's main advocate to gain membership in the Salem 
Clergy Association, the SRLA's precursor that disbanded upon his 
admittance. Flanagan allows Poirer's coven to meet in her church's 
basement, although some Salem Wiccans meet at groves, the old town 
hall, homes, and beaches. 
..."People come and think it's a joke, and find out it's not a joke," 
Ken Stigler, pastor of Salem's Wesley Methodist Church, told NIRR. 
"People walk around town wearing black capes, with inverted crosses and 
pentagrams," Stigler said. Wiccans claim to have 4,000 followers in the 
city of 40,000. Others put the number much lower. 
..."Allowing Wicca the rule and rein of tourism in Salem has been 
unfortunate theologically and economically disastrous," Stigler said. 
Businesses may be intrigued by the idea of witches, but tend not to 
settle in town, he added. In Salem, famous for its 1692 witch trials, 
the town seal and promotional materials feature witchcraft symbols. 
..."People here are sick of it," said Joseph Kost, pastor of the 
non-denominational Christian Renewal Church. He told NIRR that 
Christians long remained silent "because the town was making money," 
but occultism "crept in because the door was open." Christian clergy 
will meet separately this month to pray and plan their church events. 

The convinced and the curious hoped to commune with the celestial at 
the first Angels and Nature Spirits Conference, held Aug. 15-22 in 
Angel Fire, N.M. "If you watch the news or pay too close attention to 
world affairs, it gives you a sense of `who is in control here?'" said 
Terry Lynn Taylor, conference coordinator and author of how-to guides 
for contacting and working with angels. 
..."Technology is not filling our souls with happiness. People are 
re-evaluating what this is really about. The angels are helping people 
have hope, letting us know there is another force," Taylor told NIRR. 
Among the other rarely seen nature spirits are gnomes, leprechauns, and 
genies. 
...The 55 attendees who paid $1,200 each included "traditional 
Catholics to very way-out thinkers," Taylor said. Presenters included 
Spiritual Church ministers, clairvoyants, psychics, aromatherapists, 
oracles, astrologers, tarot card readers, and healers who cure with 
tuning forks and crystals. One woman "channeled" an age-old Himalayan 
spirit entity. New-Age musician Iasos coordinated "an evening of 
inter-dimensional games with local fairies, angels, and elementals as a 
fun way for humans to become acquainted with them in a mutually loving 
manner." 
...There is mounting anecdotal and circumstantial evidence for 
paranormal phenomena in general and angels in particular, said 
conference presenter John Ronner, a self-described angel investigator. 
Phenomena include many near-death experiences and visitations by a 
supernatural being, particularly among widows and widowers. Ronner, who 
has been studying angels since the 1970s, said he found Billy Graham's 
book on the subject interesting and helpful, but considered Graham's 
purpose too evangelical for him. 
...But you don't have to be religious to believe in angels, Taylor 
said. "A few people were atheists or agnostics who could never let go 
of their belief in angels," she said. "No one here is putting down 
religion. People are learning from one another's experiences with 
angels," Taylor said. "At this point in evolution, people are more able 
to accept the unseen, to have faith," she told NIRR, citing a Gallup 
poll that showed belief in angels growing (NIRR 2/8). "Angels are 
spiritual helpers who work in direct alignment with God for our 
spiritual well-being and understanding. They are not the forces we pray 
to, but intermediaries. God's in charge." 

Long-distance calling can contribute to God's calling, says Gary Black 
of Automated Communications, Inc. Two years ago, in an effort to help 
raise funds for various ministries, he founded TitheNet, a division of 
the long-distance carrier service, ACI. "I was asking the Lord how I 
could work in the corporate world, and help the church as well. We came 
up with TitheNet," he told NIRR from TitheNet's Colorado Springs 
headquarters. 
...The carrier is much like MCI or Sprint, except where these companies 
profit, TitheNet's "money goes back to the Kingdom" to a customer's 
designated church or ministry, Black said. "I am seeing these 
ministries blessed, and able to do things" such as building projects, 
church publications, youth ministries, and outreaches to the homeless, 
funded with monthly TitheNet checks. "Since so many organizations are 
struggling these days, this is a good way to help with funds while 
remaining maintenance free," Black said. He said the 100-member church 
he serves as a youth pastor receives $350 each month. TitheNet charges 
nothing to try its service, or to switch back if a customer desires. 
Black told NIRR that none of the service's 600 subscribers, which 
include individuals, several major ministries, Christian colleges, and 
churches, has been dissatisfied. 

Where can you find Christian mud flaps and a cross made from orange 
parking lights? At Truck-Stop Jesus, a 40-foot trailer that has been 
converted into a church in Ontario, Calif. Parked at a Unocal truck 
plaza off Interstate 10, it is one of 14 chapels run by Transport for 
Christ, International (TFC) across America. 
...Former trucker Jim Keys began TFC 42 years ago in Canada. He drove 
an old Nash to truck stops to show a film about big-rig safety and to 
talk about Jesus Christ. When he moved his headquarters to Denver, Pa., 
he assembled the first 18-wheel mobile chapel. When a truck-stop 
manager noticed a decline in prostitution and drug dealing when TFC 
trucks were there, he convinced the owner to request a permanent 
chapel. Converting a trailer into a chapel costs $15,000-$20,000, and 
expenses run another $8,000 per year. Chaplains raise their own 
support. 
...At Truck-Stop Jesus, visitors receive a Bible study that says "God 
is the perfect dispatcher" and truckers should be "haulin' the right 
load" if they want to spend eternity "at our heavenly terminal." 
Chaplain Ken Taylor, his wife, Martha, and several part-time assistants 
counsel walk-ins, screen inspirational videos, and provide friendly 
conversation. Daily services at California's only such chapel include 
hymn-singing, readings from "The Road Map of Life" (the New Testament), 
and a short sermon. 
..."Sometimes they see our lit cross and walk by seven or eight times 
before they come in," Taylor told NIRR. "But the Holy Spirit draws them 
and when they do come in, they're ready to be saved." The chapel has 
logged 90 decisions for Christ since opening in February, 1992. One 
motorist's engine would not start until he came into the chapel, where 
he accepted Jesus. "I don't know if it was coincidence or some kind of 
miracle," says Taylor, "but I believe God brought him in here." 
...By the end of the decade TFC hopes to have 100 U.S. chapels -- one 
every 250-500 miles -- so that truckers are never more than a half day 
away from a truck-stop church, according to spokesman Randy Fontaine. 
Nationwide, 200 people a month come through TFC chapels, and 2-4% 
receive Christ. TFC is one of 43 ministries that cater to 
tractor-trailer drivers, according to the Brownstown, Ill.-based 
Association of Christian Truckers.

...David Schroeder, former director of higher education for the 
Christian and Missionary Alliance, succeeds Rexford Boda as president 
of the denomination's Nyack College in New York. 
...Mississippi College President Lewis Nobles resigned nine months 
before his retirement amid charges that he embezzled $3 million from 
donors' contributions to the 4,000-student school. A civil lawsuit 
alleges that Nobles, once named one of America's most effective college 
presidents, deposited the money in secret personal bank accounts. 
Nobles told trustees that any monies spent were done so to benefit the 
college. He maintained to the Baptist Record that only one side of the 
controversy has been presented, and asked for patience "until the full 
story is out." A search committee has begun to seek Nobles' replacement 
as president. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Job moves: Diane Knippers 
was elected president of the Institute on Religion and Democracy, a 
conservative activist group in Washington that monitors religious 
liberty and involvement of religious institutions in public life. One 
of the few women to rise to head a high-profile evangelical ministry, 
she succeeds Kent Hill, who earlier this year assumed the presidency of 
Eastern Nazarene College in Massachusetts. 
...Commissioner Bramwell Tillsley succeeded General Eva Burrows as 
worldwide head of the Salvation Army for the next five years. Second in 
command since March 1991, Tillsley has served in the Army since the 
mid-1950s in leadership positions in North America, England, and 
Australia. He assumed his post in July. 
...David Tyler Scoates will become the first full-time director of 
Churches United in Global Mission. Robert Schuller, pastor of Crystal

very large churches, in 14 denominations. Scoates had been senior 
pastor of the 3,000-member Hennepin Avenue United Methodist Church in 
Minneapolis.

Association market. +WORLD REL/ Jewish Population US --MRH  8/30+ 
America's Jewish population is heading west and south. While New York 
state continues to have the largest Jewish population at 1,643,000, 
Califorinia ranks second with 920,000, and Florida is third with 
599,000, according to the new edition of the American Jewish Yearbook 
of the American Jewish Committee. The nation's 5.8 million Jews are 
showing increases of 1,000 to 2,000 people in various communities in 
Florida, Virginia, and North Carolina; decreases of similar magnitude 
have occurred in Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Ohio. 
The AJC estimates that Jews comprise approximately 2.3% of the total 
U.S. population. +MIN/ MEDIA/ TREND/ Black Chrs/ Rap Music 8-19-Lar+  
anger and disgust Hard-core rap lyrics are stirring a backlash among 
black Christians. African American pastors in several cities, including 
New York, Detroit, Dallas, and Los Angeles, have been reluctant to 
criticize a popular form of black expression. But "people are saying 
it's time. People are saying enough is enough," Rev. Calvin Butts 3rd, 
pastor of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church, told NIRR. He and other 
ministers have begun to challenge rap lyrics that they find obscene, 
misogynistic, or violent. "As Christians, we eschew violence, and we 
see sex as a redemptive relationship as opposed to an exploitive one," 
he said. Since society has throroughly disregarded traditional 
Christian values, he said, churches "especially must stand with the 
whole armor against the wiles of the devil." 
...One of Satan's "fiery darts," Butts said, is that rap music often 
distorts the realities of black life, and since rap sells well among 
white suburban youth, it reinforces racial stereotypes. Although the 
ministers oppose "negative lyrics in all music," he said they focus 
heavily on rap because of its current popularity, compelling beat, and 
powerful messages. Butts told NIRR that anti-christian forces use the 
musical media to their advantage under the disguise of First Amendment 
liberties. "We also have a First Amendment right to speak out against 
it," Butts told NIRR. In June, Butts led the bulldozing of rap records, 
CDs, and tapes in a New York City street, similar to his protest 
whitewashing of alcohol and cigarette billboard advertising. "Record 
companies will learn or they will lose money." of alcohol and cigarette 
billboard advertising. "Record companies will learn or they will lose 
money."

Vol. 7, No. 18                                                       
August 23, 1993 

While 46% of Americans feel a duty to communicate their faith with 
others, the rate is much higher among those whose beliefs categorize 
them as "born-again." The evangelistic mindset is present among 71% in 
the latter group, according to a 1993 poll by the Glendale, 
Calif.-based Barna Research Group. Among the tenets of those identified 
as born-again were a lasting personal commitment to Jesus Christ, 
acceptance of Christ as savior from their sins, and a belief that they 
will go to heaven when they die. 
...Pastors of the more-evangelistic denominations are more likely to 
perceive their parishioners as unprepared to share their faith than are 
pastors of less-evangelistic groups. Barna said 24% of Baptist pastors 
think their congregants are up to the task; 46% of mainline church 
pastors believe the same of their laypeople. 
...Personal evangelism is part of the creed for 62% of blacks, 44% of 
whites, and 32% of Hispanics in America. Evangelizers make up 54% of 
those who earn less than $20,000 a year, but only 34% of those with 
incomes over $60,000. Similarly, 54% of people without college 
education feel responsible to proselytize, while only 37% of college 
graduates do. Because Americans who are wealthy and educated have fewer 
evangelizers among their ranks, they are less likely to be evangelized 
by their peers, Barna concluded. 
...Only 31% of Catholics may be considered "evangelizers," compared 
with 57% of Protestants. Regarding the essence of the salvation 
message, 88% of Catholics and a majority of Presbyterian and Methodist 
evangelizers believe that "if people are generally good, or do enough 
good things for others during their lives, they will earn a place in 
heaven." Baptists, on the other hand, were much more likely to believe 
the classically Protestant "saved-by-gracealone" doctrine, with only 
27% of their evangelizers believing in salvation via good deeds. 

Romanian Orthodox priests are feeling threatened by American 
missionaries, say team members from a shortterm mission agency. 
Denver-based Mercy Ministry's Dan Plesha told NIRR that as evangelicals 
increase their work among Romanians, fewer of the people back the 
government or the church it sponsors. "Obviously, their power is 
weakened by such activity," he said. Plesha reported that one 
government priest interrupted "an event where we were working with 300 
orphans. He came into our meeting pointing in the direction of the 
Romanian Orthodox cathedral and screaming, `The real church is there. 
The real church is there.'" 
...Mercy Ministry's summer mission groups targeted several 
government-run orphanages, where a wide variety of abuses are common. 
The groups addressed the abuses from a biblical point of view, holding 
educational seminars on child development and providing medical 
instruction for staff workers. Plesha said Romania's greatest need is 
for long-term missionaries, who will help Romanian Christian leaders 
and retrain the orphanage caretakers. "Americans come for such a short 
time and then leave. It's like a band-aid solution. Romanians need to 
know that American Christians are serious about ministry, that we're 
not just dropping in to do seminars." 

Protests from Western and Russian Christians influenced Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin not to sign or veto controversial amendments to 
the country's 1991 religious freedom law, says Peter Deyneka of Russian 
Ministries in Wheaton, Ill. (NIRR 11/2/92). Deyneka and his wife, 
Anita, have spent six months in Moscow annually since the original law 
was passed, and have numerous contacts in the former Soviet Union. On 
Aug. 4, Gleb Yakunin (NIRR 3/23/92), an Orthodox priest and member of 
the Parliament, informed them of Yeltsin's decision (NIRR 8/9). 
...Yeltsin met Aug. 3 with Vyacheslav Polosin, the Orthodox 
priest-parliamentarian who chairs the Committee on Freedom of 
Conscience, which proposed the amendments. Moscow news reports indicate 
the Orthodox church and Russian nationalists pressured Yeltsin to sign 
the changes into law, but Western ministries, human-rights activists, 
and some democratic government leaders urged otherwise. Polosin, the 
law's leading proponent, has supported the regulations in numerous 
forums. In an Aug. 4 interview with the anti-Yeltsin newspaper Pravda, 
he indicated that Western religious groups show a holier-than-thou 
attitude by proselytizing; that their plan of action is to dwarf the 
Russian Orthodox's 10,000 congregations with 200,000 evangelical 
churches; that Americans plan to evangelize every public school; that 
many of the American preachers in Russia are immoral, criminal, greedy, 
or dishonest in using the ministry for trade and other financial gain; 
and that the West seeks to weaken Russia, its key competition, to 
strengthen itself. "The West simply is angry with our decision because 
we put an obstacle in the way of its ideological expansion," he told 
Pravda. 
...Article 14 is said to be the crux of the problem for both Yeltsin 
and Westerners. The point would require state accreditation and 
approval of a yet-unformed Russian organization on religion before any 
non-Russian citizen could "engage in religious-missionary, publishing, 
or advertising-propaganda activity." Yakunin told Deyneka that Yeltsin 
and his legal advisers reportedly revised the amendments to comply with 
international human-rights standards, and on Aug. 6 presented their 
proposed changes to Ruslan Khasbulatov, president of the Supreme 
Soviet. 
...The situation still is uncertain. During the Parliament's summer 
recess, Khasbulatov has recalled members for weekly meetings to 
consider several urgent issues, but Yakunin said the religious law may 
not be reconsidered for some time. Eventually, if the president and 
Parliament cannot reach agreement, the body likely will pass the law 
without Yeltsin's approval. Yakunin said he and other opponents would 
appeal to the constitutional court for repeal. Although Yeltsin seems 
to be "striving for a more democratic version," Deyneka said it is 
important to continue to pray and work with Russian religious believers 
to preserve their religious freedom. 

A California man says the American Red Cross denied him full 
certification as an AIDS counselor because of his Christian beliefs. 
Herbert Hall, a former homosexual and now a licensed minister, told 
NIRR that after completing a three-day counseling seminar in Santa Ana, 
Red Cross AIDS Coordinator Susan Sullivan told him she was afraid he 
might express his religious beliefs while counseling. Hall rejected her 
offer for provisional certification, which would have placed him under 
the organization's monitoring and supervision. 
...Hall, with the help of the Rutherford Institute, filed a complaint 
with the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. Hall 
said he is able and willing to follow Red Cross requirements to exclude 
religious beliefs from his discussions. Although he mentioned his faith 
during the class, he said he made a clearly non-religious final mock 
presentation and was applauded by classmates. Hall, who is 
HIV-positive, told NIRR the Red Cross decision made him angry, 
especially since he was the only one of 10 class members with any 
experience in AIDS education. Hall, who works with the Irvine-based He 
Intends Victory ministry to the HIV-infected, said he has presented 
AIDS talks for three years to clubs such as the Kiwanis and Lions. He 
also presents an abstinence program called Choices every week in local 
public schools. "I can't even mention my religion in public schools. If 
I did I wouldn't be let back in," he said. 
...Hall demonstrated an "inability to conduct training in an unbiased 
manner," Margaret McCarthy of the American Red Cross' national 
headquarters told NIRR. "It is very important that our instructors 
present only the facts without editorial comment," she said. "We cannot 
perform our job if we do it in a judgmental, biased fashion. We have to 
maintain public trust and support." McCarthy said Hall's training team 
evaluated his performance and concluded "that additional training was 
necessary before being given unconditional certification." Their 
consensus was that Hall "had difficulty presenting the material in a 
non-judgmental and factually accurate manner," McCarthy told NIRR. 
"Religious background has nothing to do with the ability to become an 
instructor." 
...Hall was clearly a victim of "inherent religious bigotry because of 
his religious affiliation," Rutherford Institute attorney Brad Dacus 
told NIRR. "Hall proved he had the ability and stated his willingness 
to withhold his religious beliefs," he said. Dacus called the incident 
"deophobia -- unreasonable hostility of people toward God." 

A resolution condemning homosexuality may lead to arts wars in suburban 
Atlanta. On Aug. 10, Cobb County commissioners passed 3-1 a resolution 
that government policymakers should not endorse gay and lesbian 
lifestyles because they are incompatible with community standards. 
Nearly 300 attended the meeting, which also was the first public 
hearing to discuss county arts funding, news sources reported. 
Productions in Marietta of two Broadway hits with homosexual themes, M. 
Butterfly and Lips Together, Teeth Apart, led to an outcry of protest 
within the generally conservative county. Although the proposed arts 
resolution does not specifically mention homosexuality, it calls for 
arts grants, which total $125,000 annually, to be judged by 
"family-oriented values." Georgia's American Civil Liberties Union 
chapter, the Atlanta Theater Coalition, Georgia Citizens for the Arts, 
and People for the American Way, as well as other arts and 
homosexual-rights advocates, decried what they called censorship, and 
threatened lawsuits if the commission approves the measures. A final 
public hearing and vote are scheduled for Aug. 24. 

Unlike other "religious right" groups, the Christian Action Network 
hasn't forgotten the NEA, according to Mary Anne Klink, congressional 
liaison for the National Endowment for the Arts. CAN continued its 
criticism of the federal arts agency when other conservative 
organizations focused on different issues, she said. 

...CAN encountered opposition over A Graphic Picture is Worth a 
Thousand Votes, a display in the Capitol of almost 20 controversial 
photographs by Albuquerque artist Joel-Peter Witkin. According to The 
Washington Post, last year Witkin received $20,000 in his fourth NEA 
visual arts fellowship grant. House Speaker Tom Foley (D-Wash.) and 
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) tried to block the day-long exhibit by 
saying Capitol rooms cannot be used for lobbying. Rep. Phil Crane 
(R-Ill.) countered their attempts by hosting the controversial exhibit 
in his office. Print media described in detail the photographs (which 
feature nudity and sexual organs, corpses, and some religious imagery), 
but one TV crew reported that it would have difficulty covering the 
story since the Federal Communications Commission would rule many of 
the works offensive or obscene, CAN reported. 
...The NEA recently suffered a 5% cut at the hands of a 
budget-conscious Congress. Several NEA-sponsored works, deemed 
inappropriate for federal funding, have drawn widespread criticism, and 
are said to have provided impetus for the congressional slash. The 
Forest, Va.-based CAN applauded the move as a promising start, but 
still says the government should "get out of the arts business once and 
for all." As evidence, CAN cited La Frontera/The Border. Two San Diego 
museums commissioned the piece of performance art, partially funded by 
the NEA, in which conceptual artists David Avalos, Louis Hock, and 
Elizabeth Sisco doled out $5,000 worth of $10 bills as an "art rebate" 
to immigrant day workers. CAN called the NEA "Rebategate" a "scandal" 
that is "literally throwing [taxpayers'] money away." The artists 
maintained that all the angry reactions to their grant money handout 
demonstrated the same anti-immigrant sentiment that motivated their 
work, the Los Angeles Times reported. 
...The NEA defended itself against CAN's criticisms by issuing Setting 
the Record Straight. The seven-page report said, for example, one 
exhibit the group condemned, Abject Art: Repulsion and Desire, at New 
York's Whitney Museum, was totally funded by private sources, but was 
credited for having inspired Congress to cut the NEA budget. Harvey 
Lichtenstein of the National Council for the Arts, the NEA's advisory 
panel, lamented that the agency had become "the whipping boys of 
Congress where we used to be the stars." 
...Award-winning actress Jane Alexander is President Bill Clinton's 
nominee to chair the NEA. The four-time Oscar nominee and winner of 
Emmy and Tony awards "brings a significant element of prestige to the 
position," said Rep. Sidney Yates (D-Ill.), head of the House 
Appropriations subcommittee. An activist in community service, 
Alexander, 53, has served on the boards of directors of Women's Action 
for Nuclear Disarmament, Wildlife Conservation International, and the 
National Stroke Association. Acknowledging the NEA's troubles, Clinton 
said "the endowment's mission of fostering and preserving our nation's 
cultural heritage is too important to remain mired in the problems of 
the past." CAN President Martin Mawyer promised to oppose the 
nomination, saying, "We certainly don't think someone who is beholden 
to the interests of Hollywood should be chairperson of the NEA." 

Has the late king of rock 'n' roll become a god? Not yet, but "what is 
now the Elvis cult could be nothing less than a religion in embryo," 
says Ted Harrison, former religion correspondent for the British 
Broadcasting Corp. In Elvis People: The Cult of the King, published by 
HarperCollins, Harrison documents the spiritual elements said to 
surround Presley's birth, life, death, and afterlife. Die-hard 
followers compare Presley to Christ, and some cite proofs of his 
divinity. Others who recognize his personal faith in Christ say he was 
a messenger from God. Thousands claim to have seen Elvis alive, or 
resurrected, since his 1977 death. Elvis impersonators are said to 
consider themselves part of a priesthood with a divine calling. Their 
costumes are vestments, and their actions part of a rite. Anything the 
entertainer touched, wore, or threw into a crowd serves as a relic, and 
Graceland is a shrine. On Aug. 16, the 16th anniversary of Presley's 
death, about 14,000 pilgrims trekked to the Memphis mansion to honor 
Elvis. 

It's not exactly rockin' rosary, but it isn't Gregorian chants either. 
The Rosary Tapes set the medieval meditation cycle of prayers to Jesus 
and devotions to Mary to contemporary music, backed by electric guitar 
riffs and wailing vocals. Bill Gildenstern of Saginaw, Mich., who 
co-wrote and performs on the three cassettes, says he loves the rosary 
and rock music. The former Detroit disc jockey, known in the 1970s as 
Bill Gibson, says the two create a powerful combination. "We've gotten 
letters from people saying the music is beautiful, that they cried." 
Other listeners say the tapes can be used when it is inconvenient to 
finger the beads in the usual manner, for example, when driving. 
Gildenstern, 47, who owns an audio production house, said he asked God, 
"What do you want me to do?" This was His answer, he told NIRR. 
...Gildenstern acknowledges some risk of offending traditional 
Catholics, who could consider the music sacrilegious. But he downplays 
the possibility, since the songs are love songs. "It's not rock 'n' 
roll," he told NIRR. Thousands of tapes have been sold through mail 
orders. Ave Marie Press, a non-profit publisher at the University of 
Notre Dame, will begin distributing the tapes to about 2,000 religious 
bookstores nationwide next month. 

The Catholic world came to Denver for World Youth Day Aug. 10-15. 
Almost 200,000 pilgrims from 75 countries participated in the 
Vatican-sponsored event, the backdrop for Pope John Paul II's third 
U.S. visit. At sites all over the city, pilgrims attended workshops, 
masses, concerts, prayer vigils, seminars, cultural celebrations, and 
worship services, all revolving around WYD's John 10:10 theme: "I have 
come that you may have life abundantly."  "Choose Life, Choose Christ" 
was the theme for the International Youth Forum that drew 250 Catholics 
from 70 countries to Denver three days before World Youth Day began. 
The delegates, ages 15-35, were selected to represent their country's 
youth, and to report on specific challenges and trends in the faith of 
their peers back home. 
...Delegates were not very concerned with "American" issues such as 
contraception, abortion and gay rights. They focused more on 
international issues -- poverty, death, human rights, and religious 
persecution. One Chilean delegate told NIRR, "We are celebrating our 
faith through prayer, dialogue, and God's word. Though we are all 
different, we are united through our faith. We must take this back and 
share it with as many people as we can."  Several organizations 
conducted weeklong protests and distributed anti-Vatican literature. 
Catholic Organizations for Renewal organized public forums on issues 
"the Vatican chooses to ignore" -- women's ordination, Haitian 
problems, peace in Central America, and homosexuality. A COR spokesman 
told NIRR, "We don't want to be confrontational, but we do want the 
world to know that there are alternative views within the Catholic 
Church." 
...DignityUSA, a gay and lesbian Catholic group, worked with COR in the 
first official protest of the week. At a rally at the state Capitol, an 
emotional crowd of 100 gay-rights activists, atheists, and 
anti-homosexual-rights demonstrators exchanged words. Dignity President 
Kevin Calegari calmly told the crowd, "We challenge the pope to seek 
hope and peace and justice for all people, especially the graceful, the 
beautiful, and the queer people of God."  Many Denver-area churches 
never opened their doors Sunday, Aug. 15. Members of every Catholic 
church in the Mile High City were encouraged to join the 15-mile 
pilgrimage to the WYD Mass, attended by 350,000 people, at Cherry Creek 
State Park. Some Protestant churches were forced to cancel or 
reschedule their services; road closures and mass traffic prevented 
members from reaching the church sanctuaries. 
...Still, evangelicals participated in the historic event. Several 
churches hosted WYD volunteers and participants; passed out tracts; 
conducted workshops, debates, and Christian concerts; and volunteered 
for a range of jobs from directing residential traffic to serving 
meals. WYD organizers scheduled a day-long Christian music festival, 
including contemporary Christian artists Kathy Troccoli, Rich Mullins, 
DC Talk, and several gospel choirs and groups.  The International 
Bible Society printed 250,000 tracts for distribution at World Youth 
Day events, according to David Nye, the project's coordinator. The 
four-color tract, undertaken in cooperation with more than 40 
evangelical churches and organizations and almost 1,000 volunteers, 
details the "salvation message." Targeting WYD onlookers, protesters, 
and participants, the IBS also provided New Testaments in 60 languages. 
At Denver and Colorado Springs churches, the organization also 
sponsored four preparation seminars on how Christians could share their 
faith. 
..."We aren't bashing Catholics; we're simply providing a means for all 
of these people coming to have a personal relationship with Jesus 
Christ rather than just be religious. We don't want to be involved in a 
Catholics vs. Protestants debate," Nye told NIRR. "Anytime there are 
people like this, who are already spiritually hungry, we want to be 
there to work with the churches to provide literature and Bibles which 
reflect our view." He said the IBS will work with Christian and 
Missionary Alliance churches worldwide to "follow up with the youth who 
respond."  A series of debates between Protestant and Catholic 
apologists drew hundreds of people to the churches hosting them. Bill 
Jackson, director of Christians Evangelizing Catholics, participated in 
one of the debates, which "help people consider what they really 
believe and why." He told NIRR that CEC printed more than 100,000 
tracts that "tell the truth about Mary and Jesus." The tracts invite 
WYD participants to "acknowledge your sin, your absolute spiritual 
poverty before a Holy God. No angel or saint can forgive you." Jackson 
and a team of 25 people from across Colorado worked with 10 churches 
and three parachurch agencies to distribute the tracts, because, 
Jackson said, "I hope to see all these Roman Catholics in heaven 
someday." 
..."They are out to steal our Catholic youth, so we must know what we 
believe," said Gerald Matatics, director of Biblical Foundations, a 
Catholic educational organization. Matatics, a former Presbyterian 
minister who became a Catholic in 1986, also participated in a series 
of debates and workshops, and explained his conversion. "My evangelical 
seminary training had given me a terrible, arrogant conception of 
Catholics," Matatics said, and in an effort to "save" a friend from 
Catholicism, he read several books by Catholic writers. "I realized 
that the Catholic faith was always based on the Bible. I am a 
Bible-believing Catholic who has realized that the Bible does not 
support Protestantism, but the Holy Catholic Apostolic church." 
Matatics told more than 500 Canadian students they need to understand 
their faith because they are "called to evangelize others" for it. "As 
an evangelical, I was always looking for the Truth in Lutheran, 
Presbyterian, or Baptist churches. As a Catholic, I have found the 
Truth," he said. 

 Catholics are getting the word out about their faith through two 
organizations. The Catholic Communication Campaign, one of the sponsors 
of WYD, initiates and produces media projects "to enlighten and inspire 
youth." The CCC spreads the Gospel through modern technology: radio 
spots, magazine ads, videos, TV commercials, and documentaries. A 1992 
U.S. public service campaign for prayer reached 41 million people, WYD 
officials said. 
...Catholic Answers, North America's largest Catholic apologetics and 
evangelization organization, was concerned about "fundamentalist 
proselytizing." The group printed 300,000 copies of Pillar of Fire, 
Pillar of Truth: The Catholic Church and God's Plan for You. The 
30-page booklet with a "concise biblical presentation of the Catholic 
faith" was distributed at every WYD event with official endorsement. CA 
seeks to "to spread the Catholic faith -- by helping good Catholics 
become better Catholics, by bringing former Catholics `home,' and by 
resolving misconceptions non-Catholics may have about the Church and 
what it teaches."  A "Say Yes to Jesus" workshop offered a positive 
alternative in today's "Just Say No" world. Through the Catholic 
Evangelization Apostolate for Youth, well-known speakers, athletes, 
musicians, and clergy testify to "Christ's real presence and power," 
and help bring Catholic youth "to a closer relationship in their faith 
with Jesus Christ." The National Catholic Coalition, International 
Catholic Charismatic Renewal, National Teens Encounter Christ, Covenant 
House, and Catholic Action of Italy also offered youth workshops.  
Participants at WYD also were called to leave Denver a better place 
than they found it. In several work teams, about 3,000 youth helped 
sack groceries in food banks, clean neighborhoods, visit the elderly, 
and repair homes with Habitat for Humanity. WYD officials saw the 
projects as an opportunity to "put the Gospel message into action by 
providing WYD participants the experience of `fullness of life' as an 
awareness of others through Christian service." 

The Religious Heritage of America has awarded its special gold medal to 
theologian Carl F.H. Henry. Directors for the St. Louis-based 
organization, which notes the positive impact of religion in the 
development of the country, honored the former Christianity Today 
editor and well-known evangelical for his more than 50 years of service 
to Christian scholarship. RHA also named O.S. Hawkins, pastor of First 
Baptist Church in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., as Clergyman of the Year. 
Wal-Mart Stores Chief Operating Officer Donald Soderquist was named Lay 
Churchman of the Year, and the Lay Churchwoman award went to Joni 
Eareckson Tada, founder-president of Joni and Friends, Inc. 
...Joni and Friends Ministries is beginning a Christian Institute on 
Disability (CID) next month. The new educational branch will do 
research, help set public policy, and serve as a liaison with other 
organizations. "We want to legitimize disabled missions as ministry 
options for churches," Joni and Friends Ministries' Executive Director 
L. Michael Lynch told NIRR. "Our goal is to help Christian ministries 
develop a disabled component, and to encourage Bible colleges and 
seminaries to include a day-and-a-half training on disabilities in 
their curriculum." Tada has been involved in speaking to schools about 
the disabled, Lynch said. A weeklong conference beginning in September 
will offer 23 intensive classes, on-site visits to churches and 
rehabilitation centers, and an opportunity to clarify a philosophy and 
theology of disability and develop program options. 
...Of the 17% of the U.S. population that is considered sight-, 
hearing-, or physically disabled, the church is reaching only 3%. "The 
church needs to be educated into its role as evangelizer, discipler, 
and integrator of the disabled," which Lynch said CID would do. Program 
Director Richard Brown told NIRR, "Until now, there have been some 
individuals and groups working with the disabled, but there has been no 
focused or organized group linking these efforts." He said CID hoped 
"to provide a clearinghouse at the graduate and grassroots levels" to 
aid missions agencies, seminaries, and congregations with resources and 
assistance in establishing ministries to the disabled. 

Reports of continued Assemblies of God growth and the selection of new 
leadership topped the agenda at the 45th General Council. AG 
Information Secretary Juleen Turnage told NIRR that nearly 18,000 
gathered in Minneapolis Aug. 10-15 for the convention. Biennial reports 
showed a 11.4% increase in financial giving, 76,344 new members, and 
net gains of 336 congregations and 339 ministers. Reported Sunday 
school attendance sagged 2.7% during the past decade, but shows 
strength in congregations that emphasize children's education over 
worship services. Attendance tops 10,000 at each of the AG's two 
largest Sunday schools, Tommy Barnett's First Assembly of God in 
Phoenix and Bill Wilson's Metro Assembly of God in Brooklyn. In 
addition to inner-city growth, the AG expects continued increases in 
Hispanic congregations. 
...Thomas Trask was elected general superintendent, replacing G. 
Raymond Carlson who did not seek reelection (NIRR 5/3), having held the 
office since 1986. Citing a report that nearly 50% of the church's 
laity "may not have received the in-filling of the Holy Spirit," Trask 
told reporters that the Springfield, Mo.-based church would need to go 
back to the basics of Pentecostalism in order to maintain its growth 
pattern. Trask's 37-year ministry has included emphasis on home and 
foreign missions for the denomination, which now boasts a missionary 
force of 2,238. In recent weeks, the Division of Foreign Missions 
distributed in the former Soviet Union 30,000 copies of Faith, Hope and 
Love, which they believe to be the first Christian magazine for Russian 
women. Other recent missions news included the appointment of 
missionary Ron Peck as director for the Center for Ministry to Muslims. 
He replaces Delmar Kingsriter, who had resigned due to health reasons. 
Founded in 1914 in Hot Springs, Ark., the Assemblies of God claims 2.5 
million adherents in the United States and 22.5 million worldwide. 

The Cooperative Baptist Fellowship has elected another former Southern 
Baptist foreign missions veteran to its leadership team. Harlan 
Spurgeon became the CBF's associate missions coordinator on Aug. 1, 
Baptist sources reported. Spurgeon resigned in April as the Southern 
Baptist Foreign Mission Board's vice president of the office of mission 
personnel, citing differences with the conservative trustees. He joins 
two other high-ranking officials who have left the FMB and aligned with 
the 2-year-old moderate Baptist group. Former FMB President Keith Parks 
(NIRR 12/14/92, 5/18/92) is the CBF's global missions coordinator, and 
Betty Law, former FMB vice president for the Americas, now serves as 
the Atlanta-based CBF's associate missions coordinator. 

Robert Tilton is involved in another legal action: a divorce from his 
wife of 25 years, Marte. On Aug. 15 he told his Word of Faith World 
Outreach Center Church that the two are separating. Tilton gave no 
reason, and filed for divorce in a Dallas court the next day. Tilton's 
court papers indicated the marriage had grown "insupportable because of 
discord or conflict of personalities that destroyed the legitimate 
ends" of their relationship. The couple has yet to sign an agreement 
that will split the estate, which includes an 11,000-square-foot home 
near Dallas, a yacht and condominium in Florida, and other assets 
reportedly worth $90 million. 
...An attorney for plaintiffs accusing Tilton of fraud says the divorce 
may be a ploy to shift funds. C. Tony Wright represents several 
Dallas-area clients, including Norma Smith, who claims that in a mass 
mailing Tilton promised her late husband, Tommy, he would recover on 
"miracle day" from an illness that already had killed him. She also 
says that Success 'N Life requested donations Tommy supposedly pledged 
two months after he died. 

Disapproval of television program content is rising, according to the 
recent Gallup/Family Channel "Survey of Television Viewing Habits." Of 
the adult Americans interviewed, 54% reported being somewhat more or 
much more offended by TV programs this year than one year ago. Citing 
excessive emphasis on sex, violent behavior, and foul language, 65% of 
those polled say television depicts negative values (up 3% from 1992); 
69% say it does not represent their own values (up 3%); and 64% say it 
does not represent family values well (up 4%). 
...Viewers' strategies for dealing with offensive material vary, with 
50% reporting they turn the television off when something offends them. 
Another 29% say they switch channels. Overall, in response to many 
factors, 54% of viewers say they watch TV either somewhat less or much 
less than they did a year ago. 
...Violence on television contributes to violent behavior, according to 
79% of survey respondents. By contrast, only 1% believe that TV 
violence strongly helps prevent anti-social behavior. Furthermore, 86% 
say on-screen violence augments violent behavior of children under 18. 
Virtually no one says it helps prevent violence by minors. Of both 
adult Americans with some college education and those who are parents 
of teen-age children, 69% believe television has a negative effect on 
families, making them the two groups most likely to believe in TV's 
harmful influence. And 63% of parents say they frequently or 
occasionally monitor what their children watch. 

CLeaR-TV took the heat off Johnson Wax, ending a national boycott. 
Christian Leaders for Responsible Television, a broad-based coalition 
of more than 1,000 evangelicals concerned about TV programming, called 
the boycott last March in protest of S.C. Johnson & Son's sponsorship 
of programs containing excessive and gratuitous sex, violence, and 
profanity. Executives from both groups met in June, resulting in a 
revision of the company's advertising policy. In a July 9 letter, S.C. 
Johnson leaders noted the boycotters' suggestions had helped them 
clarify their screening procedures. CLeaR-TV Chairman Billy Melvin said 
the organization was satisfied that Johnson & Son was "a socially 
responsible corporation" that would support "family-friendly television 
programming in the future." 

Texas dentist Richard Neill says he won't let opposition stop him from 
extracting Donahue from daytime TV. Neill launched his efforts last 
April after seeing the show while waiting in a doctor's office with his 
young daughter. The live program featured a mother who claimed to have 
had sex with 2,759 men. Neill told NIRR he was so disgusted that he 
"wanted to see if there was a pattern." What he found was a smorgasbord 
of similar sagas. Donahue producers insist the show deals with 
important, current issues, and they say host Phil Donahue will not 
change his style or subject matter. 
...Neill also found that about 10,000 children in the Dallas area watch 
Donahue each day at 9 a.m. And at least 450,000 children nationally 
watch the daily syndicated program. Neill says his goal is to have 
Donahue moved to night-time slots when children are not watching, or to 
have Dallas television stations refuse to air it. 
...Neill began lobbying executives of companies that advertise on 
Donahue. He sent a tape or transcript of the show, along with a letter 
asking them to stop their sponsorship. "They began dropping like 
flies," he told NIRR, noting that many said they did not realize what 
they were paying for. Neill also circulated petitions in 150 local 
churches to amass signatures against Donahue. Publicity from magazines, 
newspapers, and television has helped recruit a network of 
letter-writing volunteers, he said. 
...Neill's efforts have had professional and personal repercussions. 
Bob Turner, president of Multimedia Entertainment, which distributes 
Donahue, reportedly called Neill a "pipsqueak." And Neill claimed one 
program, "Crusading Christians Who Hate Phil," was taped last April in 
Fort Worth as a counter-offensive. Robert Peters, president of Morality 
in Media, and Monsignor Jim Lisante, director of family ministries for 
the diocese of Rockville Center, Long Island, appeared on the show, 
although the dentist declined, saying he was not a debater. 
...A Christian for 17 years and a Southern Baptist deacon, Neill said 
he was a quiet, often lukewarm believer until he underwent a spiritual 
renewal about four years ago. "I have never been an activist in 
anything, but I felt it was time to try to make my voice heard -- but I 
was never expecting all this to happen," Neill told NIRR. 
...To date, 184 local and national sponsors -- including major 
advertisers such as Sara Lee, Clorox, Dr Pepper, Dole, Keebler, Kmart, 
Johnson Wax, PET, and Baskin-Robbins -- have pulled their wares from 
the show. A few of the former sponsors say Neill's pleas played little 
or no part in their decisions to stop sponsoring Donahue. Executives 
from the program say they have had no trouble finding other sponsors, 
and have not lost any money. But Neill told NIRR that in monitoring the 
programs, his wife has found "a lot of public service announcements" 
rather than paid advertising lately. "Donahue is starting to struggle," 
he said. 

Scientists, pastors, teachers, and laypersons grappled with the 
practical impact of science on the church July 26-29 at Concordia 
College in Moorhead, Minn. Some 360 conference participants from 34 
states and five Canadian provinces agreed society's assumptions are 
shaped by modern science and technology. If the church won't deal 
seriously with those issues, they said, its message will be ignored. 
..."Scientists and theologians have got to talk, yet there are very few 
opportunities" to do so, said Arland Jacobson, director of the CHARIS 
Ecumenical Center, a continuing education agency that co-hosted the 
conference, the first of its kind. Along with the Ecumenical Roundtable 
on Science and Technology (which includes members of Anglican, 
Christian, Episcopal, Lutheran, Presbyterian, and United Methodist 
churches), CHARIS hopes to hold similar interactive conferences every 
three years. 
...Many scientists feel frustrated, excluded, and isolated because the 
church does not value their expertise, Jacobson told NIRR. Yet today's 
pastors need scientific information to help answer "ethical questions 
having to do with their ministry, especially biomedical issues such as 
euthanasia and genetic determinism," the notion that hereditary factors 
can cause certain behaviors, he said. Other conference topics included 
miracles, biomedical technologies, how men and women tend to approach 
scientific research differently, prayer, ecology and justice in the 
Third World, worship in a technological age, and the creation/evolution 
debate. Although scientists tended to dominate the conversations, 
speeches and workshops were designed to be understood by laymen, and 
pastors generally understood the discussions, Jacobson said. 
...The conference also was designed to raise parishioners' 
consciousness of scientific and technological issues through curriculum 
created by a collaboration between scientists and theologians, Jacobson 
said. Participants also made plans to foster more issue-oriented 
dialogue among and inside denominations. 

Churches that want to grow have to get back to nature, according to 
Calvin DeWitt, an evangelical professor of environmental studies at the 
University of Wisconsin. "If one is to preach the gospel today, it has 
to include care for creation," he told NIRR. "It is the evangelical 
wave." 
..."The churches could just thrive if they took hold of their 
stewardship responsibilities" and became creation-awareness centers, 
said DeWitt, who also directs the Au Sable Institute, an ecology study 
center in Mancelona, Mich. (NIRR 1/25). Au Sable's environmental 
programs are evangelically oriented, and their biblical focus has 
garnered support from mainline denominations, he told NIRR. "Mainlines 
really are looking to re-establish their rootedness in Scripture. Jesus 
Christ is very key in this: Christ as creator, upholder, and 
reconciler." DeWitt said, "A church can drift and become a social 
institution, but it starts grasping for an ethical base. I've gone to 
many mainline churches where there is tremendous excitement about 
this." 
...DeWitt recently addressed some 200 scientists at a meeting of the 
American Scientific Affiliation, a fellowship of 2,500 scientists who 
are Christians. The theme of the 48th annual conference, held Aug. 5-10 
at Seattle Pacific University, was "Caring for Creation: A Christian 
Perspective on the Environment." DeWitt suggested churches hold 
ecological meetings or install a bulletin board, which could be tools 
for evangelism. "The place you would go to find out about the 
environment would be the church, the place where the Creator is 
honored." He also suggested "greening" the church grounds with native 
plants that were living in the area before it became a city. When "the 
newspaper comes around," he said, "you can tell them you're restoring a 
little of God's creation." 

Dinosaur questions from all over the nation are flooding the Institute 
for Creation Research in El Cajon, Calif., since Universal Studios 
released Jurassic Park. "People want to know, `Are dinosaurs mentioned 
in the Bible? Were there dinosaurs on the ark? What happened to them?'" 
ICR Media Director Mark Looy told NIRR. Books by Duane Gish, including 
his new Dinosaurs by Design, and John Morris' children's book What 
Really Happened to the Dinosaurs? are "selling like hotcakes," Looy 
said. Increased interest in dinosaurs has spurred ICR speakers to 
highlight the subject in their Back to Genesis seminars around the 
country. Will scientists ever really be able to clone an extinct animal 
back into existence? "No," said Looy. "That's impossible. Jurassic Park 
is one big fairy tale." 
...Dinosaurs and the Bible, a half-hour radio special prepared by ICR, 
is receiving a "phenomenal" response, according to Tricia Duffy of 
Ambassador Advertising Agency, which arranges the bookings. In just six 
weeks, 320 (nearly their record response of 350) stations have 
requested the program, "and that number is increasing daily," Duffy 
told NIRR. Dinosaurs and the Bible, which will be released next month, 
answers the most frequently asked questions on the subject and includes 
clips from the movie which spurred "dinomania." 

Evolutionary theory won't be taught as fact in Vista, Calif. Three 
Bible-believing members of the school board (NIRR 6/14) outvoted the 
remaining two members recently on a policy that allows teachers to 
challenge the way evolution is presented in the city's public schools. 
As approved, the statement says (1) no theory of science shall be 
taught dogmatically, and no student shall be compelled to believe or 
accept any theory; (2) scientific evidence that challenges any 
scientific theory should be presented; and (3) discussions of divine 
creation, ultimate purposes, or ultimate causes are appropriate in 
social science and language classes. 
...The Los Angeles Times reported the decision was "in defiance of 
state educational guidelines," but School Board President Deidre 
Holliday showed NIRR that two of the three points are taken virtually 
word for word from the California State Board of Education Policy on 
the Teaching of Natural Sciences. Most of the controversy surrounds the 
second point, board member John Tyndall told NIRR. "This policy allows 
teachers to present weaknesses in evolution if they want to. It doesn't 
allow them to teach creationism." But according to Holliday, it does 
put creationism "on an equal footing with evolution." 
...Twenty of the 32 speakers prior to the vote supported the policy. 
Yet San Diego's largest newspaper made the meeting "sound like a 
clown-type revival meeting," Tyndall complained. Its article "doesn't 
mention the quality of people -- scientists, science teachers -- who 
spoke in favor of the policy." The Teachers' Association, the local arm 
of the National Education Association, opposes the ruling, Tyndall 
said. "They put up $10,000 to defeat Christian candidates last year, so 
you can see where they stand." He also said the ACLU is watching the 
board closely. 

Archaeologists say Israel's King David was mentioned in ancient texts 
besides the Bible. Late last month "the dean of Israeli 
archaeologists," 84-year-old Avraham Biran of Hebrew Union College in 
Cincinnati and the Jewish Institute of Religion in Jerusalem, found a 
small stone tablet in the rubble of a Jewish wall near the Jordan 
River. Thirteen lines of Aramaic on the tablet describe the defeat of 
Baasha, King of Israel, by Asa of the House of David and the king of 
Syria, in the ninth century B.C. It is not only the first 
extra-biblical corroboration of this battle, described in I Kings 15, 
but of the House of David and thus of King David himself. The text is 
still being deciphered, but the Aramaic includes the phrases "King of 
Israel," "chariots," and "thousands of horsemen." 
...The discovery "gives us more confidence in the historical reality of 
the biblical text," Hershel Shanks, editor of Biblical Archaeology 
Review, told the Los Angeles Times. Alfred Gottschalk, president of 
Hebrew Union College, said, "This takes away the argument that David 
was the figment of somebody's imagination." 

OVERSET EXTRA POPE 

...At the opening session, Cardinal Eduardo Pironio, president of the 
Pontifical Council for the Laity, told the group that "human growth is 
best understood as life in Christ, mediated through the community of 
the church. I would say that this Forum must essentially be a Forum of 
Grace, of sanctity of transparency. It must be done with the profundity 
of prayer and the cheerfulness of fraternal charity in generosity and 
availability for the mission of Christ." 

Another delegate told reporters that "the pope and the Church have 
found that we, the youth, are very important. This is a much bigger 
issue to us than talking about family planning." 

IYF participants prepared an official letter to the pope and to the 
world's youth, calling on leaders and youth to "strive to serve each 
other through the grace of our Lord. We should all be the missionaries 
and testimonies of the Church. The church will remain youthful as long 
as youth are in the church." 

At one of three conferences where the press was allowed, an American 
delegate said his international friends "are struggling enough with 
important issues like poverty, death, human rights, and whether they 
will be persecuted for their faith. We need to firm up our priorities 
and values, the areas which can affect every aspect of our world." 
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ +PEOPLE/ Gilyard--abp/nirrs+ 
Darrell Gilyard has taken a pulpit in his native Florida two years 
after his fall from the limelight, according to Associated Baptist 
Press. The controversial black evangelist, once a rising Southern 
Baptist star and protege of leaders Jerry Vines and Paige Patterson, 
was installed as pastor of Jacksonville's Shiloh Metropolitan Baptist 
Church July 25. 
...Since Gilyard, 31, began preaching at Shiloh four months ago, 
attendance has climbed from 300 to about 1,000, transforming it from a 
"dying" to "very progressive" church, Sykes said. "We're going to stand 
by him." 
...The church is more concerned with Gilyard's future ministry than his 
past, Ella Marie Sykes, Shiloh's director of ministry, told the Florida 
Times-Union. In 1991, after five women's allegations of sexual 
improprieties surfaced in the Dallas Morning News, Gilyard stepped down 
from the pulpit of the 800-member Victory Baptist, a growing 
multiracial church in Richardson, Texas (NIRR 8/12/91, 7/29/91). He 
admitted to unspecified personal sin, but refused to stay out of the 
pulpit for two years, which Baptist leaders suggested as part of his 
restoration. With 125 former Victory members, he began Grace Community 
Church in Garland, Texas. Gilyard also admitted he had exaggerated his 
sad childhood tale of growing up homeless under a bridge on the St. 
John's River, a story aired nationally on Jerry Falwell's Old Time 
Gospel Hour television program. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Vol. 7, No. 17                                                        
August 9, 1993 

What is a pastor's most important personal attribute? A caring nature, 
38.7% of men and 47.1% of women said in a recent churchwide survey of 
758 United Methodist laypeople. About 42% of both men and women rated 
honesty as an important trait, and cooperation also rated highly (43.2% 
women, 36.9% men). Included in the other 15 highly rated personal 
traits were self-control, inspiration, loyalty, intelligence, and 
supportiveness. 
...A majority of men and almost half the women rated strong preaching 
as the most important pastoral skill. Management and administration 
ranked second and third for both sexes, and were rated as even more 
important to those in congregations with more than 1,000 members. Other 
skills considered important included leadership and visioning, 
education, worship, community involvement, and evangelism. 
...The poll was conducted to determine what laypeople saw as important 
keys to effective pastoring. Analysts with the UMC's General Council on 
Ministries and the St. Paul School of Theology in Kansas City noted a 
trend toward an internal rather than external focus in the 8.9-million 
member church. The report concluded that although the UMC needs 
forward-looking leadership, laity seek pastoral styles that emphasize 
maintenance more than mission. 

Cambridge, England, is seeing "green shoots of renewal within the 
dominant Christian tradition," Robert Benne told NIRR. Benne, head of 
the religion and philosophy department at Roanoke College, a Virginia 
school sponsored by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, 
recently returned from his third year-long sabbatical there since 1978. 
Cambridge is an unlikely site for a spiritual rebirth, since the city 
is dominated by a great secular university and high-tech economics, he 
said. Britain, as a whole, has experienced increasing secularization 
and decreasing church attendance. But in his deliberate church-hopping, 
Benne found new growth among evangelicals, especially within the 
Anglican communion, various Protestant denominations, and independent 
(often charismatic) churches. 
...At least a dozen evangelical and charismatic churches flourish in 
Cambridge, Benne said. He and his family regularly visited four -- Eden 
Baptist, St. Andrew's Street Baptist, The Round Church (Anglican), and 
Holy Trinity (also Anglican) -- which together draw thousands of 
Cambridge University students to worship services during the academic 
year. More and more townspeople, many of them high-church 
traditionalists, are attending as well. Benne attributes the success of 
such churches to four common elements:  Expository biblical preaching 
through complete books of Scripture. In contrast to liberal clerics on 
television and radio, whose daily programs feature more political than 
spiritual commentary, pastors at these churches emphasize an 
intellectual, non-emotional presentation of the Bible and its 
authority. As the preachers often are graduates of Cambridge or Oxford, 
their sermons appeal as much to the head as to the heart.  Ministry 
that appeals to all ages, but focuses on the young. Bible studies, 
prayer services, and classes for truthseekers are informal and rarely 
liturgical, but are well organized. Especially important is a new 
musical style, featuring musicians who lead worship with new hymns, 
many of them by British composer Graham Kendrick.  Numerous outlets 
for service, especially to the community. One church operates a 
restaurant in the same building as an evangelical bookstore, as well as 
a job center, and a homeless shelter. Another runs a soup kitchen and 
food pantry. Most of the church charities are attuned to the needs of 
the elderly, the poor, and the middle classes, although some charity 
assistance goes to war victims in the former Yugoslavia. In addition, 
the churches have networks for pastoral care and counseling within the 
churches. Some social activists work within voluntary associations that 
are independent of formal church organization. The most common of these 
is the Jubilee Center's Keep Sunday Special campaign of lobbying 
Parliament for a less hectic, more rest-oriented Lord's Day.  
Evangelistic outreaches to students and the unchurched. From their 
central Cambridge locations, several of the churches have begun related 
congregations in other parts of town. The churches also give direct 
financial and personal support to missionaries, and youth often 
volunteer for short-term missions work. 

Thirty years after C.S. Lewis' death, a feature-length film about the 
Oxford professor's personal life will open in Los Angeles two weeks 
before Christmas. Veteran director Richard Attenborough has just 
finished shooting in England for the movie Shadowlands. Based on 
British playwright William Nicholson's acclaimed stage version, the 
British film details Lewis' love affair with the outspoken Joy 
Davidman, who died of cancer four years after their wedding. 
Award-winning actors Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger play the lead 
roles. The production reportedly cost close to $18 million, and turned 
Oxford University's dignified Magdalen College into a tent city during 
the two months of filming. "The spirit on the set was joyous. 
Attenborough has a great eye for a great story, and on the set there's 
a real commitment to doing it right," J. Stanley Mattson, president of 
the C.S. Lewis Foundation in Redlands, Calif., told NIRR from location. 
...Mattson is in Oxford for a five-week project to help restore Lewis' 
home, The Kilns. A British Broadcasting Corp. version of the play 
(which also aired on U.S. public television) inspired several people to 
assist with restoration. A local 80-year-old joiner/finish 
carpenter/plumber and a 35-year-old wet plasterer from Lewis' parish 
church and two British bricklayers were among the more than 40 
volunteers. Others included a California surgeon and his wife, a 
retired General Motors executive, a contractor and his family of six, a 
Campus Crusade for Christ staff member, a postal service executive, 
newlyweds from Virginia, an architectural student, a roofer, teachers 
from Nashville, Redlands, Toronto, and Holland, and various teen-agers 
and children. Using old photos and recollections of Lewis' visitors as 
guides to how the property should look, they teamed to paint, 
landscape, strip wallpaper, reopen fireplaces, expose garden walls, 
clean rafters, and re-tile the roof. Every afternoon the workers 
gathered to read aloud and discuss Lewis' book, The Great Divorce. Next 
summer, the BBC wants to do a documentary on the final two weeks of 
restoration and the dedication of The Kilns. 
...Society is ready for the author's message, Mattson said. 
"Shadowlands touches every aspect of what we deal with today -- the 
phenomenon of growing old, the discovery of romantic love late in life, 
death. Here is someone who's brilliant, who's genuinely committed 
spiritually, but who asks questions for which he can find no answers. 
People are willing to acknowledge now that there is a `problem of 
pain.' Lewis' public wrestling with that is no longer offensive to 
them." 
...The C.S. Lewis Foundation has as a long-term objective to "totally 
reform education in the United States," Mattson told NIRR. By 1999 it 
hopes to develop a C.S. Lewis College on an existing university campus. 
The college would be interactive with the larger, secular community, he 
said. "Christians should be able to teach openly -- like feminists do 
-- without being censored or fired for providing a Christian view on 
any subject. Of course, to evangelize in an educational setting is 
inappropriate." The foundation is considering five elite universities 
as possible sites. In addition, the foundation also will host a summer 
conference on Faith and Science at Cambridge University. 

Christians in the field of philosophy are becoming "more and more 
up-front" about their faith, says Kenneth Konyndyk, secretary of the 
Society of Christian Philosophers (SCP). The international network, 
founded in 1978 for believers interested in philosophy, has more than 
1,000 members. SCP is headquartered in Grand Rapids, Mich., at Calvin 
College, where Konyndyk teaches. Last month, SCP completed Revolution 
in Christian Philosophy, its first annual conference for lay 
Christians. 
...Some of America's elite universities are increasingly open to having 
overt Christians on the faculty of their philosophy departments, 
Konyndyk told NIRR. For instance, Alvin Plantinga, called "the leading 
philosopher of God," directs the Center for Philosophy of Religion at 
the University of Notre Dame. Nicholas Wolterstorff teaches philosophy 
at Yale University, where another Christian, Robert Adams, has recently 
been invited to head the department. His wife, Marilyn Adams, will 
teach at Yale Divinity School. The philosophy departments of Cornell 
and Princeton also include Christian professors, Konyndyk said. 
..."As secular philosophers turn away from the hyper-objective view" 
[that holds it is possible to approach science and philosophy without 
bias], he said, "it will be increasingly possible for Christians to get 
their voices heard as Christians." Christian college professors are 
gaining reputations as philosophers, among them Konyndyk and former 
Calvin psychology professor Mary Stewart Van Leeuwen, who will serve as 
Resident Scholar at the Center for Christian Women in Leadership at 
Eastern College. "It is reaching the point where Christians are going 
to become players in the game," Konyndyk said. 

Church leaders in Ghana never expected research data to change their 
strategies for ministry. But more than 500 of them from a variety of 
denominations adapted their evangelization plans when they heard the 
results of a national religious survey, according to Ross Campbell, 
director of the Ghana Evangelism Committee (GEC) and survey organizer. 
To define the West African nation's remaining evangelism needs, 
researchers spent four years gathering on-site information from village 
to village. Results, preliminarily presented at a 1989 national 
consultation, and in final form last month, identified five key people 
groups that had not been reached effectively by the church. 
...The survey "was like a bombshell" that broke "the complacency of 
Christians and churches" in Ghana, Campbell told NIRR. Results 
presented at the original consultation inspired church and parachurch 
leaders to launch numerous missions and outreach initiatives. "Only 
when they got the whole picture did they see where they had been, [and] 
where they still need to go," he said. The GEC statistics showed 
definite increases in nominalism among Christians, the number of 
unreached peoples in the north and the south, and the number of 
adherents to Islam. An AD 2000 and Beyond report said the thoroughness 
of the ongoing research confronted leaders with the unequivocal 
realities of Ghana's spiritual condition. In order to evangelize all of 
Ghana by century's end, Christian leaders changed their "business as 
usual" and growth mentalities to necessary new viewpoints, AD 2000 
reported. 
...A world missions census by 1995? The plans are under way. Applauding 
the inspirational and practical benefits of the Ghana survey, missions 
strategists met July 20 in Colorado Springs to draw up Assessment 2000: 
A Global Survey of the Unfinished Task, a replica of the Ghana model on 
a worldwide scale. Leaders from 15 international agencies, including AD 
2000 and Beyond, Youth With A Mission, Every Home for Christ, Wycliffe 
Bible Translators, the Southern Baptist Foreign Mission Board, Campus 
Crusade for Christ, Global Mapping International, and Adopt-A-People 
Clearing House (AAPCH), discussed how their groups could best 
contribute to the two-year survey, seen as background information on 
how to reach every person with the gospel of Christ by the year 2000. 
...To measure the progress of world evangelization efforts, the 
baseline survey will target each of the world's more than 220 countries 
and 6,000 cities, as well as each of several million-people target 
areas and all 12,000 people groups. This, said AAPCH's Frank Kaleb 
Jansen, could provide "a snapshot of the world for missions leaders." 
According to the consultation's report, the complete survey would 
consist of "a series of properly defined, adequately sampled" smaller 
field surveys, and would involve organizational networking and 
cooperation. Answers to questions as simple as "Who is Jesus Christ?" 
will help reveal the state of world evangelization, and which areas 
require heaviest targeting. 
..."Our goal is to document every person's exposure to the gospel as 
well as their response to it," Luis Bush, international director of AD 
2000 and Beyond, told NIRR. The three-phase global survey begins in 
January. Phase I is the design of the questionnaire and approach; Phase 
II is the actual field sampling throughout the world by mission agency 
representatives; and Phase III is analysis and written presentation of 
the findings. 
...A 1995 Global Consultation on World Evangelization in Seoul, South 
Korea, will release the survey results to more than 400 international 
ministry representatives at one meeting, and will coincide with two 
other conferences in Seoul, where more than 10,000 Christian leaders 
from throughout the world will also receive the survey's findings. 
Survey facilitator Mary Ann Stone of AD 2000 said the research results 
will be indispensable for pastors teaching their congregations about 
world missions in the 1990s. Said Bailey Marks, Jr., of Campus Crusade, 
"Our goal is not just to gather data, but to use the information to get 
our marching orders." 

God is moving among the Berber people of Islamic North Africa, 
according to leading missions analysts. George Otis, Jr., Peter Wagner, 
Luis Bush, Greg Livingstone, and others reviewed recent factual 
accounts to confirm reports of a spiritual awakening in Algeria. Over 
the past several years, various sources had noted numerous conversions, 
as well as stories of divine manifestations, such as spiritual dreams, 
visions, and angelic visitations. The leaders said evidence suggested 
that at least 300 people were converted in the Algerian coastal city of 
Bejaia during this period. Conversions continue to take place on a 
regular basis, and the missiologists said, "The Lord has been at work 
in a special way among other Berber groups." They agreed that Berber 
converts in the area number in the thousands. 
...Otis also reported a continuing "Book of Acts-style revival 
throughout other parts of Algeria." He recounted a summer 1990 meeting 
with several dozen former Muslims who had come to Christ over the 
previous 18 months. Otis said nearly all of them reported some type of 
"supernatural intervention." Churches "are spreading like wildfire," 
especially in the Atlas Mountains. Bible studies and "marathon prayer 
sessions" in homes and on mountain tops are attended by as many as 
several thousand new believers, one Arabic-speaking witness said. 

The human devastation in Sudan "surpasses even that of Somalia or the 
former Yugoslavia," according to a Presbyterian peace delegation 
report. A nine-member research team of the Presbyterian Church (USA) 
made a twoweek tour of the African nation in late June, meeting with 
head of state General Omar Hassan al-Bashir, reputed leader of Sudanese 
Islamization Hassan al-Turabi, and with both factions of the Sudanese 
People's Liberation Army. The Presbyterians also contacted Sudanese 
church leaders, refugees, and international relief agencies. 
...A decade-long civil war, human rights violations, and alleged 
government attempts at ethnic cleansing have caused a 70% mortality 
rate in some villages, according to the delegation. An estimated 4-5 
million people are displaced from their homes and 1 million are in 
danger of starving this year (NIRR 5/3). The group urged the world 
community to pay attention to the catastrophe before an "entire 
population is lost." 
...Sudanese Christians reportedly are being judged by Islamic law, or 
Sharia, despite officials' denials. In early July, Episcopal Bishop 
Peter Elbersh and parishioner Samira Kuku were sentenced to 90 lashes 
of a whip for unspecified charges, News Network International reported. 
A related NNI report quoted various sources saying Christian women have 
been prosecuted for wearing African attire rather than traditional 
Islamic coverings. Sudan is predominantly populated by Muslims, but the 
concentration of black Christians, mostly in the south, has grown from 
about 5% to 20% in the past 20 years. 

Protestant missionaries recently revealed the details of an Angola 
massacre occurring after a Jan. 3 battle between government and rebel 
troops. Preston Parrish of Awakenings, a Winston-Salem, N.C.-based 
evangelism and communications ministry, talked with the missionaries 
during a July trip to the Angola-Namibia border area. Reportedly, 
hundreds of men, women, and children systematically were dragged from 
their homes by government troops and executed on the spot in Lubango, 
Angola. Two of the missionary witnesses later counted more than 500 
bodies in a city morgue. The victims were targeted as friendly to 
government opposition forces in Angola's civil war, the missionaries 
said. At the time, independence rebels accused government police of 
launching the campaign to wipe out sympathizers after rebels had turned 
over their weapons to the regional government in Lubango. 
...May 19 the United States recognized diplomats from Angola's 
government, supported for years by the former Soviet Union. Last year, 
with United Nations mediation, a cease-fire was negotiated in the 
Angolan conflict, and an election was conducted in September. Neither 
rival group emerged with a clear majority, and charges of election 
fraud led to renewed fighting. "Most media coverage right now seems to 
be focusing on the reluctance of Angola's UNITA (National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola) rebels, led by Jonas Savimbi, to lay down 
their arms," Parrish told NIRR. "Missionaries are very concerned that 
the international community not reach the conclusion that the 
government is without fault. From our perspective, there is no innocent 
party." 
...The U.S. State Department had "heard reports of a number of very 
terrible incidents," and although it had been unable to confirm them 
independently, the department had "strongly voiced its concern" to the 
Southwest African country's government, State Department Officer Lois 
Cecsarini told NIRR. Parrish thought it unwise to reveal the 
missionaries' names, since people ministering there are always under 
suspicion as it is. "Missionaries in Angola walk a very difficult line. 
They are accused of being spies," he said. 

China Ministries International (CMI) is seeking to prevent Hong Kong 
from losing more of its pastors. As 1997 (the year China takes control 
of the British dependency) approaches, thousands of Chinese are leaving 
Hong Kong for the United States and Canada. Among them are pastors who 
feel called to shepherd the immigrants in new congregations in North 
America, U.S. Director Brent Fulton told NIRR from CMI headquarters in 
Pasadena, Calif. 
...To counteract the "drain," CMI operates two Hong Kong-based 
ministries. Chinese Mission Seminary trains men willing to stay in Hong 
Kong as full-time pastors. The seminary, founded in 1987 by church 
researcher and CMI Director Jonathan Chao, has 35 students. And the Lay 
Training Institute (LTI), with an enrollment of 75, offers local church 
members a two-year weekend and evening program in discipleship and 
evangelism. In addition to Bible and theology courses, the institute 
stresses spiritual life, Bible memorization, and meditation. LTI also 
offers classes in Chinese history, politics, culture, religion, and in 
Mandarin and Cantonese, Hong Kong's key languages. 
...Both the seminary and the institute teach students to learn from the 
persecuted church in China about suffering for Christ and about 
commitment. Each ministry requires students to participate in practical 
Christian service projects once a month and for several weeks during 
summer and winter breaks. Fulton told NIRR that both schools have goals 
to evangelize mainland Chinese, who account for 27.5% of the world's 
unreached people, and to assist the growing number of Christians in 
house churches on the mainland (NIRR Special Report, 6/28). 

Missions groups remain in the dark over whether Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin will approve the Russian legislature's July 14 bill restricting 
the activities of foreign religious groups (NIRR 7/26). From the time 
he received the bill, Yeltsin had 14 days to sign it into law. By the 
end of July, however, "no hard information" had been made public as to 
whether or when the parliament actually had presented the bill to him, 
according to Lauren Homer, a Washington, D.C., attorney of counsel with 
the firm of Gammon and Grange. Homer, who specializes in representing 
non-profit clients engaged in activities in the former Soviet 
republics, told NIRR that the seeming delay would give ministries 
additional time to contact Russian authorities and Yeltsin himself with 
their appeals for a veto of the bill. 
...The religious and mass media regulation measures passed in 
approximately the same time period, represent a political power play, 
Homer said. She indicated the Russian Orthodox Church clearly supports 
enactment of the law, and will pursue the matter, even if Yeltsin 
vetoes the bill. Groups that have assumed they do not have to register 
because they were invited by a Russian group may not be safe, since 
specific accreditation requirements and administrative regulations have 
not been drafted into the bill Yeltsin was presented, she said. 

Antiochian Orthodox priests will not let their cup or spoon pass from 
them, despite some fears of disease-tainted communion elements. In July 
Metropolitan Philip told about 300 priests and deacons to continue 
spooning chunks of consecrated, wine-soaked bread into believers' 
mouths, in keeping with a Byzantine ritual almost 1,000 years old. 
...The danger of contracting AIDS or other diseases from the communion 
practice was loudly discussed for more than two hours at the 41st 
American-Antiochian Orthodox convention, which drew about 1,800 
parishioners and priests to Pittsburgh last month. A panel of medical 
experts told the assembly that transmission of disease at communion is 
theoretically possible, but no such case has ever been recorded. 
Priests and communicants were advised to follow rules that forbid 
touching the spoon to mouths or lips. The experts cited earlier studies 
done by Episcopal, Lutheran, and Catholic groups that found the 
practice of "common cup" communion hygienic (NIRR 4/19). Alternative 
communion methods were discussed, but no vote was taken on the matter. 
Delegates were told the issue was decided at a clergy conference in 
October. The conference session was held to allay concerns expressed by 
priests, some of whom said their parishioners hesitate to take 
communion for fear of the deadly AIDS virus. The Antiochian Orthodox 
Church claims 350,000 faithful in the United States and Canada. It is a 
branch of the Orthodox Communion, which embraces 10 ethnic branches and 
serves more than 5 million adherents in North America. 

Thousands of faithful Catholics gathered in Omaha July 25-30 to mark 
the silver anniversary of the church's stand against artificial birth 
control methods. The celebration of the Humanae Vitae (Latin for "Of 
Human Life") was sponsored by the Pope Paul VI Institute for the Study 
of Human Reproduction and the Creighton University School of Medicine. 
The conference focused on the history of birth control, the origins of 
Catholic and Protestant views, and the development of natural family 
planning (NFP) methods, namely abstention from sex during a woman's 
fertile period. The crowd was smaller than the 11,000 expected, but 
participants from more than 20 countries attended. 
...The ban has been unpopular, especially with American Catholics, 
since Pope Paul VI issued it in 1968. Surveys of lay Catholics and 
priests, taken from 1970 to 1993, have consistently found that few of 
the faithful practice only NFP, and some clergy do not insist on its 
adoption. Many have urged the church to drop the ban. 
...But because of strides in reproductive medicine and research since 
NFP's U.S. introduction in 1972, the methods are now more than 99% 
effective, according to Thomas Hilgers, the obstetrician/gynecologist 
who founded and directs the institute. He said the conference would 
strive to make those scientific achievements better known. 
...Mother Teresa of Calcutta, prevented by poor health from appearing 
in person, sent a videotaped message from India. Some 3,000 
participants in the City Auditorium heard her address, in which she 
described contraception as a selfish act, and confirmed the 
encyclical's stand on artificial contraception being against God's 
will, and His "absolute rights as the Author of our life." 
...Two well-known Protestants were among the 40 international speakers 
-- most of them Catholic physicians, ethicists, marriage counseling 
experts, theologians, and NFP instructors. Gary Bauer of the Family 
Research Council in Washington delivered a lecture on The Survival of 
the Christian Family, and author-radio personality Elisabeth Elliot 
explained Christian Stewardship and the Call to Natural Family 
Planning. 

A Christian health group, praised by its subscribers, is being 
pressured by regulators who consider it illegal. Officials in eight 
states have accused the Christian Brotherhood Newsletter of Barberton, 
Ohio, of operating an unlicensed and unsound health-insurance business. 
Christian Brotherhood denies the charge, saying it merely runs a 
network of Christians who follow scriptural mandates to share one 
another's financial burdens. 
...The system operates on subscribers' faith in God and in each other. 
For 11 months a year, subscribers receive postcards directing them to 
submit their fees to a particular person in need. Monthly fees range 
from $50 for individuals, to $100 for a couple, to $150 for a family 
membership. The subscriber whose health-care expenses are being paid 
receives a list of those expected to contribute, and reports to the 
brotherhood if the money is not received. Every 12th month, subscribers 
send their fees to the Ohio office to cover administrative expenses. 
Because the group's literature makes it clear that the brotherhood does 
not guarantee payments, it is not insurance, the contractual transfer 
of risk for a premium. 
..."Christians are people of integrity who want to help other people," 
Christian Brotherhood Vice President Ronald Beers said. "They enjoy 
sending a check to a person a whole lot more than to an organization," 
he said. Many subscribers enclose cards and promises of prayer for the 
ill person along with their checks, which creates a network of caring 
Christians, Beers told NIRR. The brotherhood serves 24,000 subscriber 
families in 49 states, providing for the health needs of some 55,000 
members, Beers said. Subscribers are required to attend church 
regularly, and refrain from smoking, drinking, and homosexual 
lifestyles. A pastor must verify information when a subscriber joins 
the group, and whenever a claim is filed. Beers said Christian 
Brotherhood Newsletter subscribers never have complained about the 
organization. 
...In the past three years, regulators have increased pressure on the 
12-year-old network, leading it to hire attorneys. Critics charge the 
brotherhood could collapse because it has no reserve fund in case of 
large losses. Beers acknowledges that possibility, but says a sudden 
surge in expenses would be met by a small hike in individual 
subscription rates. Steven Humphrey, a co-director of the Gainesville, 
Ga.-based Christian Financial Concepts, also acknowledged the risks. 
"Some churches disintegrate because people lose faith in each other," 
he told NIRR, and the lack of a reserve fund "was a concern that we had 
in the past." But Humphrey and Christian Financial Concepts' founder, 
Larry Burkett, both support the Christian Brotherhood Newsletter. 
..."I finally started to see it for what it is," Humphrey said, adding 
that the brotherhood has baffled insurance companies that don't 
recognize the network's spiritual elements. "Their success depends 
totally and exclusively on helping each other out. Now isn't that just 
like church?" 

Members of the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches 
(UFMCC) were not pleased with President Clinton's July 19 announcement 
of a compromise plan to allow homosexuals, but not homosexual behavior, 
in the military. The 16th General Conference in Phoenix July 18-25 was 
designed as a celebration of the UFMCC's 25-year ministry to the gay 
and lesbian community. But attendees' spirits were dampened by the 
decision. 
..."I am in great pain; I belong to a community betrayed," said David 
Mixner, a longtime adviser and friend of Clinton's. "Our rights were 
sacrificed in favor of political expediency," he told the crowd of more 
than 1,200. He urged gays and lesbians to remind the president that 
their community is "not a disposable commodity to be recycled at the 
next election." According to The Daily, a UFMCC conference newspaper, 
Mixner said each participant "must make a commitment to not leave this 
decade without our freedom." 
..."The lies of Falwell, Robertson, Dobson, Kennedy, and the others 
literally give bashers a license to kill," said Mel White, a former 
ghost writer for evangelical leaders, including Billy Graham and Oliver 
North. In a plenary session, he warned the audience of religious right 
rhetoric, and said that if his "old friends" really loved the sinner, 
but hated the sin, they would meet, talk with, and listen to 
homosexuals rather than "stir[ring] up homophobia and homohatred." 
White is dean of Dallas' Cathedral of Hope, the UFMCC's largest church. 
..."You don't know when you will entertain angels," said UFMCC 
Moderator and founder Troy Perry. As the Angel of God led the Children 
of Israel out of the desert, Perry said, angels are ministering to the 
UFMCC. He cited as evidence the growth and diversity of their 
membership, the opening of several large new churches, and a $200,000 
donation to the New York branch from a man impressed with the UFMCC's 
efforts to feed the hungry. 
...The UFMCC conference had several firsts. It hosted a youth assembly 
that focused on Baby Busters and their needs, and the denomination's 
Samaritan College, along with St. John's College in England, granted 
bachelor of theology degrees to two British pastors. All three of the 
elders the UFMCC membership elected were people of color -- one 
hispanic, one Asian, and one African-American. The church also voted to 
hold its general conference outside North America for the first time; 
the 1997 meeting will be held in Sydney, Australia. 

Efforts to spread Islam in America are increasing, particularly in the 
inner cities and on college campuses, says James Dretke, training 
director for the Pasadena, Calif.-based Zwemer Institute. The American 
Muslim Council estimates that between 4 and 7 million Americans 
practice Islam. Dretke told NIRR that Muslims hold an annual Da'wa, or 
witnessing, conference to plan how to "Muslim-ize" the United States. 
..."In Islam, everything is laid out for you," Dretke said. As 
Americans, especially those who live in chaotic areas like the inner 
cities, seek structure and order in their lives, a specified liturgy 
becomes more appealing, Dretke said. Sharia, the code of behavior for 
Muslims, prescribes all aspects of behavior from divorce to prayer, he 
said. 
...Most of the 25,000 who convert to Islam each year are 
African-Americans, although immigrants from African nations, the Near 
East, and the Indian subcontinent increase the number of Muslims in the 
United States. If these growth trends continue in America, "the pivotal 
issue of the church in the next century will be Islam," and "most of 
our major urban centers will be predominantly Muslim by 2020," said 
Carl Ellis, one of the founders of Project Joseph (PJ). The 
Chattanooga, Tenn., ministry is designed to slow blacks' conversions 
from Christianity to Islam. "We have a hard time keeping up" with the 
demand for a Christian understanding of Islam, he said. 
...American mosques are "loaded with people who grew up in church" 
largely because of "the lousy job" the church has done, Ellis says. "We 
have projected a negative, racist image of Christianity," he told NIRR. 
The gospel actually offers more than eternal fire insurance and meaning 
in life; it addresses economic and social justice, he said. "Most of 
those who convert to Islam are African-American males, who see the 
traditional church as male un-friendly. When we ask them why they left 
the church for Islam, the answer is `The church is too female,' or 
`None of my concerns were addressed.'" 
...To that end, both Zwemer and Project Joseph offer Muslim Awareness 
Seminars to Christians. Using the same materials, Zwemer encourages 
outreach to immigrants, and PJ promotes dialogue with urban Muslim 
converts. PJ's first full seminar was held mid-June at Crenshaw 
Christian Center in Los Angeles. Ellis said the overwhelming response 
of those who attended was, "Where have you been all our lives?" 
...Ellis said the seminars offer church people an understanding of why 
some have converted. They also encourage Christians to talk with 
potential converts to help them "see that their aspirations and 
concerns are adequately addressed in Scripture," and to realize that 
"Christianity is not merely a white man's religion." Ellis said the 
seminars affirm peoples' desires to please God and to live a life of 
integrity. "The people who actually sold slaves to white traders were 
Muslims. Who better to bring a breakthrough to Muslims than us? Like 
Joseph in the Old Testament, we might turn out to be instruments of 
their salvation." 

"You need another conference like you need a hole in the head. But you 
desperately need to hear from heaven," Dallas Seminary Professor Howard 
Hendricks told almost 3,000 men at the Promise Keepers (PK) Shoulder to 
Shoulder Leadership conference July 27-29 at the University of Colorado 
in Boulder. The meetings preceded PK's larger Face to Face weekend 
conference for laymen. Hendricks told the men that to be effective, 
godly leaders in today's world, they need a strong sense of purpose, 
persistence, and self knowledge. He encouraged them to love their work 
and "retain a sense of fun." And he said that ministry leaders must 
take risks. "If you are safe and predictable, you will never inspire 
those around you. There is no finality to failure unless you fail to 
learn." 
...The pastors and leaders were encouraged to re-evaluate how they 
could best impact their families, churches, cities, and nations. 
Speakers told the participants they had to put aside society's 
confusing expectations of men and understand their proper roles and 
identities. "The media portray men as egomaniacs, aggressive, 
workaholics, macho," leaving them feeling "isolated, powerless, and 
angry," said Rod Cooper, a professor at Denver Seminary. Speaker Tom 
Eisenman agreed: "Leadership is a costly call with all the things 
working against us. But if you will be a man of simple faith and humble 
heart, there's a place for you in leadership through God's power. We 
need renewal which begins with repentance, continues in obedience and 
is strengthened by accountability." PK's Steve Farrar told workshop 
participants to change a godless society by taking charge of their 
families. "Be careful with what happens at home. I don't let my 
children watch network TV for the same reason I don't let them drink 
out of the toilet." 
...Reconciliation was a consistent issue on the PK agenda. John 
Perkins, Jessie Miranda, Raleigh Washington, and Glenn Kehrein all 
delivered challenges for leaders to build relationships across racial 
and denominational barriers. "We must be committed to one another, 
intentional in our efforts, and develop a sense of interdependence upon 
one another," said Washington, pastor of Chicago's Solid Rock Church. 
Perkins said that unless the whole church works together "to raise up 
indigenous leadership in urban areas, the crisis will continue." And 
Miranda, an Azuza Pacific College professor, said, "Our mission is to 
go into the combat zone . . . to show compassion, hospitality and 
prayerful attitudes." Otherwise, he said, W.E.B. DuBois' prophecy that 
the century will end in a race war will come true. 
...While the men were learning about their responsibilities, 200 women 
met to pray at Denver's First Church of the Nazarene. Workshop speaker 
David Bryant, director of Concerts of Prayer International and one of 
the few men at the prayer rally, told NIRR he believed this was the 
first meeting of its kind, in which women, from 25 Christian 
ministries, gathered simultaneously to pray for men in ministry. 

"Jesus Christ is the only answer to the world's problems," said Bill 
McCartney, the University of Colorado football coach who founded 
Promise Keepers three years ago. At one of four news conferences, 
McCartney, PK President Randy Phillips, former Exodus Ministries 
President Joe Dallas, and Pastor Raleigh Washington fielded questions 
on the logistics and purpose of the July 30-31 event. Asked about 
Denver's recent surge of urban violence, McCartney said programs and 
legislation "won't solve our problems. Jesus Christ is the way, the 
truth, and the life." 
..."But does Promise Keepers have a political agenda?" newspaper 
reporters asked. Conference speaker E.V. Hill, pastor of Mount Zion 
Missionary Baptist Church in Los Angeles, said, "When we told them that 
we are going to talk about Jesus, they said, 'Is that all?' They just 
don't know how much that is," Hill said. 
...Homosexual rights advocates attracted media attention as the only 
group to protest Promise Keepers. Their rally, organized by the Lesbian 
Avengers and other activists, preceded the first session of the Face to 
Face conference. After American Indian pastor George Tinker prayed for 
"those poor men in the stadium who are trapped in a mindless cycle of 
perpetuating evil and oppression," about 75 protesters marched through 
pouring rain to Folsom Stadium. The marchers blew horns and whistles, 
chanted "No More Hate" and "Go Home Nazis," and carried "Don't Pray For 
Me; Homophobia Is Your Problem," "Bigots For Jesus," and "Gayness Is 
Next To Godliness" signs. 
...Wives of PK staffers provided the protesters with home-made cookies 
and lemonade, while PK staffers' signs asked the thousands of Christian 
men entering the stadium to "Please Treat Protesters With Love and 
Kindness." PK President Randy Phillips "had a surprisingly pleasant 
conversation" with the protest organizers, PK Media Director Kevin 
Skattum told NIRR. He told them that PK would be non-confrontational, 
"and that since we respected their right to protest, we hoped they 
would respect our right to meet," Skattum said. As the protesters 
concluded their rally, the rain stopped and the first Friday evening 
meeting began in sunshine. 

"Never have so many men come together at one time in the name of Jesus 
Christ," Randy Phillips said of Promise Keepers '93. More than 50,000 
men of all ages came from every state and a dozen countries to flex 
their spiritual muscles during a weekend of worship and workshops, 
preaching and prayer, as well as food and fun. James Dobson, 
overlooking the crowd seated in the 98  sun, called the assembly of 
"hairy-chested, testosterone-driven males" one of the "most incredible 
sights I have seen in my whole life." Said PK Founder Bill McCartney, 
"The spirit of the living God is reigning over this place, and it is a 
tremendous blessing." 
...McCartney's intense keynote speech proved that the meeting would be 
more than a patriarchal pep rally. In a call to America's "men of God," 
McCartney said, "We're going to war as of tonight. We will not retreat 
anymore." Jesus Christ is commander-in-chief, but the commissioned 
officers, the clergy, are weary, wounded, discouraged, and afraid to 
preach the truth, he said. "We have to pray fervently for pastors," 
stop criticizing them and start building them up. He urged the troops 
to be full of conviction. "This is a volunteer army, not a draft." He 
urged the men not to join the battle if they couldn't live up to their 
promise to serve. "We are going to contend for the truth of God 
wherever it shows up in our lives. The gates of hell will not prevail." 
He said squads of three to five men will meet once a week to pray, 
study Scripture, and share their pain, and once a month they will meet 
in cross-cultural groups. "If you mess with Satan, who is the father of 
racism, he is going to hit back," McCartney warned. 
...The PK crowd was mostly white, but "we refuse to limit this to a 
middle-class event," Phillips said. Workshop leaders acknowledged that 
uprooting racism will be painful and time-consuming. The church must 
stop "presenting Jesus as though he were an American, as though he were 
a Republican. We must take the American flag off Jesus -- he must 
become King of Kings and Lord of Lords," Tom Skinner said. 
...Believers must work together to reverse the "onslaught against men," 
said Tom Cole, president of the Christian Men's Network. Speakers said 
men need to take responsibility for their lives. "The sins of the 
fathers are visited on the children up to four generations, [but] I'm 
not here to blame my dad," said Gary Smalley, president of Today's 
Family. California pastor and evangelist Greg Laurie said, "Today we 
live in a nation of victims. We're all dysfunctional." He told the men, 
"It's time to stop making excuses and say the three words that changed 
the prodigal's life: I have sinned." When Laurie gave an invitation, 
4,000 men asked for prayer and counseling. 
..."There's a reason why your wives were so enthusiastic about your 
coming here," said Focus on the Family's James Dobson. He said women 
want their husbands to understand three key things: (1) Women are 
incurable romantics; (2) Success and achievement in themselves are not 
all-important; and (3) Wives most want husbands to accept spiritual 
leadership for them and teach the children in the faith.

California pastor Jack Hayford said a woman's flirtations led him to

comes knocking at his door, he says, "Lord, would you mind getting 
that?" E.V. Hill told the audience to get out Scripture, as Jesus did 
in the desert, and say, "Let's get it on, devil." Hill's response 
started a crowd chant of "Hit him. Hit him. Hit him."

Vol. 7, No. 16                                                         
July 26, 1993 

Despite the massive damage caused by widespread flooding in the 
Midwest, relief efforts already have had some bright spots. In what's 
been called "Operation Noah," church volunteers have joined thousands 
of others sandbagging levees as the brown floodwaters of the 
Mississippi and other rivers speed southward. Although "mudding out" 
will take months after the waters recede, most victims hang on to hope. 
 The Salvation Army "sprang into action immediately" in May upriver in 
St. Paul, Minn., said Leon Ferraez, a colonel in the organization. 
Since then, Army workers have aided more than 100,000 people along the 
entire flood area with food, water, housing, and medicine. The St. 
Louis branch is serving 75,000 meals daily from mobile field kitchens. 
"And we expect that number to climb higher," spokeswoman Laura Cook 
told NIRR. The relief agency reports an additional 60,000 people are 
being fed at stationary feeding centers such as churches and community 
centers. A fleet of 29 mobile Salvation Army canteens is distributing 
soup, sandwiches, and hamburgers to flood victims and weary 
sandbaggers. Some 77,000 people were fed in the first two weeks of 
July. More than a dozen Salvation Army emergency shelter centers supply 
housing to about 1,000 flood evacuees. "Even some of the evacuation 
centers had to be evacuated," Ferraez told NIRR. 
...The Salvation Army is working with literally hundreds of other 
churches from all denominations along the Mississippi and Missouri 
Rivers. Volunteers have logged more than 65,000 work hours. In 
comparison to South Florida, where the group still is working, Cook 
said, "It's almost worse here than Hurricane Andrew because it keeps 
happening -- the storm doesn't just blow over. But we've been able to 
meet spiritual needs in the process." The Army expects to be on the 
scene at least six more weeks although it "will help victims get their 
homes and lives back to normal for as long as it takes," Cook said. "We 
have no idea of the money we've spent. We haven't stopped to count the 
cost. Our mission is to provide loving service in the name of a loving 
God. We serve, then pray that the resources will come," Ferraez said.  
Mutual aid among one's neighbors has been a principle practiced for 
generations by Mennonites, Amish, and Brethren in Christ. But some 
coming to the aid of flood victims in the Midwest will come long 
distances -- from places such as California, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and 
Kansas. When the water recedes, "disaster volunteers by the hundreds 
will come out as ways of showing love," said Brenda Wagner of Mennonite 
Disaster Service. The organization also will financially supplement 
federal grants "to help the poorest of the poor," Wagner told NIRR.  
"We learned in Florida after Hurricane Andrew that insect repellent was 
one of the most requested items," World Vision's Cathy Wickman told 
NIRR. WV is also sending rubber boots, water-purification tablets, and 
building supplies as part of its $1.65 million commitment to flood 
relief.  The group is collecting gifts-in-kind from corporate donors, 
and is now distributing $500,000 in emergency supplies with the help of 
Churches United in Global Mission, the Salvation Army, Kansas City's 
Heart to Heart International, and a coalition of churches in Des 
Moines.  Forty evangelical churches in Des Moines joined for a flood 
relief rally Sunday, July 18. They planned the gathering in 
anticipation of the "camaraderie wearing thin" as people began 
returning to an estimated 3,500 destroyed homes and bankrupted 
businesses in the city, said Tom Allen, pastor of the First Federated 
Church, which hosted the rally. The churches requested assistance from 
World Relief in organizing a unified aid response. WR, an affiliate of 
the National Association of Evangelicals, sent Disaster Response 
Director David Loudon to assist in prioritizing needs and identifying 
means of support that the churches can offer. "Compassionate ministry, 
counseling, and just listening are an incredible witness to our faith 
in Christ," Allen said.  Missouri Baptists have been serving nearly 
9,000 meals a day from churches in the St. Louis and Kansas City areas. 
Illinois Baptists are preparing daily 4,000 hot meals that are loaded 
onto Red Cross vehicles and served to sandbaggers and stranded 
residents. Baptists in Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Tennessee 
are recruiting volunteers for additional feeding and cleanup work. 
Construction and mud-out crews will be needed for at least two months. 
In addition, Southern Baptists will spend $25,000 on a water 
purification unit in Des Moines, where residents have been waiting 
several hours each day for a small ration from tank trucks, Baptist 
Press reported.  Feed the Hungry is doing just that. Lester Sumrall's 
relief organization in South Bend, Ind., flew more than 13 tons of 
canned meat and vegetables, shampoo, medical supplies, and disinfectant 
to St. Louis, Mo., July 15, and Church On The Rock in St. Peters, Mo., 
distributed the goods to needy families throughout the state. A July 17 
flight also shipped 15 tons of food, clothing, and baby supplies to ten 
communities along the Des Moines River. FTH also shipped three donated 
water purifiers to Iowa, one to the 6,000 people of Norwalk, who were 
dependent on Des Moines' disabled city water system. FTH is collecting 
citizens' donations and goods at collection points in southern Michigan 
and northern Indiana, and, as are several groups, is taking credit card 
contributions by telephone.  Bishops of the United Methodist Church 
have appealed to church members for contributions to the United 
Methodist Committee on Relief. In addition, local United Methodists 
throughout the Midwest are providing pastoral care and child care, as 
well as meals for flood victims and sandbaggers. UMC disaster 
coordinators have met in several key cities to develop strategies for 
continued aid, and for the eventual cleanup.  The Episcopal Presiding 
Bishop's Fund for World Relief has sent four $25,000 emergency grants 
to areas affected by the flooding rivers. The dioceses to benefit so 
far are Iowa, Missouri, and Quincy and Springfield in Illinois. At 
least six other Episcopal dioceses are likely to require similar aid, 
church officials said.  Consultants from Inter-Lutheran Disaster 
Response have toured cities in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Missouri, and Iowa 
to "call together pastors, get everybody talking, and coordinate with 
the American Red Cross," Paula Ross of the Lutheran Church-Missouri 
Synod told NIRR. The biggest need now is for money, though volunteers 
certainly will be needed after the floodwaters recede, said Elaine 
Richter of LC-MS World Relief. She urged pastors to wear their clerical 
collars for visibility in flood communities, and to make themselves 
available to listen to victims. 
...The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America has sent personnel and 
provided $6,000 emergency grants to victims and ELCA churches in 
Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa, Religious News Service reported. The 
ELCA will collect an offering for its flood relief fund Aug. 1.  "We 
tend not to be the first in, but we will be there for the long haul," 
Joanne Rendall of Church World Services told NIRR. A relief agency of 
the National Council of Churches, CWS has dispatched consultants to 
assess needs in the flooded areas. CWS, which represents 32 Protestant 
and Orthodox groups, will advise member churches and denominations of 
those needs by bulletin, and will collect cash and possibly material 
gifts to distribute through local churches in the flooded areas. In 
response to CWS' open appeal, the United Church Board for World 
Ministries sent $10,000, in addition to more than $18,000 in aid it had 
already sent to United Church of Christ conferences in Illinois and 
Iowa. CWS also has placed seven trained disaster consultants to work 
with interfaith disaster response teams, the Red Cross, and other 
charity groups, according to Religious News Service; and the 
organization will coordinate distribution of Gifts of the Heart 
packages to families. The kits contain bedding, health and hygiene 
products, kitchen supplies, food staples, and other relief items. Other 
NCC denominations, including the Presbyterian Church (USA), also have 
established special relief funds to collect contributions. 

"The floods are the judgment of God," Operation Rescue founder Randall 
Terry told 800 San Jose, Calif., prolifers involved in OR's 10-day 
Cities of Refuge campaign to wipe abortion from seven U.S. cities. The 
anti-abortion activist said that because Americans rejected God by 
murdering babies and approving of homosexuality, they had incurred 
divine wrath, including hurricanes and AIDS. Terry also criticized 
singer Barbra Streisand and California Senators Dianne Feinstein and 
Barbara Boxer, and called President Clinton "an evil man" who should 
"take five minutes" to read his Bible instead of just carrying it 
around. According to news stories, Terry urged the crowd to build the 
United States into "a Christian nation, firmly built on the 10 
Commandments." He said OR was pleased with the turnout of protesters 
and the children its members had saved. 
...The July 9-18 campaign in seven cities drew some 10,000 abortion 
opponents to pro-life rallies, OR sources reported. In some cases, 
abortion-rights protesters outnumbered abortion foes. Close to 600 
abortion opponents were arrested, but there was little or no violence. 
Police in the targeted cities -- Philadelphia, Cleveland, Dallas, 
Minneapolis, Melbourne, Fla., Jackson, Miss., and San Jose -- had 
prepared for large confrontations, but reported having no difficulty in 
containing the demonstrators on either side. 
..."The number that counts is not the number of arrests, but the number 
of children saved," Operation Rescue spokeswoman Wendy Wright told 
NIRR. She reported that in the campaign, "the largest event we've ever 
had," 39 unborn children were saved during the rescues. But Kate 
Michelman of the National Abortion Rights Action League said OR's 
"vigilante terrorists" are losing steam. Other women's group leaders 
and key feminists told news reporters OR's claims of success were 
overstated. 
..."The problem is how secular media portray what we do. We are 
continuing in the same tactics: committed to non-violence and to 
helping women and children in a crisis," Wright told NIRR. Organizers 
said that despite what the secular press said, the group has not 
changed its methods. One news report had said the group was trying to 
regain the confidence of the pro-life movement by holding peaceful 
rallies as a kind of bait-and-switch, in which newcomers would slowly 
be introduced to aggressive tactics. Wright said Operation Rescue 
encourages Christians to come to the rallies to see that they are in 
fact peaceful. "Many in the Christian community have decided to believe 
the secular media rather than their brothers and sisters in regard to 
what we do and why we do it," she said. 
...Operation Rescue has "a record 72,000 arrests without a conviction 
of a violent act at an abortion clinic. We have never been linked to 
any violence -- ever," OR's Patrick Mahoney told NIRR. "We are the most 
peaceful social movement in the history of this country." Some 
Operation Rescue groups have decided not to talk to the press at all. 
In Philadelphia, a "no comment" from leaders in the pro-life movement 
"caused local media to come to the rescue and see for themselves that 
we are not violent, frothing at the mouth, pointy-headed 
fundamentalists and Catholics," William Devlin, director of the 
Philadelphia Christian Action Council, told NIRR. 

"The problem in the American church is a great deal of inreach and not 
much outreach," said Moishe Rosen, executive director of Jews for Jesus 
(JFJ). "The Great Commission is reversed." Rather than speaking 
directly to neighbors, believers "think [they are] supposed to be 
inviting people to meetings" and Bible studies, Rosen told NIRR from 
New York City, where JFJ conducted its yearly, month-long street 
evangelism campaign. In cities across the country, "the proclaimers of 
the gospel have retreated into sanctuaries, places they own and rent," 
Rosen said, and even large crusades have security guards and controlled 
access. Christians, instead, should be "out on the highways and byways 
of life," where they can present the gospel "to people who have not 
made a decision," he said. 
...Rosen said the campaign would "set an example of what can be done" 
with effective literature distribution. In the first week, 25 Jews for 
Jesus workers handed out 356,754 tracts at Rockefeller Center, Wall 
Street, Grand Central Station, Penn Station, 42nd Street, and other 
locations. The result, Rosen told NIRR, was that 114 people made 
first-time decisions for Christ. Simultaneous campaigns in Toronto and 
Paris had about five JFJ workers in each city distributing tens of 
thousands of tracts in the first week, and 31 Torontans, including 
eight Jews, were converted. A similar campaign is planned for Moscow 
later this month. JFJ has conducted urban witnessing projects since 
1974. Last year, nearly 600 people made commitments during campaigns in 
New York, London, and Amsterdam. 
...But street evangelism "is not easy," Rosen said. "Virtually every 
campaigner every day" is the victim of unkind remarks, spitting, or 
kicking incidents. "One out of 300 [people JFJ approaches] becomes very 
irate," he said, and "they usually go after the smaller campaigners or 
the women. A 4'11" deaf-mute has been assaulted four times." 
...Believers cannot always be on the front lines of evangelism, "but 
almost all can do an all-out effort for one month," Rosen said. "They 
discover a capacity for commitment and courage that they didn't have 
before," he told NIRR. "Anybody who is willing to be stretched, and 
extend themselves, and exhaust themselves is going to get a lot more 
done for the Lord." Campaigners from across the country raise $1,500 
partial support, which includes the costs of hotel lodging, food, and 
training at Moody Bible Institute in Chicago. "They just have to do one 
thing: focus on evangelism all month long," Rosen said. JFJ guarantees 
novice witnesses that they "will definitely lead somebody to Christ," 
he said, and "nobody is the same afterward." 

Greg Laurie's Harvest Crusades ended its first of four summer 
evangelistic campaigns with a three-night crusade in San Diego July 11. 
Nearly 150 churches participated in the outreach, which was attended by 
60,000 people, 10,000 more than attended last year's four-day crusade 
(NIRR 8/24/92). Laurie, pastor of 12,000-member Harvest Christian 
Fellowship in Riverside, spoke on How to Change for Good. "Revival is 
our only hope," Laurie told the crowd. "When people find Christ, their 
hearts will be changed. Then their morals will change, and then our 
society will change." Laurie's message, with its references to popular 
culture, particularly appeals to young people. Now 40, he was 19 when 
he began teaching the Bible study at Costa Mesa's Calvary Chapel, out 
of which Harvest Crusades grew in 1990. "His message really hasn't 
changed," Crusade Communications Director Bryan St. Peters told NIRR, 
"and a broad range of age groups come, but those responding in the 
greatest numbers tend to be a younger crowd." St. Peters said Laurie's 
mother married and divorced seven times, and that people in their 20s 
and 30s identify with his life story. In San Diego some 3,755 came 
forward to make personal commitments to Jesus Christ. "That's what we 
were there for," St. Peters said, "to see those lives changed." 
...Laurie's July 23-25 meetings in Orange County, Calif., featured a 
Kids' Crusade, which he expected tens of thousands of children ages 5 
to 12 to attend. As with previous meetings, those attending were asked 
to bring food and clothing donations. Last year's crusades collected 
five tons of food for the San Diego Food Bank, and 25 tons of food and 
clothing for the Hawaii Food Bank for survivors of Hurricane Iniki 
(NIRR 9/21/92). Harvest Crusades will return to Honolulu Aug. 20-22, 
and go to Albuquerque Oct. 7-8. 

Radio-TV preacher Charles Stanley and his wife of 38 years, Anna, have 
separated. Stanley, pastor of Atlanta's 13,000-member First Baptist 
Church and a former Southern Baptist Convention president, informed his 
congregation in a letter that his wife had "filed an action against me, 
and it appears that a separation is now unavoidable." He acknowledged 
that members of the church, which he has pastored for 23 years, might 
have known "that we have been having difficulty for some time." He 
asked members "to be gracious and sensitive by not discussing this 
situation unnecessarily," in order to avoid "hurt and embarrassment for 
both of us." The minister said he is committed to a reconciliation, and 
told the church, "the most helpful thing you could do is pray" that God 
will heal the marriage. 
...Court records show that Anna Stanley filed under Georgia's no-fault 
divorce provision in late June. The minister's attorney later won her 
agreement to amend the lawsuit to seek a legal separation instead, 
sources close to the pastor told NIRR. This month, Stanley's In Touch 
ministry has been airing reruns of sermons he preached earlier, many of 
them about marriage, raising a family according to biblical principles, 
and God's grace. 
...Stanley's is the latest in a rash of marital upheavals among 
high-profile leaders in recent years. In the aftermath, some have seen 
a sharp decline in book sales and outside speaking engagements. "We're 
waiting to see what happens, but we don't expect any dip in sales," 
said a spokesman for Zondervan, one of Stanley's publishers. 

Can local spiritual influences hinder evangelism in a community? 
Participants at the July 9 North American Spiritual Mapping 
Consultation said yes, and offered a methodology for discovering 
specific barriers to soul-winning in North American locales. The 
consultation was sponsored by the Sentinel Group (SG) of Lynnwood, 
Wash., and drew 130 invited pastors, lay leaders, and missionaries from 
30 states and provinces, including representatives from black, Asian, 
Hispanic, and Native American communities. 
...The "growing influence of new and powerful spiritual forces on the 
continent" necessitates such research, said SG President George Otis, 
Jr., who is also co-coordinator for the United Prayer Track of the AD 
2000 and Beyond Movement. Five participants from different cities 
across North America presented their specific research results. A 
Spiritual Mapping Field Guide distributed at the conference outlined 
ways participants could prayerfully research the social bondages, 
allegiances, and spiritual barriers of their respective communities. It 
included 200 discovery questions, methodological cautions, and 
networking recommendations. SG's Lisa Otis told NIRR that the research 
methods include interviews, observation, library backgrounding, and 
prayer logs. The group has planned seven regional meetings in hopes 
that results will help develop effective prayer and evangelism 
strategies. 

Because of budget cutbacks, Colorado jails and prisons are losing most 
of their state-funded chaplains. Effective July 1, the number of 
chaplains was reduced from 13 to six. Sheila Rollins, religious 
coordinator for the Colorado Department of Corrections, told NIRR that 
members of the Colorado Joint Budget Committee convinced the state 
legislature that volunteers from the "Christian community would pick up 
the slack" with religious services at prisons and jails. The six 
chaplains, who serve 9,000 inmates in 19 facilities, are expected 
mostly to recruit volunteers and coordinate activities. Of those six, 
one is a Muslim and two are retirees who will remain on the payroll. 
..."This is going to hurt us. We need the religious influence chaplains 
provide for the inmates. They're still people," Rollins told NIRR. The 
Colorado Department of Corrections was not alone in contesting the 
cuts. Forrest Hubers, state director of Prison Fellowship for Colorado 
and Wyoming, testified before the budget committee and full legislature 
that "the chaplain is the one safe harbor, the one person whom inmates 
are likely to confide in." Volunteer chaplains, he said, would have 
limited access to special custody situations or infirmaries. The 
greatest loss, Hubers said, was not "in measurable dollars," but to the 
community: "once inmates are released, [they] won't have had the impact 
of the chaplain." Hubers told NIRR that chaplains are "very important 
for serenity and peace in a prison." 
...Since other states are monitoring Colorado's corrections cutbacks, 
in November the legislature will evaluate its decision, which included 
a 5% slash in operating costs and laying off two attorneys. In the 
meantime, Prison Fellowship and a new Colorado non-profit group, 
Christian Chaplain Services, are trying to raise funds for volunteers 
who will help provide chaplain services. 

A national teachers' conference, Responding Democratically to Religious 
Agendas, has riled some Christians in Colorado. Public school teachers 
from 15 districts recently attended the national conference, subtitled 
"Right Wing Pressure Groups and School Reform," at a taxpayer cost of 
at least $20,000. 
..."The thrust of this conference was one of overt discrimination 
against a specific class of individuals, namely those who hold 
traditional Judeo-Christian beliefs," said former U.S. Attorney Mike 
Norton. According to a frontpage Denver Post article, Norton has filed 
suit on behalf of several Christian clients. He has asked school 
superintendents to sign an agreement barring future attendance at or 
support of such conferences; his request also condemns similar 
discrimination based on religious beliefs, which are constitutionally 
protected. 
..."If this particular conference had been directed at how to exclude 
other classes of people -- blacks, women or Hispanics -- the entire 
Colorado community would be outraged," said Norton, who expressed an 
interest in First Amendment cases. "Frankly, I'm troubled that there 
can be such a conference directed at what the conferees call the 
religious right." School officials were reported to be unaffected by 
Norton's charges. 

Home schooling is growing 15%-20% a year and hasn't peaked yet, 
researchers on the education trend say. "The movement is beginning to 
come of age," according to Inge Cannon of the National Center for Home 
Education, based in Purcellville, Va. "Ten years ago home schooling was 
being done by a pioneering generation" for grade-school children, but 
is becoming increasingly common for junior high and high school 
students, Cannon told NIRR. Although home schooling is perceived as a 
Christian movement, Cannon said more than 15% of home schoolers have no 
religious motivations for teaching their own children. "There is a lot 
of respect for it among journalists" and those of the "1960s' 
generation of independent thinkers." No official studies have 
determined the number of home-schooled students, but the U.S. 
Department of Education estimates 300,000 children are educated at 
home. Cannon, however, estimates between 600,000 and 750,000 are taught 
outside traditional schools. 
...Opponents of home schooling say it does not offer the same quality 
education as classroom teaching, and does not give children the chance 
to learn social skills. The National Education Association, the 
nation's largest teachers' union, adopted a policy in 1989 that says 
"home school programs cannot provide the student with a comprehensive 
educational experience." But NEA spokesman Charles Ericksen told NIRR 
that the organization has "no problem with home schooling -- with 
safeguards." The union has taken the position that home instructors 
should be licensed by the state, and curriculum be approved by state 
departments of education. 
...Few home schoolers consider close state supervision appropriate or 
necessary. A study by Brian Ray, president of the National Home 
Education Research Institute in Salem, Ore., found no significant 
relationship between parent certification as a teacher and their 
children's academic achievement. Ray told NIRR his study was not a 
criticism of professional educators, but a suggestion that they see the 
positive realities of home schooling. On the average, home-schooled 
students have scored at or above the 80th percentile in reading, 
listening, language, math, science, and social studies on standardized 
measurements, including the California Achievement Test, Iowa Test of 
Basic Skills, and Stanford Achievement Test. Ray also found no apparent 
correlation between achievement and family income, the amount of 
religious content, and hours spent in formal instruction. 
...Criticism that home school students lack proper socialization also 
seems to be unfounded. Researcher Larry Shyers of the University of 
Florida found that home school children socially interact with fewer 
behavioral problems than do public school children. Three other 
investigations separately found home-educated children held more 
positive self-concepts than those of the average conventional school 
student. Other studies showed that home-educated children scored higher 
than their public school counterparts in the areas of communication, 
daily living skills, and socialization. Home-schooled children also 
were less peer-oriented and -dependent than students in private 
schools. 

Fourteen recent graduates from New York Theological Seminary didn't 
just leave with their diplomas in hand. They are all inmates at Sing 
Sing Correctional Facility. The students are serving time for armed 
robbery, murder, drug dealing, or other felonies. They are "incredible 
guys who did something horrendous and then turned their lives around," 
George Webber, NYTS president emeritus, told NIRR. God's grace has 
touched these offenders "in a place where you're taught to trust 
nobody," said Webber, who founded and directs the program in the 
prison. 
...The NYTS program, the only one of its kind in the country, offers a 
master of professional studies degree, about half the credits of a 
master's in divinity, Webber said. NYTS faculty teach rigorous and 
"first-rate" classes at the prison (about a 45-minute train ride north 
from New York City), and credits are transferrable to other seminaries, 
he said. The interdenominational school raises $65,000 a year to fund 
the program, and receives about 50 applications a year for its 16 
openings. In its 10-year history, NYTS' prison program has graduated 
147 Sing Sing theologians. 
...Graduates work as chaplains' assistants, counselors, or tutors until 
they are released. Several have gone on to be ordained ministers. "One 
of the finest guys in the class is the son of a minister who snapped 
one day and killed his wife," Webber told NIRR. The man, who has 19 
years remaining on his sentence, has been hired as a chaplain's 
assistant in another prison. "It takes a unique guy to keep himself 
going," Webber said. The inmates appreciate others' determination as 
well. At this June's ceremony, when each graduate spoke for three 
minutes, the New York Times reported one inmate thanked his mother: 
"It's been 10 long years, Ma, and you're still hanging in there." 

A surprising shakeup at Pat Robertson's Regent University: Although a 
search committee had been considering outsiders, the graduate school's 
board reached into faculty ranks instead and this month chose veteran 
communications professor Terry Lindvall, 45, an award-winning movie 
maker, as president. He will succeed David Gyertson, who left recently 
to assume the presidency of Asbury College. News stories portray 
Lindvall, a Fuller Seminary graduate who rarely wears a tie, as a 
centrist and sometimes critic of the staunch conservatism for which 
Robertson and the school have been known. Trustee Bob Slosser, a former 
Regent president, told reporters that Lindvall is a "contemporary 
communicator" whose appointment is perceived as a "breath of fresh 
air." 
...In another shift, the board removed Herbert Titus as dean of 
Regent's college of law and government, and offered him an endowed 
chair in the law faculty. Sources at 1,400-student Regent said the 
offer was a $300,000 package that included staff support along with 
travel, research, and writing opportunities, plus a year's paid 
sabbatical to prepare for the transition. Titus, a Harvard law graduate 
who shaped Regent's law school, turned down the offer. At a noisy 
campus meeting last week, trustees said they then dismissed him and 
gave him three years' severance pay. Angry law students peppered board 
members with questions, demanding to know why Titus -- the reason many 
of them chose Regent -- was removed as dean. There was speculation that 
board members, worried about accreditation and the ability to attract 
larger numbers of students, wanted to broaden the school's perspective 
and tone down its conservative emphasis, and they felt that Titus, an 
idealogue, was too unbending in his approach. The trustees denied that 
the 15-year-old university was veering from its conservative past and 
biblical moorings, but they said they could not provide an answer the 
students would understand. A recent graduate who attended the meeting 
said it "was the most emotional day on campus ever." Titus was not 
available for comment. 

The number of career American missionaries abroad is shrinking for the 
first time in 50 years. The latest edition of the Mission Handbook 
reports that in 1988 50,500 long-term missionaries worked in other 
lands; by 1992, the number had dropped to 41,142, according to the 
Missions Advanced Research and Communication Center. MARC, which 
produces the triennial publication, is a branch of World Vision in 
Monrovia, Calif. 
...Despite the drop, North American missions agencies are just as 
active in overseas evangelism as before, said John Siewert, editor of 
the handbook. Their involvement, he said, may be through cooperative 
partnerships to provide resources, financial support, or short-term 
missions rather than longer, more permanent commitments. 

Five new evangelical churches are founded every week in Rio de Janeiro, 
and about 90% of these are Pentecostal, according to Brazil's first 
detailed religious census. Ruben Cesar Fernances, an anthropologist at 
the city's Institute for Religious Studies, which conducted the study, 
calls this "the most important ideological involvement in Brazil in 
decades." He told the Los Angeles Times that the latest generation of 
Pentecostal ministers are Brazilian, and, considering the current 
growth trend, the country could do without 2,700 of the 3,000 
missionaries still there. Caio Fabio d'Araujo Filho, head of the 
Brazilian evangelical association, said between 35 and 40 million 
people attend evangelical churches each week in the predominantly 
Catholic country (NIRR 3/22). In Rio alone, evangelicals run 39 
bookstores, and own 12 radio stations that broadcast 196 radio 
programs. In May, an evangelical congressman bought an FM radio station 
for $4.5 million and renamed it Christ at Home Radio, d'Araujo said. 
Other Latin American countries see similar church growth; the Worldwide 
Evangelization Crusade calculates that evangelical membership is 
growing by 7%-9% annually in Peru, Bolivia, and Mexico. 

The Argentine government's closing of three Christian radio stations 
has non-Catholic broadcasters calling for reform of broadcast law. The 
Law of Radio Broadcasting was designed by a former dictatorial regime 
to suppress political dissent, and authorizes only income-generating 
radio broadcasting, according to news reports. Oswaldo Casati, 
president of the Association of Evangelical Social Communicators, 
estimated that, as a result, Protestant churches in Argentina run 
nearly 100 unlicensed non-profit stations, leaving them vulnerable to 
the law, which had not been consistently enforced. Meanwhile, 
constitutional government support of the Catholic faith has facilitated 
government licensing for the Catholic Church to broadcast from 90 new 
radio frequencies. Critics of the Federal Committee for Radio 
Broadcasting charge the government body with practicing religious 
discrimination, but Casati noted that most of the Catholic stations are 
commercial, and, therefore, indisputably legal. 

The film Jesus soon will have company in the Middle East. In hopes of 
duplicating Campus Crusade's success with its evangelistic film, a 
consortium of Christian ministries is producing a series of 90-minute 
videos filmed in the Holy Land. The Far East Broadcasting Company, 
Middle East Christian Outreach, the Southern Baptist Foreign Mission 
Board, the Christian Broadcasting Network, Arab World Ministries, and 
Middle Eastern Ministries recently distributed some 2,500 copies of the 
first of the films, God is Love, in Egypt. Narrated in Egyptian Arabic, 
the feature-length movie which recounts Old Testament stories met with 
enthusiastic response in Egypt and in northern Iraq, Baptist Press 
reported. The film will be dubbed into several languages of the Middle 
East, where sponsors hope 6-7 million viewers, many of them previously 
unreached, will see it on television. The consortium is raising funds 
to begin the series' second film, the Luke 15 story of the prodigal son 
retold in a contemporary setting. 
...All three Lebanese television stations have agreed to air 26 
half-hour Christian programs. Lebanese Baptists joined with Southern 
Baptists, Arab World Ministries, and Middle East Christian Outreach to 
produce the shows, which will deal with situations the Lebanese people 
face since their country's civil war is over. Mass communication 
students from Beirut University helped research background material, 
and Lebanese Baptists will serve as on-air talent. The programs will 
feature Christian psychiatrists who suggest solutions to everyday 
problems. 
...Christian correspondence courses are crossing Middle Eastern 
national and religious borders, say the program coordinators, Hugh 
Provost, a Southern Baptist representative in Cyprus, and Samuel 
Kharrat, a Lebanese Baptist pastor in Beirut. They share duties for the 
five-course Bible program designed for Arabic speakers. The program 
gathers the names of interested parties from referrals by radio 
programs and personal contacts of evangelical organizations, and 
through ads in magazines recruits participants who wish to study the 
Bible. At least 500 are enrolled, few of whom will complete the course, 
the Baptists said, but in 1992, they reported more than 1,500 
information requests, with response rates highest from Muslim Sudan, 
Algeria, Syria, and Saudi Arabia. 

Protestant groups are petitioning Russian President Boris Yeltsin as he 
considers church-state legislation passed by parliament July 14. If 
Yeltsin signs the act into law by the July 28 deadline, foreign 
religious bodies will be required to gain special accreditation, or 
operate under the auspices of existing Russian religious bodies, 
whether they send ministers into Russia or merely ordain (or hire) 
Russian workers to carry out their ministries (NIRR 2/8). Since 
enactment of Freedom of Conscience legislation in 1990, Russia has 
experienced a great influx of Western religious activity. Some estimate 
more than 1,000 ministries are at work in the former Soviet state. 
While most are Protestant groups, Catholic, Mormon, the Unification 
Church, and Hare Krishna organizations are reported to be active as 
well. 
...The Russian Orthodox Church reportedly backed the new law as a 
balanced approach to non-traditional religion, while some Protestant 
critics vilified it as a step back toward totalitarian control. In 
recent months, Orthodox leaders have criticized the availability of 
Russian broadcast media to moneyed evangelical ministries. 
...A campaign to dissuade Yeltsin from signing the bill began on July 
15 when he was presented pleas from the leaders of six Protestant 
Russian denominations in Russia. The pro-Yeltsin Russian newspaper 
Izvestia attacked the new statute and the attempt by Orthodox leaders 
to trade religious supremacy for religious freedom. Five members of the 
U.S. Congress, led by Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), reportedly have sent 
their objections to Yeltsin, as have nearly two dozen British members 
of Parliament, according to news reports. Before the Supreme Soviet 
acted, some 50 foreign Christian organizations and denominations 
already were voluntarily registered in Russia.  Although they may 
retain their legal operating status, many endorsed the call for 
Christians to contact the White House, Congress, the Russian Embassy, 
and Yeltsin's office in attempts to influence the Russian president not 
to sign the act. 

Two of three Americans give to charitable causes in a typical month, 
according to a 1993 Barna poll. Of those donating, two-thirds do so 
through church collections. Some 27% respond to face-to-face appeals, 
26% to mail appeals, and 13% to telephone solicitations. Of adults, 18- 
to 27-year-olds are most likely to make contributions through automatic 
payroll deductions, at a 29% rate, compared with 19% for all adults. 
...Total giving by individuals, corporations, and foundations in 
America has increased by 250% over the past four decades, according to 
Kimberly Dennis, executive director of Indianapolis-based Philanthropy 
Roundtable. At a seminar at Hillsdale College in Michigan, Dennis said 
the tremendous increase in giving to non-profits in the 1980s may have 
been spurred by the lower tax burden on the business sector, and the 
public's motivation to compensate for a perceived reduction in 
government spending on the public welfare. 
...Outside America, non-profit charities are scarce. Private 
philanthropy is almost non-existent in non-democratic societies and in 
Europe, where social services are largely provided by the state, Dennis 
said. Reformers in formerly communist regimes have asked her for ways 
to start such a non-profit or "independent" sector in their societies. 
She advised them that business must be unencumbered by government to 
produce the needed prosperity. Second, they need to avoid a monolithic, 
nuturing government that "saps individuals of the initiative to take 
responsibility for their own and others' welfare." 

Christian Book Industry Continues Growth by Edward E. Plowman 

The 44th annual Christian Booksellers Association (CBA) international 
convention attracted a record turnout in Atlanta this month. On hand 
for one of the nation's largest trade shows were more than 12,600 
registrants, representing more than 2,600 Christian bookstores and 
hundreds of publishers and suppliers. Participants learned both basics 
and advanced technology of the trade in dozens of workshops. They 
placed orders at discount prices at display booths along four miles of 
aisles, stood in long lines for authors' autographs (often with a free 
book included), sniffed out trends (Christian fiction is still strong, 
for one), sampled the latest in Christian music at inspirational 
rallies, and swapped stories over punch and cookies at publishers' 
receptions. There was little talk of recession-driven cutbacks, and a 
number of publishers reported record sales for a CBA convention. 
Analysts said annual sales at some 5,000 religious bookstores across 
the country are approaching $3 billion, up from $1 billion in 1980. CBA 
organizers circulated a prediction by pollster George Gallup that the 
largest sales increases for non-fiction books in the next century will 
be in religious books, at 82%. 
...For years, Bibles were the bread and butter of the trade, and 
although they account for $400 million in sales annually, according to 
analysts, fewer people may be reading what they buy. At a press 
conference featuring a panel of Bible publishers, researcher George 
Barna said his studies indicate that in a typical week, 75 million 
people, or 34% of the U.S. population, read the Bible outside of a 
church service, down from 42% several years ago. Said Ronald Beers of 
Tyndale: "The Bible is probably the most purchased but least-read book 
in America." The typical Bible buyer today is a Baby Buster, born 
between 1965 and 1983, Barna said. These younger buyers show little 
loyalty to old established lines, and there seems to be a declining 
awareness of the various versions among them, he added. Barna also said 
a new study shows that one in three people rely on the King James 
Version (KJV) the most, even though it is above the literacy skills of 
most Americans. A Tyndale spokesman said The Living Bible has surpassed 
the 38 million mark in circulation, and a Zondervan representative said 
that 85 million copies of the New International Version (NIV) have been 
circulated since its introduction in 1978. A study last year found that 
42% of NIV owners read the Bible daily, compared with only 18% of KJV 
owners, the Zondervan spokesman said. 
...About 450 different translations and versions of the Bible are 
available in English, a CBA source estimated. Many of them are "study 
Bibles" with notes geared to target audiences. Additionally, there are 
hundreds of specialedition Bibles aimed at market niches. Thomas Nelson 
alone boasts more than 1,000 different offerings, a Nelson spokesman 
said. At the top of the industry's best-seller list of study Bibles is 
Zondervan's NIV Women's Devotional Bible, with more than 200,000 in 
print since its introduction a year ago, according to Zondervan 
executive Doris Rikkers. A Men's Devotional Bible was introduced in 
March, but since women are the main buyers of Bibles, sales appeals 
will be aimed at women, encouraging them to buy Bibles for their men, 
Rikkers told reporters. 
...Much of the recent infighting between retailers and suppliers seems 
to have subsided, according to a report by CBA Chief Executive William 
Anderson. To resolve differences, a joint task force of the CBA and the 
Evangelical Christian Publishers Association (ECPA) last winter 
recommended a series of guidelines. Among them: publishers should 
refrain from listing suggested retail prices on books and in 
advertising, and retailers should seek ways to improve profits other 
than by inflated markups of products; as publishers seek to broaden 
their outreach through direct marketing, they should try not to 
undermine retailers, and they should find ways to allow resellers to 
make the same competitive offerings through their stores; to reduce 
paperwork, delays, and risks for retailers, a liberal returns policy 
should be instituted, and steps should be taken to standardize and 
streamline ordering and other communications between stores and 
suppliers. Many publishers already have implemented the 
recommendations, Anderson said. 
...A survey by Innovative Resources for CBA and ECPA found that more 
people are shopping at CBA stores more often and are buying more 
products each time they're in the store, with CBA retailers reaching 
33% of the people actively engaged in church, up from 25% five years 
ago, Anderson reported. "Pastors and other ministry leaders care about 
what happens to their people during the week, and more of them are 
realizing that the Christian bookstore can have an important role," he 
told NIRR. The survey also found that many people who read their Bible 
daily are not readers of even high-profile Christian books, and that 
many so-called heavy book consumers who are Christians are not 
consumers of Christian books. "There's plenty of room for growth," 
Anderson said. 
...In finances, CBA reported revenues and expenses of $2.97 million 
last year, with investments accounting for most of its $203,000 net 
income. The figures do not include CBA's for-profit subsidiary, 
CBA-Service Corp. most of its $203,000 net income. The figures do not 
include CBA's for-profit subsidiary, CBA-Service Corp.

Vol. 7, No. 15                                                         
July 12, 1993 

A Western Pennsylvania Baptist pastor says his prayers for revival are 
being answered -- but not in the way he expected. In the Shenango 
Valley, steelworkers and business executives are collaborating with 
churches of all kinds in an effort to revive a bankrupt foundry. 
Citizens of the valley are revitalizing their communities in other 
ways, too, according to First Baptist Church Pastor Arthur Fuller. The 
community is experiencing a spiritual and cultural renewal, in the name 
of Christ, Fuller told NIRR. 
...When Fuller moved to the area north of Pittsburgh in 1990, it was 
depressed economically and spiritually. But, he said, the Lord gave him 
a vision to pray for revival, which he called the Shenango Valley 
Offensive: "to proclaim in the valley that Jesus Christ is Lord, so 
that the valley will become known for providing workers for God as she 
has been known for providing workers for the steel mills." For two 
years he met weekly with two small groups of three to five people to 
pray for the residents of the area. Fuller hung a banner announcing 
that vision for the valley in front of his 60-member church in 
Sharpsville, he said, half-expecting God to send an evangelist to 
another church to spark a spiritual outpouring. 
...But, instead, sparks began to fly when the foundry filed for 
bankruptcy and closed its doors with only two days' notice on March 5, 
1993. The union president, a First Baptist parishioner, invited his 
pastor to address the distressed workers who were holding sit-ins and 
prayer services at the plant. Fuller told them they needed unity with 
each other and the support of their community. He sent a letter with 
the same message to 20 area pastors and priests; 16 attended his 
revival prayer meeting that Thursday. 
...Discussion and prayer among the pastors inspired them to try to 
raise about $1 million, the collateral needed to purchase the bankrupt 
foundry for the former employees. Members of the clergy -- 
Presybterians, independent fundamentalists, Catholics, Methodists, 
Baptists, and others -- had raised nearly $400,000 in short-term loans 
for their new ANB (A New Beginning) trust fund by June 30. The 
community group and the former plant owner soon will sign a purchase 
agreement for the company, Sharpsville Quality Products. According to 
the plan, the reopened foundry also will contribute to the ANB Trust. 
The trust will continue to operate as a revolving loan fund to 
underwrite other promising community enterprises in hopes of restoring 
single-earner family-level incomes to the Shenango Valley, Fuller told 
NIRR. Community enthusiasm is overwhelming, as are contributions to 
what some called "an overly simple idea," Fuller said. Other companies' 
employees reportedly have asked to donate to ANB through new automatic 
payroll deductions. 
...The Shenango Valley Offensive gave researchers an interesting study 
case. Fuller said a Louisiana economist and Catholic scholar, Ed 
O'Boyle, told him that his investigations of plant closings and 
reopenings showed few cases with such high levels of community support. 
Fuller said businesses are considering relocation to the region, which 
had been avoided because of its reputation for horrible 
labor-management relations. 
...The people in steel country "have taken control of their own 
destiny, which had been torn up by absentee ownership, greed, and 
strife," the pastor said. "The whole culture of this region is being 
turned around in the name of Christ. True spiritual revival affects the 
whole person and the whole society." Dozens of plant workers are said 
to openly profess Christ, and workers frankly discuss what God is doing 
in their spiritual lives. Fuller said the changes that started in the 
workplace are spreading to the churches. In a region where churches 
have seldom had programs for their own youth, much less outreach into 
the community, he said a new move is afoot for a joint outreach to 
young people in the area. Fuller sees the newness as "God's 
initiatives. We saw what God was doing and we got on board there. When 
Christians operate in unity, the whole world will know that the Father 
has sent the Son." 

A warehouse in South-Central LA is now home to the Mt. Zion Computer 
Learning Center, a joint ministry of E.V. Hill's Mt. Zion Missionary 
Baptist Church and Franklin Graham's Samaritan's Purse. The Christian 
leaders see the center as a way to help rebuild and strengthen Los 
Angeles one person at a time. The center's goal is to provide 
vocational, social, and spiritual training to inner-city youth and 
adults who need job skills, the Los Angeles Times reported. By doing 
so, Hill and Graham hope to empower the students, some of whom are 
former substance abusers, to build or rebuild their lives, and to make 
contributions to society by becoming working members of the community. 
...The center houses 10 workstations, where four shifts of students 
spend two hours each day learning basic mathematics and computer 
literacy. The self-paced NOVA training program features video-phonics, 
word processing, multimedia tools, and software tutorials. NOVA was 
designed by Innovative Learning Systems founder Ronald Gonzalez, who 
trained Mt. Zion's staff members for free. Staffers also offer students 
instruction in remedial reading and writing, and counsel participants 
on motivation, attitude, and personal hygiene. The center's instructors 
have been working with 20 students for several weeks, but the program 
can work with 40 students per session, Graham said. 

LA's newest Christian school will educate kindergarteners through 
eighth-graders in a fully-paid $1.2 million building, thanks to World 
Impact (WI). Watts Christian School is the second K-8 begun by the 
inner-city ministry that Fuller Seminary student Keith Phillips began 
in 1965 after the Watts riots. WI's Los Angeles Christian graduated 12 
students in 1991; six scored in the upper 10% of a national high school 
entrance exam, making them eligible to enter exclusive, predominantly 
white Bel Air Preparatory School. "I'll take all the kids you can give 
me," Bel Air's principal, who sought qualified minority students, told 
World Impact. Together, the boards of both organizations underwrite all 
but $25 of each student's monthly tuition. A female Hispanic graduate 
last year qualified for entrance into the prestigious California 
Academy for Math and Science, which annually accepts no more than two 
students from any school; a second student qualified this year. Dave 
Karber, WI's outgoing volunteer director of LA ministry, told NIRR the 
ministry plans to start a high school into which both K-8 schools will 
feed. WI will not start the project until all the finances are 
committed. However, other educational projects have attracted local 
support, including a fund-raising luncheon for 40 pastors that former 
Mayor Tom Bradley hosted at City Hall at his own expense. 
...The schools are a byproduct of World Impact's primary focus, to 
plant indigenous churches. Its first church, with 170 African-American 
and Hispanic members, just turned over its leadership to two Los 
Angeles pastors who will minister in English and Spanish. This fall, a 
nucleus of adults and children hopes to form a second, Hispanic church, 
with a pastor who came to Christ through one of World Impact's popular 
Bible clubs for teens. In cooperation with World Impact, Azusa Pacific 
College professors hold classes in the inner city for pastors of 
churches there. Both hope to have facilities for university students to 
come live, work, and teach for a semester in the inner city. 
...The organization seems to have earned the respect of the inner-city 
LA residents it serves. On the outside wall of World Impact's Vermont 
Avenue headquarters is an air-brushed picture of a city skyline, with a 
cross in the background. No graffiti has ever appeared on this wall. 
During last year's riots, when buildings on the half block surrounding 
the headquarters were broken into, looted, and burned, World Impact 
buildings were left untouched. 
...World Impact met this year's $650,000 budget entirely through gifts 
of individuals, churches and foundations. The funds will allow WI to 
run, in addition to its Los Angeles ministries, its thrift shops in 
several cities; provide low-cost medical and dental care at its Wichita 
clinic; operate two campgrounds, with two-year programs to disciple 
inner-city boys and teach them practical job skills; train urban 
residents to develop and run small businesses; and operate a K-6 
Christian school in Newark, N.J. 

Homelessness would be less of a problem in America if the church would 
repent of its racism, according to George Caywood, president of Los 
Angeles' 102-year-old Union Rescue Mission. Caywood left a managerial 
position with the Marriott Corporation 20 years ago to minister full 
time to the homeless. Today, in addition to meeting daily survival 
needs, Caywood and the mission staff provide financial, intellectual, 
spiritual, and emotional support for hundreds of homeless men, women, 
and children in LA and its surrounding areas. 
..."The baseline defense against the pain of street life is a sense of 
hopelessness," Caywood said in a recent newsletter interview, "but 
what's happening is that the community is gradually waking up to the 
reality that -- for its own sake -- it needs to get involved." Caywood 
believes that if ongoing racist attitudes in the church toward one 
another and toward the homeless don't change, "this city is going to 
come down." He defines racism as "prejudice plus power," and says the 
unempowered "can't be racist. If the people of God would repent of 
racism, that would do more to move America toward the Lordship of Jesus 
Christ than anything else I can imagine." 

The United Church of Christ is planning a new push for racial and 
ethnic diversity. Although UCC policies declare racism a sin, support 
affirmative action in church employment, start new churches in racial 
and ethnic communities, and provide multilingual resources, the 
denomination's racial and ethnic membership has remained frozen at 6%. 
The UCC's Commission for Racial Justice will caution member churches 
during its Synod this month that America's demographics are changing 
rapidly. "European-American values and culture are dominant today," but 
if current trends continue "some time in the 21st century European 
Americans will become a minority in the U.S.," said the commission's 
Charles Lee. "A multicultural society understands that each group has 
its own gifts and contributions to make and values them on their own 
terms." American society is "at a crossroads," Lee said. "The present 
tensions that exist along the lines of race become extremely divisive 
and even fratricidal. But the future is in our hands. We have the 
ability to bring about a much greater understanding" among diverse 
groups. 

"Help others do as much for themselves as possible -- but never, ever 
do for others what they can do for themselves," is the "iron rule" of 
Johnny Ray Youngblood, who runs one of the most dynamic 
African-American ministries in the country. The pastor of St. Paul's 
Community Baptist Church in Brooklyn's Brownsville (one of New York's 
toughest neighborhoods), Youngblood has used the rule in his 20-year 
crusade to improve the lives of impoverished people and turn their 
dreams into reality. He originally organized a coalition of 50 
Catholic, Protestant and Jewish churches and synagogues to pool their 
resources. The group, East Brooklyn Congregations, was able to turn an 
abandoned section of Brooklyn into a working community of 
owner-occupied houses. 
...The development, known as Nehemiah housing, became a model for 
similar projects in 14 cities around the country, and in England and 
South Africa. Among the communities are a 3,000-home area in Boston, 
and a 1,000home development in Prince Georges County, Md. Another 1,300 
homes are planned for early next year in Spring Creek, N.Y., and a 
similar development is being built in Baltimore. Youngblood also heads 
a network known as Industrial Areas Foundation Affiliates, which fights 
for job and scholarship incentive programs, water and sewer facilities, 
a higher minimum wage, better schools, health centers, and drug and 
gang strategies around the country. 

A symposium on the future of black evangelicalism saw harsh critics and 
bemused academics cross swords and pass torches at Geneva College June 
24-26. Participants said the event, held to honor the late Chicago 
urban minister William Bentley, marked the transition of power from the 
old founders of the National Black Evangelical Association (NIRR 5/3) 
to a younger group of leaders who hope to emphasize evangelism as well 
as social ministries. "We're changing the guard," said conference 
organizer Malcolm Newton, program director for Urban Theological 
Studies in Philadelphia. "They don't want to pass the baton, so we have 
to take it from them," he said. Harvard Divinity School Professor 
Eugene Rivers blasted fellow academics who fail to "take their theology 
back to the bush . . . out of Princeton and into Newark." He and other 
inner-city ministers demanded the creation of public policy and 
resultsoriented studies to meet the needs of poor urban blacks. As 
evidence that such programs work, they shared success stories of 
ministries to Muslims in Atlanta, gang members in Boston, and single 
mothers in Detroit. 

Latin America is becoming so destitute that it cannot be called a 
developing Third World area, said Valdir Steuernagel, a Lutheran 
Brazilian pastor and denominational director for the Centre for 
Pastoral and Mission Studies. He said the absolute poverty of Latin 
America's poor made "the Fourth World" a more accurate description, 
noting "that is the direction much of the Third World is moving." 
...But he added, "This is the hour of God for Latin America." He said 
as people increasingly come to church, especially charismatic churches, 
they bring "their lives and needs." Health care is one area in which 
Christians can help, but "if the church is not willing to do this, the 
poor will have to continue to die," Steurnagel said. Helping these 
people, the pastor said, is "where Jesus would spend most of his time." 
...Telling the poor that Jesus will make them rich is "sheer heresy" 
South American theologian Rene Padilla says. "A new brand of gospel 
message in Latin America" attracts many poor people and even the 
well-to-do, he said. Telling the poor that "economic improvement is 
part and parcel of the gospel -- you can expect to become prosperous" 
is an attractive illusion, he told a MAP International conference, but 
"the church has no future in this." 
..."The church has a future [in Latin America] to the extent to which 
it becomes identified with people and their suffering," said Padilla, a 
native of Ecuador who lives in Argentina. "Talking about the needs of 
the poor used to be seen as Marxist, but now it is much more common for 
churches to be involved in social service projects," he said, noting 
"an awakening of social conscience in many churches." 
...Criticizing the Latin American Catholic church for its long-standing 
identification with the wealthy and the powerful, Padilla suggested 
that the development of base communities would have led to a 
"tremendous decentralization of power," but the Catholic church has 
"very much limited" such efforts. Consequently, some leaders, 
disillusioned by the church's "authoritarian" attitudes, have converted 
to Protestantism. As a reaction to the defections, Padilla said the 
church has clamped down harder on parishioners, and replaced 
progressive bishops. "If we only had a vision of what power means from 
a Christian perspective, we would avoid many problems. Power is linked 
with servanthood. The Body grows in mutual submission, mutual 
accountability under Christ." 
...Inadequate discipleship leads some converted Catholics to leave 
Protestant faiths, especially Pentecostal ones. Padilla said something 
is wrong if new believers "come through the front door and leave 
through the back door," and they describe their Pentecostal faith as a 
past experience. Evangelical churches, he said, are not equipped to 
give pastoral care to so many people, and "there is a lot of 
superficiality in Pentecostalism." Padilla, who has served in several 
key evangelical groups, noted that 80% of Protestant pastors in Latin 
America have no formal training, but new programs are training leaders 
to teach and to disciple their flocks. 

Crusades to Cuba will include humanitarian projects, according to two 
church leaders who recently returned from the Communist Caribbean 
island nation. Paul Montacute, executive director of Baptist World Aid, 
and T. L. Lowery, senior pastor of the 5,000-member National Church of 
God, Washington, visited Havana in May and June, respectively. 
Montacute said Cuban government and church officials welcome relief aid 
from American church organizations. Lowery, former assistant general 
overseer of the Church of God (Cleveland, Tenn.), received government 
approval to conduct crusades in several Cuban cities, including Havana, 
this fall. Along with the evangelistic meetings, they will distribute 
$100,000 worth of food, medicine, and other relief supplies. Several 
denominations and relief groups already have shipped humanitarian aid 
to economically distressed Cuba. 
...Cuba's evangelical churches have nearly doubled attendance figures 
in the past year, and evangelicals number about 1 million among the 
island's 10.5 million citizens, according to Albert Ehmann, executive 
director of Worldteam Canada, and a regular traveler to the country. He 
told World Pulse that the government has eased prohibitions against 
construction or repair of church buildings, and has implemented a 
permissive policy regarding house churches and home Bible study groups. 
...The excitement, devotion, and commitment of Cuban Christians is 
deep, says Joe Lopez, founder of Misiones Internacionales Hispanas, a 
Southern Baptist-backed ministry in Lubbock, Texas. In light of the 
Castro regime's present frailty, Lopez cautions visiting ministries to 
avoid military terms such as spiritual warfare, the armour of God, and 
crusade. Since the church has been sheltered, he said, it may be 
unprepared for the flood of disorienting Western values that could come 
with a government collapse, but Lopez is optimistic about Cuban 
believers' commitment. 

"A miracle took place in the slums," said Kiran Martin, an Indian 
physician who created community health and development programs in New 
Delhi, India, shanty colonies. The terrible living conditions defy 
description, she told delegates at a MAP International convention. Two 
million of New Delhi's people live in overcrowded, 50-square-foot huts. 
Refuse, flies, and mosquitoes are everywhere. One watering point serves 
500 people, who also suffer from poor sanitation. Health care is 
supplied mainly by quacks and local healers -- at poor quality and high 
cost, Martin said. 
...Martin's ministry began with a small clinic -- a table, a chair and 
a suitcase full of medicine, in the Ambedkar colony of New Delhi in 
1988. Raised as a "heathen" Hindu, she said God planted "a deep love" 
in her heart for the poor after her conversion at age 16. Her work, 
ideas, and enthusiasm quickly burgeoned. Thirteen health centers in the 
slums provide medical attention for 150,000 people. In the programs 
Martin started and still oversees, 80% to 90% of the patients are 
immunized against disease. Pregnant women receive care, and family 
planning is taught and practiced. Both the World Bank and Indian 
government have imitated Martin's model programs. 
...The doctor said she wants to help empower slum-dwellers to change 
the conditions that create sickness, not just dispense medicine. 
"People don't have any power to change their lives. Their participation 
is never sought on any level." One barrier to ministry in the slums was 
opposition from the powerful slum lords, who are "abusive, aggressive, 
violent drunkards, many of whom have criminal records," Martin said. 
"Love was the thing that broke all barriers. Our relationship with even 
these criminals began to get stronger." 
...A principal focus has been helping women, who bear the burdens of 
child-raising and family life, to make permanent changes. Slum women 
are politically organized, and have elected leaders among themselves. 
With government help, they have turned six stagnant, disease-infested 
ponds into parks -- an exciting change for "children who had never been 
to a park," Martin said. Women maintain a community latrine and have 
established day-care centers, vocational education, and small 
businesses. They meet regularly "to share the joys and sorrows of their 
lives." 
...Many slum dwellers have accepted Christ, Martin said. "They have 
begun to feel that their lives are worthwhile, and have begun to 
interact with each other in a new way." She said the fight to survive 
the selfishness of the slums has changed to a more cooperative, 
harmonious way of life. Individuals who felt useless have gained a new 
perspective. Although Christians comprise a tiny minority of India's 
900 million people, the church runs hospitals, health centers, 
community programs, medical colleges, and schools of nursing, often in 
areas where no one else would go. "It is because the Lord loved these 
people that he intervened," Martin said. 
...At least 3,000 Christians marched on Good Friday by special permit 
through Ahmadabad, a city that was torn by Hindu-Muslim rioting last 
year. According to London-based Operation Mobilisation, the procession, 
which marked the beginning of a seven-year program to reach the 
industrial city of 4 million, was backed by 30 churches representing 
Methodist, Alliance, Salvation Army, and other religious groups. 

Female infanticide and abortion in India are increasing, according to a 
recent report by AD 2000 Global Monitor. "Mix together social prejudice 
against girl children, a dowry system that can wipe out a family's 
savings, availability of amniocentesis testing, and legal abortion and 
the result is ghastly," the newsletter said. One survey of a Bombay 
clinic showed that of the 8,000 abortions performed in the late 1980s, 
7,999 were of female babies. Assuming that Indian Christian families 
follow a different, more life-affirming ethic, the newsletter concluded 
that evangelizing India is a matter of life and death for millions of 
unborn female babies. 

Thousands of Muslims and Buddhists reportedly accepted Christ at 
rallies in southwestern India amidst opposition this spring, according 
to the Carrollton, Texas-based Gospel For Asia mission agency. Although 
it was threatened, the mission organized rallies in the predominantly 
Muslim and Buddhist state of Kerala. GFA chose the area because of 
positive mail response to evangelistic radio broadcasts by its 
Indian-born president, K.P. Yohannan. He and his native missionary 
staff were reportedly threatened by political and religious terrorist 
groups; GFA told NIRR that devout Muslims distributed literature 
opposing the Christian outreach, but no disturbances occurred. 
...Response to the rallies, 7,000 at the first and 20,000 at the 
second, was "incredible," reported GFA staff leader, Fred Schaphorst. 
Other GFA staff said "waves of people just kept coming, women dressed 
in their best saris and men in their best dotis, walking four abreast 
on the road." Yohannan addressed both rallies, and about 75% of each 
crowd came to Christ, Schaphorst said. Christian leaders will follow up 
each convert who signed a decision card. 

In the last 20 years, the number of Christians in Nepal has jumped from 
600 to 80,000, missions specialists with the Assemblies of God say. 
Similar growth is reflected in 42 AG missionaries' reports from 
southern Asia, including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and especially India. 
The Division of Foreign Missions reports that it has upgraded its 
Decade of Harvest evangelism campaign goals because the original 
objectives were too low. For example, in India, the AG says a new 
church is established daily, and believers in the south and east are 
sending missionaries to the capital city of New Delhi and other parts 
of the north, where Christianity has been less accepted. 

Christians in the Southeast Asian country of Myanmar are planning to 
evangelize Buddhists there. Almost 30 years after western missionaries 
were ousted by the government of Burma, as the nation was called, the 
Burmese church is reportedly growing and healthy. According to Ron 
Vander Griend, the Bible League's Asian director, the Burmese "have an 
inner drive to get the job done. And that is what has kept the church 
strong throughout the past generation of isolation." Consequently, in 
the northern region of Myanmar, tribal people have seen Christianity 
flourish, and some tribes are nearly 90% Christian. The believers are 
sending missionaries south to evangelize their Buddhist countrymen. 
Their task is not so simple, though, as Burmese Christians work against 
popular Buddhist thought, which respects any religious book and 
emphasizes constant works.  "Buddhists keep trying to do good things, 
but they can never be sure that they are good enough. I share with them 
about the grace of God. How God loves us even if we are not good 
enough," says Sanpya Thang, a northern Burmese and second-generation 
Christian. 

Mongolia's two largest cities hosted the country's first stadium 
crusades June 16-23. San Antonio evangelist Sammy Tippit, at the 
invitation of Mongolian church leaders, held outdoor meetings in the 
Asian cities of Darhan and Ulan Bator.  The Asian country had little 
Christian influence before 1991, when it abandoned communism (NIRR 
4/5). Tippit held prayer conferences in Mongolia that year, and began 
making plans for an evangelistic outreach. 
...God's Love in Action, Tippit's ministry, reported hundreds came to 
the meetings. About 500 attended each of three nights in the southern 
city of Darhan, which is said to have approximately 100 believers. 
Church leaders asked Tippit not to give an invitation until the last 
evening so participants could better understand the Gospel after 
repeated hearings. On the last night, about 100 Mongolians responded, 
and spoke with local counselors about Christ. To the north, in Ulan 
Bator, four nights of meetings led to responses of 30 to 50 new 
believers each night. More than 300 converts attended a follow-up 
meeting after the last session. The Sunday before he left, Tippit and 
church leaders baptized several Christians, some of whom had converted 
during his two earlier visits to Mongolia. Response was smaller than in 
his crusades to other lands, but Tippit said God's work in Mongolia 
"has been as significant." 

The Bible is setting prisoners free in a prison in Kishinev, Moldova. 
The prison's vice warden told the American Bible Society recently that 
he had recognized noticeable changes in those prisoners who had become 
Christians and had been baptized. "They have changed their attitudes, 
their visions for the future, their whole outlook toward life," he 
said. As a result, prison authorities in the former Soviet republic 
plan to allow Christian representatives more access to prisoners 
because, the warden said, "these visits produce good results in 
behavior and education." 
...Consequently, church groups regularly lead services for the 1,000 
prisoners at the medium-security prison. Seventh-day Adventist, 
evangelical Baptist, and Orthodox leaders are preaching and teaching in 
both Russian and Rumanian. One inmate told ABS representatives many 
Moldovans were looking for standards to follow, including a Western, 
capitalist way of life. "But here in prison," he said, "we are 
preaching the Gospel of Christ, which has no borders and no economic 
system." The inmate compared it to having someone tell him that he 
could go free because someone else would serve his term for him. "I 
know that is what Christ has done for me," he said. 

Seminaries are sprouting all over Eastern Europe, but parishioners are 
not sure they need them, said Peter Kuzmic, one of the area's foremost 
evangelical scholars. The church learned under communism to minister 
without seminary training, since they were eliminated or severely 
restricted. Since few parishioners had the formal academic credentials 
to become pastors, ministers arose within congregations on the basis of 
their spiritual strength and leadership qualities. A young man would 
"attach himself to an older minister, forming an apprenticeship -- 
walking with him, watching, obeying, learning principles of spiritual 
commitment," Kuzmic said. Natural selection worked well under 
communism, he said, and many believe church governance was close to the 
New Testament model. 
...Tensions exist between older experienced leaders, and younger 
unproven leaders who have academic training in seminaries. Some 
conservative Eastern European churches have closed their doors not only 
to seminary-trained pastors, but to Western ideas in general, which 
they consider decadent, said Kuzmic, a native of Slovenia. Some also 
feel insecure about the "armies of religious tourists" coming to 
Eastern Europe, he said. 
...In a headlong rush toward the future, the church should remember the 
lessons it learned under Marxist rule, Kuzmic said. The church 
survived, and sometimes thrived. "Communist persecution has 
strengthened the evangelical church because it has purified it," he 
said. Once president of a communist youth league who became a lay 
preacher, Kuzmic now directs the Evangelical Theological Seminary in 
Osijek, Croatia, where he is a citizen. He favors a "partnership model" 
of leadership: without "uncritical acceptance of the Western model," 
but taking "the best of both models to train as many people as possible 
in the shortest time." The challenge in Eastern Europe now is to 
"consolidate the membership gains, to train converts to become members 
of viable churches," he said. 

The number of Messianic Jews in Israel has increased from 2,000 in 1980 
to 5,000 in 1993, according to Israel Harel, a Messianic evangelist 
there. Harel told a recent Peace of Jerusalem prayer tour that the 
increase is significant since the political and religious tensions in 
the land also have increased. Although more than 10,000 Jews emigrate 
each month from Russia, Ethiopia, and Europe, the government has denied 
residency to some Messianic Jewish families, Harel said. Reports from 
one Israeli church said that believers from several different Messianic 
congregations across the country demonstrated in front of the Israeli 
prime minister's office, showing "that they stand with three Jewish 
immigrant families who have been denied residency in Israel because of 
their faith in Yeshua." The media covered their protest in a positive 
light, they said, "lifting up the name of Yeshua." Leaders from the 
church also reported that three new believers were recently baptized: 
one a Sabra, or native Jewish Israeli; one a Palestinian and former 
Muslim; and one an elderly Russian Jewish immigrant. However, they 
said, the Palestinian believer now may be the target of extreme 
persecution by the terrorist group Hamas, which has tortured him 
before. 
...Forty-five Israeli believers recently traveled to Egypt to meet with 
more than 200 Egyptian believers. According to David Davis, co-pastor 
of Haifa's Carmel Assembly, an underground revival is taking place 
(NIRR 1/11). But at least 70 Egyptian believers have been murdered by 
Muslim fundamentalists. Davis also reported that several former drug 
addicts and alcoholics have received ministry and deliverance as a 
result of Carmel Assembly's prayer meetings and halfway house. And 200 
Messianic Jews marched through the Holy City in a Jerusalem Day parade. 
"We openly shared Jesus with scores of Israelis . . . and Israeli 
believers preached the gospel to a platoon of the Israeli Army," Davis 
said. "We are also seeing entire families of Ethiopians and Russians 
coming to the Lord." 
...Israeli Christians will fast and pray for one week each month for 
the next six months, according to the Mizrachi Family ministry 
newsletter. A messianic ministry in Israel last month called for the 
fast "within the believing community and with all believers in all the 
world who love Israel." Fasters were asked to pray for the salvation of 
Israel, the unity of Jewish believers, and for "the Biblical rights of 
Messianic Jews to emigrate to Israel." 

One of the architects of Colorado's Amendment 2 is launching a national 
group to challenge homosexual-rights laws. America for Family Values 
(AFV) will "spread educational resources needed to defeat the 
gay-rights movement," said Tony Marco, co-founder of Colorado for 
Family Values and executive director of the new organization. AFV will 
research "every aspect" of granting protected-class status to 
homosexuals, and will distribute position papers nationally, Marco told 
NIRR. The new group also will expand the work of DoveTail Ministries, a 
group begun by Marco's wife, Joyce, to help gays and lesbians leave the 
homosexual lifestyle. Among AFV's advisers are Bill Bright of Campus 
Crusade for Christ, D. James Kennedy of Coral Ridge Ministries, and 
Ignacio Rodriguez, former chairman of the Colorado Civil Rights 
Commission. A July 13 news conference officially will announce AFV's 
formation. 
...Although Amendment 2 is undergoing a legal challenge, Oregon voters 
passed statutes in two cities and four counties that bar governments 
from assigning minority status to gays and lesbians. The governments 
also are prevented from spending money to "promote" or "express 
approval of" homosexuality, according to news reports. The Oregon 
Citizens Alliance, which spearheaded the effort, said momentum is 
building in at least two dozen other locales for similar initiatives. 
Homosexual-rights advocates say the measures legitimize anti-gay 
bigotry. 
...Marco says the Oregon ordinances may help public relations and fund 
raising, but were "a strategic error." He told NIRR, "The principle 
that every county should vote on who gets higher status and who doesn't 
is a resurgence of Jim Crow laws," which used local controls to 
segregate and suppress blacks. Homosexual-rights issues, Marco said, 
"ought to be contested on a larger scale," which he hopes AFV will do. 

"Not even priests, doctors, or lawyers" would be exempt from reporting 
suspicions of child abuse to South African police under a proposed law, 
according to Justice Ministry spokesman Werner Krul. Those who suspect 
that a child has been "ill-treated" will be required "to give the 
police a lead." A formal statement or testimony will not be necessary. 
Krul told reporters the government had never before sought to override 
the traditional confidentiality of religious, health-care, or legal 
professionals. Those found guilty of concealing child abuse could be 
imprisoned up to one year. Parliament has yet to vote on the draft law, 
which news services say is likely to pass. 

Pope John Paul II publicly conceded the gravity of the U.S. Catholic 
Church's affliction with sex scandals in a June letter to American 
bishops. Although the pontiff said the media's sensationalizing of evil 
was "dangerous to morality,"  he also decried the abuse of women and 
children. He said that pedophile priests can be defrocked, and that 
mandatory priestly celibacy was not to blame for the spate of problems, 
according to news reports. The pope's letter was released after the 
nation's Catholic bishops formed a committee to study priestly abuse 
and to recommend decisive actions to local clergy. Among the 
suggestions of the church-sponsored panel of 30 experts at the bishop's 
semiannual meeting were independent review boards to oversee church 
investigations, formation of a national task force, church payment for 
victims' therapy, a ban to keep abusive priests from working with 
children again, and a national day of prayer and penance for victims. 

EFCA pastors and their families can call a toll-free phone number for 
personal counseling. The Evangelical Free Church in America established 
the confidential Clergy Care hotline to help ministers and those close 
to them "sort out options and answers to [their] expressed needs," said 
Thomas McDill, past EFCA president and co-director of the Pastoral Care 
Ministry, which began the service in May. Seasoned pastors or pastors' 
wives field the calls and "provide a neutral and objective listening 
ear," he said. EFCA President Paul Cedar asked McDill to help 
facilitate the new outreach to Christian workers in the denomination to 
help meet the special needs they experience in ministry. McDill said 
the Pastoral Care Ministry's other objectives include identifying 
mature pastors and wives to counsel on a more individual basis; 
providing pastors in crisis with a supportive community; making 
referrals to professional counselors when needed; and establishing 
Recovery Churches, or safe havens, in every EFCA district. 
...Christian leaders are being asked to fast and pray one day each week 
for "revival in our personal lives and churches, and for a spiritual 
awakening in our nation which will reach around the world," Cedar said. 
After nearly a year of prayer about the issue, he told denominational 
leaders, "I believe the Lord has prompted me to extend this challenging 
invitation. In a real sense, of course, the invitation is not from me 
but from our Lord." Cedar told NIRR that he is hoping to see a national 
movement of corporate prayer and fasts to be held every Friday. 
"There's something powerful about united prayer. We must be praying 
specifically for revival and world evangelization. I believe God is 
calling us back to a particular day of focus and we must be willing to 
make sacrifices, to be true disciples, to be humiliated, like Jonathan 
Edwards wrote." Cedar encouraged EFCA pastors, leaders, and members to 
keep their normal Friday routines, but to fast and to set aside an hour 
to pray with other Christians. 

As more and more churches deal with sexual scandals, the question 
remains how to best heal the congregation. Open discussions are helping 
parishioners at a Dedham, Mass., church deal with the hurt and anger 
caused by the sexual impropriety and resignation of its pastor. Walter 
Mullins resigned from St. Paul's Episcopal Church last spring with a 
pulpit confession that he had sent love letters to a young woman with 
whom he had a pastoral relationship. Bishop David Johnson initiated the 
discussions among parishioners, saying that healing comes in the 
verbalization of the pain, disbelief, anger, and frustration. 
...Another church that experienced sexual misconduct by its pastor took 
the initiative to go to the press as well as to seek healing within its 
walls. Trinity Evangelical Church in Peterborough, N.H., alerted the 
local media the day after senior pastor Ronald Pinard confessed his 
sexual impropriety from the pulpit. The church discovered days before 
that Pinard had been involved with a number of women in the 
congregation over the span of at least 10 years. One newspaper was so 
impressed with the church's openness that it ran an editorial praising 
the congregation's response in contrast to the way other churches have 
handled clergy sexual misconduct. Trinity also held a series of 
meetings for the congregation, which included dissemination of 
information, question-and-answer periods, prayer, and praise music. 
Individuals also were offered counseling sessions. The church has 
continued to hold informational meetings, place updates in its 
bulletin, and poll parishioners on their concerns. The church is 
seeking a new senior pastor, as well as members' input to revise its 
constitution with a new code of ethics for counseling relationships. 

For many bikers, black leather doesn't mean a black heart. Some 20 
Christian motorcycle groups across the United States, most formed in 
the free-love 1960s, offer high-decibel fellowship around Harleys and 
Jesus. Most of these ministry groups are run by bikers who follow a 
different road, but want to meet the physical, emotional, and spiritual 
needs of their biker brothers and sisters. 
...Joe and Dee Delio are among the Christians who give food and bear 
hugs freely to motorcyclists who gear down and stop on their way 
eastward for the biker bacchanal held each June at the New Hampshire 
International Speedway. The 70th Loudon Classic, the oldest consecutive 
U.S. motorcycle race, was expected to draw 100,000 bikers. The Delios, 
both in their 40s, met about 15,000 to 18,000 of them at The Tent. Over 
the last 15 years, bikers on the way to Loudon have come to know The 
Tent on Route 9 in rural western New Hampshire as the place to tank up 
on soft drinks and 1,500 dozen homemade cookies. The Delios ran The 
Tent for five days with the help of 400 volunteers from 114 churches 
and other committed Christian motorcyclists. 
...Each year, a pit stop at The Tent takes on eternal consequences for 
some bikers, who kneel in the dirt under the yellow-and-white striped 
tent and dedicate their lives to Christ. But the workers' main ministry 
is to listen and sense where they can help. "This is a seed-planting 
operation, a place where people can experience love. Some of these 
people haven't seen their mother for 20 years. . . . We're digging up 
some soil that has been as hard as a rock, and making it sweet again. 
We harvest there, but we plant, too," Dee Delio said. 
...The Delios get letters from formers bikers who are involved in 
churches and who even have led their children to Christ. Once a car 
pulled up to The Tent and a young boy ran out and leaped in Joe's arms 
and hugged him tightly. "Thank you so much for leading my Dad to 
Jesus," the boy said. 
...But the Delios have not always been "bikers on fire for the Lord." 
In the '60s, Dee "married some guy because I was stoned," got divorced, 
and in 1973 met Joe. "He was crazy, and we started going crazy 
together," she told NIRR. They married in 1975. While Joe took a job in 
Nigeria, a woman friend witnessed to Dee. She gave her life to Christ, 
and put behind her a past that included sexual abuse, gang rape, 
beatings, drug and alcohol addiction, and anger. As she wrote to Joe in 
Nigeria about giving her life to Jesus, he thought "some guy named 
Jesus was hitting on me while he was gone," she said. When she 
suggested tithing, Joe thought Jesus "wants my money, too." 
...Joe learned the truth when he returned from Africa. But he was angry 
after he accepted the Lord. "Why has no one loved me enough to tell me 
the truth?" Joe asked Dee. She responded, "Take a look in the mirror!  
Who is going to tell a big guy like you, with a scar on his face and 
forearms the size of legs, about God?" 
...Dee said they began to share their faith, but "had to find a way to 
help people become whole." They earned degrees in counseling, and Dee 
is working on a doctorate in counseling in New Hampshire. Together they 
run Cornerstone Outreach Ministries in Swanzey, N.H. Their work 
includes food distribution, public speaking, substance abuse education, 
pre-marital counseling, and conducting marriage, memorial, and funeral 
services. They minister to individuals, couples, and groups, and 
especially to women and prisoners. The Delios hope to construct a 
residential facility to prepare former prisoners to return to the 
mainstream to prepare former prisoners to return to the mainstream.

Vol. 7, No. 14                                                         
June 28, 1993 

Still slowly rising: the percentage of American adults who affirm that 
religion is "very important" to their lives. Gallup studies in 1992 
showed a decline in Americans' confidence in organized religion as a 
whole, and a four-point drop for the clergy as a group.  But, at the 
same time, belief in the existence of God held steady (at more than 
90%), and belief that religion was "very important" in respondents' 
lives increased to 58%, its highest mark since 1972.  The Princeton 
Religion Research Center reports its preliminary 1993 data continue the 
slight upward trend. 

America should not blame Madalyn Murray O'Hair for its moral decline, 
according to her two sons.  Although 30 years ago this month, the 
country's best-known atheist may have convinced the Supreme Court to 
ban organized prayer from public schools, both William Murray, 47, and 
his brother John Murray, 38, told NIRR that other groups and forces are 
more responsible for America's moral condition. 
...William Murray is the head of the Coppell, Texas-based Freedom's 
Friends.  Formerly an atheist leader, he converted to Christianity in 
the 1970s, and has been an evangelist to atheists for 12 years.  John 
Murray is president of the Austin, Texas-based American Atheists, for 
which his mother, 74, consults.  The family is not close, and they 
disagree on matters of fact relating to the landmark case, and on 
religion.  Neither O'Hair (who was not available for comment) nor John 
Murray communicates with the evangelist.  William Murray and his mother 
have been estranged for some 20 years, since before his conversion.  
John Murray told NIRR he has not had contact with his brother for seven 
or eight years.  And a spokesman for William Murray told NIRR that 
O'Hair returns birthday cards from her oldest son, and will not accept 
his telephone calls. 
...Exactly 30 years after the June 17, 1963 decision, William Murray 
returned to Baltimore to preach revival at his Miracle Day rally, 
billed as "America's spiritual turning point" and "God's last warning." 
 He told a crowd of 5,500 at the city's Arena that his mother had used 
him as a public school pawn to forward her ideology.  "My family's 
rejection of God was not intellectual," he preached.  "We did not 
remove prayer from America's schools because of separation of church 
and state.  We simply did not want to hear the word of God because it 
was contrary to the lives we lived."  He told the rally that his 
grandmother read Tarot cards and communed with demons, and that his 
mother, "who claims to be an atheist," talks to the dead.  "I come from 
a family of sinners."  William Murray said the results of sin have been 
costly for America. "Look at the schools with God gone," he said, 
noting guns, rape, drugs, contraceptive and condom distribution, the 
necessity for police patrols, violence, and AIDS. 
...William Murray, however, says his mother and her lawsuit were only 
catalysts for the "real damage" of the American Civil Liberties Union, 
the National Education Association, and an "activist" Supreme Court 
under Chief Justice Earl Warren in the 1960s and 1970s.  The justices 
"made it clear they wanted to change society because Congress was not 
doing it quickly enough," he said, and they "openly advertised" for 
lawsuits to try in hopes of overturning laws on busing, abortion, and 
school prayer.  "The courts wanted to lower our society to the lowest 
common denominator," he told NIRR, and America had become what his 
mother wanted it to be, "a godless nation." 
...John Murray agreed that the moral condition in America, particularly 
in the schools, is "deplorable" and "lousy."  But he said not "all of 
the problems we currently see in the school system are directly caused 
by removal of religion."  Society "was changing anyway," and "if there 
had never been a [school prayer ban] case," the culture still would not 
have remained the same, he said.  Likewise, "prayer is not a magic 
panacea to erase all of these problems." 
..."I am not opposed to religion if it brings about positive behavioral 
change.  But the place is in the home, not in the schools.  I believe 
in family values," John Murray said, noting that "religious people feel 
they have the monopoly on them, but they don't."  Many atheist parents 
teach values, such as respect for one another and for elders, he said. 
...The atheist leader also said religion may be the most practical way 
to reverse America's moral decline.  "I understand the role religion 
has played as a social control mechanism.  If that turns out to be the 
best mechanism to keep society in control, OK, so be it," Murray said.  
"If churches can get positive results, that's fine with me.  Go with 
what works," he said.  From a practical point of view, Murray called 
the church "the only grassroots organization I know" with an "assembly 
hall on every street corner," thus in a position to influence ethical 
behavior for the better. 
..."But the message has to change.  It has to become more socially 
responsible," John Murray told NIRR.  He acknowledged that not all 
preachers were greedy or hypocritical, and that "some are dedicated to 
drug programs and helping the homeless."  But, he added, "not enough 
[are] doing these things.  We need more of these kinds of people."  The 
Supreme Court has ruled James Zobrest was entitled to a 
government-provided sign language interpreter, even though he attended 
Catholic school (NIRR 3/8).  In a 5-4 decision with overlapping 
opinions, the justices ruled in favor of Zobrest, who is deaf.  The 
Tucson-area Catalina Foothills School District had maintained that 
Arizona law and the federal Education of the Handicapped Act entitled 
Zobrest to a taxpayer-funded signer, but only at a public school.  News 
reports said the district also objected that the interpreter would have 
to translate during the mass and religion classes as part of a Catholic 
curriculum.  But a majority of the high court determined that a signer 
for deaf students benefits them rather than the religious schools they 
attend. 
...Chief Justice William Rehnquist's majority opinion was joined by 
four justices:  Byron White, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and 
Clarence Thomas.  Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor 
dissented based on the principle that the high court should not decide 
issues on their constitutional merits if cases can be decided on more 
specific points.  In their dissent, Justices Harry Blackmun and David 
Souter objected to a "state-employed interpreter" serving as a "conduit 
for religious instruction."  Religious liberties watchdogs, who 
disagreed with the decision, were relieved the court let stand the 
three-point Lemon test's standards for allowable exceptions to 
church-state separation. . . . The case is not over yet.  An Arizona 
federal district court will decide if the Zobrests will be reimbursed 
for fees to provide James with an interpreter: about $35,000 plus 
interest.  The plaintiffs also seek their legal costs.  News reports 
quoted a school district attorney as saying no such reimbursement 
requirement exists. 

A unanimous Supreme Court decision on ritual animal sacrifice boosted 
First Amendment religious rights.  The high court struck down a series 
of Hialeah, Fla., ordinances aimed at banning animal killings for 
religious purposes, although the city did not prohibit such slaughter 
for food, sport, or pest control.  Because the city's zoning in effect 
targeted sacramental practices at the Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye 
(NIRR 10/19/92), a broad spectrum of religious and civil liberties 
groups allied themselves with the Santerians.  Adherents of the 
Afro-Cuban religion (at least 50,000 in South Florida) combine elements 
of animism, voodoo, and Catholicism in their services, news accounts 
indicated. 
...Governments must show a "compelling interest," Justice Anthony 
Kennedy wrote for the court, before enacting "gerrymandering" laws 
forbidding religious practices.  Such laws also must be written as 
narrowly as possible, must be neutral, and must be applied across the 
board, the opinion said.  The 1990 Smith "peyote" case, which did not 
use the same strict justification test, has sparked efforts to pass the 
Religious Freedom Restoration Act (NIRR 5/17).  The RFRA would restore 
the compelling interest standard which the Smith decision dropped.  The 
RFRA has passed the House and awaits Senate debate.  Numerous religious 
groups and President Clinton have said they support the bill. 

The Christian and Missionary Alliance was the first of the 
denominations to hold its annual meetings this month. About 1,800 
delegates, representing more than 260,000 church members, met in 
Anaheim, Calif., for their U.S. General Council June 1-6.  As most 
conventions, the CMA dealt with business and administrative concerns.  
A 1993 budget of $27,600,000 was adopted.  Delegates approved revisions 
to the church constitution that will allow the CMA to incorporate in 
Colorado, site of its national headquarters.  David Rambo was renamed 
CMA president for a third term.  Delegates also voted to allow Alliance 
colleges to establish their own graduate-level programs, and the Board 
of Managers will review the need for a full-time education director, 
and a national board of education. 
..."Pray First" was the General Council's initial and underlying theme. 
 Denominational leaders said any church effort required prayer to 
succeed.  To that end, the National Prayer Mobilization Task Force 
coordinated a 24-hour prayer room.  Wednesday's lunch hour was set 
aside as a time of intercession and fasting.  Prayer services 
punctuated morning services and evening meetings. 
...A secondary missions theme was launched by a CMA decision to begin 
planting churches in Russia (NIRR 4/5). Although a missionary rally 
focused on CMA evangelistic opportunities worldwide (17 new 
missionaries will serve in 11 countries), the emphasis was clearly on 
the former Soviet Union.  Six couples were commissioned as the first of 
about 50 resident missionaries to Volgograd, formerly Stalingrad.  Half 
are veteran missionaries from other foreign posts, half are new 
recruits.  They will cooperate with existing churches, especially in 
theological and pastoral training of lay leaders. CAMA Services, the 
denomination's relief agency, also seeks ways to implement development 
programs in conjunction with the church planting objective.  Organizers 
for the annual missions convocation hoped to collect $500,000 for the 
Russian effort.  At last count, the offering topped $767,000, with 
donations still coming.  The final total could double the previous 
giving record for the annual event.  Rambo joined both CMA General 
Council themes in his call for a national day of prayer in July, when 
the team is scheduled to reach Russia. 

The nation's largest Protestant denomination, the Southern Baptist 
Convention, held its 136th annual meeting in Houston June 15-17.  The 
more than 17,000 messengers, or delegates, (24% fewer than expected) 
met in the George R. Brown Convention Center.  Re-elected SBC President 
Ed Young, pastor of Houston's Second Baptist Church, asked them to pay 
more attention to evangelism than to political activism.  The delegates 
focused on both.  Defying a 150-year tradition, messengers instituted a 
doctrinal restriction to convention membership by approving a 
recommendation from last year's convention.  Individual churches "not 
in cooperation with the Convention are churches which act to affirm, 
approve, or endorse homosexual behavior," the constitutional amendment 
read. 
...Almost immediately, Immanuel Baptist, President Clinton's home 
church, came under attack from Florida pastor Bo Hammock, who tried to 
apply the new criteria to messengers sent by the Little Rock, Ark., 
congregation.  A motion from the floor sought to unseat Immanuel's 
messengers because their church had taken no action against Clinton for 
his stances on homosexuals and abortion.  Visibly incensed, Immanuel 
Pastor Rex Horne warned that approval of the motion was tantamount to a 
witch hunt that would engulf the denomination.  The credentials 
committee met in a corner of a ballroom that was used to register 
messengers and debated the issue for more than two hours.  They finally 
decided that Immanuel's messengers could remain seated because, as a 
body, the church had not voted to take no action against Clinton. 
Immanuel's lack of action, then, did not constitute an act.  The 
committee ruled that a church cannot be considered out of cooperation 
with the SBC because of a member's position on homosexuality. 
...Southern Baptists Bill Clinton and Al Gore were not invited.  The 
Southern Baptist Convention, for the first time in recent years, chose 
not to ask the president or vice president to attend.  Several of 
Clinton's and Gore's views conflict with the beliefs of staunch 
conservatives who have run the convention for more than a decade.  The 
delegates approved a resolution to separate the SBC from Clinton's 
positions on homosexual and abortion rights.  The statement urged the 
president to "affirm biblical morality," and the country's 15.2 million 
Southern Baptists to try to influence and to "pray earnestly" for him.  
Committee members stressed that the resolution was not an attack on 
Clinton, but on his beliefs.  After the vote, Young led the convention 
in prayer for the president. 
...Another top agenda item was the continuing question of whether 
Baptists also may be Freemasons.  Last year Texas layman Larry Holly 
requested a one-year Home Mission Board investigation.  Freemasonry 
critics say the fraternal organization is a "mixture of paganism and 
Christianity."  They sought to disallow Southern Baptists membership in 
the Freemasons, a move that could have affected the thousands who are 
members of both groups. 
...In its report to the SBC, the HMB commended Masons for their 
charitable endeavors and acknowledged that many outstanding Christians 
and Southern Baptists belong to the fraternity.  But the report noted 
eight tenets it found at odds with Christianity and Southern Baptist 
doctrine: (1) prevalent use of titles and names such as "Worshipful 
Master" for the leader of the lodge, or "Abaddon" and "Jah-Bul-On," the 
so-called secret name of God, and references to Masonic buildings as 
mosques, shrines, or temples; (2) archaic, offensive rituals and 
so-called "bloody oaths" or "obligations"; (3) recommended readings of 
pagan or occultic writings by leading Freemasons; (4) reference to the 
lodge's altar Bible as the "furniture of the lodge"; (5) frequent use 
of the term "light," which some may misunderstand as a reference to 
salvation via Freemasonry, rather than to knowledge or truth; (6) the 
implication that salvation may be attained by one's good works; (7) the 
"heresy" of universalism; and (8) the refusal by most lodges to admit 
African Americans.  Masons answered the charges in a full-page ad in a 
Houston newspaper, and the editor of The Scottish Rite Journal told 
reporters that the Baptist debate had helped rejuvenate the devotion of 
Masons for their lodges.  The SBC delegates voted by a 5-1 margin that 
membership should be a matter of "personal conscience." 
...Personal conscience drew considerable debate, especially as applied 
to the choice of Jerry Rankin as new president of the Foreign Mission 
Board.  Rankin, a 23-year veteran of world missions work and head of 
SBC operations in South Asia, says he believes in the gifts of the Holy 
Spirit, but does not speak in tongues.  He did, however, admit to 
"praying in the Spirit," and having once interpreted a message spoken 
in tongues during a public meeting in Singapore. Since many Southern 
Baptists oppose such charismatic practices, his nomination led to some 
controversy.  The FMB trustees spent all day in session before electing 
Rankin 59-14 to replace former FMB head R. Keith Parks, who moved to 
the moderate-led Cooperative Baptist Fellowship last year.  The board 
made the vote unanimous. 
...On the last day of the convention, messengers approved numerous 
resolutions, including: labeling homosexuality a sin that has no place 
in the military; opposing all efforts by Congress to pass abortion on 
demand bills; calling for an end to international genocide; decrying 
the lack of prayer in school; opposing U.S. diplomatic ties with the 
Vatican while "expressing a desire to continue working with Roman 
Catholics on moral, social and public policy issues of mutual 
agreement"; and encouraging individual churches to "reach across racial 
and ethnic boundaries" in ministry. 

Delegates to the Christian Reformed Church Synod at Calvin College were 
confronted by nine women in white, one holding a crippled bird statue.  
The members of the church's Committee for Women sat in a square, 
silently protesting the CRC's ban on women's ordination.  The 
311,000-member conservative denomination, headquartered in Grand 
Rapids, Mich., has grappled with the question for years.  In 1990, the 
Synod voted to open all church offices to women, including elders and 
ministers, but by 1992, when the decision was to be ratified, the CRC 
adopted a compromise that said women would not be ordained, but would 
be allowed to "expound" or hold pastoral care roles under the 
supervision of male elders. At this year's Synod, June 12-17, a 
majority of the 18-member advisory committee on women's ordination had 
recommended retaining the 1992 decision.  But after seven hours of 
debate, the delegates voted 95-88 to give congregations the option of 
deciding whether to ordain qualified women to posts as ministers, 
elders, or evangelists.  (The CRC already permits women to serve as 
deacons.)  The Synod's justification was three-fold:  (1) Women should 
be allowed to exercise their gifts in the church, since the New 
Testament names men and women equals both since creation and in Christ; 
(2) Scripture offers no clear and unquestionable prohibition of women 
from all church offices at all times and under all circumstances; and 
(3) Scriptural views of wives' submission to husbands cannot be 
broadened to the view that all males have authority over all females 
within the church, despite what Reformation leader and church founder 
John Calvin believed.  The tentative decision will not be enacted until 
the 1994 synod decides on the measure's advisability, as it will a 
proposal on children's participation at the Lord's Supper, or 
Eucharist.  Critics of the conservative tenor of the CRC were pleased 
by the actions, but to date 32 congregations and some 7,200 members 
have left the CRC over what they saw as a slide toward liberal 
theological views. 

The Presbyterian Church in America, at its General Assembly in 
Columbia, S.C., asked the CRC to repent of its "departure from the 
Scriptures in doctrine and practice."  Among the charges the 
commissioners of the Atlanta-based PCA leveled were unbiblical 
positions on tolerance for homosexuality, the teaching of evolutionary 
origins at Calvin College, harassment of "faithful" non-modernist 
"ministers of the gospel," and preaching and teaching by women.  The 
PCA's General Assembly, noting "grave concern," issued a formal request 
to the CRC for reversal of its tentative decision to open pastoral jobs 
to women.  The measures were originated by the PCA's Louisiana 
Presbytery, and although a committee on interchurch relations urged 
their rejection, the approximately 1,250 PCA commissioners, or 
delegates, approved the measures 439-351.  The 243,000-member PCA and 
the CRC share a Reformed heritage.  Both have policy statements against 
abortion, homosexual practice, the teaching of evolution as fact, and 
women's ordination. 
...In response to "misleading reporting," PCA Stated Clerk Paul 
Gilchrist wrote to the CRC to clarify the action. CRC General Secretary 
Leonard Hofman told NIRR the church issued no formal response at its 
Synod meeting since PCA officials informed them that the allegations in 
the approved overture "remain to our knowledge unsubstantiated," and 
"may or may not be true as reported."  The PCA would continue to 
investigate (as would the CRC), and Gilchrist said any documentation 
would be presented to the 1994 General Assembly for action. 
...The PCA also had to fend off charges by "Concerned Presbyterians" of 
a liberal drift within the generally conservative denomination.  Led by 
Charles Wilson, a Charlotte, N.C., pastor, Concerned Presbyterians 
feared the PCA was moving "toward political and economic ministry 
rather than a scriptural and spiritual ministry."  At issue were 
biblical inerrancy, worship style (namely liturgical dancing), and 
church governance.  Delegates to the June 7-11 General Assembly 
approved a doctrinal statement declaring biblical fidelity, and said 
worship styles were not determined by denominational rules.  The PCA 
split from the more liberal Presbyterian Church in the United States, 
now part of the Presbyterian Church (USA), in December 1973, and 
reports "uninterrupted" growth in membership. 
...The PCA added a declaration against homosexuality to previous 
statements on abortion, marriage, and divorce. Urging the president to 
clearly and publicly affirm "the teaching of God's Word," the statement 
concluded with a prayer that Clinton would "stand against any and every 
pressure" brought by those seeking to "legitimize homosexual 
practices." 

Homosexuality was the hottest topic of discussion at the Presbyterian 
Church (USA)'s 205th General Assembly in Orlando June 2-9, and many of 
the commissioners' views were polarized.  The church, at its last 
policy-making meeting in 1991, issued its "authoritative" stand that 
homosexuality is "not God's wish for humanity."  Since then, more than 
30 regional church bodies have requested either a stronger or 
less-stringent position.  The debate engulfed the election of a new 
chief spokesman for the 2.8 million-member denomination.  New moderator 
David Lee Dobler, an Alaskan pastor and San Francisco Theological 
Seminary graduate, said the church must uphold its opposition to sex 
outside of marriage; but if people (whether heterosexual or homosexual) 
violate the "biblical standard," the church should still "embrace" them 
in a "caring, concerned, and loving" manner. 
...Students and faculty from Princeton Theological Seminary offered two 
petitions expressing variant views.  The Princeton Declaration, signed 
by 103 people (including President Thomas Gillespie), said 
homosexuality is "wrong from a biblical and moral standpoint."  The 
petition asks the church to maintain its policy against ordaining 
practicing homosexuals, since "Christian ministry is not a civil 
right."  Several key seminary administrators and faculty members signed 
the declaration.  Another quickly drafted petition, signed by 85 
people, said the declaration is not an official school document, and 
does not account for opposing views.  It asked the church to "rethink" 
its ordination standards. 
...Others supported an immediate reversal of church policy against 
homosexual ordination.  Members of Presbyterian ACT UP were led by Lisa 
Bove and Indianapolis pastor Howard Warren.  Warren, who is openly gay 
and HIV+, is under a church inquiry to determine his fitness to serve.  
Presbyterians for Gay and Lesbian Concerns' Lisa Larges of San 
Francisco said ordination was necessary to prevent giving homosexuals a 
false hope of "love without justice."  The gayrights leader with the 
highest profile was Jane Spahr (NIRR 3/22), whom the PCUSA last year 
found unfit to pastor a New York church because of her homosexuality.  
She said, "For me to act in any other way than to be in a lesbian 
relationship would be sinful . . . because I was created that way," and 
"honoring God" by being in love with a woman.  Spahr approved 
cooperative study on the issue, but said, "let's rescind this rule that 
keeps us divided." 
...About 60-70 activists, carrying a large wooden cross and a 
multi-colored triangular banner, marched among the seated commissioners 
for about 40 minutes after the General Assembly rejected requests to 
overturn the ban on homosexual clergy, elders, and deacons.  Officers 
instructed the crowd to remain seated and pray.  Around 12:30 a.m., 
after almost six hours of debate and demonstrations, Dobler prayed and 
dismissed the commissioners. 
...However, the Committee on Human Sexuality voted 32-3 to recommend a 
churchwide study, which the delegates approved 396-155.  For three 
years all churches and presbyteries will be asked to examine sexuality 
as regards membership and ordination.  Homosexuals, including clergy, 
who had not announced their sexual preferences publicly were urged to 
participate without fear of official church reprisal -- a promise some 
gays and lesbians were said not to trust.  Some proponents and 
opponents of the current church stand saw the study as a stall tactic. 
...The delegates also voted 302-192 not to urge scouting troops meeting 
in PCUSA churches to allow homosexuals. Conversely, they voted 268-226 
to urge President Clinton and Congress to lift the ban on gays in the 
military.  The delegates also condemned Colorado's Amendment 2 as 
discriminatory, and reaffirmed their support for legal abortion and the 
denomination's membership in the Religious Coalition for Abortion 
Rights.  The General Assembly also moved one step closer to alliance 
with eight other Protestant groups.  The denominations would keep their 
own church hierarchies and ordination processes, but would begin to 
unify under "covenanting councils" to share liturgies and ordination 
ceremonies. The plan went to the regional presbyteries and local 
churches for study, and national headquarters will work out details.  
All of the participating churches are expected to vote on the move by 
1998. 
...As have other mainline denominations of late, the PCUSA announced 
budget cuts.  A 15% slash ($7 million) left the denomination's annual 
budget at $45 million.  Personnel, too, was trimmed about 22%; about 
175 jobs were targeted, although nearly 100 of the nearly 750 national 
staff members already have opted for early retirement or voluntary 
separation incentives, according to church spokeswoman Marj Carpenter.  
In a money-saving move, the Louisville, Ky.-based national office will 
downsize from nine national divisions to three.  The monetary woes are 
blamed on the long-standing debts from the PCUSA's formation in 1983, 
the economic recession, and churchgoers increasing comfort with local 
church rather than denominational giving. 

Restructuring, magazine revamping, and reconsideration of laity were 
emphases of the Reformed Church in America's 187th General Synod June 
7-11 in Vancouver, British Columbia.  The 275 Synod representatives 
replaced the RCA's General Program Council and General Synod Executive 
Committee with a 66-member General Synod Council, drawn from class 
delegates, at-large members, and Synod officers.  The group also voted 
to reduce the annual General Synod meeting to about two-thirds its 
current size.  A newly-formed Canadian regional synod was added as the 
RCA's eighth. 
...Church Herald, the official RCA magazine, spurred 18 classis 
overtures, or official communications.  The Synod was asked to rescind 
or restudy a 1992 decision to send the publication to every RCA 
household as a member's benefit, with costs underwritten by a 
per-member assessment.  The 1993 Synod voted 170-81 to retain the 1992 
action. 
...In political statements, the Synod spoke out against deforestation, 
the Greenhouse effect, the return of Haitian refugees without asylum 
interviews, nuclear testing, economic embargoes against Cuba, and 
tobacco products.  A theological paper on the use of scripture in 
making moral decision and an overture requesting a strong stand against 
homosexuals in the military were debated, but referred to commissions 
for further study. 
...The New York City-based denomination elected as its president 
retired Michigan pastor Warren Burgess, last year's General Synod vice 
president.  Burgess said "the church will succeed or fail in the arena 
of the local congregation." To spare pastors of overextension and 
burn-out, Beth Marcus, presiding over the Synod sessions, asked for 
greater denominational emphasis on lay ministry.  The Synod agreed that 
better preparation for lay persons would aid pastoral services, and 
asked the Congregational Services Unit to help equip the church's 
331,000 saints for diaconal and full ministry.  In missions, the Synod 
called for greater commitment to inner-city ministries, evangelization 
of the unchurched, new member discipleship, and the establishment of 
new churches (some with cooperation from the Presbyterian Church 
(USA)).  The Synod also challenged RCA congregations to send out at 
least 10 new foreign missionaries. 

King Fahd of Saudi Arabia has given Harvard Law School $5 million to 
help improve the image of Islam in the United States.  The grant will 
help create a center at the university for the study of Islamic law.  
Dean Robert Clark applauded the gift; he said since 20% of the world's 
population lives in Muslim lands, examination of Islamic law was 
"imperative."  Fahd's "foresight and generosity," Clark said, ensure 
"serious, objective academic study of this vital field." AD 2000 
convened a one-day International Briefing on the Middle East in 
Colorado Springs June 5.  The seminar -attended by about 120 missions 
executives, activists, and interested church people -- featured experts 
from Middle Eastern nations, including officials from the Arab World 
Evangelical Ministers' Association (AWEMA). 
...The Muslim world is today's most neglected mission field, the 
sponsoring agency asserted, noting that less than 0.4% of money 
budgeted for Christian missions goes to tear down what AD 2000 calls 
the major obstacle to world evangelization.  President Luis Bush cited 
three myths that hinder investment in ministries to Muslims: (1) that 
fanatical terrorism is common among the many peoples of the Arab-Muslim 
world; (2) that Muslims cannot be reached by the gospel; and (3) that 
God does not care about Muslims.  The briefing's leaders said Arab 
peoples are the key to reaching the entire Muslim world of 1 billion 
people. 
...Unity is growing among Christians throughout the Arab world, 
according to a 1993 study by the Middle East-based Cooperative Strategy 
Group.  In an area where infighting and independence were typical of 
even believers, there is a new level of cooperation.  "It's as if a 
light has come on, and evangelicals finally see they need each other," 
AWEMA Chairman Lucien Accad said.  Tom Craig of Seattle-based Interdev 
presented the 20 religious megatrends identified in the CSG survey of 
90 Arab and 80 expatriate evangelical ministers in the Middle East. 
...The survey revealed that Middle Eastern believers feel a strong 
sense of isolation from the rest of the church worldwide, and that they 
desire intercession on their behalf.  AD 2000 Prayer Journey 
Coordinator Ted Haggard said 20 million people volunteered to help meet 
that need when the agency set a goal to recruit 1 million people to 
pray for the unevangelized Muslim, Buddhist, and Hindu nations of the 
"10/40 Window." 
...The briefing also acknowledged that Islamic fundamentalists had 
successfully proselytized Christians in the Middle East.  Menes Abdul 
Noor, pastor of the largest evangelical church in Egypt, blamed the 
problem on the lack of Christian training available in the Middle East. 
 Adding to the challenge, Arab believers sent overseas for Christian 
education often stay in the West, lured by the numerous opportunities 
for ministry. 

More than 20,000 church-organized volunteers have helped victims of 
Hurricane Andrew since the storm blew across southern Florida last Aug. 
24 in what has been called the nation's worst natural disaster.  To 
date, unpaid workers from religious organizations have repaired more 
than 2,000 homes and completed 6,780 work projects, according to Mary 
Louise Cole, executive director of the Interfaith Coalition for the 
Andrew Recovery Effort, known as ICARE.  Christ for the City, a program 
of the Latin American Mission, has provided support in South Florida 
for harried pastors, their families, and other residents still coping 
with the challenges that remain. 
...Florida still needs thousands of workers.  The media have not 
covered the problem lately, and the hurricane area still has a long 
road to recovery, Cole's assistant, Bill Dobson, told NIRR.  At least 
2,000 housing units require repair or reconstruction.  Many were 
uninsured, under-insured, or left unrepaired by unscrupulous 
contractors, he said. 
...Volunteers will have a place to stay.  South Dade County boasts a 
new shelter complex.  Built with donated equipment and material, on 
donated land, the shelter is a cooperative effort of ICARE and 
Samaritan's Purse, a Boone, N.C.based disaster relief organization that 
has focused on aiding hurricane victims. 

More than 500 Christian health workers wrestled with the complex issues 
of how to help the impoverished people of developing countries at MAP 
International's 13th Triennial Conference on Christian Health 
Ministries.  The conference was held June 5-9 on St. Simons Island, 
Ga., and was attended by global leaders from 211 organizations, 56 
professions, and 63 countries.  In addition to physicians and other 
health-care professionals, speakers included international seminary 
professors, medical missions experts, evangelical relief group leaders, 
parachurch heads, and pastors. 
...The conference also touched on many aspects of politics and 
economics.  The health minister of Armenia discussed his country's 
grave needs as the result of an earthquake, the breakup of the Soviet 
Union, and widespread regional civil strife.  Others debated the 
problems of social justice, urbanization, the growing financial gap, 
and how to empower the poor. Some participants focused on 
community-based health care and the involvement of local congregations 
in healing ministries. The Third World was a common topic for 
discussions of attitudes and prejudices, women's roles, Islam, deficits 
and debt service, and cultural fragmentation in Africa. 
...Africa more than any other continent suffers an identity crisis: 
stuck between East and West, old and new, said Tite Tienou of the West 
African country of Burkina Faso.  "Missionizing has come to us from the 
West like a bulldozer, leveling African culture," he said, and 
"Africans often are viewed as children to be raised to the level of 
Western culture." Tienou, an associate professor at Alliance 
Theological Seminary in Nyack, N.Y., said believers "need once and for 
all to chase the demons that equate Westernization to Christianity.  
Christianity does not live or die by one particular culture. 
Christianity is doomed in Africa if it allows itself to be seen as the 
white man's religion, while Islam is seen as African," said Tienou, who 
will this fall become faculty dean at the Evangelical Seminary of the 
Christian Alliance in Cote d'Ivoire. 

...Africa's future will not be found in its past, Tienou told the MAP 
International conference.  "I refuse to be imprisoned in the ancestral. 
 The ancestral is not the authentic -- it is useful."  He said Africans 
must critically consider their background in the light of Scripture and 
ask themselves "what exactly does it mean to take one's heritage 
seriously and yet look toward the future?  If the rhythms of the drum 
change, you must change your dance step as well.  There is a new drum 
beating." 
...Africa is uprooted but not transplanted, said Gladys Mwiti, a Kenyan 
psychologist and author.  African tribal culture and its system of 
morality and taboos once held African families intact.  But, she said, 
when European-American Christianity displaced the tribal heritage and 
shifted allegiances to the church, they unintentionally sowed 
revolution. 
...A lack of discipleship has worsened the problems.  "People may go to 
church, but their religion is skin deep. They have not been made to 
realize they own the faith.  It has not become part of their 
lifestyle," Mwiti said.  The result has been confusion, especially 
since many youth, set adrift from their families and the church, latch 
on to the culture that exported technology and religion to Africa, she 
said.  But the West also sent pornography, drugs, abortion, condoms, 
the pill, and divorce.  Teen-agers are sexually active, something 
"unheard of a few years ago," Mwiti said. 
...The generation gap is not only a Western phenomenon.  Often parents 
and children belong to two worlds: the older generation is rural, with 
close family ties, while the young people, who are better educated, 
succumb to the allure of urban life and loosen ties with their 
families, Mwiti said.  Some 500 people a day move to Nairobi.  In 
between, the African family, the foundation of traditional Africa, is 
unraveling, said Mwiti, who also co-produces Thoughtline, a national 
television program on family problems in Kenya.  Mwiti holds training 
seminars on family values.  The courses teach biblical principles, but 
are not labeled Christian.  Since 1990, she has trained 120 lay 
counselors, who have started their own seminars and are reaching more 
than 8,000 people a year.  Even Muslims have attended.  For a Muslim to 
ask for guidance from a black woman in Africa, she said, is quite a 
breakthrough. 
...Still, "a value vacuum looms from one end of the continent to the 
other," said Mwiti, who, as director of the Oasis Counseling Centre in 
Nairobi, develops programs for colleges, businesses, non-governmental 
organizations, and churches within Kenya and beyond.  "Unless the 
church of Jesus Christ realizes what is happening, then our ministry 
will not be relevant," she said.  The church must "marry the culture 
and the Bible."  One method is to involve youth in the life of the 
church body, encouraging them to ask questions about the past and the 
future, and training them in the physical and spiritual benefits of 
purity and self-control, Mwiti said. 

The Bible became a weapon in the war against AIDS in Malawi.  A 
missionary from the Africa Evangelical Church in southern Malawi 
recently distributed 250 Chichewa New Testaments to African children 
participating in a youth camp.  The Scriptures were provided by the 
American Bible Society, and the children were required to memorize 20 
verses in order to receive their New Testaments.  "We wanted to get 
them together for a concentrated week of Bible study, to instruct them 
on how to live as young people and to teach them about AIDS," the 
missionary said.  "If more young people become committed to Jesus 
Christ and follow what the Bible teaches, the spreading of AIDS can be 
stopped." 
...Thousands of AIDS orphans in sub-Saharan Africa soon will receive 
care through a new youth missions outreach.  After several visits to 
the region, Teen Mission International's director, Robert Bland, became 
aware of the countless victims of AIDS.  Most were children orphaned 
when their parents died from the disease.  TMI reported that 7.5 
million people have tested HIV+ in sub-Saharan Africa alone.  AIDS has 
virtually wiped out the middle-aged population, leaving villages of 
only children and the elderly.  Children as young as six have been left 
to survive on their own.  In May, TMI incorporated the AIDS Orphans 
Association, which will send TMI Bible school graduates to run farms 
and orphanages in an effort to care for the children.  This August, TMI 
will begin implementing its ministry plan by taking steps to purchase 
properties, initiate contacts, and establish homes throughout 
sub-Saharan Africa.  By next March the group hopes to develop a video 
and literature for the ministry, utilize two full-time personnel, 
provide clothes for the orphans, establish gardens, and care for at 
least 12 children. 

Somalia is nestled in the middle of God's hand.  It has a special 
purpose, said David Stevens, M.D., director of World Medical Missions 
Inc. (WMM) in Boone, N.C.  The country's agony is "a God-given 
opportunity to get the Bible into an area that has had little exposure 
to the gospel," Stevens told NIRR.  Few parts of Somalia have had a 
Christian outreach, and missionaries were expelled completely in 1974.  
Disease, not starvation, is killing 75% of those dying in Somalia, said 
Stevens, who first arrived with American troops in December and 
returned most recently in May. 
...Somalians are so desperate for medical help that camp leaders beat 
back refugees with sticks to enforce order at clinics, Stevens said, 
and doctors can spend only three to four minutes with each patient.  
"There is total anarchy -- no courts, no police.  You don't go anywhere 
without an armed guard.  I have never been in a country like that in my 
life." Still, World Medical Mission mobile units have cared for some 
35,000 patients at refugee camps and villages since the beginning of 
the year, Stevens said.  Plans call for a 50-bed medical hospital to be 
set up in north Mogadishu. 

...But the window of opportunity for the gospel may close soon in 
Somalia, the WMM director said.  A short-term setback came when relief 
workers were evacuated temporarily to Nairobi earlier this month after 
Somalian warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid attacked United Nations-Pakistani 
troops.  In addition, Stevens said, "The new government, when it is 
formed, will be very difficult" to work with.  In the meantime, 
Somalians are coming to the Lord through one-to-one, friendship 
evangelism, he said.  Providing medical help to Somalians has been a 
life-changing experience for many, said Stevens, including himself.  
"There is such a sense of fulfillment.  It's the difference between 
life and death." 

In at least 12 developing countries, the Heifer Project International 
is using the bovine beasts and other farm animals to help rural 
families become self-sufficient.  The 50-year-old Christian relief 
agency reports that in places like Tanzania, Uganda, Cameroon, and 
Ghana, hundreds of thousands of families are learning to care for 
themselves better through the simple provision of a farm animal.  
Working with local organizations, HPI is providing pregnant heifers to 
families.  HPI instructs them on animal care, feeding, hygiene, 
shelter, and agricultural techniques that can help them feed their 
otherwise malnourished children.  The HPI projects are monitored for 
two years, and include culture-specific strategies for community 
development.  The animals also can generate additional income that the 
families can use for their children's health care and education. 

Ethiopia's Education Ministry has asked a missions group to help teach 
elementary students in their own language. When officials decided to 
allow children in the Wolaitta district to learn in their native tongue 
instead of Amharic, and to write in a Roman rather than Ethopic script, 
they sought the help of the Sudan Interior Mission (SIM).  Two SIM 
missionaries had spent several years translating the Bible into the 
Wolaitta language, and they were able to assist the government in 
drafting a Western writing system.  As the joint translation team 
developed the writing rules for Wolaitta, SIM then printed and donated 
2,000 copies of the rules to schools.  Consequently, a government 
official asked the missionaries to help train Ethiopian teachers as 
well.  The official asked the missionaries to recount how they had 
produced the Scriptures in the Wolaitta language, before "the Emperor 
decreed that books should be produced only in Amharic."  The SIM 
missionaries claimed that the arrangement would ensure that the 
official rules of writing in Wolaitta would "not clash with the way we 
write the Bible.  God has brought us together." 
...Since Ethiopia restored religious freedom in 1991, the church has 
been growing faster than it can train leaders, SIM officials reported.  
Until the overthrow of the communist government, the church had met 
underground.  Public persecutions of Christians were common, but the 
church flourished as a result.  SIM reports that one church conference 
in Wolaitta included nearly 50,000 believers.  A new $2.5 million 
training facility is being built to equip the pastors and leaders of 
more than 3,000 SIM-related churches in Ethiopia. 

Several thousand Bibles and tracts are taken into North Korea each 
year, a smuggler with Seattle-based Cornerstone told NIRR.  The man, 
who requested anonymity for security reasons, gave up his job as a 
certified public accountant to become a Bible smuggler.  He shuttles 
between Seattle, Seoul, and various points in North Korea. 
...The North Korean government announced in 1972 that it had destroyed 
the last vestiges of religion there, but today acknowledges the country 
has 10,000 Christians, a figure Cornerstone puts at 100,000.  The 
constitution allows free religious thought, but not free religious 
practice.  Thus, the nation has three official churches, one Catholic 
and two Protestant.  But services are held "only when there is an 
official need," the Cornerstone smuggler said.  Services are attended 
by "draftees," some of whom come to church expecting nothing, and then 
"the spirit of God speaks to their hearts," he said.  A Bible that 
Billy Graham gave to President Kim Il Sung in 1992 is on display as an 
official gift, and "seeing it gives encouragement and comfort to North 
Korean Christians," the smuggler said. 
...This August Cornerstone will begin to beam the Bible via shortwave 
radio from the Philippines into North Korea. The broadcasts will be 
impossible to jam, unlike midwave Christian stations broadcasting from 
South Korea, the smuggler said.  During the broadcasts, the Bible will 
be read slowly so North Korean Christians can transcribe it. 

Corrections:  Our article about the New York City school board 
elections (NIRR 5/31) gave results for only the nine districts (of 32) 
that had tabulated votes.  They were also among the most closely 
watched by opposing sides. . . . Our piece about Zambian President 
Frederick Chiluba (NIRR 6/14) should have identified David Shibley as 
president of Dallas-based Global Advance. . . . Our March for Jesus 
story (NIRR 6/14) included projections that event organizers believed 
to be conservative estimates for June 12 attendance in some U.S. 
cities.  Although most of our figures accurately reflected crowd sizes, 
the Pittsburgh and Columbus marches were far smaller (25,000 and 
15,000, respectively) than expected.  We regret having provided our 
readers with inaccurate information having provided our readers with 
inaccurate information.

Vol. 7, No. 13                                                         
June 14, 1993 

Christianity benefited when communism, capitalism, and The Cross and 
the Switchblade collided in Vietnam, according to World Film Crusade 
founder Clair Dean Hutchins.  He took the English-language Christian 
film to Saigon in 1975, hoping to interest theater owners into dubbing 
the soundtrack into Vietnamese.  While Hutchins returned to the States 
to raise funds, he left the 16mm film with Vietnamese Christians in a 
Saigon house church.  Shortly thereafter, Saigon fell to the 
communists, ending the translation project.  But in 1991 police raided 
the house church, and confiscated the hidden film.  Soon, bootleg 
copies of the film were circulating on the black market and in rental 
shops.  One enterprising video store owner dubbed the movie into 
Vietnamese, reaching far more viewers than expected, Hutchins said. 
...Free from a Ho Chi Minh City prison: Tran Paul Ai, general 
superintendent of the Assemblies of God in Vietnam.  Ai was arrested 
early in 1991 for "advocat[ing] ideas of insurrection," and was 
sentenced without trial.  He suffered from malaria and an ulcer while 
in prison, but led 36 inmates and a guard to Christ.  Upon release, Ai 
rejoined his wife and five children (the youngest was born after he was 
jailed).  Known for his compassion, he helped the AG develop drug 
rehabilitation centers and a home for elderly women and street 
children. 

China's ostensible moves toward religious freedom are deceptive, Asia 
Watch and the Puebla Institute say in their latest reports on religious 
persecution.  As Chinese authorities attempt to present a clean human 
rights record to Westerners, they release long-imprisoned dissidents 
and avoid obvious persecution methods that capture attention and hurt 
China's reputation overseas.  However, church raids, property 
confiscation, surveillance, and brief detainments have become more 
common, the groups reported.  Asia Watch's "Continuing Religious 
Repression in China" summary, and Puebla's fifth annual report on the 
"continued persecution of Christians in China," both agree that in the 
past year the Chinese government has tightened its control over 
approved worship, and increased coercion and abuse against unauthorized 
religious groups, including independent Christians, Muslims, and 
Tibetan Buddhists.  Each group's study documents about 100 cases of 
Chinese church leaders or lay people who are or were imprisoned or 
deprived of liberties because of their faith.  Among the methods of 
persecution are restriction, imprisonment, torture, and official 
violence; some cases ended in death.  Causes for the increased 
repression include fear of democratic counter-revolutions under the 
guise of religion, and widespread growth of Christianity among Chinese 
youth.  The groups estimate tens of millions of religious Chinese, many 
of them Christians, worship outside the major five state-sanctioned 
religions. 
...The government's brutal tactics were illustrated by one account of 
the persecution of Christians by the Chinese Public Security Bureau in 
Shaanxi Province, southwest of Beijing.  Nine police officers 
reportedly invaded a house church in Taoyuan, Xunyang County March 27, 
according to a four-page May letter by 22-year-old Xu Fang, one of two 
female victims.  The women and three Chinese men visiting from Ankang 
County were singled out from the nearly 30 congregants "without a word 
of explanation," and were handcuffed.  News Network International (NNI) 
sources indicated the five may have been suspected of having foreign 
Christian contacts, since Ankang is an area supplied with Bibles from 
the West via churches in Henan Province.  Police stripped and beat the 
men and women with bamboo rods, and forced members of the church to do 
the same under threat of being beaten themselves.  Eventually the 
victims passed out, Xu said.  Police moved them to another location 
overnight, where they were beaten further, hung bleeding from the 
ceiling, and otherwise physically and psychologically abused.  Finally 
they were taken to a police station where they were held eight days 
before being released. 
...One of the men, 21-year-old Lai Manping, died a few days later, 
apparently of internal injuries sustained in the beating.  Although a 
doctor had treated some of his external injuries, Lai was refused 
necessary medical care in detention. An official autopsy listed his 
cause of death as "sickness," NNI reported.  Lai's relatives have 
requested a formal investigation, but their pleas have gone unheeded, 
according to the Rutherford Institute, an international 
religious-liberties group.  RI President John Whitehead said 
authorities were detaining Christians to keep the incident from public 
disclosure. Since late April, more than 90 Christians in the area have 
been imprisoned and abused. 

In the face of endangered religious freedom, several Christian church 
bodies in Bulgaria have joined in an alliance. The United Evangelical 
Churches was founded in Sofia May 10 by 100 representatives of Baptist, 
Methodist, Church of God, Pentecostal, and Congregational 
denominations.  Baptist Union President Teodor Angelov, who was elected 
to head the group, said the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and remaining 
communists in the government were behind a well-organized 
disinformation campaign against evangelicals.  Members reported that 
media have classified all evangelical groups as sects, along with the 
Mormons and Hare Krishnas.  One paper reported that such sects bring 
with them "drugs, organized crime, terrorist groups, and dirty money 
laundering."  An article from the Black Sea area allegedly accused 
evangelical pastors of cannibalism.  Some Orthodox leaders and media 
have cited nationalistic reasons Bulgaria needs no evangelicals: the 
country is already Christian, meaning largely Orthodox.  Angelov said 
the rapid growth within evangelical churches has angered Orthodox 
leaders.  For example, the Baptist Union's nine churches had 850 
members before the fall of communism a few years ago.  Now, attendance 
throughout the more than 25 congregations totals between 2,000 and 
3,000, said Bill Wardlaw, a Southern Baptist foreign missions 
representative. 
...Because critics of evangelicals have suggested permitting only 
long-standing Bulgarian faith groups -- Orthodox, Muslims, Catholics, 
Armenians, and Jews -- the United Evangelical Churches drafted a law 
proposing religious liberty. Representatives of the group presented the 
plan to the government's religious affairs chief and to a religion 
adviser to President Zhelyu Zhelev.  They stressed the positive role of 
evangelicals in Bulgarian history, and noted that they, too, had been 
imprisoned for their faith under communism.  The alliance also will 
present its draft to Parliament. 

Zambia's president, who said he would govern by Christian principles, 
continues to seek church leaders' support in his anti-corruption and 
evangelistic campaigns.  Frederick Chiluba, an Assemblies of God layman 
elected in 1991 (NIRR 1/27/92), hailed a church leaders' convocation as 
his country's first gathering to include participants from all 
charismatic and pentecostal groups, as well as several other 
evangelical bodies.  At the conference, sponsored by Dallas-based 
Global Outreach, 161 pastors and evangelists from 27 denominations 
pledged to commit themselves "to scatter the works of darkness," live 
God-honoring lives, and commit themselves to Zambia-based evangelism, 
discipleship, and church planting. The country's inhabitants have 
fallen victim to malnutrition from recurrent drought, and to a 25% 
AIDS-infection rate among adults.  Global Outreach founder David 
Shibley said he was encouraged that Zambian believers might send out 
missionaries on a large scale, making their country the first in Africa 
to do so. 

Evangelicals in Guatemala have mixed views on the ouster of President 
Jorge Serrano, an avowed Christian.  The International Alliance of 
Christian Political Parties and Movements (IACPPM) reports that 
evangelicals had high hopes for the educated Serrano (NIRR 5/4/92), but 
were frustrated by his lack of success.  After his majority-vote 
election, Serrano soon excluded the various parties and groups that had 
allied to support his bid.  According to evangelical sources, he made 
alliances with the most corrupt politicians of Guatemala when political 
pressures increased.  As his alliances crumbled in April and his 
approval ratings plummeted, his government faltered.  Serrano's 
"governing style was authoritarian and ostentatious," said Marco Tulio 
Cajas, IACPPM's secretary general, and his suspension of the 
constitution was "apparently a personal decision" supported briefly by 
an army with little true conviction. 
...Serrano's administration "lacked any hint of religion," Cajas told 
NIRR, except for occasional meetings with pastors, or his regular 
attendance at the pentecostal El Shaddai church.  "He had none of the 
moral impact that former president [Efrain] Rios Montt had.  On the 
contrary, his personal lifestyle of ostentatious wealth -- with the 
accumulation of homes, airplanes, and horses -- made many ask if he 
were really a Christian," the secretary general noted. 
...But others say Serrano frequently gave testimony of his faith to 
other politicians.  He told at least one colleague he had witnessed to 
Fidel Castro four different times, and led nearly 2,000 church leaders 
in a March prayer meeting. 
...Still, especially troubling to evangelicals were Serrano's lack of 
accountability and difficulty accepting advice. Several pastors tried 
to counsel him, without success, before his fall.  Jos  Gonz lez, 
IACPPM's international liaison, saw evidences of a weakening moral 
stand.  Gonz lez said, "I am convinced he was a sincere, committed 
believer, but with character flaws, an uncontrolled temper, and a 
pedantic need to control discussions."  As Cajas summarized, "He is, 
perhaps, an example of knowledge lacking wisdom." 
...For the first time, Guatemalans solved a political crisis with a 
non-violent national consensus of the political and civilian sectors, 
Cajas said.  He credited both God and Guatemala's high population of 
evangelicals (25%) for this positive change toward democratic methods.  
Said Gonz lez, "May we learn our lesson -- and well -- lest we repeat 
it!" 

Serbian Orthodox Church officials and 3,000 Belgraders called for the 
resignation of communist Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic during 
their first celebration of Ascension Day in 50 years.  The country's 
top priests issued a statement, UPI reported, that said Milosevic, 
often accused of masterminding the former Yugoslavia's bloodbath, had 
put the Serbs "between the hammer of a civil war and an anvil of 
[United Nations] economic sanctions."  The priests suggested the 
current authorities, who "lack the trust of the nation," step down and 
let "people of high intellectual and moral standards" assume 
leadership.  It is highly unlikely Milosevic will follow the priests' 
advice, news sources said. 
...Leaders of several religious groups asked President Clinton, again, 
to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnians.  In a June 1 open letter 
in USA Today, representatives for the Catholic Diocese of Los Angeles, 
the city's branch of the American Jewish Congress, the LA Muslim 
Women's League, the Muslim Public Affairs Council, and Americans for 
Justice for Bosnian Children said 70 days ago Clinton had promised that 
Bosnia was among his highest priorities.  But by continuing the arms 
embargo, they maintained, the United States and the United Nations 
"have facilitated the genocide." The group leaders said the problems of 
Bosnia were inescapable, but by sponsoring a one-sided embargo, "we 
have assumed responsibility for the bloodshed and atrocities."  The 
American people, they said, would support any move to allow the 
Bosnians to defend themselves, "the only language the aggressors 
understand." 
...In terms of religion, Nagorno-Karabakh is a Bosnia in reverse.  In 
the formerly communist-dominated region of central Asia, Muslims are 
being accused of seeking ethnic cleansing of Orthodox Christians.  In 
1989, the ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh petitioned Moscow for 
administrative independence from surrounding Azerbaijan.  The people of 
the isolated Armenian enclave have been paying for their faux pas ever 
since Soviet disintegration allowed the Azeris to engage them in a 
prolonged regional armed conflict.  After five years of the ethnic war, 
humanitarian agencies still have had little access to the embattled 
region. 

Bottles, rocks, and knives were the weapons used against a group of 
Southern Baptist missionaries in Venezuela recently.  Two were 
seriously injured in the attack outside Camp Carabobo, the country's 
National Baptist Convention center.  Missionary Roy Hawkins was hit in 
the eye with a stone, forcing a cornea transplant.  He has partial 
vision loss, which may be permanent.  Maintenance volunteer George 
Wilson was cut in the face and underwent plastic surgery. 
...The attack is a result of a months-long battle over control of 78 
acres adjacent to the camp near Valencia. Squatters had tried to claim 
the land, on which the Baptists plan to construct new convention 
offices.  A Venezuelan law allows citizens to build and farm on 
abandoned land, which the squatters considered the property to be.  
Some 300 families, nearly 700 people, had erected shelters on the 
property.  Some had been led to believe they had legally purchased the 
land from individuals authorities have not yet been able to identify.  
From the squatters' first appearance, the Baptists requested a police 
security patrol.  Several weeks ago the national guard removed the 
squatters after eight other unsuccessful eviction attempts.  The 
soldiers fired shots in the air and used tear gas to fend against the 
rock-throwing squatters.  The squatters' threats, however, continued 
after the eviction, and the injured men and several others were 
attacked, apparently by squatters hiding in the grass, near their 
pick-up trucks at their work site. 
...Several area projects have been stalled by the conflict: a medical 
clinic, a job training program for abandoned women, a preschool/first 
grade.  In addition, the convention was forced to build an expensive 
security wall and hire security patrols.  The foreign bureau of Baptist 
Press reported that camp director Hugh Redmon asked for prayer for the 
missions workers' safety in continuing ministry. 

Despite a "sluggish economic recovery" and "uncertain economic times," 
Americans are giving more to charity, reports the American Association 
of Fund-Raising Council Trust for Philanthropy in New York.  Americans 
gave 2.01% of their personal incomes to charity in 1992, the most since 
1971.  Overall donations to non-profits totaled $124.31 billion, 2.3% 
higher than in 1991 after adjustments for inflation.  Almost $110 
billion came from individuals (living and by bequest, accounting for 88 
cents of every charity dollar), $8.33 billion from foundations (up 
3.8%, with asset growth over 14%), and $6 billion from corporations 
(down 3.8%). 
...Religious groups benefited most, with donations of $56.7 billion (up 
1.2% after inflation), accounting for 45.6% of all contributions.  
Despite some overlap with religious donations, education received $14 
billion, health $10.2 billion, human services $11.57 billion, 
arts/culture/humanities $9.3 billion, social improvement $5 billion, 
animals and environment $3.1 billion, and international affairs $1.7 
billion.  Since the survey began in 1959, increases have been steady, 
with the exception of 1990, acknowledged as the first year of the 
recession. 

Bezek Telecommunications, Israel's official phone company, has been 
reaching out to Jews first, but also to Gentiles. The company set up a 
fax line (972-2612-222) in January for worshipers to send prayer 
requests to the Western Wall in Jerusalem.  Bezek workers place the 
requests at the holy site, where many Jews believe God reads the 
messages.  This month former U.S. President Ronald Reagan and 
evangelist Billy Graham are scheduled to help launch the Jerusalem 
Christian Prayer Line, a cooperative effort between Bezek and the 
Jerusalem Christian Review newspaper.  Church volunteers with 
counseling experience tell callers about the Christian community in the 
Holy City, and take requests for prayer, according to service director 
Dan Mazar.  Call 972-2323-232 or 1-900-HOLYLAND ($1.59/minute). 

The show went on, three days late and without its original 
"anti-semitic tone."  Jesus Was His Name continued its $24million North 
American tour with a shortened engagement at New York's Radio City 
Music Hall.  The multimedia spectacle, which incorporates 60 stage 
actors with widescreen film technology, was accused by several 
religious groups of stereotyping Jews.  The show outlines 34 episodes 
in Christ's life, including his crucifixion, and draws its dialogue 
straight from the New Revised Standard Version of the Gospels.  
Complaints from the American Jewish Committee, the National Conference 
of Catholic Bishops, and others arose over what were perceived as 
negative portrayals of Jews, news sources reported.  In the show, 
temple priests wore black robes and masks resembling Darth Vader, and 
made snake-like hissing sounds.  The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai 
B'rith issued a statement saying, "The Jewish people should not be 
portrayed as guilty of deicide," and that "all humanity" bore the 
responsibility for Jesus' death. 
...PAX Productions pacified the critics by changing the questioned 
elements before the New York opening.  A statement said the company 
wanted to avoid any potential offense.  Ticket holders were offered 
refunds or exchanges for other dates, and a statement read before the 
performance clarifies that it is not intended to be anti-semitic, 
charges that were first raised in New York.  Jesus, the producers said, 
was designed to deliver a "strong message of hope."  The show's 
creator, Robert Hossein, produced the original Les Miserables.  The 
play opened in Paris late in 1991, and ran for 152 European 
performances.  When Jesus Was His Name closes in October, the company 
will have played 31 cities. 
...St. Petersburg, Russia, hosted a Messianic Jewish Music Festival 
sponsored by an international coalition of believers in Yeshua.  For 
three nights last month, the public was invited to meetings in the 
former Leningrad's 4,000-seat recital hall and a popular theater.  Each 
meeting began with a free musical concert by various Jewish-Christian 
artists. After the performances, an invitation was extended to accept 
Yeshua as Messiah.  Organizers Jonathan Bernis, a Messianic rabbi with 
Hear O Israel Ministries, and Sid Roth, host of the Messianic Vision 
radio talk show, said the festival's impact was like the responses 
recorded in the book of Acts.  Conservative estimates placed overall 
attendance at 13,000, with 4,000 turned away the last night for lack of 
seating.  The opposition of the Orthodox Jewish community reportedly 
heightened interest, and the leader of St. Petersburg's largest 
synagogue angered some congregants by attending after he had forbidden 
them to do so.  Still, organizers said as many as 4,000, about 2,000 of 
them Jewish, responded to invitations, more than 1,500 in the last 
concert hall meeting, according to Messianic Jewish Alliance's Bruce 
Cohen and the Union of Messianic Jewish Congregations' Michael Bryan.  
Street outreaches were directed by Baruch Goldstein, who leads 
Toronto's Congregation Melech Yisrael and Messiah Has Come Ministries.  
In six days of pavement preaching, teams distributed 300,000 pieces of 
literature, and led 500 to faith in Yeshua.  Organizers hope for a 
long-reaching impact: the concerts were filmed for broadcast on Russian 
television this year; more than 5,000 people will soon have free 
Bibles; and interest in Messianic congregations in the former Soviet 
Union is growing. 
...Moscow's historic Bolshoi Theater will host free July performances 
of "I Am the Way," a life-of-Christ opera written in 1963 by 
Metropolitan Opera star Jerome Hines, who also plays the lead.  "As a 
gift to the Russian people, every American performer has agreed to 
donate his time for this production," said Patrick Kavanaugh, director 
of the sponsoring Christian Performing Artists' Fellowship, a Northern 
Virginia ministry.  A television crew will film the opera, which has 
been performed more than 80 times, for a nationwide Russian broadcast 
with subtitles in September. 

A Russian delegation of penal and religious leaders visited the 
Christian Humaita Prison in Brazil last month to observe alternative 
concepts for penal reform.  As in America and Brazil, Russia's rising 
crime rate has increased prison populations and strained limited 
resources.  Russian penal officials conventionally look to better 
facilities as solutions, Prison Fellowship International President Ron 
Nikkel told NIRR.  But the Russian group had heard from at least one 
Russian warden who had experienced success with his prison's ministry 
program involving priests and laymen.  Plus, the group had read about 
the success at Humaita, which emphasizes moral and spiritual change.  
The two prison officials, two Orthodox priests, and a lay advocate for 
prison reform concluded they would have to see it to believe it. 
...In 1984 Humaita Prison in Sao Jos  dos Campos was "rehabilitated."  
Two devout Christians -- a judge and a city alderman -- reopened the 
failed government facility as a private institution.  The operation 
teamed up with Prison Fellowship-Brazil in 1988 to introduce a 
spiritually based program.  Inmates are screened to determine a 
profession of commitment to personal change.  Humaita emphasizes 
Christian teaching, the power of God's love, and disciplined personal 
behavior.  The program has slashed its 360 inmates' criminal recidivism 
from 70% to 4%. 
...The prison functions without government support.  Its two paid staff 
are assisted by about 500 Christian volunteers who cook, doctor, and 
teach.  Reliable inmates serve as administrators and guards.  Humaita 
is a model of cost-effective rehabilitation unsurpassed anywhere in the 
world, Nikkel told NIRR.  He said the Russian observers are considering 
how to apply what they have learned to Russia's troubled prisons. 

A former Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer has a new commission.  
According to the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada Task Force, Rob 
Pattison now patrols the streets of metropolitan Halifax, Nova Scotia, 
fulfilling the ministry vision he presented to his church, a desire to 
begin a mobile soup kitchen.  Donations have included a used school 
bus, its renovation, a two-way radio unit, and local radio advertising 
for the ministry.  The enthusiastic assistance of local people has 
enabled Pattison's Street Connection ministry to distribute hot meals, 
clothes, Bibles, and personal care to poor areas on Tuesdays and 
Saturdays, and to a "red-light" district on Friday nights.  Pattison 
says of the six-month-old ministry: "We have Bibles and tracts on the 
bus, but we don't push Jesus on anyone.  We're just building 
relationships of trust with the people, and the Holy Spirit is doing 
the work." 

As in his 1952 and 1968 crusades in western Pennsylvania, thousands 
braved a cold rain to hear Billy Graham speak, this time at Three 
Rivers Stadium June 2-6.  Mayor Sophie Masloff provided a "renaissance" 
theme; just as the city had been reborn after great adversity, so it 
welcomed his "message of spiritual renewal and the importance of 
faith." 
...Pittsburgh has more bridges than any other U.S. city, an analogy not 
wasted on organizers.  The crusade had the support of 1,050 churches in 
65 denominations, and enjoyed generous cooperation from the Catholic 
church (six members of the 77-person executive committee were 
Catholic).  The crusade was chaired by retired ALCOA Chairman Fred 
Fetterolf, an Episcopalian.  Orthodox Christian leaders, however, 
refused to participate in the "city of churches'" crusade, and 
involvement by African-American Christians was not nearly 
representative of the city's 25% black population.  Still, Graham said 
he was impressed with the unity of the city's religious leaders, and 
spent one morning meeting with eight bishops and executives from 
various denominations. 
...Graham's sermons were sprinkled with reference to Pittsburgh sports 
motifs, and two crusade guests were athletes:  Steelers' place kicker 
Gary Anderson, and former pro hockey player Bill Butters of the 
Minnesota North Stars. Other speakers included Susan Baker, wife of the 
former secretary of state and a Washington evangelical, and Prison 
Fellowship's Chuck Colson.  In addition to Graham's crusades, associate 
evangelist Ralph Bell held mini-crusades at six area prisons.  The 
planners also sought to assist the homeless and poor with a 
Love-in-Action outreach.  Kits of personal hygiene products were 
distributed to shelters, and organizers sponsored a charitable drive 
designed to provide clothing and baby items to the needy.  Related 
drives collected more than 43,600 pounds of food.  Before the crusade 
raised $180,000 over its $1.45 million budget, organizers said they 
intended to funnel $100,000 into Pittsburgh 2000, a social 
actionevangelistic effort to keep the momentum and unity going between 
the sponsoring churches. 
...Youth were a special outreach target.  A special Kids Crusade on 
Saturday afternoon treated 17,000 children and parents to musical 
performances by Psalty the Singing Songbook, The Donut Man, Steve 
Green, Cliff Barrows, and a 2,000voice children's choir.  In each of 
two youth nights, the 74-year-old evangelist warned the audience 
against premarital sex, hedonism, and an inability to say "No."  Graham 
told the teens that they finally will "run out of kicks because there 
are so many kickbacks."  But, he said, even in these "dangerous and 
even desperate" times, "there is hope because there is God." Although 
Pittsburgh had many of the same problems as other major cities, the 
"God of love" could change their communities by first changing peoples' 
lives.  All in all, God reigned despite the rain, as a BGEA news 
release summarized the crusade.  About 171,500 people attended, an 
average of almost 31,000 each night, and organizers estimated that 
12,515, 6% of all attendees, came forward as "inquirers" to learn more 
about the gospel. 
...BGEA's first Spanish School of Evangelism drew about 3,200 Hispanic 
leaders from North and South America to Los Angeles June 8-11 to equip 
pastors to reach the often-forgotten segment of society.  "The Hispanic 
church is one of the fastest-growing churches in America.  In fact, by 
the end of the century there will be 30 million Hispanics here," Norm 
Mydske, BGEA's Latin America director, told NIRR.  "The Anglo community 
has neglected this community, but we can't afford to any longer."  More 
than 24 local Hispanic pastors worked with BGEA for 10 months to plan 
the event, which included Spanish leaders Luis Palau, Alberto Mottesi, 
Brazilian evangelist Caio Fabio, and Danny DeLeon, pastor of LA's 
Calvary Temple, the largest U.S. Hispanic church.  BGEA's Franklin 
Graham and Cliff Barrows also spoke at evening evangelistic sessions.  
All workshops were conducted in Spanish, with simultaneous 
interpretation into English available on 500 headsets, and a 
Spanish-language version of World Wide Pictures' new film, The Eye of 
the Storm, was shown each night.  BGEA has scheduled two more Spanish 
Schools of Evangelism for November in Texas.  . . . More than 25 key 
Hispanic leaders will gather in Chicago Aug. 5-8 for a leadership 
summit.  Their goal is to encourage pastors and workers in their 
communities, according to Noel Castellanos, pastor of La Villita 
("Little Village") Community Church. The summit, sponsored by John 
Perkins' Christian Community Development Association and the Los 
Angeles-based Hispanic Association for Bilingual and Bicultural 
Ministries, will focus on how Hispanic churches and ministries can work 
toward community empowerment, transformation and development. 

Grace Community Church of Bethel, Conn., will appeal its zoning-request 
case to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Since 1988, the non-denominational 
congregation of 500 has questioned the constitutionality of a local 
ordinance (NIRR 2/10/92). The measure bars church construction anywhere 
in town without a special, subjectively based permit, said Nelson 
Malwitz, the church board member who heads the legal charge.  Lower 
courts have ruled against the church, stating that religious groups 
were equally subject to the law.  But, Malwitz noted, theaters, clubs, 
and other constitutionally protected assemblies bore no such burden in 
Bethel.  Since Connecticut's Supreme Court refused to hear the case, he 
told NIRR, "the first state to ratify the Constitution has now 
relegated to churches a second-class status for speech, assembly and 
association."  Grace will continue to appeal its case "for the sake of 
those who will come after us," he said. Religious groups must be given 
equal access to use public school facilities, the U.S. Supreme Court 
ruled in the case of Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School 
District (NIRR 3/8; 12/14/92).  The case pitted an evangelical church 
and its pastor, John Steigerwald, against a New York school district 
that refused to allow the religious group to use public school 
facilities to show a James Dobson film series after-hours.  The 2nd 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a summary judgment that Center 
Moriches, under its policy in accordance with New York state law, was 
correct to reject the church's request, because public schools were 
off-limits to "any group for religious purposes." 
...The high court unanimously rejected that "invalid" reasoning.  
Writing for the court, Justice Byron White said school districts may 
bar all after-hours uses of facilities, but if they allow access to 
some groups, they cannot discriminate against others simply on 
religious grounds.  White found no evidence the film showing would have 
been prohibited if the presentation had not been "from a religious 
perspective."  Past rulings, he wrote, barred government regulation of 
free speech to "favor some viewpoints or ideas at the expense of 
others."  Using the "Lemon test" (NIRR 12/14/92) of deciding a secular 
purpose, a main effect of advancement or inhibition of religion, or 
excessive entanglement of church and state, White said such equal 
treatment is not a violation of the constitutional mandate of 
church-state separation.  Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and 
Anthony Kennedy wrote opinions saying the ruling could have been 
decided solely on freespeech rights of religious groups, and required 
no citing of precedents. 
...Leading religious rights advocates and church-state separationists 
agreed with the Supreme Court's decision. American Center for Law and 
Justice Chief Counsel Jay Sekulow, who argued the Lamb's Chapel 
position, declared the decision a free-speech victory, noting "the 
court is saying that religious speech cannot be extricated from the 
public arena." Stephen Shapiro of the American Civil Liberties Union 
said the justices' decision "was tied closely to the facts of the 
case," and that the court "walked the tightrope fairly well."  And 
Elliot Mincberg, People for the American Way's legal director, said the 
decision upheld free-speech rights "without causing problems for 
church-state separation." 

The recitation of "one nation under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance 
does not violate the Constitution, as Chicagoarea atheist Robert 
Sherman (NIRR 3/22) maintained in a 1988 lawsuit.  Sherman, whose son 
is a public school student, sought to have daily recitations of the 
pledge barred from elementary schools.  The U.S. Supreme Court, without 
comment, let stand earlier rulings of a federal judge and the 7th 
District Circuit Court of Appeals that said the pledge's reference to 
God was "ceremonial deism" that had "lost through rote repetition any 
significant content."  The high court ruled in 1943, in response to a 
protest by Jehovah's Witnesses, that states cannot force students to 
participate, but that schools may lead the pledge to the flag.  Sherman 
told reporters the judges had rendered "the First Amendment 
meaningless" by establishing religion, and the decision "shows that we 
need more atheists on the Supreme Court." 

Student-led prayers at public school graduations are still permissible: 
at least in Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. The U.S. Supreme Court, 
without comment, let stand a 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling 
that allows the prayers, as long as a majority of the senior class 
votes to include them.  In 1992's Jones v. Clear Creek Independent 
School District (NIRR 5/3), the court decided that the Supreme Court's 
earlier decision in Lee v. Weisman to prohibit organized prayers at a 
Rhode Island high school graduation did not necessitate a ban on the 
student-initiated prayers. 
...There is some debate whether the legal battle lines have been erased 
or redrawn.  The American Center for Law and Justice said the Supreme 
Court's pass on the Jones case "clears the way for students nationwide 
to pray and speak out about God" at public school commencements.  "A 
student's right to free speech does not end when he or she steps up to 
the graduation podium," said ACLJ attorney Jay Sekulow.  But Americans 
United for Separation of Church and State (AU) cautioned against 
drawing broad conclusions from the high court's refusal to take the 
case.  Executive Director Barry Lynn said the court usually accepts 
cases only when federal courts have issued conflicting opinions.  By 
refusing the case, the court sets no national precedents, he said, and 
applies only to the lower court's jurisdiction. 
...Even before the Supreme Court announcement, opposing sides launched 
their volleys.  The ACLJ sent bulletins to school administrators 
affirming the legality of student-led prayers.  The American Civil 
Liberties Union countered with warning letters that lawsuits might 
result over scheduled prayers.  The ACLU has filed court challenges in 
several states, some of which it has lost, others of which are pending. 
 According to the Rutherford Institute, one Tennessee principal filed a 
lawsuit against the ACLU for having sent him its "misleading, 
intimidating, threatening" letter. 
...Some locales retreated from potential lawsuits by placing 
limitations on commencement prayer.  Some Akron, Ohio-area, officials 
told principals such prayers were unconstitutional.  In Elizabethtown, 
Ky., a senior was told she could pray for her classmates and their trek 
to adult life as long as she did not use the word "God."  One 
Massachusetts school board will let clergy speak as long as they sign 
an agreement promising not to pray or mention any deity.  A 
schoolscheduled baccalaureate was canceled in Georgia, and the national 
anthem replaced prayer in Emporia, Kan. 
...Other areas fought for what they believed to be students' free 
speech rights.  The Leslie, Mich., school district sponsored a 
baccalaureate service including scriptural readings, a 
non-denominational sermon, and a brief prayer by a Baptist minister.  
More than 75% of the graduating seniors attended the optional religious 
ceremony.  In Jacksonville, Fla., a U.S. District judge upheld the 
DuVall County school board's decision to allow Mandarin High School 
students to choose their own graduation messages, including prayers if 
they desired. 
...Across the country, students clashed, mostly with administrators, 
over graduation prayers.  Virginia schools experienced hundreds of 
student walkouts, petitions, and protest rallies.  A Sioux Falls, S.D., 
audience cheered a senior who said he would exercise his First 
Amendment right to free speech by praying, despite the district 
superintendent's ban on prayer; several students left the ceremony, 
saying their rights had been violated.  Gettysburg, S.D., seniors met 
and voted to include prayer, without any administration or faculty 
members present.  In Westchester County, N.Y., more than 300 people 
petitioned to allow "a tasteful reminder of the presence of God" at 
commencement.  In a southeastern Ohio district, 650 students (nearly 
50%) and teachers protested the cancellation of a commencement prayer 
service by leaving class and reciting the Lord's Prayer.  Seniors in at 
least two Indiana schools, New Castle and Muncie South Side, held 
student-led assemblies including organized prayer, on school grounds.  
When one Nashville-area valedictorian included the Lord's Prayer in his 
speech, the crowd joined in, then gave the senior a standing ovation. 

"They're doing it!" reporters shouted as the Vista, Calif., school 
board quietly opened its meeting in prayer.  The educational planning 
meetings became a spectator sport last fall, when voters elected an 
evangelical majority.  Since then, attendance has averaged 250, 
including reporters from The New York Times, CBS News, The Village 
Voice, and the Cable News Network.  During the board's brief prayer, 
floodlights glared and camcorders whirred.  "I felt like we were doing 
a lewd and lascivious act in public," Deidre Holliday, president of the 
five-member board, told NIRR.  News reports indicate that coverage is 
so heavy because some local parents, education department officials, 
and syndicated columnists fear that the conservative San Diego-area 
board will force creationism into the public schools. 

Liberty University students still qualify for state tuition-assistance 
grants, but the decision didn't come cheap.  The Virginia State Council 
of Higher Education voted 8-2 to uphold its December ruling to allow LU 
students to receive taxpayer-financed grants, provided that the 
financially beleaguered school implemented "significant" policy changes 
as regarded religion.  Among them were the elimination of LU's 
mandatory attendance at religious worship services, and the removal of 
a requirement that students and faculty sign a statement of faith.  The 
council also demanded proof of academic freedom for faculty to publish 
papers disagreeing with the school's religious views.  Under LU's 
revised standards, students and faculty must agree "to abide by" a code 
of conduct and university rules and procedures.  They are encouraged, 
but not required, to attend weekly church services; and student 
applicants are no longer asked for personal testimonies or pastoral 
recommendations.  Liberty retained its convocation (formerly chapel) 
services, with council agreement that the meetings are important to the 
campus' sense of community, and are not worship services.  New 
university publications reflect the changes.  Liberty President A. 
Pierre Guillermin told reporters he hoped potential students would be 
less tentative about attendance since the decision, and he expected 
fall enrollment to show "modest growth."  In 1992, about 1,000 students 
received the $1,300 grants, for a total of $1.2 million to Liberty 
coffers.  The Lynchburg school, founded by Jerry Falwell, is in the 
process of restructuring a $70 million debt with its creditors. 
..."Liberty has basically agreed to exchange its unique religious 
character for a government handout," said Barry Lynn, executive 
director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State (AU), 
which asked for the inquiry into Liberty's state aid.  Lynn said the 
decision meant LU could "no longer exact religious conformity."  AU and 
other critics had argued that religion is a pervasive underlying 
subject of all coursework at the university, so the school should be 
prohibited from obtaining the taxpayer-financed awards.  The council 
decision, however, affirmed that LU provided a general education, and 
was eligible for the grants under state law.  AU attorney Steven Green 
said the school will be under close scrutiny to see that it keeps its 
promised policy changes.  He also said AU will continue to monitor 
other Virginia schools known for Christian stands, namely Regent 
University (founded by Pat Robertson) in Virginia Beach and Christendom 
College in Front Royal.  He said if future challenges arose, they would 
likely take them to court rather than to the council, whose long 
consideration allowed for changes during the inquiry. 

Corrections: The University of Bridgeport (NIRR 5/17) is controlled by 
the Professors World Peace Academy, an incorporated educational 
organization established by Sun Myung Moon in 1973.  NIRR should have 
said the PWPA (rather than the Unification Church) assumed control of 
Bridgeport's properties in a financial arrangement that also gave it 
broad influence to appoint key school officials, according to press 
accounts, interviews, and a Unification Church spokesman. Because the 
PWPA acquired an existing school, it was not required to undergo 
procedures related to the establishment of new universities.  The 
school has been reaccredited since the PWPA-Bridgeport agreement. 
...On changes the church faces (NIRR 5/31), a quotation from Foursquare 
pastor Jack Hayford was attributed to Ken Engstrom, a filmmaker with 
World Wide Pictures, an affiliate of the Billy Graham Evangelistic 
Association. The annual March for Jesus is garnering more participation 
worldwide.  More than 1.5 million believers from diverse backgrounds 
and 43 countries from every continent took to the streets this year to 
celebrate publicly their common faith in Jesus Christ.  The march began 
in 1987 with 15,000 people in London, and historically, organizers say, 
has led believers to unification, repentance, cooperation, and 
reconciliation, in addition to evangelism (NIRR 6/15/92). 
...Christians in some nations marched earlier than others.  Germany, 
Denmark, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada scheduled the March for 
Jesus before June.  Stockholm, Sweden, had 10,000 marchers May 29, as 
did Ibadan, Nigeria, at Easter.  Australian churches united to march at 
Easter for the fourth time; at least 60,000 marched, with large crowds 
in major cities.  Some 50,000 marched April 3 in 45 New Zealand cities 
and towns, and organizer Gideon Hoekendijk reported conversions and 
healings during the worship and prayer time after the march.  An April 
11 march in Yverdon, Switzerland, involved 1,000 believers from 25 
churches, said Sylvain Freymond. 
...June 12 was the most popular day for the march.  Between 3,000 and 
5,000 from 30 denominations were expected to participate in Budapest, 
Hungary's first March for Jesus, followed by an evangelistic program, 
said Marta Shonek. Helsinki had several thousand participants, and 
march leaders had the chance to share their vision with the annual 
conference of the Lutheran Church, Finland's state religion, according 
to Lii Jalander.  Bridgetown, Barbados, held its first March for Jesus, 
with about 5,000 participating.  Some 5,000 Puerto Ricans marched 
through San Juan's largest and most violent and drug-infested housing 
project, and then through the business area, according to Gary 
Tuominen.  Brazil's largest march in Brasilia included 50,000; Jaoa 
Goncalves da Silva, a pastor who led hundreds of thousands of 
Christians to the streets of Brazil to pray against corruption in the 
Marcha Liberta Brasil, organized Brazil's efforts. 
...Christians in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, were pleased to march this 
year, since last year's march was canceled at the last minute due to 
political pressure from Islamic factions.  "We believe that the power 
of intercession as the churches unified can change nations.  It isn't 
just little games," said Jeremiah Kiwinda.  In Ulan Bator, Mongolia, a 
June 19 praise concert was rescheduled for June 12 so Christians could 
be linked with marchers in other nations.  Tokyo's 500 marchers passed 
through Shibuya, an area that is popular with youth, according to Eika 
Ko-kisaka; and Christians in some Middle Eastern countries were to 
"Tour for Jesus," either by prayer-walking, taking to the road in 
minibuses, or hiring boats. Around the world, marchers prayer-walked or 
held prayer drives for those in closed countries.  Youth With a 
Mission's Jim Meredith coordinated a march in Georgetown, Guyana.  It 
focused on the universality of the church, and God's people all over 
the world. 
...Some 800,000 Americans marched in more than 300 cities in all 50 
states.  Katie Burt said Pittsburgh, Pa., had about 40,000 marchers, 
and that organizers were "overwhelmed by the response."  Pastors 
marched side-by-side, followed by teen-agers, then by small children 
dressed in national costumes.  The children were to "stand in the gap 
for the nations," she said.  The rest of the Pittsburgh marchers 
followed the children en masse. 
...About 20 children led the march in Jacksonville, Fla., after 
training in intercessory prayer.  With the help of the AD 2000 and 
Beyond Movement, the boys and girls prayed for North Africa, the Middle 
East, and southern Asia -- which together are home to 95% of the 
world's unreached peoples.  The children also prayed for Jacksonville's 
sister city in the march, Murmansk, Russia.  Among the 15,000 marchers 
were children from Jacksonville's large community of Russian refugees, 
and a Russian choir.  "Interest has been phenomenal," march organizer 
Jenny Howard said. 
...In Austin, Texas, "the atmosphere for any kind of unity didn't exist 
four or five years ago," coordinator Lester Haines said.  "Today, we've 
really increased our vision, and recognize that in our diversity we can 
bless each other."  Some 25,000 people from 200 of the city's 600 
churches attended the march, conducted in Spanish and English, and 
concluded with prayers by representatives of the Asian, Spanish, and 
Anglo communities.  "The Lord is calling the city to pray together," 
said Haines, who has a three-day prayer summit scheduled in November 
for 300-400 pastors. 
...Nashville, Tenn., went all out with pageantry: a 45-piece drum 
corps, a 35-piece brass band, 80 choreographed praise dancers, and 312 
banners and flags (the 14 center banners were 15 feet tall).  Country 
music singers Ricky Skaggs and Naomi Judd were active in organization 
of the march, which expected to double its participation to 30,000.  
The city marchers hoped to draw from every denomination.  Organizer 
Terry Williams, a Baptist, said the march "sounds really charismatic, 
but it's not."  A "floodgate of Baptist churches" participated, he 
said. 
...The march in Columbus, Ohio, more than doubled last year's 12,000 
people.  Two separate streams of marchers converged at the state 
capitol, where a choir of 300 was accompanied by an orchestra of 100 on 
the statehouse steps.  The music was purposely designed to be somewhat 
liturgical, and inclusive of Catholic and many Protestant traditions.  
"We don't want to be perceived as a fringe charismatic gathering," 
organizer John Moriarty said. 
...March for Jesus organizers say they are looking forward to a Global 
March for Jesus June 25, 1994.  On that day, they say, believers in 
approximately 66 nations will take part in "the most massive prayer 
meeting in the history of Christianity . . . in thousands of locations 
around the globe. Christianity . . . in thousands of locations around 
the globe."

Vol. 7, No. 12                                                          
May 31, 1993 

More than half the population of Latin America is under 25 years old.  
Because so many are untouched by the local church, last October the 
Ibero American Confederation of Christian Mass Media and Communicators 
(COICOM) urged radio ministries to take the gospel to Hispano-American 
youth. 
...As a result, two veteran ministries are starting Latin America's 
first Christian satellite radio network.  HCJB World Radio, a 
short-wave broadcasting ministry, and TransWorld Radio, a Gospel 
network, have radio operations throughout the region.  Beginning in 
November, they will provide a 24-hour digital satellite service to beam 
"the Good News of God's Word in a contemporary format."  HCJB and TWR 
see their project as a ministry arm of the Latin church that will be 
available to all Spanish-speaking stations from the Tex-Mex border to 
the tip of Chile. 

More Latin American evangelicals are running for political office, and 
are organizing across national boundaries. According to the 
International Alliance of Christian Political Parties and Movements 
(IACPPM), evangelicals are relative newcomers to the political arena.  
For that reason, evangelicals in several countries hope to share their 
resources and expertise, and build from a common worldview and ethical 
foundation, according to Jos  Gonz lez-Souza, international liaison.  
The alliance aims to assist one another through shared educational and 
training resources. 
...Evangelical leadership throughout the hemisphere is one short-term 
goal.  Already the alliance has supported evangelical contender Casiano 
Ancalle in his bid for the Bolivian presidency.  He is reportedly 
running fourth among a dozen candidates.  Ancalle, a Quechua Indian and 
environmental engineer trained at Penn State, has served as an 
evangelist, executive secretary of the National Association of Bolivian 
Evangelicals, and as a board member of a group devoted to teaching 
biblical principles to future social, political and religious leaders.  
Eight Latin American nations have presidential elections scheduled 
during the next 18 months, Gonz lez told NIRR. 
...Gonz lez first saw potential for an alliance of Hispanic evangelical 
movements during Quincentenary celebrations of Columbus' voyage.  He 
told NIRR he assisted the Alberto Motessi Evangelistic Association with 
its outreaches to the societal and cultural elites of every capital of 
Central and South America in the latter half of 1992.  Motessi asked 
local church leaders, who organized the events in each city, to bring 
evangelical political activists to seminars Gonz lez taught. Through 
his Christian leadership training group, Semilla (the Spanish word for 
"seed"), Gonz lez advocates the education of Latin Americans in public 
policy principles from a Bible-based perspective. 
...Participant satisfaction and the unusual Christian perspective 
spurred interest from city to city, Gonz lez said, and several 
evangelicals expressed a desire to form a supportive alliance.  A 
series of February meetings in Washington, D.C., and at Semilla's home 
base in the Virginia Beach area, resulted in a first draft of guiding 
principles and a code of ethics.  The 15 participants represented nine 
political parties in seven countries, the Institute on Religion & 
Democracy reported, and the IACPPM hopes its efforts will guide 
political reform in this hemisphere, and perhaps the world. 
...When the IACPPM steering committee met again last month in 
Guatemala, three more parties joined the alliance.  The consortium 
reaffirmed its initial working documents, and appointed Guatemalan 
Marco Tulio Cajas its general secretary.  The IACPPM's first General 
Assembly was set for July 22-24 in Caracas, Venezuela.  Organizers hope 
to see 40 representatives of 15 political movements at the meetings.  
Gonz lez said there are approximately 22 such evangelical political 
movements in the Hispanic world, but none in Spain.  A news conference 
will announce the alliance's official formation after formal 
proceedings.  The IACPPM has planned a seminar on campaigning for the 
July gathering, and a November fund-raising seminar in Panama. 

In an effort to warm relations with the U.S. government, Cuba's Fidel 
Castro sent 10 religious leaders to Washington May 18-20 to meet with 
key members of Congress and the Clinton Administration.  The Cuban 
clergy visit was sponsored by the National Council of Churches, the 
Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization, and Pastors for 
Peace.  The ministerial leaders attempted to meet with various 
congressional staffers during their visit in hopes of easing the U.S. 
hard-line against the communist island.  While it permits some 
humanitarian relief help, the U.S. government prohibits American 
businesses, including tourism, from working in Cuba.  The delegation 
included leaders from the Ecumenical Council, the Episcopal Church, the 
Methodist Church, the Fraternity of Baptist Churches, the Pentecostal 
Christian Church, and the Church of God.  Lately Castro has encouraged 
evangelical activity in Cuba.  Baptist World Alliance and the 
Assemblies of God have had missionaries working with Cubans for several 
years. 

Immorality, divorce, child abuse, and the witchcraft of voodoo are all 
too common in the Caribbean, according to more than 25 evangelical 
leaders from nine of the area's islands.  They met last month with Luis 
Bush and others from the AD 2000 and Beyond Movement to discuss 
strategies for ensuring their goal that every people group have a 
church and every person hear the Gospel by the year 2000.  In spite of 
the social and spiritual challenges, the leaders agreed that many of 
"these problems provide a climate highly conducive to the spread of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ," citing increasing conversations in Haiti, 
Jamaica and Barbados.  The leaders also composed a declaration that 
committed them to prayer, unity, and networking with other Caribbean 
Christian leaders with the same vision for world evangelization.  They 
acknowledged that they faced "very serious moral decadence in each 
island," but were thankful for the rapid growth of the church and the 
addition of "thousands to the evangelical community" over the past two 
years. 

"God didn't die, not even under socialism," said Andrew Greeley, the 
Catholic priest, novelist, and social researcher who authored the 
"Religion Around the World" report of the International Social Survey 
Program and the Chicago-based National Opinion Research Center.  
Religion "shows some signs of new vitality," Greeley said of the poll 
conducted in 1991 and early 1992 across 14 countries, mostly in Europe. 
 In all countries but two, a majority expressed a belief in God and 
religious affiliation.  Eleven countries had a majority belief in life 
after death. 
...Belief in God is stronger than ever in many places.  In the United 
States, 94% expressed belief, with Ireland close behind at 92%.  About 
80% of Italians, and more than two-thirds of Israelis, Britons, and New 
Zealanders also acknowledged a belief in God.  About 35% of U.S. 
respondents said they felt "extremely close to God." 
...Religion is enjoying a resurgence in Europe's former socialist 
lands.  For example, in Hungary in 1986, about 25% of respondents said 
they attended church, 6% of them "frequently."  The survey found that 
now about 65% attend church, 19% frequently.  Greeley said the former 
socialistic countries were not experiencing a massive "return to 
religion," but had recorded a "dramatic and unexpected" revival in 
religious faith. 
...A belief in life after death struck Greeley most, he said, 
signifying a hope of an eternal future, perhaps a result of the fall of 
communism.  In both the former East Germany and Slovenia, more than 
half of all 18- to 34-year-olds acknowledged an afterlife, compared 
with only 30% in the 45-54 age bracket.  Greeley said young people were 
following in their grandparents' footsteps, since many older Europeans' 
religious faith pre-dated communism. 
...Showing the least religious fervor was the former East Germany.  
Only 26% said they believe in God, and 61% said they are atheists.  The 
next-least religious land was the Netherlands, where slightly more than 
50% said they believe in God, with 22% of those polled professing 
atheism.  In Slovenia, more than 20% claimed to be atheist. 
...Respondents in five countries were asked about their belief in the 
occult, superstitions, and pagan religion.  "Not unimportant" the 
survey said, was the "survival of the animism and belief in magic."  
Belief in these pre-Christian elements (including astrology, fortune 
telling, and good-luck charms) were highest in Slovenia and Great 
Britain.  East Germany recorded the highest number -- 20% -- of true 
secularists, with no belief in God or superstition. 

A promise of "duty to God" will remain part of the Boy Scouts' 
membership oath.  A panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
ruled 2-1 that the organization need not provide "a place of public 
accommodation."  The group's required affirmation of belief in God did 
not violate the 1964 Civil Rights Act by, in effect, barring atheists 
or agnostics from membership, the panel said.  News reports indicated 
the original case had been filed by Elliot Welsh, an agnostic, whose 
10-year-old son, Mark, was excluded from a Tiger Cub chapter. 

Hotel rooms may be appropriate places to distribute Gideon Bibles, but 
public schools are not.  The Rensselaer (Ind.) school board 
unsuccessfully asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear its case against 
prohibiting the free distribution of Bibles to fifth-graders.  The high 
court, without comment, left the ban intact.  "Our private prayers have 
been answered," Allen Berger said of his four-year legal battle to have 
the practice stopped.  The Indiana Civil Liberties Union represented 
the father of two in the successful case against the school district.  
John Price, Rensselaer's attorney, maintained that the Gideons were 
like other groups that addressed schoolchildren, and that the ruling 
amounted to censorship of their speech, simply because it was religious 
in nature.  The Gideons had no official comment. 

Indiana seems to have more than its share of battles on the 
constitutionality of prayer at public school graduations. The Indiana 
Civil Liberties Union backed off its earlier mass-mailing warnings to 
school boards that it might litigate if schools allowed graduation 
prayers.  The ICLU settled a case brought by five graduating seniors at 
Frankfort High School who were denied permission to pray although the 
senior class had approved it.  The Frankfort seniors, and others across 
the state, were represented by John Price and his Equal Justice Under 
Law Institute (EJULI) in Indianapolis.  The ICLU had written 
superintendents that they might violate free speech if they censored a 
speech by a student, even if it included a religious message, Price 
said.  The two groups agreed that as long as the city school system did 
not censor or endorse the speeches, students could choose to pray at 
commencement.  Several school districts, including Elkhart Independent, 
have adopted school policies that clarify official positions on 
student-led prayer. 
...Invited, uninvited, reinvited: When Rep. Steve Buyer would not 
provide a written guarantee he would not pray in his remarks to the 
graduating class of Kankakee Valley High School in Wheatfield, 
Principal Dale Osburn canceled his invitation.  The first-term 
Republican and active evangelical said "offering a prayer or referring 
to God is not a threat to our society."  But in light of the ICLU-EJULI 
settlement, Buyer again was asked to give the May 29 commencement 
address, which he did.  Buyer, a Methodist, said that in Lee v. 
Weisman, the Supreme Court had "overstepped the bounds of common sense 
in its pursuit to sanitize religion for public conversation." 

The results are mixed in the New York City school board elections (NIRR 
5/17).  The Associated Press estimated that conservatives elected 51 of 
87 candidates they supported, mostly in middle-class and poorer 
sections.  Christian Coalition spokesmen estimated that as many as half 
of the 130 candidates they supported won, and that the group was 
encouraged by its inroads in "liberal strongholds in Manhattan and the 
Bronx."   Liberals elected 50 of 84 candidates they favored.  Three of 
five self-avowed homosexuals won school board seats, two in Manhattan, 
one in Brooklyn.  Like the CC, news sources said People for the 
American Way and the Empire State Pride Agenda also claimed limited 
success from their educational efforts.  Of the 135 newcomers to school 
boards, about 23% were backed by liberal, 18% by the religious right.  
Liberals will hold a majority on four of nine NYC school boards; 
conservatives will control three.  Two districts reelected members 
Chancellor Joseph Fernandez had ousted last year.  They were linked to 
a report alleging corruption in his department. Some 425,000 people 
voted, about 12.5% of those eligible. 

Children raised in consistently Christian homes are more likely to keep 
the faith in later years, says a recent study on apostasy.  
Sociologists Merlin Brinkerhoff and Marlene Mackie polled social 
science students at the University of Calgary and the University of 
Nebraska in the mid-1980s, and found that young adults were more likely 
to retain their early religious beliefs if they attended church at age 
10 and did not experience their first religious doubts until their 
late-teen years.  The more regular the church attendance, and the later 
the doubts came, the more persistent their beliefs.  The groups most 
likely to retain the religious upbringing of their youth were Catholics 
and conservative Protestants. 
...Most likely to dismiss religion were those raised as mainline 
Protestants.  Many had experienced doubts as young as 13 or 14 years 
old, and 40% of apostate college students cited hypocrisy as the cause 
of their disdain for religion.  The researchers said idealistic youth 
who witnessed racism and dishonesty within the church, or whose parents 
attended only on special occasions and holidays, also believed religion 
had no ability to improve a person's life.  Those who  abandoned their 
faith were reported to be less happy and dissatisfied with life, hold 
more liberal views, and exhibit lower self-esteem than their religious 
counterparts.  The study was published in The Review of Religious 
Research. 

Evangelical Christianity is growing among teens in America, but still 
lags in some areas, according to a recent Gallup poll.  Nationwide, 39% 
of teen-agers (36% of adults) say they are "born-again" or 
"evangelical" Christians, an increase of 4% since 1988.  According to 
the Princeton Religion Research Center, 31% of suburban teens consider 
themselves evangelical, compared with 41%-43% in large cities, small 
towns, or rural areas.  Born-again teens are most numerous in the South 
(49%) and Midwest (38%), followed by the East (34%) and West (32%). 
...The current generation of teens esteems the Bible.  The study shows 
that only 14% of teens consider the Bible a book of fables or legends.  
But 84% said the Bible is "the Word of God," and 38% said it should be 
taken literally. 

May 20 was Judgment Day for doomsday preacher Lee Jang-rim, the South 
Korean pastor who predicted Oct. 28 as the end of the world (NIRR 
12/14/92).  Seoul Appellate Court upheld a lower court decision, but 
ordered Lee to serve only one year in prison rather than the two 
originally sentenced.  Prosecutors had sought a seven-year sentence.  
Lee was, however, ordered to pay a fine of $26,000.  News reports 
indicated that he was accused of swindling followers and members of his 
10,000-member Mission for the Coming Days/Dami Missionary Church out of 
approximately $1.3 million.  The preacher said he still believes in the 
Second Coming, but apologized for his incorrect prediction.  He 
insisted that all the funds he collected were voluntary donations, and 
is expected to appeal to the Supreme Court. 

"My children and I are devastated and deeply disappointed," said 
imprisoned televangelist Jim Bakker, who was denied an early parole 
(NIRR 1/11).  Although officials at the federal prison in Rochester, 
Minn., said good behavior had shaved three years off his eight-year 
sentence, Bakker is scheduled to remain in prison until October 1994.  
Bakker's attorney, James Toms, said two board examiners recommended 
early release, but the full parole board did not, a decision Toms will 
ask the U.S. Parole Commission to reconsider.  Bakker said, "Our faith 
remains in God, and with His help, we will be able to walk through this 
one more valley." 

Under the national health-care proposal, hospital chaplains may have to 
prove their efforts are worth their salaries, said Elizabeth McSherry, 
a Brockton, Mass., physician who directs a pilot program in management 
control systems for the Veterans Administration.  As hospital funds are 
redeployed, chaplains will have to compete with other professionals in 
the health-care marketplace.  "People representing a spiritual 
dimension of health" must state their cases convincingly or risk 
getting lost in the shuffle, she said.  McSherry, who has done 
extensive research on the influence of religion on health, told NIRR 
the best approach for chaplains is to document religion as a 
cost-effective specialty service that improves overall health.  
Individual chaplains can use patient questionnaires or interactive 
notebook computer assessments to quantify results. Research shows that 
chaplaincy programs do help to keep costs down.  McSherry said one 
Boston-area VA study of 300 open-heart surgery patients showed that 
those whom chaplains visited had a 20%-25% shorter stay in the 
hospital, thus saving $800 to $3,000 in costs per day.  In addition to 
giving last rites and other forms of pastoral care, hospital chaplains 
also resolve difficult ethical issues.  This helps reduce the risk of 
malpractice suits by angry patients and family members. Policy emphasis 
on disease prevention could include a national, regionalized network of 
church-based wellness centers. Churches are ideal sites, since they are 
trusted in the community, available for use at low cost, "already 
altruistically oriented," McSherry said, and could serve as locales for 
community screening, detection, and education.  Such centers already 
are successful in impoverished Southern areas. 
...While on the reservation, Native Americans' health-care options are 
limited.  But when they go to Denver for medical services, they receive 
spiritual and emotional support from the Chaplains Association for 
Native Americans. Established in 1988, CANA links Indian clergy and lay 
persons to patients and their families who desire ministry while 
receiving treatment in the Mile High City.  CANA also provides 
emergency housing, food, and transportation.  The group seeks to bridge 
the gap between the Indian and non-Indian community through continuing 
education programs, and inservice hospital staff and volunteer training 
on the culturally specific needs of Indians.  Each month CANA's 
volunteer staff puts in more than 260 hours, averaging 45 visits to 20 
patients.  Most volunteers are fellow Native Americans from the local 
metropolitan area.  CANA operates entirely on private church funding. 

The administration's proposed health-care package will likely include 
abortion.  The president and Hillary Clinton, Health Care Reform Task 
Force Chair, support elective abortion funding as part of the proposal 
to guarantee "access to quality affordable health care."  Since the 
plan will likely fold Medicaid into the new program, poor women's 
abortions would be funded.  The president told MTV News the plan will 
include services generally covered by private insurers, which often 
cover abortion.  If Congress removes the federal funding, "that will be 
a fight we'll have," he said. 
..."Abortion is not part of the healing arts," said Pennsylvania's 
pro-life Gov. Robert Casey, who also said any plan to include federal 
abortion funding would be "dead on arrival."  The Catholic Church, 
which serves more than 50 million Americans with health care through 
the country's largest network of non-profit hospitals and nursing 
homes, is especially concerned.  The church's health-care guidelines 
are similar to Clinton's proposals, but the U.S. Catholic Conference 
still wrote to Hillary Clinton.  The group said inclusion of abortion 
in the national plan would be "a moral tragedy, a serious policy 
misjudgment, and a major political mistake."  Almost all health-care 
experts have said the proposal will include clauses allowing those 
morally opposed to abortion to opt out of performing the procedure. 

Pennsylvania's abortion law is on hold.  U.S. District Judge Daniel 
Huyett III enjoined the enactment until a new trial determines the 
law's constitutionality.  Planned Parenthood of Southeastern 
Pennsylvania and five other providers claimed that the law placed an 
"undue burden" on women's abilities to receive abortions.  The test was 
established in last summer's U.S. Supreme Court Casey decision, which 
said the state could place restrictions on the procedure as long as it 
did not place such a burden.  The state's law requires a 24-hour 
waiting period before the procedure, parental or judicial permission 
for minors' abortions, and "informed consent" through mandatory 
description of fetal development.  State Attorney General Ernie Preate 
argues that the Supreme Court already determined the constitutionality 
of the law, and that the law should be enacted immediately.  News 
sources said no trial date has been set. 

The Justice Department told the Supreme Court that abortion clinics 
should be able to prosecute protesters under RICO, the Racketeer 
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (NIRR 1/25).  Government 
attorneys said a lower court erroneously barred medical facilities from 
filing lawsuits against Operation Rescue and other pro-life groups 
under the federal law.  The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago had 
concluded that RICO convictions required evidence of an economic 
motive.  But government attorneys said that a political group still 
might reap "incidental economic benefits," (like increased donations) 
even though it engaged in illegal acts for political reasons.  OR and 
other groups have been accused of extortion under RICO, because of 
arson, bombings, property destruction, assault and battery, 
trespassing, and harassment. When the circuit court threw out the case, 
it also threw out huge fines previously assessed against the groups. 
The National Organization for Women and other pro-choice supporters 
called opposition groups "a nationwide criminal conspiracy of 
extremists" with "unlawful and violent methods" to put clinics out of 
business.  OR's Pat Mahoney said the Clinton administration was 
"singling [pro-lifers] out for attack."  Justice Department attorneys, 
in their brief, urged the high court to hear the NOW appeal case. 

The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act got a boost from Attorney 
General Janet Reno, who asked Congress to pass legislation giving the 
federal government greater authority to stop clinic blockades (NIRR 
2/22).  Since local authorities are not well enough equipped to deal 
with a nationally organized movement, Reno said, a wider law is 
necessary. The FACE Act would make it a federal crime to use "force" or 
"physical obstruction" to injure, intimidate, or interfere with a woman 
or health-care professional, or to damage abortion facilities.  News 
reports indicated penalties would include fines and prison sentences up 
to 10 years in cases of bodily injury.  Maximum life terms could be 
sentenced if a death occurred, and the Justice Department could also 
file civil suits against protesters.  The Justice Department and 
President Clinton have said they favor the enactment of the bill. 
...The FACE bill has some problems, though, some of them partisan.  
Several senators, mostly Republican, sought clearer definition of 
"intimidation" and "physical obstacles."  Unlike some state statutes, 
the FACE Act does not prohibit similar protest activities by labor 
strikers, animal-rights activists, or environmentalists.  The American 
Family Association and other conservative groups argued that the bill 
fostered censorship of views deemed politically incorrect, an 
allegation Reno and FACE supporters denied.  The legislation prohibits 
certain conduct, but "makes clear that it is not intended to suppress a 
particular message," she said.  Operation Rescue disagreed, saying Reno 
was making a priority of "prosecuting peaceful people who hold a 
different opinion than the Clinton administration." 

The Freedom of Choice Act passed the House Judiciary Committee without 
restrictions that would weaken it, according to supporters (NIRR 3/8).  
Narrowly defeated were amendments that would have allowed states to 
impose constitutionally approved measures such as waiting periods, 
informed consent provisions, and parental notification laws. Many of 
the proposals may still be added to assure passage by the full House, 
generally less liberal than the committee. The most likely amendment 
will be a conscience clause to exempt individuals and private hospitals 
who oppose abortion on moral grounds.  Sources said other changes may 
allow states to refuse to fund poor women's abortions with public 
monies. The Senate version of FOCA was approved by the Labor and Human 
Resources Committee in March. 
...Anticipating the upcoming congressional battle over FOCA, pro-lifers 
launched a public education campaign. On the last weekend of April, the 
National Right to Life Committee held news conferences, and distributed 
3 million brochures in hundreds of communities in more than 30 states.  
Its "Stop FOCA Now" pamphlet detailed the extent to which the bill, if 
enacted, would invalidate statutes in 30 states that place limitations 
on third-trimester abortions.  It also described a controversial new 
procedure for second- and third-trimester abortions.  The leaflet urged 
readers to contact members of Congress and express their opposition to 
the proposed federal law. 

Since Easter, five Boston-area churches have found themselves in a 
sticky situation: their locks were glued shut.  The vandals left 
messages claiming that the Catholic church fosters hatred of women, and 
is to blame for the murder of David Gunn, a doctor at a Florida 
abortion clinic.  The Boston archdiocese said the acts may be designed 
as a threat.  Auxiliary Bishop Alfred Hughes said the incidents reveal 
the intolerance of some abortion-rights activists, trying to stifle 
"free speech, peaceful free assembly and religious practice in order to 
advance their program of destruction of the lives of the unborn." But 
abortion-rights groups said they, too, oppose vandalism, and that the 
incidents might be a provocation by abortion opponents.  "This is so 
silly, so immature . . . that I wonder if it isn't the work of a double 
agent," said Rosemary Trowbridge of Catholics for a Free Choice.  Ellen 
Convisser of the local chapter of the National Organization for Women 
said that if abortion-rights activists glued the locks, they confused 
Catholic parishioners with hierarchy.  "Parishioners have a very high 
population of pro-choice people," she said. 

Texas Gov. Ann Richards, a staunch proponent of abortion rights, was 
confronted by at least three dozen picketers in San Antonio where she 
was the keynote speaker at the graduation exercises of Incarnate Word 
High School, one of the area's largest Catholic high schools.  Pro-life 
Catholics, some of whom were parents of students at Incarnate Word, 
circulated a petition asking the school to invite someone else to 
speak.  They complained it was a contradiction for a Catholic school to 
invite a pro-choice politician (who also favors the repeal of Texas' 
sodomy laws) to speak at its commencement ceremony.  Louis Agnese, 
president of the college that runs the school, said the governor was 
invited as "chief executive officer of the state and an inspiration to 
young people," and that her appearance would promote free speech.  
Richards took the protest in stride, saying the demonstrators were 
showing the courage of their convictions. Although the graduation is 
over, the protesters have contacted the St. Joseph's Foundation, a 
local organization that specializes in handling canonical law 
questions, to determine the feasibility of taking the case to a church 
court. 

St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church will withhold support from its synod 
until it stops funding a gay advocacy group. The 4,500-member Newport 
Beach, Calif., church's session unanimously agreed it did not want to 
help finance the Lazarus Project (NIRR 3/9/92).  The project, which 
calls itself "a ministry of reconciliation empowering gay, lesbian, 
bisexual, and heterosexual Christians to love one another," is 
headquartered at West Hollywood Presbyterian Church.  St. Andrew's 
informed the PCUSA, the Synod of Southern California and Hawaii, and 
the Presbytery of Los Ranchos that it is holding in escrow all of its 
general mission support until all ties with Lazarus are severed.  If 
not, St. Andrew's plans to designate its funds to the presbytery's 
Mission On Our Doorstep program.  Also, a portion of the monies will be 
used to establish a national coalition of churches with similar 
opposition to PCUSA funding of homosexual advocacy projects.  "This is 
not a matter of human sexuality, but a matter of biblical authority," 
Senior Minister John Huffman told NIRR.  Although the church 
appreciates some of the work the Lazarus Project does, St. Andrew's 
cannot condone the project's "increasingly vocal and explicit advocacy 
of gay and lesbian lifestyles," nor the use of "missions funds to 
overthrow the definitive guidance of 1978."  St. Andrew's officials met 
in mid-May with the executive presbyter and a synod representative to 
discuss the congregation's position.  The church, which has the largest 
undesignated giving within its Synod, hopes to send a signal to the 
denomination, although it is not seeking to be schismatic, Huffman 
said.  The session has urged the General Assembly to define and 
maintain ordination standards compatible with scripture and the 
confessions.  A meeting after the PCUSA's summer convention will likely 
settle the issue. 
...The Lazarus Project is circulating Scared to Death, a 29-minute 
video on gay youth suicide.  "We are killing our children with 
bigotry," said LP Director Peg Beissert.  According to Beissert, about 
40% of all youth suicides are related to sexual orientation.  The $23 
tape includes lesbians and gays telling how they dealt with their 
adolescent suicidal thoughts, according to More Light Update, the 
newsletter of Presbyterians for Lesbian and Gay Concerns. 

A 3-2 Hawaii Supreme Court decision may lead the state to become the 
first to recognize homosexual marriages. Three gay and lesbian couples 
in Honolulu won an appeal alleging that the Department of Health's 
denials of their requests for marriage licenses were discriminatory on 
the basis of sex.  A lower court had ruled that no law supported their 
claim, and that a state statute prohibits same-sex marriages.  But the 
state's high court ruled that the state may not prohibit gays from 
marrying under the state constitution without a "compelling reason" to 
do so.  Since a 1967 precedent established marriage as a civil right, 
and equal protection under and enjoyment of the laws are guaranteed to 
all Hawaiians regardless of sex, the state may not discriminate against 
homosexuals wishing to wed.  Accordingly, the judges presumed the 
current prohibition to be "unconstitutional."  Dissenters focused on 
the state's clear interest in heterosexual marriages, as well as 
financial (tax benefits), industrial (health-care benefits), and 
political repercussions (some states might not recognize homosexual 
unions as legal) that were likely to follow.  News reports said 
morality, too, served as a point of argument in Baehr v. Lewin.  The 
case will return to trial court to allow the state to prove a 
"compelling" reason for maintaining the ban on homosexual marriages.  
The heavy burden of proof usually requires evidence that the public 
safety is endangered, and may prove difficult for government attorneys. 

Many U.S. religious leaders are supporting government action to slow 
the bloodshed in Bosnia.  Heads of 15 U.S. Protestant and Orthodox 
religious groups urged intervention in the Balkans.  Officials 
representing mainline denominations and the National Council of 
Churches, as well as leading conservative denominational leaders and 
the National Association of Evangelicals, backed the use of 
peacekeeping forces under U.N. command.  U.S. Catholic leaders urged 
that force be used to stop the "slaughter of the innocents."  They 
conceded the situation in the former Yugoslavia had no real political 
solution, but insisted that the world's indifference to the current 
suffering is "unacceptable."  In April, 13 Jewish groups, among them 
Reform Jews and the American Jewish Congress, encouraged U.S. 
intervention, including lifting the arms embargo and sending weapons to 
prevent another full-fledged "holocaust." 

Christians hold the key to preventing a re-occurrence of a holocaust, 
says Jewish businessman Ben Friedman.  His Los Angeles-based Committee 
of Concerned Christians is asking evangelical pastors to "agree to 
preach at least one sermon yearly" about the Germans' World War II 
massacre of 6 million Jews.  "We're in greater jeopardy than ever 
before that another holocaust will happen, and American Christians can 
prevent it from happening," Friedman told NIRR.  His recent poll of 
ministers showed 54% believed another holocaust against Jews could 
occur between the years 2000-2040. 

Is Louis Farrakhan, who once called Judaism a "gutter religion," 
offering an olive branch to the Jews?  The spiritual leader of the 
Nation of Islam says he is evolving.  He told reporters his recent 
concert series is intended as a reconciliatory measure.  Farrakhan 
plays a violin concerto by Felix Mendelssohn, whose forebears were 
Jewish, but converted to Christianity.  Although the Mendelssohn is his 
most polished piece, he acknowledged the symbolism.  He says he hopes 
the music can undo past discord and lead to understanding in a way that 
words could not. 

Some evangelical college students will spend a semester in the Middle 
East with the Christian College Coalition, a Washington-based 
association of 85 colleges.  The Middle East program begins in 
September with 13 weeks of study in Cairo, followed by two weeks of 
travel in Israel.  CCC Program Director Clifford Gardner of the 
American University in Cairo wants students to gain a "greater 
appreciation of the diversity of the Middle East, a clear understanding 
of Islam, a new perspective on Eastern churches, a greater 
understanding of the role of the United States in the Middle East, and 
a sense of how Christians should relate to Muslim countries and 
individuals." 
...Other CCC students will weather the winter semester in Russia.  
After a two-week orientation in Moscow, the students will live for 10 
weeks in Nizhni Novgorod, formerly known as Gorky.  They will study 
Russian language, history, culture, economics, politics, and religion.  
A three-week stay in St. Petersburg will allow students to live with 
Russian Christian families and work in service projects. 

St. James Bible College is one of the first evangelical Bible schools 
established in the former Soviet Union.  Founded in 1991, the college 
is located in Korosten, three hours northwest of Kiev and 60 miles from 
Chernobyl.  St. James is sponsored by James Robison's LIFE Outreach 
International in Fort Worth, Texas; pastor Don Sheley's Church of the 
Highlands in San Bruno, Calif.; and pastor Harley Allen's Calvary 
Temple in Concord, Calif.  Faculty members include Christian college 
professors and American pastors.  St. James is authorized to grant 
degrees by the Ukraine's Department of Education, and 145 students will 
complete their first semester in July.  Other schools are being 
developed in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Minsk. 

Popular author and radio pastor Charles "Chuck" Swindoll will be the 
next president of Dallas Theological Seminary, effective July 1, 1994.  
The seminary's board also appointed as its hands-on provost John 
Sailhamer, professor of Old Testament at Trinity Evangelical Divinity 
School.  Swindoll will continue his radio ministry, as well as his 
service as senior pastor of First Evangelical Free Church in Fullerton, 
Calif.  Both men are graduates of the seminary. 

Flanked by the banners of seven faiths, San Antonio's religious, ethnic 
and civic leaders opened the Alamodome with a May 23 multi-cultural 
interfaith dedication service.  The nation's newest sports/convention 
facility can seat up to 72,000 in its 160,000 square-feet, and sports 
two ice rinks, 14 conference rooms, and a price tag of $186 million.  
Baha'is, Muslims, Jews, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, and Hindus joined 
a 600-member youth choir in the celebration culminating a week of 
opening ceremonies.  Councilman Bill Thornton said ending the 
festivities with a religious service was appropriate, since the city's 
need for convention space was dramatically illustrated by a religious 
group.  In the late 1980s, 20,000 Lutheran youth were forced to hold 
their convention outdoors because the city had no facility large enough 
to seat them. Claude Black, pastor of Mount Zion First Baptist Church, 
agreed: "There is no more appropriate way to celebrate this leap 
forward . . . than by praising the One Power that has guided our city's 
development." 
...Evangelistic ministries are strategizing to score with fans at 
upcoming sports events.  Most fall under the Sports Outreach America 
umbrella (NIRR 1/25).  The group's annual convention in Atlanta drew 
more than 300 denominational and parachurch ministry leaders to discuss 
the city's two major sports events of the decade: the 1994 World Cup 
Soccer matches and the 1996 Olympics.  Workshops also covered 
outreaches to professional athletes, women's and Christian college 
sports, and legal aspects of having Christian athletes take the gospel 
into public schools. 
..."Like it or not, our heroes today are usually sports figures," said 
Larry Backlund, executive director of School of Evangelism for the 
Billy Graham Association.  Since the sports arena is a prime area for 
evangelism, there is a strong chance that Billy Graham will team up 
with others to provide resources, training, and rallies in some of the 
nine World Cup cities, Backlund told NIRR.  "We believe sports are a 
powerful tool for evangelism since athletes are so visible." 
...Dave Dravecky, the former San Francisco Giants pitcher, will have a 
new home plate: Colorado Springs.  In August the Dave Dravecky 
Foundation will move its Ohio ministry office west to place the 
ministry more centrally and to signal a new approach.  "We intend to be 
more proactive in our efforts to minister to cancer patients and their 
families, as well as continue to answer the thousands of letters from 
supporters and children," he said.  Dravecky retired from Major League 
baseball in 1989 after a cancerous tumor was found in the primary 
throwing muscle of his left arm.  Two years later, after a brief 
comeback and unsuccessful treatments, his left arm and shoulder were 
amputated. Dravecky and his wife, Jan, also plan to develop a new 
ministry to professional baseball players and their families, and will 
produce a newsletter, sent free to anyone who requests it: 13840 
Gleneagle Dr., Colorado Springs, CO 80921. 

Who's winning the culture war: the journalists or the religionists?  A 
recent study by the Vanderbilt University Freedom Forum's First 
Amendment Center showed that most ministers and priests believed "the 
news media have a greater influence on the way people think and act 
than religion does."  But a majority of journalists took the opposite 
view.  The newspaper religion writers and editors the center polled 
said religion was the stronger of the two. 
...Religion and journalism came first at the Evangelical Press 
Association's annual convention in Minneapolis. "Reaching Our Changing 
World" was the goal of the 300 individuals representing 133 Christian 
publications at the mid-May gathering.  In addition to addresses on 
typical publication concerns (editing, writing, graphics, social 
issues, management), participants celebrated William Carey's 
200-year-old missions movement.  Speakers, including Evangelical Free 
Church in America President Paul Cedar, missions expert Ruth Tucker, 
author Jill Briscoe, and Washington Post religion writer Gustav 
Niebuhr, discussed the role of the Christian press and church 
throughout the world. 
...Cedar called on Christian journalists to make every effort to reach 
the secular press through personal contacts. He said his main appeal to 
the Christian community would be to make sacrifices and to be true 
disciples.  "It's time for America to know," Cedar said, "that 
Christians are not all critical or angry or insensitive."  He also said 
not enough Christians write for non-Christians.  "It's time to model 
the real Jesus in a language everyone can understand."  His 
denomination is attempting to do that with its new magazine, Pursuit, 
which is targeted to reach non-Christians.  The EFCA also is developing 
90-second evangelistic spots for the unbelievers who comprise 5%-15% of 
Christian radio audiences. But, Cedar told NIRR, "Evangelism is the 
work of the Holy Spirit, not human effort.  If it is not motivated by 
prayer, it is empty." 
...Trinity Evangelical Divinity School professor Ruth Tucker admonished 
editors not to avoid controversial issues in their publications.  They 
should also intentionally include women, people of color, and 
non-Western individuals. Although many in the Christian world "fear the 
feminist movement," it has lowered opposition to women in ministry, 
Tucker said.  And "if any area in the church needs women's input, it is 
in cross-cultural missions."  She noted a new fervency in Christian 
leadership from other cultures, and said if the trend continued "by the 
end of the century non-western missionaries will outnumber western 
ones."  These signs "of reform and renewal" teach the church "that once 
things get too old, change needs to occur."  But problems persist, 
Tucker said.  Racism, like sexism, is more pronounced than ever because 
of "a backlash to the progress that has been made."  In addition, 
"segments of the population are at war with each other.  Journalists 
help fan the flames of these culture wars." 
...Another battlefield discussed was the homosexual-rights agenda.  
Attorney Roger Magnuson, author of Multnomah's Are Gay Rights Right?, 
believes the movement is a fight over words.  "Our job, then, is to be 
agents of light who illumine the issues, expose the consequences of 
homosexuality, and encourage others to stand firm in truth." 
...Leith Anderson said such challenges are inevitable for Christian 
leaders,  who "have come to a fork in the road." The knowledge 
explosion, urbanization, democratization, immigration, and 
fundamentalism are major social trends influencing the church.  The 
author of A Church for the 21st Century said this restructuring of the 
church is evident in six ways: (1) the increased influence and 
visibility of the megachurch; (2) generational and gender changes in 
leadership, from men in their 50s to younger men and women in their 30s 
and 40s; (3) the widening role of the laity in the church; (4) greater 
polarization along age, gender, and racial lines; (5) growing 
segmentation of society; and (6) agents of change within the church 
community.  He said people are "looking for help to adjust to this 
tidal wave of change." 

How can the church best adjust to the changes and megatrends to come?  
"Pastors today seem driven to do something about the culture," 
pastor-author Eugene Peterson observes.  "Perhaps the best thing they 
could do is withdraw from it and develop a holy community.  We're not 
going to make a difference if we keep measuring results by weekly 
statistics.  The only kind of work that makes any difference in the 
world is gospel work conceived in prayer and filled with the Holy 
Spirit. And if we're not willing to participate in that, our efforts 
are wasted." 
..."The number one trend in the world that will effect the church is 
nationalism," says Robert Williams, director of BGEA's Mission World.  
"Missionaries will have to be culturally sensitive and invest in 
nationals.  Our recent victory in Germany came . . . because of the 
local pastors there who worked together.  The second trend I see is a 
jealousy of each other.  Finally, I believe persecution will come for 
the church.  But the seed of the church is the blood of martyrs." 
...Author-pastor Ken Engstrom believes, "The Lord is calling us to 
manifest the heart of God for the lost, and that means we take a stance 
of proclamation more than protest.  That doesn't mean we sacrifice our 
convictions or surrender to moral cowardice.  But as much as I may 
internally protest the values of the culture, I don't perceive my call 
as one to protest the culture, but to proclaim my Savior." 
...EFCA President Paul Cedar thinks "we are naive if we think political 
involvement alone will solve the problems of education or health care 
or housing.  The problem is with the American church, not the American 
public.  The solution to these is a deep spiritual awakening.  Such an 
awakening -- coming from joint agendas to evangelize the United States 
and to revitalize the church -- would have tremendous sociological 
implications.  I am seeing a major trend in the church: a sort of mass 
cooperation.  There's just not as much competition anymore.  True, 
there is societal decay and decline.  But what our nation needs, only 
the church can provide.  And what the church needs, only God can 
provide." 

On Ministry: 

On Trends: 

Backland, "I believe a dividing is taking place in our country where 
the good are getting better and the bad are getting worse.  There are 
rapid changes from Judeo-Christian values.  I'm not sure we're in a 
post-Christian society yet but we're getting there.  I hope it doesn't 
happen but I wouldn't be surprised if the Schools of Evangelism became 
illegal." 

Pannell, "Everywhere one looks, modern evangelicalism is becoming 
increasingly elitist.  This is evident at evangelical colleges, at 
conferences, at publishing houses, at all the institutions responsible 
for creating a sense of rightness in the movement.  Key leaders at some 
of our evangelical college and seminary campuses have expressed a 
growing concern that Christian higher education is forever out of reach 
to lower-class young people, regardless of ethnic background.  This 
elitism is innocent, to be sure.  A cities take on a more non-Western 
ambiance, replete with substantial unemployment and political 
disenfranchisement, urban ad suburban churches will be further 
distanced from one another along faultlines of ideology and praxis." 

On Leadership: Backland, "Pastors and leaders are hungry for practical 
hands-on knowledge.  Seminaries provide theory; Schools of evangelism 
try to provide the practical means to apply it.  Many pastors feel 
alone, isolated, and have no place for encouragement." 

Pannell, " Control was clearly the issue in Manila as the changing of 
the guard among the Lausanne Committee (USA) was being paraded in front 
of the Americans assembled. 

The new leaders were, unsurprisingly, all white males. 

It is hard for many black evangelicals to believe that a leadership so 
uniformly lily-white can signal a 'trend toward rejuvenation' the 
movement claims.  Americans can get away with such talk when they go to 
Europe.  But it sounds like idle talk in their own backyard. idle talk 
in their own backyard."
