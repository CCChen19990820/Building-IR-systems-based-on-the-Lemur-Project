<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>International Outreach (IO) was founded by Stuart Gramenz of Australia to reach India with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Stuart was involved in holding large evangelistic crusades, "Jesus Heals Campaigns", to achieve this. The immediate results were very encouraging, with thousands upon thousands responding to the Gospel, but this gave rise to a new challenge - FOLLOW UP, the answer being to train the nationals to reach their nation. Stuart met P. D. Prasada Rao at a crusade in Hyderabad and discovered they both had a vision to train the nationals of India. This resulted in the establishment of the Ministry Training College in 1983.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://village.ios.com/~jtatum1/ismind.html">International Student Ministry:Foreign Missions in Reverse</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:jtatum1@village.ios.com">jtatum1@village.ios.com</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>God's Love In Action (Sammy Tippit Ministries) is emerging at the close of the 20th century as one of the world's leading international revival and evangelistic ministries. God's Love In Action is committed to bringing the message of revival to the church and the gospel to the world utilizing four strategies: God's Love In Action conducts mass evangelistic meetings around the world. Sammy Tippit has preached on every continent and has seen thousands respond publicly to repent and follow Christ. Sammy has mobilized the Christian community in Prayer and Spiritual Awakening conferences around the world. He then mobilizes the Christian community in the ministry of mass evangelism. This has been so effective in Brazil that the Brazilian Baptist Convention has asked God's Love In Action to go to every state capital in Brazil with spiritual awakening conferences and evangelistic crusades by the year 2000. God's Love In Action is committed to the follow-up of new believers. Counselors are trained and classes scheduled for those who come to Christ. In many cities where Sammy has completed crusades, new churches have sprung up as a result of the meetings. Bible college students have stayed for one year following Siberian crusades where previously there was only a handful of believers. Sammy has pioneered evangelistic crusades in Romania, Mongolia, and several un-reached cities in Siberia. He conducted the first ever organized evangelistic outdoor crusades in Romania and Mongolia. He has preached the first ever stadium crusades in over 20 cities in Eastern Europe and Asia.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://www.joshhunt.com/Stand-GQ.html">Good Question Sunday School Lessons Get Groups Talking</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:vision@greatwhite.com">vision@greatwhite.com</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>A full reading of The Pattern &amp; The Prophecy will provide many wonders and delights. Here are a few. Discover the blueprint underlying God's Holy Word: Why 888 is Jesus' number in the Holy Scriptures. Why 666 is the number of the Beast. Why 153 fish were caught in the Gospels' last scene. The lost science of gematria. The origins of the fear of the number 13. The hidden symbolism of the world's most famous name, Jesus Christ. Why the Holy of Holies, from the Tabernacle to the City of Revelation, was always a perfect cube. How and where the Trinity and the name Jesus are found in Genesis 1:1 and Revelation 22:21 -- the Bible's first and last verses. Throughout The Pattern &amp; The Prophecy there are many photographs, abundant illustrations, frequent references, numerous exact proofs, and three detailed indexes. This book will enrich the spiritual life of every Christian and forever change the life of every non-Christian.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://www.netten.net/PeopleSharingJesusMinistries/">People Sharing Jesus Ministries</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:JTAYLOR@cc.memphis.edu">JTAYLOR@cc.memphis.edu</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>Joy International is a non-profit organization headquartered in the U.S, dedicated to meeting the needs of children internationally. Working together with caring individuals from all over the world, Joy International sponsors children's homes, special events, books, seminars, and assists in adoptions. In 1980 when Jeff Brodsky first visited India his heart was touched by what he saw and experienced as Snuggles The Love Clown. As a result of these experiences, Jeff founded Joy International in 1981 to meet the needs of suffering children. Since that time, 3 homes have been established in India, supported by Joy International: one in Hyderabad with 75 children, one in Polavarum with 32 children, and a third for 14 children of lepers at a colony in Narsapur. All the people living in the colony were beggars including the children. Jeff saw the only way to escape this life style was through education. As a result, Joy International now helps with the education of the children. At Joy International it is our goal to help children become productive members of their society and community as they mature into adulthood. We accomplish this through education. Unfortunately in India there is no free public education. Joy International helps pay for the education of every child no matter what their caste or social staus. For children living in the streets on their own abandoned by their parents there is no hope without organizations like Joy International. We take the children off the streets and place them in our homes, meeting all of their needs: food, shelter, clothing, nurturing, professional medical care, and education. We attend to their physical and social development by providing a real home, opportunity to learn and participate in sports, church and social communities. Since that time Joy Internationals work has expanded to Fiji, China, and now to Venezuela. In addition to its other services Joy International now provides opportunities for education, job training and parenting skills to unwed mothers and challenged parents of teenagers.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://members.aol.com/ladenwaitn/index.html">Ladies In Waiting</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:LadeNWaitN@aol.com">LadeNWaitN@aol.com</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>The fundamental principles which underlie any course of study are called simply "the basics." The basics are the ABC's, the nuts and bolts. They are the essentials, the things we must master before we can become proficient in any particular field. But the basics are also the things to which we must return when we lose our bearings. They are the bedrock, apart from which we have no hope of standing. As new believers, we learn the basic principles: the love of God, the destructiveness of sin, salvation by faith, the authority of the Word, the sufficiency of grace. We begin to practice the basic exercises: confession, prayer, study, service. As we mature, we come to realize that proficiency, skill in living the Christian Life, is not a matter of moving beyond the basics, but is a matter of delving more deeply into them.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://www.ctaz.net/~prophecy/index.htm">Beginner's Prophecy</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:rnpilot@hawaiian.net">rnpilot@hawaiian.net</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>God's Love In Action (Sammy Tippit Ministries) is emerging at the close of the 20th century as one of the world's leading international revival and evangelistic ministries. God's Love In Action is committed to bringing the message of revival to the church and the gospel to the world utilizing four strategies: God's Love In Action conducts mass evangelistic meetings around the world. Sammy Tippit has preached on every continent and has seen thousands respond publicly to repent and follow Christ. Sammy has mobilized the Christian community in Prayer and Spiritual Awakening conferences around the world. He then mobilizes the Christian community in the ministry of mass evangelism. This has been so effective in Brazil that the Brazilian Baptist Convention has asked God's Love In Action to go to every state capital in Brazil with spiritual awakening conferences and evangelistic crusades by the year 2000. God's Love In Action is committed to the follow-up of new believers. Counselors are trained and classes scheduled for those who come to Christ. In many cities where Sammy has completed crusades, new churches have sprung up as a result of the meetings. Bible college students have stayed for one year following Siberian crusades where previously there was only a handful of believers. Sammy has pioneered evangelistic crusades in Romania, Mongolia, and several un-reached cities in Siberia. He conducted the first ever organized evangelistic outdoor crusades in Romania and Mongolia. He has preached the first ever stadium crusades in over 20 cities in Eastern Europe and Asia.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://www.grcbooks.com/grcbooks">Golden Rule Christian Books</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:grcbooks@primenet.com">grcbooks@primenet.com</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

The immediate results were very encouraging, with thousands upon thousands responding to the Gospel, but this gave rise to a new challenge - FOLLOW UP, the answer being to train the nationals to reach their nation. Stuart met P. D. Prasada Rao at a crusade in Hyderabad and discovered they both had a vision to train the nationals of India.

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>God's Love In Action (Sammy Tippit Ministries) is emerging at the close of the 20th century as one of the world's leading international revival and evangelistic ministries. God's Love In Action is committed to bringing the message of revival to the church and the gospel to the world utilizing four strategies: God's Love In Action conducts mass evangelistic meetings around the world. Sammy Tippit has preached on every continent and has seen thousands respond publicly to repent and follow Christ. Sammy has mobilized the Christian community in Prayer and Spiritual Awakening conferences around the world. He then mobilizes the Christian community in the ministry of mass evangelism. This has been so effective in Brazil that the Brazilian Baptist Convention has asked God's Love In Action to go to every state capital in Brazil with spiritual awakening conferences and evangelistic crusades by the year 2000. God's Love In Action is committed to the follow-up of new believers. Counselors are trained and classes scheduled for those who come to Christ. In many cities where Sammy has completed crusades, new churches have sprung up as a result of the meetings. Bible college students have stayed for one year following Siberian crusades where previously there was only a handful of believers. Sammy has pioneered evangelistic crusades in Romania, Mongolia, and several un-reached cities in Siberia. He conducted the first ever organized evangelistic outdoor crusades in Romania and Mongolia. He has preached the first ever stadium crusades in over 20 cities in Eastern Europe and Asia.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://www.primenet.com/~juliusa/">Gospel Distribution Ministry</A></B> <BR>

Priority is given to the following workers: 1. Those who must raise their own support. 2. Those working with unreached and least evangelized peoples. White Harvest Fund (WHF) is built by donations from businesses, churches, foundations, and individuals committed to the completion of the Great Commission of Jesus Christ. WHF does not employ or supervise missionaries.

It is a lot of work -- as you know -- so I am seeking the Lord for His will in how to do it as well as what fruit comes from it. In the BELIEVER, I speak to Christians through the articles and also hope to interest others who might "surf" by. For that reason, I have also put a clear salvation "special message" as one of the sections. (For your information, I am also an ordained minister and have been involved in pastoring.

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>The fundamental principles which underlie any course of study are called simply "the basics." The basics are the ABC's, the nuts and bolts. They are the essentials, the things we must master before we can become proficient in any particular field. But the basics are also the things to which we must return when we lose our bearings. They are the bedrock, apart from which we have no hope of standing. As new believers, we learn the basic principles: the love of God, the destructiveness of sin, salvation by faith, the authority of the Word, the sufficiency of grace. We begin to practice the basic exercises: confession, prayer, study, service. As we mature, we come to realize that proficiency, skill in living the Christian Life, is not a matter of moving beyond the basics, but is a matter of delving more deeply into them.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://diogenes.baylor.edu/WWWproviders/Mission_Forum/welcome.html">Baylor University Mission Forum</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:britt_towery@baylor.edu">britt_towery@baylor.edu</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

Love, indeed, means loving people enough to tell them the truth and to warn them of those who in the name of love pervert the truth. Accordingly, our compassion is mainly directed to the uninformed multitudes and young Christians who need to be protected from deceivers and dangerous leaders.

NEW JERUSALEM Christian hard rock band and music ministry. Focused on fulfilling The Great Commission - Matthew 28:18-20. Teens and adults enjoy this unit, as the Led Zeppelin sound is similar to current alternative grunge music and many parents grew up in the '70's listening to it. Due to the group's rock-n-roll ambience and evangelical focus, many non-Christians interested in New Jerusalem. Loud band, though - make sure rock is what you want - rock for the Rock of Ages! Excellent band, powerful performance and ministry focused. Currently has one CD and one cassette EP available. Touring the USA soon.

And now at age 18, she is winning audiences across the nation, with her sincerity, boldness, and a message for teens of today. This Australian Forefront recording artist truly sings from the heart.

Mallonee writes songs with historical references, complex characters, and themes of faith and desperation that span all of VOL's music.

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>In addition to a great music and teaching line-up, there will again be many special features that are unique to a Creation festival. A highlight of the festival for many people is the Friday night candle lighting service. Picture a hillside shimmering with the light of 50,000 candles as voices unite in worship and praise. Another moving time of worship is on Saturday night when hundreds of people carrying beautiful praise banners surround the crowd as everyone joins in praising the Lord through song. Since 1979, the Creation Festival has grown to become the largest event of it's type in the world. This growth has beeen not just in the attendance of Creation, but also in the quality of the entire production. The most important changes by far are those that happen in our lives each year at Creation. No matter how bad things are going at home, the time spent at Creation brings spiritual refreshment and insight.</FONT><P><LI><IMG SRC="/gifs/new.gif" ALT="[NEW]" HEIGHT=12 WIDTH=31> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://www.clearlight.com/~cross">Cross Rhythms Music</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:g-card@ix.netcom.com">g-card@ix.netcom.com</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

A highlight of the festival for many people is the Friday night candle lighting service. Picture a hillside shimmering with the light of 50,000 candles as voices unite in worship and praise. Another moving time of worship is on Saturday night when hundreds of people carrying beautiful praise banners surround the crowd as everyone joins in praising the Lord through song.

This growth has beeen not just in the attendance of Creation, but also in the quality of the entire production.

MISSION: Our mission is to significantly advance the ministry of sharing the Good News among youth, churched and unchurched, employing all appropriate settings, means, and media. OBJECTIVES: In pursuit of this mission and ministry, we at Saint Mary's Press strive to accomplish the following objectives: To create materials and services that engage the audiences' hearts as well as their minds, and that affirm personal spirituality while encouraging active involvement in the life of the church. To produce timely, effective, attractive, and durable materials that are economical and environmentally friendly. To market our materials and services as widely as possible, and to sell our materials and services at fair prices that allow us to continue to pursue our mission. To foster the personal well-being and professional growth of our employees.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://www.airsworld.com/lib/therese">Sainte Therese de Lisieux</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:flespes@altern.com">flespes@altern.com</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>The names Whitewell and James McConnell are now synonymous. Whitewell tells of the Pastor and the place where thousands of souls have been won for the Lord Jesus Christ, during 40 years of unbroken service. It has been a house of light in every sense, a truly exciting testimony of God's power at work amidst the violence, bloodshed and suffering of Northern Ireland. It is hard to comprehend, that this little acorn which began in 1957 in Whitewell Orange Hall with just 8 members, would eventually multiply 30, 60 and one hundred fold into a towering oak tree of almost 3,000 converts. Yet the facts are Whitewell has managed to establish 9 Sunday Schools across the province, 10 churches at home and abroad and is responsible for "Bus Outreach", a scheme which sends transport to 26 different locations around the countryside every Monday, Wednesday and Sunday. Add to this its cassette tape ministry, a literature department, a recreation centre which is open six days a week, a choir and orchestra, a senior citizens group, tract distribution, Girls' Brigade and Boy Scouts, its full-time staff and foreign missionaries and you have a veritable beehive of Holy activity. Incidents such as hearing from God, prayer, the prophetic word and growth to the largest full Gospel Church in the British Isles are all reasons why this ecclesiastical centre of worship is truly the work of the Lord. Such has been the incredible growth of the assembly ten churches at home and abroad have been erected since April 1969 and in each case the building of these houses has been a living testimony that God is at work in The Whitewell Metropolitan Tabernacle.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://www.wr.org/">World Relief Corporation</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:WorldRelief@xc.org">WorldRelief@xc.org</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

It means: Witnessing, Helping, Evangelizing, Encouraging, Loving, as we Pedal Our Way to Eternal Rewards. OBJECTIVES: To challenge people of all ages and walks of life to claim victory through Jesus Christ. To provide Christian bicyclists with opportunities for spiritual, physical, and social growth by uniting them through local adult WHEEL POWER clubs, one-day rides, regional tours, and annual Missions Trips Across America. To organize Bike &amp; Bible clubs for youth where they can hear the Gospel while also learning bicycle safety and good riding techniques and skills. MISSIONS TRIPS Each summer a team of WHEEL POWER Christian cyclists pedal across the United states on a short-term mission. Their goal is to share the Gospel with people they meet on their journey as well as with local people in the towns where they stop. In the evenings the team stays in churches, sharing their testimonies with the church members to encourage and challenge them. They reach out in the community, working though the local church to reach the unsaved through the distribution of a tract "Can We Pedal Our Way to Heaven?" WHEEL POWER Christian Cyclists use cycling as a means to bring people together to hear the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>Chi Alpha is a discussion and study group. We believe the Bible to be the revealed Word of God, and it is our basis. Chi Alpha is sponsored by the Assemblies of God but is open to all denominations and faiths. Everyone is welcome to attend our weekly meetings, which are held Tuesday nights at 9 PM in Olmsted Center. Chi Alpha provides a place for worship. As Christians, we believe that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners like us because of His boundless compassion and love. Our relationship with Him fills a void in our lives. We worship the God who created us and provided a way to complete fulfillment. Chi Alpha provides a place for fellowship. Our fast-paced world allows little time for friendship. We know everyone needs a friend. Through our Bible studies, activities, and social gatherings, Chi Alpha provides opportunities to make real friends who really care about you.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://primenet.com/~helmke/xa">Chi Alpha of NAU's home page.</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:helmke@primenet.com">helmke@primenet.com</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

Accordingly, we seek a comprehensive Christian world view based on the biblical record (revelation) that Jesus Christ is Lord, thereby assisting Christian students, faculty, and anyone else who would wisely meet the challenges of our pluralistic culture. Diverse? Really Diverse? Yes, Logos House is a cooperative ministry started by member of several local churches, with the blessing of several other well-established campus ministries.

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>Joy International is a non-profit organization headquartered in the U.S, dedicated to meeting the needs of children internationally. Working together with caring individuals from all over the world, Joy International sponsors children's homes, special events, books, seminars, and assists in adoptions. In 1980 when Jeff Brodsky first visited India his heart was touched by what he saw and experienced as Snuggles The Love Clown. As a result of these experiences, Jeff founded Joy International in 1981 to meet the needs of suffering children. Since that time, 3 homes have been established in India, supported by Joy International: one in Hyderabad with 75 children, one in Polavarum with 32 children, and a third for 14 children of lepers at a colony in Narsapur. All the people living in the colony were beggars including the children. Jeff saw the only way to escape this life style was through education. As a result, Joy International now helps with the education of the children. At Joy International it is our goal to help children become productive members of their society and community as they mature into adulthood. We accomplish this through education. Unfortunately in India there is no free public education. Joy International helps pay for the education of every child no matter what their caste or social staus. For children living in the streets on their own abandoned by their parents there is no hope without organizations like Joy International. We take the children off the streets and place them in our homes, meeting all of their needs: food, shelter, clothing, nurturing, professional medical care, and education. We attend to their physical and social development by providing a real home, opportunity to learn and participate in sports, church and social communities. Since that time Joy Internationals work has expanded to Fiji, China, and now to Venezuela. In addition to its other services Joy International now provides opportunities for education, job training and parenting skills to unwed mothers and challenged parents of teenagers.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://www.familyville.com/world/jesus/kidztown/">Kidztown</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:kbrower@mlc.awinc.com">kbrower@mlc.awinc.com</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

To organize Bike &amp; Bible clubs for youth where they can hear the Gospel while also learning bicycle safety and good riding techniques and skills. MISSIONS TRIPS Each summer a team of WHEEL POWER Christian cyclists pedal across the United states on a short-term mission. Their goal is to share the Gospel with people they meet on their journey as well as with local people in the towns where they stop. In the evenings the team stays in churches, sharing their testimonies with the church members to encourage and challenge them. They reach out in the community, working though the local church to reach the unsaved through the distribution of a tract "Can We Pedal Our Way to Heaven?" WHEEL POWER Christian Cyclists use cycling as a means to bring people together to hear the Gospel of Jesus Christ. WHEEL POWER CLUBS: The clubs (called Hubs) are designed for:</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://www.infinet.com/~barbm">Wisdom from the Word</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:barbm@infinet.com">barbm@infinet.com</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

This is to bring a state certified Bible course (elective) into the public high schools of the United States. There is already a precedent for this as this course is being taught in eight cities in North Carolina and numerous other cities across the country. The curriculum for the program shows a concern to convey the content of the Bible as compared to literature and history. The program is primarily concerned with education rather than indoctrination of students. The central approach of the class is simply to study the Bible as a foundation document of society, and that approach is altogether appropriate in a comprehensive program of secular education.</FONT><P><LI><IMG SRC="/gifs/new.gif" ALT="[NEW]" HEIGHT=12 WIDTH=31> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://www.mv.com/ipusers/lionmedia">New Hampshire Commentary</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:deand@lionmedia.mv.com">deand@lionmedia.mv.com</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>God's Love In Action (Sammy Tippit Ministries) is emerging at the close of the 20th century as one of the world's leading international revival and evangelistic ministries. God's Love In Action is committed to bringing the message of revival to the church and the gospel to the world utilizing four strategies: God's Love In Action conducts mass evangelistic meetings around the world. Sammy Tippit has preached on every continent and has seen thousands respond publicly to repent and follow Christ. Sammy has mobilized the Christian community in Prayer and Spiritual Awakening conferences around the world. He then mobilizes the Christian community in the ministry of mass evangelism. This has been so effective in Brazil that the Brazilian Baptist Convention has asked God's Love In Action to go to every state capital in Brazil with spiritual awakening conferences and evangelistic crusades by the year 2000. God's Love In Action is committed to the follow-up of new believers. Counselors are trained and classes scheduled for those who come to Christ. In many cities where Sammy has completed crusades, new churches have sprung up as a result of the meetings. Bible college students have stayed for one year following Siberian crusades where previously there was only a handful of believers. Sammy has pioneered evangelistic crusades in Romania, Mongolia, and several un-reached cities in Siberia. He conducted the first ever organized evangelistic outdoor crusades in Romania and Mongolia. He has preached the first ever stadium crusades in over 20 cities in Eastern Europe and Asia.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://web2.airmail.net/godswork">God@Work.Net Church Growth Headquarters</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:godswork@airmail.net">godswork@airmail.net</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

Currently active in Mozambique and South Africa we maintain an extensive database of Christians from all walks of life who want to be involved in missions. Some are businessmen who offer vehicles, food, goods or equipment at cost to missionaries others are housewives sending clothes and food to war orphans in Mozambique and some are ordinary people offering their homes as an overnight stop for missionaries on the road. Some offer the use of aircraft or vehicles and radio equipment and other communication networks. We work closely with many organisations in the region to try and connect the needs that exist to the Christians that can meet those needs.

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>CHRISTIAN BICYCLING IN AMERICA with WHEEL POWER Christian Cyclists GOAL STATEMENT: WHEEL POWER is an acronym and explains our goal best. It means: Witnessing, Helping, Evangelizing, Encouraging, Loving, as we Pedal Our Way to Eternal Rewards. OBJECTIVES: To challenge people of all ages and walks of life to claim victory through Jesus Christ. To provide Christian bicyclists with opportunities for spiritual, physical, and social growth by uniting them through local adult WHEEL POWER clubs, one-day rides, regional tours, and annual Missions Trips Across America. To organize Bike &amp; Bible clubs for youth where they can hear the Gospel while also learning bicycle safety and good riding techniques and skills. MISSIONS TRIPS Each summer a team of WHEEL POWER Christian cyclists pedal across the United states on a short-term mission. Their goal is to share the Gospel with people they meet on their journey as well as with local people in the towns where they stop. In the evenings the team stays in churches, sharing their testimonies with the church members to encourage and challenge them. They reach out in the community, working though the local church to reach the unsaved through the distribution of a tract "Can We Pedal Our Way to Heaven?" WHEEL POWER Christian Cyclists use cycling as a means to bring people together to hear the Gospel of Jesus Christ. WHEEL POWER CLUBS: The clubs (called Hubs) are designed for:</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://www.walkthru.com/">Walk Thru The Bible</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:75230.3107@compuserve.com">75230.3107@compuserve.com</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

In addition, tens of thousands more people from scores of nations are involved on a short-term basis each year. Coming from many different backgrounds and working in a wide range of situations, YWAMers are united in their desire to be part of changing people\'s lives for the better. They have responded to "The Great Commission" --Jesus\' command to His disciples to go into all the world and tell the "good news." They believe the gospel of Jesus is not just about words, but also actions. So they share their faith through many different kinds of practical help--from agricultural training to running medical clinics--as well as telling about the Christian beliefs that inspire their actions.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://atlanta.jubilee.co.uk/">YWAM Games Outreach : Atlanta 1996</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:reception@jubilee.co.uk">reception@jubilee.co.uk</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

We minister to those who are on the front lines of a spiritual battle. These Christians frequently pay a price, sometimes costing them their lives, landing them in prison, and causing much hardship.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://www.intournet.co.il/icej/">International Christian Embassy Jerusalem</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:yaakov@intournet.co.il">yaakov@intournet.co.il</A></CODE>)</I><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>Monthly newsletter and on-line resources which help to expose deception in Christian denominations. As we "contend for the faith," we should ever strive to do so without being meanspirited or unkind. We must "speak the truth in love." However, if we are "earnestly contending" it would be unrealistic not to expect at times to be misunderstood or even ridiculed. Love, indeed, means loving people enough to tell them the truth and to warn them of those who in the name of love pervert the truth. Accordingly, our compassion is mainly directed to the uninformed multitudes and young Christians who need to be protected from deceivers and dangerous leaders. Jesus had compassion on the multitudes, but publicly rebuked erroneous leaders.</FONT><P><LI> <B><A TARGET=_top HREF="http://www.cs.uidaho.edu/~suthe922/christian/ccm/">Community Christian Ministries</A></B> <I>(<CODE><A HREF="mailto:suthe922@cs.uidaho.edu">suthe922@cs.uidaho.edu</A></CODE>)</I><BR>
