<font size=5><strong>ERRI Threat Computers Light Up With Terrorism Warnings</strong></font><br>
By: C. L. Staten, ERRI Senior Analyst<br>
<br>
CHICAGO (ENN) - Alarm bells are ringing this morning throughout the Emergency Response &amp; Research Institute's 
(ERRI) computer operation center. Incident reports continue to pour in from Washington, DC, Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas, 
Hebron, Israel, Damascus, Syria, and other pressure points that suggest that America should be at a heightened state of 
alert for possible terrorist action.<br>
<br>
ERRI's threat computer records the incidence of on-going terrorist events, reported threats, previous situational analysis, 
and the current level of anti-U.S. rhetoric and then, using a series of &quot;expert algorthyms&quot;, issues a statistics-based threat 
level. Output is then examined by ERRI human analysts and given additional consideration in regard to overall threat 
planning and warning efforts.<br>
<br>
The ERRI threat computer currently indicates an 88% likelihood of an attack on U.S. targets, somewhere in the world, 
within the next 30 days. This threat level is almost as high as that during the Persian Gulf war, when the computer's 
estimate continually topped 90%. ERRI computer technicians and programmers are currently attempting to refine the 
computer's &quot;expert systems&quot; to further indicate more specific time frames, specific regions where the possibility of terrorist 
attack is greatest, and to identify potential antagonists prior to the act.<br>
<br>
Preliminary, and as yet unconfirmed, estimates would seem to indicate a general heightened threat level concerning U.S. 
commercial, diplomatic, and military personnel in Israel, Saudi Arabia, India, Pakistan, Turkey, the Philippines, Bosnia and 
some South American Countries. The U.S. State Department has issued a travel warning for Americans traveling to the 
Mid-East, urging caution in public places and on public transportation.<br>

By Paul Anderson, ENN Metro Correspondent<br>
<br>
CHICAGO (ENN) - Clark Staten, publisher of the the EmergencyNet News Service, today announced that 
effective immediately, the ENN Daily Report will be divided into two separate news divisions; &quot;The ENN Daily 
Intelligence Report&quot; and the &quot;ENN Daily Emergency Services Report.&quot; Staten said the change was being made in 
response to the reader comments and as a result of a user satisfaction survey conducted earlier this year. Staten said 
it is believed that the reorganization will give ENN better focus and expand ENN's coverage of events of specific 
interest to its readers.<br>
<br>
On January 1st, Mr. Jim Fay, who currently serves as ENN Bureau Chief in the New York/New Jersey area, will 
receive a promotion and will now assume Associate Editor duties, with primary responsibility for our 
Fire/Police/EMS and Disaster coverage (Emergency Service Report). Mr. Steve Macko will continue as Managing 
Editor of all publications, but will devote a majority of his time to reporting on Military/ Intelligence/National Security 
issues. He will provide able leadership for the Intelligence Report. Additional reporters will be added as needed to 
assist in both divisions.<br>
<br>
According to Mr. Macko, current e-mail subscriptions to the ENN Daily Report will be honored until their annual 
expiration, and until then, all current subscribers may receive either or both daily reports, as they so desire. At 
renewal time, however, subscribers will be asked to pick one daily report or the other, at the same $100.00 per 
year fixed price. Renewal subscribers will also be offered a special conversion rate of $150.00 per year for both 
reports. New subscribers wishing to receive both (Emergency Service and Intelligence) e-mail reports will be 
charged $200.00, or either individual report can be received for the standard $100.00 per year.<br>
<br>
Macko also said that ENN will provide a continuous, 24 hour a day, &quot;breaking news&quot; e-mail service which will 
includes immediate dispatch of stories from both the emergency service and intelligence reports, as well as updates 
of developing or continuing stories. Macko said that this &quot;Instant Update&quot; combination service will be priced at 
$250.00 per year. Effective January 15th, 1997, daily subscribers will not be receiving &quot;Instant Updates&quot;, unless 
they upgrade their subscriptions to that level.<br>
<br>
Staten said that all of the new changes are being made in order to better meet the needs of ENN readers and to 
provide only those services that subscribers desire. He said that ENN always welcomes comments, questions, or 
other requests for clarification regarding the services that it provides. Readers can request additional information by 
e-mail, send to: enn@emergency.com</p>

<font size=5><strong>HOSTAGE CRISIS GOES INTO ITS FIRST WEEK ...</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br><IMG SRC="/peruhi.gif" align=right>
LIMA, PERU (ENN) - A man claiming to be the international spokesman for the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement 
(MRTA) spoke to CNN from Hamburg, Germany, on Monday. He indicated that the MRTA would never surrender to 
authorities.<br>
<br>
In the interview, Issac Velazco said, &quot;Effectively, what the government of President Fujimori is asking is that the group 
gives up. The word surrender of capitulation is not in the vocabulary of the Tupac Amaru soldier.&quot;<br>
<br>
A woman claiming to be the wife of Velazco earlier on Monday called a Paraguayan radio station from Hamburg. She said 
that the MRTA was planning more attacks against the Peruvian government.<br>
<br>
Peruvian police sources confirmed that they believe another MRTA terrorist cell is at large in Lima and could attack if 
negotiations falter or go sour. One police source said, &quot;If police storm the Embassy, it is possible they will start car bomb 
attacks or other sabotage.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Red Cross reports that there has been no negotiations between the terrorists and authorities since Sunday.<br>
<br>
Peruvian officials are also trying to establish the real identity of seven of the 225 men who were freed on Sunday night. 
Seven names do not match those on a master list of hostages to be freed. There is a theory that an MRTA terrorist may 
have slipped out with the freed captives.<br>
<br>
President Fujimori and Interior Minister General Juan Briones Davila visited the scene at the Japanese ambassador's 
residence on Monday. They did not, however, get out of their bulletproof automobiles.<br>
<br>
A doctor, who has scene the hostages, reports that the unhealthy conditions inside of the Japanese ambassador's house has 
caused at least eight cases of eye infections and an outbreak of diarrhea.<br>
<br>
There was a report on Monday that cited Peruvian anti-terrorist police saying that the Lima attack was financed by ransom 
money obtained by the MRTA in 1995. The MRTA kidnapped a Bolivian businessman and held him captive for 46 days 
until a ransom of $1.2 million was paid. Throughout its 14-year history, MRTA has kept strong links with militants in 
Bolivia. The terrorists go back-and-forth between the two countries and several MRTA rebels are jailed in Bolivia.<br>
</p>
<p><font size=5><strong>FORMER MRTA HOSTAGE DEBRIEFED ...</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
LIMA, PERU (ENN) - Carlos Aquino Rodriguez, age 37, a university economics professor, was among the 225 men 
who were released by the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement terrorists on Sunday night.<br>
<br>
Aquino said that last Tuesday evening he had been enjoying the lavish party at the Japanese ambassador's residence when 
it was suddenly interrupted by an explosion. He said, &quot;Suddenly, at about 8:20 p.m. there was a tremendous explosion 
which stood everybody's hair on end and created total panic.&quot;<br>
<br>
The terrorists later told him how they had accomplished off their daring attack by dynamiting the wall of a house abutting 
the rear of the Japanese compound. He said that reports of terrorists infiltrating the party dressed as waiters was not true. 
Aquino said, &quot;That's not the case, they came shooting in the air and yelling. It was terrifying.&quot;<br>
<br>
The terrorists carefully censored their captives and divided them into different groups after the initial release of the women 
and the elderly. The hostages were divided by military officers, politicians and government officials, businessmen and 
diplomats. Aquino was placed into a group with other professionals.<br>
<br>
Aquino said that 28 people in his group were herded into a 12-foot by 18-foot bedroom. The hostages were closely 
guarded by heavily armed terrorists who were dressed in commando uniforms. They communicated with one another via 
two-way radio on a constant basis. He said, &quot;There was always one of them at the door. The idea was for us to be 
permanently watched.&quot;<br>
<br>
The only time Aquino said that he felt in danger for his life was during the first few hours of the siege when the terrorists 
were battling with police on the outside of the compound. He said, &quot;We suffered no physical or mental harm.&quot;<br>
<br>
Aquino spoke twice to terrorist leader Nestor Cerpa. He said that he grew to respect Cerpa. Aquino described Cerpa in 
this way: &quot;He explained his strategy and what his movement wanted ... My personal opinion is that he is a cultured man, 
well-read and quite intelligent.&quot;<br>
<br>
It is the opinion of Aquino that the MRTA did not merely seize the Japanese ambassador's residence as a publicity stunt. 
He described the mood of the terrorists when he left as: &quot;When we were saying good-bye, they said that they were ready 
for any military attack and were not in the least bit afraid.&quot;</p>

<p><font size=5><strong>URUGUAY APPARENTLY CONCEDES TO THE DEMANDS OF 
MRTA TERRORISTS</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
LIMA, PERU (ENN) - A new estimated number of 105 hostages still remain inside the residence of the Japanese 
ambassador in Lima. They are being held captive by at least 20 terrorists who are members of the Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement (MRTA).<br>
<br>
The latest hostage to be released was the Uruguayan ambassador. Ambassador Tabre Bocalandro was released on 
Christmas Eve. The ambassador was freed after a Uruguayan appeals court released two members of the Tupac Amaru, 
who had been jailed in that country. It is widely believed that the release of the two rebels is a concession to the MRTA. 
The judge that ordered the release of the two rebels insisted that his decision had nothing whatsoever to do with the 
captivity of his country's ambassador.<br>
<br>
A very unhappy Peru ordered its acting ambassador in Uruguay to return home in protest to the release of the two MRTA 
militants. It is believed that the Peruvians may think that Uraguay has &quot;undercut&quot; their bargaining position.<br>
<br>
The two released MRTA rebels were identified as Luis Alberto Samaniego and Silvia Gora Rivera. They were arrested by 
Uraguayan authorities for having fake Bolivian passports in their possession.</p>

<p><font size=5><strong>LOUD EXPLOSION ROCKS JAPANESE COMPOUND ...</strong></font><font size=3><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
LIMA, PERU (ENN) - A loud explosion early on Thursday rocked the residence of the Japanese ambassador in Lima, 
where 104 hostages are being held by members of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA). This is the ninth 
day of the hostage crisis.<br>
<br>
A policeman, at the scene, said, &quot;The explosion came from within the residence at the back part. We are trying to 
investigate it, but we cannot get very close.&quot;<br>
<br>
The explosion occurred at about 1:45 a.m. from inside the grounds of the residence behind the building where the captives 
are located. No injuries have been reported and no damage was seen to the house. It is uncertain if the blast was triggered 
by accident or if it was deliberate. Police estimated that the explosion was equal to about four sticks of dynamite.<br>
<br>
There was an unconfirmed report that two men were seen fleeing from the residence compound over nearby roofs shortly 
after the blast. These men may have been Peruvian anti-terrorist police conducting a recon mission and were spotted and 
warned off by the terrorists with the explosion.<br>
<br>
The blast came only hours after the MRTA terrorists released the sick, 34-year-old, first secretary of the Japanese 
Embassy in Peru. This brought the known total of hostages still being held to 104.<br>
<br>
There is a speculation that a behind-the-scenes deal may be worked out that will allow the MRTA terrorists to fly to 
asylum in Cuba after releasing the hostages. The reliability of this information is untested.<br>
<br>
Another rumor that is circulating is that Malaysia may attempt to cut a deal with the terrorists in order to secure freedom 
for its ambassador to Peru. Again, the source of this information is considered to be untested.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size=5><strong>PROFILE OF MRTA LEADER NESTOR CERPA ...</strong></font><font size=3><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
LIMA, PERU (ENN) - The leader of the terrorists who took over the residence of the Japanese ambassador has been 
identified as 48- year-old Nestor Cerpa. Cerpa, a long-time member of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement 
(MRTA).<br>
<br>
Cerpa is no stranger to the people and authorities of Peru. He is physically described as a stocky man of medium height. 
Cerpa walks with a slight limp with his right leg -- this limp was possibly caused by a wound in battle. He has a long, thin<br>
mustache and a week's worth of stubble on his chin. Cerpa is said to have &quot;deep, dark eyes.&quot; He wears a red-and-white<br>
bandanna with his green combat fatigues.<br>
<br>
All of the hostages who have been debriefed has described Cerpa in the same manner. Ramiro Validivia called Cerpa 
&quot;decisive and focused ... a very professional person. He has tried to appear completely diplomatic and educated.&quot;<br>
Kieran Metcalfe, a Canadian mining executive said Cerpa was &quot;a very articulate and committed individual.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerpa was born and raised in a working class neighborhood of Lima. He is said to have had little higher education. He first 
gained national attention about 18 years ago, when as a union leader he led 50 workers in the occupation of a textile 
factory. The union protested low wages and massive layoffs. Cerpa and the workers occupied the factory for more than 
six weeks before the Peruvian government ordered the police on 4 February 1979 to raid the plant. Their was a battle in 
which one policeman and three workers were killed.<br>
<br>
Following the clash, Cerpa was sentenced to serve almost a year for his part in the occupation. After being released and 
before going underground in the early 1980s, Cerpa became involved in leftist politics for a brief time.<br>
He became a member of Tupac Amaru and police say that he was personally behind the kidnappings of many business 
executives during the 1980s. The ransom money that was received helped finance the operations of the MRTA.<br>
<br>
The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement is modeled after the Cuban revolutionary movement of Fidel Castro. The 
group does not consider itself communist or Marxist. They have also maintained their distance from Peru's largest terrorist<br>
organization -- the fanatical Maoist Shining Path. Counterterrorism experts estimate that the MRTA has about 200<br>
followers. That figure is down from a high of 1,000 in 1989. The group does have a leftist ideology. It opposes the free-<br>
market reforms of President Alberto Fujimori. MRTA says that the reforms only benefit the rich in Peru.<br>
<br>
Peruvian anti-terrorism police said that Cerpa has also been known as &quot;Comrade Evaristo.&quot; In 1985, he began a series of 
attacks, takeovers and kidnappings. A Lima newspaper was taken over in November of 1985. Before a number of 
photographers, the leader of the group took off his hood -- it was Nestor Cerpa.<br>
<br>
In 1992, the founder and leader of the MRTA Victor Polay and his second-in-command, Peter Cardenas, were arrested 
by Peruvian authorities. With their capture, Cerpa became the leader of the group's military operations.<br>
<br>
The first person to identify Cerpa as the leader of the terrorists who took over the residence of the Japanese ambassador 
was leftist Peruvian Congressman Javier Diez Canseco. Canseco said that Cerpa was looking to reach a settlement 
through negotiations -- but that he was still a military commando.<br>

<p><font size=5><strong>Strategy Becoming Clearer; Political Concessions Continue</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor</p>
<p>LIMA. PERU (ENN) - The strategy of the Tupac Amaru terrorists is becoming clearer. On Thursday, Guatemalan 
Ambassador Jose Maria Argueta was released from captivity from the residence of the Japanese ambassador. It was said 
that he was freed because Guatemala had recently signed an agreement that ended a 36-year civil war with leftist guerrillas. 
Appearances would suggest that there may be a quid-pro-quo in the release of hostages and political acts by affected 
governments.<br>
<br>
All of the hostages who have been released say the same thing: the terrorists have treated their captives cordially and with 
respect. They have given the image of civility. There are still 103 hostages being held, including five ambassadors. The 
ambassadors still being held are from: Japan, Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, Honduras and Malaysia. <br>
<br>
It is known that four members of the MRTA are in prison in Bolivia. One freed hostage reported that he heard terrorist 
leader Nestor Cerpa tell Bolivia's ambassador: &quot;You're staying with me until the end.&quot; A Bolivian government spokesman 
said on Thursday that his government had no intention to giving in the pressure from the MRTA and will not release the 
four &quot;terrorists&quot; in exchange for their ambassador.<br>
<br>
NBC News on Thursday reported that a plan does exist to forcibly end the hostage crisis if necessary with an assault by 
elite police units from Peru and Japan. These police units are said to be currently training in a crude replica of the 
compound located in a remote part of Peru.<br>
<br>
A highly-placed Peruvian police official denied the claim that Japanese and Peruvian police are training together for such an 
assault. Japan, however, did send a small number of special police officers to take photographs of the compound on 24 
December.<br>
<br>
It is the opinion of counterterrorism experts, who have spoken to ENN, that if Peruvian and Japanese officials are planning 
such an assault -- they would be much better off if they were to allow &quot;experts&quot; from either the U.S., Great Britain or 
Germany to carry out such a plan. All three nations have reportedly offered their assistance in the matter. </p>
<p>Counterterrorism units from SFOD-Delta, the SAS Counterrevolutionary Warfare Wing and the German GSG-9 prepare 
themselves for this typical scenario on a constant basis and are better prepared to deal with this type of incident than any 
units that can be put together by Peru and Japan. Lives are at stake and geo-political pride should not get in the way, but it 
is still unlikely that non-Peruvian units will participate, excpet in an advisory capacity.<br>

<br>
</font><font size=5><strong>DAY 3 OF THE PERU HOSTAGE CRISIS</strong></font><font size=3><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
LIMA, PERU (ENN) - As day three of captivity began in the home of Japan's ambassador to Peru on Thursday, the 
dozen ambassadors and hundreds of other VIPs found themselves split up in separate rooms. They were being guarded by 
rebels who are armed with assault rifles and grenades.<br>
<br>
A Red Cross doctor who was allowed to enter the compound said that the hostages appeared to be calm and healthy. The 
number of people being held captive is uncertain but is now estimated to be more than 400.<br>
<br>
At the U.S. Embassy in Lima, a special hostage crisis center is being manned by special agents of the FBI. Washington has 
also dispatched an unknown number of &quot;security agents&quot; from a &quot;variety&quot; of governmental agencies. According to the State 
Department, the mission of the &quot;security agents&quot; is to &quot;advise&quot; the embassy on protecting the estimated 10,000 American 
citizens living in Peru against any other possible guerrilla attacks.<br>
<br>
Members of the Red Cross have been going in-and-out of the compound since Wednesday. There has been a report, 
however, that at least three Red Cross personnel were taken hostage by the rebels on Thursday. It is still not clear if the 
rebels are negotiating with the Red Cross or directly with the Peruvian government.<br>
<br>
The Red Cross has been supplying medical assistance, water and food. They reported that the hostages had been split up 
and were being guarded in separate rooms.<br>
<br>
Late on Wednesday afternoon, the ambassadors from Canada, Germany and Greece, along with a Peruvian Foreign 
Ministry member were released. Canadian Ambassador Anthony Vincent, however, has gone back and has been 
delivering messages to and for the rebels.<br>
<br>
It was reported in the international press late on Wednesday that the current and past chiefs of Peru's anti-terrorist police, 
known as DINCOTE, are among the hostages being held. Sources from within DINCOTE confirmed that current chief 
Maximo Rivera and former chief Carlos Dominguez were inside of the residence.<br>
<br>
Intelligence sources say that the guerrillas did not recognize all of the hostages and have sought identification from their 
captives. It is uncertain if the terrorists know that they are holding the police officials.<br>
<br>
New questions have arisen in Japan about the security the Japanese maintain for their diplomats abroad. In recent years, 
the security at Japan's 182 embassies and overseas missions has been increased. This was done because of Japan's rising 
global profile and its awareness of the dangers in today's world.<br>
<br>
However, critics say that Japanese embassy security lags behind other nations. It is hampered by its lack of expertise in 
intelligence gathering and lack of experience with violent crime. Hideaki Kase, an international diplomacy analyst, said, 
&quot;Japanese diplomats in Lima took lax security measures because they believed guerrilla or terrorist activities were 
subsiding.&quot; It is being reported that the Japanese Foreign Ministry is using a crisis operation room for the first time since it 
was built in 1990.<br>
<br>
There have been previous attacks at the Japanese Embassy in Lima. In 1993, a car bomb exploded there in an attack that 
was blamed on leftist guerrillas. After that incident, the Lima Embassy became one of Japan's most heavily guarded 
overseas missions.<br>
<br>
It is said prior to the hostage-taking incident, the Japanese Embassy was being protected by three security officers from 
Japan's National Police Agency, three or four guards from a Japanese security company and four Peruvian policemen in 
two police cars. The lightly armed police proved to be no match for the heavily armed MRTA rebels.<br>
<br>
The rebels have also cut all of the telephone lines at the residence and even reportedly found and cut a secret phone 
service that was attached to the house. Telephone contact has been reduced to cellular phone service.<br>
<br>
Kase added, &quot;Security measures taken by Japan are a far cry from those by the United States, which posts Marines on full 
alert in its embassies worldwide while Japan uses only one or a few police officers at each embassy.&quot;<br>
<br>
The MRTA attack on the Japanese ambassador's residence is also taking its toll on the image and economy of Peru. The 
fragile confidence in Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori is now being threatened.<br>
<br>
One newspaper political columnist said, &quot;It is a setback of at least four years. We've returned to being a country subject to 
terror.&quot;<br>
<br>
The whole of Peru apparently has been shaken by the daring incident that has propelled the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary 
Movement into the world spotlight. On Wednesday, the Lima Stock Exchange was forced to close three hours early 
because domestic stocks plummeted. Stocks lost about 3.5 percent of their value on Wednesday.<br>
<br>
For President Fujimori or Peru -- the timing of the situation could hardly be worse.<br>
<br>
All year long, the President's popularity has been dropping steadily. From a high of 75 percent in January to the current 
figure of about 40 percent. Peru's economic program has failed to produce jobs. The Peruvian economy has been stagnant 
all year after good growth in years 1994 and 1995.<br>
<br>
In February of 1980, a Colombian rebel group called M-19 tookover the Dominican Embassy in Bogota. Fifteen guerrillas 
held 57 hostages, including 19 diplomats for 61 days. The crisis ended when Cuban leader Fidel Castro mediated an end 
to the takeover and gave refuge in Cuba to the guerrillas.<br>
<br>
The situation in Lima could very much end up the same way.</font></p>

<p><font size=5><strong>DID PERU FAIL TO ACT ON WARNINGS?</strong></font><font size=3><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
LIMA, PERU (ENN) - After a late Thursday night meeting, the cabinet of President Alberto Fujimori tentatively decided 
to support the president's proposal to not to give in to the demands of the terrorists.<br>
At least 23 members of Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement continue to hold an estimated 375 diplomats and other 
hostages in the residence of the Japanese ambassador.<br>
<br>
The terrorists are demanding the release of about 300 of their jailed comrades, transportation to their jungle hideaway, a 
commitment from the Peruvian government to change its economic policies and an unspecified amount of money. The 
Peruvian government says that it will not meet the group's demands. The Red Cross has now reportedly taken the lead role 
as acting as a go-between between the MRTA rebels and the government.<br>
<br>
On Friday, the New York Times reported that Peru failed to act on prior warnings that were received in seized 
documents, intelligence informants and previous attacks. It was learned that the MRTA had been planning similar raids to 
that on the Japanese ambassador's residence. Peruvian intelligence had to this knowledge for more than a year.<br>
According to the Times article, Peruvian government security forces had made great strides in fighting terrorism in the 
country. They apparently became overconfident and chose to devote their scarce resources to the fighting of drug 
trafficking and the on-going border dispute with Ecuador.<br>
<br>
Also cited by the Times were experts and sources from within the Peruvian government that said Peru is not prepared to 
handle these type of crisis' and has no team of experienced hostage negotiators.<br>
<br>
John Caro, the former chief of Peru's anti-terrorism police, said, &quot;On the one hand, this attack was due to great planning by 
Tupac Amaru, but on the other hand, the forgetfulness of those charged with preventing it is to blame. The government's 
intelligence- gathering has failed because this could have been prevented.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The security forces were sloppy and overconfident. This attack could have been prevented with the same measures that 
any airline takes when passengers go onto an airplane,&quot; said Enrique Obando, who is an authority on terrorism and the 
military in Peru.<br>
<br>
One of the warnings that should have given Peruvian authorities notice came in 1995 when police arrested 23 members 
and associates of the Tupac Amaru, including Lori Berenson of New York. Police reportedly found elaborate plans to 
storm the Peruvian Congress. Among the items found in the police raids were: guns, mortars, rocket launchers, ammunition 
and diagrams of the Peruvian Congressional building and intelligence that indicated the hours and locations of guards.<br>
<br>
The mayor of the district where the Japanese ambassador's residence is located admitted that the Peruvian police were not 
very vigilant. He said that there were only about 15 officers guarding the compound at the time of the attack.<br>
<br>
Japan, on Friday, announced that it was increasing security at some of its embassies around the world. This is thought to be 
in response to the attack.<br>
<br>
The Japanese government has taken no direct role in the negotiations with the hostage-takers. But there has been some 
reported dissatisfaction expressed by the Japanese government with the way the Peruvians are handling the situation. A 
Japanese government spokesman said on Friday, &quot;There is considerable difference between the views of Japan and Peru.&quot;<br>
<br>
Late on Thursday, the terrorists freed four more hostages for medical reasons -- including one man in a wheelchair. There 
are still hostages from at least 28 countries left inside. A Red Cross doctor reported that the hostages were healthy and 
calm.<br>
<br>
Also on Thursday, the President of Ecuador said that he was willing to grant asylum to the terrorists. &quot;We have stated 
clearly that if we can be of help, providing the Peruvian government asks for it, we would accede to that,&quot; said Ecuadorian 
President Abdala Bucaram in response to a question about granting asylum.</font></p>

<p><font size=5><strong>UPDATE ON THE HOSTAGE DRAMA IN PERU </strong></font><font size=3>...<br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
LIMA, PERU (ENN) - The 23 terrorists from the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) who are holding 
about 340 men captive in the Japanese ambassador's residence released 38 hostages unexpectedly on Friday night. Water, 
chicken, salad and rolls were also delivered into the house on Friday. Portable toliets may be the next items to be sent in. 
Many are saying that there may not be a quick end to the apparent impasse.<br>
<br>
One the hostages who was released was 20-year-old Jerico Camino. He reported that there was a lack of food, water 
and living space inside of the house. The captives are being allowed to watch their plight on television.<br>
<br>
In an effort to wear down the terrorists, the Peruvian government turned off the water and electricity to the building. 
However, the residence is equipped with gas-powered electrical generator.<br>
<br>
A letter from the hostages was released to the news media on Friday. The letter said, &quot;Although our situation does not 
permit us to decide the fate that awaits us, we want to repeat our support for an effective negotiation that leads to a 
peaceful solution ... and discards violence.&quot;<br>
<br>
Camino, one of the hostages released on Friday, added that if the Peruvian government were to try and storm the 
residence, &quot;there would be casualties outside as well as in. And I think much more inside ... it would be a bloodbath.&quot;<br>
<br>
Also on Friday, a Peruvian television station broadcast a videotape that was said to have been made by the MRTA 
terrorists. It showed them preparing for the assault by studying a mock-up and photos of the Japanese ambassador's 
compound. The three-minute videotape showed people dressed in military-style gear with their faces covered by scarves.<br>
<br>
Javier Diez Canseco, a leftist Peruvian congressmen, was among the 38 men who were released on Friday night. He 
defended the terrorists and called for the government to negotiate a settlement with the terrorists. Canseco said that the 
hostage-takers are &quot;18 to 20 years old, maybe 21 ... They're a group of special forces, commandos. I think they're young 
men who want to live. They don't want to die.&quot;<br>
<br>
Also among those released on Friday were the ambassadors of Brazil, Egypt and South Korea. South Korean 
Ambassador Lee Won-young reported that all of the ambassadors were being held together in one room on the second 
floor of the building. Eleven ambassadors still remain captive.<br>
<br>
Counterterrorism experts and analysts who have been in contact with ERRI have said that the best course of action, at the 
moment, is to wait. As long as the terrorists continue to keep the lines of communications open and as long as they are still 
releasing hostages -- it is best to wait out the situation. Intelligence from the inside of the residence continues to flow out 
and this is an advantage to the authorities.<br>
<br>
An assault on the building should only occur if the terrorists start killing hostages. It would be in the best interest of the 
Peruvian government to accept assistance from the United States and consider any building assault be launched by 
members of the U.S. Army Delta Force, who are highly trained for these type of situations.<br>
<br>
Experts tell ERRI that based on the information that is known, an assault by US-SFOD (Delta Force) would have a high 
probability of success. But, they also say that such an attack is unlikely to take place as long as negotiations continue and 
hostages are being released by the MRTA.</font></p>

<p><font size=5><strong>PERU'S PRESIDENT STANDS TOUGH </strong></font><font size=3>...<br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
LIMA, PERU (ENN) - In his first public announcement on the hostage- taking incident in Peru, President Alberto Fujimori 
in a four-minute speech condemned the terrorists at the Japanese ambassador's residence. He called the MRTA assault 
&quot;repugnant&quot; and totally rejected the demands of the terrorists.<br>
<br>
The televised speech by the president took place late on Saturday night. Fujimori did not rule out an armed rescue attempt, 
but said that he was willing to explore a peaceful solution to the situation. The president's speech came hours after the 
MRTA rebel chief inside of the compound announced that he would gradually release any hostages who were not 
connected to the Peruvian government.<br>
<br>
Fujimori, in his speech, insisted that the terrorists lay down their arms and release all of the hostages. He said, &quot;You can't 
talk about a peace accord while using terror as the main argument.&quot; The president responded to the demand that the 
government release 300 jailed comrades of the rebels by saying, &quot;freeing people who commit murders and terrorist attacks 
is unacceptable ... They want dialogue while putting an AK rifle on the necks of the hostages.&quot;<br>
<br>
In a television interview, Victor Joy Way, the president of the Peruvian Congress, said that the elite units offered by 
&quot;numerous countries&quot; would not be necessary to resolve the crisis. It is felt by some experts that at least some Peruvians 
would view it as an insult to Peruvian pride for them to have to resort to the use of &quot;foreign forces&quot; to resolve the situation.<br>
<br>
In Washington, U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry refused to comment on Saturday when asked if U.S. Army Delta 
Force operators were ready to move to help rescue the hostages. Perry said, &quot;I will not comment on any action that is 
planned or not planned relative to dealing with that. Simply because lives of people are at stake.&quot;<br>
<br>
As dusk fell on Saturday, the chief of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, Nestor Cerpa, said in a shortwave radio 
interview that he wanted to avoid any bloodshed and believed that a peaceful resolution to the standoff could be achieved. 
Cerpa said, &quot;I want to repeat that the gentlemen who are the great majority and have no connection with the government 
will be released by degrees.&quot; He added that more hostages would be released &quot;in the next hours and days.&quot;<br>
<br>
On Sunday, a London newspaper reported that the terrorists are also demanding billions of dollars in ransom from large 
Japanese corporations such as Mitsubishi, NEC and Toyota. The Independent newspaper cited a European diplomat as 
saying that the terrorists were negotiating by cellular phone for money to release the hostages. The unnamed European 
diplomat said, &quot;They're asking for several billion dollars. And the chances are they'll get a decent percentage of that. 
There's a lot of bilateral negotiating going on.&quot;</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font size=3>ENN Special Report 12/22/96 - 20:20CST<br>
<br>
</font><font size=5><strong>Large Hostage Release Imminent?</strong></font><font size=3><br>
<br>
(ENN) An arrival of several buses and major movement of Peruvian police is fueling speculation that a large number of 
hostages will be released within the hour. Although exact details are still sketchy, it is believed that International Red Cross 
negotiators may have won the freedom of many, if not all, of those held in the Japanese Ambassador's residence.<br>
<br>
A shuttle of diplomatic and Red Cross representatives has been going on for the last few minutes and developments seem 
to be moving rapidly. A statement read on the behest of the MRTA said that they were releasing a &quot;sizable number of 
hostages,&quot; but that a number of people with connections to the Peruvian and Japanese governments would remain in 
captivity.<br>
<br>
ENN continues to monitor events in Lima and will provide updates as circumstances warrant.<br>

<p><font size=5><strong>TERRORISTS RELEASE 225 HOSTAGES </strong></font>...<br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
The defiant Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement terrorists continue to hold 140 high-profile hostages at the Japanese 
ambassador's residence in Lima after releasing 225 men on Sunday night. Despite the mass release, the MRTA terrorists 
showed no signs of giving in to the demands of Peru's president that they lay their weapons down and free the remaining 
hostages.<br>
<br>
Late on Sunday, at about 10:00 p.m., the released captives filed out of the house one-by-one. They looked tired, but 
elated. They were quickly taken to a hospital for routine medical checks. Among those released were the ambassadors of 
Boliva, Cuba, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama and Venezuela. Also released were diplomats from Bolivia, the European 
Union, Germany, Great Britain, Spain, the United Nations and seven U.S. Embassy officials.<br>
<br>
Those who are still being held captive are: the Japanese ambassador, several Latin American and Asian diplomats, about 
40 Japanese businessmen and Peruvian officials -- including two government ministers and the chief and former chief of 
Peru's anti-terrorism police. Also still being held is the brother of President Alberto Fujimori.<br>
<br>
The terrorists said that they freed the hostages as a &quot;Christmas gesture.&quot; However, they warned in a statement that the 
remaining captives would not be released unless Peru releases at least 300 of their jailed comrades. Fujimori has already 
flatly rejected this demand. In the statement from the MRTA terrorists, they warned that &quot;if Mr. Fujimori decides on a 
military solution, he will always find a Tupac Amaru member vigilant.&quot;<br>
<br>
Elite Peruvian special forces troops have reportedly drawn up an assault plan. Officials from U.S. SFOD Delta, the British 
SAS and the German GSG-9 reportedly may be advising the Peruvians. At least 900 policemen continue to surround the 
Japanese compound in Lima. The Panamanian press is reporting that as of Saturday, 21 December, there were elements of 
U.S. SFOD Delta (Delta Force) in Panama. The U.S. Southern Command in Panama refused to comment on these 
reports. President Fujimori has publicly indicated that he does not need help from foreign security advisors.<br>
<br>
Intelligence has indicated that elite Peruvian forces have been training for a possible assault on the residence. One source 
said that an assault would only be used as a last resort. A Peruvian police source said that a building assault would require 
ten operators for each terrorist inside. (Editor's Note: This figure is probably much too high.) The assault would last 
between three to five minutes. Peruvian security experts estimated that, based on past experience, the assault could result 
in a 20 percent casualty figure among the hostages. </p>
<p>Any raid on the 2-story residence is said to be a tough assignment. The windows of the building are barred and protected 
with a thick wire mesh. The building is surrounded by a high perimeter wall. At least four of the terrorists are known to be 
armed with telescopic night vision sights on their rifles and they are acting as snipers from windows on the second floor.<br>
The terrorists are heavily armed with AKM assault rifles, explosives, grenades and handguns. Intelligence from debriefed 
hostages has indicated that the terrorists have booby-trapped the entrances of the building with explosives.<br>
<br>
Speaking during an interview from inside of the residence, Peruvian Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela described the 
terrorists as well- armed and highly-trained. Peruvian security forces have reported that the terrorists are used to harsh 
living conditions and practiced the assault in the tropical jungles of northeast Peru. Police believe that the terrorists were 
probably trained by foreign militants. Among those suspected involved are former members of Colombia's M-19 
movement, the FMLN from El Salvador and Chile's MIR.<br>
<br>
The leader of the hostage-takers has been identified as 43-year-old Nestor Cerpa of Peru. Most of the terrorists are 
believed to be Peruvian nationals, but there have been reports that some of the terrorists speak Spanish with foreign 
accents. There has been a report that one of the suspects may be a Panamanian national.<br>
<br>
One of the freed hostages, Alejandro Toledo, said that what the Tupac Amaru terrorists really wants is an amnesty that 
would allow its members to participate in public life in Peru.<br>
<br>
It was in the opinion of Toledo that any attempt to rescue the hostages by force would be &quot;insane.&quot; He said that the 
terrorists were &quot;armed to the teeth.&quot; Rooms in the building, he said, were wired with explosives, as well as the roof. He 
added that the terrorists had anti-tank weapons and wore backpacks that are filled with explosives that can be detonated 
by pulling a cord on their chest. The reliability of the intelligence from Toledo is not known.</p>

<font size=5><strong>Revolutionary Group Takes Over Japanese Residence in Lima, Peru</strong></font><br>
By C.L. Staten, ERRI Senior Analyst<br>
<br>
(ENN) Preliminary and as yet, partially unconfirmed, information would indicate that the Japanese Ambassador's residence 
in Lima, Peru has been taken over by the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA). As many as 40 people, 
including diplomats have reportedly been taken hostage and an armed barricade situation is reportedly on-going at this 
hour.<br>
<br>
According to local witnesses, a group of approximately 20 men, armed with automatic rifles and grenade launchers, 
stormed the home at approximately 20:00p.m. (local time) on Tuesday night. It is believed that Japanese ambassador 
Morihisa Aoki, Peru's foreign minister Francisco Tuleda, and the ambassadors from Brazil, Spain, and Cuba may also be 
held by the guerillas.<br>
<br>
According to a Lima radio station, a spokesperson for the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement called them to claim 
responsibility for taking the hostages. The guerillas threatened to kill all of the dignitaries, unless Peruvian authorities 
released their compatriots from prison. The spokesman also allegedly called for negotiations with the government, to be 
held publicly on live television and radio.<br>
<br>
The onset of the attack on the residence was reportedly punctuated by several powerful explosions and gunfire was heard 
between security personnel and the guerillas. It is unknown, at this time, if any injuries or deaths occurred during the 
take-over.<br>
<br>
The situation near the residence is described as extremely tense as soldiers and special police units are positioned to 
surround it. The Peruvian government is said to be consulting at this hour with the various governments who have hostages 
inside the compound. This latest assault by the Amaru guerillas is viewed as a major escalation in their battle with the 
established government of Peru.<br>
<br>
ENN continues to monitor events in Lima and will provide additional updates as more become available.<br>

The MRTA has decreased in strength in recent years, following raids by anti-terrorist police and jail sentences for leaders. 
Political infighting within the group has also caused it to splinter and be less organized. Some counter-terrorist experts 
report that they thought MRTA was just about disbanded a year and a half ago. However, it is thought that members do 
still possess the training and equipment to carry out some operations.<br>

<font size=5><strong>TERRORIST SIEGE IN PERU</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor and C. L. Staten, Senior Analyst<br>
<br>
LIMA, PERU (ENN) - Rebels from the Peruvian Tupac Amaru movement staged a well-executed, military-style raid 
upon the house of the Japanese ambassador on Tuesday night. Explosions were heard and gunfire was exchanged with 
police for almost hour.<br>
<br>
At the end of the initial clash the guerrillas had taken control of a compound the covers an entire block and sits behind a 
15-foot high wall that is topped by a 10-foot electrical fence in Lima's San Isidro residential area. About 170 hostages, 
mostly women and elderly people, were released after a few hours of the assault. It is estimated that the rebels are still 
holding about 200 hostages.<br>
<br>
Among the hostages are the ambassadors from: Austria, Boliva, Brazil, Canada, Cuba, Germany, Japan, South Korea and 
Venezuela. As Well as the foreign and agriculture ministers of Peru, six Peruvian legislators, the president of Peru's 
Supreme Court and dozens of Japanese businessmen. It is reported that there are seven American citizens among the 
captives. Four of the Americans are said to work for the U.S Agency for International Development. The U.S. 
ambassador to Peru, Dennis Jett, reportedly left the Japanese ambassador's residence just before the armed guerrillas 
started their attack.<br>
<br>
Latest information indicates that 23 rebels, including three females, are in control of the compound. At least one guerrilla, 
believed to be a leader, has reportedly suffered a serious gunshot wound to the leg.<br>
<br>
The daring plan took place at about 8:00 p.m. on Tuesday night. A reception honoring Japanese Emperor Akihito's 
birthday was taking place. Peruvian police said that some of the guerrillas slipped past security by posing as waiters. 
Reportedly, a rocket was fired into the building and a shootout erupted. There were reports of rebels even scaling the walls 
of the residence. In the beginning of the drama, the hostages were gathered and told to lie face-down on the floor for about 
40 minutes.<br>
<br>
The rebels are calling their operation &quot;Breaking The Silence.&quot; On Wednesday morning, they claimed to hold 250 hostages. 
The MRTA guerrillas also said that they have laid explosive booby- traps at the entrances to the building.<br>
<br>
<font size=4>The Situation</font><br>
<br>
Witnesses described the hostage-takers as being dressed in black and armed with automatic weapons and grenades. They 
were said to be &quot;calm and determined.&quot;<br>
<br>
According to press reports, Peruvian police reportedly may have fired tear gas into the compound earlier today. If it 
happened, it may have been a mistake. The rebels were equipped with gas masks and the only people affected were the 
hostages.<br>
<br>
Early on Wednesday, the MRTA rebels threatened to kill the captives unless their demands were met. One rebel speaking 
to a local radio station by telephone said, &quot;We are clear -- the liberation of all our comrades or we die with all the 
hostages.&quot;<br>
<br>
The MRTA says that they have 400 to 500 of their comrades in Peruvian prisons and insist upon the release of them and 
their leader, Victor Polay, who has been serving a life sentence since 1992. The group also wants a review of Peru's 
judicial system and direct negotiations with the Peruvian government.<br>
<br>
One rebel said that the MRTA guerrillas want to be transported with their freed comrades to the group's &quot;war zone in the 
jungle.&quot;<br>
<br>
There have been several developments in the situation since mid-morning. At about 9:00 a.m. a loud explosion was heard 
and smoke could be seen from within the compound. This was followed by a number of shots. It is uncertain if the shots 
came from MRTA rebels, from inside the compound, or from police on the outside.</p>
<p>The rebels are demanding that Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori personally meet and negotiate with the hostge-takers. 
A guerrilla spokesman told a local radio station, &quot;The only thing I want to say is that the president must come and speak to 
us personally. Nothing will happen to him, we only want dialogue.&quot; The press, on the scene, did report that Fujimori was 
seen near the incident at mid-morning.<br>
<br>
It has been reported, by at least one media outlet that the rebels have set some sort of noon EST deadline for their 
demands to be met or they will start killing the hostages. It is unknown if MRTA has the wherewithall to carry out these 
threats.<br>
<br>
ENN has also received unconfirmed reports that there may have been a prison uprising this morning where some, if not 
many, of the MRTA prisoners are being held. It is not certain who is currently in control of that Peruvian prison. Additional 
information on this development is sketchy at the time of this report.<br>
<br>
Chile has reportedly tightened its security on its border with Peru &quot;to prevent members of the terrorist group from trying to 
enter Chile,&quot; according to Chile's interior minister.<br>
<br>
<font size=4>Errors and Omissions on Both Sides?</font><br>
<br>
One mistake that the hostage-takers would appear to have made is that they have allowed the hostages to make phone 
calls from within the embassy. This could prove to be a very good source of intelligence about what is happening inside, the 
numbers of hostage-takers, how they are armed, where they may be deployed inside the building and so forth. However, if 
the negotiations do not go the way that makes the rebels happy -- this source of intelligence will probably stop.<br>
<br>
However, Peruvian police have also been making their mistakes. Besides allegedly firing ineffectual tear gas into the 
compound, they have refused to send medical aid for two hostages and one rebel who have been wounded. The head of 
the Red Cross in Peru, who was on the scene shortly after dawn, confirmed that the government had not responded for the 
request for medical assistance.<br>
<br>
The Spanish Foreign Ministry has said that they have been asked by the guerrillas to send medical supplies inside the 
Japanese compound. Doing so could again afford counter-terrorist forces an an additional opportunity to collect data on 
the hostage takers. But, those kinds of decisions must be made by hostage negotiators.<br>
<br>
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, is the son of Japanese immigrants. It has been reported that he has been in close 
contact with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, and that Fujimori is personally overseeing the negotiations with 
the rebels. Fujimori's mother was among the hostages who were freed. This was probably another mistake that was made 
by the rebels.<br>
<br>
In a call to Japan's NHK news service, the Japanese ambassador said that the hostage-takers wanted to talk directly to 
the President of Peru. Skillful negotiators will probably, however, attempt to prohibit direct contact between Fujimori and 
the hostage takers, as it restricts their options. The ambassador indicated that he was being held in a room by five or six 
rebels, whom he described as being young and armed with handguns and rifles.<br>
<br>
<font size=4>Military/HRU Response</font><br>
<br>
It would be Standard Operating Procedure (S.O.P.) that the U.S. Army's Delta Force counterterrorism unit would send 
operatives to act as observers in worldwide incidents such as this. This particularly true when American citizens are being 
held as captives, as is the case in Peru. Operatives from the British SAS may also be dispatched as observers, if there are 
British hostages involved. This is sometimes done with or without the permission or knowledge of the host government... in 
this case, Peru.<br>
<br>
It is also possible that a contingent of special forces operatives would also be forward deployed to Panama in order to be 
closer to the incident, should they be needed. However, it is the opinion of ERRI that the Peruvian government will most 
likely not request assistance from the United States or other governments. State department officials have already been 
quoted this morning as saying that Peru will take the lead in resolving the incident.<br>
<br>
The Hostage Rescue operational capabilities of the Peruvian counterterrorist units are not well known, although they have 
been involved in counter-narcotics and insurgency operations for several years. Many on the scene may be paramilitary 
troops/special police units, who are more familiar with jungle counterinsurgency operations, rather than a possible assault 
on a hostage-filled building in an urban area.<br>
<br>
ENN is closely monitoring the situation and at present is unable to predict the possible outcome of the situation. It is 
believed, however, that a &quot;period of crisis&quot; could come this afternoon, and again early tomorrow morning...if this situation is 
not peacefully resolved.<br>

<p><font size=5><strong>PERU HOSTAGE SITUATION UPDATE</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
LIMA, PERU (ENN) - The Tupac Amaru rebels who have taken between 200 and 300 hostages at the residence of the 
Japanese ambassador threatened to start killing their captives at 1220 EST today if their demands were not met.<br>
<br>
At noon EST, the commander of the rebel operation told Peruvian television, &quot;If in twenty minutes we do not have an 
answer we will begin to take our first victim and the first victim will be Foreign Minister Tudela (of Peru). We can't wait 
any longer.&quot;<br>
<br>
The guerrilla commander also said, &quot;Up to now there is no harm but within an hour they (the hostages) could suffer harm. 
We only give him (Fujimori) one hour more. If within an hour the president does not communicate with us he will see the 
results.<br>
<br>
ENN is closely watching the situation and as of 1345 EST no hostages have been known to be killed. There has been 
considerable activity seen around the compound. One person was seen to enter the residence. Police sharpshooters have 
taken positions all around the ambassador's residence.<br>
<br>
Several nations have reportedly urged the Peruvian government to do everything in their power to protect the hostages and 
not to use force against the guerrillas. These requests have come from countries with ambassadors inside of the building. 
An updated list indicates that the ambassador from Panama is among the hostages and possibly the ambassador from 
Spain.<br>
<br>
It was reported that a representative of the Red Cross was allowed by the guerrillas to enter the compound and negotiate 
with the rebels. The Red Cross representative said that he estimated that there were 300 people in the compound. It has 
been confirmed that among the hostages who were released after the initial attack were the sister and mother of Peru's 
President.<br>
<br>
At 9:00 a.m., what was believed to be a stick of dynamite was exploded on the patio of the residence by the rebels. There 
were no reports of any injuries.<br>
<br>
This attack by the Tupac Amaru movement seems to fall into the category of terrorism that has fallen into disuse in recent<br>
years by terrorist groups. The MRTA seems to want a lot of media coverage for their cause. They have been talking 
extensively to the local media and have allowed the Japanese ambassador to talk to Japan's NHK.<br>
<br>
Tupac Amaru lost much of its strength in recent years after most of its leaders and many of its members were captured and<br>
sent to prison. Peruvian police reported that they arrested five suspected rebels in the initial attack on Tuesday night.<br>
<br>
The Red Cross reported that besides wanting the release of their comrades from prison in Peru, they are also demanding<br>
the release of MRTA rebels being held outside of the country. It is believed that other Tupac Amaru rebels are 
incarcerated in Boliva and Uruguay.<br>

<font size=5><strong>MID-AFTERNOON UPDATE OF THE PERU HOSTAGE 
SITUATION</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
LIMA, PERU (ENN) - The first deadline set by the rebels who are holding a new estimated 490 hostages at the Japanese 
ambassador's residence has come and gone with no apparent bloodshed. The rebels, who are members of the Tupac 
Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), issued a 1220 EST deadline that passed with no apparent action taken.<br>
<br>
The MRTA rebels are still demanding the release of 400 to 500 imprisoned comrades, including their leader Victor Polay. 
They are also demanding safe passage to their hideaway in the jungles of Peru.<br>
<br>
Several countries with nationals being held are appealing for calm in handling the crisis. Spain has cautioned the Peruvian 
government that the use of force could lead to a massacre.<br>
<br>
While talking to Peruvian President Fujimori, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar asked that Peru security forces 
employ psychological tactics against the guerrillas.<br>
<br>
Germany, whose ambassador is being held, offered Peru help in resolving the situation. German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel appealed to the Peruvian government to be prudent in its efforts.<br>
<br>
Panama has indicated that it believes that ambassadors and other diplomats from 18 different countries are being held 
captive, including diplomats from Great Britain, France and Poland.<br>
<br>
The British have confirmed that one member of their Embassy staff is among the hostages. The British Foreign Ministry has 
said that it has offered assistance to Peru. In a statement, the foreign ministry said, &quot;We stand ready to consider any 
request from the Peruvians for assistance.&quot; The British assistance could come in many forms.<br>
<br>
On Wednesday afternoon, a fax was sent from within the residence to the relatives of the hostages. The fax indicated that 
there may be as many as 490 hostages. The letter was signed by Peruvian Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela, Japanese 
Ambassador Morihisa Aoki and other ambassadors who are being held captive.<br>
<br>
The signatories of the fax said that they were speaking on the behalf of &quot;around 490 people, Peruvian citizens and officials, 
and foreign functionaries and diplomats.&quot; The letter also said, &quot;We believe it is indispensible to establish a dialogue. There 
are injured who require treatment.&quot; Four elderly men were reported released this afternoon by the rebels.<br>
<br>
In Canada, its foreign minister confirmed that up to 490 hostages were being held hostage. Canadian Foreign Minister 
Lloyd Axworthy said, &quot;Reports that we've had is that so far the hostages have been given proper treatment. We are clearly 
calling for moderation declared for those who are holding them captive. But at the same time, they've issued various 
demands that the Peruvian government release a number of their cohorts. I think a pretty fundamental principle is that to 
give in to those kind of demands simply exacerbates and increases the problem.&quot;<br>
<br>
Four Canadians are reported among the hostages. They include Anthony Vincent, the Canadian ambassador to Peru. 
Foreign Minister Axworthy added the Peruvian government has established a negotiating team, but it is uncertain what, if 
any, contact the team has had with the hostage-takers.</p>

<p><font size=5><strong>Warning; Internet Used by Foreign Intelligence Operatives</strong></font><br>
By: C. L. Staten, Senior Analyst<br>
<br>
(ENN) Chicago, IL -- According to reports from the Defense Investigative Service, the Internet is one of the fastest 
growing areas of intelligence gathering by foreign governments and potential enemies of the United States and her allies. It 
is believed that foreign entities are making extensive use of the &quot;net&quot; in an attempt to both gather military and commercial 
information, as well as to spread disinformation.<br>
<br>
Particularly from Eastern European, Middle Eastern, and Far Eastern regions, numerous contacts have reportedly been 
made via the Internet to American defense contractors, software producers, and related industries...all asking for 
&quot;proprietary or sensitive&quot; information. Often these contacts suggest unsolicited offers to act as sales agents, consultants, or 
representatives in other countries. Others suggest that the writer is working for a &quot;friendly&quot; foreign government or military 
agency.<br>
<br>
Another ploy involves asking for product information, schematics, blueprints, or other proprietary information about the 
targeted companies or their products. Free samples of software and/or actual working models are also often requested.<br>
<br>
A third subterfuge involves using e-mail to engage in &quot;social engineering&quot; with company employees and attempting to 
establish friendships with employees, which could prove beneficial to more traditional espionage methods.<br>
<br>
ERRI is currently working on a more thorough report in regard to this burgeoning threat and can be expected to present a 
detailed examination of this important issue within the next few weeks. We would welcome commentary in regard to the 
extent of this problem. In the mean time, we strongly urge military and defense industry officials to review their 
Operational/Internal Security plans and be constantly aware of these attempted intrusions.</p>

Subj: <font size=4><strong>Commentary on article &quot;Emerging, Devolving, Threat...&quot;</strong></font><br>
<br>
To: Letters to the Editor, Emergencynet News<br>
<br>
In a recent essay on terrorism and consequence management response published by ENN, Colonel G.I. Wilson, USMC 
and Mr. Fred Fuller, USAJFKSWCS, FT Bragg made several observations to which I am compelled to respond. Note 
that this response is reflective of my opinion and judgements and does not reflect official DoD policy or position.<br>
<br>
I. The authors suggest that terrorist acts are a &quot;sporadic&quot; event in today's environment:<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's face it - if someone seriously desired to perpetrate terrorist acts, the newspapers would be full of headlines of such 
horrors every day. Due care and vigilance is indeed necessary to prevent the most common acts, and alert security 
personnel and modern equipment and security techniques foil a significant number of would-be terrorists every year...we 
shouldn't go overboard on hysteria and fear mongering in the face of all this (or) the WMD threat...&quot;<br>
<br>
1.	Colonel Wilson and Mr.Fuller may be correct regarding the fact that many non-state group events are pre-empted by 
robust anti-terrorist efforts, however international news media reports typically carry daily accounts of terrorist violence (or 
plans for such violence) in locations such as N. Ireland and the British homeland; France and Corsica; Algeria; Egypt; 
Pakistan; India; Sri Lanka; Israel; or Latin America. In any given week the total casualties from terrorist events exceed 100 
dead or injured. On balance if they are referring solely to the U.S., one only needs to go below the &quot;surface&quot; of U.S. 
national media reporting to examine what is not typically addressed: <br>
<br>
a. International groups such as Hamas, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam, and the PIRA are generating financial reserves 
in the U.S. through a network of &quot;non-profit&quot; organizations and donations.<br>
<br>
b. Companies such as Iran's Bonyade Mostazafan operate through a world wide network of veneers (reported to include 
Canada, UAE, Germany, Singapore, and NY) to acquire &quot;restricted for Iranian import&quot; duel use technologies, computers, 
and equipment to enhance programs that most certainly include terrorism. <br>
<br>
c. Inner city &quot;terrorism&quot; that operates in the form of the &quot;18th Street Gang&quot; in L.A. (sophisticated, multi-ethnic group that 
includes some &quot;cyber-talent, &quot; operates a WEB page out of New Zealand; deals drugs and death in the City of L.A.) or El 
Rukns in Chicago.<br>
<br>
d. The on-going trial of Kevin McCarthy, Peter Langan, Scott Stedeford in Des Moines, Iowa. This little group, referring 
to themselves as the &quot;Aryan Republican Army,&quot; appeared to be playing out a repeat of Robert J. Mathew's &quot;The Order&quot; of 
circa 1983-84 fame, hitting at least 22 banks over a two year period. In addition they may have some interesting ties to 
Hayden Lakes, Idaho; Elohim City, Oklahoma; and those that bombed the McMurray building. <br>
<br>
I recognize that I have included events commonly referred to as &quot;criminal&quot; acts in this discussion, however I think we all 
agree that a fine line exists between crime and terrorism, this line being the dilemma of the &quot;policy-maker&quot; who is charged 
with developing legislative language and laws that dictate law enforcement (state and federal) and DoD response 
parameters to these &quot;criminal&quot; or &quot;terrorist&quot; acts. <br>
<br>
2.	I agree with the Colonel and Mr. Murray [Fuller] that we should not inflate the terrorist threat potential U.S. citizens 
face, particularly the WMD variant. After all, when you examine U.S. national statistics, 38,000 people a year generally die 
of wounds inflicted by small arms compared to ?? that are killed in actual terrorist events involving U.S. citizens. However, 
unless one is prepared to go before Congress or the Executive branch and categorically state for the record that terrorist 
acts will not occur (WMD or otherwise) against U.S. troops, civilians, or high value assets, those charged with protecting 
our Nation will be told to do everything possible to minimize the potential for such events. This &quot;demand&quot; drives a 
requirement to develop and maintain both a well trained anti-terrorist (AT) capability composed of sound intelligence 
efforts and appropriate physical security programs; and a counter-terrorist (CT) capability composed of robust 
crisis/consequence management teams. Both capabilities are needed in areas where these events are likely to occur - 
against U.S. personnel and businesses living-operating overseas, and in our own heavily urbanized and industrialized cities 
which offer a plethora of &quot;media-catching-symbolic-targets&quot; for the non-state group to attack.<br>
<br>
3.	Despite Colonel Wilson and Mr.Fuller's accolades regarding the abilities of &quot;small town fire departments,&quot; etc., to 
respond to crisis, the fact remains that there exists no standardized plan to train and equip &quot;first responders&quot; to resolve the 
consequence of even a limited scope terrorist WMD event. As a rejoinder to this comment I am aware that many States 
maintain quite capable hazmat response teams. The key to mitigating the effects of a terrorist (WMD) event lies in the 
fusion of local existing capabilities with standardized training, equipment, and C2 procedures. I know that the Federal 
Government is presently working on some of this through FEMA, PHS, and other agencies. However to elucidate the 
present problem, consider these two cases:<br>
<br>
a. In May of 1996, Philadelphia hospitals were overwhelmed by 100+ heroin junkies who had all acquired and used a 
lethal combination of heroin laced with cocaine, dextromethoraphan, thiamine, and scopolamine. As reported, ER facilities 
at hospitals were quickly overwhelmed by these casualties, in some cases being turned away. An unsophisticated attack 
involving the use of a nerve agent (easily produced by those social elements that engage in the &quot;illegal&quot; manufacture of 
methamphetamine) would easily surpass the problems these hospitals &quot;think&quot; they experienced trying to treat these &quot;heroin 
cocktail&quot; casualties.<br>
<br>
b. In spring of 1996, Community Hospital on Monterey, California, treated a patient who had reportedly ingested a large 
amount of organophosphate &quot;bug-spray&quot; (neuro- toxin). The fumes coming off the patient's vomitus incapacitated the ER 
staff attending this patient and virtually shut done the ER capability of this hospital until the facility had been decontaminated 
by a local hazmat team, an effort that easily took several hours. A similar case occurred in a Los Angeles hospital wherein 
the patient was contaminated with the chemical DMSO. In this case attending medical staff were also incapacitated by the 
fumes emanating from the casualty.<br>
<br>
4.	Though our &quot;first responders&quot; are quite capable , they still need to be adequately trained and equipped to deal with the 
threat of a chemical or biological &quot;event&quot; if a potential threat truly exists. To date only two metropolitan areas maintain such 
capabilities. They are Washington D.C. through the Arlington Fire Department; and Atlanta, GA. Of note, the London 
Telegraph recently published a report concerning the development of consequence management teams for the London 
subway system. The bottom line is unfortunately a tough pill to swallow: If chemicals such as G series or VX nerve agent 
are used in a terrorist attack, first responders have between four and forty minutes (depends on level of exposure and other 
factors) to start treating casualties with necessary antidotes. In a biological attack scenario, time lines for symptom onset 
will probably stretch out somewhat depending on the toxin/pathogen used and population exposure. <br>
<br>
5.	Unfortunately terrorist acts create (within many people) a superordinary sense of fear and vulnerability, more so than 
that generated by inner-city crime. I'm sure this deductive observation can be confirmed by talking to those who survived 
the Ethiopian 767 that ditched off of the Comoros last week (probably more accurately defined as a criminal hijacking vice 
terrorist incident), the casualties and kin of the Oklahoma City and World Trade Center complex bombings, and those 
DoD personnel that where attacked at Khobar Towers. The fact that this &quot;security dilemma&quot; exists in the face of statistical 
evidence that suggest a greater chance of dying on a metro freeway does little to appease anyone; and it is this &quot;security 
dilemma&quot; that drives the development of prescriptive measures you see today. Hopefully these measures include robust 
ideas and plans that will allow us to &quot;get on the front end of the problem&quot; in the AT arena. This will minimize the occurrence 
of events that require the response of consequence management assets. <br>
<br>
6.	Surely when crises response/consequence management teams have to go to work, we are already playing a game of 
&quot;catch up football.&quot; Success in the AT arena lies in the development and maintenance of new ideas and cooperative efforts 
between local, state, federal, and international entities, particularly in areas related to intelligence sharing. Note: I am not 
advocating an increase in legislative mandates that restrict, minimize, or otherwise intrude on the freedoms and protection 
we enjoy as U.S. citizens. Draconian methods are neither required or desired. What I am suggesting is a &quot;Revolution in 
AT-CT&quot; affairs that requires an examination of how we are doing business with the multitude of assets we presently have (I 
am cognizant of present JCS efforts to do this from the DoD side of the house). If these things are done right, we can 
minimize the potential of our having to &quot;exchange business cards&quot; at future disasters such as the World Trade Center 
bombing or the Aum subway attack. In the words of General John Shalikashvili &quot;...We are going to have to do things 
differently...If we miss the opportunity, nothing will happen and we will have to wait for the next Khobar Towers.&quot;<br>
<br>
II. Colonel Wilson and Mr. Fuller suggest that:<br>
<br>
&quot;The stateless actors largely responsible for these threats might represent a relatively wide- spread movement with global 
reach and significant resources though with no single identifiable nation-state or government to support them. They might be 
an isolated small group with few resources save the willingness to inflict damage, injury or death in the name of a cause or 
for criminal gain. Witness the activities of international gangs. Finally, the threat from rogue states is onerous as well...Even 
so, we cannot afford to be complacent about existence of an emerging threats. Going on a permanent war footing both at 
home and abroad is hardly a reasonable response. Calm, cool, reasoned evaluation, threat assessment and planning are in 
order here&quot;<br>
<br>
1. Non-state actors have been engaging in terrorist violence since biblical times (yes, I recognize from an academic 
perspective that the &quot;nation-state&quot; came to be recognized as such circa 1625 with the peace of Westphalia...the term 
&quot;non-state&quot; applied to terrorist acts pre-1625 may be academically unsound). That terrorist events seem to garner more 
attention this year is truly a function of international balance of power adjustments adjunct to the end of the Cold War. 
Security dilemmas caused by the Cold War have been supplanted by those related to the affects of regional conflicts and 
non-state violence which includes terrorism.<br>
<br>
2. The stateless terrorist actor is emerging as &quot;well financed.&quot; Aum Shinrikyo is reported to have been worth $1.4 billion 
dollars by the time the Japanese National Police &quot;rolled them up.&quot; Open source press accounts of Osama ibn Laden 
(dissident Sunni millionaire now reported to be operating with the Taliban militia in Afghanistan) suggests that he funds 
several radical Islamic revivalist groups. Further, circumstantial information derived from press reports and interviews with 
Osama indicate some connection to those that bombed: (1) the World Trade Center (1993); (2) U.S. personnel in Riyadh 
(November, 1995), and Dharan (Khobar Towers, summer, 1996). In a final example, the Provisional Wing of the Irish 
Republican Army is said to require annual expenses of at least $12.5 million dollars (so they are able to generate at least 
that much per year).<br>
<br>
3. In conclusion, if there truly exists a terrorist threat to U.S. citizens, particularly one involving the threatened use of 
WMD, local and state law enforcement-emergency response agencies are going to have to rely on the Federal government 
for funds, training, and equipment. This can certainly be accomplished without our having to &quot;go on a permanent war-time 
footing.&quot; Most of those individuals who have recently attempted to characterize the nature of this threat are not suggesting 
that &quot;the sky is falling,&quot; though it may if we don't engage in a few, sound, precautionary measures, measures I'm sure both 
the Colonel and Mr. Fuller are actively engaged in pursuing.<br>

<p><font size=6><strong>Emerging, Devolving Threat of Terrorism</strong></font><br>
<br>
By Fred Fuller, USAJFKSWCS, Ft. Bragg, NC<br>
Colonel G.I. Wilson, OSD, USMC<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></font><br>
<br>
Today, despite the end of the Cold War, there continues to be no shortage of threats to stability and security across the 
globe. A consensus is forming which defines many aspects of these emerging threats. The most obvious thing about the 
entire gamut of threats is that many of them are essentially stateless in origin and devolutionary in nature. Many of these 
current threats are smaller in scale, befitting actions originating at the lower end of the spectrum of conflict championed by 
stateless actors.<br>
<br>
Martin Van Creveld in his seminal work, &quot;The Transformation of War&quot;, contends we are seeing the end of a monopoly on 
violence by larger nation- states. This monopoly is being replaced by a panorama of stateless actors responsible for threats 
to our security.<br>
<br>
The stateless actors largely responsible for these threats might represent a relatively wide- spread movement with global 
reach and significant resources though with no single identifiable nation-state or government to support them. They might be 
an isolated small group with few resources save the willingness to inflict damage, injury or death in the name of a cause or 
for criminal gain. Witness the activities of international gangs. Finally, the threat from rogue states is onerous as well.<br>
<br>
Central Intelligence Agency Director, John Deutch while recently addressing Congress notes the recent proliferation of 
biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons is accentuated by the growing danger posed by so called rogue states like Iran, 
Iraq, and Syria. All seeking to acquire weapons of mass destruction (WMD).<br>
<br>
One of the most important things to keep in mind is that we shouldn't go overboard on hysteria and fear mongering in the 
face of all this. The horrors implicit in various emerging threats are, unfortunately, relatively easy to perpetrate and, if 
attempted, likely to capture the attention of the media. If proof of that statement is needed, observe the surprising number 
of journalists in the past few months who have taken it upon themselves to 'test' the security of various airports by 
wandering into off-limits areas unchallenged, secreting fake bombs or smuggling fake weapons into controlled areas or 
even aboard aircraft.<br>
<br>
All these escapades have been carried out against a backdrop of terrorism theories surrounding the recent downing of 
aircraft and bombings both home and abroad. One of the most important things to keep in mind is that we shouldn't go 
overboard on hysteria and fear mongering in the face of this WMD threat. The horrors implicit in various emerging threats 
are, unfortunately, relatively easy to perpetrate using information warfare and capturing the attention of CNN.<br>
<br>
Let's face it- if someone seriously desired to perpetrate terrorist acts, the newspapers would be full of headlines of such 
horrors every day. Due care and vigilance is indeed necessary to prevent the most common acts, and alert security 
personnel and modern equipment and security techniques foil a significant number of would-be terrorists every year.<br>
<br>
Even so, we cannot afford to be complacent about existence of an emerging threats. Going on a permanent war footing 
both at home and abroad is hardly a reasonable response. Calm, cool, reasoned evaluation, threat assessment and planning 
are in order here. Over reliance on technology is not a prudent response either, as reflected by General Krulak's remarks 
in Defense News (7 Oct). The human factor- supplemented with good planning, training, and useful equipment- is the most 
likely counter to these emerging threats.<br>
<br>
It seems reasonable to assume that if the emerging threats are devolutionary, the only successful responses will be 
devolutionary in nature as well. The ability to identify, anticipate and cope with emerging threats will have to be moved 
downward to the level at which initial contact with the threat is likely to present itself. Infrastructures allowing an escalating 
ability to respond rapidly to isolated incidents of any sort which may be quite serious will have to be developed or refined 
as necessary.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>DOMESTIC ISSUES </strong></font><br>
<br>
Many small town fire departments, as well as some Guard and reserve units, with their 'mutual aid' response agreements 
and compacts, demonstrate a good example of the basic concept. Escalating capabilities should be developed and made 
accessible in both civil and military areas.<br>
<br>
Domestically the areas of civil utility systems (water, power, transportation etc.), financial institutions, population centers 
and other vulnerable areas require threat assessment and response planning. Law enforcement, fire/rescue, Guard/Reserve 
as well as other governmental and non-governmental assets must anticipate and prepare to cope with new threats and 
different responsibilities involving a variety of contingencies perhaps involving biochemical, nuclear, and conventional EOD 
incidents along with evacuation operations.<br>
<br>
Flexible, multitiered response plans to a variety of contingencies must be developed, enhanced, coordinated and simulated. 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is the logical federal lead agency to drive this planning, working 
down through state government to the level of local governments. Many small town fire departments, with their 'mutual aid' 
response agreements, demonstrate a good example of the basic concept. Escalating capabilities should be developed and 
made available.<br>
<br>
The capabilities in areas of selected types of domestic emergency responses such as SWAT, hostage rescue, medical 
rescue disaster and firefighting have received more emphasis in most localities and infrastructure exists which allows 
escalating levels of response to meet various levels of need for incident response and management. That capability should 
be expanded and broadened to include emerging threats as well.<br>
<br>
Attempting to centralize public safety and RC/Guard capability to respond to threats or attacks will likely result only in 
extended response times, inadequate response to multiple incidents and the creation of yet another inviting target. Plans for 
various biochem and emerging domestic contingencies should be developed and domestic contingencies exercised to 
surface planning shortfalls and familiarize various agencies with unforeseen demands arising from the necessity of working 
together in major domestic emergencies.<br>
<br>
Assuming at face value that in many domestic emergencies &quot;only the military can handle that-it's too big a problem for the 
civilian sector&quot; is not prudent. If that's the case, we need to train and develop the capability in the civilian sector where it 
can handle most domestic incidents.<br>
<br>
&quot;All of this points out the need for immediate funding of new and different kind training and equipment for local 
Police/Fire/EMS personnel,&quot; comments Clark Staten of the Chicago based Emergency Response &amp; Research Institute 
(ERRI). &quot;They are the front-line of defense if the unthinkable happens...and some fanatic were to attack our country with 
these weapons of mass destruction (WMD),&quot; he added. &quot;Bottom-line... we need to develop an totally integrated response 
against terrorists and terrorism...this must include local emergency agencies, the military, and the medical research 
community... if we are to be truly prepared for the threat of a chemical or biological attack,&quot; Staten concluded.<br>
<br>
If effective integrated response and recovery abilities are to be made possible, they will have to be created at the local and 
state level in a building- block approach. The beginnings of the training infra-structures are already in place with Reserve 
and Guard units located all across the country. Nevertheless, more work is needed to coordinate and field capabilities that 
may prove necessary. OSD can play a significant role in the coordination and facilitation of this effort. However, response 
and execution must remain at the local level.<br>
<br>
One of the areas where there needs a great deal of legal and operational thought with respect to identifying emerging 
threats is the thinning line between police and military activities domestically in combating these threats.<br>
<br>
The use of military forces in any continuing capacity within the borders of this country raises questions. If additional civil 
manpower, training or equipment is needed, means should be found to provide. Paul Anderson, EmergencyNet News 
(ENN) Associate Editor, in a recent article, suggests expert help that local agencies would need must come from the 
Center For Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, the U.S Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases 
(USAMRIID) at Ft. Derrick, Maryland, or a new specially trained team of U.S. Marines called the Chemical/Biological 
Incident Response Force (CBIRF). Unfortunately, it might be several hours before these highly trained specialists could 
arrive on the scene of the incident. In the mean time, local fire, EMS, and law enforcement agencies would be responsible 
for the management of the emergency.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, if additional manpower, training or equipment is needed for domestic emergencies, means should be found to 
provide it, to include planning and coordinating with Marine, Reserve Component and Guard forces in appropriate roles. 
Likewise, the collection and analysis of domestic intelligence to thwart domestic terrorism must be conducted responsibly 
to avoid abuses of civil liberties and privacy.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>FORCE PROTECTION</strong></font> <br>
<br>
Today the threat of domestic terrorism is fueled by the threat of terrorism overseas. Deployed DoD personnel are 
increasingly inviting targets and must be secured as well. In the wake of the terrorist attack at the air base in Dhahran, 
Saudi Arabia, the Pentagon is undertaking initiatives to provide quick and effective response to protect DoD personnel 
around the globe. New policy avenues must be explored to allow a more adequate range of responses to threats from 
beyond our shores.<br>
<br>
A good deal of work has gone into this area already and some successes have resulted. Cooperation between military 
assets and civil law enforcement overseas has been heightened in order to better confront the threat. Increased military 
emphasis on conflict at the lower end of the spectrum is necessary to more ably cope with emerging threats, and has yet to 
be adequately emphasized. This often means people intensive efforts (HUMINT, patrols, infiltration, psyops, civil affairs, 
security details) not high technology per se is required to address some of the emerging threats sponsored by stateless 
actors.<br>
<br>
Many difficult policy decisions will have to be made by the OSD leadership before putting military personnel in harm's way 
again in the future. Factors too numerous to discuss here enter into those decisions. Military personnel thrust into many of 
the scenarios envisioned by the theoreticians and associated with emerging threats will need different equipment, training 
and support in addition to that which is currently in place.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>SUMMARY </strong></font><br>
<br>
The solutions to the problem of protecting ourselves and our society from emerging WMD threats will be complex and 
demanding. We think that is one of the few certainties in the whole equation of the emerging threat.<br>
<br>
A great deal of effort will have to be focused on understanding the origin of these emerging threats and of negating them 
without violence wherever and whenever possible. Discovering the existence of real threats is necessary but essential 
privacy and other such civil liberties must not be sacrificed in the attempt. Likewise we cannot afford to run roughshod 
over other nations abroad.<br>
<br>
At some times and in some circumstances happier solutions will not be possible and violence will have to be met with 
violence. When that is the case it must be applied within the bounds of legitimate use-of-force doctrine, with civil law 
enforcement officers and military personnel subject to strict accountability.<br>
<br>
We understand clearly that this is a very tall order. Yet to fail in the direction of over control and invasiveness will certainly 
cause larger problems and more surely damage our society as we know it than any possible amount of terrorism.<br>
<br>
The causes that brought these emerging threats to the forefront took a long time to develop. They will take an even longer 
time to solve as well.</p>

<p><font size=5><strong>A POSSIBLE NEW ROLE FOR U.S. INTELLIGENCE ...</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
Some experts are saying that it may be time for the U.S. intelligence community to recognize new customers for its 
products. These new customers may actually be the general public. Ever since World War II ended, intelligence has been 
designed to support and inform the President and senior officials of the Executive Branch. But today, the world is a much 
more complex place.<br>
<br>
Many of the people who read this publication can be considered to be individual citizens who pursue information on 
international political, social and economic objectives that are independent of government. Many are retired from 
government service. As a whole, we are not sure how much of the government is now reading the information that ENN 
provides -- but most of our indications suggest that it is substantial and growing every day.<br>
<br>
The Emergency Response and Research Institute may be considered a &quot;public agent&quot; and we only deal with what is 
considered to be &quot;open source&quot; material. Our strength is in our ability to gather, analyze and disseminate it. We know that 
various parts of the intelligence community are using the information that we are providing and that's where the 
transformation is now taking place.<br>
<br>
The private community is furnishing the intelligence community with vast amounts of data and information. Some say, now, 
that's it's time for U.S. intelligence to return the favor.<br>
<br>
The intelligence community does, in a way, disseminate information to the public. A good example of such a product is 
exemplified by the CIA's Foreign Broadcast Information Service. This service collects, translates and publishes thousands 
of foreign media reports on a daily basis.<br>
<br>
But as readers of this publication can attest to, U.S. intelligence provides more interesting information on the opposite end 
of the spectrum in the form of Indications and Warning intelligence that concerns imminent threats to national security that is 
aimed at informing the commander-in-chief and his military advisors.<br>
<br>
In between those two extremes is where the ENN DAILY REPORT is situated and where U.S. intelligence can better 
serve non-governmental interests -- of which, some say, the public has a legitimate claim.<br>
<br>
Richard F. Kaufman, the former chief counsel of the congressional Joint Economic Committee, said, &quot;Given the volume of 
material they're producing, you have to wonder who in the Executive Branch is even reading this stuff. Here is this very 
valuable resource. It's been paid for. There are all these experts sitting there. And who's benefiting? There's a lot of fertile 
ground here, where the intelligence agencies are grinding out reports on all kinds of subjects that are not reaching the 
Congress and the public.&quot;<br>
<br>
Intelligence officials do testify before congressional committee hearings on a regular basis and there are a variety of reports 
that are published by the intelligence community -- but these represent only a drop in the bucket compared to what is 
actually collected and produced. Experts, such as Kaufman, say that the information could benefit the public and have no 
adverse impact to national security or even in divulging how the information was collected.<br>
<br>
The late former CIA director William Colby also agreed with providing more information to the public. He drew an 
analogy between intelligence and journalism by saying, &quot;Deep Throat's identity remains a secret, but the nation has 
benefited from his information.&quot; Colby added, &quot;Intelligence substance can be disseminated to the public while its sources 
are kept secret.&quot;<br>
<br>
Colby thought designing intelligence for public consumption could also enrich the intelligence community itself. Many CIA 
analysts are said to appreciate feedback on the reports that they write because they so rarely hear from the end consumers 
that they write for.<br>
<br>
In 1978, Colby wrote: &quot;Intelligence must accept the end of its special status in the American government and take on the 
task of informing the public of its nature and its activities. By far the most effective manner of accomplishing the task ... is 
by letting the public benefit directly from the products of intelligence, its information and assessments.&quot;</p>

<title>Call For International Bio-War Inspections</title>

<p><font size=4><strong>Call For International Chemical/Biological WarfareVerification Program</strong></font><br>
By C.L. Staten, ERRI Senior Analyst<br>
<br>
(ENN) Washington, DC -- John Holum, Director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, reportedly today 
will call for a formal biological weapon inspection system to be setup throughout the world. Mr. Holum, in a pre-release 
statement in Washington, said that the current state of the art in biotechnology could lead the world to a &quot;return to the dark 
ages.&quot; Holum's speech is to be presented today at the opening of a Geneva, Switzerland conference on the 1975 Biological 
Weapons Control Convention.<br>
<br>
&quot;Over-all, the United States believes that twice as many countries now have or are actively pursuing offensive biological 
weapons as when the original convention went into force,&quot; Holum's prepared text said. &quot;Now we face tyrants and terrorists 
who would return us to the dark ages...outlaws who share their predecessor's ancient depravity..but, with weapons that 
are frighteningly more modern,&quot; Holum added.<br>
<br>
According to the arms control agency in Washington, the original biological control convention did not include a provision 
that allowed on-site inspections of those suspected of producing offensive bio-weapons. Holum said that he hoped the 
most recent meetings addressed the issue and would provide for investigations into all cases of &quot;credible evidence&quot; of 
bio-weapon development or production.<br>
<br>
In closing, Holum's speech said, &quot;We can wait for a tragedy...for biological weapons to surpass what other weapons have 
done in Tokyo, Japn, Oklahoma City, or the Gulf War...Or, we can act now.&quot; Many, within anti-terrorism circles tell ENN 
that they sincerely hope that Mr. Holum's effort are successful. If not, they say they have serious concerns of a &quot;Biological 
Pearl Harbor&quot; in the coming decade.</p>

<p><font size=4>Freeh Goes to Saudi; Dhahran Bombing In6estigation<br>
</font>By C. L. Staten, ERRI Analyst<br>
<br>
(ENN) Washington, DC -- Speculation is rising that Saudi Arabian security officials may be about share some vital 
information about the June, 25th Dhahran barracks bombing that killed 19 Americans. FBI Director Louis Freeh is 
reportedly enroute to Saudi Arabia this weekend to meet with senior military and police officials there.<br>
<br>
Freeh's trip gas announced late Friday by FBI sources, who emphasized thad he is attending &qEot;at t(e invitatioN of KinG Fahd

Kingdom; both times, he reportedly returning without any substantial data about the perpetrators in the bombing.<br>
<br>
Several reports have surfaced that the Saudis have detained as many as forty (40) &quot;shi'ites radIcals&quot; and &quot;Saudi nationalists&quot; 
during their investigations, and that some of the suspects may have links to Iran or other Mid-Eastern countries. Secretary 
of Defense William Perry previously seemed to verify these allegations, but later recanted and said that they had &quot;reached 
no firm conclusions&quot; about who had unleashed the tragedy at the Al-Khobar complex.<br>
<br>
ERRI analysts say that they believe that &quot;efentually,&qeot; facdual tiec will be drawn between dhe hahran bombers and &quoD;a

<p align=center><font size=5><strong>Situation Report; Selected Events - Uganda/Zaire/Burundi - 11/14/96</strong></font><br>
By C. L. Staten, ERRI Senior Analyst<br>
</p>
<p align=left><br>
Sept. 3-10, 1996 -- While it may be only a coincidence, early September finds Iranian President Akbar Hashemio 
Rafsanjani on a tour of several African nations, including those involved in the current conflict. Rafsanjani is quoted as 
accusing America and European nations of &quot;raping the the continent of Africa like colonialists.&quot; He offers a &quot;hand of 
friendship and support,&quot; to all African nations, as he works to ensure a continued flow of Iranian oil to the area.<br>
<br>
Sept. 10, 1996 -- The Zairean Army has moved quickly to quash fears of a coup while President Mobutu Sese Seko is in 
Switzerland for prostate surgery. Mobutu seized power in 1965, allegedly with the assistance of Western powers. A series 
of army-led revolts, rioting, and looting have taken place since 1991...some say leading to the current situation there. 
Analysts say that without Mobutu's government leadership that the country could quickly disintegrate into a situation similar 
to Somali or Libera, with &quot;warlords and militias&quot; fighting for overall control.<br>
<br>
Sept. 24, 1996 -- U.N. agencies starting evacuating non-essential staff from the Eastern Zairean town of Bakavu, following 
&quot;heavy exchanges&quot; of gunfire between Rwandan army and Zairean forces. Rwanda's defense minister, Emmanuel Ndahiro, 
charged that Zairean forces had opened fire first with anti-aircraft guns and 75mm rifles. In Kinshasa, Zairean Foreign 
Minister Kititwa Tumansi alleged that the exchange was prompted by artillery fire from Rwandan forces that landed in 
Bukavu.<br>
<br>
Sept. 29, 1996 -- Over 2,000 Burundi secondary education students start military training under the supervision of Col. 
Nzihabandi Cyrille. Compulsory military training was instituted after Major Pierre Boyoya came into power by force. In 
June, rioting and demonstrations displaced the government of President Ntibantuganya, accusing it of complicity with Hutu 
rebels opposed to the regular army. Mobilization of youths such as these is commonly viewed as a precusor to major 
military&#127; activities.<br>
<br>
Oct. 2, 1996 -- The World Health organization (WHO) holds a conference in Cameroon to prepare for &quot;eventual 
outbreaks&quot; of epidemics in Central African Sub-region. According to a report issued at that meeting, at least 3,000 people 
have died in June and July from &quot;various epidemic diseases&quot; in the Central African area.<br>
<br>
Oct. 15, 1996 -- The Commander of the &quot;Uganda People's Defense forces&quot;, Maj. General Salim Saleh, charged that 
rebels of &quot;Lord's Resisance Army (LRA), killed four people and committed an arson attack on United Nations and 
Lutheran World Federation trucks, destroying 14 of them. The attacks took place in Northwest Uganda. A spokesperson 
of the High Commissioner for refugees in Kampala confirmed the attack and said that the U.N. compound in Pakele had 
been &quot;overun.&quot;<br>
<br>
Oct. 17, 1996 -- An estimated 200 LRA rebels ambushed a convoy in Northwest Uganda, reportedly killing 20 people 
and burning several vehicles. The rebels allegedly also overran the Pakwach police station and abducted four police 
officers, including the station's commander. Other reports are received that the rebels had raided a girls school in the Apac 
district, earlier in October, and kidnapped as many as 150 girls...20 of whom are still being held hostage by the rebels.<br>
<br>
Oct. 18, 1996 -- 25,000, mainly Burundi, refugees are reported fleeing their camp near the Eastern Zairean town of Uvira 
after fighting between the Zairean military and ethnic Tutsi rebels (Banyamulenge) left three dead and several wounded. A 
U.N. refugee coordinator said that the camp at Kagunga was &quot;virtually empty&quot; as refugees fled the fighting. This attack 
followed another attack, a few day earlier, on the camp at Runingo, where Hutu refugees from Burundi fled from an attack 
by &quot;unknown armed men.&quot; According to UNHCR representatives, there are thirteen camps in the area of Uvira, with a 
total population of 220,000.<br>
<br>
Oct. 31, 1996 -- Fighting between Zairean troops and Tutsi rebels rages near the Eastern city of Goma. Mortar and heavy 
weapons fire is reportedly occurring in an area two kilometers north of the Goma city limits. An area of Eastern Zaire, 
close to both Rwanda and Burundi is reportedly now outside of the control of the Zairean military, following a &quot;lightning 
campaign&quot; by Tutsi guerillas. &quot;Bloated bodies&quot; are continually found floating up on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, raising 
fears of both a continued massacre and the spread of a number of infectious diseases..including cholera. The refugee camp 
at Mugunga is declared the largest encampment of displaced persons in the world, with an estimated 400,000 people 
there.<br>
<br>
Nov. 5, 1996 -- Several African leaders are calling for a deployment of a &quot;neutral force&quot; to Eastern Zaire to protect more 
than 1 million refugees. In Goma, Red Cross workers report that they buried more than 400 bodies of people thought to 
have been killed in factional fighting. In Kinshasa, roadblocks are set up and cars hijacked as anti-Rawandan 
demonstrations take place. In France, Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko is still recovering from cancer surgery and 
reportedly not able to be directly involved in events in his country. U.N. diplomats meet with Rwandan strongman Paul 
Kagame, in an effort to defuse rising border&#127; tensions; Rwandan Foreign Minister says Rwanda would oppose any 
&quot;international military intervention&quot; into Eastern Zaire.<br>
<br>
Nov. 8, 1996 -- Zairean aid workers report that an &quot;apocalypse&quot; is underway as Rwandan refugees die by the thousands. 
Dr. Fernando Rodriquez of Doctors of the World (medecins du monde) says that Eastern Zaire is in &quot;virtual mayhem,&quot; with 
armed bands looting warehouses in Katale and Kahindo and pillaging &quot;anything of value.&quot; Rodriquez also charged that 
Zairean troops, hired to guard aid workers, had stolen their vehicles and fled, leaving them to the mobs. A spokesperson 
for the Action for Churches Together (ACT) reported that there was a large contingent of refugees hiding in the jungle 
between the Zairean towns of Hombo and Walikale.<br>
<br>
Nov. 13, 1996 -- Under heavy diplomatic pressure from France, the United States announced that it was considering 
sending U.S. troops to assist in &quot;humanitarian assistance&quot; in Zaire. An advance team of 40 U.S. military advisors is 
reportedly sent to Uganda to assess the situation on the ground, in the region. Repeated mortar and artillery shelling 
reportedly interrupts the distribution of food and water in the Goma area. Although French defense officials deny the 
report, a relief plane was reportedly fired upon, rebels saying they suspected it contained French troops. Rwanda and 
some rebel groups accuse France of a secret agenda to restore Zairean authority and of helping the Hutus. Statements to 
the press indicate that rebel troops have threatened to attack French troops if they arrive in the Goma area.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>Unseen Threats</strong></font><br>
<br>
This region of Central Africa is &quot;the home&quot; of any number of infectious diseases. Reports have been received from that 
region, within the past two years, of outbreaks of dysentery, meningitis, cholera, typhoid, pneumonia and even the dreaded 
Ebola virus. Both aid workers and military personnel must be prepared to effectively manage circumstances involving 
unsanitary conditions and an unrestrained spread of any number of viruses. Medical personnel will need large amounts of 
antibiotics, IV fluids, gloves, gowns, and isolation equipment.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>Weapons in the Region</strong></font><br>
<br>
Both U.N. and independent investigators report that, in the past two years, that Zaire has been a hub of transshipment for 
weapons of all kinds. Weapons have been sold on both the black market and through legal arms deals to any number of 
the 200 ethnic tribes/groups in the region. Reportedly, vast numbers of Ak-47 assault rifles have flooded the area, allegedly 
sold there by members of the former Soviet bloc. The extremely reliable weapons can allegedly be obtained in Zaire for as 
little as $150.00 per rifle.<br>
<br>
South Africa has also reportedly been involved in both legal and illegal arms sales to Rwanda, including a recent sale of 
$18 Million dollars worth of R-4 assault rifles, mortars, machine guns, and land mines. The government in Pretoria, under 
international pressure, is said to have halted arms sales recently...but, not before many weapons may have moved between 
the two countries.<br>
<br>
Zairean officials accuse the Tutsi-led governments in Rwanda and Burundi of arming insurgents. Suspicion also falls on 
Uganda, who may have armed Tutsi guerillas involved in taking power in Rwanda in 1994. A variety of both Hutu and 
Tutsi rebels are believed involved in the illegal arms trade, with criss-crossing arms sales throughout the border areas.</p>
<p align=left><font size=4><strong>Conclusions</strong></font><br>
<br>
As the fighting in Zaire grows fiercer by the day, there is every prospect of the whole of Central Africa degenerating into 
violent and bloody war. Unless the United Nations can achieve the near impossible and halt the civil fighting in the southern 
provinces in Zaire, it seems inevitable that neighboring Rwanda and Burundi will be drawn into outright war which would 
force this vast region of Africa into another terrible cauldron of genocide.<br>
<br>
While President Mobuto Sese Seko of Zaire recovers in France from treatment for cancer, his government is flooding Kivu 
with fresh troops in an attempt to contain an advancing army of rebel Tutsi fighters. The 300,000 Tutsis, known as the 
Banyamulenge, have lived around Kivu for over 200 years. Several weeks ago, the Zairean government renounced their 
citizenship and ordered them back to Rwanda, the land of their forefathers, or to face concentration camps. The 
Banyamulenge rose up in revolt. In their path, thousands of Hutus, their sworn enemies, have crossed the border from 
Rwanda, to escape the savagery of Tutsi forces, then fled north to Bukavu. The Zairean government ordered the army to 
crush the revolt while the UN airlifted its aid workers out of Bukavu.<br>
<br>
Zaire has already accused the Tutsi-led governments of neighboring Rwanda and Burundi of aiding the rebels, but the UN 
has pleaded with all governments to step back from aggression. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has called for 
an emergency mission followed by an international conference. The key question for any conference is a stark one: is the 
UN prepared to act, to commit forces to police this powder keg?<br>
<br>
It may appear brutal, but the simple fact is that this is not the Persian Gulf... where oil was at stake. This is not Bosnia... 
where the security of the West and the stability of Eastern Europe could have been threatened. Only France and Belgium 
have past colonial links with this part of Africa and they have both, as yet, remained out of the conflict, except for their calls 
for others to intervene.<br>
<br>
It is alleged that no other Western power has any real economic or political stake in the heart of Africa, and a number of 
policy experts believe that it has nothing to offer but trouble for those becoming involved there. The only responsibility 
there for the West...the only important question...is a moral one. As terrible as it may sound, morality has its price, and the 
world powers have to decide if they are prepared to pay that price, and intervene in a violent, complex, and potentially 
unresolvable political and ethnic situation.<br>

<title>White House Announces Zaire Deployment</title>

<font size=5><strong>White House Announces U.S. Deployment to Zaire</strong></font><br>
By: C. L. Staten, Senior Analyst<br>
<br>
(ENN) White House spokesman Mike McCurry today announced that United States troops will join a multi-national 
military force, lead by Canada, which will provide &quot;humanitarian assistance&quot; to refugees in Zaire. According to McCurry, 
the situation in Zaire is reportedly &quot;rapidly deteriorating&quot; and as many as 1.2 million refugees may be at serious risk.<br>
<br>
Diplomats at the United Nations say that they expect a resolution, supporting the proposed multi-national force, to be 
passed within the &quot;next day or two.&quot; They indicate that there are many details to be worked out, but that they anticipate 
quick passage of such a resolution. As many as 12 nations are expected to participate in the effort, with a possibility of 
additional nations to be added in coming days.<br>
<br>
A U.S. military assessment team was reportedly dispatched to Uganda on Wednesday to begin to gain a better 
understanding of the needs &quot;on the ground&quot; in Eastern Zaire. They are expected to be followed immediately by 1,000 U.S. 
forces, many of whom will be dispatched to secure an airport near Goma.<br>
<br>
Senior military officials tell ENN that they are cognizant of the possibility of &quot;humanitarian disaster&quot; in Africa, unless some 
urgent international action is taken. But, there is also a concern among military leaders about American troops again 
becoming inextricably involved in a situation similar to Somalia, where American troops came under fire from guerilla 
forces. Reservations among the military are said to include having a well-defined mission, having an exit strategy, and 
implementing effective rules of engagement to protect the troops being dispatched to the area.<br>
<br>
Related reports from Rwanda and a number of other nearby countries indicate an increasing number of of &quot;firefights&quot;, 
artillery and mortar fire, and some rioting within the past 24 hours. Extremists in several areas have reportedly threatened 
aid workers and taken hostages. Instability across several borders, in the region, is said to be on-going at this time. Both 
media and relief personnel on the ground in Africa report that the situation there is &quot;fluid&quot; and &quot;chaotic.&quot;<br>
<br>
ENN continues to monitor the situation in Africa and will provide updates as the circumstances warrant.<br>

<title>Could Taleban Stabilize Afganistan?</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<p>Excerpted from the ENN Daily Report - 11/07/96 - Vol. 2, No. 312</p>
<p><font size=5><strong>COULD THE TALIBAN BRING STABILITY TO AFGHANISTAN?</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
If you want to freeze the blood of officials at the U.S. State Department, the Pentagon or at the White House all you have 
to do is merely mention the words: &quot;Islamic fundamentalists.&quot; Visions of extreme, radical, militants will march through the 
heads of policymakers.<br>
<br>
And why not? Ever since radical Iranians took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979, followed by a number of terrorist 
bombings and hijackings in the early and mid-1980s. The mere phrase of &quot;fundamentalist Islam&quot; makes most Americans 
want to run to a bomb shelter or as in the case of most of the people who read this publication -- look for means of 
retaliation.<br>
<br>
The Taliban, a Sunni Muslim religious militia captured the Afghan capital of Kabul in late September. The Islamic clerics 
and followers of this movement seized the capital after a two- year campaign against government forces. After taking 
Kabul, the Talban moved quickly to establish a new civil order in Afghanistan. Though their actions were seen as less 
physically brutal, they nevertheless were very harsh. The Taliban leadership closed down all of the girls' schools. Women 
were ordered not to go to work outside of the home. If women were to venture on the outside, they were to cover their 
bodies from head to toe -- or face beatings. All of this was in the name of a traditional Islamic code. Women all over the 
country are reported to be furious and depressed by the Taliban actions.<br>
<br>
The neighbors of Afghanistan and Western governments are less concerned with the social and religious activities than they 
are about strategic questions. Analysts are being asked: Will the Taliban be a stabilizing or a disruptive force in a region of 
expanding Islamic influence that is now spreading from Pakistan to Turkey and through central Asia?<br>
<br>
Barnett Rubin, an Afghanistan expert at the Council of Foreign Relations, said, &quot;The answer is, yes. Most likely they will be 
both.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the short term, the Taliban are expected to be a stabilizing force -- if they can hold onto power and there is still a 
question of that. They will stabilize Afghanistan that has been at some kind of war with itself or with outside invaders 
seemingly forever. After the Soviets withdrew in 1989 and the puppet communist regime folded in 1992, the tribes in the 
country resumed their everlasting battle against one another.<br>
<br>
Historically, Afghans always battle each other for control of the country. When the country is invaded by outside forces, 
the tribes then combine forces to repel the invader -- and they usually are victorious -- they then turn on each other once 
again.<br>
<br>
For the past four years, the tribes have been fighting a bloody civil war.<br>
<br>
It was hoped that with the Taliban emerging as the single dominant force in the country, the devastation of war and the 
misery to million of refugees would finally come to an end. Recent pictures of the capital of Kabul, show a city reduced to 
virtual rubble.<br>
<br>
Neighboring Pakistan, a country that is also going through political turmoil -- though not on the level of Afghanistan -- 
hopes that Afghan stability will allow the opening of safe trade routes to Central Asia, which would be an alternative to 
dealing with the outlaw state of Iran.<br>
<br>
Other encouraging signs of the Taliban being in control is, as Rubin explains, &quot;The Taliban do not have any links to Islam's 
international radicals. In fact, they hate them.&quot; As mentioned, the Taliban are Sunni Muslims, not Shi'ites like the Iranians.<br>
<br>
&quot;And they are not into exporting revolution,&quot; said Zalmay Khalilzad, who is an Afghan-born senior analyst at the Rand 
Corporation. As long as the new Afghan regime is not involved with international radicals, the U.S. apparently cares little 
about who governs the country -- as long as it is governed.<br>
<br>
The bad news is that the Taliban are probably most unlikely to hold onto power in the long-term. They could anger the 
Pakistanis or the Uzbeks or the Tajiks. India is nervous about the Taliban. They worry about an alliance with Pakistan. 
Russia is worried about them, as well. They don't need anymore trouble on their southern border.<br>
<br>
The Taliban Islamic beliefs are described as medieval and are said to be hopelessly incompatiable with modern Islam and 
with incorporation into a world economy. Afghanistan has always been one of the poorest countries in the world -- and to 
not attempt to involve itself in a modern world economy will only push Afghanistan further behind.<br>
<br>
An interview with the Taliban foreign minister this past weekend on CBS' newsmagazine &quot;60 Minutes&quot; indicated a young 
individual who really had no experience and little knowledge of world events or of a world economy.<br>
<br>
The Taliban is a movement that was born out of a civil war and its leadership has no experience in governing and 
apparently has no plans to modernize -- which, most likely means certain doom, because they would only be stuck in a rut 
and spinning their wheels. The populace would eventually grow inpatient and another civil war would start. Or in order to 
stem an uprising -- the Taliban government would have to become oppressive to maintain control.<br>
<br>
Movements, such as the Taliban, rarely hold together. Internally they are doomed to split. Just like the Kurds.<br>
<br>
&quot;Revolutionary societies are never a source of stability, although they are invariably a source of exaggerated short-term 
hope,&quot; said Anthony Cordesman, who is a well-respected regional security specialist at the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies in Washington.<br>
<br>
The questions will be: If the Taliban can hang on to power and then shift from being a movement to a government? Are 
they tolerant enough to reach out to other ethnic groups in order to establish a program of economic reconstruction?<br>
<br>
The experts say that the odds are not in favor of the Taliban. They appear to not understand that you cannot hide yourself 
from the world and expect to thrive as a society in today's world.<br>
<br>
Momentarily, the Taliban are in power. But it may be just that ... only for a moment.</p>

<title>Is Colombia At War with Itself?</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<p>Excerpted from the ENN Daily Report - 11/06/96 - Vol. 2, No. 311</p>
<p><font size=5><strong>IS COLOMBIA AT WAR WITH ITSELF?</strong></font><br>
<br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
It may not had been a difficult military operation, but it was a successful attack by leftist guerrillas deep inside the jungles of 
southern Colombia. For South America's oldest insurgency, remote and inhospitable places have been the preferred 
launching pad -- easy to strike from, easy to hide in and easy to defend.<br>
<br>
Experts who monitor what goes on in Colombia are now saying that the 30 August defeat of the Colombian army at an 
outpost called Las Delicias could be seen as a defining moment in recent Colombian history. At least 60 soldiers are still 
being held captive. They are called prisoners of war by the rebels. Colombian officials are now acknowledging that the 
one-time minor insurgency has grown now to war against the government.<br>
<br>
This declaration that says the government of Colombia is under attack is a profound shift of policy for the nation. In the 
past two months, almost 200 soldiers, policemen and guerrillas have been killed since the rebel offensive began. There has 
been an insurgency inside of Colombia for the past four decades. But something else is now taking place.<br>
<br>
It has always been difficult to define the exact character of the leftist insurgency inside of Colombia. Like other Latin 
American movements, there have been links to Marxism and Maoism.<br>
<br>
What makes the insurgency in Colombia different is that it began and has thrived under elected civilian governments. While 
in other Latin American countries, these kinds of movements were usually born under military dictatorships. Colombia's 
insurgency has survived the fall of communism and has actually gotten larger and received more support from the populace. 
Today, the guerrilla groups are now more numerous and more powerful than ever.<br>
<br>
On 30 August, 27 attacks were mounted by three different insurgent groups. The largest group and the one that is seen to 
be leading the way is the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The FARC announced that it was launching 
an offensive in the southern part of the country and its intention is to take over the Colombia.<br>
<br>
In response to that threat, the Colombian government proposed a large increase in the military budget and to create mobile 
anti-guerrilla battalions to deal with the rebels.<br>
<br>
Ever since the guerrilla offensive began, the link between the rebels and Colombia's powerful drug traffickers has suddenly 
taken on a whole new and more menacing perspective. It is the contention of President Ernesto Samper and the 
Colombian military that the guerrillas represent a third drug trafficking cartel -- right behind the Cali and Medellin cartels. It 
appears that the United States government may agree with that assessment.<br>
<br>
Recently, the U.S. government awarded $40 million in military aid to Colombia to help combat the rebels.<br>
<br>
All of this points to a perceived prolonged war between the rebels and the armed forces. Even human rights activists in the 
country are now focusing their resources on how to manage a war rather then to promote peace. In other words, everyone 
is beginning to understand and accept the real situation.<br>
<br>
Daniel Garcia-Pena, the coordinator of Colombia's Office for Peace, said, &quot;What we are seeing now is the natural 
escalation of the war. The army has grown, the number of soldiers has grown, the armed confrontation has grown and in 
one way or another, the strategic plans of the guerrillas are part of this. It seems as if war has a better chance than peace ... 
it has sensitized the country. It is no longer a small problem in a remote area. I think, unfortunately, that the country needs 
to see the horrors of war to realize it is at war.&quot;<br>
<br>
Military analysts and experts on guerrilla movements say that there is little chance that the rebels will mount a large-scale 
attack. They don't apparently have the capabilities or the tactical ability. Regardless, however, the rebels are now 
perceived to be manacing the capital of Bogota.<br>
<br>
But we should really get down to brass tacks and analyze what the central question is about what is happening in Colombia 
and why it is happening. Why is there an apparent arms race in country? As the Colombian and U.S. governments see it, 
this is not a war against a simple insurgent opponent that is helping to protect the drug trade -- but the rebels are seen as to 
be benefiting from the drug trade. That means the FARC has a vested interest in seeing that their principal source of 
funding is not interfered with.<br>
<br>
According to Colombian Defense Minister Juan Carlos Esguerra, the guerrilla offensive was a response to the 
government's coca eradication program, which started in May. This program was started because of pressure from the 
United States and Colombia wanted to show the U.S. that is was doing something to stem the flow of cocaine. Regardless 
of the reasons why -- it appears that the Colombian government &quot;touched the pockets&quot; of the rebels.<br>
<br>
Esguerra said, &quot;The problem is very complex. But as far as I am concerned, if you can single out one act that has played a 
decisive role, I have no doubt that it is our frontal offensive against narco-trafficking in the southeast of the country.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not everyone agrees with that assessment.<br>
<br>
One of the foremost authorities on guerrilla movements in Colombia, Alejandro Reyes, says that it is no coincidence that 
the guerrillas are strongest in the areas where people are poor and the government ignores.<br>
<br>
There is one thing that is certain -- there will be no quick-fix to this enormous and complex problem that is growing 
everyday. Can the guerrillas win? Perhaps not today, but they are and can be well financed. The funds are there. They are 
gathering increasing support from the peasants in rural areas.<br>
<br>
The U.S. will continue to insist that Colombia do something about destroying coca crops. This in turn will cause more 
turmoil with the &quot;farmers&quot; in Colombia because they say its the only thing they can grow that makes money. And they don't 
like the Colombian government taking away their way of living. So, in turn, they turn to the guerrillas to do something about 
this.<br>
<br>
It's a vicious circle and the situation is probably going to get worse before it gets better.</p>

<p align=center><b>WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION IN TERRORISM</b></p>
<p align=center><b>The Emerging Threat Posed by Non-State Proliferation</b></p>
<p align=center><b>by</b></p>
<p align=center><b>James K. Campbell</b></p>
<p align=center><b>Commander, U.S. Navy</b></p>
<p align=center><b>27 October 1996</b></p>
<p align=left>To date most informed opinions on non-state political violence suggest that terrorist of the future will neither seek to 
develop, nor threaten to use weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Arguments supporting this position are typically 
presented through a framework of anachronistic assumptions that have been in use since the days of the late nineteenth 
century Russian Nihilist movement. </p>
<p>These assumptions suggest that first, the terrorist groups are nothing more than a collection of frustrated, political actors 
bent on correcting a perceived flaw in the socio-political order of the state. The cause to take up terrorism evolves adjunct 
to their failure or inability to influence objectional political, economic and/or social conditions that define their environment. 
Second, it is assumed that these frustrated actors adopt terrorism as a means to press their political agenda through the use 
of directed and modulated violence. This violence is designed to communicate a complex message that primarily gains the 
terrorist group public recognition for their cause. Unmitigated destruction and violence is not the goal as noted by Brian 
Jenkins who suggests that &quot;terrorists want a lot of people watching, not a lot of people dead.&quot; </p>
<p>A third assumption suggests that terrorists are &quot;mirror imaging rational actors,&quot; e.g., their behavior is normative. As such 
they are subsumed to understand that exceeding a certain violence threshold may result in a globally enjoined effort to 
eradicate them. </p>
<p>Finally it is assumed that the technology and associated costs involved in the development and production of weapons of 
mass destruction are beyond the reach of the non- state group. For these reasons the image of the classical terrorist of the 
twentieth century has not included WMD. However, these traditional arguments have arguably weakened due to the 
changing nature of the terrorist phenomenon. Specifically these changes are emerging in areas related to supply and 
demand variables, variables that certainly influence a non-state group's decision to develop and use WMD. </p>
<p>Supply issues suggest that first, the availability of materials and technical requirements to produce &quot;lo-tech&quot; WMD are well 
within the reach of contemporary non-state groups; second, that many groups have the financial capacity to fund such 
programs; and third, that individuals knowledgeable of WMD technologies are involved with groups that might threaten the 
use of WMD. </p>
<p>Demand issues suggest that ownership and use of WMD by a non-state group provides a powerful negotiating tool, status, 
and power. Thomas Schelling notes that a terrorist organization which achieves a WMD capability ascends to a higher 
position of relative power and prestige. Of note, the absence of territorial boundaries in the case of the non-state group 
serves to make state retaliation difficult as the terrorist become hard to target, a problem that Marrs suggests serves to 
&quot;vitiate the retaliatory threats of the state.&quot; </p>
<p>Third, non-state groups that embrace religious ideologies affiliated with apocalyptic millennialism, redemptive religious 
fanaticism or racist/ethnic hate may not operate according to traditional terrorist logic. In many of these groups, egregious 
acts of an extremely violent nature are viewed as either sanctioned or demanded by God. Where traditional terrorists 
typically operate within certain violence thresholds, those operating under the interpreted direction of the Almighty are 
arguably not subject to the same constraints. Non-state groups operating under the &quot;cloak of religion&quot; might very well be 
the most likely candidates to use the unlimited or disproportionate violence WMD affords. </p>
<p><b>The &quot;Post-Modern Terrorist&quot; or &quot;The Revolution in Terrorist Affairs&quot;</b></p>
<p>Much as scientific, technological, and social changes continually influence the manner and mediums by which artists express 
themselves, so to have these things influenced the behavior and enhanced the capabilities of the terrorist. The attenuation of 
traditional means to ends in recent terrorist acts is evident in the bombing of Pan Am flight 103; the 1993 World Trade 
Center complex bombing; the 1995 Oklahoma Federal Building bombing and Tokyo nerve gas attack; the 1996 Hamas 
bombings in Israel, IRA bombings in London, the Islamic radical bombings in Saudi Arabia, the bombing of a pavilion at 
the Atlanta Olympics, and what appears to be the work of terrorists in the downing of TWA flight 800. These ultra-violent 
acts suggest the days of constrained violence are diminishing. New twists on old ideological imperatives coupled with the 
availability of more lethal weapons and weapon related technologies are rapidly enabling the terrorist to cause maximum 
death and destruction. </p>
<p>Of increasing occurrence is the ultra-violent terrorist act followed by silence. Many times in recent years terrorist acts have 
been committed without a group &quot;stepping forward&quot; to claim credit for the event. Events such as the downing of Pan Am 
flight 103, the Air India flight that crashed off of the Irish coast in 1988, the recent terrorist bombing at the 1996 Olympics 
in Atlanta, all suggest a &quot;shift&quot; in terms of the message the terrorist act is supposed to send. Where traditional terrorists use 
the event to gain access to a &quot;bully-pulpit&quot; to air their grievances, these &quot;silent terrorist&quot; send a silent message creating a 
superordinary sense of overwhelming fear, and vulnerability. </p>
<p>By not claiming responsibility for the event, non-state (or state supported) groups may actually be able to do more damage 
to the selected target. The fact that no one group has stepped forward to claim responsibility for the 1996 Khobar Towers 
bombing has, at a minimum, caused difficulties between the U.S. and her economic allies, heightening tensions between the 
Islamic countries of Libya, Iran, Sudan and Syria vis-a-vis the U.S. This could represent part of a new non-state strategy 
to polarize the Islamic community against the West, while at the same time causing a divisiveness between Western allies. </p>
<p>This change in the characterization of terrorism may be indicative of a new era, one in which the traditional, &quot;constrained,&quot; 
terrorist of the twentieth century is supplanted by the ultra- violent &quot;post-modern terrorist&quot; of the twenty-first century who 
uses advanced technology, and anonymity, to conduct destructive acts traditionally viewed as disproportionate to desired 
ends.</p>
<p><b>Genesis of the &quot;Post Modern Terrorist&quot;</b></p>
<p>Expanding on a general theme discussed recently by Walter Laqueur, the emergence of the &quot;post-modern terrorist&quot; 
appears to have two causes. One may be religious revivalism. Religion has played a part in legitimizing extremes of violence 
throughout history, tendencies that are generally constrained in traditionally (secular-political) oriented, non-state groups. 
Ultra- violent terrorist acts rooted in religious imperatives can be seen in Sri Lanka, where Tamil Hindus are waging a 
bloody terrorist campaign against the Sinhalese Buddhists; in India and Pakistan where Hindus, Sikhs, and Muslim 
extremist groups engage in violent struggles; in Israel, where both radical Palestinian and Israeli movements have caused 
great injury and death in the name of God. The success of Khomeini's 1979 Islamic Revolution has also been viewed as 
enhancing the level of violence in terrorist activities perpetrated by radical Islamists world- wide. </p>
<p>The second cause is arguably related to the removal of constraints imposed by the Cold War, and the subsequent 
disintegration of a bipolar world order. As a result of this disintegration, a new world disorder seems to have emerged in 
which the legitimacy of many states is being challenged from within by increasing non-state calls for self-determination. 
Huntington affirms this trend in a recent essay in which he suggests that the causes of future conflict will be rooted in a clash 
of cultures. He argues that ethnic and religious movements will supplant traditional political ideologies with cultural ones. 
Where these movements cross each other, bloody conflict will erupt. </p>
<p>Prime examples of this phenomenon can already be seen in Algeria, Somalia, Egypt, Sudan, Rwanda, Chechnya, the 
Balkans, Indonesia - and even here in the United States. These movements often prey on the insecurities of the population, 
offering to fill the psychological, sociological, political or religious security needs of those who would join them. Examples 
of such groups have emerged in the form of the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo; the Identity movement in the U.S.; and the 
radical Islamic revivalist movements that exist in a variety of countries.</p>
<p>These religiously oriented groups appear to share a common ideological thread that rejects existing societal structures and 
demand a structural revision of the world in a manner that will ensure their own dominance. To this end, the threat or actual 
use of WMD may be the method by which they believe they can paralyze the state without having to expose themselves. 
Capitalizing on the highly cultivated fear WMD use engenders could permit the non-state group to &quot;snatch&quot; a piece of 
power from the state as it tries to respond to the crises, and manage the consequence of the threatened attack. Thus, 
armed with WMD, the non-state group is enabled to press home an agenda without having to engage in protracted social 
movements or insurgency. </p>
<p><b>Conclusion	</b></p>
<p>WMD use can cause mass casualties and substantial infrastructure disruption, far more than that caused by any previous 
terrorist incident. Since the threat to use WMD affords the non- state group a powerful tool that heretofore has not been 
available to them, non-state proliferation presents a security dilemma that the global community must actively attempt to 
resolve. </p>
<p>Recognizing the WMD threat in general terms, President Clinton signed Executive Order No. 12938 on November 14, 
1994. This order declared a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction pose to the national security, foreign interest, and economy of the United States. On 
November 9, 1995, a continuation of this order was declared by Executive notice. This declared state of a national 
emergency has continued. Despite the existence of a robust, widely supported international regime to control the spread of 
WMD, the consensus of various scholars and policy makers, identifies WMD proliferation as the top security threat our 
Nation faces today. Senator Sam Nunn's address concerning proliferation echoes these sentiments:</p>
<p>The number one security challenge in the United States now and probably for years ahead is to prevent these weapons of 
mass destruction, whether chemical, biological or nuclear, and the scientific knowledge of how to make them, from going 
all over the world to rogue groups, to terrorist groups, to rogue nations.</p>
<p>Raising the specter of this concern, in March of 1995, members of the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo released nerve gas in 
a Tokyo subway, resulting in the death of 12 people and the injury of 5000. Following this horrendous act, Congressional 
hearings on the potential for continued non-state group employment of WMD concluded with the assertion that non-state 
proliferation poses a difficult challenge to our National security primarily because these groups are exceptionally hard to 
target, and much harder to deter, more so than say an identifiable rogue state.</p>
<p>It is intimately clear that when a non-state group such as Aum is able to develop a WMD capability, an endemic failure 
within the international community exists that must certainly be remedied. That failure relates to two significant deficiencies. 
First, our collective, intelligence capabilities to identify such groups early on needs to be improved. As discussed in 
Congressional hearings held in November of 1995, the threat posed by Aum was never even on our intelligence &quot;radar 
screens.&quot; If we are going to beat these &quot;bad guys,&quot; we must fine tune our intelligence apparatus so that we may identify 
these groups, their capabilities and intentions. By doing this we assure ourselves the ability to operate inside the terrorist 
group's &quot;decision making loop.&quot; Operating inside this &quot;loop&quot; will allow us to preempt the terrorist action before it occurs. 
Second, export controls and domestic efforts to restrict the sale of chemical/biological precursors, dual use technology and 
equipment must be strengthened. </p>
<p>Aum has proven that a determined non-state group can amass material, know-how, and equipment to develop and 
threaten the use of WMD. The concern now lies in discerning what the next group will do having learned from Aum's 
mistakes. A robust effort to improve our knowledge of terrorist groups through human and open source intelligence 
gathering, coupled with strengthened efforts to control access to chemical and biological agents, their precursors and duel 
use equipment, will certainly help to minimize the WMD threat posed by these &quot;post-modern-terrorists.&quot; </p>

<font size=5><strong>RUC Warns of Coming Attacks; Anniversary Dates</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
LONDON (ENN) - Security forces in Great Britain have gone on heightened security alert after intelligence has warned 
that a major Irish Republican Army attack is expected before Christmas. Security was being increased in the capital 
London and at military bases. It is believed that the IRA is plotting a spectacular attack, most likely to avenge the killing of 
IRA terrorist Diarmuid O'Neill during an operation that recovered ten tons of explosives last month.<br>
<br>
The outgoing head of the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland, Sir Hugh Annesley, warned on Monday that the 
IRA will probably attempt further bomb attacks before declaring a cease- fire.<br>
<br>
Security at the scheduled opening of the Northern Ireland Parliament today is expected to be very tight.<br>
<br>
British security forces believe that a high-visibility assassination is another possibility. Personal protection surrounding a 
large number of VIPs in Northern Ireland has been increased.<br>
<br>
A spokesperson at Scotland Yard in London said on Tuesday that there was &quot;a continuing campaign of violence by 
terrorist criminals. Despite its recent successful counterterrorism operations, the Metropolitan Police Service is not 
complacent.&quot;<br>
<br>
Security sources in Northern Ireland have confirmed that the RUC and the British Army, along with a detachment from the 
SAS, have been alerted about the threats of additional IRA attacks.<br>
<br>
There are several anniversary dates upcoming that could coincide with an attack or attacks. The date of 7 November will 
be the 22nd anniversary of a bombing in Woolwich, which is located southeast of London, where two people were killed 
and 30 others were wounded in a bombing in a pub near an Army barracks.<br>
<br>
Nine years ago, on 8 November, is the anniversary of an IRA bombing in Enniskillen, where 11 people were killed and 63 
others were wounded.<br>
<br>
An even more significant anniversary date is said to come on 15 November. It will mark the signing of the Anglo-Irish 
Agreement eleven years ago.<br>
<br>
Another important date to the IRA would be 29 November, which is the 22nd anniversary of the introduction of the British 
Prevention of Terrorism Act, which was in response to the 21 November 1974 bombing of a pub in Birmingham in which 
21 people were killed.<br>
<br>
Scotland Yard is said to be very concerned about the possibility of an upcoming IRA attack. A spokesperson stressed, 
&quot;Police and other agencies involved in the counterterrorist effort remain alert and are doing everything they can do to 
minimize the threat.&quot;<br>
<br>
London's Metropolitan Police are regarding the terrorist threat very seriously. Assistant Commissioner David Veness, the 
head of special operations at Scotland Yard, said, &quot;I regret that the threat is likely to be in the long term. Looking at the 
period ahead, we are entering dangerous months.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The potential for an IRA bomb here or in London is obviously great,&quot; said Peter Robinson, an East Belfast MP. He 
warned that the IRA was capable of striking at any time. He added, &quot;It is fairly significant that the IRA quite often in the 
past attached their bombs in London to political events. They have always tried to link it to some political event to give it 
added significance from their point of view. The danger is there.&quot;<br>
<br>
Senior RUC officers in Belfast believe that the ten tons of explosives that were recovered in London last month were 
earmarked to be used in attacks that would have been timed to coincide with the IRS bombing of the British Army's 
headquarters in Northern Ireland earlier this month.</p>

<title>HUMINT Still Most Important in Countering Terrorism</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<p><font size=5><strong>HUMINT (Human Intelligence) STILL MOST IMPORTANT WHEN 
THWARTING TERRORISTS</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
Even though U.S. intelligence agencies have billions upon billions of dollars worth of sophisticated technical equipment at 
their disposal, when it comes to thwarting terrorists -- human operatives are still the most important asset. Spending on 
intelligence in recent years has substantially declined in the past ten years. However, more resources have been directed 
toward to improve &quot;human intelligence&quot; devoted to combat terrorists.<br>
<br>
Senior intelligence officials say that the U.S. has improved its capability against terrorists and the nations that support them. 
One potential terrorist target area of particular concern are terrorists who target airliners. Burton L. Hutchings is an aviation 
security consultant and a former CIA counterterrorism specialist. He said, &quot;The role of the intelligence community is to give 
the tipoff, to alert the FAA, who then passes it on to the aviation community.&quot;<br>
<br>
When Hutchings was employed at the Central Intelligence Agency, he had a direct telephone line to the FAA on his desk. 
Hutchings said that recalls that aviation officials often became frustrated when he attempted to relay potential threats in 
nonspecific terms in order to protect CIA sources and methods. He recalled, &quot;After you've done this three or four times, 
the airline companies would say, 'If you're not going to say anything more specific, we're not going to do anymore 
countermeasures.'&quot;<br>
<br>
The United States has the most sophisticated SIGINT (Signals Intelligence) assets in the world. These assets include spy 
satellites and planes. These assets do aid in the detection of terrorists by intercepting their phone, computer, e-mail, and 
radio communications. However, according to intelligence experts, these technological assets still cannot replace the 
importance of human intelligence assets. Human operatives are still needed to infiltrate and uncover the plans of terrorist 
groups.<br>
<br>
Reportedly, U.S. intelligence has been having some success in their efforts against terrorists. The CIA says that they have 
substantially increased the number of new sources reporting to it on terrorism. ENN will go more in-depth on the CIA's 
counterterrorism center in a few days. CIA Director John Deutch has recently said, &quot;The gain in the past 18 months far 
exceeds previous achievements.&quot; <br>
<br>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is responsible for fighting terrorism within the borders of the United States. The 
Bureau has recently redeployed 500 agents to counterterrorism duty. The CIA and the FBI are now working together to 
combat terrorism. Earlier this year, for the first time ever, CIA station chiefs and FBI legal attaches held meetings to 
discuss terrorism. This is a vast improvement over the days of the infamous bureaucratic rivalries between the two 
agencies.<br>
<br>
More information is also flowing to the FAA and the U.S. Department of Transportation. The information is coming from 
the CIA, the FBI and the U.S. State Department, which is the lead agency on international terrorism.<br>
<br>
It is said that the hijacking of TWA Flight 847, a flight that was diverted from Athens to Beirut in 1985, was the incident 
that caused the U.S. to really get serious about international terrorism. After that hijacking, the CIA created its first 
counterterrorism center in 1986.<br>
<br>
&quot;There have been a lot of potential ... attacks against aircraft that have been thwarted,&quot; said Robert H. Kupperman, who is 
a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and highly regarded expert on terrorism. Kupperman 
added that there have been many U.S. &quot;silent&quot; success stories.<br>
<br>
The job of tracking terrorists and terrorist groups is not becoming easier. Smaller, less organized groups appear to be 
emerging. This makes the job of thwarting terrorists more difficult.<br>
<br>
Former CIA director Robert Gates said, &quot;There is the problem of free-lance terrorists. But the other side of that is, as you 
get groups like that, they also tend to be more amateurish. They do things like take their rental cars back for rebates, drive 
the principal vehicle used in an attack without license plates. They make foolish mistakes that traditional, state- sponsored 
groups would not make.&quot;</p>

<title>Terror Threats Against US/Israel Again Increase</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<p>EmergencyNet News Special Report (<strong>ENN</strong>)<br>
Emergency Response &amp; Research Institute (<strong>ERRI</strong>)<br>
10/13/96 - 12:00CDT<br>
<br>
<font size=5><strong>Increasing Threats of Terrorist Attacks Against the US/Israel Reported<br>
</strong></font><br>
According to the independent SNS news service and several other Mid-East sources, Israeli security officials have 
announced that intelligence information that they have gathered points to an increased likelihood of planned attacks against 
Israeli targets in coming days. According to intelligence officials there, Hamas and other Islamic extremist affiliated 
terrorists in the US, and elsewhere, have been distributing information about threats and potential attacks, via the internet.<br>
<br>
At the same time, similar news of US targets being threatened have reached ENN from the US, the Middle East, and UK 
sources. These threats have come from Hamas, Hizbullah, the radical Islamist Hizb al-Tahrir (Liberation Party) in Jordan, 
and the anti-Saudi/US groups: Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights and &quot;Legion of the martyr Abdullah 
al-Huzaifi,&quot; from both outside and inside of Saudi Arabia.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow marks the one year anniversary, on the Moslem calendar, of the death in Malta of Islamic Jihad terrorist leader, 
Fatchi Shakaki, allegedly at the hands of assasins close to Israeli-backed intelligence operatives. Islamic Jihad is an 
Iranian-backed Palestinian off-shoot organization that was set up when it appeared Hamas was cooperating with the 
Palestinian Authority and was no longer extreme enough for some sponsors in in the Mid-East.<br>
<br>
Security officials in Israel are increasing patrols surrounding what are to be considered sensitive areas and prime targets. 
These targets are thought to include include public transportation facilities, religious sites, and areas of public gathering. 
Security officials say that there have reportedly been specific threats of a large attack scheduled for tomorrow.<br>
<br>
No similar increase in security at any US site has been reported, but U.S. military and intelligence officials are thought to be 
assessing these latest reports of potential terrorist threats. ERRI analysts are urging caution and special alertness during the 
period from now until the U.S. elections in November.<br>

<title>Twin Carbombs Strike Ireland Military Base</title>

<br>
<font size=5><strong>Twin Car Bombs Explode at N. Ireland Base</strong></font><br>
<br>
(Lisburn, N. Ireland) Two car bombs were reportedly driven into the heart of the British Army's headquarters in Northern 
Ireland today and exploded, injuring at least thirty (31) people, including two children. Military sources reported twenty 
soldiers and eleven civilians injured by the twin detonations.<br>
<br>
British Prime Minister Major said there were two bombs, the first of which went off in a parking lot within the perimeter of 
the camp. &quot;The second one went off 10 minutes later near the base medical center. The presumption is that it was there 
either injure or kill doctors and nurses trying to help those injured in the first blast, or to catch those injured coming back 
from the parking lot to the medical center...that is the only explanation.&quot; &quot;The nature of that activity speaks for itself. It was 
wicked beyond belief to have done that.&quot; Mr. Major said it was not yet known who was responsible for the attack but he 
emphatically stated: &quot;If it was Provisional IRA, then clearly it is a very serious development indeed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Six of those caught in the blast were reported severely injured. Three of the most seriously injured are being treated in the 
intensive care unit of Belfast's Royal Victoria hospital. Five others with lesser injuries were taken to other Belfast hospitals. 
They were all initially treated in Lisburn's Lagan Valley hospital where the physician in charge of emergency treatment, Dr. 
Brendan Sinnott, credited his team with excellent medical care and said that the more seriously injured might not have 
survived the journey to Belfast, unless his team had managed to efficiently treat and transfer them.<br>
<br>
According to doctors, a woman in her mid-twenties reportedly suffered a serious penetrating head wound. A young man 
suffered serious chest and abdominal wounds, and an unidentified second man suffered chest injuries. Most of the injuries 
were related to being struck by shrapnel and flying debris. Some internal and head injuries may have been as the result of 
the blastwave. The remainder of the injured reportedly received less serious wounds. An small girl was also treated for 
shock and released.<br>
<br>
Tonight, a major investigation continues into how the bombs, believed to have been made up of between 250kg and 500kg 
of &quot;high order&quot; explosives, were smuggled into the base, breaching what should have been one of N. Ireland's most secure 
military installations. <br>
<br>
<em><strong>Update: 10/08/96 - 12:00CDT</strong></em><br>
<br>
This morning (10/08) a little known Irish Republican group claimed credit for the bombing, but they failed to give a 
recognized codeword. A spokesman for Ireland's semi-state RTE broadcasting network said a caller allegedly 
representing the &quot;Continuity Army Council&quot; (CAC) called shortly before noon and claimed responsibility for Monday's 
Lisburn barracks blast. The caller, however, failed to give a codeword which guerrilla groups, media organizations and 
broadcasting networks use to identify bona-fide bomb claims and bomb warnings. Some experts are discounting the CAC 
claim and think it may be an attempt at misdirection. Regardless of the validity of the call, concerns are being raised 
throughout England and Ireland about the possibilities of another round of violence between Republicans and Protestant 
antagonists.</p>

By Steve Macko, ENN Editor</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES (ENN) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning on Thursday against drinking a mix 
of synthetic drugs that apparently sickened about 50 people at a New Year's Eve concert. The FDA is warning people 
not to consume colored liquid products called: &quot;Orange fX Rush,&quot; &quot;Lemon fX Drop,&quot; and &quot;Cherry fX Bomb.&quot; These 
liquids can cause dizziness, nausea and breathing problems. At least forty people were sickened and four people were 
hospitalized in critical condition after ingesting this mixture at a concert in California.</p>

By Jim Fay, ENN Assoc. Editor</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES (ENN) A dance party attended by thousands of youths to celebrate the New Year, was abruptly 
cancelled when about fifty of the party goers became seriously ill from an unidentified liquid that was distributed. The liquid 
was described as an &quot;orange colored&quot; substance that was given out on the dance floor to the predominately young crowd.<br>
<br>
The organizers of the party described it as an &quot;herbal mixture,&quot; not a drug. However, of the fifty who became sick, at least 
thirty of them were hospitalized for dizziness, nausea, and difficulty breathing, necessitating a large response of EMS 
equipment. Some of the victims were saved at the scene by being resuscitated by paramedics that responded. The LAPD 
was mobilized for riot conditions, when the party was declared over by the organizers, on orders of the LAFD.<br>
<br>
About 10,000 youths were in the streets around the Olympic Auditorium. Police were forced to fire &quot;beanbag&quot;-type 
ammunition at the rioters, when rocks and bottles were being thrown, hitting several helmeted officers. The crowd 
attempted to turn over cars and at least one bus. There were four arrests of those in the disorderly crowd, and another six 
arrested on drug charges.<br>
<br>
The liquid, called &quot;Herbal Ecstasy,&quot; was distributed at the dance by what one partier called &quot;well-dressed men,&quot; who &quot;no 
one expected a scam from.&quot; It came in vials, and was yellow-orange in color. Doctors who treated the youths stated that 
the symptoms that resembled that of designer drugs called &quot;GHB,&quot; &quot;FX,&quot; and &quot;Ecstasy.&quot;</p>

<p>A boy, 16, died on New Year's Day, ten hours after collapsing at an all-night rave at the David Lloyd sports centre at

&quot;I could not wish for a better son. He was likeable, comical, a cheeky little monkey. He would not listen to me if he 
thought he knew best. He was a wonderful son,&quot; his father said. His mother clutched her husband's hand as she overcame 
her choking grief to warn others: &quot;Do not take it. It is lethal. I have lost my youngest son. Please, for my Robert, don't let it 
happen again.&quot; <br>
<br>
The teenager, a trainee computer engineer, went to the L25-a-head rave, which was run for the third year by Interspace 
Promotions, with his brother Matthew, 19, and a teenage friend. He died in Ealing Hospital, west London, where he was 
taken after being treated by paramedics when he collapsed at the sports centre. He was one of four teenage boys<br>
and a 24-year-old woman believed to have died as a result of taking Ecstasy over the holiday. <br>
<br>
Detective Inspector Sue Hill, who is leading the hunt for the supplier of the drug, reiterated the parents' warning. &quot;There is 
only one thing that youngsters should be aware of when you take an Ecstasy tablet: you are playing Russian roulette, and 
one Ecstasy tablet can kill you.&quot; Police had established that the dead boy had taken the tablet with him to the rave. &quot;His 
brother is very traumatised. He is feeling very guilty that his baby brother is dead,&quot; she said. <br>
<br>
The rave was well run. The organisers had employed 36 guards to police the partygoers and make sure that drugs were 
not taken in or sold at the sports centre. &quot;Everthing was done to prevent this, but it is very difficult to search 2,000 
people,&quot; Detective Inspector Hill said. Mr Hitchens spoke with pride about how his son had left school last year with good<br>
examination results and set about finding a job. He would return to the family home in Upminster, Essex, each evening 
talking excitedly about the job he loved and what he had done that day. <br>
<br>
&quot;All parents, look at your children, ask them questions, don't take no for an answer. They will tell you what they want to 
tell you, but be strong and perhaps we can avoid another tragedy like this.&quot; Something must be done to prevent this, but it 
is very difficult to stop.&quot;<br>
<br>
(Editor's note: This excerpt of a London Times article refers to the drug MDMA and probably is not the same mixture as 
the incident in California. But, it had the name and proved fatal...just the same. <a href="/ecstasy.htm"><strong>Click here to see ENN's previous

<p>The primary problem with these drugs is that often the person taking them does not know what they contain, nor how it 
will interact with other (prescription or illicit) drugs they may have taken. Further, the ad-hoc mixtures may also aggravate 
pre-existing medical conditions. Additionally, any capsules or liquid being given away free may be adulterated by 
unsanitary or toxic substances. Taking any kind of unknown drug, being passed around at a concert, is both dangerous 
and foolish. As the saying goes...just say no.<br>

<br>
<font color="#FF0000"><font size=5><strong>Wave of Letter Bombs Strikes Washington Newspaper, Kansas Prison</strong></font></font><br>
by C.L. Staten, ERRI Senior Analyst<br>
<br>
(ENN) Washington, DC -- The FBI has this evening issued a warning about letter bombs, mailed from Alexandria, Egypt, 
and received at the National Press Club building in Washington DC. Seven devices were received at the offices of the 
Al-Hayat, an Arabic newspaper. They were described as being in plain, white envelopes, 5 1/2&quot; X 61/2&quot;, with 
computer-generated addresses, no return address. They were post-marked on or around Dec. 21, 1996 from an Egyptian 
post office. They appeared to be Christmas cards.<br>
<br>
The letter bombs were declared &quot;viable&quot; by FBI and DC police bomb technicians. &quot; They could have gone off...they 
weren't duds,&quot; according to FBI spokesperson Jeff Lanza. Lanza was speaking in reference to two mail bombs received 
at the federal penitentiary at Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas...interestingly, the same prison where Mohammad Salameh, 
convicted World Trade Center bomber, is serving time. The prison devices were addressed to &quot;parole officer,&quot; obviously 
by someone who doesn't know that there are none assigned to federal prisons.<br>
<br>
The FBI warned that additional devices could still be in the mail and cautioned press and government workers to be 
particularly aware of suspicious mail. FBI and U.S. postal inspectors said that the letter bombs did have the capability to 
&quot;take a life&quot; if opened. If similar mail is found by anyone, they should immediately notify their local police department bomb 
squad and not move or attempt to open the parcel. The FBI Terrorism Task Force, who have also been called in on the 
case, can also be notified at 202-252-7001.<br>
<br>
In a related matter, sources close to the Washington investigation say that the devices may be amazing similar to those 
described by Paul Copher in a warning published by ENN in Vol. 2, No. 356, on 12/24/96:<br>
<br>
<em>+++ SECURITY ALERT+++<br>
<br>
&quot;Christmas Cards and Calculators (IEDS)<br>
<br>
By: Paul Copher, ENN Counter-Terrorist Analyst-at-Large<br>
<br>
&quot;The nice Christmas cards that use tiny circuit boards to play music when opened are now being bought and can 
be used to act as the final circuit in the detonation of letter bombs. The device is removed from the card and fixed 
to the letter bomb. The flat DataSheet, Flex-X or even thinly cut and rolled out C-4 can be fitted with a detonator 
and the wiring tied into the musical circuit board. The tiny battery in the board has been found to have enough of 
a charge to fire some detonators. The explosive can then be fitted into a magazine or book. When opened the 
circuit will send the detonator a current of electricity and detonate the blasting cap and explosive.<br>
<br>
The trend of bomb making is going high tech with smaller batteries set ups, mini-circuit boards, detonator types 
and even E cells. One recent find included a solar cell tied into a device that would detonate when exploded to 
interior lights and looked like a hand held calculator. When the panel was exposed to a desk light and the 
calculator turned on it would explode.&quot;<br>
</em><br>
FBI and other federal agents said that they would speculate about the motivation of sending the letter bombs, nor who 
may have been responsible. But, at least one purposely unidentified CT analyst said that it is &quot;likely&quot; that the lethal mail 
could relate to a number of Egyptian and other Mid-East extremists currently serving time in American prisons. 
Additionally, he pointed to an increasing level of angry rhetoric coming form Iran and Syria.<br>
<br>
The investigation continues at this hour, and all mail to the Al-Hayat offices will be inspected by postal inspectors. The 
Federal Bureau of Prisons said that it will also conduct similar surveillance. Other search activities are also being studied 
by counter-terrorist authorities.<br></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><font size=4><strong>ERRI Announces New On-Line Training Facility For Military/Emergency Personnel</strong></font></font><br>
By Paul Anderson, ENN Metro Correspondent<br>
<br>
CHICAGO (ENN) - The Emergency Response &amp; Research Institute (ERRI) today announced the development of a &quot;first 
of it's kind&quot; training program for emergency service and military personnel. The new program will combine ERRI's 
well-known world-wide-web presence with its world renowned editorial advisory board to present new training and 
continuing education opportunities for fire/police/ems/disaster/military personnel. Guest lecturers and international experts 
will also be invited to assist in the presentation of given educational modules.<br>
<br>
According to Clark Staten, ERRI Executive Director, the innovative program is still in its developmental stage, but Staten 
says that he expects at least some of the initial program modules to be on-line and available for review and participation by 
the end of the 1st quarter of 1997. Staten said that the educational offerings will use the World-Wide- Web's multi-media 
capabilities to make the instruction modules both entertaining and easy for responders to use.<br>
<br>
Staten, a retired Asst. Chief paramedic and former training officer, said, &quot;One of the programs greatest assets is that it can 
accessed from anywhere in the world over the Internet, and even members of smaller emergency service departments or 
military units stationed in other countries will be able to receive the most up-to-date training topics in a timely and effective 
manner.&quot; The program might also be most beneficial to those at those working at isolated sites, such as on oil platforms, 
allowing them to participate in relevant and effective training on a laptop or desktop computer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Taken to its ultimate conclusion, both training and pre/post course evaluations could be piped directly into almost any 
location with a modem and computer and continuing education could take place 24 hours a day, 365 days a year,&quot; Staten 
added. &quot;Best of all, emergency and military administrators will be happy to hear that this concept is one the most cost 
effective alternatives that we have found to traditional training methods,&quot; he continued. &quot;Finally, it will also include a unique 
opportunity for volunteers and those that don't get to attend national or international conferences and seminars to interact 
with world-class instructors via e-mail or live in a chat session,&quot; Staten concluded.<br>
<br>
Additional future plans by ERRI also include the use of (optional) related textbooks, lesson plans, drill recommendations, 
reference materials, and the possibility of accreditation that could allow automated tracking and granting of continuing 
education credits. Negotiations are reportedly currently underway with several colleges and traditional accreditation 
agencies, to obtain authorization to grant &quot;certificates of completion&quot; and even CME credits.<br>

<title>NYPD Cop Killed While Moonlighting</title>

<p><font size=4><strong>RANK AND FILE NYPD UPSET OVER &quot;MOONLIGHTING&quot; DEATH</strong></font><br>
By Jim Fay, ENN NYC-NJ Bureau<br>
<br>
NEW YORK CITY (ENN) - The death of a well-respected and well-liked NYPD officer who was working a second job 
(or &quot;moonlighting&quot;) for Christmas expenses, has brought out an angry response from his fellow officers.<br>
<br>
Police Officer Charles Davis' family has also experienced another death since his shooting on Saturday (12/21). His wife's 
father died of an apparent heart attack upon hearing of the death of his son-in-law. He was 73. Also, it is being reported 
that Davis' wife's brother was killed in the line-of-duty as a Federal Police Officer assigned to the Bronx Veteran's Hospital 
eight years ago.<br>
<br>
Fellow officers of Davis in the NYPD are speaking out and asking why it should be necessary for a police officer to work 
a second job, especially one that requires the officer to continue to place his life on the line, to make ends meet.<br>
<br>
Officers are complaining that the present Mayor of NYC has made political hay on the backs of the police officers that the 
Mayor continues to credit for the phenomenal drop in crime in New York. But when contract negotiations come up, the 
city continues to plead poverty at the bargaining table. Officers complain that they haven't had a raise in over two years, 
but the city offers three and four year contracts with little or no raises in the first two years. Mayor Rudolph Guiliani, 
however, in a quote in the NY POST, said that the 35-to-40 hour work week &quot;leaves a lot of time for a second job,&quot; and 
that working two jobs &quot;isn't uncommon...at all levels of salary.&quot;<br>
<br>
NYPD officers are really upset with the recent contract for neighboring Suffolk County officers on Long Island who 
received a five year contract that has top pay at about $73,000. An NYPD officer presently makes about $44,000 after 
five years.<br>
<br>
All the officers quoted in the NYC media complain that situations such as Davis' would not have to happen if the officers 
were paid a substantial wage, and could live off of their police salaries. But the &quot;moonlighting&quot; situation is not unique to 
NYC. Earlier this year, ENN reported on an off-duty Teaneck, NJ, officer that was killed while working part-time in a 
security capacity at a Sears store in Hackensack, NJ. That officer was transporting receipts from the main store to an 
office when he was ambushed by robbers.<br>
<br>
Part-time security work for police officers has become a important part of the income some officers depend on throughout 
the US. In fact, many departments make the part-time arrangements for the officers, and some even offer it as part of the 
hiring package when a new recruit comes on the job. But, whether walking around a mall or a store with (or without) your 
police uniform is a good policy, or even appropriate, is a question that also comes up. It is apparently easier and cheaper 
for an agency chief to allow his officers to work security on their days off, than to increase the officers pay to ensure an 
adequate home life.<br>
<br>
Ironically, Officer Davis' assignment with the NYPD was with the Manhattan Warrant Squad. These officers go looking for 
wanted criminals, and every encounter has a very high danger level. Yet it was at an escort while opening a check cashing 
store while working part-time security that Davis life was lost.<br>
<br>
The funeral for officer Davis will be a joint funeral, also including the funeral for is father-in-law. Davis has a four year 
daughter.<br>

<title>The Battle Over Chem/Bio Funding &amp; Training</title>

<font size=5><strong>Officials Say We're Not Ready; Training Battles Ensue</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Managing Editor<br>
<br>
(ENN) Montgomery County, MD -- According to Chief LeRoy Oettinger of the Montgomery County, MD fire 
department, &quot;a whole bunch of firemen and policemen are going to die in that first hour.&quot; Further, Oettinger is quoted by 
the Associated Press as saying, &quot;They'll want to help, but we're ill-equipped, at the local level, to do anything.&quot; Oettinger is 
talking about a potential emergency service response to a chemical or biological attack on the United States.<br>
<br>
The Washington-area Council of Governments has reportedly been working on a joint response plan to a chemical attack, 
hoping to establish a model program in the D.C. area, that could then be used to develop plans for other municipalities. So 
far, however, Oettinger and others say that &quot;we are not prepared.&quot;<br>
<br>
One of the major problems, according to the experts, involves funding of training and equipment for local fire, police, and 
EMS agencies. Reports from Washington say that between $40-65 million dollars is supposedly in the federal pipeline to 
be distributed to agencies in the nation's 150 largest cities. But, little or nothing of consequence has, so far, come flowing 
out the other end, according to Clark Staten of the Emergency Response &amp; Research Institute.<br>
<br>
Staten, who has been studying and reporting on the emergency response to terrorism for more than 10 years, says that 
another problem associated with the funding process is that there are currently several organizations that would like to take 
control of who gets what training funds and how. &quot;Both fire service and police organizations have publicly stated that they 
believe that they should be the 'lead agency' to write a curriculum and develop and present training programs,&quot; Staten told 
ENN today in an exclusive interview.<br>
<br>
&quot;Secondarily, it would appear that EMTs and paramedics, who would certainly be called upon to provide advanced 
medical care for the victims of chemical or biological exposure, have almost been completely left out of the planning and 
financing process,&quot; the retired Asst. Chief Paramedic added. &quot;It is already becoming a political and economic 'football' in 
some circles...with emergency and government agencies, professional organizations, unions, and corporate entities all 
scrambling for their piece of the pie,&quot; Staten added.<br>
<br>
&quot;The time has come for a 'super committee' of the best and brightest people, from all public and private sectors, to come 
together and get this funding, training, and equipment to the people who really need it...the men and women out there 'on 
the street', who are really protecting our communities and will be faced with the danger when it comes,&quot; the veteran 
emergency planner said.<br>
<br>
Finally, Staten strongly recommended that representatives of all facets of the police, fire, EMS, disaster, and military 
community must come together to work to develop efficient plans and assure the rapid and effective implementation of 
training programs. After all, Staten concluded, &quot;When (not if) some 'wacko' decides to release a chemical or biological 
weapon into one of our cities...everyone is going to have to work together to solve the problem, or we'll have a disaster 
within the disaster...and a whole lot of people are going to die unnecessarily.&quot;</p>

<title>Military/Police Spousal Abuse Law - No Guns</title>

<p><font size=5><strong>FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS OWNERSHIP, POSSESSION, OF 
GUNS AFTER CONVICTION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
MISDEMEANOR-- COPS, AGENTS, MILITARY, NOT EXEMPTED</strong></font><br>
<br>
By Jim Fay ENN Associate Editor<br>
<br>
In a little discussed amendment to a Federal appropriations bill, the United States Congress has passed a law that prohibits 
the ownership and possession of firearms by anyone convicted of a domestic violence crime, either felony or misdemeanor. 
However, nowhere in the law is there an exemption of police officers, federal agents, or even the military. This may cause a 
long-range ripple affect on criminal justice and defense operations.<br>
<br>
The law, originally entitled, &quot;H.R. 3756 - Treasury, Postal Service, and Government Appropriations Act, 1997,&quot; has been 
amended in the US Senate by US Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), with the assistance of Congressman (and US 
Senator- elect) Robert Torricelli (D-NJ), to include changes to various federal firearms laws to prohibit firearms in the<br>
possession of people convicted of domestic violence laws throughout the country. The law makes no exceptions or 
exemption.<br>
<br>
In addition, the law is retroactive to include all previous convictions for domestic violence.<br>
<br>
The law went into effect on September 30, and includes a wide range and obscure appropriations and amendments, 
including one involving a committee investigating the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, over thirty years ago.<br>
<br>
On November 26th, according to the Associated Press, a letter was transmitted to all law enforcement agencies from the 
Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, John Magaw, stating that all enforcement officers that have 
been convicted of domestic violence crimes, &quot;must immediately dispose of all firearms and ammunition in their possession.&quot; 
Also, the Department of Justice has ordered their enforcement agencies, which includes the FBI and the United States<br>
Marshal's Service, to have their agents that have agency-issued firearms, and have been convicted of domestic violence, to 
turn in their weapons to their supervisors.<br>
<br>
The affect this will have on the day-to-day operations of police agencies on all levels of government may be more that 
expected. Small agencies may have more than just one officer that was convicted of such crimes. These officers, although 
otherwise able to perform police work, will now be relegated to &quot;light-duty&quot; clerical positions, or, may, in fact, be 
terminated. A department with 12 officers, with two or three officers with domestic violence convictions over a period of 
time, will have almost 30% of the department out of service for just this one issue.<br>
<br>
Unlike sick leave, in which an officer is expected to return to full duty eventually, or light duty, prior to retirement due to 
illness or injury, there is no anticipated return to duty, or future use of the officer's position for a new hire, with these 
convictions. While a felony conviction prevents anyone from possessing a firearm automatically, misdemeanor convictions 
generally do not. Under this new federal law, all that is needed is a misdemeanor conviction for domestic violence to 
prohibit possession of a gun.<br>
<br>
One police officer told ENN that, prior to this most recent federal law, one department in the NYC area was forced to 
send a Department lawyer to a State Supreme Court to advise the Court that so many officers were restricted from 
carrying firearms due to Restraining Orders from accusing spouses and girlfriends, that it made the Department ineffective. 
The Department was able to convince the Court that it would be appropriate to have the officers carry weapons while on 
duty only, and turn them in at the end of their tour. Under the new federal law, even this is impossible.<br>
<br>
The Pentagon is also reportedly stymied by this new law, and is seeking the assistance of the Justice Department on how to 
initiate enforcement of it, according to the AP.<br>
<br>
The federal law will have at least two possible affects that were not anticipated by the sponsors of the legislation: one, a 
police agency (and the US military) will have an interest in every domestic violence case that involves one of their officers, 
since it will have long range affect on the agency and that officer, and, two, a spouse may just have second thoughts about 
reporting the incident, knowing the outcome of the report will put the officer/batterer in a definite position of being 
terminated from his or her job, upon the conviction for even a minor argument.<br>
<br>
It appears unlikely that any legislative changes will take place with this law in the near future.<br>

<font size=5><strong>EUROTUNNEL EMERGENCY DRILL CALLED A &quot;CHARADE&quot;<br>
</strong></font>By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
Chicago, IL, December 6, 1996 (ENN) -- A &quot;full-scale emergency drill&quot; that was staged last Sunday by the operators of 
the Channel Tunnel, that runs between England and France, has been called &quot;a meaningless charade&quot; by some members of 
the British Parliament and experts in emergency response. <br>
<br>
The Channel Tunnel runs underneath the English Channel between Great Britain and France. The drill was an attempt to 
convince safety officials that it was safe to re-open the tunnel after a serious fire on a truck destroyed a freight shuttle train 
and heavily damaged a section of the tunnel on 18 November. And apparently, the ploy worked, because the Eurotunnel 
was re-opened on Wednesday.<br>
<br>
&quot;It (The safety authority) is now satisfied that the necessary safety equipment is available and that revised operating and<br>
emergency procedures are in place,&quot; said Eddie Ryder, who is the head of the British delegation for the Channel Tunnel 
Safety Authority.<br>
<br>
One member of the British Parliament accused the operators of the tunnel of putting profits before safety and said that the<br>
exercise did little to convince the public that the tunnel was safe. The complaint against the drill was that fire, EMS and<br>
police crews did not take part in the exercise that tested evacuation procedures.<br>
<br>
British MP Roger Gale said, &quot;I would regard any exercise taking place with the approval and participation of the Kent Fire<br>
Brigade as satisfactory, but any other exercise as meaningless.&quot; The simulation took place at the same position as the 
recent fire. About 700 people were evacuated through the service tunnel which runs between the two railway tracks that 
run in the Eurotunnel.<br>
<br>
&quot;It seems to me that it is something of a charade,&quot; said Gale. &quot;The conditions are wholly unrealistic. They are saying they 
are going to practice their safety procedures, but without fire or the emergency services. They know exactly what is going 
to happen. The problem two weeks ago was that people were evacuated, but they were lying on the floor choking.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;It's ludicrous if they think that they can hold a legitimate emergency drill without the participation of the fire and EMS<br>
services,&quot; said Clark Staten, the executive director of the Chicago-based Emergency Response and Research Institute. 
Staten is a retired Asst. Chief Paramedic with the Chicago Fire Department, Bureau of Emergency Medical Services. <br>
This Spring, he helped run a plane bombing disaster drill for Fire/Police/EMS responders in the Atlanta area, in anticipation<br>
of the Summer Olympic Games. Staten is an acknowledged expert in the field of disaster response and emergency 
preparedness, and is in constant demand to speak at various seminars and symposiums on the subject. He also correctly 
predicted the possibility of a bombing attack at the Olympic Games, prior to their start.<br>
<br>
Staten said that he was astonished to hear how the emergency drill in the Eurotunnel was conducted. &quot;It's shameful,&quot; he<br>
said. &quot;Without the fire or EMS service, the drill is meaningless. The whole episode sounds political or someone is<br>
putting profits before lives.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Eurotunnel are just desperate to re-open the tunnel and seem to be putting that before a through investigation of the fire,&quot;<br>
added Roger Gale. &quot;It is all very well wanting to re-open the tunnel, but if it is done too quickly nobody will want to travel<br>
on it for fear of the same thing happening again with more serious consequences.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Kent Fire Brigade and the Kent Police were not saying much about their exclusion from the drill. A Fire Brigade 
spokesman would only say, &quot;We were aware of the exercise, but we did not take part.&quot; &quot;The exercise was to test 
evacuation procedures and to show the safety authority how those will work,&quot; said a Eurotunnel spokesperson. &quot;The 
emergency services are not involved in that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Staten scoffed at that statement. &quot;How can they say that with a straight face?&quot; he asked. &quot;You just can't hold a effective<br>
emergency drill without the participation of the emergency services.&quot;<br>
<br>
Another Eurotunnel spokesperson reported that the safety exercise had gone &quot;satisfactory.&quot;<br>
<br>
All of the 700 people taking part in the drill were evacuated successfully from the tunnel within two hours and ten minutes.<br>
That was said to be only five minutes over the target evacuation time of 125 minutes.<br>
<br>
The Emergency Response and Research Institute is trying to look into the security of the Eurotunnel, so far without much<br>
success. A main concern is that the tunnel would be an attractive target for terrorists. This is particularly true in the face of 
current threats from the IRA in England and the GIA in France. If the tunnel authorities are not taking the matter of fire and 
life safety seriously -- are they not taking the matter of terrorism and security seriously, also? We're not sure.<br>

<font size=4><strong>FDNY REESTABLISHES PARAMEDIC RESPONSE VEHICLES </strong></font><br>
By Jim Fay ENN NYC-NJ Bureau<br>
<br>
The New York City Fire Department unveiled its new Advanced Life Support Patrol/Response Unit at Elmhurst Hospital 
in Queens, NY, on Monday, November 25.<br>
<br>
The unit is a &quot;Blazer&quot;-type vehicle, equipped with all advanced life support equipment. It will not carry patients. This first 
unit is assigned to Elmhurst Hospital, and will have an initial response area of the FDNY's 46 Battalion area. It will be 
manned by one paramedic and one paramedic supervisor.<br>
<br>
When the Paramedic program started in NYC in the early 1970's, the units were also manned by two EMS paramedics, 
and did not carry patients. This changed in time with the overwhelming responses and workload of EMS at that time, and 
eventually, paramedic units were assigned regular ambulance vehicles and transported as required. However, this takes 
away from the uniqueness of the paramedic operation, and makes the paramedic unit &quot;just another ambulance,&quot; as one 
EMS professional stated. Now, with the take over of NYC*EMS by the FDNY, there has been a return to the original 
concept of paramedic response.<br>
<br>
When Howard Safir, now NYPD Commissioner, was the Fire Commissioner, it was planned that the FDNY*EMS would 
be quartered in already built fire houses, or other FD buildings. With the establishment of the &quot;APRU,&quot; it appears that EMS 
personnel will be continued to be headquartered in in hospitals, as they originally were prior to the merger with the FD.<br>

<font size=4><strong>MALE ARRESTED FOR TRYING TO DUMP HAZARDOUS MATERIAL</strong></font> <br>
By Jim Fay ENN NYC-NJ Bureau<br>
<br>
A man who attempted to illegally discard two plastic bottles which contained a highly toxic substance into a NYC 
Sanitation truck, was arrested in The Bronx on Monday.<br>
<br>
The NYPD reports that, at about 1450 hrs., on Monday, an unidentified male approached a NYC Department of 
Sanitation truck that was on a recycling pickup route in front of the address of 943 East 221 Street, near Bronxwood 
Avenue. The male attempted to throw the bottles into the back of the truck, but was stopped by the sanitation workers. 
The workers spotted the bottle labels, which stated &quot;hydroflouric acid&quot; on them. After telling the unidentified male the 
proper method of disposing of the chemicals, the sanitation workers continued on their route.<br>
<br>
The male initially left, but as the truck got farther down the street, he allegedly ran up to the back of the truck and threw the 
suspicious bottles in. The sanitation workers had someone call '911,' while they attempted to locate the offender.<br>
<br>
In addition to the NYPD, the NYC Sanitation Department Police also responded to the scene. P.O. Minutolo of the 
Sanitation Police placed the individual under arrest for various environmental law violations, and reckless endangerment.<br>
<br>
Less then two weeks ago, NYC Sanitation Worker Michael Hanly, 51, was killed when a bottle of hydroflouric acid 
exploded in the back of his sanitation truck during a routine pickup. The acid severely burnt Hanly's face, and he died from 
inhaling the fumes.</p>

<title>Nurse Shot in Gang Attack At DC Hospital</title>

<font size=5><strong>Nurse Shot in Hospital Incident</strong></font><br>
By C.L. Staten, ERRI Analyst<br>
<br>
(ENN) Washington, DC -- Both a nurse and a gunshot victim he was trying to help were shot Saturday night, as they tried 
to bring the victim into the emergency room at the Hadley Memorial Hospital in Southeast Washington. According to 
police reports, when the victim was brought to the emergency room door by witnesses to his shooting, a male nurse came 
out to help and was attempting to load him on a hospital gurney.<br>
<br>
As he did so, another vehicle, possibly containing the original suspect in the shooting, pulled up and fired several additional 
shots at the good Samaritan and the victim. The nurse was struck in the legs and the original victim was again struck several 
times in the torso. The suspect successfully escaped the scene without apprehension. No firm motive for the shooting has 
been established.<br>
<br>
Hospital security experts say that this sad scenario is more familiar than one might imagine, and that the level of violence in 
and around hospital emergency facilities continues to rise on a yearly basis. One security guard, at Cook County Hospital 
in Chicago, told ENN that it is common for them to be called upon to try to stop &quot;gang retaliation&quot; attacks in the 
emergency room, and that rivals have even tried to break into the restricted Trauma Center area to finish their deadly 
work. Publicized attacks on hospital personnel in Southern California have also further pointed out the need for expanded 
security measures.<br>
<br>
ERRI analysts strongly recommend that all hospital security personnel assess the potential for gang-related violence and 
establish procedures for isolating victims from potential threats.</p>

<p><font size=4><strong>NYC SANITATION WORKER KILLED BY HAZARDOUS MATERIAL</strong></font><br>
By Jim Fay, ENN NYC-NJ Bureau<br>
<br>
NEW YORK CITY (ENN) - NYPD Homicide detectives, assisted by Department of Environmental Protection agents 
and NYC Department of Sanitation Police, are investigating the death of a 23-year veteran NYC Sanitation worker, who 
was killed when he unknowingly handled a severely hazardous acid.<br>
<br>
On Tuesday, November 13, Sanitation worker Michael Hanly, 49, was on his route with his partner, Thomas Giammarino, 
when Hanly picked up an unmarked plastic bag that, on the surface, did not appear unusual. However, when Hanly tossed 
the bag into the truck hopper, it exploded from the crush. Unknown to Hanly and Giammarino was that, inside the bag, 
was a container marked with a skull and crossbones, containing Hydrofluric Acid. The explosion hit Hanly directly in his 
face and splattered on to Giammario.<br>
<br>
Across the street from the incident, which occurred at New Utrecht Avenue at 84th Street in Brooklyn, was the 
headquarters of the Bensonhurst Volunteer Ambulance Corps. Members of the ambulance corps tried to neutralize the 
sever burning of the acid on Hanly face by spray him with a garden hose. Hanly and Giammarino were rushed to New 
York Hospital Burn Unit in Manhattan, where he died from the inhalation of the fumes. Giammario remains in the hospital 
with facial and hand burns. Hanly's facial injuries were so severe that his wife was prevented from seeing him in the 
hospital.<br>
<br>
Hydrofloric acid is used in cleaning the fronts of buildings and etching in glass, and is highly caustic and toxic. Auto body 
shops also use hydrofloric acid in small quantities, and the Bensonhurst area of Brooklyn has many of these shops.<br>
<br>
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani responded to the hospital, and later at a press conference stated that the container was one gallon 
in size and the hydrofloric acid was 70 percent pure. Kings County (Brooklyn) District Attorney Charles J. Hynes stated 
that the perpetrators of this crime will be subject to murder and related charges for improperly disposing of toxic materials.</p>

<title>Visualization; Virtual Reality Training </title>

<p><font size=5><strong>Visualization; Virtual Reality Training For the Future ...</strong></font><br>
By Paul Anderson, ENN Metro Correspondent<br>
<br>
The following brief story appeared in the November,1996 edition of the Reader's Digest, on page14:<br>
<br>
&quot;I was stationed at Sheppard Air Force Base in Texas, when I was told I would have to qualify to use a .38-caliber pistol. 
Having only held a gun on two other occasions I was apprehensive. When I fired my first shot, the loud bang and gun's 
kick startled me so much I almost dropped the pistol. Worst of all, in my panic I forgot to keep the gun pointed down 
range and drew a stern reprimand from my sergeant.<br>
<br>
When I retrieved my targets, however, I was amazed to see that I had qualified with flying colors. The sergeant looked at 
my scores with disbelief and commented that he had been certain that I would fail. Smiling, I held up my index finger and 
thumb in a mock gun position and said one word that explained it all; 'Nintendo'.&quot; - - Contributed to Reader's Digest by 
Peggy Alston<br>
<br>
At first glance, this anecdote appears to be just another humorous addition to the &quot;Humor in Uniform&quot; section of the 
magazine. But, it also points out that there may be more than one way to learn marksmanship and other skills that may be 
needed in a military/crisis environment.<br>
<br>
Experiments are reportedly underway at several military research centers and private institutes to explore the use of virtual 
reality and 3-D computer programs in the training of military and emergency services personnel. The idea is not new, as 
extremely realistic flight simulators have been in use by the U.S. Air Force and commercial airlines for several years. But, 
extending this concept to multi-layered ground combat and disaster scenarios is something that has only been investigated 
in recent years.<br>
<br>
Recently, reports have surfaced of a U.S. Marine Corp experiment with a&#127; modified version of the popular game &quot;Doom&quot;, 
that allows troops to interact and practice fairly realistic small unit tactics and fireteam drills without any danger to them. It 
would appear to be a safe and cost effective training alternative for CQB (Close Quarter Battle) and urban/guerilla warfare 
tactics.<br>
<br>
Sun MicroSystems and other computer simulator makers are also said to have developed workstations that allow 
company, battalion, brigade, and even division level officers to practice large unit engagement techniques in realistic virtual 
circumstances. These computer developments allow combat commanding officers to develop interactive skills that are 
useful in practicing modern &quot;Air-Land-Battle&quot; doctrine, that is need on today's extremely fluid battlefield environment.<br>
<br>
On the emergency service side of the training simulation business, companies like the Emergency Response &amp; Research 
Institute (ERRI) have been advocating the possibility of using virtual reality systems to allow paramedics to practice 
treatment protocols on virtual patients, firefighters to burn and fight fires in virtual buildings, and police officers learn street 
survival skills and arrest virtual criminals. Additionally, ERRI thinks that it would be an efficient and cost effective way for 
multiple emergency agencies to participate in mock disaster scenarios over a network. And, all without danger to either 
citizens or the emergency responders.<br>
<br>
One of the biggest problems in both the military and emergency services is to expose &quot;rookie&quot; responders or low-ranking 
soldiers/sailors/airmen to enough &quot;experiences&quot; to allow them to function effectively in a crisis or combat situation. 
Historically, many injuries and even deaths occur in both training and in their first few months or even years on the job. It is 
believed by ERRI and others that by using realistic virtual reality training that this &quot;experience quotient&quot; can be rapidly 
increased and unnecessary casualties prevented. Additionally, the quality of emergency service that is provided to the 
public can be bettered while interagency cooperation and communication improves.<br>
<br>
By the use of computer networks, it would even be possible for military and civilian emergency agencies to &quot;virtually&quot; work 
and drill together, as might prove necessary in the event of a terrorist attack, chemical/biological release, or other large 
scale disaster situation. &quot;The possibilities of this concept are endless...for improving our national response capabilities and 
facilitating effective and more realistic training for those that protect us on a daily basis,&quot; according to Clark Staten, ERRI 
executive Director.<br>
<br>
Staten says that he can see a transference of simulation capability and technology from an already developed military 
capability to the civilian emergency response sector and that closer cooperation between the two is both needed and 
inevitable in the coming century.</p>

<font size=5><strong>Rioting Breaks Out After Traffic-Stop Shooting</strong></font><br>
By: Clark Staten, Analyst<br>
<br>
(ENN) In what is being described as &quot;major rioting,&quot; crowds in South St. Petersburg, Florida are reportedly setting fires, 
overturning cars, and throwing rocks tonight. The unrest reportedly started shortly after 17:30p.m. (5:30p.m.)EDT, when 
police shot a black motorist who had allegedly tried to run over an officer with his car. <br>
<br>
According to a police spokesperson, &quot;We have a major riot here...we've got a lot of police injured and many cars 
damaged.&quot; Police tell ENN that it started with localized unrest on only one or two blocks, but that it then quickly spread 
and may now involved sporadic looting and arsons over a large area.<br>
<br>
The Cable News Network (CNN) has reported, in the past few minutes, that several people have been injured, many of 
them police officers. Some firefighters may have been hurt as well; reportedly, they were attacked as they tried to fight a 
fire that may have been deliberately set. Several suspicious fires have been reported in the past hour in the affected area.<br>
<br>
At least one police car and a TV satellite truck from WTOG-TV were reportedly both torched and completely destroyed. 
A videographer was injured by flying glass in the melee. According to WTOG, the rioters then quickly turned to looting 
nearby businesses, as arson fires burned in others. <br>
<br>
An unidentified police spokesperson, at 21:45CDT told ENN that they had the situation &quot;contained,&quot; but that they had sent 
additional units to the scene to &quot;get the situation under control.&quot; St. Petersburg media sources say that the disturbance 
continues at this hour.<br>
<br>
ENN will continue to follow developments and provide additional details as they become available.<br>

<font size=5><strong>THE BURNING OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA</strong></font>.<br>
By Paul Anderson, ENN Metro Correspondent<br>
<br>
MALIBU, CALIFORNIA (ENN) - In what some authorities are calling the most destructive fires in Southern California in 
more than a decade, an army of tired firefighters on Tuesday battled several wildfires that have destroyed more than 100 
homes. More than 35,000 acres have been reported burned. The infamous Santa Ana winds continued to drive the flames.<br>
<br>
One wildfire, that has been burning since Monday, has scorched more than 14,000 acres across the Santa Monica 
Mountains and has destroyed at least six homes. Firefighters were being assisted by water-dropping planes and 
helicopters, but most of the major blazes remained burning out of control on Tuesday.<br>
<br>
California Governor Pete Wilson declared a state of emergency in San Diego, Orange and Los Angeles counties.<br>
<br>
Some of the most destructive fires have been in San Diego County. A raging widlfire, there, destroyed at least 98 homes in 
the towns of Carlsbad and San Marcos. The blaze has consumed about 6,000 acres.<br>
<br>
United States Marine Corps personnel from nearby Camp Pendleton were said to be assisting firefighters in their efforts.<br>
<br>
Overnight on Tuesday, another major wildfire sprang up in the Otay Mountains located southeast of San Diego. This fire 
reportedly burned about 9,000 acres.<br>
<br>
The major focal point of the massive firefighting effort on Tuesday was near the community of Malibu. A two-mile wide 
wall of flame was said to have swept across the Santa Monica Mountains. Los Angeles Fire Department captains Steve 
Valenzuela said that the fire was about 20 percent contained on Tuesday.<br>
<br>
About 2,500 firefighters were battling the blaze with the assistance of tanker planes and helicopters. So far, five people 
have been injured, including one firefighter whose rig crashed into another fire rig on a winding mountain road.<br>
<br>
Six firefighters were badly burned on Tuesday when they were caught in a flare-up in Malibu Canyon. A 52-year-old 
firefighter was reported to be in critical condition with burns over 70 percent of his body. Doctors in Sherman Oaks said 
that he may not survive his injuries. Another firefighter susptained burns on over 25 percent of his body and was reported 
to be in fair condition.<br>

<font size=5><strong>79 Killed, More than 150 Injured in Guatemala City Soccer Disaster</strong></font><br>
By: Clark Staten, Analyst<br>
<br>
(ENN) The first fifteen firefighters that responded to a reported collapse at a soccer stadium this evening in Guatemala 
City, Guatemala were immediately overwhelmed by the magnitude of the incident unfolding before them. Literally hundreds 
were found lying on stadium infield, or still in a tunnel leading into an already overpacked stadium.<br>
<br>
Victims were described as being &quot;blue or purple&quot; when found by rescuers, apparently suffering fromn a lack of oxygen and 
crushing injuries. Bystanders were seen giving Cardio-Pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to several victims, in an attempt to 
save them. According to on-scene reports, at least 79 people have died and another 150 have been injured. Some are 
believed to have died of suffocation and others as the result of physical trauma. The death toll may rise.<br>
<br>
A local radio report is blaming the tragedy on an &quot;over-selling of tickets&quot; for the World Cup play-off match between 
Guatemala and Costa Rico, that was taking place at the Mateo Flores Stadium. Others said that fans without tickets may 
have &quot;rushed the stadium&quot;, in an attempt to gain entrance. According to government reports, the stadium may have 
contained 11,000 more than it's 45.000 capacity. Either way, something went terribly wrong and many paid the price by 
losing their lives.<br>
<br>
Guatemalan President Alvaro Arzu told fans and the press that he was &quot;deeply pained&quot; by the disaster and that he would 
suspend the game and was declaring a three day period of national mourning. Rescue operations there continued at the 
time of this report. Stadium officials promised that an investigation would be undertaken to ascertain the the cause of the 
tragedy.<br>

<title>Westchester County Gets SWAT Equipment</title>

<p><font size=4><strong>WESTCHESTER COUNTY POLICE INCREASES POLICE HARDWARE </strong></font><br>
By Jim Fay NYC-NJ Metro Correspondent<br>
<br>
On March 21 of this year, a young police officer from the Westchester County town of Eastchester, just north of New 
York City, was killed, and two of his brother officers were pinned down and injured, by a sniper who held the team at bay 
for over one hour in the street. The time delay was primarily caused by the fact that the local and county police had to wait 
for the arrival of an NYPD heavy-duty armored vehicle to be dispatched a long way from Floyd Bennett Field in 
Brooklyn.<br>
<br>
Police insider in and around Westchester County talked openly about the fact that such equipment was not maintained by 
the County, whose demographics goes from extreme rich to some of the highest crime areas in NY state, outside of NYC. <br>
<br>
The County has reacted, and on September 24th, Westchester County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke unveiled a new 
light armored vehicle to be used by the police in just the situations that occurred in Eastchester. O'Rourke also said that the 
unit, manufactured my General Motors, would also be used for natural disasters, such as snow storms and flooding, where 
traditional police vehicles would not work.<br>
<br>
The vehicle is 21 feet long, with a curb weight of over 12 tons. It can move at a land speed of 62 mph, with a &quot;swim 
speed&quot; of six miles per hour. The unit can carry one driver, one unit commander, and 8 others. It is equipped with eight 
periscopes and two night vision units.<br>
<br>
In addition to the armored truck, O'Rourke also announced several new police resources for Westchester County: a new 
helicopter, a mobile communications unit, a Special Response Team specializing in SWAT operations, a bomb robot and 
disposal unit, as well as a new police boat.<br>
<br>
The Eastchester incident (see ENN 02-082 part 1, March 22, 1996) took many police departments in Westchester by 
surprise. The bucolic town was caught off guard by the immediate need of highly trained and equipped officers to take 
command of the situation. It was reported to ENN at the time that the Yonkers Police Department Emergency Service 
Unit was training in Yonkers, not far from the Eastchester incident. But when the officers found out about the level of the 
incident, they were told not to respond because they &quot;weren't asked.&quot; Immediate command was taken over by the New 
Rochelle Police Commissioner, who is a retired NYPD Emergency Service Chief, who ordered the New Rochelle Police 
Emergency Unit to respond.</p>

<title>A Visit to a Queen's Emergency Room</title>

<p><font size=5><strong>A VISIT TO A QUEENS EMERGENCY ROOM</strong></font> <br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
The future of cash-strapped public hospitals such as Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, New York, are under siege. Many 
public hospitals in the United States are beset by budget cuts and layoff of staff.<br>
<br>
New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani would like to turn Elmhurst Hospital over to private hands. What would happen after 
that nobody really knows. But until, and if, that happens the doctors in the emergency room at Elmhurst at committed to 
treating all who need care at anytime.<br>
<br>
Doctor Stuart Kessler, the director of Elmhurst's Emergency Room says that saying the emergency room is &quot;quiet&quot; is bad 
luck. He said, &quot;You'll jinx yourself. Apparently as soon as you say that, six patients come in -- two with gunshots, two with 
heart attacks, two in cardiac arrest.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Emergency Room at Elmhurst Hospital sees about 120,000 patients a year. That averages out to about 329 people a 
day. Kessler explained, &quot;Emergency room physicians never really know what's going to happen. We could see only a few 
patients in an hour or two, but then ten or twelve come within the next ten or fifteen minutes.&quot; The medical emergencies can 
range from multiple trauma to heart attacks to strokes to broken bones, allergic reactions and births.<br>
<br>
Kessler said that emergency room doctors have to make &quot;life-and- death decisions quickly with less information than the 
average physician would have.&quot;<br>
<br>
As we will see, a typical night at the Elmhurst Emergency Room is full of confrontations, bleeding people and even death.<br>
<br>
A middle-aged man is brought into the emergency room. The end of one of his fingers has been chopped off. He lies on the 
gurney with his eyes clamped shut and his teeth clenched. A pool of blood can be seen at the ragged end of right index 
finger as he points it up into the air. A doctor leans over it with black thread. It will take about twenty stitches to close the 
wound. A nurse explains that the man said that he was closing his shop for the night when he slammed the sliding door on 
his finger. Unfortunately, the finger was cut off near the tip. That's where the blood vessels are very small -- replacement of 
the tip is impossible. The doctor says that if more of the finger had been cut off, it may have been possible to sew it back 
on.<br>
<br>
An unresponsive elderly woman is wheeled into the emergency room. Within seconds, a team of eight medical personnel 
descend upon her. The team is guided by Doctor Neill Oster, who stands at the base of the stretcher. He calls out his 
orders urgently and steadily. A rubber strip is twisted around the woman's bicep, a nurse attempts to find a vein in her 
forearm. On her other arm, a blood pressure cuff is affixed. Six wire leads are attached to her chest that go to a heart 
monitor.<br>
<br>
One nurse says, &quot;A lot of resistance, a lot of resistance.&quot; The nurse is trying to squeeze air into the woman's lungs. A 
doctor comes to begin to work an intubator tube into her.<br>
<br>
Another doctor says, &quot;She's about as sick as they come. Her lungs are full of junk and her bloodstream is infected.&quot; The 
woman's eyes are watery and stern and beginning to fade.<br>
<br>
Blood is drawn with a needle. The woman's hands begin to shake. A nurse pierces the side of her throat to start an IV line. 
The intubator tube is too deep. The doctors attempt to pull it above the bifurcation of her bronchi. The woman's feet 
shudder, her shoulders lunge ipward and she begins to gasp as though she was retching.<br>
<br>
At the side of the room, the doctors look an X-ray of the woman's chest. She has a pacemaker located near her shoulder. 
There's not much more the doctors can do for the woman. Doctor Oster prepares to call the woman's brother. On a table 
is a letter from the woman, that reads, &quot;I do not want to be put on any life-preserving equipment.&quot; The note is properly 
signed by the woman and two witnesses. Should she go into cardiac arrest, no extraordinary methods will be used to keep 
her alive. And that's what happened to her less than 24 hours later.<br>
<br>
A white-haired man walks into the emergency room and stands beside the stretcher where his brother lies. His brother has 
a gash on his face. The man on the stretcher notices who is standing next to him and yells, &quot;Get him out of here!&quot; Doctors 
rush over to the two men. One doctor tries to calm the patient and another escorts the visitor to the waiting room.<br>
<br>
The man on the stretcher has blood running along his eye and on his cheek. He says that his four brothers punched him 
because he was cursing. In the waiting room, two of his brothers are awaiting word about their sibling. They tell the doctor 
that their brother is on psychiatric medicine and when he doesn't take his medication, he turns wild. he was injured as his 
brothers tried to subdue him.<br>
<br>
Doctor Ralph Finger sits beside a man on a stretcher and lifts the man's bloody head up. Finger feels around the bloody 
gash at the back of the man's head. The human scalp is more rugged than most people think. This man's head looks like 
he's working a hole in a pair jeans. Finger declares, &quot;He's got a hole in his head, basically.&quot;<br>
<br>
The brother of the injured patient says that the man was drunk, tripped and fell. Blood has drenched the victim's hair and 
the gauze that was placed on his head. Blood drips to the floor. There is blood on the man's shoulders, chest and elbows. 
Finger asks the patient what happened. The man replies, &quot;Nada.&quot;<br>
<br>
Finally, an elderly Korean woman who appears to be quite angry is brought into the emergency room. Fire is coming from 
her eyes. Next to her is a friend who is leaning on a cane and listening with some unease. The elderly Korean woman 
points at a Korean doctor and speaks in her native tongue. The woman is not happy.<br>
<br>
It is explained that the woman called an ambulance because her friend was complaining of knee pain. Since it was not 
considered to be a very serious medical emergency, the two woman had to wair four hours to see a doctor. After the 
doctor examined the woman's knees, she was told that she needed to see a rhematologist. That's when the Korean woman 
lost her temper.<br>
<br>
Later, the doctor explained, &quot;Some people use the ER as a clinic.&quot; Many people, mostly new immigrants use the 
emergency room as a means of access to the medical system. They often complain of non-emergency problems, such as 
coughs, low-grade fevers and other irritations. The problems occur when too many people show up to be treated for colds 
at the same time as five patients from an auto accident, the doctor concluded. </p>

<br>
<font size=5><strong>Bureau of Justice Statistics Says Crime Down 9%</strong></font><br>
By: ENN News Team<br>
<br>
WASHINGTON (ENN) - The United States government reported on Tuesday that the number of violent crimes in the 
U.S. dropped more than nine percent in 1995, continuing a downward trend that started in 1994. U.S. Attorney General 
Janet Reno said, &quot;We have moved from gridlock to solutions that work.&quot;<br>
<br>
According to the preliminary estimates by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, there were almost 9.9 million violent crimes in 
1995. That was one million less than were committed in 1994. The final report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics is 
scheduled to be out next spring.<br>
<br>
The report indicated the following as compared to 1994:<br>
<br>
<img src="/blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Rape was down nearly 18 percent from 432,700 to 354,670.<br>
<img src="/blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Robbery decreased by 14 percent from 1.3 million to 1.1 million.<br>
<img src="/blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Assault fell 8 percent from 9.1 million to 8.4 million.<br>
<img src="/blutrngl.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Aggravated assaults declined 24 percent from 678,500 to 516,500.<br>
<br>
The number of property crimes also fell 5.6 percent in 1995. There were 29.3 million property crimes, 1.7 million less than 
there was in 1994.<br>
<br>
Criminologists gave a number of reasons for the continuing decline in crime. Among the most popular theories were a 
rather good economy and an aging population. Jack Levin, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston, said, &quot;The 
baby boomers have matured into their 30s and 40s. They are mellowing out, perhaps aging gracefully and they are 
graduating out of high risk violence and property crimes into white collar crimes, fraud and embezzlement.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Right now we are at the point where there aren't a lot of people in the crime-prone years, 16-24,&quot; said James Fife, a 
criminal justice professor at Temple University. &quot;But we can expect in the next ten years crime rates will increase 
significantly,&quot; he warned. Fife noted, &quot;The better the economy, the less violent we are.&quot;<br>
<br>
Many criminolgists consider the survey by the Bureau of Justice Statistics to be a very reliable indicator of crime in the 
United States. That's because the survey also includes crimes that were not reported to the police. It is believed that only 
40 percent of all crimes are reported to the police.</p>

<font size=5><strong>NYC Hostage/Barricade Situation Ends in Bloodbath</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
NEW YORK CITY (ENN) - A tense and dramatic standoff between New York City police and a gunman ended in a 
bloodbath in Brooklyn on Monday morning. The attacker killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend, wounded three people and then 
turned the gun on himself before an NYPD Emergency Services Unit tactical team stormed the apartment.<br>
<br>
The dead gunman was identified as James Parker, age 27. He held police to a standoff for about three hours. During that 
time, he sporadically fired shots inside of the second floor apartment, where he held ten people hostage. Parker was a 
fugitive with a long criminal record that dates back to 1988. In the past he had been arrested for: assault, illegal weapons, 
burglary and dealing in drugs. Parker was armed with a six-shot .38-caliber Titan revolver.<br>
<br>
Also killed was Parker's 17-year-old ex-girlfriend who was seven- months pregnant. She was shot twice in the head. 
Doctors at Kings County Hospital Center were unable to save the woman's fetus.<br>
<br>
Wounded in the incident was the 54 -year-old grandmother of the dead woman. She was reported to be in critical 
condition with a gunshot wound to the face. Another woman was shot in the leg and a 26-year-old man was shot in the 
chest. He was reported to be in serious condition. The other six hostages inside of the apartment, including three young 
children, did not suffer serious injuries.<br>
<br>
The situation began at about 0500 EDT, when Parker broke into the building located at 4305 10th Avenue in Brooklyn. 
Police were not notified that there was any trouble until about 0749 EDT. A woman called 911 to tell police of the hostage 
situation. When police arrived, they heard shots being fired. A short time later, a women threw a bloody T-shirt out of a 
window.<br>
<br>
At about 1000 EDT, more shots were heard. A woman at a window told police that two people had been wounded. A 
few minutes later, an irate Parker threatened to shoot all of the hostages unless police left. At another point, he threatened 
to shoot someone else if police negotiators called on the phone again.<br>
<br>
NYPD First Deputy Commissioner Tosano Simonetti said, &quot;At 10:05, we hear some more shots being fired. It's right after 
the third volley of shots from inside the apartment that we believe the young lady who is the girlfriend of Parker is 
screaming out, 'You must get in here because he's going to kill everybody. At that point, the on-sire commander made a 
decision to make an entry into the apartment.&quot;<br>
<br>
NYPD Chief of the Department Louis Anemone was the on-site commander. He was the one that gave officers the order 
to storm the apartment. Anemone said, &quot;Had we not made entry then, he probably would have shot more people. These 
are difficult decisions. Usually we wait. We've found in hostage situations that time pays. We were going to negotiate.&quot;<br>
<br>
At 1020 EDT, five percussion grenades were dropped from the roof into the apartment. A five-man ESU tactical team 
forced the front door of the apartment, which was barricaded with furniture. As police were breaking in, Parker shot his 
ex-girlfriend and then shot himself in the head.<br>
<br>
The following is an NYPD log of the incident that was furnished to ENN:<br>

<p>EmergencyNet News Instant Update<br>
09/14/96 - 03:09CDT</p>
<p><font size=5><strong>First PersonReport; Fire at the Houston Astrodome</strong></font></p>
<p>At this time (03:09CDT), The Houston Fire Department is on the scene of a reported fire at The Houston Astrodome. At 
approx, 02:35 hours or close to that time, firefighters responded to the Astrodome and found smoke comming from the 
South Entrance. Firefighters first on the scene have setup up a command post located in the South parking lot and are 
fighting the fire at this time. There are very heavy smoke conditions, andthe firefighters are using fans setup inside to try to 
remove smoke. Smoke is solid from the roof level down, halfway to the lower half of the building line. <br>
<br>
The well-known dome is a very large building, used for football games and other large public events. It covers a very large 
area and when filled with smoke, removal could be a major problem. Additionally, the building is a closed structure which 
makes venilation difficult. </p>
<p>The fire inside has been knocked down, and now firefighters are hampered by heavy smoke conditions at this time. On the 
initial dispatch the fire department dispatched a heavy box assignment and called some additional units.<br>
<br>
Smoke is banking down inside the domed stadium to the floor levels, and fire fighters are trying to find a way to remove the 
smoke from the dome. Some smoke and water damage is expected and it is uncertain if the building will be immediately 
inhabitable.<br>

<br>
PHILADELPHIA (ENN) - A Philadelphia Police officer was shot and wounded during a shootout with two suspects on 
Wednesday afternoon. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Neal said that Sergeant John Fleming, age 55, was shot 
once in the shoulder after he attempted to stop a suspicious auto in Philadelphia's Roxborough section at about 1300 EDT.<br>
<br>
The Commissioner said that a gun battle followed a vehicle pursuit that ended when the suspects car crashed into a pickup 
truck. One of the offenders in the auto attempted to flee and was shot and wounded after trading shots with Sergeant 
Fleming. The second suspect surrendered.<br>
<br>
Sergeant Fleming was reported to be in good condition at an area hospital. The 23-year-old offender, who was wounded,

<font size=5><strong>Rioting in Mississippi Jail</strong></font><br>
<br>
NATCHEZ, MISSISSIPPI (ENN) - An uprising at the Adams County Jail was brought to an end when a 35-man 
Mississippi Highway Patrol tactical unit used CS gas to subdue two dozen rioting inmates on Wednesday. Authorities said 
no hostages were involved in the incident.<br>
<br>
The jail houses about 140 inmates. Adams County Sheriff Tommy Ferrell said, &quot;We were at maximum capacity and the 
overcrowding, plus not having enough people to supervise that many inmates, led to the problem.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Sheriff said that the inmates refused to return to their cells after lunch. They reportedly used metal tables and 
mattresses to barricade themselves behind a door at one end of the second floor cell block. Deputies attempted to 
negotiate a settlement to the standoff and later used high-pressure hoses and pepper gas to force the inmates to return to 
their cells.<br>
<br>
Sheriff Ferrell said that the inmates made a number of demands. Ferrell said, &quot;Just typcial inmate complaint stuff.&quot; The 
inmates wanted exercise equipment, telephones and television sets.<br></p>

<font size=5><strong>New Generation of Drug Merchants</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
BOGOTA (ENN) - Colombia's anti-narcotics chief Colonel Leonardo Gallego has said that a new generation of drug 
traffickers is emerging in Colombia with the increasing production and export of heroin. Gallego recently said, &quot;There are 
indications of an emergent trend of new groups becoming involved in the heroin trade.&quot; He added that he did not rule out 
&quot;existing groups combining or switching the traffic of one substance with another.&quot;<br>
<br>
New statistics that were released last week indicated that 62 percent of the heroin that is now showing up on U.S. streets 
is now coming from South America, a good chunk of it from Colombia. What this now means is that Colombia, and to a 
lesser extent Peru and Venezuela, are now replacing Southeast Asia as the major source of heroin. It is well known, of 
course, that South America already dominates the cocaine market.<br>
<br>
It is the opinion of Gallego that the new U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration estimates are too high. He, however, 
agreed that there is an emerging pattern that is disconcerting. Gallego, who has been the head of the anti-narcotics division 
of Colombia's National Police for the past two years, believes that Colombia produces about five tons of heroin a year.<br>
<br>
Colombian anti-narcotics intelligence indicates that about 12,000 acres in Colombia are being used to grow opium 
poppies. It is being grown in the traditional coffee growing regions in the provinces of Tolima, Huila and Cauca.<br>
It is known that Pakistanis and Afghans have traveled to Colombia to teach processing techniques and cultivation.<br>
A DEA report that was released last week said that the South American heroin that is being found on the streets in the 
northeast portion of the United States is 30 percent more pure that the traditional Asian varieties.<br>
<br>
U.S. drug experts say that even though members of the Cali drug cartel have been sent to jail, they are still running their 
operations from behind bars. According to Gallego, there are signs that the Colombian cartels are diversifying their supply 
routes away from the United States.<br>
<br>
Unconfirmed intelligence reports are saying that cocaine is being transported from Colombia to Angola. It is then shipped 
to Europe and the Far East.<br>

<title>Israeli Fire Destroys 40 Homes; Investigation</title>

<br>
<font size=5><strong>Israeli Fire Destroys 40 Homes; Allegations of Poor Response</strong></font></p>
<p>SNS Special Report:<br>
<br>
On Friday, September 6, 1996, a large fire broke out in the Jerusalem Corridor, affecting the Communities of Kiryat 
Anavim, Maale HaChamisha, Mevasseret Tzion and Har Hadar. The Fire Department once again was cited for its failures. 
It allegedly responded too late, with too little manpower and equipment, permitting the fire to get out of hand. The blaze 
took hours to get under control. Some forty homes were destroyed and 13 persons treated for smoke inhalation. IDF 
helicopters were called in to assist in controlling the blaze, which was once again under-estimated by Israel's failing Fire 
Service.</p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>Damage Report</strong></font><br>
<br>
-- 2,000 dunams of land destroyed.<br>
<br>
-- In Kibbutz Kiryat Anavim, 15 homes were destroyed and 10 buildings damaged.<br>
<br>
-- In Bet Nekufa, several factories and livestock farms partially or totally damaged.<br>
<br>
-- 300 persons were evacuated from the area.<br>
<br>
-- 16 persons were injured. 13 suffered smoke inhalation and 3 were injured in a car accident that took place due to poor 
visibility in the area.<br>
</p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>Time Table of Friday's Events -</strong></font>- 09/06/96<br>
<br>
12:00pm - It is believed that children in the Abu Gosh area are burning small piles of refuse. It is an unusually hot and dry 
day. Suddenly, strong western winds carried the flames and spread the fire to other nearby brush and buildings.<br>
<br>
12:39pm - According to Commander Monos, the first call for Fire Department assistance comes in.<br>
<br>
12:45pm - The first fire vehicles arrive, according to Monos. (This contradicts all eyewitnesses on the scene, who state the 
trucks were delayed for over 30 minutes until the first unit responds).<br>
<br>
1:00pm - Police and other Emergency Services are activated. Jerusalem Police Department District Commander Amit is 
notified. The flames reach Kibbutz Kiryat Anavim. Many kibbutz residents are evacuated to the guest house of Moshav 
Shoresh.<br>
<br>
2:30pm - Two IDF Yassur helicopters, along with three light planes arrive to assist with the effort from the sky. The flames 
have already spread to Moshav Bet Nekufa. Additional fire units arrive from all nearby areas.<br>
(Note: The IDF Spokesman states the call for helicopters was received at 1:24pm. The two Yassur helicopters were on 
the scene in 60 minutes. By 4:00pm, there were 5 Yassur helicopters operating at the scene. They continued operating at 
the scene until 7:30pm, under very difficult flight conditions.)<br>
<br>
3:00pm - The flames have now spread over an area of 2,500 dunams (625 acres). Dr. Sachs, of JNF looks on in despair. 
He states, &quot;It will take years to replace this great loss.&quot;<br>
<br>
4:00pm - The choking smoke reaches Jerusalem. Police decide to evacuate the residents of two more areas, including 
northern Mevasseret Tzion.<br>
<br>
6:00pm - The fire is declared under control.</p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>Some of the main questions being by the public and media include:</strong></font><br>
<br>
-- Why didn't sufficient Fire Department manpower arrive at the scene during the first few critical moments of the fire?<br>
<br>
-- Why did the first responding unit take 40 minutes to arrive at the scene?<br>
<br>
-- After an upgraded report, why were only 2 more units dispatched? It was already understood that it was &quot;a very large 
fire?&quot;<br>
<br>
-- Did IDF helicopters arrive on time?<br>
<br>
-- Why doesn't the nation's Fire Service have its own helicopters?<br>
<br>
-- Why did Jerusalem Fire Officials permit only four pieces of equipment to respond? (They were the closest stations).<br>
<br>
-- Why was most of the work of controlling the blaze left to the Bet Shemesh Stations which are not equipped to handle 
such a fire?<br>
<br>
-- Why were the recommendations of the Lapidot Commission not implemented?<br>
<br>
-- Why were only 100 additional firefighters added to the department when 250 were recommended?<br>
</p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>Boards of Inquiry</strong></font><br>
<br>
Four separate Boards of Inquiry will be established to investigate Friday's fire, which destroyed about 2,000 dunams (500 
acres) of land. Prior to the findings of the Boards of inquiry, certain facts on the ground have already been established.<br>
<br>
Minister of Internal Security Avigdor Kahalani stated, &quot;If we are unable to take control of such a fire, something is 
drastically wrong. Someone is not doing their job. The entire Service must be investigated. We cannot afford a fire like this 
every year.&quot;<br>
<br>
Another first, Uri Monos, the Commander of the National Fire Service was quoted as saying, &quot;We should have responded 
with a larger initial force to contain the situation. The first minutes of such a fire are critical and I am not going to accept the 
performance of the Fire Officials who made the decisions.&quot; Monos admits that the Shift Commander used poor judgment 
in his decision to dispatch too few units to the scene.<br>
</p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>Senior Fire Official Promises</strong></font><br>
<br>
Commander Monos promises to spearhead an investigation into the most recent Fire Department failure. Monos stated 
that he too, was informed of the fire too late and initially, he was unaware of the magnitude of the blaze. Despite this, he 
immediately ordered additional units from the Jerusalem District to be dispatched to the fire. Monos stated he also made 
immediate contact with the Air Force to place choppers on standby.<br>
</p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>Unidentified Official Speaks</strong></font><br>
<br>
Another unnamed Senior Fire Department Official stated, &quot;It was a major error only dispatching 4 pieces of equipment 
from the Jerusalem District. There are tens of units available. Most of the work to contain the blaze was delegated to the 
Bet Shemesh District, which has a total of 8 pieces of equipment and 46 firemen. They are under-equipped and were 
unable to get to the source of such a fire. How were they entrusted with controlling the blaze?&quot;<br>
<br>
Note: The Bet Shemesh Fire District, with its 8 trucks and 46 men, are responsible for 1 million dunams of land (250,000 
acres) which includes 55 communities, 50,000 residents and thousands of livestock breeding centers. Some of the 
equipment dates back to the 1960s.<br></p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>History</strong></font><br>
<br>
Bet Shemesh is reportedly slated to receive two new fire trucks, but they have not arrived. NIS 20 million ($6.25 million) 
has reportedly been allocated by the government to improve fire equipment and opertional needs. Commander Monos 
statesthat the new trucks will be in operation, &quot;In the very near future.&quot; Following the July 1995 fire, in which 
tens-of-thousands of dunams were destroyed (SNS Update 528 - July 2, 1995), former Prime Minister Yitzchak Rabin 
appointed a Governmental Board of Inquiry headed by Maj.-Gen. (Res.) Amos Lapidot. In short, the Lapidot Report was 
very critical of the nation's failing Fire Service.</p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>The Lapidot Commission</strong></font><br>
<br>
The Lapidot Government- Appointed Board of Inquiry, was entrusted to investigate the large Jerusalem Corridor Fire 
which took place in the Summer of 1995. The Commission requested the immediate hiring of 250 new firefighters. To 
date, only 100 were hired and many of them were never certified as firefighters.<br>
<br>
Five new Fire Stations were to be set up in the Bet Shemesh area. To date, not even one was opened.<br>
<br>
It was also recommended to purchase and integrate into the system 50 new fire vehicles. To date, not even one was 
brought into the system. Commander Monos stated that the procedure of purchasing and receiving such large pieces of 
equipment takes one year. He explains that in the coming year, 13 new units will be brought into the system.<br>
<br>
NIS 4 million was to be designated towards the purchase of equipment to fight large fires from the air. It was decided to 
refurbish existing equipment, rather than purchase new helicopters. The possibility of purchasing used planes from France, 
that are designed for firefighting, is also reportedly being considered. These planes will cost approximately $1 million per 
plane.<br>
</p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>Denials</strong></font><br>
<br>
Fire Department Commander Monos denies that his Service has not learned a lesson from past performances. He 
explained that the recommendations of the Lapidot Commission are being integrated into the system... but that it takes 
time. In addition, he stated the Fire Service is not being allocated the budget which would permit the implementation of 
some of the Commission's recommendations. This will reportedly be investigated by at least one of the four Boards of 
Inquiry being established at this time.<br>
</p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>What Went Down</strong></font><br>
<br>
-- The Fire Service investigated the fire scene. It will present its findings to the Minister of the Interior this morning.<br>
<br>
-- Following his receiving the report, the Minister will be appointing his own board to investigate Friday's failure.<br>
<br>
-- The Environmental Ministry will also appoint a Board of Inquiry.<br>
<br>
-- Dr. Menachem Sachs of the Jewish National Fund Forestry Department will also investigate the fire.<br></p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>Fire Service On the Offensive</strong></font><br>
<br>
Senior Fire Department Officials lashed out at the Ministry of the Interior, Finance Ministry and the government. They 
explained that after every serious blaze, committees are appointed to investigate and recommendations are made. The Fire 
Department was never given the proper increases in its operational budget to implement the changes recommended.<br>

<p><font size=4><strong>ERRI Analysis:</strong></font> <br>
By: Clark Staten and Steve Macko<br>
<br>
The above article is a special report that was published by the SNS News Service in Israel on Sunday.(09/08/96). This 
highly in-depth report asks some very tough questions regarding the status of Israel's fire service.<br>
<br>
As people who has studied and participated in the fire service for twenty years, and who has looked at fire operations in 
virtually every part of the U.S., we would, if given the courtesy of comment, make the following recommedations: <br>
<br>
One, if the government of Israel is truly serious about improving the level of the fire service, We would suggest that that 
they consider bring in an outside consultant(s). Many jurisdictions or countries would probably reply, &quot;We can do it 
ourselves.&quot; But from the reports that we have seen -- they may really need some outside opinions, here. Fresh, outside, 
and qualified opinions might prove most useful in improving the fire service in Israel.<br>
<br>
Two, Since Israel has experienced two very serious fires, of a terrible magnitude, in the past two years. There is every 
indication that it could happen again. We might suggest that they seriously consider implementing a wildfire response plan 
similar to that used in the Los Angeles county area. When conditions are favorable for brush fires, the fire departments in 
the Los Angeles responds with a VERY heavy initial response, to any kind of a bona-fide report of fire.<br>
<br>
As is indicated in the aforementioned report, the fire department in the Jerusalem area did not respond with a large enough 
response and the fire, essentially, got away from them. Because the fire department is smaller and units are separated even 
further in Israel, than they are in the Los Angeles area, it would seem even more important that a heavy initial response be 
sent to the scene of a reported fire.<br>
<br>
Third, we also might suggest that the government of Israel look at the overall emergency response plan that is used by the 
State of Delaware. We believe that they would be able to get some ideas from that plan that might be of great assistance. 
The geographic area of coverage is similar and certainly some of the ideas transferable. If there is a very large fire in any 
part of the state, fire units from every part of the state are moved up to assist. Israel could consider such a program for its 
own use.<br>
<br>
In closing, it is believed that there are any number of fire service experts from the United States who would be happy to 
provide valuable assistance to our Israeli allies, should they be invited to help to review the Bet Shemesh fire and offer 
suggestions for the future. We, at ERRI, would be honored to help to facilitate a fire service commission to help to study 
the issues involved and offer positive suggestions that might prove useful in future fire situations, such as occurred on 
Friday.<br>

<font size=5><strong>Initial Damage Reports - Hurricane Fran</strong></font><br>
By Paul Anderson, ENN Metro Correspondent<br>
<br>
WILMINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA (ENN) - Hurricane Fran was downgraded to a tropical storm/depression on 
Friday morning after it slammed into North Carolina, killing at least 11 people before it lost a great deal of its power. The 
storm dumped tons of rain after it came ashore near Cape Fear. It was said that between 10 and 15 inches of rain fell 
along the path of the storm. The worst rain may be yet to come because forecasters expect as much as 20 inches or more 
of rain will fall in the mountainous regions of West Virginia and Pennsylvania.<br>
<br>
At 0500 EDT, Fran was located about 25 miles north-northwest of Raleigh, North Carolina. The storm left widespread 
damage in its wake. When Fran came ashore on Thursday night, winds of up to 115 MPH were reported.<br>
<br>
At least 11 storm-related deaths were reported, almost all of them involved a vehicle of some kind.<br>
<br>
-- Near Conway, South Carolina, a 66-year-old woman was killed when her car hit some standing water and then crashed 
into a tree.<br>
<br>
-- A tree fell on a trailer home killing an 18-year-old female.<br>
<br>
-- In Durham, North Carolina, a volunteer firefighter was killed when a tree fell on his truck while responding to an 
emergency call.<br>
<br>
-- The other deaths were also traffic-related and two other people were killed when trees fell on their homes.<br>
<br>
The death toll was expected to rise after daybreak. Early reports of damage caused by the storm included a toppled 
church steeple and the loss of roofs off of two motels. Early helicopter surveys indicate that many homes and business have 
suffered wind and water damage, but that early evacuations may have saved many lives.<br>
<br>
Concerns are being raised in-land about the storm spawning tornados and the inevitability of heavy rain and flash floods, 
associated with the storm. Additional damage is possible as Tropical Depression Fran moves North and West. </p>

<p>ENN Instant Update - NY Terror Trial <br>
09/05/96 - 13:20CDT<br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000"><font size=5><strong>Ramsi Yousef Found Guilty on All Counts</strong></font></font><br>
<br>
(ENN) An announcement has just been made in New York City that alleged terrorist Ramsi Yousef and two 
co-conspirators have been found guilty of plotting to carry out attacks on US airliners. Yousef and his team were charged 
with planning attacks on 11 American flights between the Phillipines, Japan, and the United States. Sentencing has not been 
determined, but will be the subject of additional deliberations by the New York jury. Yousef and the others face at least a 
life sentence for acts of terrorism.<br>
<br>
ENN continues to monitor developments regarding the is case and will provide updates as more becomes available. It is 
also likely that this conviction will further increase terrorism threat levels, as concerns of retaliation by Yousef sympathizers 
are considered.<br>

<H2>Major Earthquake Devastates Osaka, Kobe</H2>
<P>

Chicago, IL, January 16 -- At least four hundred and thirty
(430) people have been killed and more than eleven-hundred
(1,100) people have been injured as a 7.2 magnitude earthquake
roared through Central Japan at 05:46a.m. (local time).
Particularly hard hit are the cities of Kobe and Osaka.  Reports
of numerous building collapses and fires burning out of control,
are being recieved. Water and gas mains are reported broken, and
several major highways have also collapsed, hindering the
movement of rescue services.
<P>
As many as five-hundred (500)people have been reported trapped
in collapsed apartment buildings and local fire/rescue services
say that they have been "overwhelmed" by requests for
assistance. Fire units are said to be running from fire to fire,
but can't keep up with rapidly spreading conflagrations in
Japan's largely 'wood and paper" buildings. Fire codes are
particularly stringent in Japan, but even strict regulation
can't control the fires that have been started by this quake.
<P>
Although spokespersons for most rescue services are unavailable
for comment at the time of this report, an unidentified fire
captain who spoke briefly to ENN, said that fire and rescue
units are being sent from several other places in Japan, to
assist in the rescue efforts. He said that fire units are being
hampered by the collapse of several freeways that normally would
be used to respond to fires.
<P>
As with most earthquakes, the magnitude of this disaster is just
beginning to be understood. Rescues will be on-going for at
least the next seventy-two hours, or until everyone is rescued
and all of the buildings have been searched. Protracted rescue
operations can be expected.
<P>
<HR>
Revised as of 0000hrs. CST 01/17/95
<BR>
<P>
Update on Kobe/Osaka Earthquake; National police forces are
confirming the deaths of 430 people and injuries to more than
1,100 more.  Unconfirmed. reports say that more than 550 others
are missing feared trapped. Extensive rescue efforts are said to
be continuing and the Japanese Defense Force has been mobilized
and is responding.  Major fires are still burning out of control
in several areas, and firefighters are described as
"overwhelmed".  Water supply problems are being reported and
often associated with the inability to fight fires, in some
neighborhoods. An unnamed ambulance official said he feared the
death toll would continue to rise much higher.

<H3>Kobe Quake Rescues; People Still Alive</H3>
<BR>

Chicago, IL, January 18, 1995 -- The magnitude of the disaster in the
<BR>
Kobe/Osaka area is just being understood.
<BR> 

Latest statistical reports:
<BR>
* 2,943 confirmed dead 
<BR>
* 14,672 injured
<BR>
* 870 still missing/trapped
<BR>
* 70,000+ people evacuated
<BR>
* More than 10,000 structures collapsed
<BR>
* 400,000 people w/o phone lines, water lines, and electricity
<BR>
* Quake estimated as 7.2 on Open-ended Richter scale
<BR>
<P>
Rescue efforts in Kobe continue to come under criticism by the
local press and citizens. The English language Japan Times is
reporting "woeful inadequacies" in the response of disaster and
rescue service organizations.  Numerous local and international
commentators are lamenting a "lack of supplies and preparations"
by governmental agencies.  Thousands are reported to be either
still trapped in collapsed buildings, or huddled by campfires
without food or water.
<P>
As rescue convoys attempt to flood into the stricken areas, they
are often slowed or stopped by massive traffic jams that have
continually prevented the timely movement of fire equipment and
ambulances. Travel is described as difficult, at best, on the
few roads that are not blocked by the rubble of collapsed
buildings. Within the past twelve hours, helicopters have begun
to be seen hovering over the devastated neighborhoods. They are
reported to be delivering food and blankets to a number of
make-shift relief centers throughout Kobe.
<P>
Fire/Ambulance/Military rescuers are still combing through the
remains of quake-battered structures, hoping to find survivors,
and on several occasions they have been rewarded by finding
people alive. Many civilians are also reported to be digging
through the rubble with their bare hands, in an effort to find
lost loved ones. Although rescue prospects do diminish with
time, U.S. rescue experts say that, statistically and
historically, people have been found alive for more than
seventy-two (72) hours following earthquakes/ building
collapses.
<P> 
Clark Staten, Executive Director of the Chicago-based Emergency
Response & Research Institute, said, "In Mexico City, Armenia,
and other major earthquakes, rescuers often find people alive
for days after the initial shockwave." "Statistically speaking
there is an increase in the number found alive at approximately
72 hours into the incident", the veteran paramedic continued.
"People are often trapped in voids, created as the parts of the
structures catch and support other parts of the collapse", he
added. "The rescue efforts in Japan, as in several other
disasters, have been heroic...and they should not be terminated
until it can be determined that no more people remain
entrapped." Staten added.
<P> 
"At approximately forty-eight (48) hours into any major
disaster, it is common for local emergency services personnel to
become totally exhausted and unable to continue with their
work", he continued. "If they are not already on the scene, or
enroute, now is an appropriate time for international emergency
rescue forces to go to the aid of Japan", he concluded.
<P> 
Japanese officials have so far not requested outside emergency
rescue teams. According to Kiko Haneda of the Japanese Embassy
in Tel-Aviv, "the Japanese government has not decided yet on any
foreign aid...It has, however, expressed its thankfulness to the
countries that offered it."  The statement was made in regard to
an Israeli offer to send an army canine unit that was trained to
search for survivors buried in debris.
<P>
Reportedly, the U.S. government has also offered to send
members of its' elite Urban Search & Rescue Teams (USAR) 
and National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) medics to the 
scene, but the Japanese government has reportedly not replied 
to these offers.  Some Swiss army search dogs, however, were 
reported to be enroute to Japan to offer their assistance. Many 
problems lie ahead for the devastated areas near Kobe and Osaka.

<H3>MORE could have been saved; Kobe disaster</H3>
<BR>
<P>
Chicago, IL, January 20, 1995 --More than 4,400 people have died,
22,000 have been injured and another 650 are still missing in
the wake of a devastating earthquake that struck Central Japan
on Tuesday. According to the Los Angeles Times, Japan's most
senior civil servant today finally admitted that the Japanese
emergency response was "less than optimal".  Nobuo Ishihara,
Japan's deputy cabinet secretary in charge of coordinating the
emergency response, reportedly said that "it is very serious
that it took so long for us to comprehend the extent of the
damage". Japanese officials have been subjected to increasing
criticism of the slowness of their dispatching of rescue
personnel and continual refusal of offers of "technical rescue
resources" from the United States and other countries.
<P> 
Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama toured the devastated
areas and publicly focused on establishing better
earthquake-proof construction standards. He was quoted by United
Press International (UPI) as saying, "We will make every effort
to search for and rescue those that are still missing...while
redoubling our precautions against the continuing aftershocks."
Other officials within the Murayama government are blaming it's
slow response to the disaster, on a lack of formal request from
the local "prefecture" or state government. Outside rescue
experts say that there may be a number of political and
psychological reasons that the rescue efforts have been delayed
or not requested at all by the Murayama government.
<P>  
This morning, at least nine (9)people were pulled alive from the
wreckage of several of thousands of collapsed buildings. Rescue
experts from the United States and elsewhere say that it is
likely that still more entrapped people will be pulled alive
from the debris. But...they also say that the chances of
survival shrink with each passing hour, and that the Japanese
should have accepted technical help from outside...earlier in
this disaster. The "hot topic" among rescue experts, both on the
Internet and elsewhere, is why the Japanese continue to resist
the idea of "outside help".  One veteran emergency administrator
is quoted in an Internet post as saying, "If I was faced with a
disaster of the magnitude of Kobe, I would be 'screaming for
help' from outside nations)...not just asking for it."
<P>
At least one Chicago area emergency analyst said that he
believes that the delays are based in an ancient Japanese
concept that fears "losing face".  He said that Japanese leaders
may have been unwilling to publicly admit that their own rescue
forces were unprepared to effectively manage the emergency
response to the Kobe quake. Secondarily, he said, admitting the
vast devastation that is evident in the Kobe area is tantamount
to admitting that Japanese earthquake preparedness and
construction standards are not as effective as many had hoped. 
Either admission could result in additional criticism of the
Murayama government and, according to ancient custom, cause
their resignation/removal from power.
<P>
Regardless for the reasons behind a reportedly ineffective
rescue and relief operation, one thing is clear.  Today's global
communications and economic systems make resources and
information available to even the most remote sites where a
disaster might occur. There is certainly no rational reason for
any unnecessary loss of life in a major city, in a major
industrial country.  If enough voices of reason are heard,
maybe...just maybe...leaders of proud cities and countries will
heed the call and ask for help when they really need it. We
would hope that the lessons being learned in Kobe would be
clearly understood by both the Japanese and other countries
faced with catastrophic natural disasters.

<h2>1995, "The Year of the Bomb"</h2>
<p>

Chicago, IL., September 3, 1995 -- With this year only 3/4 over, one thing has become obvious to those that study terrorism and other such violent acts.  According to Clark Staten, Executive Director of the Chicago-based Emergency Response &amp; Research Institute, 1995 will go down in history as "The Year of the Bomb". Staten says that the reasons for this lethal escalation are myriad and multi-dimensional, and do not reflect only one specific theme. Although much of the violence has been attributed to different Islamic Extremist groups; they are not the only culprits in a seemingly worldwide pattern of deadly explosions.<br>
<p>

In defense of Staten's designation of "1995, The Year of the Bomb", he simply points to reports of the past few weeks as an example of what has occurring throughout the year:<p>

September 3, 1995 - A disaster was narrowly averted in a crowded outdoor Paris market on Sunday when a powerful bomb misfired, but nonetheless injured three shoppers. "If the bomb had gone off, it would have resulted in real carnage," said
Georges Sarre, Mayor of the 11th District of the French capital, where the incident took place in a market situated along Boulevard Richard Lenoir near the Bastille Square.<p>

 September 3, 1995- A second bomb within 24 hours exploded on the holiday island of Cyprus early on Sunday, with no immediate indication it was connected to one that nearly killed a nightclub owner the day before.  A package bomb, which 
according to media reports was thrown from a passing car, caused extensive damage to a furniture showroom and two other shops in the Nicosia suburb of Acropolis, police said. the motive is unknown at this time, but possibly related to crime gangs.<p>
<p>
 September 2, 1995- A truck bomb killed four people and wounded 83, the second such bombing in three days, when it blew up near an Algerian village bakery Saturday, the Algerian news agency APS said. The victims of Saturday's bomb attack in the village
of Meftah, 12 miles south of Algiers, included two girls aged nine and 19, the agency said. Several houses and shops were damaged by the blast. Local journalists said that the attack was apparently aimed at the village's police station.They said Meftah is a Moslem fundamentalist stronghold and considered as one of the most politically active places south of Algiers. The blast was the latest in a series of such attacks blamed on Islamic extremists, who oppose coming presidential elections.<p>
<p>
 August 31, 1995- A car bomb, allegedly planted by Moslem militants, ripped through a crowded working class district of Algiers Thursday, killing seven people and wounding at least 100, security sources said. Algerian President Liamine Zeroual, who rushed to the scene, blamed "terrorists," the government name for Moslem guerrillas, the official Algerian news agency APS said. Algerian radio, quoting security sources, said the 
bomb went off at 11.50 a.m. (6:50 a.m. EDT) in Mohamed Ounouri Square in the capital's Bab El-Oued district -- a densely populated area near the city center and a Moslem stronghold. The attack was believed to be the latest in a growing number of car bombs blamed by the authorities on Islamic fundamentalists.<p>
<p>
 August 30, 1995- Two potential bombers died when a device they were making blew up prematurely in a blast allegedly related to a spate of bombings in the Istanbul, Turkey this week, Anatolian news agency said on Wednesday. Two people died and 40 were wounded in five bomb explosions in Istanbul on Sunday and Monday. Four other bombs were defused. Turkish media have said the Islamist militant IBDA-C group and the previously unknown Kurdistan Islamic Union Party have taken responsibility for the 
bombings.<p>
<p>
August 27, 1995- French police are studying an unexploded bomb found alongside a high-speed rail line near Lyon, France on Sunday.   A train driver spotted the bomb, described as a "blue gas canister" by the track just north of Lyon, as he sped past 
on Saturday morning. The area was sealed off and experts defused the 25 kg (55 lb) explosive. Government officials say that they are drawing no immediate links to two recent guerrilla attacks in Paris.<p>
<p>
August 25, 1995- Texas police have arrested a man who was allegedly plotting to bomb the Travis County courthouse in Austin, Travis County Sheriff Terry Keel said.  Richard Perales, 36, was charged with possession of explosives after authorities, acting on a tip, found explosive devices, gunpowder and metal pipes in his home.  Perales was rrested Thursday as he boarded a bus in downtown Austin, near the courthouse. Keel aid he was wearing body armor when he was seized by police.  Perales reportedly "harbored ill will" toward the county that contains the Texas capital, possibly because of past legal problems that included several criminal charges and a failed lawsuit against the county government, Keel said.<p>
<p>
August 24, 1995- One policeman was slightly injured when a car bomb exploded outside a Helsinki, Finland police headquarters, authorities said Friday. The bomb xploded about 12:30 a.m. in a car in a parking lot outside the station, which is located in the city's Pasila area, according to police superintendent Stefan Gerkman. An officer ho was in the headquarters building at the time of the explosion was hit by glass fragments. The headquarters and buildings nearby were damaged. Police said they 
received no warning before the explosion. They also declined to comment on a possible motive for the bombing or on the investigation. No one claimed responsibility.
<p>

August 21, 1995- A suspected Islamic militant, possibly a woman, set off a anti-personnel bomb, Monday, that tore through two crowded commuter buses headed for Hebrew University in Jerusalem. The blast destroyed the bus, which disintegrated  into a smoking hulk of twisted metal and killed five people, including an American tourist.  The police investigation focused on two badly damaged and unidentified odies. Jerusalem Police Chief Arieh Amit said the condition of the woman's body suggested she could have been holding the TNT bomb. "I could see body parts everywhere," said Judy Shulewitz, a Cornell University student who was one of at least three Americans
wounded in the explosion. "There was blood all over the place."  The Muslim militant group Hamas claimed responsibility for the blast, which injured more than 100 other people.
<p>
 August 17, 1995- Two bombings in central Paris, within a month, have raised the issue of a new campaign of Moslem-inspired terrorism in France. A July 25th bomb attack at the Saint-Michel subway station, near Notre Dame Cathedral, killed seven people and 
wounded 84. On Aug. 17th a bombing on public square Charles de Gaulle-Etoile, near the Arc de Triumph, wounded 17 people, three of them seriously, and sprayed the area with nails, bolts, and shredded metal. Algerian Islamist fundamentalists from the Islamic Armed Group, or GIA, are suspected of the latest blasts. GIA has allegedly waged three years of guerrilla warfare in Algeria against a military-backed government, supported  by France. 
<p>
The attacks appear to be linked. Both bombs were made from gas canisters; both were planted at busy locations, near important historic/tourist attractions and were detonated during the evening rush hour. Police have sealed trash cans and other hiding places, across Paris, to prevent them from being used to hide devices. More than 1,500 armed security police have been assigned to patrol subway stations and important public places.<p>

The attacks are the worst such incidents since a wave of twelve (12) bombings in rance, in 1985-86, which claimed at least (13) lives and wounded more than three hundred.
<p>
 August 9, 1995- A bomb exploded just after midday on Wednesday in a Jeep parked in the east end of Montreal, Canada, killing the vehicle's driver and seriously injuring a 10-year-old boy who was standing on a nearby sidewalk. Police were reportedly 
investigating as to whether the bomb was related to a an on-going turf war between ival motorcycle gangs, which has resulted in several previous incidents. "It's certain hat with this kind of explosion we envisage the possibility of bikers, but it is too early to say," said Lieutenant-Detective Claude Lachapelle, of the Montreal Urban Community olice. Police said the bomb exploded at 12:45 p.m. (1645 GMT). The explosion threw 
the man out of the vehicle, tearing off one of his legs, police said.
<p>
 August 9, 1995- A car bomb exploded outside a district police headquarters in western Algiers on Tuesday slightly wounding three people, the official Algerian news agency PS reported on Wednesday.  The blast occurred on Tuesday at 7.40 p.m. (1840 GMT) near the district of Ben Aknoun, injuring three passers-by, APS quoted security officials as saying. The three were treated in hospital and discharged, APS said. The blast damaged four offices. 
<p>
On Sunday Aug. 6th, 11 people were killed and 25 wounded when a truck loaded with explosives blew up on the outskirts of Boufarik, some 30 km (18 miles) southwest of Algiers, according to an earlier official report. More than 40,000 people have 
allegedly been killed in Algeria since January 1992, when the authorities scrapped a general election that Islamist Fundamentalist were expected to win.
<p>
                        *****<p>
<p>
More troubling than the number and intensity of the attacks documented here is the fact that they are just a few of hundreds of bombings and thwarted bombing conspiracies that have occurred so far this year, throughout the world. Least we forget, there was also a still unsolved truck bombing in Oklahoma City that took more than 160 American lives and wounded more than 400.  
<p>
Staten said that even American street gangs have adopted terror tactics, and are using "molotov cocktails" or firebombs to intimidate potential witnesses or to exact revenge on rival gang members.  And, it is just not in the big cities. Within the past two weeks, ENN was notified of a series of streetgang firebomb attacks in Youngstown, OH.  previous reports of this type of incident have come from Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Rochester, NY, and Miami, FL. Indictments in Chicago, earlier this year, also report that gang members have been attempting to buy commercial and military xplosives and even army Light Anti-Tank Weapons (LAW), to be used against law enforcement officers. The usage of military fragmentation grenades have been reported in several American jurisdictions. 
<p>
Staten concluded by saying that international fears of "the big one" (a nuclear detonation) may have decreased in recent years, but that it is far more likely than ever before that an individual could be injured or killed in one of dozens of "brush-fire" conflicts that are on-going in numerous regions, throughout the world. He predicted that the number of bombings and other attacks, motivated by geo-political, religious, 
racial, or ethnic causes will continue to increase in the foreseeable future.<p>

<H2>TERROR Campaign widens; Bomb in Paris Subway</H2>
<BR>
Chicago, IL., July 25, 1995 --At least four (4)people were
killed and another 35 wounded in an afternoon terror attack that
took place today in the Paris Saint-Michel underground station,
near the Latin quarter. Police officials are investigating and
wouldn't immediately comment, but French Prime Minister Alain
Juppe is quoted by the Reuters News service as saying that he
believes that "there is a very strong suspicion of a (terrorist)
attack".
<P>
According to emergency medical service (EMS) officers, several
people were trapped by the blast that ripped through the
station.  One account says that it was necessary to amputate the
limbs of at least one passenger, in order to extricate them from
the wreakage.  Emergency officials say that they were on the
scene within minutes of the 17:30p.m.(1530GMT) explosion, that
occurred during afternoon rush hour.  Early rescuer reports said
that at least ten of the injured were in critical condition and
that many had suffered shrapnel wounds to the head and chest.
Others were reported with "crushing injuries" and "broken
bones", according to one unidentified rescuer.
<P>

Police said that the type and size of the bomb was unknown, but
that the destruction was "probably" caused by a "explosive
device".  One eyewitness said that the explosion had emulated
from within one of the cars of the train, that was in the
station at the time of the blast. A police spokesperson said
that no one had claimed responsibility for the blast, but that
concerns have been raised of  the possible involvement of
disputes involving the radical Islamic Salvation Front and
French intervention in Algeria.
<P> 

In a possibly related story, Algerian officials are reporting a
car bomb attack today in Meftah, 20 miles Southeast of Algiers,
which killed five (5) people and wounded another seven (7).
Experts say that this bombing is the latest in a series of
bombings of buses and other targets in a number of areas
surrounding Algiers. Reportedly, several "improvised" bombs have
been set off in buses and on highways and bridges in recent
days. Traffic has reportedly been delayed or re-routed in or
near Tizi Ouzou, a town 60 miles East of Algiers. At least two
other bridges have been damaged in the past week, by "suspicious
explosions", of an unknown origin.
<P> 

In one more related story, a bus bomb exploded in central
Pakistan on Sunday (07/23), killing three (3) and wounding
another twenty-five (25). The bomb exploded on the bus as it was
traveling through Kasur, on its way to Kot Radha Kishan.  Police
reportedly have not identified the bombers, but officials said
that the attack fits a pattern consistent with previous Islamic
extremist violence.
<P>

ERRI analysts said that this latest wave of bombings, allegedly
carried out by Islamic extremists, parallels the level of
terrorist activity that proceeded the World Trade Center
bombing. At least one ERRI analyst said that he fears that this
latest wave of violence could also involve the United States. He
pointed to earlier U.S. State Department warnings of a suspected
plot to attack an American target in South America, and said
that he would suggest expanding that warning to also include the
continental United States.

<H3>TERRORISTS STRIKE AGAIN IN PARIS</H3>
<BR>
Chicago, IL., August 17, 1995 -- In another strike at the center
of Paris, and it's tourist trade, a bomb has exploded near the
Arc de Triumph today. The bomb, described as an "anti-personnel
device" by explosives experts, has injured at least sixteen
people.  Three of those injured are believed to be in critical
condition; no one reportedly died as the result of the blast.
<P>

Speculation about those responsible for the detonation has
centered on Islamic extremists and links to disputes about the
establishment of a Moslem government in Algeria. As of the time
of this report, however, no one has claimed actual
responsibility for the heinous act. French police were reported
to have detained two individuals for questioning, immediately
following the blast, but no charges have been filed and it is
believed that they may have been merely witnesses to the event.
<P>

The bomb itself reportedly was constructed from a butane/propane
canister that had been emptied and filled with explosives and
nails and bolts. A anonymous Paris Fire Department source said
that the device was similar in nature to another bomb which
exploded in a Paris subway approximately three weeks ago.  The
previous St. Michel subway explosion claimed the lives of seven
(7) people and injured eighty (80) more.
<P>

According to French emergency officials, the entire area near
the Champs-Elyses and the Arc de Triumph was closed and
evacuated soon after the blast, as police officers and
explosives detecting dogs searched trash cans and other likely
hiding places for additional devices. Sources close to the Paris
police said that the device was particularly troubling because
it was designed to cause maximum injuries or deaths among those
in the vicinity. They pointed to the use of nails and other
metal objects that would become shrapnel as the device detonated.
<P>
French Prime Minister Alain Juppe reportedly visited the
disaster site shortly after the explosion and attempted to
reassure the spirits of Parisians and by asking them not to
"give in to the psychosis (of terrorism)". Juppe reportedly said
that he had allocated more than 200 police officers to the
investigation of the previous subway bombing, and that number
would be increased as dictated by the requirements of the
current crisis. Fears were raised within the government that
this latest attack was only part of yet another wave of terror,
similar to a 1986 series of bombings which claimed thirteen (13)
lives in Paris.

<H3>Disaster Again Narrowly Averted in Paris Bombing</H3>
<BR>
Chicago, IL, October 6, 1995 -- Paris Fire Brigade and police
officials say that disaster was again narrowly averted today in
another bombing near a subway station in Southeast Paris. The
blast occurred at a little after 4:00p.m.(Paris time), outside
the Maison Blanche station on the Avenue d'Itale.  Using a
tactic that is becoming "old-hat" in Paris bombings, terrorists
had placed a time-delayed device in a trash can.
<P>

Unfortunately for the bombers, and fortunate for Paris
residents, a passerby noticed the device in the trash can and
called for the police and fire brigade. According to Justice
Minister Jacques Toubon, the device exploded as emergency
officials were preparing to defuse it. Toubon said that by the
time the bomb went off, people had already voluntarily evacuated
the area, thus preventing a massive number of injuries. At least
nine people were, however, reported injured as a result of the
blast, two of them described by ambulance personnel as
"serious".
<P> 

An unidentified police bomb squad officer said that the type of
device was also becoming familiar to French police, as it was
comprised of a detonator, and a "camping gas canister" with
nuts, nails, and bolts attached. The technique is one that has
been previously used by the Armed Islamic Group or GIA. The
Algerian-based GIA is suspected of involvement in all of the
recent bombings in France. Police say that no one has claimed
responsibility for today's bombing.
<P>  

Ironically, and probably purposefully, the bombing took place at
a subway station by the same name (Maison Blanche)as the village
where suspected Islamic terrorist Khalid Kelkal was killed in a
gunbattle with police on Sept. 29th.  Today's bombing took place
shortly after Kelkal's funeral, which was held in the Lyon's
suburb of Rillieux-La-Pape. Counter-terrorist experts say that
today's bombing was undoubtedly in retribution for Kelkal's
death at the hands of French police. French police and
counter-terrorist forces say that they remain on maximum alert
for further insurgent activity and that hundreds of police and
military personnel have been assigned to the prevention of
additional acts.

<H3>Terrorist Attack in Oklahoma</H3>
<P>

Chicago, IL, (ENN) April 19, 1995 --The normal activities of a Wednesday morning in Oklahoma City, OK were shattered by a massive explosion that destroyed the entire front of the Federal Building and broke windows for more than two blocks.  The unthinkable has happened again, terrorism had come to America...this time in a most deadly way. The second story of the building housed a day care center.  At least sixteen (16) children are reported dead as the result of the blast. More than two-hundred and fifty (250) others are reported missing at this hour and another three hundred (300) are reported injured.
<P>
Federal bureau of Investigation (FBI)investigators say that they have not firmly determined a motive or suspects in this latest atrocity.  Reportedly, the primary device left a 20ft. circular crater that is 8ft. deep.  A secondary device was also reportedly found inside the building, believed placed there with a time delay fuse to kill rescuers, after they had arrived on the scene.  Unconfirmed reports were also received of a third device.  The secondary device was reported disarmed at the scene. Further details regarding the actual configuration of the devices is being withheld by federal officials as the investigation continues. Reports claim that more than one radical group has called to accept responsibility for the bombing.
<P>
  Clark Staten, Executive Director of the Chicago-based Emergency Response & Research Institute(ERRI), and the author of the "Emergency Response Guide to Terrorism" said that, "The incident has all of the earmarks of a improvised device using ammonium nitrate fertilizer, mixed with fuel oil and with oxygen tanks added for acceleration". "Although this is speculation at this point, it would appear to be a recently common tactic used by terrorist organizations...it could be similar to the device used in the World Trade Center bombing", Staten continued.  "From the size of the crater and the collateral damage, it is obvious that it was done by 'professionals' and that they intended to cause massive damage and a large numbers of deaths", the veteran emergency manager added. "It is likely that this attack came from the direction of the Mid-East", the counter-terrorist analyst said.
<P>
"The FBI and ATF crime labs will be able to determine the basic composition of the explosives within a fairly short period of time, and that should offer them some clues in regard to the perpetrators", Staten continued. "Chemical analysis of the remains of the scene and the presence or absence of nitrates should provide investigators with information what kind of explosives were used", he continued.  "We have been advised that a large number of the U.S. Government's best criminologists, bomb technicians, and investigators are on-scene or enroute to the scene...they'll get to the bottom of it", Staten added. 
<P>
According to Staten, ERRI had been monitoring an increasing threat level for the past several weeks and had predicted the possibility of another monstrousness attack in the United States. In a report issued about three weeks ago, following the Gas Poisoning attack in Tokyo, ERRI analysts had outlined a fictional bombing scenario in Chicago and warned of an additional threat against the United States.  Angry rhetoric and verbal threats from Iran and her allies had prompted an additional concern by the emergency service think-tank.
<P>
Rescue operations are still underway at the time of this report. As many as three-hundred (300) people are still missing and many believed trapped in the "pan-caked" collapse of the front of the stricken building.  Mutual aid fire and ambulance units have responded from the Oklahoma City vicinity, as well as specialty units from other parts of the United States. Several U.S. Army and Oklahoma National Guard units are either on-scene or enroute, including a special Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) Unit from Texas. Dog handlers and search dogs have also reportedly been arriving on the scene.
<P>
According to several unofficial reports, federal buildings and postal facilities in several areas of the country were closed and employees sent home during the day today.  Numerous law enforcement agencies have been advised to increase their state of alert and additional federal law enforcement resources have been made available to track the hundreds of leads that are being generated by the attack in Oklahoma.  The head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, James Witt, was reportedly sent to Oklahoma city by President Clinton, late this afternoon.
<P>

As the rescue continues, more questions than answers remain. One thing is certain.  America has again been struck a damaging blow, this time, in its heartland.  The ugly threat of international terrorism continues.
<P>
<HR>

<H3>Middle-Eastern Suspects/Witnesses Sought</H3>
<P>

Chicago, IL,(ENN) April 20, 1995-- At least three suspects/witnesses have reportedly been tentatively identified by the federal bombing task force and one or more may have been taken into custody.  Several sources are reporting that three males of "middle-eastern extraction" are being sought in Texas and Oklahoma, and that some witnesses are being questioned at this hour by federal officers.  Another suspect/witness has been reportedly denied entry and detained in London, England as he attempted to travel to Italy.  The FBI is currently attempting to locate two additional individuals, who they say may have additional information regarding the atrocity in Oklahoma City. A special FBI number, 1-800-905-1514, has been set up for people to call with information regarding possible suspects.
<P>
Speculation continues in regard to the motivation and identification of the perpetrators.  Federal officials, who are in the process of questioning suspects and processing evidence, do not want to "tip their hand" or give possible suspects any information that could hamper their future investigation.  Although unconfirmed by federal sources, several counter-terrorist analysts say that the motivation of the attack in Oklahoma City may have been primarily to cause fear that terrorists can strike anywhere...including the "breadbasket" of America.
<P>  
A major debate has arisen today about the general security in America, and how future attacks such as this can be prevented.  Many Americans, who might not previously have been concerned about terrorism, have suddenly awakened to the vulnerablity of the United States.  Inherent in this fear is a discussion of the limitation of personal freedoms in order to prevent future attacks.  Ironically, counter-terrorist experts say that to develop effective plans to thwart additional assaults, it may require that at least some constitutionally guaranteed freedoms would have to be curtailed. Effective counter-terrorist tactics in Israel and England, for example, have involved check-points, electronic surviellence, expanded wiretap powers and a variety of other measures.
<P> 
In other developments, rescue operations in Oklahoma City have reportedly been halted for two or three hours, due to unstable conditions in the stricken building.  An Oklahoma City fire official said that all rescuers have been ordered to exit the bombed out shell that once was the Murrah Federal Office building. Rescue officials are said to be preparing to "shore up" several sections of the building, in hopes of stabilizing the structure enough to allow rescuers back into it. At least one report has been recieved that there still may be people alive in the structure.
<P>
Several FEMA USAR (Urban Search & Rescue) teams are on-site in Oklahoma City, as are dog handlers and special search dogs that are used to find victims in earthquakes or other entrapment situations. Additional fire/rescue and Emergency Medical Service personnel have arrived in Oklahoma City to assist in what is turning out to be a "world-class" rescue operation.  Rescue experts and emergency historians say that victims have been found alive in collapsed structures for many hours after earthquakes and other natural disasters. Rescuers in Oklahoma City say that they still have hopes that they can successfully extricate people from the structure.
<P>
 A massive federal effort is underway to determine the identity of the assailants and their locations.  Many more questions must be asked and answered before this inquiry can actually be resolved.

<H3>Domestic Versus International??</H3>
<BR>
<H4> An Editorial Perspective</H4>
<BR>
By Clark Staten, ENN Executive Editor
<P>
Chicago, IL, April 23, 1995 - As the focus of the U.S. government investigation has shifted from a largely international to a domestic terrorist conspiracy, many questions have begun to be asked about why many counter-terrorist experts and analysts had chosen to predict that the Oklahoma City bombing had been perpetrated by a Mid-Eastern Moslem Extremist organization.  A number of members of the Moslem community have painted a picture that suggests that men and women, who were attempting to unravel the mysterious and devastating bombing in Oklahoma, were somehow doing so with a "racist motive" of condemning Moslems worldwide. Nothing could be further from the truth.
<P>
In interviews, conducted during the past few days, most counter-terrorist analysts were quick to point out that the perpetrators could be members of a "fringe extremist element" of the larger worldwide Moslem movement.  Most have publicly acknowledged, as has ERRI, that a majority of Moslems are peace loving, loyal citizens of the countries in which they reside, and that their religion prohibits the kind of senseless violence that was seen in Oklahoma.  Those that study such issues understand, as many citizens may not, that there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Moslems that condemn violence and believe in peacemaking and brotherhood with all of their neighbors.
<P> 
That being said, how could any number of these "experts" quickly jump to the conclusion that the perpetrators in Oklahoma City were "Moslem Extremists"??  Most of the law enforcement officials and counter-terrorist analysts, interviewed by ENN, indicated that it was a matter of historic and analytical perspective...not a quest to justify the condemnation of any ethnic group.  Some, again including ERRI, said that they had considered a domestic connection to the Waco Branch Davidian incident because of the date of the event, but had discounted it as details of the type of bomb and the tactics used were discovered.  Most said that the circumstances surrounding the deadly atrocity in Oklahoma were just too similar to those seen in Lebanon, Israel, Egypt, England, and elsewhere to lead them to believe that this was a domestic attack.
<P>
Many anti-terrorist experts were aware of the existence of any number of "right-wing" paramilitary organizations within the United States, and their incumbent sympathies regarding the Branch Davidian siege and fiery conclusion. Some agencies have very thorough investigative files regarding "fringe paramilitary organizations" that have existed in the United States for several years.  Most, however, did not believe that Americans would attack Americans in such a bloody pursuit of their social and political agenda.  As more facts became known, most of the people interviewed for this article were astonished that such a monstrous act could have been executed by those trained within our own military and those that have lived among us for their entire lives. The incongruity of killing innocent American women and children because of disagreement over government policies was beyond comprehension to many that study these issues.
<P>
As the evidence continues to be gathered of connections, with "white Supremacist" and other American "extremist organizations", many counter-terrorist operatives say that the revelations concerning Oklahoma City are, in some ways, more frightening than an external threat. They say that a growing domestic "neo-nazi", "skinhead", or "white supremacist" threat is something that has been studied, but not in the way that it has manifested itself in Oklahoma City.  Most agree that this threat may be far more insidious and violent than had been previously anticipated.
<P>
So, as the rescue workers toil on in an agonizing and heartbreaking search for additional life, and others attempt to find solace at a memorial service in Oklahoma City, those that study terrorists and terrorism have begun a new focus of their efforts. As before, they also will attempt to help save lives and discover the tenuous links between violent individuals and groups that would wish Americans harm.  They will continue to attempt to explain the inexplicable, and help to prevent future catastrophes like Oklahoma City.  Worst of all, they may have just discovered that some of our most evil enemies are Americans.

<H2>"Terrorist Attack" in Toyko</H2>
<BR>
Chicago, IL, March 19, 1995 --Monday morning rush hour, in Tokyo, has
disintegrated into chaos, according to Japanese news and
government sources. Reports of toxic fumes in a subway station
began at approximately 08:17 a.m. (Tokyo time) and have quickly
escalated into a major mass casualty incident.  According to the
Tokyo Metropolitan Police, as many as five-hundred sixty-five
(565) people have been hospitalized and five people are
confirmed dead.
<P>
The cause of this morning's disastrous incident continues to be
one of mystery and intrigue, with a mid-morning statement that
the incident was caused by a "random mass attack" perpetrated by
an "unknown person or persons". Few other details were released
by official sources, except another statement that Tokyo police
were treating the incident as "multiple homicide investigation".
No group has claimed responsibility for the heinous act.
<P>
The exact nature of the chemical involved has also remained a
mystery until the time of this report. Initial reports,
attributed to the Tokyo Fire Department, said that the poisonous
substance was acetonitrile, an extremely toxic substance used as
a fumigant and in metal treatment and photo processing.  The
next report, from the police department, said that there two
boxes that were believed to contain Methyl Cyanide, also a very
toxic chemical, that can cause rapid injury and death.  The
latest, unconfirmed, report speculates that a nerve gas called
Sarin may be the cause of the tragic occurrence.

<P>
<HR>
<H5>CONCLUSIONS</H5>
<BR>
Nerve agents are in the stockpiles of several nations, and      
it is suspected that they may be possessed by several
terrorist groups. They are an insidious way to injure or
kill a large number of people in a rapid, painful, and
gruesome manner. All methods of public transportation,
and areas of public gathering are vulnerable.
<P>
An ERRI analysis of the incident(to the time of this report),
suggests that the symptoms reported by unofficial sources, thus
far, are not consistent with the nerve agent Sarin. But, that it
is difficult with the limited amount of information that is
currently available to firmly establish the chemical that was
involved. Additionally, a chemical analysis of the scene should
confirm the actual chemical used, after the proper tests have
been run at a lab.
<P>
One thing is certain. If it can be established that a nerve
agent was used in Japan, the extremist assault on society has
intensified by another deadly degree.

<H3>Analysis; Ongoing Series of Attacks in Japan </H3>
<BR>     
By Paul Anderson, ENN Correspondent
<P>
Chicago, IL, May 13, 1995 -- In a new and maybe unrelated terrorist
twist, a pipe bomb exploded on Saturday at the new Tokyo airport
in Narita.  The explosion reportedly caused a small fire, but no
injuries were reported.  Witnesses described the device as being
a "pipebomb", that may have been configured as an
"anti-personnel" device, due to the fact that steel balls were
found in the debris of the detonation. It is a common practice
for terrorists to add nails, screws, and/or ball bearings to a
improvised device to act as shrapnel, according to American
explosive ordinance disposal experts.
<P>

The Narita airport bombing is latest in a string of terrorist
acts affecting the country of Japan, dating back to the March
20th poison gas release in the subway system.  That attack, and
its details have been the focus of worldwide attention, since
its occurrence. Counter-Terrorist (CT) analysts continue to
question the details of that attack, as well as to attempt to
assess its implications for the rest of the world.
<P>

According to Clark Staten, Executive Director of the Emergency
Response & Research Institute (ERRI) of Chicago, IL, there are
still too many unanswered questions regarding the alleged Sarin
release in Tokyo. Staten says that he still has not abandoned
his early hypothesis that the poison released into the Tokyo
subway system was not pure Sarin gas.  He continues to maintain
that the symptoms of some the patients reportedly exposed to
Sarin are inconsistent with exposure to the military nerve
agent. "Unfortunately, patient information regarding
cholinesterase tests and other quantifiable evidence of exposure
to nerve agents has not been forthcoming from Japanese medical
authorities", the veteran emergency services analyst said.
<P>
"There are still too many unanswered questions to form a final
opinion, but it would still appear that there is some question
as to the verified identification of the agent or agents that
were released into the subway system in Tokyo", Staten
continued. "As we continue to gather facts, we are still
concerned that we may not be prepared in other countries for an
emergency response to a situation similar to the initial Tokyo
incident", he added. "Identification of the exact type(s) of
agent(s) involved is essential, if we are to adequately prepare
elsewhere", Staten said.  "It would be most helpful to other
emergency services, if the Japanese police/government were to
release additional official details about the chemical
composition of the compound(s) involved in the March 20th
atrocity", the hazardous materials specialist added.
<P>

Staten continued by saying that it is possible that some of the
signs and symptoms of the stricken patients, seen on video tape
and reported by eyewitnesses, are indicative of several other
different types of chemical agents other than Sarin gas.  He
points to the fact that Sarin is an extremely toxic substance
that "should have killed hundreds or thousands...not a dozen",
if it were the agent used. Additionally, Staten said that ERRI's
initial investigation suggests that it is likely that there may
have been "multiple agents used", or that the poison used was
"impure" or "chemically different" than the pure nerve agent
used by the military in chemical warfare. 
<P>
"It is even more sinister and diabolical to think that the
terrorist in the Tokyo attack may have used more than one
agent...that could confuse the responding fire, police, and
emergency medical services (EMS) agencies", Staten said. 
"Normally, emergency responders try to identify one chemical or
a combination of chemicals and then try to treat those exposed
in a logical manner", he continued.  "In Tokyo, it may have been
possible that one poison was used at one subway station and
another chemical at another...that could explain the disparity
in symptoms of those exposed in Tokyo", Staten added. "Another
possible explanation is that the poison used in Tokyo was
incorrectly mixed or 'contaminated' by other substances that
still made it poisonous, but not to the strength or toxicity of
actual Sarin gas", he continued. "If only we had the empirical
evidence to support a set of conclusions...it would be possible
put this issue to rest and begin to prepare for future
eventualities", Staten concluded.
<P>
Staten also said that he believes that many chemicals that could
have been used to concoct various poison gases were reportedly
present in the AUM Shinrikyo compounds, but that they could have
had a variety of other uses.  He said that a preliminary
analysis of some of the chemicals could even indicate that it is
possible that "designer drugs" could have been produced on the
premises. Although not confirmed, Staten said that there have
been some law enforcement allegations concerning possible links
between AUM Shinrikyo and an amphetamine-type drug that has
reportedly been distributed in Japan and elsewhere.
<P> 

Additionally, Staten said that sources close to an international
law enforcement organization have said that it is also possible
that a "select few individuals", within the AUM Shinrikyo, have
financial and other ties to "organized crime figures" in Russia
and at least one other country. Staten concluded the interview
by saying that there is much more investigative work to be done
in regard to the entire series of poison gas attacks in Japan,
and that the international CT community is concerned about
whether or not this is a "domestic terrorist agenda" within
Japan, or if the danger may soon be exported elsewhere.

<H3>Japan Terror Continues ; Cult Leaders Sought</H3>
<BR>
Editorial Opinion
<BR> 
By Clark Staten, Analyst/Editor
<P>
Chicago, IL, May 15 --Murder arrest warrants have finally been
issued for Shoko Asahara and as many as forty (40) of his AUM
Shinrikyo (Supreme Truth) followers.  Japanese police today
announced that they have also arrested a key figure in the
investigation of the March 20th poison gas attack in several
Tokyo subways. Arrested was Yoshihiro Inoue, a 25 year old
karate expert and suspected "enforcer" for the cult.  Inoue,
described as the "intelligence chief" for AUM Shinrikyo, is
reportedly charged with leading five two-man teams in the
planting toxic substances at several Tokyo subway stations.
<P>
Tokyo Metropolitan Police are described as "elated" that Inoue
has been arrested, because they say that they had feared that he
would be the leader of additional terrorist acts, if Asahara
were indicted and directly sought in the investigation. Some,
confidentially, still say that they still fear reprisal attacks,
if and when Asahara is arrested.  An independent police source
says that a raid on the AUM compound at the base of Mt. Fuji may
be imminent. Police have previously raided the Supreme Truth
compound in the village of Kamiku Isshiki, but have thus far not
been able to locate Asahara.
<P>
In two possibly related incidents, reports have been received,
overnight, of another case of "mysterious fumes" in the Subway
in Yokohama.  As many as twenty people were reportedly affected
by some, as yet, unidentified noxious fumes. At least three
people were transported to the hospital with respiratory
difficulties, where they are described by doctors as being in
"satisfactory" condition. No one has claimed responsibility for
this latest scare, nor has the substance been identified.
<P>
Over the weekend, in a more bizarre twist, 30 "mystery balloons"
were reported to have landed in a number of places, most near
Tottori Prefecture, in an area 320 miles South of Tokyo. Each of
the balloons was described as having a small tube attached, with
miniature dials, numbers, and small batteries. Speculation has
centered on the idea that the balloons were designed to spread
additional fear that terrorists could release balloons with
chemicals or explosives attached, and have them spread
throughout Japan.  The devices, reportedly, did not have any
markings or other identifying marks, and did not contain any
toxic or explosive products. American CT (Counter-terrorist)
analysts say that the balloon launches are yet another ominous
example of the devious and dangerous tactics that terrorists can
undertake to cause fear in a civilian populace.
<P>
Japanese officials have not drawn any direct links between
either the balloon flights or the latest fumes in the Yokohama
subway, but sources close to the police say that they
"unofficially" believe that these latest threats are part of a
larger ongoing terror campaign against the Japanese people. 
International CT specialists say that the entire series of
events, in Japan, could have been taken right out of a classic
"terrorist playbook" and preplanned to cause the maximum amount
of fear and apprehension among the Japanese citizenry. They say,
by definition, that is what terrorism is all about.
<P>
Although the convoluted minds and twisted motivations of
terrorists are difficult to ascertain, often they are rooted in
using terror to bring about radical change.  Be it in government
leaders, political organization, geographic borders. religious
tolerance (or lack thereof), or racial politics, the motivation
is the same...to cause a massive change that will better suit
the radical fringe that has undertaken the terror campaign.
And...if the affected government will undertake brutal and
"draconian" measures to combat the threat, so much the better. 
That, also, plays right into the hands of the
terorists...because suddenly imposed restrictions on personal
freedoms can serve to further alienate the general population
from its government and can lead to additional distrust, chaos
and possible rebellion.
<P>  
Hopefully, the arrests of Asahara and others associated with the
"doomsday cult", in Japan, will end the terror campaign there.
And...maybe they can provide some food for thought about how we
will respond to domestic terrorism in this county.  We agree
that retribution should be, as President Clinton said,
"swift...certain... and severe" for those that perpetrated acts
like the Oklahoma City bombing and the Japanese Subway poison
gas attacks.  We must assure, however, that our civil liberties
and confidence in our government don't suffer from our hasty and
well-meaning attempts to provide for security at home and
abroad.

<h2>Flight 4184 Crash</h2>
		

<b>Plane Crash In Indiana; 68 Confirmed Deaths</b>
<P>



 (Updates details, gives death toll, confirms investigation) 
<P>

Chicago, IL, November 1, 1994  -- A commuter plane, American Eagle FLT.

4184, is confirmed down in a corn field near Roselawn/Lowell,

IN.  It dropped from O'Hare radar screens shortly after 16:00CST

this afternoon.  An eyewitness said that the plane disintegrated

upon impact.  Debris is reportedly strewn throughout a 3/4 mile

area . The flight is believed to be an American Airlines

commuter flight from Indianapolis to Chicago.  It is reported to

be a twin-engine AFR-72 Aerospatial that can carry up to

sixty-five (65) patients.  An initial report says that

sixty-four passengers and four crew members were on-board the

plane when it went down.
<P> 



Newton County Coroner Philpot responded to the scene and now

says that all aboard the plane have perished.  Rescue efforts

are said to have been halted by local officials after it was

confirmed that no survivors could be found at the scene. 

Earlier reports of multiple injuries turned out to erroneous, no

survivors have been found.  Local and state police reportedly

have encircled the area and secured it, until first light, when

a complete investigation will ensue. 
<P>



A FireNEWS/ENN correspondent, on the ground in Shuererville,IN.,

confirms that local ambulances and fire units have been recalled

from the scene and returned to service.  He said that there were

no survivors evident when the first rescue units arrived on the

scene. The crash is located in a rural area, and the remnants of

the plane are said to be located in the mud, 1/2 mile from the

nearest road.
<P>  



Fire departments and ambulances were said to have responded to

the accident from all over NW Indiana.  Mutual aid agreements

between numerous emergency agencies were activated, even though

it turned out that they were not needed. A psychological crisis

care intervention team has reportedly been requested for both

O'Hare airport in Chicago and to the airport in Indianapolis.
<P>



Although no cause has been determined for the crash, speculation

has centered on weather conditions in the Roselawn area.  Heavy

fog, wind, and rain were reported in the area of the crash, at

the time the plane went down.  No additional official details

will be available until a joint FAA/NTSB and State Police

investigation team is able to examine the scene and gather the

flight recorders and evaluate the information contained therein.

 That is expected to occur early Tuesday morning.
<P>

Additional information as it becomes available...

<TITLE>UsAir Ftl. 427 Crashes Near Pittsburgh</TITLE>

<HR>

<H2>USAir Flt. 427 Crashes Near Pittsburgh</H2>

Chicago, IL, September 9, 1994, (ENN)  2130CDT -- Reports from both emergency
service personnel and official sources indicate that a USAir
737-300 aircraft, enroute from Chicago to Pittsburg, has crashed
into a field Northwest of Pittsburg International.  The plane,
Flt. 427, was scheduled to arrive in Pittsburg at 7:09 p.m.
(local time).   Neither the FAA nor Pittsburg International
airport have reported any distress signal being recieved from
the striken aircraft.  Eyewitness reports from the scene
indicate that the plane banked and dove directly into the
ground, then burst into flames.  All 131 passengers and crew
have apparently perished in the crash.
<P>

Rescuers from Hopewell Township have described the scene as
"gruesome" with "body parts hanging from the trees".  The
largest piece of the plane, that is left intact, is believed to
be the tail and it is described as being a piece of slivered
metal about the size of a person.  Bits of baggage, shredded
parts of the plane, and severed limbs are reportedly strewn over
a large area.  Rescuers are believed to be hampered by darkness
and the rugged terrain in the area of the crash.
<P>

 Unconfirmed reports have suggested that the plane had exploded
prior to impacting the ground, which would account for the
debris being spread over a very wide area. Other eyewitnesses
have said that it "dove into the ground under full power". 
Contradictory reports continue to be received as additional
witnesses are interviewed.  The FAA has ordered the scene
sealed, and it is being surrounded by local and state police
officials. CBS News is reporting that the FBI has been called in
to the case because of the mysterious circumstances under which
the plane crashed. At least one unconfirmed report said that the
possibility of sabotage exists and that the explosion may have
been altitude detonated.
<P> 

According to an Allegeny County Spokesperson, no body recovery
will be attempted during nighttime hours.  An investigation and
extensive review of the crash site will reportedly be conducted
in the morning. It is to be supervised by the National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA), and local police experts. A local fire
department source said that both of the plane's "black boxes"
had been recovered and that they will be sent to Washington, DC
for evaluation.
<P>

Lisa Howard, from the Chicago Department of Aviation, is quoted
as saying that the Chicago Fire Dept. Critical Incident Stress
Debriefing (CISD) team has been placed on standby, should they
be needed to counsel the Chicago families of those lost, or to
travel to Pittsburg and assist with the large number of families
and rescuers that could suffer from the effects of grieving or
the devastating scene.  Experts in CISD say that circumstances
such as those involved in Pittsburg crash can cause severe
psychological or emotional distress, both now in a critical
sense and later as a delayed stress syndrome.
<P>

The investigation of this crash has just begun, and many more
technical and human details will need to be gathered before firm
conclusions can be reached.  The loss of "131 souls" will
undoubtedly be grievously felt by hundreds of family members and
friends. For now, more questions exist than answers.

<H2>L.A. POLICE ACQUITTED, RIOTING STRIKES S.E. LOS ANGELES</H2>
By Clark Staten
<P>

Los Angeles, CA -  In an unexpected climax to a year of
racial strife surrounding the alleged L.A.P.D. beating of
Rodney King, a jury of six men and six women found the
officers not guilty.  The jurors were unable to reach a
conclusion regarding one charge against Officer Laurence
Powell, age 29, for using excessive force under the color of
authority. A mistrial was declared by Judge Stanley Weisberg
on that one count, with eight jurors voting for acquittal and
four for a guilty verdict.
<P>

Sgt. Stacey Koon, Officer Theodore Briseno, and Officer
Timothy Wind were found completely not quilty on all counts
of official misconduct, excessive force, filing false police
reports, and assault with a deadly weapon.  District Attorney
Ira Reiner said that no decision had been reached in regard
to whether or not to retry Officer Powell on the one count
that was declared indecisive.
<P>

An eighty-one second video tape, captured by a concerned
citizen, sparked the controversy regarding police brutality
and led to eventual indictments of the officers.  Many months
of investigation, charges, and counter-charges followed the
release of the video tape.  Various segments of the
community in Los Angeles were polarized as the details of the
played out daily on local television stations.
<P>

A trial ensued.  It was moved to suburban Simi Valley, CA,
due to pre-trial publicity and the seemingly premature
release of the now "infamous" tape of the police wielding
batons and striking King repeatedly. A jury was chosen that
contained eleven white jurors and one of Philipino descent.
Black civil rights activists complained that no blacks were
chosen for the jury and that the choice of jurors was another
example of racism.
<P>

The trial and surrounding investigations also sparked
unprecedented criticism of Police Chief Daryl Gates and the
entire Los Angeles Police Department.  The Christopher
Commission was formed and did find occasions of racism and
institutional brutality.  Police officers in Los Angeles were
also found to have used official computer systems for
insensitive and racist remarks.  Calls were received for the
resignation of the Chief Gates.
<P>

Lawyers for the officers charged in the allegations argued
that the policemen believed that King was acting under the
influence of the animal tranquilizer PCP, which often causes
violent and unpredictable behavior that has resulted in the
injury of numerous emergency responders and law enforcement
officers. They also testified as to King's combativeness that
didn't appear on the tape. King was not found to have been
using PCP, but was found to have a blood alcohol level of.19,
which is more than double that allowed in most states as
indicative of "drunken driving".  The evidence was weighed
and the jury found the four officer not quilty after seven
days of deliberations.
<P>

A reaction to the acquittal of the four officers was
immediately received from blacks and civilrights activists.
The Mayor of Los Angeles, Tom Bradley, said; "We must express
our profound anger and outrage (at the acquittal), but we
also must not endanger the reforms that we have made by
striking out blindly".  He continued, "We must demand that
the L.A.P.D. fire the officers who beat Rodney King and take
them off the streets once and for all".
<P>

California State Senator Ed Smith said that he was also
shocked. Smith was quoted by the United Press as saying,
"It's hard to beleive that there was no sustaining of the
charges at all...the world saw the videotape and if that
conduct is sanctioned by law in California, then we have to
re-write the law".  Exec. Director Ramona Ripston of the
American Civil Liberties Union called the verdicts "a
travesty of justice".
<P>
<HR>
<H3>Response to the Jury Verdict</H3>
According to late afternoon and early evening news reports,
citizens of the Southeast and Southcentral area of Los
Angeles have decided that they can't wait for laws to be
changed.  Reportedly, numerous occasions of rioting, arson,
and looting are taking place at the time of this report. Live
helicopter news reports showed the air over several
neighborhoods appeared to be filled with smoke.  Los Angeles
Fire Department officials report that as many as nine (9)
large stores are burning, and that numerous cars have been
"torched" in an attempt to block intersections.
<P>
<P>

The Los Angeles Police 77th Station is said to have requested
reinforcements due to the violence that is believed sparked
by the police acquittal.  The Cable News Network (CNN)
reported that they had received a report of "white motorists"
being pulled from their cars and "beaten" by a crowd of black
youths.  No official source would confirm the type of
injuries in the area of the disturbance, but an Emergency
Medical Services (EMS) source said that the situation was
"extremely fluid" and that fire department medic units had
been called to several locations.
<P>

A L.A.P.D. police sergeant, who asked not to be identified,
said that the police department was activating a "tactical
recall", which would cancel days off for all police officers
and cause them to immediately report for work.  Officers were
seen at several locations to be wearing the standard "riot
gear" that is used during periods of unrest and to protect
officers was assaults. A Los Angeles Television station
(KTLA) is reporting that few officers were in evidence in the
area of the reported violence and looting, but that they
appeared to be assembling at area police stations.
<P>

As the story continues to unfold, senseless violence seems to
beget senseless violence.  Parker Center in downtown Los
Angeles reportedly has been under "seige" by a large crowd of
protestors since shortly after the jury's announcement.
Several reports of arrests have been received, but most
observers agree that the police officers there appear subdued
and restrained in their actions.  Sporadic events of violence
and arson, in predomantly black neighborhoods, continue to be
reported.
<P>

One witness said that the atmosphere and conditions were
reminiscent of those at the onset of the "Watts Riots" that
shook Los Angeles following the death of Martin Luther King.
City residents are said to be "holding their breath" and
praying that the seemingly isolated "lawlessness" doesn't
spread to engulf the entire city in vengence for the actions
of a jury that made a decision.

<P>
<H2>MAJOR RIOT IN LOS ANGELES, THIRTEEN DEAD, 192 INJURIED</H2>

Los Angeles, CA - Following a jury verdict which acquitted
four L.A.P.D. officers of charges resulting from the video-
taped beating of motorist Rodney King, Southcentral Los
Angeles erupted in a violent and deadly outburst of arson and
shooting. Local police and emergency medical services
officials report the deaths of as many as nine (9) people and
injuries to another 138.
<P>

As the sun rose over Los Angeles, more than forty (40) major
fires still burned out of control. They were part of an
estimated 140 fires that were set in the Southeast and
Southcentral parts of the city.  During the night,
firefighters and paramedics were hardpressed to keep up with
the requests for emergency response to more than 140 fires.
Reportedly, they came under sniper fire on several occasions,
from rooftops surrounding the fire scenes.  One Los Angeles
firefighter is reported in stable, but serious, condition at
an area hospital following his being shot in the face while
fighting a blaze.
<P>

According to a police spokesman at least five (5) people have
been shot by police and one was killed in a gun-battle in the
city's Inglewood area.  A spokesperson for the Daniel Freeman
Hospital says that they have treated at least fifty (50)
citizens with "riot-related" injuries.  Emergency Medical
Services (EMS) officers say that all available city
ambulances are "on calls" and that mutual aid from Los
Angeles County and Orange County has been requested.  At
least 192 people are reported to have been taken to various
hospitals in the L.A. metropolitan area.
<P>

Los Angeles Mayor Thomas Bradley has been following the rsie
of violence and has repeatedly called for calm among the
city's black citizens. Observers report, however, that many
of those participating in looting and arson are not black,
but rather, youths of hispanic and caucasian origin. Reports
were also received that numerous reputed "street gang"
members were seen to be participating in the violence and
shooting.
<P>

Mayor Bradley is said to have declared a local "State Of
Emergency" and requested a California disaster declaration.
Mayor Bradley is also reported to have issued a "dusk to
dawn" curfew which prohibits people from being on the street
during nighttime hours.  He also issued orders prohibiting
the sale of firearms and gasoline (other than into vehicle
tanks) to Los Angeles citizens. The Mayor also announced that
all Catholic and public schools in the Southern part of Los
Angeles have been closed and will not reopen until further
notice.
<P>

According to California Governor Pete Wilson, he has
activated more than 2,000 National Guardsmen to help quell
the rampage in Los Angeles.  The Guardsman are reportedly
members of Military Police Units and are said to be armed
with sidearms and M-16 rifles. Police spokespersons indicate
that the Gueardsmen have not been used for law enforcement
duties, but to secure areas that have been previously
cleared by police. An unidentified Army Sergeant was reported
to have said that the guard is "on stand-by" awaiting the
orders of police officials.
<P>

As the morning progressed, numerous eyewitness reports of
additional looting were seen on KPLA T.V. and the Cable News
Network.  Hundreds of citizens of all colors were seen to be
breaking into stores, almost at will, and leaving with
armloads of merchandise. Several new fires were reported by
the L.A. Fire Dept., these in addition to those that still
burned out of control in several locations.  Fire Chief
Donald Manning appealed to L.A. citizens to discontinue the
practice of assaulting and shooting at firefighters who were
attempting to fight the conflagrations.
<P>

In afternoon developments, the Bank of America is reported to
have been closing all of it's Los Angeles branch banks and
moving money to safer locations, away from the chaos that is
spreading through various neighborhoods.  Other businesses
are said to be closing and boarding up their windows in an
attempt to prevent future looting.  Reports were received
that the crowds of looters were said to be moving into an
area on Hollywood Blvd. and that the thievery seems to be
spreading as the day progresses.
<P>

As lawlessness continued, President George Bush called for
calm and a stop to "anarchy" on the streets of Los Angeles.
He said that he had conferred with U.S. Attorney william
Barr, Mayor Tom Bradley, and Governor Pete Wilson in an
effort to provide whatever assistance might be needed to stop
the senseless arson, violence, and looting. President Bush is
said to have several key staff members monitoring the
situation closely and available to provide federal assistance
should it be needed.
<P>

An unidentified Los Angeles Police officer provided a concise
commentary on the state of affairs in Los Angeles; "Things
are totally out of control here... and we expect it to get
worse when it gets dark...I hope we all live to see
tommorow".

<H2>L.A. INSURRECTION SURPASSES 1965 WATTS RIOTS, 38 DEAD, MORE
THAN 1,200 INJURED</H2>
By: Clark Staten, EMT-P
<P>

Los Angeles, CA - The latest reported deaths in Los Angeles
bring to thirty-eight the total that have been killed as the
result of the fires, riots, and shooting that has plagued
this second largest American city. The death toll has risen
following another night of violence and mayhem that is said,
by some, to be the consequences for the acquittal of four
L.A.P.D. officers in Simi Valley, CA on Wednesday.
<P>

The current totals of dead, injuried and damage done now
exceed those that occured in 1965, when residents of the
Watts section of Los Angeles erupted after the arrest of a
black man by a white highway patrol officer.  Thirty-four
(34) people died in the following six-days of chaos, 1,000
were injuried, and $200 miilion dollars in damage was done.
Older eyewitnesses say that the most current riots far exceed
the days of the Watts riots, both in intensity and level of
violence.
<P>

As 4,000 regular Army troops and 1,000 federal law
enforcement officers move into Los Angeles, people have begun
to actually assess the severity of this latest day of
"revolution". They find thirty-eight (38) people dead, 1,250
people injuried, 3,600 structural fires, hundreds of
businesses looted and closed, and more than 3,000 people
arrested.  At least four (4) police officers and three (3)
firefighters have been shot and hundreds of other injuried as
they attempted to control the fires and lawlessness of the
past three days.
<P>

A "Dusk to Dawn" curfew has been imposed by Mayor Tom
Bradley, in an effort to prevent citizens from congregating
into the groups that have controlled the streets in recent
days.  The curfew also finally has "teeth" as 4,000
California National Guardsmen assist the police in securing
areas of previous violence.  This evening, the National Guard
Units were also "federalized" by President Bush and
supplemented by another 4,000  Army and Marine troops with
orders to act as "Light-Infantry" and to "return fire if
fired upon".
<P>

Reports are received at the time of this report that
authorities may be gaining a tactical advantage and that,
with the help of an added 9,000 law enforcement and military
personnel, the situation may be under control by the weekend.
According to current reports, there have been fewer fires and
shooting incidents since the curfew was instituted on Friday
evening.
<P>

The wave of destruction, which had spread from Southcentral
Los Angeles to Downtown, to Pasadena, to Hollywood, and to
Koreatown, has not always seemed just a response to the
Rodney King verdict.  Often in it's intensity, the "rioting
beast" did not pay attention to the race, color, or creed of
it's victims; it struck indiscriminately.  Early video tapes
of the "rioters" sometimes showed middle class white youths,
street gang members, and those that have been associated with
radical organizations such as the American Communist Party.
<P>

Differing agendas seemed to be "at play" in differing
circumstances.  Much looting appeared to "opportunistic" in
scope and origin.  Entire families were seen working together
to steal from stores in their own neighborhoods.  Often, what
was being stolen was not of any necessity, but rather luxury
items such as designer gym shoes, radios, and starter
jackets.  Frequently, it just appeared that it was those
"without" were taking from those "with", because they could.
<P>

In other situations, the anger and frustration was expressed
by pulling white motorists from cars and trucks and brutally
beating and kicking them. In one such case, Reginald Oliver
Denny, was pulled from his truck as he stopped to prevent
hitting looters who filled the street.   The incident was
captured by a helicopter television news crew as it occured
and was broadcast live.  Some viewers said that the violence
that was portrayed was as "violent and sickening" as any that
occured to Rodney King.  Denny was taken to Daniel Freeman
Hospital after the furious beating, and has been upgraded
from critical to serious, following brain sugery to remove a
blood clot.
<P>

Arson was another way that some people vented their rage of
various kinds.  Fire Chief Donald Manning was quoted as
saying that the Los Angeles Fire Dept. has responded to more
than 3,600 fires in the past three days. Further, he
commented that at given times during the past two days, the
L.A.F.D. was receiving calls for three (3) fires every
minute.  He said that this level of need for service far
exceeded the department's ability to respond and that this
call volume was five (5) times that of normal.
<P>

Manning said that additional fire units were called from all
over California to help fight the conflagrations that spread
through neighborhood after neighborhood.  Efforts were also
reportedly hampered on numerous occasions by sniper fire and
direct confrontations against firefighters.  One firefighter
was quoted as saying yesterday; "I'd feel a lot more secure
if they gave me a rifle".  He was responding to the fact that
at least three firefighters have been reportedly shot while
in the performance of their duties, and that often police
officers were not available to accompany and protect fire
units while they performed their already dangerous duties.
<P>

Los Angeles Police say that the circumstances also
"unleashed" criminals, street gangs, and others who's only
motive in involvement in the riots was that of profit.  They
point out the fact that this was also felt to be the perfect
opportunity to justify acts of violence, by street gang
members, against members of the police department.  Police
Chief Daryl Gates admitted that on several occasions his
forces had also been "overwhelmed" and unable to respond to
even calls for assistance from fellow officers and
firefighters.  This reportedly enabled those that would
engage in revenge against any official agency to feel that
they could do so with impunity.
<P>


As the senseless violence reached it's peak in Los Angeles on
Thursday night, reports began to be received that it had
spread to other cities and states across the country.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>1.   In Northern California, 1,400 people were arrested in
     San Francisco as rioting engulfed the city's downtown
     area. A State of Emergency was declared there and a
     curfew established.
<LI>2.   In Los Vegas, a mob of two-hundred (200) people went on
     a rampage, setting fires, and engaged in sniper fire and
     drive-by shootings.  Local law enforcement officials
     admitted that they were overwhelmed and requested the
     activation of the Nevada National Guard. The Governor
     complied and control has reportedly been somewhat re-
     established.  Reports were received of several arson
     fires.
<LI>(3.) Seattle was struck by mobs of 50-100 people, who
     randomly broke windows and and looted numerous cars in
     downtown Seattle during the night Thursday and early
     Friday.  Police say that forty-five (45) people were
     arrested and five (5) injuried during the violent spree.
     Firefighters responded to twenty-eight (28) fire calls
     during the unrest, including five (5) buildings that
     were termed "suspicious in nature".
<LI>(4.) Further East, Black protestors in New York City
     reportedly pulled two white men from a truck, stabbed
     one and beat the other.  An estimated two-hundred (200)
     protestors attacked the doors at Madison Square Gardens
     causing injuries and property damage.  Another crowd of
     four-hundred (400) black youths reportedly stormed a
     popular shopping mall and smashed windows and stole
     merchandise.  Shops and businesses were damaged as the
     "melee" traveled over several blocks. As many as eighty
     (80) arrests were made and several police officers
     injuried.  Many NYC employers were said to have released
     workers from work early to avoid further occurances.
<LI>(5.) Police in Atlanta, GA were confronted on Friday, by
     hundreds of black protestors.  This followed a night of
     three-hundred (300) arrests and fifty-seven (57)
     injuries. It also prompted the use of teargas and a call
     for the Georgia National Guard to help combat large
     crowds of people looting and throwing rocks and bricks.
     Mayor Maynard Jackson called for calm and understanding,
     as he counselled college students that had originally
     begun peaceful protests which escalated into wide-spread
     violence.
</UL>
<P>
Sporadic acts of violence, arson, and property damage were
also associated with the Los Angeles Riots in such cities as
Tampa, FL, Pittsburg, PA, Birmingham, MS, Omaha, NE, and
several other locations.
<P>

As night settled over several cities, residents took to their
homes, prayed for an end to senseless violence, and waited
for the morning light to see if the fragile peace was to
endure.  Fire, Police, and EMS Officials hoped for even a
brief respite from the constant stress and danger of angry
citizens and harrowing rescues.  Everyone wished that the
madness would be over.

<H2>'Roofies', The New "Date Rape" Drug of Choice</H2>
By Clark Staten, ERRI Executive Director
<P>

Chicago, IL., January 6, 1995 (ENN) --Like the Quaaludes of the
60's and 70's, there is a new "love drug" being abused in
several parts of the country.  The drug is Rohypnol, or
"Roofies" as it being is called on the street. It is also called
"ruffies", "roche", "R-2", "rib" and "rope" and reportedly is
quickly becoming the "date rape drug of choice."
<P>

Rohypnol is a brand name for flunitrazepam (a benzodiazepine), a
very potent tranquilizer similar in nature to valium (diazepam),
but many times stronger. The drug produces a sedative effect,
amnesia, muscle relaxation, and a slowing of psychomotor
responses. Sedation occurs 20-30 minutes after administration
and lasts for several hours. The drug is often distributed on the street in
it's original "bubble packaging" which adds an air of legitimacy
and makes it appear to be legal. The drug is not commonly used
by physicians in the United States and is not even listed in the
commonly used Physician's Desk Reference.
<P>

Illicit use of Rohypnol was originally reported in Europe in the
late 1970's and world-wide use of it has continually increased
since then. According to police sources in both Florida and
Texas, "roofies" were first seen in the United States in the
early 1990's; they quickly gained acceptance and use by both
high school and college students. According to the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) more than 1,000 cases of
illegal Rohypnol possession have been reported recently, in
thirteen states. Reports have also been received of it being
popular in "gay bars" in selected locations on both the East and
West coasts.  In fact, Rohypnol is now being reported as being
one of the "in" drugs on high school and college campuses and
particularly in college fraternities. And to make matters worse,
"Roofies" are inexpensive and reportedly being sold for as
little as $2.00-$4.00 per tablet in several locations.
<P>

According to a University of Florida drug hotline, "Roofies" are
often combined with alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine to produce a
rapid and very dramatic "high".  Even when used by itself, users
can appear extremely intoxicated, with slurred speech, no
coordination, swaying, and blood-shot eyes...with no odor of
alcohol. The drug has been added to punch and other drinks at
fraternity parties and college social gatherings, where it is
reportedly given to female party participants in hopes of
lowered inhibitions and facilitating potential sexual conquest. Police
departments in several parts of the country say that after
ingestion of "Roofies" that several young women have reported
waking up in frat houses with no clothes on, finding themselves
in unfamiliar surroundings with unfamiliar people, or having
actually been sexually assaulted while under the influence of
the drug. 
<P>

As insidious, disgusting and perilous as this may sound, the
dangers don't stop there. Besides the worries of unprotected
sex, Rohypnol, particularly when mixed with alcohol or other
drugs may lead to respiratory depression, aspiration, and even
death. When taken repeatedly, it can lead to physical and
psychic dependence, which is thought to increase with both dose
and duration of use. An amnesia producing effect of "Roofies"
may prevent users from remembering how or why they took the drug
or even that they were given it by others. This makes
investigation of sexually related or other offenses very
difficult and may account for repeated reports of "date rapes"
involving the use of the drug.
<P>

Both law enforcement and drug counseling services caution that
the use of Rohypnol is increasing and that additional quantities
of it are being imported across the Mexican border, where it can
be obtained by prescription. ERRI drug abuse analysts warn that
"Roofies" are  just another in a long list of dangerous drugs
that are being imported and "pushed" to the impressionable youth
of this country.

<H3>THE CHICAGO FIRE DEPARTMENT</H3>
<BR>

The Chicago Fire Department is the largest fire department in the
Midwest region of the United States.  The City of Chicago covers
228 square miles and has a population of just under 3 million.
<P>

The primary responsibility of the CFD includes the obvious
responsibilities of preservation of life and property from
fire, but it is also responsible for the response and mitigation
of hazardous materials and the delivery of Emergency Medical Service.
The Chicago Fire Department operates the largest totally Advanced
Life Support ambulance system in the world.  The fire department
also responds to many other non-fire emergency responses.
<P>

The Chicago Fire Department has the following resources available:
98 Engine Companies, 59 Truck Companies, 4 Squad companies,
24 Battalion Chiefs, 6 Deputy District Chiefs, 59 Ambulance Companies,
1 Fireboat, 5 Command Vans, and a number of other specialized pieces
of Equipment.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>

<H5>
Bureau of Fire Suppression and Rescue</H5>
<BR>
Generally referred to as just, "Suppression," this is the firefighting
force of the department.  Suppression is broken down into six districts
that are each commanded by a District Chief and a Deputy District Chief.
District Chiefs work normal business hours, except when one is assigned
to the "Duty."  When a District Chief is assigned the "Duty" he is on
24-hour call for citywide extra alarm fires and other emergencies.
Deputy District Chiefs work the same type of shift as other members of
subordinate rank in the department.  They work a 24-hour shift and then
are off for 48 hours.
<P>
Districts
<BR>
Each District in the Chicago Fire Department is comprised of four
Battalions.  Each Battalion is commanded by a Battalion Chief.  Each
Battalion is made up of a number of Engine companies and Truck Companies.
Some Battalions have Squad Companies and other miscellaneous units,
such as: chemical units, smoke ejectors, command vans, etc...

<H5>Chicago O'Hare International Airport</H5>
<BR>
Chicago is the home of the "World's Busiest Airport."  O'Hare is located
in the far Northwest portion of the city.  Since many people reading
this on the World Wide Web may, in fact, come through Chicago in their
travels we thought that we would include some information on the
extraordinary and interesting array of specialized fire equipment that
resides at the three Crash stations at the airport.  Presently, the
CFD is not the only fire department at O'Hare.  The United States
Air Force also maintains a large contingent of fire equipment there.
These well trained Air Force Crash teams work very closely with the
units of the 12th Battalion at O'Hare.
<P>

The fire equipment at O'Hare is top-of-the-line and state-of-the-art.
This airport is one of the few airports where commercial pilots feel
very confident about coming to when they have an on-board emergency.
<P>

The following is a list of fire equipment that is stationed at O'Hare:

Battalion Chief 12
<BR>
Engine 9 - 1992 Federal/Emergency One  2000/750/300 with a 50-foot Squrt
<BR>
Engine 10 - identical to Engine 9
<BR>
Tower Ladder 63 - 1988 Federal/Emergency One 95-foot ladder
<BR>
Squad 7 - 1988 Spartan/Super Vac
<BR>
Command Van 2-7-8
<BR>
Ambulance 16
<BR>
Ambulance 26
<BR>
Ambulance 59
<BR>
Aircraft Stairway 6-3-5
<BR>
Crash units: 6-5-1, 6-5-3, 6-5-4, 6-5-5, 6-5-6, 6-5-7, 6-5-8, 6-5-10, 6-5-11
<BR>
<P>
Most of the Crash rigs are Oshkosh T-3000's with 3185 gallons of water
and 420 gallons of foam.  It would take 9555 gallons of water or three
full tanks of water to "eat up" or use up the 420 gallons of foam that is 
carried on-board these rigs.  Units 6-5-1, 6-5-10 and 6-5-11 are reserve
rigs.
<P>
The newest Crash Rig is 6-5-3, which is an Oshkosh T-3000 and is equipped
with a "Snozzle."  A Snozzle is a device that looks like an arm and has
the ability to puncture the thin aluminum skin of an aircraft and inject
foam or water to the inside of the plane.  This Snozzle is also supposed
to be able to be equipped with a television camera that is capable of
seeing inside of the aircraft.
<P>
The United States Air Force has the following equipment assigned to the airport:
<BR>
Chief 2
<BR>
Red 3 - Quality P-2 Crash Rig w/ 2000 gal of water and 205 gal of foam
<BR>
Red 4 - identical to Red 3
<BR>
Red 5 - Ford F350 Rapid Intervention Vehicle. Carries foam products.
<BR>
Red 6 - Chevy C30 Rescue Vehicle
<BR>
Red 8 - Oshkosh P-4 Crash Rig w/ 1500 gal of water and 105 gal of foam
<BR>
Red 9 - Oshkosh P-19 Crash Rig w/ 1000 gal of water and 130 gal of foam
<BR>
Red 11 - Engine company
<BR>

Take all of the firefighting equipment at O'Hare and you have an
impressive armada.
<BR>

Emergency communications at O'Hare is handled by the multi-million
dollar "Command Center" which is a new state-of-the-art communications
and crisis management center that has set a standard for all other
airports, which now model their communications centers after O'Hare.
<P>

Chicago's O'Hare International Airport serves 66 million passengers
every year and has a total of six runways that sit on 7,800 acres --
the acreage is less than half the size of Dallas/Ft. Worth Airport
at 17,520 acres and only one quarter the size of Denver International
Airport at 34,000 acres.

<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H5>Hazardous Materials Response Procedures</H5>
<BR>

The mission of the CFD, in a Hazardous Materials incident, is to
isolate, contain and stabalize hazardous materials until such time
as the proper officials require the owner of the product to properly
dispose of the material.
<P>

Hazardous materials are defined as: any explosive, flammable, oxidizer,
poison, etiologic agent, radioactive, corrosive or other substance or
material, in a quantity or form that may pose an unreasonable risk to
health, safety and the environment.
<P>

Response
<BR>

Level 1 = Is the minimum initial response to any suspected or potential
Hazardous Materials incident.  This level is primarily for investigative
activities and/or to mitigate incidents involving small quantities or
low potential materials.  A Level 1 HazMat response consists of:
one battalion chief, one engine, one truck, one ambulance and a HIT
task force of: one squad and the Hazardous Materials Squad 5-1-1.
<P>

Level 2 = Is a confirmed incident involving a moderate or high potential
and/or a large quantity of material; or an incident requiring protective
clothing above Level D (Structural firefighting clothes); or an incident
requiring the need to initiate an evacuation.  A Level 2 HazMat response
consists of the following units: one Deputy District Chief, one HIT
Task Force Team engine, one HIT Task Force Team truck, one Safety Officer,
one EMS Field Officer, one Air Mask Support Vehicle and one command van.
<P>

Level 3 = Level 3 HazMat incidents are rarely called.  This would be

<p align=center><font size=5>HOW A MISSILE MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT DOWN TWA FLT 800 </font><br>
By: Ron Lewis<br>
CHIEF MILITARY &amp; AVIATION ANALYST <br>
THE INTELLIGYST GROUP</p>
<p align=left>Information just received indicates the FBI is enhancing its search for boat operators in the area of the TWA 747 
downing on 17 July 96 near Long Island, New York. This would imply that they may believe strongly in the 
likelihood that a surface- to-air missile downed the jet. It may also mean nothing more than that they are trying to 
cover all bases in the investigation, which is wise at this point.<br>
<br>
If this incident was the result of a missile attack, there are some interesting aspects of the wreckage and the nature of 
the 747 that would possibly fit such a scenario.<br>
<br>
1) Wreckage of the tail section shows no burns or soot, indicating it separated early in the event. A photo of the 
lower section of the vertical stabilizer does show, however a crease in the leading edge and numerous small chips 
and dings in the surface paint (black &amp; white photo precludes examination of white undercoat or bare metal in red 
surface) that seem to splay backward and upward. This is similar to the type of damage seen in photos of aircraft 
struck by small, shoulder-fired, IR-guided surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) of the SA-7/14/16/18 
GRAIL/GREMLIN/GIMLET/GROUSE and FIM-92 Stinger types.<br>
<br>
2) The left wingtip, including the area which should have the extended range fuel tank, shows no evidence of fire as 
well. If the engines on the left side had been hit, the fuel tank would likely have suffered a fire before the tail 
separated. There is no evidence this occurred.<br>
<br>
3) Infrared-guided (popularly described as heat-seeking) missiles home in on hot metal and exhaust gases from 
engines, and the 747 has four main engines, two on each wing. However, most people do not realize that there is a 
smaller jet engine housed in the rear of the fuselage tail section, with an exhaust port at the very tip. This small turbine 
engine is the Auxiliary Power Unit or APU.<br>
<br>
4) Of the many missiles listed above, only the SA-14 GREMLIN/ SA-16 GIMLET/ SA-18 GROUSE are likely to 
have had the range and altitude capability to reach the altitude the 747 was traveling at the time it was lost, with the 
SA-18 having the best chance, but any of them could have conceivably been the weapon, assuming that a SAM was 
involved.<br>
<br>
5) If an IR SAM were used, wouldn't it head for the main engines? Yes, but the hot effluent from four engines, as 
well as the heat from the APU port would trail behind the target and guide the missile toward the aircraft center. The 
APU is not likely to have been operating, as it provides ground power, but the aircraft was caught on the ground for 
an extended period of time, with the APU running virtually the entire time. It would have had only something near 30 
minutes to cool down before the incident and is likely to have still been emanating IR energy.<br>
<br>
6) A SAM fired in this scenario would have to have been mounted on or fired from a boat or other platform out on 
the water. Spetsnaz special forces have been known be equipped with a remote-controlled launcher which responds 
to certain levels of jet noise. Is it possible that a platform positioned directly under an aircraft flight path might have 
launched such a missile? Is it also possible that this so-called platform might be designed to self-destruct to hide 
evidence, or could be under the debris of a crashing jet? Hard to tell but not too impossible to consider. It is 
interesting that there seems to have been no concern over any boats lost at sea that night, despite the fact that 
numerous boats were reported in the area and could have been victims of the crash debris. The FBI is reportedly 
looking for small boats from Long Island but perhaps the search should be widened to include not only docks in the 
northeast United States but others coming from further north or south. If this was the method of attack, the boat 
would probably be large enough to hide the backblast and flare of initial launch in a hold or cabin space below deck. 
The perpetrators would also want a vessel large enough and fast enough to be ocean-going and capable of running 
from pursuit craft.<br>
<br>
7) My preliminary research of photos of the retrieved wreckage indicates that the tail section separated early in the 
event. My first assumption is that a bomb on board the aircraft, either in the rear lavatory or possibly in the rear 
cargo hold, detonated, fatally weakening the rear fuselage and blowing the tail off. Structural failure of this kind, 
particularly with some of the blast vented out through the exit doors on either side of the rear fuselage, could cause 
severe structural collapse without venting bomb fragments or residue into the bodies of victims seated forward of the 
rear lavatory. The explosive decompression which would result from this scenario would blow shoes and other 
clothing off of the victims and, indeed, we have reports of several bodies found nude and virtually all without shoes.<br>
<br>
8) A small IR-guided missile would damage or destroy an engine but the hot fragments would likely ignite an 
immediate fireball. This is not reported to have happened until the aircraft split into large chunks. A hit on one of the 
four engines (a 747 is capable of flying with only two engines) would not disable communications and the pilots 
would likely have enough time to issue a call for help, announce an emergency, etc. Removal of the tail section, 
however, would cut links to the VOR radio antenna mounted atop the vertical stabilizer.<br>
<br>
9) But IR missiles go after IR energy, common associated with heat. Why wouldn't it go after one of the engines? It 
would, but if it was approaching from the rear, it would encounter a large volume of hot gas trailing behind the 
aircraft. This would be the first thing to home in on, and it would likely be concentrated in the slipstream behind the 
tail. The next thing the missile seeker might focus on is the hot metal of the just-operated APU exhaust, so it probably 
would home in on the CENTER of the aircraft. At this point, however, it would now likely be close enough to pick 
up the much greater IR energy emanating from the exhausts of the main engines. If homed in on the centerline of the 
aircraft and equally influenced by two engines on either side, the missile might not have been able to discriminate 
between the two similar sources and &quot;decide&quot; on a course before its own self-destruct mechanism came into play and 
detonated the missile toward the rear fuselage. Fragments detonated by the &quot;grazing fuse&quot; (one of two, the other 
being a contact fuse) would be likely to travel in a 360-degree sphere. It is unlikely that any of these fragments would 
penetrate deeply enough through the lower fuselage to impact any bodies and leave telltale signs of blast fragments, 
burn marks or chemical residue. This may be one reason why investigators are so puzzled by the condition of the 
bodies recovered thus far.<br>
<br>
10) One of the flap track fairings has a hole punched into it from the bottom. This is WELL aft of the engines, 
meaning that something punched through the fairing but it is not likely to have been fragments of a disabled engine. It 
is also possible that this damage is post-event damage due to contact with other wreckage, but the type of damage 
appears to be something other than post-event damage.<br>
<br>
11) In addition to the nicks and dings in the paint of the tail pieces recovered, the left wingtip has a revealing gash, as 
though something cut through the tip. This could, of course, be post-event damage related to contact with other 
debris, but it may bear closer examination, to determine whether or not something sliced through it in the air.<br>
<br>
Could a missile have detonated below, above, or off to one side of the aircraft, disabling the wing, damaging the tail, 
or compromising the fuselage integrity? There is simply not enough evidence on which to base an informed opinion at 
this point.<br>
<br>
In fact, all of the above information is hypothetical and should be considered very preliminary, more along the lines of 
an educated guess. The intent here is not to provide conclusive answers but to examine the known facts and 
eyewitness accounts, and to try to &quot;brainstorm&quot; the event to see if a SAM scenario is plausible, based upon the 
known capabilities of that class of weapon.<br>
<br>
Iran or their proxies in the Hizbollah movement remain high on the list of possible culprits. In addition, investigators 
should also look at Iraq, for obvious reasons and at Syria, Iran, Libya and even possibly Cuba or Serbia. In recent 
weeks, the United States has imposed increased economic sanctions on Iran and Libya, as well as Cuba. Syria has 
been threatened with sanctions and Bosnian Serb leader Radocan Karadzic has been forced from power based 
upon American pressure.<br>
<br>
A recent terrorism conference in Tehran, however, puts Iran at the top of the list. Hizbollah guerrillas are the most 
likely suspects as the agents who would actually carry out any attack on US targets. In early May, I submitted an 
article to several newspapers, stating that Hizbollah guerrillas would strike at the US and US interests in retaliation 
for the United States' sole support of Israel in the wake of the massacre of civilians at the UN compound in Qana, 
southern Lebanon.<br>
<br>
To date, the San Diego Union-Tribune, Los Angeles Times, New York Times and USA TODAY have all failed to 
act on this op-ed piece warning of increased threat to US citizens and personnel. I believe that the Dhahran bombing 
in Saudi Arabia and the downing of Flight 800 may be connected. If so, there will be more such attacks in the very 
near future, not just in the US and not necessarily involving aircraft only. In addition to the Olympics in Atlanta, 
federal authorities should examine the possibility of strikes against the upcoming Democratic Convention in Chicago 
and the Republican Convention in San Diego.<br>

<p>07/23/96 - <strong>Instant Update</strong></p>
<p><font size=4><strong>SWEDISH BOFORS RBS 70</strong></font><br>
By: Ron Lewis, Intelligyst Group<br>
<br>
In all of the talk about Stingers and their Russian counterparts, everybody seems to have forgotten that they are 
IR-guided and are most usually operated in daylight. Since there is little evidence to suggest that the 747's engines 
were struck by a small IR-homing SAM (considering the rapid manner in which the aircraft broke up), I began to 
think about other possibilities.<br>
<br>
1) There was reportedly little or no smoke observed: The RBS 70 is virtually smokeless but could leave a faint trail 
of vapor in humid air.<br>
<br>
2) No engines or hot areas seem to have been hit: This would be a prerequisite for an IR-guided missile but the RBS 
70 is laser-homing.<br>
<br>
3) Stinger/SA-14 weapons have very small warheads with a poor history of actually downing fighter aircraft. They 
have damaged aircraft, disabled one of two engines, etc, but they often do not cripple the aircraft mortally. As a 
result, their small warheads would be likely to bring down a target as big as a 747 this quickly. The RBS 70, on the 
other hand, has a 1 Kg to 1+ Kg warhead with a shaped charge of high explosive fragmentation that is actually 
armor-piercing. This charge is surrounded by tungsten pellets and, upon detonation, showers the target with 3000 
tungsten fragments<br>
<br>
Although the RBS 70 is said to have a max altitude of 4000m, it also has a range of 6000-7000 meters. I believe a 
trade-off between the two would enable it to reach an aircraft at 13,700 feet if fired almost directly underneath as a 
theory involving a boat launch would assume. Further, there is a follow-on design known as the RBS 90. One would 
expect this to have increased range and capability.<br>
<br>
4) The RBS 70 (and, it would stand to reason, any follow-on design like an RBS 90) is in the hands of Iran, Pakistan 
and Bahrain, among others. Iran used the RBS 70 to good effect during the latter half of the Iran-Iraq War, downing 
as many as 45 Iraqi jets and helos.<br>
<br>
Contact of any SAM with the engines would be likely to knock out one and start a fire that might, eventually, lead to 
breakup of the aircraft, but there are three other engines which would continue to supply power for communications 
and so on. However, a laser-homing missile, striking the aft fuselage would crack the pressurized hull, cause 
explosive decompression, compromise overall structural integrity, and possibly cause the loss of the tail section which 
contains the VOR antenna for comm. Rapid loss of pressure and catastrophic loss of the tail section would result in 
an instant communications loss, lack of directional and atitudinal stability, and cause the aircraft to nose down in a 
spiral as wwas reported. Tail section components and the left wingtip section where the extended range fuel tank 
was are all free of soot, scorching or other evidence of fire, indicating they may have detached before the plunge 
through the fireballs from leaks in the wing fuel supplies. As the wings ruptured on the way down, raw fuel would 
spew back toward hot metal and live electrical connections that were severed but still emanated electrical power 
from the still-operating engines. This electrical spark would definitely be enough to trigger detonation of the raw fuel.<br>
<br>
Regardless of whether this was the result of a missile or a device on board, the explosion most likely occurred in the 
rear of the aircraft, most likely on the underside where fragments, gases and chemical traces were confined under the 
floors or behind walls of storage spaces and the rear lavatory complex. The aft cargo hold and rear lavatory complex 
would be the two areas I would suggest focusing on. This would explain the condition of the victims found thus far, 
with no burns, chemical residue or fragments, and the absence of shoes and clothing which were likely blown off 
during explosive decompression over 10,000 feet<br>
<br>
In 1985, a Japan Air Lines Boeing 747 suffered severe decompression and loss of hydraulic lines due to a faulty aft 
pressure bulkhead. Even so, the aircraft was able to remain aloft until hydraulics were bled dry. It subsequently 
crashed into a mountain some HOURS later. Mere decompression would not cause the catastrophic failure 
witnessed. You would have to have some external compromise of structural integrity, whether from an 
outward-moving explosion tearing through the bottom of the aft fuselage, or a missile detonation exploding it inward. 
In both cases, the outer skin would be broken, the pressure vessel inside would be ruptured, and the aircraft would 
not survive long.<br>

<font color="#FF0000"><font size=5><strong>747 Reportedly Explodes Near Moriches Bay, NY</strong></font></font><br>
<br>
ENN is receiving preliminary reports regarding the &quot;explosion&quot; and crash of a TWA 747, Flight #800, enroute to 
Paris, France from Kennedy Airport. It is believe to be in the water approximately 10 miles south of Moriches Bay 
in Suffolk County, NY. A major sea rescue is underway, including 6 Coast Guard Helicopters and Coast Guard 
Cutters. Private craft are also assisting in the rescue. <br>
<br>
As many as 229 souls were believed to be on-board the ill-fated flight. Bodies of victims are being seen in the water 
and reported by marine radio. Requests are going out for additional assistance. ENN is gathering more information 
from the scene and will provide it as soon as possible. Speculation is centering on a &quot;major explosion&quot; and/or 
possible terrorist act. <br>

<br>
According to NYC and Suffolk County Emergency Service sources, TWA #800 reportedly was at 8,000 ft. when it 
disappeared off the radar. Time of the crash was put at 20:40EDT. Wreakage is thought to be in approximately 100 
ft. of water and the water temperature in the area is 70 degrees F. According to Suffolk County police sources, no 
survivors have been located as of the time of this report. Several bodies are thought to have been recovered. Special 
dive teams have been dispatched by the NYC Police Department, the Coast Guard, and several local area rescue 
agencies. Rescue efforts continue at this hour.<br>
<br>
FBI, ATF, and NTSB officials are reportedly enroute or at the scene, and special evidence recovery teams are being 
sent to the scene. President Clinton has been notified of the incident by SecTrans Pena and a press conference 
previosuly scheduled for 22:15CDT was cancelled pending further developments. <br>

<p align=left>Proven to be highly effective in the hands of Muhajadeen Guerrillas, during their insurgency against the Soviets in 
Afghanistan, the Stinger is a man-portable infra-red guided shoulder-launched Surface-To-Air missile (SAM). Its 
maximum effective range is approximately 5,500 meters. Its maximum effective altitude is approx.15,750 ft. It can be<br>
used to target high-speed jets or helicopters.</p>
<hr>
<p align=center><img src="Sa-7.gif" align=bottom width=290 height=91></p>
<p align=left>Sold by the thousands after the fall of the former Soviet Union, the SA-7 &quot;Grail&quot; uses an optical sight and tracking 
device with Infra-Red seeking mechanism to strike flying targets with great force. Its maximum effective range is 
approx. 6,125 meters and maximum effective altitude is approximately 12,900 ft. It is known to be in the stockpiles 
of terrorist and guerrilla groups.</p>
<hr>
<p align=left><font size=5>Nature of the Threat; ERRI Warnings</font></p>
<p align=left>Counter-terrorist analyst and operatives have long feared that military man-portable SAMs could be used to target 
civilian airliners. Concerns have previously been raised about the availability of these weapons on the black market 
and in covert weapons circles. Literally thousands of them may be available for purchase in the Mid-East, Western 
Asia, and Eastern Europe. Some are surplus from Afghanistan and others may be from the disbanded/surplus military 
stock of parts of the former USSR.</p>
<p align=left>The Emergency Response &amp; Research Institute (ERRI) has previously reported (1992) that it could be relatively 
easy for a single terrorist or small group of dedicated terrorists to drive to a secluded area near an airport and 
effectively &quot;shoot-down&quot; an aircraft as it took-off and started to climb out of restricted airspace. Near several 
domestic airports in the United States, there are numerous geographical positions that could place a terrorist within 
the effective range of a Stinger or Grail surface-to-air missile.</p>

<font size=5><strong>JETLINER EXPLODES OVER NEW YORK'S LONG ISLAND ...</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
NEW YORK CITY (ENN) - A TWA jumbo jet to exploded over the Atlantic Ocean shortly after takeoff on 
Wednesday evening. All 229 people aboard were killed. On Thursday morning, recovery operations had pulled 
about 73 bodies out of the water. Many of the bodies were said to have been badly burned.<br>
<br>
TWA Flight 800, a Boeing 747, was bound for Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris from John F. Kennedy 
International Airport in New York City. The plane, according to many eyewitnesses, exploded at about 2045 EDT 
and plunged into the ocean off Fire Island, which is a narrow strip of land 40 miles east of New York City that runs 
parallel to Long Island.<br>
<br>
Wreckage and fuel on the water burned for several hours as U.S. Coast Guard helicopters and U.S. Navy planes 
hovered and flew over the crash site. Seven Coast Guard cutters and ten smaller vessels were rushed to the scene. 
They were joined by numerous other boats. Crews used night vision goggles to help spot bodies and debris.<br>
A Suffolk County, New York, official said, &quot;Some bodies appear to have been badly burned and charred.&quot;<br>
<br>
Though there is no evidence as of yet, but speculation turned to the possibility of a terrorist incident. An FBI 
spokesman said, &quot;It's too early to tell if it's a bomb.&quot; However, a high-ranking police source at the Port Authority of 
New York and New Jersey told CBS News that officials suspected foul play.<br>
<br>
All of the eyewitnesses told virtually the same story. One man who was fishing at the time of the crash said, &quot;It 
started off like a little ball, like a flare. It came down for a few seconds and all of a sudden burst into flames, a big 
ball of flame.&quot; Another man said, &quot;I saw a big fireball with pieces coming off of it. I heard two big explosions, like 
two big firecrackers going off.&quot; A colonel with the New York Air National Guard was flying in a cargo plane about 
ten miles away when he saw the explosion. He told, &quot;I saw two large orange fireballs. They looked like comets, 
coming straight down into the water.&quot;<br>
<br>
A woman described what she saw, by saying, &quot;There was a loud explosion, which was followed by a fireball. The 
plane literally dropped out of the sky ... and it hit the ocean, sort of like the space shuttle did, and there were five 
more explosions.&quot;<br>
<br>
According to a TWA vice president, there were 212 passengers and 17 crew members on the flight. The plane had 
arrived from Athens, Greece and had been on the ground at JFK Airport for about three hours before it was 
scheduled for a 2000 EDT takeoff for Paris. The vice president also said that the Federal Aviation Administration 
had been placed on an increased level of security because of the upcoming Olympic Games which are to begin on 
Friday in Atlanta. But, he said, there have been no specific threats made against TWA.<br>
<br>
The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash along with the terrorism task force, which 
includes members of the FBI, the New York City Police Department and several other federal law enforcement 
agencies.<br>
<br>
Buck Revell, a former FBI terrorism expert, said that such a jet had never been destroyed in the air by an explosion 
that was not sabotage. Vincent Cannistrano, a former CIA counterterrorism expert, said that if it was a bomb &quot;this is 
another notch up the ladder of terrorism ... in the past year domestic aviation security has been tightened 
considerably.&quot; He said that terrorists have never blown up an airliner with a bomb planted in the U.S.<br>
<br>
In Atlanta, a retired FAA spokesman Jack Barker said that it was quite likely a bomb had been placed aboard the 
aircraft. He said, &quot;You don't want to speculate about what has happened until the NTSB and the FBI have made 
their investigation, but it certainly is reminiscent of the Lockerbie explosion and in the realm of speculation. The 
explosion in the air, the fire -- there had to be some kind of ignition in the air, and that could be caused by only a 
very few things. A bomb being on board could be one of them. The other has already been ruled out by the FAA -- 
a collision with another aircraft. Aside from those two things, for anything else to cause an explosion would be very, 
very rare.&quot;<br>
<br>
Robert Kupperman, senior advisor to the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and 
well-known terrorism expert, said that he noted several pieces of evidence that make him believe that this was a 
likely terrorist bombing. He said the signs indicating a terrorist incident were: All of the eyewitnesses describing a 
fireball and subsequent explosion; It was a U.S. aircraft enroute to Europe; Terrorists in late June attacked a U.S. 
military facility in Saudi Arabia; And the Summer Olympic Games are starting this week in Atlanta.<br>
<br>
Kupperman said, &quot;The potential, especially with the interest in disruption of the peace process in the Mideast, plus 
normal stability problems, makes me quite suspicious. There's motivation, wherewithal and technical means to carry 
out an attack.&quot;<br>
<br>
A counterterrorism task force from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New York Police Department will 
lead an investigation into the air crash. But officials were not saying that this was an act of terrorism as of yet. In a 
statement, the FBI said, &quot;While the FBI/NYPD Joint Terrorist Task Force is not prepared to declare the incident to 
be terrorist-related, the investigation will be conducted by the task force. Based upon the FBI's jurisdiction under 
federal law, the FBI/NYPD Joint Terrorist Task Force will assume leadership of the investigation into the 
circumstances surrounding the possible explosion which occurred on TWA Flight 800.&quot;<br>
<br>
Other law enforcement agencies that are included in the task force are: the U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Customs 
Service, the INS, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and other local agencies.<br>
<br>
Internationally, the government of South Korea quickly tightened security checks for flights to and from the United 
States. A police official in Seoul said, &quot;In view of the possiblity of a terrorist attack on the airliner, we have decided 
to strengthen security drills at the airport, particularly flights to and from the United States. Tighter security checks 
would continue until the end of the Olympics.&quot;<br>
<br>
In Pakistan, security at the country's main Karachi international airport was tightened. An official said that all fights, 
particularly coming from and leaving for New York were being checked throughly.<br>

<font size=5><strong>THE LONG LIST OF SUSPECTS ...</strong></font><br>
<font size=4>Possible Theory of Motivation</font><br>
<br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
As the investigation into the cause of the downing of TWA Flight 800 continues, those who are officially in charge 
say the same thing while the cameras and microphones are on -- they say that they are &quot;keeping an open mind.&quot; 
However, sources say that once the lights for the cameras are off, those same officials are telling a different story.<br>
<br>
ENN is hearing a lot of rumbling from the intelligence community. Overseas, operatives for the U.S. Central 
Intelligence Agency (CIA) have been extremely busy. It is known that the CIA has sent secret communiqu&eacute;s to its 
foreign stations requesting that intelligence officers check their street level sources for any leads. The Athens 
international airport, where the plane for TWA Flight 800 had originated from, has been checked for possible 
security breaches. The names of all the passengers who flew on the Athens-to-New York leg, as well as everyone 
who boarded the airliner in New York have been run through computer databanks for any known links to terrorist 
groups.<br>
<br>
U.S. intelligence agencies aren't the only ones who are being kept busy. Assisting U.S. intelligence are the Israeli, the 
Egyptian and the Jordanian intelligence services. The CIA has been chasing down a large number of leads. They've 
looked into the possibility of a disgruntled airline employee may have planted a bomb. They have also looked into the 
possibility of involvement by Colombian drug cartels.<br>
<br>
But as investigators and analysts are sifting through the piles of intelligence -- the focus seems to keep coming up to a 
possible Middle East connection.<br>
<br>
U.S. diplomats, in recent years, have been saying that they are very concerned about the intensity of anti-American 
resentment in Arab countries. Much of the resentment and anger comes from the support that the U.S. gives to the 
state of Israel. Since the early 1980's, the United States has been forced to close several of its embassies in the Arab 
world. Closed have been the embassies in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Libya and Sudan.<br>
<br>
The other embassies in the Middle East have been turned into fortresses. Whenever the U.S. ambassador to 
Lebanon has to travel through the streets of Beirut, he is protected by a military convoy. Parts of the Embassy in 
Cairo are said to be able to withstand the effects of a nuclear bomb.<br>
<br>
One U.S. official, who is stationed in the Middle East, said, &quot;It has been a long time since I have seen such strong 
anti-American feelings in the Middle East.&quot;<br></p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>Possible Perpetrators of Attacks on America</strong></font></p>
<p><font size=4><strong>Yousef</strong></font></p>
<p>All of the above preamble is important as we look at the list of possible suspects. Among the more serious 
candidates are supporters of Ramzi Yousef, who is currently on trial in New York City. Yousef is described as a 
new breed of Islamic zealot. He was trained during the Afghan War and was captured and extradited to the United 
States from Pakistan in 1995. His trial in federal court is now into its eighth week. Many counterterrorism experts 
feel that supporters of Yousef are very good suspects. They have the motive, the know-how and the means.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>Hizbollah</strong></font></p>
<p>Next on the list is the pro-Iranian Hizballah guerrilla organization. Hizballah has restricted its operations to southern 
Lebanon and to Israel, but some U.S. analysts say that Hizballah may now be seeking the extract revenge on the 
U.S. for supporting Israel. They certainly have the motive and probably the know-how, but what about the means?<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>al-Gama'a al-Islamiya</strong></font></p>
<p>Another contender is the Egyptian terrorist organization known as al-Gama'a al-Islamiya (Islamic Group or IG). 
They have a very good motive. The U.S. has imprisoned their spiritual leader, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman. Rahman 
was convicted in 1995 for plotting to bomb the United Nations and several other New York landmarks. He is 
currently serving a life sentence in a federal prison in Springfield, Missouri. This group, again, most certainly has a 
strong motive. They have connections in New York. They have the know-how. And they may have the means to be 
able to pull off such a plot. This group is a very strong suspect.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>Hamas</strong></font></p>
<p>Also on the list is the HAMAS terrorist organization. HAMAS has reportedly vowed to attack the U.S. for agreeing 
to extradite a known terrorist by the name of Musa Abu Marzouk to Israel. Again, this case also has a New York 
connection, because Marzouk was arrested at John F. Kennedy International Airport, last year. And was held and 
faced extradition hearings in New York. HAMAS is known to have strong connections in the U.S.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>Islamic Movement For Change </strong></font>(Saudi Splinter Groups)</p>
<p>The only group known to claim any responsibility is the shadowy group known as the Islamic Movement for Change. 
This group, if it is a group, is said to have ties in Saudi Arabia. They have also claimed responsibility for the 
bombings of the U.S. facilities in Riyadh in November 1995 and in Dhahran on 25 June 1996. Little is currently 
known about the Islamic Movement for Change.<br></p>
<p><font size=4><strong>Independent 'Sapper Squads'<br>
<br>
</strong></font><font size=3>In keeping with recent patterns of terrorism, ERRI analysts suggest that it is likely that the perpetrators of a number 
of recent acts against the United States, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other allies consisted of a specially put together 
&quot;cells&quot; of terrorist specialists that were brought together just for the purposes of each individual act and then 
disbanded to their host countries. It is also likely that the &quot;specialist&quot; are of a similar extremist ideological./religious 
bent and may act in manner consistent with previously identifed &quot;mercenary groups&quot;, even though they are not 
committing the acts for money. While they may be financially supported, equipped, and motivated by a &quot;sponsor 
country&quot; or countries, no direct ties can be drawn to any single state. This kind of compartmentalization makes 
capture of the terrorists difficult and placing direct responsiblity for the act even more troublesome.</font></p>
<p>Any of the above suspects are a possibility. But behind the terrorist organization there most probably is the specter 
of a certain foreign government that is known to sponsor, finance and assist a number of Islamic extremist groups 
who are viewed to be determined to oppose the presence of the United States in the Middle East. We, of course, 
are talking about leader of state-sponsored terrorism, the outlaw state of Iran.</p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>Motivation--Attempt to Destabilize Peace and Influence American Elections??</strong></font><br>
<br>
In a meeting with ERRI counterterrorist analysts on Tuesday, a theory was brought up by the author of this article. 
One of the questions that must be asked is: If this was a terrorist bombing, why was it done? Some of the above 
groups have very good motives. But let's say the bombing was done by supporters for Ramzi Yousef or by 
al-Gama'a al-Islamiya. It would be expected that a message would be sent saying: &quot;The bombing was done because 
you put Yousef on trial -- that'll teach you Americans.&quot; Or &quot;This is retaliation for convicting our great spiritual leader 
Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman. Let him go or we'll blow up another plane.&quot; But no such messages have been received 
-- as far as we know. Why bomb the plane without telling the world why you did it?<br>
<br>
No, the motivation may be deeper than that. A motivation that isn't necessary to send a message about.<br>
<br>
Let's look what has happened in Israel in recent months. Israel now has a new prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. 
It has been widely said, and former Prime Minister Shimon Peres has confirmed, that the reason why Peres lost his 
re-election bid was over the subject of security for the state of Israel. In the months leading up to the Israeli election, 
Israel became the target of a number of terrorist bombings.<br>
<br>
Shimon Peres was pushing the peace process between Israel and its Arab neighbors very hard. But the militant 
forces in the Muslim world, led by Iran, wanted to kill the peace process in any way that they could. Helping to 
defeat Peres in the Israeli election by working on the fears of the Israeli public was step one -- and it worked.<br>
<br>
Step two is the upcoming November elections in the United States. President Bill Clinton is a huge supporter of the 
Middle East peace process. In order to really derail the peace process, the defeat of Clinton would be in the best 
interest of Iran and its Islamic followers.<br>
<br>
If creating fear in the minds of Israelis worked, why wouldn't the same terrorist campaign work in the U.S? Stage a 
number of attacks against the U.S. and make it appear that President Clinton is ineffectual and can do nothing to stop 
the attacks. Make it appear that Americans are no longer safe to fly on a passenger plane -- make it appear that the 
Clinton administration is unable to keep Americans safe.<br>
<br>
Once Clinton is out of office -- the Middle East peace process really comes to a screeching halt. The Iranians, in the 
past, were smart enough to help defeat President Carter in 1980 by holding American hostages for 444 days in 
Tehran. So, the Iranians are politically savvy enough to pull off such a plan.<br>
<br>
If this theory is true, there are many dangers ahead. First, ENN has received intelligence that another Iranian 
sponsored terrorist conference was due to begin on 21 July 1996. It is being said that leaders and representatives of 
the world's leading terror organizations are attending this second known conference.<br>
<br>
Certain acts may take place in the coming weeks. A very good confirmation of this theory will probably occur 
around the time of the upcoming political conventions in August. It may also be expected that a series of acts against 
the U.S. will probably take place just before the November elections. If these events come to pass, this theory is 
ssentially confirmed; if not...it was just that...a theory. This remains to be seen.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>Retaliation; Military Action?</strong></font></p>
<p>Another issue that may become apparent is; What would the United States do if it were to obtain evidence that 
confirms that Iran was involved and responsible? What would the response of the U.S. be? A simple 
recommendation would probably be to bomb the military and intelligence headquarters' in Tehran, Iran. However, 
the problem would arise that Iran and its surrogates would then up the ante and retaliate with more terrorist attacks 
against U.S. interests. In that case, the U.S. would need to be prepared to go to war. But in an election year? That 
scenario is most improbable.<br>
<br>
The more likely response, though probably not the most satisfying, is that the U.S. will present its evidence to the 
United Nations and then attempt to obtain the harsh economic sanctions that it has been attempting to impose on the 
rogue state Iran for quite a while now. The U.S. would be desirous of putting Iran amongst the pariah states of Iraq 
and Libya. This would probably be the safest course of action.</p>

<H3>Streptococcus A - Necrotizing Fascitis</H3>
<P>
             By Amy Grant, Medical Correspondent
<P>

Chicago,, IL, June 15, 1994 --Five separate cases of the now infamous
"flesh-eating disease" have been reported in the United States
in recent days.  The latest case was reported in Denver, CO,
where an unidentified woman is recovering from surgery to
amputate her left arm and breast.  Her identity is being
withheld upon request of her family. She is among those that
have fallen prey to a little know, but very virulent form of a
disease that normally only causes "sore throats".
<P> 

The Streptococcus A bacteria is a mutated strain of one that
commonly causes "Strep Throat", a disease that seemingly passes
through our school systems every Spring and Fall. But, this
mutated strain takes a far great toll on it's sufferers.
Unconfirmed reports in recent days include the deaths of eleven
(11) people in Great Britain, and three deaths in the United
States.  It's latest victim is a 33 year old Michigan man, who
succumbed to the disease on June 9,1994.
<P>  

Medical authorities, however, point out that this latest
"outbreak" is nothing new to medical science.  They say that as
many as 15,000 people suffer from this more serious form of
Streptococcus A each year, but that it hasn't received the media
coverage that it presently is being afforded. They also point
out that it is difficult to ascertain if there is an increase in
the number of cases, because most states do not require
reporting of Streptococcus A infections. One emergency physician
from Colorado said that people die everyday from a variety of
infections, but that we don't pay them the attention that is
being given the so-called "fleshing eating bacteria".
<P>

In fact, the Streptococcus A bacteria isn't "flesh eating"; it
does produce toxins that deprive the cells of much needed
oxygen.  Ms. Sharon Wanglin, of the Los Angeles Dept. of Health,
is quoted by the Reuters News Service as saying that "it's not
something that people should be lying awake...worrying
about...it's just a complication that crops up
occasionally...it's not something that we need to emphasize".
<P> 

Doctors say that they are currently experimenting with several
different treatment regimes',  but that the most favorable
treatments seem to include the use of a variety of antibiotics,
large amounts of intravenous fluids, and treatment in a
hyperbaric chamber.  Although controversial in some circles,
hyperbaric oxygen (commonly used to treat scuba divers with "the
bends') has seemed an essential part of the successful
resolution of Streptococcus A.
<P>  

According to Dr. Keith van Meter, of the Jo Ellen Smith Medical
Center in New Orleans, the hyperbaric chamber forces oxygen into
compromised cells and tissue, thus allowing the normal function
of white blood cells that fight the infection.  Doctors in New
Orleans and elsewhere have been experimenting with the use of
the Hyperbaric Oxygen to treat patients with gangrene and other
infectious disorders, often with success.
<P> 

Doctors also point out that Streptococcus A is not infectious in
what is thought of as the traditional sense.  It can not be
spread by airborne dispersion, touching, or through fecal
matter. It can, however, be spread by transmission of blood or
body fluids. Emergency medical providers say that they can
prevent the transmission of the disease by use of what are
called "universal precautions", or the use of gloves, masks, and
standard sanitary procedures.

<P>

<H2>"KIDS WITH NO HOPE, NO FEAR, NO RULES, AND NO LIFE EXPECTANCY"...
</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>
<B>The Statistics</B>
<P>
There is a bitter battle over how to combat the nation's fastest-growing crime problem -- juvenile offenders.  While overall crime statistics in America's largest cities has dropped, there is one category where it has skyrocketed. That category is homicides committed by youths under the age of 17.  Between 1984 and 1994, murders committed by youths under 17 tripled.  Demographic studies show that there will be a surge in the teen population in the coming years and experts believe that 25 percent of all murders committed by the year 2005 will be committed by juveniles.
<P>

Violence (i.e. Aggravated assaults) committed with guns by youths has also increased at roughly the same pace as homicides.  After years of statistical decline, drug use by teens is also on the rise.  None of these statistics would appear to bode well for future.
<P>

It now seems that everyday we are hearing about horrendous violent crimes being committed by juveniles.  The most famous of late was the 6-year-old in northern California who almost beat to death a small baby.  The baby was just released from the hospital on Thursday and has suffered brain damage from the attack by the 6-year-old.
<P>

There is also the case of the 15-year-old pregnant girl who was shot to death by another student in St. Louis.  In Miami, two 16-year-old males have been charged with the murder of a Dutch woman tourist who just happened to end up in the wrong neighborhood. A 15-year-old New York boy tried to steal a pair of earrings from a woman.  During the attack, the young woman fell to her death under a New York subway train.
<P>

In Fort Meyers, Florida, a group of teenagers shot and killed a high school band teacher.  This case will be the subject of an upcoming ENN report, but a police investigation into this group of teens turned up "would-be junior terrorists" that could of rivaled some of the worst terrorist organizations in the world.
<P>

On Friday, in St. Louis, one 9-year-old and two 11-year-old males were charged with the rape of an 8-year-old female in an overgrown field.  Where are they learning this stuff?  This has to be learned behavior.
<P>

There seems to be growing awareness now of this juvenile crime problem in the United States.  Several experts, as well as this publication, have been trying very hard to get the word out. People who have become victims of these young felons are angry and are calling for changes to be made in the juvenile justice system.
<P>

It has been a long-standing belief in the United States that juveniles who kill, rape and rob, be treated differently than adult offenders.  But this may soon change. In 1899, juvenile courts were established to help protect "juvenile delinquents."  But it seems that today, the reasoning for the protection of the youths in the criminal justice system may be outdated and changes need to be made to accomodate these "14-year-old harden felons."  Many critics, today, say that in reality too many hard-core juvenile offenders are arrested, held, and released time-after-time-after-time in a process that is called a revolving door.  It seems to only come to an end when a truly heinous crime is committed.
<P>
<B>Worse than Better in the Future</B>
<P>

Because of the rise in juvenile crime and the experts predictions that the problem is going to get worse before it gets better, many cities, states and even congress are trying to wrestle with the problem.  Tallahassee, Florida, has been experimenting with a couple of different programs to deal with troubled youths.  In one case, Tallahassee Police received a report of a teenager breaking into an auto.  Immediately, officers knew their suspect.  The suspect was a 16-year-old, who even held a job at a near-by restaurant. This 16-year-old, who was on parole, had been known to commit 32 similar offenses.  Officers had kept the suspect tracked on a point scale.  He was arrested after he barricaded himself inside an apartment building.  Because of his extensive criminal record, prosecutors immediately sent him to trial in an adult court.  This can be called the "get-tough" approach.
<P>

In another case, in the same city, a softer approach is taken with another known troubled child.  A fifth-grader was repeatedly getting into trouble with the law last summer.  In six weeks, after special classes and counseling that were followed by DAILY after-school sessions, the child went from "class problem to developing leader." The child was named his school's "student of the month" in January.
<P>

So, which is the best approach to take?  Because of the grim statistics and depressing stories about problem youths, cities, states and even the federal government are looking at new ways to get a handle on the problem.  On the federal end, Congress is considering rewriting a 22-year-old law that provides anti-delinquency aid to states.
<P>

In one state, Massachusetts, the House of Representatives has voted that that anyone as young as the age of 14 may be tried as an adult in a murder case.  The State of Tennessee has now eliminated any minimum age for trying juveniles as adults.  In 1995, Oregon lowered its minimum age for someone to be able to be tried as an adult from 14 down to 12-years.  Wisconsin went even lower.  A child of 10-years-of-age can now be tried as an adult.
<P>
<B>Causative Factors</B>
<P>
What's the cause of all of this?  Statistics show mounting concerns.  In the mid-1980's there was a cocaine epidemic. Drug wars between street gangs and drug dealers led to an arms race on American streets.  The number of black males aged 14 to 17 is due to rise by 26 percent by the year 2005. Unfortunately, statistics prove that such youths are disproportonately affected by social problems linked historically to crime.  These social problems include: the breakdown of the family, poverty and poor education.  It really is not surprising that facing these kinds of social problems, inner-city black youths are disproportionately involved in crime.
<P>

Sixty-one percent of all juveniles arrested for homicide in 1994 were black.  Remember, blacks make up about 12 percent of the overall population in the United States.  52 percent of the murdered victims in 1994 were also black. "Black on Black" crime appears to be a major fact of the statistics.
<P>

Criminologist James Alan Fox of Northeastern University in Boston said, "Given our wholesale disinvestment in youth, we will likely have more than 5,000 teen killers per year."  The United States averages, currently, about 21,000 homicides per year.  The number of youths aged 14 and younger who have been charged with homicide has jumped by 43 percent in the past twenty years.
<P>

The thing that worries everyone from police officers to criminologists to the general public are the small number of teens who apparently kill or maim with little or no moral compunction.  Cincinnati judge David Grossmann, the president of a national juvenile judges organization, says that he sees a wave of "undisciplined, untutored, unnurtured young people."  The Judge added, "Gangs have become the alternative to a nurturing family."
<P>

Kathleen Heide is a criminologist and a psychotherapist in Florida. She said that many young murderers "are incapable of empathy." Heide related one case where a teen offender shot and paralyzed a jogger who refused to hand over a gold neck chain.  When the teen offender was asked what might had been a preferable alternative outcome other than shooting the victim, the teen said, "He could have given me his rope (chain).  I asked him twice."
<P>

According to John Firman of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, police officers are now encountering more and more <B>"kids with no hope, no fear, no rules and no life expectancy."</B>  Princeton University political scientist  John Dilulio said that inner-city neighborhoods are raising too many "chaotic, dysfunctional, fatherless, Godless and jobless youths where self-respecting young men literally aspire to get away with murder."
<P>
<B>Criminal Justice Response</B>
<P>
Some states are getting tough on juvenile offenders.  In Arizona, the governor of the state, Fife Symington, is working very hard and is leading a petition drive to abolish the state juvenile court system altogether.  The aim is to send the most violent young offenders to adult courts, regardless of age, even if judges, themselves, object.  An aide to Governor Symington said, "The current law making everyone under 18 a juvenile is absurd." The aide, who was a former prosecutor, said, "We've had kids arrested ten or fifteen times ... that has to stop."  It is said that people "are standing in line" to sign the governor's petition.
<P>

In the United States Congress, many conservatives argue that the current federal anti-delinquency statute is out of date.  Many Congressmen only want to send aid to states who try their most violent youths as adults.
<P>

But even if we, as a country, do crackdown and get tough on these young violent offenders ... it's still not an easy solution. As Donna Hamparian, a crime consultant in Columbus, Ohio, pointed out -- even if we do put more youths behind bars, the projected number of juvenile offenders will probably be so high that "we can't build enough prisons to keep all of them locked up." 
<P> 

Analysts at the Emergency Response & Research Institute (ERRI) say that there has to be another solution, and  that ENN will continue to explore the issue and offer alternatives in this continuing series of reports.

<font size=5><strong>EXPERTS SAY BOMB IS MOST LIKELY 
SCENARIO FOR DOWNING OF TWA FLIGHT 800</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
Private security and counterterrorism experts on Thursday were coming up with preliminary 
theories about what happened to TWA Flight 800 over Long Island on Wednesday night. Just 
about everyone was saying the same thing -- that it is still too early to determine exactly what 
happened. But still, based mainly on eyewitness reports, of seeing the plane going down in a 
fireball -- most experts believe that the most likely scenario was that a bomb was placed 
aboard the jumbo jet.<br>
<br>
James Donoghue, the editor-in-chief of Air Transport Magazine, said, &quot;It's got the hallmarks of 
a bombing, but it could be all kinds of other things. Of the number of 747s that have 
descended in flames, the vast majority have been because of bombs.&quot; Michael Barr, the 
director of aviation safety programs at the University of Southern California, said, &quot;Airplanes 
don't blow up just like that. I've been following 747s since 1970 and I've never seen one blow 
up like that.&quot;<br>
<br>
In New York City, Robert McGuire, the president of Kroll Associates and a former NYPD 
police commissioner, said that the crash was, in his estimation, suspicious. Mainly because the 
Boeing 747 has a historically good safety record. Mr. McGuire said that statistics suggest that 
it is highly unusual for a plane to just disintergrate all of a sudden. He said, &quot;The nature of the 
incident appears to be a traumatic explosion. There were no reports of a burning engine, 
smoke or the normal stuff that happens to these planes before an accident. Because there was 
no transmission back to the tower, there seems to have been immediate or overwhelming 
trauma.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kroll Associates is a highly regarded consulting and security firm. McGuire said that the 
destination of the plane, Paris, did not in itself suggest an unusual risk. However, its original 
departure point, Athens, Greece, has been on the U.S. government list of dangerous airports. 
Another security expert, Philip Stern, the managing director of the Fairfax Group, said that the 
original departure point of Athens was &quot;troublesome&quot; to him. Athens has long been known to 
act as a gateway to the Middle East. Stern said that Greece has a history of &quot;radical politicians 
sympathetic to Middle Eastern causes.&quot;<br>
<br>
But there is still a problem of how a bomb could be planted on the plane in Athens, fly all the 
way to New York, sit on the tarmac at John F. Kennedy International Airport for three hours 
and then suddenly blow up thirty minutes into a flight toward Paris.<br>
<br>
Mr. McGuire said that planting an explosive device aboard the plane would have been difficult 
to do in Greece, A bomb with an altitude detonator would have exploded when the plane was 
enroute to New York. But that problem may had been overcome if the terrorist were able to 
assemble the bomb in the plane's bathroom while traveling from Athens to New York and then 
just left the bomb on the plane.<br>
<br>
Another concern is the security at airports in the U.S. Former U.S. Department of 
Transportation Inspector General Mary Schiavo told ABC News that her last act before 
resigning last week was signing off on a new security assessment of U.S. airports. Schiavo 
would not reveal the results of this latest assessment, but she hinted that it probably was not 
good. She said that the assessment conducted before the last one was &quot;highly critcial&quot; of 
security.<br>
<br>
Schiavo said that her staff was able to penetrate airport security about 40 percent of the time. 
She said, &quot;My staff was able to, literally, get out on the tarmac, get on planes, get in cockpits 
and witness a number of test devices go through security. And we are troubled by that. We 
found that a lot of it was just plain lax attitude.&quot;<br>
<br>
According to Schiavo, there is new bomb detection equipment that has not been widely 
deployed in the U.S. because of cost. However, airports overseas are widely deploying the 
system. Schiavo said that to install the new bomb detection equipment would cost about $5 
billion. She, however, said, &quot;For some reason, the price tag that seemed so ridiculosuly 
expensive before the crash, after we have terrible tragedies like this, we come to our senses 
about such expenditures.&quot;<br>
<br>
How will investigators determine that it was indeed a bomb that caused Flight 800 to go 
down? Forensic experts will look for the residue of explosive that gather on debris. They will 
look for a twist in a chunk of the fuselage. They will also look for burns on the flesh of the 
victims and on cabin surfaces.<br>
<br>
No one single clue is likely to prove that it was a bomb. Instead, the investigators will almost 
have to reassemble all the collected pieces of the aircraft that have been recovered. Besides 
the plane itself, luggage, clothing, cockpit and cabin furnishings will also have to be pieced 
together.<br>
<br>
The most vital thing will be chemical analysis. When bombs explode, they essentially spray 
themselves all over the place. Bombs shoot debris through a plane and leave a distinctive 
pattern of small holes with metal edges splayed outward. Chemical residues and specific 
by-products of an explosion device can be identifed, including information about the types of 
explosives involved.<br>
<br>
Your editor has had occasion to examine the scene of an explosion in the past. While it was 
not essentially a criminal matter, one could very plainly see how the explosion happened. What 
direction the blast went and how powerful it was. Residue from the explosive could plainly be 
seen on the walls.<br>
<br>
If it was a bomb that brought TWA Flight 800 down, it may be a while before investigators 
make their final determination. In 1988, it took a full week before investigators determined that 
it was a bomb that brought Pan Am Flight 103 down over Lockerbie, Scotland. And that 
crime scene was on land and easier to investigate than the crime scene for Flight 800.<br>
<br>
The primary piece of evidence that allowed investigators to make their determination in the Pan 
Am case was a clue that was found in the samples of lining from the baggage compartment. 
The lining tested positive for plastic explosives. But Pan Am Flight 103 went down over land, 
TWA Flight 800 went down into the ocean. And because it went into the ocean it probably 
will make the investigators job more difficult. Certainly not impossible, but just more difficult.<br>
<br>
A case in point -- On 23 June 1985, the most deadly bombing in aviation history happened 
when an Air India 747 crashed off the coast of Ireland. 329 people were killed and the plane 
basically disappeared without a trace. For investigators, only circumstantial evidence allowed 
investigators to surmise that a bomb had gone off on the forward cargo hold.<br>
<br>
In Israel on Friday, the Haaretz newspaper reported that Israeli counterterrorism experts are 
looking for possible links between Moslem extremists and the crash of TWA Flight 800. The 
paper quoted an unidentified senior Israeli security source as saying that Israel was assisting 
U.S. intelligence agencies and the FBI in every way that it could. The newspaper said, &quot;Israel is 
checking whether there is any sort of connection between the explosion to Islamic terror 
organizations.&quot;<br>
<br>
Israeli officials have drawn any connection between the crash and the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
They say that they have not yet determined whether it was an accident or an attack. Israeli 
Brigadier-General Yigal Pressler, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's advisor on 
counterterrorism, said, &quot;We still don't know if this was an attack.&quot; Another Israeli security 
source, however, pointed to unspecified recent warnings of a possible attack on a plane and 
said, &quot;All the signs point to a bomb having been planted on the plane.&quot;<br>
<br>
One last note, the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Friday morning activated it Strategic 
Information Operations Center in Washington. This command center enable information on 
major cases to be assembled quickly for easy monitoring by top FBI officials. One FBI official 
said, &quot;We'd rather be ahead of the curve, than behind, if this turns out to be a terrorist 
incident.&quot;<br>
<br>
Just about every counterterrorism, security, and law enforcement expert that ENN has talked 
with and/or heard say that it probably was a bomb that brought down TWA Flight 800. But, in 
order to draw a firm conclusion, we all still have to wait for the scientific evidence to be 
brought forward and confim these suspicions.</p>

<font size=5><strong>TERRORISM STRIKES AT THE OLYMPICS</strong></font> ...<br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
ATLANTA (ENN) - A large pipe bomb exploded early on Saturday morning in Centennial Olympic Park in 
downtown Atlanta. Two people were killed and at least 110 other people were wounded. FBI Special Agent 
Woody Johnson said, &quot;The FBI will take the lead in the investigation. We will consider it an act of terrorism until 
information should arrive to the contrary.&quot;<br>
<br>
The large blast went off at about 0125 EDT near a 5-story 60x60 sound and light tower in the 21-acre park located 
near Luckie Street and Hayden Street. At the time of the explosion thousands of people were celebrating at an 
open-air, free concert.<br>
<br>
One witness described what he saw by saying, &quot;I thought it was fireworks, like a big boom, and I saw three guys 
laying in the street. They all had leg injuries. Blood was running down the street. It was horrible.&quot;<br>
<br>
Another witness described, &quot;I saw two people hurt. One of them was a black man hurt real bad and he had shrapnel 
sticking out of his body. After it went off, you could smell gunpowder in the air.&quot;<br>
<br>
The bomb detonated after authorities began evacuating the area near the tower. A police officer had noticed a 
suspicious leather satchel. The officer called for members of the bomb squad, who did inspect the package before it 
went off and confirmed that it was a dangerous situation. FBI Special Agent Johnson said, &quot;Before they were able to 
clear people from the area, the device went off.&quot;<br>
<br>
One man who was mixing music for the concert said, &quot;The security guard found a knapsack or nylon bag and didn't 
like the way it looked. The police started clearing the area. I was 50 feet away and there was a policeman about 30 
feet away from it. I saw the cop right in front of me take a huge piece of shrapnel. He got hit bad. One guy threw a 
towel on his head. I poured water on him to wash away some of the blood. He was lying face down and he wasn't 
moving. I saw ten pockets of people hit by what appears to be shrapnel.&quot; At least six (6) of the wounded were law 
enforcement officers who were trying to clear the area. The blast reportedly left a small four-feet deep crater in the 
ground.<br>
<br>
Johnson said that he had no information on any other bombs or threats in the area. ENN reported in its Friday 
edition that the Olympic Games were receiving about 30 threats per day.<br>
<br>
Hospitals in Atlanta treated more than 100 wounded victims. Many of the victims were struck by shrapnel. One 
doctor said that he treated many people with fractures and one person had a finger amputated. One of the dead 
victims, a woman, was killed by the effects from the blast. The other person who died was a 40-year-old Turkish 
national who suffered a heart attack.<br>
<br>
Olympic Centennial Park is located in the center of Atlanta and is within walking distance of three major Olympic 
venues. The park was wide open and anyone was free to walk through it. Experts say that this location was probably 
the least protected of all of the venues and attractions in Atlanta.<br>
<br>
As mentioned before, the blast went off at 0125 EDT. At approx. 01:11 EDT, there was a call made to 911 by a 
person saying that there was a bomb was in the park and he even gave a location of the device. The call was made 
from a bank of public phones located about two blocks away from the park. Police and FBI investigators have spent 
most of the morning collecting evidence from that area.<br>
<br>
Law enforcement officers were saying that the device appeared to be crude and they suspect more of a local 
connection, rather than an international connection. But these observations were based only on preliminary 
observations. Speculation among ERRI analysts is centering on a &quot;copycat&quot; connection or &quot;militia connection.&quot;<br>
<br>
As could be expected, security in Atlanta was tightened on Saturday morning. Security agents became very serious 
and were conducting many more inspections of people and vehicles. Armed soldiers were seen at at least one 
outlying venue this morning, in an attempt to further secure the premises.<br>
<br>
At a little past 1000 EDT, President Bill Clinton called the deadly pipe-bomb attack an &quot;evil act of terror.&quot; The 
President said, &quot;We will spare no effort to find out who was responsible for this murderous act. We will track them 
down. We will bring them to justice. The bombing at Centennial Olympic Park this morning was an evil act of terror. 
It was aimed at the innocent people who were participating in the Olympic Games and at the spirit of the Olympics. 
It was an act of cowardice that stands in sharp contrast to the courage of the Olympic athletes.&quot; Clinton added, &quot;An 
act of vicious terror like this is clearly directed at the spirit of our own democracy.&quot;</p>

<p><font size=5><strong>TERRORISM IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM</strong></font> ...<br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
Clark Staten, ERRI Analyst<br>
<br>
Although investigators have not officially determined the cause of the crash of TWA Flight 800, there is no doubt that this 
incident shined a spotlight on the global problem of terrorism. Whether it is proven that a terrorist act did indeed bring the 
plane down into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Long Island really no longer matters. This incident seems to have bring 
home the message that America is vulnerable to outside forces that wish to harm American citizens. The perception is now 
there.<br>
<br>
The United States State Department defines terrorism this way: &quot;Premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated 
against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience.&quot;<br>
<br>
The world is becoming an ever shrinking place. Americans are now finding out that they may have a lot more in common 
with people in Western Europe, South America, Israel and Japan.<br>
<br>
In 1995, the U.S. State Department's Office of Counterterrorism recorded 440 official terrorist acts in the world. A little 
more than one incident per day. That was up from 322 terrorist acts in 1994. Of those 440, 99 of the attacks were against 
U.S. interests. That was increase from 1994 when there were 66 acts against U.S. interests. Twelve Americans were killed 
by terrorists in 1995, compared to only four killed in 1994.<br>
<br>
The statistics, of course, show an upward trend. What the numbers show is that the U.S. is only a part of large list of 
countries that must cope with the scourge of terrorism.<br>
<br>
By looking at other regions of the world, and seeing what other countries are under terrorist attack, and how they are 
coping with the problem, we may gain a better understanding of the global problem of low-intensity warfare. This list is by 
no means complete:<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong><img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> LATIN AMERICA - A SLEEPING GIANT</strong></font><br>
<br>
Some major cities in South America are among the most violent in the entire world. The Colombian cities of Bogota, Cali, 
and Medellin are victims to violence from Marxist rebels and powerful drug cartels. In Brazil, the cities of Sao Paulo and 
Rio de Janeiro have the highest murder rates in the world, where between 10,000 and 14,000 people a year are 
murdered.<br>
<br>
In Colombia, rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) conduct ambushes against government 
forces. They also are involved in drug trafficking and kidnappings, which is a big industry in Latin America these days. In 
June of 1995, the FARC planted a bomb at a rock concert in Medellin. The blast killed 28 people and wounded 200 
others.<br>
<br>
In Peru, it was thought that the government had defeated the Maoist terrorist group known as Shining Path (SL). But the 
group has been recently staging a comeback with a number of bombings in the country. American commercial concerns 
like Kentucky Fried Chicken, McDonalds, and other American symbols have allegedly been attacked by the Luminoso in 
the past.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong><img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> WESTERN EUROPE - KNOWING HOW TO DEAL WITH THE THREAT</strong></font><br>
<br>
For 27 years, Great Britain has been dealing with the threat of IRA terrorism, both on the mainland and in Northern 
Ireland. Thousands of people have been killed and numerous buildings have been destroyed by car bombs. Besides the 
Irish Republican Army, there is also the threat of terrorism by Protestant paramilitary groups who retaliate to the IRA 
attacks. In the past 27 years, more than 3,000 people have been killed by terrorist violence in the U.K.<br>
<br>
To combat this threat, British police have surrounded the city of London because it is known that the IRA likes to target 
the city. Roadblocks are manned by police officers at key streets entering the city. Cars and trucks are stopped randomly 
to check for explosives. A &quot;steel-ring&quot; of security measures has been implemented in parks of the commercial and theater 
district.<br>
<br>
At Heathrow Airport, a past target of the IRA, police dressed in flak jackets and carrying machine guns can be seen. Any 
passenger who happens to leave his bags unattended for even a few moments inside of a terminal does so at his own risk. 
Police will quickly pick up the unattended luggage and destroy it.<br>
<br>
The threat of terrorism is constantly on the minds of people living in Northern Ireland. Army and police units can be seen 
going through the streets of Belfast in armored cars. The army also conducts foot patrols and there are occasional 
roadblocks. Most of these sights had disappeared for a while during the IRA cease-fire, but they are back now. As rioting 
and revenge attacks, between Protestants and Catholics, continue with an increasing pace, the prospects for additional 
terrorist attacks also increases.<br>
<br>
In France, a wave of terrorist attacks in 1994 and 1995 on subway trains, jetliners and other targets were believed to be 
the work of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) from Algeria. The terrorist incidents in France have been halted for the most 
part, following massive arrests of suspected insurgents and infiltration of numerous groups.<br>
<br>
During the 1970s and 1980s, terrorism played a big part in Germany and in Italy. But counterterrorism forces in those 
countries have brought the problem under control.<br>
<br>
In Spain, the Basque separatist group known as ETA continues its attacks on the Spanish government. This group targets 
tourist sites in its attacks. ETA has been around for a very long time and has recently intensified its bombing campaign.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong><img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> EASTERN EUROPE - ONLY A MATTER OF TIME</strong></font><br>
<br>
Counterterrorism experts say that this region is ripe for groups with ample motive and means to conduct home-grown 
terrorist campaigns. It will only be a matter of time before Eastern Europe catches up to rest of the world.<br>
<br>
Police in Poland this year have been attempting to track a group that uses terrorist tactics to extort money from Western 
corporations. The group, or gang, depending on definition, is called &quot;GN 95 Group.&quot; It has targeted the Shell Oil Company 
in Poland and has demanded $2 million &quot;in exchange for peace for the next 25 years.&quot; The group says that if Shell doesn't 
pay up it will bomb Shell stations until the company decides to pay the money. The threats from the GN 95 Group started 
in April and the most recent one came in late July.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong><img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> RUSSIA - THE NEW TERRORISM HOTSPOT</strong></font><br>
<br>
When the Soviet Union was still intact and in control, acts of terrorism were rare and never publicized. A lot has changed 
in the 1990s. People in Russia now must cope with acts of terrorism that can strike such things as public transportation in 
Moscow. In the past year, there have been a number of high-profile acts of violence. More and more of these problems 
have been linked to the war in Chechnya.<br>
<br>
Earlier this year, Chechen rebels conducted two dramatic raids in which hundreds of hostages were taken. These were 
followed by standoffs with Russian forces that lasted for a number of days. While many of the hostages were freed 
unharmed, the sieges proved that a small, very dedicated force of rebels could hold-out against Russian conventional 
forces.<br>
<br>
There have been a string of bombings against mass transit targets in Moscow this summer. These attacks were causing the 
citizens of the city to be on edge and fearful. Not knowing if the next ride on a bus, may be their last. The attacks were 
causing the desired effect -- spreading fear among the populace.<br>
<br>
The strangest thing is -- there has been no concrete proof that Chechen rebels were responsible for any of the attacks.<br>
<br>
The continuing instability and assaults by terrorist groups have made the Russian people very nervous and most people 
skeptical that the authorities have the ability to handle the problems. (Ed. Note: <a href="/futerr.htm"><strong>Click here to review a 1991 ERRI 
Assessment of Terrorism following the break-up of the U.S.S.R.</strong></a> )<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong><img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> THE MIDDLE EAST - THE SPREADING CLOUD OF ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALISM</strong></font><br>
<br>
If terrorism was a sport, the Middle East would be considered the big leagues. All of the major players reside here with the 
rogue state of Iran being the high commissioner.<br>
<br>
Throughout there entire history, Israelis have had to live with the constant threat of terrorism. We hear about the bombings 
that do take a life and cause damage. What we don't always hear about are the constant bomb scares that occur at such 
places as movie theaters and shopping malls. The bomb squads in Israel are always kept busy.<br>
<br>
This year alone, Israelis have had to endure Katyusha rocket attacks fired by pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas in southern 
Lebanon. There have been four suicide bombings by Islamic extremists that have killed 59 people.<br>
<br>
No matter where you go, from Algeria to Saudi Arabia, terrorism, mostly from the hand of Islamic fundamentalists, is 
casting a cloud over the daily routines of people in the Middle East. The greatest fear is that terrorism is becoming more 
and more organized with the leaders of the terrorist organizations coming together and holding summits, just like 
counterterrorist forces in the West.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong><img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> JAPAN - PEOPLE NO LONGER FEEL TOTALLY SAFE</strong></font><br>
<br>
Japan has always been known as one of the world's safest nations. That image has tarnished somewhat after the deadly gas 
attack that occurred on Tokyo's subway system on 20 March 1995. The nerve gas attack, the work of a oddball 
doomsday cult, killed twelve people and injured thousands of others.<br>
<br>
What the attack proved most of all was that Japan, a country with a very low crime rate and few worldwide enemies, is 
susceptible to the scourge of terrorism.<br>
<br>
Even today, reminders of what happened about one-and-a-half years ago can still be seen and heard. Passengers on the 
subways are reminded by conductors to watch out for suspicious packages. Photographs of the seven cult members who 
are still at large can be seen everywhere. The Japanese, collectively, appear to be suffering from the psychological effects 
of the alleged attack by Aum Shinrykio, their previously unassailed security now shattered by by the fear that terrorists 
spread.</p>

<TITLE>L.A. "Crips" Make Enroads in Chicago</TITLE>

<H2>LOS ANGELES GANG ATTEMPTS TO TAKE OVER CHICAGO STREETS</H2>
By Clark Staten, ENN Editor
<P>

Chicago,Il. (ENN)-- Chicago gang crime specialists are reporting
that members of the "Crips" street gang, from the Los angeles
area, are attempting to take control of at least one
neighborhood here.  Police insiders say that several recent
raids have revealed a "new and different type of criminal
element" on Chicago's West side.
<P>

A recent arest of a burglar, on Chicago's West side, resulted
in his revealing to police the location of a cache' of
automatic weapons and military fragmentation grenades. Also
confiscated was a quantity of liquid PCP (Angel Dust/Animal
tranquilizer).  Reportedly, the weapons and drugs belonged to
a member of the Los Angeles based "Crips" street gang. A
Chicago Police intelligence officer, who asked to remain
anonymous, reported that an increase in the quality and
quantity of "rock cocaine" or "crack" can be attributed
to an "invasion from the West Coast". Chicago Police had
previously reported that there was very little "crack"
available for sale in Chicago.
<P>

"Street people" in certain West side neighborhoods have
confided that "there are bloods from out of town" who have
attempted to intimidate and control given areas where drugs
are sold. Several recent outbursts of violence and "drive-by"
shooting have reportedly been perpetrated by unknown "gang
types", who are not associated with any known Chicago gang.
One friendly neighborhood resident told this reporter, "them
brothers is from LA-LA land...you know... out West".  "They's
bad boys...that group...they kill you soon as look at you",
he concluded.
<P>

A recent raid called "Operation Hammerlock", which was
carried out against members of the Chicago "Vice Lords"
street gang resulted in the arest of more than sixty (60)
youths and adults and confiscation of numerous cars, houses,
and weapons.  This raid resulted in the further fragmentation
of traditional control of neighborhood "retail drug sales".
At least one Chicago intelligence analyst has hypothesized
that the decline of certain Chicago gangs has lead to the
a void that is being filled by Los Angeles based gangs.
<P>

He points out that many Chicago street gangs were frequently
a "loosely affiliated relationship of convenience and
self defense" and that they were under no centralized
authority. "The Crips are another matter entirely...they are
ruthless and will stop at nothing to conduct their business",
he offered. "We can expect the level of violence to increase
even further...if `the Crips' continue their effort to
control Chicago's market in drugs and weapons", the wary
expert added.  "If I lived in Iowa City, or Boise, or Kansas
City, I would also be extremely worried...the gangs will be
there soon", he concluded.

<H3>The Personal History of Saddam Hussein</H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/hussein1.gif" align=right>
<P>

The current leader of Iraq is was born on April 28, 1937, in a small village
of al-Auja near the town of Takrit.  His early child hood was spent in a mud
hut in a mostly Sunni Muslim part of Iraq, which is approximately (100)
one-hundred miles north of Baghdad.  Hussein's father, Hussein al-Majid,
died or abandoned the family (according to who is reporting the story),
within a short time of his birth.  Accurate records are difficult to obtain
in a country where Hussein's birthday is celebrated as a national holiday.
<P>

He was reared alone by his mother Subha, until she took a second husband,
Ibrahim Hassan.  Hassan, often said to have been brutal and a thief, was a
sheepherder by profession and enlisted Saddam in his ventures.  According to
a former personal secretary of Hussein, his step father abused Saddam and
sent him to steal chicken and sheep to be sold.  This pattern continued until
1947 when, at the age of ten, he was allowed to move in with his mother's
brother, Khayrallah Tulfah, in Baghdad.
<P>

In Baghdad, Hussein began to learn more than reading and writing.  His tutor,
Khayrallah had been "cashiered" from the Iraqi army for supporting a
"Pro-Nazi" coup attempt that failed.  Khayrallah's bitterness towards the
British and imperialism, soon was transferred to Saddam.  In fact, some
confidants of Hussein point to his relationship with Tulfah as a turning point
in his political awareness.  To demonstrate Tulfah's importance to Hussein,
he was later made Mayor of Baghdad under the Hussein regime.  Saddam finished intermediate school (roughly the equivalent of 9th Grade) at the age of
sixteen, and attempted to be admitted to the prestigious Baghdad Military
Academy.
<P>

Unfortunately, his poor grades prevented him from doing so, and he became
more deeply involved in political matters.  In 1956, he participated in a
non-successful coup attempt against the monarchy of King Faisal II.  In 1957,
he joined the Baath party, a radical nationalist movement.  In 1958, a
non-Baathist group of army officers succeeded in overthrowing the King.
The group was led by General Abdul Qassim.  In 1959, Saddam and a group of
Baathist supporters attempted to assassinate Gen. Qassim by a day-light
machine-gun attack.  The attack was unsuccessful, but it helped to place
Hussein in a leadership position in the Baathist movement and furthered the
process of nationalist political indoctrination.  After the attack, in which
Hussein is slightly wounded, he fled to Syria.  From Syria, he went to Cairo,
Egypt where he would spend the next four (4) years.
<P>

While receiving aid from Egypt, he finished high school at the age of
twenty-four and continued his political education.  While in Egypt, he was
arrested on at least two occasions for threatening a fellow student and
chasing another down the street with a knife, both for political differences.
In 1961, he entered Cairo University School of Law, but did not finish his
studies there.  In 1963, a group of Baathist army officers tortured and
assassinated General Qassim.  This was done on Iraqi television.  They also
mutilated many of Qassim's devotees and showed their bodies (in close up)
on the nightly news for more than one night.  Saddam, hearing the news,
quickly rushed back to Iraq to become involved in the revolution.  And
involved, he was, as both an interrogator and torturer at the infamous
"Palace of the End", in the basement of the former palace of King Faisal.
<P>

According to reports by Hanna Batatu (a government reporter), Hussein rose
quickly through the ranks, due to his extreme efficiency as a torturer.  The
Baathist party split in 1963 and Saddam had supported the "winner" in the
latest party struggle.  He was appointed by Michel Aflaq to be a member of
the Baath Regional Command.  In 1964, Hussein was jailed by some "rightist"
military officers who opposed the Baathist takeover. Through other political
influence provided by his older cousin, General Ahmad Hassan al-Bakr, Hussein
became deputy Secretary-General of the Baathists in 1966.
<P>

In 1966, Hussein escaped from prison and set up a Baathist internal party
security system known as the Jihaz Haneen.  It was to serve as the
continuation of his political and real rise to power in Iraq.  In 1968,
another major upheaval in Iraq gave Hussein the greatest opportunity for
further advancement; his mentor, Gen. Bakr and the Baathist seized the
government.  Hussein was made Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council, in charge of internal security.
<P>

At the age of thirty-one (31) he had acquired what could have been deemed the
number two spot in the Baathist party.  He would continue in the position
for approximately the next ten years.  During that time, he would continue to
consolidate his power by appointing numerous family members to positions of
authority in the Iraqi government.  In his position of Deputy in Charge of
Internal Security, he built an enormous security apparatus and had spies and
informers everywhere in the circles of power in Iraq.
<P>

During this time, Hussein also began to accumulate the wealth and position that he so relished as a poor sheep-herder in the desert of al-Auja.  He and his family, now firmly entrenched in the infrastructure of the country , began to control the country's oil and other industrial enterprises.  With the help of his security network and several personal assassins, Hussein took control of many of the nation's leading businesses.
<P>

In 1978, Saddam had been working with othe r Arab nations to ostracize Egypt
for it's diplomatic initiative in resolving Israel/Arab questions.  An ally,
President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, almost became the undoing of Hussein's
ascension.  If a Syrian/Iraqi federation were formed against Egypt, Assad,
not Hussein, would rise to a position of greater power in the relationship.
President Bakr would lead the federation with Assad as second in command.
Hussein could not allow that to happen and began to urge the President to
step down.  Again with the help of his family and security apparatus, Hussein
was able to accomplish his task.
<P>

On July 16, 1979, President Bakr resigned, officially due to health problems,
but in reality a victim of Hussein's political in-fighting.  Moving quickly
to consolidate his power,  he called a major Baathist meeting on July 22, 1979. During the meeting, various family members and other Hussein devotees urged that the party be "cleansed".  Hussein then read a list of names and asked that they step outside.  Once there, they are taken into custody.
<P> 

A high-ranking member of the Revolutionary Command, the head of the labor unions, the leading Shiite member of the Command, and twenty (20) others are then systematically and personally killed by Hussein and his top party officials. During the next few days, reports indicate that as many as 450 other military officers, deputy prime ministers, and "non-party faithful" were rounded up and killed.  This purge insured Hussein's consolidation of power in Iraq.
<P>

In 1980, Iraq invaded Iran and conducted an eight year war against one of his
nearest neighbors and the home of Shiite fundamentalist Muslims.  Again,
because it appeared that the Shiites could be a threat to his continued
dictatorship, the Kurds (Iraqi minority) were sprayed with poison gas for
participating with the Iranians in an attempted overthrow of his country.
The war continued for eight years of brutality and even repression of Hussein's own countrymen (especially the Kurds).
<P>

In 1988, after millions being killed, Iraq and Iran conduct a cease-fire and
ended the bloodshed.  By 1984, as many as 1.5 million Iraqis were supporters
of Hussein and the Baathists.  He continued to enlarge his security apparatus
and army.  In insidious ways, the party apparatus formed numerous government
agencies to control and manipulate the citizens of Iraq.  A statistical
analysis of the population indicated that as many as fifty per cent of the
Iraqis or a member of their family were employed by the government or military. The party and the people have become one.  Hussein's domination of the country is complete.
<P>

Even the war against Iran didn't end the peoples support for Hussein, although some small protests did dampen the population's support for the conflict with Iran.  Ultimately however, the war with Iran only strengthened Hussein's resolve and, in some eyes, causes him to become a "hero" of Arab nationalism.  This brings us to the chapter of Hussein's life that has not been thoroughly researched and written.    It involves the 1990, summer invasion of Kuwait over a dispute about oil prices and political control of the Persian Gulf.  The subsequent United Nation Resolutions and United States intervention in the defense of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other nearby countries will undoubtedly impact on the history of Saddam Hussein.
<P>

Hussein has managed to survive the loss of a large portion of his army, a major psychological defeat, and control of the Northern and Southern part of Iraq, yet he continues in power in Iraq.   His resilience is extraordinary, and so far he has managed to elude the allied powers, who would like to see him replaced as the leader of a major Middle-Eastern country.  One thing is sure, Hussein is a man who is filled with pride.  He is firmly entrenched in the history and culture of Iraq. 
<P> 
If past history can serve as a guide, in regard to his future behavior, one can expect that he will use all of his resources to exact revenge against those that defeated him.  The most viable route for revenge, by Hussein and Iraq, is the conduct of terrorist operations. No one should discount his future involvement in actions against the United States or her allies.

<H2>Terrorism Alert; Concerns About Mid-East Inspired Attacks </H2>
By Steve Macko, Managing Editor
<P>

An ENN affiliate, the SNS News Service in Isreal, reported on Tuesday that security
for U.S. President Bill Clinton's trip to the country will be
very heavy.  SNS said that Israeli security officials are fearful
of an attempted attack against the President and other world leaders
by Hamas or the Islamic Jihad terror groups.
<P>

National Police Chief Assaf Hefetz said, "We fear there are suicide
bombers poised for action.  That is why there is a very high alert."
A United States Embassy spokesman said that security officials in
Isreal have advised President Clinton that he should restrict his
movements and that security concerns should take precedence during
his visit.
<P>

Overnight on Wednesday, the IDF reportedly arresting another twelve suspected
Moslem militants on the West Bank. Beginning on Wednesday evening and lasting until Thursday afternoon, about 5,000 troops will be deployed in Jerusalem to provide protection
for Mr. Clinton.  10,000 troops will be used throughout the country. 
The codename for the operation is "Song."  The security detail will be 
headed by Commander Arye Amit, who is the Jerusalem District Commander 
of the Police Department.
<P>

At about 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday, the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv Highway
(Road Number 1) will be closed to all traffic for about two-and-a-
half hours.  This will allow the Presidential motorcade to travel
from Ben Gurion International Airport to Jerusalem.  The highway
will then be shut down again on Thursday at about 2:30 p.m.
<P>
<HR>
				
All day Wednesday, security and intelligence agencies in the
Middle East and in the United States were buzzing about the
possibility that radical Palestinaian or other militant Islamic
fundamentalists could launch some kind of attack during President
Clinton's visit to Isreal.
<P>

Because security is very tight at the locale of the terrorism
summit in Egypt and in Isreal, terrorists may be forced to look
for suitable targets of attack elsewhere... most likely in the
Middle East.  Western Europe could also be a target.
<P>

ERRI is issuing an alert to Americans overseas and advises that
extreme caution should be undertaken.  The United States is
currently giving very visible support of Isreal at this time and
in the eyes of outlaw regime in Iran and its surrogate Muslim fanatics,
the United States is known as the "Great Satan." 
<P> 

Clark Staten, ERRI CT analyst, said, "The current threat level of possible attacks involving the United States, its leaders, and its facilities throughout the world is as high as it has been since the 1991 Persian Gulf War." "The anticipated threat against Israel is even higher than that," Staten concluded. 
After all factors have been added up -- ERRI feels that there is an increased threat
to Americans everywhere, at this time.

<H2>FBI Domestic and International Terrorist Alerts</H2>
<P>
WASHINGTON (ENN) - The Federal Bureau of Investigation on Friday
warned Jewish groups in the United States that a threat has been
received to murder 1,200 Jewish executives and physicians in the
U.S. unless Isreal withdraws its military forces from Lebanon by
Sunday.  In a statement, the FBI said, "There is no way to know
at this time if the threat is real, but the FBI believes that
Jewish organizations, synagogues and individuals should fear for their
own safety and be on heightened alert."
<P>

The threat received by the FBI also demanded that Isreal pay
$12 billion by Sunday to compensate the Lebanese killed in
Operation Grapes of Wrath.  The FBI also said that it has
informed the Isreali General Security Service (GSS) of the
threat.  Also notified have been other U.S. federal, state
and local law enforecment agencies.

SPOKANE, WASHINGTON (ENN) - The Federal Bureau of Investigation
has issued a nationwide alert to all law enforcement agencies
warning about potential acts of domestic terrorism if the
standoff with Freemen in Montana turns violent.  The alert
also included a letter that was reportedly sent by some unidentified
militia leaders to their followers.  The letter threatened to use
violence against targets of opportunity, such as offices of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service and communications centers.
<P>

The letter said, "In the event that the military is used or
militia leaders are assaulted, all commands must be prepared
to act.  The domestic terrorism operation is supposed to be
codenamed, Project Worst Nightmare.  The letter was reportedly
sent to underground cells of militia members members on
28 March 1996, which was only three days after the Montana
standoff began.
<P>

This alert is now significant because it is being reported that
the FBI may now be losing its patience with the Freemen.  On
Wednesday, the FBI invited the Freemen to a face-to-face meeting
that was supposed to take place today, Saturday.  The FBI told
the group that they should attend the meeting or "suffer the
consequences."
<P>

The Freemen rejected the offer of the meeting by saying that by
their interpretation the FBI does not exist because it is not
a governmental agency.
<P>

In the alert to police agencies, the FBI statement said, "While
this particular text (The aforementioned letter sent to militia
groups) is not associated with any specific militia organization
in the United States, it is an indicator that certain militia
groups may be taking the following information seriously."

<font size=5><strong>TERROR COMES TO AMERICA ...</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
The pipe bomb explosion on Saturday at the Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta served as yet another reminder to 
U.S. citizens that they are at the mercy of groups or individuals who have political or religious agendas, personal 
grievances or psychological problems.<br>
<br>
The beginning of terrorism coming to the shores of America was the February 1993 bombing of the World Trade 
Center in New York City in which six people were killed and more than 1,000 others were injured. Next came the 
19 April 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City where 168 people were killed.<br>
<br>
Before those two major events, terrorism that was directed at the United States was mainly contained to attacks on 
U.S. embassies and facilities in the Middle East and in Latin America. The more prominent attacks were the October 
1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut and the December 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over 
Lockerbie, Scotland.<br>
<br>
The pipe bomb that exploded in the park in Atlanta on Saturday showed that an attack need not be on a grand scale. 
It doesn't have to be accomplished by a well organized terrorist group with hundreds, or maybe thousands, of 
members and supporters. An act of terror can be done by a single recluse, such as the infamous Unabomber -- who 
sent his deadly packages through the U.S. Mail.<br>
<br>
Philip Stern, a terrorism expert with the New York-based corporate security firm, the Fairfax Group, said, &quot;As an 
open society and a democracy this country is particularly vulnerable. We have free passage, coast-to-coast, anyone 
can apply for a visa to visit and the population is both enormous and diversified.&quot;<br>
<br>
According to Stern, who has been quoted in this publication many times in the past, such factors provide cover to 
anyone who may wish to commit an act of violence against this country. Those kinds of people may be resentful 
economic &quot;have-nots&quot; or even religious fundamentalist extremists who see Western culture, values and power as 
oppression. Stern said, &quot;At the same time we have the Montana Freemen, the Branch Davidians and the people who 
bomb our churches -- all symptomatic of disenchantment with society among people who are willing to use violence.&quot;<br>
<br>
Stern said that such violent acts, such as the bombing in Atlanta, are &quot;impossible to stop.&quot; Even if stricter controls, 
more surveillance and other increased security measures were to just be confined to government buildings and 
airports -- there would still be a danger. &quot;The one thing you can't protect is the general population in a large urban 
area,&quot; Stern said. &quot;Even Israel, a democracy that is under siege 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, can't stop it -- and 
they have in place a security system that we could not possibly emulate, due to this country's size.&quot; He added, &quot;It 
would be like a giant trying to swat a gnat. The question is, how do you protect the American Airlines flight from 
Columbus to St. Paul? It all comes down to the cost factor -- how much you are willing to spend and what civil 
rights are you willing to have intruded upon to protect against terrorism.&quot;<br>
<br>
Even before Saturday's bombing in Atlanta, people in the U.S. were already on edge after the downing of TWA 
Flight 800 off the coast of Long Island. The blast that occurred in Centennial Park only renewed concerns about 
how the U.S. was defending itself against terrorism.<br>
<br>
The cause of the downing of TWA Flight 800 has not been officially determined, but if the jetliner was brought down 
by a terrorist plot -- it could be considered to be a pretty sophisticated plot. In comparison, the explosive device in 
Atlanta was easy to make and detonate in an unsecured area.<br>
<br>
A major difference between the Atlanta attack and Middle East terrorists is that the Mideast terrorists often use 
high-powered car or truck bombs -- while it appears that domestic militia groups tend to focus on government 
buildings and not crowds of people.<br>
<br>
The dean of Northeastern University's criminal justice program in Boston, James Alan Fox, says that there is 
essentially two motivations for bombers and they are: revenge and attention. Fox said, &quot;The desire to make a 
statement can be that of a well-organized terrorist group that uses victims as pawns to advance their cause or it could 
be someone who is just interested in feeling important.&quot;<br>
<br>
Given the increased focus on violent anti-government groups, sometimes called militias, Fox said that a militia 
sympathizer may have committed the bombing in Atlanta to gain attention. Fox said, &quot;Through an amateurish 
bombing like this, he can feel like he's part of the movement. He can elevate his sense of importance.&quot;<br>
<br>
Marvin Vitch, who is a security consultant, recently said, &quot;The pipe bomb itself is a very, very unsophisticated device. 
Its components can be purchased in your local hardware store. Building one is quite simple. If you don't know how 
to do it, there are any number of books available ... that will teach you explicitly, step- by-step.&quot;<br>
<br>
For 17 years, the infamous Unabomber kept investigators baffled because he carefully crafted his pipe bombs. He 
was very careful about the materials that he used and he was much more than the average, run-of-the-mill pipe bomb 
builder.<br>
<br>
One special agent with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) said that he was confident that the 
person(s) who committed the bombing in Atlanta would be apprehended. The agent said, &quot;A pipe bomb is very 
inefficient. It always leaves a lot of evidence behind. We've investigated thousands of these. We know what to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Soon after the downing of TWA Flight 800, President Bill Clinton took additional steps to tighten security at airports, 
even before the downing was officially called a criminal act. Considering the downing of the plane and the bombings 
of the World Trade Center and the Oklahoma federal building, Senator Sam Nunn said that the U.S. is now finding 
itself in the same position in regard to terrorism as people in Great Britain, Israel and other countries. Nunn said, 
&quot;The public in this country is on the front line now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Just about immediately after the bombing in Atlanta Saturday, FBI Special-Agent-In-Charge Woody Johnson of the 
Atlanta Field Division said that the explosion was &quot;considered an act of terror.&quot; Many counterterrorism and security 
experts have questioned the quick labeling of the incident as an act of terrorism. While it is terrible that two people 
were killed in the incident, one from an apparent heart attack brought on by the blast, what happened early on 
Saturday morning was not on the same level as what happened at Munich Olympic Games in 1972, where 
Palestinian gunmen murdered eleven Israeli athletes.<br>
<br>
Robert Gardner, a security expert from Ventura, California, asked, &quot;What is terrorism? Is it some Middle Eastern 
group or is it just some whacko who wants to liven up his evening?&quot; After the FBI in Atlanta announced its 
assessment that the bombing was an act of terrorism, many in the uninformed main stream news media rushed to 
connect the event with the recent crash of TWA Flight 800 and the attacks in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, as well as the 
Oklahoma City bombing.<br>
<br>
But terrorism experts, including those associated with this publication, quickly pointed out that the weapon that was 
used -- a pipe bomb laced with nails and screws in a knapsack -- was crude and that the motive for the bombing 
was unclear.<br>
<br>
Laird Wilcox, an author and an expert on political extremism in the U.S., said, &quot;I can't see Middle Eastern terrorists 
building a pipe bomb. They are far more advanced than that. It would surprise most of us if a group were involved. It 
was probably an individual or a couple of individuals. Maybe even young people. The militia groups have been so 
thoroughly penetrated and watched since Oklahoma that if a plot like this was being discussed the FBI would have 
known about it.&quot;<br>
<br>
The potential for terrorism at the Olympic Games was discussed in a book entitled, &quot;The Political Olympics.&quot; Its 
author Professor Derick Hulme said that it was in the interest of the government to label the bombing in Atlanta as 
terrorism before all the facts were in. He said, &quot;All violence immediately becomes terrorism now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hulme was asked why it was in the interest of the government to label the attack terrorism, he replied, &quot;It is very 
attractive for government figures and the media to do that. It answers questions fast and makes a political point.&quot; The 
Professor said that he believes that the Atlanta bombing was carried out by &quot;one single crazy person.&quot; He added, &quot;All 
this proves is that anyone can gain access to the world's media through the Olympics.&quot;<br>
<br>
Robert Gardner said that the focus on terrorism would help known extremists groups -- even if they had nothing to 
do with the attack. Gardner said, &quot;If they can be perceived as having disrupted the Olympics without even doing it, 
so much the better.&quot;<br>
<br>
But as we return to main point of this article -- authorities and citizens in the U.S. are painfully beginning to learn that 
it is virtually impossible to prevent attacks on civilian targets. Doctor Bruce Hoffman, an expert on terrorism at St. 
Andrews University in Scotland, said, &quot;Experience has repeatedly shown that terrorists, when confronted by 
heightened security, simply turn to softer targets.&quot;<br>
<br>
The British newspaper Independent on Sunday said that there was a distinct difference between the terrorists 
operating in Europe and militants in the United States, such as Tim McVeigh -- who is accused in connection with 
the Oklahoma City bombing. The paper said, &quot;When the IRA explode a bomb they do so with a political rationale. 
However foul their means, the end is clearly understood. The pattern of the American way of terror, now beginning 
to emerge, is unique. The Atlanta bomb, like the Oklahoma bomb, was an act of rage, nothing more. America's 
bombers do not make demands. They have no defined objectives. Terror is not an instrument of political persuasion. 
It is a means to vent spleen. Which, as the century draws to an end, does not speak well about the health of 
America.&quot;<br>
<br>
As we conclude our analysis of this issue, Paul Copher, a counter-terrorism analyst, who is a former member of the 
U.S. military intelligence establishment, and a former trainer of counter-terrorism topics at the Federal Law 
Enforcement Training Center in Georgia, sums up the entire situation in America in his capsule comments; &quot;I would 
predict a couple months of paranoia... then the security levels will drop because bombs won't be going off each day 
to sharpen the skills of the security forces.&quot;</p>
<p>Copher continued his analysis; &quot;In regards to Atlanta, I have an idea &quot;ole Billy Bob&quot; did not want all these 'foreigners' 
in his state. The copycats are all wired now for the upcoming (political) conventions. The EOD/Bomb Disposal units 
are getting calls for every package or bag they see, just like in Israel. But, then the excitement will wear off and the 
INCONVENIENCE will take over.&quot; </p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Editor's Note by Clark Staten:</strong><br>
(Analysts at ERRI sincerely hope that Mr. Copher is wrong and that familiarity will not breed contempt. But, a 
historical perspective would suggest that he is probably right and that unless additional terror acts happen in the next 
few weeks or months, that the politicians, the media, and the public will do their best to quickly forget the reality of 
future threats against America. Caution is urged about a future failure to continue to plan, equip and prepare, as the 
collective mindset moves on to idyllic denial or to the next controversy or issue of the day. Terror has come to 
America and it is incumbent that we prepare to combat it at every turn, and in every way. Failure to do so, as 
demonstrated in Atlanta and Moriches Bay, NY can prove deadly.)</p>

<H2>THE FBI'S HOSTAGE RESCUE TEAM...</H2>

<BR>
By: Steve Macko
      Editorial Opinion
<BR>
The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation maintains a specially-
trained unit that is called the Hostage Rescue Team (HRT).  By its very 
name, one can tell what the primary mission of the team is.  Some
Counter-terrorism (CT) experts say that the HRT should engage ONLY in
hostage rescue and nothing else, such as getting involved in high-risk
arrest situations or in drug raids.  Having this team engage in only
one kind of mission may seem wasteful of this highly-trained law
enforcement resource, but we will explore the various reason as we go
along.
<P>
Should a situation arise when domestic or foriegn terrorists or other
kinds of perpetrators take hostages in the United States and threatens
to kill these hostages unless particular demands are met by authorities,
officials come face-to-face with a very difficult choice.  If the 
hostage takers demands are met by the authorities -- it would encourage
similar terrorists that their demands could be met as long as they took
American hostages.  Meeting the demands of hostage takers would also
validate any claims that a terrorist would make.  So, on the whole,
these are not viable options.  What is viable and what is needed is a
rescue team that has been trained to a high-level of skill that would
kill or disable the hostage takers without harm to the hostages, themselves.
<P>

In the United States, this type of mission would fall upon the FBI's
HRT.  When hostages are taken, it is possible to delay the situation, for a 
period of time, with negotiations.  However, as the clock is ticking, the
danger to the hostages increases.  Even though it should not matter in the
situation, public concern and outrage to the situation would also increase,
thus throwing additonal pressure upon the people whose job is to resolve
the situation and, in turn, could cause mistakes in judgement.  The
longer a hostage situation, of this type, with terrorists, continues --
the danger to the hostages does increase.
<P>

There is a train of thought amongst law enforcement SWAT or Special Response
teams that in hostage situations you wait ... and wait ... and wait ...
until Hell freezes over, if necessary.  While this may be the proper 
response to a distraught man who has been overcome by a myraid of personal
problems in a short period of time and takes his family hostage and
barricades himself in his home -- those same tactics of waiting and
negotiating will not work when dealing with the likes of a terrorist
team that has received special training at a terrorist training camp
in Lebanon.
<P>  

Most of our allies in other countries such as in Great Britain, France
and Germany, have developed special teams trained to deal with these
type of situations.  I can not speak about Israel, even though I know 
that such teams must exist -- I know very little about the Israeli teams.
These teams in other countries have been developed along military lines.

<P>
These special teams have been developed, trained and are equipped to
handle well-armed and determined opponents and have a very good chance
of being able to minimize the loss of hostage lives.  The methods of
these teams in resolving a hostage-taking situation are not designed to
encourage further acts of hostage-taking by any other group of people
who may contemplate such an act in the future.  The catalyst for the
development of these teams is acknowledged to be the Israelis and their
successful 1976 rescue of hostages from Entebbe, Uganda.
<P>

The members of the Hostage Rescue Team of the FBI have been well selected, 
trained and equipped.  In a demonstration at Quantico, Virginia, in 1993,
two FBI agents sat as hostages surrounded by mock-ups of terrorists in a
building.  In a matter of seconds, and out of nowhere, the HRT had entered
the building and would have surprised, stunned and disabled/killed the
terrorists without any harm coming to the hostages.  The training exercise
was conducted with live ammunition, even though there were "live" hostages
present.
<P>

The rules of engagement in such a scenario must be different from those
of a typical arrest situation.  No unnecessary harm should ever come to
a suspect.  However, in situations in which known terrorists are being
dealt with -- the rules of engagement MUST be changed.
<P>  

Police officers, are generally trained to ask questions first, or identify themselves, 
make sure that their life or the life of someone else is in imminent
danger and then take lethal force, if necessary.  This kind of thinking
and mentality is not proper in dealing with terrorists because the first
one who hesitates ... is dead.  A totally different psyche is required.
Shoot first and ask questions later, will more than likely keep the rescue
team member alive.
<P>  
It is known that the members of the U.S. Army's Delta Force, who would deal with such situations in a foreign country, if needed, take the attitude of two shots to the head of any terrorist whom they encounter in a raid situation.  This attitude was learned from the British SAS.  Most people find this kind of attitude, even
toward terrorists, as appalling.  However, it is necessary because that
very attitude WILL save lives.  Most police officers, because of their
training, are frankly not suited to deal with these situations that
require no hesitation in carrying out a mission.
<P>
Again, going back to our terrorist hostage-taking scenario, if nothing
is done and the clock continues to tick -- there is a very real threat
that the hostages will be killed by their captors.  If a rescue attempt
is anticipated, the hostages most certainly will be killed -- so this
requires another skill of a rescue team -- that of concealment and stealth.
The normal rules of arrest make no sense in these situations.  Forbidding
a rescuer from shooting except when immediately necessary to prevent the
escape of a dangerous suspect or to defend oneself or others would, in
this kind of situation, cost innocent lives.
<P>

The equipment and arms of the Hostage Rescue Team is very different
from the usual weapons of law enforcement officers on the street.  The
weapons of the HRT are much more lethal.  Automatic weapons and long-range
rifles are used.  Even the attire that is worn is carefully selected to
provide camouflage and even to psychologically create fear when an
assault takes place.
<P>

For the reasons stated above, it is, on a whole, unwise to use the FBI's
HRT team for anything else other than what their name implies -- Hostage
Rescue.  Their training and their use of a different set of rules of
engagement are not appropriate for the purposes of making arrests, even
if dealing with armed and/or defiant suspects.  Their constant use with
TV news stories showing their weapons, attire and tactics plays into the
hands of the large number of people who are paranoid and who fear federal
law enforcement.  This is part of the reason why the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms is under such fire.  The agency is being portrayed,
by many, as Nazi stormtroopers.
<P>  
As with anything else, there is a cost to this.  Maintaining a team whose
sole and only purpose is to rescue hostages requires very special people
who would be willing to constantly work and maintain skills that most
likely will only rarely, if ever, be called upon -- is difficult from
a morale standpoint.  
<P>
Techniques used by military rescue teams to keep
morale high would have to be looked at.  Secondly, other types of teams
would have to be developed, trained and equipped for the purposes of
high-risk arrests.  It is believed that these costs would be low compared
with the loss of citizen support for federal law enforcement in the face
of the Waco TX and Ruby Ridge ID situations that turned out to be less
than successful operations.

<font size=5><strong>Airport Safety and Security; &quot;Minimal Acceptable Standards&quot;</strong></font><br>
By: Clark Staten, ERRI Senior Analyst<br>
<br>
Chicago, IL, July 23, 1996 (ENN) -- As the evidence and bodies from TWA Flight 800 are being gathered from the 
ocean floor near Moriches Inlet, at least some Americans are beginning to ask realistic questions about 
airport/airplane safety and security. An historical analysis of the past few years and a recent spate of sometimes 
unexplained airplane crashes and terrorist incidents would suggest that the flying public may be in greater danger than 
ever before. <br>
<br>
In order to better understand the foundations of the security systems that protect us when we fly, let's examine some 
preliminary observations made by the Emergency Response &amp; Research Institute in a continuing study of American 
airports: <br>
<br>
<img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> A majority of the people operating baggage screening systems in airport terminals are &quot;contract security guards&quot;, 
hired by the airport authority or airlines to conduct these essential security checks. According to industry insiders, 
they have frequently received a only a minimum of training, often &quot;on-the-job&quot; and often taught by co-workers who's 
primary qualification, to be an instructor, is that they have simply been employed longer than the trainee. Almost all of 
these guards are unarmed and have no powers of arrest. Most of these guards are paid less than $10.00 an hour, 
many far less. Low pay, unreasonable expectations, and &quot;rotten working hours&quot; are said to contribute to high 
turn-over rates, assuring that few, if any, guards will have extensive experience. <br>
<br>
Demographically, most of the today's guards are entry-level youths, minorities, women, and/or retired or future law 
enforcement &quot;wannabes.&quot; In fairness to the these guards, it should be noted that is generally not their fault that they 
haven't received enough training or education to enable them to receive better pay; if the agencies that hired them 
trained them to higher levels, they would be expected to give the guards pay and benefits commensurate with their 
advanced knowledge and abilities. Airline insiders say that airport authorities, security companies, and airlines 
attempt to keep security payrolls to an absolute minimum.<br>
<br>
<img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> The x-ray equipment that they are operating may be several years old and work to varying degrees at various 
airports. Reports have been received by ENN, at some airports, of guards watching &quot;black&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, or &quot;snow filled&quot; 
screens that would make any sort of real detection of weapons or explosives impossible. Guards say that the federal 
requirement is that the baggage be screened, not that the guards actually be able to detect dangerous items. <br>
<br>
<img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> Magnometers (metal detectors), through which passengers must walk to detect weapons and other metal objects 
can be adjusted in sensitivity and are often &quot;turned down&quot; to avoid searching passengers, or slowing passenger flows. 
Or, at times of higher alert, they are turned up to such levels of sensitivity that they detect inconsequential items like a 
few coins in ones pocket or a belt buckle. Experts say that there are optimal settings for these machines, if only the 
guards were properly trained to use them. <br>
<br>
<img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> Ingress and egress points (outside perimeter guard post), at many airports, are often the venue of older or 
semi-retired guards. They too are often unarmed, although some may be former police officers or military men and 
may be permitted (in some jurisdictions) to carry weapons. Inspections of traffic entering and leaving the cargo areas 
of several airports is described by truck drivers as &quot;sporadic&quot;, and familiar looking vehicles (Airline vehicles, Fed-Ex, 
UPS, Air Cargo, catering firms, etc.) may not ever be inspected. <br>
<br>
<img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> To make matters worse, guard points are often located at ground level and very far apart. The only thing 
protecting most runways, taxi-ways, cargo areas, hangers, and even terminals is a chain-link fence, regularly topped 
with barbed-wire. At several airports, service and access roads wind through airports that would allow the public to 
drive within 50 feet or less of active taxiways, ramp areas, or airport buildings. Security surveys at several major city 
airports indicate that the easiest entrance onto airport premises would probably be by cutting though exterior 
perimeter fences at night or in bad weather and then moving to the desired area(s). All-in-all, a former military special 
operations Sergeant told ENN that almost all American airports would be considered easily attacked &quot;soft-targets&quot; 
by most terrorists. <br>
<br>
<img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> Aviation experts say that the issue of screening of checked baggage must also be given additional consideration. 
In the past few years, more sophisticated detection equipment has been developed that can &quot;sniff out&quot; explosives and 
use a computer &quot;Cat-Scan-like&quot; technology to get an automated and far clearer picture of potential devices hidden in 
checked baggage. Unfortunately, only two airports in the United States are currently using such equipment. Other 
facilities are waiting for the conclusion of a federal &quot;demonstration project&quot; that is testing the new equipment for the 
next two years. In light of recent threat levels, some experts have called for a shortening of this testing period, while 
others have advocated the immediate purchase of the new technology for America's larger airports.<br>
<br>
In summary, many aviation security insiders tell ENN that security threats against airports have changed, increased in 
sophistication, and become more numerous, while protection methods, personnel, and (inflation corrected) budgets 
have remained essentially the same. While they admit that some facilities are now making use of closed-circuit 
television, intrusion detectors, and some other modern technology, they say that terrorists and other malcontents may 
have advanced their knowledge and abilities to a greater extent. Almost every aviation expert interviewed for this 
article predicts that unless the FAA, airports, and airlines support and actually fund additional training for security 
personnel and the purchase of effective security monitoring equipment, that additional tragedies can be expected in 
the near future.<br>

<H2>RISING GANG VIOLENCE RESULT OF "TURF WARS"</H2>
By Amy Grant, Medical Correspondent
<P>
Chicago, IL. - The recent shootings of two Chicago Police
officers, and the wounding and killing of hundreds of other
Chicago citizens are the direct or indirect result of an
ongoing attempt by "streetgangs" from out of state to gain
control of given neighborhoods here, according to Clark
Staten, Executive Director of the Chicago-based Emergency
Response & Research Institute.  Staten, who studies all types
of emergency response issues, says that there are at least
four major "gang and drug" pipelines operating into and out
of the Chicago area.
<P>

According to the veteran paramedic, former police officer,
and intelligence analyst, one of the major "pipelines" leads
to New York.  This can be evidenced, he says, by the recently
announced fugitive status of three reported Jamaican gang
members who are suspected in the recent Chicago Police
shootings. In New York City, the "Jamaicans" are known as
some of the most violent and ruthless of gang members. The
Jamaicans are also known to be extremely "closeknit", and are
said to have a very closely held network of drug couriers to
and from the Caribbean.
<P>

New York City Police and Paramedics report a recent, violent,
expansion of their activities in the New York and New Jersey
area.  Distribution of drugs, particularly cocaine, is now
reportedly being carried out throughout other parts of the
country. Intelligence sources indicate that the "Jamaicans"
are now currently operating in the Kenmore/Winthrop corridor
on Chicago's Northeast side.  Further, they have reportedly
been attempting to gain control of drug traffic in several
Uptown and Roger's Park neighborhoods.  This has led to
several recent shootings and attempts at intimidation.
Reports have also been recieved of an ongoing conflict
between the Jamaicans and members of a Chicago gang called
the "Black Gangster Disciples" over the control of areas in
which to sell drugs.
<P>

A second and burgeoning "pipeline" leads to Los Angeles and
the "Crips" streetgang. Evidence of involvement by Los-
Angeles based gangs on Chicago's Westside is continually
being gathered by Chicago police and paramedics. On at least
two occasions weapons and explosives have been confiscated,
that supposedly belong to members of the now infamous
California gang.
<P>

For example, a November 4th, 1991 "raid" on a garage in the
1400 block of So. Ridgeway Ave. resulted the in the
confiscation of Seven (7) military fragmentation hand
grenades, three (3) Soviet "AK-47" Assault rifles, one (1)
Soviet "SKS" Assault rifle, one (1) British "Sten"
Machinegun, one (1) Ruger Semi-auto carbine, several 9mm and
.45 caliber pistols, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. A
burglary suspect that voluntarily helped to locate the
weapons is quoted as saying that the weapons belonged to a
member of the L.A. "Crips" street gang.
<P>

Reports have also been recieved that members of the "Crips"
are said have formed an temporary alliance with members of at
least two factions of the Westside Chicago "Vice Lords"
street gang.  The alliance is said to have involved the
outright distribution of large quantities of drugs and the
trading of guns for drugs.  The "Vice Lords" are said to
control much of the drug traffic on the Westside and are
thought to expanding into other areas of the country.
Reportedly there are Chicago connected "chapters" of the Vice
Lords in such unlikely places as Green Bay, Wisconsin and Des
Moines, Iowa.
<P>

Due to a desire for expansion by both the Chicago and L.A.
gangs into untapped drug markets, a reputable crime analyst
who has requested anonymity, says that in some ways the
linking of the "Crips" and "Vice-Lords" is "an evil natural".
He said, "They both are in it for the money... and in
Chicago, the Vice Lords already control much of the traffic
on the Westside".  "They either have to form some sort of
strategic alliance or fight each other for each block and
street corner", he continued.
<P>

"If they combine forces, the `Vice Lords' obtain vast
quantities of drugs and exotic weaponry, and the "Crips' are
afforded the protection that they need to operate in a
`hostile' environment", he continued.  "In the case of any
out-of-state expansion their combining resources makes good
business sense because, together, there is often no one with
the power to fight the two of them... in the smaller towns
that they are now invading", he told EmergencyNet NEWS.
<P>

"Presently, the violent struggles are about determining who
gets what share of what territory and how the `spoils' will
be distributed", the veteran reviewer said. "There are also
several groups that do not want to form any sort of alliance
and are protecting their `turf' with automatic weapons and
explosives... the large numbers of dead and wounded in recent
months are the results of this resistance", the analyst
concluded.
<P>

An informed drug enforcement agent say that there is also
evidence of the "Crips" attempting to also gain a foothold on
parts of Chicago's Southside. Recent reports have been
received that suggest that members of the "Crips" have been
linked with selling drugs and guns in the vicinity of the
Chicago Housing Authority's Robert Taylor Homes.
<P>

Another report indicates that members of the "Crips" are
thought to be fighting with members of both the "Black
Disciples" and the "Gangster Disciples" in order to further
drug distribution networks in the Chicago Housing Authority
projects. There is a definite difference between the two
Chicago groups, and they also frequently shoot at each other
for control of the "valuable" drug territories in the South
State Street corridor.
<P>

The third drug "pipeline", leads to Mexico and several points
South of there.  It involves the "Hispanic connection". The
largest hispanic gang in the city is the "Latin Kings".  They
have various chapters throughout the city and are known for
their participation in and control of narcotics sales, in the
neighborhoods that they frequent. The "Latin Kings" are also
known as one of the most violent street gangs in the City of
Chicago.
<P>

Involvement has been reported between the notorious "Herrera
Drug Family" and the "Latin Kings".  Although several family
members are in jail, the Herrera's were previously known to
be the distributors of high potency Mexican "Brown Heroin"
that has been popular at various times with Chicago's
"Junkie" population.  The "Latin Kings" also deal in large
amounts of cocaine.  It is believed that it is smuggled from
Peru and Columbia, through Mexico, by gang "mules" of Mexican
descent.  Reportedly, more than one "Latin King" has returned
to Mexico or Central America "for a short vacation" and soon
turned up "back in the hood" with a new car and lots of
spending money.
<P>

At least one Chicago analyst says that there are hints of a
direct connection between a faction of the "Latin Kings" and
couriers of the Columbia-based Mendallin drug cartel.  A
continued proliferation of regular and "crack" cocaine would
seem to signify significant supplies are constantly being
made available to members of the "Latin Kings".  Police
sources confirm that the "Kings" are frequently arrested for
possession of varying amounts of the high-quality and illicit
substance.  Police also say that the "Latin Kings" run
several "drive-up" drug delivery operations in the Humboldt
Park area of Chicago.
<P>

The fourth connection "pipeline" involves Asian-Americans,
particularly those of Chinese extraction. The links to the
old "Burma Triangle" drug production area, that were shown to
have been exploited throughout the Viet Nam War, are still
thought to be active in a small segment of the Chinese
community.  Although extremely difficult to infiltrate, some
drug intelligence information has still been obtained that
indicates that there is an "Asian Connection".
<P>

The primary drugs provided by the Asian drug couriers are
"Poppy-based" and generally involve the addicting opiates.
"China White" Heroin is a particular example of the type of
drugs that are sold, often in bulk, by Asian wholesale
dealers.  Many, if not most, of the transactions involve
sales by Chinese "merchants" to black or hispanic middle-men,
who then sell them to street level dealers.  There are also
Asian "street gangs" who are used as enforcement tools by the
drug dealers.  Although small in number, the members of the
"Asian Connection" are thought to control a substantial part
of the heroin Traffic in the Chicago area.
<P>

Staten points out that not all drug transactions are
exclusively tied to "streetgangs", and that there are
numerous unorganized sources of purchase.  Traditional
organized crime is also responsible for a sizable percentage
of the drug traffic in the Chicago area, according to Police
crime statistics.  Although commonly involved in
prostitution, gambling, extortion, and protection rackets,
the "mafioso" is reportedly now heavily involved in drug
distribution in the Midwest and elsewhere.  This is unlike
several years ago, when the "Wiseguys" were prohibited by
strict internal rules from trafficking in drugs.  Recent
years, however, have seen much "Mob" involvement in this most
profitable business.
<P>

In conclusion, Staten indicated that the ties between the
various groups mentioned are transient and often disjointed.
Further, he indicated that the dynamics of drug buying and
selling are based on a fairly traditional supply and demand
scheme that causes alliances and enemies to "change as
frequently as the weather". But, he noted, the violence
perpetrated by the combination of these groups is certainly
reason for everyone's concern. According to Staten, "The
continued proliferation of these gangs and drugs does
nothing...but, breed death and destruction for the rest of
us".  He strongly recommends that additional resources be
made available to Police to combat this growing menace.

<BR>
<P>      
                    
                                              
     You have one shot, one scoped sight, one compressed
controlled breath, one squeeze of a honed trigger.  In twenty
one-hundredths of a second, you will be either a ``hero'' who
saved an innocent life or an incompetent who caused the death of
a helpless hostage.  Fellow officers, department officials and
city administrators await the sound of your rifle.  Possibly,
the entire Nation sits riveted to television sets for news of
the outcome.  Life or death, success or failure, is only one
sensitive squeeze away.
<P>

     One of the most pressured situations in law enforcement
occurs when a police sniper is called upon to neutralize a
suspect.  In no other police encounter is so critical a
responsibility reduced to the perfect execution of one shot.
There is no room for error.  For example, in a recent hostage
incident, a police marksman's fire hit the suspect three times.
The shot was accurate, but not precise; deadly, but not
instantaneously so.  The badly wounded suspect survived long
enough to kill a female hostage before dying himself.
<P>

     The point here is not to criticize one officer's
performance under incredible pressures.  Rather, it is to better
understand these pressures and how to address them in police
rifle marksmanship training.
<P>

     This article summarizes the critical training techniques
that can contribute to perfect performance during an actual
police sniper engagement.  These special shooting exercises can
improve the likelihood of perfect one-shot performance, even
under physical and psychological stress.

<BR>
<H4>BACKGROUND</H4>
<BR>
<P>                                               
     The Minnesota National Guard Counter-Sniper School is a
7-day course for sniper teams, including those of law
enforcement.  At the beginning of the course, instructors issue
one live round to students and caution them that during the
final course of fire, they must hit a specially designated
target with this single round or fail the course.  Throughout
the training, students are continually reminded that their
success depends on hitting one target with this round.
<P>

     After 7 days of training, and a 10-shot record fire,
instructors provide students with a fresh round for the one
they've carried for the past week.  Then, each student is called
upon to engage one special half-size silhouette.  The stress
accompanying this shot is purely psychological and largely
self-induced.  No one shouts at the students; no physical stress
accompanies this special one-shot kill.
<P>

     Yet, based on experience, some 33 to 40 percent of all 
student snipers fail what is a relatively simple shot.  For those 
students who are police officers, the failure record is 1 in 12. 
These are the same students who achieved high scores in the 
preliminary 10-shot record fire.  In fact, at times, the same 
marksmen shot perfect record fires, only to miss the one-shot 
kill event.  In all probability, some special stress factors 
affected a sniper's performance when emphasis was placed on that 
one shot.  But the stress factors that emerge during training are 
similar to those a sniper must overcome to achieve perfect 
one-shot performance during a real incident.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>                  
<BR>
<H5>FACTORS AFFECTING PERFORMANCE  </H5>
<BR>
                         
<H6>``Know Thyself/Know Thy Rifle'' </H6>
<BR>

     To achieve near-perfect performance, police snipers must
develop complete confidence in their weapons and their
abilities.  To paraphrase an old adage, ``Know Thyself/Know Thy
Rifle.'' Since no two rifles fire precisely the same, officers
should be issued one rifle each exclusively for their own use
and should practice firing it under many different
conditions--summer/winter, day/night, close range/long range,
slow fire/rapid fire, uphill/downhill.  Snipers must know
exactly where the round will impact when set for a particular
distance.  Although for urban situations the zero at 100 yards
is best, firing at other zero-distances is recommended to become
familiar with the scope or to determine if the scope has a
bullet drop compensator.
<P>

     Firing only one type of round is also recommended.  The
round should be match grade, preferably of the same lot number.
Based on the rifle's performance, snipers should each develop a
``data card'' that notes precisely how the rifle is ``held'' or
``lead'' when engaging targets at various distances under
varying conditions.  Consistent use of these techniques develops
a sniper's confidence in the rifle, scope, zero, and ammunition,
so that the sniper knows with certainty where the rounds will
impact.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H6>Patience and Discipline                                         
</H6>

     By developing the qualities of patience and discipline
through a concept referred to as, ``This is the last shot for
the rest of my life,'' snipers become conditioned to regard each
round fired in practice as a single, final event with an exact
beginning, a definite end, and a standard for achievement.
During range fire, they should individually remove each round
from the cartridge box, load it, fire it, ``call'' it, observe
the results through the spotting scope, and then record it.
<P>

     Recording each shot individually is critical.  Police
snipers should each maintain a record book to note the history
of their fire with a particular rifle.  Not only does this help
snipers to concentrate on each shot, but it also helps them
identify minor deviations in the ``book'' data versus their
rifle and ammunition.  This generates information for the data
card.  For example, a sniper may learn that the first shot fired
in practice--the so-called ``cold barrel zero''--could vary by
several inches from subsequent shots.  It's only through such
exacting attention to detail that the sniper can develop into a
precision marksman who focuses not on three-shot groups but on
individual shots.
<P>

     Snipers should pace their practice fire by mentally
planning each shot, then analyzing it afterward.  It is also
useful to dry fire between each live-fire shot.  Only five
rounds should be fired into a single target to better focus the
shooter's concentration.  Also, accomplished marksmen should
fire no more than 15-20 rounds total during a practice session
to prevent them from sliding into undisciplined ``banging
away.''  By habitually applying these proven techniques during
practice fire, snipers develop the patience, concentration, and
discipline critical for precision shooting.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H6>Pressure to Perform</H6>
<BR>
                                      
     Pressure to perform is purely psychological and 
self-induced.  It is the result of allowing concentration to
waver once the person realizes others expect exceptional
performance.  It reflects a drop in self-confidence, a subtle
doubt that success is attainable.
<P>

     To perform successfully, police snipers must not allow 
themselves to feel rushed merely because someone gives them the
``green light.''  All doubts must be channeled mentally into
oblivion.  Contrary to belief, public competition does not
alleviate these doubts.  The pressure to perform when all
attention is focused on the sniper alone, by those who expect
perfect results, is totally different from the pressure
experienced during competition.  During the real incident, a
sniper is competing with no one.
<P>

     Again, learning to overcome external distractions by 
concentration is the matter at hand.  During some shooting 
exercises, snipers should fire individually while being observed
by teammates, as well as when they are experiencing noise and
light distractions.  Even the conspicuous presence of nonsniper
observers increases pressure during firing exercises.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H6>Perfection Expected </H6>
                                         
     The last factor, ``opening day syndrome,'' occurs when 
individuals suddenly find themselves facing a situation more
real than what was expected.  Police officers joke about rookies
who mistakenly trip the trunk release when reaching for the
shotgun selenoid switch.  While fate eventually forgives, this
is not so for police snipers.  Less than 100 percent achievement
when called upon to perform is not acceptable.
<P>

     Police snipers cannot be expected to learn from error,
except in training.  This is why proper training and practice
fire is so valuable.  Realistic training allows snipers to
prepare physically and mentally to function during a
stress-filled incident.  Just as other officers drill in
shoot/don't shoot scenarios and practical pistol courses to hone
their skills in realistic settings, so too must police snipers
train beyond ``bullseye'' shooting so that they can perform
effectively and turn the mechanical act of shooting into a
mechanical act of shooting accurately under pressure.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>

<H6>PRACTICAL SHOOTING EXERCISES   </H6>
<BR>
<P>
                               
    Taking into account the various stresses under which police
snipers must operate, exercises have been developed to help them 
acquire the qualities needed to perform--concentration,
patience, discipline, and confidence.  First, practice sessions
should be clearly divided into two phases--practice fire and
exercises.  During practice fire, officers fire at bullseye
targets individually and at their own pace, using a
prone-support position with bipod or sandbags.  They record each
shot and confirm their zero, thus preparing themselves for the
exercises that follow.
<P>

     In the second phase, snipers engage specially modified
silhouette targets.  Learning to focus on vital areas makes the
exercises more demanding.  Therefore, affixed to each silhouette
is a balloon, either on the head or center chest.  The size of
the balloon is proportional to distance--3 inches at 100 yards,
5 inches at 200 yards, 10 inches at 300 yards.  By using
balloons, a less-than-precise shot that otherwise would be
credited as ``excellent'' now becomes a complete miss.  And
psychologically, the instant feedback of watching a ``bad guy''
wave back causes snipers to resolve to hone their skills.
Likewise, confidence soars after repeated successes.  The
purpose of these exercises is not marksmanship practice, which
the sniper has already completed, but the application of it.
<P>

     To underscore further the emphasis of one-shot kills,
snipers receive only one round for each engagement.  If they
miss a balloon, they cannot engage it again.  This helps them to
recognize mentally the finality of each shot fired.  Also, to
instill a ``pressure to perform,'' snipers complete several
exercises individually while others watch or with external light
and sound distractions.  For variety, snipers fire the exercises
in daylight and at night under artificial illumination.
Interestingly, most students who fired well during the bullseye
practice have exaggerated expectations when they first fire
these exercises.  And typically, they initially miss. However,
after several drills, they quickly acquire the necessary skills
for successful engagements.
<P>
<BR>

<BR>
<H6>The Fleeting Target    </H6>
                                          
     This is the most frequent exercise used in training because
it almost duplicates reality.  The rifleman, who has been issued
a green light, knows generally where the suspect will appear,
but must wait until the target surfaces, which will only be for
a few seconds.
<P>

     At the start of the exercise, the snipers are allowed to
see the target and comfortably ``lock on,'' readying themselves
and their rifles for what could be a long wait.  Then, the
target is lowered and rotated.  At some point over the next 30
minutes, the target reappears only once.  Students start with a
15-second exposure, and as their skills improve, the time of
exposure lessens to 5 seconds.  This exercise helps riflemen to
develop patience and concentration.
<P>

     For ranges that lack rotating targets, the same simulation
can be achieved by a range officer with a stopwatch.  While
pacing back and forth behind the shooters, the officer suddenly
shouts, ``Green light,'' and slaps a particular shooter's leg.
This puts the shooter on notice that within the next 30 minutes,
the subject will appear and should be fired upon.  This version,
too, is conducted randomly.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>

<H6>Multiple Hostages                                                 
</H6>

<BR>
     In this exercise, two similarly colored balloons tightly
bracket a third balloon, which represents the suspect.  The
other balloons are the hostages.  If arranged horizontally, the
balloons indicate the need for a correct adjustment for wind;
vertically, they emphasize adjustment for trajectory/range.  By
adding hostages, the pressure escalates from concern for a
possible miss to concern for accidentally hitting a hostage.
Even a slight crosswind bounces the balloons about, requiring a
very carefully placed shot and forcing the highest level of
concentration.  Noise and light distractions and the presence of
observers enhance the pressure applied during this exercise.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H6>Surgical Shooting                                                 
</H6>
<BR>
     This timed exercise elevates the complexity level of
hostage rescue shooting.  Down range are three 8 1/2 x 11-inch
portraits juxtaposed on a target.  At the start of the exercise,
the shooters, positioned 25 yards from the firing line, are
allowed 10 seconds to study the mugshot of the suspect.  Then,
each shooter must dash halfway to the firing line, snatch one
round, low crawl the final 12 1/2 yards to the weapon, load it,
spot the correct suspect, engage the suspect, and dash back to
the finish line with the expended cartridge.  The timing starts
from the instant the shooters see the mugshot.  The exercise is
a ``no go'' if a shooter fails to hit the suspect, mistakenly
hits the hostage, or fails to bring back an expended cartridge.
This exercise teaches the student to focus on a suspect's face
instead of attire (to preclude changing clothes), as well as to
develop concentration, discipline, and physical conditioning.
<P>

     Using photographs of similar-looking people increases the
degree of difficulty.  For example, targets of all white males
with short hair, using side views of the suspect, or altering a
suspect's appearance with sunglasses or changing the hairstyle
or length of hair make it harder for the shooter to select the
correct target.  When firing from more than 150 yards, this
becomes a team event that requires both a sniper and spotter
with a spotting scope to ensure correct identification.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>

<H6>The Simultaneous Engagement                                       
</H6>
<BR>
     Three balloons are arranged exactly as in the multiple
hostage exercise, only this time there are one hostage and two
suspects.  This requires that two snipers engage exactly at the
same time.  One officer, called the base sniper, coordinates
fire with a partner, confirms each is ready to engage their
respective suspects, and then calls a ``three, two, one''
countdown.  Both fire when they hear the ``n'' in one.
<P>

     For the base sniper, this drill teaches how to control
breathing in order to be able to both fire and talk.  The
partner learns how to time fire the weapon so that an accurate
shot can be squeezed off at someone else's order.  In addition
to being useful against multiple targets, this technique can be
used to smash through plate glass with one round and take out a
suspect accurately with a round arriving a split second later.
<P>

     Noise and light distractions increase this exercise's
difficulty.  Also, voice-activated radios enable two snipers to
be positioned some distance apart.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>

<H6>Neutralizing Shots   </H6>
<BR>
                                             

     This exercise demands true precision, for it challenges the
shooter to place accurately a round in a suspect's neural motor
strips or brain stem, the tiny impact points for head shots that
neutralize a human almost instantly.  This is a ``no option
left'' engagement, because the suspect is pressing a weapon
against a hostage and anything but a neutralizing shot could
still allow the trigger to be pulled.
<P>

     Since the intended impact points are less than 2 inches
wide, this exercise should not be practiced or attempted from
more than 200 yards, although 100 yards is preferable.  The
targets should be life-size human head photographs, side views
for engaging the neural motor strips (above each ear), or a back
view for engaging the brain stem. These areas should be
highlighted, both to help the sniper focus on the correct impact
point and to evaluate the results clearly.
<P>

     This exercise can be made more demanding by imposing a time
limit, or by adding visual and noise distractions and the
presence of onlookers.  The most demanding level would be to
combine it with the fleeting target exercise.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>

<H5>The Fog of Battle    </H5>
<BR>
                                         
     This exercise pits three or more snipers against a single
target.  However, only one rifleman will actually fire and under
considerable peer pressure.
<P>

     Posted 100 yards down range is a single target board
displaying three different 8 1/2 x 11-inch facial photographs.
All sniper rifles are grounded on the firing line, and the
shooters are clustered behind the line, around the range
officer.  On the range officer's command, one or more smoke
grenades are released down range.  While the smoke builds, the
snipers study a mugshot identical to one of the target photos.
The range officer then gives one live round to each sniper.
When satisfied the targets are thoroughly masked by smoke, the
range officer issues the green light and all snipers rush to
their weapons.
<P>

     Peering through rifle scopes, the snipers wait for the smoke 
to dissipate enough to identify the correct photo.  The first 
shooter to shout, ``Got him,'' is the only one allowed to engage, 
and this shooter has 5 seconds to do so.  Some shooters ``call'' 
the target prematurely; others miss or don't even get a shot off. 
Others are prone to choke up in front of onlookers.
<P>               

     This exercise helps to overcome these handicaps, while 
helping snipers to gain confidence in each other's judgment and 
shooting abilities.  It can be repeated merely by having several 
sets of mugshots and photos/targets posted down range.  However, 
it must be conducted at 150 yards or less to facilitate 
identification through a rifle scope.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>                            
<H6>The Followup Shot  </H6>
<BR>
                                            
     This exercise is actually a contradiction to the philosophy
of one-shot kills.  In this drill, snipers must rebolt their
weapon instantly and prepare to re-engage the same target.  Why?
Even the most perfectly fired shot can be disrupted by a sudden
gust of wind, can be slightly deflected by an invisible wire, or
can result in only a wounding hit.
<P>

     For this exercise, two or more balloons are placed on a 
single silhouette.  The sniper is issued the same number of 
rounds, all of which are loaded into the rifle.  To add pressure, 
this is a timed event that begins when the first shot is fired 
and ends with the last shot fired.  Regardless of time lapsed, 
the shooter earns a ``no go'' if no balloon is hit.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>

<H5>CONCLUSION</H5>
<BR>
                                                       
     Accuracy is not the sole determinant of a police sniper's
performance.  Qualities such as concentration, discipline,
confidence, and patience must be honed to fire successfully
under pressure.  These procedures and shooting exercises can
contribute to a shooter being psychologically and physically
prepared to neutralize a suspect--one of the most pressured
situations in law enforcement.

<H2>FBI Agent Killed in Philadelphia Drug Case</H2>

An FBI agent was killed in a shootout while trying to buy drugs
from a reputed drug dealer.  The drug dealer was also killed.
Special Agent Charles L. Reed, age 45, a 16-year veteran of the
Bureau, and a suspect, identified as Jonathan Cramer, met in a
hotel parking lot and sat inside of a car.  Special Agent Reed 
was wearing a body microphone that taped the transaction on
Friday (03/22).

The suspect, Cramer, was heard on the tape, saying, "I don't
know if I can trust you.  I want to look in the suitcase and
see if you have a wire."
<P>

At news conference, a very upset FBI Director Louis J. Freeh
said, "They killed each other.  This was an extraordinary,
committed agent who never said no, who worked harder than
anyone in this division."
<P>

Reed was in the backseat of the car and Cramer was in the
front passenger seat.  Another person was in the driver's
seat.  Police would not elaborate on many portions of the
incident.
<P>  

Special Agent Reed was said to be shot several times and
the 24-year-old suspect was shot twice.  Once in the head
and once in the upper chest. Police said that no drugs were recovered and the transaction
was supposed to involve a negotiation over a kilogram of
cocaine.
<P>

Special Agent Reed was the 46th Special Agent of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation to die while in the line-of-duty in
the 87-year history of the Bureau.  He was also the first
Philadelphia-area agent to be killed in more than 30 years.
<P>
ENN sends its prayers and condolences to the family, friends, and co-workers of Agent Reed. Sadly, he is one of far too many officers to die while in the performance of their duties during 1996.

<H2>Israeli Defense Industries Announce New Assault Weapon</H2>

<IMG SRC="/isrl203.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>

The new Israeli weapon of the future...the M-203. The weapon, still not in use, is reportedly first going to be issued to the elite commando-reconnaissance units of the IDF in the future.
<P> 
<B>Some facts and figures about the weapon. </B>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>1. Designed by Israel Military Industries. 
<LI>2. The IDF gave the inner mechanism and barrel to artists and told them  to design the gun to fit the body. 
<LI>3. There are no sharp edges on the gun. 
<LI>4. It has an aerodynamic design - nothing to catch clothing or fingers on.
</UL>
<P>
<B>Some of the highlights: </B>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>1. On the grip, directly behind the trigger, there are built in handgrips,  rubber bumps, protruding from the weapon so that a soldier never looses  his grip, even after holding it a long time. 
<LI>2. The shoulder stock is contoured to the anatomy of the shoulder. It  "fits" in the shoulder and doesn't move.  
<LI>3. The handgrip by the trigger has protection so that in the event of slippage, the hand cannot be injured. 
<LI>4. The spacing around the trigger allows for the infantry soldier to  comfortably operate the weapon while wearing warm gloves.
</UL>
<P>
<B>Specs</B>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>1. The gun, including night sights, and a magazine with 30 rounds, weighs 3.5  kg. That is 1 kg. more than the M-16.
<LI>2. The weapon is classified as an assault rifle with multiple uses. It is  good for anti-terror missions, because it can be equipped with a silencer. An optical long distance "sight" can also be added. It comes standard with a laser sight enabling it to be used in night or low-light combat.
</UL>
<P>
Sorry - the caliber of the weapon is not specified at this time.

<p><font size=5><strong>ISRAELI-PLO PEACE AGREEMENT . . . <br>
CAUSE OF FURTHER TERRORISM??<br>
</strong></font>By Clark Staten, Senior Editor<br>
EmergencyNet NEWS Service </p>
<p><font size=4>ERRI Terrorism Event Summary - 09/14/96 to 10/12/96</font></p>
<p>Chicago, IL - A major paradox has been created by the stunning peace agreement between Yassar Arafat and 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. While the bargain has seemingly solved the immediate problems associated 
with members of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) living on the West Bank and Gaza strip in Israel, it also 
has provoked the anger of radical fundamentalists throughout the rest of the Mid-east. Since the day of the 
agreement that was formally signed in Washington, D.C., the response of Iran and other Islamic Fundamentalists has 
been rapid and violent. </p>
<p>On Sept. 14, 1993, the day of the agreement, Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said, in a Tehran radio 
broadcast, that the PLO had &quot;committed treason against the Palestinian people&quot; and that the signing of the historic 
peace agreement was &quot;a treacherous step . . . with the crippling result of divisions within the Islamic nations of the 
world&quot;. Rafsanjani went on to condemn Jordanian and PLO leaders who would &quot;even sit at the same table with the 
Israeli leaders&quot;. Further, Rafsanjani then called for continued &quot;jihad&quot; against both Israel and the United States. </p>
<p>On the same day in Beirut, Lebanon, an estimated 7,000 Hezbollah members and Pro-Iranian Islamic supporters 
vowed to topple the Lebanese government and overthrow sectarian rule in the battle-weary country. The outrage 
was prompted by the killing of eight protestors, who were shot by government troops on Sept. 13th, as they 
marched to demonstrate their anger with the Israel/PLO peace accord. Sheikh Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, leader 
of the Pro-Iranian Moslems in Lebanon, said prayers over the dead militants and denounced both the Lebanese 
government and the peace agreement. Reportedly, the Hezbollah and ten (10) other radical Palestinian factions all 
criticized the peace arrangement and vowed revenge against both Arafat and the other parties to the promise. </p>
<p>In Egypt, the militant Al-Jihad party (Holy Struggle) warned Palestinians and other Arab governments that the peace 
agreement was a &quot;sell-out&quot; of everything that the Palestinians had worked and prayed for, and that those that actively 
participated in the accord were to be considered &quot;targets of an angry people&quot;. Al Jihad, which continually calls for 
the complete destruction of Israel, is an offshoot of the original organization by the same name that is thought 
responsible for the 1981 killing of Anwar Sadat. Al-Jihad policy is thought to be influenced by the indicted radical 
Sheikh Omar Abdul-Rahman. </p>
<p>At least two radical Palestinians in Israel are displaying their personal displeasure with the Israeli/PLO covenant in a 
far more obvious and ominous manner. On Sept. 12, 1993, a suicide bomber rammed his car, filled with extra 
gasoline tanks, into an Israeli prison bus and injured two Israeli citizens. On Sept. 14, 1993, a suicide bomber burst 
into the courtyard of a Gaza strip police station and detonated an explosive device that was attached to his body. 
Fortunately, the courtyard bomber only killed himself and no other people were reported hurt. An unnamed police 
official said, however, that this little-used tactic was demonstrative of the fanatic nature of the protest over the peace 
treaty between the two former enemies. </p>
<p>By Sept. 15th, the Islamic militants showed their annoyance with Russian concurrence, with the peace agreement, by 
hijacking a Tupolev-134 passenger jet from Azerbaijan and causing it to be flown to Oslo, Norway. Although the 
skyjacking ended in a peaceful manner, counter-terrorist analysts said that it was largely symbolic. They say that it 
was intended to warn the former benefactors of several terrorist organizations that they too can suffer the effects of 
supporting goals that aren't in accordance with the &quot;Islamic Revolution&quot;. Although details are sketchy, this skyjacking 
is thought to be only one of several recent terrorist events conducted against the former Soviet Union. </p>
<p>Thursday, Sept. 16th, saw Israeli troops open fire on a rally being conducted by the Hamas Islamic organization in 
the occupied Gaza strip. Reportedly, four people were wounded. The four were part of an estimated 5,000 
protestors who participated in a violent assemblage that took place just North of the Jabalya refugee camp on the 
Gaza. Local reports say that the demonstrators were seen burning Israeli flags and that chants were heard that 
threatened the assassination of PLO leader Yassar Arafat. Intelligence briefings also showed that several documents 
were presented to the crowd that demonstrated that Syrian and Egyptian Islamic Fundamentalists were urging an 
&quot;open fight&quot; against the peace pact. </p>
<p>Sept. 19th brought two additional announcements from Beirut, Lebanon and Damascus, Syria. Iran's spiritual leader 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called for a &quot;counter-attack&quot; against the peace accord, in a speech delivered by an Iranian 
envoy to a meeting with Palestinians opposed to the covenant. In Lebanon, Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan 
Nasrallah whipped a crowd of 8,000 supporters into a frenzy, with calls of &quot;Victory to Islam; Death to Israel . . . 
War . . . War until Victory&quot;. Both statements were seen by experienced analysts as a prelude to greater violence, 
perpetrated in the name of Islam and against Arafat and the Washington brokered peace agreement. </p>
<p>On Sept. 21, 1993, in Tunis, Algeria, Tunisian authorities tightened travel restrictions for any Palestinians entering the 
country. Official sources say that they fear assassination attempts against Yassar Arafat and his top party members. 
Reportedly, credible threats have been received from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General 
Command (PFLP-GC), the Fatah-Uprising Organization, and the Popular Struggle Front. These organizations are 
based in Syria. A total of ten Middle- Eastern Palestinian organizations have reportedly issued statements opposing 
the PLO/Israeli agreement. Tunis has been the &quot;home&quot; of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) since 1982, 
when Arafat fled Lebanon in the face of an Israeli military invasion. </p>
<p>Sept. 29th brought an attack of another kind, on another front. According to the National Broadcasting Company 
(NBC), a Syrian-based counterfeit operation has been begun against the United States. NBC said that the 
Islamic-backed operation may have produced as much as $200 million dollars in bogus one-hundred dollar bills 
($100.00); the money to be used to purchase weapons on the open market and to &quot;finance international terrorist 
operations&quot;. Although sources at both the U.S. Treasury Department and the U.S. Secret Service would neither 
confirm nor deny the plot, several independent counter-terrorist analysts say that they believe an active investigation 
is underway to determine the makers of the bogus currency. Fears have been raised that the forgeries may undermine 
world confidence in U.S. money and help the terrorist to purchase more sophisticated weapons than ever before. </p>
<p>The &quot;Swords of War&quot; began to clang again in another unexpected location by October 3rd. A Libyan newspaper 
was quoted by the Rueter's News Service as calling for a reopening of the Mathaba &quot;Revolutionary Center&quot; in 
Tripoli. Mathaba, in the early 1980's, was a &quot;hotbed&quot; of revolutionary activity and the site of annual speeches by 
Libyan strongman Mohammar Qaddafi. It was closed last year by the Libyan parliament in what was viewed as an 
attempt to portray Libya as a less controversial state. Reportedly, the official Libyan News Service, JANA, said that 
the Mathaba was &quot;needed now more than ever&quot; in the face of the Israel/PLO situation. </p>
<p>The 4th of October brought the battle back to the West Bank of Israel and another suicide bomber, who drove his 
car filled with explosives into the side of an Israeli bus and injured forty (40) people. Reportedly, the attack came at 
7:30 a.m., just as people were going to work. The bombing was described by eye-witnesses as being &quot;highly 
powerful&quot; and directed at disrupting the Jewish settlement of Beit El, which is located just North of Jerusalem on the 
West Bank. Official reports say that the only person killed was the bomber, and that he was believed to be a 
member of the Islamic group Hamas. Hamas leader Abdel Aziz Rantissi was quoted by the United Press 
International (UPI) as saying that the attack &quot;expresses the feelings of the Palestinian people regarding the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement&quot;. </p>
<p>By October 6th, Col. Mohammar Qaddafi had found a voice that has been absent since the 1986 U.S. bombing of 
Tripoli and his personal compound. Qaddaffi is quoted by his own official news service (JANA) as telling fellow 
Libyans to prepare for &quot;armed confrontation&quot; with the United States and other Western powers. Qaddaffi, 
reportedly elated by recent Islamic militancy, called for Libyans from the Southern part of the country to &quot;go North 
to the point of confrontation . . . to defend the Mediterranean Coast against the `Western Invaders'&quot;. In recent days, 
Qaddaffi has again refused to hand over two Libyans accused of blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988. Analysts 
fear that Qaddaffi may still be a prime supporter and supplier of Islamic terrorist organizations. </p>
<p>In the past five (5) days, many cross-border attacks are believed to have been carried out by Hezbollah, Hamas and 
PFLP-GC commandos. During the weekend, as many as six (6) separate incidents of violence, shelling, and 
infiltration were reported in the area of the Lebanon/Israeli border. Two Israelis were killed in the Wadi Klet area of 
the West Bank on Saturday, with the Islamic Jihad taking responsibility for the atrocities. A PFLP-GC guerrilla who 
was thought to be attacking the Israeli settlement of Nayaraya by sea, was killed by Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), 
also on Saturday. EarlTuesday morning, a four-man squad of Islamic Jihad fighters clashed with an Israeli army 
patrol as they attempted to infiltrate the Lebanese/Israeli border. One Israeli and all four fundamentalists were killed. </p>
<p>As the level of Islamic revolutionary rhetoric increases, and the day of implementation of limited self-rule draws 
closer, the level of violence appears to also dramatically increase. The ecstasy and promise of &quot;peace&quot; that unfolded 
on that sunny day in September, in the White House Rose Garden, seems to continue to be lost in a bloody struggle 
for Palestinian control and autonomy. One can help but wonder if Yassar Arafat and the Fatah faction of the PLO 
were but a tiny segment of a larger problem, and that by making peace with them, the West has further angered the 
&quot;Islamic Beast&quot; that will soon strike again at the United States and her allies. America needs to be in readiness for 
such an eventuality. </p>

<H3> The FBI's Domestic Counterterrorism Program</H3>
<P>

Recent news commentary has suggested that the FBI is hamstrung in its
efforts to combat domestic terrorism. One former FBI official was quoted as
saying that "you have to wait until you have blood on the street before the
Bureau can act." Steven Emerson has asserted that the FBI is severely
restricted in infiltrating known extremist groups, that it has no terrorism
data base like the CIA's, and that it is powerless to stop extremist groups
from masquerading as "religious" groups.
<P>

All of these claims are incorrect. Persons concerned about addressing the
threat of terrorism need to begin with a clear understanding of current FBI
capabilities, which are in fact broad.
<P>

<HR>

<BR>   
<H5>  Attorney General Guidelines</H5>
<P>


The FBI currently operates under a set of guidelines issued in 1983 by
Ronald Reagan's Attorney General, William French Smith. The Smith guidelines
were a modification of guidelines issued by Gerald Ford's Attorney General
Edward Levi in 1976. The Levi guidelines were criticized as being too
restrictive and cumbersome. Indeed, many of the criticisms of the current
guidelines are really the same criticisms lodged against the Levi
guidelines, which the Smith guidelines were intended to rectify.
<P>

The Smith guidelines make it absolutely clear that the FBI does not have to
wait for blood in the streets before it can investigate a terrorist group.
The guidelines expressly state: "In its efforts to anticipate or prevent
crimes, the FBI must at times initiate investigations in advance of criminal
conduct."
<P>

The threshold for opening a full investigation is low: a domestic
security/terrorism investigation may be opened whenever "facts or
circumstances reasonably indicate that two or more persons are engaged in an
enterprise for the purpose of furthering political or social goals wholly or
in part through activities that involve force or violence and a violation of
the criminal laws of the United States."
<P>

Indeed, the FBI is also authorized to open a preliminary inquiry on an even
lower threshold: The Bureau can begin investigating when it receives any
information or allegation "whose responsible handling requires some further
scrutiny." Preliminary inquiries can be conducted without headquarters
approval for 90 days, during which the FBI can conduct interviews, contact
confidential sources and previously established informants, and carry out
physical surveillance. Preliminary inquiries can be extended with
Headquarters approval.
<P>
<HR>
<BR>
   
<H5> Advocacy</H5>
<P>
One of the main purposes of the Smith guidelines was to make it clear that
the FBI could open an investigation based on advocacy of violence. While
urging respect for the First Amendment, the guidelines state: "When,
however, statements advocate criminal activity or indicate an apparent
intent to engage in crime, particularly crimes of violence, an investigation
under these guidelines may be warranted ... ."
<P>
<BR>
<HR>

    
<H5> How do the Guidelines work in practice?</H5>
<P>


In any given year, the FBI engages in approximately two dozen full domestic
terrorism investigations. Over the years since the Smith guidelines were
adopted, nearly two thirds of these full investigations were opened before a
crime had been committed. The FBI has investigated right-wing,
anti-government, anti-tax, paramilitary and militia groups under this
authority. The FBI's characterization of White American Resistance (WAR) is
typical: After opening a domestic terrorism investigation of WAR, the FBI
stated "No known acts of violence have as yet been attributed to WAR;
however, leaders of the group have been encouraging members to arm
themselves."
<P>

The FBI has been successful in preventing terrorist crimes before they
occurred. In 1993, for example, the FBI arrested several skinheads in Los
Angeles after a lengthy investigation determined that they has been
discussing and planning attacks on a black church, Jewish targets and other
religious targets.
<P>

Calling something a church or a religious organization does not immunize it
from investigation. In fact, a number of the white supremacist groups
investigated by the FBI had assumed a religious mantle, under the "Christian
Identity" philosophy. The FBI investigated under the terrorism guidelines
the Yahweh Church, a militant black group in Miami, and other religious
groups.
<P>

Nothing in law or logic prohibits the FBI from opening investigations based
on public source material or reports from private civil rights groups like
the Southern Poverty Law Center. The FBI opens investigations based on any
credible source, including news reports. For example, the FBI opened a civil
rights investigation into the Rodney King case as soon as officials saw the
broadcast of the videotape. And the Justice Department has met with abortion
rights activists to solicit information about groups that may be planning
attacks on abortion clinics.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>

    
<H5> Terrorist Information System</H5>
<P>


The FBI has a state of the art, on-line computer database known as the
Terrorist Information System containing information on suspected terrorist
groups and individuals. The system has over 200,000 individuals and over
3000 organizations or enterprises. The individuals indexed include not only
subjects of investigations but also known or suspected members of terrorist
groups, associates, contacts, victims and witnesses. The organizations or
enterprises include not only terrorist groups but also affiliated
organizations or enterprises. TIS allows the FBI to rapidly retrieve
information and to make links between persons, groups or events.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H5>  Issues to Be Considered</H5>
<P>
There appears to be a growing problem of disaffected loners who cut
themselves off from all groups. An increased effort to monitor
anti-government groups is unlikely to identify these loners, who may pose
the greatest threat. In this context, the enterprise concept that serves as
the basis of the Smith guidelines -- and that serves as the basis for calls
for greater infiltration of groups -- may be irrelevant.

<H2>Islamic Extremist Bombs Strike Bahrain and Algeria</H2>
By Clark Staten, ENN CT analyst
<P>

Chicago, IL, February 11, 1996 --In what is being viewed by
experts as a "dangerous escalation" of world-wide Islamic
extremist violence, bombs exploded today in both Bahrain and
Algeria. Two car bombs exploded in heavily populated public
squares of Algiers, killing at least 17 people and wounding 93
others.  In Manama, Bahrain, a device exploded in the lobby of
the luxury Diplomat hotel, injuring at least four people.  The
radical "Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain" claimed
responsibility for the hotel bombing. No official statement have
been issued in regard to the dual car-bombings in Algeria, but
Algerian military authorities there are blaming Islamic
militants.
<P>

Seventeen people were reportedly "blown to bits" by a major
blast that engulfed an area occupied by several newspaper
offices in the Belcourt area of Algiers.  Another 52 people were
wounded in the detonation, several of them critically.  The
blast occurred near the offices of the Le Soir d'Algerie and
L'Opinion newspapers.  A large crater was left by the bomb,
which totally destroyed the offices of several reporters who
also frequented the building.  Unconfirmed reports have been
received by ENN that at least two reporters were among the dead.
French and Algerian journalists have frequently been the target
of Islamic insurgents, and are often attacked by the
fundamentalists for their "disrespect for Islamic principles".
<P>

 A second devastating car bombing also struck the Algerian
capitol, early Sunday.  41 people were reported wounded. A small
imported car burst into a massive fireball in the Bab el Oued
section of the city. The device went off in front of a city
office and was said to have caused a general panic in the
neighborhood surrounding the scene. Emergency medical sources
said that several of the injured had suffered extensive injuries
and were unexpected to live. Witnesses described the scene as a
"bloody massacre", and said that blood, body parts, and cut-up
bodies littered the street shortly after the explosion.
<P>

In Bahrain, the "Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain"
called the local office of the Associated Press today (AP) and
claimed responsibility for a bomb that blew up the lobby of the
Diplomat hotel. The Diplomat is a luxury resort that is often
filled with foreign visitors, including many American military
and corporate officials. In a call to the AP, a unidentified
male reportedly said, "We put a bomb in the Diplomat hotel 20
minutes ago...after the feast...tell the government that we will
destroy everyplace." Counter-terrorist experts say that the
veiled threat refers to a feast that ends the Moslem religious
month of Ramadan. The feast, that is referred to in the phone
message, is expected to occur on approximately Feb. 19th or
20th, depending on the moon phase.
<P>

Guests in the hotel said that a "thunderous boom" that overtook
the hotel, followed by panic as the guests ran to escape the
lobby that was rapidly filled with smoke and the smell of
cordite. Although official casualty figures are unavailable at
the time of this report, at least four people were believed
injured and possibly more. Witnesses said that they saw
ambulances and wounded people being taken away, but that there
was much confusion in the vicinity of the hotel. No Bahrain
police officials could be reached by ENN for further official
comment.
<P>

Counter-terrorism analysts at the Emergency Response and
Research Institute say that Islamic-extremist inspired violence
is spiraling out of control in several countries in N. Africa,
the Mid-east, and Asia, and may be part of a larger pattern of
attempted Islamic domination of the affected countries.  They
urge extreme caution for all Americans anticipating travel in
these regions and say that they are becoming increasingly
concerned about the possibility of an imminent terrorist attack
on the United States.

<H3>Four SWAT Members Shot in Barricade Situation</H3>
By Steve Macko, ENN Managing Editor
<P>
Four members of the Gwinnett County, Georgia, SWAT team were 
wounded on Sunday (01/14) when they stormed a house to arrest a suspect.
The incident began late on Saturday when police where called
about a man, identified as 41-year-old Hoarce D. Trammell, Jr.,
was "acting strangely."  At just before midnight, Forsyth County
Sheriff's deputies spotted Trammell's pickup truck and a chase
ensued.  The chase was called off when deputies saw that Trammell
was driving dangerously.
<P>
A short time later, another deputy spotted Trammell's vehicle.
Trammell fired a shotgun at the officer in the car.  The shotgun
blast struck the patrol car's window.  The deputy was not hurt.
Trammell fled to his nearby home.  Forsyth County called Gwinnett
County for assistance.  Gwinnett County responded with a SWAT team
and a helicopter.
<P>
When officers surrounded the home, they attempted to establish
contact with the subject, but he did not respond.  Attempts were
tried by calling the home on the phone and by using a loudspeaker.
Tear gas was lobbed into the dwelling and subject still did not
emerge or make contact for about five hours.  A Forsyth County
officer said, "The guy absolutely would not make contact with us
over a four-to-five hour period."
<P>
It is decided that the Gwinnett County SWAT team would storm
the house.  As soon as officers hit the door they encountered
gunfire.  Four officers were hit in the shootout.  One officer
was shot in the knee, one in the hip, one in the leg and the
fourth received a wound to the leg and burns.  Trammell was
shot in the hand by officers and arrested.
<P>
Reportedly, at one point during the final confrontation, police
fired more tear gas into the house and a fire was started.  During
the fire, ammunition stored inside of the house detonated.  The
Police Chief of Gwinnett County said about his officers and the
shootout, "I don't know of anything they could have done differently."
This incident happened near Atlanta, Georgia.

<TITLE>Domestic Terrorism; Nature of the Threat</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<Center><H2>DOMESTIC TERRORISM; THE ENEMY FROM WITHIN?</H2></center>
<center><B>By: Clark Staten</B></center>
<P>

	On April 19th, 1995, America was deflowered. She lost her
innocence to a horrendous blast that brought down the front of
the Alfred P. Murrah Federal building in Oklahoma City, OK and
killed more than 150 people. Described in a variety of ways by
federal authorities and the media, this first major internal
attack has been called "domestic" or "homegrown" terrorism,
"Terror in the Heartland" and "Terror From Within".  Whatever it
has been called, the name is not horrible enough to adequately
describe the atrocity that has allegedly been committed by
Americans against Americans.
<P>  

     One thing is certain, most CT (counter-terrorist) analysts
and experts say that they did not predict this sort of internal
danger. Many knew that there were "right-wing" paramilitary
groups who expoused radical views and had screamed about
government intrusion into their lives.  They also knew that
there was disillusionment among the self-described "patriot",
"constitutionalist", and "militia" groups in regard to proposed
gun control laws. And, they knew that there were a number of
people who felt that the law enforcement raid on the Branch
Davidian Compound in Waco, TX  was a "massacre" perpetrated by
officers of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF).
<P>

 But, few say that they foresaw the devastating and brutal
incident that occurred in Oklahoma.  Most said that they may
have expected small scale "shoot-outs" and other minor violence
involving radical members of the paramilitary underground, but
few said that they expected a major bombing and mass murder of
fellow American citizens.  Obviously, another wake-up call has
occurred...this time involving a "domestic" threat.
<P>

<H3>Nature of the Threat</H3>
       First, it is important to preface the remainder of this
article by saying that terrorism, be its source from within or
outside the United States, is most often the product of a
frustrated extremist fringe of an otherwise well meaning group
of people.  In the case of a threat from extremist paramilitary
groups within the United States, evidence would suggest that it
is only a very small minority of people that are or could be
responsible for this sort of violent act. A vast majority of the
people involved in most conservative or so-called "right-wing"
organizations are law-abiding, well-meaning, responsible
citizens who work hard, pay their taxes, attend church regularly
and would never participate in anything remotely resembling the
catastrophe that occurred in Oklahoma. 
<P>
	Most also would not consider participating in any sort of
violent overthrow of our recognized government. And, most
believe, according to recent surveys, that the way to change the
political system is to use "ballots, not bullets". Many admit
that they are not happy with an allegedly "liberal ideology" of
the Clinton Administration, but almost all say that the way to
change the policies of the United States is to elect leaders who
are more in line with their political agenda...not kill innocent
women and children, as occurred in Oklahoma City.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>Identification</H4>
That said, let's explore the often shadowy world of these "home
grown" extremists. They essential fall into three or four
groups, each with a radical fringe. CT reports say that some of
these groups intermingle, while others are very separate,
compartmentalized, and security conscious.
<P>
<HR> 

<B>SKINHEADS</B>
<BR>

The "shock troops" of many of the white supremacist groups are
often called skinheads.  Most frequently 15-25 years old, white
males, with very short hair and nazi tattoos, these "enforcers"
of white supremacy ideals are often those that carry out public
and violent acts against people of color, Jewish people and
organizations, and others who disagree with their principles. 
<P>

Unofficial reports place the number of hard-core racial
skinheads in the United States at about 15,000.  Intelligence
reports suggest that they may have been involved in at least 31
murders, several hundred injuries, and numerous acts of mayhem
in the past five years. According to the FBI, youth crimes are
becoming more frequent and more violent. Skinheads and their
"hate crimes" are surely contributing to their share to this
disturbing trend.
<P>
<HR>
<B>Neo-Nazi Groups</B>
<BR>

According to law enforcement sources, several American Neo-Nazi
organizations are alive and well, and awaiting the onset a
"Fourth Reich" in America. Great believers in the teachings of
Adolf Hitler and concepts of "master races" and "racial purity",
the Nazis see themselves as an armed counterpoint to socialistic
or communistic elements in the United States.  Led by "skinhead
shock troops", several Nazi organizations are well known for
conducting public demonstrations, often as a precursor or
justification for violent confrontation with their adversaries. 
In recent years, CT intelligence sources have drawn direct links
between Neo-Nazi organizations, skinheads, and other white
supremacy groups...such as the Aryan Nation.
<P>
<HR>  

<B>Tax Protesters</B>
<BR>

Economics also play a role in some American's displeasure with a
centralized government. Any number of citizens have deeply
considered feelings about financially supporting a government,
with whom they ideologically disagree.  People in this group
advocate an abolishment of all federal taxes, while still
supporting local tax initiatives for schools, sewers, police and
fire protection, and other usual expenses of their communities.
<P> 
Most feel that a centralized federal government doesn't fairly
represent them and that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses
"repressive and invasive" tactics to collect "unnecessary" taxes
to support unwanted programs like welfare, foreign aid, and
environmental regulations.  The more radical among this group
refuse to file federal taxes returns or even to use a social
security number.
<P>
<HR>   
<B>Constitutionalists</B>
<BR>

Frequently, the most intellectual of those associated with this
group of extreme conservatives, the "constitutionalists" are
those that attempt to interpret the U.S. Constitution and the
Bill of Rights to justify almost any action by their compatriots
of the right.  Adherents to this philosophy often defend a very
literal rationalization of the words contained in the precious
documents that were used to found the United States, regardless
of the context in today's' more complex society.  In fairness,
some proponents of these concepts could be considered by some to
be the "Watchdogs" of our constitutional freedoms. The fine line
between defender of original intent or advocate of discontent is
often decided by the viewpoint of the observer of the
"constitutionalists". 
<P>
<HR>  
<B>Klu Klux Klan (KKK)</B>
<BR>

Well known for decades as major advocates of "white power" and
segregation of the races, the KKK continues to flourish in some
parts of the country.  The Klan, known for their burning
crosses, white sheets, and pointed hats, have reportedly been
involved in hangings and shootings of black people, bombings of
churches, and a number of other violent acts over the years.
Klan proponents are reportedly great believers in the coming of
a "racial holy war", which will someday pit Klan members and
other "white-thinking" Caucasians against people of color and
other members of the "ZOG" (Zionist Occupation Government).
<P>
Klan members allege that there is a major conspiracy between
Jewish people, white liberals, black, brown, yellow, and red
people, other "minorities", to take over the United States. Some
even go so far as to suggest that all of the people mentioned
above, with the help of United Nations troops, will soon
undertake a national campaign to repress white people, take away
their weapons, and imprison them in concentration camps.
<P>
<HR>    
<B>Militias  </B>
<BR>

The most openly militant of the conservative right wing are the
"citizen militias".  Dressed in combat fatigues, and carrying
assault weapons, they are known to participate in
paramilitary-style maneuvers and guerrilla training. Recognized
militia groups have been reported in at least twenty-two (22)
states. Membership estimates for each state vary, but they run
from as few as 50 to as many as several thousand.  The larger
organizations are located in the Mid-West and Western parts of
the United States, with notable groups in Michigan, Montana,
Idaho, Texas, Arizona, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia,
Pennsylvania, and Ohio.
<P>
With beliefs strongly rooted in the 2nd amendment of the U.S.
Constitution, the right to keep and bear arms, and the viability
of the "unorganized citizen militia", militia members openly
convey their views concerning the possible government
confiscation of their personally owned weapons and other
perceived infringements of their individual rights.
Unfortunately, there are also those that believe that it may be
necessary to undertake a "violent overthrow" of the present
government in order to protect their rights. Fearfully, it is
this later group, who may strongly react to any investigation of
their motives or practices by federal law enforcement agencies.
<P>
<HR>
<B>Least we forget: The Unabomber</B>
<BR>

In addition to the threat from "right-wing" extremists, another
domestic threat has been alive in the United States for at least
seventeen (17) years. It comes from a self-described
"environmental anarchist", who has been periodically mailing
package-bombs to members of the university, computer, airline,
and scientific community. He has been dubbed the "Unabomber" by
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and allegedly has killed
three(3) people and wounded another twenty-three (23) during his
extended rampage.
<P>
Allegedly, a man with a great affinity for trees and wood, his
most recent target is believed to be a Forestry association
official in Sacramento, CA.  According to law enforcement
officials, one of the hallmarks of his attacks, is the fact that
the homemade explosive devices always contain wooden pieces that
have been handcrafted. Additionally, experts say that many of
his devices are "explosive works of art", that always work
efficiently and are constructed in unique and ingenious ways.
<P>
The greatest current fear, among CT analysts, regarding the
Unabomber, is that he feels "upstaged" by the Oklahoma City
bombing and may decide that he must undertake a larger act to
make his political and ideological statements better known.  In
recent weeks, he has offered to discontinue his multi-year
bombing campaign if a major magazine will publish his personal
"manifesto" in its entirety, and investigators say that they
fear that he is becoming more unstable and may be less cautious
about what acts he might undertake in the future.  Experts say
that the Unabomber's past competence and technical capabilities
justify concern about his future plans. 
<P>
<HR>
<B>Conclusions</B>
<BR>

By now, and per usual, when reading one of these articles, you
are probably asking yourself...what's this got to do with me?? 
Isn't this article by that same guy who thinks he knows all
about terrorism...who's forever "crying wolf" and trying to
scare me and my family, by telling us about all of these
terrible things that happen in other parts in the world??  Does
he think that I will actually believe that something like
Oklahoma City could occur in my home town??
<P>
The answer and the hope is that...YES...that this article and
those that follow in this series will educate, inform and
provoke you to believe that "it can happen here...anywhere". 
These articles are intended to give you a knowledge base in
regard to the potential of the threat, a profile of the
criminals/terrorists, an understanding of the inherent tactics,
and a basis for planning to respond to an unexpected and violent
incident in the future.
<P>

In upcoming editions, we expect to report on and analyze the
April 19th tragedy in Oklahoma City.  We hope to alert you to
those facts that can help to save your life, provide you with
technical points, and to extensively report on the valiant
efforts of those that participated in the rescue in Oklahoma. 
We hope to give you both the "big picture" and the intimate
details of who, what, when, why, and how the Oklahoma City
disaster occurred.
<P>
We welcome your input, questions, and suggestions regarding the
both the scope and depth of this coverage, and will attempt to
provide you with as much information as becomes available in
regard to this complex and challenging rescue operation.

<H2>Profile of a "Tasmanian Devil"</H2>
Special to EmergencyNet News Service
<BR>
By Jeremy Zakis
<P>

The gunman, Martin Bryant of New Town, Tasmania, has officially been
charged on Tuesday during a bedside court hearing at the Royal Hobart
Hospital. The hearing that took about 5 minutes saw Bryant charged with
the murder of Kate Elizabeth Scott from Western Australia, one of the
diners in the restraunt. This charge is just the first of a number of
charges to be brought upon Bryant. The Proceeding took place with none
of Bryant's family present, only his legal counsel by his side.
<P>

Martin Bryant has been described as a wealthy 29-year-old with 
sun-bleached hair and pale blue eyes with a gentle look. But a 
search of his home and interviews with family, neighbours and 
friends revealed a bizzare and lonely life led by this man.
<P>

To some, Bryant was described as a happy and friendly person who 
always had a cheeky grin. Local hotel proprietor, Jim Laycock, 
described Bryant in a Channel Ten interview as being "a simple 
but nice" man who "had never done anything wrong". But to others, 
Bryant was a moody character with a love for 
firearms.
<P>

Several years ago Bryant had gained the trust of a middle-aged 
heiress.  Eventually being allowed to move in with her at her 
suburban home in New Town. Many rumored that the woman, spinster 
Helen Harvey who at that time was in her 60's, and he were lovers. 
One neighbour likened Bryant to one of the "strays she brought 
into the house, like all her dogs and cats".
<P>

Then in 1992 Ms Harvey was killed in a car accident in which 
Bryant was involved in also. Bryant suffered head injuries and 
no one is really sure how much he was affected by the accident. 
Some friends say he was never the same again. Bryant also started 
to react strangely, even laughing at the car accident.
<P>

Bryant inherited $650,000 after the accident but soon after 
suffered another major blow. Bryant's father committed suicide, 
leaving him a lonely man.
<P>

He continued to live in the New Town house after Ms Harvey's death 
and had always been a respectable person. However, 12 months ago he 
started to grow his usually short hair long and began taking on a 
'surfie' image. But one of his friends has stated that "as far as I 
know, he didn't go near the water". He was also described as "that sort of bloke, a bit hard to work out".
<P>

A search of Bryant's New Town house also revealed that there was more 
to him than met the eye. Weapons magazines and violent movies 
littered the floor and furniture in the house.
<P>

Neighbours have descrided Bryant as "Polite and well spoken, 
never agressive but he had a strange look". "He was obviously very lonely. 
There were very few people going in and out of the house. I felt sorry for him. 
And I made a point of talking to him".
<P>

But another neighbour has described him as causing "quite a few 
problems" when he lived on a farm east of Hobart several years 
ago with Ms Harvey.  Bryant use to sleep all day and walk around 
the property and other peoples properties at night, often firing 
a gun.  "You never knew what he might do because he was always unpredictable"
another woman said.
<P>

At school Bryant was described as "a good student" up until he left 
the New Town Boy's High School in year 10. "I can't believe he has 
done this; we're all stunned, absolutely stunned".
<P>

The tragedy in Tasmania has shocked and saddened the nation. At the 
hospital where Bryant is being treated, death threats have been made 
against him and during the night graffiti appeared on the hospital 
wall reading "An eye for an eye". For the residents of Tasmania this 
tragedy is beyond belief.  Occurring in a usually quiet, small 
community there mainly for the tourists. 
<P>

As the families and friends 
of the 35 victims come to terms with their losses, the police and 
politicians are wondering just how such a tragedy could occur. Calling 
and fighting for tighter gun laws and strict control on the importing 
of weapons. The Tasmanian parliament is having the week off as a mark 
of respect and at 10:30 on Wednesday morning the nation will stop for 
a minutes silence. 
<P>

But, nothing can be done now to help those 35 for 
whom it is too late. It will take many months, even years for the
residents to fully come to terms with what has happened. But even 
then, this terrible tragedy in Australian history will always be 
remembered, as the day a tourist attraction, became a killing field.

<H3>Pan Am Flt. 103 Disaster</H3>
<BR>

 The Government of Libya was responsible for the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103 on 21 December 1988. This reviews both evidentiary material
upon which the US indictment of two Libyan officials is based and
background information that establishes links between those indicted
and senior Libyan Government officials.
<P>

<HR> 
<H5>Summary</H5>
     Scottish authorities and the US Department of Justice have
charged two Libyans with carrying out the attack: Abd al-Basit
Al-Megrahi, a senior Libyan intelligence official, and Lamen Fhimah,
the former manager of the Libyan Arab Airlines (LAA) office of Malta.
The charges are based on clear evidence that Al-Megrahi, Fhimah, and
other unidentified coconspirators planned to bomb Pan Am 103 by:
<P>

     -- Obtaining and attaching an appropriately marked Air Malta tag
that circumvented baggage security measures and routed the bag
containing the bomb to the Pan Am feeder flight to Heathrow and then
to Pan Am 103.

     -- Setting the timer that activated the device so that the bomb
would explode about one hour after Pan Am 103 was scheduled to depart
Heathrow Airport in London.

     -- Using the knowledge and access gained from their official
status as representatives of Libyan Arab Airlines (LAA) to facilitate
the operation at Valletta's Luqa airport. This would have enabled them
to bypass security checks and ensure that the suitcase containing the
bomb was inserted into the baggage of an Air Malta flight to
Frankfurt.
<P>

     Al-Megrahi, a senior Libyan intelligence official, acted with the
approval of the highest levels of the Libyan Government. We believe
Sa'id Rashid--a leading architect and executor of Libya's anti-US and
antidissident terrorist policies for the last decade, and a member of
the Libyan Government's inner circle--was the senior government
official who orchestrated the attack. An operation of this
sophistication and magnitude, involving people so close to the Libyan
leadership, could have been undertaken only with the approval of
senior Libyan officials.
<P>

<HR>

<BR>   
<H5> The Case</H5>
<BR>
     The US indictment is based on evidence directly linking Libyan
officials to the suitcase containing the bomb and its insertion into
the baggage system. The evidence also directly links Al-Megrahi to the
Swiss company that manufactured the timer used in the attack.
<P>
<BR>
  
<H6>The Suitcase</H6>
<BR>
     Forensic analysis has identified the bag that contained the Pan
Am 103 bomb as a brown, hard-sided Samsonite suitcase. The following
evidence links Al-Megrahi and Fhimah to the suitcase:
<P>

     -- Al-Megrahi, traveling in alias, arrived in Valletta with
Fhimah from Libya on the evening of 20 December 1988--the day before
the bombing. Fhimah, the former manager of the LAA office in Valletta,
retained full access to the airport. Al-Megrahi and Fhimah brought a
large, brown hard-sided Samsonite suitcase with them into Malta on
that occasion.
<P>

     -- Scottish investigators traced clothing that had been packed in
the bomb suitcase to a Maltese clothing shop. A Libyan bought the
items several weeks before the bombing, most likely on 7 December
1988. Airport arrival cards demonstrate that Al-Megrahi was in Malta
on 7 December.
<P>

     -- In February 1991, Al-Megrahi was described as resembling the
Libyan who had purchased the clothing items.
<P>
<BR>

<HR>
<BR>
   
<H5> The Bomb Insertion</H5>


     Frankfurt airport records for 21 December show that an
unaccompanied bag was routed from Air Malta Flight 180 (KM 180), out
of Valletta's Luqa airport, to Frankfurt, where it was loaded onto the
Pan Am 103 feeder flight to London. The evidence indicates that a
properly marked Air Malta baggage tag would have routed the suitcase
containing the bomb to John F. Kennedy Airport in New York via Pan Am
103. The following evidence implicates Al-Megrahi and Fhimah in this
process:
<P>

     -- Fhimah's diary contains a reminder for 15 December 1988 to
pick up Air Malta tags--a violation of airport and airline
regulations. Other diary notations indicate that Fhimah accomplished
this task.
<P>

     -- According to Luqa airport records and staff, the baggage for
KM 180 was processed at about the same time as their bags for a Libyan
Arab Airlines flight (LN 147), bound for Tripoli.
<P>

     -- Al-Megrahi, still traveling in alias, boarded LN 147 on the
morning of 21 December 1988, the same morning that the bomb was
inserted into the baggage of the KM 180 flight. Al-Megrahi's flight
back to Libya checked in at the same airport passenger check-in
counter as KM 180, and the check-in periods for the two flights
overlapped.
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
    
<H5> The Timer</H5>
<BR>
     A circuit board fragment recovered from the Pan Am 103 bomb was
part of a sophisticated electronic timer of a type that Senegalese
authorities discovered in the possession of two Libyan terrorists
arrested in February 1988. The timers, marked MST-13, were
manufactured by Meister et Bollier (MEBO), a Swiss electronics firm
located in Zurich.
<P>

     The MST-13 timers are unique. MEBO was the sole manufacturer. All
the MST-13 timers produced were delivered to the Libyans.
<P>

     MEBO provided the Libyan External Security Organization (ESO,
also referred to as Jamahirya Security Organization [JSO]) with 20
MST-13 timers in late 1985 and made no more MST-13 timers. Two ESO
electrical engineers commissioned and took possession of the timers:
Izz Aldin Hinshiri, Libya's current Minister of Communications and
Transport, and Sa'id Rashid.
<P>

     Al-Megrahi is a close relative and longtime associate of Sa'id
Rashid. At the time Rashid took delivery of the timers, Al-Megrahi was
his immediate subordinate.
<P>

     Al-Megrahi rented office space at MEBO and transited Zurich on at
least two occasions in December 1988.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>     

<H5>Libyan Government Responsibility</H5>
<BR>
     The conclusion that the Libyan Government approved the Pan Am 103
bombing is based on Abd-al-Besit Al-Megrahi's central and continuing
role in Libyan intelligence operations and on his close association
with Libyan Government officials who have implemented and directed
Libya's use of terrorism over the years as a tool of government
policy. The career progress of these officials over the years
indicates that the Libyan Government has consistently endorsed their
operations, tactics, and targets.
<P>
   
<H6> Al-Megrahi's Intelligence Responsibilities</H6>
<BR>
     Abd al-Basit Al-Megrahi's deep involvement in Libya's most
sensitive, high-priority procurement operations indicates that he
enjoyed the fullest confidence of Libya's leadership. We believe that
his contacts and experience in the fields of civil aviation, cargo
movement, and small business operations also provided him with a
ready-made infrastructure to support the staging of the Pan Am 103
bombing.
<P>

     Al-Megrahi is a senior intelligence official with strong ties to
Libya's military procurement apparatus and to the ESO. In 1987 he
became the director of the Center for Strategic Studies (CSS), a unit
that served the ESO and the Department of Military Procurement through
a variety of activities, including:
<P>

     -- Procurement of chemical weapons precursors. An Al-Megrahi
subordinate operating in Germany in 1988 played an important role in
acquiring and shipping chemical weapons precursors to Libya.
Al-Megrahi is also linked to a senior manager of Libya's chemical
weapons development program.
<P>

     -- Procurement of aircraft and aircraft components for the Libyan
military and LAA. Badri Hasan, another close collaborator of
Al-Megrahi, is one of Libya's leading experts in circumventing US
embargo provisions barring the sale of US technology and aircraft
components to Libya.
<P>

     -- Assisting with Libya's effort to co-opt or sponsor Latin
American terrorist groups. Under Al-Megrahi's leadership, the CSS
assisted other Libyan outreach agencies by contributing to propaganda
campaigns, collecting intelligence on the attitudes of radical groups,
and assessing the intelligence or operational utility of Arabs who
resided in target countries.
<P>

     -- Setting up travel agencies and other front companies to
facilitate the travel and movement of goods and people, an activity
that we believe supported both the procurement and outreach programs
of the CSS and other Libyan intelligence entities.
<P>
     Senior Libyans who worked closely with Al-Megrahi and other CSS
officials involved in these activities include:
<P>

     -- Col. Rifi Ali Al-Sharif, a senior Libyan military officer with
a prominent role in Libya's procurement effort. Col. Al-Sharif, the
mentor/patron of Badri Hasan, reportedly assisted efforts by
Al-Megrahi and Badri Hasan to illegally acquire US aircraft via Benin
in 1986 and 1987 and sponsored the establishment of a travel agency as
a joint CSS/military procurement enterprise in Eastern Europe.
<P>

     -- Sa'id Rashid, who in 1988 paid and instructed the chemical
weapons precursor procurement specialist working for Al-Megrahi in
Germany.
<P>     
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H5>Al-Megrahi's Terrorist Record</H5>
<BR>

     Al-Megrahi's position and contacts in the Libyan intelligence
apparatus place him firmly in the camp of his first cousin Sa'id
Rashid--a leading architect and implementer of Libya's terrorist
policies and a powerful member of the Libyan Government's inner
circle. For at least two years before his early 1987 appointment as
CSS director, Al-Megrahi was ESO chief of airline security, reporting
directly to Rashid, who was ESO chief of operations throughout 1986.
<P>

     Al-Megrahi continued his terrorist activities after becoming CSS
director in early 1987. During 1988, Al-Megrahi:
<P>

     -- Met in Malta with a team of Libyan intelligence operatives
planning to travel to Chad to conduct an unspecified operation.
Abdallah Sanussi--newly appointed chief of ESO operations--ordered the
team to abort the operation when it was unable to make appropriate
airline connections. Sanussi is one of four Libyans whom France
indicted on 30 October 1991 for the September 1989 bombing of UTA 772,
which exploded after leaving Ndjamena airport in Chad.
<P>

     -- Met with Greek arms dealers and expressed interest in
acquiring 1,000 letter bombs and associated technical equipment.
<P>

<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
     
<H5>Sa'id Rashid and Libyan Terrorist Operations</H5>
<BR>

     Sa'id Rashid has managed a sustained Libyan effort to conduct
terrorist attacks against US interests since the early 1980s. Rashid
has long enjoyed privileged access to the top levels of the Libyan
Government and is involved in a wide range of intelligence activities.
He is a senior member of the Revolutionary Committees Bureau, which
oversees the execution of the Libyan Government's radical policies in
Libya and abroad.
<P>

     Rashid rose rapidly in the ESO and in Libya's revolutionary
committee apparatus during the early and mid-1980s, while aggressively
pursuing the Libyan Government's dissident assassination programs and
the terrorist and subversive aspects of the government's African
policies.
<P>

     An Italian court has sentenced Rashid in absentia to life
imprisonment for his leadership of a team that assassinated a Libyan
exile in a Milan train station in July 1980. This assassination was
one of many in an antidissident campaign that spanned Western Europe
and was directed by Rashid through at least 1985:
<P>

     -- In October 1980, Rashid led a team to Togo that planned to
assassinate Chadian President Hissan Habre.
<P>

     -- In 1983, Libya illegally detained 37 French citizens in a
successful effort to force France to release Rashid, who had been
jailed in Paris pending extradition to Italy on murder changes related
to the 1980 assassination in Milan.
<P>

     Rashid began to direct attacks specifically against US interests
in late 1981, when he assumed overall operational responsibility for
Libya's effort to overthrow the Sudanese regime of President Ja'far
Numeiri, then a close ally of the United States. During this period,
Rashid and his subordinates trained, equipped, and directed Sudanese
terrorists who attempted to bomb US interests on several occasions
using concealed bombs equipped with decade timers and containing
Semtex-H. Decade timers were a signature item of Libyan and
Libyan-sponsored terrorists during the early 1980s.
<P>

     One such bomb, concealed in a cigarette carton, was used in a
failed attempt to bomb a Pan Am flight in December 1983. The terrorist
attempted to check an unaccompanied bag onto an Alitalia flight
departing Istanbul for Rome. The bag, which was discovered by Turkish
authorities as a result of heightened security procedures, was tagged
in such a way that it would have connected with a Pan Am flight
departing Rome for New York, thus following essentially the same
procedure that succeeded in the case of Pan Am 103.
<P>

     Rashid continued to play a key role in Libyan targeting of US
interests after tensions mounted between the two countries in
mid-1985:
<P>

     -- Rashid's operatives began planning an attack on US facilities
in Turkey in early 1986, culminating in a failed attempt to bomb the
US Officers Club in Ankara in late April 1986. The Libyan intelligence
officer who directed the operation within Turkey was operating under
cover as an LAA official.
<P>

     -- Rashid tasked several Palestinians to target US facilities in
Germany and directed the April 1986 bombing of the La Belle disco in
Berlin. The La Belle bomb, specifically intended to kill American
service personnel and their dependents, killed three people--two of
them Americans.
<P>

     -- The day after the La Belle disco bombing, Rashid traveled to
Khartoum, where he continued his work with Sudanese oppositionists.
Rashid was in Khartoum on 15 April 1986 when a US Embassy official was
seriously wounded in retaliation for the US bombing of Libya earlier
the same day.
<P>

     -- Rashid was one of the Libyan engineers who provided design
specifications to the Swiss firm MEBO which manufactured the timer
used in the Pan Am 103 bomb. He also demonstrated a MEBO remotely
activated briefcase bomb to Palestinian recruits.
<P>

     -- Both the Libyans arrested in Senegal with the MEBO timer had
been Rashid's subordinates since the early 1980s.
<P>

     In early 1987, the Libyan Government moved Rashid from the ESO to
the directorship of the Libyan Electronics Company, which is heavily
involved in technology transfer and other procurement activities. At
the same time the Libyan Government placed Al-Megrahi in charge of the
Center for Strategic Studies. We believe that the two cousins
continued to coordinate their activities as they became more deeply
involved in procurement programs--as in their joint supervision of
Al-Megrahi's chemical weapons procurement specialist in Germany.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
  
<H5>  Al-Megrahi's Other Supervisors</H5>
<BR>

     Al-Megrahi, as CSS director, reported, or can be linked directly,
to the following prominent Libyans:
<P>

     -- ESO director Ibrahim al-Bishari used Al-Megrahi's office at
MEBO, in Zurich, as an accommodation address and claimed that
Al-Megrahi worked directly under him as director of the CSS.
Al-Bishari is currently Libya's Foreign Minister and reportedly
retains his intelligence portfolio.
<P>

     -- In fall 1988, Abdallah al-Sanussi was Al-Megrahi's immediate
ESO supervisor. Al-Megrahi was a terrorist who worked at the CSS for
Sanussi. Al-Sanussi is one of the Libyan Government's chief
intelligence aides. He authorized, directed, and provided funding for
a number of Libyan terrorist operations over the years. French
judicial authorities have lodged criminal charges against al-Sanussi
for the September 1989 bombing of UTA 772.
<P>

     -- Nasir Ali Ashur has been linked both to Al-Megrahi and to the
MEBO timers. Ashur, who oversaw earlier tests of the timers to ensure
they would be completely destroyed by an explosion, was seen at a
meeting at Al-Megrahi's house two days before the Pan Am 103 bombing.
Maltese embarkation records and a US intelligence source also show
that Ashur and Al-Megrahi met in Malta in early October 1988 and that
the two traveled together from Zurich to Malta in August 1987. Ashur
has been declared by the French to be the equivalent of an unindicted
coconspirator for his management of Libya's policies of providing
massive amounts of arms--including tons of Semtex-H--to the
Provisional Irish Republican Army.
<P>

     -- Abdallah Mahmud Hijazi is probably also a key contact of
Al-Megrahi, although we lack concrete evidence of direct linkage.
Hijazi, Rashid's longtime patron, was until 1986 the director of
Libya's Department of Military Procurement. In 1988, he was reportedly
a key organizer of Libyan subversive operations in West Africa and
Chad.
<P>

     -- Ibrahim Nayili, whom the French indicted on 30 October 1991
for his role in the bombing of UTA 772, has been identified by several
sources as the ESO official in Athens who placed potential sources of
arms and aircraft components in contact with Al-Megrahi. Al-Nayili
became ESO chief of airline security in mid-1989--the same position
that Al-Megrahi held before becoming CSS director.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>

    
<H5> The Historical Context</H5>
<BR>

     The foregoing has described Libya's links to Pan Am 103, the
individuals involved, and the central role those individuals play in
the terrorist and intelligence programs of the Libyan Government. The
terrorist case against the government does not begin or end with the
destruction of Pan Am 103. We have seen a consistent pattern of
Libyan-inspired terrorism that continues after the Pan Am 103 atrocity
to the present. This pattern seriously undermines any argument that
Pan Am 103 was a rogue operation that did not meet with the approval
of Libya's most senior authorities. An operation this important could
not have been undertaken without the consent of the highest levels of
the Libyan Government.

<TITLE>Local Terrorism Planning Model</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->

<H3>Local Terrorism Planning Model</H3>
<P>


For most law enforcement agency administrators in the United States, the perceived threat of a terrorist act or attack within their jurisdiction is a remote possibility.  Unfortunately, one cannot predict, with any degree of confidence, when and where terrorism is likely to occur.  Being prepared for any eventuality is a hallmark of good administration, but preparation should be consistent, at least to some degree, with the probability of an event and available resources.  It must also be measured against the potential impact that such an event might have.
<P>

A terrorist act usually has a low probability of occurrence but a high impact when it does, as we have witnessed in the World Trade Center bombing in New York City, the murder of an ad exec in Caldwell, New Jersey, the recent Oklahoma City bombing and tragedy and those acts of terrorism, violence and death perpetrated by the infamous and elusive "Unabomber".  Thus, it requires some serious consideration and effective and joint planning in any law enforcement, criminal justice or public safety agency or respective emergency management program serving the security and safety needs of citizens.
<P> 

Jurisdiction for the investigation of domestic terrorist acts rests primarily with federal agencies, but the local law enforcement agency or the established emergency management team also has an all-important and vital role when their local setting becomes the target and the primary theater of operations. Recent history has proven that that this action is necessary.
<P>

It is because of the immediate municipal, county and state role that  
a ready-reference for countering terrorism is readily available, specifically for all law enforcement and related emergency management, civil defense and security administrators, to provide a planning framework, identify specific needs, identify areas of threat and responsibility, and to provide a source of vital and proven-effective reference materials and information.
<P> 

It is imperative that a model of this type  be acquired and immediately implemented by each and every law enforcement agency in America, regardless of size or location, before the next internal threat, scare or resulting tragedy. The proper and highly recommended program model on countering terrorism, for early municipal, borough, hamlet, village, county and state law enforcement agency preparation and intervention, consists of eight vital parts, focusing primarily on Planning, Operations, Tactics, External Considerations, Events, Acts, The Actors and Training.
<P> 

Included are vital materials, far exceeding present emergency management procedures, that can easily be effectively duplicated to assist in planning activities and to distribute in an operational setting.  Some of the procedures can be used the way they are, while others should be adapted to the particular jurisdiction.
<P>

The importance of preparation for a potential threat will be dictated by the respective chief executive of a city, county, state or respective jurisdiction.  An alarmist approach is of little value, but to ignore or belittle the threat can prove to be disastrous.  A reasoned and balanced approach, emphasizing a departmental plan, offers a sensible model, because, 'it can happen here!'  Recent events and historical warnings have proven this year after year.  The warning signs are all around, yet, too many, in positions of authority, often because of denial, fail to recognize them.
<P>

This vital model for law enforcement to aid in countering terrorism represents the first step for the development of  a truly effective plan. Although most of the preliminary work and research has been accomplished, the rest depends on the respective chief agency executive and the delegated professional joint planning groups.
<P>

Hopefully, there will never be a need for you and your jurisdiction to use this specialized model or put the plan into effect,  even in the aftermath of the World Trade Center bombing disaster and the recent bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal building, and countless other, however, should an incident occur, the vital realization that there is a working plan that may and will aid in saving the lives of those served by law enforcement, public safety, emergency management, corporate security or related community-related administrations, "is just that important!"

<H2>STREET GANGS COME TO A QUIET CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOOD...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Managing Editor
<P>

Chicago's Clearing neighborhood is located on the far Southwest 
Side just west of Midway Airport in the 8th Police District.  For 
a very long time, it has been considered one of the better parts
of the nation's third largest city.  The area is heavily populated
by police officers, firefighters and other city workers.  Other
than the noise generated by planes at the airport, Clearing has
always been described as quiet.
<P>
But about 20 months ago, some residents of Clearing began to see
and hear signs of some type of change.  Gang graffiti started
showing up in alleys and on the walls of stores.  There was a rash
of residential burglaries.  Teenagers hanging out on West 63rd Street,
yelling at people in cars and flashing gang signs.  A boy was
beaten with a crowbar because he refused to join a gang. 
All signs of a change in the area.
<P>
Not unusual, many residents reportedly denied that there was any 
kind of a gang problem in their area.  They denied it up until early
December 1995 when two 13-year-old girls were shot and killed as
they sat in van outside of their school.  That shooting woke up
the residents of the community.
<P>
Street gangs can now show up any where.  From the poorest neighborhoods
to some of the better suburban towns.  Gang specialists estimate that
there are more than 50 street gangs operating in the Cook County
suburbs.  Communities such as Aurora, Elgin, Evanston, Schaumburg,
and Mount Prospect have gangs operating in their towns.
<P>
When most people think about street gangs, they picture black
and/or Hispanic youths.  But there white street gang members.
In fact, the first street gangs in Chicago were white.  Mostly
found in the Irish communities at the turn of the century.  And 
the white gangs battle for turf -- just as the double murder in 
Clearing in December indicates -- just like the black and Hispanic 
gangs.  The results from these turf battles can be just as deadly 
in Clearing as they are in the Logan Square area.
<P>
Irving Spergel is a sociologist at the University of Chicago.  He
has been studying street gangs for about 40 years.  Spergel said,
"All communities are at risk.  Gangs in some ways reflect the
tensions and pressures of people in the neighborhood.  The Southwest
Side is changing faster than the other sections of the city, with
new populations coming in.  Gangs don't move.  Families with gang
kids move."
<P>
That is why the Chicago street gang known as the Insane Popes is
starting to anchor itself in the Clearing area.  The criminal
activities of the Popes has grown as Latino gang members moved into
the area.
<P>
The main rivals of the Popes are the Two-Sixers, located mostly
in the 10th Police District and in the west suburban town of
Cicero.  The Two-Sixers are a mixed gang of Mexicans and whites and
are one the oldest, largest and most violent of the Hispanic
street gangs in Chicago.
<P>
Spergel said that gangs in white, middle-class neighborhoods may
organize and operate differently from gangs in poor, minority
areas.  However, it does seem that the same kinds of kids are
attracted to gangs for the same kinds of reasons, regardless of
skin color and economic background.  "They're all motivated by
the same things, although the level of crime varies with each
gang," Spergel said.  "These kids have a lot of personal problems.
The gang is a way they can take it out on society or on each other."
<P>
So, how can the parents of one of Chicago's finer neighborhoods
stop this encroaching problem?  The first thing they must do, and
experts agree that this is the hardest part, they must acknowledge
that there is a gang problem in their area to begin with and they
must find out if their children have any involvement with street
gangs.  A difficult, but necessary, task.

<p><font size=5><strong>GANGBANGERS INVADE CYBERSPACE</strong></font> <br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
Chicago, IL (ENN) -- As if law enforcement officers didn't already have enough to worry about, there is now a new 
hangout in cyberspace. It's for street gang members and gangbanger wannabes. Just what was needed -- a place for gang 
members to exchange ideas on how to improve drug sales, what's the best gun to use to shoot your business rivals and 
what's the best drugs to use in your spare time?<br>
<br>
All of that and even more can be found on the Glock3 Web site. This site is said to link members of street gangs from 
around the world, from 'Lil Shorty's Click in London to the Gangster Disciples in Chicago to the West Side Crips in 
Phoenix. Experts say that the site provides a virtual how-to-be a street gang member.<br>
<br>
The site was said to be created in early January by gangbangers in Detroit. In the first three months, it recorded about 
9,000 hits -- which is pretty respectable. After its internet service provider saw what was going on -- Glock3 was deleted 
from the service. In April, the enterprising gang members found a new internet provider ... in New Zealand.<br>
<br>
The Auckland internet provider has received complaints about the Web site, but the company feels its powerless to do 
anything about it. The operations manager for the provider said, &quot;We have no legal right to censor the content. We don't 
have the authority. The legislation hasn't caught up with the internet.&quot;<br>
<br>
An example of the type of individual that visits the Web site is a gang member who calls herself, &quot;GDLookin'&quot; She talks 
about her favorite music groups, partying in Mexico and smoking &quot;out&quot; on the Glock3 &quot;phat linkz&quot; page. She must be a real 
charmer. Other members have bragged about serving time for such offenses as: carjacking, carrying a concealed weapon, 
auto theft, assault and arson.<br>
<br>
Sergeant Mark Clark of the Scottsdale, Arizona, Police Department says that he is more concerned about Web sites 
showing how to make bombs then how to act and dress like a gangbanger.<br>
<br>
The Scottsdale Police Department has established its own Web site that is dedicated to fighting gangs. The new site offers 
gang statistics, phone numbers and tips for parents on keeping their kids out of gangs. Any questions can be directed to 
Sergeant Clark at his e-mail address of: spdganggood@net.com<br>
<br>
As a reminder, the Emergency Response and Research Institute's EMERGENCY BBS has a large library on information 
about Chicago street gangs. You can reach the EMERGENCY BBS at the number given at the end of the ENN DAILY 
REPORT or if you don't want to pay long distance fees -- you can reach the BBS through telnet from anywhere in the 
world.<br>
<br>
Clark said that there are not a large number of street gang members in Scottsdale. &quot;Half the gang population of Arizona 
lives in Phoenix,&quot; he said. &quot;And we're a part of the Phoenix metropolitan area.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the United States, there are at least 25,000 street gangs with an estimated membership of about 650,000 people. 
Gangbangers in the Southwest portion of the U.S. are said to be less organized than those on the East Coast, said Jim 
Ledy, a criminal-intelligence analyst for the Arizona Department of Public Safety.<br>
<br>
Captain David Gonzales, who heads up the Arizona DPS gang task force, said about gangs on the internet, &quot;Now it's in 
your home, your living room, your den. Street gangs are moving toward more of an organized crime stature.&quot; (Editor's 
Note: the captain needs to come to Chicago and see how organized they are.)<br>
<br>
Gonzales, who has been tracking gangbangers for almost ten years, added, &quot;Unfortunately, these guys can talk about 
anything they want and there's nothing law enforcement can do about it. It establishes a worldwide connection to gangs 
everywhere.&quot;<br>

<B>**LEAD STORY**</B>
<H2>THE ARYAN REPUBLICAN ARMY...</H2>
By Steve Macko
<P>

In 1984, Robert Jay Matthews died in a shootout with police on
Whidby Island, which is located just off the coast of Washington
state.  Matthews was the leader of a far-Right wing group calling
itself The Order.  This group was responsible for a number of
bank and armored car robberies in the Pacific Northwest.  The 
group ended with the death of Matthews and the imprisonment of 
other members.
<P>

The Order was able to acquire almost $4 million in its wave of
robberies.  The group also ran a large counterfeiting operation.
This group was not made up of petty criminals.  They had an
ideology and they were funding a revolution that would hopefully
lead to the creation of a white supremacist nation somewhere in
the Northwest.
<P>

The Order wasn't only funding their own group or revolution.
They were also funding other groups that shared the same dream.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars were distributed to other white
supremacist and anti-Semitic groups in the United States.
<P>

Armed robbery to fund revolutionary activity is nothing new.
Groups from both the far-Right and the far-Left have done it
in the past.  Between 1976 and 1985, more than 20 bank and
armored car robberies were pulled off on the East Coast by a 
group calling itself Democratic Society.
<P>

Brent Smith is sociologist and the author of a book, entitled,
"Terrorism In America: Pipe Bombs and Pipe Dreams."  Smith said,
"There aren't very many ways you can fund a revolution.  You can
either find external support, such as a foreign government, which
is not an easy thing to do.  Or some kind of criminality, like
bank robberies, armored-truck robberies.  Some have even explored
drug trafficking."
<P>

Tom Richardson, the Assistant-Special-Agent-In-Charge of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation's Omaha, Nebraska, field office,
an office that has been involved in investigating bank robberies
committed by white supremacist groups, said, "With those kinds
of resources out there, other people may try do the same thing,
whether as part of a group or individually."
<P>

Serial bank robberies committed by would-be revolutionary groups
have been identified by the FBI, though not officially, as "waves."
The first wave is normally identified with Robert Jay Matthews and
his Order.  The second wave was the robberies committed by Richard
Lee Guthrie and Peter Kevin Langan, whose case we will explore in
a few moments.  But it appears that there may be a third wave on the
horizon.
<P>

A few weeks ago, a bank in Spokane, Washington, was robbed of
somewhere between $50,000 and $70,000.  This robbery had all
of the earmarks of a bank robbery committed by a group with
an ideology, specifically the white supremacist far-Right.
<P>

Before Langan and Guthrie were apprehended in January of this
year, they were know to law enforcement officials as The Midwest 
Bank Robbers.  This was because for a number of years, this
pair had robbed a large number of banks throughout the Midwest
portion of the United States.  They were well known for taunting
the FBI.  What wasn't known until they were caught was that they
said they were members of the Aryan Republican Army.
<P>

Guthrie, specifically, has been speaking to journalists about
what he thought about the Spokane robbery.  In Spokane, two
subjects dressed partially in military fatigues, left a note
saying they were members of a previous unknown group calling
itself the Phineas Priesthood.  That name was supposedly awarded
to the Aryan enforcers of racial purity.
<P>

So, with good reason, the FBI is investigating the robbery as
being committed by a far-Right group.  They also realize that
this just may be an attempt to throw them off the track of just
ordinary criminals.
<P>

FBI spokesman, Larry Holmquist of the Omaha field office, who
was made famous because Guthrie and Langan poked fun at him
through their written taunts to various newspapers, said,
"There are a lot of bank robberies every day in this country
and robbers can say whatever they want to about political
ideologies."
<P>

When Guthrie and Langan were on their bank robbing spree, it
is estimated that they stole more than $250,000.  None of
the money has been recovered and the FBI is investigating
whether or not the two helped fund white supremacist groups.
<P>

37-year-old Langan was arrested in January after a shootout
with police in Columbus, Ohio.  Guthrie, 38, was apprehended 
after a high-speed chase outside of Cincinnati.  The two are 
said to have robbed 18 banks during a two year period.  Banks 
in the states of Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska and
Ohio.  A third man, identified as Bill Thompson, is also
being sought for being involved in the robberies.
<P>

The robberies committed in the Midwest were known to be quick
and executed efficiently.  Guthrie and Langan even had a
sense humor, even though the FBI was not amused.  Around
Christmas time in 1994, one of the robbers wore a Santa Claus
suit during a hold-up in Ohio.  In an April 1995 robbery in
Iowa, they left an Easter basket with a gold painted pipe
bomb in it.  They even wore windbreaker jackets during
robberies with the initials: FBI and ATF on the back.
<P>

Guthrie and Langan never detonated any of the pipe bombs,
or in some cases grenades, that they left behind them.  
However, the Spokane bank robbers did set off a diversionary
bomb at a newspaper office.  The newspaper, the Spokane
Spokesman-Review has been well known to write critically
about white supremacist movements and the far-right.
<P>

After detonating the bomb at the newspaper office, they
robbed a bank located 30 blocks away.  There, they
detonated another bomb in the lobby of the bank.
<P>

Guthrie has said that he does not recognize the term "Phineas
Priesthood."  He said that this new group had nothing to do
with the Aryan Republican Army, which is also unkown to experts
who monitor these types of movements.  Guthrie said that he
believes that the Spokane bandits are probably part of a "cell."
He said, "That was one of the cell groups.  I recognized it.
All the patterns were correct.  If you have ever studied the
IRA you will understand more about ... guerrilla organization.
You will understand what is eventually coming to this country."
<P>

Before the Midwest Bank Robbers were captured, Guthrie or
Langan never indicated that they were part of an Aryan Republican 
Army.  When authorities did search Langan's apartment they did 
find white supremacist and far-Right literature.  Literature was 
also found in two storage lockers located in Kansas and Missouri.
Also found were a number of pipe bombs and video that shows
a masked Langan trying to promote the Aryan Republican Army.
<P>

How many people belong to the Aryan Republican Army is not
known.  But it does appear that the Spokane bandits have used
the methods that was used by the group once known as The Order, 
which in itself, drew upon things that were found in the book,
"The Turner Diaries," which were made famous by Timothy McVeigh,
one of the men accused in the Oklahoma City bombing.  They
have also used methods of the Midwest bank bandits.
<P>

There seems to be a connection.  All authorities have to do
is piece it together.  But even then, it'll be very difficult
to apprehend those involved.  After they're caught, we can
reasonably be assured -- there'll be someone else.

<TITLE>Miranda Rights and Decisions</TITLE>

<P>
<H2>Invoking the Miranda Right to Counsel: The Defendant's Burden</H2>
<P>
By Kimberly A. Crawford, J.D.
<P>
Special Agent Crawford is a legal instructor at the FBI Academy.
<P>

Beginning with the 1966 Supreme Court decision in Miranda v.
Arizona,1 law enforcement has endured three decades of
court-imposed restraints on its ability to engage in custodial
interrogation. The most significant of these restraints curtails
law enforcement's ability to conduct custodial interrogation once
the suspect invokes the right to counsel. The practical result of
Miranda and its progeny is that a custodial suspect's invocation
of the right to counsel effectively precludes any further
government-initiated attempts at interrogation outside the
presence of counsel.2
<P>

Because the invocation of Miranda rights, particularly the right
to counsel, has such an onerous impact on law enforcement's
ability to conduct interrogations, recent court decisions have
begun to impose some limitations on a custodial suspect's ability
to invoke that right.3 Specifically, to ensure that a suspect's
invocation of rights is not frivolous, the courts are requiring
that the Miranda right to counsel be invoked unequivocally and in
a timely manner.
<P>

This article reviews the recent court decisions and assesses
their potential impact on the ability of custodial suspects to
invoke the right to counsel. It then suggests ways in which law
enforcement agencies can incorporate these new guidelines into
their interrogation policies.
<P>
<HR>


<H4>Invocation Must Be Unequivocal</H4>
<P>


In Davis v. United States,4 the Supreme Court recently considered
the degree of clarity necessary for a custodial suspect to invoke
the Miranda right to counsel. The case arose when agents of the
Naval Investigative Service (NIS) interrogated the defendant in
connection with the beating death of a sailor.5 Initially, the
defendant waved his Miranda rights, but approximately 90 minutes
into the interview, he remarked, "Maybe I should talk to a
lawyer." At that point, the interrogation ceased long enough for
the investigating agents to ask the defendant clarifying
questions regarding his desire to consult with an attorney. When
the defendant stated, "No, I don't want a lawyer," the
interrogation continued and resulted in the elicitation of
incriminating statements.
<P>

Prior to his court-martial, the defendant moved to suppress his
statements on the grounds that the remark, "Maybe I should talk
to a lawyer," was an invocation of his right to counsel and that
further attempts by the government to interrogate him outside the
presence of counsel violated his constitutional rights. The
government, on the other hand, argued that the remark in question
was, at best, an equivocal invocation and that the investigators
were justified in asking clarifying questions. The government
contended that once the defendant emphatically stated he did not
want a lawyer, the subsequent interrogation was lawful. Agreeing
with the government, the court denied the motion to suppress, and
the defendant subsequently was convicted of murder.6
<P>

On review, the Supreme Court considered and rejected the
defendant's argument that any mention of a lawyer, however
ambiguous, is sufficient to invoke the right to counsel and that
all further uncounseled interrogation necessarily must cease.
Similarly, the Court declined to adopt the government's position
that an ambiguous request for counsel constitutes an "equivocal
invocation" that requires interrogators to seek clarification
before further interrogation. Instead, the Court took a firmer
stance and held that an equivocal request for a lawyer is
insufficient to invoke the right to counsel and that there is no
need for clarifying questions before proceeding with the
interrogation.
<P>

In reaching its conclusion, the Court stressed the need for a  
"bright line"7 rule that easily could be applied by law
enforcement officers "in the real world of investigation and
interrogation without unduly hampering the gathering of
information."8 To require interrogators to ask clarifying
questions when an ambiguous request for counsel is voiced would
obviate the "bright line" effect the Court was aiming for and
force officers to "make difficult judgment calls about whether
the suspect in fact wants a lawyer even though he hasn't said so,
with the threat of suppression if they guess wrong."9
<P>

The Court's decision in Davis clearly puts the burden on
custodial suspects to make unequivocal invocations of the right
to counsel.10 As a practical matter, however, law enforcement
agencies would be wise to continue a policy of encouraging
interrogators to ask clarifying questions when a suspect in
custody makes an ambiguous request for counsel.

<P>

Although the Court in Davis purported to adopt a bright line rule
that would save interrogators from making "difficult judgment
calls" when requests for counsel are equivocal, interrogators
must still use their judgment in determining whether requests are
equivocal or not. The Court in Davis recognized its bright line
rule did not obviate the need for interrogators to use discretion
and offered the following advice:
<P>

Of course, when a suspect makes an ambiguous or equivocal
statement, it will often be good police practice for the
interviewing officers to clarify whether or not he actually wants
an attorney....Clarifying questions help protect the rights of
the suspect by ensuring that he gets an attorney if he wants one,
and will minimize the chance of a confession being suppressed due
to subsequent judicial second-guessing as to the meaning of the
suspect's statement regarding counsel. But we decline to adopt a
rule requiring officers to ask clarifying questions.11
<P>

State law enforcement agencies have additional incentive for
adopting an interrogation policy that encourages clarifying
questions. Although the Supreme Court has concluded that such
questions are unnecessary under its interpretation of the U.S.
Constitution, State courts are free to construe State
constitutions in a manner that holds their law enforcement
officers to higher standards.12 It is reasonable to expect that
some State courts, when interpreting their own constitutions,
will reject the Supreme Court's bright line rule in Davis and
will adopt the position that an ambiguous invocation of counsel
necessitates the asking of clarifying questions.
<P>

The Supreme Court of Hawaii adopted this position in State v.
Hoey.13 The defendant in Hoey was arrested and charged with
burglary and kidnaping. When advised of his right to counsel and
to have counsel appointed, the defendant stated, "I don't have
the money to buy one." In response, the officer conducting the
interrogation asked the defendant if he thought he needed an
attorney at that time. When the defendant conceded that he did
not, the interrogation continued. The defendant challenged his
subsequent conviction on several grounds, one of them being that
continued interrogation was unlawful in light of his ambiguous
request for counsel.
<P>

Agreeing with the defendant, the Supreme Court of Hawaii reversed
the conviction. In doing so, the court acknowledged that the
defendant's statement to the interrogating officer was an
ambiguous request for counsel that, according to the Supreme
Court in Davis, requires no clarifying questions.
<P>

However, the Supreme Court of Hawaii made a conscious decision to
afford its citizens broader protection under the State
constitution. Accordingly, the court held that an ambiguous or
equivocal request for counsel compels law enforcement officers in
that State to either cease all interrogation or resolve the
ambiguity through clarifying questions.14 Believing that the
defendant's statement regarding his inability to afford an
attorney was indicative of a misunderstanding of the right to
appointed counsel that was not clarified by subsequent
questioning, the court in Hoey concluded that the interrogating
officer violated the defendant's State constitutional rights by
continuing the interrogation.
<P>

Assuming that the court's decision in Hoey is not an aberration,
law enforcement agencies can avoid similar decisions in their own
State courts by adopting interrogation policies that require
clarifying questions. By adopting such policies, agencies can
decrease the likelihood that courts will second guess
interrogators' judgments that invocations were ambiguous and
forestall suppression of confessions based on State courts'
adoption of standards higher than those set by the Supreme Court
in Davis. Moreover, such policies have the added benefit of
ensuring the protection of individuals' constitutional rights.
<P>
<HR>


<H4>Invocations Must Be Timely</H4>
<BR>
In addition to demanding that invocations be unequivocal, courts
also have begun to hold that invocations of the Miranda right to
counsel must be made in a timely manner. The genesis of the
movement to compel timely invocations can be traced to the
Supreme Court's decision in McNeil v. Wisconsin.15
<P>

In McNeil, the Court was confronted with the question of whether
an invocation of the sixth amendment right to counsel encompassed
an invocation of the Miranda right to counsel as well. Holding
that it did not, a majority of the Court concluded that an
invocation of the sixth amendment right to counsel, which is
crime-specific, did not preclude government attempts to conduct
subsequent custodial interrogations on unrelated topics.16
Responding to the dissent's criticism that the    holding could
be circumvented by an explicit invocation of Miranda rights at a
preliminary hearing, the Court made the following            
statement:
<P>

We have in fact never held that a person can invoke his Miranda
rights anticipatorily, in a context other than 'custodial
interrogation'--which a preliminary hearing will not always, or
even usually involve. If the Miranda right to counsel can be
invoked at a preliminary hearing, it could be argued, there is no
logical reason why it could not be invoked by a letter prior to
arrest, or indeed even prior to identification as a suspect. Most
rights must be asserted when the government seeks to take the
action they protect against. The fact that we have allowed the
Miranda right to counsel, once asserted, to be effective with
respect to future custodial interrogation does not necessarily
mean that we will allow it to be asserted initially outside the
context of custodial interrogation, with similar future effect.17
<P>

Although not binding precedent, this statement prompted several
lower courts to conclude that anticipatory invocations of the
Miranda right to counsel are ineffective. For example, in Alston
v. Redman,18 the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit relied on
the language in McNeil to hold that a letter signed by a
custodial defendant purporting to invoke the Miranda right to
counsel had no impact on the government's ability to attempt
subsequent interrogations.
<P>

In Alston, the defendant was arrested on charges of robbery and
conspiracy. Following a voluntary waiver of his Miranda rights,
the defendant was interrogated and  confessed to several
robberies. Three days later, while still in custody, the
defendant met with a representative of the Public Defender's
Office and signed a form letter addressed to the warden of the
facility where he was incarcerated. The letter read as follows:
<P>

<HR>
Dear Sir:
<BR>

          I am presently a detainee in this institution and I
will not speak to any police officer, law enforcement officers,
their agents, or representatives from the Department of Justice,
or any jurisdiction, without a Public Defender being present at
such a meeting.
<P>

          I further do not wish to be removed from my cell and
brought to a meeting with the above-mentioned officers for the
purpose of discussing a waiver of my constitutional rights in
this regard.19
<P>

Despite the letter, the defendant subsequently was interrogated
by law enforcement officers following an advice and waiver of
Miranda rights. The interrogation resulted in a second, more
comprehensive confession, which the defendant later tried
unsuccessfully to suppress.
<P>

In his motion to suppress, the defendant argued that signing the
form letter was sufficient to invoke his Miranda right to counsel
and to "thwart any further police-initiated questioning."20
However, after reviewing the Supreme Court's decision in McNeil
and revisiting the underlying rationale in Miranda, the court
rejected this argument. Recognizing that the design of the rule
in Miranda was to protect individuals from the psychologically
compelling effects of custodial interrogation, the court
determined that the rule served no purpose unless the individual
attempting to invoke it was in custody and being subjected to
interrogation at the time of the invocation. Because the
"interaction of custody and official interrogation"21 was absent,
the court concluded that the defendant's "Miranda right to
counsel had simply not attached when [he] signed the invocation
form in his cell,"22 and therefore, the attempted invocation was
ineffective.
<P>
A similar result was reached by the Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit in United States v. Wright.23 Again relying on the
Supreme Court's decision in McNeil, the court in Wright concluded
that defense counsel's request at a plea hearing to be present
during any future interrogation of her client was insufficient to
invoke the defendant's Miranda right to counsel. Rather, the
court concluded that defense counsel's statement served only to
invoke the sixth amendment right to counsel, which is
crime-specific, and precluded only subsequent interrogation
regarding the crime charged.24 Government-initiated interrogation
pertaining to uncharged offenses, which was at issue in this
case, was not affected by counsel's attempted invocation.
<P>

Although not unanimous,25 an ever-increasing number of courts are 
following the Supreme Court's recommendation in McNeil and
holding that anticipatory invocations of Miranda rights are
ineffective.26 Law enforcement agencies that incorporate the
prohibition against anticipatory invocations into their
interrogation policies realize a distinct advantage. Such
policies permit investigators to attempt uncounseled
government-initiated interrogations in situations where custodial
suspects have made untimely requests for counsel. Thus, suspects'
enraged demands for counsel that precede or follow closely on the
heels of custody will not preclude later interrogation attempts
when tempers subside.
<P>

When formulating such interrogation policies, however, law
enforcement agencies should consider one caveat: Invocations of
the right to counsel are not likely to be deemed anticipatory if
preceded by advice of rights. Although not widely litigated, at
least one court has held that once custodial suspects are advised
of their Miranda rights, subsequent requests for counsel are
timely whether they coincide with attempted interrogations or
not.27 Therefore, agencies that want to take advantage of the
courts' repudiation of anticipatory invocations should ensure
that suspects are not advised of their Miranda rights
precipitously.
<P>
<HR> 
<H4>Conclusion</H4>
<BR>
After years of allowing custodial suspects to avoid police
interrogation by invoking their Miranda rights, courts have begun
to impose some reasonable restraints on when and how those rights
must be invoked. To take full advantage of this new trend, law
enforcement agencies must craft their interrogation policies
carefully to incorporate these restrictions.
<P>
<HR>

When formulating an interrogation policy, consideration should be
given to the following provisions:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>1) Miranda warnings should not be given until the suspect is in
custody and interrogation imminent

<LI>2) When a suspect makes an ambiguous request for counsel
following an advice of rights, interrogators should attempt to
resolve the ambiguity by asking clarifying questions
<LI>3) Attempts by suspects to invoke the Miranda right to counsel
prior to an advice of rights should not preclude officers from
proceeding with an advice of rights and attempting to obtain a
waiver
<LI>4) Attempts by defense counsel to invoke anticipatorily the
clients' Miranda right to counsel are ineffective.
</UL>
<P>

A well-crafted interrogation policy, if followed, will serve the
dual purpose of securing the admissibility of suspects'  
statements and protecting individuals' constitutional rights. As
with the formulation of any policy, a competent legal advisor
should be consulted to ensure compliance with relevant legal
principles.

<TITLE>Use of Force-Pepper Spray</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->

<BODY>

<P>


<H5>Focus on Use of Force</H5>
<BR>
<H4>Pepper Spray</H4>
<P>
By John C. Hunter
<P>
Chief Deputy Hunter serves with the Skagit County, Washington,
Sheriff's Office.
<P>

   A deputy sheriff responds to a reported domestic dispute in a
rural area of the county. Backup officers are 20 minutes behind
when the deputy passes one of the subjects speeding in the opposite
direction. After a short pursuit, the subject stops his vehicle and
flees on foot. The deputy confronts the man, and a physical
struggle ensues. Although not assaultive, the subject escapes when
the deputy cannot effectively control him.
<P>

In another part of the country, officers take part in a
multivehicle pursuit as a suspect attempts to avoid apprehension.
The suspect eventually stops his vehicle, but refuses to comply
with the officers' verbal commands to lie face down. After attempts
of physical restraint fail, officers resort to tasers and repeated
baton blows. A bystander captures on video what appears to be the
officers' flagrant disregard for the citizen's safety.
<P>

Meanwhile, officers from another department transport a mental
patient from a detention facility to the hospital. Because the
subject will not sit calmly in the backseat of the patrol vehicle,
the officers hogtie him. When they arrive at the hospital after a
5-minute drive, the officers find the subject dead in the back
seat. A subsequent coroner's report lists the cause of death as
positional asphyxia.1
<P>

These incidents reveal a paradox in modern policing. For the most
part, the officers acted in accordance with their departments'
training procedures. However, each of these encounters ultimately
produced results unacceptable both to their departments and to the
communities they serve. In fact, each of these scenarios reflects
a missing link that exists in the use-of-force continuum currently
recognized and accepted by law enforcement.
<P>

What makes scenarios such as these especially frustrating is that
they could be resolved without placing either the subjects or the
officers in jeopardy. Advances in nonlethal neutralizing
agents--most notably oleoresin capsicum, or "pepper spray"--give
today's law enforcement officers a means to control subjects
without resorting to a physical confrontation or to the deadly
force level of the force continuum.
<P>

Although an increasing number of departments equip their officers
with pepper spray, other agencies have been slow to embrace this
alternative to more conventional methods of subject control.
Considering the many challenges facing modern law enforcement
officers, agency administrators should consider the potential
advantages of expanding the use-of-force continuum to include
pepper spray.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR> 
<H5>EXPANDING THE USE-OF-FORCE CONTINUUM</H5>
<BR>
As taught by most law enforcement academies, the use-of-force
continuum consists of five levels, with each tier representing an
escalation in force from the preceding level. The principles of the
continuum and safety considerations, as well as officer and
department liability factors, reinforce the importance of
approaching each situation on the lowest level possible to achieve
the desired results. The escalation-in-force continuum model
generally recognized in departments across the Nation is as
follows:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>1) Physical presence
<LI>2) Verbalization
<LI>3) Physical contact
<LI>4) Hand-held impact weapons
<LI>5) Lethal force.
</UL>
<P>
While this model adequately reflects the methods available to
police departments in past years, it does not accommodate the
expanded arsenal of neutralizing agents available to today's law
enforcement officers. Therefore, administrators and trainers should
consider modifying the continuum to encompass these measures.
<P>

The new use-of-force continuum should include two additional levels
and appear as such:
<P>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>1) Physical presence
<LI>2) Verbalization
<LI>3) Less than physical force (neutralizing agents)
<LI>4) Physical contact
<LI>5) Less than physical force (neutralizing agents)
<LI>6) Hand-held impact weapons
<LI>7) Lethal force.
</UL>
<P>
<BR>
As reflected in this new model, neutralizing agents, such as pepper
spray, can give officers an added degree of flexibility at two
critical points in the force continuum--before they make any
physical contact with subjects or after initial physical          
contact but before the introduction of hand-held weapons.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H4>PEPPER SPRAY</H4>
<BR>
A Tool to Augment the Force Continuum
<BR>

Once administrators decide to expand the use-of-force continuum,
they must then determine the most appropriate technology or device
to fill the gaps. Pepper spray is gaining endorsement throughout
law enforcement for its versatility and effectiveness.
<P>

The spray is an organically based inflammatory agent derived from
the essence of cayenne peppers. Its ingredients are generally 90 to
95 percent inert, making it safe for use at very close range.
<P>
<BR>
<H5>Effects</H5>
<BR>
Pepper spray results in considerable tearing of the eyes, as well
as temporary paralysis of the larynx, which causes subjects to lose
their breath. Contact with the face causes a strong burning       
sensation.
<P>

After being exposed to the spray, subjects' reactions become
reflexive in nature. They immediately cover their eyes and bend
over into a defensive posture to avoid further contact. This
reactive behavior allows officers to gain control and restrain
disorderly subjects more effectively. The effects of the spray
generally last about 20 to 45 minutes and leave no residual
effects.
<P>

One advantage of pepper spray is that it can be applied to
handcuffed, resistant, and violent persons during transport, in
lieu of the hogtying method. Contamination of vehicles is minimal.
Generally, vehicles can be operated within a few minutes after the
spray has been used. After use, no decontamination procedures are
required other than normal cleaning of the vehicle's interior.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H5>Other Considerations</H5>
<BR>
Because individual protective devices are widely used by citizens,
neutralizing agents such as pepper spray appear to be viewed by the
public as an acceptable means of force. Pepper spray is available
in most areas of the country in strengths ranging from .5 percent
(dog repellant) to 10 percent (bear repellant). Most personal
protective versions of the spray are in the 1-percent strength
range.2 Sales of the spray in the 5-percent range are restricted to
law enforcement.
<P>

Like any weapon, pepper spray should not be assumed to be
risk-free. At least one death has been attributed to the
application of pepper spray. Although pre-existing medical
conditions may have contributed to the subject's death, the
coroner's report cites pepper spray as a significant factor.3
<P>

Still, compared to using batons and tasers in marginal use-of-force
scenarios, pepper spray generally represents a more acceptable
level of force. In fact, because the spray forces subjects to
assume a prone position without officers resorting to physical
contact, departments that train their personnel in the proper use
of pepper spray can significantly limit their vulnerability to
lawsuits.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<H5>Affordable Training and Deployment</H5>
<BR>
Another aspect of pepper spray that makes it attractive is its
affordability. At an initial cost of $10 to $25 per canister and 4
to 8 hours of inservice training per officer, implementation is
practical for most departments.
<P>

The low probability of civil liability rests with the effectiveness
of officer training procedures. An important element of this
training includes exposing officers to the effects of pepper spray.
<P>

This accomplishes two important goals. The first addresses
officers' ability to react if exposed during an actual field
situation. Officers should be aware of the physical reactions to
the agent. The second goal involves developing a history of the
product's reliability and safety. Courts may be more willing to
side with law enforcement officers who have themselves been exposed
to the spray and survived with minimal short-term discomfort.
<P>

Among other considerations, training should also stress that
officers move away quickly after spraying a subject. This is to
ensure that the subject does not grab the officer when reacting to
the spray.
<P>

After the initial instruction, agencies should conduct yearly
inservice training. However, this training can be reduced to an
informal update at little or no cost to the agency.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H4>CONCLUSION</H4>
<BR>
Today's law enforcement officers act according to a use-of-force
continuum designed many years ago. Pepper spray allows for the
expansion of this continuum and gives officers a needed degree of
flexibility to confront noncooperative subjects. Administrators owe
it to their personnel and to their communities to explore this new
and effective option.

1 Although the hogtying technique is allowed by many law
enforcement agencies as a way to restrain noncooperative subjects
after arrest, this practice recently came under scrutiny due to the
death of several suspects who had been restrained in this manner.
A study of three such deaths determined that each resulted from
positional asphyxia. This phenomenon occurs when the position of
the body interferes with respiration, resulting in asphyxiation.

Enforcement Transport," The American Journal of Forensic Medicine
and Pathology, 13 (2), 1992, 94.

community, it still remains illegal in certain areas of the
country. Police administrators should consult with their legal
advisors before employing this neutralizing agent.

<H3>TERRORIST BOMB ATTACK IN SAUDI ARABIA...</H3>
<P>
<BR>
By Steve Macko 
    & Clark Staten
<P>

Two explosions, one of which was said to be a car bomb, exploded at
a Saudi Arabian National Guard training facility in the middle of
the Saudi capital of Riyadh on Monday morning.  Six people, including
five Americans were killed and 60 people, 34 of whom were also 
Americans, were injured.  Four of the dead victims were reported to 
be civilians employed by the U.S. Department of Defense and the other
two victims were military officers.  Three of the injured victims were
reported to be in critical condition.  The United States reportedly 
leases space at the facility.
<P>

Two previously unknown groups claimed responsibility for the terrorist 
attack that occurred at about 11:30 a.m.(0330 EST, 0830 GMT).  However, 
Saudi authorities are saying that they had received warnings of an 
impending attack.  A phone call was made to an international news 
agency after the blast.  The caller identified himself as being with a
previous unknown group called the "Tigers of the Gulf."  The caller
said that they were responsibile for the car bombing and "If the
Americans don't leave the Kingdom as soon as possible we will continue
our actions."  It was also reported that another unknown group is
claiming to be responsible for the bombing.
<P>

A spokesperson at the United States Embassy in Riyadh said, 
"I am told the explosion was massive and the damage was considerable."  
The U.S. Embassy also said that they understand that the bomb exploded 
in a parking lot at the facility.  30 vehicles were reportedly destroyed 
or burned in the blast.
<P>

After the explosion, there was an ensuing fire in the three-story
building that was the apparent target.  A spokesman for the the
United States Defense Department in Washington said that the 
Pentagon's National Military Command Center had received a preliminary
report indicating that there had been two explosions, an initial large
one and a secondary smaller one, about five minutes apart.  Even
though it is known that terrorists will leave a second explosive
device after an initial bomb blast so that rescuers will be wounded --
the second blast, in this instance, may have been caused by the gas tank 
of one of the vehicles exploding in the ensuing fire.  But this has not
been confirmed by authorities.
<P>

Saudi Arabian authorities said that the explosion was a deliberate
act of terrorism and the Saudi government was confident of "arresting
those who carried out this crime."
<P>

President Clinton reacted strongly to the attack on Monday morning.
The President said, "We have already begun the process of determining
what happened and who, if anyone, was responsible.  We will devote an
enormous effort to that."  Clinton also said, "We it to them and to all
of our citizens to increase our efforts to deter terrorism, to make
sure that those responsible for this hideous act are brought to justice,
to intensify and pressure the isolation of countries that support
terrorism ... and we must spare no effort to make sure our own law
enforcement officers have what they need to protect our citizens."
<P>

A special team from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, headed by
a supervisor from the bureau's National Security division is being
sent to Saudia Arabia to assist in the investigation.  A dozen Special
Agents from the FBI that includes evidence specialists and two bomb
specialists from the FBI laboratory are being sent.  Included in the
special team are two language specialists and an evidence response team
from the Boston office whose job it will be to gather and catlogue
evidence.

<H3>Streetgangs Escalate Violence; Latest Weapons</H3>
<P>
          By Paul Anderson, Metro Correspondent
<P>
Chicago, IL, October 22, 1994 -- As if multiple hits by a 7.62mm AK-47
or high-capacity 9mm handgun aren't enough to worry about,
emergency responders in several cities are being warned of a
serious escalation in violence being perpetrated by streetgang
members.  Several recent incidents have warned of new and more
dangerous hazards on the streets of America.
<P>

    According to Clark Staten, Executive Director of the
Chicago-based Emergency Response & Research Institute, the
escalation is marked by the introduction of modern and fearsome
weapons that have only been used by professional terrorists and
the military in the past.  The first tactic that is reportedly
being used by streetgangs in Chicago, St. Louis, and elsewhere,
is the use of "Molotov Cocktails", or fire bombs, as a weapon of
revenge.
<P>  

Staten said that at least two instances can be documented in the
Chicago area in recent weeks, and that a similar incident
occurred on the Southside of St. Louis last Thursday.  One
incident, in Chicago, took the life of a innocent 4-year-old
boy, when a firebomb was thrown through the window at 743 W.
103rd on Chicago's far Southside.  Eleven (11) other children
and five (5) adults barely escaped the flames generated by the
molotov cocktail.  The suspect, a reputed streetgang member,
remains at large.
<P>

Other unconfirmed reports of gang-related firebombings have been
received from both New York and Los Angeles, and ENN is
currently gathering additional information to further
corroborate this devastating phenomena.  In each case, flaming
gasoline bottles have been thrown through windows, in the
residences of rival gang members or enemies of the gang involved.
<P>

  A second set of circumstances is more troublesome than the use
of "firebombs", Staten said in an interview on Saturday.  It
involves the use of M72A2 LAW Anti-tank rockets against police
stations. According to the Chicago Police Department, five
streetgang members have been arrested, when they attempted to
purchase the sophisticated military hardware from a federal
undercover agent.  The gang members were also charged with
conspiracy to blow up an area-wide police headquarters, located
at Kedzie and Harrison on Chicago's Westside.
<P> 

Court indictments and police sources said that Angelo Roberts, a
known street gang leader, had verbally "declared war" on the
police district; allegedly because they were interfering in
"gang business".  Roberts was taped, earlier this year, in a
conversation with a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms
(BATF) undercover informant.  During the conversation, he
allegedly asked for a LAW rocket launcher and several automatic
assault rifles.  Police sources say that another member of the
same gang, Alvin Finney, actually met with undercover agents and
made a "down-payment" on the weapons, with a payment of $4,000
and a quarter-kilo of cocaine.  Finney was immediately arrested,
however, and no weapons were delivered.
<P>  

Other weapons, allegedly requested by the gang members, included
MP-5 9mm Submachineguns with silencers, and a quantity of
military- grade 5.56mm M-16 assault rifles.  Another unconfirmed
report indicated that streetgang members have also recently been
attempting to purchase military fragmentation grenades.  More
than twenty (20) U.S. Army "baseball-type" grenades have
previously been confiscated by police undercover operatives on
Chicago's Westside.
<P>

Harrison Ave. Police District Commander William G. LaFleur said
that they had been advised of the conspiracy by federal agents
and had taken additional security measures to ensure the safety
of officer and the public.  Security had also reportedly been
tightened at a court holding and arraignment facility that is
located adjacent to the police district.  Cmdr. LaFleur was
reportedly angered and outraged at the possibility of such an
attack on Chicago police officers.
<P> 

Roberts and two other fugitives named in the conspiracy and
weapons indictments remain at large.  They are considered by the
police to be armed and dangerous.  A search is reportedly being
conducted on Chicago's Westside and in several nearby suburbs,
where gang members are known to have "safe houses".

In light of recent developments in Israel and the Middle-East, much interest has been generated in the "The Engineer".  Yahya Ayyash allegedly led the military wing of Hamas and was well known for his proficiency as a "bomb maker". He was killed on Jan 5, 1996 by improvised explosive device contained within his cellular telephone. Israeli security officials have neither confirmed nor denied their involvement in Ayyash's death, but it is known that he was #1 on their most wanted list.

<H2>SIXTEEN STUDENTS HURT, ONE DEAD, IN HIGH SCHOOL VIOLENCE</H2>
By: Paul Anderson, Metro Correspondent
<P>
Chicago, IL - Four high school students remain hospitalized
in fair to critical condition at area hospitals following two
separate incidents of gang-related violence that occurred
here yesterday.  Delondyn Lawson, age 15, was reportedly
killed by two shots from a .22 caliber semi-automatic
handgun.  Twelve other students were treated and released for
a variety of injuries.
<P>

The first incident involved a morning "pep rally" at Marshall
High School, 3250 W. Adams, on Chicago's West side.
Witnesses say that the troubles began as school security
officials and Chicago Police conducted metal detector
searches of students reporting to school.  According to a
police spokesman, at least eight (8) students were arrested
for weapons violations, disorderly conduct, and other
charges. Shortly there afterward, the students were to attend
a rally for the basketball team in the school gymnasium.
<P>

As the students gathered in the gym, a disturbance broke out
and students began to push and shove each other. During the
commotion, the pushing became violent and a section of the
brick wall surrounding the balcony collapsed.  Several
students fell from the balcony, and other were injured by
falling bricks and debris.  A total of thirteen (13) students
were transported by Chicago Fire Department paramedics to
several area hospitals. A fourteen (14) year old girl and a
seventeen (17) year old girl were admitted to University of
Illinois and Cook County Hospitals, respectively, for their
injuries.
<P>
<HR>
The second incident, involving a dispute over the proceeds of
a "dice game", took place at Tilden High School, 4747 S.
Union, at approximately 10:00 a.m..  The shooting took place
in a hallway during a class break.  According to witnesses
from the school, an argument began as one student asked
another for his share of gambling profits from a game that
had previously occurred. As the argument escalated, one of
the students reportedly punched Joe White, age 15, in the
mouth.  White responded by pulling a .22 caliber handgun and
opening fire. Deceased is Delondyn Lawson, age 15, who was
struck in the back.
<P>

Two other students were also wounded in the gunfire.  Wilson
Ching, age 17, and Barron Hall, age 15, were transported to
Cook County Hospital were they were considered in critical
condition.  A third youth, reportedly an accomplice of the
gunman, was struck by a car while they were attempting to
flee the scene of the shooting, and was taken to St.
Bernard's hospital in good condition. The assailant, Joe
White, was arrested a short time later when found hiding
under the porch of a nearby building.
<P>
<HR>
Friday's incidents follow weeks of violence and mayhem in the
Chicago school system.  On November 13, 1992, thirty (30)
students were arrested as the result of an alleged gang-
fight at Farragut High school on Chicago's near Southwest
side.  Reportedly, as many as fifty (50) Chicago police
officers were called to the school shortly after 10:30 a.m.
in an attempt to quell a "running battle" that began in the
school's lunch room and spread to nearby hallways and onto
the sidewalk.
<P>

According to police records, twenty-nine (29) students were
charged with mob action in this incident and one was charged
with battery to a school security guard. Six (6) students
were injured in the melee and transported to St. Anthony's
Hospital, where they were treated for contusions and minor
lacerations and released. According to Farragut principal
Steve Newton, the major disturbance was the result of an gang
confrontation that had occurred the day before.  Allegedly,
the earlier fight resulted in retaliation and the major
disorder of the 13th.
<P>
<HR>

November 10, 1992 was also a tragic day for the Chicago
public schools.  As classmates watched, 13 year old Willie
Clayborn of the Sherman Elementary School turned a .22 cal.
handgun on himself and pulled the trigger. Willie was
pronounced dead shortly thereafter at an area hospital.
Classmates described Clayborn as "playing with the gun", when
it went off and struck him in the head. 
<P> 

Reportedly, the youth had earlier shown the gun to several other students and
had pointed it at his own stomach without incident, then he
pointed it at his head and it went off. Clayborn's parents
denied any knowledge of his having a gun and his mother even
said that she had prohibited him from having "toy guns".
Nonetheless, he had one on November 10th, and it took his
life.
<P>
<HR>
According to a recent survey by "Who's Who Among American
High School Students", these incidents are not isolated
occurances.  The survey, which interviewed high school aged
youths from all over the country, said that 40% of the
respondants reported that they knew of violent incidents that
had occurred in their schools.  A third of the reported
incidents were believed to be racially or gang motivated.
More surprisingly, over a third of the male students surveyed
said that they personally own or have access to handguns.
Almost half of the male students interviewed said that they
knew of someone who had brought a weapon to school.
<P>

Clark Staten, Executive Director of the Emergency Response &
Research Institute - a Chicago-based emergency services think
tank, said that the problem is far reaching and appears to be
rapidly escalating.  "Reports are being received from urban
areas, suburban, and rural schools", Staten said.  "Most
notable are the numerous incidents in the New York City
Schools, where dozens of children have been killed this
year...and in the Los Angeles County schools, where gang
confrontations seem to occur on almost a daily basis", the
veteran emergency manager added.  "Now, we see this same
wanton violence erupting in the Chicago School system", he
continued.
<P>

Staten, who operates a country-wide computer based
information sharing system for emergency responders and
managers, said that the preliminary statistics for youth
crime seem to be rising at a disproportionate rate to the
overall increase in street crime. "It seems more and younger
people are involved in violent crime, and that they are
engaging in acts that we may have not seen a few years ago",
Staten said. 
<P> 

"Street gang leaders are reportedly using
younger members to carry guns and drugs for them, because
they know that if the juveniles are caught...they will
receive better treatment and more lenient sentences than
older gang members", the experienced emergency analyst added.
"This earlier and more extensive involvement by younger gang
members seems to be leading them to more violent behavior at
an earlier age", Staten concluded.

<H2>ERRI REPORT: PD'S WITH LOW CLEARANCE RATES...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

The Emergency Response and Research Institute in Chicago has
just concluded a study of Federal Bureau of Investigation 
statistics that show the cities with the lowest clearance rates
of crime.  The study showed that the Las Vegas Metropolitan
Police Department cleared the lowest number of cases based on
numbers from 1994. Las Vegas Metro had a clearance rate of only 20.7 percent.  The
next lowest cities were: Detroit, Buffalo, San Francisco and
Miami.
<P>

Criminologists believe that the low clearance rate shown by Las Vegas
is indicative that crime is difficult to control in an area that is
currently growing rapidly in population and where there is a very
large influx of tourists.
<P>

The Las Vegas, Nevada, Metropolitan Police Department has about
1,300 police officers that patrols a very large jursidiction that
has a population of about 779,200 people and sees about 27 million
other people that visit, gamble and drink.  In 1994, 9,421 violent
crimes were reported.  Violent crimes include: homicide, manslaughter,
rape, aggravated assault and robbery.  Of the 9,421 violent crimes
reported, only 1,946 resulted in an arrest and prosecution.  That
comes out to a clearance rate of 20.7 percent.
<P>

Next on the list were: Detroit with 21.4 percent, Buffalo at 21.9
percent, the number jumps to 24.5 percent with San Francisco and
then Miami had 25.7 percent.  The national average rate of
clearance in the United States in 1994 was about 45 percent.
<P>

In January of 1995, Las Vegas Metro had a new sheriff take office.
Since Sheriff Jerry Keller took office, the clearance rate has
reportedly risen to about 27 percent. ERRI agrees with Sheriff Keller in saying that it is difficult to
compare Las Vegas, Nevada, with other large cities.  Las Vegas is
the fastest growing city in the United States that is currently
seeing an increase of 48,000 people a year.  Las Vegas is also
what could be called a 24-hour gambling mecca.
<P>

Sheriff Keller said, "We're unique in our 24-hour town nature,
unique in our growth, unique in the demographics of the community.
Any time you have money, you have two things that drive crime --
ego and greed.  Greed for wanting the money that someone else has,
and ego to think they can continue getting away with it."
<P>

Another issue that hampers Las Vegas Metro is that victims of
crime that are tourists leave the jurisdiction to return to
their home in other states or, in many cases, other countries.
Usually, these victims will not return back to Las Vegas to assist
authorities in the case should a suspect be apprehended.

<br>
<font size=6><strong>Terrorism Against the USA; The Next Target??</strong></font><br>
By: Clark Staten, ERRI Analyst<br>
<br>
Chicago, IL, July 11, 1996 (ENN)-- As Senate hearings examine and dissect the disastrous truck bombing of 
the Khobar Towers in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, the thoughts of many turn to the possible continuing threats that 
confront Americans in the Mid-East and elsewhere.<br>
<br>
An analysis by the Emergency Response &amp; Research Institute (ERRI), conducted since the Dhahran incident, 
would indicate that at least four areas seem to be of particular concern in the coming days: <br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>Saudi Arabia<br>
<br>
</strong></font><font size=3>On Wednesday evening (07/10/96), it was reported that U.S. intelligence has revealed that an unknown group, 
possibly the same one that struck Dhahran on 25 June 1996, is preparing for future strikes at U.S. government 
personnel and facilities, as well as American industrial/ commercial firms in Saudi Arabia. It was also reported 
that U.S. intelligence strongly suspects that U.S. facilities in the Saudi Kingdom have recently been the subject 
of possible terrorist surveillance.<br>
<br>
The United States State Department said on Wednesday that telephone threats have been made to the U.S. 
Embassy in Riyadh, to American firms in Saudi Arabia and to U.S. citizens in the country. The State 
Department also said that the &quot;sophistication&quot; of the bomb that was used in the 25 June bombing incident 
suggests that additional attacks are &quot;quite possible.&quot;<br>
<br>
In a written warning that was issued, the State Department said, &quot;It is likely some of these reports reflect 
planning for attacks. As a result, the U.S. Embassy wishes again to remind the entire American community of 
the importance of exercising extreme caution, keeping a low profile, reducing travel within the Kingdom and 
treating mail from unfamiliar sources with suspicion.&quot;</font><font size=4><strong><br>
<br>
Bahrain</strong></font><br>
<br>
Allied Naval facilities and associated military personnel in Bahrain and the immediate vicinity should be 
considered to be at high-risk for terrorist attack in the future. This assessment is based on increasing political 
and religious instability in Bahrain and demonstrated violence perpetrated by pro-Shi'ite factions within the 
country. Additionally, diplomatic and business facilities may be targeted by anti-Western forces in that area. 
Bahrain officials have blamed several recent bombings and arson attacks on Iranian backed Shi'ite &quot;terrorist 
cells&quot;.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>Pakistan</strong></font><br>
<br>
Recently developed intelligence information would suggest that United States embassies and personnel in 
Karachi and Islamabad, Pakistan may be at particular risk of terrorist threat in the coming days and weeks. 
Counter-terrorist analysts say that they fear a similar occurrence to the Nov. 19, 1995 bombing of the<br>
Egyptian Embassy, that killed 15 and injured another 60. <br>
<br>
Two explosive devices were hurled at the American Information Center in Lahore, capital of the central 
Pakistan province of Punjab, on April 22, 1996. Thankfully, they caused no major damage. At least 80 people 
have been killed and more than 200 injured this year in bus/car/truck-related bombings in Islamabad, Lahore 
and Karachi. Although the barb-wire topped brick walls at the U.S. Embassy in Karachi might appear<br>
formidable to the uninitiated and might be useful in keeping intruders from the grounds, they would probably 
prove to be of little protection when faced with an exploding car bomb. Caution is urged in Pakistan.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>Bosnia-Herzegovina</strong></font><br>
<br>
Recent press and intelligence revelations that there are still &quot;hundreds&quot; of Islamic &quot;mujahideen&quot; fighters in Bosnia 
has raised the terrorism alert levels of American troops there. The Islamic militants have been reportedly 
establishing themselves in a broad swatch of central Bosnia, particularly in villages around the cities of Travnik, 
Zenica, Zavidovici and Kakanj. <br>
<br>
The reports follow a February 15, 1996 IFOR raid, in which eight Bosnians and three men suspected to be 
Iranian nationals were taken into custody. The NATO raid took place on Feb. 15th at about 2:00 p.m. 
(Bosnian time) at a former ski chalet located about six miles south of Fojnica. Intelligence documents,<br>
booby-traps, sabotage devices, explosives and weapons were confiscated. The chalet was described as a 
&quot;terrorist training school&quot; by NATO officials.<br>
<br>
ERRI analysts say that they originally feared that the Islamic &quot;mujahideen&quot; were to be used as &quot;stay-behind&quot; 
training and indoctrination agents, who would not be activated until American forces had departed the area later 
this year. It now appears that they may be becoming more heavily involved an on-going instigation of insurgency 
efforts against the American and NATO troops and that more instability and terrorist attacks may be 
forthcoming in Bosnia. <br>
<br>
In each of these countries, one of the purposes of an attempted terrorist attack would seem to be to prompt an 
American withdrawal from the area. Recent historical experiences in Somalia, Haiti, Africa and even Viet Nam 
have led extremists to firmly believe that if U.S. soldiers and diplomats are forced to &quot;shed blood&quot; that they will 
be quickly withdrawn from a conflict by American politicians or public opinion.<br>
<br>
Threat levels directed against Americans, in general, continue at a high level throughout the world, according to 
an ERRI computer- generated summary that was produced on July 6th, 1996. Extra caution is urged while 
engaging in foreign travel, particularly in Eastern Europe, the Mid-East, and Far-East. <br>

<H2>'Roofies', The New "Date Rape" Drug of Choice</H2>
By Clark Staten, ERRI Executive Director
<P>

Chicago, IL., January 6, 1995 (ENN) --Like the Quaaludes of the
60's and 70's, there is a new "love drug" being abused in
several parts of the country.  The drug is Rohypnol, or
"Roofies" as it being is called on the street. It is also called
"ruffies", "roche", "R-2", "rib" and "rope" and reportedly is
quickly becoming the "date rape drug of choice."
<P>

Rohypnol is a brand name for flunitrazepam (a benzodiazepine), a
very potent tranquilizer similar in nature to valium (diazepam),
but many times stronger. The drug produces a sedative effect,
amnesia, muscle relaxation, and a slowing of psychomotor
responses. Sedation occurs 20-30 minutes after administration
and lasts for several hours. The drug is often distributed on the street in
it's original "bubble packaging" which adds an air of legitimacy
and makes it appear to be legal. The drug is not commonly used
by physicians in the United States and is not even listed in the
commonly used Physician's Desk Reference.
<P>

Illicit use of Rohypnol was originally reported in Europe in the
late 1970's and world-wide use of it has continually increased
since then. According to police sources in both Florida and
Texas, "roofies" were first seen in the United States in the
early 1990's; they quickly gained acceptance and use by both
high school and college students. According to the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) more than 1,000 cases of
illegal Rohypnol possession have been reported recently, in
thirteen states. Reports have also been received of it being
popular in "gay bars" in selected locations on both the East and
West coasts.  In fact, Rohypnol is now being reported as being
one of the "in" drugs on high school and college campuses and
particularly in college fraternities. And to make matters worse,
"Roofies" are inexpensive and reportedly being sold for as
little as $2.00-$4.00 per tablet in several locations.
<P>

According to a University of Florida drug hotline, "Roofies" are
often combined with alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine to produce a
rapid and very dramatic "high".  Even when used by itself, users
can appear extremely intoxicated, with slurred speech, no
coordination, swaying, and blood-shot eyes...with no odor of
alcohol. The drug has been added to punch and other drinks at
fraternity parties and college social gatherings, where it is
reportedly given to female party participants in hopes of
lowered inhibitions and facilitating potential sexual conquest. Police
departments in several parts of the country say that after
ingestion of "Roofies" that several young women have reported
waking up in frat houses with no clothes on, finding themselves
in unfamiliar surroundings with unfamiliar people, or having
actually been sexually assaulted while under the influence of
the drug. 
<P>

As insidious, disgusting and perilous as this may sound, the
dangers don't stop there. Besides the worries of unprotected
sex, Rohypnol, particularly when mixed with alcohol or other
drugs may lead to respiratory depression, aspiration, and even
death. When taken repeatedly, it can lead to physical and
psychic dependence, which is thought to increase with both dose
and duration of use. An amnesia producing effect of "Roofies"
may prevent users from remembering how or why they took the drug
or even that they were given it by others. This makes
investigation of sexually related or other offenses very
difficult and may account for repeated reports of "date rapes"
involving the use of the drug.
<P>

Both law enforcement and drug counseling services caution that
the use of Rohypnol is increasing and that additional quantities
of it are being imported across the Mexican border, where it can
be obtained by prescription. ERRI drug abuse analysts warn that
"Roofies" are  just another in a long list of dangerous drugs
that are being imported and "pushed" to the impressionable youth
of this country.

<H2>Bomb Deflection Device Offered in 1979</H2>
By Clark Staten, ERRI CT Analyst
<P>
Chicago, IL, June 29, 1996 (ENN)--According to Paul Copher,
former federal agent and Air Force Office of Special
Investigation (OSI) officer, at least some military security
specialists and counter-terrorist analysts had feared a bombing
similar to what happened in Dhahran as early as the late 1970's.
At that time, during security assessments of U.S. military and
diplomatic facilities, reviews were reportedly filed, by a
number of agents, expressing their concerns about the
vulnerability of American installations in the Mid-East.
<P>

Not only did the these agents attempt to spread an alarm about
possible threats to U.S. facilities, but they also did research
in regard to ways to better protect the bases. Unfortunately, it
would appear, that these reports must have either been disregarded or
simply filed without comment, consideration, or action.
<P> 

One of the ideas developed by Copher and his fellow agents
involved a "bomb deflection device" that could have proved
useful in limiting damage like that which occurred to Air force
housing buildings in Dhahran.  Although Copher admits that the
device may not prove as useful in protecting "high-rise"
buildings, he says that if the devices were properly placed they
could have helped to minimize the destruction in Dhahran.
(Figure #1 - Bomb Deflection Device)
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="/BOMBFNC.GIF"></center>
<P>
ERRI analysts, in concert with other military planners, have offered an additional modification to Copher's design, which may further deflect the blast upward and prevent suicide car/truck bombers from attempting to use the device as a ramp for entrance into a compound. (Figure #2; ERRI Modification - Bomb Blast Deflection Device.)
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="/bombfnc2.gif"></center>
<P>
Copher, who has taught military and federal law enforcement
officers about improvised explosive devices (IEDs), said that
the "deflection devices" were originally designed to protect
"low rise" or buildings of less than four stories.  And, he
said, that he would not recommend placing military, diplomatic,
or other essential personnel or facilities in "high-rise"
buildings that are difficult to adequately protect and defend.
He pointed to the 1983 Beirut Marine barracks bombing as another
example of a "high-rise" building that proved difficult to
defend.
<P>

Counter-terrorist and explosives experts tell ENN that a
"deflection device", like that suggested by Copher, might well
prove useful in protecting American facilities.  They say that
military and facility security planners might want to give this
idea a chance and conduct the necessary tests to determine its
effectiveness. But, they warn that even this idea might fail in
the face of a large enough explosive device. They say that if an
explosion were large enough and of enough force, that the
"deflection devices" would be obliterated... along with anyone
and anything else in the vicinity. The real issue, they say, is
how to stop the bombers before they set the device.

<H2>"Device" Exploded in Cargo Hold of Air France 747</H2>
By: Clark Staten
<P>

(ENN) Initial reports are being received of a possible "event" occuring at approx. 16:30EDT at Newark International Airport, Terminal B.  The "event" reportedly involved a "sudden flash and smoke" from the cargo hold of a Air France 747 that was about to depart Newark. The Port Authority Police and Sussex County Bomb Squad have responded and the cargo hold is currently be searched for "another device."  No injuries were immediately reported. The plane has been pulled away from the terminal building and parts of the airport have been evacuated.
<P>

ENN is still gathering additional information and will provide additional reports as more becomes available.
<P>
<HR>
Update: 05/15/96-10:00CDT-Follow-Up Report
<P>
(ENN) Subsequent investigation revealed that the "explosion" was probably attributable to a "pressurized container", in an individual suitcase, that discharged and frightened baggage handlers. No arrests were made and one unidentified individual was released immediately following questioning. Airport officials said that they instituted a full "bomb squad response" out of caution and concerns about possible terrorist attacks.  Newark International Airport has reportedly been on a heightened state of alert for some period of time.

<font size=5>INDIAN BOMBINGS CAUSED BY &quot;FOREIGN 
EXTREMISTS&quot;, ACCORDING TO POLICE</font><br>
<br>
By Clark Staten<br>
<br>
Bombay, India- A series of fifteen (15) massive explosions rocked the length<br>
and breadth of Bombay, India on Friday, March 12, 1993. The blasts, which<br>
killed at least two hundred and twenty eight (228) people and injured more<br>
than 1,200, reportedly struck several Bombay neighborhoods simultaneously.<br>
Police Chief Amarjeet Singh Samra was quoted by the Reuter's News Service<br>
as saying that the detonations were of a type never before experienced,<br>
and that he believed that the destruction was the work of &quot;foreign extremists&quot;.<br>
<br>
Indian Explosive ordinance disposal experts say that the explosions are<br>
believed caused as the result of detonations of SEMTEX or RDX, packed into<br>
car bombs, both of which are plastic explosives that are commonly used by the<br>
military, mercenaries, and terrorist groups. Chief Samra said that, to his<br>
knowledge, this was the first time that these types of explosives were<br>
ever used in India. Chief Samra also said that this also was the first time<br>
for such a coordinated and widespread attack on one of India's financial and<br>
business centers.<br>
<br>
Samra refused to confirm a report by the United News Service of India that the<br>
calamity was caused by a group of Kashmirian Moslem &quot;conspirators&quot;, who may<br>
have links to a disgruntled &quot;man of Iranian origin&quot;, who is also being sought<br>
by police for questioning. An official police spokesperson said that the blasts<br>
may have ties to the &quot;Tamil Tigers&quot;, a Sri Lankan liberationist group that<br>
has vowed revenge against India for intervention in a civil war in Sri Lanka.<br>
Police Chief Samra was quoted as saying that members of the &quot;Tamil Tigers&quot;<br>
were among the few people in the region who possess the explosives and<br>
expertise to have perpetrated the bombings. Unofficial police sources, on<br>
the other hand, do confirm that a Kashmiri man was captured by hotel security<br>
personnel as he attempted to flee the area, immediately following the explosions.<br>
Police are reportedly searching for five (5) other &quot;Moslem accomplices&quot;, and<br>
one &quot;disgruntled Iranian&quot;, who may have suffered property losses in the January<br>
rioting between Moslems and Hindus.<br>
<br>
American and British counter-terrorist analysts said that it was &quot;too early&quot;<br>
to learn the origin of the perpetrators of the Bombay blasts, but at least<br>
one observer from the United States said that the Bombay incident looks like<br>
a continuation of the Islamic Fundamentalist inspired violence that has been<br>
engulfing the Mideast, and even America in the past month. According to<br>
unofficial reports, the methods used in Bombay have an &quot;uncanny similarity&quot;<br>
to the method used in the World Trade Center bombing in New York. Police<br>
investigators confirm that at least two of the car bombs were driven into<br>
underground garages of luxury hotels, and then detonated by &quot;remote-control&quot;<br>
or &quot;timed delay&quot; mechanisms. The experts also pointed out the fact, that<br>
the fifteen different devices, located in fifteen different locations,<br>
exploded almost simultaneously. They say that this is the mark of a<br>
professional organization having perpetrated the crime.<br>
<br>
Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao came immediately to the affected areas and<br>
surveyed the damage. Rao offered all of the services of the Indian government<br>
in the investigation of catastrophe, and vowed to assist in the rebuilding of<br>
the hotels, businesses, and financial agencies destroyed by Friday's explosions.<br>
Rao declined to comment on a theory that the blasts were a continuation of<br>
the conflict between Fundamentalist Moslems and Hindus, which had previously<br>
resulted in nine days of rioting, and killed more than six-hundred (600) people,<br>
in January of this year. Rao also was quoted by several news agencies as<br>
appealing for calm among Hindus, in hopes of preventing further retaliation.<br>
<br>
Bombay hospitals were said to be filled to capacity with the dying and wounded<br>
from Friday's firestorm of bombs. Rescue officials described the scene as<br>
&quot;chaotic&quot; and that police, firefighters and ambulance personnel were often<br>
&quot;clawing&quot; through wreckage of the collapsed buildings with their bare hands<br>
in a heroic effort to save the badly burned and wounded. One doctor said that<br>
people came stumbling into the emergency facility at the hospital, where he<br>
works, at such a rate that it was impossible for doctors and nurses to treat<br>
them all. He described the injuries as a combination of blunt trauma,<br>
concussion type injuries, burns, and penetrating shrapnel wounds.<br>
<br>
The investigation continues. Official sources confirm that no group has yet to<br>
claim responsibility for the bombings. A reward in the equivalent of<br>
$32,000.00 (US$) has been posted by the Indian government for information<br>
leading to capture and conviction of the bombers. Indian anti-terrorist experts<br>
say that the trail is likely to lead them to a country other than India, so as<br>
to find the &quot;evil criminals&quot; that destroyed the lives of so many people<br>
on Friday.<br>

<font size=5><strong>GBI Agents Called Heros in Olympic Park Bombing</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
ATLANTA (ENN) - Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) agent Tom Davis, age 37, and eight other law 
enforcement officers are being credited with preventing Saturday morning's bombing at Centennial Olympic Park 
from becoming even a worse bloodbath than what is was. Davis, a 15-year veteran, was only trying to quiet some 
rowdy drunks when fate put him face-to-face with a bomb packed in a knapsack.<br>
<br>
Davis had be originally dispatched to handle some rowdy people. By the time he arrived at the scene where there 
was supposed to be a disturbance, the rowdy people were gone. A stage security guard then pointed to a new 
problem -- an unattended green knapsack left under a picnic bench. At the time of the discovery, Davis was not 
aware of a bomb threat that was called into Atlanta 911 operators.<br>
<br>
Something in his cop instinct made Davis highly suspicious of the bag. He called for a bomb diagnostic team. The 
bomb experts looked at the bag and they didn't like what they saw, either. Only twenty minutes after the discovery, 
as Davis and other officers were trying tactfully to steer people away from the area -- the knapsack blew up.<br>
<br>
Agent Steve Blackwell, also with the GBI, was also one of the officers who tried to usher people away from the light 
and sound tower. Blackwell said, &quot;I didn't want to say we had a bomb. That would have created a panic.&quot; He 
added, &quot;If I told you I wasn't scared, I'd be lying.&quot;<br>
<br>
Blackwell was injured in the blast. He related what happened by saying, &quot;My team and I spread out along the crowd 
and began to back it up and the bomb detonated. I saw a flash. I saw a puff of smoke. I saw the orange flame. Then 
something grabbed me and threw me across the ground.&quot; Small pieces of shrapnel entered into the 33-year-old's 
right leg. He was transported to Georgia Baptist Medical Center where he was met by his wife, who is an emergency 
room nurse at the hospital.<br>
<br>
Investigators said that the bomb was a crude, but effective explosive device, a pipe bomb, which had nails and 
screws attached. The bomber apparently carried the backpack into the park and dropped it next to the light and 
sound tower. Shrapnel from the explosion was thrown upwards to 100 yards. FBI Atlanta Division 
Special-Agent-In-Charge Woody Johnson said, &quot;We are dealing with an improvised explosive device, what we 
would describe as an anti-personnel fragmentation device, a home-made bomb. I am certain that the evidence obtain 
from that will provide leads ... the evidence that we are now obtaining will be flown to Washington for evaluation by 
our lab, much of it today. We have a fairly good idea where the 911 call came from and we are conducting 
investigations around that particular information.&quot; Johnson added that there may have been more than one device in 
the knapsack with nails and screws attached. <br>
<br>
One of the people killed was a 44-year-old woman. She died from massive head wounds received in the blast. The 
other victim was a 40-year-old Turkish national. He died from a heart attack sustained right after the blast. All-in-all, 
the death toll would probably have been much higher if police had not been already trying to clear spectators away 
from the area before the bomb detonated.<br>
<br>
At 0107 EDT, Atlanta Police received a 911 emergency call from person warning that a bomb would explode in the 
park within 30 minutes. FBI Special-Agent-In-Charge Johnson said, &quot;We have listened to the tape of the individual 
who made the call to the 911 number. We believe it to be a white male with an indistingushable accent.&quot; The man is 
believed be an American.<br>
<br>
Troubles for the security personnel in Atlanta did not stop in the park on Saturday. After the explosion, there was a 
rash of prank bomb threats. Johnson said, &quot;Since the device went off, we have had a number of phone calls and 
suspicious reports. We had dispatched bomb disposal teams to 35 locations prior to 11:00 a.m. this morning.&quot;<br>
<br>
At 1300 EDT, spectators at the boxing venue were not allowed to enter the stadium because of a bomb scare. The 
semifinal men's beach volleyball game was halted because of another threat. Bomb threats were received a train 
station and at Grady Hospital, where many of the injured victims from the bomb blast were taken. In the late 
afternoon, bomb technicians had to conduct a controlled explosion of a suspicious package at a shopping center. 
The package is believed to have only contained a clothes iron.<br>
<br>
The current wave of violence is beginning to undermine the once- confident view that many Americans had -- that the 
U.S. was invulnerable to terrorist attacks. Neil Livingstone, a well-known terrorism expert said, &quot;There's a deep 
sense of unease in America today and this is just going to exacerbate that. I'm afraid we're just going to see ... more 
and more security as a response to the fears.&quot;<br>
<br>
Israeli terrorism experts were saying on Sunday that the bombing on Saturday morning in Atlanta suggests more of 
the work of a rank-amateur rather than an international terrorist. David Tsur, an Israeli advisor to Olympic security 
officials and who is a former commander of Israeli police special forces, said, &quot;Because of the amateurish charge -- 
and it appears to be something improvised -- we believe it's not any sort of complex organization or that an 
international terrorist organization did this.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tsur said that he believes that the bomber was &quot;a frustrated citizen&quot; or a &quot;redneck who hates the establishment.&quot; He 
said, &quot;It seems more a local initiative which is part of the domestic terrorism in the United States that has become 
more and more troubling.&quot;<br>
<br>
It is in the opinion of Tsur that there are very few similarities between this bombing and the terrorist incident that 
struck the Olympic Games in Munich, Germany, in 1972. Tsur said, &quot;Munich is not exactly, in my opinion, the right 
example. It's correct these are the only times that at sporting events there were showcase attacks. But Munich was 
different in substance from the present attack. Here there was an attack in a public center connected to the 
Olympics. But there is no resemblance here to the infiltration of the Olympic Village in Munich.&quot;<br>
<br>
Another Israeli expert, Hebrew University Professor Ehud Sprinzak said, &quot;According to all the signs, it's the work of 
an amateur. The world is full of lunatics and people who are awfully angry.&quot; Sprinzak said that, in his opinion, there 
was no link to Saturday's bombing and the downing of TWA Flight 800. He said, &quot;There's no sort of link. No pipe 
bomb can blow up a plane and there are truly no signs that it's the same target and it's definitely another story 
altogether.&quot;<br>

<Center><H2>The FBI'S Critical Incident Negotiation Team</H2>
By JAMES M. BOTTING, M.S., FREDERICK J. LANCELEY, M.S.,
GARY W. NOESNER, M.Ed.
<P>

-Special Agent Botting is assigned to the FBI's Los Angeles Division.
<BR>
-Mr. Lanceley, a retired FBI special agent, formerly worked in the
Crisis Management Unit.
<BR>
-Special Agent Noesner is assigned to the Crisis Management Unit of
the FBI's Critical Incident Response Group.</center>
<P>

In the early 1980s, the country witnessed a rise in the number of
long-term hostage and barricade incidents. For example, members of
the Aryan Nation created a barricade situation on Whidbey Island,
Washington, in December 1984. Earlier, a small, right-wing survivalist
group known as the Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord was
involved in a similar incident in Arkansas. FBI hostage negotiators
successfully resolved these situations and others like them, but the
incidents challenged the crisis negotiation capacity of the FBI and
pointed to the need for a special response mechanism.
<P>

As a result, the Crisis Management Unit (CMU)1 at the FBI Academy
developed a new approach. In 1985, the CMU formed the Critical
Incident Negotiation Team (CINT), a small, highly trained and mobile
group of experienced FBI crisis negotiators. This team became the
nucleus of an organized response to complex and potentially lengthy
hostage and barricade incidents nationwide.
<P>

The FBI typically negotiates approximately 45 bank robbery and
hijacking hostage incidents annually. The wealth of knowledge
developed from these experiences, coupled with lessons learned from
other law enforcement agencies, prepare CINT members to handle
high-risk incidents. In addition to handling situations arising under FBI
jurisdiction, the CINT provides around-the-clock consultation to State
and local law enforcement agencies. 
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="/bluefade.gif"></center>

<H3>Selection of Team Members</H3>

The original CINT members were drawn from a pool of more  than
350 FBI negotiators nationwide based on resume reviews, personal
interviews, psychological testing, and negotiation experience. This
group of 25 negotiators was multiracial and multilingual, with one
member being fluent in five languages. Most had been hostage
negotiators for 10-15 years and had extensive operational, investigative,
and training experience. Their diverse investigative experience included
foreign counterintelligence, counterterrorism, organized crime, and
general criminal investigation.
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="/bluefade.gif"></center>

<H3>Training</H3>

Because most of those selected for CINT had been police instructors in
the field, they possessed an excellent working knowledge of negotiation
strategies, hostage and barricade techniques, and crisis management
principles, in addition to actual negotiation experience. Nevertheless,
CMU arranged and coordinated semiannual training seminars conducted
either at the FBI Academy or at other field locations that could
accommodate the team's special instructional needs. For example, the
team conducted joint training with the Department of Energy's Nuclear
Emergency Search Team (NEST) and participated in numerous
long-term national training exercises conducted in Albuquerque, New
Mexico; Camp Pendleton, California; and Indianapolis, Indiana.
Criminal profilers and mental health professionals experienced in
personality assessment also provided instruction for the team.
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="/bluefade.gif"></center>

<H3>Preparation for Negotiations Overseas</H3>

The International Hostage Taking Act of 1984 tasked the FBI with
deploying agents overseas to conduct hijacking and kidnaping
investigations. This responsibility requires CINT members to interact
regularly with Department of State personnel and to receive overseas
operations training. Training in this area focuses on developing
meaningful threat assessments, devising strategies for responding to
ransom demands, and coordinating the efforts of the U.S. Embassy
staff, host country police, and intelligence agencies, as well as
employers and families of the victims.
<P>

Team members familiarize themselves with diplomatic procedures,
receive numerous inoculations for protection against disease, study
cultural variables, review overseas jurisdiction, and generally prepare
for rapid deployment abroad. CINT members also attend a 2-week
negotiation course offered by the Metropolitan Police Department in
London, England, for supplementary training.
<P>

In addition to general training, CINT also has focused on preparing for
specific threats. Immediately prior to the Gulf War in 1991, a special
session was held at the FBI Academy to prepare CINT negotiators to
deal with the potential threats posed by international terrorists. The
team reviewed past terrorist incidents in the Middle East and examined
the impact that culture, history, politics, and religion had on violence in
the region.
<P>

Today, training for CINT members continues on a regular basis to
address pertinent and current challenges and to maintain the team's
state-of-the-art readiness. Refresher training focuses on such areas as
nuclear, chemical, and biological extortion; cult ideology; international
terrorism; abnormal psychology; and crisis/suicide intervention.
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="/bluefade.gif"></center>

<H3>Deployment</H3>

The FBI deploys CINT negotiators for one of two reasons. First, when
the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team responds to a hostage or barricade
incident, a negotiation program manager from the CMU accompanies
the team's advance group. Upon arrival at the scene, the program
manager confers with local field office negotiators to assess the
situation, the need for language or other specialty skills, the projected
time span of the situation, the availability of local FBI field office
negotiators, and the number of additional negotiators who may be
needed. The program manager then contacts appropriate CINT
members and instructs them to report to the scene, if warranted.
<P>

Since 1985, CINT members have negotiated domestic incidents such as
the Cuban prisoner uprisings in Oakdale, Louisiana; Atlanta, Georgia;
and Talladega, Alabama, as well as standoffs with religious zealots in
Marion, Utah; Ruby Creek, Idaho; and Waco, Texas. Other situations
where the team provided assistance include the Lucasville, Ohio, prison
riot and a week-long barricaded siege in Missoula, Montana.
<P>

CINT negotiators also respond to situations in other countries at the
request of a U.S. Ambassador, usually to assist in negotiating the
release of Americans held hostage or kidnaped by terrorists or other
criminal groups. In these international incidents, the CMU dispatches
selected negotiators either to the country where the hostages are being
held or to an adjacent country more receptive to the presence of
Americans. CINT members deployed overseas generally respond in
teams of two.
<P>

Since 1985, CINT negotiators have assisted in the release of American
hostages held in Ecuador, Chile, El Salvador, Bolivia, Colombia,
Panama, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Zaire, Cambodia, and the Philippines.
These delicate international incidents require team members to work
closely with U.S. Embassy personnel, the families and employers of the
victims, and the law enforcement agencies of the host countries. As a
result of the team's successful record, requests for as-sistance continue
to increase. To date, team members have been deployed overseas 22
times.
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="/bluefade.gif"></center>

<H3>International Assistance</H3>

Recently, the team acquired an additional mission_international police
training and consulting. As a result, CINT negotiators have met with
police forces around the globe to provide training in crisis
management as it pertains to kidnaping and hostage incidents.
<P>
<H4>Case Study</H4>

On October 25, 1993, deputy sheriffs in Missoula, Montana, attempted
to arrest a subject on an assault warrant. The subject fired a rifle shot
that shattered the windshield of the deputy's cruiser and slightly
wounded the officer. The subject subsequently barricaded himself inside
his home with his wife and three of his nine children. The subject, who
emigrated from the Ukraine 3 years earlier, had limited
English-speaking ability and a history of mental instability.
<P>

The Missoula County Sheriff's Department and Missoula Police
Department set up a perimeter and opened negotiations with the subject
in an attempt to resolve the standoff peacefully. However, the subject's
mental state and his insistence on speaking only in Russian complicated
the negotiations. Commanders at the scene called the CMU, which set
up telephonic support from CINT negotiators for the sheriff's and
police department's negotiators in Missoula. The FBI also dispatched
Russian-speaking agents to the scene to provide language support.
While these agents contributed valuable linguistic assistance, they were
not trained crisis negotiators.
<P>

Missoula County authorities subsequently requested the assistance of a
Russian-speaking negotiator. CMU identified two CINT members, one
a native Russian speaker and the other, an experienced Soviet
counterintelligence investigator, and immediately dispatched them from
Washington, DC, to Missoula.
<P>

To resolve the situation, the Russian-speaking CINT member directed
and coached the subject's wife as she spoke with her husband. By
closely following the guidance provided by the negotiators, she
ultimately convinced her husband to surrender. The direct involvement
of CINT members and the professional effort of the Missoula law
enforcement com-munity peacefully resolved the week-long standoff
without further incident.
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="/bluefade.gif"></center>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>

Protracted hostage and barricade situations present a special challenge
to law enforcement. By learning from past incidents and tapping into
the experiences of other law enforcement agencies worldwide, the FBI
Crisis Management Unit developed the Critical Incident Negotiation
Team. Through its training and consultation services, the team of
highly trained and experienced negotiators is available to assist law
enforcement agencies around the world to resolve peacefully complex,
high-risk incidents at any time, day or night.

<H3>Obtaining CINT Assistance</H3>

CINT negotiators provide telephonic consultation to law enforcement
agencies 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, in response to hostage or
barricade incidents.

<p><font size=5><strong>IRA VIOLENCE GREATEST SINCE 1972, NO END IN SIGHT?</strong><br>
</font><font size=3>By Clark Staten, ERRI Analyst</font></p>
<p><font size=3><strong>IRA Terrorism Review July, 1993 to November, 1993</strong></font></p>
<p>Chicago, IL - On July 5, 1993, the City of London, England erected the first &quot;permanent&quot; roadblocks on streets 
leading into the city's financial district. Even though protestors complained about the inconvenience of the 
checkpoints, and commuters were concerned about traffic congestion, the foresight of the military and police has 
been proven a necessity. Since that time, literally hundreds of terrorist attacks have taken place in Ireland and Britian. </p>
<p>The crackdown was originally motivated by one of the worst weekends of rioting in Belfast, Northern Ireland that 
has occurred in recent years. Police recorded more than 1,000 separate incidents and 30 people hurt during the 4th 
of July weekend. Rioting was originally prompted by an attempt by the Royal Ulster Constabulary to reroute a 
parade of British loyalist Protestants away from a Catholic district of Western Belfast. It quickly spread and resulted 
in gun, grenade, and arson attacks against both firefighters and police. That fateful weekend has proved to be the 
start of &quot;reign of terror&quot; that is unheard of in England since the Irish Republican Army (IRA) riots of 1972. </p>
<p>During the month of August, the rhetoric between British authorities and the political wing of the IRA continued to 
increase, both in numbers of statements and the intensity of inflammatory debate. Sir John Wheeler, British Security 
Minister in Northern Ireland, was quoted as claiming that the IRA was being defeated in it's fight to end British rule in 
the strife-torn Northern end of the island. </p>
<p>Senn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, responded to the statement by saying that it would &quot;escalate it's armed 
stuggle&quot; against those that would prevent self-rule for the Irish. Unfortunately, since that time, the IRA has proved 
that is capable of carrying out such threats. Within two days, on August 29th, a small bomb was found inside the 
recently established security area of London's financial district. Thankfully, it didn't explode, but did demonstrate that 
the IRA had the ability to strike almost anywhere it chose. </p>
<p>During September, the IRA seemed to concentrate on military targets. September 23rd brought a machinegun attack 
on a British Army helicopter, as it was taking off from a base in Armagh, near the Ireland border. No injuries were 
reported, but numerous bullet holes were found in the helicopter. Two men with reported ties to the IRA were taken 
into custody following the incident. On September 24th, a &quot;command controlled&quot; bomb was detonated as a British 
security patrol was passing an intersection in Western Belfast. One soldier and six civilians were wounded by 
shrapnel. Large areas of the countryside were cordoned off by security forces as they searched for the bombers. </p>
<p>Early October brought even greater violence. Two suspected IRA bombs rocked parts of North London on 
October 8, 1993. One went off in an intersection on Staples Corner Road just before midnight. A second bomb, 
with more deadly implications, completely destroyed the front of a fire station in the West Hampstead area of 
London. The blast blew the windows out of several nearby houses and resulted in at least three injuries. These 
bombings followed a series of smaller explosions in the Finchley Road area that also caused injuries earlier in the 
week. An anti-terrorist commander, David Tucker, was quoted by the Reuters News Service as saying that these 
bombings marked &quot;sinister new tactics&quot; on the part of the IRA. </p>
<p>By October 11th, London police were issuing a statement that a total of ten bombings had taken place in or near 
London during the last ten days. Reportedly, London suburbs had now become the target of IRA bombers. Police 
speculated that intense security in London's financial district and in the vicinity of Whitehall government offices had 
caused IRA bombers to move their operations to more remote sights, in hopes of attacking less well secured areas. 
One counter- terrorist officer said the IRA was targeting London suburbs in hopes of distracting anti-terrorist forces, 
so that additional attacks could be carried out later against vital targets. </p>
<p>Tuesday, October 12th, was another fateful day for anti- terrorist officers. Reportedly, information from a 
confidential informant led Scotland Yard officials to a IRA &quot;bomb factory&quot; in Northern London. Officers say that 
they confiscated enough of the plastic explosive SEMTEX to make as many as twenty (20) explosive devices. 
Fuses, timing devices, and a handgun were also found in the raid. Three men were arrested during the raid. Derek 
Doherty - age 23, Gerard Mackin - age 32, and Thomas McAuley - age 37, were all taken into custody and 
charged with possession of explosives and conspiracy to cause explosions. </p>
<p>By Mid-October, expert observers of the decades-old &quot;troubles&quot; with Northern Ireland said that the current 
bombing campaign was &quot;only part&quot; of a larger plan to achieve it's objectives of attaining Catholic self-rule in the 
Northern provinces. They pointed to talks between politican John Hume and Senn Fein, in hopes of demonstrating 
the possibility of a negotiated settlement. Reportedly, Hume and Senn Fein leader Gerry Adams have both offered to 
negotiate with Prime Minister John Major in an effort to end the violence. But, counter-terrorist operatives say that 
the offer of talks has been preceded by greater disorder and may be followed by even greater disturbance if the 
outcome is not favorable to the IRA. Prime Minister Major said that he would not negotiate with the IRA unless they 
denounce violence. </p>
<p>October 23rd, 1993 brought a bloody demonstration of the capability of the Provisional IRA to wreck havoc on the 
unsuspecting Protestants of Belfast, Northern Ireland. The deadliest attack of the past six (6) years was carried out 
by two men who carried a bomb into a &quot;fish and chips&quot; shop, where it detonated and killed ten (10) people. 
Reportedly, fifty (50) others were injured by flying debris or buried by collapsing buildings. The IRA acknowledged 
responsibility for the blast, which it said was aimed at an outlawed Protestant paramilitary organization called the 
Ulster Defense Association. An IRA source, however, tried to justify the carnage by saying that the bomb had 
exploded prematurely, before they had an opportunity to warn area residents. </p>
<p>By October 26th, two Protestant gunmen, wearing yellow coveralls and disguised as workmen, took revenge for the 
fishshop bombing. They burst into a city-operated garbage depot and killed two Roman Catholic garbagemen 
outright and wounded five (5) others. The Ulster Freedom Fighters, a Protestant right-wing military group, 
immediately claimed responsibility for the atrocity. Reportedly, they issued a statement saying that this killing was 
&quot;direct revenge&quot; for the October 23rd bombing in Belfast. Extra police and army troops were dispatched to the area 
to attempt to head-off additional reprisals, which had been threatened by outraged Protestants. The 27th of the 
month, however, showed the difficulty of of stopping extremists, bent on revenge. </p>
<p>It was only a mechanical failure that prevented a &quot;sectarian massacre&quot; in a bar frequented by Catholics, in Lisburn, a 
Southwest suburb of Belfast. According to police sources, a gunman from the Ulster Freedom Fighters attempted to 
open fire on a crowd of Catholics in a pub when his submachinegun misfired. Customers say that they dived for 
cover and that the gunman fled after the weapon jammed. Worse, was a similar attack by a masked gunman that 
took place on Saturday night, October 30th, in a bar near Londonderry. That attack was far more deadly in its 
effect. </p>
<p>Seven (7) people were killed and another twelve (12) injured when a reputed Ulster Freedom Fighter burst into the 
Rising Sun Bar near Londonderry and swept the bar with a burst of automatic weapons fire. Reportedly, the gunman 
fired a long burst, calmly reloaded, and emptied another magazine into the crowded pub. People dropped to the 
floor, many of them bleeding from gaping wounds caused by the 9mm bullets. Police and ambulances rushed to the 
scene, but not before the gunman had fufilled his vengence and fled into the foggy Irish night. October ended as one 
of the bloodiest months in the history of the conflict between Protestants and Catholics, and still no end is in sight. </p>

<TITLE>An "Islamic Domino Theory"</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 16:30CST-02/17/96
<P>

<center><H2>The "Islamic Domino Theory"</H2></center>
<center>By Clark Staten, ERRI Analyst</center>
<P>
Chicago, IL, February 17, 1996 -- In the early to mid 1960's,
American political scientists and military strategists began to
develop a theory in regard to Southeast Asia. This theorem
involved Chinese and Russian envelopment of the region, by
advancing from one country to the next and introducing a
Marxist/Leninist form of government to poor and otherwise
politically unsophisticated people.
<P> 

The culmination of this ideological conflict took place in Viet 
Nam, where the North Vietnamese, with the support of both the
U.S.S.R. and China, fought, first the French and then the United States, to a
complete stand-still.  Shortly thereafter, Laos, Cambodia,
Thailand, and a number of other countries were swallowed up in a
sphere of Communist influence.  The theory was termed "the
Domino theory" by U.S. State Department officials, as countries
fell like a row of dominos, pushed by a communist insurgency.
<P>  

In the late 70's and early 80's, another campaign of world
domination, similar in some ways and very different in many
others, began to become apparent to some observers. This
struggle continues today and is occurring in a number of
regions, including Southeast Asia, Southwest Asia, and parts of
Europe. This new "revolution" is not born of the Communists of
the former Soviet Union, nor of the "People's Revolutionary
Republic".
<P>  

It is even more ancient and insidious than the
Communist movement, and has its underpinnings in one of the
world's leading religions. Like the early Communist movement, it
is said to involve the use of insurgency, propaganda, and
misinformation. Recent religious, political, and military
problems in Egypt, Bahrain, Qatar, Turkey, Israel, the
Philippines, Malaysia, Sudan, Algeria, Somalia, Bosnia and any 
number of other places, points to the reality of the onslaught 
of this movement. But, more powerful than any political or 
ideological system, this movement promises "heaven" as a reward 
for ones support and participation.
<P>

This newest "envelopment" began in modern times, with the fall
of the Shah of Iran in the late 70's.  It has been called the
"Islamic Revolution" and or just "Jihad" by observers and
followers alike. It involves an effort to spread fundamentalist
Islamic teachings and adherence to Moslem philosophy throughout
the world. That in and of itself, most analysts would agree, is
not something ominous or threatening.  It is a practice as old
as religion itself. Historically, most religions have attempted
to export their beliefs to other countries.  What is troubling,
according to both theological and political experts, is the
concept of allegedly using intimidation, violence, murder, and
terrorism to further religious goals.
<P>  

Thus, a reincarnation of an earlier theory, is being brought forth
by this author and called the "Islamic Domino theory".  A study
of recent history would suggest that there is evidence of an
orchestrated campaign underway to attain both religious and
political control of a number of countries on several
continents.  It would appear that these forces of potential
domination are "pushing rows of dominos" in several places
simultaneously.  The leading and most extreme portions of this
movement are undoubtedly founded in Iran. Other major components
and financial supporters exist in Syria, Pakistan, Israel,
Egypt, Iraq, Turkey, Lebanon, and parts of the former Soviet Union.
<P>

The facts of the past three decades can adequately demonstrate
that some Moslem extremist movements and groups, particularly of
the Shi'ite sect, have been actively engaged in the use of
shootings, bombings, assassinations, and other nefarious
activities, reputedly in support of their religious faith...but
more covertly, in furtherance of a subversion of greater land
masses.  Even though the Koran, the holy book of Islam,
prohibits the use of unprovoked violence; some extremist Mullahs
and Ayatollahs have interpreted other sections of it to justify
and condone barbarous acts in the name of the Islamic struggle
for further territory and greater autonomy.
<P>

Many parallels can be drawn between the communist insurgency of
the "cold war" years and the Islamic revolt of the "holy war" or
Jihad. Some would suggest that the only difference is a
metaphysical one, in that, the Islamic movement is founded in a
ancient religion rather than Leninist/Marxist ideology.  In
modern times many of the realizations and practical applications
of this attempted conversion process would appear to be all too
similar. 
<P> 

Were it not for this obvious geo-political component of the
current Iranian-sponsored Moslem movement and their demonstrated
desire for secular as well as religious control of affected
countries, many analysts say that they would not be so concerned
about the rise of Islamic Fundamentalism.  In other words, if
there were no desire or attempt by Iran and Iranian surrogates
to takeover political and physical control of other countries,
their spreading of a religious philosophy could probably be well
tolerated by the world community. Unfortunately, that does not
appear to be the case.
<P>

Although there is still much discussion and dissent among
foreign policy experts, political scientists, religious
scholars, and intelligence analysts, about the true intent of
Iran and the continuing spread of Islamic Fundamentalism, one
thing can be safely hypothesized.  Unless negotiations,
diplomacy, and reason triumph, or dramatic military intervention
occurs, it is all too likely that a raging beast of religious
fervor could engulf and conquer as many as a dozen nations in
the coming decade.
<P>

<TITLE>Poison Warfare Gases; Treatment</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H3>Poison Warfare (Nerve) Gases:</H3>
<P>


There are several types of nerve gases that are available to
terrorist/subversive operatives.  They may include:
<P>
<HR>
<H4>TABUN (GA)</H4>
<P>
Tabun is an organophosphate type compound that was developed
between WWI & II. It can be easily absorbed through the skin,
by means of inhalation, or ingestion.  The symptoms of the
poisoning are similar , regardless of the route of
introduction.  Upon inhalation, for instance, the symptoms
(in order of occurance) include;
<P>
<UL>
<LI> a. Runny nose
<LI> b. Bronchial secretions
<LI> c. Tightness in the chest
<LI> d. Dimming of vision
<LI> e. Pin-Point Pupils
<LI> f. Drooling
<LI> g. Excessive perspiration
<LI> h. Nausea, Vomiting
<LI> i. involuntary defecation, urination
<LI> j. muscle tremors, convulsions
<LI> k. Coma
<LI> l. Death
</UL>
<P>
Primary treatment for Tabun and several other nerve
agents is Atropine Sulfate.  It is commonly carried in auto-
injectors by military personnel in dosages of 1-2 mgs.
However, in many cases, massive doses may be necessary to
reverse the effects of the anticholinesterase agents.
Frequently, 20-40 mgs. of atropine may be necessary.
<P>

The second drug that is used in the treatment of "nerve gas"
poisoning is Pralidoxime chloride (3-PAMC1).  It is used to
reactivate the the acetylcholinestrase that is bound by the
nerve agent.  3-PAMC1 is not as effective against Soman (GD).
The dosage for 3-PAMC1 is normally 600mg per injection and
that it may have to be given repeatedly.  Therapeutic levels
may also include 1 or more grams of Pralidoxime to be given
by intervenous administration over an eight hour period.
<P>
<HR>

<H4>Sarin (GB)</H4>
<P>
Also a nerve agent in the organophosphate family.  Has
similar symptoms and is generally "non-persistent" (as is
Tabun); is dispersed in an droplet or mist form. GB is also a
cholinesterase inhibitor, as are all of the "G" agents.
It is treated in a similar manner as Tabun with Atropine and
3-PAMC1.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>Soman (GD)</H4>
<P>
Again; a compound of the organophosphate family, but more
difficult to treat than the other "G" agents.  Pralidoxime
does not work as well with GD, due to the fact that it's
reactivation of acetylcholinesterase must be accomplished
within moments of exposure to be at all effective. Normally
dispersed like the other "G" agents.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>(VX)</H4>
<P>

VX is an organophosphate-like compound, but comes in an oily
liquid form that is persistent for weeks or longer in the
environment.  It is commonly used to deny access to a given
area and thus stop or slow an enemy ground advance. It can be
treated by the same methods that are used for the "G" agents,
but must be decontaminated in a different manner than the
other agents; alcohol, ether, or acetate can be used to wash
the oily liquid from the skin.
<P>
<HR>


<H3>OTHER AGENTS AND INFORMATION OF CONCERN:</H3>
<BR>
<HR>


<H4>CYANIDES</H4>
<P>


<H4>(AC- Hydrogen cyanide HCN)
<BR>
(CK- Cyanogen chloride CNCL)</H4>

The cyanides can be delivered by artillery, rockets, bombs,
or released from upwind cannisters. The symptoms of cyanide
poisoning include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> a.Dryness and burning of the throat
<LI> b.Dyspnea, shortness of breath
<LI> c.Hyperpnea, rapid shallow breathing
<LI> d. Apnea, lack of breathing
<LI> e. Convulsion & coma
<LI> f. Cardiovascular collapse
</UL>
<P>   
These agents act by binding the iron (FE) component of the
cytochrome c oxidase system, which controls the cellular
respiration and exchange of oxygen. The treatment of this
agent includes the administration of oxygen and nitrates.
Standard military treatment includes administration of 10cc
of 3% solution of Sodium nitrate followed by sodium
thiosulfate (50cc of 25% solution) by intravenous.  Some
other medical authorities recommend the use of Amyal Nitrate
crushable ampules followed by the nitrates listed above.
<P>

Others recommend using Vitamin B12, EDTA, and/or hyperbaric
oxygen (High Compression oxygen chamber).  Due to the fact
that "field" conditions do not allow the use of such
extensive equipment, or inconsistent treatment methods; the
military method is recommended for the near future.
<P>
<HR>


<H3>DECONTAMINATION:</H3>
<P>


Generally, protected ( i.e. Gloves, Respirators/SCBA, non-
permeable clothing) medical and rescue personnel must wash
the victim with soap and water at the scene.  Wash water
should be properly disposed of in drums or containers that
can be properly destroyed.  Victims of VX and other non-
soluble agents should be cleaned with the alcohol and/or the
agents described above.  This must be accomplished as soon as
possible, and the specific antidotes listed above then be
administered.  "Dirty" patients should not be transported to
the hospital.
<P>
(Ed. Note/Disclaimer: This article contains commonly accepted practices in the treatment of those exposed to toxic gases. It should be understood that these recommendations may not be in keeping with local medical practice or EMS standing medical protocals. All practitioners should follow those guidelines that are deemed acceptable within the system that they work. If you have questions, refer to your local system policy.)
<P>
<HR>
<H3>CONCLUSIONS</H3>
<P>
Nerve agents are thought to be in the stockpiles of several extremist nations and 
terrorist organizations, including Iran, Iraq, Libya, Lebanon, and Syria.  
Tthey are also said to have access to a "Mustard Gas" type agent, which can cause extensive skin and respiratory system burns.  Reportedly, Iraq used "Mustard"
type agents in past attacks on the Kurdish tribemen in their
own country.  The consequences of letting the "Chemical Genie
out of the bottle" have been demonstrated by the chemical release in the Tokyo subway system.  Numerous terrorists have vowed to use whatever means are available to them to strike out against the United States or any of her allies; we must be prepared.

<TITLE>The Future of Terrorism; After the USSR</TITLE>

<center><H2> THE FUTURE OF TERRORISM IN THE 90'S</H2></center>
                            <center><B>By Clark Staten</B></center>
<P>

Chicago,IL.   Strangely, the disintegration of the Soviet
Bloc may have a detrimental affect on the future of the
United States.  That statement may seem contradictory on its
face, but, it is also true.  The uninitiated reader may ask,
"How can the breakup of our greatest enemy be cause for
fear"?
<P>

The ironic answer to this question is as complex and
bewildering as the nature of the threat.  Put simply though,
the loss of control by the Soviet Union, of it's surrogates
in the Third World, could be cause for alarm. In fact, in
recent years, the limited number of terrorist acts can
probably be contributed, at least in part, to the
conservative influence of the Soviets. As the Soviets moved
toward reform and peristroka, no longer suited their image to
be seen as enthusiastic supporters of worldwide terrorism.
<P>

During their internal struggle for autonomy and reform,
experts within the intelligence community suggest that the
Soviets may have discouraged or even forbidden some terrorist
acts. Intercepted materials and radio transmissions would
suggest that the Soviets actually withheld monetary and
logistical support to terrorist factions during the
Iraq/Kuwait war.  At the same time, it was noted that they
were attempting to resolve the conflict though negotiations.
<P>

Today's turbulence in the Soviet Union has, in fact, fostered
terrorism within their own country. This development was
practically unheard of within recent years, largely due to
the efficiency of the Soviet Secret Police (KGB).  However,
at least two recent skyjackings and multiple attacks on
military garrisons throughout the Soviet Republics would
suggest that the intelligence community within the Soviet
Union is in disarray.
<P> 
This inability to monitor and control both internal and external 
dissidents and insurgent operatives demonstrates that they 
may not be able to control terrorist events as in the past. 
Therefore, the independance and reform in the Soviet Union has, 
in effect, unleashed their former substitutes and left them feeling 
abandoned and angry.
<P>
Secondary in importance, and also heavy with irony, is the
fact that the Allied Coalition victory in the Middle-East may
also contributed to the future spector of terrorism.  While
it was clear that America and her allies won a clear military
victory over Saddam Hussein and his minions, the effort
surely did not limit the capability of Hussein or his allies
to carry out Terrorist activities.
<P>
In reality, our victory has left several factions of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and other splinter
groups with even less to lose than before.  The PLO's
decision to side with Hussein during the Middle-East
conflict, has severely damaged their credibility as peaceful
negotiators for the Palestinian cause.  The inverse is
probably true. The valued opinions of several moderate Arab
countries have seemingly decreased, for the PLO, with their
support for the unprovoked attack on Kuwait.
<P>
This further divergence with the Islamic and Arab community
serves to isolate and harden the resolve of the "hard-core"
revolutionary organizations that were previously somewhat
moderated and controlled by the influence of money and
sanctuary.  Again, this situation contributes to the
possibility that they will strike out in desperation and
anger at not being able to fulfill their objectives.
<P>
Thirdly, consideration must be given to the regime' of Saddam
Hussein and his tremendous desire and propensity for revenge.
During the Persian Gulf War, he was reported to have gathered
any number of internationally known terrorists and provided
them with money and weapons, in order to open the "third
front of Terrorism".  Fortunately, for the Allies, his
command and control mechanisms were often so badly damaged
that he was unable to mount a coordinated terrorist campaign
against the Kuwaiti supporters.
<P>
Had Hussein been further able to threaten and exploit the
fear of the populations of the democracies and commit greater
atrocities in Europe and the Americas, he hoped that
political pressures would have been brought to bear against
the Allies to quit the war effort even sooner.  Hussein's
revenge motive is undoubtedly a tangible factor to be
considered for the future.
<P>
Fourth, and most recently in the news, is the probablity of
"Narco-Terrorism".  As President Bush's war on drugs
continues and continued pressure is put on the Mendellin Drug
cartel and others, the chance of a terrorist attack against
America or her leaders increases.  The arrest and
extradition to the United States, of several reputed "Drug
Lords",(including General Manual Noriega), has reportedly
caused threats to made against American leaders.
<P>  
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and unnamed military
officials have indicated that classified intelligence reports
describe large sums of money being offered to kill drug
enforcement personnel and even larger amounts to paid for the
deaths of elected U.S. representatives.  As greater U.S.
resources and urgency are given to the problem, the greater
the odds of retaliation by the drug dealers.
<P>
The combination of these factors and the ready availability
of several "Terror Masters", who find themselves unemployed
and without a "homeland" should warn us that the likelihood
of major insurgent attack grows by the day.   Terrorist
organizations live and grow by the publicity that they
receive.  Without a regular spectacular act of barbarism or
the impression that they can project fear, they lose converts
and financial support from those countries that are still
engaged in the "revolutionary struggle".
<P>
People and organizations like Abu Nidal, Abul Abbas, Al-
Fatah, PFLP, Irish Republican Army, the Japanese Red Army
Faction, Peru's "Shining Path", Columbian M-19 organization,
Cuba & Castro, the Basque Separatists and a multitude of
lessor known terrorist planners are currently looking for
work.  It is likely that Hussein, the Mendellin Cartel,
Mohammar Qadaffi or some other disgruntled would-be despot
will undoubtedly provide them with the arms and money to
attack again.
<P>
Last and worthy of mention is the emergence of Islamic extremist
groups, who are likely to commit acts of violence against Israel
and her Western allies.  Support by Iran and Syria has fostered the
training and equipping of large numbers of fundamentalist "faithful"
who can be expect to do anything, including commit suicide in the 
furtherance of their percieved goals.  Their vision of "jihad" and 
death to the "decadent West" should be viewed with concern.
<P> 
<H4>CONCLUSIONS</H4>
Unfortunately, the eventuality of "soft" or "limited warfare"
grows with the prospects for the larger peace between the
superpowers.  While we probably will not have to be so
concerned with the possibility of a Global Thermonuclear War,
the contingency of "brushfire" conflicts in the Middle-East,
Central and South America, Turkey, Northern Ireland, Spain,
India, Pakistan, The Phillipines, and even the United States
are increased.
<P>

The likelihood of the use of chemical or biological weapons
also appears to have increased with the discovery of them in
Iraq and other "revolutionary" countries. Confirmed reports
go back to 1980 and a raid on a safe-house in France, where
strains of Botulism and literature describing the use of
biological weapons were found.  In 1984, a Cuban defector
described the presence on that island of stocks of toxic
agents "for use against an invasion by America".
<P>

The use by Iraq of chemical and biological weapons in it's
long running war against Iran is almost common knowledge.
Terrorists seem most attracted to the use of these weapons
due to the the possible widespread affect of the toxins and
the fear that they can breed. Finally, most terrorists know
that the civilian populace has little defense against
biological or chemical agents.  The use of these weapons of
horror will potentially take terrorism in the 90's to new
heights of atrocity.
<P>
American and Allied Intelligence and Anti-Terrorist
organizations have done an outstanding job of preventing or
thwarting insurgent operations within our borders, but the
seemingly peaceful future of this decade may also be cause
for alarm.  America can not let down her vigilance or
preparedness in light of the rapid changes in Eastern Europe
or our victory in the Middle-East.
<P>

In light of this situation, we need to be prepared to fight a
different war....
<P>

"This is a new kind of war, new in it's intensity, ancient in
it's origin...war by guerillas, subversives, insurgents,
assassins; war by ambush instead of combat, by infiltration
instead of aggression, seeking victory by exhausting the
enemy insted of engaging him". "It requires....in those
situations where we encounter it...a new kind of stategy, a
wholly different kind of force, and therefore, a new and
wholly different kind of awareness and training."
<P>

John F. Kennedy, President of the United States
West Point, New York - June, 1962
<P>

Truer words were never spoken on the subject of terrorism.
Not in 1962, nor today.  America must be prepared for the
challenges of terrorism in the coming decade.

<font size=5><strong>F.A.A. DOWNPLAYS FORMER I.G.'s REPORT ON AIRPORT 
SECURITY FLAWS; REPORT SUPRESSED??</strong></font><br>
By Jim Fay NYC/NJ Metro Correspondent<br>
<br>
NEW YORK CITY (ENN) - The FAA, and it's parent agency, the U.S. Department of Transportation, attempted 
to keep from public scrutiny a report prepared by the department's Inspector General which showed that the security 
screenings at a number of airports in the United States were flawed and resulted in agents accessing planes with 
phoney bombs.<br>
<br>
In the Saturday, July 27th, issue of the New York Times, reporter Pam Belluck outlines how, according to the 
report, undercover agents of the Inspector General's Office of the Department of Transportation, conducted the 
investigation of four airports in the U.S. this year. These same four airports were investigated by the I.G. in 1993 and 
all four had lapses of security then. In the 1993 investigation, agents were able to pass the screening points at all four 
airports, and in 75 percent of the attempts, were able to actually board planes with the &quot;bombs&quot; in their carry-on 
luggage, as well as accessing ramp-side areas, where the planes are parked.<br>
<br>
According to the Times story, the follow-up investigation in 1996 still showed that agents had accesses to &quot;sterile 
areas&quot; (those areas beyond the terminal screening points where X-ray machines are), 40 percent of the time. While 
this was somewhat of an improvement, the Transportation Department apparently still felt uncomfortable with the 
potential of four out of every ten passengers carrying contraband.<br>
<br>
The report was prepared by Inspector General Mary Schiavo, who was an outspoken critic of FAA procedures 
during recent Congressional hearings after the fatal ValueJet crash in Florida. Schiavo recently resigned her position 
as I.G. in order to write a book of her experiences and lecture.<br>
<br>
When Schiavo sent the critical 1996 report to agency bosses, they decided that it would not be released 
immediately, fearing it would compromise &quot;national security,&quot; and that releasing the report at that time would possibly 
encourage a terroristic attempt at the weak points during the then-upcoming Olympic festivities in Atlanta. The Times 
quoted Schiavo for this article, and she stated that she did not agree with this situation of withholding the report, 
fearing that any attempt on an airport would look significantly bad if anything was to happened with the report 
unreleased.<br>
<br>
The Times story then goes on to report that the I.G. and the agencies came up with a compromise, and that the 
unedited report would be released only to Congress and to Transportation and FAA officials, and that an edited 
version would be made public only through Freedom of Information Act requests. It was felt that by the time that 
reporters requesting the report through the Freedom of Information Act received and published the report, the 
Olympic Games would be over.<br>
<br>
Ms. Schiavo quit on July 8th. The next day, the Deputy Inspector General, Mario Lauro, sent a memo to 
Department of Transportation Secretary Fedrico Pena, stating that the report would not be released at all for security 
reasons. When questioned by the Times, a Department of Transportation spokesman stated that the issue to release 
the report was only finalized on the day after Ms. Schiavo left office.<br>
<br>
Schiavo's predictions may have come to fruition as a result of the fatal TWA Flight 800 that was downed over the 
Atlantic Ocean after leaving John F. Kennedy International Airport last week. Agencies handling the investigation in 
New York are seriously looking at the possibility of an explosive device was taken or placed on board the 747, 
possibly at JFK. Official have also not ruled out a possible missile attack on the plane, and the outside chance of 
mechanical failure of one or more components of the plane. Security at Kennedy has also been questioned since the 
fatal Flight 800 as a result of two members of the French media documenting their accesses to the sterile area 
without being stopped or challenged by airline security personnel.<br>

<H3>THE HIDDEN DANGER OF CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING</H3>
<BR>
By C. Staten, EMT-P
<BR>

Chicago, IL.  Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a odorless, colorless,
tasteless, and insidious gas that takes hundreds of lives
each year.  The signs and symptoms of carbon monoxide
poisoning may include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>1. Headache
<LI>2. Dizziness
<LI>3. Irritability
<LI>4. Confusion/Memory loss
<LI>5. Disorientation
<LI>6. Nausea and vomiting
<LI>7. Abnormal reflexes
<LI>8. Difficulty in coordinating 
<LI>9. Difficulty in breathing
<LI>10. Chest Pain
<LI>11. Cerebral Edema
<LI>12. Convulsions/Seizures
<LI>13. Coma
<LI>14. Death
</UL>
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H4>SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS</H4>
<BR>

Commonly, lower-level carbon monoxide patients describe their
symptoms as those of a "flu-type" syndrome.  They frequently
complain of malaise (tiredness), headache, visual
disturbances, "runny nose", and may not associate or
recognize the symptoms as being the result of CO poisoning.
A one month retroactive study of patients reporting to a
hospital emergency room with "flu-like" symptoms revealed
that almost one quarter of them (23.6%) had a CO level
greater than 10% (a diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning is
generally confirmed by a CO level greater than 10%).
<P>

Often, several members of the same family or those in a given
building will complain of the same symptoms.  Children are
thought to be more susceptible to carbon monoxide poisoning
than adults.  Some people may not suspect that CO poisoning
is occurring until major symptoms appear.  Carbon Monoxide
poisoning can mimic gastroenteritis (nausea and vomiting).
Other manifestations may cause the appearance of what may
appear to be a neurological or psychiatric disorder. High
risk groups include infants, the elderly, pregnant women, and
anyone with a previous history of cardiac insufficiency or
chronic obstructive lung disease.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H4>MEDICAL CONSEQUENCES</H4>
<BR>
Carbon monoxide acts to cause tissue hypoxia by displacing
oxygen with carboxyhemoglobin.  This inhibits the
transference of oxygen to the organs.  Particularly affected
are the heart, central nervous system and brain. The heart
responds to hypoxia from CO poisoning by beating rapidly,
irregularly, and with a decrease in blood pressure.  Cardiac
arrhythmia's (irregularities) frequently occur in the face of
CO, causing heart blocks and ventricular ectopic beats
(P.V.C.- Premature Ventricular Contraction).  This cardiac
irregularity may lead to heart attack and even death.
<P>

Cerebral edema (swelling of the brain) is also a common
result of severe carbon monoxide poisoning.  This life
threatening condition entails the destruction of brain cells
by compressing them into themselves within the cranial
compartment.  Drugs that are normally used for the treatment
of cerebral edema, like Dexamethasone and Mannitol, do not
seem to be of assistance in the treatment of CO induced
cerebral edema.  Studies have shown that cerebral edema
caused by CO poisoning can cause delayed neurological
problems that involve the "higher" or cognitive functions,
and may cause a Parkinsonian-like brain syndrome.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H4>CAUSATIVE FACTORS</H4>
<BR>
Frequently, carbon monoxide is produced by the incomplete
combustion of wood or hydrocarbon products. It will be
produced as a byproduct of the burning of almost anything.
Many carbon monoxide victims are stricken by gases that are
insufficiently vented by heating equipment or furnaces.
Several incidents occur each year in homes with fireplaces or
wood-burning stoves/heaters.
<P>

Other incidents have been reported in apartments where gas
stoves are being used for heat.  In at least one case, carbon
monoxide poisoning was caused by the use of a charcoal grill
within an apartment's bathtub. More than fifty percent (50%)
of all carbon monoxide incidents occur within homes. Twenty
percent (20%) of all incidents occur in businesses of various
types.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H4>TREATMENT</H4>
<BR>
One of the most important considerations in the treatment of
Carbon Monoxide exposure patients is the immediate
recognition of the problem.  Once detected or suspected, the
following action can be taken be taken by anyone;
<P>

         1. Move the victim(s) to fresh air
<P>
         2. Activate the Fire/Emergency Medical Service System, if victim(s) are experiencing any                symptoms
<P>
         3. Monitor for respiratory problems
<P>
         4. Ventilate the affected area
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>

Upon arrival, it is recommended that Basic Life Support (BLS)
(e.g. EMT) personnel should;
<P>

         1. Evaluate for respiratory tract irritation,
             bronchitis, or pneumonitis.
<P>
         2. Administer humidified 100% oxygen by tight-
             fitting face mask. Assist ventilations as needed
<P>
         3. Monitor Vital Signs
<P>
         4. Monitor level of consciousness
<P>
         5. Consider early transport to a Hyperbaric Oxygen
             Chamber for severely poisoned patients
<P>
         5. Place the patient in a position of comfort and
              keep them warm
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>

It is recommended that Advanced Life Support (A.L.S.) (e.g.
Paramedic) personnel should;
<P>

         1. Further evaluate the respiratory tract for
             dysfunction or possible compromise - intubate and
             assist ventilation as needed
<P>
         2. Draw a blood sample for Carboxyhemoglobin
             analysis
<P>
         3. Provide 100% humidified oxygen, do not delay
             administration of oxygen while performing blood
             sampling
<P>
         4. Administer normal saline or other crystalline
             parental fluids at 2/3 to 3/4 of normal
             maintenance rates
<P>
         5. Prepare for the possibility of generalized
            seizures in severe cases. Give diazepam (Valium)
             in 2-10 mg. doses (as needed) to terminate
             and control seizure activity
<P>
         6. Perform electrocardiogram monitoring of the
             patient, be especially aware of ventricular
             ectopic beats and heart blocks. EKG changes seen
             most commonly in CO patients are ST segment
             depression, T-wave abnormalities, atrial
             fibrillation, and PVCs.
<P>
         7. Any patient found unconscious, seizing, or with
             EKG changes and with an associated history should
             be treated as a severe carbon monoxide poisoning
             until proven otherwise
<P>
         8. Consider direct transport to a Hyperbaric Oxygen
             therapy facility, with Oxygen being administered
             enroute, for severely poisoned patients
<P>
         9. If the patient's history suggests any possibility
             of CO Poisoning, treat him/her as though they
             were exposed
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>

(Author's note: EMTs and Paramedics participating in an
EMS system should follow those protocols as established by
their local system policy.  These treatment guidelines
reflect commonly accepted practices in prehospital emergency
medical care, which may not meet local requirements.)
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H4>PREVENTION AND CONCLUSIONS</H4>
<BR>


Many lives could be saved and much disability prevented if
citizens could learn to recognize and prevent the dangers of
carbon monoxide poisoning.  Preventive efforts such as
checking furnace flues, chimneys, and vents could help to
alleviate the hazard.  The use of good common sense in not
using open flames, ovens and other appliances not intended
for heating, could reduce the number of carbon monoxide
related incidents.  It is also recommended that homeowners
have their complete heating systems checked before every
heating season.
<P>

Only by being aware of the peril, and understanding the
nature of the hazard, can we help to prevent unnecessary
exposures to deadly carbon monoxide.  By understanding the
mechanism of injury, we can be better prepared to treat the
effects of this toxic product.  In this way, it is expected
that the number of people who succumb to carbon monoxide's
"deadly clutches" can be reduced.

<H3>The Personal History of Mohmmar Qadaffi </H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/qaddafi.gif" align=right>
<P>
The role of Col. Mohmmar Qadaffi in numerous murderous attacks and in 
the training of several transnational terror organizations can not be 
easily contradicted.  Reportedly, Qaddafi is to have been the financier of 
the "Black September Movement" which perpetrated the 1972 Munich Olympic 
massacre, was responsible for the direct control of the bombing of a 
German discotheque that wounded more than eighty U.S. Servicemen in 1988, 
and is said to have paid "Carlos-the Jackal" to kidnap and release several 
of the Saudi Arabian and Iranian oil ministers when it fit his purposes to 
do so. 
<P> 

Col. Qadaffi's statements to the press should give the reader a 
clear understanding of his attitude toward America and the Western 
Democracies.  He has been loosely quoted, on several occasions, as saying 
that "the streets of America will run red with blood" and "we consider 
ourselves at a state of war due to the provocations of the U.S. Sixth Fleet 
and the continued actions of American politicians."
<P>

Although Qadaffi has been strangely silent since the  U.S. F-111 raid on
his compound and several key military targets, intelligence reports have
verified his as having provided financial and logistical support for
continued terror campaigns against America and her Allies.  Several recent
civilian airline bombings have all of the earmarks of Libyan involvement.
Many mideast experts predict Qaddafi's major involvement in future attacks
against the United States .  Intelligence analysts point to the disclosure
of an identified pharmaceutical plant located in a residential neighborhood,
that in actuality may be a chemical munitions factory.  Although denied by
Qadaffi, this plant is believed to have the capability to produce nerve gases,
which will add a new and most fearsome threat to the free world.
<P>

Qadaffi's history is very much like that of Saddam Hussein of Iraq.  He was
born of Bedouin farmers and tribesmen in the desert.  He was reared with the
tradition of fighting "Imperialism", as his grandfather was killed by an
Italian colonist in 1911.  He spent his youth learning of the exploitation of
his people by the "foreigners".  He was born in 1942, and like Hussein, the
exact date is unknown.  He was a Berber tribesman, during the middle of
W.W.II, near the province capitol of Sebha.
<P>


The war also had a profound affect on Qadaffi.  The "yoke" of Italian
domination was thrown off with the help of the British Army and Libyan King
Idris' men.  However, in the view of the Bedouin tribesmen, all Europeans
were alike and the Libyans soon resented the British as well.   In 1949,
the country was granted independence by the newly formed United Nations.
However, Idris al-Mahdi as-Sanssi proclaimed himself King Idris I of Libya.

<P>
In 1956, the King decided that he would split from the kindness and graces
of the British empire; he joined the newly formed Arab League.  In 1959, a
major discovery changed Libya as it had other countries in the region.
Oil was discovered and it allowed total independence from the West.
The "winds of change" were occurring throughout the Arab world, largely due
to the discovery of the "black gold".  Qadaffi began to develop as a man and
as an Arab.  He was profoundly affected by Gamel Abdel Nassar.
<P>
Nassar was one of the first to expose the idea of pan-Islamic world domination.
It was something that Qadaffi believed in completely.  That it was his destiny
to lead the Arab world and that his belief in Moslem teachings would lead he
and Libya to the forefront of the Arab world.  Although  sometimes less
than devout, Qaddafi's opinion that anything is justifiable in the name of
Islamic revolution has led him to his current beliefs.
<P>  

At the age of sixteen (16), he began the revolutionary cell that would eventually lead he and his followers to the leadership of Libya.   His childhood friend and he would often listen to Radio Cairo and plan the "coup" that would lead to the
destruction of the monarchy of Kink Idris.  He and his friends formed other
cells and continued to protest against the "Zionists" of Israel.  They plotted
and planned and planned and plotted.  For several years, Qadaffi and his
small group of friends dreamed that they would overthrow the King.
<P>
In 1959, he attended the University of Libya and began to read the history and
political science of Marxist thought.  Although impressed, he reportedly
rejected communism as being impure in the Islamic philosophical thought .
Shortly thereafter, in 1964, he graduated from the University with a diploma
from the Faculty of Law and joined the Military Academy in Benghazi.
<P>  

Even though he was sure that he had been identified as a "trouble-maker" in the University, he grew and prospered in the Academy and in 1965 graduated. He was given a commission in the Libyan Army.  The next year he was sent for advanced training in England and studied Armor Warfare.  Even though he hated the British almost as much as the Italians of his youth, he could learn about the science of war from the British.
<P>
In 1969, he was promoted and given the job as Adjutant of the Signal Corps.
It was another step closer to his desire to launch a "coup" against the King.
He continued to foster his group of conspirators and cells of revolutionaries,
even while serving in the King's Army.  On September 1, 1969, he pre-empted
a group of older Army officers that were said to be planning a "coup" of their
own and he and his young friends seized power.  The senior officers were
flabbergasted, but Qadaffi had planned this movement for years.  He and his
followers occupied the Royal Palace, took over the government offices, and
controlled the radio, T.V., and newspapers.  In very short order, they
controlled the country of Libya.  Qadaffi was only twenty-seven years old.
<P>

Much of the rest of the story involves Qaddafi's continued desire to be 
another "Nassar" and to lead the Middle-East in a Pan-Islamic revolution.  
A complex and very proud man, he appears to be able to use what ever means 
are at his disposal to accomplish his goals. He has shown a propensity to 
commit terrorism if it fits his needs.  Today, he is more focused on being a financial and logistical supporter of Islamic and pro-Palestinian groups, but can still be expected to be extremely dangerous.
<P>
Qaddafi, today, is an elusive and mercurial personage who "meddles" in Middle-east and African affairs, almost at will. He is reported to never sleep in the same place two days in a row, ever since the American air-raid on his camp, that allegedly killed at least one relative. Trusting almost no one, he reportedly has a person guard detail that is sworn to die on his behalf.
<P>
The most dangerous thing about Qaddafi is his unpredictability. Some allege that he may be mentally unbalanced, while others say he is "crazy like a fox." Few can predict his next action, but most are certain of his almost total control of Libya, and that he is firmly entrenched with control of the army and political apparatus there.
<P>
It is believed that Qaddafi still is a supporter of Islamic and pro-Palestinian causes, although he frequently engages in more rhetoric than action in recent times. His unpredictability, however, could lead him to take whatever action he deems necessary to remain in power and maintain his position in the Arab world.

<P>
                                                   
    ``For the foreseeable future, terrorism, both domestic and 
international, will continue to be a major concern to U.S. 
Government and law enforcement agencies.'' (1)  Concern over 
terrorism is consistently voiced by officers attending the FBI 
National Academy in Quantico, Virginia.  Some officers have the 
impression that in a terrorist hostage incident, the crisis 
management approach would (or should) be substantially different 
from that in a criminal hostage incident.  This is not the case.
<P>  

     Since the mid-1970s, the FBI has grouped hostage taking 
incidents into four broad categories--the terrorist, the prison 
situation, the criminal, and the mentally disturbed.  State and 
local law enforcement officers at the FBI Academy have indicated 
that these four major categories are still commonly used by law 
enforcement agencies. (2)  Further, there is also the consensus 
that the current set of negotiation strategies and tactics 
available to law enforcement provides viable alternatives from 
which to choose, whatever the motivation for the taking of 
hostages. (3)
<P>                                                        

     Unfortunately, much of what is believed about terrorist 
conduct and behavior is derived from the media and the 
entertainment industry.  Both the general population and the law 
enforcement community have come to accept the terrorist 
stereotype as accurately depicting personality traits, 
dedication, sophistication, commitment, and modus operandi.
<P>       

     All too often, the dramatic events surrounding a terrorist 
incident are misrepresented in fictional accounts or in media
efforts aimed at recreating actual situations that have
occurred.  Further, a brief news flash, broadcasted during an
ongoing terrorist siege, does not draw an accurate picture of a
terrorist's total range of conduct and personality traits.
Therefore, many of the expressed ideas regarding terrorists
appear to be based upon incorrect perceptions.

<H3>The Terrorist Hostage Taker</H3>
                                                                                                                    
     The FBI defines terrorism as the unlawful use of force or 
violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a
government, civilian population, or any segment thereof, in
furtherance of political or social goals. (4)  One major
difficulty in discussing the terrorist hostage taker is that the
words ``terrorist'' and ``terrorism'' have been used by the
media to such an extent that they are virtually useless as valid
descriptive terms.  They have become political terms with almost
as many definitions as speakers.
<P>
                     
     From the viewpoint of the crisis manager (i.e., the on-scene 
commander), does it help to distinguish a hostage taking as a 
terrorist act, separate from a criminal act?  No, it does not. 
The label given the behavior does not change the act.  In fact, 
the FBI now refers to such acts as ``terrorist crimes'' to 
underscore the fact that the motivation for the behavior does not 
change the criminality of such behavior.  The emphasis here is 
not meant to imply a lesser risk but to stress that the act is, 
first and foremost, a violent crime in progress, regardless of 
the stated motivation of the hostage taker. 
<P>                      

     Too often, those who are quick to point out that an act is a 
``terrorist incident'' (or any other kind, for that matter) 
mistakenly confuse the labeling with understanding.  In this 
case, the label is one that is so subjective that it is 
meaningless.  To describe an incident as only a ``terrorist'' 
event implies that all such events are similar.  Even additional 
adjectives, such as ``Palestinian'' terrorists, fail to identify, 
for example, significant differences in motives, methods, and 
goals of the various Palestinian factions, and of course, 
individual differences among the members themselves.
<P>              

     The use of a label is helpful only if the term is associated 
with essential elements that differentiate one set of behaviors 
from another.  Perhaps a more-descriptive term would be ``planned 
political/ religious'' hostage taking, since this term does not 
have the emotional overtones currently attached to the word 
``terrorist.'' Such a term avoids the automatic, and potentially 
misleading, assumptions made when the word ``terrorist'' is 
used. 
<P>                                                            

     The essential question is:  In confronting such an incident, 
will law enforcement agencies employ crisis management techniques 
that have been used successfully in a wide variety of 
hostage/barricade situations, or will those procedures be 
discarded as a result of faulty assumptions of how terrorists are 
supposed to behave?  Popular perceptions regarding terrorists 
would lead us to believe that they comprise a unique and specific 
personality type, and that terrorists are to be differentiated 
from the wide range of criminal and mentally disturbed 
personalities more frequently observed by law enforcement crisis 
managers.  To our knowledge, no scientific studies or analytical 
surveys exist that might serve to provide the basis for such a 
belief.  In order to examine the validity of current crisis 
management/negotiation techniques in confronting such incidents, 
it is essential to separate common myth from factual knowledge.

<H3>The Terrorist Mystique  </H3>
                                       
     In a planned political/religious incident, the subjects 
typically take hostages with the intent of getting publicity for 
their cause, and in some cases, to demand the release of 
imprisoned group members.  The fact that these are planned rather 
than spontaneous hostage takings indicates an increased 
likelihood of outside moral and/or operational support and 
creates a virtual certainty of extensive media coverage.
<P>          

     It appears that some political and religious extremists, 
particularly in the Middle East, have been successful in one very 
basic way--they have generated an extreme interest and concern 
for their activities among Western law enforcement officers. 
Former Chinese Communist party leader Mao Tse Tung maintained 
that terrorists should kill one to influence a thousand, and some 
radical Palestinian groups and extremist Lebanese Shia (e.g., 
Hizballah) seem to have accomplished this.
<P>                        

     However, in an article reviewing the terrorist psychosocial 
profile, Strentz concludes that terrorist groups (particularly 
those of Middle Eastern origin) have changed dramatically. (5)  
Contrasting left-wing Middle Eastern groups of the 1980s to those 
groups active a decade earlier, he found the more recent Middle 
Eastern groups to be poorly educated, unskilled, unemployed, 
illiterate, undisciplined, and ill-trained.  Does this mean that 
a planned political/religious hostage incident is not dangerous? 
Obviously not.  As Strentz notes, ``While one should never 
consciously underestimate adversaries, neither should one make 
them into supermen.  They are a force to be reckoned with, but 
must be viewed within the perspective of reality.'' (6)
<P>              

     Beginning in 1985, the FBI began investigating violations of 
the Hostage Taking Statute (Title 18, USC, Section 1203) and in 
1986, the Overseas Homicide/Attempted Homicide Statute (Title 18, 
USC, Section 2331).  These statutes provided for the first time 
the investigative vehicle through which FBI Special Agents could 
actively and aggressively respond to major terrorist incidents 
abroad wherein American citizens and property were the victims.
<P>   

     Starting with the June 14, 1985, hijacking of TWA Flight 
847, FBI Special Agents came into direct contact with a number of 
American victims.  Through detailed debriefings in pursuit of 
criminal prosecution, they collected a large volume of data 
concerning observed terrorist behavior.  Subsequent FBI victim 
debriefings and interviews of incarcerated terrorists involved in 
almost all of the planned political/religious incidents that  
have occurred during the second half of the 1980s expanded this 
database significantly. (7)
<P>                                          

     Understandably, the information-gathering process during 
this investigative activity was not designed as an orderly 
scientific examination that would provide the basis for 
personality assessments.  Rather, it aimed at developing 
evidentiary material.  Nonetheless, relying on these interviews, 
and on the experience and observation of FBI Agents, a clearer 
and more accurate picture of terrorist behavior can be drawn. 
This picture should serve to demystify the terrorist, to separate 
fact from fiction, and to support the position that decades of 
significant crisis management experience in a variety of  
circumstances has prepared American law enforcement to deal with 
a political/religious hostage incident. 
<P>                          

     It appears that the average terrorist is not as 
sophisticated as is commonly believed.  Terrorist interviews and 
victim debriefings show that most of the terrorists of the 1980s 
received very marginal training prior to deployment for an 
operation.  They were provided with only a minimal set of 
instructions as to how to conduct themselves during an operation. 
And while these terrorists may have been given a list of demands, 
for the most part, they were not trained to negotiate with 
authorities to achieve those demands. 
<P>                            

     In the course of the FBI's investigations, it became evident 
that these subjects are seldom prepared to deal with the unknown 
variables and unforeseen changes that routinely play an integral 
part in such sieges.  As a general rule (and more specifically 
applicable to Middle Eastern subjects), the terrorists are young 
males with little or no formal education.  These individuals come 
from deprived economic conditions and are without any significant 
positive work experience.  Contrary to popular notion, they do 
not employ sophisticated false documentation or disguises and 
most certainly do not fit the ``jet set'' multilingual, worldly, 
and savvy profile so often projected in popular literature.
<P>       

     For example, before going to Italy to initiate the October 
1985, Achille Lauro incident, the four young terrorists involved 
never traveled outside of Lebanon. Only one spoke a second 
language.  They received little training, were afforded only 
minimal instructions regarding their mission, and traveled on 
Scandinavian passports.  These terrorists stood out as four young 
Arab males aboard a ship populated almost entirely by elderly 
American and European tourists.  Once the operation began, they 
were confronted with unexpected responses from government 
officials.  This put them in a panic, since they failed to 
prepare contingency plans and could not adapt to the 
circumstances. 
<P>                                                   

     During the September 1986, hijacking of Pan Am Flight 73 in 
Karachi, the four terrorists who boarded the Boeing 747 
immediately rushed to the front of the aircraft looking for the 
cockpit in order to gain control of the crew.  They were 
dumbfounded when they discovered the cockpit was not located at 
the nose of the aircraft, as anticipated. They did not know that 
a Boeing 747's cockpit could only be reached by ascending a 
stairway located at the rear of the first class cabin.  This 
delay allowed the cockpit crew to escape.
<P>                         

     The April 1988, hijacking of Kuwaiti Flight 422 has been 
cited as demonstrating terrorist sophistication.  However, during 
this incident, when Beirut International Airport controllers 
denied landing clearance and blocked the runway, one terrorist 
demanded the pilot land in the ocean and taxi from there onto the 
land.  When the pilot argued that such a maneuver was impossible, 
the terrorist displayed the plastic safety card found in the back 
of all passenger seats and pointed to a drawing depicting a 
floating aircraft with passengers exiting and gathering on 
flotation equipment.  The terrorist firmly believed that this 
picture proved that the aircraft could land in the water, float, 
and then be driven onto land. 
<P>                                    

     Such incidents clearly do not support the popular belief 
that all terrorists undergo extensive and detailed aircraft 
hijack training at so-called ``desert terrorist academies.'' 
However, these examples should not suggest that 
political/religious hostage takers are harmless or incompetent. 
These subjects, like all hostage takers, should be treated with 
the utmost caution and respect.  These unsophisticated, 
uneducated, and ill-trained young men have killed many innocent 
victims.  Indeed, they probably should be considered even more 
dangerous because of their inadequate preparation and the acts of 
violence they tend to commit when their plans do not materialize.

<H3>The Law Enforcement Response </H3>
                                   
     One question frequently asked by police officers during 
training sessions is, ``How would you negotiate differently 
during a terrorist incident?''  Once the distinction is made 
between kidnapping (where the location of subject and victim are 
typically unknown) and hostage taking (where the subject and 
victim are contained within a police perimeter), officers are 
surprised (or perhaps disappointed) to hear the answer. 
Basically, negotiation strategies and tactics for terrorist  
incidents are identical to those that would be used during any  
hostage or barricade incident, regardless of the political or  
religious backgrounds of the subjects. 
<P>                           

     Simply stated, there are a finite number of strategies (and 
particular tactics to support each of those strategies) to choose 
from when negotiating with hostage takers that are contained and 
isolated.  The fact that a particular group of subjects puts 
forth political or religious reasons for taking hostages does not 
call into play a conceptually different set of strategies.  The 
negotiation team assesses the motives, demands, and behaviors of 
these hostage takers and makes recommendations to the on-scene 
commander as to the most appropriate strategy, drawn from the 
same set of possibilities as in any other hostage incident. 
<P>      

     However, the specific factors the team considers crucial to 
a particular incident, in all cases, depends on the
circumstances of the hostage taking.  For example, suppose a
person, claiming harassment and persecution by Federal
authorities who are stealing thoughts from his mind, took
hostages in a public office building and threatened to kill the
hostages unless the FBI stopped the persecution.  The
negotiation team would logically focus on the subject's medical
history, seeking records of past treatment for mental
disturbance, interviewing any mental health professional (MHP)
who may have treated the subject, and perhaps using the MHP as a
consultant. 
<P>

On the other hand, if a group of subjects took the
same hostages in the same building, but claimed to represent the
``People's Holy Liberation Forces,'' the team would certainly
value any information on the origins, composition, and any
previous actions by this group.  Knowledgeable sources on both
the political and religious dogma of the group, as well as
language experts, would be consulted and perhaps incorporated
into the negotiation team.  As one can see, the process of
assessment and recommendation remains the same, but clearly the
specific factors or issues that the team considers critical vary
with each incident.
<P>

     This is not to say that when a politically motivated 
incident occurs in the United States, there is not a greater 
amount of involvement by the higher levels of the U.S. 
Government, because there is.  In fact, ``The desire of
terrorists, both international and domestic, to focus media
attention on their causes by staging attacks at locations or
events of international interest has made it necessary for
governmental and law enforcement authorities to closely
coordinate their preparations for special events.'' (8)  That
involvement, however, does not call into play ``better,'' or
even different, negotiation strategies or principles.  The
negotiation recommendations are simply reviewed by a longer
chain of command.
<P>

     Even as long as 12 years ago, Stratton stated that social,
political or religious terrorists are the most difficult to deal
with because of their commitment. (9)  However, he also pointed out
that negotiation with political/religious hostage takers has
been successful.
<P>

     When hostage takers plan to be surrounded, as in the 
takeover of a public building, the probability of a prolonged 
incident increases and the risk to the hostages is considered to 
be very high.  However, notwithstanding the fact that such an 
incident was deliberately planned, the commitment of the hostage 
takers may not be a ``total'' commitment.  Post-incident review 
of the behavior of some of the hostage takers in planned 
political incidents indicates that there may be a difference in 
being ``willing'' to die for a cause and in ``wanting'' to die 
for a cause.  Once the subject has been away from a support 
system for days or weeks and emotional and physical exhaustion 
sets in, that person may be more willing to accept the rationale 
presented by the negotiator.
<P>                                      

     Political hostage takers have been negotiated with 
effectively by stressing that their point has been made, their 
demands have been heard, their cause has been ``aired'' to the 
world, and therefore, killing hostages would only serve to 
discredit them and their cause in the eyes of the public.  One 
author concludes that police negotiating tactics are most likely 
to succeed in planned, political/religious situations if the 
subjects are primarily interested in making a symbolic statement 
and obtaining publicity. (10)  These negotiation tactics have, in 
fact, been successful in resolving a number of planned 
political/religious hostage incidents in the United States and  
elsewhere. (11)  Even incidents that required a tactical 
resolution, such as the siege at the Iranian Embassy in London in 
April 1981, confirmed the appropriateness of these negotiating 
techniques.

<H3>Conclusion   </H3>
                                                   
     The dangers posed by planned political/religious hostage 
taking incidents should in no way be minimized.  Rather, law 
enforcement should respond to these incidents in a manner that 
is consistent with the crisis management procedures that have 
been developed and validated through thousands of 
hostage/barricade situations worldwide.
<P>                           

     If political/religious situations are accorded special  
status or are the cause for law enforcement to ignore effective  
crisis management strategies, then law enforcement falls victim 
to the ``terrorist mystique'' that has allowed terrorism to 
become a potent weapon in recent years.  However, if a planned 
political/religious incident is not treated as a special case, 
and  hostage takers instead are dealt with as any other high-risk 
subject would be, then law enforcement will be better able to 
employ the professional skills learned through the lessons of the 
past years.

For Immediate Release: 12/09/95-10:30CST
<H3>USAF OFFICER ARRESTED</H3>
<BR>
While everyone is searching for the UNABOMBER, the USAF was shocked when a high ranking officer was arrested in Montgomery, AL. Apparently, Maj Lester K. Haney was arrested by local police for placing the bomb in the US mail system to be delivered to his wife. USAF's Office of Special Investigation is also investigating this apparent "domestic" act of terrorism.
<P> 

Maj Haney was Chief of Intelligence at Maxwell AFB in the College of Aerospace Doctrine, Research and Education. He was relieved of his duties. The Major may well have received the training to build such a device while attending the USAF Special Operations Schools; Dynamics of International Terrorism Course in FL. At this site, training in weaponry and IED's is taught for special operations personnel and those from federal agencies and the military to be assigned to high threat areas.

<H2>Threats Against U.S. Continue to Increase </H2>
By: Paul Anderson,  ENN Metro Correspondent
<P>

Chicago, IL, April 22, 1996, (ENN)--Calls for violence against
the United States continue to come from members of several
international Islamic extremist movements. The latest threat
involves a message sent over the weekend to several news
agencies in Cairo, Egypt by a group calling themselves "The
Vanguards of Conquest". The message calls for "Muslims
everywhere to sacrifice lives and all that is valuable to strike
at American and Israeli targets."
<P>

This latest threat follows calls, late last week, by another
Egyptian based group called Al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, to "kidnap
Americans to exchange for Sheik Abdel-Rahmann."  Rahmann, the
convicted mastermind and spiritual advisor to a group that
intended to carry out bombings at a variety of vital locations
in New York City, is currently confined for an extended term in
a federal prison hospital in Springfield, MO.  On Saturday
(04/20), al Gamaa al-Islamiya clamed responsibility for last
Thursday's (04/18) bombing and assault that killed eighteen (18)
Greek tourists at hotel popular with Israeli visitors to Cairo.
<P>

On 04/16/96, Israeli embassies and commercial concerns tightened
security measures following published threats by the
Lebanon-based Hezbollah organization to "strike at vulnerable
Jewish targets outside of Israel's borders."  Unspecified
"upgraded" security measures were reported to have been
undertaken at that time in Britain, France, Hungary, Argentina
and several other countries.  Hezbollah has maintained and even
escalated its rhetoric since the 16th statement and as the
shelling and rocket attacks continue on the Israeli/Lebanese
border.
<P> 

Not to be left out in the battle of words, on 04/02/96, the
Islamic militant group Hamas also issued warnings of more
"wonderful martyrdom operations" against Israel. Hamas, along
with her smaller sister organization Islamic Jihad, has
continually promised additional suicide bombings.  Hamas and
Islamic Jihad are thought to be responsible for a recent spate
of bombings in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem that have left at least 59
dead and hundreds injured.
<P>

At least two times in the past three weeks, the Emergency
Response & Research Institute and it's computer-generated threat
analysis program have warned of the increased likelihood of an
attack on America, U.S. citizens, her embassies, military bases,
or commercial concerns overseas.  According to Clark
Staten--Executive Director of the Emergency Response & Research
Institute(ERRI), American citizens traveling overseas should
exercise extreme caution while in-transit or avoid traveling,
unless it is a necessity.
<P> 

"As the strife continues on the Israeli/Lebanese border,
additional Islamic extremist violence can be expected almost
anywhere in the world...Isreali synagogues, embassies, and
commercial concerns along with American businesses, diplomatic
missions, military sites, airports, and other places where
Israelis/Americans congregate can expect to be potential targets," Staten
said in an Monday morning teleconference briefing for a group of
emergency managers.
<P> 

Staten, who spent this past weekend in Atlanta, GA conferring
with emergency service officials on counter-terrorism measures
and conducting a disaster drill involving the bombing of a
domestic airliner, has been assisting in special operations
training of fire/police/ems and disaster officials and
responders for more than ten years.

<TITLE>Cali Cartel Threatens Columbian President</TITLE>

<BR>
<H3>TERRORIST GROUP VOWS TO KILL COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT...</H3>
<BR>
<P>
By Steve Macko
<P>
A prominent terrorist group in the South American country of Colombia has 
vowed to make Colombian President Ernesto Samper their main target because 
they claim that he and other top Colombian officials accepted millions of 
dollars from the infamous Cali cocaine cartel in the 1994 election campaign.
<P>

In a statement that was phoned-in to a news network in Colombia, the
terrorist group known as "Dignity for Colombia" said that they would
launch a new terrorist campaign to get Samper to quit the presidency
of this country that is considered to be the most violent in South America.
<P>

"Dignity for Colombia" is believed to responsible for the assassination
last week of a top Colombian politician and killing of dozens of other
people.  In regards to the charges of accepting money from the Cali
Cartel, the president of Colombia has repeatedly denied the charges.
<P>

Officials at the United States Drug Enforcement Administration and
U.S. observers at the Embassy in Colombia believe that the terrorist
group is made up of members of the Cali Cartel.  It is believed that
the cartel is angry at the Colombian president because he took cash
from the cartel to help win the 1994 election and has apparently
reneged on a backroom deal to go easy on the cartel.  In actuality,
and with the help of United States authorities, Samper has launched
an all-out war against the drug dealers.
<P>

Colombian military intelligence has another theory about "Dignity for
Colombia" -- they believe that the group is a possible front for the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) which is the largest
insurgent group in the country.
<P>

After the November 2nd assassination of the former Colombian ambassador
to the United States, Samper called for a general state of emergency
in the country to help prevent further terrorism, such as was scene
in the country during the mid-1980's and early 1990's when the Medillin
drug cartel killed thousands of people.
<P>

"Dignity for Colombia" in a statement to the Colombian news network
denounced the president and other governmental leaders for "enriching
themselves with money from the people from Cali and not having the guts
to acknowledge it."  In a transcript that was published in El Tiempo,
the largest daily newspaper in Colombia, the terrorist group said about
the Colombian president, "Your armored cars won't be worth anything when
a one-ton charge of dynamite explodes next to you.  That day you will
know what an animal you were for not resigning the presidency."  The
statement also indicated that the group has several "Kamikazes" who
are ready to give up their lives.
<P>

The personal security surrounding President Ernesto Samper has been
tightened in light of these threats.  Unless security police can
confirm that there are no places where snipers can shoot at Samper,
all public appearances by the president have been cancelled.  The 
Interior Minister of the country said that the objective of "Dignity
for Colombia" was "to cause chaos in Colombia and destabilize the
government."  Police authorities in Colombia suspect that the terrorist
group is responsible for the June 10th bombing in Medellin that killed
26 people.
<P>

The United States government has maintained pressure on President Samper
to continue his promises to pursue the drug cartels.  If Samper does
not make good of his promises, the United States has said that it would
indeed interpret that as an admission by Samper that his election
campaign was funded by the drug cartels.  In that case, the United States
would then impose severe economic sanctions on Colombia.  Experts say
that the Colombian president's position is tenuous at best.

<title>Carlos &quot;The Jackal&quot; Captured, Jailed in Paris</title>

<p>EmergencyNet News Service<br>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 20:00CDT </p>
<p><font size=5><strong>Carlos Captured; Revolutionary Terrorist</strong><br>
</font><font size=3>By: Clark Staten, ERRI Analyst</font></p>
<p>Chicago, IL, October 10, 1994 (ENN)-- Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, commonly known as &quot;Carlos the Jackal,&quot; has 
reportedly been captured and imprisoned in a Paris jail. He is charged with the 1975 murders of two French 
Counter-Terrorist operatives, who were killed while investigating attacks on Israeli El Al planes at Paris' Orly 
Airport. Sanchez was reportedly captured in Sudan, on Sunday, and turned over to French authorities, who had 
previously sentenced him &quot;in absentia&quot; to life in prison for the killings of the two intelligence agents. </p>
<p>&quot;Carlos&quot; is one of the best known &quot;revolutionary terrorists&quot; known in the history of modern insurgent movements. He 
reportedly has worked for Mohamar Qaddaffi of Libya, Saddam Hussien of Iraq, President Assad of Syria, Fidel 
Castro of Cuba, George Habash and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the Italian Red 
Brigade, Columbia's M-19 Movement, the Baader-Meinholf Gang, and any number of other &quot;Communist and 
Socialist&quot; employers. His resume' is almost unparalleled in the exploits of terrorists of the last three decades. 
According to anti-terrorist analysts, the only international terrorist of greater repute is probably Abu Nidal(Sabri 
Banna). </p>
<p>Carlos, a 1969 graduate of Moscow's Patrice Lamumba University, has been tied to &quot;Communist revolutionary 
movements&quot; since he became a 14-year-old member of the Communist party in Venezuela. His father, a wealthy 
Venezuelan Communist party leader, was so dedicated to Leninist/Marxist theory and practice that he named his 
three sons Vladamir, Ilich, and Lenin. In his teens, Carlos was allegedly given guerrilla training in Cuba. By the age of 
twenty, Carlos reportedly had moved to Jordan and was being trained in weapons and explosive usage by hard-core 
members of the PFLP commando. Shortly thereafter, he began what has turned out to be an infamous career as an 
international &quot;pay for hire&quot; terrorist. </p>
<p>Although some intelligence reports link &quot;Carlos&quot; to the 1972 Massacre of eleven (11) Israeli athletes in Germany, 
most counter-terrorist analysts suspect that the Olympic massacre was master-minded by the Black September 
organization and Abu Nidal. It is more likely that in 1971 and early 1972, &quot;Carlos&quot; was fighting and learning combat 
tactics in a guerrilla war against King Hussein, in Jordan. It is also possible that &quot;The Jackal&quot; had begun acting as an 
intelligence agent or informer for the KGB. </p>
<p>By 1973, however, his terror activities had begun in earnest. He has publicly admitted to his 1973 assassination 
attempt on a British Millionaire named Edward Sieff, who was a well-known Jewish businessman and owner of the 
Marks and Spencer stores in London. Within the next two years, he was believed involved in the takeover of the 
French Embassy at the Hague, the killing of the two French Intelligence agents for which he has been recently 
captured, and a 1976 takeover/kidnapping of OPEC oil ministers in Vienna, Austria. Later in 1976, he was involved 
in a Skyjacking, that led to the now famous Entebbe raid by Israeli commandos. </p>
<p>In the late seventies and early eighties, &quot;Carlos&quot; was blamed for any number of skyjackings, bombings, and machine 
gun/grenade attacks on British, French and Israeli targets. He became a master of disguises and was known to have 
obtained any number of false identities, complete with passports and credit cards. Adding to his reputation as a 
&quot;terrorist master-mind&quot; was the fact that, even if no real evidence could be produced to link him to an atrocity, it was 
often blamed on him, out of convenience or ineptitude. But, regardless of embellishments, the reality of &quot;Carlos&quot; was 
described by a Saudi Arabian Oil Minister, who had been kidnapped during the 1975 OPEC takeover. &quot;Carlos...is a 
ruthless terrorist who operates with cold-blooded, surgical precision,&quot; according to Ahmed Zaki Yamani. Lauded by 
some as a &quot;professional killer&quot; with 'cool, deliberate actions&quot;, he also has been described by others as a &quot;bumbling 
psychotic who shoots people in the face, and is extremely lucky.&quot; Whether luck, or ruthless brutality, &quot;Carlos&quot; has 
reveled in the limelight of his deadly performance. </p>
<p>In 1982 and 1983, &quot;Carlos&quot; is suspected of several bombings in Paris, France, resulting in deaths of at least thirteen 
(13) people and the wounding of one-hundred and fifty (150) more. In the mid-1980's, it is believed that he may 
have also participated in the planning and execution of several operations against Israel, operating out of Syria and 
Lebanon. He is reported to have consulted with Col. Mohammar Qaddaffi and even Saddam Hussein, during their 
conflicts with the United States. </p>
<p>&quot;Carlos&quot; unexpectedly dropped from sight during the late 1980's and there were even reports of his death. 
Unconfirmed reports have placed him in Mexico, Columbia, and Damascus, Syria during recent years. The end of 
the &quot;Cold War&quot; and the collapse of the U.S.S.R., may have placed him in a situation with few sponsors, and little 
ideological motivation to continue his terror campaign. In recent months, he may have even been kicked out of Syria, 
as they warm their relations with Israel and move closer to a peace accord with one of their oldest enemies. &quot;The 
Jackal&quot; may have found himself with few safe places to go. </p>
<p>Apparently, Sudan was one of them, or so he thought. Even they, however, we not willing to provide the beastly 
killer with a refuge. They arrested &quot;Carlos&quot; and turned him over to French authorities, who had previously notified the 
Sudanese of his presence in Sudan. In the end, even the Sudanese, who are thought to be moving closer to a 
&quot;fundamentalist-revolutionary-moslem&quot; government, have decided to turn over the infamous &quot;Jackal&quot; and maybe win 
some eventual favor in world opinion. </p>
<p>One question remains. Will the arrest and detention of &quot;Carlos&quot; have any real effect on the future number or 
savageness of terrorist events? Most counter-terrorist experts agree...probably not. The face of terrorism has 
changed and even the death of &quot;Carlos&quot; couldn't prevent further violence. </p>

<font size=5><strong>ORGANIZED TERRORISM; &quot;Movement for Islamic Change&quot; </strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<IMG SRC="/DOD-LOGO.GIF" align=right>
<br>
The USA Today reported on Friday that classified U.S. intelligence documents indicate that the rogue state of 
Iran has a network of eleven camps to train terrorists. It is believed, according to the documents, that the 
bombers who conducted the attacks on the U.S. military sites in Saudi Arabia in November of 1995 and on 25 
June 1996 were trained at these Iranian terror camps.<br>
<br>
The largest of the eleven sites is the Imam Ali camp, which is located east of Tehran. Other large camps are 
located northeast of Tehran in Qazvim; Qom, located south of Tehran; and another is located southwest of 
Tehran in Hamadan. All of the camps are said to be designed to look like small villages, with houses, shops and 
mosques. However, these small villages all closed to the general public. The camps were discovered through 
satellite obsevation, intelligence gathered by the National Security Agency and through HUMINT sources.<br>
<br>
Two organizations known as the Organization of Islamic Revolution and the Hezbollah of Hejaz are said to have 
received bomb training at the Imam Ali camp. U.S. intelligence believes that most of Iran's terrorist attacks are 
planned from Imam Ali.<br>
<br>
The classified documents allegedly indicated that the camps teach students how to assemble bombs and carry 
out assassinations. Up to 5,000 men and women have been trained at the camps. It is believed that at least 500 
people have been taught such skills as how to make suicide bombs Trainees for the camps are said to have 
come from: Algeria, Egypt, Gaza, Iran, Jordan, Lebannon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, and Turkey.<br>
<br>
According to the documents, Iranian president Hasemi Rafsanjani set up the camps two years ago. The 
instructors in the camps are from Iran's Revolutionary Guard and intelligence service. All of the terrorist attacks 
are said to be approved by Iran's Supreme Council. A spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry, of course, 
denied the charges. He, in turn, accused the United States of &quot;backing Israel's state terrorism.&quot;<br>
<br>
All of this news is very disturbing and fits into other intelligence that ENN has been gathering about the activities 
of Iran. Three or four sources have been telling ENN of a &quot;terrorist summit&quot; that has recently taken place in 
Tehran. Israeli intelligence sources have said that attacks &quot;to be directed primarily against U.S. targets.&quot; were 
discussed at the meeting.<br>
<br>
French sources say that the main goal is the annihilation of Israel and the United States. Discussed were ways to 
improve the terror camps, propaganda -- it has been seen that Iranian and Libyan rhetoric against the U.S. has 
been increased as of late, and financing.<br>
<br>
An official international terrorist organization, represented by Iran, Libya and Syria, was said to have been 
formed. It is to be called the &quot;Movement for Islamic Change.&quot; Other members are said to be from the 
Hezbollah terrorist organization in Lebanon and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.<br>
<br>
Later in the day on Friday, U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry warned that &quot;strong action&quot; will be taken 
against any nation that is linked to the bombing of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia. In an interview, Perry said that 
Great Britain and France have already been briefed &quot;in general terms&quot; about U.S. plans.<br>
<br>
The Secretary was asked if that there may be a connection to Iran and he replied, &quot;Possibly ... we know that 
Iran is very active in international terrorism, some of it linked against the United States. It's no secret, they have 
announced that themselves. The Saudis, I think, are close to completing their investigation on that case and will 
be announcing that soon. I anticipate that we will find, when they announce it ... there will be an international 
connection, yes.&quot;<br>
<br>
The SecDef said that he, himself, has not yet come to a final conclusion about who was responsible for the 
bombing attack on 25 June 1996, but he called Iran &quot;the leading candidate&quot; for international terrorism that is 
directed against the United States. He said, &quot;If we have compelling evidence of international sponsorship of that 
bombing, we will take strong action.&quot;<br>
<br>
Perry also said that the United States has a vital interest in the Persian Gulf region and will maintain the free flow 
of oil from the Gulf. He said that there are elements that would &quot;like to drive us out of the Gulf.&quot; Adding, &quot;They 
cannot confront us militarily and therefore they are trying to do it indirectly by weakening public support in the 
U.S. or weakening public support in Saudi Arabia for the force being there. We cannot let them succeed.&quot;<br>
<br>
According to the Defense Secretary, the U.S. is watching several different groups in the Gulf region very 
closely, including militant groups in the Saudi kingdom. He said, &quot;There is direct evidence that some of these 
groups are internationally supported. They have support in training, in the funding, in providing materials to 
them, maybe even in planning and directing their operations.&quot;<br>
<br>
ERRI analysts are saying that recent activities in Washington are ringing &quot;alarm bells&quot;, in several quarters 
throughout the world.<br>

<H2>IRA Claims Responsibility-UK Steps Up Preparedness for More</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENNFAX Managing Editor
<P>

The Irish Republican Army (IRA) officially claimed responsibilty
on Saturday for the terrorist bombing in east London that injured
more than 100 people on Friday evening.  Rescue workers continue to
search the buildings that were wrecked by the blast.The London Fire 
and Civil Defense Authority has confirmed that there are still some 
people not accounted for.
<P>

Scotland Yard said that two people were killed, and at least 100 people 
were injured in Friday's blast. 36 People were transported to hospitals.
Five of the victims were reported to be in serious condition. 
Three police officers were reported among the injured victims.
<P>

Elsewhere in London, heavily armed police were seen stopping and searching
cars and trucks.  Trash bins have been removed from railway stations
as a precaution, to remove possible hiding places for bombs.

For the first time in more than a year, British troops stationed
in Northern Ireland put their helmets and flak jackets back on.
They resumed their patrols of streets and roads. Roads around
the airport were sealed off and street checkpoints were set up. In what 
is seen as a highly symbolic move, the British soldiers removed their
regimental berets.  The soldiers had taken off their helmets and donned
the berets in late 1994 as a "de-escalatory measure."
<P>

Army patrols in their Land Rovers and on foot returned to what is
considered to be "bandit country" in the southern part of the province
along the border with Ireland.  Land Rover patrols have resumed in
other potential flashpoints.  Security has been tightened at likely
terrorist targets, such as Aldergrove Airport in Belfast. Britain has 
also placed 1,600 troops, that were previously withdrawn
from Northern Ireland, on stand-by.  Should the crisis deepen, these
soldiers will return to the province.
<P>

Sir John Wheeler, the Ulster Security Minister, said, "Today you see
the Army once more in their Land Rovers on the streets.  They weren't
there on Friday.  That is what Provisional IRA-Sinn Fein have done."
<P>

At the present time, the British Army has 16,500 troops assigned to
Northern Ireland.  An Army spokesman said, "We will provide whatever
support the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) says it needs."
<P>

David Capatanchik, a leading expert on terrorism, said that he expects
further but intermittent bombings by the IRA.  He also said that the
chance that the attack was conducted by a splinter group should be
ruled out.  He said, "I do not think a splinter group can be 
responsible because unity is one of the IRA's strengths, which it 
protects vigorously."
<P>

Capatanchik said that the bombing was carefully planned and carried
out.  It followed a similar pattern to previous IRA attacks.  The
terrorism expert said, "This attack did not come as a complete
surprise because if the IRA was responsible, it was their time to
reassert themselves and it highlights their reasons for resisting 
the decommissioning of arms.  They want to talk and fight.  Violence
is their weapon and any elections in Ireland would surely cripple
them, further highlighting why they would continue with this strategy
of bombing."
<P>

He also said that he does not think that it is likely that widespread
bombing would restart in Belfast.  Capatanchik said, "I think what
we will see are intermittent attacks on the mainland, be it London
or wherever they have the resources to carry out an opportunist
attack.  It is unlikely attacks will be carried out in Belfast
because I think everyone there now enjoys walking around without
the immediate threat of an explosion."

<H3>THE UNABOMBER INVESTIGATION CONTINUES...</H3>
<P>
By Steve Macko
<P>

Chicago, IL (ENN)-- Contrary to reports of a few weeks ago, it appears that the trail in
the investigation for the infamous Unabomber has not grown cold.  The
90-man Unabomber Task Force, made up of investigators from the Federal
Bureau of Investigaton, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,
and the United States Postal Service, have compiled an ever changing
list of about 200 suspects.  As of the moment, no one person has been
singled out and even some suspects who appeared to be strong possibilites
have been thrown off the list.
<P>

Two strong possible suspects were a bomber who was active with the
Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in the 1970's and an anti-war radical
who remains a fugitive.  But authorities now say that these two individuals
are not the Unabomber.  FBI spokesman George Grotz said, "If we had an
individual who rises to the level of significant scrutiny, at some point,
the public would be advised."
<P>

The members at the Unabomber task force headquarters in San Francisco
are currently looking at a number of "Robert Vs" at the moment.  This
is based upon a cryptic note found at one of the bombings and on the
memories of a college professor.
<P>

The top ATF member of the task force, Mark Logan, said, "We have a list
of people we are looking at, but the list changes daily."  The list of
200 possible suspects evolved out of a series of recent meetings and
a review of the focus of the task force and suspects.
<P>

The two men that investigators have now taken off the list were 47-year-old
Leo Burt and the SLA's bomb expert, who disappeared in the 1970's, James
Kilgore.  Burt was a anti-Vietnam War radical who is accused of the bombing
at the University of Wisconsin Army Mathematics Research Center in
August of 1970.  At least one person was killed in the bombing.  Burt
then disappeared from sight and in 1972 had a manifesto of his own
published in a leftist publication.  Burt's manifesto had some similarities
to the recently published Unabomber's manifesto.  Burt criticized
bureaucratic tendencies, worried about the destruction of the individual
in modern society and wanted change to come from the bottom and work itself
upwards.  Burt is also said to bear some physical resemblence to a composite
drawing that has been made of the Unabomber.
<P>

The other man who was thought to be a potential suspect is James Kilgore.
Kilgore disappeared in the 1970's and was the bomb expert for the infamous
Symbionese Liberation Army, the group that kidnapped newspaper heiress
Patty Hearst.  It is said that Kilgore liked to use the same brand of
batteries as the Unabomber.
<P>

But according to the FBI, neither of these two seem to be the Unabomber.
FBI spokesman Grotz said, "I would not put them in a high priority status
as Unabomb suspects."
<P>

The man in charge of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service in San Francisco
said, "We looked at Burt and Kilgore a few years ago ... we never found 
any reason to believe it was either of those folks."
<P>

The thing that basically eliminates Burt and Kilgore is the psychological
profile of the Unabomber.  Psychologists believe that the Unabomber is a
loner and is unlikely to have ever been a member of an organized political
group.  He is white and is in his late 30s or 40s.  The Unabomber is
meticulous.  He must be, otherwise his bombs could blow up in his face.
He is believed to be anti-social.  He probably drives an older model car
and keeps it in excellent condition.  There may be a woman in his life,
but the relationship would be based upon convenience and she would not
have complete access to the Unabomber's home or a workshop.  It is
believed that the bomber lives in the San Francisco-Sacramento area.
<P>

So, investigators continue to look at many "Robert Vs."  According to
Grotz, "The name Robert V has been known to the task force for a couple
of months, and due to the potential link between the name and a previous
note ... several Robert Vs have been interviewed."
<P>

The investigation has centered a lot on a possible Northwestern University
connection.  The FBI does believe that the Unabomber grew up in the
northern suburbs of Chicago, the area of Niles and Morton Grove have
been looked at hard by authorities.  Incidentally, that area is not far
from the offices of ERRI.  The Unabomber is believed to have attended
either Northwestern University in Evanston or the University of Illinois.
<P>

One thing is for certain.  The investigators of the Unabomber Task Force
in San Francisco do not believe that they have heard the last of the man
that they continue to search for.

<font color="#FF0000"><font size=5><strong>Explosion at Olympic Centennial Park</strong></font></font><br>
<br>
A major emergency response has been declared in Atlanta at the Centennial Olympic Park. Police say that an 
&quot;explosion&quot; has occurred near a stage, where a rock band was playing. According to Atlanta police sources, at least 
100 people are reported injured. The cause of the explosion is not know at this time. Multiple ambulances are either 
on-scene or enroute at this time.<br>
<br>
ENN is gathering additional details at this time. More soon.<br>

<font color="#FF0000"><font size=5><strong>Athletes Reported Injured</strong></font></font><br>
<br>
Unconfirmed reports have been received by ENN that at least two U.S. Olympic athletes have been injured in this 
evenings explosion at the AT&amp;T Global Village Stage. Another unofficial report has been received from a state law 
enforcement official that there are fatalities. No official statements have been issued as of the time of this report about 
the cause of the explosion.<br>
<br>
According to a NBC news local cameraman, he was asked by security personnel to move away from a tower prior 
to the explosion. He as warned of a &quot;suspicious package&quot; that may have been found. Shortly thereafter a major 
detonation occurred. Local EMS officials say that as many as 150 people may have been injured, several of them 
seriously. Many others are thought to have received minor &quot;shrapnel wounds&quot; and some concusion type injuries.<br>
<br>
As many as 25 ambulances have responded to the incident along with numerous units of the Atlanta fire department. 
No fire ensued after the initial detonation. A triage station has been set-up on a nearby corner and the injured appear 
to be transported in an orderly manner, according to eyewitnesses.<br>

<br>
As yet unconfirmed reports have been recieved that two additional &quot;devices&quot; have been found in the Olympic 
Centennial park area. According to a Fulton County Deputy Sherrif, and now being reported on CNN, additional 
bomb squad technicians are being called to the scene to attempt to check and secure the additional devices. <br>
<br>
Fear are routinely raised of 'secondary devices&quot;, when a blast of undetermined origin has occurred. Additional 
devices are sometimes left to &quot;delay detonate&quot; and injure or kill rescuers. ENN is gathering additional information and 
will provide it as it becomes available...<br></p>

<font color="#FF0000"><font size=5>FBI Officials Verify Explosion is Caused by Bomb</font></font><br>
<br>
According to FBI Special Agent in Charge Woody Johnson, the explosion at Centennial Park in Atlanta was the 
result of &quot;a bomb&quot; and is being considered a &quot;terrorist act&quot; until determined otherwise. This decision will clear the 
way for the FBI Counter-Terrorist task force and other special units to assume command and control of the 
investigation surrounding the bombing. No confirmation was issued in regard to other devices that were found at the 
scene. <br>
<br>Speculation continues that the device that exploded and killed at least two people, and injured another 110, was a 
&quot;pipe bomb&quot;. Eyewitnesses were quoted as saying that they smelled what was described as &quot;gunpowder&quot; shortly 
after the blast; if true, this could be consistent with a improvised pipebomb. Other witnesses said that the police were 
trying to evacuate the area near the eventual blast, just prior to the explosion. Two sources say that they believe that 
police had recieved a 911 call with a &quot;bomb threat&quot; just prior to the detonation and that the call may have been made 
from a pay phone near the Centennial park.<br></p>

<TITLE>Terrorism; What if it Happened Here?</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<H2>WHAT If it happened in America??</H2>
<P>

Chicago, IL., September 5, 1995 -- Three series of events, that have occurred in 1995, that should cause Americans to stop, pause, and consider both their luck and preparedness. The series of tragic events involve multiple terrorist attacks in Tokyo/Yokahoma,Japan, Tel Aviv/Jerusalem, Israel, and now in Paris, France. The psychological and emotional impact of these events is just beginning to be understood. 
<P>
In both France and Japan the public response, in some quarters, to the continued attacks, has reportedly bordered on hysteria. The Israeli response, steeled by years of conflict and continued battles with its Palestinian neighbors, seems to have made its residents more stoic in the face of continued assault. In both France and Japan, government officials have blamed the media for much of the fear and concern among citizens and have called for restraint of the coverage of such events. The Israeli press covers an on-going conflict on a much more frequent basis and appears to have a much more "matter of fact" approach to the atrocities. The rhetorical question is obvious..to what can we attribute the differences in the public attitudes in France, Japan, and Israel? Further, what kind of public response could be expected in America, should she be subjected to a series of devastating bomb threats, bombings, or public gas poisonings?
<P> 
On of the frequently overlooked aspects of counter-terrorist (CT) operations would appear to be a developmental understanding of the public's perspective towards the act(s). A prevailing attitude among at least some CT experts seem to be that the best answer to this issue involves finding some way to invoke complete public ignorance of the circumstances or implications of the act. Another involves the the 'sand-bagging" of the press with "no comment" comments and the citing "security concerns" as a reason not to explain the situation to the public. Yet another view actually purports the use of misinformation or misdirection in hopes of affording some sort of "operational security".
<P>
In order to understand the public response to a terrorist act, it is also necessary to ask what effect the acts of those managing the event will have on the public psyche.  If anything can be learned from the management of other disasters or major traumatic events, it is that ignorance of the situation frequently leads to panic, misunderstanding, and criticism and alienation between rescuers and the public. A far better approach has been developed by many civilian emergency management systems.  It begins, in at least some ways, to answer the public's questions and attempts to explain the inexplicable...a major act of terror.
<P>
<HR>
To gain a better understanding of this process, several points should be considered:
<P>

<UL>
<LI> An overriding goal is to cause fear in the populace.
<LI> One of the terrorist main goals is to foster and spread mis-trust between a government and its citizens.
<LI> A third goal is change public perceptions and attitudes toward the government, its policies, or its anticipated actions
<LI>On given occasions, unexplained benevolent acts, such as releasing hostages or providing medical care to enemies, are done to gain publicity and/or favorable public attention
<LI> It is likely that in several recent terrorist acts that no claim of responsibility is being made, out of fear of public criticism or discontinued support for the sponsoring           organization(s) (aside from attempting to escape apprehension or retribution)
<LI>Misinformation and falsifications are often, if not always, exposed at some future date and frequently reflect dishonesty/discredit on those perpetrating the fraud,                 regardless of the alleged motivation.
<LI> "The Press", if not made an ally in during the incident, may well become an adversary during it and after it is over. If they are not given some facts as the story develops, they will undoubtedly "make them up" in order to meet the public need           for explanation.
</UL>
<P>
<HR>
It should be noted that none of these comments are intended or should be contrued as attempting, in any way, to compromise real operational security issues.  It is well understood that the withholding of essential information, equipment, methods, tactics, and strategies is often a necessity in successful counter-terrorist operations. But, withholding information for a period of time is not the same as misdirection or misinformation. The operational necessities, shouldn't, prevent the operation managers from providing on-going "sanitized" news releases to news organizations and the public in general, and eventually facts of the story.
<P> 
The idea is to foster the support of the news media and the public, both for the government involved, and the operational forces that are attempting to resolve the crimes or on-going crisis. In effect... it is an attempt to counter the effects of fear and mistrust being caused by the terrorists. Further, it may prove useful to actually publicize the successful intervention/resolution of an act(s), attempted act(s), or the apprehension of those responsible.  To do so may actually act as a deterrent to those that would commit future acts and certainly help to minimize the detrimental public effects that terrorists would hope to cause.
<P>
In light of these aforementioned observations, one could surmise that a more proactive response to public opinion formulation would serve American counter-terrorist forces well. The American press can be expected to be as vociferous as their brethern in Europe and the Mid-East, if not more so. The American public hue and cry, in a country that is unaccustomed to insurgent aassault, can be expected to be loud and demanding. Public careers will undoubtedly be made or broken, depending on the outcome of given events surrounding possible frequent acts of violence directed against America. Much of what occurs and how it is accepted by the public can be determined by how "the media" and the provision of public information is managed.
<P>
One thing is certain. If America's counter-terrorist analysts and operatives don't manage the American perspective of terrorists, our avowed enemies will.

<H2>MORE IRA ATTACKS ON THE BRITISH MAINLAND?</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

This past Thursday, Chief Constable Sir Hugh Annesley, the head of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, told a news conference that Britain should expect more IRA attacks in the near future. Annesley warned, "I believe that it is possible that there will be further attacks on the British mainland.  I also believe it is possible that there will be attacks in Northern Ireland."
<P>

Annesley also warned that Irish Republican Army (IRA) violence in Northern Ireland could ignite an immediate retalitory response from Protestents loyal to British rule.  The Chief Constable said, "If the Provisionals (IRA) were to attack Northern Ireland there is no doubt whatsoever that there would be an immediate and without warning retalitory action by loyalist terrorists both within Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland."
<P>

The Irish Republican Army was formed in 1969 as the armed wing of Sinn Fein.  The group is dedicated to the removal of British forces from Northern Ireland and then reunifying the province with the Republic of Ireland.  The IRA terrorists have selected targets in mainland Britain from prime ministers to just ordinary citizens.
<P>

Some of the major attacks by the IRA carried out in mainland Britain have been:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>-- 21 November 1974: Two pubs in Birmingham were bombed.  21 people were killed and 162 others were wounded.
<LI>-- 12 October 1984: Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher narrowly escaped injury in a bomb attack at a hotel in Brighton.  Five people were killed and 30 others were injured.
<LI>-- 7 February 1991: A mortar attack was launched on Number 10 Downing Street, the official residence of the prime minister in London.
<LI>-- 9 February 1996: The most recent IRA cease-fire was ended by an explosion near the S. Quay station in East London. More than 50 people are injured and buildings damaged for several blocks  
<LI>-- 14 February, 1996: A bomb exploded on a bus in central London, killing one and injuring eight others. A suspected IRA operative was reportedly carrying the device to another location when it went off.
<LI>-- 15 June, 1996: A large device exploded in Manchester, injuring more than 200 people and causing more than $1,000,000 in damage. The IRA claimed responsibility, even as it was attempting to negotiate its participation in peace talks in N. Ireland.
</UL>
<P>
From 1 September 1994 to 8 February 1996, the IRA observed a 17-month ceasefire.  This was matched by a cessation of military operations by Protestent loyalists in Northern Ireland, who want the province to remain part of the United Kingdom.

THE FOLLOWING IS A REPRINT FROM THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIRE CHIEFS 
NEWSLETTER &quot;ON SCENE&quot;<br>
<br>
<font size=6><strong>Another Lawsuit!</strong></font><br>
<br>
By Gary G. Ludwig, MS, EMT-P<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>Ventura County Lawsuit; Medtrans vrs. City of Ventura</strong></font></p>
<p align=left>On June 7, 1996, Pruner Health Services, a Medtrans subsidiary based in Ventura County, California, filed a lawsuit 
against the City of Ventura arguing the city's decision to take over ambulance service. Medtrans asked for a 
preliminary injunction to prevent the city from proceeding with the plans and asked the court to decide who has the 
ultimate authority to provide the service. At a June 24 hearing, a judge denied the injunction. Mike Harris, EMS 
program manager for the VFD, tells me the decision to enter into EMS transport was not a public versus private 
issue but a service level concern. Two years ago citizens in the community started a petition drive for VFD to assume 
transport. Long response times were a problem. Three private ambulances were supposed to be committed to 
Ventura at all times; however, it was not unusual to have two of the three doing routine transfer calls, leaving only one 
ambulance for a city of more than 100,000 people. Pruner would move other ambulances to cover the void, but they 
often would not move into the city, still leaving only one ambulance. The introduction of VFD into ALS transport 
complements their existing ALS engines with vertical integration into the 9-1-1 system. Harris can be reached at 
805-339-4461.</p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>Med-Trans Employees Rally For Union</strong></font></p>
<p>On June 25, 1996, Medtrans employees rallied outside the Medtrans headquarters in Skokie, Illinois, in support of 
union representation demanding wage increases and better health insurance.</p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>AMR Buys Half of Florida Hospital-Based Ambulance</strong></font></p>
<p>AMR signed a letter of intent to purchase 50 percent of ownership interest in Florida Regional Emergency Services. 
This is the first time AMR has entered the hospital-based ambulance market. FRES, based in Orlando, managed 
ambulance services for several hospitals in the Orlando area and Texas and generated fees of $9 million in 1995.</p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>Doctor Calls For Eliminating Dual-Role Personnel</strong></font></p>
<p>Two thumbs down to a statement made by Dr. Donald Crowell of California in Emergi-Press as he was being 
recognized as a leader in the EMS profession. Responding to a question about the future of EMS, he said, &quot;Cities 
will be under great economic pressure to eliminate fire fighter/paramedics since non-firefighters are much cheaper.&quot; 
Crowell has apparently not taken the IAFC's EMS costing strategies class for determining appropriate cost 
allocations methods and pricing plans that show the cost- effectiveness of fire-based EMS operations. For more 
information on classes, contact the IAFC Conference Department at 703-273-9815 ext. 301.</p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>Winter Park, FL Assumes EMS Transport Duties</strong></font></p>
<p>January 1, 1997, marks the date Winter Park (Florida) Fire Department will assume all transport since the City 
Council's approval of its proposal. Rural/Metro is the current provider. Deputy Chief Jim White tells me service 
levels increase at zero cost using WPFD's existing ALS transport vehicles and personnel. With this win/win/win 
situation for the citizens, service levels will increase, transport fees will decrease, and revenue will be generated for 
the community. White can be reached at 407-623-3299.</p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>McCarthy To Lead California Fire Chiefs</strong></font></p>
<p>Congratulations to Captain Gene McCarthy of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. He will assume the 
presidency of the California Fire Chief's EMS Section, Southern Division, on July 25, from Pete Lawrence of 
Oceanside. Other members of the board will be Battalion Chief Ron Mayfield from Rancho Cucamonga FPD and 
Battalion Chief Richard Elliott from Redondo Beach.<br>
(ENN Editor's note: Rumors also abound about an upcoming promotion for McCarthy, who may soon be placed in 
command of all EMS functions for L.A. County. Congrats...Gene!)</p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>Paramedic and Intermediate EMT Curriculum Revision Underway</strong></font></p>
<p>The process of revising the EMT-Paramedic and Intermediate curricula is well underway by Walt Stoy and the 
Center for Emergency Medicine in Pittsburgh. The IAFC EMS Section is one of the 15 organizations represented on 
the National Review Team. Changes to the curriculum will continue throughout the next several months. The NRT 
will continue to review the curriculum through a pilot program to determine what is core material and what is 
enhancement information. You can download the curriculum at http://www.pitt.edu/~paramed.</p>

<H2>Security Tightens; Terrorist Threat Increases</H2>
<P>
Chicago, IL, (ENN) October 2, 1995--Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman and nine
of his convicted co-conspirators were led from a courtroom in
handcuffs today.  They had been convicted of a variety of
charges, most of them relating to a number of conspiracies to
conduct a war of "Urban Terrorism" against America. Among their
alleged targets were the United Nations, the NYC FBI Headquarters,
the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels, and a number of world leaders.
Their murderous intent alleged to have been to create fear and
change the Mid-East policy of the United States. Their methods
included guns and bombs and fiery rhetoric, designed to cause
discontent and revolution among Moslems in America.
<P>
Concurrent with the verdict in the Rahman trial, U.S. Secretary
of Transportation Federico Pena announced that he had ordered
security at all U.S. airports stepped up to levels unseen since
the Persian Gulf War.  An purposefully anonymous Transportation
Department analyst is quoted by the Associated Press as saying
that increased security wasn't as the direct result of specific
threats against aviation targets, but rather, indicative of an
increase in the overall threat level against the United States.
<P>
Clark Staten, Executive Director and analyst for the
Chicago-based Emergency Response & Research Institute (ERRI),
said that the current threat level is "multi-dimensional" and
"multi-faceted".  By that, Staten said that he means that the
current threats against the U.S. are now coming from a variety
of groups and for a variety of reasons.  In particular, Staten
said that priority should be given to concerns about:
<P>

 
<UL>
<LI>The visit of Pope John Paul this week. The Pope was previously
  targeted by Moslem extremists during a visit to the
  Philippines
<LI>Revenge, by Egyptian extremists, for the conviction and       
  imprisonment of Rahman and his followers
<LI> U.S. participation in and support for another Mid-East peace  
  accord between Israel and the PLO
<LI> Detention of and possible extradition of alleged Hamas
  financier Mousa Abu Marzook
<LI>Already issued public threats made by Hamas, Islamic          
  Jihad, Hezbollah, The Popular Front for the Liberation of
  Palestine (PFLP), and others
<LI>The possibility of a terrorist act against the 50th
  Anniversary celebration of the founding of the United
  Nations, to be held later this month in New York City.
</UL>
<BR> 
<P> 
Staten said that ERRI's computer assessment of the current
threat situation is as great as it has been in recent years,
largely due to a combination of factors surrounding multiple
targets, multiple motivations, and multiple potential
antagonists. He said that increased airport security measures
are totally warranted at this time and that additional measures
may need to be taken if additional threat intelligence is
developed in coming days.
<P> 
Aside from air traffic, Staten said that the following list of
potential targets could also be included in future security
considerations:
<P>
<HR>
<BR>
<H5>Possible Targets of Opportunity</H5>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>1. Unknown briefcases, packages, boxes, etc., left unattended in
areas of public transportation or business (i.e. Airports,
Train Stations, Bus Stations, Court Houses, Banks, Stock
Exchanges)
<LI>2. Sports stadiums, political gatherings, large shopping malls,
public parks (i.e. any place that people congregate in density)
<LI>3. Seemingly abandoned cars, parked in an areas that are densely
inhabited, or in close proximity to other "high-risk" targets.
(i.e. Near any of the above mentioned areas, embassies, 
government installations)
<LI>4.  Civic, Government, Religious, Ethnic, other recognized
leaders... may be the targets of assassination attempts.
<LI>5. Electrical Power plants, Natural Gas facilities, Nuclear
Plants, Chemical factories, telephone exchanges or central
offices, or any other public utilities that could cause
disruption of service or a danger to the public.
<LI>6. Anything that could be destroyed and undermine the public
confidence in government or civic institutions. (Computer
networks,   TV/Radio channels, traffic control systems, sewers,
water supplies)
<LI>7. Emergency Response facilities; Fire/Police/EMS stations,
FBI/Secret Service/ATF/DEA/CIA or other federal law enforcement
offices or facilities. All in all...any government building.
</UL>
<P>
<BR>
Staten said that all of the above have been chosen as targets,
in a number of other countries where extremists have operated in
the past. Further, he said that terrorist tactics used in Egypt,
Japan, Lebanon, Israel, and elsewhere could potentially be
imported to the United States and used with devastating
effectiveness.

<H2>FIREFIGHTER KILLED IN ROOF COLLAPSE...</H2>
By Jim Fay, ENN NYC-NJ Metro Correspondent
<P>

A three alarm fire, in an illegal automobile "chop-shop",
resulted in the death of an FDNY firefighter today.  He reportedly died as a result
of a roof collapse.
<P>

Firefighter Louis Valentino of Rescue Company 2 was
operating with his company and other units on the first
floor of the building when the roof came down, trapping
Valentino and other firefighters. When the roof collapsed,
a third alarm was immediately transmitted, and rescue
operations using "vetter bags," or air bags, began.
At least four other firefighters were removed from under
the roof section, all in serious condition, and transported
to Kings County Hospital by NYC*EMS. A total of 14 injured
firefighters were treated.
<P>

The fire occured at 4400 Glenwood Road in the East Flatbush
section of Brooklyn. The building was originally built
as an automobile dealership, but was divided between
a health club and an auto shop that was used by auto
thieves to cut up stolen cars so that the parts could
be sold, hence, a "chop-shop."
<P>

Firefighter Valentino was 37 years old and married. He
was cited two times for bravery since joining the FDNY
in 1984. Prior to being accepted and assigned to Rescue
Company 2, Valentino was assigned to Engine Co. 281 and
Ladder Co. 147, both in Brooklyn.
<P>

Valentino was the second FDNY member to die in the line
of duty in 1996, and the 764th member in the 131 year
history of the FDNY.

<font size=6>ERRI Issued Warnings of Travel Danger </font><br>
By Paul Anderson, Correspondent &amp; Assoc. Editor </p>
<p>Chicago, IL, July 21, 1996 (ENN) -- In a by-lined article, entitled &quot;Terrorism Against the USA; The Next Target?,&quot; 
dated July 10, 1996, Clark Staten of the Emergency Response &amp; Research Institute issued the following warning: </p>
<p>&quot;<em>Threat levels directed against Americans, in general, continue at a high level throughout the world,

<p>This warning and other detailed observations about terrorism in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Pakistan, and Bosnia were 
prepared on or around July 6th, 1996, based on a analytical reports and an ERRI threat assessment made by a 
proprietary &quot;expert&quot; computer program that continually analyzes on-going threat information and draws inferences 
from a special database of over twelve (12) years of terrorism data. </p>
<p>Regrettably, hardly anyone paid any attention to the article, even though it was widely disseminated to the Associated 
Press (AP), United Press International (UPI), Reuters News Service, CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, to more than thirty 
(30) other media outlets, and several government agencies. Airport security levels were not increased and Americans 
were not advised of any additional need for caution. In fact, the only news producer of note that gave this 
announcement credence or visible coverage was on the Internet. The story ran verbatim in &quot;The American Reporter&quot;, 
published by NewsShare and Executive Editor Joe Shea. </p>
<p>ERRI Executive Director, Clark Staten, said that a combination of the computer program and ERRI human analysis 
have proven to be extremely accurate in their terrorism estimates, and that ERRI had issued warnings or alerts within 
days or few weeks of the Dhahran military base bombing, the Oklahoma City explosion, and the World Trade 
Center bombing. </p>
<p>To further illustrate the authenticity of the ERRI assessments, Staten points to ERRI issued assessments that were 
given to the press on 04/22/96: </p>
<p>&quot;<em>At least two times in the past three weeks, the Emergency Response &amp; Research Institute and it's 
computer-generated threat analysis program have warned of the increased likelihood of an attack on 
America, U.S. citizens, her embassies, military bases, or commercial concerns overseas. According to Clark 
Staten--Executive Director of the Emergency Response &amp; Research Institute(ERRI), American citizens 
traveling overseas should exercise extreme caution while in-transit or avoid traveling, unless it is a necessity. </em></p>
<p><em>As the strife continues on the Israeli/Lebanese border, additional Islamic extremist violence can be expected 
almost anywhere in the world...Isreali synagogues, embassies, and commercial concerns along with 
American businesses, diplomatic missions, military sites, airports, and other places where Israelis/Americans 
congregate can expect to be targeted,&quot; Staten said in an Monday morning teleconference briefing for a 
group of emergency managers</em>.&quot; <br>
(<strong>Click here to see the whole ENN article: </strong><a href="/thrt0496.htm"><strong>Multi-Dimentional Terrorist Threats Face Israel and USA</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p>Steve Macko, a criminologist and managing editor of the EmergencyNet News Service, the reporting arm of ERRI, 
said he is afraid that many Americans and some reporters are still &quot;in a state of denial&quot; or disbelief regarding 
terrorism. &quot;They continue to believe that it can't happen here...or that threat warnings issued by agencies like ERRI 
are just alarmist theories...without justification or authority,&quot; Macko said. &quot;Time and time again, however, ERRI has 
been correct in its assessments...if we could only convince the mainstream press that they need to help us make the 
American public aware of these threats and prompt lawmakers to take the necessary corrective actions to prepare 
America for further occurrences...we might be able to save some lives or even prevent a future atrocity,&quot; Macko 
concluded. </p>

New Terror Tactics; <BR>
<H2><A NAME="A1">Counter-Terrorist Experts Meet in Chicago</B></A></H2>
<P>
Chicago, IL., August 3, 1995 -- According to some of the world's leading counter-terrorist experts, the way that terrorist acts are being committed may have changed in recent years.  In discussions held at the University of Illinois', Office of International Criminal Justice, 10th Annual &quot;Terrorism; Past Present &amp; Future&quot; conference, experts from both Israel, Argentina, and the United States are reporting on a perceived change in the organization and operations of a number of terrorist groups.  <P>
During the conference, which ends today, Mr. Yonah Alexander of George Washington University and Mr. Julio Cirino of the Embassy of Argentina presented a panel discussion regarding the changing face of terrorism. In the session, entitled &quot;Patterns of Organization and Target Selection&quot;, Mr. Alexander and Mr. Cirino presented a hypothesis that challenged traditional thinking in regard to how the perpetrators of major bombings and other atrocities are organized, or, in the words of Mr. Curino, &quot;disorganized&quot;.  In their hypothesis, they pointed out that there are actually at least two models in the organization of terrorist groups.  <P>
In the more traditional model, well known in military and police counter-terrorist circles, terrorists are organized into &quot;cells&quot;, or small groups and report through &quot;cut-outs&quot; to higher levels of decision makers.  Each larger group seemingly had it's own identity, goals, and ideology.  This model was used by European and South American insurgents for many years. In many ways it is similar to a military &quot;table of organization and equipment&quot; which clearly delineated lines of command and control.<P>
The new model, hypothesized, but not totally verified, involves a much more decentralized approach to terrorist management and operations.  In it, &quot;specialist&quot; guerrillas are only brought together to commit a specific act and then quickly disbanded and returned to their current country of refuge.  This model is one that allegedly is being practiced by Moslem extremist groups and those connected to much of the Mid-East violence. Interesting enough these small &quot;ad hoc&quot; terror organizations also, frequently, do not claim responsibility for their acts, or they claim responsibility for another group. This new model, if proven viable, reportedly further complicates the process of identifying and locating terrorists after the act. <P>
Also interesting to counter-insurgency analysts is the fact that the members of these &quot;ad hoc&quot; groups may be under the control of several different &quot;parent&quot; organizations or even countries, who would acquire their services as needed for specific acts. In other words, specific terrorists are &quot;hired&quot; by one group or another to commit an act and then they become &quot;free agents&quot; again.  According to counter-terrorist specialists, it is unclear if this is being done purely on a mercenary basis, or if the individual terrorists are acting in furtherance of religious or ideological goals.  Most analysts say that it is probably a combination of both of these motivating factors. In general, the new model appears to be practiced by religious fanatics associated with radical fundamentalism.<P>
According to FBI and other American analysts, it is &quot;extremely possible&quot; that the aforementioned model was used in the 1993 World Trade Center (WTC) bombing, and that the WTC incident was one of the first examples of this new pattern.  At least one analyst said that this model could help to explain the differing countries of origin of the defendants in the Sheik Abdul Rahman case in New York City. Since then, the authorities say, the operational design has probably been seen in Argentina, the United Kingdom, Egypt, France, Algeria, and Israel.<P>
Academics and police counter-terrorist specialists say that having identified this new pattern may help them in future investigations of terrorism, but, they caution that this changing and more widely distributed method of operations may also prove to be more difficult to combat than &quot;traditional&quot; patterns of extremist violence. The &quot;brightest prospects&quot; for the future, according to several in attendance at the conference, was the opportunity for them to discuss and gain a better understanding of the complex and challenging problem of both domestic and international terrorism.

<B>**LEAD STORY**</B>

<H2>THE SR-71 BLACKBIRD RISES LIKE A PHOENIX...</H2>
By Steve Macko
<P>

America's premier spy plane that first flew in 1966 is once
again rising into the air after a five year hiatus.  The SR-71
Blackbird is back and flying at up to 15 miles above the ground
at a scorching speed of more than three times the speed of sound.
<P>

The SR-71's primary mission is to take intelligence photos of
enemy installations and forces, without being shot down.  According
to United States Air Force Captain Michael Zimmerman, who is
managing the plane's restoration program at Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, "The plane is the only one of its
kind.  It's the highest-flying, fastest manned reconnaissance
platform in service today."
<P>

The man who oversees the Air Force's entire high-altitude recon
fleet from Beale Air Force Base in California is Colonel Robert
Behler.  Behler is the commander of the 9th Reconnaissance Wing.
About the SR-71, he says, "It's without a doubt...a marvel of
American ingenuity."
<P>

The SR-71's are based at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
The plane carries a crew of two and can fly high enough to see
the curvature of the Earth.  It is called "Blackbird" because of
its dark and stealthy appearance.  The plane is equipped with
camera, radar, and infrared systems.  A new capability on the plane
is a radio link that allows instaneous radar images to be relayed 
to ground.  It no longer has to land and drop off its film.
<P>

In 1990, the 12-plane fleet of SR-71's was retired because of their
high cost to maintain.  But in September of 1995, several of the
Blackbirds were taken out of mothballs in effort to bolster some
known gaps in United States intelligence-gathering capabilities.  
Today, the SR-71 costs $39,000 an hour to operate.
<P>

The United States does have other reconnaissance planes.  They
are the U-2 and the RC-135.  But these two planes are not as
fast or are able to fly as high as the SR-71.
<P>

In 1995, Congress approved $100 million to reactivate three of
the Blackbirds.  Two of the three will be used for intelligence
missions and one will be used for training by NASA. Officially 
unconfirmed reports suggest that the SR-71 is being used in the 
vicinity of Bosnia and may have flown missions in or near Korea 
in recent months.
<P>

Putting the planes back into service was not easy.  Needed spare
parts were no longer being made.  This was overcome by visits to
salvage yards.  A very vital sealant that is used to prevent fuel
leaks was no longer being made bacause it contained a carcinogen.
Captain Zimmerman said, "That was our big show-stopper.  Without
fuel-tank sealant, it never would have gotten off the ground."
The Air Force solved the problem by arranging to buy a lifetime
supply of the needed sealant.
<P>

The SR-71 does have its critics.  Their main complaint is its
operating cost.  In answering the critics, Colonel Behler says, "It's a
costly airplane, but it's very unique in that it can do things 
that no other plane can presently do."

<TITLE>A Visit to the Chicago Bomb Squad</TITLE>

<center><H2>THE CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT BOMB SQUAD</H2></center>
<center><IMG SRC="/dynobomb.gif"></center>
<center>Dynamite/Nail Anti-Personnel Improvised Explosive Device(IED)</center>
<P>
<center><B>By Steve Macko, ENN Managing Editor</B></center>
<P>

Twelve members make up the Chicago Police Department Bomb Squad.
The unit considers themselves close-knit and they get to deal with
constant training, sophisticated tools and dark humor about bomb
scares that range from the truly bizarre to the truly terrifying.
<P>

According to 45-year-old Marty Gavin, a member of the bomb squad,
members of the unit must keep informed about the latest in
electronic gadgetry, as well as have nerves of steel.  Gavin, who
has been a CPD officer for 20 years and a member of the Bomb Squad
since 1989, said that his job has become more complex in this era 
of terrorist bombings, like the one that occurred at the World Trade 
Center in New York City and with the emergence of a high-tech Unabomber.  
Gavin said that the CPD Bomb Squad are studying the Unabomber's devices 
and modus operandi.
<P>

The unit is headquarted in a small office on the South Side of the
city.  Their office is called, "The Bat Cave."  In the Bat Cave,
the bomb squad spends much time training, studying and conducting
research.  When you enter the Bat Cave, you immediately notice the
torpedo that hangs from the ceiling.  On shelves you see hand
grenades, rockets and other types of bombs.  This is not your
typical office.
<P>

Toward the back of the office is a workshop.  In the workshop,
Officer Gavin and his colleagues reconstruct bombs and make
their own tools.
<P>

According to Special Agent Jerry Singer of the Chicago office of
the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF),
Illinois ranks second, behind California, in the number of
bombings.  The number of bombings in the State of Illinois has
risen by 66 percent in recent years.  In 1990, there were 275
reported bombing incidents.  In 1994, the figure had risen to 457.
<P>

According to ATF statistics, bombings in the United States, on a
whole, have risen 49 percent in the past five years.  In 1990,
there were 3,541 reported bombing incidents in the U.S.  That
number rose to 5,290 in 1994.
<P>

Special Agent Singer said, "The materials have always been
available to make the devices, but we're seeing more and more
people now willing to sit down and make them."
<P>

The Unabomber has forced bomb technicians to rethink the way
that they would disarm a suspicious package.  According to 
Gavin, before the Unabomber came along, "We'd be more inclined
to just blow it up."  But, today, bomb experts would try very
hard to "surgically" disable the bomb without destroying its
packaging or circuitry.  They would like to keep the device
intact so that it could be used for evidence and training.
<P>

The Chicago Bomb Squad is called out on an average of six
times a week.  They'll go out and handle anything from 
firecrackers that have exploded inside a mailbox to a remote-
control bomb used in a car or building.
<P>

The explosive device that they are most familiar with is --
the pipe bomb.  Pipe bombs are easy to make, according to 
Officer Gavin.  Gavin said that pipe bombs are usually nothing
like you see in the movies, where if you cut the wrong wire --
it explodes.
<P>

When the present CPD bomb squad was first created about 20 years 
ago -- the bomb technicians didn't have much in the way of equipment
and tools.  The technicians were forced to rely upon their street
smarts and a very simple device called a "jerkus rope" to dispose
of bombs.
<P>

The "jerkus rope" is exactly what it sounds like and is still used
today as a last resort in handling suspicious devices or packages.
Very simply, the jerkus rope is a long piece of rope that a bomb
technician loops around a suspicious package.  The rope is stretched
out and then "jerked" to see if the package explodes.  Officer
Ron Harris of the Bomb Squad said that there has been instances,
in the past, where one end of the jerkus rope is attached to the
suspicious package and the other end was tied to the rear bumper
of a car and they would hit the accelerator.
<P>

Bomb Squad members still carry the jerkus rope.  But, luckily, today,
they have many more sophisticated tools that they can now rely upon.
Some of these tools include: X-ray machines, robots, bomb-sniffing
dogs and a device with a science fiction sounding name of "disruptor."
A disruptor can fire water or slugs at a package with pinpoint
accuracy and is supposed to be able to break apart the circuitry of
an explosive device.
<P>

The bomb technicians prefer to disarm a bomb from a distance.
200 feet away is ideal and lessens the chance of any injury
should a bomb explode.  Gavin said, "Most people have the
impression that there's actually a hands-on physical clipping
of wires.  We would only do that in a life-or-death situation.
Most of our techniques are remote.  Whether it's a package bomb
or a car bomb, we are expected to do something.  There really
hasn't been anything where we haven't had options."
<P>

When the Bomb Squad goes out on a call, they approach each
situation in the same way -- "It's a bomb until we determine
it's not a bomb."  The officers see much in the way of hoaxes
and false alarms.  They've been called out to look at paperweights
that look like hand grenades and carrots that look like dynamite.

Gavin says that his job "is kind of a black art.  There is a kind
of mystique to it, about how bombs are made and how they are
rendered safe."
<P>

In November of 1995, Gavin and his partner were called to the 
Dirksen Federal Building to investigate a suspicious package
that was sent to a federal judge from a prison inmate.  The
bomb technicians X-rayed the package and were able to determine
that it was indeed a crude bomb, of some type.  They disabled
the device by using a high-powered jet of water from the disruptor.
<P>

On a cold Christmas Day, a few years ago, Gavin was sent to Chicago's
O'Hare International Airport to check on a plane that was forced
to land when a note was found on a tray on the jet that said,
"There's a bomb on the plane.  You're dead."
<P>

At O'Hare, the plane was evacuated and Gavin had to go aboard to
look for a bomb.  No bomb was ever found.  Gavin said, "It's kind
of an eerie feeling.  These people are counting on you to kind of
bless this plane and say it's alright.  It bothered me the rest
of the night.  You have to dismiss it, but the thought is always
there ... did I do enough?"
<P>

The most dangerous assignment that Gavin took in was on a night
in 1992, when a car exploded at Division Street and Dearborn
Street, located just north of Chicago's Loop.  The bombmaker,
who was a member of a motorcycle gang, was killed while transporting 
his own pipe bomb.  After the initial explosion, another pipe bomb
had rolled out of the wreckage of the vehicle and into the
intersection.  Gavin and other members of the Bomb Squad were
called out to disable the device.
<P>  

It took the bomb technicians about 20 minutes to render the
device safe.  Gavin remembers, "It was pandemonium that night.
Everyone was in the bars.  I thought it might be some kind of
trap.  Maybe someone in a bar would set it off by remote control."
<P>

The job also has it lighter moments.  One time, Gavin's partner,
Officer Harris, was sent to O'Hare Airport to check on a suspicious
piece of luggage that was found in the terminal.  The package was
"beeping and undulating."  The bomb techs X-rayed the suitcase
and did not like what they saw.  In the suitcase was an electronic
device that was connected to wires and batteries.  After carefully
opening the suitcase they found their "bomb."  The "bomb" was in
reality a vibrating sex toy.
<P>

In another instance, a suspicious package was sent to the office
of a Loop executive.  A note was attached that said that the
package contained the deadly E. coli bacteria.  The Chicago Fire
Department was first to arrive at the scene and they didn't know
what to do about the package.  So, they called for the CPD Bomb
Squad.
<P>

Officer Gavin arrived and X-rayed the package.  It was determined
that the package did not contain a bomb -- at least not in the
traditional sense.  Gavin picked up the package and handed it
to the fire department battalion chief. The chief then reportedly looked for some paramedics to help dispose of the biological hazard.

<P>
<H3>EMS MANAGEMENT FOR HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INCIDENTS</H3>
<BR>
<P>
<HR>
<BR>

BY: Clark Staten, EMT-P, I/C
<BR>
    EMS District Commander, Chicago Fire Department
<BR>
    Past Chairman, National Society of EMS Administrators
<BR>
    Member, NFPA #473 Committee on EMS/Hazardous Materials
<BR>
    Exec. Dir., Emergency Response & Research Institute
<BR>
<P>
<HR>
<BR>

One of the newest and most challenging responsibilities of
an EMS supervisor or administrator is the management of
his/her department's involvement in the response to a
Hazardous Materials Incident.  During recent years, all
Emergency Medical Service (EMS) systems have been required
to participate in these incidents (both morally and legally)
and to provide triage, treatment, and eventual transport
services to toxically exposed patients.  In light of this
need and responsibility, it would appear important to
consider some of the numerous facets of the often complex
matter of managing the EMS portion of a Hazardous Materials
emergency.
<P>
<HR>
<BR>
<H5>JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES & INCIDENT COMMAND</H5>
<BR>

First, of many considerations, is that of deciding who's
responsible for what. As is frequently the case,
juridictional and interdepartmental issues must be resolved
early in the planning process.  The exact involvement and
responsibility of Emergency Medical Service personnel in a
hazardous materials emergency must be determined long before
the need to respond to an incident arises.  The need for them
to respond, however, should not be at issue. That has been
codified in 29 CFR 1910.120 (contiguous federal OSHA & EPA
Regulations), which requires EMS personnel to participate in
any bona-fide hazardous materials emergency.
<P>

When multiple agencies or jurisdictions are involved in the
pre-planning process, it is likely to be even more
complicated and will need to address issues relating to the
exact roles of each of the participating agencies. In
consideration of the history of inter-service rivalries in
many communities, this may entail a lengthy and "spirited"
discourse.  The need, however, can not be diminished nor
denied, to eventually decide the definitive character and
purpose of all of the agencies involved.
<P>

In all cases, a lead agency must be designated as the one
that will provide overall supervision and management of the
incident.  The on-scene leader of that agency, upon his/her
arrival would then be refered to as the "Incident Commander".
Which agency provides that leadership is very probably a
matter to be decided by the duly elected political structure
that exists in any given jurisdiction or political
subdivision.  At the very least, it must collectively be
decided and understood by those agencies that can be expected
to participate in any incident.
<P>

Many cities, counties, and states have a predetermined
arrangement as to which agency shall assume command
responsibility for a particular type of incident. One method
of determining command responsibility is that of real
functionality. For example, at a Hostage/Barricade incident,
the senior police officer at the scene will assume overall
command.  In the event of school bus accident, the senior
EMS/Rescue officer takes charge. And...in many jurisdictions,
at a hazardous materials scene, the most senior fire officer
will become the "Incident Commander.
<P>

This arrangement is not a finite definition of who should be
an "Incident Commander", but rather to offer some examples of
typical arrangements that might take place.  Another instance
of determining the leadership role involves the custom of
understanding that the "Fire Chief" of the given town, in
which the incident occurs, automatically assumes the role of
"Incident Commander" in any incident.  This is the case in
many suburban and rural "mutual aid" networks.
<P>

In other subdivisions of government, a ordinance or law may
dictate who is in charge of an incident.  In at least one
state, regardless of the type or location of the incident, if
a State Trooper arrives at the scene...he is the "Incident
Commander".  Several other cities and states designate a
political official or governmental appointee as the "Leader".
In at least one major Midwestern city, the Fire Commissioner
is designated by ordinance as being in charge of any
incident.  For the purpose of this discussion, it is only
important to know that the role and definition may be set
forth in a local or state law.
<P>

Regardless of how the decision was arrived at, once the
determination of the overall leadership role has been made
and can be readily understood by everyone, the remainder of
the planning effort can go forward.  The role and
responsibility of the various other sectors and agencies can
then be delineated and further defined. In the case of
Emergency Medical Service (EMS) responders, there could
appear to be some obvious and other not so apparent areas of
responsibility.

<H5>DUTIES TO BE PERFORMED AT A HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INCIDENT</H5>
<BR>

The primary functions that must be performed at any toxic
release remain fairly consistent, without consideration of
who performs them.  The top twenty actions that must be taken
will generally involve:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>1.  Incident "Size-up" and assessment
<LI>2.  Scene Control/establishment of perimeter(s)
<LI>3.  Product Identification/information gathering
<LI>4.  Pre-entry examination and determination/donning of
    appropriate protective clothing & equipment
<LI>5.  Establishment of a decontamination area
<LI>6.  Entry planning/preparation of equipment
<LI>7.  Entry into a contaminated area & rescue (as needed)
<LI>8.  Containment of spill/release
<LI>9.  Neutralization of spill/release
<LI>10. Decontamination of victims/patients/Rescuers
<LI>11. Triage of ill/injuried
<LI>12. BLS Care
<LI>13. Hospital/physician consultation
<LI>14. ALS care/specific Antidotes
<LI>15. Stabilization/clean-up of spill

EMS AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY A HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INCIDENT</H5>
<BR>
The most evident expertise of EMS personnel is the prompt and
proper provision of emergency care to the sick and injuried.
They may, however, have various other abilities and
responsibilities in any given jurisdiction.  The most basic
duties of EMS personnel must include:
<P>

1. Identification of the substance that is involved
<BR>
2. Protection of themselves & the patient
<BR>
3. Prepare to prevent/minimize secondary contamination
<BR>
4. Pre/Post entry evaluation of rescuers
<BR>
5. Triage
<BR>
6. Treatment
<BR>
7. Transportation to an appropriate hospital
<BR>
<P>

Other duties that may be performed by EMS personnel (at the
discretion of the jurisdiction having authority over the
incident):
<P>

1. Physical extrication & rescue
<BR>
2. Decontamination
<BR>
3. Use of computerized information resources
<BR>
4. Administration of specific antidotes
<BR>
5. Act as a safety officer(s)
<BR>
6. Incident Command Authority
<BR>
<P>
<HR>
<BR>
<H5>EMS TOXICOLOGY NEEDS</H5>
<BR>

In order to effectively perform their duties at a hazardous
materials incident, EMS personnel must understand some basic
toxicology principals.  They include (but are not limited
too):
<BR>
<P>
A. Acute and Delayed toxicity
<BR>
B. Routes of Exposure
<BR>
   1. Inhalation
<BR>
   2. Absorbtion
<BR>
   3. Ingestion
<BR>
   4. Through open wound/Injection
<BR>
C. Local and systemic effects of exposure
<BR>
D. Dose Response as it relates to Risk assessment
<BR>
E. Synergistic effects of combined substances
<BR>
F. Assessment of toxicology information services/information
<BR>
G. Relationship of proper decontamination to higher mortality
   and morbidity
<P>

H. Alteration of traige principals as they relate to
   toxically exposed patients.
<P>
I. Levels of personal protective clothing and equipment
   needed
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>

<H5>EMS TREATMENT PROTOCALS</H5>
<BR>

As is normally the case, EMS managers must work with their
locally designated Medical Control Authority (Project Medical
Physician), when determining the appropriate levels and types
of care to be given to the toxically exposed patient.  Due to
the dynamic and often hostile nature of a hazardous materials
environment, it is suggested that Standing Medical Orders
(S.M.O.s) be pre-established that will allow EMS responders
to follow a comprehensive set of medical treatment
guidelines, without radio contact or direct physician
intervention.
<P>

This recommendation does not mean to preclude or discourage
physican/EMT interaction or consultation, but rather it
offers a option in the event of communications failures or
catastrophic events occuring at the scene.  Normal radio
(telemetry) communications procedures should be utilized as
they are available.
<P>

Some EMS Basic Life Support (BLS) systems even have
physicians or registered nurses that respond to the scene of
hazardous materials incidents that involve casualties.  EMS
administrtators are cautioned, however, that untrained and
ill-equipped medical personnel can be a greater liability
than an asset at the scene of an ever-changing and
potentially dangerous incident.
<P>

A far better choice involves the preplanning of pre-
designated, trained, and equipped Advanced Life Support (ALS)
personnel available to respond to the incident.  While this
may still involve physicians or nursing personnel (depending
on the level of EMT training in the jurisdiction having
authority), they will have been previously trained and have
practice drills with Hazardous Materials mitigation and
rescue personnel.
<P>

They should also be totally familiar with the four levels of
protective clothing and equipment, to include proper
protection by respirators or self-contained-breazthing-
apparatus (SCBA). In order to maximize physician involvement,
it is also recommended that they have a working knowledge of
toxicology and specific antidotes.
<P>

(Author's Note:  These recommendations are not intended to
diminish the role or responsibility of EMS physicians, but to
point out the inherent dangers of participating at the scene
of a toxic release.  Literally, a "shift in the wind", could
expose previously safe rescuers to injury or even death. It
is likely that liability, training, disability, and safety
issues could become a factor in direct physician or nurse
clinical intervention at a hazardous materials site.)

<H2>CIA DIRECTOR WARNS OF CYBERSPACE ATTACKS</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director John Deutch warned Congress on Tuesday that the United States faces a growing threat of cyberspace attacks against its computer networks by other nations and terrorist groups.  Deutch told a Senate Governmental Affairs hearing, "While the details are classified and cannot be discussed here, we have evidence that a number of countries around the world are developing the doctrine, strategies and tools to conduct information attacks." The director would not name the countries suspected.
<P>

Deutch told the senators, "International terrorist groups clearly have the capability to attack the information infrastructure of the United States, even if they use relatively simple means.  I am certainly prepared to predict some very large and uncomfortable incidents."  He said that intelligence and law enforcement agencies were "fully alerted" to the threat.
<P>

The director related how a large-scale attack could disrupt U.S. computer networks that could cripple the banking, business, communications, energy, military and transportation industries in the nation.  All of those industries are dependent on computers that could be (and are, in some cases) vulnerable to sabotage from "hackers" to being physically attacked with explosives. With such weapons as computer viruses transmitted through the internet, such cyber-attacks could shut down international commerce and fund transfers, damage computer systems that guide commercial air and/or rail traffic. cut electrical power, or even prevent the Pentagon from issuing orders to its forces in the field.
<P>

Deutch added, "Day-to-day operations of U.S. banking, energy distribution, air traffic control, emergency medical services, transportation and many other industries all depend on reliable telecommunications and an increasingly complex network of computers, information databases and computer driven control systems.  Virtually any 'bad actor' can acquire the hardware and software needed to attack some of our critical information based infrastructures."
<P>

Director Deutch said, "There is a highly classified intelligence estimate that focuses on foreign attacks on the public-switched telephone network system of this country."
<P>

One senator asked Deutch how he would compare the threat of computer attack to other threats such as nuclear, chemical and biological, the director answered, "I would say it was very, very close to the top."
<P>

The CIA director said that his agency and the U.S. Department of Defense plan to create an Information Warfare Technology Center to handle computer attacks at the National Security Agency (NSA).  He said that the U.S. government has been seeking cooperation from commercial computer users, but many have been reluctant to share their information.
<P>

Besides planning the computer-attack center, Deutch said that U.S. intelligence agencies, along with the U.S. Justice Department and the FBI were devoting more resources to the problem and were looking for evidence of foreign intent to attack U.S. computer systems.  The director said, "One effort looks for foreign sponsorship of U.S.-based computer-hacking activities as well as evidence of organized crime involvement."  The inter-agency critical infrastructure security group is scheduled to release a security threat assessment by 1 December 1996.

<font size=5><strong>Analysts Concentrate On Domestic Souce of Olympic Bomb</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
ATLANTA-- July 29, 1996 (ENN) - The FBI said on Sunday that they were pursuing several promising leads to 
find who was responsible for the bombing in Centennial Park on Saturday morning. The FBI laboratory in 
Washington has examined fragments of the explosive device. They have been able to determine that the backpack, 
that was left to explode, contained three pipe bombs that were laced with nails and screws. It is believed that the 
device was electrically detonated with a clock timer. Each of the three bombs were ten-inches long and two-inches 
in diameter. One federal security expert, who is involved in the investigation, told ENN, &quot;It was a pretty low-tech 
device as bombs go.&quot;<br>
<br>
Clark Staten, ERRI Senior CT analyst and counter-terrorism instructor said that high on the list of suspects would be 
members of &quot;domestic extremist groups&quot; or a &quot;deranged individual or individuals&quot; who may have a grudge against the 
Atlanta, the U.S. government or the Olympics. Staten said that he believed that the explosives involved were an 
improvised device containing &quot;low order&quot; explosives, probably black powder or something similar. He also 
observed, in a live interview over the weekend with Channel 2 (CBS ) in Chicago, that it was unlikely that this 
incident involved international terrorist groups, as it didn't fit their methods of operation. He said Middle-East 
terrorist organizations prefered Semtex, RD4, C-4 or other plastique &quot;high order explosives.&quot; Staten concluded by 
saying that it appears that whomever committed this act is psychologically &quot;very angry with someone&quot;, as they 
diabolically included nails and screws in the bomb, in order to create deadly shrapnel and cause additional injuries or 
deaths.<br>
<br>
David Capitanchik, a British terrorism expert, said that the case was starting to look more like a domestic group that 
is opposed to the re-election of President Bill Clinton in November. Capitanchik said, &quot;Many of these people on the 
extreme right of the American political spectrum are very concerned that if Clinton wins the election ... this time he 
will really go for the guns and for these militia groups.&quot;<br>
<br>
Other sources are telling ENN that many investigators involved in the case believe that the bombing was committed 
by a lone individual. The FBI did not release any additional information about a suspect or suspects, or their motive, 
today at their afternoon briefing. An FBI spokesperson did reiterate a previously published affirmation, however, that 
they do believe that they will catch whomever comitted the Centennial Olympic Park bombing.<br>

<title>Dengue/Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever:  The Emergence of a
Global Health Problem</title>
<hr>
<pre><b>EID  Volume 1 * Number 2                                              April-June 1995</b></pre>

<i><h5>Dispatches</h5></i><p>
<h1><b>Dengue/Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever:  The Emergence of a
Global Health Problem</b></h1>
<hr>
<p>
<BODY>
Dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are caused by
one of four closely related, but antigenically distinct,
virus serotypes (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4), of the
genus <i>Flavivirus</i> (1). Infection with one of these
serotypes does not provide cross-protective immunity, so
persons living in a dengue-endemic area can have four
dengue infections during their lifetimes. Dengue is
primarily an urban disease of the tropics, and the
viruses that cause it are maintained in a cycle that
involves humans and <i>Aedes aegypti</i>, a domestic, day-biting
mosquito that prefers to feed on humans. Infection with
a dengue virus serotype can produce a spectrum of
clinical illness, ranging from a nonspecific viral
syndrome to severe and fatal hemorrhagic disease.
Important risk factors for DHF include the strain and
serotype of the virus involved, as well as the age,
immune status, and genetic predisposition of the patient.
<p>
The first reported epidemics of dengue fever occurred in
1779-1780 in Asia, Africa, and North America; the near
simultaneous occurrence of outbreaks on three continents
indicates that these viruses and their mosquito vector
have had a worldwide distribution in the tropics for more
than 200 years. During most of this time, dengue fever
was considered a benign, nonfatal disease of visitors to
the tropics. Generally, there were long intervals (10-40
years) between major epidemics, mainly because the
viruses and their mosquito vector could only be
transported between population centers by sailing
vessels.
<p>
A global pandemic of dengue begun in Southeast Asia after
World War II and has intensified during the last 15
years. Epidemics caused by multiple serotypes
(hyperendemicity) are more frequent, the geographic
distribution of dengue viruses has expanded, and DHF has
emerged in the Pacific region and the Americas (1,2). In
Southeast Asia, epidemic DHF first appeared in the 1950s,
but by 1975 it had become a leading cause of
hospitalization and death among children in many
countries. In the 1980s, DHF began a second expansion
into Asia when Sri Lanka, India, and the Maldive Islands
had their first major DHF epidemics; Pakistan first
reported an epidemic of dengue fever in 1994. The recent
epidemics in Sri Lanka and India were associated with
multiple dengue virus serotypes, but DEN-3 was
predominant and was genetically distinct from DEN-3
viruses previously isolated from infected persons in
those countries (3).
<p>
After an absence of 35 years, epidemic dengue fever
occurred in both Taiwan and the People's Republic of
China in the 1980s. The People's Republic of China had a
series of epidemics caused by all four serotypes, and its
first major epidemic of DHF, caused by DEN-2, was
reported on Hainan Island in 1985 (4). Singapore also had
a resurgence of dengue/DHF from 1990 to 1994 after a
successful control program had prevented significant
transmission for over 20 years (5). In other countries of
Asia where DHF is endemic, the epidemics have become
progressively larger in the last 15 years.
<p>
In the Pacific, dengue viruses were reintroduced in the
early 1970s after an absence of more than 25 years.
Epidemic activity caused by all four serotypes has
intensified in recent years with major epidemics of DHF
on several islands (6).
<p>
Despite poor surveillance for dengue in Africa, we know
that epidemic dengue fever caused by all four serotypes
has increased dramatically since 1980. Most activity has
occurred in East Africa, and major epidemics were
reported for the first time in the Seychelles (1977),
Kenya (1982, DEN-2), Mozambique (1985, DEN-3), Djibouti
(1991-92, DEN-2), Somalia (1982, 1993, DEN-2), and Saudi
Arabia (1994, DEN-2) (1,6, CDC, unpublished data).
Epidemic DHF has been reported in neither Africa nor the
Middle East, but sporadic cases clinically compatible
with DHF have been reported from Mozambique, Djibouti,
and Saudi Arabia (CDC, unpublished data).
<p>
The emergence of dengue/DHF as a major public health
problem has been most dramatic in the American region. In
an effort to prevent urban yellow fever, which is also
transmitted by <i>Ae. aegypti</i>, the Pan American Health
Organization organized a campaign that eradicated <i>Ae.
aegypti</i> from most Central and South American countries in
the 1950s and 1960s. As a result, epidemic dengue
occurred only sporadically in some Caribbean islands
during this period. The <i>Ae. aegypti</i> eradication program,
which was officially discontinued in the United States in
1970, gradually eroded elsewhere, and this species began
to reinfest countries from which it had been eradicated.
In 1995, the geographic distribution of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> was
similar to its distribution before the eradication
program. 
<p>

In 1970, only DEN-2 virus was present in the Americas,
although DEN-3 may have had a focal distribution in
Colombia and Puerto Rico (7). In 1977, DEN-1 was
introduced and caused major epidemics throughout the
region over a 16-year period (7). DEN-4 was introduced in
1981 and caused similar widespread epidemics (7). Also in
1981, a new strain of DEN-2 from Southeast Asia caused
the first major DHF epidemic in the Americas (Cuba) (7).
This strain has spread rapidly throughout the region and
has caused outbreaks of DHF in Venezuela, Colombia,
Brazil, French Guiana, Suriname, and Puerto Rico. By
1995, 14 countries in the American region had reported
confirmed DHF cases 
and DHF is endemic in many of these countries.
<p>

DEN-3 virus recently reappeared in the Americas after an
absence of 16 years. This serotype was first detected in
association with a 1994 dengue/DHF epidemic in Nicaragua
(8). Almost simultaneously, DEN-3 was confirmed in Panama
and, in early 1995, in Costa Rica (8, CDC, unpublished
data). In Nicaragua, considerable numbers of DHF were
associated with the epidemic, which was apparently caused
by DEN-3. In Panama and Costa Rica, the cases were
classic dengue fever.
<p>
Viral envelope gene sequence data from the DEN-3 strains
isolated from Panama and Nicaragua have shown that this
new American DEN-3 virus strain was likely a recent
introduction from Asia since it is genetically distinct
from the DEN-3 strain found previously in the Americas,
but is identical to the DEN-3 virus serotype that caused
major DHF epidemics in Sri Lanka and India in the 1980s
(R. Lanciotti; unpublished data). The new DEN-3 strain,
and the susceptibility of the population in the American
tropics to it, suggests that DEN-3 will spread rapidly
throughout the region and likely will cause major
epidemics of dengue/DHF in the near future.
<p>
In 1995, dengue is the most important mosquito-borne
viral disease affecting humans; its global distribution
is comparable to that of malaria, and an estimated 2.5
billion people are living in areas at risk for epidemic
transmission Each year, tens of millions of cases of dengue fever occur 
and, depending on the year, up to hundreds of thousands 
of cases of DHF. The case-fatality rate of DHF in most 
countries is about 5%: most fatal cases are among children.
<p>

There is a small, but significant, risk for dengue
outbreaks in the continental United States. Two competent
mosquito vectors, <i>Ae. aegypti</i> and <i>Aedes albopictus</i>, are
present and, under certain circumstances, each could
transmit dengue viruses. This type of transmission has
been detected twice in the last 15 years in south Texas
(1980 and 1986) and has been associated with dengue
epidemics in northern Mexico (7). Moreover, numerous
viruses are introduced annually by travelers returning
from tropical areas where dengue viruses are endemic.
From 1977 to 1994, a total of 2,248 suspected cases of
imported dengue were reported in the United States (9,
CDC, unpublished data). Although some specimens collected
were not adequate for laboratory diagnosis, preliminary
data indicate that 481 (21%) cases were confirmed as
dengue (9, CDC, unpublished data). Many more cases
probably go unreported each year because surveillance in
the United States is passive and relies on physicians to
recognize the disease, inquire about the patient's travel
history, obtain proper diagnostic samples, and report the
case. These data underscore the fact that southern Texas
and the southeastern United States, where <i>Ae. aegypti</i> is
found, are at risk for dengue transmission and sporadic
outbreaks.
<p>
The reasons for this dramatic global emergence of
dengue/DHF as a major public health problem are complex
and not well understood (10). However, several important
factors can be identified. First, effective mosquito
control is virtually nonexistent in most dengue-endemic
countries. Considerable emphasis for the past 20 years
has been placed on ultra-low-volume insecticide space
sprays for adult mosquito control, a relatively
ineffective approach for controlling <i>Ae. aegypti</i>. Second,
major global demographic changes have occurred, the most
important of which have been uncontrolled urbanization
and concurrent population growth. These demographic
changes have resulted in substandard housing and
inadequate water, sewer, and waste management systems,
all of which increase <i>Ae. aegypti</i> population densities
and facilitate transmission of <i>Ae. aegypti</i>-borne disease.
Third, increased travel by airplane provides the ideal
mechanism for transporting dengue viruses between
population centers of the tropics, resulting in a
constant exchange of dengue viruses and other pathogens.
Lastly, in most countries the public health
infrastructure has deteriorated. Limited financial and
human resources and competing priorities have resulted in
a "crisis mentality" with emphasis on implementing
so-called emergency control methods in response to
epidemics rather than on developing programs to prevent
epidemic transmission. This approach has been
particularly detrimental to dengue control because, in
most countries, surveillance is very inadequate; the
system to detect increased transmission normally relies
on reports by local physicians who often do not consider
dengue in their diagnoses. As a result, an epidemic has
often reached or passed the peak of transmission before
it is detected.
<p>
No dengue vaccine is available. Recently, however,
attenuated candidate vaccine viruses have been developed
in Thailand. These vaccines are safe and immunogenic when
given in various formulations, including a quadrivalent
vaccine for all four dengue virus serotypes.
Unfortunately, efficacy trials in human volunteers have
yet to be initiated. Research is also being conducted to
develop second-generation recombinant vaccine viruses;
the Thailand attenuated viruses are used as a template.
However, an effective dengue vaccine for public use will
not be available for 5 to 10 years. 
<p>
Prospects for reversing the recent trend of increased
epidemic activity and geographic expansion of dengue are
not promising. New dengue virus strains and serotypes
will likely continue to be introduced into many areas
where the population densities of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> are at high
levels. With no new mosquito control technology
available, in recent years public health authorities have
emphasized disease prevention and mosquito control
through community efforts to reduce larval breeding
sources (11). Although this approach will probably be
effective in the long run, it is unlikely to impact
disease transmission in the near future. We must,
therefore, develop improved, proactive, laboratory-based
surveillance systems that can provide early warning of an
impending dengue epidemic. At the very least,
surveillance results can alert the public to take action
and physicians to diagnose and properly treat dengue/DHF
cases.

<H2>Management Models and Participative Management: A Theory for the
Future</H2>

<P>
       Many authors and educators have discussed and compared
both traditional and non-traditional  EMS management styles. 
They have advocated various theories, and many different styles
are in practice throughout the country.  In recent years,
however,  EMS leaders have begun to question the  validity and
effectiveness of the more traditional methods.  Examining the 
following models will lead to a better understanding of the
implications of  some of the easily recognizable  "leadership"
methods.
<P>
<HR>

<H4>Model A: Military/Pseudomilitary Management</H4>
<P>

This system is characterized by methods routinely taught by the
U.S.armed services.  It is an autocratic system  with a
well-defined chain of command,  predicated on strict adherence
to  prescribed rules, regulations, policies, and procedures. 
The system is highly structured and does not lend itself to
change readily or quickly.  Communication between senior
administrators and entry level  workers is frequently severely
restricted by any number of layers of middle-level managers, who
filter any flow of information either up or down the chain of
command.  These systems also frequently place a great deal of
importance on rank insignia, uniforms, and other symbols of
empowerment.  The strengths of this model include continuity of
command, well-defined expectations for employees, a structured
environment and a generally well-developed disciplinary system.
<P>
<HR>
 
<H4> Model B: Corporate Image Management</H4>
<P>
   

The arrival of numerous private companies managing prehospital
care in communities throughout the country, on a contractual
basis, has begun to shape a trend toward conglomeration and 
corporate development   A typical example is the ongoing
practice of purchase of several ambulance entities by a major
hospital and private corporations.  While hospital-operated
ambulance services are nothing new in the world of EMS, the
recent trend of acquiring existing services to ensure control of
patient flow, within a community, is a new development. 
Corporate image management is sometimes an attempt to achieve
maximum utilization of emergency department personnel (nurses, 
technicians, and physicians), while maintaining control of
prehospital care.
<P>
<HR>

<H4> Model C: Laissez-Faire Management </H4>
<P>
 
This method of leadership is frequently encountered in volunteer 
and less tightly structured rescue organizations.  It is characterized by the
lack of a clearly defined  plan to meet the goals and objectives
of the group.  Laissez-faire management often falls  into the
trap of "management by crisis"; namely, the leaders of the group
react to  ongoing problems rather than take a proactive stance
and anticipate problems...
<P>  
Often standard operating procedures are passed from a senior
rescuer to a recruit and interpreted on an individual basis. 
The leadership of these organizations is decided by popular
elections that do not really consider the candidates' merit. 
The leaders, who are dependent on reelection in order to 
maintain their power base, are less likely to enforce existing
policies because they may  lose popularity.  This system seems
to have ongoing problems with staffing and continuity of control
issues.  This management style is also frequently tied to
dependence on fiscal support from various publicly elected
officials or boards, who provide for the financial needs of the
organization, when it is politically expedient.  The strengths
of this system are great flexibility, ease of change, volunteer
spirit, political empowerment, and democratic principles.
<P>
<HR>
<H4> Model D: Mixed Styles</H4>
<P>

The mixed style of management may seem to have taken the best of
several models and incorporated sound business practices into
the often chaotic world of  EMS.  But frequently, an attempt at
combining management methods results in a "cookbook" or
algorithm method of  controlling the behavior of employees.  The
difficulties involved in this method are that  various
preconceived strategies must be applied to any number of dynamic
 problems.  These prepackaged theories may  not be tailored to
specific concems.  While Maslov's hierarchy of needs, analysis
of personalities, and other management  theories may be given
credence in this system; they are all too frequently considered
the be-all and end-all answer  to complex leadership issues. 
The record suggests that this might not be the case.  The
strengths of this model include success if the proper "recipe"
is chosen,  adaptability, hiunanistic attitudes, and  leadership
understanding of employee  problems.
<P>
<HR>
<HR>
<H4>Participative Management/ Productivity Model </H4>
<P>
     

The critical assessments presented so far in this article are
intended not to criticize overtly any manager or EMS  system but
rather to point out  weaknesses and faults that may result in
ineffectiveness and confusion.  It is said  that we will never
live long enough to  make all the mistakes ourselves.  As
effective managers, we are responsible for leaming from the
mistakes of others.  In light of this attitude, I submit the 
following proposal for consideration.
<P>     
Participative management is admittedly a synthesis of several 
management theories.  Combining the best of several theories
with a variety of state-of-the-art ideas may result in a
leadership style that exceeds the capability of any single model
or previously conceived combination. The basic principle in this
leadership model is to involve all of the employees and managers
actively in a common goal.  This overall goal must be clearly
defined and understood by everyone.  It is best accomplished by
direct face-to-face communication among all employees and all
managers.
<P>  
On discovery of the well-defined goal, employees and managers 
must then set about developing secondary goals and rational
objectives to meet the group's responsibility.  Each goal or
objective is then given to a subgroup for study. These smaller
groups are commonly made up of employees and managers with a
particular expertise or interest in  the issue at hand. 
Employees or managers who are especially vocal concerning a
given issue might be included in the study group for that issue.
 Some typical examples of group topics include:
<P>
<HR>
<UL>
<LI>Communication/dispatch  
<LI>Disciplinary procedures 
<LI>Public education and information  
<LI>Equipment purchase and utilization 
<LI>Standing medical orders 
<LI>Standard operating procedures
<LI>Maintenance of vehicles and equipment
<LI>Wages and benefits
<LI>Continuing education and training
<LI>Promotional exams and policies
<LI>Specialized rescue techniques
<LI>Interagency cooperation
<LI>General management philosophy
</UL>
<P>
<HR>

<H4>Subgroup Organization and Management </H4>
<P>
    

Each subgroup should elect a discussion leader and a recorder.
The responsibility of the discussion leader is  to focus group
meetings, and the responsibility of the recorder is to present
an accurate record of the group's  activities.  Subgroups should
meet regulary for a limited amount of time.  An agenda for each
meeting is a necessity; agenda items may be referred by the
group or by members of the management team.  It is important for
the subgroup to present a consensus  within a set of previously
established  time constraints.  In other words, with each topic
comes a time frame for ultimate decision.  If necessary, the
group may issue a majority and a  minority opinion, but only
when a group cannot reach a consensus opinion regarding a single
issue.
<P>  

Participation in each subgroup should be limited to 15
members or fewer, to facilitate effective decision making.  An
odd number of members in each group will assist in establishing
majority  versus minority opinions.  It is imperative to include
medical control/medical advisory personnel in discussions
involving patient treatment and medical management issues.
<P>
<HR>

  
<H4>Management Participation  in Group Activities</H4>
<P>
     

Members of the existing management team act as facilitators within the groups. 
Each group should include a minimum of one staff member (a
middle or upper  manager) with a particular interest or 
expertise in the group's topic.  This  management person should
provide the  group with pertinent information and  resources
necessary to accomplish the  group's task.
<P>  

The staff member is not  necessarily the group leader unless elected 
by a majority of the group members.  Frequently, the group is better served by
electing a rank-and-file member as group leader, rather than a
management team member.  However, the assigned manager is
responsible for assisting the discussion leader in maintaining
decorum and maintaining a focus on the group's assigned
activities.  Additionally, the discussion leader, recorder, and 
management advisor are jointly responsible for preparing and
presenting the group's decisions and opinions to the Chief
Executive Officer (CEO) or Chief Administrator of the
organization.
<P>
<HR>

<H4> Consideration and  Implementation of Group Opinions </H4>
<P>
Upon presentation of oral and written reports by individual
topic groups, the CEO may do any of the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>1. implement the suggestions without further discussion
<LI>2. return the report to the group with specific questions
<LI>3. refer the issue to an appropriate staff member for further
study and discussion with the group
<LI>4. provide additional information to the group for their further consideration 
<LI>5. disapprove the group's recommendation and provide specific
constraints that prohibit implementation of the suggestion  
<LI>6. retain the recommendation (for a specific short period of time) for further consideration and study and advise the group of this delay
</UL>  
<P>     
Creative managers will undoubtedly discover other options that
correlate to situations in their particular systems,  but it is
important to ensure that the groups are aware of anticipated 
management responses to their recommendations and that every
report receives a prompt answer.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>  Productivity Within a Participative Management System </H4>
<P>
For participative management to assist effectively in the
management of an EMS system, it must foster communication among
all workers and managers in the system.  It is equally important
for the study groups to address issues of  concern to
management as well as the welfare of the employees.
<P>  

Prudent managers will refer appropriate items to each study group for
consideration on an ongoing basis.  Managers should assign 
time guidelines to each project to allow for an effective
planning process and should constantly direct their efforts to 
finding the most cost-effective method of implementing study
group recommendations.  In fact, one of the study group's
charges should be to prepare an economic impact statement for
each suggestion that is presented.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>Review and Conclusions</H4>
<P>
Nothing recommended in this proposal should be construed as 
a degradation or diminishment of the responsibility or 
authority of an emergency manager for the effective operation of his
or her system. This participative management style may,
however, allow for maximum communication and shared
responsibility within an EMS system.  Often, worker 
participation in decision making adds an additional dimension
to employee/employer relationships, due largely to employees'
perception they have a vested interest in the decisions that
have been  made and that they can have direct input into the
environment and working conditions surrounding employment in 
the EMS system.
<P>  
The employer's chief advantage is an ability
to share responsibility for difficult decisions and to obtain
continued cooperation and  input into the system's operation.   
This proposal will undoubtedly be refined further, and EMS
managers are encouraged to adapt the ideas in this article and
modify them to fit individual systems.

<TITLE>Chicago Gang Violence Escalates</TITLE>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 04/25/94-21:00CDT
<P>
<H2>Gang Wars Escalating; Youthful Assassins</H2>

Chicago, IL, April 7 --  As a court battle over "warrant-less"
searches continues in Chicago Federal District Court, the real
battle rages in the high-rise Public Housing Projects on South
State and Federal Streets.  Chicago is well known for it's
reputation as the home of "gangsters", but, the "gangsters" of
the 90's are not members of the Italian mafia nor bootleggers of
Canadian whiskey.  Today's Chicago "gangsters" are the purveyors
of drugs, prostitution, guns, and "murder for hire".
<P>

Chicago broke an all-time record for murders during the month of
March, and police think that many of these killings can be
attributed to gang warfare.  According to police sources, the
total number of murders in Chicago last month was eighty-eight
(88).  This contributes to an overall total number of homicides
for the year, which stands at two-hundred and twenty-one (221).
Police say that if the murders continue at the present rate that
Chicago could easily set a new annual record for the number of
Chicagoans killed in a single year.
<P>

Police intelligence sources say that the latest increase in
homicides is the result of gang "turf wars", as gang members and
drug dealers fight over control of given neighborhoods.
Residents of the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) Robert Taylor
Homes say that the drug dealers are actually fighting over
control of the very buildings that they live in.  During a
recent weekend, more than three-hundred (300) separate shooting
incidents were reported, in the vicinity of the Robert Taylor
Homes.  Fourteen (14) people were killed during the same
weekend, with twelve (12) of the fourteen (14) incidents
believed to be gang related.
<P>

While police admit that the increase in shootings occurs almost
every Spring, they also say that the number of incidents this
year is expanding, with a proportionate increase in murder
rates. Gang members, using high-powered semi-automatic and
automatic weapons, often "spray" a given street corner or
playground in hopes of wounding or killing rival gang members.
In certain neighborhoods on Chicago's South and West sides, gang
motivated "Drive-By" shootings are a common occurrence.
Unfortunately, all too often, bystanders and otherwise blameless
kids are caught in the hail of gunfire.
<P>

More amazing than the number of people wounded or killed, is the
age of the "shooters".  A Chicago Police Department
(CPD)spokesperson said that today's "gang assassins" are
frequently identified as 15, 16, or 17 year old black youths.
CPD spokesperson Billy Davis, is quoted by the United Press
International (UPI) as saying "you've got kids out there
convinced that they'll never grow up...that they'll die
tommorow...if their lives are worth nothing, neither is yours".
<P>

An purposefully anonymous police insider said that one of the
reasons younger and younger gang members are doing the shooting,
is because they will receive shorter sentences, or no jail time
at all for the commission of the same crime as an adult.
Juvenile gang members are often called upon by gang leaders to
conceal drugs and guns, because they know that juveniles will
receive more lenient treatment in court, if they are caught.
<P>

Secondarily, several recent psychological studies have found
that young minority offenders, often coming from single family
homes, and with low self-esteem, seem to show little or no
remorse for their violent actions.  Several sociologists suggest
that young people growing up in a violent atmosphere, subjected
to crime and poverty, and with poor role models, may contribute
to the "desensitization" that allows the unremorseful conduct
that results in many murders.
<P>

Also most important, in the view of some psychologists, is the
fact that the typical urban drug dealer or gang leader may
appear to be the most prosperous member of society in a given
neighborhood.  A number of stories abound, in regard to the drug
dealer or gang leader that gives money to mothers to buy
groceries, who sponsors local sports teams, and always gives
away Christmas presents during the holiday season. These same
people always seem to have the newest clothes, most expensive
cars, and to have the prettiest women attached to their arms. To
an impressionable youth, the drug dealer or gang leader is a
successful role model and someone they want to emulate.
<P>

Unfortunately, this same gang "leader" also teaches the use of
explosives and automatic weapons, how to smoke, shoot, or ingest
drugs, the proper method of "cutting" and selling drugs to
children, and how to force a previously addicted woman into
prostitution. Thus, career criminals teach juveniles how to
commit crimes, and pay them for their ruthlessness and avarice.
Those that enter into the gang system rarely ever leave, unless
it is in an expensive casket, probably paid for by the gang.
<P>

Police say that they have stepped up patrols in the gang and
drug ridden neighborhoods. And yet the killings go on. President
Bill Clinton has even gotten involved in recent days, calling
for Attorney General Janet Reno to develop guidelines for
constitutional "warrant-less searches" and "full-building
sweeps" of CHA buildings, where the shootings go on nightly.
But, long-time observers warn that this is only Spring, and that
the violence usually escalates as warmer weather comes to the
"Windy City". Unless some viable solutions are found soon, law
enforcement "old-timers" predict a long, hot, and dangerous
Summer in Chicago.

<H2>Riverside, CA SWAT Storms Halfway House
</H2>
<P>

A Riverside County, California, police SWAT Team, on Thursday, had to 
shoot and kill a gunman who invaded a halfway house looking to kill one 
of the policemen who was involved in the 1991 Rodney King case.  Before
being killed by police the subject, identified as 34-year-old Randall
Craig Tolbert, shot and killed a 67-year-old man, shot and wounded 
another man and beat a woman.  The wounded man only suffered a graze
wound to the head.
<P>

The 67-year-old male victim who was killed was only at the halfway
house helping to install a vending machine.  Authorities say that
former Los Angeles Police sergeant Stacey Koon was Tolbert's intended
target.  Koon who was sentenced to be a resident at the halfway house
was not there because he was having Thanksgiving with his family.
<P>

Tolbert burst into the Re-Entry Community Corrections Center in the
afternoon.  A friend of the gunman said that Tolbert wanted to kill
Koon on Wednesday night.  The friend said, "He was drinking ... and
he wanted to do it last night.  He just wanted to kill that guy.
Relatives of Tolbert were apparently able to talk him out of murdering
Koon on Wednesday night.
<P>

A resident at the halfway house described what happened after Tolbert
arrived there, "He had one of the staff members around the throat and
a gun at his waist.  The staff member started talking to him, and he
got out of the room long enough for me to get out of the window and
go call 911."
<P>

Riverside County Police arrived at the scene and within seconds of
hearing additional shots from the halfway house and hearing Tolbert 
screaming about killing someone else, a SWAT team stormed into the 
building.  A Riverside County Sheriff's Police spokesman said that
Tolbert "fired a couple of rounds at them, and then they returned
fire." The gunman was killed in the barrage of police bullets.

<H2>U.S. Dept. of Justice Provides New On-Line Statistics</H2>

The U.S. Dept. of Justice Statistics today announced that they are now making a large body of crime statistics available on a new government website.  According to B.J.S. Director Jan Chaiken, data sets on murder rates, drug usage, domestic abuse violence, gunsused in crimes, and prison populations will be made available at:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/"><B>Click here to go to the BOJ Statistic Database: www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/</B></A>
<P>
According to Chaiken, data will be available from the mid-1970s to the present time and additional information will be added the website on an ongoing basis.  Chaiken said that the new website was part of a larger goal to make government information instantly available to those doing research and studying issues of crime in the United States.

<H2>ANTHRAX IN A BIOWAR ENVIRONMENT</H2>
Sheldon Campbell MD, PhD  12/2/90
<P>
<HR>
The following document is derived entirely from the open medical
literature and my clinical (and to a certain extent, tactical and
political) judgement.  There are two important limitations to the following
data.  First, I am a medical microbiologist, not a clinical infectious
disease specialist.  Although the information is derived from an exhaustive
review of the available medical literature, and I doubt that an ID person
would significantly modify my conclusions, there's a limit to the
usefulness of knowledge derived entirely from the literature.  I've tried
to indicate places where this might be important.  Second, I have no access
to any classified information, nor even to much of the open military
literature.  Information on the nature of the potential biological threat
might supersede anything I say here. 
<P>
<HR>
<H3>DISSEMINATION AND INFECTION</H3>
It is expected that anthrax spores will be disseminated by the aerosol
route, causing inhalation anthrax.  Because atmospheric stability is
important to efficient spread, and because sunlight is highly toxic to
biological agents, they are most likely to be delivered at night.
Particles from 1 to 5 microns in size are most efficient in causing
infection, and can be present in clinically significant quantities more
than 20 km downwind.  The inhaled infectious dose in man is quite high (est
>3,000) -- nonimmunized workers in animal-hair mills have been shown to
inhale 150-700 infected particles/hour <=5 microns, but are rarely
affected.  The addition of detergents, irritants, or immunosupressives to
the aerosol may decrease the infective dose needed by up to 10-fold.  It's
likely that heavy smokers would be more susceptible, and to larger particle
sizes.  There is no data available on this, however.
<P>
<HR>
<H3>CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND DIAGNOSIS</H3>
Inhalation anthrax (also known as Woolsorter's disease) is a biphasic
illness.  The first phase occurs when the spores are carried to the
mediastinal lymph nodes by pulmonary macrophages and cause a suppurative
infection with edema and hemorrhage.  This phase is characterized by
nonspecific flu-like symptoms; mild fever, malaise, fatigue, myalgia,
nonproductive cough, and at times a sensation of chest oppression or
pressure.  Rhonchi may be heard with a stethoscope.  The presence of such
symptoms in a large number of personnel at once should raise the suspicion
of anthrax.  This phase can last for several days, or for as little as 24
hours in heavy infections, and can be followed by an asymptomatic period.
A helpful radiographic sign is symmetrical enlargement of the superior
mediastinum due to lymph node enlargement.  The disease is treatable in
this stage, but blood cultures are probably negative (no data on this).
Sputum cultures might have a higher yield, particularly if anthrax is
specifically looked for.
<P>

The second phase develops suddenly with the development of severe shortness
of breath and cyanosis.  Hypotension and shock occur.  The temperature may
be elevated or subnormal due to shock, and perspiration is often profuse.
Stridor may be present due to enlargement of the lymph nodes near the
trachea.  Chest exam shows moist, crepitant rales and signs of pleural
effusion.  Blood cultures are positive, and the bacteremia may be high
enough for organisms to be visible on a Gram stained smear.  The second,
acute phase typically lasts less than 24 hours and usually ends in death
despite therapy, due to the high number of toxin-producing organisms
present by this stage in the illness.
<P>
<HR>
<H3>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THERAPY</H3>
The standard therapy for inhalation anthrax is intravenous penicillin G by
continuous infusion, 50 mg/kg or 80,000 U/kg in the first hour, followed by
200 mg/kg or 320,000 U/kg over the following 24h.  No data are available on
the value on penicillin IM, but it would likely be less effective and
larger doses might be required.  Streptomycin, 1-2 g/24h IM has been
described to be synergistic in combination with penicillin.  An alternative
regimen is erythromycin, 4g/24h by continuous infusion.  In a biological
warfare situation, however, I would recommend that vancomycin be a part of
any regimen, in a dose of 500 mg every 6 hours.  Intramuscular injection of
vancomycin is painful.  An inferior but possibly useful substitute for
vancomycin would be oxacillin, methicillin, or nafcillin in appropriate
dosages (use the PDR).  Other drugs to which B. anthracis is generally
considered susceptible include the first-generation cephalosporins,
tetracycline, and chloramphenicol.  Adjuvant therapy with hydrocortisone,
100-200 mg/day may be helpful in the case of malignant chest-wall and neck
edema.  As soon as in vitro susceptibility data are available, therapy
should be adjusted to include effective drugs, and drugs to which the
isolate is resistant should be eliminated.
<P>  

In animal models, therapy for less than 2 weeks was ineffective due to 
persistence of infective spores in the lungs -- no data are available in
humans.  If antibiotics are present in limited quantities, the least ill 
patients should be treated first, as patients in the second phase of 
the illness have a poor prognosis even with effective therapy.  I do not 
agree with the recommendation of Col. Wiener (see below) of creating 
test groups to be treated each with only one drug to see which works.  
Unless communications and support services degenerate
to a point of complete chaos, in vitro susceptibility testing will provide
equivalent data more rapidly.  It is, however, appropriate to treat as many
people as possible with whatever antibiotics if limited quantities are
available.
<P>
<HR>
<H3>RATIONALE FOR THERAPEUTIC RECOMMENDATIONS</H3>
Some discussion of these recommendations is in order.  Most clinical
isolates of anthrax are penicillin-susceptible.  Virulent strains resistant
to penicillin have been described at least since 1970, however.  Because
penicillin is cheap, it is likely that any strain used for biological
warfare will be penicillin-resistant.  Most penicillin-resistant organisms
do so by producing beta-lactamases.  The oxacillin group of semisynthetic
penicillins are resistant to many beta-lactamases, thus the recommendation
of these drugs as an alternative to vancomycin.
<P>  
On the other hand, vancomycin resistance, except for a few strains of enterococcus, is
primarily a rare laboratory phenomenon.  In addition, vancomycin is an
expensive compound and it would be prohibitive to produce industrial
quantities of resistant organisms.  Thus vancomycin should be considered
the gold standard of empirical therapy in a biowar environment.  Similarly,
developing and producing a strain resistant to both erythromycin and
penicillin would more than double the cost and difficulty of producing the
bugs unless fairly sophisticated molecular techniques were employed.  If I
were running things for the Iraqis, I'd be using a penicillin-resistant
strain without any other modifications, since each piece of genetic baggage
the organism has to carry will have unpredictable effects on virulence, and
it's a very effective weapon already.
<P>
<HR>
<H3>EARLY WARNING, IMMUNIZATION, AND REFERENCES</H3>
<H4>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:</H4>
  Early warning is possible to biological attacks.
Radar can detect aircraft flying suspicious attack patterns.  There are
descriptions in the literature of air-sampling arrangements which can be
combined with microculture or immunoassays to provide rapid identification
of an attacking organism.  I have no idea what's currently being done --
can anyone help out here without betraying secrets?
<P>
<HR>
<H4>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:</H4>
 Anthrax vaccines are available and have been given to high-risk 
groups such as textile workers.  I have no data about what's going 
on in Desert Shield -- surely this at least is open information (it'd be hard to hide).

<H2>UNIFORM CRIME REPORT RELEASED BY THE FBI...</H2>
By: Steve Macko, ENN Managing Editor
<BR>
      Clark Staten, Executive Director
<P>

The Federal Bureau of Investigation on Sunday released its
preliminary statistics from its Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR)
Program.  This report includes crime statistics from law
enforcement agencies in the United States for 1995.
<P>

On one hand, the numbers were very good -- showing a two percent
decrease in overall crime in 1995.  This was the fourth consecutive
year of an overall decrease.  Violent crime categories, which 
include: murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, showed a
four percent drop.  The largest single category decrease was in
murder -- which was down by eight percent.
<P>

On the other hand, while virtually all crime categories were down,
theft showed a one percent increase.  This is significant because
it shows what is believed to be a future overall crime trend.  This
will be explained as we go along.
<P>

The greatest declines in crime were in large cities with populations
of more than one million people.  They showed an average of a six
percent decrease.  In cities with populations between 500,000 and
1 million -- there was an increase of one percent in overall crime.
Suburban areas had a one percent decrease, but crime in rural
parts of the country rose by three percent. This may also signal a shift in crime 
demographics from inner-cities to suburban and rural areas.
<P>

In regional parts of the United States, the Northeast portion of
the country had a very large 4 percent decrease.  Crime in the
Midwest dropped two percent and the South and West each showed
a one percent decrease. 
<P>

In the nation's largest city -- New York City -- overall crime
was down by almost 15 percent in 1995.  Homicides dropped by
25 percent.  Since 1991, the NYPD has almost cut the murder
rate by a whopping 50 percent.  In 1991, almost 2,000 murders
were committed in New York.  There were 1.170 homicides in the
city in 1995.
<P>

In a statement that was released with the figures, United States
Attorney General Janet Reno said, "Today's numbers are a further
indication that aroused communities and energized federal, state
and local law enforcement are working together to cut crime."
<P>

In specific categories -- forcible rape was down by six percent.
Robbery showed a seven percent decrease.  Aggravated assault was
down by three percent.  In property crimes -- auto theft was down 
by six percent and both burglary and arson had a five percent
drop.
<P>

Not all cities fared well in the report.  Atlanta, Georgia,
regained its title as the most violent in the nation.  Overall
crime in Atlanta rose by five percent in 1995.  A statistical
analysis of Atlanta comes up strange.  First, overall crime in
U.S. cities has been going down -- Atlanta went up.  In 1994,
violent crime in Atlanta showed a ten percent decrease.  The
numbers somehow reversed.
<P>

A further analysis of Atlanta's 1995 numbers shows that despite
186 murders in the city, the lowest number in ten years, it
still showed a statistical increase in violent crime.  Atlanta
outranked similar sized cities, such as Baltimore, Miami,
St. Louis and Tampa.
<P>

The numbers in Atlanta were influenced by a five percent increase
in forcible rapes.  There were 8,859 aggravated assaults in the
city and 5,260 robberies.  Thefts were up by 11 percent.
<P>

It is believed that crime in Atlanta's public housing developments
are driving the statistics upward.  Some of the housing projects
have become major drug selling points and a haven for street gangs.
A stronger effort to reduce crime in Atlanta's housing projects
will be needed.
<P>

Atlanta, however, was not alone in showing an increase.  Most of
the larger cities in the San Francisco Bay area also showed a
marked increase.  Violent crime in San Francisco was up by six
percent, but property crimes were down by eight percent.
<P>

In San Jose, California, violent crime shot up 12 percent.
Homicides rose by 14 percent and aggravated assault was up
13 percent.

Oakland, California, apparently was not included in the national
UCR report because of a software problem with the police department's
new computer system has delayed its reporting.  Oakland said that
a manual count showed a one percent decrease in homicides.
<P>
<HR>
<H3>Good Statistics; Uncertain Future</H3>
<P>
While many law enforcement officials, politicians and analysts
were applauding the statistics, other analysts were sending out
a warning.  Not included in the UCR report was the alarming rise
in violence by teenagers that appears to be skyrocketing.
<P>

The man who has been trying very hard to get the warning out is
the Dean of Criminal Justice at Northeastern University in Boston,
James Alan Fox.  Fox said, "We are facing a bloodbath of teen
violence in the years ahead that will make 1995 look like the
good old days."
<P>

Fox has said before and is still saying, "This calm before
the crime storm won't last much longer."
<P>

The number of teenagers will increase by 17 percent in the
coming years.  Between the years of 1990 and 1994, the murder
rate for teenagers rose by 22 percent.  Fox said, "Over the
next ten years, the teen population will expand by 17 percent,
because there are now 39 million children under age 10, more
than we've had since the 1950's when the baby boomers were in
grade school."
<P>

As previously mentioned, the theft crime category showed a one
percent increase.  This, according to Carnegie-Mellon University
Professor Alfred Blumstein, projects the anticipated surge in
crime committed by youths.  The increase in theft, said Blumstein,
"is the first glimmer of the impact of the next generation.  Because
larceny, such as bicycle theft, stealing auto parts and shoplifting,
is the crime of the youngest criminals.  The peak age for larcenists
is 15 or 16."
<P>

Blumstein added, "In the other crimes, what's going on among
teenagers is being swamped by much larger numbers of older
folks who are growing out of the high crime ages and giving 
up crime."
<P>

Analysts and several law enforcement agencies attribute the
decline in crime to the community policing program, longer
prison sentences for violent criminals, crackdowns on guns,
declining unemployment and just a plain intolerance for crime
on behalf of the public.
<P>

Criminalists at ERRI still contend that the greatest factor 
for the recent statistical decrease in crime is that violent
criminals are being locked up in prison for longer periods
of time.  Most criminals released from prison are repeat
offenders.  When they are in prison -- they can't commit the
crimes.  The prison population in the U.S. has tripled in
the past twenty years.
<P>

<B>ERRI also agrees with James Alan Fox and other experts that
say that a dramatic increase in crime is expected in the near
future.</B>
<P>

Professor Fox said, "Teens are not deterred by increased
incarceration.  They usually aren't locked up and most
don't think they will be."
<P>


(Ed. Note: The Emergency Response & Research Institute (ERRI) applauds law enforcement agencies and officers throughout the country, for their committment and hard work. We are sure that the reported reductions in crime are, at least in part, due to their diligence. We also strongly believe that having a larger number of them "on-the-street" also contributed to this reported decrease. And, we are sure that better vehicles and equipment, computerization, and community policing schemes have made our streets safer, in at least some communities.
<P>
We at ERRI will, however, continues to monitor changes in crime patterns, offenders, and crime in general, before we feel comfortable in declaring a victory in the "War on Crime.")

<H3>A BAD DAY "ON THE JOB"</H3>

By Clark Staten, EMT-P, I/C
<BR>

The shift had began just like any other day. You and your
partner had done all of the routine tasks that make up the
hours of sheer boredom that can occur in between the moments
of excitement that make up life of an EMT. As you are
completing the maintenance and inventory of your equipment,
the klaxton sounds and the speaker cracks;
<P>

"Medic 3...Medic 3...a man down in the factory at Ash Lane
and 3rd Street... a man down...Ash Lane and 3rd Street." "Got
that Medic 3", the dispatcher asks.
<P>

The station Captain grabs the microphone and says, "Medic 3
to a man down at Ash and 3rd...KXZ4413...station clear at
0914 hrs."  He turns and hands you a slip of paper with the
address.
<P>

You and your partner Anne head for the ambulance. As she
starts the engine, you begin to write the preliminary
information on the run report.  The radio crackles as you
pull onto the street adjacent to the station;
<P>

"Medic 3...Medic 3... a second report of a man down in the
factory at 3rd and Ash...that's a second victim...Medic 3".
You grab the microphone and acknowledge the transmission,
"Medic 3 got it...a second victim in the factory". You hang
the microphone back in it's socket.
<P>

Anne hits the "whoop" setting for the siren as you approach a
very busy intersection.  A large black Cadillac sedan blocks
your path by stopping immediately in front of you. Anne hits
the airhorn also, with little response from the vehicle's
occupants.  The elderly man in the Cadillac doesn't
acknowledge your movement until you pull along side him and
give him a sidesways glance. You continue with your response,
not giving it another thought... that happens everyday.
<P>

As you continue down the tree-lined avenue, you here the fire
radio frequency crackle to life; "Engine 10...Engine
10...respond to an EMS incident in the factory at 3rd and
Ash...that's a man down Engine 10...you are following Medic
3...got it..Engine 10?
<P>

"Engine 10's got it...dispatch...following Medic 3 to 3rd and
Ash for a man down".
<P>

"Gee...we even got help", Anne says matter of factly as she
guided the ambulance onto 3rd Street.  Normally, an EMT
engine or truck company was dispatched if the ambulance had a
long response time, or there was a possibility of multiple
victims. It looked like the report of the second man down had
prompted dispatch to send an additional unit.
<P>

Anne says; "Hey Mark, what do think we got on this one"?
"What do you think they make in that factory?", she
continued.  "Come on...Mark...you are in charge of this
thing...you are supposed to know this stuff", Anne laughs.
<P>

You grin at the good natured ribbing, think for a couple of
seconds, and say; "I don't know...did they say what was in
the factory?"
<P>

"Naw...they just said `a man down'...you know how that
goes...they never seem to be able to get enough information",
Anne replied.
<P>

"Well, we'll treat it like a cardiac until proven
otherwise...OK?", you answer.
<P>

Anne again hits the "yelp" setting for the siren as you pass
through a busy intersection about six blocks from the
incident scene.  She turns the siren off as you enter the
driveway into the factory parking lot. There appear to be
several people in the lot, most of them surrounding a door at
the side of the factory.
<P>

As you and your partner pull up adjacent to the crowd and you
roll down the window, a worker is shouting; "Hey you
guys...hurry up he's out cold...come on...hurry up!".  You
notice a man, covered with a blanket, lying on the ground
near the door.  Another worker screams; "He's not
breathing..he's not breathing...come on...hurry up!".
<P>

You exit the vehicle and open the side door of the ambulance.
Your partner has come around from the driver's side and helps
you to grab the drug box and cardio-gram monitor.  As a
secondary thought, you also grab an extra oxygen tank with
regulator and move towards the striken man.
<P>

Just as you arrive at his side, a man grabs your arm and
says; "My name's Paul Anderson...I'm a supervisor here...we
have another man down inside the plant...can you help?"?  You
look at the man near you and realize that somebody has rolled
a blanket and placed it under his neck as if it were a
pillow. You immediately remove it and hyperextend the man's
neck. You see his chest gasp, and he begins breathing.
<P>

That accomplished, you answer the supervisor and direct your
partner at the same time; "Ok...no problem...Anne, go with
the man and see what else we have...I'll go ahead and check
this guy out".  Anne grabs the "jump kit" and follows the
supervisor into the plant. You then begin to attempt to get a
history from the other assembled workers.
<P>

"Hey... any of you guys see what happened to him"?  "Anybody
know what happened", you ask the other men.  One of them is
coughing and says; "He was working with a truck driver on
filling one of the film processing vats and I think they
mixed up the hoses".
<P>

The man continued to cough and continues; "You guys got any
oxygen?....I'm a little short of breath myself". You reach to
grab the oxygen tank with mask attached, turn it on, and hand
the mask to the man who has been talking to you. "Here...try
this and have a seat...see if you feel better in a minute",
you advise the man.  Your mind begins to churn and you you
begin to realize that this incident may have grown larger
than you had anticipated.
<P>

You take the microphone from your epaulet and contact the
dispatch center; "Medic 3 to Dispatch...Medic 3 to
dispatch...we have another victim...give me a second medic
unit and a supervisor...trouble breathing...got that
dispatch?".  The dispatcher acknowledges your transmission
and asks; "Medic 3...can you give me an update as to what you
have there...Medic 3...an update for the alarm center?".
<P>

"Medic 3 to Dispatch...give me a couple of minutes..can you
give me an ETA on Engine 10?...they are responding?...right
dispatch?", you ask.  You then hear the dispatcher ask the
Engine Company it's estimated time of arrival on a speaker in
the nearby ambulance.  Events seem to be speeding up, and it
now seems important to get some additional help at the scene.
The engine company officer tells the dispatch center that
it's ETA is about three minutes, and that they had been
responding from the other side of their still alarm district.
<P>

"Medic 3...you have a engine company in three minutes, a
second ambulance, and an EMS supervisor responding...anything
else Medic 3?", the dispatcher answers. You respond; "Message
received...Dispatch...it looks like we have a total of three
victims at this time...I'll give you more when I have it".
<P>

As you hang your microphone back onto your epaulet, you
insert an oral airway into the unconscious worker, and note
that he is still breathing, with shorter inhalations than
expirations.  He accepts the airway without difficulty and
his breathing seems to improve.As you lean closer to him to
insert the airway, you notice a peculiar smell coming from
his clothing, but are unable to identify it.
<P>

A small internal voice breaks through your attention to the
man lying in front of you; it begins to whisper to your
consciousness, "There is something...wrong...terribly wrong
here...you better get some more help".  You dismiss the
rising sense of anxiety and return to concentrating on the
task at hand.  Just as you are applying an oxygen mask to the
man you are treating, a man stumbles out of the door where
the supervisor and your partner had entered.
<P>

He appears excited and out of breath. He shouts to you
in a slightly incoherent manner; "Hey...fireman...you better
get in there...your partner and Mr. Anderson are sick!". the
man slumps to the ground and is gasping for air. You begin to
hear the sound of an approaching siren, but disregard it, due
to the fact that the man said... your partner is down!  Your
little voice begins to scream at you, "You have to help
her...you have to get to your partner... you're responsible
for her".  You grab the oxygen tank and mask from the
astonished man who has been using it and start into the
building.
<P>

As an afterthought, you turn to the group of men that is
getting larger and shout to them; "There will be some firemen
here in a minute...you guys tell them where I went...I'm
going to help the people in the building".  Everything now
seemed to be moving so fast that it was turning into a blur.
<P>

You grab the microphone as you move rapidly down the aisle of
the factory; "Medic 3 to Dispatch...Medic 3 to Dispatch
...EMERGENCY!... give me an EMS Disaster Plan...
EMERGENCY!...give me a plan!...my partner is reported down...
a medic down...got it dispatch??".
<P>

The seemingly dispassionate voice responds to your frantic
plea; "Message Received...Medic 3...you are requesting an EMS
Plan...you have one Engine company on the scene, a supervisor
enroute, and we will fill the assignment with three more
ambulances and a Chief", the dispatcher answers.  You
continue to move down the aisle, now moving more rapidly,
glancing to the right and left and searching for your partner
and the striken supervisor.
<P>

You hear a muffled voice on your portable radio, and it
sounds like your partner.  The voice is unintelligible, but,
you hear the word "help!".  The odor that you noticed before
is becoming stronger but, you still can't recognize it.  It
does, however, somehow remind you of the smell of those
sliced nuts that your mother used to put on green beans.  You
disregard the distraction... you have to find your partner.
You begin to feel a little dizzy, and your throat feels dry,
but you attribute it to the excitement of the moment.
<P>

As you turn the corner at the end of the aisle, you hear the
Engine 10 officer on the fire frequency. The voice echos
through the relatively quiet factory; "Engine 10 to
Dispatch...we are on the scene...we have multiple victims and
what appears to be as hazardous materials incident...give me
a full Haz-Mat Response and a second alarm...got it
dispatch?".  You realize that the officer must be right, but
it is getting harder to think and you have to find your
partner.
<P>

Your vision is dimming, and you begin to feel nauseated as
you finally see three people lying near a large tank. One of
them is the seemingly lifeless form of your partner. Just as
you reach them and start to bend over to begin your
assessment of your partner, another wave of nausea washes
over you... and things go black.
<P>
<BR>

                   *******************
<BR>
<P>

A manager of the plant has met the engine company as it
arrives in the parking lot.  He had exited the building from
another exit and had walked around the block to the area
where the emergency vehicles were gathering. A second
ambulance arrived on the scene almost simultaneous with the
firefighters from Engine 10.  The manager advised the Captain
of Engine company that this is a film processing plant that
extracts silver from used X-Ray plates.  He also indicated
that the process can cause a production of Hydrogen Cyanide
gas.
<P>

The Captain asks several more questions of the manager and
bystanders. One of them volunteered; "The ambulance driver
went in the building...they said something about his partner
being sick, and he grabbed the oxygen mask from that
guy...(pointing at a nearby worker, who looked ashen and was
coughing)...then he ran in the building".
<P>

The Captain directed a firefighter to begin giving oxygen to
the man and shouted to the medics, who were getting their
equipment out of the vehicle; "You guys set up a triage area,
I'm going to send a team into the building to see how many
more victims we have!".  One of the Medics waved his hand in
acknowledgement and set about removing the clothing of the
man he had found on the ground.
<P>

Captain Hall slipped his microphone from the pocket of his
"turn-out" gear and entoned; "All units at the Extra alarm...
we have a report of Hydrogen Cyanide gas involved in this
incident...we are setting up the decontamination  and triage
area in the parking lot located to the north of the
building...bring all victims to this location...do not
acknowledge this transmission". "Engine 10 to Dispatch...did
you hear that transmission?", he continued.
<P>

"We got it Engine 10...you have a full Haz-Mat Response, a
second alarm, an EMS plan, and the Duty Chief has been
notified and is responding...need anything else Engine 10?".
"Negative..Dispatch...not at this time", the Captain
answered.  Captain Hall quickly turned to a truck company
that was pulling up on the scene and directed the Lieutenant
to "suit-up" in protective clothing and Self-Contained-
Breathing-Apparatus, and enter the building for rescue
purposes.  "We got people down in there...Lou...tell your
people to get the lead out!", the Captain ordered.
<P>

Chief Burns, who was on call, was arriving on the scene as
the Capt. Hall directed Engine 9 to set-up a hose line to be
used in the decontamination area. The Hazardous Materials
Unit arrived shortly thereafterward and began the process of
verifying the identification of the substance involved and
began working with the paramedics to develop a treatment plan
for the victims.  The firefighters began to wash the victims
that were already outside the building, as they continued to
receive oxygen by mask.
<P>

Firefighter Haskell activated the on-board computer in the
Hazardous Materials Van and quickly accessed a database on
medical care for the patients.  The EMS supervisor, Steve
Sweet, had arrived and was consulting with the Hazardous
Materials team and Chief Burns as the first medic was brought
from the door of the building. It was Anne Richards...and
with bad news...she wasn't breathing.
<P>

From the database, the medics quickly verified the
administration of amyl nitrate capsules with oxygen.  A
Medic, in complete "turn-out", broke an ampule, taped it
inside the positive pressure oxygen mask and placed it on
Anne's face. Simultaneously, another firefighter was removing
the striken medic's clothing and washing her with a downsized
hose that was connected to an 1 1/2" hose line".  As she was
washed down, another firefighter was wrapping her in a
blanket.  The same process was being performed on Mark and
the factory supervisor.
<P>

In the triage area, one medic was preparing intubation
equipment, while another was working on the preparation of
boluses of sodium thiosulfate (50cc -25% solution) and sodium
nitrate (10cc of 3% solution). As each of the victims were
grossly decontaminated, they were moved into the triage area.
Amyl Nitrate ampules were continually administered, along
with high-flow oxygen. The I.V. Drugs were given, as soon as
access to a clean vein was provided. The patients were
intubated.  Steve Sweet was on the radio with the appropriate
Trauma Center to receive additional information and
coordinate the movement of victims to area hospitals. The
rescue continued with decontamination, triage, treatment, and
transport to an appropriate hospital.
<P>
<BR>

                     ******************
<BR>
<P>

Fortunately, Mark and Anne both lived, although both were
hospitalized in critical condition for many days.  Anne is
now recieving a disability pension and Mark must make
periodic visits to a pulmonary specialist. The factory
supervisor was not so lucky; he had a previous heart
condition and although successfully resuscitated from the
cyanide poisoning, died later from congestive heart failure.
Three other workers were admitted to the hospital and
survived.
<P>

The effectiveness of the rest of the system's response to
the medic's lack of recognition was what made the difference.
Once the problem was recognized, and sufficiant and correct
resources were called to the scene, the incident was
adequately managed. The disaster involved a sense of "tunnel
vision" and "denial" on the part of the paramedics. After
all, they had reasoned, it had never happened before.  But,
as this story demonstrates...it could happen to you!
<P>

Please...Be careful out there!

<H2>YOUTHS DIE BY INHALING HOUSEHOLD SUBSTANCES
</H2>

By Clark Staten, Executive Director
<BR>
      Emergency Response & Research Institute
<P> 

Chicago, IL - A little known but deadly problem
is lurking in almost everyone's garage, cabinet, and cleaning
closet.  The source of this emergency is for sale in most
convenience and grocery stores in every suburb in America.
This menace takes hundreds, and maybe thousands of youthful
lives each year.  Most people have no idea of the magnitude
of the issue.  It has been declared one of the "gateway
substances" that leads to the use of "harder" drugs.  The
source of this scourge is Inhalant abuse.
<P>

A typical Inhalant abuser is 14-16 year old, can be of any
race or ethnic origin, probably abuses inhalant substances
with one or two friends, and doesn't understand what he or
she is "getting into", according to Catherine Macintyre of the
International Institute of Inhalant Abuse.  Macintyre says
that one of the biggest problems involving this burgeoning
issue is the fact that most people don't even recognize that
there is one.
<P>

There are more 1,400 known substances that are categorized as
capable of being abused by inhalation.  They include
hydrocarbons, nitrites, anesthetics, alcohols, and
halogen compounds.  Some typical name-brand substances
that have been frequently abused are; airplane glue,
Scotchgard, Pam, carbon-tetrachloride, gasoline, paint
thinner, Butane, "White-Out" correction fluid, color markers,
and other items too many to mention.
<P>

According to the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA),
while abuse of several other drugs may be declining
among younger people, inhalant abuse appears to be
increasing.  Dr. Neil R. Rosenberg, a neurologist from the
Colorado Neurological Institute at the Swedish Medical Center
in Denver, Colorado, was quoted in the Chicago Sun-Times as
saying; "They do it because either it's not illegal or
there's a law that nobody knows about or enforces . . . and
because it's available".  Rosenberg says that Illinois is one
of only four states that have laws prohibiting inhalant
abuse.
<P>

Ms. Macintyre, who helps Dr. Rosenberg to study the
neurological effects of inhalant abuse, says that most of the
substances that are abused are entirely legal to obtain and
possess and that they are "cheap" to purchase.  She says that
many adult's unfamiliarity with the abuse properties of
inhalant substances also contributes to the attractiveness of
them for youngsters.  Most of the products are readily
available and can be purchased at any neighborhood hardware,
hobby, convenience, or grocery store.
<P>

Often, teen-agers are abusing inhalants, almost in front of a
parent or teacher, without their knowledge. Macintrye also
says that youths of today abuse potentially toxic substances
because they "like the high" or feeling of euphoria that is
produced by them.  She also says that most teens do not
recognize the physical dangers that are associated with
inhalants.  Lastly, Macintyre fears that inhalant abuse has
become the "In Thing" to do in some neighborhood high
schools, and that "peer pressure" will prompt others to
experiment with it.
<P>
<HR>
<H3>Symptoms and Treatment</H3>
<P>
Dr. Rosenberg told EmergencyNet NEWS that many of the
substances are extremely hazardous to their target organ, the
brain.  They can be very damaging to irreplaceable brain
cells and eventually lead to various kinds of organic brain
syndromes, convulsions, coma, or even cardiac arrest.  
There are a variety of associated physical complications
associated with inhalant abuse. They include; cardiac arrythmias, 
suffocation, asphyxia, and unintended trauma.  Additionally, long 
term abuse of inhalants has been linked to damage to the optic nerve,
diminishment of cognitive abilities, and kidney, liver, and  bone 
diseases.
<P>  

Worse yet, according to medical professionals, is the fact that few
young people are successfully resuscitated following inhalant
induced cardiac arrythmias.  Statistically, most children
that suffer cardiac arrest are eventually pronounced dead.
Rosenberg said that some initial patient reactions to inhalant abuse 
can cause almost immediate death.
<P>

Treatment of inhalant abuse cases may be limited to supportive care and 
treatment of the presenting symptoms. Severe inhalant-induced agitation has 
been successfully treated with Hapoperidol (1-5mg. q 6hrs.).  Most EMS personnel
will follow standard treatment protocals as per the patient's symptoms. 
The use of epinephrine is generally<B> not</B> recommended, due to possible cardiac sensitization.
<P>

Caution is urged during transport as inhalant-abuse patients
may experience hallucinations and become combative.  Restraints
should be applied in acccordance with your local system policy, and as
per physician direction.  Sufficient personnel should assist with 
removal of the patient to the hospital to ensure the safety of both the 
patient and the crew.
<P>
<HR>

Two most difficult problems involving inhalant abuse
are those of recognition of the problem and funding for
additional research to quantify the issue.  Recognition of
the problem can be increased by adults being aware of some signs
and symptoms of inhalant abuse.  Some of them
include; intoxicated appearance, odor of a foreign substance
on the breath, "chemical smells" on the clothing, paint or
other stains on the clothing, confusion, muscle tremors,
chronic cough in the absence of disease or smoking,
visual disturbances, hallucinations, sores or rash around the
mouth or nose, severe headaches, convulsions, and possible
sudden death.
<P>

When asked about the total number of deaths caused by
inhalant abuse each year, Ms. Macintyre said that no one has
"exact" mortality statistics, because there is
no official agency that has the responsibility to track these
numbers.  Anecdotal evidence, on the other hand, would
suggest that this may be a major problem that hasn't been
adequately addressed.  At least four cases of known inhalant
abuse have caused deaths and media attention, in the Chicago
area during the past year.  Discussions with area paramedics
and law enforcement agencies suggest that many more youths
are using the legal, but deadly substances.
<P>

According to the International Institute of Inhalant Abuse
(IIIA), they are the only agency known to be receiving
funding for study of this enigma.  And . . .  they say that the
funding that they are receiving is only for the analysis of
the neurological effects of inhalant abuse, not for
prevention, education, or treatment programs.  Reportedly, no
other funding is provided by the National Institute of Drug
Abuse (NIDA) or any other federal agency to combat this
growing problem.
<P>

Experts hypothesize that as law enforcement efforts continue
to make the use of cocaine, marijuana, heroin, and other
illicit drugs more costly and difficult to obtain, that more
of our nation's youth will turn to "legal" inhalant abuse for
the "high" that they crave.  The IIIA says that they hope
that the public will soon recognize the dangers that
inhalants pose, and resources will soon be made available to
study and help to resolve the inhalant abuse dilemma.

<H2>Ambulance Company Explodes; 1 Dead, 2 Critical</H2>
By Clark Staten
<P>
(ENN) Early reports are being received of an explosion and fire at 
the Multi-Care Ambulance Inc. in South Amboy, NJ (Middlesex County). The incident reportedly occurred this morning between 07:00 and 08:00a.m. EDT
<P>

The explosion allegedly occurred while a mechanic was working on an ambulance, which subsequently exploded.  The resulting explosion and fire killed one person, the mechanic (possibly an EMT) who was working on the vehicle. Two others in the building are reportedly also injured and fire officials report them in critical condition.
<P> 

The MultiCare facilities were described as "a total loss", including all of the communications, operations, and billing offices.  Other local ambulance companies were alerted to expect overflow from assignments that MultiCare may now be unable to handle during the crisis. The incident remains under investigation by local fire and police authorities.
<P>

A Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (CISD) Team was dispatched to the scene to counsel other employees that may be affected by the death and injuries to their colleagues. ENN sends it condolences and prayers to the family and friends of the deceased EMS worker and wishes for a speedy recovery for those injuries in this tragic accident.
<P>

Special thanks to Matthew Streger for his assistance with this report.

<H3>DOJ REPORT INDICATES JUVENILE GUN OFFENSES ON THE RISE...</H3>
<P>
By Steve Macko
<P>

A recent study by the United States Department of Justice has found
that almost one out of every four persons arrested for weapons offenses
were juveniles.  The report also indicated that weapons crimes are the
fastest growing youth crime.  23 percent of all weapons crime arrests in
1993 were juveniles.  In 1974, juveniles made up 16 percent of weapons
arrests.  Between 1985 and 1993, the number of juvenile weapons arrests
more than doubled from being less than 30,000 to more than 61,000.  In
the same time period, adult arrests for similar crimes rose by about
33 percent.
<P>

The statistics don't get better ... between the years 1988 and 1992,
juvenile weapons violations increased by 86 percent.  That was more 
than any other type of juvenile offense.  There has been a dramatic
surge in violent youth crimes in the last three years.
<P>

On November 12th, President Clinton made a statement regarding the
DOJ study.  The President said that the statistics were "a chilling
reminder" that violence by juveniles is the top crime problem in the
United States.  He said, "Now is not the time to weaken out laws."
That last statement was made in regards for the calls of black leaders,
such as Jesse Jackson, who are calling for the reduction of crack cocaine
sentences because, in their estimation, too many blacks are being
incarcerated for the offenses.
<P>

Violence by teen-agers with guns has been rising steadily since 1985,
even though the number of teen-agers has declined.  Currently, there
are about 24,000 homicides committed in the United States every year.
Guns are used in the vast majority of the murders.  The number of
homicides has grown.  In comparison, there were 11,000 murders committed 
in the U.S. in 1961.  John Douglas, recently retired official from the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, where he implememnted the famed criminal
profile unit, said in a interview on Friday evening that it is expected
that the number of homicides will dramatically increase between the
years 2005 and 2010.  The main reason for the increase will be
sociological.  We are today sowing the seeds of the killers of tomorrow
because of the breakdown of values, families, religion and morals.
<P>

Attorney General Janet Reno said in the early part of this month, "If
the last decade's trends continue unchecked, juvenile arrests for
violent crime will double by the year 2010."  This month, the Attorney
General has allocated $8 million to six areas in the country that will
test various ideas for reducing juvenile violence.
<P>
<HR>

The statistics show a number of trends:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>-- Most of the weapons violations are committed overwhemingly by males.
It is more prevalent among blacks than whites.
<LI>-- In 1993, males accounted for 92 percent of the weapons arrests.
<LI>-- Though more whites, 55 percent, were arrested ... the rate of arrest
of blacks was five times greater than whites.  70 out of every 100,000
whites were arrested for weapons violations.  The figure among blacks
was 362 out of every 100,000.
<LI>-- The highest arrest rate was among male offenders aged 18 with 1,007 out 
of every 100,000 in that age and sex group.  The next highest was males
aged 17 with 858 out of every 100,000.
<LI>-- 81 percent of weapons offenses were made in urban areas.  That was
followed by 14 percent in suburban areas and 5 percent in rural.
<LI>-- A large percentage of those accused of weapons crimes were on
probation, parole, bail or had a prior criminal history.
</UL>
<P>
<HR>
-- In 1993, the five highest rates per 100,000 were:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>1. District of Columbia   301
<LI>2. Missouri                   199
<LI>3. Wisconsin                165
<LI>4. Georgia                   149
<LI>5. Louisiana                 142
</UL>
<P>
<HR>
  
  
   The five lowest rates per 100,000 population were:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>47. North Dakota  - 25
<LI> 48. Maine  - 23
<LI> 49. New Hampshire  - 16
<LI> 50. Montana  - 12
<LI>   51. Vermont  -  1
</UL>
<P>
The ranking Democrat on the House crime subcommittee, Representative
Charles Schumer of New York said that the recently released figures
are "frightening and show government at all levels isn't doing enough.
Thirty years ago, Americans wouldn't imagine 14-year-olds would have
easy access to guns."
<P>

Are more laws the answer to this serious problem?  Probably not.
<BR>
The answer involves better parenting ... how does one legislate that?

<TITLE>Fire/EMS Managed Care?</TITLE>

<center><B>THE FOLLOWING IS A REPRINT FROM THE
INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIRE CHIEFS
NEWSLETTER "ON SCENE"</B></center>

<Center>
<H2>IS MANAGED CARE IN YOUR FUTURE?</H2>
By Gary G. Ludwig, MS, EMT-P</center>
<P>

In one of my recent columns, I encouraged chiefs who do transport
services to start talking with the managed care organizations in
your area to form a partnership or to at least be included in the bid
on a contract for service.  Since then, I have received about 20
phone calls from chiefs who have begun discussions where the 
MCO was receptive and wanted to talk more.
<P>

Many commercial (private) ambulance companies have found this
lucrative, while still others have seen these this has an opportunity
to circumvent a 911 system for increase revenue.    Many MCOs 
or HMOs require their members to call their organization before 
receiving permission for treatment.  If that MCO or HMO has a 
contract with a commercial (private) ambulance company and 
have determined one of their members needs an ambulance 
transport, they will respond the commercial company who they 
have the contract with.  In some cases, such as Portland (OR), 
when Kaiser Permanente members call their HMO, it rings in the 
AMR communications center!
<P>

Other commercial providers have signed capitated agreements for
ambulance services.  Capitated agreements usually include giving
an organization a set amount of money to handle all ambulance
business, rather than a fee for each ambulance ride.  As an 
example, if a service signs a contract for $3 million to provide all 
ambulance service - any expenses over that you "eat" and 
anything under that amount is "money in your pocket."
<P>

Such was the case with AMR in January when they signed a
capitated agreement with Alameda Alliance for Health which 
serves 130,000 residents in Alameda County, California on 
Medi-Cal programs. Part of the contract calls for AMR to educate 
Alliance members on accessing an EMS system, including 
information on when to call - and when NOT to call 911.
<P>

The Galt (CA) Fire Department under the direction of Chief 
David L. McPherson, Sr. had a managed care agreement with 
Kaiser Permanente in Sacramento County.    After Kaiser 
approached them, GFD leased a vehicle and hired six additional 
firefighter/medics to make inter-facility transfers between 17 
hospitals and Kaiser HMO facilities.  The personnel and vehicle 
were dedicated between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. to Kaiser.  
However, after 9:00 p.m., the vehicle was located at the fire 
station, where they were available for Kaiser patients or fire 
district duty, even while being paid by Kaiser.  Kaiser paid $350
per transfer, plus $53 an hour.
<P>

Unfortunately, the program was controversial with some 
department members and was discontinued.  Surrounding fire 
districts are now looking at picking up the contract.  McPherson, 
also a fourth year law student informs me the California Health 
and Safety Code says they can contract with anyone they like 
outside their fire district, but the contract must be revenue neutral.  
According to McPherson, the state is taking money away from fire 
districts.  Chief McPherson can be reached at 209-745-1001.
<P>

Marion County (OR) Fire District #1 under Acting Chief Larry 
Beach and EMS Division Chief Roy Hari have been progressive in 
the managed care arena.  Beginning March 1st, MCFD #1 will 
begin operating a wheelchair van to augment the service currently 
provided by their ALS ambulances.  Wheelchair vans and 
convalescent stretcher vans will support operations as demand for 
fire service transportation grows.  The vehicles will be staffed by 
part-time EMTs, volunteer firefighter/EMTs, and college students 
who are EMTs as a career builder to the fire service.  The entire 
operation is funded by user fees with no taxpayer money. Either 
chief can be reached at 503-588- 6529.
<P>

Also, in Oregon, hospitals in Linn and Benton Counties have 
formed an alliance.  This alliance has approached the four fire 
departments in the area that provide ambulance service on 
managed care issues.  Although there are issues that still need 
to be worked out and finalized, expect a favorable outcome for 
the FDs.
<P>

In essence, managed care represents opportunities for the fire 
service.  Start networking with your MCOs before the commercial 
providers in your community do.

For Immediate Release: 12/03/95-09:00EST

New York City...
<BR>
<H3>JUMPER CAUSES MVA; TRAIN KILLS TRACK WORKERS</H3>
<BR>
By James J. Fay, ENN NYC-Metro Correspondent
<P>
In NYC and it's surrounding area, the Port Authority Police has jurisdiction at
the three major airports: Kennedy, LaGuardia, and Newark International Airport.
The Officers have bi-state law enforcement jurisdiction, and, at the airports,
are responsible for the Crash Crews. In addition, they patrol the infamous Port
Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan, the World Trade Center, the Holland and
Lincoln Tunnels, the George Washington Bridge, PATH Commuter railroad, and the
three bridges between the NYC Borough of Staten Island and New Jersey.
<P>

On Saturday, December 2, at approximately midnight, EST, Port Authority Police
were in pursuit of a robbery suspect that took place on LaGuardia Airport in
the NYC Borough of Queens. Officers chased the suspect off the airport-proper,
on to the 94 Street overpass of the Grand Central Parkway. The Parkway is a
heavily traveled highway that connects the Triboro Bridge with all major
highways to Long Island, and is a major route to John F. Kennedy Airport. The
suspect, who was not identified, jumped from the overpass onto the Parkway, a
distance of approximately fifty feet. This resulted in a motor vehicle
accident, with NYC*EMS treating eight patients in the multi-vehicle incident.
The perpetrator was arrested at the scene.
<P>

In another PAPD incident, at approximately 1415 hrs., EST,  two track workers
were killed, and another critically injured, when a commuter train from the
Port Authority Trans-Hudson Railroad (PATH),  struck them about an eight of a
mile outside of that railroads Harrison, NJ, station   The railroad connects
Newark, NJ, with downtown and midtown Manhattan, NYC., with stops in Jersey
City and Hoboken, NJ.  The Harrison Station is the first stop outside of
Newark.
<P>

The incident occurred in the vicinity of the railroad's Harrison repair shop.
Port Authority  Police responded with their Emergency Response personnel, as
well as their railroad Accident Investigation Team, and set up a crime scene in
conjuction with the Hudson County Prosecutor's  Office. The injured track
worker was taken to University Hospital in Newark.

<TITLE>EPA's Toxic Release Database</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<BR>
<H2>ACCESSING THE TOXIC CHEMICAL RELEASE INVENTORY DATABASE
</H2>
<P>

     An important resource has been made available to LEPC's and
public safety persons.  Community emergency planners, as well as
local fire marshals, can make use of EPA's Toxic Chemical Release
Inventory to learn of the presence of toxic and hazardous in
their jurisdictions.
<P>

     The Toxic Chemical Release Inventory (TRI) is a computerized
database containing data collected by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) under Section 313 (j) of SARA Title III. 
The TRI contains information on the annual estimated releases to
the environment of the more than 300 toxic chemicals regulated
under Section 313 of the Act.  The law mandates that the data be
made publicly available through a computer database.  The EPA has
implemented the TRI database through an interagency agreement
with the National Library of Medicine (NLM) as a component of the
NLM's TOXNET system.
<P>

     Many newspapers used information from the TRI database for
stories they published last summer about the huge quantities of
pollution being spewed into the atmosphere at various locations. 
USA TODAY is said to have purchased a copy of the entire database
to use in developing their story.
<P>

     The 1987 database contains information from over 74,000
reports from 18,000 plants.  The 1988 database already has
information from 85,000 reports and will not be fully online
until May or June of 1990.  Eventually, there will be five years
of data available online.
<P>

     Although the purpose of the report is to gather information
on toxic releases, the facility reporting is required to list
quantities of toxic materials on hand.  The owner or operator of
a covered facility must submit an emissions report by July 1 of
each year covering emissions released during the preceding
calendar year.  The EPA has developed a new five page form (EPA
Form R) for reporting purposes.  A covered facility is not
required to measure or monitor releases for purposes of Section
313 reporting.  Instead, it may use readily available data to
report the quantities of chemicals used and the amounts released
into the environment.  If no such data is available, the law
permits a facility to report reasonable estimates.  The EPA
provides technical guidance on calculating releases to assist in
making estimates.
<P>
<HR>

     A plant, factory, or other facility comes under the
provisions of Section 313 if it meets all three of the following
criteria:
<P>

     1.  If it conducts manufacturing operations (that is, if it
is included in Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes 20
through 39;
<P>
     2.  If, in addition, it has 10 or more full-time employees,
and;
<P>
     3.  If, in addition to the above, it manufactures, imports,
processes, or in any other way uses any of about 300 individual
chemicals and 20 categories of chemicals in amounts greater than
"threshold" quantities.  The threshold quantity for 1987 was
75,000 pounds.  For 1988 it was 50,000 pounds.  For 1989 and
subsequent years it is 25,000 pounds.  The effect of reducing the
threshold quantity level is to increase the number of plants
covered by Section 313.
<P>
<HR>

     TRI data are arranged in the following broad categories:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>  Facility Identification.
<LI> Substance Identification.
<LI> Environmental Release of Chemical.
<LI> Waste Treatment.
<LI> Off-Site Waste Transfer.
</UL>
<P>
    
TRI data includes the names, addresses, and public contacts of
facilities that manufacture, process or otherwise use the
reported chemicals, the maximum amount stored on site, the
estimated quantity emitted into the air (point and non-point
emissions), discharged into bodies of water, injected
underground, or released to land, methods used in waste treatment
and their efficiency, and data on the transfer of chemicals off-
site for treatment and disposal, either to publicly owned
treatment works or elsewhere.
<P>

     The TRI data can be searched in several different ways to
retrieve information on individual or multiple plants, on
individual or groups of chemicals, on specific or broad
geographical areas or various combinations.  In addition to
federal, state or local regulators, the TRI data is accessible to
universities, companies, activist groups and private citizens. 
Here are several typical questions for which the TRI database can
provide answers.
<P>

     "Who owns the XYZ Ice Cream Novelties Plant and how much
ammonia did the plant release into the air last year?"
<P>

     "My zipcode is 75220.  What toxic chemicals are being
released in that area?"
<P>

     "Is anyone releasing 1,1,1 tri-methyl death within five
miles of my home?"
<P>

     "How many above ground storage tanks larger than 500 gallons
capacity are being used for storing flammable liquids within this
county and where are they?"
<P>

     The TRI database can be a valuable resource to LEPC's and
public safety persons in locating chemical users within their
jurisdictions.  The Section 313 list is not as extensive as the
several lists of chemicals composing the categories of extremely
hazardous substances (EHS) covered in the reporting and planning
sections of SARA Title.  However, it represents a check source
for those who can access TRI.
<P>

     To gain access to TRI, a user must open an account with the
NLM.  An account with the NLM can be obtained by calling 1-800-
638-8480 and requesting the application forms for using the NLM
online services.  After an application has been processed,
requiring two to three weeks, a user will receive a user
identification code, password, telephone numbers, and other
information.  A TRI user may also access other databases within
NLM at various online charges.  The line charge for TOXNET is
about $25.00 per hour during prime time and $18.00 per hour
during non-prime time.  Line charges for other NLM databases
vary.
<P>

     A long distance call is required to access TRI. 
Alternatively, access can be via TYMNET, TELENET, or CompuServe. 
Citizens without modems have somewhat limited access to TRI
through regional EPA offices.  Information on specific chemical
release or releases by specific companies can be obtained by
contacting the TRI coordinator at the nearest regional office.
<P>

     In addition to online access, TRI information is available
on magnetic tape and microfiche.  It is expected to be available
on CD-ROM in about six months.  For further information about
TRI, contact:

<p>EmergencyNet News Service (ENN)<br>
Emergency Response &amp; Research Institute (ERRI) <br>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 13:00CDT </p>
<p><font size=5><strong>Terrorism; We Can't let The 'Bad Guys' Win</strong></font><strong> </strong><br>
Editorial Opinion - By: Clark Staten, Publisher </p>
<p>Chicago, IL, August 14, 1996 (ENN) -- Terrorism investigations continue in Moriches, NY, Atlanta, GA, Dhahran, Saudi 
Arabia, and in several other spots throughout the world. The ugly specter of terrorism has finally come home to the 
consciousness of America. The facts would suggest that the threat of terrorism is multi-dimensional, both domestic and 
international, and comes from a variety of political and religious tangents. It is a assault on freedom and free nations by 
extremists, insurgents, shadow warriors, and the geo-politically impotent. It is a war of surrogate engagement involving 
attacks by the &quot;have nots&quot; against those they perceive as &quot;haves.&quot; </p>
<p>In order to understand this increasing more dangerous problem, let's briefly examine some of the players on this world 
stage and the motivating factors behind their dissatisfaction and murderous attacks: </p>
<p><img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> Contrary to popular belief, terrorism isn't just about the color of a person's skin, their religious beliefs, or their political 
ideology. It's about fanaticism ...extremists who take any reasonable belief to an absurd conclusion and then justify 
abnormal, and often dangerous, behavior in the furtherance of their convoluted beliefs. For example, most members of the 
Islamic faith aren't fanatics, nor violent, nor uncaring, nor do they resemble any of the other negative connotations that have 
been attributed to them. The real problem of Islamic Fundamentalism involves only a very small percentage of zealots, who 
have chosen to undertake violent acts, allegedly in the furtherance of their religion, when in fact, they commit these acts in 
contradiction of their faith. </p>
<p><img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> Terrorism isn't about power in the conventional sense...rather, it may be about perceived powerlessness. It is a 
seemingly illogical response by individuals, groups, and even nation-states who feel minimized and relegated to a 
meaningless or inconsequential position in society. It would appear to be their dysfunctional way of responding to events 
and circumstances dictated by more conventional, mainstream, or majority events and thinking. It can be described as a 
small minority &quot;raging against the machine&quot; of organized religion, politics, government, or general societal norms. Terrorism 
is often spawned in overt repression, a lack of individual freedoms, or in an environment that lacks respect for minority 
viewpoints and individuals. </p>
<p><img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> There would also appear to be strong elements of greed, avarice, and &quot;coveting of thy neighbors possessions&quot; in much 
of terrorism that is occurring today. In many recent low-intensity conflicts, the motivating factors have involved a problem 
as old as society itself. This geo-political/economic struggle has been occurring since the first caveman killed his neighbor in 
order to inhabit a &quot;better&quot; cave. The age-old story is one of the use of violence to obtain control of more and better 
possessions, be they a flock of sheep, natural resources, a country, or an entire region. </p>
<p><img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> Finally, there are the anarchists, the sociopathic, and psychologically imbalanced, who are so angry and disillusioned 
with society and their own failures that they believe that the only solution is the complete destruction of all around them. 
They are the most unpredictable and difficult to combat, because they do not adhere to normal behavioral patterns or 
rationality. These are the mass murderers and suicide bombers of the world, people who attack school yards full of 
children with an AK-47 and blow up senior citizen centers, all in the name of whatever cause they have chosen. They will 
commit any and every atrocity in an attempt to cause fear and attain some sense of power. </p>
<p>Having reviewed a few of the motivations and circumstances relating to terrorism, the obvious question comes to mind. 
How do we combat this scourge and those that would perpetrate this viciousness on society? </p>
<p><img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> First, and foremost, giving in to feelings of desperation and fear plays into the hands of terrorists. That is one of their 
primary objectives...to propagate mistrust of public agencies, institutions, religions, governments, and societal norms. They 
want to create an atmosphere that suggests that citizens can't be protected and provided for by existing governmental 
structures. They want unmitigated fear to undermine our confidence in those we elect or pay to serve and protect us. </p>
<p><img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> Second, we should be aware that terrorists will use propaganda, misinformation, threats, intimidation, manipulation of 
the press, unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, and every other possible means to discredit the government and institutions 
of America and her allies. We must, collectively, therefore, maintain our belief in both our government and way of life. It is 
this unshakable belief in the &quot;goodness&quot; of our representative system and its inherent freedom that is our greatest strength. </p>
<p><img src="Bluebull.gif" align=bottom width=18 height=18> Thirdly, one of the greatest hopes of terrorists is that a government will overreact to threats of terrorism or actual 
terrorist acts, and implement repressive and draconian measures in an attempt to thwart the threat. They are hopeful that 
government officials will diminish individual freedoms, conduct extensive surveillance campaigns, restrict the press and free 
speech, monitor and outlaw peaceful public gatherings, and eventually fight &quot;on the streets&quot; with demonstrators and 
defenders of these liberties. The &quot;bad guys&quot; know that historically such tactics often prompt further dissension and 
eventually cause chaos and an attempted overthrow of any government that undertakes &quot;heavy-handed&quot; and restrictive 
measures. Terrorists would like nothing better...they thrive on this chaos, mistrust, fear, and hatred. </p>
<p>Americans can combat this ploy by working to retain as many of the individual freedoms, provided in the U. S. 
Constitution, as are practically possible. It must be understood by all that our 200 year-old system of individual freedoms is 
our greatest strength and our greatest vulnerability. Any changes to these fundamental rights and privileges, afforded to 
citizens, should only be made with the understanding and concurrence of the governed. While certain changes may need to 
be made to minimize any threat to the security of the nation, it certainly should not be done at the expense of the personal 
freedoms that make this country worth defending. To do so, would mean that the terrorists have won...we can not let that 
happen. </p>

Number G-10
<HR>

<B>PROBLEM: </B>    Word macro viruses are no longer an isolated threat, but they are     a significant hazard to the information on a computer.
<P>
<B>PLATFORM:</B>    Any platform that can run Microsoft Word 6.0 or later:
             Windows 3.1, WFW 3.11, Win 95, Windows NT, and Macintosh.
<P>
<HR>

<B>DAMAGE: </B>     Files can be deleted and may not be recoverable.
<P>
<B>SOLUTION:</B>    Scan all new Word documents before opening them in the same way     
             that you now scan all executable files before running them.        
             Install version 2 of the Microsoft macro virus detection 
             tool.
<P>
<HR>

<B>VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT:</B>  The vulnerability of systems to this type of virus is high,
   because most users are not in the habit of scanning documents.
               Documents are much more mobile than executable files in an
               organization, passingfrom machine to machine as different
               people write or edit them.

       <B> CRITICAL</B> Information Concerning Winword Macro Viruses
<P>

CIAC has obtained information about six macro viruses currently in the 
wild, five of which infect Microsoft Word 6.0 documents, and one that infects 
an Excel worksheet. Two of these viruses are damaging. This bulletin 
describes these viruses:

<B><I>WARNING:</I></B> The new macro viruses are not detected by the original
protection macro available from Microsoft which only detects Concept
(scan831.dot, see CIAC Notes 95-12). A new protection program is
available from Microsoft and most anti-virus scanner developers are
adding macro virus detection to their products. The new Microsoft
scanner is available from Microsoft at:

<H3>What Are Macro Viruses?</H3>
- -----------------------
<P>

A macro virus is a piece of self-replicating code written in an
application's macro language. Many applications have macro capabilities
such as the automatic playback of keystrokes available in early 
versions of Lotus 1-2-3. The distinguishing factor which makes it possible to
create a virus with a macro is the existence of auto-execute macros in
the language. An auto-execute macro is one which is executed in 
response to some event and not in response to an explicit user command. Common
auto-execute events are opening a file, closing a file, and starting an
application. Once a macro is running, it can copy itself to other
documents, delete files, and create general havoc in a person's system.
These things occur without the user explicitly running the macro.
<P>

In Microsoft Word there are three types of hazardous, auto-executing
macros: auto-execute macros, auto-macros, and macros with command 
names. There is one auto-execute macro in Word named AutoExec. If a macro 
named AutoExec is in the "normal.dot" template or in a global template stored
in Word's startup directory, it is executed whenever Word is started.
The only way to disable the execution of AutoExec is to insert the flag
/m in the command line used to start Word.
<P>

The second type of dangerous macros are auto-macros.
<BR>

     Name         Runs when you
<BR>
     ------------------------------------
<BR>
     AutoNew      create a new document.
<BR>
     AutoOpen     open a document.
<BR>
     AutoClose    close a document.
<BR>
     AutoExit     quit Word.
<P>

The auto-macros can be disabled by executing the Word.Basic command
"DisableAutoMacros" in a macro. Note that the example in Word's online
help of executing this command in the command line when starting Word
does not work. The command must be executed in a macro. Auto-macros are
also disabled by holding down the shift key while opening a document.
<P>

The third type of dangerous macros are those named for an existing Word
command. If a macro in the global macro file or in an attached, active
template has the name of an existing Word command, the macro command
replaces the Word command. For example, if you create a macro named
FileSave in the "normal.dot" template, that macro is executed whenever
you choose the Save command on the File menu. There is no way to 
disable this feature.
<P>

Macro viruses spread by having one or more auto-execute macros in a
document. By opening or closing the document or using a replaced
command, you activate the virus macro. As soon as the macro is
activated, it copies itself and any other macros it needs to the global
macro file "normal.dot". After they are stored in normal.dot they are
available in all opened documents.
<P>

At this point, the macro viruses try to spread themselves to other
documents, usually by including an AutoClose macro that attaches the
virus macros to the document and saves it. The macro viruses that cause
damage contain a trigger that starts the damage routines and those
routines do the actual damage. The trigger is some event that the virus
writer has programmed his virus to watch for such as a date or the
number of days since the infection occurred.
<P>

An important point to make here is that Word documents (.DOC files) can
not contain macros, only Word templates (.DOT files) can contain 
macros. However, it is a relatively simple task to mask a template as a 
document by changing the file name extension from .DOT to .DOC.
<P>
<HR>

<H4>DMV (Word) Macro Virus</H4>
- ----------------------
<P>

The DMV (Demonstration Macro Virus) virus was originally described in
the paper "Document Macro Viruses" by Joel McNamara who conveniently
infected the document containing the paper with the virus so the reader
could experience it first hand. The virus itself is simply an example 
of how such a virus could be implemented and does not attempt to hide at
all. The virus is not harmful and is relatively simple to remove using
the Tools Macro command in Microsoft Word (See below). The virus
installs a single macro named AutoClose onto the "normal.dot" global
macro file. The AutoClose macro infects all new documents when they are
closed. The macro does no damage other than to spread itself. When the
macro runs, it displays numerous dialog boxes telling you what it is
doing, making it obvious if you are infected.
<P>


<H4>DMV (Excel) Macro Virus</H4>
-----------------------
<P>

The Excel version of the DMV macro virus works the same as the Word
version but uses the Visual Basic for Applications language built into
Excel. The Excel document contains a macro sheet which implements an
AutoClose macro. When you close the file, the macro is activated and
copies itself to Excel's global macro file. When other worksheets are
closed, the macro attaches itself to them as well.
<P>


<H4>Concept (Prank) Macro Virus</H4>
- ---------------------------
<P>

The Concept macro (alias Prank) is similar to the DMV macro virus in
that it is a demonstration that a macro virus can be created. A 
document infected with the Concept virus contains the macros:
<P>

          AAAZAO     AutoOpen
<BR>
          AAAZFS     Payload
<P>

When an infected file is opened, the AutoOpen macro is run and copies
the virus files to the global macro file. During the copying process it
changes the name of AAAZFS to FileSaveAs. Whenever a document is saved,
the FileSaveAs command copies the virus macros into it and saves it. 
The AAAZAO macro becomes the AutoOpen macro on the saved document file. The
Payload macro does nothing. The first time the macro runs a dialog box
appears with the single digit "1" contained in it.
<P>


<H4>Nuclear Macro Virus</H4>
- -------------------
<P>

A document infected with the Nuclear macro virus contains nine macros:
<P>

          AutoExec        AutoOpen        DropSuriv
<BR>
          FileExit        FilePrint       FilePrintDefault
<BR>
          FileSaveAs      InsertPayload   Payload
<P>

All of these are copied to the global macro file when an infected
document is opened. When any document is saved, the virus copies all 
the macros onto it and saves it. Printing a document during the last 5
seconds of any minute causes the following text to appear at the top of
the printed page:
<P>

"And finally I would like to say:"
<BR>

"STOP ALL FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC!"
<P>

After April 5th it attempts to delete your system files but fails
because of a bug in the virus. The virus also attempts to infect a
system with the Suriv binary virus, but fails again because of a bug.
<P>


<H4>Colors Macro Virus</H4>
------------------
<P>

A document infected with the Colors virus contains the following eight
macros:
<P>

          AutoClose        AutoExec        AutoOpen
<BR>
          FileExit         FileNew         FileSave
<BR>
          FileSaveAs       ToolsMacro
<P>

The virus changes many of the menu items to make it difficult to 
delete. For example, it effectively removes the Tools Macros command so you
can't list or delete the macros in a program with that command.
<P>

After being accessed 300 times, Colors activates and randomly changes
the system colors in the win.ini file making the screen look strange.
<P>


<H4>FormatC Macro Virus</H4>
-------------------
<P>

The FormatC macro virus consists of a single macro named AutoOpen.
Opening an infected document causes this macro to run and the macro
copies itself to the global macro file. If the viruses payload is
activated, it attempts to format the C: drive.
<P>

<B>WARNING:</B> the format command in most modern versions of DOS can be
reversed. If this virus strikes, get some knowledgeable help before
doing anything to your system. Don't do anything that might write
something on the hard drive until you get knowledgeable help. You may
need only boot from a floppy and run unformat to recover the whole
drive. What you do depends on what utility programs (Norton Utilities,
PCTools, and so forth) you have installed on your system.
<P>


<H4>Wordmacro/Hot</H4>
----------------
<P>

A new Word macro virus just appeared in the wild named Wordmacro/Hot 
and it is destructive. The Wordmacro/Hot virus attaches itself like the
others, adding macros to documents and to the "normal.dot" global macro
file. New documents are infected when they are saved. After about 14
days, the virus deletes the contents of any document as you open it and
does a save which effectively wipes out the document. It is unlikely
that you will be able to recover the contents of a file deleted in this
way unless you have Make Backup turned on. Don't start opening the
backup copies before cleaning the virus, because it will clear the
contents of every document you open while it is active.
<P>

An infected document contains the following macros:
<P>

   AutoOpen     DrawBringInFrOut     InsertPBreak     ToolsRepaginat
<P>

When the virus infects the Word program, these macros are copied to
"normal.dot" and renamed in the same order to:
<P>

   StartOfDoc   AutoOpen             InsertPageBreak  FileSave
<P>

The virus adds the item: "OLHot=nnnnn" to the winword.ini file where
nnnnn is a date 14 days in the future. The virus uses this date to
determine when it is going to trigger. The virus also checks for the
existence of the file: "c:\dos\ega5.cpi" and does not infect a machine
if the file exists. This was apparently a feature to protect the virus
writer.
<P>
<HR>


<H4>Detecting A Macro Virus</H4>
-----------------------
<P>

Document files must now be treated in the same manner as executables in
terms of virus protection. If you don't know where a Word document has
been, scan it before opening it with Word. Most anti-virus scanners 
have been modified to detect macro viruses in Word documents, so use those
scanners to check any new documents that have been copied onto your
machine. For example, version 2.21 of the shareware version of F-Prot
detects all but the FormatC and Hot viruses.
<P>

Microsoft has released a new version of its macro virus protection
program (see below) that checks all Word documents as you open them and
tells you if they contain a macro or not. It can only detect the 
Concept virus by name, but any document with a macro attached should be
considered suspect.
<P>

You can use the Organizer dialog box (see below) to check for strange
macros attached to your documents. The Organizer can open a document in
the background (without running any attached macros) and let you see
what macros are attached to it. You can also use it to delete macros
from a document.
<P>

You can watch for virus activity when opening or saving a document, but
it is generally preferable to detect a virus before it gets installed.
If you have already opened a document that suspect has a virus, use the
Tools Macro command to see a list of the macros attached to Word. If 
you can't open the Macro dialog box, try the Organizer dialog box instead.
<P>
<HR>


<H4>Protecting A System From Macro Viruses</H4>
----------------------------------
<P>

A feature of Microsoft's products is that automatic execution of auto-
macros and auto-execute macros is enabled by default. In fact, it is
difficult to turn off. This is a problem in protecting against macro
viruses.
<P>

Currently, the best protection is to install Microsoft's macro virus
protection template. The template is available directly from 
Microsoft's web site or from the CIAC archive. A description of the scanner is
available at:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/msoffice/freestuf/msword/download/mvtools/mvtools2.htm">Click here to go to Microsoft Tools</A>
<BR>http://www.microsoft.com/msoffice/freestuf/msword/download/mvtool/mvtool2.htm
<P>

and the scanner itself is available at:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/msoffice/freestuf/msword/mvtools/mvtool20.exe">Get the scanner itself</A>
<BR>
http://www.microsoft.com/msoffice/freestuf/
              msword/download/mvtool/mvtool20.exe
<P>

If you don't find these files at microsoft.com, it could be that the
scanner has been revised again. In that case, connect to:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">Go to the Microsoft Website</A>
<BR>
http://www.microsoft.com
<P>
and use the search command to search for "macro virus".
<P>

To install the macro virus protection, simply open the template file
with Word and follow the instructions. The macros automatically install
themselves in your global macro file (just like the virus). A protected
version of Word should have the following four macros are attached to
the "normal.dot" file:
<P>

        AutoExit     FileOpen     InstVer    ShellOpen
<P>

FileOpen calls ShellOpen whenever a document is opened. ShellOpen 
checks each newly opened document to see if it has any macros attached. If
there are macros in the document that is being opened, ShellOpen
displays a dialog box giving you the choice to open the document 
anyway, remove the macros and open it, or cancel the open command.
<P>

If, for some reason, you can't use Microsoft's protection macro, you 
can disable auto-macros. 
<BR>You have three options:
<P>

1. Disable the auto-macros.
<BR>
2. Disable the auto-macros and the auto-execute macro.
<BR>
3. Hold down Shift whenever you open a file to disable the AutoOpen
   macro.
<P>

To disable auto-macros, create the following macro named AutoExec in 
the global macro file (normal.dot).
<P>

MAIN
<BR>
   DisableAutoMacros 1
<BR>
   MsgBox "Auto-macros are disabled."
<BR>
End Sub
<P>

All auto-macros are disabled but a virus could still infect a system if
it is activated by a command that replaces a normal command.
<P>

To disable auto-macros and the auto-execute macro, create the following
macro in the global macro file (normal.dot) and name it
"DisableMyAutoMacros".
<P>

MAIN
<BR>
   DisableAutoMacros 1
<BR>
   MsgBox "Auto-macros are disabled."
<BR>
End Sub
<P>

In the Program Manager or the Explorer in Windows 95, select the Word
icon and choose the Properties command on the File menu. Add the
following switch to the command line for Word.
<P>

/mDisableMyAutoMacros
<P>

This command disables the AutoExec macro and runs the
DisableMyAutoMacros procedure when Word starts up. Again, this does not
disable macros with command names from replacing the commands. This 
also only works if you start Word by double clicking on the Word icon. If 
you start Word by double clicking on a document, it will not see the switch
and will not run the DisableMyAutoMacros procedure.
<P>

When you hold down the Shift key while opening or double clicking a
document, the AutoOpen macro is prevented from running. Other auto-
macros may still run so you must check for a virus before doing 
anything else.
<P>

<B>WARNING:</B> The three methods of disabling auto-macros and the 
auto-execute macro do not fully protect you from a virus. While they prevent the
auto-execute and auto-macro commands from running, they do not prevent
any macros named the same as commands from replacing those commands. 
Any virus that uses replaced commands to initiate an infection will not be
stopped. Only an external scanner or the Microsoft template will detect
a document containing macros before it is opened.
<P>
<HR>

<H4>Removing Macro Viruses</H4>
----------------------
<P>

If you have an anti-virus scanner which detects and removes a macro
virus, use it instead of trying to do it by hand. The scanner will
generally do the job and is much easier than removing the virus by 
hand.
<P>

If you have Microsoft's virus macro protection installed, it will give
you the option to remove any attached macros when you open the 
document. If you save the document with the same name, it will overwrite the
infected document.
<P>

If you don't have a scanner or the protection macro, you can use the
Organizer to find and remove macro viruses without infecting your
system. The first step is to start Word and open the Organizer dialog
box. There are two ways to open the Organizer: 
<P>
1. use the Tools Macro command and press the Organizer button; 
<P>
2. use the File Templates command and press the Organizer button. 
<BR>In the Organizer dialog box
click the macros tab,
<BR> click the Open File button, 
<BR>select the infected
document and click OK. 
<BR>Back in the Organizer dialog box, select all the
macros listed in the file and click the Delete button to remove them.
<BR>
Click the Close File button to close and save the file. The file can 
now be opened normally.
<P>

If you have just infected yourself by opening an infected document,
don't close the document or quit Word. If you close the infected file 
or quit Word, you run the risk of running another of the auto-execute
macros. See if you can get to the Organizer dialog box. Once in the
Organizer you can delete the virus macros from the infected document 
and from the "normal.dot" file. Save those files, quit Word and restart it.
You can then use the Organizer to check other documents for a virus
infection.
<P>

If you can't get to the Organizer, quit Word without saving anything,
find the "normal.dot" file and delete it. When you restart Word, it 
will create a new, empty "normal.dot" file. Note that you will also lose any
custom styles which were stored in the "normal.dot" file and will have
to redefine them.
<P>
<HR>


<H3>On The Macintosh</H3>
----------------
<P>

These macro viruses will run under Word 6 on the Macintosh, but most of
the file access capability used by the viruses to damage a system will
not work well. This is because file naming conventions on the Macintosh
are different from those on other systems. Since the damaging parts of
the viruses are written with a DOS-based file system in mind, it is
unlikely that they will work.
<P>
<HR>


<H4>Macro Viruses and E-Mail Messages</H4>
--------------------------------
<P>

Many rumors have been circulated around the network about there being 
an e-mail message that destroys your system when you read it (Good Times).
This can not happen with the current batch of mail readers. While an
infected document could be attached to an e-mail message and would be
downloaded to your disk when you read the attached message, it will not
automatically be executed. As long as it has not been executed or read,
it can not infect your system with a virus. At this point, you should
scan it to make sure it is not infected.

<H3>Conclusions</H3>
---------------------------
<P>

Macro viruses are here to stay and we must deal with them in the same
manner that we have had to deal with other viruses. If you don't know
where a file has been, don't use it in your computer until you scan it.
That is, if it is an executable, don't run it; if it is a document,
don't open it. It does not matter how you obtained the file, whether it
is a download from a BBS or web site, an attachment to an e-mail
message, or a shrink-wrapped package from a commercial developer, scan
them all. Even blank, preformatted disks are occasionally showing up
with viruses.
<P>

The second thing to do is to install the Microsoft macro virus
protection template to warn you if a document contains macros before 
you open it.
<P>

Keep in mind that while Microsoft products are being targeted by these
viruses, they are not the only products which have a macro capability
which could be exploited. Hopefully, in the next release of software
programs which include extensive macro capabilities, there will be an
easy way to disable macro execution and warn the user if documents
contain macros. This change will make the problem of macro viruses go
away very quickly.

<H2>ERRI ASSESSMENT OF CHINESE MILITARY CAPABILITY...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

Military analysts have given the Emergency Response and Research
Institute in Chicago a detailed assessment of the capabilities of
the Chinese military.  A first look, on paper, would show that
China has a very large military advantage over the island of
Taiwan. 
<P> 

China considers Taiwan a renegade provinceand thus a territory to be subjagated to
domination by Bejing.  For the most part, Taiwan, even though it is 
economically very powerful in Asia, is not officially recognized 
as a completely independent country in the world.  And,
China is VERY interested in keeping it that way.
<P>

China has nearly ten times the armed forces of Taiwan.  Ten times
the number of fighter aircraft.  Twice the number of warships and
even has an arsenal of missiles and nuclear warheads.
But even though China has greater numbers -- military analysts say
that the Chinese military has very serious shortcomings.  Analysts
do not believe that China has the capability to launch a D-Day type
invasion of Taiwan.  China is also not considered to pose any kind
of a major direct threat to the United States, now or anytime in the
near future.
<P>

As the military exercises continue in the Taiwan Straits, people
are nervous and U.S. military and intelligence is keeping a very
watchful eye on what the Chinese are doing.  However, most U.S. 
Department of Defense officials and other military analysts believe
that if China were to start a shooting war -- it would face serious
military limitations.
<P>

In a recent study conducted by the United States Department of
Defense, China's military was assessed this way: "The People's
Liberation Army is the world's largest fighting force.  Its
weaponry, however, consists mostly of outdated equipment, and
its troops are not well-trained in the tactics of modern warfare."
<P>

Even though China has a three-million-member force, it does not
have the ability to rapidly deploy its troops either by air or
by sea.  All military analysts contacted by ERRI said that they
are VERY skeptical of the actual fighting abilities of Chinese
forces and would probably rank them no higher than the ability
of Iraqi forces prior to the Gulf War.
<P>

Since the Gulf War concluded, most high-ranking U.S. military
commanders, such as General Colin Powell and General H. Norman
Schwarzkopf, had said that they were quite shocked at how poorly 
trained the Iraqi forces were compared to U.S. forces.
<P>

U.S. intelligence estimates indicate that China's warplanes and
weapons are, for the most part, ten to twenty years behind
current technology.
<P>

While China does seem to have some very serious shortcomings
militarily -- it is still capable of causing some serious harm
to Taiwan.  China could resort to missile terrorism as Iraq did
during the Gulf War or it could attempt to blockade or mine
Taiwan's seaports and grind the island's economy to a halt.
<P>

On the technological side, Taiwan is ahead of China in several
areas.  Taiwan is expecting to soon receive a large order of 150
U.S. F-16 and French Mirage 2000 jet fighters.  New naval
frigates are on the way and a new, improved air defense system.
Taiwan is also making improvements to its ground-force capabilites.
So, in many areas, Taiwan does have an advantage over China.
However, one expert at the Institute for National Strategic Studies
said, "If China were to launch a war of attrition against Taiwan,
China could eventually prevail, at a very high cost."
<P>

U.S. government officials, however, do not believe that the situation
will come to that assessment.  Last week, U.S. officials reportedly
were very blunt to a senior Chinese official and warned that there
would be very serious consequences if China decided to use force
against Taiwan.
<P>

Currently, the United States intelligence apparatus is in high-gear
while monitoring the situation that is occurring in the Taiwan
Straits.  The U.S. is using such things as spy satellites and
spy ships to watch the Chinese and provide an early warning should
the Beijing government decides it wants to risk a move against
Taiwan or the islands of Quemoy and Matsu, which are located just
off the coast of the mainland.  Both islands have heavily armed
troops stationed on them.
<P>

China for the past ten years or so has been trying to increase its
military spending.  But most of the increased spending has gone to
improve the pay and living standards of its troops and to keep pace
with inflation. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) has also been attempting to
shift itself from a very large defensive army to an army that is
capable of fighting limited scale regional wars under modern
conditions. Many people think that China is an emerging superpower -- but
military experts say that it still has a very long way to go
before it can be considered as one.
<P>

Some very interesting points were recently made by David Shambaugh
of the University of London.  Mr. Shambaugh is currently writing a
book about the Chinese military.  Shambaugh said that it will be
at least twenty years or more before China will have the necessary
airlift and sealift capability to rapidly deploy its troops.
<P>

More interesting was the Chinese military reactions to the high-tech
war that was waged by the United States on Iraq in the Gulf War.  The
Chinese military leaders were said to be "stunned" and "every element
of the allied strategy left the PLA aghast and hammered home as never
before the backwardness of the PLA."
<P>

As an example, Chinese fighter pilots might expect to go up against
U.S. fighter pilots in air battles.  Chinese pilots fly only about
half the the training hours logged monthly by U.S. pilots.  The
Chinese Air Force relies almost entirely on Soviet-designed aircraft
from the 1950's that were re-engineered, modified and reproduced by
the Chinese themselves in the 1960's and 1970's.  Putting it mildly,
any air battles would probably be called "turkey shoots" by U.S.
fighter pilots. Another problem for the Chinese is their ability to maintain high-
technological aircraft such as the 24 Russian Su-27s that they
purchased in 1992.
<P>

The Rand Corporation did a recent study for the United States Air
Force on the capabilites of the Chinese Air Force.  The study
concluded, "The Chinese Air Force does not constitute a credible
offensive threat against the United States or its Asian allies
today, and this situation will not change dramatically over the
coming decade."
<P>

To summarize our assessment of the capabilites of the Chinese
military, ERRI agrees with U.S. Secretary of Defense William
Perry when he told President Clinton that China simply does not
have the capability to launch a massive amphibious attack across
the Taiwan Strait.  The Taiwan Strait is more than four times the
width of the English Channel, which proved itself a very difficult 
military obstacle for Allied forces on D-Day in World War II.
<P>

Military experts assess that the 150,000 troops that the Chinese
have currently deployed in the on-going military exercises is
much too small of a force to use against Taiwan and its 400,000-
member forces.  And even if China were able to deploy more manpower
into the area -- it simply lacks the amphibious capabilty to even
move them across the strait.

<H2>HOW NORTH KOREA WOULD INVADE SOUTH KOREA ...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<BR>
Clark Staten, ERRI Analyst
<P>

A furious debate has been raging among intelligence, military, and national security experts.  Will North Korea attempt to militarily invade South Korea?  If so, how will they try to do it?

The clear official view expressed by the U.S. administration is that North Korea will not attempt a suicidal attack against the South.  On the other hand, there are several experts and analysts that say the North will attack ... in the near future.
<P>

South Korean forces are taking the threat seriously.  In March, they went on their highest state of alert in recent memory.  Every evening soldiers rake the beaches along the South Korean shoreline.  This was not to just keep the beaches clean, but an effort to see if there were any infilitrators entering the country in the middle of the night.  Footprints in the sand could be a warning of a breakout of hostilities.
<P>

There is one thing that all of the experts agree upon.  And, that is that no one really knows what is going on in North Korea.  Just about all of the analysts can provide justification for why North Korea should not to invade, but it's not certain if North Korea, itself, is even aware of the reasoning. The N. Korean government and its motivations remain shrouded in a cloud of mystery, behind of DMZ that has existed for four decades.
<P>

There are many possible explanations of why the North Koreans may launch an invasion of the South.  What is not certain is which of these reasons may be the correct one.  What is known is that the economy in the North is in ruin.  Floods have ruined crops and agriculture in general is in a dismal state.  Food and other essentials may be in short supply.  Economic isolation of N. Korea by the West has negatively impacted the economy and their exports are often restricted. Aside from trade with other rogue nations like Iran, Iraq, and Libya, N. Korea has few legitimate trading partners.

Some experts think that the North Koreans might launch an attack in a desperate gamble to avoid economic collapse.  That gamble may lead to negotiations with the U.S. that could, in the end, lead to a formalized peace treaty and normalized political and trade relations.  But if that's the end goal ... wouldn't it be easier to go another route other than war?
<P>

General Gary E. Luck, the commander of U.S. forces in South Korea told Congress in March, "We worry that in a very short period, this country will either collapse or take aggressive actions against the South in a desperate attempt to divert attention from its internal situation.  It is entirely possible that the leadership in Pyongyang is not, or will not remain, cohesive enough to make rational decisions."
<P>
<B>Invasion Methods</B>
<P>

Even though there is a lot of disagreement about whether or not the North Koreans will invade -- there is a lot of agreement about how they would do it.
<P>

The first step, in all probability, will be that the North Korean Army would send its special forces into many areas of the South. Military experts say that many of these SOF units would infilitrate far from the front lines.  The 80,000-strong force would arrive via boats, submarines, hovercraft and light planes.  This is the reason why the South Koreans rake their beaches every night.
<P>

The North Korean special forces would attack South Korean and U.S. command posts, communications centers, and supply depots.  They would try to destroy and damage military aircraft and just create general chaos in the South.  These special forces units, as in most armies, comprise of some of the best troops in the North Korean Army.
<P>

While the special forces were launching their attacks, it is expected that North Korean artillery and short-range missiles would open up.  The artillery would be targeted against key South Korean and U.S. forces and the capital of Seoul, which is located only 30 miles south of the border.
<P>

Next, masses of North Korean tanks and trucks would pour across the border. Of course the South Koreans have always expected this and have constructed very intricate defenses for this eventuality.  Anti-tank ditches, concrete walls and other barriers would force the North Korean tanks into narrow "killing zones" where the defenders of the South would focus their firepower.
<P>

But, the North Koreans also know about these defenses and have figured out other ways to get their troops across the border. Most likely, the North Koreans would use underground tunnels to move their troops into the South.  The South Koreans have discovered four of these tunnels, one was as deep as 450 feet below the surface.  Even though four of the tunnels have been discovered, it is believed that the North Koreans may have 20 more such tunnels at their disposal. These tunnels are very important to the overall invasion plan. Some experts believe that  the four discovered tunnels were capable of allowing 10,000 troops per hour to enter South Korea.
<P>

Other defenses that the South Koreans have established may include explosives already built into strategic sections of bridges and roads.  Built above key roads are very large rock fields that will can be explosively triggered, sending giant boulders to block roads necessary for travel to the South.
<P>

The North Koreans have also built formidable river crossing units, as water does block any number of access routes into the South.  Intelligence sources have indicated that the North has built 2,300 pre-fabricated sections of bridge and has more than 600 amphibious vehicles at its disposal. The S. Koreans can be expected to use the natural terrain to maximum advantage in their defense.
<P>

Military experts say that the North Koreans would try a blitzkrieg-type attack to capture the capital of Seoul.  They would try very hard to accomplish their military objectives before United States reinforcements can arrive from Japan, the U.S. and Europe.   Many experts in contact with ERRI say that a missile attack(s) on U.S. air bases and forces in Japan could be expected.  It is believed that North Korea has a few nuclear weapons, but it is not certain how they might be delivered. What is more expected is a chemical weapons attack.  North Korea reportedly has several tons of chemical weapons in their stockpile.
<P>

One U.S. military expert, who fully expects that the North will invade the South, said, "I think you would probably see the first major use of chemical agents since World War I.  If they were to decide to depopulate Seoul before taking it, they could probably do it with very little defense on our part." At least one military expert says that "Tokyo-style" subway poison gas attacks and other sabotage efforts could proceed an actual assault on the South.
<P>
Just about all of the military experts interviewed said that the United States and South Korea could quickly establish air and naval superiority over the North. While it might take some time to then decimate ground units, superior allied firepower and technology practically assures the eventuality.  In the end, North Korea would be destroyed.
<P>

The scenario outlined above is not much different than what happened in 1950, when the Korean War broke out.  One difference today is that the South Korean military is no longer a pushover, and the South Koreans are backed by about 35,000 U.S. troops. Many more allied troops and planes are stationed only a short distance away in Japan.  Another difference could be, and not all analysts agree with this assessment, that China would not come to the aid of the North Koreans, as they did during the Korean War.  Relations between North Korea and China are not described as overly cordial at the present time.
<P>

Again, many experts say that the North will not invade because it would be "suicide" for them.  But, other experts say that the North may think that the risk is worth it. One national security analyst in the U.S., who believes that the North will invade the South, said, "The problem is not that North Korea can defeat us, but that they think they can."  In their self-imposed isolation, the N. Koreans may be suffering the delusion that they can actually win a conventional war against S. Korea and the Unted States.
<P>

Colonel John Reitz, the spokesman for U.S. military forces in South Korea, said, "The situation for the regime in North Korea is not sustainable, because their economy and their agriculture are continuing to get worse and worse and then they had those horrible floods last summer.  The end for that regime is in sight.  We just don't know when."
<P>

Last fall, the North Koreans repositioned heavy artillery and aircraft closer to the border.  One group of North Korean bombers can reach Seoul in approximately six minutes.  That doesn't allow much warning.  On the other hand, North Korean military exercises have been at a low levels recently.  U.S. Intelligence says that it has not noticed any unusual troop movements.
<P>

On Thursday, in Singapore, General John Shalikashvili, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a news conference that the tension on the Korean peninsula was the greatest security concern currently in Asia.  The General said, "That's probably the security issue of most concern to us.  Certainly, Korea is an issue that requires careful watching because of those massive conventional forces that are in such close proximity to each other and the conditions of the economy that we read about in North Korea.  It is a bothersome issue that we need to watch, without being alarmist about it."
<P>

Will the North invade the South?  Most experts and analysts tell ERRI that it will probably happen at some point in time. They say that the N. Koreans may believe that they have few other logical alternatives.  If it does happen, they predict that it won't as easy as the 1991 Gulf War. They say it will be a difficult, demanding, and bloody conflict. The bodies, on both sides, will be likely to pile up.  Most professional warriors tell ENN that they pray that there is diplomatic resolution to the increasing tensions in Korea, but that they will be prepared for a military solution, should that become necessary.

<H3>EXPERTS LOOK AT POTENTIAL TERRORIST THREAT AT THE 2000 OLYMPICS...</H3>
By Steve Macko
<P>

A conference concerning possible terrorist threats at the
2000 Olympic Games was convened in early December in Australia.
Counter-terrorist experts from around the world came to discuss
security preparations for the Summer Games that will be held in
Sydney.
<P>

One of the experts at the conference was Bruce Hoffman, who is the
head of the center for the study of terrorism and political violence
at St.Andrews University in Scotland.  Mr. Hoffman was also a
security consultant for the World Cup soccer games that were held in
the United States in 1994.  Hoffman said that Australia should not
think of itself immune to possible terrorist attack because of its
tough immigration standards or its geographical isolation.
<P>

Hoffman warned, "They do make Australia much more difficult to enter
for potential adversaries and they do provide Australia with more
natural advantages that other Olympic venues might not have enjoyed.
But I think what's absolutely critical is that Australia shouldn't
wrap itself in a fatally false blanket of security about its 
geographical isolation and its immigration procedures.  Certainly
those are advantages, but I think there's no way any country anywhere
in the world can hermetically seal itself off from a terrorist threat."
<P>

Because the entire country of Australia is surrounded by water and
much of the movement of athletes will be made on water it made for
an interesting discussion on potential terrorist targets.  Hoffman
said, "Historically terrorists shy away from engaging in maritime
terrorism.  But I don't think we should assume there's not a threat
in Sydney because so much of Sydney's venue and so much of the
movement of athletes will be facilitated by maritime transport.  That
in itself could provide an attraction for terrorists and change their
previous patterns of operations.  I think it will present new
challenges for security officials, on the other hand it may present
new opportunities for terrorists, as well.
<P>

It was revealed at the conference that there were internal and
external security threats at the past two sites for the Summer
Olympic Games that were held in Seoul, South Korea, and Barcelona,
Spain.  There has been no major terrorist incidents at the Olympics
since eleven members of the Isreali Olympic team were killed at the
1972 Munich Games by Palestinian terrorists.
<P>

It is Mr. Hoffman's belief that the greatest threat does not come
from typical terrorist groups such as Islamic Jihad or Abu Nidal,
but from separatists groups such as the ETA in Spain or the Kashmirs
in India.  Hoffman said that these type of groups may see that a
terrorist strike at a major international gathering could further
their cause overseas.  Hoffman said, "I don't think that it's 
coincidental that a year following the 1972 Munich Olympic massacre
that the PLO was granted observer status in the United Nations and
in 1974 Yasser Arafat was invited to address the General Assembly."

"That itself shows that although people were certainly appalled by
what occurred in 1972, it was nonetheless a tremendous publicity
vehicle.  So, I think that by no means any one could think that no
other group would similarly seek to use the Olympics as a means to
catapult their own cause onto the world's agenda."
<P>

Also attending the conference was the director general of the
Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO), David Sadlieir.
He told the participants that more terrorism was a credible prospect
for the Asia-Pacific region leading up to the Sydney Games in 2000.
<P>

Mr. Sadilier said that Australia has only experienced "mild" forms
of terrorist acts in the past.  Since 1969, the ASIO has monitored
about 100 incidents in the country.  Only five could be classified
as major terrorist attacks.  One of those incidents was the 1978
bombing of the Hilton Hotel in Sydney.
<P>

Sadilier and the ASIO have been busy trying to put together more
cooperation between security agencies in the Asia-Pacific region.
He said that current cooperation and communications between the
region's agencies was fragmented, at best.  Sadilier said, "At
best, the region can expect no less terrorism and it seems to me
there is a credible prospect for more."

<H2>SIX ALARM FIRE RAGES IN NYC COMMERCIAL BUILDING</H2>
By Jim Fay ENN NYC-NJ Metro Correspondent
<P>

FDNY Units battled a deep-seated fire in a Garment Center
commercial building this morning, March 1st, requiring
a not too often requirement of six alarms to contain it.
<P>

At approximately 0315 EST, FDNY units responded to initial
reports of a heavy smoke condition in the street at Eighth
Ave. and West 36 St.  First arriving units discovered a gas
fed fire in the basement of a Chinese restaurant at 525 Eighth
Ave.  An urgent request went out for Con Edison, the NYC
gas and electric company, to shut down the gas. However, the 
fire gained headway in the rear of the building,
extending upwards to the upper floors of the six story
commercial occupancy, before the gas company could respond.
<P>

Since the start of the FDNY, a five-alarm fire was the highest
number of alarms that could be transmitted.  Additional
units were summoned by way of a "Boro Call," in which a
greater alarm was transmitted for a location in another
Borough, and those units responded to the fifth alarm fire.
However, with the Computer-Assisted Dispatch System (CADS),
the additional units can be dispatched directly by the
Borough Dispatcher, regardless from what Borough they
respond from.  These units are just added as an additional
alarm.
<P>

The  fire in Manhattan continued out of control and
the sixth alarm was transmitted at approximately 0600 hrs.
EST.  Additional rescue and tower ladder companies were also
ordered to the scene, and Fire Department officials estimate
that the operation will be a lenghty one into most of
the day.  The Fire was in the proximity of the Lincoln
Tunnel, which caused a morning rush-hour problem.
One minor injury to a firefighter was reported.
<P>

By late morning, heavy fire was still reported in the fire
building.  More than 300 firefighters were on the scene.  Four
tower ladders were being used in an exterior attack.  An FDNY
spokesman said, "When it gets to be of such a magnitude, with
fire on all floors, it is easier to back out and fight it from
the exterior, so it takes longer."

<H2>FEDS TARGET CHICAGO STREET GANG...</H2>
By Steve Macko
<P>

Federal law enforcement authorities and prosecutors have set 
their sights on ending the 25 year reign of perhaps the largest
criminal street gang in the United States ... The Gangster
Disciples.
<P>

For more than six years the feds have been collecting evidence
and building their case against the gang that has as many as
30,000 members in 35 states.  When a person thinks about a
street gang such as the Gangster Disciples images of drugs,
murder and money laundering cross the mind.  But that does not
even begin to suggest the reach of this criminal enterprise.
<P>

The leaders of the gang reach from behind prison walls of some
of the toughest prisons and still maintain control of what is  
happening on Chicago streets.  Street gang expert and Chicago 
State University professor George Knox said, "They're one of
the most successful, illegal home-grown corporations in the
modern American underground economy.  They're trying to make a
fortune through crime."
<P>

Professor Knox estimates that the Disciples make more than
$100 million a year in narcotic drug sales, mostly cocaine.
Knox also said that the gang has a lengthy constitution, uses
codes for passing messages from one another, and has a typical 
gang emblem.  The Gangster Disciples even have a pledge of
alligiance, membership applications and members must pay dues.
About applicants who wish to join the gang, Knox added, "You 
will be investigated just like you would be at a bank if you
wanted to take out a mortgage."
<P>

This insidious street gang runs itself like a Fortune 500
company.  It's chairman and one of its board of directors 
currently sit in prison.  On the streets there are governors
and regents running the day-to-day operations.  It's this
high level of organization that sets the Gangster Disciples
aside from the usual loose band of thugs that make up most
street gangs. Police in Chicago say that there has been no criminal organization,
including the infamous "Mob," that has been so conspicuous in
the City since Al Capone during Prohibition -- and even Capone
pales in comparison.
<P>

Chicago Police Commander Donald Hilbring heads the gang crimes
investigations unit.  Hilbring said, "We're not only talking about
running drugs.  We're talking about running as many businesses as
they can.  We're talking about politics.  They want to control the
entire community.  It's the same thing as Capone."
<P>

The leader of the Gangster Disciples is 45-year-old Larry Hoover,
who has been in prison serving a sentence for murder for more than
20 years.  Even though he has been in prison for about half his
life, he still reportedly is able to keep total control of this
gang.  It is said that besides maintaining control over thousands of
members in the streets -- he also allegedly has control of some 5,400 inmates in
state prisons.  How is this possible?
<P>

Evidence uncovered by a federal criminal investigation has found
out that Hoover's incarceration has apparently enabled him "to
consolidate power and develop unquestioning allegiance among the
members of his gang."  According to prosecutors, the Gangster Disciples are even better
organized in prison than they are on the streets.  Before anyone
becomes a member of the gang they are screened and their "street" references
are checked.
<P>

In recent years, Hoover has allegedly been trying to do a "con job" and has said
that his gang has undergone a conversion.  The gang is now involved
in community activism and not crime, Hoover is quoted as saying. In answer to that, 
Jack Hynes, the Cook County prosecutor who is in charge of gangs prosecutions, said, "Hogwash!"
<P>

After the gang cornered a large chunk of the illegal drug trade in
Chicago they have reportedly branched out to other states.  Their heaviest activity
is in the Midwest states of Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin.
<P>

According to Prosecutor Hynes, 43 percent of 650 gang-related
murders in Chicago between 1990 and 1994 involved the Gangster Disciples in one
way or another. Authorities say that in recent months it appears that the gang has
been attempting to lower its profile, but illegal activity continues.
In January, a high-ranking member was murdered in his West Side bar.
More than 1,000 people attended the wake. 
<P> 

Jack Hynes said, "We still see the violence.  They're trying to make
money.  But they're in a holding pattern.  This has definitely
crimped their style.  We've got them off their guard, but it can't
stop here.  This is only Round One."
<P>

The investigations continue and a series of trials is now underway.
Once the federal government is able to convict Hoover and his
co-horts it is hoped that they can transfer this powerful criminal
to a federal prison and then severely limit his contact with the
outside world.

<TITLE>Basic Life Support in Cardiac Arrest</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<H3>Care and Transportation of the Cardiac Arrest Patient for Basic Life Support Personnel</H3>
<P>

<B>(C) 1989 by Michael Esslinger</B>
<BR>
<HR>

The material provided in this reference guide was designed to offer suggestions and ideas 
relating to efficient care and transport of the patient in cardiopulmonary arrest.  It must be 
kept in mind that even on routine transports, any patient may develop serious complications 
resulting in Cardiac Arrest.  Developing and maintaining the skills and knowledge to 
provide quality care is essential to your success in these emergencies.
<P>

As an EMT-1A, you often may be called upon to make important decisions that require you 
to take appropriate actions concerning your patient's physical welfare.  Having a PLAN OF 
ACTION is a crucial element of your patient care and scene management.  Without any pre-
planning these types of calls can easily turn into scenes of confusion and chaos.  It is 
therefore every EMTs' responsibility to develop and maintain the skills and knowledge 
applicable to this or any other type of emergency.
<P>

The objective of this material is not to retrain you in the general administration of CPR, but 
to help you better define your roles and responsibilities.  It is hoped as a result of this 
reference you will establish your own strategies, and by doing so it will result in proficient 
and organized resuscitation efforts.
<P>
<HR>


<H4>COMBINED RESPONSIBILITIES</H4>

<BR>

In handling the patient in cardiac arrest , it is imperative that you and your partner function 
together as a team.  In order to achieve this you must first be able to establish an open line of communication.  This enables you and your partner to review established procedures and to establish your mutual expectations of the other.  It will benefit both of you to have some 
knowledge of how each other will react and which tasks each of you will be responsible for. 
Additionally,  confusion can be minimized if you will take the time to communicate with 
each other on scene.
<P>

It is important to consider your primary goal: transporting and admitting the patient to the 
closest appropriate emergency department in a safe, efficient and expedient manner.  This 
can only be achieved through organized and planned team work.  REMEMBER,  
COMMUNICATION IS VITAL !!
<P>
<HR>
<H4>RESPONSIBILITY OF THE DRIVER</H4>
<BR>
Your primary responsibility as the driver on scene of a full arrest is to assist your partner.  At 
this point you and your partner should have previously discussed a plan to use in the event of code.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>1)	See to it that the ambulance is conveniently located and safely parked with the 
	engine at an idle in order to maintain a charge to all electrical systems.

<LI>2)	Remove the guerney from the vehicle and replace the pillow with a backboard or 
	scoop (may also utilize a CPR board).  The blanket should be left with the 
	guerney in order to protect the patient's privacy.
<LI>3) 	If time permits engage the suction device and attach either a tonsil tip or a catheter depending on your partners preference.
<LI>4)	Turn on the main oxygen tank and attach an extension tube to the flow regulator 
	to be used in conjunction with an Ambu-bag.  This should be prepared so the 
	technician will only need to turn on the oxygen flow meter when the patient is 
	loaded into the ambulance.
</UL>

Depending on the circumstances,  your partner may or may not have obtained a brief history 
on the patient.  If not, you should attempt to do this using no more than a couple of minutes. 
<P> 
If you work within a district where volunteer or Fire Department response is a factor, they 
usually will have gathered most of the information you will need;  in addition,  they will 
nearly always have a summary sheet available.  If for some reason information is not 
available from those resources, be sure to quickly ask them to interview bystanders, 
bystanders, family, or anyone with knowledge of the patient's medical history and events 
leading up to the cardiac arrest.
<P>

Necessary information should include the following:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>*	Age.
<LI>*	Activity when arrest occurred.
<LI>*	How long ago patient arrested.
<LI>*	How long before CPR was initiated.
<LI>*	Medical History.
<LI>*	A current list of medications.
<LI>*      List of known Allergies
</UL>
<P>
If your partner has gathered a history you should at some point get this information.  In most 
situations it will be your responsibility to perform a radio report to the receiving hospital.  
Also, if possible, gather the patient's medications and bring them with you to the emergency 
department.  This will be helpful to the physician and E.D. staff in determining the possible 
cause of the arrest.
<P>

When you reach the point were the patient were the patient is ready to be loaded and 
transported, it is important that you communicate with your partner and it is understood 
exactly how this will be accomplished.  For example, who will perform compression's while 
pushing the gurney to the ambulance ?  Will you be needed to assist with CPR while the 
Technician and support personnel get settled?  These and other questions should be 
answered in detail well in advance.
<P>

When the patient is loaded and ready for transport, your considerations should be focused on preparing a radio report and choosing a safe and appropriate route to the closest emergency department.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE TECHNICIAN</H4>
<BR>
As the EMT on the scene of a full arrest,  it will be your responsibility to coordinate the 
rescue effort from the time of your arrival on the scene, to the time your patient is transferred to the care of the emergency department personnel.  You will be coordinating the activities of other rescue personnel in addition to ensuring that the patient is receiving effective resuscitative care.  All of this should be accomplished in a way which both minimizes confusion and insures expedient transport to the receiving emergency department.
<P>

If you are first on scene it is imperative that you initiate care, notify your partner and any 
other arriving rescue personnel immediately of the situation.  At this point, initiate you 
PLAN OF ACTION and begin coordinating the others as to how you would like to begin 
transport of the patient.
<P>

Always remember that your primary responsibility is to your patient, however, if needed, use 
other qualified scene personnel effectively in order to accomplish the necessary tasks.  If at 
any time you are free to do so, obtain a brief medical history, and a history of events leading 
up to the arrest.  If you are unable, then advise your partner so that he may do so.  The 
information gathered will be useful to emergency department staff.
<P>

Once you partner has arrived with the guerney, quickly decide how the patient will patient 
will be transferred and advise all assisting personnel of your plan.  If adequate help is on 
scene you should then decide who will push the guerney, who will perform compression's, 
and who will manage the airway and ventilation's.  Once the is established there should be 
no confusion and you may proceed to the ambulance.
<P>

Once there,  you should find out who will be accompanying you and have him/her step into 
the ambulance to await the patient while you and your partner load the patient into the 
vehicle.  Remember, you should see to it that no one gets ahead of themselves and everyone involved is acting as an organized team.
<P>

Once you have the patient loaded and ready for transport, your efforts should be directed at 
maintaining a patent airway and administering good ventilation's.  Additionally, you should 
monitor the person assisting to insure the patient is receiving effective compression's.
<P>

Upon arrival at the emergency department, you will first need to communicate how you wish 
to unload the patient from the ambulance.  Once the patient is unloaded, CPR should be 
resumed immediately.  Often times you will have emergency department staff available to 
assist you with ventilation's and compression's.  If so, be sure to utilize them appropriately.  
Entering the emergency department should be done at a consistent pace so those 
performing CPR can keep up.
<P>

Once the patient has been transferred to the care of the emergency department personnel, you should communicate the patient history.  Outline the events leading up to the arrest to either the physician or nurse in charge at the first convenient moment.  You may also want to make yourself available to them should they need help.
<P>

Finally, after everything else has been accomplished, it will be necessary to do the appropriate paperwork.  Due to the critical nature of this call, it is important that your report be accurate and concise.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>PATIENT HAND OFF</H4>
<BR>
During your patient hand-off you should take the opportunity to better inform the 
emergency room staff of the other details not included in your initial radio report.  In 
addition to repeating the information given over the radio you should include information 
such as a detailed history, current events leading up to the incident, and a list of current 
medications.
<P>
<HR>

<H4>DRIVING</H4>

<BR>

When driving to the emergency department with a full arrest you should consider the 
following and drive accordingly. First,  performing CPR in a completely still room is 
difficult enough. Performing CPR in the back of a moving ambulance is even more difficult; 
performing CPR in an ambulance that is being driven too fast for conditions is impossible.  
Secondly,  both attendants are in a very vulnerable position and if an accident were to occur, both could be seriously injured or killed.  You should therefore attempt to drive as safe as possible.  If it becomes necessary to make a sudden stop or turn, you should always verbally warn those in back of the ambulance.
<P>

REMEMBER,  Code-3 emergency driving is not utilized to drive at an excessive speed, but 
is used to maintain a consistent pace and safely assist in moving through traffic and 
intersections safely.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>WORKING WITH THE PATIENT'S FAMILY</H4>
<BR>
When managing the stressful situation of a full arrest, it is easy to forget about the patient's 
family and the psychological crisis they are going through.  It is important that the EMT 
helps support the emotional needs of the family in a professional understanding and caring 
manner whenever possible.  The EMT should remember to never mislead the family about 
the patient's condition (i.e. "everything is going to be alright").  Instead you should use 
comments like "We are doing everything in our power  to help him/her.
<P>
After you have arrived at the hospital be sure to help the family and show them the 
appropriate place to wait.  Be understanding to their needs .  Families are often times left 
wandering  the hospital confused and upset.  Always make it a point to take a moment and 
talk with the patient's family members especially those being of the SIDS patient.
<P>  
Remember, these people require special care, so try to be receptive to their needs.
Many of these patients have gone through a long medical ordeal, and the family often 
receives little or no support through and of it. Remember, these people are usually scared 
and very upset over their ill loved one.  Words of support can offer strong reassurance that 
their loved on is being well cared for.
<P>
A few kind words can go a long way.....
<P>
<HR>


<H4>SELF CRITIQUE</H4>

<BR>

No code runs perfectly, so it usually is helpful to discuss it with everyone involved (your 
partner, fire personnel, ER. staff).  Going over it in your mind you may think you have done 
one thing instead of another.  By expressing your thoughts and listening to those of others, 
you are likely to receive some input which might prove valuable in the future.  If at this 
point you have a question or feel unsure of something , never hesitate to discuss it with your peers, a supervisor, or a field training officer.  The knowledge gained from self critiquing is invaluable to the EMT.
<P>

It is often said that anxiety is contagious, therefore, when you are confronted with a full 
arrest see to it that you are not the one starting an epidemic.  Before you enter the scene, take a deep breath, try to relax and concentrate on preparing yourself.  Anxiety is often a result of being unprepared.  Surprisingly, it takes only a few seconds to come up with a plan of action. 
<P>
Additionally, try not to get ahead of yourself.  Perform your tasks smoothly and 
purposefully.  confidence is just as contagious so if you possess it chances are it will spread to those assisting you.  It is also the one thing family members lack and need to see in you.

<H2>Truck Bomb Wounds 120 In Manchester, UK</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor

MANCHESTER, ENGLAND (ENN) - At least 120 people were injured when a truck bomb exploded in central Manchester on Saturday morning.  The bomb reportedly went off as police bomb experts were examining the scene.  No claim of responsibility has been made, but the blast followed a coded telephone warning which is consistent with the modus operandi of the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
<P>

Gary O'Neil of the Manchester Fire Brigade said, "The Arndale Center, which is the heart of the city shopping area, the whole side, the gable end, has just been blown away."  The explosion blew out windows within a half-mile radius.  O'Neil said that the fire brigade had to handle several small fires after the explosion.
<P>

Forty injured victims, most suffering wounds from flying glass, were taken to Manchester Royal Infirmary.  Another hospital reported treating 21 victims, including two people in serious condition. Numerous other victims, most with minor injuries, were reportedly treated at other hospitals.
<P>

The telephone warning was called in at about 10:00 a.m. (0500 EDT). Police bomb squad experts were probing a suspicious vehicle with a mechanical device when the van exploded at about 11:20 a.m. (0620 EDT).
<P>

Manchester, which is located about 180 miles northwest of London, was last hit by an IRA bomb on 3 December 1992.  60 people were hurt when two bombs exploded during a weekday rush hour.

<H2>   Smoky Fire in Empire State Building</H2>
<P>

Chicago, IL., (ENN) November 21, 1995 --Preliminary reports are being
received by ENN of a fire in a sub-basement of the 102 story
Empire State Building. According to fire department sources, a
third alarm has been transmitted and several ambulances have
been dispatched to the scene. Reports are being received of
rescues being performed on the upper floors of the building. An
unidentified EMS dispatcher said that several people may have
suffered smoke inhalation injuries.
<P>

An eyewitness told ENN that smoke from what is being called an
"electical vault fire" had apparently spread through several of
the upper floors of the building and that there was smoke in
some of the stairways.  The man also told ENN that at least some
of the elevators were not working and people were being
evacuated down the stairways.
<P>

There are no reports of deaths, and an indeterminate number of
injuries, at this time, as an evacuation continues.  ENN is
gathering additional details and will provide updates as the
information is made available.

<font size=5><strong>STATISTICS PAINT DIFFERENT PICTURE OF SOUTHERN 
CHURCH FIRES ...</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
Most of us have seen the images on the evening news -- flames shooting out of a church located in a southern 
state. Night-after-night, week-after-week, the news media reported on what was considered to be a rash of 
arson fires against black churches in the southern U.S. Amid those images were fears of raging racism. 
However, after conducting a careful study of the cases and of the statistics, an entirely different picture emerges. 
There is little hard evidence of any sudden wave of racially motivated church fires.<br>
<br>
A recent review of six years of federal, state and local data found that the number of arson cases is up. 
However, there was a marked increase at <strong>BOTH black AND white churches</strong>. Only random links to racism 
could be tied to a few of the cases. As reported by this publication previously, officials in the insurance industry 
say that this year's toll of church fires is within the range of what they would normally expect. There has been 
NO dramatic increase in the number of insurance claims made against church fires.<br>
<br>
Racism is the clear motivation in less than 20 of the 73 recorded black church fires since 1995. (Based on 
numbers of one week ago.) There is no clear evidence that suggests a conspiracy or of a general climate of 
racial hatred.<br>
<br>
Loretta Worters, a spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute, which is an organization that collects 
data affecting insurance companies, said, &quot;You don't want to discount the racially motivated fires, but this is a 
crime that has been going on for a long time and affects ALL religions and races.&quot;<br>
<br>
<strong>A statistical review of the data involving church fires in eleven Southern U.S. states<br>
revealed the following:</strong><br>
<br>
-- In twelve cases where there have been arrests, the suspects include: Three separate cases where firefighters 
are accused of setting the blazes and then helped to put out; Drunken teenagers; Devil worshippers and 
burglars.<br>
<br>
-- In 12 to 18 of the fires, there is evidence that points to a racial motivation by an arsonist(s). These include 
arrests made for two fires in South Carolina and two in the State of Tennessee. It is believed that another four 
fires in Tennessee indicate clear racial overtones. There is also evidence that points out that black churches were 
singled out in Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi.<br>
<br>
-- The number of fires involving white churches has also increased. Since 1995, more white churches than black 
churches have burned in the states of: Florida, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia. In the State of 
Texas, 20 white churches have burned compared to 11 black churches. In the past 18 months, statistics show 
that there have been fires at 75 white churches and at 73 black churches. In the past six years, there have been 
248 recorded arson fires at white churches compared to 161 at black churches.<br>
<br>
-- It is believed that in at least 15 of the fires at black churches racism was an unlikely motivation. In nine of the 
cases, black suspects were named. Six churches burned in an arson spree that included both white and black 
churches.<br>
<br>
-- In an 18-month period, there has been a slight increase in arson fires involving black churches. But many 
involved a few nights' work by serial arsonists. In most states, these kinds of fires are considered rare by 
authorities and because of their small number they statistically multiply quickly. i.e. In 1995, the State of 
Louisiana had seven black church arson fires, but four of those fires occurred in one night near Baton Rouge.<br>
<br>
In another example, the State of Mississippi averages about two black church arson fires a year, but after one 
night where two black churches were set on fire -- Mississippi doubled its number and had four.<br>
<br>
The main, number one reason, in the opinion of ERRI criminalists and other experts, for what appears to be an 
increase in these types of fires has been the publicity generated on the subject by the news media. In the weeks 
since President Clinton had to submit to political pressure and spotlight the fires, there have been 18 to 20 fires 
at black and white churches. Richard Gilman of the Insurance Committee for Arson Control, an insurance 
industry trade group, said, &quot;There's a lot of feeling out there that there are copycat fires.&quot; This hypothesis was 
previously reported in a ENN report on this subject. (<a href="/churchfr.htm"><strong>Click here to see the ENN June 19, 1996 article on 
this subject</strong></a>) Gilman and other fire experts say that the fires reveal only one thing: &quot;Churches have long been a 
favorite target for arsonists.&quot;<br>
<br>
Data from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) shows that, over the years, church arsons have 
dropped steadily from 1,420 recorded in 1980 to 520 in 1994, the last year that data was made available. A 
great many of the churches were located in isloated rural areas. Empty for most of the week, the churches were 
prime targets for arsonists, burglars, vandals and people with other motivations.<br>
<br>
Thirty percent of all church fires are ruled to be arson, that is twice the rate of all structure fires in the U.S. 
Loretta Worters said, &quot;The number of arson fires that have broken out this year are within the norm.&quot;<br>
<br>
But still, there is a furor over black church fires. It is true that hatred is the motivation in some of the fires. Since 
1990, 23 people have been convicted in at least seven cases of burning or desecrating 13 churches and one 
synagogue. Those cases have been held in both federal and state courts.<br>
<br>
As previously noted, there is evidence to indicate that race was a motive for some fires in the states of Alabama, 
Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee. But little evidence of racial motivation exists in a majority of the recent 
fires. Arson investigators and, in some cases, even church officials have discounted the motive of hate in at least 
12 cases where whites were arrested and in a number of other cases that are still under investigation.<br>
<br>
It is believed that in many of the cases the fires were the work of burglars, youths or accidents. Alabama Fire 
Marshal John Robison said, &quot;Most times until you identify the perpetrator you can't know the motive. Yes, there 
are some of them that are racially motivated, but a vast majority of them are not.&quot;<br>
<br>
There are several lists of burned churches. There are federal lists and state lists and lists compiled by cities. 
There are media lists and lists made by civil rights groups. Virtually none of the lists resemble each other.<br>
<br>
The U.S. Justice Department says that since 1990 there have been 245 church fires, both black and white. The 
Center for Democratic Renewal issued a report in June that said there has been 90 arson attacks on black 
churches since 1990.<br>
<br>
When asked what the correct number is, federal law enforcement officers are not entirely sure. That's because 
the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are 
only called into a suspected case when local or state authorities ask them to do so. ATF spokesman Larry 
Washington said, &quot;In the past, we have not been invited on each and every church fire. Now with the heightened 
awareness, we're getting contacted when anything burns. The rising numbers mostly reflect the growing 
awareness.&quot;<br>
<br>
And where does that growing awareness come from? From the same place where most Americans get their 
news.<br>
<br>
<strong>As for the ATF being called in now when anything burns and the kinds of fires that are being added to 
the lists are these examples:</strong><br>
<br>
-- 2 February 1996: A trash can was set on fire outside of a house owned by the predominately black Light of 
the World Baptist Church in Wilson, North Carolina.<br>
<br>
-- 25 March 1996: A fire at the Central Baptist Church in Browns, Alabama. The church caught fire and burned 
during a lightning storm.<br>
<br>
-- Two fires in Tennessee include an arson ruled by the state fire marshal at the home of a snake handler and the 
discovery of burned matches at a white church. It was determined that the matches were left by burglars 
fumbling in the dark.<br>
<br>
<strong>These fires, for whatever reason, appear to be left off the list:</strong><br>
<br>
-- 11 December 1995: In a three-week period where there were three other attacks on other black churches in 
the area of Boligee, Alabama, the Jerusalem Baptist Church was destroyed by a fire. The insurer of the church 
ruled a case of arson. Federal arson investigators blamed the blaze on a faulty furnace and closed the case.<br>
<br>
-- 7 April 1996: A fire at the St. Paul's Baptist Church in Lauderdale, Mississippi, was caused by a discarded 
cigarette left in a yard refuse by the black church's deacon. The deacon denies the explanation.<br>
<br>
It really is not certain how many black churches have been the victim of arson in the State of Florida. When the 
state insurance commissioner's office was asked how a church was determined to be black or white, the office 
admitted it was based on guesswork based on the name of the church.<br>
<br>
So what really are the reasons for the arsons at black and white churches? According to Jack Levin, the 
director of Northeastern University's program for the Study of Violence and Social Conflict, &quot;When it comes to 
hate crimes, it is always tough to decide the source of motivation. Racism helps define them, but sometimes it 
doesn't explain the entire incident.&quot;<br>
<br>
Levin said that his study of hundreds of hate crimes found that boredom in teenagers that was fueled by anger 
and alcohol accounted for 65 percent of the incidents that he has termed, &quot;recreational racism.&quot; Levin said, 
&quot;Lots of young people feel powerless and there's a sense of dominance in burning down a church. Not all of 
excessive need for power gets expressed in racism. That's why you have burnings of white churches.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bottom line -- the church fires are not anything new. Just as many, if not more, white churches are the victim of 
arson as black churches. The recent wave of media attention has contributed to the number of &quot;copycat&quot; fires. It 
It is our editorial belief that when the &quot;red hot&quot; media attention dies down, so should the number of fires.</p>

<H2>Truck Bombing of USAF Base in Dhahran, Saudia Arabia</H2>

June 25, 1996 (ENN) Preliminary reports are being recieved of a terrorist attack on a U.S. Air Force base near Dhahran, Saudia Arabia. Casualties are reported in excess of 100 and an unknown number of deaths may have occurred.  Details are sketchy at this time, and Air Force spokespersons are not imnmediately available for comment. 
<P>

An unconfirmed report suggests that an "extremely large" truck bomb may have exploded near a housing area of the King Abdul Aziz Airbase.  Medics and fire units are on-scene and a mass casualty incident has been declared.  As previously reported by ENN, U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia have been targetted by Islamic extremists, and several threats have been issued against allied units in Saudi Arabia.<P>

<H2>Terrorist Devastates USAF Base in Dhahran; 
23 Dead, 105 Critically Injured
</H2>
By  Clark Staten, ERRI Senior Analyst
<P>

Chicago, IL, June 26, 1996 (ENN)-- A deadly terrorist attack has
taken the lives of at least 23 Americans, and injured another
300, at a U.S. Air Force housing complex on the King Abdul Aziz
Airbase near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. According to witnesses, an
Air force security guard noticed a 5,000 gallon diesel truck
being backed up next to a dormitory that housed U.S. personnel.
Both Saudi and American security forces were notified of the
unusual incident and responded to the report. As the security
patrols approached the parked truck, they saw two unidentified
individuals fleeing the scene in a small white car.
<P>

Reportedly, security forces then immediately began to order an
evacuation of nearby buildings. Within two or three minutes, a
massive explosion engulfed the nearest building and created a 10
meter (35 feet) deep crater that measured more than 30 meters
(85 feet) in width. According to military authorities, damage
was done to buildings as far as 5 kilometers (3 miles) away from
the blast.
<P>

Explosive ordinance disposal personnel estimated that the bomb
had the force of as much as 4,000 lbs. of TNT and said that it
appeared that the device was made of a "high order explosive
material."  It was not immediately determined if the truck
contained any diesel or was completely filled with explosives.
An unnamed Saudi defense official, at the scene, was quoted as
saying, "It does appear that this was a terrorist act directed
at the foreign presence in the Kingdom."
<P>

Quickly, both Air Force and civilian ambulances and fire
equipment sped to the scene. At least part of one building, and
maybe another nearby, were reported to have collapsed due to the
detonation. Hundreds of people were reported injured by flying
glass and debris produced by the blast. Dead and dying women and
children, relatives of airmen stationed at the base, were seen
among the victims. An outraged and unidentified Air Force medic
described the scene as "just like the Beirut Marine
Barracks...all over again...only this time, it was our wives and
kids killed by those bastards."
<P>

Rescue efforts in Dhahran have reportedly continued into the
night, with soldiers and airmen digging through the shattered
buildings and piles of debris with their bare hands, hoping to
find some sign of life amongst the devastation. More than 100
Americans were reported to be in either serious or critical
condition, having suffered the effects of concussion injuries,
lacerations, fractures, and burns from the force of the truck
bomb eruption. Another 150 were treated for minor wounds and
released, according to military sources.
<P>

Speculation has already begun about the possible perpetrators of
the atrocity in Dhahran. U.S. Forces in Saudi Arabia have been
on an increased state of alert since May 16, when the U.S.
embassy in Riyadh received unspecified threats against
Americans.  The warnings in May were proceeded by a November 13,
1995 car bombing of an American training compound in Riyadh that
killed seven people and wounded 37 others.
<P>

Threat levels had reportedly escalated again after the recent
execution of four men convicted of the Nov. 13th bombing. The
four men, beheaded by Saudi authorities, claimed in their
confessions to the bombing that they had been motivated by
influences from "outside the Kingdom," including dissident
Mohammad al-Masari.  Masari is allegedly the leader of a group
that wants to establish a Islamic theocracy in Saudi Arabia and
depose the Saudi royal family.  Masari has denied that he had
any influence over the four. Masari and his organization
undoubtedly remain suspects in the current bombing.
<P>

U.S. Ambassador Raymond Mabus said that American embassy had
received faxes in April, May, and June from Islamic
fundamentalists, calling for the thousands of American and
British military personnel to leave the kingdom before July.  A
group, called the "Islamic Movement for Change," who oppose all
Western troops in the kingdom, has vowed in its public
statements to "exert all available means to evict these foreign
forces." The "movement" was one of three groups that claimed
responsibility for the Nov.13th Riyadh bombing. 
<P>

ERRI analysts say that several other small splinter groups of
"Saudi nationalists", "Moslem extremists", or a specially put
together team of Iranian-backed "sappers" could also be
responsible for the disaster in Dhahran.  Recent patterns of
terrorism suggest that a number of recent bombings in the Mid
and Far East have been the work of teams of "specialists",
brought together for a specific act and then disbanded. This
"Modis Operandi" makes it extremely difficult to track the
attack to its actual source.
<P>

But, according to ERRI experts, it is entirely too early to
establish a clear motive or the identities of the terrorists in
Dhahran. Much investigative work must be carried out, clues must
be uncovered, and many leads followed. President Clinton, in a
statement issued shortly after the disaster was announced, said
that he was sending a special team from the Federal Bureau of
Investigation to assist the Saudi Arabian government in its
search for the bombers.
<P> 

Clinton, visibly shaken and outraged by the "Disaster in
Dhahran," said, "The cowards who committed this murderous act
must not go unpunished."  In order to do that, however, Saudi
and American officials are now faced with the difficult task of
identifying and locating the murderers who struck so violently
in Saudi Arabia.

<br>
BELFAST (ENN) - Violence continued in Northern Ireland overnight on Thursday. It is feared that the violence 
could worsen when bonfires are lit in the traditional start to marches commemorating victories over Catholics in 
the 17th Century. The British government is sending reinforcements to Northern Ireland in response to the 
Protestant rioting. About 80 members of the British Army's elite paratroop regiment was flown into Belfast. 
About 1,000 additional troops are scheduled to arrive by the end of the week. This will bring British troop 
levels in Northern Ireland to 18,500, which would be the highest level since 1982.<br>
<br>
On Wednesday night, police fired plastic bullets at a Protestant mob who were threatening five Catholic families 
who were forced to flee their homes in Belfast. Elsewhere, Protestants reportedly hijacked buses to burn as 
road barricades in the northern suburbs of Belfast. A gang of Protestants, who were blocking a bridge in south 
Belfast, beat a woman after she confronted them for throwing rocks at her car. Police were forced to fire plastic 
bullets a gang of youths who were throwing gasoline bombs in the town of Lurgan.<br>
<br>
The Royal Ulster Constabulary said on Thursday that 65 police officers and 50 civilians have been injured since 
Sunday. There have been 750 attacks against police and 150 people have been arrested. Police, so far, have 
had to fire 660 plastic bullets at mobs involved in street violence.</p>
<hr>
<p>ENN 7/12/96 07:34CDT<br>
<br>
BELFAST (ENN) - Northern Ireland continues to be on the verge of explosion. Three police officers were shot 
and slightly wounded in northern Belfast during the early hours of Friday. They were the first police officers to 
be shot in Northern Ireland since 1994. It is not known who fired the shots.<br>
<br>
Police said that in Londonberry 900 gasoline bombs were thrown during the night by Catholic rioters. Eleven 
police officers and 40 civilians were injured in violence there.<br>
<br>
In Belfast, the Royal Ulster Constabulary said that two officers were shot at about 1:45 a.m. during clashes with 
youths who were hijacking vehicles and throwing gasoline bombs. One officer was struck in the hand and 
another in the ankle. Another officer was shot about 15 minutes later in another neighborhood. Two of the three 
officers were treated and released from the hospital.</p>
<hr>
<p>ENN 7/13/96 08:50CDT<br>
<br>
BELFAST (ENN) - Police were fired upon in Northern Ireland overnight. Rioters also threw gasoline bombs at 
the police to vent their anger over traditional Protestant marches through Catholic neighborhoods. For the 
second straight night there was rioting and burning and hijacking of vehicles in the Catholic districts of Belfast, 
Londonberry and several other Northern Irish towns. The minority Catholics in the province are angered by a 
police decision to allow two Protestant marches through Catholic districts on Thursday and Friday. The 
marches are carried out every July to celebrate 17th Century victories over Catholics and can be interpreted as 
nothing more than Protestants rubbing a, what would be considered today as a meaningless victory, into the 
faces of Catholics.<br>
<br>
In the western part of Belfast, youths threw gasoline bombs at a police-army barracks. Police at the barracks 
fired flares into the air so they could see their attackers and fired some plastic bullets to disperse a crowd in the 
street about the throw more projectiles.<br>
<br>
It was reported that gunmen from two directions fired more than 12 shots at another police barracks. Police did 
return fire, but no one was reported hurt. Witnesses said that the gunmen were members of the Irish Republican 
Army (IRA). The two nights of Catholic rioting were preceded by four nights of violence by Protestants in 
Belfast and in other areas of Northern Ireland.</p>
<hr>
<p>ENN 7/14/96 09:02CDT<br>
<br>
ENNISKILLEN, NORTHERN IRELAND (ENN) - Fierce violence continued in Northern Ireland on 
Saturday night. A car bomb exploded at a rural hotel on Sunday morning. Two people were reported wounded 
by the blast. The Irish Republican Army (IRA) quickly denied any responsibility for the explosion.<br>
<br>
The bomb exploded outside of a hotel near the town of Enniskillen, which is located about 80 miles southwest 
of Belfast. It was the first bombing in Northern Ireland since the 1994 IRA cease fire. In a one-line statement to 
Irish State radio and television, the IRA said that it &quot;was not involved in the attack on the Killyhevlin Hotel in 
Enniskillen.&quot;<br>
<br>
The bomb was hidden in an Isuzu sports utility vehicle parked at the hotel. The explosive device detonated less 
than 30 minutes after two telephone warnings were called in. The explosion left a 13-foot wide crater and 
started several cars in the parking lot on fire.<br>
<br>
During the night, police had to repel mobs of Catholics who threw gasoline bombs, bricks and rocks at them in 
parts of Belfast and Londonberry. Several hundred rioters battled with police in Londonberry until dawn. It was 
estimated that 1,000 gasoline bombs were thrown and that several vehicles, a post office and a pub were 
destroyed by fire. Police reportedly fired hundreds of plastic bullets at the rioters.</p>

<H3>EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT IN THE 90's </H3>
<P>

<P>
<HR>
Management needs to continue to change as economical and social
factors dictate.  In the emergency services, as well as
elsewhere, these changes require that we re-evaluate the
practice and reality of our management and leadership styles. 
In order to do so, however, it becomes necessary to gain a basic
understanding of the dynamics of our culture in the coming
decade. The 90's must become the age of productivity.  Not just
lip-service to the concept, but actual practice of the
principles of doing more with less must occur.
<P> 
There are very real reasons for this statement. They involve the
current burden on the average taxpayer and the past practices of
many government agencies.  Many governmental units have allowed
bureaucracy and waste to "bloat" payrolls with workers that
accomplish little except the filling of time and space. All too
frequently, in our striving for even larger sections, bureaus,
divisions, and departments, we have created jobs that perform
little meaningful function. The concept that "bigger is better"
has prevailed throughout many governments. For with size, comes
power....or so it has been believed.  After all, any manager
that doesn't attempt to increase his/her budget every year,
isn't much of a manager....are they?? 
<P>
In all too many cities, counties, and states, positions have
been created that do not assist in any way to accomplish the
overall goal of the organization.  These positions may
contribute to the internal or political fortunes of the manager
or elected official that got them the job, but contribute little
to the performance of the organizational mission. With these
mindless, make-work jobs, go even more mindless and futile
salaries that are coming out of the pockets of the taxpayer.
<P> 
Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on who has the job,
today's governmental managers have often been required to
"work-around", "hide", or "take care of" any number of
"do-nothing" employees that are under his/her charge.  This
author has come to the conclusion that a reasonable and prudent
manager must resist whatever political or internal pressures may
be brought to bear, while in the pursuit of employee excellence
and productivity.  To do otherwise, has been shown to contribute
to the eventual overall decline of both the manager and the
organization.  Sometimes, being a responsible and truly
effective manager has placed the practitioner at professional
risk. It has been shown, however, to be ultimately the most
acceptable alternative.
<P>   
The economic circumstances of the 90's are sure to cause are
examination of the productivity of EVERY employee.  Competent
fiscal managers and efficiency experts have come to government,
and with them, new awareness and expectations on the part of
chief executives and the public. It would appear that the public
sector of employment has to learn the lessons of failure that
have plagued both the private and public sector in the past.
<P> 
Corporate America recognized the need for down-sizing and
productivity in the 1970's and 80's.  A major change in the
infrastructure of industry occurred.  The traditional dirty,
low-tech, manpower intensive, industries were suffering from
their non-productive approach to producing steel, building cars,
and other heavy labor jobs.  The Japanese, Germans, Koreans,
Chinese, and others began to dominate the conventional heavy
industries with modern management methods and computerization. 
Due to its inability to become productive, America's heavy
industrial base has practically suffered a slow and painful
death.
<P> 
The resurgence of industry in America has been fueled by a new
and imaginative approach to leadership and management. It has
been rooted in producing the greatest good with the fewest
resources.  Productivity has been studied and those functions
that can be computerized or eliminated by more efficient means
are quickly being reorganized.  Many organizations have found
themselves forcing layoffs or early retirements in order to make
room for the worker that is technically motivated and prepared
to function in the future's more automated environment.
<P> 

Tomorrow's workplace will undoubtedly require a more productive
employee. The manager of that employee had better be prepared to
organize and plan that productivity.  He/shemust derive a long
and short range set of measurable goals and objectives that can
be instituted into employee training and motivational programs. 
The days of governmental "ghost-payrollers" appear to be long
gone. Government accountability is occurring, either
voluntarily, or at the behest of regulatory agencies such as the
U.S. Attorney's public corruption task force.
<P>
<HR>   
<H4>CONCLUSION </H4>
<P>
The choice is up to you.... As an emergency manager, you can
voluntarily and vigorously move into the 90's with a renewed
commitment to quality and productivity;  or, you can continue
with outmoded, bureaucratic, and patronizing approaches to
management, of the past.  The success or failure of your career
undoubtedly depends on the choice that you make. It's time to
reexamine your own commitment to excellence and an increase in
productivity in your organization.
<P>  



What have you done recently to better motivate your employees ? 
What have you done to analyze a problem area of your operational
area and change it for the better?  What kind of systems do you
have in place to monitor the effectiveness of your employees? 
Do they all have measurable goals and objectives to accomplish?
How many "hidden skills" of your employees have you discovered
within the past year?  What new training programs have you put
into place, to adequately prepare your employees for the future
of your organization? At the risk of using a clich; you are
either part of the solution or part of problem.
<P> 



 Tomorrow's managers must PLAN productivity and effective
resource utilization... TODAY! To do otherwise, will undoubtedly
have a negative effect on both their career and personal
development.  We must learn what we can from the private sector
and use that knowledge to manage our resources in the most
effective manner possible. In this way, we accomplish the
greatest good for the largest number of people.  Everyone will
benefit from planned productivity in emergency service
management.
<P>  

<B>Start TODAY!</B>
<P>

<TITLE>Ten Steps to Excellence</TITLE>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:       07-01-92       1600HRS. CDT

<H2>  TEN STEPS TO ACHIEVEMENT OF EXCELLENCE</H2>
<BR>
                    
 BY:  Clark Staten<BR>
                
  Executive Director
<BR>
           Emergency Response & Research Institute
<P>

During each of our lives, we set within ourselves, patterns
that help to determine the success or failure of our efforts.
Psychologists tell us that we either consciously or
subconsciously write "scripts" for our minds to follow.  The
content of these "thought processes" is believed to be self-
determined and controllable.
<P>

Of course, outside influences or stimuli can have some
measure of influence on the make-up of these thoughts and
beliefs;  ultimately the "scripts" themselves are composed of
our preconceived and conditioned responses to our
environment.  Therefore, the individual reply to a negative
experience or situation is controlled by each individual's
personal ability to run the "right script" or "internal
program" to allow that person to effectively cope with or
manage the negative influence or circumstance.  Conversely,
positive influences and stimuli need to be translated into
additional "input programming" to foster a sense of well
being and confidence that will enable additional and greater
achievement.
<P>

While this may seem a rather clinical and analytical approach
to behavior understanding and modification, it is presented
for the purpose of explaining that we CAN control our own
destinies and the way that we respond to everyday conflicts
and challenges.  Additionally, it is the basis for setting
productive patterns of achievement that will eventually
result in excellence. In other words..... WE ARE WHAT WE
THINK AND HOW WE PLAN!!
<P>
<HR>
<H4>I. Decision Making and a Focus</H4>
The first step to planning a successful life and career is to
analyze and decide what is really important to the individual
who is making the plan.  For some, this will involve making a
great deal of money;  for others it will entail the creation
of a great work of art. The primary step must encompass the
basic wants and needs of the person making the decisions,
rather than the perceptions and wants of others. Far to many
people have become failures because they aspired to fulfill
the desires of others. Determining one's own fulfillment is
the key to the future planning of one's life focus.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>II. Goal Setting; the Path to our Focus</H4>
In order to understand or perceive any real progress or
personal sense of achievement, an individual must ascertain
certain goals.  These goals must be determined by the
individual concerned, as being significantly important to
his/her overall best interest and part of a larger plan for
accomplishment of their life's focus.
<P>
These goals may be large or small, seemingly significant to
others or not; they must, however, exist with clarity in the
mind of the person doing the planning. The goals should be
written down and reviewed for thoroughness.  Accomplishment
deadlines should be set and honored.  Establishment of a
criteria list of acceptable outcomes should be undertaken.
Otherwise, it becomes practically impossible to measure
success or failure and thus provide positive or negative
feedback to our personal sense of fulfillment.
<P
<HR>
<H4>III. Commitment is the Key</H4>
The key to completion of goals and subsequently to
achievement of our life's focus is Commitment. Without it,
little has ever been accomplished in the history of man.
Success often starts with the mere existence of the
Commitment to change and improve. By committing ourselves to
accomplish the goals that we have determined, we take that
first step to the achievement of excellence.  Commitment is
what transforms promises and hopes into reality.  It is an
internal adherence to personal integrity and accomplishment.
Therefore, Commitment to our focus and completion of goals
is paramount to excellence.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>IV. Knowledge is Necessary</H4>
Achievement is based in knowledge.... of oneself, of the
topic that we have chosen as our focus, of peripheral
subjects that will help us to our goals.  Learning is not
always a formal process. Often, it is an aggregation of
experiences that prepare us for further progress. While
formal education is necessary and can provide us with the
basic building blocks of knowledge, it is frequently not the
prime contributing factor to excellence.  The application of
knowledge is far more important than the accumulation of it.
However, the failure to be educationally prepared for any
field of endeavor is a critical flaw in the overall plan for
achievement. You must have the knowledge to recognize a true
opportunity when it presents itself.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>V.  Failures will occur</H4>
Failure is inevitable for those that try to accomplish any
given difficult task.  It often is a method of learning about
the things that don't or won't work. Thomas Edison was said
to have failed hundreds of times during his invention of the
light bulb.  He, however, looked upon each failure as one
more possible alternative on the path to ultimate success.
This persistence of purpose is a hallmark of those that are
extremely successful.  Failures will occur in any
circumstance; the winner is he/she who learns from these
experiences and then renews his or her Commitment to
excellence.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>VI. The Cyclical Planning Process</H4>
Following failure or the achievement of a goal, the prudent
achiever will stop to assess the results of that effort.
This assessment should serve to facilitate the foundation for
the a new round of goal-setting and modification of our
focus. Constant measurement of our success or failures
affords us the opportunity to modify or delete goals that do
not serve our ultimate purpose.
<P>
A frequently encountered problem is that upon completion of a
goal, people tend to rest "on their laurels" or participate
in destructive behavior that is contradictory to the
achievement of it.  For instance, the person that has lost
weight, "rewards" him\herself with a large meal and enters
back into the behavior that created the problem in the first
place.  A far more productive or meaningful approach, would
involve rewarding oneself by buying some new clothes that
would further enhance one's appearance and reinforce the loss
of additional weight.
<P>

It is recommended that each accomplishment be used as a
springboard or stepping stone to further achievement.
Cyclical analysis can then become part of a larger planning
process in an endless progression of successes.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>VII. Progression of Achievement</H4>
Excellence is best achieved in small steps that encompass a
greater whole. A productive and reinforcing method of goal-
setting involves the breaking of any large task (or our
overall focus) into manageable segments, with the easiest
parts to be accomplished first.  By actually achieving
success after success, we begin to establish a repetitive
pattern of achievement that leads to even greater
accomplishment. Success, like failure, tends to be a trend.
Continued successes encourage continued successes. Enough
successes eventually comprise ultimate excellence.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>VIII. Resource Utilization</H4>
One of the important steps on the road to excellence is the
appropriate use of resources.  Some of these resources are
not tangible in nature.  Maximum utilization of God-given
gifts, friendships, relationships, and information is often
necessary to extract the greatest possible good from any
circumstance.  Caution is urged, however, in the exploitation
of others.  The greatest secret of using the knowledge and
ability of others is to insure that they ALWAYS benefit from
the experience.  To do otherwise will undoubtedly,
eventually, result in the loss of the friendship,
relationship, or information resource.
<P>
Other resources are material and obtained in finite
quantities.  In today's society, the use of technological and
financial assets probably ranks among the highest priorities
of entrepreneurs and those that strive for excellence. For
some, the accumulation of wealth appears to be a "Yardstick"
by which they can measure their degree of success or failure.
Undoubtedly, the effective use of all available assets will,
in large part, determine the ultimate success or failure of
any worldly enterprise.  The use of lesser technologies (when
better ones are economically available) has frequently been
the failing of various businesses.  A failure to
appropriately manage and allocate funding resources has been
the cause of ruin for many otherwise worthy individuals.
<P>
In one's personal life it is a necessity, of course, to
manage one's money in a responsible way.  However, it should
be noted that the accumulation of money is probably not a
very good determining factor in gauging relative success.
Financially "poor" people can be successful, if they have
accomplished the goals that they have established and are
attaining the substance of "their focus", whatever that might
be.  Achievement of one's stated personal objectives might be
a better measurement of success than money.  Amazingly,
people that accomplish what they have thoughtfully planned to
do, often find themselves to be financially secure.
<P>
Millionaires have gained financial wealth, but may not
consider themselves successful until they become
billionaires.  A painter, on the other hand, may have little
financial wealth during the creation of his work, but gains a
great deal in the process of creation and may eventually
profit financially from it.  In other words, the pursuit and
attainment of a goal, quickly, may become more valuable than
the resulting accumulation of material resources.  Happiness
in one's endeavor and satisfaction with the outcome of that
effort would appear to be a prime directive in this strategy
for excellence.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>IX. Persistence is the Answer</H4>
Regardless of any other principal that is presented here for
your consideration, the practice of persistence will prevail
when other strategies have failed.  Once committed to a focus
and goals; a continual, grinding, grudging, sweating, and
diligent effort is necessary to accomplish the end outcome
objective....excellence.  Little has ever been gained by
half-hearted or sporadic attempts at anything.  Persistence
is difficult, and it's easy to become discouraged and quit.
Those that have prevailed in almost every field of
endeavor, however, have shown a common trait...that of
persistence.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>X. The Courage for Attainment</H4>
One of the often forgotten facets in the pursuit of
excellence is that of personal courage.  Courage is a
prerequisite to the effort of accomplishing the other
suggestions in this strategy for success. It is the courage of
self-conviction and self-denial. It is a courage of personal
integrity and ethical behavior while in the pursuit of
attainment. It is the capacity to forge ahead when you are
afraid of the inevitable failure. It is the endowment of the
human spirit to feats of mental and physical effort that are
thought inhuman. It is the genius unleashed on a seemingly
insurmountable problem. Courage is what will allow you to
face the fear of fear itself and achieve greatly in the
process. YOU must have the courage to succeed and  in
continued success, you will have accomplished excellence.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>EXCELLENCE</H4>
To paraphrase a very smart man; excellence is ultimately.... persevering 
when others think the task is too difficult, risking more than others 
think is healthy, caring more than many think is prudent, and expecting
more than others think is possible.

<H2>STREET GANGS COME TO THE SOUTH PACIFIC ...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

Have you ever heard or come into the contact with any of the following street gangs?  The Devil's Henchmen?  Satan's Slaves? The Headhunters?  The Grim Reapers?  No, you won't find any of these gangbangers on the streets of Los Angeles or Newark or Chicago or New York or even in Omaha -- you'll find them in the cities of -- of all places -- New Zealand.
<P>

Gangs are reported to be on the rise in one of the most unusual and remote places in the world.  Their gang names and insignias seem to be patterned after their American counterparts.  They even conduct drive-by shootings -- just like you'll find on the streets of Los Angeles.
<P>

One politician told the New Zealand parliament, "These are not packs of hooligans who occasionally rough up a pub and occasionally pillage a small town.  This is organized crime.  It strikes at the very heart of civilized society."
<P>

Police in New Zealand, a country with a population of about three million people and located southeast of Australia, say that there are 70 major gangs in the country with about 4,000 hard-core gang members.  If you include associates and prospective wanna-be members, that number grows to about 11,000.
<P>

A police officer, who works in an intelligence unit, said, "We're not talking about guys playing with their bikes anymore.  We're talking about the need to control territory ... because it's the control of money."
<P>

There is great concern amongst New Zealand law enforcement officials about the New Zealand gangs forming links with Asian triads.  The police intelligence officer said, "The hold that these guys are getting is becoming more serious.  It's becoming a bigger, more international thing." In April, police said that an Asian triad tried to hire a New Zealand gang to kill a police detective because he was investigating illegal drug shipments from Hong Kong.
<P>

New Zealand police have classified their gangs into three groups.  They are: ethnic gangs, motorcycle gangs, and youth gangs.  Real growth has been seen in the youth gangs, especially on the North Island.
<P>

1996 has been a year that has seen a major increase in gang violence.  In the past two months, there have been three gang-related drive-by shootings in the city of Christchurch, which is located on the South Island.  One innocent woman was shot and wounded, in one incident, as she sat in her car at a stop light.  She was caught in the crossfire between two rival gangs. Also on the South Island, the city of Invercargill has seen shootings, attempted bombings, gang fights and car rammings.
<P>

Sounding like a police spokesman from Boston, a New Zealand police detective related the following that is more than familiar to police officers in American cities -- the detective said, "Where gang headquarters are set up, the impact on the immediate neighborhood is just huge."  The detective is from the South Island city of Dunedin, where gang-related crimes have doubled in just the past nine months.  He added, "Real estate markets drop through the floor and people are scared in their own homes, which is very sad ... because that sort of thing has never really happened before."
<P>

Since this is a relatively new phenomena in New Zealand, police, there, really don't have a handle on the situation. It can be imagined that they may contact some U.S. law enforcement agencies for some advice to combat the problem. Like ... we really have our own gang problems in hand?

<HR>
Editor's Note: Today is the beginning of Arson Awareness Week
in the United States.  We present the following article that was
put out by the U.S. Fire Administration.  It contains some very
interesting statistics.
<HR>
<H2>U.S. FIRE ADMINISTRATION COMBATS NATION'S ARSON PROBLEM</H2>
<H4>Arson Awareness Week Targets Juvenile Firesetting</H4>
<P>

WASHINGTON (FEMA) -- Everyday brings news of a serious
national problem - arson.  This year, Arson Awareness Week,
May 5-12, focuses on juvenile firesetting because young people
currently represent about 55 percent of arson arrests, according
to the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), a part of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
<P>

 "Arson is not a hidden crime.  It's murder by fire,  a violent
crime against property and people.  Every year arson kills 700
people, destroys 100,000 buildings and costs more than
$1.4 billion," U.S. Fire Administrator Carrye Brown said.
"There are, however, effective ways citizens, along with law
enforcement and the fire service, can ensure the culprits are
brought to justice."
<P>

Brown said that everyone should take steps to prevent arson
in their communities. Arson exists in various forms -- juvenile
firesetting, vandalism, pyromania, a murder weapon, and
concealment of a crime.  "We must identify the faces of arson.
In addition to kids setting fires, incidents of adult firesetting are
increasing, " she said.
<P>

Charles Evancho, national arson expert and chief of arson,
Detroit Fire Department said, "Arson is one of the most
difficult crimes to prosecute successfully.  Often the criminal
justice system does not view arson as a serious crime.  The
challenge is to develop sentencing for adults and juveniles."
<P>

Last year, USFA, provided $2 million to 12 states to develop
anti-arson programs.  In Colorado, for example, USFA grants
support a juvenile firesetter prevention program in partnership
with a treatment center for abused children.
<P>

"We need grant programs and partnerships like this," Brown
said.  "Arson must be tackled on several fronts and people
must protect themselves by strengthening prevention and
apprehension efforts."
<P>

Brown offered the following advice:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>-- Ask local law enforcement and fire officials to identify
buildings at risk for arson.
<LI>-- Organize arson block watches to monitor run-down and
vacant buildings, and report suspicious activity.
<LI>-- Keep boxes, trash, wood and other combustibles away
from buildings.
<LI>-- Make sure everyone in the family knows two ways to escape
from their home.  Install smoke detectors on each level of your
home and check the batteries every month.  Seconds count in
any fire.
</UL>
<P>

USFA supports the nation's firefighters with training, fire data
analysis, public education and research in fire protection
technologies.  For more information about arson and other fire
issues, call FEMA's Fax-On-Demand at (202) 646-FEMA.  For

<H3>NEW JERSEY STATE POLICE IN SHOOTOUT</H3>
<BR>
by James J. Fay, ENN NYC-Metro Correspondent
<P>
Two individuals wanted for the carjacking and beating of a 17-year-old 
West Virginia youth, were shot by NJ State Troopers on the New Jersey 
Turnpike in the vicinity of Carteret, NJ, at approximately Exit 11, on 
Wednesday, December 6, at approximately 1200 Hrs., EST. One of the fugitives died from the shooting.
<P>
Troopers on patrol on the Turnpike observed a red Porsche traveling at a 
very high rate of speed.  The Porsche did not stop or slow down when pursued by police, resulting in a crash of the Porshe into a guardrail on the 
Turnpike.  The occupants of the car ran from the accident, to a creek 
surrounded by tall grass. At that point, one of the occupants pulled a gun 
on pursuing Troopers.  The troopers responded to the threat and fired at the two, killing one, and wounding the other.
<P>
It was subsequently determined that the red Porsche, bearing West Virginia
license plates, was stolen from its owner in West Virginia on November 27th. 
At that time, the teenage owner offered the two a ride and they later beat 
the youth and escaped with his car.
<P>
The surviving fugitive was reported in satisfactory condition with two gunshot 
injuries to his arm.

<H2>150 Drug Smugglers Arrested in Nationwide Sweep</H2>
By Paul Anderson, Metro Correspondent
<P>

CHICAGO (ENN) - Federal law enforcement agents using high-tech
eavesdropping devices gathered evidence against Mexican drug
smugglers for more than eight months in one of the largest
drug operations in history.  The sweep was called, Operation
Zorro II.  Arrested were 150 drug smugglers who thought they
were mostly unseen as they calmly drove vans and autos packed
with pure cocaine to some of the largest cities in the U.S.
<P>

Federal authorities said on Thursday that they have crippled
the Mexican-Colombian cocaine smuggling ring that went from
coast-to-coast in the United States.  U.S. Attorney James B.
Burns told a news conference on Thursday, "This investigation
has driven a stake through the heart of one of the largest,
most sophisticated organizations bringing vast quantities of
cocaine into the country."
<P>

While the investigation, that started in September of 1995, was
going on, the smugglers moved more than $100 million of cocaine
into the U.S.  The smugglers hid the drugs inside of car trunks,
wheel wells and other places inside of autos and crossed the
U.S.-Mexican border in California, Arizona and Texas.  The
drugs were then taken to stash houses of wholesalers in
Los Angeles and then would be distributed to Mexican and Colombian
drug dealers all across the country.
<P>

Law Enforcement officials believe that the operation will put a
huge dent into the smuggling done by the ring that is headquartered
in Sinaloa, Mexico.  But authorities concede that other Mexican
drug rings will probably pick up the slack and keep the cocaine
flowing in from Colombia.
<P>

The cocaine is known to have come from the Cali cartel and it
was sold to drug dealers in Chicago, New York City, Los Angeles,
Philadelphia, Miami, Newark, Richmond and several cities in
Texas.
<P>

Among those arrested on Thursday were a New York City Police 
officer and a sergeant in the New York National Guard.  Authorities
said that these two men were used as drug couriers and moved
cocaine from Miami and/or Richmond to the streets of New York City.
<P>

The investigation utilized more than 100 court-authorized wiretaps.
Authorities were also able to clone pagers that were used by the
smugglers.  This helped in learning when and where the drug couriers
were moving the drugs.
<P>

While making many of the arrests on Thursday, agents were able to
seize six tons of cocaine.  Federal authorities said that they
are increasingly focusing on stopping drug shipments that are
coming through the State of Florida.
<P>

Special Agent Charles E. Riley III, the chief of one of the FBI's
organized crime-drug sections in Washington, said, "They're not
stupid criminals.  They'll look at what law enforcement is doing
and spend the money to counteract it.  The cartels moved to the
southwest border, knowing it would take us time to react.  Heaven
knows what their next step will be."
<P>

In Chicago, on Thursday, several arrests were made in the City
and in many of its suburbs, including Cicero, Des Plaines and
Aurora.  When asked if the cocaine trade in Chicago has been
crippled by the federal operation, Chicago Police Superintendent
Matt Rodriguez said that we would have to wait and see how the
price for drugs on the street are affected.  That is the best
indicator.

<H2>FDNY EXPERIENCES BUSY DAY WITH HAZMAT AND FIRE OPERATIONS...</H2>
By Jim Fay  ENN NYC-NJ Correspondent
<P>

Tuesday, January 30, 1996 was an exceptionally busy work
day for firefighters and Manhattan Dispatchers of the FDNY,
with a steam explosion and several fires of some magnitude
all within the same period of time and area.
<P>

At approximately 1100 hrs., EST, the FDNY, as well as NYC*EMS
and NYPD Emergency Service Units responded to a report of
an explosion at the midtown Manhattan location of 3rd Ave. and
East 56 Street. This explosion turned out to be a steam
discharge in the street, but a fear of asbestos contamination
required a response of Fire Department and EMS HazMat specialized
response to the heavily traveled area, including the FDNY
DeCon, or Decontamination Unit.
<P>

About thirty minutes later, a residential high-rise fire at
The Bronx location of East 149 Street and Park Ave, directly
across from Lincoln Hospital,  started in the compactor
garbage disposal cute of the 27 story building.  This ultimately
required the response of a 2nd Alarm response from
the FD, as well a numerous BLS, ALS, and the Multi Patient
MerVan from EMS.  The building generally houses elderly persons
and all apartments had to be searched for possible occupants.
Late reports at the scene state that numerous persons required
treatment for smoke inhalation, but no exact number was available.
<P>

Before this fire was under control, a 2nd Alarm was transmitted
back in Manhattan, at the West Side location of Columbus Ave. and
West 104 St., for a gas-line fed fire in the basement of an
occupied multiple dwelling.  By this time FDNY companies from
Queens and Brooklyn were required to relocate to uncovered
firehouses in Manhattan.
<P>

While FDNY Dispatchers were still attempting to provide
adequate coverage for Manhattan, an "All Hands" fire in a
NYC Housing Authority Project at 55 LaSalle Street, near Broadway,
in Harlem, was being fought in a 30th floor apartment.
This fire resulted in one serious civilian injury, designated
as a "10-45 code 2" by the Fire Department.

<H3>THE NYC*EMS SPECIAL OPERATIONS DIVISION...</H3>
By Steve Macko, ENN Managing Editor
<P>

The Special Operations Division (SOD) of the New York City
Emergency Medical Service (NYC*EMS) has the responsibilty
to respond to all Mass Casualty Incidents (MCI) in the 
biggest city in the United States.  But the unit also has
a number of other various duties.
<P>

All members of the unit are trained in such areas as: confined
space rescue, transit rescues (Involving trains and subways and
auto extrication), on-scene emergency management, and incident
management.  They are essentially a cross or a mixture of the
NYPD Emergency Services Unit (ESU), and an FDNY Rescue and Tactical
Support Unit.
<P>

The unit will respond to second alarm fires, subway incidents,
incidents involving airliners or anything that involves five
or more patients.  The members of unit are very well motivated
and really to a large extent have free rein on what incidents
that they will respond to.
<P>

Members of the NYC*EMS SOD are all Hazardous Materials technicians
and their main responsibility at the scene of a HazMat incident is
to provide Decontamination (Decon).
<P>

The SOD members are issued pagers and radios that they carry at
all times because they are on 24 hour call.  The SOD covers the 
entire City of New York with their Emergency Response Squad, which 
is a converted former NYPD ESU Radio Emergency Patrol vehicle 
(REP - one of the smaller NYPD ESU units, not one of those big rigs 
the size of a heavy rescue vehicle.)  The Emergency Response Squad 
is manned by two EMT-D's.  It carries all of the decon equipment,
Basic Life Support (BLS) equipment and even a generator so that the
unit is able to provide power and/or lighting at the scene of an
incident.
<P>

The unit takes part in all the pre-planning and does provide coverage
at the locations of special events.  Some recent events that the unit
has covered are: New Year's Eve in Times Square, the New York City
Marathon, Pope John Paul II's recent visit, and the 50th Anniversary
of the United Nations.
<P>

The NYC*EMS unit is headquarted in Brooklyn at East 83rd Street and
Foster Avenue.  The NYC*EMS units 30 Henry and the Advanced Life
Support (ALS) unit 30 X-Ray act as back-up to the SOD.  Both of these 
rigs are 911 response units, but respond to MCI's.  The medics are
Urban Search And Rescue (USAR) trained and can be activated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) should they be needed.
<P>

The NYC*EMS is a very large organization that handles the emergency
medical needs of one of the largest cities in the world.  They are
comprised of a mixture of BLS and ALS units, unlike Chicago which
is all ALS ambulances.
<P>

The New York EMS system appears to operate a bit different than
the EMS system run by the Chicago Fire Department.  If a call comes
in for the potential of an MCI, the NYC*EMS rolls a number of rigs
to scene as soon as possible.  An example of this would be an
incident that happened at 1915 EST on January 3rd.  There was a
report of a Metro North train on fire in The Bronx at 155th Street
and the Major Deegen Expressway.  First reports indicated that the
engine of the train was on fire and had derailed.  It was believed
that about 600 people were aboard.  Immediately, the NYC*EMS
responded with four ALS, four BLS ambulances, an assistant chief,
Emergency Response Squad 3, MERV ONE (Major Emergency Response
Vehicle), and two NYC*EMS patrol field officers.  The FDNY arrived 
upon the scene and quickly knocked the fire down.  There was no
derailment and it wasn't even necessary to evacuate the train.
There were no injuries and the train proceeded on to its destination
soon after.
<P>

By comparison, a reported fire on a passenger train in Chicago
would have produced a full Still and Box Alarm assignment, but
there would had been nowhere near the EMS resources immediately
responding to such an incident.  The CFD incident commander on the
scene would had to assess the situation and THEN would had ordered
what resources would be required.  Also, Chicago does not have the
heavy rescue resources that New York City has.  Besides the FDNY
Rescue companies, New York City also has the NYPD ESU.
<P>

It appears that NYC*EMS has a pretty good thing going, but there
is some uncertainty in the organization at this time.  The NYC*EMS
is due to be merged soon into the New York City Fire Department.
Many medics are excited about the prospect, but are not sure how
the merger will effect them and their current duties.
<P>
<B>The author wishes to thank NYC*EMS SOD member Frank McCarton for
his great assistance with this article.</B>

<H2>THREAT OF TERRORISM FURTHER INCREASES</H2>
<P>
By: Paul Anderson, Metro Correspondent
<P>
Chicago, IL  - The stage is set for yet another round of  major violence
directed against the United States, according to Clark Staten of the Chicago-
based Emergency Response and Research Institute (ERRI).  Staten says that
several recent events should prompt Americans to be aware of the very real
threat of continued terrorist savagery directed at the United States and her
allies.
<P>


First in significance was the June 27, 1993 retaliatory raid on the
intelligence headquarters of Saddam Hussein in downtown Bagdad.  The Tomahawk
missile strike was directed against the Iraqi Intelligence Service Headquarters
after an April 12th plot was uncovered to assassinate former President George
Bush during his recent visit to Kuwait to celebrate the allied victory over
Iraq in 1991.  By June 28,  General Saber Abdul-Aziz Douri, head of the Iraqi
intelligence service, was quoted by the Iraqi News Service as saying, "The
aggressors returned to their evil and blind hatred...cursed be what they are
doing".
<P>   


"We will pursue anyone who dares to attack our dear Iraq and severely
punish these evil insects", the general concluded.  The next day, the Iraqi
backed Al-Thawra newspaper continued the tirade by charging that President
Clinton had carried out the attack only to bolster his "eroded popularity and
credibility...domestically".   Both sources indicated that various officials
within the Iraqi  government had vowed vengeance against the United States.
<P>


Counter-terrorist analysts say that they fear that the only viable avenue for
Saddam Hussein's revenge on the United States is through the use of terrorism.
Even though Iraq has reportedly  repaired or replaced as much as 80% of its
domestic military equipment, experts say that Iraqi military strength and
morale is insufficient to allow Hussein to undertake another serious attack
against any nearby country.
<P>  


More difficult for Iraq would be a direct combat
confrontation with the United States or her allies in the Middle East. Most
analysts say that even Saddam Hussein, who has never displayed a  great deal
of restraint nor military competence regarding any conflict with the United
States, would have to recognize the foolhardiness of a direct attack on the
United States.  A preferable revenge for Iraq would involve having a
"surrogate terrorist" carry out a domestic attack that Hussein could
privately take credit for.
<P>


Second in concern on anti-terrorist operatives is the recent arrest of Moslem
Fundamentalist Sheik Omar Abel-Rahman.  The sheik, who has been suspected of
condoning "jihad" or "Holy War" against both the governments of Egypt and that
of the United States, was taken into custody on  July 3, 1993 for alleged
violations of  U. S. immigration laws and failing to report his past criminal
record on entry visa documents.
<P>  


Abel-Rahman's arrest has prompted a rapid and threatening response from 
Islamic Fundamentalists throughout the Middle-east. On July 2nd, shortly 
after Rahman's surrender to U.S. Immigration authorities, the Egyptian Jamaa 
Islamiya issued a statement saying that if the Sheik was prosecuted or 
extradited to Egypt, that they would begin a world-wide terror campaign 
against the United States.  Only Monday July 5th, the Islamic Jihad issued a 
warning in Jerusalem that it would kidnap American citizens in retribution 
for the prosecution or deportation of Abel-Rahman.
<P>


Other indicators point to the likelihood of continued violence.  In an
unprecedented move,  the United States State Department on Tuesday June 28,
1993 issued a world-wide warning to travelers within the continental United
States.  Although warnings of increased threat levels have been routinely
issued for countries where terrorist attacks have taken place, or can be
anticipated, this is the first such warning in recent memory that included the
entire American continent.  When questioned, State Department spokesperson Mike
McCurry said that the warning "rises out of a general sense that it is a good
thing for all U.S. citizens to be more careful...at a time like this".  The
State Department press office did, however, release a brief notice that it had
"no specific and credible information on particular threats at this time,
either domestic or foreign".
<P>


Early on July 6, Col. Mohammar Kaddafi of Libya issued a warning that President
Clinton and the United States had "blundered" in the recent missile attack on
Bagdad, and that the United States should expect  "a lot more terrorism" in the
near future.  Kaddafi spoke of increasingly violent and spectacular acts to be
perpetrated expressly for broadcast on the national and international
television.  In a surprise interview with the Washington Times,  Kaddafi warned
President Clinton  to "tend to domestic issues and stop meddling in
international affairs.". 
<P>  

In a more veiled statement,  Col. Kaddafi said that Libya "condemns terrorism" 
and that his country is willing to work with Western countries to abolish it.  
He continued with a call for more trade between the United States and Libya 
and offered to turn over two suspects in the Lockerbie, Scotland Pan Am 103 
bombing for trial in any country besides the United States or Great Britain.  
Most analysts view Kaddafi's statements to be an attempt to mollify his Arab 
and Moslem constituency while hoping to end the United Nations embargo and 
sanctions that have crippled the economy of his cash-strapped country.  
Kaddafi has been mostly silent in recent times, on terrorist issues, since 
an American bombing of his personal compound and military facilities.
<P>


More ominous than the threats are the actual acts of brutality that have
occurred within the past two weeks.  On Friday July 2, 1993, thirty-five (35)
people were killed and another sixty (60) injured when the Madimak Hotel in
Sivas, Turkey was set afire, allegedly by Islamic Fundamentalists.  The attack,
purported to have been carried out by Fundamentalists protesting the
translation and publication of parts of Salman Rushdie's novel  "The Satanic
Verses" in the Turkish language, destroyed a hotel that was hosting a
conference of writers and editors.
<P>  


Rioting reportedly took place in Sivas at the time of the fire, and at least 
thirty-five (35) people were arrested. Witnesses to the incident said that 
the disturbance started shortly after more than 500 people "finished their 
prayers" at a local mosque and spilled out onto the streets and began to 
smash store windows and rampage through the town.  A curfew has been 
established by the Turkish government, and an investigation team sent from 
Ankara to study the violence.
<P>


On the 1st of  July, 1993,  a suspected "ultra-leftist" terrorist organization
fired a home-made rocket at the Yokota Air Force base, which is located thirty
(30) miles from Tokyo.  Police say that they believe that the rocket was fired
to protest and disrupt the Group of Seven (G-7) economic summit that is being
attended by U.S. President Bill Clinton this week.  The projectile struck a
four-story building and caused heavy damage to the walls and windows.
<P>  


The building was in an area frequented by U.S. servicemen and the families of 
those assigned to Yokota Air Force base.  Police sources say that the attack 
is very similar to a previous strike by a the ultra-leftist Chukaka-Ha or 
"Middle Core Party" that occurred several days prior to the 1986 Economic 
summit that was held in  Japan.  The Chukaka-Ha reportedly has some 
Middle-east ties and may have received training and weapons from that region.
<P>


In Seoul, Korea,  a gas boiler in the hotel that was to house President Bill
Clinton while he was on his current trip to the Far-East, unexplainably
exploded on July, 5, 1993.  The early morning explosion caused an evacuation of
the Seoul Grand Hyatt hotel, including several Secret Service officers and
other members of the President's advance party.  Three people were reportedly
injured by the blast and resulting smoke.  While local officials deny the
possibility of "any sort of explosive device", sources close to the
investigation say that no firm conclusions have been drawn as to the actual
cause of the explosion.  Fortunately, President Clinton's stay in Korea was
otherwise uneventful.
<P>


"All of the normally reliable indicators show that we are at great risk of
another terrorist attack in the very near future", said Clark Staten of the
emergency service 'think-tank" - Emergency Response and Research Institute
(ERRI).  "An objective analysis of the available data says that another attack
will occur sometime within the next few weeks...probably in a large city... in
the continental United States",  the veteran emergency manager continued.
Staten, who has been studying terrorism and terrorists for more than ten years,
said that  the "threat level" is higher now than it has been since the Persian
Gulf War.  "The increasing frequency of terrorist acts throughout the world,
combined with the recently monitored rhetoric of several fundamentalist
extremist groups should cause an increased level of awareness and caution on
the part of Americans",  Staten added.
<P>


"Unfortunately, the terrorists have already accomplished a small portion of
their purpose by causing this alarm", Staten said.  "One of their goals is to
spread fear that will cause a change in U.S. government policy, disrupt the
lives of normal citizens... with the hope of eventually causing enough chaos
to undermine belief in the United States government", he continued.  "The
United States can not bow to these threats, nor allow violent acts to be
perpetrated without retaliation." Staten said.  "Governments that have
attempted to peacefully placate fanatical religious and political organizations
have repeatedly suffered the disastrous results of their folly... sadly, the
only thing that the leaders of some of these organizations understand is
revenge and greater violence",  the author of the "Emergency Response Guide
To Terrorism" added.
<P>


"While I sincerely wish that there were some moderate response to these savage
acts of barbarism,  there does not appear to be many options that will
effectively terminate the terrorist's actions without resorting to equal or
greater violence",  Staten said.  "We would hope to circumvent an attack prior
to it's occurrence through means of intelligence gathering and proactive law
enforcement, but the openness of American society makes us particularly
vulnerable to an isolated group of fanatics that is intent on causing mass
casualties",  he continued.  "It is this very freedom and openness of our
borders that have placed us at this risk...paradoxically, it is America's
freedom that allows the insurgents the ability to infiltrate our country and
commit these unspeakable acts...and yet it is these very freedoms that we
are defending", Staten concluded.

<H2>SENATE HEARINGS SAY LOCAL FIRE AND EMERGENCY SERVICES NOT PREPARED...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

This past Wednesday, Oakland, California, Fire Chief Lamont
Ewell, who is also the president of the International Association
of Fire Chiefs, told the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations Wednesday, that it would be the responsibility of local
firefighting, police and emergency medical units to cope with
a terrorist attack that used nuclear, chemical or biological
weapons. He also said that they were not prepared for the challenge.
<P>

Ewell affirmed something that the Emergency Response and Research
Institute (ERRI) in Chicago has been saying for a number of years.  The
chief told the packed Senate hearing room, "It will be local fire
and emergency service organizations ... who have to pick up the
pieces.  Of the overall government efforts to prevent and respond
to terrorist incidents, these local fire, law enforcement and
emergency medical services agencies are the least prepared to
respond to a chemical or biological terrorist incident."
<P>

As a demonstration, Ewell paraded two firemen into the hearing room.
One firefighter was dressed in typical firefighting gear.  The
other wore a fully encapsulated hazardous materials protection suit.
Ewell told the senators that neither was sufficient to protect the
firefighters from some types of chemical or biological attack.
<P>

The chief said that the best option was to have the federal
government train and equip at least 50 emergency personnel in
each of the largest 120 cities in the United States to prepare
for the inevitable eventuality of a terrorist chemical or
biological attack. ERRI, in several previous reports, has suggested the formation of local/regional  joint "strike teams" of specially trained Fire/EMS/Police personnel, who could immediately be "called out" to start of the process of managing the incident and advising other emergency responders.
<P>  

According to Ewell, The needed protective gear for emergency responders would cost
about $450 per person, just about the same as current fully
encapsulated HazMat gear.  Each emergency worker would also need to receive
250 hours training.  The cost for the entire project suggested by Chief Ewell is estimated
to be about $2.7 million. Other experts say that the costs of a truly effective program could be higher.
<P> 

Is a terrorist chemical and/or biological attack inevitable?  A
report released on the same day by the Senate Subcommittee says
that it is.  The report said, "It is not a matter of IF, but rather 
WHEN such an event will occur.  Many of the terrorist groups of today
appear more and more likely to utilize weapons of mass destruction."
<P>

The report said that federal agencies are somewhat better equipped
and trained to handle a terrorist incident that could involve
nuclear, chemical and/or biological weapons, but these same agencies
were hampered by what are considered to be "turf battles", something
not unheard of in regard to any number of federal agencies. 
<P>

These "turf battles" were seen as major failures of the federal
agencies to communicate with local authorities, according to Senate staffers.
This analysis was written after a "full field" exercise that was called "Mirage
Gold" that took place in October of 1994 in New Orleans, Louisiana.
<P>

The senate review of that exercise was highly critical of the role that
the Federal Bureau of Investigation played.  The FBI is officially
designated as the lead agency in a terrorist crisis situation --
BEFORE an explosion or whatever occurs.  The critique said that the
FBI acted in "imperial fashion" and just plain took over the situation,
instead of "leading it". Great difficulty was reported in the transition of control between the FBI and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
<P>

A former U.S. government counter-terrorism coordinator, Morris 
Busby, said that the problem is aggravated by the FBI's "tremendous
operational capabilities."  He also said at Wednesday's hearing,
"They (The FBI) interpret lead agency as -- 'Let's get everybody
out of the way so we can do what we do.'  If you're having turf
battles when you're trying to handle a crisis, you're going to have
real problems," Busby said.
<P>

The report also said that in the 1994 New Orleans exercise, the
FBI did not consider the protection and safety of the general
population should it not had been able to find and disable the
nuclear device that the agents were seeking in the exercise.
The FBI, the critique said, was much too focused on capturing
the perpetrators and overlooked the evidence that others, such as
the U.S. Energy Department's NEST Team and the Defense Department,
needed to disable the nuclear device.
<P>

Other similar training exercises in large cities in the United
States were also said to be far from successful. In fact, ERRI 
has yet to be able to document a "highly successful" major exercise 
involving chemical/biological attacks, anywhere in the United States. 
In a 1995 Los Angeles exercise, it was said that "a number of doctors literally 'threw
in the towel'" and said that they and their facilities had become
contaminated after treating injured and exposed patients. EMS responders had apparently committed the "cardinal sin" of bringing "chemically dirty" patients into medical facilities.
<P>

There is an even more detailed report of an April 11, 1995, training
exercise that was conducted in New York City.  The results of this
mock sarin gas attack on the New York subway system, similar to what
happened in Tokyo, Japan, on March 20, 1995, were said to be so
bad that a follow-up exercise was reportedly canceled by the mayor's
office to avoid potential embarrassment. This no-notice city mobilization
drill occurred at 1900 EST at a Manhattan L-train station, located at 
14th Street and First Avenue.
<P>

In the New York City exercise, the first arriving fire and police
units were said to be theoretically "killed" by exposure to chemical
gas.  Upwards of 100 of the first responders were said to be killed
by their immediate exposure.  Other problems cited were: command posts located
much too close to the scene.  Incompatible radios and frequencies
that hampered communications.  The training situation was described
as "chaotic", at best, until the FDNY's Hazardous Materials Company arrived
upon the scene. 
<P>

A "classified" report on the exercise said that first arriving firefighters
failed to even put on their breathing apparatus.  The first
arriving NYPD officers found out that their police radios did not
work properly in the subway.  The New York Transit Police, who do
have radios that work properly in the subway system, were not
notified of the incident for three to five minutes and responded "late" into the incident.
<P>

The NYPD then set up a "frozen zone" which barred all non-essential
personnel within a radius of 1,000 feet.  However, this "frozen zone's"
size was configured for bombs -- not lethal gas.  Even a reconfiguration
of this "frozen zone" was said to be inadequate and improperly done. Any 
major wind shift could have allowed the poison gas to envelop the command post.
<P>

NYC*EMS crews did not do much better.  Many did not escape making 
potentially deadly mistakes. Even after personnel were informed that there 
was toxic gas in the subway station, they still set up their first triage area inside of
the station. Other EMS providers entered potentially dangerous areas to "rescue" 
patients, and would have died, had the scenario been real. A well known EMS chief, who asked not to be identified, put it all in perspective; "That's what drills are for...to identify the problems and fix them."  We at ERRI couldn't agree more.
<P>

Since 1987, the Emergency Response and Research Institute (ERRI) has been
publishing position papers on this subject and warning emergency responders to 
become prepared for a chemical/biological eventuality.  In light of the Senate investigation, it seems that finally the message is starting to get across -- "First responders must be
prepared for this eventuality."  Emergency planners and agencies that think they are prepared,
should review what happened at the New York City mock gas attack drill
in 1995.  Or better still, review the response of the Tokyo Fire Dept. and EMS services in the March 20th attack by Aum Shin-Rikyo.  In reality, today, few cities in the United States would fare much better in such an exercise.

<H2>U.S. OPTIONS AGAINST LIBYAN TERRORISTS</H2>
<P>
By: Clark Staten, EmergencyNet News Analyst
<P>

Chicago, IL.  Joint Grand Jury indictments in Scotland
and the U.S. District of Columbia signify both an opportunity
and a complex problem for the United States.  While they
show a desire by both governments to bring Libyans
Abdel Basset Ali Al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah to
justice for their alleged bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, they
also present a law enforcement and diplomatic "nightmare".
Neither the United States or Scotland has an extradition
treaty with the country of Libya, where both of the alleged
"intelligence operatives" are said to be residing.
<P>


This perplexing situation causes the United States to
consider what some would suggest are "extra-legal" special
operations to extract the justice that is being demanded by
the families of the 189 Americans that were killed by the
sophisticated explosive device that exploded over Lockerbie
Scotland. The legally binding dual indictments should,
however, serve to add legitimacy to whatever actions are
undertaken by the United States and British authorities to
effect the "arrest" and prosecution of the alleged
terrorists. Various policy precedents that have been
previously set should serve to help guide the decision
making process regarding the pursuit of the Flt. 103
suspects.  An examination of history should help to define
the options that are open to the U.S.
<P>
<HR>


The first option is a comparatively easy one. It involves the
country of Libya deciding to voluntarily extradite the
suspects to stand trial. This option allows the Libyans to
claim that the suspects were "rogue agents" who acted on
their own and without sanction by the Qadhaffi
regime. This option would seem to blunt the possibility of
Mohammar Qadhaffi and the country of Libya being attacked in
some way, as the perpetrators of "state supported terrorism".
Intelligence analysts, however, discount the possibility of
this option, because it is unlikely that
Qadhaffi will admit culpability in the massacre.  He is far
more likely to deny publically any involvement, while
privately touting this bombing as retribution on the "Great
Satan of the United States" for previous attacks on Libya.
<P>
<HR>


The second option that might be considered is largely a
diplomatic one. It concerns the use of condemnation in the
United Nations, economic sanctions, and even a possible
blockade of Libyan ports.  This option would is one
of the safest choices, in that it doesn't require direct
intervention into or against Libya.  It's primary hope is
that economic and public opinion sanctions will cause
Qadhaffi to relent and release the suspects to U.S. or
British custody.  Again, many commentators do not believe
that Qadhaffi will be swayed by opinion or economic
sanctions.
<P>


The country of Libya and Qadhaffi have shown that they, like
Saddam Hussein of Iraq, can be self-supporting and
seemingly independent of any action of the United Nations or
the World Court. In fact, most analysts agree that Qadhaffi
would view "sanctions" as weakness by the United
States and Great Britain.   The United States, however, will
undoubtedly undertake this option at the onset of the
negotiations, so as to maintain a moral "high-ground". The
ultimate success of this option is unlikely.
<P>
<HR>


A third option is one that has been used against "Narco-
Terrorists" in Central and South America. It involves the use
of federal special operations agents (e.g., CIA/SOF), who use
a "smash and grab" method of extracting the Libyan operatives
from their safe haven and rapidly transport them to a nearby
country that has an extradition treaty with the United
States.  This is a far more risky option, because it requires
lightly armed American agents to enter Libya to
undertake the capture.
<P>


This method is frequently used in conjunction with the
assistance of "sleeper" or undercover assets (operatives)
that are already in place in the country of opportunity. This
method requires extensive surveillance of the suspects,
communication, and cooperation with the "arresting force",
before the actual capture. The network of allied
intelligence agents in Libya is thought by many to be very
limited.  This limited capability may preclude using this
method of extradition, but does not rule it out entirely.
<P>
<HR>


The next (fourth) option that is considered "draconian" by
many, involves the use of military/intelligence operatives in
a violent extension of the "smash and grab" theory.  It
causes special operations forces to be used to "terminate the
alleged terrorists with extreme prejudice".  Fortunately or
unfortunately, depending on your point of view, congressional
mandates prohibit the direct assassination of foreign
nationals by U.S. agents.


Anti-terrorist operatives, however, debate the issue and
possibility of "hiring" other foreign nationals to carry out
the killings.  Historically, the Israelis have proven
themselves willing and able to perform "wet work" (political
assassination) against terrorist forces.  In light of
Operation Desert Storm and American intervention on their
behalf, it is possible that Israel could be persuaded to
dispatch the terrorists.  America may not choose to undertake
this option, because it can be viewed in a
negative light by world opinion.
<P>
<HR>


The fifth option would provide for direct military
intervention in the region. It would be configured in a
manner similar to that carried out against Panamanian
strongman Manuel Noreiga.  "Operation Just Cause",
historically, was undertaken to "arrest" Noreiga to stand
trial in the United States for conspiracy to smuggle drugs
into America.  A direct parallel can be drawn to the needed
arrest of the Libyan terrorists. In this light, the use of
force may be considered legitimate in the view of other
nations.  Several Mid-East observers would suggest that at
least tacit approval of adjoining nations would be necessary
before the invasion of Libya.
<P>


This option would require extensive military, logistical
support and planning; it could border on requiring
congressional approval. Members of both houses of congress
could be expected to call this type of operation "gun-boat
diplomacy". Some could suggest that the United States was
waging war on Libya and thus, would require congressional
approval.   The likelihood of that approval, following the
vast expenditures involved in Operation Desert Storm is open
to question.  Many would suggest that the President needs to
focus on domestic issues, rather than to prompt a military
incursion into a small, relatively powerless, country many
miles away.  This option would, however, send a clear
message to insurgents in the Middle East and elsewhere that
the United States will not tolerate violence against its
citizens.
<P>
<HR>


Another (sixth) option would place "the illness of
retaliation" on another nation.  It would suggest that
Scotland (through Great Britain) should take the appropriate
actions to cause the arrest and trial of the suspects. It
would base this decision on the fact that the crime occurred
in Scotland's jurisdiction and they should be the ones to
prosecute the atrocity.  This seemingly "isolationist"
viewpoint avoids the necessity of American action against the
terrorists and Libya.  While probably not the most decisive
choice of these options, it does allow America a viable
alternative of avoiding public and congressional displeasure,
while appearing to cooperate with the international
community in the pursuit of the perpetrators.
<P>
<HR>


The last (seventh) option is an extension of both the
policies that were undertaken against Iraq and those
previously used against Libya. It involves the use of U.S.
Navy planes to bomb the country of Libya into submission.
The U.S. Mediterranean Fleet is already in place and could be
activated to begin bombing within hours of a Presidential
order.  This option could be an attractive one, in that it
has been used before against Qadhaffi and minimizes the
threat to American forces. The use of F-117A "Stealth
fighter/bombers", B-2A bombers, and other carrier based
high technology aircraft could strike a decisive blow against
Libya, with few American casualties.
<P>


The viability of this idea would be dependent on the
mindset of Libyan leader Qadhaffi. If he chose to resist the
bombing and attempted to retaliate against the United States
or her allies in the region, the conflict would undoubtedly
escalate.  On the other hand, if he chose to turn over the
suspects without hostilities, he could avert potential
disaster for his country. In either case, the United States
would have demonstrated that "Terrorism" in any form is
unacceptable and that countries that support it are subject
to retaliation.
<P>
<HR>
<BR>
<H5>CONCLUSION</H5>
<P>

Reality probably will dictate that a combination of these
options will ultimately be used.  Indecisiveness, by the
United States, will not seem be an acceptable response to
the indictment of the Libyan terrorists.  In fact, this
situation would appear to offer an opportunity for
President Bush to show the strength of American conviction
against international terrorism, and to reaffirm this
country's participation in the President's vision of a "New
World Order".  Only by positively demonstrating that the
world is run by a system of socially acceptable laws and
behaviors, can the future threat of terrorism be eliminated.

<H2>MANHATTAN HAZ-MAT INCIDENT
</H2>
<P>
By James J. Fay
<P>

NYPD First Precient Detectives and FDNY Fire Marshal's initiated an
investigation into how 800 pounds of highly explosive, highly toxic, 
material were delivered to the doorstep of a lower Manhattan retail 
establishment.
<P>

On Sunday, November 26, at about 1515 EST, an initial response of
NYPD Emergency Service Units from ESU #1, and FDNY's First Battalion, 
responded to 365 Canal Street, at West Broadway, within the boundaries 
of NYC's Soho District.  The establishment, "American Liquadators," is a 
common type of retail store of the area, dealing in large quantities of  
electrical parts, army surplus, and other items, piled on shelves and in 
bins throughout the store.  The store personnel reported to arriving units 
that the four 33 gallon drums were delivered three days prior on Thursday, 
November 23, and left inside near the front door of the store.  They also 
told police that they did not order the product from any vendor, but were 
not initially concerned, because of the high volume of deliveries to the 
store.
<P>

Emergency personnel established from external markings on the drums that
the containers had what was best described as "aluminum powder." With that
information, NYC*EMS transmitted a '10-48' haz-mat incident code, 
establishing a command post and the response of numerous BLS and Special 
Operations Division Units.  Additional NYPD Emergency Service Units 
responded, as well as the Police Bomb Squad, and the FDNY Haz-Mat Company.
<P>

The normally grid-locked traffic in the area was made worse by the emergency
equipment, necessitating response patterns being transmitted from the scene 
to incoming units.
<P>

The FD established their command post in its Haz-Mat unit, researching the
source of the product back to its manufacturer via cell phone. The 
manufacturer acknowledged it was his product, but had no information or 
knowledge of a delivery to that store.  Haz-Mat also determined that this 
aluminum powder was highly toxic to the skin and reacted with an explosion 
when it came in contact with water or other chemicals.  All non-emergency 
personnel were instructed to remain 150 feet from the product.
<P>

A NYC Department of Environmental Protection chemist arrived on the scene
and requested that samples be taken from each drum.  During this procedure, 
FDNY Haz-Mat firefighters needed to change their half-hour SCBA bottles at 
least once while opening the tight drums and taking the samples.
<P>

A Fire Department unit equipped with "over-pack" drums responded to remove 
the material to a private vendor for proper disposal.
<P>

Approximately four hours after the first response, the scene was secured.
Police and Marshals would continue the investigation to find out if it was 
a simple mistake that put the dangerous cargo there, or a malicious act.

<H2>CIA AND FBI DIRECTORS DESCRIBE RUSSIAN ORGANIZED CRIME...</H2>
By Steve Macko
<P>

On Tuesday, the directors of the United States Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) met with House International Relations
Committee on Capital Hill.  CIA Director John Deutch said
that organized crime represents a growing threat to democracy
in Russia and has spread to 50 countries around the world,
including the United States.
<P>

Director Deutch said, "Organized crime and corruption pose an
increasing threat to political and economic reform in Russia.
Russia's criminal groups reach across international borders,
including our own.  Russian criminal groups have the potential
to support terrorism and contribute to the proliferation of
materials, technology and weapons of mass destruction."
<P>

This is the first time that Director Deutch has testified before
a Congressional Committee on the subject of Russian organized
crime.  Deutch tried to be optimistic on the issue by saying,
"The facts do not support the important judgement that this
criminal issue in Russia has gotten to such an extent that they
are going to be unable to proceed with their ... slow but
hopeful moves towards a more democratic society."
<P>

Even though he said that Russian organized crime groups have
the potential to contribute to the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction, Deutch stressed, "We have no data indicating
that a nuclear weapon or a significant quantity of fissile
material has ever been stolen from Russia.  We also have no
information that Russian criminal organizations are cooperating
with terrorist groups or rogue states."
<P>

The reason that criminal groups have flourished is because the
groups got their start in widespread government corruption even
before the Soviet era ended.  Deutch said, "The rapid collapse
of the Soviet system and central planning offered opportunities
for this underlying corruption to bloom, for criminals to reap
much higher profits and for crime to become much more visible
to the average citizen."
<P>

Overall, both directors, Deutch and Freeh of the FBI, gave
what could be considered a gloomy assessment of the crime 
problem in Russia.  FBI Director Louis Freeh said that when
freedom was established in Russia, it helped spread the existing
criminal network to expand abroad.  Freeh said, "Evidence that
organized crime activity from these areas is expanding and will
continue to expand to the United States is well-documented."
<P>

The FBI director said that he was not going to make the same
mistake that legendary FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover made by
ignoring the Mafia for 50 years.  Freeh said, "We are not
about to make the same mistake with Eurasian crime."
<P>

Freeh told the Congressional Committee that Russian crime
groups are operating in New York City.  The FBI is investigating
several cases that involve everything from murder to a massive
fraud scheme aimed at trying to steal $2 billion in fuel tax
revenues.
<P>

The main point where it seemed to Deutch and Freeh differed was
on their assessments of the anti-crime efforts by the Russians.
Deutch said about the Russian law enforcement authorities, "Law
enforcement agencies continue to be understaffed, under-funded
and plagued by corruption."
<P>

FBI Director Freeh said that in its dealings with the Russians,
the FBI has found that its Russian counterpart, the NVD, has
proven to be a reliable partner in investigating cases and in
making arrests.
<P>

Currently, the FBI has two Special Agents stationed in Moscow.
They are handling about 300 cases and have requested a third
agent to be assigned there.
<P>

Also speaking before the Committee on Tuesday was California
Attorney General Dan Lungren, who spoke about the growth of
Russian organized crime in his state and was the focus of an
ENN report on 19 March 1996.

<B>**LEAD STORY**</B>
<P>
<H2>STREET GANG FRANCHISES...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Managing Editor
<P>

In a recent study by criminologists at the University of Southern
California (USC), it was found that Chicago is second only to
Los Angeles as the leader in gang member exportation.  The number
one street gang in Chicago that exports gangbangers is The Gangster
Disciples.  With an estimated 30,000 members in Chicago, The
Gangster Disciples have taken a definite aggressive approach to
branching out to other cities in the United States.
<P>

Professor George Knox is the director of the National Gang Crime
Research Center at Chicago State University.  Knox says that Gangster
Disciple street gang activity can now be found in as many as 35
different states.
<P>

In a report that was issued in late 1995, the National Gang Crime
Research Center found that nearly 25 percent of 107 law enforcement
agencies in the State of Georgia had contact with Gangster Disciples
in their communities.  The same kind of numbers could also be found
in the States of Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and Wisconsin.
<P>

The main thing that is driving this exportation of gangbangers is
drugs -- and the money that can be made from the sale of drugs.
Professor Knox said that gangs discover opportunities to make
much more money in a city and they move in.  He said, "They see
there's nothing happening, see dollar signs, set up a prototype,
and they're up and running.  It's sort of like a McDonald's
operation, a franchise."
<P>

In August of 1993, police in Springfield, Missouri, uncovered a
large Gangster Disciple "franchise" in their community.  They
arrested an 18-year-old suspect from the southern Chicago suburb
of Harvey.  The suspect was arrogant enough to tell officers all
about the drug operation that he had been running.  One narcotics
investigator said, "He told me he was from a suburb of Chicago
and he had come to Springfield and had been selling crack cocaine.
He admitted that he was a member of the Gangster Disciples street
gang, that the gun he was carrying was to protect his money and
his investment."
<P>

Further investigation by the police in Springfield, Missouri,
came up with indictments against 32 people.  All who also
claimed to be Gangster Disciple members.  The drug operation
generated as much as $50,000 a month in profits.
<P>

What brought the street gang members to Springfield?  Well,
for one thing -- they found that they could sell the same rock of
crack cocaine that was selling for $10 to $25 dollars in
Chicago for $50 in Springfield.
<P>

Another Springfield narcotics investigator said, "They could sell
an ounce of crack in Chicago for $1,000.  Down here, they could
get $8,000 for that same ounce."

<TITLE>Montana FREEMEN and FBI Seige</TITLE>

<B>Jordan, Montana...</B>
<P>
<H2>Montana "Freemen" Hold FBI At Bay for 4th Day</H2>
A standoff is going into its fourth day in Jordan, Montana.  Federal
agents continue to try to persuade members of the militant anti-
government group called the Freemen.  The group, consisting of
at least a dozen men, women and children, are barricaded on a 
960-acre farm.  More than 100 federal agents, armed with rifles, 
watch every backroad and have set up a perimeter around the farm.
<P>

Federal agents say they are determined not to have a replay of the deadly
encounters in Waco, Texas, and Ruby Ridge, Idaho.  Both of those
past incidents resulted in the deaths of anti-government militants
and have brought nothing but criticism about the way federal authorities
handled the situations.
<P>

On Monday, two leaders of the group, identified as 57-year-old
LeRoy Schweitzer and 53-year-old Daniel Peterson, Jr., were arrested
on charges of threatening public officials, conspiracy and bank,
financial and mail fraud.  Ten other people, believed to be on
the farm, were also charged in the scheme.
<P>

While the situation at the farm in Jordan was said to be quiet --
a court arraingnment in Billings, Montana, for Schweitzer and 
Peterson was anything but quiet.  Both defendants disrupted the
court proceedings.  As soon as Schweitzer and Peterson were brought
into the courtroom, they began shouting and protesting their objections.
They said that the court had no jurisdiction over them.
<P>

Peterson yelled, "I don't have to listen to the court."  Schweitzer
shouted, "I object to any arraignment.  This court lacks jurisdiction.
You're without power to go on."  Both arguments are, of course,
ludicrous.  But because both defendants were so disruptive, the
arraingnment was postponed to a later date.
<P>

The militant group "Freemen" say that they reject all authority of
the federal and state governments.  The group says that they are
only bound by parts of the United States and Montana constitutions,
common law, the bible, the Magna Carta and, believe it or not,
the Uniform Commercial Code.
<P>

Law enforcement sources close to the Montana incident tell ENN that they are also 
hearing "rumblings" about other extremist organizations going to "alert status" and
that militia members in several other states haven't been reporting to work, and
have even taken their children out of school.  Some reportedly fear that the FBI 
action is Montana is a precursor to wide-scale raids on conservative and milita groups 
in other locations. Increased militia activities have been noted in Arizona, Texas, Idaho, and
Montana.

<H2>Bad Heroin Reported in Philly </H2>
By Clark Staten, ERRI Analyst
<P>

Chicago, IL., February 21, 1996, (ENN) A batch of "bad heroin" has 
been reported in Philadelphia that may have killed as many as five 
(5) people in the past 24 hours. Four deaths in Philadelphia and one 
in Chester County are all being linked the drug. Three of the deaths were within blocks of
each other in the Kensington and Juniata Pk. areas of Philly. 
Another victim was found, needle still in his arm in N.
Philadelphia.  The fifth victim died in E. Cain Township, but
was believed to have purchased his drugs in the Germantown area
of Philly.  At least one report said that the deadly heroin was
supposedly mixed with "cocaine".
<P>

PPD says that they are unsure if these deaths are connected
to a rash of more than twenty (20) overdoses that occured in
Philadelphia on Monday of this week. Those overdoses were being
attributed to "Polo" or "Death Shot" , which was first reported
when it caused more than 100 overdoses in the NYC/New Jersey

Emergency Medical authorities are urging extreme caution regarding this
drug and say that it may have been exported to any number of
other areas.

<P>
Chicago, IL, May 22, 1995 - The magnitude and atrocity of the poison gas attack in Tokyo is just starting to become realized by emergency response officials, throughout the world.  Many have been living in a state of professional denial about the possibility of such an attack. Most have voiced an opinion, in a variety of ways, that "it can't happen here"...or "it won't happen at all".  Many were awakened by a startling realization, yesterday, that it has happened, and could happen again.  The "chemical genie" was out of the bottle.
<P>
A flurry of official faxes and telephone calls have begun to ask; "What would we do if it happened here?...How do you treat nerve gas poisoning?...What can be done to neutralize it?...How can it be prevented?...Do we have a plan for this". Unfortunately, the answers are not heartening.  All to many officials are willing to admit that they do not have a plan, nor the necessary resources, to effectively manage a major poisoning incident like that which occurred in Tokyo.
<P> 
In fairness, there are a number of U.S. Fire/Police/Paramedic chiefs who are aware of the implications of a terrorist attack or a major accident involving chemical or biological weapons.  But, most candidly acknowledge that, during current government downsizing, they don't have the budgetary assets to train personnel or buy equipment that would be necessary to effectively prepare for the threat. Most say that they would hope to be minimally prepared and look to the state or federal government to provide additional means that might be needed. Emergency preparedness experts, however, say that the arrival of supplies and personnel from other agencies might be so delayed as to prove ineffectual to assist those poisoned.
<P>  
Therein comes the problem, the necessity of planning for obtaining potentially large quantities of antidotes and decontamination agents, without actually purchasing them and storing them for possible use. Some emergency administrators have answered this problem by making prior arrangements to obtain bulk stores of specific antidote agents from local distributors on a 24 hour a day basis.  Others plan to obtain drugs from one or more local hospitals.  Some have stockpiled at least some drugs on their Hazardous Materials response vehicle. Many others, unfortunately, still haven't addressed the issue at all.
<P>
Aside from having the necessary specific antidotes to deal with a chemical or biological emergency, emergency planners, Fire Chiefs, and EMS administrators have expressed their concerns about the necessary training and information required to effectively manage this type of emergency event.
<P>  
At least one Asst. Fire Chief, from a large metropolitan area, told ENN that he wouldn't have the slightest idea of where to obtain diagnosis and treatment information regarding agents like Sarin or other chemical warfare agents.  He said that during the on-set of the disaster in Tokyo that he attempted to look-up Sarin in his USDOT Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Guide, without success. He also said that his local medical control hospital didn't have any information on this topic, but that they felt they could eventually access it, if that were to prove necessary.  It wasn't until the Chief was informed that Sarin was similar in chemical make-up to some organophosphate insecticides that he was able access some information that could prove useful.
<P>  
Another Chief from a large Northeastern city said that normal continuing medical education requirements for EMTs and Paramedics made it difficult, if not impossible, for him to implement any sort of training program regarding "esoteric" types of topics like chemical weapons or terrorism.  He candidly told this author that, even though his jurisdiction was near several large population centers, he didn't believe that the threat level was great enough for him to commit his limited training budget to subjects that he believed that his personnel would never need.
<P>
Still another emergency responder, from Pennsylvania, sent Internet mail to ENN and commented that the entire issue of terrorism is a "police problem" and that it has nothing to do with Emergency Medical Services (EMS).  Further, he said that EMS would never become involved in an incident involving "nerve gases" and that discussion thereof was a "fantasy being perpetrated by the 'right-wing'" to scare emergency responders and the general public. As you can easily see, there would appear to be some divergence of opinion within the emergency community, in regard to the need for planning, education, and preparedness for a chemical attack.
<P>
Private and government counter-terrorist(CT) experts, on the other hand, are very clear in their estimates of this threat. Several say that an attack like occurred in Tokyo could happen in the United States tomorrow.  They confirm that the technology and chemicals to concoct deadly nerve agents, or to hatch dangerous biological "bugs", are already in the hands of a number of terrorist and extremist organizations.  Further, at least one Chicago-based CT analyst says that he is surprised that it has taken this long for a major incident like the Tokyo Subway disaster to occur. Now that it has, he voices his fears that a "dangerous precedent has been set" and that it may happen again. He believes that it may have only been a fear of a U.S. military reprisal that has prevented the use of the chemical weapons prior to this time.  He concluded by saying that the Tokyo attack may be only a precursor to other chemical or biological assaults...elsewhere in the world.
<P> 
In light of these expert assessments, and this new and present danger, a number of emergency agencies have reported that they will now begin a planning and education process.  Others still say that they will continue to deny that a threat exists and hope that it will "never happen here".  Hopefully, we all live in a place where they believe in preparedness for this horrible possibility.

<H2>WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING PART OF LARGER TERROR CAMPAIGN</H2>
By Clark Staten
<P>
 Chicago, IL (ENN) - An analysis of recent world-wide patterns of terrorist activity would indicate that the World Trade Center bombing was part of a much larger "terror campaign", being carried out by several groups of Islamic Fundamentalists, from several countries.  Increasing evidence demonstrates that the terrorism threats of the past several months are being carried out by a diverse group of "individual cells" that are being "loosely" controlled from the Middle-East.
<P>
 As is frequently the problem with "state supported terrorism", this is a battle of surrogates...tiny groups of fanatical Muslim supporters who carry out individual acts of violence in hopes of establishing a world-wide practice of Islamic law and beliefs.  This widely spread out association of "compartmentalized cells" make investigation and retaliation against an specific government a most difficult task.  Worse, it makes it practically impossible for any government to prove that any other government is the sponsor or financial backer of violent acts carried out as the policy of the country of origin.
<P>
 Terrorism is a "beast of many faces", depending on the country and individual objectives of the fragmented "cells" of supporters, who have chosen violence as a method of political and geographic change.  In the case of the Islamic Fundamentalists, the primary focus would appear to be the establishment of religious governing mechanisms to replace the current secular governments.  Particularly in Egypt, Turkey, Algeria, and Israel, the goals of Islam would appear to include a violent overthrow of the currently constituted political systems, to be replaced by the Islamic system of "religious laws and justice".
<P>
 An analysis of terrorist events during the past three months has shown a dramatically increased number of incidents directed against America and her European allies.  More frightening is the fact that several of these actions have actually been targeted at the mainland of the United States. Notable is the January 25, 1993 killings that took place outside of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Langley, VA.  In that attack, a Pakistani national named Mir Aimal Kansi allegedly used an AK-47 assault rifle to kill two CIA employees and wounded three others. Increasing intelligence information says that Kansi has ties to a fundamentalist group in his homeland, and that he is being "shielded" by them in Afghanistan, after fleeing there shortly after the shooting.
<P>
 On Feb. 26, 1993, multiple terrorist attacks took place at the same time. In Cairo, Egypt, Adel Abu Bakr was arrested for a devastating attack in the Wadi El Nil coffee shop in downtown Cairo. Two people were killed, and another eighteen people, most European and American tourists, were wounded. Reportedly, the attack was carried out with a TNT device that was wrapped with tape and imbedded with nails.  Local Cairo reports say that the cafe bombing was only one of several bombings of tourist sites, and buses containing foreign nationals, that have taken place in recent weeks. Egyptian investigators have reportedly determined that the perpetrators in the bombing were members of the Jihad Underground movement in Egypt.
<P>
 On the same day, the World Trade Center (WTC) bombing took place in New York.  As many as 1,050 people have been reported as injured as the result of the incident, with five dead and two people still presumed missing.  All technical appearances would suggest that the explosive device (or devices) were intended to damage vital building systems or even to cause a major collapse of the structure.  The WTC bombing has been called by many the largest and most damaging attack ever on American soil. Much has been written about the arrest of Ahmad Salameh in the attack, a Jordanian national of Palestinian origin, and his possible ties to an Islamic Mullah Sheikh Abdul-Rahman.  Although, probably a "small fish" in the bombing attack, Salameh's involvement would lead informed observer to be suspicious of Islamic participation.
<P>
 Also, on February 28, 1993 (the same weekend as the WTC bombing) a bomb exploded at the Zamboanga Airport on Mindanao Island in the Philippines.   The blast, which was "delay-detonated" at a checkout counter of the airport, injured twenty-two (22) people.  The Philippines News Agency PNA reported that the blast was so powerful that it destroyed a total of six (6) baggage check counters and completely destroyed the offices of the "Swift" private airlines. Although the local police chief said that he had no specific leads to the identity of the bombers, but said that he believed that the bombing had been the work of a "Moslem separatist group" that has been committing bombings and machine-gun attacks against local police and security forces.
<P>
 At least three Algerian incidents are noteworthy in an examination of the larger problem of terrorism.  In the country of Algeria, official reports indicate that since February of 1992, as many as six-hundred (600) people have been killed in violence perpetrated by Islamic Fundamentalists. In a country where Moslems have attempted to overthrow the recognized government.
<P>
 On February 26, 1993,(the same day as the WTC bombing), Security Services in Algiers report that a massive "home-made bomb" was exploded in the town of Chlef.  Reportedly, this blast did not cause any injuries or deaths, but it did destroy a major phone switching center and wrecked thousands of phone lines.  Significant is the fact that it took place at almost the same time as the WTC bombing in New York.
<P>
 On February 13, 1993, (two weeks before the WTC bombing) an assassination attempt was made on the life of Algerian Defense Minister Khaled Nezzar. Nezzar has been instrumental in the fight against the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front or FIS party in Algeria.  The official Algerian news service (APS) said that the assassination attempt was carried out by means of a car bombing that was "remote-detonated" as the minister's car drove past it.
<P>
 The third Algerian incident involved the killing of four (4) policemen that occurred on the same day and at about the same time as the bombing assassination attempt on Algerian Defense Minister Khaled Nezzar (Feb. 13, 1993).  According to police sources, gunman opened fire with automatic weapons on a car containing District Police Chief Khaldi Said, Police Inspector Mohamed Khelifi, and two other detectives. All four men were killed in the exchange of gunfire. According to the Rueters News service, the killings took place in a suburb of Algiers called El Harrach, which is known to be a Moslem Fundamentalist stronghold. More than two-hundred and fifty police (250) and paramilitary security forces have been killed in clashes with Islamic Fundamentalists during the past year.
<P>
 Several counter-terrorist analysts also point to a continuing escalation of pro-Islamic rhetoric emulating from the MiddleEast and calling for "hostile action" against America and her allies.  Some hypothesize that the calls for violence are the result of America's support for Israel and against recognized Islamic "liberation organizations".  During the past two months, radio reports, newspaper articles, and even faxes emanating from Aman, Jordan, Algiers, Algeria, Paris, France, and Pakistan have called for the "violent overthrow" of any country that supports the "Zionists" or opposes the Hamas, Hezbollah, FIS, Al-Jihad, PLO, or other Islamic or Palestinian organization.  The level of this hyperbole has been steadily increasing since the expulsion of four-hundred suspected Fundamentalist terrorists from Israel earlier this year.
<P>
 Numerous reports of additional incidents have been reported since the WTC bombing, and even though U.S. FBI Director William Sessions has been publicly quoted as saying that the New York incident is not a precursor to a "coming wave of terrorism", several competent counter-terrorist analysts say that the danger of future attacks is heightened. Although most experts agree that it is difficult for Islamic or other terrorist organizations to operate in the United States, they also point to the World Trade Center bombing as an example of what could occur in any major city in this country.
<P>                                                            -30-

<H3>Detroit Officer Killed by Alleged Drug User</H3>
By Steve Macko, Managing Editor
<P>
(ENN) In a shootout on Detroit's east side, a Detroit Police officer and
a suspect were both killed on Tuesday.  The 32-year-old officer,
identified as Patrick Prohm, was reportedly shot in the head by a
20-year-old male who may had been high on crack cocaine.
<P>

The car that the suspect was driving was stopped for a routine
traffic violation at East Vernor and Joseph Campau at about   
0100 EST.  A check of the automobile indicated that the auto, a 
Cadillac, was a stolen vehicle.  After being stopped, it was 
reported that the driver of the car got out of the vehicle and 
started dancing "with unusual gyrations."  It is believed that 
this individual was high on crack cocaine.  The suspect then 
pulled out a gun and started shooting.  Officers returned fire.
<P>

At that time, at the scene, it was not known that anyone, other than
the officer that was killed, had been hit by bullets.  The shooter
and two other men who were in the stolen car were brought to Detroit's
1st Precinct to be booked.  It was at the station when the suspect
began complaining of pain and collapsed.  A Detroit Police spokesperson
said, "No one knew anyone else was shot at the scene."  The suspect was 
transported to Detroit Receiving Hospital and later died from his wounds.

<font size=4><strong>Train vrs. Gasoline Tanker Prompts Major Response</strong></font><br>
<br>
JENNINGS, LOUISIANA (ENN) - A six-block area was evacuated and more than 150 firefighters 
spent more than 90 minutes to contain fires that were ignited when a freight train collided with a gasoline 
tanker truck on Friday. The collision set off explosions and fires at a nearby fuel distribution plant and a 
welding company. It was reported that flames shot 150 feet into the air.<br>
<br>
Eleven people were injured in the incident, including four firefighters who were treated for heat 
exhaustion. Only one of the victims was admitted into a hospital. That person suffered first- and 
second-degree burns.<br>
<br>
The driver of the truck told police that the crossing arm came down over the railroad tracks when he 
was only part way across. The driver jumped out of the truck just before the freight train struck the 
tanker truck and ruptured the tank. The fire caused by the collision extended to the nearby Exxon plant 
and ignited several 55-gallon tanks and destroyed several outbuildings at the plant. The fire also 
extended to a welding company where acetylene and oxygen tanks were stored. The welding company 
was also destroyed by fire.<br>
<br>
Firefighters were successful in the keeping the fire from extending to three large tanks that contained 
more than 50,000 gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel. They were also able to keep flames away from 
other freight cars that contained hazardous materials. A hazardous materials situation was called for 
because authorities were concerned that gasoline may have leaked into the city sewer system. Jennings 
is a town of about 12,000 people that is located about 35 miles east of Lake Charles in the 
southwestern part of the state.<br>

Friday. A series of explosions from the plant forced authorities to evacuate several city blocks just south 
of the downtown area.<br>
<br>
The blaze started in a tanker truck and quickly extended to the plant that makes industrial lubricants and 
cleaners. The roof of the plant's main building did reportedly collapse. No toxic materials were released 
into the air.<br></p>

Preliminary reports are coming into ENN from sources in Washington and Miami that a plane is in-bound to Miami 
International with a possible &quot;hijack&quot; underway. Reportedly a Iberia airlines plane, scheduled from Madrid, Spain to 
Havana, Cuba has been taken over by a single person who claims to have a bomb. Details are sketchy at this time. 
More as it becomes available.<br></p>

Although the situation is reportedly described by the Captain of the plane as &quot;under control&quot;, a major response of 
Metro-Dade Fire/Police/EMS departments is underway to a reported hijacking at Miami International. The hijacked 
in-bound flight, described as Flight 6621 by an Iberia airlines officials, is a DC-10, with 217 passengers on-board. I 
Miami SWAT officers are said to be establishing a security area where the plane will be guided to upon its arrival.

<br>
At this time, passengers are now being lead off the plane to a debriefing area by police and SWAT officials. 
Reportedly, the hijacker has surrendered to authorities without incident. According to Paul Phillip of the Miami FBI 
office, the hijacker was described as a 28 year old Lebanese national, who spoke both Arabic and Spanish. 
Confirmation has been received from the FBI that the alleged device was a &quot;hoax device&quot;, and could not have 
exploded. The hijacker is in custody and being interrogated. His motivation is unknown at this time.<br>
<br>
Allegedly, the hijacker had gone to a flight attendant while over the Atlantic and announced that he had a bomb, and 
that he would detonate it if he wasn't taken to the United States. Miami-Metro-Dade bomb squad officers are said 
to be searching the plane at the time of this report.<br>

<font size=5><strong>ARIZONA MILITIA GROUP ARRESTED BY FEDERAL 
AUTHORITIES</strong></font>.<br>
<br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
PHOENIX (ENN) - Federal law enforcement authorities arrested thirteen members of what could be 
described as a very dangerous anti-government group calling itself the &quot;Viper Militia&quot; on Monday 
afternoon. The suspects are charged with plotting for more than two years to bomb government 
buildings. Members of the militia group are said to have held training exercises in the Arizona desert in 
which they detonated ammonium nitrate bombs.<br>
<br>
In Washington, at a news conference, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno said that the group plotted to 
use explosives to destroy buildings that house: the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service (INS), the U.S. Secret Service (USSS), the Phoenix Police Department and 
the Arizona National Guard. Arrest and search warrants were carried out against the twelve suspects on 
Monday. An ATF bomb squad had to remove explosive material at one home in the Phoenix suburb of 
Peoria.<br>
<br>
In a videotape made by the militia group in May of 1994, a member talks about security measures, 
communications equipment and other features of targeted buildings. In Phoenix, U.S. Attorney Janet 
Napolitano said, &quot;The voiceover on the videotape gives advice on how to actually collapse the 
buildings.&quot; The narrator on the videotape suggests that &quot;anti-personnel devices&quot; could be placed in 
mailboxes near the entrance of a building that houses several federal agencies and said that by destroying 
a water main near the building could hamper firefighting efforts. The tape also showed the exterior of the 
building where the IRS is located and describes the schedules of security guards and other security 
measures.<br>
<br>
In describing an attack on the Phoenix Police Department, the narrator on the tape said that it would be 
difficult to take over the building, but that &quot;it would be a major political statement if it were taken over.&quot; 
The records and equipment inside of the building, according to the narrator, &quot;would be invaluable.&quot;<br>
<br>
Much of the information that lead to the indictments of this dangerous group came from an undercover 
Arizona State Police officer who infiltrated the group.<br>
<br>
A next door neighbor to two of the militia members who were arrested in Peoria described the men as 
&quot;definitely pro-gun people.&quot; The neighbor said that the people who associated with the suspects had 
expressed anger at the government's handling of the standoffs near Waco, Texas, and Ruby Ridge, 
Idaho. The neighbor said, &quot;I think they're like the rest of us, they get frustrated about legislation that 
restricts gun use.&quot;<br>
<br>
On Monday, it was announced that twelve militia members had been arrested in the conspiracy plot. On 
Tuesday morning, John Magaw, the director of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said 
that thirteen people have been arrested in connection with the case. The 13th person was arrested late 
on Monday night. Magaw warned, &quot;Terrorism has come to the United States. Do not forget for one 
minute the Oklahoma City bombing.&quot;</p>

<H2>FIRE DEPARTMENT PRIVTIZATION: PUBLIC SAFETY VS. PUBLIC FINANCES?...</H2>
By Jim Fay  ENN NYC-NJ Metro Correspondent
<P>

In what appears to be the first attempt at privatization of a
fire department in the northeast, the Village of Rye Brook,
New York, will discontinue contracting with an adjacent
town and have a private corporation provide it with
fire protection.
<P>

In a story published by "The Reporter Dispatch," a Westchester
County-based Gannett newspaper,  Rye Brook has contracted with
Rural/Metro Corporation, located in Scottsdale, Arizona, to
setup and provide Rye Brook's fire protection for an initial three
year period.  Rye Brook is a small town just outside the
more-urban Port Chester, NY. Rye Brook is an affluent community,
where homes can cost upwards of $400,000, located about
twenty-five miles north of NYC, in Weschester County.
<P>

Port Chester provides for 12 paid firefighters, 300 volunteer
firefighters, and 10 pieces of fire apparatus for both towns.
The new privatized contract with Rural/Metro will provide for
nine paid firefighters, 25 paid reservists, and four pieces of
fire apparatus for just Rye Brook, alone. The contract will cost
Rye Brook $30,000 more than the contract with Port Chester.
However, Rye Brook town officials say that, since it is expected
that real estate values in Rye Brook will increase in the coming
years, it will still be cost-effective.
<P>

The privatization of the Rye Brook FD has sent shock waves
throughout New York State firehouses. Both paid and volunteer
firefighters have raised their voices in the press and at public
meetings. The firefighters have raised a "safety vs.finances"
argument, but it has apparently fallen on deaf ears.  The private
fire department will begin operations on February 1st.
<P>

Westchester County is known for its affluent towns, where
corporate executives from NYC-based companies live.  However,
many of the bigger and older towns within the county are made
up of middle-class workers, many of them civil servants, and
many of them firefighters from the paid departments of Yonkers,
Mt. Vernon, and from NYC. The privatization of a public service,
such as the fire department, may cause political consequences.
But the public officials quoted in "The Reporter Dispatch" story
disagree, saying it was the fiscally responsible thing to do.
<P>

There is some concern that the adjacent towns that respond to
Rye Brook for "mutual aid" may hold a grudge against Rye Brook,
since some of these towns have union workers as volunteers, and
some others have paid drivers in their volunteer departments.
Fire department watchers in the New York area think not, but this
remains to be seen.
<P>

While the Rye Brook privatization is the first fire department to
be converted, other government operations in the NY-NJ area have
been handed over to private corporations. In New Jersey, the
United States Immigration and Naturalization Service contracted
the operation of a detention facility to a private company.
The company hired under-qualified and under-trained persons
as "detention officers" to work in the jail facility, where
illegal immigrants were held prior to deportation. 
<P>

Last year, an uprising by the detainees caused a tremendous amount of
damage to the facility. It was reported at that time that the
detainees rioted against the private detention officers due to
their abusive behavior against the immigrants.  The supervisors
waited before calling professional law enforcement to suppress
the riot, believing that the employees could handle it. But by
that time, the damage to the facility and injuries to the
contract officers and detainees was extensive.
<P>

In another previous privatization try, a town in Morris County,
NJ, contracted with a private security firm to have uniformed,
armed, security guards to patrol its streets. They took no
police action, except what was lawful for a private citizen to
do. The security guards called the New Jersey State Police,
that patrolled nearby towns and highways, to conduct investigations
and to effect arrests.  This privatization of police work was
struck down by a New Jersey State Superior Court, and the
security company's contract was cancelled.
<P>

Elected officials throughout the United States have come out in
favor of the privatization concept, but it has generally been
limited to clerical and non-public safety operations.  It is
expected that the Rye Brook situation will be watched carefully
by New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut officials, union leaders,
and public safety employees.

<center><H2>"EMERGENCY ACTION DRILL"  FOR EMERGENCY RESPONDERS</H2></center>
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="/PIPEBOM.GIF" ></center>
<P>
<center><H3>IN THE EVENT OF:</H3></center>

<center><B>I. Unexplained gunfire in your vicinity
<P>

II. Nearby Explosions
<P>

III. Visual sightings of unknown persons with weapons</B>
</center>
<P>
<P>
<center><H3>The emergency responder's priorities should include:</H3></center>
<P>

A. Seek Cover and ascertain the nature of the threat!  If
possible, move immediately to safety.  If openly exposed to the
hazard,   drop to the prone position and cover your head and
eyes with your arms.   Crawl (not run) to protective cover at
the earliest opportunity.<B> DO NOT</B> leave the emergency vehicle
unless it is necessary and the scene appears secure.
<P>

B. Radio for immediate assistance from police/military
authorities.  Give a safe nearby location as a staging area for
them to respond too. Advise responding units of the perceived
nature of the threat. If you are under direct attack...advise
(by radio) exact location and situation. Unless your agency has
pre planned a procedure for "violence circumstances", don't
worry about radio "codes" or other media affairs issues...the
threat far exceeds the need for radio security at this juncture.
<P>

C. Survey the immediate area for victims of the violence. Make
visual and   physical observations as permitted by the tactical
circumstances. Begin to establish a "forward" triage area and
C(3) center (Command, Control, and Communications).  All
rescuers should remain in this secured area until a primary
perimeter has been achieved by local police/military units.
<P>

D. Even early command decisions must be made collectively by the
highest ranking member of each agency at the scene. It is
strongly suggested that communications links be formed at the
earliest opportunity. It can be  anticipated that
police/security forces will assume a "lead role" until  such
time as the scene can be ascertained as  being safe for rescue
and other functions.  Consider immediate evacuation of all
civilians to a secure "debriefing area" at the earliest
opportunity.
<P>

<B>E. BE CONSTANTLY AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SECONDARY
EXPLOSIONS, ONGOING "FIRE FIGHTS", OR A RAPIDLY DETERIORATING
TACTICAL SITUATION.</B>
<P>

F. Evacuate injured patients to an area of safety as rapidly as
the tactical situation permits.<B> DO NOT</B> attempt to treat people
in an unsecured area, unless no other option is available. 
Particular attention must be paid to the security of the
perimeter in which medical personnel can be expected to work.
<P> 

If rescue is to be performed "under fire", combat medical
personnel must be afforded the protection of ballistic helmets  
and vests while operating in a hostile environment. Remain in an
unsecured area ONLY as long as necessary to perform the
extrication of people at risk. Coordinate your rescue with
police/security personnel, so that they may provide "covering
fire as necessary".  <B> REMEMBER</B>...dead or injured rescuers never
<B>HELP</B> anyone...they only compound an already bad situation!
<P>


G. As circumstances dictate, begin a Containment/Hostage
Negotiation/Treatment phase of the operation.  This can<B> ONLY</B> be
accomplished after ensuring both an inner and outer perimeter
that is secure. <B> REMEMBER</B>...the "bad guys" may not be "thrilled"
with you performing an effective rescue after they have gone to
all of the trouble of perpetrating a major crime.  Several past
instances have shown that secondary explosions or attacks have
been carried out to disrupt rescue efforts and kill rescuers.
<P>

H. Institute a "full-blown" Mass Casualty Incident/Incident
Command System  (MCI/ICS) as soon as circumstances necessitate
and permit.<B> CONTINUE TO CONSTANTLY MONITOR THE TACTICAL
SITUATION AND BE PREPARED TO MOVE TO ANOTHER   (ALREADY
DESIGNATED) AREA OF SAFETY.</B>
<P>

I. Terrorist incidents present a new and unique challenge to the
emergency response community. Responders must be adequately
trained and equipped to participate and manage such
operations. The current world situation requires both vigilance
and preparation.
<P>
<HR>

<B><I> SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS:</I></B>
<BR>

1. Unknown briefcases, packages, boxes, etc., left unattended in
areas of large public gatherings. (i.e. Airports, Train
Stations, Court Houses, Municipal/Federal buildings)
<P>
2. Seemingly abandoned cars, parked in an areas that are densely
inhabited, or in close proximity to other "high-risk" targets.
(i.e. Near any of  the above mentioned areas, shopping centers,
government installations)
<P>
3. Civic, Government, Religious, Ethnic, or other recognized
leaders, who may be the targets of assassination attempts.
<P>
4. Electrical Power plants, Natural Gas facilities, Nuclear
Plants, Chemical   factories, Telephone exchanges or Central
offices, or any other public utility that could cause disruption
of service or a danger to the public.
<P>
5. Emergency Response facilities; Fire/Police/EMS stations,
FBI/Secret Service/ATF/DEA/CIA or other federal law enforcement
offices or facilities.

<H3>STREET SURVIVAL IN THE 90'S</H3>
<BR>
By Clark Staten, EMT-P
<BR>
     Asst. Chief Paramedic (Retired)
<BR>
    Chicago Fire Dept.
<BR>
<P>
 The Oklahoma City bombing has awakened new fears in many
people, including emergency responders. Most of the people
killed in the Murrah Federal building disaster were civil
servants, several belonged to the military or law enforcement
agencies.  One thing is certain, members of the
Fire/Police/EMS/Disaster community are at greater risk than ever
before. In the opinion of those that have studied such issues,
the current situation "on the street" should warrant a greater
understanding of these burgeoning problems. In order to better
comprehend these often complex circumstances, let's explore the
nature of the threat and some of the things that can be done to
better provide for rescuer and patient safety.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR> 
<H5>KNOWN DANGERS</H5>
<BR>
<H6>Street Gangs</H6>
One of those hazards that has commonly already been identified
is the problem associated with street gangs.  In almost any
community in the United States, there are groups of people who
have banded together for purposes of, fraternization, self
protection, in lieu of crumbling family structures, and most
frequently in pursuit of criminal enterprises.  Street gangs can
be found in big cities, suburbia, and lately in rural America.
<P> 

In fact, a recent trend has found organized gangs purposely
branching out into smaller towns, where they are unknown and
think they can sell guns and drugs without detection. Emergency
responders from suburban or rural areas, who think they are
immune from the problems of "big city" gangs, are only kidding
themselves.  Everyday, reports of gang arrests and violent
incidents are being received from parts of the country where
they were previously unheard of.  To suggest that gang crimes
and dangers are limited to urban America is a folly that few
emergency responders can afford.
<P>

One of the latest and more ominous developments in gang crime is
the use of firebombs or "molotov cocktails" in inter-gang
disputes.  The EmergencyNet NEWS Service (ENN)  has documented
the use of firebombs in at least ten (10) major U.S, cities
during the past year.  Molotov Cocktails have been used as both
weapons of revenge and intimidation by gang members.  A limited
use of conventional and military explosives (hand grenades),  by
gang members, has also been seen in the later part of the 90's. 
One recent case in Chicago involved the attempted purchase of a
LAW rocket, to be used by a streetgang to attack a local police
district.
<P>

 Well documented links have been drawn between street gangs,
guns,  and drug dealing, with many gang activities being
financed by the money derived from the sales of crack, cocaine,
and a recent resurgence in heroin sales.
<P> 
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H6>Drug Deals</H6>
Although downplayed by some law enforcement experts, the concept
of narco-terrorism is alive and well in Central/South America
and may well have been imported to the United States.  Some
people, in places like Miami, New York City, Los Angeles, and
other ports of entry, say that many acts of violence are
directly tied to drug sales and purchases.  Hundreds of people
are killed each year in drug deals gone bad.  Fueled by
deception, seemingly unlimited funds, automatic weapons, and
murderous greed, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars
worth of drugs change hands everyday, within the continental
United States.
<P>  

  A recent tactic used by drug dealers involves the
"booby-trapping" of drug stashes, "shooting galleries",  and
drug houses. Rescuers should be aware of several documented
cases of hand grenades, chemicals, and hungry/abused dogs being
used to guard drug producing and distributing sites.
<P>

Often drug transactions are not easily concluded and end in a
barrage of gunfire or a bombing.  It then becomes the a number
of emergency agencies to resolve the conflict and "pick-up the
pieces". The dangers involved in the completion of this mission
far exceeds any of those of the past.  (See Specific
Precautions-Drug Laboratories)
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H5>DOMESTIC TERRORISM</H5>
<BR>
<H6>Neo-Nazi/White Supremacist Groups</H6>
<BR>
In recent years, numerous Neo-Nazi/White Supremacist
organizations have been identified both in the United States and
in Europe. (See illustration/appendix #1).      The ideology of
these groups is deeply rooted in the teachings of Adolph Hitler
and his Third Reich  of World War II.  Anti-Semitism, hatred of
immigrants and people of color, trappings of militarism, and
white separatist ideas are all associated with the Neo-Nazi
movement.   In the United States, the Klan and skinhead groups
have often aligned themselves with Neo-Nazis and formed
alliances, with skinheads being used as "shock troops" in
demonstrations, rallys, and confrontations with police or
opposing groups.
<P>   

As public concerns regarding immigration and other economic
issues continue to be debated,  Neo-Nazis can be expected to
continue to grow in both popularity, numbers, and their
visibility.  If any lessons can be learned from Neo-Nazi groups
in Europe, it is likely that an increasing number of violent
demonstrations and acts of sabotage and violence will be
committed by Neo-Nazis and their allies, within the United
States.  Allegations have also recently surfaced in regard to
links between various Neo-Nazi groups and Militias in some
states.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H6> Militia/Paramilitary Groups</H6>
Interest in the "paramilitary right" has grown since allegations
have been made that the Oklahoma City bombing involved Timothy
McVeigh and his ties to  Michigan and/or Arizona  "Militia"
organizations.  Law enforcement intelligence officials say that
their general concerns about the militia movement vary from "not
at all" in some states, to "fearful"  in others.  Most police
sources admit they that were previously aware of paramilitary
groups and exercises in a number of states, but did not foresee
the level of violence that was perpetrated in Oklahoma City.  
Most law enforcement officials say, however,  that what they
fear most, at the present time, is an over-reaction by militias
to investigations being conducted in regard to the Oklahoma City
disaster.
<P>

In the short term, experts say that the likelihood of another
major bombing operation is probably negligible, but that they do
fear the future actions of another "small fringe group" who may
undertake "guerrilla tactics" to attempt to make a statement or
to demonstrate their displeasure with government actions. 
According to another theory,  an armed confrontation and hostage
taking could occur,  should law enforcement officers
unexpectedly attempt to enter or search certain militia
compounds or question militia leaders.
<P> 
Most lawmen agree that large numbers of trained and dedicated
people with modern weaponry and tactics could pose a serious
risk to society in general,  should they decide to confront or
attempt to overthrow the current system of government, but, a
general consensus is that a major armed attack by any  militia
group is extremely unlikely in the near future.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H5>International Terrorism</H5>
<BR>

The menace of international terrorism directed against the
United States hasn't diminished in recent years.  The
ramifications of the World Trade Center bombing are just being
understood, as the trial of Sheik Abdul Rahman and his
compatriots proceeds in New York City.   The idea that a Moslem
Extremist "Campaign of Terror" was allegedly being undertaken on
American soil is both frightening and sobering, as the chronicle
of potential terrorist tactics is recited daily in open court. 
Relationships between  terror perpetrators from Iran,  Iraq, 
Syria,  Lebanon, Somalia and the World Trade Center disaster
have been drawn by New York prosecutors.  Strangely enough,
those same countries are on the U.S. State Department "Watch
List" as countries that support and sponsor terrorist acts.
<P>

The risk of another terrorist attack from Moslem extremists
remains at a high level. Most experts agree that America's
support for the PLO/Israeli peace accord, and recent decisions
to attempt to prohibit trade with Iran may heighten an already
tenuous situation with regard to our relationship with Iran.  
The rhetoric of "jihad" or "holy war" continues to emulate from
Tehran,  Damascus, and Beirut.  Within the month, major
demonstrations have taken place near the American Embassy in
Tehran, with large groups of students wearing  "funeral garb", 
said to be in preparation of giving their lives to the cause of
the Ayatollah or Allah.   One can little doubt their sincerity
or their ability to strike almost anywhere, if they are properly
motivated and blessed by the Mullahs to carry out a gruesome and
devastating task.
<P> 

Military training for the "holy warriors" reportedly continues
in Somalia, the Sudan, in the Bekka Valley of Lebanon, and
within the borders of Iran.  Millions of dollars worth of arms
and explosives have allegedly been purchased by Moslem
extremists, on the open markets of the Middle East, within the
past year.  The stage has been set for another round of terror
attacks.  Most experts say that it is just a matter of time
before the next atrocity occurs.
<P>    

Also frightening is a  June 17th, 1995 disclosure by Japanese
police that the  AUM Shinrikyo (Supreme Truth) "Dooms Day" cult
was planning to export poison gases to the United States and
extend their reign of terror to this country.  During
questioning, one of the leaders of the groups reportedly
admitted that there had been a plan to export Sarin gas to an
unidentified U.S. city, but that the plan was not carried out,
due to internal conflicts within the cult.  The series of
incidents in Japan has proven to many counter-terrorist (CT)
experts that the prospect of chemical and biological warfare has
increased greatly in the past six months.  Several say that they
fear that the next attack against the United States could
involve hazardous materials of an extremely deadly nature.
<P>

One thing is certain; the danger of an attack from abroad
continues.  The world today is not one of Superpower
engagements, but rather of "brushfire wars" and attacks by
insurgent movements.  It is likely that it will be a war waged
in the neighborhoods and on the streets,  a battle of "hit and
run" tactics, with no identifable nation to blame.  This will
require a new and different warfighting philosophy and different
kinds of training, intelligence, and preparedness on the part of
emergency responders and agencies.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>   
<H5>Intelligence Gathering </H5>
One of the most viable things that police and intelligence
agencies can do, to help to prevent unnecissary injuries or
deaths, is to gather intelligence about potential perils and
develop tactics and strategies to thwart the planned attacks.
<P> 

This has reportedly been successfully done by the Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI) at least twenty times,  in the past year.
 Although often not public knowledge, good intelligence about
planned terrorist events has allowed law enforcement agencies to
infiltrate radical cells and arrest those responsible, before
they have had an opportunity carry out the act.   Unfortunately,
with a few exceptions, most Fire and EMS agencies do not spend
time or energy in gathering or analysing information of this
kind.
<P>  

Most Fire/EMS administrators seem to think that local police
agencies will provide them with adequate warning and
preparations, should that become necessary.  Sadly, this
assumption may be badly mistaken.  Police administrators may not
routinely share information regarding possible dangers,  for a
number of reasons.  Foremost of these,  is the instinct that
Police Administrators are responsible for police officers, not
Firefighters or EMTs.   Secondarily, there may be police
concerns regarding security of the information, that it may be
shared with inappropriate people or released to the media.
<P>  

Lastly, many police officers may adhere to an ageless military
principle that Firefighters and EMTs don't have a "need to
know", and if they do, they will be told at the appropriate time
and place.  It should be pointed out that these omissions are
not malicious in intent, nor purposefully negligent in practice;
in most jurisdictions there is just no history of sharing of
tactical intelligence and information.  Many believe that needs
to change.
<P>

In light of these circumstances and the current tactical
situation "on the streets", it may become necessary in many
jurisdictions for a formal liaison to be established between 
Fire, Police, and EMS departments.  This relationship must be
supported at the highest levels of each department and utilized
on a "real-time" basis to share intelligence assessments that
may affect all of those responding to emergencies.  Short of
this formerly acknowledged system, it is highly recommended that
firefighters and EMTs invite their local patrol officers and
supervisors to lunch or dinner, on an on-going basis, and 
exchange the kinds of information that could prove beneficial to
both groups.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H5>Specific Precautions</H5>
 Rescuers must be aware that on at least two, contemporary, well
documented, occasions that a secondary explosion has been
command or remotely detonated after rescuers have arrived on the
scene of a bombing.  In one case in Israel, a fanatical "suicide
bomber" waited until ambulance and military person were on the
scene and then ran into a crowd of them and detonated a bomb
attached to his waist.  At least seven (7) of them were killed
or critically injured.  This tactic can be expected to continue
and even increase in the future.  One would be hard pressed to
think of a better way to intimidate the general population,  and
specifically rescuers,  than to have them constantly looking for
a second bomb.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H6>Drug Labs</H6>
<BR>
Drug raids on drug manufacturing laboratories have a way of
turning into Hazardous Material operations.  All too frequently,
volatile chemicals are present and noxious fumes are being
released.  Often that is the reason for the discovery of the
lab, in the first place.  Both law enforcement agents and drug
producers have reportedly been overcome by these fumes, as
neither routinely have self-contained breathing apparatus.
<P>  

To complicate matters, the "bad guys" usually aren't very
cooperative about surrendering and may shoot at Police, Fire or
EMS responders who have come to extricate them from the toxic
environment.  Scene safety and security are a must at this type
of incident and close cooperation may quickly be necessary
between those conducting the raid and those coming to perform
rescues.  It is strongly recommended that effective
cross-training be conducted prior to the inception of a planned
raid on a drug lab.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H6>Bullet Resistent Garments Yes or No? </H6>
The issue of providing bullet (proof) resistant garments for
Fire/EMS personnel continues to be debated.  In light of today's
escalating violence, the issuance of these light weight "bullet
stoppers"  has become a necessity in some rescue environments. 
For instance, to not issue vests to responding Fire/EMS units
during times of riots and civil unrest could border on criminal
behavior, or at the very least, be considered unethical and
foolhardy.  In the case of everyday responses, the same
principles could apply if a Fire or EMS unit routinely responds
to large numbers of shootings, stabbing, or other calls
associated with physical violence.
<P>

On the other hand,  some administrators will complain that the
cost to benefit ratio of bullet-proof vests is unreasonable and
that they can better spend their budgets to help citizens and
responders in other ways.   They point out (and maybe
realistically so) that there have not been a high number of EMTs
shot or stabbed in recent years, and that it can't happen in
their jurisdiction.  Or, at least, there are no good published
studies to document an increase,  if it is occurring.  Most with
these complaints come from rural or suburban emergency systems,
where there is not the marked violence that has engulfed many
urban neighborhoods.  But, lately, even the most skeptical must
admit that random acts of previously unthinkable violence are
now occurring,  on a more frequent basis, and in places where it
never happened before.  Just ask the people of Oklahoma City.
<P>  

Maybe the time has come for Fire/EMS administrators to carefully
consider the purchase of bullet-proof vests as being just as
essential as any other piece of personnel protective clothing. 
After all,  the equivalent of the hospital and funeral bills for
one paramedic or firefighter, shot in the chest, would probably
provide enough funding for  more than a hundred protective
vests.  And,  the morale and safety of those receiving them is
guaranteed to be higher.
<P>

<B><H5>Safety Recommendations</H5></B>
<P>

 Always maintain a 360 degree view of the scene. Don't develop
"tunnel vision"
<P>

You watch your partner's back and have them watch yours
<P>

Never enter into crowds to extricate a victim, unless sufficiant
security is available
<P>

Never stand in front of doors when knocking on them
<P>

Always carry at least two sources of artificial light
<P>

If you hear or see imminent danger...RUN AWAY...until the scene
is secure!
<P>

Communicate and cooperate with the police...you are in this
together!
<P>

Know and understand your system's policy on restraints...adhere
to it.
<P>

If you must defend yourself, use the maximum amount of force
neccessary
<P>

Keep accurate records of incidents involving violence; court
will follow.
<P>

To the best of your ability, preserve evidence of any
crime...tell the police.
<P>

Your failure to plan will undoutedly result in an emergency.
<P>

Always have a "WAY OUT"....

<H2>U.S GOVERNMENT WINS ROUND ONE IN GANG TRIAL...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

On Wednesday, United States Attorney Jim Burns said, "We view
this as a great first step.  But I can assure you that the battle
has just begun."  Burns said that after eight members of the
infamous Gangster Disciple street gang were convicted in a Chicago
federal court.
<P>

Prosecutors said that this was only the first step toward putting
the gang, that operates like corporation, out of business.  Despite
Wednesday's convictions and at least two trials to begin later this 
year, Chicago Police officials say that Chicago's largest street
gang still maintains its choke-hold on the illegal drug activity.
<P>

Donald Hilbring, the commander of the CPD Gang Crimes unit, said,
"If you indicted the head of IBM or Xerox, the corporation is still
functioning.  Nothing's crumbled."  Hilbring said that the gang
controls much of Chicago's South Side, its suburbs and and even
is involved in drug activity in several cities and towns in other
states. Wednesday's convictions were just the first test of the U.S. 
government's six-year investigation of the Gangster Disciples
code-named Operation Headache.
<P>

Eight defendants were convicted on Wednesday of drug conspiracy.
It is possible that the defendants will receive life sentences.
Four of the defendants were considered to be high-ranking "governors"
of the gang.  These governors that were convicted were Russell Ellis,
Keith McCain, Sherman Moore and Eric Wilson.  All were convicted of
conducting a criminal enterprise, which carries, in this case, a
mandatory life sentence.
<P>

One of the other defendants who was convicted was former Chicago
Police officer Sonia Irwin.  Irwin was even once a member of the
CPD Gang Crimes unit.  She was said to be romantically connected
to the number two man in the gang and had fronted what prosecutors
called, "Gang Central."  Irwin jointly owned a restaurant that was
used to conduct much of the gang's street business.
<P>

The BIG test and what will be considered the Super Bowl of this
six-year investigation will come on October 5th when the reputed
leader of the Gangster Disciples, Larry Hoover, goes on trial.
Hoover, who has been in prison for almost 25 years on a murder
conviction, was among 39 people who were indicted last summer.
<P>

After the convictions on Wednesday, the foreman of the jury that
found the defendants guilty told what helped the jury come to its
decision.  Larry Hoover and his co-horts were secretly tape
recorded during visits to the minimum security Vienna Correctional
Center.  The jury foreman said that the ability of Hoover to
control Chicago's largest street gang even though he has been in
prison since 1973 "boggled the mind."  According to unnamed sources, the government, in this first trial,
did not even use all of the evidence that it has at its disposal.
Additional evidence is planned to be revealed against Hoover in
subsequent trials.
<P>

During this last trial, the secret tape recordings of Hoover and
his gangbanger buddies gave a look behind the mindset of these
type of criminal individuals.  Hoover's number one assistant,
Gregory "Shorty G" Shell, was even surprised at Hoover's ability
to maintain not just control -- but STRONG control of the street
gang from prison.  In a conversation that was recorded in 1993,
Shell said to Hoover, "I'm a-tell you something, man, that the
biggest part amazes a lotta people about you that been gone for
20, 21 years and you ..."  "... Still in touch," Hoover finished.
Shell replied, "Still in touch like you ain't been nowhere."
<P>

Some of the conversations can be called disturbing.  Hoover and
Shell talked about how to corrupt youths and how to entice them
into the gang.  Their main sales pitch to kids was the material
rewards that drug-dealing brings to them. Shell said to Hoover, "I might give this guy a 9 or give this
regent 4 1/2.  So they, they can have ... nice clothes, nice shoes,
they pay their bills."  Shell was referring to common street terms
used for one-eighth and one-quarter of a kilogram of narcotics.
<P>

Hoover responded to Shell, "That way you bring them along with you,
that's the thang, you bring them along.  They look up, they gots
something.  They got now more than they ever had in life.  They
know this.  They know they wouldn't have anything without you."
What Hoover was in effect saying is that the appeal of being in the
gang, and what the government feels is insidious, is that -- 
Together, we can have riches.  Alone, you are nothing.
<P>

In another conversation Hoover became angry about finding out that
one of his "regents" had been beaten for not answering a page from
his superior.  Hoover, however, was not upset because the person
had been beaten, but gang protocol was not followed.  Hoover said
that the regent should have been "talked to first, then fined,
then his ass."
<P>

Authorities and prosecutors talked to many 11- and 12-year-olds
about why they joined the Gangster Disciples.  Most said it was
because of peer pressure. Prosecutor Ronald Safer asked several of these gangbangers the
following question: "Why do you follow Hoover?"  Safer said,
incredously, he received the same kind of reply -- a blank stare.
Safer said that was because they had never thought about the
question before.
<P>

And really who can blame these kids? Living a life of poverty, in substandard housing, with little education, and few prospects for the future, what choices do they have?   Faced with a choice of working at a fast-food restaurant for five dollars an hour or making $100
a night acting as a lookout for a drug dealer -- is it really
surprising which route many of the kids take?

<H2>CALI DRUG CARTEL UNDER PRESSURE...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

In 1995 alone, in the New York City borough of Queens, 20 high-level
Colombian drug dealers were found murdered.  In one gruesome
incident in July, the body of one Colombian was found stuffed
inside of a suitcase along the side of a road in Queens.  The
victim had been bound and gagged with duct tape.  A cord had
been wrapped around his neck and a rotting onion was stuffed
inside of his mouth.
<P>

Authorities say that only recently the Cali drug cartel has
been able to overcome some internal stresses on their illegal
operation that was caused by several high-level arrests in 1995.
Only recently has the violence that has been targeted against
drug dealers leveled off.  What that shows is that a power shift
in New York's drug underworld has taken place.
<P>

It is an underworld of bloody turf wars, hitmen who are trigger-
happy, vicious people who won't even think twice about taking
out opposition.  But even though there was a major shakeup in
what is called the world's premier drug cartel -- the cocaine
and the heroin continued to flow into the United States unabated.
But one thing is for certain, the way that the Cali cartel operates
has been transformed.
<P>

The New York City Police Department (NYPD) has increased its
pressure on the drug dealers.  Large drug shipments have been
replaced by smaller ones.  Flashy displays of wealth by drug
dealers has been eliminated.  Stash houses have been moved.
New people have been hired.  Command centers for drug operations
have moved out of the city and into the suburbs of Long Island
and New Jersey.
<P>

The chief of narcotics investigations for the Borough of Queens
District Attorney's Office, Peter Crusco, said, "Paranoia on
their part has gone through the roof."  Crusco said that the
big-time drug dealers are now "working out of suitcases" to
avoid detection from authorities.
<P>

The pressure on the cartel is not only coming from inside of
the United States.  In Colombia, in 1995, six of the highest-
ranking members of the cartel were arrested.  When those arrests
happened, many thought that finally the Cali cartel had been
brought to its knees.
<P>

Last August, after the arrest of one of the key drug-traffickers
in Colombia, Lee Brown, the former director of the Office of
National Drug Control Policy, said, "The cartel is crumbling."
But the situation on the streets in New York City told a different
story.
<P>

While many law enforcement officials say that the Cali drug cartel's
operation may have been disrupted for a short period of time -- the
price and supply of drugs has now begun to once again stabilize.
And that's the best indicator of what is happening.
<P>

Late last year, the wholesale price of a kilogram of cocaine in
New York City was $25,000.  It has now dropped to the current
going price of $21,000 a kilo (2.2 pounds).  The United States
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) says that is a sign that
supplies have been stabilized.
<P>

The Agent-In-Charge of the DEA's New York office said that he is
not surprised that the Cali cartel has been able to rebound.  He
said that because of the immense size of the cartel they are able
to "undercut anyone."
<P>

In another illustration of the power of the Colombian cartel, the
Mexicans have been trying to corner the heroin trade in New York
City for decades -- but they've never been able to quite do it.
The Colombians were able to dominate the New York heroin market
almost overnight.  Four years ago, the Colombians only had a 15
percent market share of the New York heroin market.  Today, they
account for 80 percent.
<P>

Carlo Boccia, the head of the New York City DEA office, said this
about the Cali cartel, "There's not an organization anywhere that
can compete with them."  But even though it sounds like things are going well for the
Colombians -- they have been feeling the pressure from law
enforcement.
<P>

Because of increased police action against them in their
traditional strongholds in New York City -- they've had to
move out onto Long Island, the suburbs of New Jersey and
even to the States of Connecticut and Pennsylvania.
It's even more difficult to spot a drug dealer.  Gone are
the flashy, expensive, luxury cars and the gold chains.
Drug dealers are now trying to keep a low profile.
<P>

Another sign that law enforcement is hurting them is the
effort to cut the risk of losing multi-million dollar
losses of drugs seized.  Drug shipments have apparently 
been reduced in size.  What used to be sent in one shipment
is now sent in twenty. Regardless of all of this seemingly good news -- the war on
drugs is still far, far from being won.

<H3>BUILDING COLLAPSE RESCUE</H3>
<BR>
                  By Clark Staten, EMT-P I/C
<P>
<BR>
Numerous recent disasters, in several parts of the world,
should alert us to the fact that people are going to be
trapped under buildings and other structures in the
foreseeable future.  The very nature of our technologically
sophisticated and "growing taller" society continually
increases the likelihood that this sort of calamity will
occur.  Current construction trends and population increases
seem to continually expand the risks as people move further
up from the ground.  With the advent of the "High-Rise"
buildings comes the very real concern of a "building
collapse".
<P>
Each year the buildings seem to get taller and taller and
"Mother Nature" or her creations seem to take their toll of
more and more of them.  Earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados,
and other weather phenomenon have shown a far greater
capacity for destruction, than society has for building
structures that will withstand the weather or earth
disruptions.  Both weather and ground patterns have the
potential for mass destruction of both structures and the
people that they contain.  Manmade destructive forces also
play a major role in the cause of building collapses.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H5>CASE HISTORIES OF RECENT EVENTS</H5>
<BR>
Israel (January, 1991)
<BR>
Events in the Middle East, that took place during the Persian
Gulf Conflict, should also remind us that man's inhumanity to
man can also cause building collapses to occur.  With the
exception of certain specially "hardened" structures, most
buildings can not withstand any kind of bombardment or
missile impact.  The television scenes from Israel were most
frightening as they illustrated the military and civilian
rescue forces attempting to rescue people from buildings that
had been hit by Saddam Hussein's "SCUD" missiles. The
likelihood of continued military conflict in that region
should bring additional pause for concern.
<P>
Turkey (February, 1992)
<BR>
Avalanches, caused by record snowfalls in the Western Asia,
also took their toll during the past year.  One such
occurance took the lives of more than one hundred (100)
"Gendarmes" who were sent to the area of Southern Turkey to
protect the Kurds, who were fleeing Iraqi devastation.
Reportedly, a total of as many as four hundred (400) people
lost their lives when "massive walls of snow" engulfed
several villages.
<P>
Rescue efforts were reported to have been hampered by
additional snowfall, poor roads, and a lack of the proper
equipment (cranes, endloaders) to perform the rescue.  Yet,
people where found alive in collapsed buildings after more
than 48 hours, even though outside temperatures stayed well
below freezing during the rescue.
<P>
Turkey (March, 1992)
<BR>
Twin earthquakes have also struck Turkey in recent months,
possibly killing as many 4,000 people.  They followed the
devastating avalanches by about one month.  Rescue efforts
were again described by eyewitnesses as "erratic and
disheartening".  Correspondants from the Associated Press
(AP) and United Press International (UPI), and Rueters News
service, described the scene as "disorganized".
<P>
A T.V. news reporter was said to have walked into the rubble
of a major Turkish city, during a live telecast, and shouted
to trapped victims.  Reportedly, a victim answered him and
was eventually rescued by bystanders.  A nurse, who was
buried under what once was the region's only medical school
and hospital, was extricated after eight (8) days by
persistent rescuers and family members...even though
"official" rescue efforts had been terminated several days
before.
<P>
Israel  (March, 1992)
<BR>
In Jerusalem, Israel, mudslides, caused by some of the same
unusual weather that caused "blizzards" and "floods" in the
Middle East, slithered through an ancient graveyard and
collapsed a popular cafe' and coffee house.  The building, in
an area immediately adjacent to Jerusalem's "Old City",
crumbled like a "house of cards".  More than twenty (20)
people were immediately killed by the collapse and several
dozen others were pulled from the wreckage alive.
<P>
Live and delayed pictures from the Cable News Network (CNN)
showed Israeli and Palestinian rescue workers working "below
grade" to attempt to extricate the trapped people.
Unfortunately, they also showed that the exposed sides of the
collapse had not been "shored" to prevent a further collapse.
Several rescuers were reportedly injuried when a section
collapsed further and dragged them into the buidling
basement.
<P>
Argentina (March, 1992)
<BR>
Later in March, the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires,
Argentina was destroyed by a car bomb, suspected of being
detonated by a supporter of the "Islamic Jihad" and/or
"Hezbollah".  The blast destroyed the embassy, a chuch and
school across the street and damaged several other building.
More than 110 people were reportedly in the structure at the
time of detonation.  Many people were rescued almost
immediately by hundreds of bystanders and Buenos Aires police
and fire department members.  More than twenty-seven (27)
died as the result of the explosion and being buried in the
building collapse. Complaints were published, quoting
rescuers, that efforts were hampered by a lack of "heavy
equipment" to help to remove the vast amounts of debris that
entrapped the victims.
<P>
<BR>

(Author's Note)
These reports are offered as constructive criticism, and not
meant to diminsh the courage, determination, or "almost
superhuman" efforts on the part of the rescuers that
participated in every one of the incidents mentioned. These
observations are presented, however, for the purpose of
learning about the dangers, problems, tactics, strategies,
and equipment that is needed to effectively perform this kind
of rescue. This information is also presented to demonstrate
the inevitability of additional building collapses in the
coming months and years.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H5>NATURE OF THE PROBLEM</H5>
<BR>
Building collapse rescue is an often complex and confusing
situation.  It will frequently involve large numbers of
specialized rescue personnel and equipment that might not be
generally be recognized as being part of a normal rescue
organization. It should also require a combination of a
variety of technical rescue skills and an advanced knowledge
of building structures and materials.
<P>
When a building collapses, it generally does so in one of two
ways. The building can be thought of as having "exploded" or
"imploded".  The primary difference between the two types of
collapse is the direction of force as it applies to the
materials contained in the structure. It will also assist in
a determination of the density of the debris that is involved
in the rubble.
<P>
With implosion, the building will collapse into itself. It is
a technique that is used by demolition specialists to
minimize the spread of debris when purposely demolishing
buildings.  This type of collapse is likely to be caused
when interior weight bearing structures lose their integrity
and subsequently "pull" exterior walls into the center of the
mass.  The density, and generally the depth, of debris is
greater when a building is said to have imploded.
<P>
In the case of explosion, either caused by an outward rush of
force caused by natural, mechanical, or chemical forces, the
building will collapse in an "outward" direction.  It is
likely that the debris will be more wide spread in the
vicinity of the collapse, and that it could be of lesser
density and depth. A tornado or hurricane can "scatter"
building parts for several hundred feet or even farther, when
it causes a building(s) to collapse. It is possible that
victims could be "buried" under debris a greater distance
from the center of mass.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H5>HORIZONTAL VERSUS VERTICAL RESCUE</H5>
<BR>
Most rescue experts agree that building collapse extrication
must be a process of vertical removal, rather than horizontal
movement or reduction. The safest way to remove debris from
someone that is buried should involve carefully lifting the
debris from above the victim and continually "shoring" the
sides of the entrance hole or excavation to ensure against
additional collapse. This is a method that is consistent with
common practices used for "trench rescue".
<P>
In the case of building collapses, the magnitude of the
shoring efforts and the type of equipment necessary to
perform the rescue may be very different from normal
extrication. In order to facilitate vertical removal of
debris, it may be essential to quickly locate and utilize
various types of "cranes" and other types of "overhead lift"
capabilities.  It is strongly suggested that every rescue
system have previous knowledge of and training for the use of
heavy construction equipment.  Emergency dispatchers should
have access to a list of construction companies and other
businesses that could provide this type of equipment on a 24
hour a day-seven day a week basis.
<P>
The importance of careful overhead lifting of debris, rather
than vertical movement, can not be emphasized enough. As many
as one third of all building collapse victims, that are
rescued, are found in spaces created by the way that building
materials generally fall. Most of the collapse configurations
that occur (lean-to, A-Frame, tent, pancake) create "voids"
in which people may be trapped and remain alive.  Vertical
movement of debris will normally further collapse the sides
of these "protective spaces" and can result in additional
deaths of those that might have been rescued.
<P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H5>GENERAL BUILDING COLLAPSE GUIDELINES</H5>
<UL>
<LI>(1) As one might expect, immediately after a collapse, the
    debris of the building is very unstable and prone to
    additional movement.  Rescuers must assess the nature of
    the scene and the pattern of the collapse before entering
    onto a a pile of rubble to insure their own safety and
    that of those potentially buried in it.  Shoring may be
    necessary to prevent movement, before attempting rescues.
<P>
<LI>(2) Gather as much information as is possible at the onset of
    the incident.  "Intelligence" regarding the last known
    locations and activities of those believed to be in the
    structure will greatly assist in developing a plan for
    recovery efforts. Concentrate your preliminary efforts on
    areas where people were last seen or known to be.  It is
    suggested that a "Command" person be designated to
    interview those that may have escaped the collapse, were
    eyewitnesses, or were in the building and rescued early
    in the effort. Obtain a list of the people normally in
    the building, if one is available.
<P>
<LI>(3) After ensuring rescuer safety and minimal movement of the
    debris, send small organized teams to the top of the pile
    and systematically search the surface in specific grids.
    Use barricade tape and markers to visually demonstrate
    the areas that have been searched and those that could
    potentially contain victims.   As many as one half (1/2)
    of all building collapse survivors have historically been
    rescued near the surface of the debris and early in the
    effort.  Concentrate your efforts on those areas that are
    believed to be the last known locations of people, when
    the collapse occured.
<P>
<LI>(4)  CALL for Help!!  It normally will be necessary to
     activate some sort of disaster plan for large scale
     building collapses.  This type of rescue is very
     manpower intensive and may require large numbers of
     extrication and medical personnel.  Call for the
     "overhead lift" capability that you will need, as soon
     as it can be determined that people are missing or still
     trapped. Remember... it is likely you will need some
     method of "cutting" concrete and the steel reinforcing
     bars ("Rebar") that are contained within most modern
     buildings. (i.e. torches, hydraulic cutting tools,
     saws).
<P>
<LI>(5)  Explore visually, or with mechanical devices (closed
     circuit/fiber optic T.V.), all possible "voids" that are
     open or can be reached by removing surface debris.  It
     is suggested that, at approximately every hour on the
     hour, all work at the site be shut down for a few
     minutes to listen for calls for help.  During that
     period, sound detection devices can be used to "listen"
     for movement or sounds deep within the debris. Call for
     "Search Dogs" and handlers, as they are available in
     your area or region. (Have the equipment and dogs on a
     dispatcher's resource list with the heavy equipment
     contractors/operators)
<P>
<LI>(6)  Continue to remove debris... carefully and vertically,
     searching each "void" or entrance to a "void" as it
     becomes available to the rescuer.  Consideration must be
     given to the fact that the rescue effort is NOT over
     until EVERY reasonable effort has been expended. Expect
     these type of rescues to last days...especially when
     multiple buildings are involved (earthquake, avalanche,
     etc).  People have CONTINUALLY and HISTORICALLY been
     found alive many hours and days into the rescue. Have
     command, media relations, and logistics officers plan
     for a multiple day operation when people are still
     suspected of being missing and their bodies have not
     been recovered.
<P>
<LI>(7)  Great care must be taken when a person is located,
     either dead or alive, to ensure that additional collapse
     doesn't occur in the area of their entrapment.  Rescuers
     should use their hands and small tools to remove the
     remaining debris surrounding a person.  The victims
     condition may dictate the speed with which rescue
     efforts progress.  Consideration should be given to
     early application of Military Anti-Shock Trousers for
     viable persons that have "crushing" injuires.
<P>
     Preparation and the beginning of application of them
     should take place as soon as the entrapment permits.
     Several instances of complete hemodynamic collapse and
     death have been noted upon release from confinement.
     Intravenous solutions can also be administered by
     qualified EMS personnel as extrication continues.
     Caution should be urged in the use of morphine or other
     painkillers.
<P>
<LI>(8)  DO be prepared for the emotional and psychological
     implications of the incident.  Prepare early for
     Critical Incident Stress debriefing sessions for
     rescuers, victims and families. It is strongly suggested
     that mental health professionals and crisis intervention
     be made available to the families of those believed
     trapped, at the earliest opportunity.  The stress of
     protracted digging, discovery of disfigured remains, odd
     smells and sights can affect even the most hardened of
     rescue professionals.
<P>
     Supervisory personnel may want to set aside a special
     place for families and psychological care near to, but,
     off of the rescue site. To do otherwise will invite
     charges of insensitively, and probably prompt the
     families to attempt to enter or stay in the rescue area.
<P>
<LI>(9)  Relief for both supervisory and field rescue personnel
     must be forthcoming. Even though most rescuers will
     insist in continuing their efforts for many hours, they
     lose a large part of their effectiveness after 18-24
     hours or less.  Ensure that all rescuers eat and rest at
     frequent intervals, as circumstances permit. Prepare to
     (and do) call in off-duty or mutual aid personnel as
     they are needed.  Stage all extraneous units in a
     planned way and avoid having more personnel on-site than
     can effectively work at one time.
<P>
<LI>(10) During long term or at major rescue operations, expect
     extreme "media" coverage, including the national and
     international press.  Be prepared for analysis and
     commentary of your every move.  It is suggested that
     this scrutiny can be somewhat averted by appointing a
     designated Public Information Officer (P.I.O.), and by
     planning and giving frequent press briefing and updates.
     Include "front-line" rescuers and technical experts that
     you may be being utilizing in the effort.
<P>
     During the early stages of the event, give these
     briefings hourly in an area adjacent to the site and
     provide as much information as you can actually verify.
     As the length of the rescue increases, plan a morning
     and afternoon news conference.  It is suggested that
     someone monitor press activities on a constant basis, in
     order to be able to anticipate the questions and
     concerns of the media.  Be as forthcoming as possible,
     without compromising the integrity of the rescue
     operation, the victims, or the families of the victims.
<P>
<LI>(11) Anticipate the need for additional resources that you
     haven't thought of prior to this event.  Be prepared to
     obtain architectural drawings of the building(s)
     affected.  How about gas mains, water pipes, or
     electrical services that are disrupted? You may want an
     aerial perspective of the scene...do you know where and
     how to get overhead photos of the collapse?  How are you
     going to feed "hundreds" of construction workers, rescue
     workers, families, and others, who may be there for
     days?
<P>
     Who's going to pay for what?  Will you need a
     city/county purchasing agent on-site to approve the
     immediate purchase of your needs? Ensure that you have
     planning and logistics officers who can anticipate these
     needs and fulfill them within a moments notice.
     Often... the difference between what is perceived as a
     completely successful rescue and a "disorganized" one is
     the quality of your planning and the careful execution
     of your contingency plans.
<P>
<LI>(12) Particularly in multi-story buildings, be prepared for
     the possibility and likelihood of underground or cave-
     type rescue procedures. This type of specialized rescues
     requires those experienced with climbing (ascending and
     descending) manuvers and the use of technical rappeling
     methods.  Each rescue team (minimum of two rescuers)
     going "underground" should have a safety rope attached
     and be in constant communications by radio with the
     surface.  They should also possess a minimum of three
     viable light sources.  Hose rollers and other types of
     "rope slip devices" must be used, as to avoid the sharp
     edges of concrete that will abrade normal rescue ropes.
<P>
<LI>(13) IT AIN"T OVER UNTIL IT'S OVER!  Generally speaking, you
     will be criticized for any early termination of rescue
     efforts, if there are still people missing or bodies not
     recovered.  A rule of thumb says it's over when every
     everyone is accounted for or the "field is cleared" (of
     debris).  Practical application says that you will
     probably scale back the aggressiveness and scope of the
     effort after several days of rescue, but that you should
     remain aware of the fact that people have been
     successfully rescued alive after as much as twelve (12)
     days... buried in the rubble of an earthquake.
<P>
     In the March, 1992 Turkish earthquake, a 22 year old
     nurse was pulled from beneath a building collapse after
     eight days.  She was also quoted as saying that she had
     been "talking with her two friends", who were also
     buried, for several days after the collapse...until she
     "didn't hear them anymore".  The thought of someone
     remaining buried alive for several days should be enough
     motivation for most rescuers to continue with their
     efforts until every possible hope has been exhausted.
<P>
<LI>(14) Establish on-scene (and separate) communications (Radio,
     Data, telephone) connections and expect problems with
     being able to coordinate with many differing agencies.
     It might be suggested that a "common" disaster frequency
     might be designated in preplanning sessions for the
     initial response to the incident.  Once on-scene, the
     Incident Command team may need to establish several
     different "nets" of units or agencies and have a common
     dispatch center at the command post.
<P>
     Anticipate the need to constantly communicate with
     construction workers (crane operators) and their
     supervisors, and probably a dozen other agencies that
     you never thought of.  Also remember that the need for
     coordination with local and state police may become
     necessary for crowd/access control and other purposes.
     Often police agencies will become involved in securing
     the remains of fatal victims in a temporary morgue at
     the scene.
<P>
<LI>(15) EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED!  Regardless of the thoroughness
     of your contingency planning efforts and the diligence
     of all of the people involved in the rescue, something
     will become a problem that no one has anticipated. This
     is just another opportunity to demonstrate the quality,
     committment, and dedication that comprises the makeup
     of most rescue organizations...let the improvisional
     ability of the firefighters, EMTs, paramedics, police
     officers shine through!
<P>
</UL>
<BR>
<HR>
<H5>CONCLUSIONS</H5>
<BR>
<P>
One of the most difficult, emotionally draining, and
technically complex types of rescue can be a building
collapse incident.  The keys to a successful rescue are pre-
planning, practice, and perseverance.  By learning more about
this increasing commonplace event, we can be better prepared
to save lives and alleviate the suffering of it's victims.

<p>Issued by former forces of the U.S.S.R., the Chinese Military, North Korea, and used by a large number of 
countries that have previously received weapons and training from the former Soviet/Communist Bloc, the 
RPG-7 proved to be a very simple and functional weapon that has an anti-vehicle/armor role as well as being 
effective against fixed emplacements. Its effective range is thought to be approx. 500 meters when used against 
a fixed target, and about 300 meters when fired at a moving target. It is reported that it can penetrate at about 
12 inches of conventional armor plate.</p>
<p>It has been used extensively by terrorist organizations in the Mid-East and Latin America and thought to be in 
the inventory of any number of insurgent operations. The RPG-7 is thought to still be available in illegal 
international arms markets, particularly in Eastern Europe and the Mid-East. It can be expected to be used by 
extremists of several kinds, when engaging in urban combat or vehicle ambushes.</p>

<H2>FIREFIGHTER GOES ON A SHOOTING RAMPAGE...</H2>
By Steve Macko
<P>

JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI (ENN) - Five people are dead and four others
are wounded after a disgruntled firefighter went on a shooting
rampage at the Jackson, Mississippi, central fire station on
Wednesday afternoon.  The gunman was identified as 32-year-old
Firefighter Kenneth Tornes, a 9-year veteran of the Jackson
Fire Department.
<P>

Tornes attacked all the fire department supervisors that he
could find at the central fire station.  He then led police
on a 10 mile chase that ended in a shootout in a suburban
Jackson shopping center parking lot.
<P>

Earlier in the day, Tornes reportedly shot and killed his
42-year-old wife at their home.  The wife was believed shot
point-blank in the forehead in the carport and Tornes dragged
her body back into the house, where police found it.
<P>

While police were at the scene of Tornes' home, investigating
the murder of his wife, Tornes went to the central fire station
to attack supervisors who had given firefighters a hard time over 
the years.  All of the dead and wounded victims at the fire station
held the rank of captain or higher.
<P>

Tornes started his rampage on the second floor of the station
located in downtown Jackson.  He searched for anyone wearing
a white shirt.  He confronted one woman worker in a hallway
and told her, "Lady, get back, I am going to blow this place
up."
<P>

He intentionally avoided and did not harm any firefighters who
wore a blue shirt.  Tornes told one firefighter to take his
arson dog and get out of the way.  Jackson Deputy Fire Marshal
J.L. Kelly said, "He picked his targets."
<P>

Shots were heard over the fire department's radio network.  Fire
Department Investigator Norman Presson said, "Apparently whoever
was on duty keyed up the mike when the gunman came in."  Presson
said that he heard someone pleading to Tornes not to shoot.
"Then I heard shots fired over the radio," Presson said.
<P>

Killed at the fire station were: Captain Stan Adams, age 45;
District Chief Dwight Craft, 48; Captain Merideth Moree, age 49;
District Chief Rick Robbins, 47.  Wounded were: District Chief
Jacob Bell, 48, who was reported to be in stable condition; and
Captain Ken Lewis, age 50, who was in critical condition.
<P>

After shooting up the central fire station, Tornes fled and
a police chase ensued.  Several accidents were caused by the
fleeing gunman, including one that involved an ambulance.
The chase ended in the parking lot of the North Park Mall,
located in suburban Ridgeland.  A shootout with police ensued
and Tornes was shot once in the left eye.  He is reported to
be in serious but stable condition at an area hospital.
<P>

Ridgeland Police Officer Elmo Gabbert, age 34, was shot in
the hip by Tornes and is said to be in stable condition.
When police searched Tornes' car they found a Mac-11, a
Tec-9 and a .45-caliber handgun.
<P>

What motivated Tornes to kill his wife is not known.  What is
known is that he had serious problems with fire department
superiors.  Jackson Firefighter Tim Dukes said about Tornes,
"He was a perfect gentleman except when you got him talking
about the chiefs.  He's been talking about this for years."
<P>

The president of the local firefighters union said that Tornes
was "a time bomb waiting to go off."  Another firefighter added,
"I'm surprised it took so long."
<P>

Other co-workers said that Tornes was very upset about the
long-running dispute between firefighters and superiors over
reprimands for what were considered to be trivial matters.
<P>

Listening to firefighters complaints, there does appear to be
a problem between Jackson Fire officers and the lower ranks.
The local union president said, "They put the pressure on
this man.  He is a victim, too.  When you brought up the
administration, he would just blow up."

<H2>IFOR Soldiers Raid Alleged "Terrorist Training School"; Iranians Seized</H2>

(ENN) NATO forces in central Bosnia on Friday captured what is described
as a terrorist training camp.  Eight Bosnians and three men suspected
to be Iranian nationals were taken into custody.  The NATO raid took
place on Thursday at about 2:00 p.m. (Bosnian time) at a former ski chalet located
about six miles south of Fojnica.  The camp contained classrooms and
an extensive armoury.  Found were explosives, handguns, sniper rifles,
rocket and grenade launchers, and assault rifles.
<P>

Some of the explosive devices found were built into small plastic
toys for children, including a toy car, an ice cream cone and a
helicopter. NATO officials said that they also found extensive instructional
materials on explosives and conducting ambushes and sabotage.  
Students were apparently being trained to attack both military and 
civilian targets, conduct covert bombings, and lay booby-traps.
<P>

United States Admiral Leighton Smith, the commander of the NATO
peace forces in Bosnia, was quoted as saying, "It doesn't take a genius to figure
out we found something here that is an abomination ... clearly
terrorist training activities.  No one can escape the obvious,
and that this is terrorist training activity going on in this
building and it has direct association with people in the government."
<P>

The Bosnian government said that the site was an intelligence
training facility that was in the process of being closed down.
Found the building was a photograph of the Bosnian president on
one wall in the foyer of the chalet.  A picture of former Iranian
leader Ayatollah Khomeni was found on a table in an upstairs
classroom.
<P>

An unidentified American officer said that the three alleged Iranians that
were captured were believed to be instructors and the six Bosnians were students.
Two others were captured, but their nationalities were not immediately identified. 
The officer said, "The Bosnians were employed by the ministry of
the interior of this state of Bosnia as intelligence operatives."
<P>

Much of the material found in the chalet was in the Iranian language
of Farsi.  NATO officials said that so much was found that it would
take weeks to go through it all.  Also found in the raid were
hollowed-out toys and pens that could be used for making drops of
secret messages.  Instructions on how to make these message exchanges
were also found.
<P>

According to the Dayton Peace Agreement, the Bosnians have every
right to have an intelligence service, however the presence of
foreign nationals, in this case -- Iranians, is a clear violation.  An
American officer said, "There is no complaint that an intelligence
school was run here, but methods of terrorism, sabotage, and kidnapping which
obviously violate international accords are of our great concern."

<TITLE>SARA/Right to Know Information</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H3>Three -- count 'em three -- different types of substances are subject to 
SARA:</H3>
<P>


1) Extremely Hazardous Substances;

2) Hazardous Chemicals; and

3) Toxic Chemicals.

We've talked about the "extremely hazardous substances."  We're now going to speak at length about "hazardous chemicals."  Keep in mind that ALL "extremely hazardous substances" are also "hazardous chemicals."  Even if you've reported your "extremely hazardous substances to the State Emergency Response Commission, you are still required to report them again as "hazardous chemicals."
<P>

SARA's reporting requirements for "hazardous chemicals" are what we 
typically associate with Right-To-Know information: who has how much of what 
hazardous chemicals, where they've got them, and what they can do to public 
health.
<P>
<HR>

In broad outline, SARA:
<P>

1) Defines what is a hazardous chemical;
<P>

2) Specifies which industries and businesses must report their hazardous 
chemicals;
<P>

3) Identifies the State and local groups to which reporting is to be made 
and provisions for public disclosure of information;
<P>

4) Provides for reporting information in three progressive stages with each 
stage requiring more information;
<P>

4) Sets deadlines for reporting;
<P>

5) Contains provisions for protecting the chemical identity of "trade 
secrets."
<P>

Lives will be saved or lost depending upon how successful a community is in 
reporting and managing this information.
<P>

<HR>
We'll need to discuss these in some depth.
<P>
So what's a "hazardous chemical"?
<P>

SARA says that they are the same "hazardous chemicals" that are subject to 
the OSHA hazard communication standard.
<P>

The OSHA hazard communication standard applies to "any chemical which is a 
physical or health hazard." THAT and a little common sense should see you 
through.
<P>

There's no list of hazardous chemicals.  Persons who import, manufacture or 
distribute chemicals which are physical or health hazards are required to 
provide appropriate warning labels and Material Safety Data Sheets when they 
sell the chemicals to third parties.
<P>

The receipt of an MSDS sheet with a shipment is usually a good indication 
that a chemical is hazardous.  Not always though.  Some companies send out 
MSDS sheets with substances (such as steel) listing toxic components 
(chromium).  Now the chromium in a steel sheet is unlikely to hurt anybody, 
but you may process it into a hazardous substance (like grind it into a fine 
powder).
<P>

Some chemical manufacturers send out MSDS sheets which say that a chemical 
is harmless.  That's done just so you don't think they've forgotten to 
notify you and to prevent unnecessary precautions.
<P>

Except for these limited circumstances, an MSDS sheet usually signals the 
existence of a physical or health hazard.
<P>
<HR>

OSHA considers a chemical to be a physical hazard if it's:
<P>

a) Flammable or combustible;
<P>

b) A compressed gas or explosive;
<P>

c) An oxidizer or organic peroxide;
<P>

d) Pyrophoric (capable of spontaneous ignition, e.g. white phosphorus); or,
<P>

e) Unstable or water reactive.
<P>

<HR>
"Health hazards" are identified as any chemical for which their is at least 
one valid scientific study which demonstrates either acute or chronic health 
effects in exposed employees.  Note that this includes chemicals which are 
hazardous only after long periods of exposure.  Carcinogens, mutagens, and 
chemicals which slowly attack target organs (kidneys, liver, etc.) are 
included.
<P>
<HR>

There are exceptions to the SARA (and OSHA) definition of hazardous 
chemicals:
<P>

a) Foods, colors, additives, drugs, and cosmetics regulated by the FDA;
<P>

b) Solids in manufactured items when chemical exposure is not likely to 
occur during normal use;
<P>

c) Substances which are present in the same form or concentration as a 
product packaged for use by the general public (e.g. the can of Drano you 
use on the company toilets);
<P>

d) Substances used in a research lab, hospital, or medical facility under 
the direct supervision of a qualified individual;
<P>

e) Substances being used in routine agricultural operations or fertilizers 
held by a retailer for sale to the ultimate customer.
<P>

The "hazardous chemicals" can be numbered in the tens of thousands.  For 
purposes of determining how many reports will be coming in, my state has 
been using an anticipated average of 200 "hazardous chemicals" per reporting 
entity.  Some corporations have told us that they have thousands on site.

<B>**LEAD STORY**</B>
<H2>SOCIAL COSTS OF CRIME FAR EXCEEDS COST OF INCARCERATION ...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

According to a study recently released by the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, locking up criminals in prison saves society money in the long run.  The study conducted by the San Francisco-based, privately funded, think tank indicated that justice officials in California do not incarcerate enough criminals and do not sentence criminals long enough, at the present time.
<P>

The study was written by Steven Hayward, who is the vice president of research of the institute and by Lance T. Izumi, a senior research fellow.  They said in the report, "Numerous studies show that the social costs of crime far exceed the cost of incarceration."
<P>

The report said that by locking up convicted criminals in prison crime is deterred simply by preventing them from committing additional offenses.  This collaborates the long-standing analysis that ERRI analysts have given as to what is the true reason for the recent decline in crime statistics mainly in the larger cities in the U.S. ERRI has long contended that crime has dropped because criminals are being sentenced for longer periods of time and while in prison, are unable to commit additional crimes.
<P>

This recent study estimated that for every dollar that is spent keeping a criminal in prison saves up to $2.80 in the cost of crimes the felons would commit if they were on the street.
<P>

The authors of the report wrote, "It suggests that 'three strikes' and similar measures that will impose longer prison sentences will yield substantial social cost-savings to California."
<P>

An example estimate of $5 billion in cost of implementing the 'three strike' law was given.  The study said that if it costs $5 billion to keep the criminals behind bars, then "Californians can look forward to savings of $10 billion to $14 billion a year, simply from incapacitating criminals."
<P>

There have been critics to California's new "three strikes" law. The law is designed to make sure that criminals who have been found guilty of two or more serious felonies receive long prison sentences.  Critics say that the law is only being used against offenders who commit minor crimes or those who have been convicted of drug abuse.  The critics say that the "three strike" law will flood the prison system with petty criminals.
<P>

The Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy disagrees with the assessment of the critics of the law.  The study showed that of the slightly more than 1,000 people who have received a sentence of 25 years or more during the first 20 months that the new law was put into effect, the vast majority of the offenders who were convicted were for committing the kinds of serious offenses for which the law was intended.
<P>

The study said, "Three strikes is netting exactly the kind of repeat offenders for which it was intended, despite criticisms that 'minor' offenders are being sentenced under the law."  One thing is clear, repeat offenders who are in jail can't commit additional crimes.

<center><H2>ERRI Announces 100,000th Access to Website</H2></center>
<center><IMG SRC="/ERRICITY.GIF"></center>
<P>

Chicago, IL, Febuary 15, 1996 --The Emergency Response &
Research Institute (ERRI) today announced that its emergency
service World Wide Web site has been accessed ("hit") 100,000
times in less than three months of operation. In noting this
phenomenal success, Clark Staten-ERRI Executive Director, said
that even he was surprised at the popularity of the computer
based news and reference service. 
<P> 

Staten said that more than 300 Fire/Police/EMS/Disaster/
Counter-Terrorism related-articles are now available on-line to
be viewed and read by emergency responders and other interested
individuals.  According to the retired former chief, many
articles address controversial or "cutting-edge" topics that can
be put to immediate use by members of the emergency response and
media commmunity.
<P>

In recent days, one article from the website has stirred
national interest in regard to the illegal use of a drug called
Rohyphnol (Roofies). "Roofies" have allegedly being used as a
"Date Rape Drug" and are being called the "Mickey Finn of the
90's" by reporters and police officers alike.  Within the past
few days, Mr. Staten has held exclusive interviews with
Chicago's Channel 2 (CBS), The Minnesota Tribune newspaper, and
a Fox-TV affiliate in Florida. Staten cites the "Roofies" story
as an example of one of the more beneficial uses of the World
Wide Web and says that this is an excellent way to rapidly
disseminate information to emergency responders and the public
at large. The former paramedic says that he believes that this
story may help to prevent future rapes and can assist law
enforcement officials in the prevention of drug abuse.
<P>   

Another component that is most accessed on the website is the
EmergencyNet(ENN)News page. This section of the site provides
24-hour a-day coverage of ongoing disasters and other major
emergency events. ENN correspondents in S. Africa, Israel,
Australia, Japan, and several locations in the United States,
provide both the facts and an expert analysis of incidents that
is vested in the fact that all our reporters/commentators are
also veteran emergency/military personnel. Many ENN reports are
based on "first person" observation or participation by the
reporters, themselves. 
<P>

The Emergency Response & Research Institute is a one of the few
"think tanks" in the world that conducts ongoing studies of
emergency service/military/counter-terrorism issues and provides
its reports to the public on a open website.  Through it's
reporting arm, the EmergencyNet News service, ERRI also provides
daily emergency incident reports (ENNFAX) and continuing
analysis of related topics to a number of government, corporate,
and individual clients via fax and the Internet.

<H2>MAN GOES ON SHOOTING RAMPAGE IN NORTHERN AUSTRALIA ...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

PALMERSTON, AUSTRALIA (ENN) - A man armed with a pump action shotgun went on a shooting rampage in northern Australia during the early hours on Saturday.  Four police officers, one civilian and the suspect were wounded.  Police constables were able to capture the suspect after a fierce gun battle in the town of Palmerston, which is located about 12 miles south of the city of Darwin.
<P>

The five hour incident began at about midnight when officers responded to a call of shots fired near a house in the town of Woodroffe.  Three police cars were sent to the call.  While officers were talking to the complaintant in the backyard of his home, the gunman, who was hiding in some brush, opened fired. Wounded were a 33-year-old female constable and the civilian complaintant.  Officers returned fire, but the attacker was able to flee. More than 30 police officers and members of the Territory Response Group converged onto the area and searched for hours, but the suspect was able to escape.
<P>

At about 5:00 a.m. the man turned up in central Palmerston at a police station.  There, he shot up several police vehicles and again fled. Police converged into the central business district of the town and began a search.  The gunman was able to ambush four Response Group officers as they got out of their car near a McDonald's restaurant. Two officers were shot and a fierce gun battle, that lasted several minutes, erupted.
<P>

Police reinforcements poured into the scene during the shootout. An ambulance was involved in an accident when it hit a car while trying to reverse from the scene of the gun battle.  A stun grenade was thrown at the suspect and he was shot in the right arm, after it went off.  Police finally took the gunman into custody.
<P>

A police spokesman said that all three police officers and the civilian, who were shot, are in stable condition.  The 33-year-old female officer was shot in the chest and buttocks.  A 31-year-old senior constable, who is part of the Territory Response Group, sustained gunshot wounds to the shoulder and elbow.  A 31-year-old Response Group sergeant was shot in the thigh.  The 31-year-old civilian complaintant suffered gunshot wounds to the chest and right shoulder.  He also had a punctured lung.  A fourth police officer was only slightly wounded.
<P>

The motive for the attacks is not known.  A police commander in Darwin said, "Clearly this was an extremely dangerous situation. It had the potential to escalate further."

<H2>"Homicide" Heroin Problems Spreads Through Northeast? </H2>
By Paul Anderson, ENN Metro Correspondent
<P>

PHILADELPHIA (ENN) - As reported in the Friday edition of this
publication, 116 drug addicts were treated as of Friday night
for becoming sick after taking a powerful heroin cocktail known
as "Homicide" and "Super Buick." This "cocktail" is said to be
made of a potent blend of heroin, cocaine, dextromethorphan,
thiamine and scopolamine.
<P>

On Thursday night, it was reported that Philadelphia Police and
ambulances rushed unconscious drug users from the streets, where
they had literally fallen, to area hospitals.  The hospitals
quickly became swamped with patients and one hospital had to
refuse all admissions for about four hours.
<P>

Hospital workers and doctors said that after each patient
regained consciousness, about four people had to restrain them
because they became violent.  The violent patients had to be
held down by straps, security guards, nurses, laundry workers
and even motor pool employees.
<P>

A security guard at Philadelphia's Episcopal Hospital said, "It
was like the front lines in 'Nam...like a MASH unit.  Yelling...
bodies coming in by the minute, cars zooming up, dropping
junkies and taking off."
<P>

Police said that as of Friday evening, the drug addicts were
still lining up to buy the drug.  A captain in the Philadelphia
Police narcotics unit said, "It's a double-edged sword.  You
want to warn people there's danger out there, but then some come
in droves because they want to try some of that 'good stuff.'"
<P>

A doctor at Episcopal Hospital said, "They're not breathing when
they come in, with a faint and irregular heartbeat.  But when we
administer Narcan, the scopolamine kicks in and they become
wild."
<P>

The doctor said that by judging how fast the victims came in, he
believes that the heroin cocktail was a deliberate bad batch
that was put out onto the street to ruin a specific drug dealer.
The doctor speculated, "You have fights between drug lords and
sometimes one will try to poison the clients of another out of
revenge."
<P>

Philadelphia Police deployed an additional 50 officers into the
northern Philadelphia neighborhood.  It is feared that the
situation will repeat itself over the weekend after drug users
receive their pay and welfare checks.  Drug selling was reported
to still be brisk on Friday.
<P>

ERRI has issued a on-going alert for Baltimore, MD, where EMS
crews handled more than twenty cases of apparent drug overdoses, in
a short period of time, on Friday night. According to Emergency Medical 
Service (EMS) sources, the overdoses in Baltimore may not be related to those in
Philadelphia, as the heroin there does not contain the same ingredients
as those striken in the city of "Brotherly Love." Investigations continue there.
<P>

The ERRI emergency service alert also now extends to New York City, 
New Jersey, Boston, Washington, DC and other cities in the 
Northwest corridor, where previous drug distribution patterns could 
suggest possible importation. In January and February of this year, a 
heroin mixture called "Polo" or "Death Shot" was believed to have 
been exported from Newark, NJ and into Philadelphia after more than 100 
overdoses were reported in a 24 hour period in New Jersey. "Polo" 
was also a heroin/scopolamine mixture.
<P>

ERRI/ENN respectfully requests that it be notified of additional
multi-patient incidents involving "Super Buick"/"Homicide", so
that we can provide additional updates to emergency and news
agencies. Please call, fax, or e-mail:

<H2>NYPD OFFICER COMMITS SUICIDE IN MIDTOWN THEATER</H2>
By Jim Fay  ENN NYC-NJ Metro Correspondent
<P>

While the tunes of the very popular Irish group
"Black 47" played on stage, an off-duty, and apparently
intoxicated, NYPD police officer took out his weapon
and fired one shot at himself.
<P>

In addition, two other members of the audience sitting
next to him were injured from the shooting.  One of these
victims was the wife of the lead singer of "Black 47," Larry
Kirwin, the other was the wife of the group's road manager.
<P>

The incident took place at the Academy Theater, at 234 W. 43 St.
in Manhattan. "Black 47" usually draws a capacity crowd to their
concerts, and reports indicate that this was so on Saturday,
St. Patrick's Day Eve.  At approximately 2300 hrs.,
P.O.  Christopher Gargan, 22, of the  Midtown South Precinct,
unexpectedly drew his weapon from his holster. 
<P> 

Other off-duty officers immediately attempted to stop Gargan from waving the gun
around, but Gargan ignored the officers and fired one shot.
He was sitting in the balcony, and the majority of the
theater, as well as the band, were not initially aware of
the incident.  The band stopped playing when the house lights
were raised and the balcony patrons were seen running towards
the exit.
<P>

The officer was transported to Bellevue Hospital were he died
from his injuries. The wives of the band members were reported
to be in serious but stable condition.

<P>
<H2>ONE COP KILLED IN BRONX CAR-STOP SHOOTOUT...</H2>
By Jim Fay  ENN NYC-NJ Metro Correspondent
<P>

A car stop in The Bronx of a recently carjacked stolen
auto by an NYPD plainclothes team ended in numerous
shots being fired, and resulting in one officer dead, one
off-duty officer wounded, and at least three bystanders
and one suspect injured from gunfire. Late reports, this morning, indicate that three of the
four suspects have been apprehended.
<P>

At 2150 hrs., EST, on Thursday, March 14, officers from
the NYPD plainclothes Citywide Street Crime Unit pulled over
what was reported to be a stolen BMW, which was carjacked
earlier in the evening, at the intersection of The Grand
Concourse and East 183 Street in The Bronx.  The four occupants
of the stolen car exited the vehicle shooting, hitting Police Officer
Kevin Gillespie, 33, just above his protective vest.  Two off-duty
Transit Bureau officers enroute to work came upon the scene,
one of whom was shot in the neck.
<P>

After the initial encounter, officers pursued the suspects
on foot to the vicinity of East 184 St. and Creston Avenue.
During this chase, shots by the perpetrators and police continued,
hitting three bystanders, one 40 year old female and two fourteen
year old males.  One suspect was shot and apprehended at the
Creston Ave. location.  NYPD radio frequencies instructed units to
check hospitals in their patrol areas for the possibility that
one other suspect was shot. A search of the area by NYPD bloodhounds and Emergency Service
Units from Emergency Squads 3 and 4 continued into the early
morning with no success.
<P>

Officer Gillespie was transported to the nearby St. Barnabas
Hospital, where he succumbed to his wounds.  The Transit officer
that was shot was taken by NYC*EMS to Jacobi Hospital, where
he was said to be in serious but stable condition.
<P>

Officer Gillespie, a Nassau County, Long Island, resident, leaves a
wife and two young sons.  Gillespi would have turned 34 next week.
New York City Mayor Rudolph Guiliani said, "Police Officer Kevin
Gillespie was a hero.  He was a very, very dedicated police officer."
<P>
ENN sends its prayers and condolences to the family and friends pf Off. Gillespie.

<H2>THE CHANGING FACE OF THE FIRE SERVICE - PART 2</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

This is Part Two of a series that we are entitling, "The Changing Face Of The Fire Service."  In Part One we learned how the Boston Fire Department is thinking about altering its mission, a bit, in the face of budgetary constraints.
<P>

It is now a fact that EMS services comprise the bulk of department responses.  For example, Phoenix, Arizona, in 1991 responded to 105,754 emergencies of which 76 percent were for medical emergencies.
<P>

Tradition-bound fire departments in the United States are going to have to adjust their missions a bit to reflect this new reality. So far, very few have done so since this article was written in December of 1994.  Some departments that have tried to make the adjustment have met some resistance by old-timers in the department who see their job only to fight fires.
<P>

The author has studied and has extensive files on most major fire departments in the U.S.  The only department that I have seen to fully embrace the future mission of the fire service has been the Phoenix, Arizona, Fire Department that is led by Chief Alan V. Brunacini.  Brunacini is seen as probably the most innovative fire chief in the world today and his department reflects that.
<P>

The concept of the Paramedic-Engine, an engine company with at least two paramedic-firefighters aboard is the future.  While not new, there are still only a few departments, today, implementing this concept.  Phoenix uses the concept extensively and it works very well.
<P>

In this second and final part we will learn how other departments are looking toward EMS to justify and in, some cases, increase their budgets.
<P>

Regular readers to this publication who read Gary Ludwig's column will recognize the debate and competition between EMS services provided by fire departments and private ambulance companies.
<P>
<HR>
Sure, firefighters still want to get your cat out of the tree.  But they'd much rather check your blood sugar, vaccinate your kids, take you to the hospital and -- best of all -- send you the bill.
<P>

In the past two years, dozens of fire departments nationwide have tried to grab a piece of the ambulance and paramedic business before its devoured by a merger-crazed health care industry.
<P>

For the firefighters, it's a matter of necessity.  Thanks to more than two decades of wildly successful fire prevention programs, firefighters spend less time fighting fires and much more trying to keep city councils from slashing their budgets.
<P>

Since 1992, four monolithic corporations have emerged from either of investment capital, swallowed 75 of the nation's biggest local ambulance companies in 33 states and positioned themselves as cheaper alternatives to public paramedics.
<P>

At least once a week, one of the behemoths buys a local ambulance company.  In two years, they have taken control of one quarter of what analysts conservatively estimate to be a $4 billion business.
<P>

The private sector, once dominated by moonlighting morticians who slapped flashing red lights on their hearses, now uses satellites to position its ambulances, Wall Street to bankroll its acquisitions and courts and local governments to fight bruising turf battles with a firefighting lobby trying desperately to preserve its place in American culture -- not to mention city budgets.
<P>

"Fire departments nationwide have made it clear the only way they're going to remain in operation is if they go into the ambulance business," said Dan Smiley, chief deputy director of California's Emergency Medical Services Authority.  "This is survival for both sides, public and private," Smiley said.  "Only one can get the call, and they both want it."
<P>

What they want most is the Medicaid, Medicare and private health insurance reimbursements for a trip to the hospital. Both also want to expand into EMS' logical extension: using those well-equipped vehicles to deliver non-emergency care for profit.
<P>

"You're going to see a lot of change in EMS.  You're going to see them provide more diabetes screening, medication delivery for the elderly, vaccinations," said Dr. Scott Zietlow, medical transportation chief for the Mayo Clinic.
<P>

A new nationwide effort by the firefighters to seize EMS from private ambulance companies is being encouraged by national lobby groups who fear the private ambulance industry is getting too big, too powerful and, most of all, too efficient to withstand.
<P>

"What rang our bell is there seemed to be a concerted effort by several large EMS companies in this country to dominate the industry," said Doug Brown, top lobbyist for the International Association of Fire Chiefs.  "If they can knock away EMS from the fire service, they will knock away the fire department."
<P>

<B>A brief tour of the battlefield:</B>
<P>

* Private ambulance companies have gone to court in at least eight California communities in the past two years seeking to stop the local fire department from taking over the paramedic business.
<P>

* In September, Bacon Raton, Florida, fired its private ambulance company so the fire department could get the insurance reimbursements.
<P>

* Firefighters are livid in Louisiana, where a regional ambulance company is advertising a "311" emergency service to compete with the publicly staffed 911.
<P>

* In Fresno, California, last July, the city decided its public paramedics are superfluous to the private sector and eliminated their budget.
<P>

* Ambulance giant American Medical Response, Inc., earlier this year tried to buy the ambulance company serving Rochester, Minnesota, home of the Mayo Clinic.  Mortified Mayo worried about losing its local ambulance provider to a giant national firm, stepped in and matched the bid.
<P>

* In March, Portland, Oregon, narrowly rejected this year a measure to let firefighters handle ambulance service in life- threatening cases.
<P>

* In Albany, New York, the common council in September settled a fued by giving firefighters a cut of ambulance company insurance reimbursements.
<P>

Experts say it's unclear, yet doubtful, whether the turmult has caused any sharp rise in deaths.  If anything, the competition has led to vast improvements in response times.
<P>

Still EMS in general is a muddled mix of public, private, volunteer, hospital-based and hybrid systems that veer crazily in quality nationwide from the good to the bad to the extremely ugly.
<P>

"There is no uniformity in this country.  In some places, you can dial 911 in New York state and get an ambulance that was illegal in Arkansas in 1973," said Jack Stout, who has designed private systems for Kansas City, Fort Worth, Tulsa, and the former Israeli-occupied West Bank.
<P>

It's still far from decided whether EMS will be dominated by the health care industry or the public safety sector, but it's clear that the private side is creeping up on the guys in the red hats and galoshes.
<P>

Among the nation's 100 most-populous cities, the portion relying on the fire department for EMS has dropped from 48 percent in 1981 to 40 percent last year, according to the industry's Journal of Emergency Medical Services.
<P>

Cities relying solely on the private sector rose from 17 percent to 19 percent, and those using a combination of both went from 6 percent to 15 percent.  The rest used volunteer services, hospital paramedics or a public agency unaffiliated with the fire department.
<P>

Firefighters now typically spend only about 20 percent of their time fighting fires, mainly because of better building construction, tougher codes and mandatory smoke detectors.
<P>

Civilian fire deaths fell from 6,015 in 1977 to 3,720 last year, the National Fire Protection Association says.  Fire departments responded to 2.5 million fires in 1982 and only 1.9 million last year.
<P>

"Fire departments are waking up.  They're saying 'Our future's in EMS, or else we're going to be phased out,'" said Dr. Paul Pepe, the highly-respected head of Houston's Emergency Medical Services.
<P>

Perhaps the most bitter case is in Sacramento, where firefighters won a lawsuit last year allowing them to compete with private ambulance companies.  Now the city is considering taking over the entire market.
<P>

Its main competitor, Boston-based American Medical Response, has filed a federal antitrust suit.  AMR chief executive officer Paul Verrochi, who previously helped consolidate national sanitation and environmental services companies before moving into ambulances two years ago, said he isn't trying to put firefighters out of work.
<P>

He said it's clear, however, that "firefighters are trying to expand their scope of business in order to protect their jobs. The position we take is we can co-exist with a fire department," he said.  "Where we are having battles is where the firefighters say, 'Look, we want all the ambulance service."
<P>

With $350 million in annual revenues and dominant stakes in 17 states, AMR is the biggest of the four national ambulance companies that have transformed the industry. Two others formed within the past two years. Careline of Irvine, California and MedTrans, a division of Laidlaw, a $2 billion Ontario transportation company.
<P>

Rounding out the big four is Rural-Metro of Scottsdale, Arizona, a regional ambulance company that went national last year.  It already runs the fire department in Scottsdale -- the traditional firefighter's worst nightmare.
<P>

The merger mania in the ambulance business has coincided with the trend toward managed care in the health industry. The theory is that being big and regional is more cost-effective than being small and local.
<P>

The belief that President Clinton would get universal health coverage -- a concept tabled by Congress -- also fueled the acquistion fever.  Many EMS providers -- normally stiffed on 25 percent of their bills -- believed that meant the federal government would pick up ambulance bills.
<P>

The whole trend toward regional health care has threatened to take EMS out of the hands of local communities.  "Once the managed care providers get control of a region, they are going to force everyone to work together efficiently," said Tom Scott, director of the Emergency Care Information Center, a consultant group in Carlsbad, California.  "They don't want to deal with several fire departments and ambulance companies."
<P>

The ambulance companies are devouring each other so quickly that the American Ambulance Association, the industry's private trade group, has lost count of the transactions. "The modus operandi of these companies is to acquire and consolidate," said Lehman Brothers analyst Jefferey Kessler in New York.  "None of them is done doing deals."
<P>

Though the big ambulance companies say they have no desire to put the fire departments out of the paramedic business, Fire Chiefs' Association lobbyist Brown doesn't buy it.  "I would say firefighters do about 25 percent of the medical transport nationwide.  To ambulance companies, that's market share," he said.
<P>

Firefighters are clearly rattled.  Like the cowboy and the cop, the firefighter is an American icon.  "Hey, we do rescue stuff," Brown said.  "We get your cat out of the tree."

<H2>"Homicide" Heroin strikes Philadelphia; 11 Critical</H2>
By: Clark Staten
<P>

Chicago, IL, May 10, 1996 (ENN)-- Philadelphia paramedics had a
busy night last night. According to one veteran medic, they
responded to more than 116 calls for overdoses of a new heroin
called "Homicide", or "Super Buick." The exact pharmacological properties of the
drug have not been determined, but according to the medics it
can cause extremely violent behavior and has placed at least
eleven (11) patients in intensive care in a number of
Philadelphia hospitals.
<P>

Philly medics say that as they ran from overdose call to
overdose call, where they were faced with incoherent and violent
patients, who reported that they thought they had taken "some
'horse' named 'Homicide'."  The streetname was previously
unknown by police or paramedic sources in the area, but one
officer speculated that the drug could be heroin mixed with PCP,
an animal tranquilizer. The drug enforcement officer, who asked not to be identified, said that such a mixture could account for the violent behavior that was exhibited by any number of "Homicide" victims. The officer cautioned, however, that a toxicological examination must be done in order to actually identify the substance. 
<P>

An normally reliable EMS source from the Philadelpia suburbs told ENN 
that he believed that heroin was mixed with a "surgical anesthetic" 
and may be similar to a streetdrug called "Tango & Cash" which resulted in
numerous overdoses in the New York City/New Jersey area in 1994. It still remains unknown if this latest series of incidents is related to the distribution of a drug called "Polo"
or "Death Shot", which caused a number of overdoses in New Jersey, New York City, and Philadelphia in Feburary of this year.
<P>

ENN is gathering more information about how widely the drug was
distributed and if similar reports have been received from other
communities. Philadelphia police are said to be blanketing the
area where several overdoses occurred and are notifying known
drug abusers about the dangers of the drug. Extreme caution is
recommended when attempting to manage patients who have taken
this drug. Several emergency personnel and restraints may be
needed to adequately assure the patients and rescuers safety.
<P>

Parties that become aware of, and would like to report similar
overdoses, or would like to obtain additional information about
the emergence of this drug can contact us at:
<P>
<HR>

(Editor's Note: 14:30CDT -- Additional information that has been developed suggests that a preliminary tox screen of the "Homicide or SuperBuick" has come back, and it appears that it consists of Scopolamine, Heroin, Cocaine,  Dextromethorphan & Thiamine. )

<B>**LEAD STORY**</B>
<H3>FDNY ENDS YEAR IN TRAGEDY...</H3>
By Jim Fay,  ENN NYC/NJ Metro Correspondent
<P>

Lieutenant John M. Clancy was doing exactly what he
was suppose to do as the officer of Queens Ladder
Company 127, one of the first arriving ladder
companies: initiating a search.
<P>

Late reports are that an arrest has been made,
and Lieutenant Clancy was a victim of sabotage
of the floor of the fatal vacant building.
<P>

The two alarm fire, which occurred on Sunday morning,
December 31, at 0700 hrs.,EST, was in a building known
to be a vacant building. But to any experienced
firefighter, "vacant" does not mean "unoccupied."
Clancy knew that squatters usually stayed in
vacant buildings in NYC, either to live in or to
conduct drug activity.
<P>  

In any event, a search had to be made.  He went 
to the rear entrance of the building, entered 
the door, and the stairway landing collapsed 
underneath him, taking the 35-year-old Clancy 
into the raging fire that was in the basement. 
It is now reported that the landing was sabotaged 
to prevent other drug dealers from entering into 
this "drug den." A piece of linoleum was placed over a
large hole in the floor. When Clancy made
his first step on the "trap," he fell to the
basement.  Although he was immediately rushed
to the hospital, Clancy succumbed to his burns
and trauma injuries.
<P>

Lieutenant Clancy's exposure to the FDNY did not start
with his appointment as a firefighter. His father, Edward
Clancy, was a thirty-year veteran of the Fire Department,
retiring as a Deputy Chief from the old 10th Division
in Brooklyn and the 13th Division in Queens.
Edward Clancy died two years ago.  Lieutenant Clancy
is survived by his wife, who is six months pregnant
with their first child, and his mother.
<P>
**************************************************************************************
<BR>
Editors Note: It is now being reported that a suspect in this
arson fire is now in NYPD custody.  Crack houses or drug 
dens, such as this building are fairly common in many parts
of New York City. 
<P> 

A file of known drug houses is maintained in the FDNY's
Critical Information Dispatch System (CIDS).  The CIDS
program is able to provide fire companies critical information
about specific buildings.  Responding units are alerted to
dangerous or hazardous conditons that are not apparent from
the front of the building.  Booby-traps, such as what Lt. Clancy
fell through and discarded needles are only some of the hazards
that firefighters face in these type of buildings.
<P>
The funeral mass for Lt. Clancy will be on Thursday, January 4, 1996
at 1000 EST at Our Lady of Snows Church, located on Blue Point
Avenue in Blue Point, Long Island, New York.
<P>
ENN sends it's prayers and condolences to the family and friends of
Lt. Clancy...he paid the ultimate price while trying to keep the citizens of New York safe from the ravages of fire.

<H2>NOVEMBER 17 TERRORIST ORGANIZATION...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Managing Editor
<P>

It may not be as well known as Islamic Jihad in the Middle East
or the Irish Republican Army, but the Greek terrorist organization
known as November 17 has been around committing terrorist acts in
Greece since 1975.  November 17 is known as the most feared group
in Greece and is also one of the most deadliest in all of Europe.
<P>

The signal birth of this group came on December 23, 1975 when
Richard Welch, the United States Central Intelligence Agency
station chief in Athens was shot and killed by three men as
he returned from a party.  Welch was killed by a .45-caliber
pistol that became the trademark of the terrorist group.
<P>

The number of murdered victims that can be attributed to November 17
would be considered small.  Only 20 since 1975.  Their victims
include three other American officials and one person who worked
for Americans.  Two Diplomats from Turkey and 13 Greeks.  Through
the years the terrorist group has also been responsible for about
35 attacks, mostly bombings and missile attacks, on Greek tax
offices and multi-national corporations.
<P>

But the one thing that distinguishes the November 17 terrorist
organization from any other terrorist organization is -- in over
twenty years -- not one single member of this group has ever been
arrested.  The identities of any November 17 members remains
unknown to Greek, American and European police and intelligence
agencies.  No other terrorist group can make that same claim.
<P>

One Greek politician, who was one of the few to ever survive a
November 17 attack, said, "From then until now, Greece is the
only country where it has been impossible to not only smoke out
terrorism, but even to make a single substantial strike against it."
<P>

Why has November 17 been able to remain untouched?
German authorities were able to destroy the Red Army Faction.
France wiped out a terrorist group that was known as Action Direct.
In 1987, Italy was able to bring an end to the Red Brigades.
In other nations in Europe -- Irish separatists, Basque Separatists
in Spain, and Corsican separatists in France have had members
arrested. In Greece, it's an altogether different story.  The group has
several known M.O's.  Authorities can tell that the people who
make bombs for the organization were apparently trained in the
Middle East during the early 1970's.
<P>

Greek authorities will not directly comment on terrorism issues.
But counter-terrorism experts from other countries believe that
the group has between 10 to 25 members.  It believed to be very 
small and and thus able to maintain its secrecy and security.
The origin of the group is still somewhat vague, but it is believed
that its founders were part of resistance group that was formed
during the 1967-75 military dictatorship in Greece.  It is also
believed that Greek Socialist Premier Andreas Papendreou may had
played some hand in its beginnings. 
<P> 
After democracy returned to Greece in 1975, it is believed that
many of the original members went their own way. Papendreou, 
who has been seriously ill for a long time, is believed to know
the identities of some of the members of the group, but it is 
expected that he will take those names to his grave. It is 
said that the name of the group comes from the day in 1973
when the Greek military sent tanks and soldiers to squash a
student uprising at Athens Polytechnic University.
<P>

The ideology of Novenber 17 leans toward Marxist-Leninism.  They
are known to be anti-European Union, anti-NATO and anti-American. 
The United States was picked as a target because it supported
the former Greek military dictatorship.They are extremely nationalistic 
and have recently called for an armed uprising against the middle
and upper classes in Greece. Essentially, to cause fear in the 
population -- a common terrorist tactic.
<P>

One counter-terrorism expert said that November 17 is unique in
that it appears not to lead any political movement.  They don't
call for a separate state for any one particular ethnic group
as do many other terrorist organizations in places like Spain,
France or India.
<P>

But since the Cold War ended a few years ago, it caused an
ideological problem for November 17.  The group is now shifting
targets.  The group's last known attack was made in May of 1995
when it fired two anti-tank rockets at a Greek television network
building.  The television network was called a capitalist tool.
There were no injuries in the attack.
<P>

It was announced by Greek authorities in mid-December that they
plan to spend about $30 million to overhaul their anti-terrorism
services.  But one counter-terrorism expert said that he didn't
think that money alone will be able to stop November 17.  He
said, "We just hope they make a mistake one day."

<H2>ValuJet Flt. 592 Reported Down in the Everglades Near Miami</H2>
By: Clark Staten
<P>

The FAA is reporting that a DC-9, ValuJet Flight #592, enroute from Miami to Atlanta, GA, has reportedly crashed in a "swampy" area approximately 15 miles from Miami.  According to airport officials in Miami, there was reported "smoke in the cockpit" of the doomed plane and the pilot attempted to return to Miami. There were reported to be 109 souls on-board. The crash reportedly occured at approximately 14:15EDT.
<P>

Search and Rescue units from Miami-Dade Fire/Rescue, the U.S. Coast Guard, and several other agencies are either on-scene or enroute to what is being described as an "everglade area."  As the impact area is entirely underwater, some difficulty in reaching the scene can be anticipated. Airboats and other waterborne craft will need to be used by rescuers to reach the crash site.
<P>

No survivors were immediately reported, and only very small pieces of the plane were seen by helicopter units that have been searching in the area. No cause for the crash has been determined.  Additional details are coming in and ENN will provide additional reports as the circumstances warrant.

<H2>THE INFERNO ON COTTAGE GROVE AVENUE...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Managing Editor
<P>
Chicago firefighters are being called heroes for their efforts at a 5-11 Alarm fire on Box 222 at 3555 South Cottage Grove  Avenue on Chicago's South Side.  The fire started in a fifth floor apartment unit in a large 10-story brick 200-unit Chicago  Housing Authority (CHA) apartment building.  Very heavy fire was showing out the windows when firefighters first arrived on the scene at about 0325 CST.  Strong winds pushed the blaze out  into the fifth floor hallway.
<P>

The first job for firefighters was rescues.  Frightened people were hanging out of windows on all floors and several victims did jump. One firefighter said, "People were hanging out of windows all over."
<P>

The one word that has been used to describe the rescue efforts of  the CFD members has been, "heroic."  60 people were rescued from  the building.  As truck companies were raising their ladders to  windows, people reportedly jumped upon them.  Six aerial ladders and Squad 1's snorkel were used to rescue victims from windows.
<P>

Firefighter Bill Heenan reportedly made a miraculous catch of a child.  As Heenan was climbing up the ladder, a child was dropped from a window -- Heenan reached out and caught the child with one hand.  A similar rescue was also reportedly made by Firefighter Brian Rafferty.  In all, seven children were reportedly dropped from windows.
<P>

An Emergency Medical Services Plan Number Three brought 15 Chicago Fire Department ambulances to the scene.  A conflicting number of between 51 and 54 people were injured in this blaze. Included in the injured were two CFD members.  The victims were transported to nine area hospitals.  At last report, three victims were in serious condition, nine were in fair and eight were in good condition.  31 other people were treated and released. Despite the heroic efforts to save everyone, four people did die in this blaze.  One of the victims died from injuries sustained when she jumped from an upper floor.
<P>

It took firefighters about 90 minutes to bring this fire under control.  There was a Special Call for four additional truck  companies over the 5-11 Alarm assignment. It was a very hot fire with temperatures estimated at 1000 degrees (F).  Chicago Fire Commissioner Raymond Orozco said, "There was a tremendous  amount of heat.  You could compare this to a blowtorch."   A preliminary  report from fire investigators indicated that the cause of the blaze may  be careless use of smoking materials.

<P>
<H2>THE CYBER TERRORISTS ...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

A fascinating story came out of London this past weekend that appears to have dire consequences.  Several financial institutions, such as banks, brokerage firms and other large corporations, have paid extortion money to sophisticated international "cyber terrorists." Huge sums of money have reportedly been paid to these criminals who have threatened to destroy computer systems and ... have proven that they can do it.
<P>

Companies in the United States have also fallen victim to these criminals.  A London Sunday Times investigation has learned that British and American law enforcement agencies are looking into forty known "attacks" on financial institutions in London and in New York since 1993.
<P>

Vast sums of money have been paid to the blackmailers who have proven their ability by using "information warfare" techniques that may have been learned in   military or government service.  The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), which utilizes some of the most sophisticated computer systems in the world, has said that the criminals have penetrated computer systems by using what are called "logic bombs."  These are coded devices that can be detonated remotely.  They have also used electromagnetic pulses and "high emission radio frequency guns."  These M.O.'s do have a distinct military bent to them.
<P>

These blackmailers are anything but subtle in their methods. They have left encrypted threats at the highest security levels (root)  of the computer systems that they have attacked and have left messages such as: "Now do you believe we can destroy your computers?"
<P>

Authorities have been unable to stop the attacks.  It is highly suspected that some of the criminals are in the United States. Banks and other financial institutions have also not been very forthcoming with law enforcement investigators.  Many fail to even notify the police of the crime.  One security director of a London bank said, "They have given in to blackmail rather than risk a collapse in confidence in their security systems."
<P>

"We are aware of the extortion methods, but the banking community has ways of dealing with it and rarely reports to the police," said a senior police detective in London. Special investigative units have been set up in both the U.S. and in Europe.  But the financial institutions have closed ranks and have hindered the investigations of the cyber criminals.
<P>

In April, experts in the field of information warfare met in Brussels, Belgium. to discuss the threat.  There has also been a closed meeting with the British intelligence community.  And it is being reported that there was a secret seminar held in Washington, D.C. just this past weekend with the cyber terrorists as the main agenda topic.
<P>

The international investigation firm, Kroll Associates, confirmed last week they have been called in to assist some financial firms through the blackmailing schemes.  In New York City, a Kroll Associates spokesman said, "One of the problems we face is that the potential embarrasment from loss of face is very serious. The problem for law enforcement is that the crime is carried out globally, but law enforcement agencies stop at each frontier."
<P>

On Saturday, a spokesman for the Bank of England confirmed that his bank has come under attack by the cyber terrorists.  Scotland Yard has assigned a senior detective from its computer crime unit to take part in a European-wide operation that has been codenamed, "Lathe Gambit."

In the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has three separate squads investigating computer extortion.  The U.S. Secret Service is also involved in computer crime. (See earlier ENN story on FBI Nation Computer Crime Squad: <A HREF="/fbi-nccs.htm"><B>Click here to see NCCS article</B></A>)
<P>

The U.S. National Security Agency believes that there are four separate cyber terrorist gangs in operation.  As has been reported in this publication previously, there is evidence that at least one of the gangs is based in Russia.
<P>

These are four of the extortion cases that the NSA is reportedly taking a very hard look at:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>-- 6 January 1993.  A computer crash halted trading at a British brokerage house.  A L10 million pound ransom was paid into a Zurich, Switzerland, bank account.
<LI>-- 14 January 1993.  A British bank paid a ransom of L12.5 million pounds.
<LI>-- 29 January 1993.  L10 million pounds was paid by a British brokerage house in ransom after threats were made.
<LI>-- 17 March 1995.  A British defense firm paid a ransom of L10 million pounds.
</UL>
<P>
In each of the four above cases, the blackmailers threatened senior directors and demonstrated they could indeed crash the computer system.  Each of the four companies caved-in to the extortion demands within hours and wired the money to foreign bank accounts, from which the blackmailers removed the money within minutes of its arrival.
<P>

It is highly believed that the criminals gained their expertise in information warfare in the United States military.  The U.S. military has been known to develop "weapons" that can disable or destroy computer hardware.
<P>

This threat is very, very real and is very, very serious.  So far, the criminals have been satisfied in only gaining wealth. All of this sounds like something out of a thriller novel.  In Tom Clancy's last book -- "Debt Of Honor" -- cyber experts caused a major crash on the New York Stock Exchange.  It sounds like these real cyber terrorists could do that if they really wanted to do so.
<P>

Since it appears that at least some of these individuals may have been trained by  military agencies, do they have the expertise that could compromise Defense Department computers? Again, it sounds like they do.  For law enforcement agencies-- what would happen if the FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC) computer system were "hacked" or destroyed?
<P>

Everything, today, is run by computers and these individuals appear to have the ability to get into whatever they want. In the past, ENN has offered reports on general terrorism, the threat of nuclear, chemical and biological terrorism --"cyber terrorism" would appear to be on the same threat scale.  It's that serious.
<P>
<HR>
<B>For a further analysis, we offer the following from Mr. Winn Schwartau of Interpact, Inc., who is an expert in information warfare and security.  Mr. Schwartau is the author of the books entitled, "Information Warfare" and "Terminal Compromise."</B>
<P>
<H3>Class III Information Warfare: Has It Begun?</H3>

The June 2, 1996 Sunday Times from London front page headline reads: "City Surrenders to L400 million Gangs"
<P>

And HERF Guns, Electromagnetic Pulses and sophisticated logic bombs may be responsible.
<P>

At InfoWarCon II, Montreal Canada, I made reference to investigations I was conducting regarding concerted and organized attacks on up to 43 financial institutions in Europe and the US; an example of Class III Information Warfare.  This issue of London Sunday Times brings a glimpse of the story that will eventually be told.
<P>

The first attack in my files dates to January 6, 1993. A trading house in London  was blackmailed into paying L10million to unknown extortionists who demonstrated  they could crash the company's computers at will. The next incident in the Times  article is also in my files: January 14, 1993 where similar demonstrations and  demands were made for this time L12.5Million. And so is the next, January 29,  1993 and another L10Million siphoned off by the bad guys. According to my  figures and those in the Times article, hundreds of millions of pounds have been  paid ransom in what is clearly an example of Class III Information Warfare.
<P>

According to officials in Washington, Whitehall, London, City of London Police, the National Security Agency, Kroll Associates, Bank of  England and others (in  the article) the threats are credible. The attackers have the clear ability to bring trading and financial operations to a halt - exactly when they say they  will. "Banks, brokerage firms and investment houses in America have also  secretly paid ransom to prevent costly computer meltdowns and a collapse in the confidence among their customers," sources said in the article.
<P>

The article discussed the advanced information warfare techniques used by the perpetrators. "According to the American National Security Agency (NSA), they have penetrated computer systems using 'logic bombs' (coded devices that can be remotely detonated), electromagnetic pulses and 'high emission radio frequency guns' which blow a devastating electronic 'wind' through the computer systems."
[For a complete description of HERF Guns (coined by Schwartau
in 1990), see "Information Warfare: Chaos on the Electronic Superhighway," Thunders Mouth Press, 1994]
<P>

The perpetrators have also left encrypted messages, apparently bypassing the highest security levels of the systems, leaving messages such as "Now do you believe we can destroy your computers?" The NSA and other officials believe that four gangs are involved; probably one from the US and probably one from Russia.  But, because the crimes are international, national borders still prevail,  making investigation more difficult. Investigations and official inquiries have  been in progress for some time according to the article.
<P>

Now, for a few things you will not see in the article, but will hopefully [if I am lucky] come out in the near future. The number of attacks is way above 40.  They have been known about for almost three years, but only recently have people been willing to come out of the closet and discuss this highly sensitive issue with the media. Long briefs and analyses of these events have been submitted to  high level officials and select business persons for at least a year, but to no avail. [Security by obscurity reigns all too often.]  Banking is not the only industry that has been attacked and the attacks have been spread around Europe  as well as Australia.
<P>

As an industry many of us have said that the only way something will really be done is if we experience a Computer Chernobyl [Peter Neumann Phrase as I recall]  or as I first said in Congressional Testimony, "An Electronic Pearl Harbor." Are  these events the harbinger of strong reaction by the computer community at large? As  events unfold and more information is permitted to be disseminated over the next  few days and weeks, we will see.
<P>

We have essentially solved the issues of confidentiality and integrity. But, I have maintained that the real problem is going to be Denial of Service. These events are unfortunate, but clear examples of that reality.
<BR>
[End Mr. Schwartau's quoted comments]
<P>
A Bank of England official reportedly told reporters, "it is not the biggest issue in the banking market."  Hmmm...we're going to have to think about that. If our banking and defense systems are not secure...what is?

<TITLE>Hacker Attack on Boston Herald</TITLE>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 03/06/96-16:00CST (Update 03/11/96)

<H2>"Information Terrorist" Threatens Boston Herald; Investigation Ensues</H2>
By Paul Anderson, ENN Metro Correspondent
<P>

Chicago, IL, March 6, 1996 (ENN) --The Boston Herald is under
attack.  According to the United Press International (UPI), a
hacker has threatened both the Boston Herald newspaper and
several Internet Service providers in the Boston area. According
to Jason Hatch, the system administrator of BerkshireNet in
Boston, the hacker, who uses the on-line name of "u4ea", has
threatened to "crash computer systems all over Boston."
<P>

The hacker in question has been called an "information
terrorist" by at least one computer security analyst familiar
with "u4ea's" exploits during the past year.  In an exclusive
interview with ENN, the analyst who prefers to remain anonymous,
said that the hacker has gained access to the root directories
and destroyed the file structures of machines at George Mason
University, the University of Arkansas, at a site in the
Netherlands, and possibly some U.S. government sites. It is
estimated that "u4ea" may have covertly entered more than 100
separate systems in the past year.
<P>

"u4ea", who is also known as "el8ite", "eliteone", "el8", and
"B1ff" in e-mail and on Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channels has
also allegedly been spreading "neo-nazi" and "white supremacist"
materials. He may be operating from Canada, and is believed to
be from 20-27 years old. Experts say that he may also be
connected with a university in some way.  Intelligence sources
tell ENN that he has been using a U.S. government system at the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as at
least one jumping off point for his destructive work and racist
comments. 
<P>

Information from the "hacker community" indicates that "u4ea" is
a "phone phreaker" as well as a computer hacker and that he
often uses 800 numbers and other telephone switching and
electronic misdirection techniques to confuse those that would
search for him. He is known to use "password sniffers" and a
"spoof scheme" which allows him to appear to be a user other
than himself during illegal entries and e-mail exchanges. He is
also known to argue with and harass those that would disagree
with him.  Apparently he is not well liked by other "hackers"and
some even say that they would like to see him apprehended. And
lastly, according to one well respected researcher, "he is
damned dangerous...technically better than Kevin Mitnick...and
far more malicious."
<P>

To date, it does not appear that "u4ea" is motivated by either
money or specific ideological intent. At least one observer has
called him "manic-depressive" and "inconsistent in his
behavior." Although other motives are possible, including
allegations involving racist beliefs, one analyst told ENN that
he may be most motivated by publicity and a desire for
notoriety, particularly among the "hacker community". Some say
that what he really wants is "to be more famous than Kevin
Mitnick", who was recently arrested and imprisoned for breaking
into a number of computers.
<P>

In one of his most recent messages, "u4ea" allegedly taunted the
Federal Bureau of Investigation by saying that they had a
"better chance of finding Elvis (Presley) than the Mighty
u4ea...the FBI can't touch me."  Although the FBI will not
officially comment on what they say is an on-going
investigation, one agent told ENN that "e4ea" would be given the
"proper amount of attention...maybe in such a way that he won't
be pleased." 
<P>

Computer security investigators say that "u4ea" has also made
threats against those who would try to expose him, even to point
of threatening the family of a BerkshireNet employee, if they
went to the media with information about him.  Further, they
say, it is entirely possible that "u4ea" is capable of carrying
out these threats. One computer security analyst went so far as
to warn ENN that we or our computers could be "at serious risk"
for simply reporting this story.
<P> 

According to the UPI and Jason Hatch, "u4ea" signed off with a
cryptic message that "you have yet to see true electronic
terrorism...this is a promise."  From all the information
gathered so far, it would appear that this threat should be
taken seriously.
<P>
<HR>
(Late report: 03/11/96 - According to a reliable source at NYPD, an investigation has been begun in the New York City area regarding "u4ea".  Allegedly, someone using administrator Jason Hatch's (see above) e-mail account has been sending "anti-jewish" threats and other "white supremacist" materials to NYC residents in the past few days. An independent investigation is reportedly now underway by the NYPD Computer Crimes section.)

<H2>Federal Agents Raid Bomb Factory; Two in Custody</H2>
By Clark Staten
<P>

Chicago, IL, April 26, 1996 (ENN)--Federal agents from the FBI
and ATF fanned out into rural central Georgia today to raid
several houses and an alleged militia "bomb factory".  Early
reports had indicated that the agents had uncovered a plot to
bomb several Olympic venues before or during the upcoming Summer
games. Contradictory reports are now coming from senior federal
law enforcement officials, who are now saying that "there is no
known connection with a threat to the Olympics." "Either way,"
an unidentified local sheriff's deputy said, "we have taken some
bombs off the streets that could have maimed or killed any
number of people."
<P>

Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms agents raided homes in
Crawford County, Georgia early today and at least two people
have been taken into custody. The detained individuals were
identified as "militia members" by an ATF spokesperson.  Also
reportedly taken into custody were several "bomb components"
that could be used to construct pipe bombs. Arrest warrants that
were used in the raids charged the militia members with
"conspiracy to possess and distribute explosive devices", in
violation of federal law.
<P>

Counter-Terrorist (CT) analysts and federal law enforcement
agencies have expressed their concerns, in the past several
months, about a possible domestic terrorism threat directed
against Atlanta and the Olympic venues. Several multi-agency
drills have been conducted in the past two weeks involving
bombings, poison gases, and biological agents. A variety of
special teams have been relocated and are said to be studying
the necessary intelligence to assist in Atlanta, should that be
necessary. All are said to be on a "high state of alert" for
either a domestic or international attack.
<P>

Whether or not the specific bombs and bombers involved in
today's arrests were the source of these fears may remain at
issue. But, one thing is certain. The FBI and local law
enforcement agencies have "pulled out all the stops" and are
utilizing numerous resources in an attempt to prevent or
mitigate any possible threat to the 1996 Olympic games.  Today's
action in Crawford County may have just been a preemptive
measure to reduce one of any number of possible threats as the
opening of the games draws nearer.

<H2>EMS in the Fire Service;
                 Productivity for the 90's ??</H2>

<BR>

                <B> By: Clark Staten, EMT-P, I/C 
<BR>
                       EMS District Commander, Chicago Fire Dept.</B></center>
<P>

A major debate seems to be brewing within the Fire Service.
It is one that has been developing for several years. It
appears to be a controversy borne of misunderstanding and
human nature.  However, it is a reality to be faced within
this decade.  Should the Fire Department be the primary
provider of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in your
community ??
<P>

Some traditional fire service professionals have said for
years; "We don't need that  %#@%&*^$  (expletive deleted)
ambulance work!". "We have more than enough to do...just
fighting fires".  "Get rid of that *&^%$#@#$% (deleted again)
ambulance and we won't be bothered all night!".  "Besides, we
didn't get hired to "play doctor", we FIGHT FIRES for a
living".  In some fire departments, it was "unoffical"
punishment to be detailed to the ambulance.
<P>

For years, the City/Village Manager or Mayor was willing to
listen to these type of comments and accept them as truthful,
necessary, and forthright.  He/she maybe even commensurated
with the firefighters as having a tremendously dangerous and
demanding job.  In some towns and cities, the Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) may even have been persuaded to turn the task
of EMS over to a private provider by contract, or into
developing a "third emergency service" within the community.
The fire service moved further and further away from non-
fire-related duties and providing emergency medical care.
<P>

Then came the late 1970's and early 1980's..... budget cuts,
rising taxes, and "Proposition 13" type legislation which
manadated "reductions in force" of municipal and state
employees.  Financial responsibility became the "watchword"
for elected officials.  "Productivity" was the name of the
game, and those departments and functions that were "Non-
Productive" came under closer and closer scrutiny.
<P>

Management experts came to government.  Analysis of time and
motion began to happen.  Chief Executives began to examine
what their employees actually did.  Concurrent with this
self-examination, came a television show called "Emergency".
"Roy and Johnny" made Paramedics and emergency medical
services a household word.  People began to expect the same
type of service that they saw being provided on T.V. and
wanted it to be provided with the same tax dollars that they
were already paying.  The "dual-role" firefighter/paramedic
was thrust in the public imagination.   Soon....every
firefighter was a paramedic and every paramedic was a
firefighter...in the view of the public.
<P>

Several fire departments saw the advantage of this response
model and "jumped on the band-wagon".  Soon... there actually
were firefighter/paramedics all over the country.
Particularly in the Western part of the United States, the
idea seemed to be accepted as "THE" way to go.  However, in
the Mid-Western and Eastern part of the country, this concept
seemed to be often rejected in favor of maintaining the
"status-quo" within the fire service.
<P>

As previously mentioned, many "old-line" departments clung to
the concept that "all" they had to do was fight fires. Some
completely refused to participate in EMS, and rejected
additional emergency medical care training.  They maintained
that "what they were doing was enough" and they persuaded
union and fraternal organizations to "bargain away" the
ambulance work.
<P>

As the "efficiency experts" continued their inevitable
"march" through the various city departments in search of
unused or mismanaged tax dollars, they often missed emergency
response agencies.  The city Police and Fire departments
avoided the inquisition for a long period of time, largely
due to official and public perception of the danger and
necessity of the jobs.
<P>

However, "all good things" eventually come to an end.  The
analysts soon began to investigate the seemingly "untouchable
departments" (e.g. Fire & Police). Once there, it was often
discovered that.....YES.....there was waste and mismanagement
of resources within the "emergency" departments.  All too
frequently, statistical analysis showed that fire prevention
efforts, sprinkler systems, and stricter fire codes had paid
off.  Fire departments were doing fewer and fewer fire
suppression related responses. The ambulances did more responses
and the fire trucks fewer.
<P>

Additional dissection showed that as fire suppression forces
did less and less work, emergency medical service crews did
more and more!  This was particularly evident in departments
that had abandoned EMS.  In departments that had maintained
EMS as a fire department activity, or as a division or bureau
of the department; administrators and analysts found that EMS
was comprising from 50-70% of the department's emergency work
load.
<P>

Then, "push came to shove".....the budget "axe" fell and the
various city managers and mayors were forced to take action.
In the towns where EMS had been forced out of the fire
service, employment "lay-offs" began to occur. The positions
of retired firefighters weren't filled.  Fire stations were
being closed.  And yet, the formulation of many "third
service" or private ambulance organizations was even
encouraged and supported by some fire service organizations.
<P>

In certain parts of the fire service, traditional attitudes
and behaviors prevailed. In some towns, it was "cheaper" and
"politically easier" to hire paramedics and form a new
department than to try to convince the firefighters that EMS
was their job.  However, the budget to support this function,
had to come from somewhere.  Where would it come from?
<P>

Well, in several civic locations, the previously closed
firehouses were turned over to the "fledgling" EMS
departments. The monies saved from firefighter's salaries
were quickly given to EMTs or Paramedics.  The public
recognition and perception of paramedics demanded that their
services be provided.  After all....statistics don't lie;
Give the resources to the people doing the work, many Chief
Executives reasoned.
<P>

Other fire departments soon found that additional duties were
being "handed" to the EMTs or Paramedics.  Soon, the young
and aggressive EMS personnel had assumed extrication, dive
rescue, hazardous materials, and other traditional ancillary
duties of the fire department. In some cities, all the fire
department did...was go to fires.  And.. while this seemed to
be the best possible alternative for some firefighters, it
only aggravated the decline of those same departments.
<P>

Suddenly, at the end of the 1980's, and into the 1990's,
various fire departments found themselves experiencing the
results of their own folly.  The preverbal saying; "Be
careful what you ask for...you might get it...came true".
Those departments that had resisted EMS and won the
battle...lost the war. They were now fighting a desperate
fight to maintain manning levels and to avoid the closing of
additional fire stations.  By the 1990's,  EMS had come into
it's own and those that had not embraced it were suffering
from the purposeful "alienation of affection" between EMS and Fire.
<P>
<H4>CONCLUSION:</H4>
That brings us to today. The fire service finds itself at a
cross-roads.  Today's demands of productivity will
necessitate changes in tommorow's fire service. The number of
fires continues to diminish in most towns and cities.  The
demand for Emergency Medical Services continues to increase.
<P>

The fire service can (collectively) be "down-sized" to meet
the demand for solely, fire-suppression-related duties and
suffer the inevitable lay-offs, cut-backs, and reductions-in-
force or it can become productive and truely meet the needs
of the mission for which it was originally intended.... the
SAVING OF LIVES.
<P>

Few will disagree that the very most productive use of any
firefighter's time is the saving of LIVES!  However, some
will cling to the notion that their real job is simply rescue
and then to turn to the protection of property. They will continue to
brag about that "nice stop" of a fire, or "how much smoke
they ate" as they watch the injuried taken away by another
agency.  They will refuse to admit that their involvement
should be more extensive, or that a life could have been
saved....if.... they had known what to do.
<P>

The most heroic rescue will only prove as effective as the
medical care that is then provided.  Only through the prompt
and proper provision of both... RESCUE & EMERGENCY MEDICAL
CARE, will the citizen derive the greatest benefit.  To
suggest that these necessarily concurrent duties should be
performed by different agencies is both an ineffective and
costly use of valuable personnel and an unacceptable
compromise of the public trust.
<P>

Therefore, it is the hypothesis of this author that the fire
service must enthusiastically foster and support the
inclusion of emergency medical care training and practice
within it's ranks.......or the service as a whole....and the
citizens we serve, will undoubtedly suffer the consequences.

<p><font size=5><strong>Olympic Safety &amp; Security; Emergency Response-1996 </strong></font></p>
<p>Chicago, IL, July 15, 1996 (ENN) -- According to Olympic planning authorities, no stone has been left 
unturned in their efforts to plan for all possible contingencies during the upcoming games in Atlanta. Experts say 
that a preliminary assessment of potential problems would reveal some interesting challenges that may lay ahead 
for the Olympic security, medical, and emergency services staff. </p>
<p>In order of likelihood, Clark Staten of the Emergency Response &amp; Research Institute (ERRI) has issued the 
following list of potential problems that the staff of the Olympics might anticipate and have to contend with: </p>
<p><strong>&lt;1&gt; Heat Injuries/Emergencies </strong></p>
<p>Having planned and acted as the Fire/EMS incident commander for the Chicago-based &quot;Taste of Chicago&quot; 
celebration, in which as many as 1.5 million people participate each year, Staten says that Atlanta weather may 
prove to be a major difficulty for Olympic medical officials. With high temperatures and humidity, the possibility 
of numerous cases of heat cramps, exhaustion and stroke can be expected. Depending on conditions, literally 
hundreds of people may be overcome with heat emergencies, each day, during the games. </p>
<p><strong>&lt;2&gt; Mass Casualty Personnel/Preparation </strong></p>
<p>According to Olympic officials, and in keeping with the general &quot;volunteer spirit&quot; of the games, most emergency 
medical care at the Olympics will be provided by American Red Cross first aiders, volunteer EMT's, nurses, 
and doctors from throughout the country. While this may be a cost effective alternative to hiring a large 
professional staff, some experts fear that it may also prove ineffectual in the management of a potential large 
multiple-casualty event (See #3,4,5 below). As currently configured, it appears possible that this system could 
also be overwhelmed by a series of small incidents or a large influx of patients from multiple sites, (See #1 
above) simultaneously. It has been suggested that at least a small &quot;core group&quot; of professional Fire/EMS 
managers may prove necessary to effectively allocate resources, manage emergency personnel, and provide 
necessary coordination and oversight of all of the venues and responding emergency agencies. </p>
<p><strong>&lt;3&gt; Crowd Control/Soccer Violence </strong></p>
<p>Although Olympic events generally draw a different type of crowd than professional sporting events, the real 
possibility of crowd related violence continues to exist. Particularly in the Soccer venue, and to some extent in 
some others, rivalry between fans could cause a violent eruption of support for conflicting teams. Aside from the 
problems associated with simple fist-fights between fans, the real danger involves a possibility of those fights 
escalating and an ensuing stampede with multiple injuries. Olympic officials say that they have most areas of the 
venues under closed circuit television surveillance and can move rapidly to stop any fights, but experts point out 
that crowds can quickly develop a mind of their own. Rioting and stampede incidents in England, Ireland, 
Germany, Italy, Brazil, and a number of other countries have demonstrated the volatility and potential ferocity of 
soccer crowds. Consideration of a safe and rapid evacuation of the various venues must be given serious 
consideration. </p>
<p><strong>&lt;4&gt; Terrorism/Politically Inspired Violence </strong></p>
<p>The Olympic games provide a unique opportunity for terrorists of every kind, from all around the world. No 
other international event receives the press coverage from more than 150 countries or general attention that is 
afforded the Olympics. It is also significant that few other events gather as many important people from as many 
countries, with as many potential enemies. According to Staten, current circumstances would indicate that the 
1996 Atlanta Olympics are facing a &quot;multi-dimensional&quot; threat of both domestic and international terrorist attack. </p>
<p>Since the 1972 Palestinian &quot;Black September&quot; attack on Israeli athletes, Olympic officials have been aware of 
this threat and have spent massive amounts of time and money to counter the insurgents and assassins. In large 
part, they have been very effective and have thwarted numerous attempts by any number of terrorist 
organizations to wreck havoc on the games. 1996 is no different, and Olympic security planners say that they 
have made &quot;unprecedented&quot; preparations for this latest international gathering. </p>
<p>More than 20,000 military and law enforcement personnel are said to be assigned to monitor security measures. 
Special teams of local, state, and federal officers have been training and attending periodic briefings on issues 
relating to the games. SWAT, Hostage Rescue, Chemical/Biological/Nuclear materials, and crowd control 
issues are being given special consideration by the planning staff. As many as 5,000 volunteer (unarmed) 
security personnel, many of them off-duty police officers, are also expected to participate. Yet, despite the best 
efforts of Olympic security planners, the possibility still exists for an horrendous act by a fanatic with a religious, 
political, or ideological grudge to bear. </p>
<p>Extra danger exists at out-lying venues, which are more remote, and where security measures may not be as 
extensive. Additionally, it should be noted that striking anywhere in the vicinity of Atlanta or the games will draw 
the same amount of publicity, desired by fanatics. Therefore, it is possible that terrorists will strike another &quot;soft 
target&quot; that is not so extensively protected by the Olympic staff. Or, transportation systems, of all kinds, could 
also a major target of opportunity. One potential scenario even finds a car bombing(s) or hostage incident(s) in 
another part of the USA, hoping to draw essential FBI and ATF personnel away from the Olympics, prior to an 
attack there. All in all, there are some extremely dedicated people working very hard to prevent any possible 
occurrence that might disrupt the games; most terrorist experts agree, however, that even these efforts may not 
be able to stop a purposeful suicide bomber. </p>
<p><strong>&lt;5&gt; Chemical/Biological/Nuclear (CBN) Threats </strong></p>
<p>Of special concern to Olympic security officials is the possibility of the use of &quot;weapons of mass destruction.&quot; 
Ever since the Aum Shinrikyo cult incidents in Tokyo, Yokohama, and other locations in Japan, emergency 
planners have feared that chemical or biological weapons would be used by terrorists against civilian 
populations. Nothing could be a more tempting target than an Olympic venue, where 50,000 people could be 
killed or injured in a single strike...and it would covered &quot;live&quot; by literally hundreds of world-wide television and 
radio networks. </p>
<p>One scenario that could be pause for concern is a simple but yet effective dispersal of a chemical or biological 
agent. Using a helicopter or crop dusting plane, disguised in a variety of ways, a dedicated terrorist could simply 
fly over the various Olympic sites and systematically drop any number of toxic agents on unsuspecting crowds. 
While Olympic planners have undoubtedly thought of this concept and restricted the airspace surrounding the 
venues, an anticipated large number of media, emergency and other aircraft could make identification of 
potential foe difficult. </p>
<p>Officials say that the federal NEST (Nuclear Emergency Search Team) and several U.S. Army 
Chemical/Biological detection, decontamination and treatment teams are either on-site or on 24 hour call to 
respond to CBN emergencies on or near the Olympic sites. Several drill scenarios have reportedly been 
conducted in regard to the CBN threat and federal officials tell ENN that they are prepared for such an 
eventuality. </p>
<p>Thousands of local, state, federal and international Olympic officials have been working for many months to 
ensure that the 1996 Centennial Olympic games are safe, sane, and secure. Bill Rathburn, Olympic Security 
Chief and former head of the 1992 Olympic security effort in Los Angeles, has been quoted; &quot;Atlanta will be the 
safest place in America during the Olympic games...everything humanly possible will be done to safeguard both 
the athletes and the public.&quot; ERRI analysts and consultants say that it is their most fervent hope that Mr. 
Rathburn is right, and that the &quot;bad guys&quot; don't choose Atlanta as the site of their next atrocity. </p>

<font size=5><strong>Engine Explodes; Two Dead, 7 Injured</font></strong><br>
<br>
PENSACOLA, FLORIDA (ENN) - An engine on a Delta Airlines MD-88 exploded during takeoff on 
Saturday afternoon killing two passengers. Seven other people were injured as the plane was being evacuated. 
A Delta Airlines spokesman said that the left engine of the two-engine plane failed during the takeoff at 
Pensacola Regional Airport. It was reported that the dead victims were a mother and her 12-year-old son. The 
Delta spokesman said they were killed when &quot;parts of the engine penetrated the cabin.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Escambia County Emergency Medical Services director said that the dead victims suffered &quot;major trauma.&quot;<br>
<br>
Delta Flight 1288 was attempting to takeoff for Atlanta at the time of the incident with 147 souls on board. A 
spokesperson for the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said that the plane was about 1,500 feet down the 
runway when it stopped. The plane came to a halt on the runway and emergency slides were immediately used 
to evacuate passengers.<br>
<br>
The Delta spokesman said, &quot;It experienced a failure of the left engine at the start of the roll period in take off 
from Pensacola, Florida, at approximately 2:20 p.m. CDT.&quot;<br>
<br>
One passenger said that the engine exploded just seconds after the pilot applied full power to begin the takeoff. 
The passenger said, &quot;As soon as he hit the gas, the left engine blew. Shrapnel went flying into the back end of 
the airplane.&quot;<br></p>

<font size=5><strong>One Dead and 6 Hurt in Queens Fire; Deadly B-B-Q</strong></font><br>
<br>
NEW YORK CITY (ENN) - A fire sparked by hot coals in a barbecue grill sitting in the vestibule of a Queens 
home on Saturday morning killed a 63-year-old woman and injured six other people, four of them critically. 
Firefighters reportedly made two dramatic rescues and three children and one adult were transported to a 
Manhattan burn hospital.<br>
<br>
The blaze started at about 0600 EDT in a 2-story brick dwelling located at 123-18 Hillside Avenue. The 
FDNY arrived within four minutes of the first call and found an 8-year-old female badly burned and 
disorientated in front of the house. The 37-year-old father of the girl staggered next from the home, his clothes 
nearly burned from his body. The mother of the child and tenant in the basement suffered only minor injuries.<br>
<br>
As EMS personnel were tending to the father and girl, firefighters climbed to the second floor and rescued two 
girls, aged 5 and 7. Both girls were unconscious as they were pulled out of the burning building. Rescuers were 
unable to reach the girls' grandmother in time. She was killed by the quick-moving fire in her second floor 
bedroom. FDNY Lt. Jim Graney of Engine Company 298 said, &quot;Her body was completely burned.&quot;<br>
<br>
The blaze is still under investigation, but Fire Marshals believe that the fire was ignited by coals in a barbeque 
grill. Authorities said the family had doused the highly combustible cooking coals with water and brought the grill 
inside of the house for the night.<br></p>

<br>
<font size=5><strong>Gas Explosion Blamed for 12 Injuries; Coney Island</strong></font><br>
<br>
NEW YORK CITY (ENN) - A gas explosion triggered dozens of fires in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn 
on Saturday. At least 12 people were injured, six of them seriously. The explosion happened at about 1530 
EDT, near the intersection of Stillwell Avenue and Neptune Avenue, when a private contractor trying to repair a 
damaged water main accidently cracked a gas main, causing the street to collapse. Flames from the ensuing fire 
shot as high as 15 feet into the air about two blocks from the famous Coney Island amusement park. Five hours 
after the explosion, the fire was still burning.<br>
<br>
A spokesman for the FDNY explained, &quot;Firefighters can't put the flames out because they have to allow the gas 
to burn off. If you put the flames out, the gas would build up in area basements and could cause a much more 
serious explosion.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ten of the injured victims were employees for Brooklyn Union Gas. Six of the more seriously injured victims 
suffered second- and third-degree burns. A spokesman for Brooklyn Union Gas said, &quot;It was one of the worst 
gas accidents&quot; he had ever seen in the last 25 years.<br></p>

<font size=5><strong>NYC Fire/Police Departments Battles Fireworks Injuries</strong></font><br>
By Paul Anderson, ENN Metro Correspondent<br>
<br>
NEW YORK CITY (ENN) - The July Fourth holiday is always the busiest day for New York City public 
safety agencies. This year was no exception. In a post-mortem to evaluate the response from the police, fire and 
EMS, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had to defend his statement of saying on Thursday night that this 
year's July Fourth Celebration was the safest &quot;in recorded history.&quot;<br>
<br>
The FDNY reported that they were actually busier this year than they were last year with emergency calls. 
Giuliani conceded, &quot;There were parts of the city where there were illegal fireworks, but those areas have been 
significantly reduced.&quot;<br>
<br>
The NYPD deployed officers to 13 targeted neighborhoods in a show of force to stop people from lighting 
anything from sparklers to high explosives.<br>
<br>
Despite the crackdown, Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen said that his department responded to 1,598 
emergency calls on Thursday. That was up from 1,562 calls in 1995. Von Essen could not explain the slight 
increase except by saying that &quot;it's always the busiest day of the year.&quot; The Fire Commissioner did say that there 
were fewer serious fires this year than there were last year.<br>
<br>
The Emergency Medical Service showed a 9 percent decrease this year over last year. They responded to 
3,197 calls on Thursday. In 1995, they had 3,500 calls. 38 people were transported with fireworks-related 
injuries. That was down from 50 in 1995.</p>

VENTURA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA (ENN) - About 100 firefighters with ten engine companies, three 
helicopters, three air tankers, three hand drews and two bulldozers battled a fast-moving 375-acre brush fire 
near Ventura, California, on Saturday. The fire was located in the hills just north of the city. The blaze was 
supposed to be fully contained by Saturday night.<br>

<H2>THE DRAMATIC DROP IN CRIME IN NEW YORK CITY...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Crime Analyst
<P>

The New York City Police Department (NYPD) has been gaining
ground on an old nemisis in the past two years.  The nemisis
has been ... crime.  Crime and violence has been as familiar
to the "Big Apple" as the Empire State Building and the Yankees.
<P>

But since January of 1994, when current Police Commissioner
William Bratton took office, overall crime has dropped about 
27 percent in New York.  Homicides have declined by almost 40
percent. In one precinct alone, the 75th in Brooklyn, homicides dropped
by 63 percent in two years.  From 129 murders in 1994 to only
47 in 1995.
<P>

What is the reason for this dramatic drop in such a short period
of time?  Bratton is not shy about where he thinks the credit should 
go.  The Commissioner said, "It's not the economy, demographics or the
weather.  We are a results-oriented organization."
<P>

Jack Maple, Bratton's deputy commissioner on crime strategies says
that he thinks that smart, efficient policing is proving to have an
impact on the crime rate. But crime experts and criminologists, including those at ERRI, are
not totally convinced that the police are by themselves totally responsible 
for such a dramatic drop in crime as it is being reported in many of 
the major cities in the United States.
<P>

While criminologists do acknowledge that the NYPD's aggressive approach to crime
certainly does have "some" impact, they say that there is also evidence that 
the decline in crime, in at least some of the major cities, may be due to simple demographics.
<P>  

Points of note are, there has been a decline in the number of
younger males in what is considered to be the peak crime-committing
age group.  Many experts believe that crime will drammatically
rise, again, in a few years when the number of males in the
crime-committing age group rises.  Some criminologists even believe that 
the crime rate will rise to levels that have never been seen before 
in this country.
<P>

Some criminologists also believe that "turf battles" for the lucrative
crack cocaine market may have subsided.  After all of the dealers have
shot it out with each other, the survivors have become "major players"
who now just peacefully divide the turf. Rather than gunbattles, "corporate 
mergers" are occuring and "sales territories" are being assigned, rather than fought over.
<P>

The experts at ERRI believe that the biggest reason for the decline is
that repeat offenders are now just being locked up for longer periods
of time and not as many repeat offenders are on the street.  You 
could couple this point, with the fact that there are fewer males in the crime-
committing age group.
<P>

Criminolgists have been debating the reasons for the decline with
Police Commissioner Bratton for a while now.  Bratton even recently
debated the subject at the convention of the American Society of
Criminology that was held in Boston.  Bratton argued that police can
make a difference if they intelligently analyze crime patterns and
target known "hot spots" of criminal activity.
<P>

Analyzing crime patterns and deploying forces to offset crimes is
nothing new to police work.  Bratton said that he and Maple plan
their strategies like military campaigns.  The Commissioner added
that for too long, police have believed that crime was beyond their
control.  Officers could only race from one call to another.  In
the past little time and effort was set aside for strategy or
analysis.  Today, Bratton and Maple say, that is no longer an 
acceptable response to the crime problem.
<P>

Deputy Commissioner Maple said, "Our shareholders are the people of
this city.  They invest $2.7 billion a year for police protection.
We have to deliver less victims." If anything, Bratton's and Maple's 
approach and dedication to trying to solve the problem should be applauded.  The only thing that is
being debated is whether or not the strategies and tactics, themselves,
are responsible for the drop in crime. At NYPD headquarters, Maple and Bratton plot their strategies in the
"War Room."  Maple said, "I honestly believe that if we are relentless,
we can change behavior."
<P>

Some of the tactics that the NYPD now uses is cracking down on
seemingly petty things.  They now crack down on public drinking,
loud music in public, street prostitution, and people who demand
payment if they go up to a car in traffic and clean the windows, 
known as "squeegee pests."  When Bratton came to office, officers
were ordered to issue summons for these petty offenses.  What that
did was give officers legal justification to check for outstanding
arrest warrants on the offenders.  They were also allowed to
conduct a search.
<P>

It most probably will take a number of years to prove who is right 
in this debate of who and what is responsbile for the drop in crime.
Aggressive police strategies or just "shifting" demographics?

<H3>American Flt. 965 Crashes, 160 Feared Dead</H3>
By: Clark Staten, Exec. Editor
<P>
Chicago, IL., December 21, 1995 --In what is being described as
the worst air disaster of 1995, 160 people are feared dead in
the crash of an American Airlines Boeing 757 near Buga,
Columbia. Flight 965, from Miami, FL, reportedly dropped off
radar scopes shortly before it's scheduled arrival at the Cali
airport. Conflicting reports have been received about whether or
not the pilot of the ill-fated flight was able to send a
distress message prior to the crash, but a preponderance of the
preliminary evidence would suggest that he was unable to do so.
The crash, which occurred at approximately 21:30EST 02:30GMT),
was reportedly already three hours behind schedule due to
connecting flight delays into Miami.
<P>

The crash site was located in a rugged section of the San Jose
mountains, about 40 miles from Cali, Columbia. Darkness, the
remote location, and fear of leftist guerrillas that frequent
that area, reportedly delayed rescue efforts for some period of
time. Helicopters and tracked or four-wheel drive vehicles were
unable to reach the site until early Thursday morning.
Unconfirmed reports suggest, upon their arrival, that rescuers
may have found at least four (4) survivors at the crash site. 
Early reports from rescuers and media personnel, arriving at the
scene describe it as "gruesome"; with blood, body parts,
baggage, and sections of the plane strewn over a large area. The
largest part of the plane, that has been found, is described by
witnesses as being less than "two meters in length".
<P>

 The cause of the crash remains under investigation, and
speculation continues about the possibility of it being
sabotaged or having exploded prior to the fatal crash.
Eyewitnesses from the area surrounding the crash site reported
that they saw "flames and smoke" coming from the plane prior to
it plummeting into the mountainside. Several others also
described hearing an explosion or explosions and seeing a
"bright flash". Others said that the plane's engines had an
"unusual sound" just moments before it crashed.
<P> 

In a related story, The Miami Herald and at least one other
newspaper had reportedly received a fax on Monday (12/18/95),
threatening American-based air carriers in regard to flights
into Columbia and at least one other South American country. FAA
and federal law enforcement officials say that they can not, at
this time, draw a direct connection between the threatening
letters and Wednesday's crash, but that "all possible avenues of
investigation" are being explored. Reportedly, a special team of
FBI forensic experts, four (4) experts from the National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and three (3) officials from
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) are enroute to Cali
and scheduled to arrive there late Thursday.
<P>

ERRI (Emergency Response & Research Institute) analysts say that
there are far more questions than answers at this point in the
investigation, but that concerns are being raised about the fact
that this crash occurred within hours of the anniversary of the
deadly Lockerbie, Scotland crash of Pan Am Flight 103, that took
the lives of 270 people. Additionally, they point to much recent
U.S. pressure on the Columbia government and drug cartels and
another as yet unresolved plane crash that occurred in Columbia
in January of 1995.  Lastly, according to at least one expert,
some of the facts just aren't consistent with a simple accident.
The plane was relatively new, reportedly well maintained, and
flown by experienced American pilots, with numerous trips into
the Cali airport.
<P>

While both U.S. and Colombian aviation officials emphasize the
fact that they have no specific reason at this time, to suspect
sabotage or terrorism, an intensive investigation will
eventually ascertain the cause of the tragedy. In the words of
NTSB spokesperson Pat Cariseo, "There is no way we can speculate
on the cause of the accident. It's way too early."

<H2>Atlanta Police Department; Undermanned, Underpaid, and Under Fire</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

From time-to-time, this publication tries to take a candid look at problems that emergency agencies appear to be having.  Recently, it has been reported that the Atlanta Police Department has been battered by one crisis after another.  Many of the problems have become more evident since the fall of 1995, when a corruption scandel hit the department.
<P>

Several Atlanta Police officers were interviewed and they had plenty to say.  Officers on the street say that morale is very low and their superiors haven't even begun to repair the damage done by recent allegations and press reports. Since morale is so low, officers say that it is becoming more and more difficult to police the city on a daily basis.
<P>

Chip Warren is the national vice president of the International Brotherhood of Police Officers and is a former Atlanta Police officer.  Warren related, "On a scale of one to ten, morale is a minus one.  In the sixteen years I've been here, I've never seen it worse.  It's pretty much all they can do right now to go on a call."
<P>

In the first quarter of 1996, overall crime in Atlanta has risen by nine percent.  One 15-year veteran officer said, "More street violence makes it harder for us to do our job. There's no fear of police anymore ... no respect.  The whole time you have to watch out for the 15-year-old who will stick a knife in your back or open you up with an Uzi.  And if anything happens, you can just about be guaranteed that the city won't back you up."
<P>

Many officers blame the morale problem on the current city administration and especially are upset about "political meddling" by Mayor Bill Campbell and his administration. Chip Warren blames many of the problems with the police department on an "extreme" lack of leadership.
<P>

According to Warren, Police Chief Beverly Harvard "has not been allowed to run the police department.  The mayor and his office need to keep their noses out of running the police department and start fighting for funding this department.  Nobody has talked to these officers and asked, 'What do you think we could do to reduce crime?'  Nobody."
<P>

Other issues have also contributed to low morale. They  include a freezing of pay raises this year.  Overtime pay has also been reduced. And, in December, there was an incident at a downtown Atlanta motorcycle shop where an unarmed customer was shot and killed by an officer's ricocheting bullet.  The public in Atlanta was said to have been outraged.
Shortly thereafter, State of Georgia Attorney General Michael Bowers publicly said that the streets of Atlanta were more dangerous than Sarajevo, Bosnia.
<P>
To make matters worse, early this month, a DeKalb County grand jury reportedly charged that Atlanta Police officers often bring "sloppy evidence" to court when seeking criminal indictments. None of these reports are good for the morale of the department and officers say that feel like they're being treated like "punching bags."
<P>

Another big problem is that the department is allegedly very under-manned. Manpower is said to be at an all-time low with more than 200 vacancies for sworn personnel available.  The department can't seem to hire and train new officers fast enough to fill the vacancies. 80 of the most experienced members of the department took early retirement in 1994.  Warren said, "And other officers are still quitting."
<P>

Wayne Mock now runs a private security company and is a former high-ranking member of the Atlanta Police Department.  He said that the manpower shortage is serious.  Mock said, "The officers out there are doing a good job ... they're working.  But they're having to move them around so much to do so many things ... it's getting critical."
<P>
From what is being described by officers and able observers-- there certainly seems to be a problem in the Atlanta Police Department.  Knowledgable insiders tell ENN, however, that it's unlikely that things will get any better until there's an another election and a new city administration.

<H2>LITTLE CHANGE EXPECTED AFTER ARREST OF DRUG KINGPIN...
</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Managing Editor
<P>

After the January 14th arrest of drug kingpin Juan Garcia Abrego,
experts say that the flow of cocaine into the United States may
only slow down for a short while.  But Abrego's drug rivals will battle
over his turf and then pick up the slack.  Overall, the recent 
arrest of Abrego will have little, if any, long-term effect.
<P>

Experts who keep an eye on the big drug cartels said that prior
to his arrest, Abrego's power had waned a little bit.  With him
gone and in prison in the United States, a power struggle will
develop to see who will gain control of the multi-million dollar
business.
<P>

Phil Jordan is a retired United States Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) agent in Dallas, Texas.  Jordan helped put together the case
that indicted Abrego in the early 1990's.  Jordan said, "A lot of
people will struggle to get Garcia Abrego's business.  But it will
take them years to amass the kind of power and fortune he enjoyed.
He was one of the big guys."
<P>

Because of recent blows that have been brought against the infamous
Colombia Cali cartel, Mexican drug smugglers have emerged as a
powerful force in the world drug market.  It is said that the 
Mexicans are now responsible for at least 75 percent of all the
cocaine that is smuggled into the United States.
<P>

With the arrest of Abrego, Mexico hopes to gain recertification in
March from the United States in the war on drugs.  The United States
State Department and Congress rate countries each year for their
cooperation.  Congress then awards U.S. aid accordingly, based upon
a country's rating.
<P>

The arrest of Abrego is seen as the most important drug arrest in
Mexico since the arrest of drug kingpin Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo,
who was called the "Godfather of Mexican Drug Trafficking", in 1989.
Experts said that even after Gallardo's arrest, it only put a small
dent in the drug smuggling from Mexico until rivals finished a
battle over his territory.  Within a few years, everything was back
to normal.  And experts say that the same thing will happen after
the arrest of Abrego.
<P>

Professor Peter Lupsha of the University of New Mexico studies the
illegal drug business.  Lupsha said, "Garcia Abrego's rivals are
celebrating."  According to the U of New Mexico professor, Amado
Carrillo Fuentes, who is the leader of the Juarez cartel and is
said to be the number one drug smuggler in Mexico, has the most to
gain with the arrest of Abrego.
<P>

Fuentes is known as "The Lord of the Skies."  This is because his
cartel often uses old passenger jets to smuggle the Colombian
cocaine into Mexico.  Fuentes has risen to power very quickly
and is said to have learned a lot from the Cali cartel.
<P>

Lupsha said, "Nothing changes for drug trafficking.  The arrest of
Juan Garcia Abrego is simply cleaning up on the last Mexican
administration and passing the baton.  The corruption and trafficking
will continue."

<B>**LEAD STORY**</B>
<P>
<HR>
Editor's Note: Ever since Monday, 8 April 1996, when ENN
reported that Japanese authorities had arrested a man for
smuggling dangerous chemicals that could be used to make 
the nerve gas sarin to North Korea (ENN2-099), analysts
at ERRI have been saying, "Something is not right with
this story."
<P>

It now appears that other analysts have been saying the
same thing.  We offer the following theory that was
written by Ronald W. Lewis, who is the Chief Military
Analyst with The Intelligyst Group.  We thank The
Intelligyst Group for allowing us to republish this paper.
<P>
We offer this only as a theory, but many of the points offered
seem to make more sense than what has been offered, so far, by
press reports or other authorities.  ERRI analysts believe this to be a
very workable theory.  Above everything else, ERRI analysts
believe that the North Koreans may be playing a very
dangerous game and ERRI offers a warning to the South Koreans
and the Japanese about the possibility of a forthcoming chemical attack.

<H2>POSSIBLE NORTH KOREAN BEGINNING STRATEGY...</H2>
By Ronald W. Lewis
<BR>
Chief Military Analyst
<BR>
The Intelligyst Group
<P>

On Monday, April 8, Japanese authorities arrested a shipping
clerk,  an ethnic Korean, in Kobe, Japan.  This individual
"admitted" to sending batches of chemicals which are
ingredients of the nerve agent sarin to North Korea.  As many
of you may recall, sarin was the nerve agent employed in the
March 20, 1995 Tokyo subway gas attack.   Since North Korea
has more than enough production capacity for sarin, it is highly
unlikely that this individual was shipping sarin component
chemicals TO North Korea but was rather, in all likelihood,
caught with chemicals he had received FROM North Korea.
<P>

It has been a longstanding contention of this analyst that
North Korea--and possibly China--was behind the gas attacks
in Japan, as a method of coercing the Japanese and
blackmailing them into not supporting US forces in time of war
with North Korea or China.  The continuing episodes of gas
attacks and incidents in Japan since then have all occurred on
or about periods of heightened tension over the DMZ or Taiwan.
<P>

As tensions continue to mount in North Korea, it occurs to this
analyst that the perfect way in which to launch an invasion of
South Korea is to set off gas attacks in Seoul and other South
Korean cities, much as was done in Tokyo last March.
<P>

If this should occur, morale at the front lines would probably
crumble as soldiers desert to protect and check on the welfare
of their families.  If the attacks are relatively small in scope,
with a relatively low body count, a terrified public would likely
withdraw support any military action, fearing more such attacks.
<P>

This was one reason the attacks in Japan were designed to kill
only small numbers of people when, instead, they could have
annihilated very large numbers.  Large casualty counts demand
swift retaliation, to bring the fight home to the enemy before he
can kill more of your own people.  Small numbers of casualties
usually result in "pay-offs" of the victims' families and a flurry of
diplomatic deal-making to prevent further attacks.  This happened
in Japan.  North Korea might try it with the South.
<P>

However, it is also possible that the South would retaliate
severely, prompting the need for large chemical attacks by the
North, or the North may just simply go all-out, hoping that a
large assault in the initial stages will destroy South Korean and
US resolve to fight.
<P>

Another option would be to set off a new series of limited
attacks in Japan, forcing them to shut down US bases and
ports or face all-out chemical assault.  North Korea DID
threaten Japan with chemical attacks in 1994.
<P>

The inability of US aircraft and US ships in Japan to deploy
would be a huge crisis during a war in Korea.  If this is
successful, it is likely that North Korea will then attempt a
land invasion with conventional weapons would soon follow.
If the North Koreans were to prove successful without the need
for direct Chinese intervention, as in November 1950, China
would probably then commit other forces to a takeover of
Taiwan.
<P>

The key is that the Japanese attacks have already demonstrated
that a few small bags of a nerve agent, employed in the right
environment, can cause massive chaos.  It is well established
that North Korean agents are in South Korea.  In fact, it was
only a few months ago that 20,000 South Korean troops and
police conducted a manhunt for a few infiltrators who attempted
to extract a long-time mole whom had been planted there years
ago.  Airports, subways and other areas critical to national
defense or filled with large numbers of people are likely targets
if such deep-cover agents wished to wreak the most havoc.
<P>

Finally, it should be noted that within a day after the
March 20, 1995 Tokyo attack, office workers in a Seoul
office building of an American insurance company were
overcome by mysterious fumes.  The rescue workers who
responded were equipped with chemical warfare protective
garments, not something you normally wear when checking
out a supposed air conditioning coolant leak. 
<P> 

Later in the
summer of 1995, the LA TIMES reported that Disneyland
was an intended target of cult members intending to strike
with sarin.  The Seoul incident may have been a test but it,
along with the planned assault on Disneyland, may have been
a signal to the US, South Korean and Japanese governments.
It would be wise for South Korean security agents to increase
their surveillance of the types of areas where sarin--and the
other agents employed in Japan--were placed.

<p><font size=5><strong>THE THREAT OF CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ATTACK</strong></font> ...<br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor, Clark Staten, Analyst<br>
<IMG SRC="/nbc-h2o.gif" align=left><br>
The United States intelligence community is studying the threat of chemical and biological terrorist attacks against civilian 
targets. It is hoped that a plan can be devised to help protect soft targets such as subway systems and airports. As 
reported some months ago in this publication, the U.S. Congress is planning to make military expertise available to cities 
across the U.S. to help mitigate such an attack that until not to long ago was &quot;unthinkable.&quot;<br>
<br>
Georgia Senator Sam Nunn said in March of this year, that the United States had a &quot;remarkable lack of domestic 
preparedness&quot; to deal with such situations. The senator has warned many times, &quot;An attack of this kind is not a question of 
'if' but 'when.'&quot; Similar warnings have been offered in analysis' offered by the Emergency Response &amp; Research Institute 
since 1987.<br>
<br>
Central Intelligence Agency Director John Deutch warned that the threat of chemical and/or biological attack in the U.S. is 
&quot;the most urgent, long-term pressing intelligence challenge we face. The materials and expertise necessary to build chemical 
and biological weapons are more readily available today than ever before.&quot;<br>
<br>
The United States Defense Intelligence Agency has said that there is a proliferation of interest in biological weapons in the 
Third World. Can one imagine these weapons in the hands of the leaders of countries such as Burundi, Sudan, or Somalia? 
Actually, Somalia does not even have a working government. If these weapons were available there -- criminal gangs, 
really, would be in control of them.<br>
<br>
Again, as in nuclear issues, the expertise that is being made available to rogue nations such as Iran, Libya and Syria is 
coming from Russia. If Russia is unwilling or unable to pay scientists for their expertise -- rogue nations are able and willing. 
Sadly, there is some evidence that at least some of the scientists from the former Soviet Union may have defected and now 
work for hostile nation-states or groups in the Mid-East.<br>
<br>
Through the years of the Cold War, planning in the U.S. to deal with a possible nuclear attack had been extensive. But the 
internation threat of terrorist use of chemical and/or biological attack is still relatively new and there is reportedly no real 
specific intelligence or operational framework in place to deal with these threats.<br>
<br>
There is said to be at least two plans, that should a chemical attack strike in say, New York City, special U.S. troops and 
equipment would be dispatched to assist local officials. In Washington, DC, and soon in the Los Angeles basin, a special 
&quot;Chemical/Biological Medical Strike Teams&quot; are being formulated to help treat toxically exposed patients. A special 
training initative may soon be proposed that would facilitate cross-training between military chemical/biological specialists 
and their civilian counter-parts in emergency service agencies.<br>
<br>
The United States does have a number of specialized units that are capable of dealing with such unconventional attacks. 
Each military service: the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force each have specially trained teams. The U.S. 
Department of Energy, which has NEST (Nuclear Emergency Search Team) and its own SWAT teams, also has a team to 
deal with chemical/biological incidents. The coordination of any relief and mitigation efforts in the event of a Chem/Bio 
attack will be made through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, with cooperation of the Department of Defense. <br>
<br>
And, after such an attack, employing weapons of mass destruction, the U.S. apparently will spend little time &quot;messing 
around&quot; with finding those who was responsible. As soon as the perpetrators could be identified and targeted, they will 
have the Joint Special Operations Command; with SFOD-D Delta Force, Marine Force Recon, and Navy Seal Teams, to 
deal with. As the president has been quoted as saying, the reaction would would probably be &quot;swift and severe.&quot;<br>
<br>
A scary thought is that it was recently reported by Janes Defense weekly that the U.S. Secret Service considers the 
President as a possible target for such a terrorist attack. This issue and threat was been the topic of discussion amongst the 
intelligence community and the U.S. Army, which has a Chemical/Biological Anti-Terrorism Team. Though the information 
would be considered classified, that team most certainly is in Chicago this week. That security planners are even thinking of 
such threats to the President indicates the concern that the U.S. has about the possibility of such an attack.<br>
<br>
What would happen if terrorists conducted a chemical attack on Denver? Which happens to be an upcoming site for a 
future G-7 industrialized nations summit. The Technical Escort Unit, which is based in Maryland, is able to respond on 
short notice and to mitigate such incidents. The aforementioned Chemical/ Biological Anti-Terrorism Team would also 
respond because they are considered to be the foremost experts in the technology that is used to protect people and 
neutralize the weapons.<br>
<br>
Of greatest concern, as always, is the rogue state of Iran. The Central Intelligence Agency claims that the outlaw state has 
several thousand tons of chemical agents. In a recent report to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the CIA said 
that Iran is capable of producing 1,000 tons of chemical agents every year. Iran is believed to have stockpiles of such 
chemicals as nerve and blister agents, cyanide, phosgene and mustard gases.<br>
<br>
In the future, it is going to be quite a challenge to attempt to keep these types of weapons of mass destruction out of the 
hands of fanatical regimes and thugs that seem to be breeding all around the world. As the last remaining superpower, the 
United States will, unfortunately, find itself on the front line dealing with this threat.<br>

<H3>Paramedics due thousands in back-pay; FSLA Ruling</H3>
<BR>
Chicago, IL, December 12, 1994 -- The U.S. Supreme court today
announced this morning that it would let stand a 7th Court of
Appeals ruling that EMTs and paramedics in Chicago must be paid
overtime for all hours over forty (40) worked in any given week.
The ruling is expected to have a dramatic effect on Emergency
Medical Service operation throughout the United States, as
cities and counties must now either pay overtime to EMTs or
Paramedics or hire enough personnel to reduce their hours worked
to forty (40).
<P> 

The case, Chicago v. Alex 94-704, had focused on the issue of
whether or not EMS personnel were exempted under the provisions
of the Fair Labor Standards Practices Act (FSLA). Firefighters
and Law Enforcement officers had been specifically exempted from
traditional working hours provisions since 1974, but the suit
challenged the concept of EMS personnel working in this "exempt
environment" without the benefit of "cross-training" or actual
participation in fire suppression or law enforcement activities.
<P>
 
Previously, firefighters  were allowed to work a total of 136
hours in an 18 day work cycle by federal exemption.  Chicago
firefighters and paramedics were working a 24 hours on and 48
hours off cycle with an extra day off after every fourth shift. 
Beginning Jan. 1st, 1995, paramedics in Chicago are reportedly
to begin to work a 24 hours on and 72 hours off shift, in order
to reduce the actual number of hours worked.  There is some
dispute among legal experts as to why EMS workers were not
included in the original exemptions for fire and police
personnel.  Some say it was lobbying by fire and police chiefs
that excluded the EMS exemption, others say that it was
influenced by the powerful private ambulance industry.
<P>

The lawsuit noted that paramedics in Chicago do not actually
engage in fire suppression activities, even though they have
made numerous requests to both the city and their union to
become "cross-trained", and do just that.  Cross training
programs would have allowed them to participate in firefighting
duties a percentage of the time, and when necessary, to enter
burning structures to affect rescues and treat the sick and
injured.
<P> 

Several legal experts say that if paramedics had been
cross-trained in the past, that they would have probably
qualified for exemption under FSLA provisions. A similar
cross-training program has been instituted in Los Angeles and
several other cities, and upheld by various courts.  Most
Chicago suburbs only hire cross-trained Fire/EMS personnel.
<P> 

According to the Associated Press, a "friend of the court" brief
was filed by the National League of Cities, The National
Association of Counties, and other government groups, in an
attempt to persuade the Supreme Court that paying paramedics
overtime for all hours worked over forty would be "costly,
disruptive, and intrusive".  The brief also reportedly said
that, "many governments will have to hire, train, and pay
additional employees...or pay their Emergency Medical Services
workers more in the future...either choice will be costly".
<P>

According to EMS experts, the effect of the ruling could mean
that EMTs and Paramedics, in many communities, could file for
back-pay amounting to tens of thousands of dollars, and that
they would receive ongoing overtime payments for all current or
future hours worked in excess of forty (40).  One veteran
Chicago EMS analyst said that the solution to the costly problem
is rooted in a "tradition" of treating paramedics unequally, in
some fire and police departments.
<P> 

He said that the original lawsuits could probably have been 
prevented had equity in pay and benefits been achieved in years 
past. Unfortunately, in all too many departments, EMTs and paramedics 
were treated as "second class citizens" and cities and counties 
attempted to pay them less than their counter-parts in police and fire
departments.  A purposely unidentified Chicago paramedic said;
"This ruling validates the fact that the men and women that work
in EMS are just as valuable as everyone else that responds to
emergencies."

A radical change is occurring within the world. It is happening
outside the recognition of most people. This change involves
information, communication, and power. It also involves a
transition of power from the "traditional bureaucracies" into an
advanced organizational structure. So as to gain a better
comprehension of these ideas, it is necessary to understand the
form of today's typical bureaucracy.  By review and learning
from the past and present, it becomes possible to understand the
future.
<P>


Alvin Toffler, in his insightful examination of these issues
entitled "Powershift",  points out that the world has undergone
a gradual transformation from an agrarian (farm based) society,
into a pre-industrial (small business) civilization, to a
"Smoke-Stack" (factory assembly line) mentality, and finally is
becoming a primarily service based economy.  During this
transition, Toffler says that the power of information has
increased proportionally with the advances of technology. 
Toffler's main hypothesis is that there are three main sources
of "power" . . .
<P>

<UL>
<LI>1. Violence - the least versatile source of power,
can only be used to punish those who            
disagree with the source of "power". It can also be used a
coercive threat, if fear can be created. Most frequently used 
in the early stages or defense of establishing a hierarchical system.
<P>

<LI>2. Wealth - that can be used to punish or reward;
is more powerful than violence. In sufficient quantities, it 
can sometimes be converted into violence or knowledge. 
Most people recognize the power of money, few understand it's possible
magnification by knowledge.
<P>
<LI>3. Knowledge - the most versatile and basic, the
highest quality power; can avert the need to use violence
or wealth by forewarning or planning. Maximizes resources by 		
accumulating them faster and managing them in a timely and
effective manner. Often can be used to persuade others
to act in a needed way by convincing them that it is in         
their own best interest.
</UL>
<P>

Many existing organization structures can be shown to use a
combination of these "power tools" to achieve management of
their resources and personnel.  Most private and government
bureaucracies have evolved from a "smoke stack" management style
that assured that all tasks were broken down into the smallest
possible pieces (compartmentalization) and that workers did not
have the "mentality" to discuss, learn, plan, or organize their
work.
<P>
These "traditional" organizations placed various layers of
management personnel to oversee the operations of the small
pieces and to insure cooperation between the "compartments".
Ideas, information, benefits, motivation, higher pay, and
organizational direction flowed only from the higher levels of
management to the "lower-level worker drones" at the bottom of
the organizational chart.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>The Assembly Line Approach</H4>
<P>
A "production-line" or "piece-work approach" was shown to
increase production and it led to systems to mass-produce goods
and services.  In turn, this abundance of production increased
the profitability of a business and propagated further
utilization in this management style. "Interchangability" of
both parts and employees was thought to be the answer to
increased productivity. In fact, this idea did work in many
emerging industries and professions.
<P>
Simply put, more of anything was thought to be better.  The
quality and durability of a product was not considered as
significant as the quantity produced. It was believed that
production and profits could be vastly increased by simply
turning up the "speed of the assembly line".  For several
decades, the concept and process seemed to work.
<P>
Bureaucracies came into being to give some finite structure and
order to the increasing number of vice-presidents, managers,
sub-managers, supervisors, and job bosses; who were nominally
"in charge" of all of the assembly lines and "compartments" that
had been created.  At the historical time of their creation,
these varying levels of management were probably relevant to the
general function of a company or government agency.  It was a
time of excess, a time when working conditions and employee
safety were disregarded in favor of expediency and profits. 
Supervisors were allowed a tyrannical approach to management.
More and larger departments were added as capacity for
production increased. It was also a time that led to the
inception of employee unions and collective bargaining.
<P>
Many bureaucracies became further controlled, organized, and
some would say burdened, by adding additional layers of
management.  These additional managers were deemed justified to
insure that the "organized (unionized) workers" were performing
as expected.  Other layers of management were added to
counteract or specialize in areas that were not constrained by
the traditional organizational structures or union regulation.
Yet other layers of management were added to "reward" those
thought to be loyal, subservient, and compliant with the
existing management structure.  Indeed, with "mass production"
came specialization of management.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>"CUBBYHOLES" and "CHANNELS"</H4>
<P>
Toffler accurately describes the two main features of power
within bureaucracies as being "cubbyholes" and "channels".
According to Toffler, specialized executives control
"cubbyholes". "Cubbyholes" are places where we group people,
information, resources, records, and functions.  "Cubbyholes"
are places that fit neatly on organizational charts and can
hypothetically be easily managed.  Senior managers and
executives can be made aware that "so and so" problem should be
solved by "so and so section/bureau/division/area", because that
is "their bailiwick" (area of responsibility). Several
"cubbyholes" may report to a single manager, although
"cubbyholes" that are somehow perceived as being more important
will probably have their own manager.
<P>
"Channels", on the other hand, are the way that information,
motivation, and direction get from one place in the organization
to another.  Managers gain their power by controlling and
filtering any flow of information, either "up or down" the
tightly structured chain of command.  By influencing this flow
of information or knowledge, managers are perceived as powerful
or lacking power.  Without an effective flow of "wisdom" from
one place in an organization, to another; duplicity,
inefficiency, and disorganization are likely to result. Some
managers are firm believers in a very strict interpretation of a
formal "Chain of Command" structure and procedure . . .for this
very reason.
<P>
<HR>

<H4>TECHNOLOGY FOR CHANGE</H4>
<P>

Until the arrival of computers and their almost unlimited power
to categorize, organize, store and analyze information, the
"cubbyhole and channel" approach seemed the best way to control
and manage the varied and many functions within a growing
business.  After all, many said, the system could be endlessly
expanded to fit the needs of the organization by adding more
cubbyholes and selecting managers to communicate between them.
The "folly" of this approach, however, has finally begun to
become known.
<P>
As both government and private industries have recently come to
realize, the diversification and complexity of the world society
is causing dramatic changes at such a rapid rate that the
"cubbyhole and channel" approach of the past is not adequate to
the task of managing the vast amounts of data, information, and
analysis that are necessary to function.
<P>
Some astute analysts have even suggested that this "speedup" in
the flow of change makes an organization's data, skills, and
knowledge extremely fragile.  Everything upon which decisions
are being made is in a constant state of decay, disintegration,
and regeneration.  This constant state of "flux" causes some
cubbyholes to be overflowing with new ideas, information and
concepts; still others have become practically empty and
useless, as their expertise and information sinks into
obsolescence.
<P>
As the abilities of government agencies, companies and the
consumer to communicate and interact continue to improve, the
process of change will continue to accelerate. The public's
perception of any organization today is shaped by the
information about it that is disseminated by the mass media and
a rapidly expanding ability of common citizens to personally
gather data.  Often, what starts out to be a relatively benign
remark or act may have tremendous impact on a company,
government, or entire country . . . when it is amplified by
computer, satellite, radio, and television communication. The
magnitude of this ability to rapidly alter the public perception
must change the way that organizations are managed.
<P>
<HR>

<H4>The Emergence of a Different Way of Doing Business</H4>
<P>
The most difficult problem of all . . . is how to change the
"cubbyhole" and "channel" mentality that has been described by
Toffler.  In a large number of companies, in the military, in
almost all government agencies, and in many other organizations,
the strict "Chain of Command" and "compartmentalization"
theories are firmly entrenched. To attempt to change the
bureaucracy is to diminish or change the essence and reality of
the POWER structure within those organizations.  That will
surely be resisted at almost every level of the bureaucracy,
largely due to the fact that it will cause a shifting of POWER
and it's inherent privileges.
<P>

A reshaping of power also changes those that wield it. Personnel
changes are as inevitable as the forces that will cause the
upheaval in the first place.  Those that are perceived as having
the necessary information, and know how to use it, will
undoubtedly profit from the emergence of change.
<P>

Senior management is rationally more interested in being able to
obtain the information that needs, when it needs it . . . than
where it comes from.  Some "links in the chain of command" are
very aware of their significance in the transference of
information and technical data. In the face of possible change,
they may withhold worthwhile facts from one manager, while
providing it to another, in hopes of furthering their importance
and security within the organization.
<P>
Managers who are not deemed to be desirable by the "specialist
compartments" may be bypassed in the movement and filtering of
information.  Senior executives that need research on a
particular topic may be given incomplete or incorrect
information, so as to discredit them or their plans for change. 
A "deathly" internal struggle is likely to occur in any
organization that strives to change the way they accumulate,
analyze, and distribute information or "knowledge".
<P>
Undoubtedly, as the quantity and quality of available
information increases, those that can most readily access and
utilize it will become more valuable to any organization. Those
with the communications and computer skills necessary to
implement a major "cultural" revolution within a company are
likely to be given additional responsibilities and rewards.  In
fact, in some companies and agencies, we have already seen an
appearance of a new class of employee called the "Management 
Information System" (or M.I.S.) specialists.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>The Secret Information Society</H4>
<P>
During the early days of computers, when computers were enormous
machines that filled entire rooms, an "elite" group of corporate
men and women began to emerge.  "Mainframe" computers were the
answer, or so they said. These "giant brains" were thought to be
able to bring control and order to the chaos that was the
rapidly growing and changing organization of the day. They could control
everything that happened in the company.  Of course, the only people that had sufficient knowledge to operate these gargantuan machines were the people making the recommendations, but that didn't seem to matter to senior management
because it was consistent with the idea of "compartmentalizing" of specialist
tasks.
<P>

Managers and executives of every rank were called upon to go to
the M.I.S. specialists ("data gurus") to obtain or analyze information 
that could be helpful in the furtherance of sectional, department, or
organizational goals.  Resource allocation, promotions,
production strategies, and planning processes were all
determined by M.I.S. (Management Information Systems)
professionals, who may have had little working knowledge of the
task at hand . . . but knew, well, how to work the computer. 
With this knowledge of a series of binary numbers came POWER.
<P>
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a revolution that spawned and
will help to shape the future of "knowledge" began to take
place.  The introduction of the "Micro" or "Personal" computer
(P.C.), by IBM and several other companies, changed the entire
complexion of computing. The immense power that had been
accumulated by the data processing professionals of the "Secret
Data Society" in the "Mainframe Days" was being eroded by a
collection of supposedly "underpowered" and "weak"
microprocessors that were assuming many functions previously
performed within the M.I.S. compartment.  With this transference
of information, went a modicum of power.
<P>
Although resisted by the dataprocessing professionals, who had a
vested interest in maintaining the "mainframe mentality" that
only they understood, the "Micro-revolution" continued.  P.C.s
(personal computers) were then successfully attached to each
other by cables, in networks, that allowed direct communication
and information sharing within companies.  Then, links were
established by telephone modem (modulator/demodulator) to allow
intercompany and even interstate communication. By the
mid-1980's, a P.C. user with the correct "uplink" equipment
could transmit data around the world by means of satellite
communication. With this ability to communicate, send, and
receive data, power came to the individual desktop. It
drastically reduced the need for specialization and
compartmentalization.  The "channels" had been opened.
<P>
<HR>
<H3>A Vision of Management . . . tomorrow</H3>
<P>
Developments in computer and communication technology should
change the workplace of tomorrow.  So as to keep up with the
rapidly changing developments of other industries and world
events, professional leaders must drastically reshape the way
they think and conduct their business.  The technology is
available or rapidly being developed that will allow them to end
the practice of frequently piling information into specialized
cubbyholes.
<P>
Greatly increased computer storage and retrieval technology will
allow executives and designated others to immediately access
vast amounts of data and usable facts from their desktop
workstation.  Access to this information can be made available
to as many people as need be, and new input also can be
constantly added as it is compiled or obtained from other
databases.  Some types of information can be accessed in "real
time" and can be expected to measurably improve an agency's or
company's response to dynamic events.
<P>
The need or desire for "channeling" of information can be
greatly diminished by using computer networks that allow
parallel access to mutually readable and writeable databases.
Communications also can take place in "real time" and involve
simultaneous analysis of information as it is being received.
"Expert systems" (artificial intelligence) will increase our
productivity by translating data into a format that is easily
understood and that can be readily utilized by almost anybody.
<P>
Faster and faster C.P.U.s (Central Processing Units) in our
desktop computers will allow us to run more sophisticated
software that also will improve our productivity.  By processing
multiple millions of instructions per second, we will be able to
calculate, write, and manipulate text and images at a previously
unimagined speed.  Multi-media computers will incorporate video,
sound, and television into our computers.  Multitasking of
programs will allow us to be monitoring live world events in a
small "window" on our computer screen, while a spreadsheet is
recalculating in another, and we are typing a memo to the "boss"
in a third.  Or even more . . .
<P>
With this increased speed and improved connectivity will come a
change in power structures within the corporate and governmental
bureaucracies.  Traditional power concepts will be replaced by
computer generated ones.  As "assembly-line" management theories
are replaced by open and communicating power structures, the
ones with the greatest power will be the ones with the "best"
information.  As we gain a greater grasp of world events and can
observe them in "real time", those that can rapidly analyze and
respond to changes will have greater opportunities. Those that
will have the best information are those with the greatest
communication and data gathering capability.
<P>
An absence of need for conventional management tactics will be
created as computer interconnected managers and employees
communicate and "interface" to and from almost anyplace. Smaller
and more powerful "laptop" computers and cellular modems will
allow employees to be located almost anywhere and still be able
to "telecommute" to work.  World-wide paging and telephone
services will connect all of the continents by satellite
"hook-up".  Even the most remote sites will be accessible by
"live" video, voice and computer access; thus allowing "real
time" knowledge of dynamic events.
<P>
Those that refuse to participate in this "technocratic
revolution" will undoubtedly suffer for their reluctance. Other
companies and agencies will obtain the necessary intelligence to
"put them out of business".  Government budgets dollars will go
to the most prepared, best informed, and most efficient
agencies.  Business contracts will go to companies that can
provide the best products at the lowest prices.  Analysis of who
are "the best and brightest" will be made easier than at any
time in history, largely due to the improved computer
capabilities of those doing the evaluation.
<P>
<HR>
<H4>Conclusions</H4>
<P>
The size, shape, qualities, and quantities of power can be
expected to be transfigured by knowledge in the coming years. In
other words, those with appropriate knowledge can be expected to
be able to make the choices that can make them healthy, wealthy,
and wise.  Power and money will gravitate to those that have the
knowledge that is needed by others. Those that understand the
new technologies of information gathering and dissemination will
benefit the most from an increasingly more mobile and rapidly
changing society.
<P>
Those who would wish to effectively gain and use power must;
first . . .  understand the dynamics, nature and complexity of
power, second . . .  accumulate the facts, information, and
data, that will empower them, and third . . .  exercise it in a
fair, open, humane, and considerate manner.

<B>**LEAD STORY**</B>

<H2>"WE WEREN'T GOING TO LOSE THIS PATIENT"...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

Members of the NYC*EMS saved the life of a woman who was in
cardiac arrest on Monday.  What makes this story even more
interesting is that the EMS crew was trapped inside of a
stuck elevator for more than an hour with the victim.  The
EMS crew and the victim were stuck between the 13th and 14th
floors of a Bronx Housing Authority building.
<P>

Emergency Medical Technician Joseph Conzo said, "We weren't
going to lose this patient.  After bringing her back from
life, we weren't going to lose her because of an elevator."
<P>

Luckily, the EMS crew had plenty of help on hand.  In the
elevator with the victim were three EMT's and an emergency
room doctor who just happened to be riding with them.
<P>

During the ordeal in the elevator, the medical team ran of
oxygen, but were passed fresh tanks through the partially
opened elevator doors by members of the FDNY.  After about
an hour, firefighters and members of the NYPD Emergency Services
Unit (ESU) were able to finally extricate everyone through
the elevator doors.
<P>

The situation began at about 0830 EST, when the EMS crew
responded to the Melrose Houses in The Bronx.  The initial
911 call indicated only that a woman was in need of medical
assistance.  When the ambulance arrived, they found a woman
in her 50's unconscious, not breathing, and with no heartbeat
or pulse.  A second ambulance with two paramedics was sent to
the scene and assisted the first ambulance crew in reviving
the patient.
<P>

Conzo said, "We went through the usual procedure, gave her
oxygen, CPR, tried to defibrillate her, and we finally got
a pulse."  After about thirty minutes, the EMS crew and the
doctor placed the patient on a stretcher and then proceeded
to get stuck on the elevator.
<P>

ENN sends their commendations and congratulations to everyone involved in this operation for their "stick-to-it-ness" and refusal to lose the patient to this situation.

<H2>Four Murders in Four Hours in Philadelphia</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

PHILADELPHIA (ENN) - In something that Philadelphia homicide detectives say that they can't ever remembering happening before, four people were murdered in four separate incidents within four hours of one another on Saturday night and Sunday morning.  The first homicide occurred at about 2240 EDT on Saturday.  A 51-year-old male was shot once in the chest and killed as he got into his car in the 1000 block of East Slocum Street.  A witness said that a car approached the victim and a shot was fired.
<P>

At about 2310 EDT, a 36-year-old male was found shot in the neck in the 3900 block of Dell Street.  The victim died minutes later at Temple University Hospital, who had a very busy night. Few other facts are known in this case.
<P>

At 0240 EDT on Sunday, a man was beaten to death in a fight in the 400 block of West Cheltem Street.  Police officers caught the 19-year-old offender as he was still kicking the victim.
<P>

A few minutes later, at the intersection of Cambria Street and Bonsall Avenue, a 26-year-old male was found shot in the head and chest.  He died thirty minutes later at Temple University Hospital.
<P>

Philadelphia generally averages about one homicide per day.  One police officer said that Sunday's four hour violent spree was unprecedented.  Philadelphia Homicide Captain Patrick Dempsey said, "No one can remember that happening before.  There is certainly no common denominator, except that four people are dead."  Philadelphia, so far, has had 182 homicides in 1996. At the same time last year it had 175 murders.
<P>

And if those four murder cases weren't enough to keep homicide investigators busy, later in the afternoon -- the body of a woman in her 20s was found by children in a South Philadelphia schoolyard at 16th Street and Moore Street.  The victim appeared to have her throat cut and was dumped in the yard in a bag.

A huge fire at the Marathon refinery in southwest Detroit created so
much smoke that state police were forced to shut down nearby I-75
for a short time. Witnesses heard a series of small explosions when the
fire in the refinery's main crude oil unit began. Company firefighters
were joined by counterparts from Detroit and neighboring River
Rouge and Melvindale in keeping an adjacent tank farm cool and in
putting foam on the flames until they were able to turn a valve cutting
off the flow of oil to the fire. Everyone was accounted for and there
were no injuries.
<P>

A two-alarm fire ripped through an abandoned Detroit bowling alley
on Six Mile and Woodward. Smoke was seen from miles away.
Firefighters were expected to remain on the scene throughout the
night for extensive overhauling.
<P>

Dozens of grass fires have kept firefighters busy this week throughout
Michigan's Saginaw Valley and elsewhere in the state. Dry weather is
being blamed for the rash of early spring brush fires. Firefighters have
also been battling grass fires in Kalamazoo, Kent, Livingston,
Muskegon and Ottawa Counties.

Montana is becoming a big news state.  On Thursday morning, five
cars of a freight train derailed near the western Montana town
of Alberton.  The five tank cars derailed at about 0400 MDT and
were said to contain chlorine.  At least one of the train cars
overturned and began to leak.
<P>

At least ten people were transported to area hospitals complaining
of breathing problems.  The town of Alberton with its 400 residents
was evacuated.  Interstate 90 was closed for three miles in each
direction.  The Missoula Hazardous Materials Team was on the
scene of the incident.

<title>CPR Pump; Better CPR??</title>
</head>
<body>

<H3>New "Pump" For Better CPR?</H3>
<p>
By: Paul Anderson, Metro Correspondent
<P>
Chicago,IL, May 18, 1994 --  According to a recently published article in the
Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), researchers in Minnesota
have found that the use of a"plunger-type device" is more effective in
providing Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) than the standard method. But, a
controversy has erupted in the medical community because the Federal Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) halted the study because of a lack of "informed
consent" on the part of thecardiac arrest patients, who were treated with the device.<p>

The new study was conducted with a device called the "Cardio-Pump", which is
used to both compress and "pull bloodback into the heart".  In the study, EMT's and
Paramedics in St.Paul, MN were specially trained to use the device, and then
randomly assigned to use it on cardiac arrest patients.  Those that did not receive
treatment with the "Cardio-Pump" were given standard CPR treatment in the critical
first few minutes following a heart stoppage.  The survival outcome of both groups
was then compared.<p>

As was expected by both prehospital and medical experts, the survival rate was
much better for those patients that received care within ten (10) minutes of their
cardiac event.  In the study, twenty (20%) percent of those receiving standard CPR
and Advanced Life Support (ALS-Paramedic Intervention) procedures, within the
first ten minutes, were successful; with an astounding forty (40%) percent of those
treated by the "Cardio-Pump" being saved by it's use and standard Paramedic treatment within the same time frames.  Overall, the study suggested that twenty-three percent (23%) of cardiac arrest patients were successfully resuscitated with the pump and that seventeen percent (17%) of those treated with current CPR procedures were saved.
<p>

Dr. Carin M. Olson, a contributing editor of JAMA, is described as "upset" by an
FDA decision to cancel the study at it's mid-point, because the patients in cardiac
arrest were not afforded the opportunity to accept or reject the new and virtually
unapproved treatment with the "Cardio-Pump".  Dr. Olson has suggested that
informed-consent regulations be changed to allow for "ground-breaking research" on
cardiac arrest patients or those with major head injuries. Doctors and paramedics
both agree, that in a crucial "life or death" situation, it is practically impossible to
get a "informed patient consent" from either the patient or the family.<p>

 Dr. Joe Ornato, Chairman of the American Heart Association (AHA) emergency cardiac care committee, also expressed his approval of more research in this vital area.  Dr. Ornato's reasoning is based on the fact that, according to the doctor, "Your talking about a life-or-death situation where our current therapy is nearly hopeless...and the reality is, there is no reasonable way to get informed consent from an unconscious patient".
<p>

Clark Staten, Executive Director of the Chicago, IL based Emergency Response &amp; Research Institute, said that the national resuscitation rate of cardiac arrest victims is "at best...dismal". Staten, who studies emergency medical and disaster response issues, said that there are many factors involved in this determination.  Staten said that a rapid EMS response to the scene is essential, as well as the early implementation of CPR or other methods of restoring circulation and oxygenation to the brain and heart. <p>

Early defibrillation, administration of "thrombylitic" and other advanced cardiac drugs, and
transport to the nearest appropriate hospital are also important factors in successful resuscitations, according to the veteran paramedic. "What is needed, at this point, is the legal and ethical authority to perform the necessary research and development of equipment and procedures that will allow us to take that next step, to find alternative methods to successfully resuscitate the clinically dead", Staten said.  <p>

"It is possible that we are very close to several 'break-throughs' in the care of cardiac arrest patients, but both medical personnel and the general population have to realize that certain risks are inevitable in these research efforts", Staten continued. "One thing is certain...anything we can experimentally do to improve the chances of survival of a person who is clinically dead, is warranted...because the alternative is inevitable death", Staten concluded.<p>

<B>**LEAD STORY**</B>

<H2>THE UNITED STATES IS A TICKING VIOLENT CRIME BOMB...</H2>
By Steve Macko
<P>

In a report that was issued by a commission of crime experts in
early January, it was said that violent crime in the United States
is a ticking bomb ready to explode.  In a contradiction of official
statistics that say crime levels are dropping, The Council on Crime
in America said in their report that crime "remains at historic
highs.  America is a ticking violent crime bomb, and there is little
time remaining to prepare for the blast."  The commission took special 
note of the rise of crime by youthful offenders.
<P>

The Council on Crime in America is headed by former United States
Attorney General Griffin Bell and by former national drug czar William
Bennett.  Other members of the commission include the state attorneys
general from Florida and Colorado and a Philadelphia prosecutor.  The
ten man commission painted a very grim picture of the criminal mayhem
that is occurring in the United States.
<P>

According to the commission, the official FBI crime statistics are
only the tip of the iceberg of what is really happening on the streets
of the nation's cities.  The report that was issued said that the
crime rate, which was based upon surveys of victims and not just only
on crimes reported to the police, show that violent crime was almost
six times higher than what is officially reported.  <B>Official statistics
said that in 1993 there were about two million violent crimes reported </B>
to authorities.  But based upon victims reports, the commission estimated
that <B>there were actually 11 million violent crimes committed in 1993.</B>
<P>

The council said that the risk of person becoming a victim of violent
crime in the United States was greater than being injured in an
autombile accident.  51.5 per 1,000 adults a year compared to 22 per
1,000.
<P>

The report said that the fastest growing category of homicide in
the United States was murder by street gangs.  The commonly-held
view that most murders are committed against people who know one
another is no longer true.  The report said that most murders were
now being committed by strangers.

<TITLE>Cop Killers-Death Penalty Debate</TITLE>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 14:00CST-03/20/96
<P>
<center><H2>COP Killers and the Death Penalty</H2>
<H4>Editorial Opinion </H4>
By Clark Staten, ERRI Executive Director</center>
<P>
Chicago, IL, March 20, 1996 (ENN)-- In the past twenty-four
hours, the issue of whether or not to seek death penalty charges
against the alleged murderers of a young New York City police
officer has created a furor of comment and controversy. The
matter at hand involves the discretion of a Bronx prosecutor to
personally decide whether or not he will support and enforce a
newly enacted New York state death penalty law. 
<P> 

Yesterday, New York Governor George Pataki sent a letter to
Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson asking whether or not he
intended to seek the death penalty in the case of the brutal
slaying of Officer Kevin Gillespie, who was allegedly killed by
three carjackers on March 16th. According to police records, all
of the alleged assailants have extensive police records,
including a previous murder charge against one of the defendants
in the Gillespie case.
<P>

It is believed that the letter was written because D.A. Johnson
had previously publicly stated his opposition to the death
penalty and that he had no "present intention" of ever seeking
it within his prosecutorial duties. 
<P>

In our opinion, if there were ever a case that "cried out" for
the use of the death penalty, it would be the Gillespie case. A
young police officer, in the pursuit of his rightful duties, was
needlessly struck down by bullets fired by merciless attackers.
His life was allegedly taken by ruthless assailants who had
previously been convicted of brutalizing others in society. He,
his family, co-workers, and friends somehow seem forgotten in
the political wrangling and intrigue associated with the death
penalty issue. 
<P>

We would respectfully ask that two issues be given consideration
in this matter. One involves the deterrence effect of sure,
rapid, and severe punishment for those that would assault,
batter, or kill police officers, paramedics or firefighters. 
Without this protection, society's further slide into chaos can
be assured. We, as a society, must ensure the safety of these
public servants, in order to allow them to effectively carry out
the performance of their duties. As much as it may be in vogue
in recent years, to criticize, chastise, demean, and prosecute
emergency service employees, they are still the "thin blue line"
that maintains the separation between civilization and anarchy. 
If it requires the use of the death penalty to protect these
dedicated public employees...so be it.
<P>

Secondly, the very serious question of how many times a criminal
can be allowed to rape, rob, injure, or kill must be given due
consideration. A majority of crimes these days are perpetrated
by repeat offenders that continually prey on the weak and
innocent. Statistics would seem to indicate that these predators
commit greater and more horrendous crimes until drastic measures
are taken to stop them.  Many criminals laugh at the threat of
being subjected to an admittedly over-whelmed criminal justice
system that is likely to give them a "slap-on-the-wrist", even
for increasingly more serious crimes. Often, drug dealers,
thieves, prostitutes, and other criminals are "back on the
streets" before police and prosecutors can complete the
paperwork that is required in their arrest. 
<P>

We, at ERRI, believe that maybe the time has come for all of us,
collectively, to send a message to criminals of all kinds that
we won't tolerate their barbaric behavior and will take whatever
actions are necessary to stop them...even if that requires the
most drastic of measures. 
<P>

<H3>Gasoline Tanker Hit by Train in  Bergen County</H3>
By Jim Fay, ENN NYC-NJ Metro Correspondent
<P>
A fully-loaded gasoline tanker-truck was struck (yesterday) by a freight
train in a populated, residential neighborhood in Bergen County,
NJ, near the George Washington Bridge on Tuesday.
<P>

At 1100 hrs., EST, the Bogota Volunteer Fire Department
responded  to the struck tanker at Ft. Lee Road and River Road.
Upon arrival, firefighters observed the tanker portion of the
truck overturned, laying on it's side immediately adjacent to an
operating neighborhood gas station.  The tanker did not rupture
and there were no apparent leaks.  The truck had just left a Hess
Oil Company holding tank facility, a major gasoline storage area,
about 500 feet west of the railroad crossing. The truck was hit by 
a northbound Susquahanna Railroad freight train, a small railroad that travels through NJ, up into NY State.
<P>

A call went out for HazMat personnel from numerous surrounding
volunteer fire departments, as well as HazMat and Rescue Company
firefighters from the paid departments of Teaneck, Englewood, and
the county seat of Hackensack, NJ.  In addition, a multi-unit
Bergen County Dept. of Health HazMat team responded and
spearheaded the operation.
<P>

The residential neighborhood of private homes and garden
apartments immediately around the incident was evacuated and
those people were taken to Bogota High School and assisted
by Disaster personnel from the Bergen County Chapter of the
American Red Cross.
<P>

At approximately 1230 hrs., the off-loading operation started.
It was undetermined how long the operation would take, but heavy
foam lines surrounded the tanker and would continue until all
of the product was safely removed.

<font size=6>HEROIN PROLIFERATES WORLDWIDE</font> <br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
In a recent United Nations report that was released at an Interpol conference in Bangkok, Thailand, cheaper 
and purer heroin is said to be entering U.S. and European markets at a growing pace. This is because of new 
trafficking routes that are opening up from Asia. The report said that fast-paced geopolitical and economic 
changes, mostly in Asia, have created new supply routes and new markets for drugs.<br>
<br>
An Interpol narcotics expert, Ramachandra Sunda, wrote the U.N. report. Sunda commended several countries 
for the efforts to stop the flow of drugs. He said, &quot;Thai authorities have made a dent.&quot; Sunda also said that China 
has also done a good job in its anti-narcotics enforcement. In 1995, China seized 2.3 tons of heroin. So far, in 
1996, China has confiscated one ton.<br>
<br>
But, according to the report, authorities are intercepting only a fraction of the drug produced in Burma, Laos 
and Thailand. That area, which is called the &quot;Golden Triangle.&quot; supplies most of the heroin that reaches the 
United States.<br>
<br>
The recent Interpol conference heard evidence that where political change has been most dramatic -- such as in 
Russia -- the potential for criminal activity becomes most alarming. In referring to the boom of opium production 
in Afghanistan, Sunda said, &quot;The warlords of the 80s have become the drug lords of the 90s.&quot;<br>
<br>
Narcotics seizures, worldwide, have generally declined and the number of smuggling routes has grown. The 
production of opium, from which heroin and morphine are made, has remained steady or is rising.<br>
<br>
The United States State Department Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs reports 
that 59 percent of the world's opium is produced in Burma. 31 percent comes from Afghanistan, Laos produces 
5 percent, 4 percent comes from Pakistan and the rest is from Thailand and the southern Chinese province of 
Yunnan.<br>
<br>
Interpol says that up to 4,500 tons of opium are cultivated in Asia. That amount of opium can be used to 
produce 450 tons of heroin or morphine. The United Nations report said that the area around the 
Afghanistan-Pakistan border, nicknamed the &quot;Golden Crescent,&quot; is the main source of heroin and morphine that 
are smuggled into Europe.<br>
<br>
According to intelligence from Western European narcotics experts, it is suggested that 80 to 90 percent of the 
heroin that was seized in Europe from 1993 to 1995 came from southwest Asia via Turkey and southeastern 
Europe. The report said that Istanbul was &quot;the princpal clearing house for heroin bound for the Western 
market.&quot; This was because of improvements made at airports, seaports and trans-European highways.<br>
<br>
Ethnic Chinese criminal gangs continue to dominate the heroin trafficking in southeast Asia. West African 
organized crime groups, mostly from Nigeria, as said to be responsible for large shipments to North America. 
Traffickers are also hiring more Eastern and Central Europeans to try to smuggle narcotics out of Bangkok. This 
is seen as a change of personnel rather than of venue.<br>
<br>
The United Nations report also said that the dramatic increase in criminal activity in Russia and the former 
Soviet republics in central Asia merit particular concern. It was also said that an eye should be kept on the 
political turmoil in those countries. The report said, &quot;Russia by its vastness remains vulnerable as a transit 
country. Indications are that Russian territory will be increasingly used by drug trafficking groups operating 
between Central Asia and Europe.&quot;<br>
<br>
The report also said, &quot;The stage is ... already set for a massive involvement of this region in all aspects of global 
drug criminality.&quot; Playing a major part in all of this are increased air links and more free movement of goods. It is 
combined with poor customs and banking controls.<br>
<br>
Overall, the United Nations report did not provide any encouragement in the battle to staunch the flow of drugs 
worldwide.</p>

<H2>Shopping Area in Tel Aviv Struck by Terror Bomb</H2>
By Clark Staten, CT Analyst
<P>

(ENN) Numerous reports are coming in regarding another bombing in Israel, this time, in a shopping area in downtown Tel Aviv. the location given for the site is in the intersection of King George St. and Dizengoff St.. Unconfirmed reports indicate that a pedestrian suicide bomber was responsible. Early reports say that at least twelve (12) people are believed dead and as many as 100 others injured. Several of the wounded are described as children. According to EMS sources, sixty-eight (68) people are reported to have been transported to Ichilov hospital, six (6) others taken to Tel Hashomer hospital, nine (9) people to Wolfson Hospital, and six (6) to HaSharon Hospital.
<P>

Within the past thirty minutes, normally reliable sources tell ENN that there was a telephone call to authorities indicating that there were "other bombs waiting thoughout the country". Police sources could not authenticate the validity of this additional threat. Bomb squad officers were seen scouring the intersection where today's blast occurred. Today's blast was probably composed of plastique explosive, based on the intensity and destruction of the detonation.
<P>

No claim of responsibility has been issued as of yet, but ERRI experts expect the El Kassim Brigade or some other Islamic extremist group to claim responsibility soon. Yesterday, in interviews with both WGN-TV and WBBM-TV in Chicago, ERRI accurately predicted the danger of additional imminent terrorist events. ENN is in contact with our affiliate, the SNS News Service in Israel and will provide updates as more becomes available.

<title>Republican Convention Security Preparations</title>

<p>ENN DAILY REPORT<br>

Saturday, August 10, 1996<br>
Vol. 2 - 223<br>
<br>
Editor's Note: ENN is pleased to present the following highly in-depth article about the security preparations for 
the upcoming Republican National Convention that starts on Monday in San Diego. Because of its long length, 
we are presenting the article in two parts. <br>
<br>
<font size=5><strong>GOP NATIONAL CONVENTION SECURITY PLAN - PART 1 </strong></font><br>
By Alijandra Mogilner, San Diego Correspondent<br>
<br>
As an estimated 50,000 people will descend on the city of San Diego, some bringing with them a fear of 
terrorist bombings, chemical attacks, assassination attempts and more. While Republican National Convention 
officially begins on 14 August with pre-convention festivities for the primary figures on 11 August, the physical 
preparations for security began almost two months ago and the planning for them over a year ago. The primary 
concern is, and was even before the attacks on TWA and Atlanta, terrorism. By all accounts, the 18 local, state 
and federal law enforcement agencies led by the Secret Service, that are devising security plans for the 
convention have done a thorough job of preparing for the worst. But the hard reality is that even the most 
sweeping and aggressive security plan is no guarantee against acts of terror. However, law enforcement officials 
believe they have done everything possible to ensure the safety of the convention and of people who are in the 
city during that time.<br>
<br>
&quot;We want to be prepared,&quot; said Keith Enerson of the San Diego Police Department, the assistant chief who has 
been working on the convention security plan for more than a year. &quot;I don't want people to think we're 
expecting an Armageddon, but we need to be prepared at all times.&quot;<br>
<br>
According to Capt. David Bejarano, who is overseeing the Police Department's convention planning, all the 
law-enforcement agencies have been involved in daily convention security planning for more than a year. and 
communicating with their counterparts in Atlanta and in Chicago.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have developed what we believe is a very comprehensive security plan for the Convention Center and 
other places throughout the city,&quot; Bejarano said. &quot;We're prepared to handle any special event throughout the 
city,&quot;<br>
<br>
Republican spokesman Tim Fitzpatrick says that the Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies have 
been gathering intelligence continuously. &quot;We're using the best high-tech security equipment we can come 
across and the best security experts from around the country to prevent such incidents,&quot; he added.<br>
<br>
Security will be especially tight: from 2 p.m. to 11 p.m. on the final evening of the convention when the GOP 
presidential candidate gives his acceptance speech -- the only night Dole is certain to be in the convention hall; 
on Wednesday from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. when Dole is scheduled to meet with veterans with whom he served; and 
on Wednesday morning from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. when Newt Gingrich is to give his only scheduled speech. That 
10 minutes in front of representatives of the nation&#170;s agribusiness is a focus because of Iranian threats in 
February against the Speaker's life.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>General Preparations:</strong></font><br>
<br>
San Diego police expect to have the full force, about 2,000 officers, working 12-hour shifts throughout 
convention week. Most of them will be on convention duty. For example, prosecutor Gael Strack said 15 
detectives will be pulled from the Police Department's domestic violence unit for two weeks to beef up security. 
MaryAnne Pintar, spokeswoman for Mayor Susan Golding, said the city budgeted an extra $500,000 to cover 
police overtime during the convention.<br>
<br>
Officers from local, state and federal law enforcement agencies from the FBI to the Metropolitan Transit Board 
have been assigned to provide protection for dignitaries and security at the convention center, the protest zone, 
and outside residential and meeting sites.<br>
<br>
Hundreds of traffic officers will direct the masses and assist motorcades. Vice detectives will be on the lookout 
for prostitutes and pickpockets. Intelligence detectives will gather information, and SWAT teams will be on 
standby, hoping they're not needed. Additionally, the San Diego Police Department has offered the services of 
hundreds of volunteers, including members of the Retired Senior Citizens Patrol and the Volunteers in Policing.<br>
<br>
The Secret Service will protect the presidential and vice presidential nominees and spouses as well as former 
presidents and spouses. The California Highway Patrol will escort the 31 Republican governors and the 
international diplomats expected to attend the convention. Protection for the estimated 200 members of the 
Senate and House will be provided by the U.S. Capitol Police.<br>
<br>
SWAT teams and Secret Service agents visited every major hotel from Coronado to Carlsbad, as well as 
dozens of party venues, taking an inventory of every door, elevator, rooftop and basement. Site surveys were 
taken on every place that officials felt could be a target. Every exit has been noted, roof access has been 
analyzed and floor plans have been gathered. Distances have been measured, photographs taken and files 
created. Authorities now know how to shut off power and water. Those in charge of the command center know 
how to contact the owner and the manager and have designated the best places to put police sharpshooters.<br>
<br>
In the past year, law enforcement officers countywide underwent hundreds of hours in training on everything 
from X-ray machines to crowd control and the First Amendment rights of demonstrators. There even was a 
class in which officers were shown photos of unfamiliar uniforms, credentials and badges, such as those used by 
the Capitol Police.<br>
<br>
Police leased almost 200 pieces of X-ray equipment and metal detectors, including walk-through, hand-held 
and conveyer-belt detectors. The equipment will be used to search boats docked in the area and to screen 
anyone entering the convention center and protest areas.<br>
<br>
Local security firms early this summer also received requests for help at the convention site. One company was 
hired by the television networks to protect broadcasting equipment.<br>
<br>
Several command centers will serve as makeshift police stations. The main one, which will hold prisoners in the 
event of mass arrests, is at the Naval Training Center near the airport.<br>
<br>
The estimated 50,000 visitors to San Diego include 12,000 to 14,000 members of the media and almost 8,000 
delegates, alternates, guests and VIPs -- all attending hundreds of gatherings around the county. However the 
convention site itself will be the primary target for security forces. The convention center has several problems 
that are unique to this site and this year.<br>
<br>
<font size=5><strong>* </strong></font><strong>1. </strong>The setting itself is very vulnerable. Besides the usual tall buildings and hotels that give easy access to the 
site, the convention center sits on the water front at San Diego Harbor. The harbor entry is a busy one that 
serves up to a thousand small boats a day and the waterway is deep enough to accommodate the Navy's 
largest ships. It would be impossible to check every boat that has access to the larger harbor area and, even if 
the waterway close to the convention is tightly regulated, this gives uncontrollable access to the area.<br>
<br>
The U.S. Coast Guard as the agency drafting the plan for a security zone encompassing the marina area behind 
the San Diego Convention Center. The Coast Guard is developing the plan at the request of the U.S. Secret 
Service. The enforced zone in the waters directly behind the center, encompasses the four southernmost docks, 
which together house more than 100 boats.<br>
<br>
Those boats serve as living quarters for a number of people comedian Jerry Lewis and director Larry 
Goodman. The Secret Service wanted to bar access to these boats, or have them moved, before and during the 
convention. Both businesses in the area which are dependent on the boat people, and the boaters themselves, 
objected. So, security had to compromise: those that have boats at the marinas have to have special credentials 
and must personally escort guests from approach areas to their boat. <br>
<br>
While this will give security a chance to observe and/or deal with those who are in the area, this will be almost 
impossible during events such as the public fireworks when boaters have already planned parties for friends to 
watch the display. The Coast Guard and San Diego Harbor Police are having boaters with slips near the 
convention site pass through a checkpoint where they'll be subject to search as will their boats. Background 
checks have also been conducted on the people who occupy slips near the convention center, law enforcement 
sources said.<br>
<br>
Another problem is the use of outdoor venues. The GOP intends to use the center's driveway and a divided 
stretch of the street immediately in front of the building as the center's &quot;lobby&quot; where guests can mingle and 
queue up during the convention. Additionally, rooftop gatherings will only be protected by canvas sails that act 
as a roof for the area, but does not screen the view of the area totally from nearby skyscrapers.<br>
<br>
<font size=5><strong>* </strong></font><strong>2.</strong> The budget is painfully strained. The GOP convention is the most expensive in history -- and it has gone 
$20 million dollars over budget. The task of transforming the waterfront facility into a political village built 
around an enormous television set is costing about $30 million -- in part because of beefed up security 
measures following the attack on TWA Flight 800. The extra $20 million was to be raised by the Republican 
National Committee, a California Republican group, Mayor Susan Golding, and Governor Pete Wilson. 
Wilson, however, has backed out of his commitment to raise $3 million. <br>
<br>
As a result, some fear that it is the invisible security measures they planed to add after the TWA attack that will 
suffer. In retaliation Wilson, who hoped to use the convention to further his drive to be the next GOP candidate 
for President has been relegated to an 8 minute speech on Monday morning. But, as one official observed, that 
won't do much to further security. The only thing that would help is for that amount of money to be made up so 
that we can afford the extra security measures. Official spokespeople for the convention say that the deficit will 
not affect security and all measures will be taken.<br>
<br>
<font size=5><strong>* </strong></font><strong>3. </strong>The surprise rally/mini-convention to be held by Pat Buchanan in nearby Escondido creates special 
challenges. A tribute dinner for Pat Buchanan, the conservative scheduled to take place at the California Center 
for the Arts, in Escondido on Sunday, August 11 has turned into a possible announcement of his candidacy for 
President on a third party ticket. Aware that Buchanan may draw protesters, and in light of the Atlanta 
explosion, police had already beefed up their security plan to include bomb-sniffing dogs, increased training and 
education, and additional patrols around the center's perimeter.<br>
<br>
Police patrols with bomb-sniffing dogs will make regular sweeps of the center's expansive site next to City Hall. 
In addition, both police and center security staff will be provided with bomb-recognition training, as well as 
procedures to follow in case a potential bomb is spotted. Also as a security measure, several streets around the 
center will be closed off during the late afternoon. Copying another page from San Diego's security plan, 
Escondido police have also designated a protest site for the potential demonstrators, and are requiring each 
group to get a special permit.<br>
<br>
However, officials are now extremely concerned with the change from a dinner to a possible mini-Presidential 
convention. Additionally, Secret Service agents will now have to join Capitol Police in protecting Buchanan 
since he is a possible candidate, shorting the staff that is on duty in San Diego proper.<br>

Vol. 2 - 224<br>
<br>
Editor's Note: This is the second and concluding part of a fine article written by Alijandra Mogilner, from San 
Diego, on the security preparations for the Republican National Convention, which begins tomorrow. ENN 
thanks Alijandra for this in-depth effort.</p>
<p><font size=5>GOP NATIONAL CONVENTION SECURITY PLAN - PART 2</font> <br>
By Alijandra Mogilner, ENN San Diego Correspondent<br>
<br>
<font size=5><strong>* </strong></font><strong>4.</strong> Special protest groups within and outside of the party Anti-abortionists and pro-abortionists, 
homosexuals, Mexican activists, the handicapped and the homeless are among 65 groups that have received 
permits to demonstrate at the convention. The GOP and some security agencies wanted the protest site several 
blocks away from the center, but the protesters argued that it was too far and sued for First Amendment rights 
and won. The groups would have had a First Amendment right to protest on the sidewalk in front of the 
convention center, but a security plan calls for a buffer around the building. Now the site will be directly across 
from the convention center door but across a major highway. Another site is also allowed close to the hotels in 
the immediate area that are expected to house most of the primary delegates.<br>
<br>
San Diego Police Department officials and the Secret Service championed the site eventually picked as actually 
being the most secure available, in part because it would put protesters so close to the convention that they 
would have little incentive to stray. The site was moved due to pressure from the GOP. Under terms of the 
city's contract with the RNC, the committee allegedly has veto power over the protest site and did not want 
such easy access to conventioneers who will be using the outdoor area in front of the center as a gathering 
place.<br>
<br>
Among the topics of discussion created by the move is an earlier decision by city officials not to install metal 
detectors at the official protest site. Now that the demonstrators will be so close, the added protection may be 
considered to be necessary. The original decision had been made because officials felt that metal detectors are 
unfeasible because of the need to move large groups of protesters in and out of the area quickly. The high cost 
of the machines, at $100,000 a piece, was a secondary factor. The site will be patrolled continuously by police 
and surrounded by a wire fence.<br>
<br>
Outside of the immediate area of the convention, the primary security concerns about protesters are largely 
focused on the anti-abortionists. Law enforcement agencies quietly suggested that San Diego-area physicians 
and clinics that perform abortions consider &quot;taking a vacation&quot; during the GOP convention to avoid violent 
confrontations when thousands of abortion foes are expected to demonstrate in the city. Some physicians say 
they are taking the suggestion to heart. But officials with Planned Parenthood and WomanCare, two major 
clinics providing abortions in San Diego, say they have no intention of shutting down. The heads of the clinics 
have been advised by police to wear a bulletproof vest during the convention.<br>
<br>
WomanCare, a health center that provides abortions, has trained volunteers to protect the clinic and its patients 
from protesters. Besides recruiting more than 200 volunteer escorts for rotating shifts, WomanCare also is 
raising funds to hire extra security guards, a precaution Phillips estimated will cost $35,000.<br>
<br>
Operation Right to Life says that thousands of protesters from across the country are expected to descend on 
San Diego during the convention. Even though the local committee says fears of violence are ludicrous, there 
has been one bombing and several personal assaults by local activists in the past and out of area participants are 
unknown quantities. One analyst says, &#170;Violence is often exported. The anonymity provided makes someone 
bent on violence feel more secure and able to get away with things that would be impossible where they might 
be recognized.<br>
<br>
Anti-abortion protests are additionally problematic since a Japanese television station is doing a special 
investigative report on the extreme right wing in the US concentrating on the militias and Operation Right to Life. 
They are expected to be taping the protests during the convention.<br>
<br>
<font size=5><strong>*</strong></font><font size=4><strong> </strong></font><font size=3><strong>5.</strong></font><font size=4><strong> </strong></font>The convention was targeted in specific terrorist threats that must be taken seriously. Letters sent to the 
government and to some news papers claimed the TWA attack was the third in a string of four and the fourth 
one would come soon. If the threats are authentic, and officials are acting on the possibility that they are, many 
feel that the convention will be the target of that attack.<br>
<br>
The Iranian government already made an official threat against House Speaker Newt Gringrich and suggested 
that the convention would create an excellent chance to make that threat good. Four military officers have been 
working for House Speaker Newt Gingrich since March, and are believed to be part of the government's 
program for protecting him, along with agents from the Capitol Police and intelligence agencies. Even though 
Gingrich is only officially scheduled to appear in San Diego for about 10 minutes and is under heavy personal 
guard, the convention itself may become the symbolic target.<br>
<br>
&quot;Can you imagine,&quot; said one military analyst, &quot;the image of the convention center being attacked within full view 
of our nation's largest Naval base at North Island. The symbol of our nation as impotent against terrorism is 
almost impossible for these kind of terrorists to pass up, even without such direct threats.&quot;<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>Specific measures being taken:</strong></font><br>
<br>
On site controls: Security preparations have been, like all the other security measures, a process of compromise 
with the city and with the Republican Party. Even the start date at the San Diego Convention Center was a 
compromise. Due to the Comicon, the nation's largest comic collector's convention held at the center every 
year, the GOP and various security forces involved in protecting the convention, only had 35 days to prepare 
the convention hall.<br>
<br>
The convention center staff will continue to work from the administrative offices at the building's north end, but 
the rest of the 670,000 square feet of display and work space is the sole province of the Republicans.<br>
<br>
The contract the RNC signed with San Diego reportedly gives it 24-hour- a-day &quot;unlimited access and 
exclusive control&quot; of all rooms, furnishings, equipment and personal property customarily present in the center. 
The RNC takes possession of the center's keys, controls access to additional copies and can request that locks 
be changed. There were also tests and special inspections of elevators, escalators and emergency systems<br>
<br>
The RNC has taken possession of the Marriott Hotel parking lots adjacent to the convention center and of 
parts of the adjacent public park. Media work space is being built in the garage, which will be closed to 
vehicles during the convention for security reasons. Television and video security trailers will dot the overflow 
parking lot south of the center and the Marriott Hotel parking lots closest to San Diego Bay. A special pavilion 
and gazebo will be built over the basketball courts in Embarcadero South Park to house a special party for 
those 16 to 25 who will attend. The RNC would not discuss security measures there.<br>
<br>
The RNC also is taking control of the overflow parking lot and the former USO building at the center's south 
edge, which is designated as a security command post during the convention.<br>
<br>
Security observation and response facilities were included from the first week of work when the main hall's sky 
boxes, remote cameras, lighting systems and elevated seating were installed. &quot;Virtually every area in the center 
will be under surveillance,&quot; said one worker. &quot;We even expect the podium and platform, which is being built in 
Dallas, to have special equipment imbedded in it.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Secret Service even has a secret office within a few blocks of the convention. Disguised as an attorney's 
office, the site is expected to be a high-tech nerve center for protecting convention goers. Sophisticated 
communications gear, enabling agents to talk with almost anyone in the world, is thought to be in place.<br>
<br>
Besides the machinery of security, security governing convention personnel will be beefed up during the coming 
weeks, though the center's blue-coated guards will stay on the job, working under the RNC. &quot;There will be a 
more elaborate information gathering on who will enter the building,&quot; Wallace said. &quot;You won't have a situation 
where people are wandering through.&quot; One example of the change is that the press room, normally open to 
journalists who need to use phones and faxes, is closed until after the convention ends.<br>
<br>
Control of other convention sites: The weak link in Atlanta proved to be Centennial Park, the least-protected 
area of an Olympic security effort that had been touted as the biggest peacetime security operation in U.S. 
history.<br>
<br>
Law enforcement officials in San Diego acknowledge that while the primary focus of their security plan has been 
the waterfront convention center, the Atlanta bombing raises new concerns about convention activities held in 
other venues.<br>
<br>
&quot;Obviously there will be venues that won't be protected,&quot; said Joseph J. Perez, special agent in charge of the 
San Diego office of the Secret Service, noting that hundreds of parties and meetings are scheduled during the 
convention. &quot;We are going to try and get public awareness up,&quot; Perez said. &quot;We need the public to look for 
something out of the ordinary.&quot; Perez declined to discuss what measures will be taken to ensure the safety of 
conventioneers attending events outside the convention center.<br>
<br>
A law enforcement source close to security planning said it is likely that police will bring in sophisticated, 
hand-held explosives detectors and bomb-sniffing dogs to check out these areas. Planners may also decide to 
expand the security zone and restrict entry to some areas surrounding events.<br>
<br>
<strong>These events include:</strong><br>
<br>
-- &quot;Sail to San Diego Celebrity Golf Tournament Weekend,&quot; with playing slots going from $250,000 up to $2.8 
million<br>
<br>
-- A day at Del Mar for the sixth running of the $1 million Pacific Classic, hosted by Allen Paulson, owner of 
Cigar, the 1995 Horse of the Year.<br>
<br>
-- A Saturday-night reception and pairings party at the Del Mar Country Club.<br>
<br>
-- luncheons ranging from a few -- to a few thousand.<br>
<br>
-- A series of nautical &quot;happenings&quot; -- &quot;round the clock, every day, breakfast, lunch, dinner, after-hours 
cocktails&quot; -- aboard a 110-foot yacht docked in the harbor.<br>
<br>
-- A &quot;wrap-up&quot; party for a select 300, including former Presidents Bush and Ford.<br>
<br>
Part of the security for these events is &quot;planned uncertainty&quot;. Until the last minute, most of 150 vendors, such as 
caterers, will not be informed of where many of these activities will take place. Many, but not all of them, know 
that they will be doing them, but not where. &quot;This is the most bizarre big-time situation I've ever encountered,&quot; 
said one professional party giver, &quot;That for this many parties we don't know where we're having them or how 
many people we're having . . . This is not normal.&quot;<br>
<br>
The hotels where guests will be staying are under scrutiny as well. Staffs have had background checks, rooms 
have been swept for bugs and screened for explosives. Even those who are simply guests at the convention are 
under protection. For example, employees of the Doubletree Hotel Del Mar, where about 90 diplomats are 
staying, have all been screened. The diplomats, who will be observers at the convention, will travel from event 
to event in three buses, with two California Highway Patrol escorts.<br>
<br>
All 173 embassies in Washington were invited to take part in the convention. Usually, if the ambassador or 
charge d'affaires cannot make it, another representative is permitted. This year, however, that provision was 
axed because of limited space and security issues.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>Not so public precautions:</strong></font><br>
<br>
There are also reports that one of the observation satellites being used to identify forest fires in the west has 
been reprogrammed to keep an eye on the desert area east of San Diego, presumably to help spot any kind of 
possible terrorist gathering or emplacement.<br>
<br>
The Marine Corps at 29 Palms in the same area are expected to go on exercises in the desert concurrently with 
the convention.<br>
<br>
Navy exercises headed by the Aircraft Carrier Kitty Hawk will take place about five miles off the shore and 
crossing the harbor access route. Additionally, the carrier Constellation will be docked at North Island Naval 
Station as a symbol of the presence of the US military. It is believed that plenty of military manpower will be on 
hand, should it be needed.<br>
<br>
<strong>In some late breaking news concerning the convention:</strong><br>
<br>
Inside sources told ENN on Saturday that a &quot;device&quot; was allegedly found at the 32nd Street Naval Station 
about a week ago, where some of the conventioneers are staying. Those who are ex-military can stay at a lodge 
on base and many of the delegates are taking advantage of that service. A Haz-Mat worker at the base said, 
&quot;The was a complete bomb found at the Exchange building, but it was not hooked up. It was a message that 
they were there and could do it again. As a result, security will be heightened.&quot; </p>
<p><em>(</em><em><strong>Editors Note: </strong></em><em>On 08/12/96, a base Naval Public Affairs spokesperson reportedly denied the finding of 
any such a device near the commissary building within the past ten days, but did state that a &quot;hoax 
incident&quot; had occured that involved &quot;someone's laundry&quot;, in about the same time frame. ENN sources 
continue to maintain that there was a &quot;situation&quot; and that there was an evacuation of the base 
commissary and another nearby building, as a &quot;device&quot; was removed. The suspected box allegedly 
contained &quot;dangerous materials&quot;, but was not wired correctly.)</em><br>
<br>
One security analyst summed up the overall preparations for ENN; &quot;You can bet that if the technology is 
currently available that it is being deployed in San Diego...in light of current threat assessments, this convention 
could be high on the list of some terror organizations...they (security forces) are working extremely hard here to 
prevent that.&quot;</p>

<font size=5><strong>QUESTIONS ARISE ABOUT AIRPORT CARGO SECURITY</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
Investigators from the National Transporation Safety Board and the Federal Bureau of Investigation continue to 
search for evidence to prove their suspicions -- that TWA Flight 800 was blown out of the sky by a bomb.<br>
The most popular theory continues to be that the Boeing 747 was destroyed by a bomb in the front cargo hold. 
All of the cargo records for Flight 800 have been turned over to the Federal Aviation Administration and, of 
course, investigators are checking out leads obtained from the records.<br>
<br>
The similarities to the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, are eerie. The front nose 
section, containing the cockpit and part of the first-class section are known to have separated from the rest of 
the airliner by a catastrophic event.<br>
<br>
The responsibility for the security of cargo placed on flights falls upon the airlines. The responsibility is supposed 
to be the same as the airlines inspecting the bags of passengers. But, in reality, airlines actually rely upon 
shipping companies to vouch for the contents contained in the shipments. It appears, however, that, in turn, the 
shipping companies themselves rely upon the honesty of their frequent customers.<br>
<br>
Representing the freight companies, known as air forwarders, is the Air Forwarders Association. Its executive 
director, Jim Foster, said, &quot;It would be extremely difficult to inspect every package of every shipment manually. 
That means opening the shipment and comparing the contents to the packing list. It would not be something that 
people would be willing to pay for.&quot;<br>
<br>
In 1989, a presidential commission said that the casual oversight of cargo on passenger planes has been a 
concern for a number of years. The commission called the problem &quot;a huge gap in the security umbrella.&quot;<br>
<br>
In response to the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, Congress in 1990 passed a law that was supposed to 
increase the standards of cargo security. But just recently, the General Accounting Office said that the 
enforcement of the new rules for mail and other cargo should be improved by the FAA.<br>
<br>
As far as it is known, the FAA has taken no action. The fact is, say many experts, thorough scrutiny of all air 
cargo is impossible. Given as an example is just New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport -- in 1994, 
1.4 million tons worth $86 billion was shipped out of that airport on cargo and passenger planes. That's just one 
major airport.<br>
<br>
Charlie LeBlanc, the operations manager of a Houston consulting firm, Air Security International, is also the 
former manager of cargo security with Continental Airlines. He said of airline cargo security today, &quot;I think it's a 
huge loophole.&quot; LeBlanc explained that commerical cargo on a Boeing 747 is usually placed in the front cargo 
hold. Passenger luggage is placed in the rear hold.<br>
<br>
Explaining how commercial shipments are handled by the air forwarders, Leblanc said, &quot;If somebody walks up 
to an airline cargo desk and says I want to ship this box to London, they will be questioned and their package 
would be opened and inspected and possibly held fro 48 hours. If I'm somebody that walks up and says, 'I'm 
with XYZ Company,' and that company has shipped with them in the past, those checks and balances would 
not take place nine times out of ten.&quot;<br>
<br>
Even if a possible terrorist wanted to go about his plot of placing a bomb inside a legitimate package, it would 
not be difficult. All he would have to do is establish credibility with a known shipper for a few months.<br>
<br>
Ken Jones is the director of operations with Air Cargo, Inc. A large, well-known company that handles ground 
shipping for airlines. Jones said, &quot;It's a pretty touchy situation to deal with, but everybody is mindful of the need 
for increased security. The question is, 'How do we go about doing something without economically crippling 
the industry?'&quot;<br>
<br>
As of right now, security for the nation's 1,200 to 1,500 air forwarders takes a two-prong approach. The FAA 
requires all of the freight shipping companies to submit a security plan. They are to certify that their employees 
have undergone criminal background checks. The FAA then provides the airlines with a list of approved air 
shipping companies.<br>
<br>
It is unfortunate, but there would appear to be a number of ways that this security system can be defeated. We 
will not even touch upon the U.S. Postal Service, here.<br>
<br>
ENN has been looking to see what the impact would be if U.S. airlines were to adopt the security approach of 
Israel's El Al Airlines. El Al's security program is acknowledged as the best in the world. But U.S. airline 
industry insiders say that El Al can accomplish their plan because they are, by American standards, a small 
airline. While security at U.S. airlines certainly can be improved, it appears that they may be unable to duplicate 
the same level of safeguards as the renowned Israeli airline.<br>

<H2>IAFF Call For Federal Investigation of Firefighter Deaths </H2>

The president of the International Association of Firefighters
(IAFF) has asked the federal government to investigate the deaths
of two Chesapeake, Virginia, firefighters, who were killed while
battling a fire in an auto parts store on 18 March.
<P>

The IAFF president has asked for an investigation by the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).  A preliminary
investigation into the deaths of firefighters Frank Young and John
Hudgins, Jr. has indicated that the Chesapeake Fire Department
administration violated federal and state safety regulations known
as the "two-in, two-out rule."
<P>

Those regulations require that firefighters can only enter a 
burning building in teams of no less than two, and that there
are no less than two firefighters remaining outside, prepared
and equipped to account for and to rescue those firefighters
who are inside of the fire building.  The two-man standby
rescue team must be present prior to the entry of the firefighters
into the burning building and throughout the entire portion of
the interior attack.
<P>

IAFF General President Alfred K. Whitehead said, "Our preliminary
findings show that the two-in, two-out regulations were not
followed at the tragic March 18 incident, and, in fact, it appears
that the fire department administration has routinely ignored
these important safety procedures in the past."
<P>

Whitehead said that he was shocked at the lack of accountability
and poor communications at the fire scene.  He said, "The whole
point of these long-standing OSHA regulations is to make sure
that if firefighters risking their lives inside a burning building
are accounted for at all times, and that trained personnel are
standing by to rescue them immediately, if necessary.  in this
incident, we had two firefighters down inside the building, with
no stand-by team ready to rescue them, and no one even knew about
their situation until it was too late."
<P>

The IAFF president added, "In any fire department, the fire chief
and his chief officers have a responsibility to establish and
enforce regulations and procedures on firefighter safety.  NIOSH
will conduct an impartial and comprehensive investigation to
determine whether the fire administration complied with these and
other safety regulations."
<P>

In summing up, Whitehead said, "The IAFF initiated the federal
investigation because firefighters Young and Hudgins were members
of the IAFF and we want to make sure there is no retaliation
against local union members.  Our objective is to make sure a
similar tragedy doesn't occur again in Chesapeake or anywhere else."

IN BALL OF FLAMES</strong></font><font size=6><strong> </strong></font><strong><br>
By: Clark Staten, EMT-P </strong></font></p>
<p>New York, NY - (ENN) Yesterday at approximately 9:30 p.m. EST, a US Air Fokker-28 (Flt. 405) with 51 
persons onboard took-off from NYC's La Guardia airport for Cleveland on a continuation of a flight returning 
vacationers and business people from Florida. Unfortunately, it never had a chance to arrive in Ohio. An eyewitness, 
who lives near the airport, described what happened as &quot;lighting up his living room&quot; as a &quot;huge fireball&quot; engulfed the 
plane. </p>
<p>Another eyewitness described the plane as &quot;somersaulting&quot; as it tumbled through the top of an airport building and 
slid into the freezing waters of nearby Flushing Bay. A large fire ensued in the rear portion of the plane and it 
disintegrated on impact. Rescue officials said that it was still burning moments later when the first NYC Fire and 
EMS vehicles arrived on the scene. Large amounts of fire- retardant foam were then applied to the still burning 
wreck, as firefighters and paramedics threw up roof ladders to attempt to gain access to the entrapped victims. </p>
<p>Initial reports by NYC Fire Department spokeman Jerry Sanford indicated that the scene looked like &quot;something out 
of a Steven Spielberg movie&quot;. A NYC Port Authority Police officer, Charles Torres, was quoted as saying &quot;It's 
chaos...It's controlled chaos...but we think we're prepared for it&quot;. Another Port Authority airport worker was aghast, 
and was quoted by USA Today as saying; &quot;I've never seen anything like this before...there were bodies...six or 
seven bodies...I saw them laying them next to the plane&quot;. </p>
<p>As Emergency Medical Service (EMS) workers rushed to set up a Triage and Treatment area, divers from the NYC 
Police Emergency Services Unit and New York City Fire Department suited up in &quot;Exposure Dive Suits&quot; in order to 
allow them to enter the near freezing water of the Flushing Bay. According to EMS workers at the scene, several 
people had escaped the wreckage on their own and were wandering around the crash site in a dazed and shocked 
condition. Police helicopters and Port Authority boats were seen scanning the bay for &quot;swimmers&quot;, or those that 
might have been thrown clear of the wreckage. </p>
<p>Many of the persons rescued by emergency workers were suffering smoke inhalation and burns. According to 
official reports, the pilot of the plane was &quot;crushed&quot;, entrapped, and submerged under water in the cockpit of the 
fuselage of the plane. He was unable to be rescued. The co-pilot was saved and transported to one of three area 
hospitals, where he is hospitalized in serious, but stable condition. </p>
<p>A total of twenty-eight (28) patients were transported to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan, Elmhurst Hosptial and 
Booth Memorial Hospital in the Queens. Several patients were said to have suffered extensive burns and were being 
transfgered to specialized burn care units for treatment. At least one patient was said to have suffered an amputation 
of a limb and was undergoing surgery to attempt to sustain his life. </p>
<p>Rescue efforts were reported to have gone on until early morning hours, when rising tides and hypothermia caused 
rescue supervisors to pospone further attempts at recovery until the morning light. Several rescuers were reportedly 
being treated for cold injuries and hypothermia, as bodies were still being pulled from the frigid water after three and 
a half hours (3 1/2). Rescuers were also said to have suffered many minor lacerations from metal edges, as they 
worked to remove people from the shredded portions of the fuselage, which were described as &quot;being like razors&quot;. </p>
<p>Investigators from the NYC Police Department, Port authority, Fire Department, National Transportation Safety 
Board and the Federal Aviation Administration were reportedly combing the wreckage at first light, attempting to 
help establish the exact cause of the tragic crash. One official said that the scene reminded him of a similar incident 
that had occured on the same runway in 1989, when US Air Flt. 5050 aborted a takeoff and crashed into the East 
River. Two people died from that incident and another 45 were injuried. </p>

Domestic Terrorism Strikes AMTRAK
<BR>
By: Paul Anderson, Metro Correspondent
<BR>
<P>
Chicago, IL, October 9, 1995 -- In what appears to be another
devastating act of domestic terrorism, an Amtrak train has been
derailed near Hyder, Arizona.  Maricopa County, AZ. Sheriff
Joseph Arpiao says that the derailment wasn't the result of an
accident and that they have seized evidence that the tracks had
been tampered with. Another report from the Sheriff's office
says that a warning system designed to warn train crews about
dangerous tracks had been disabled. A third report from the
Amtrak officials says that as many as twenty-six (26) spikes had
been removed from the railbed, thus making it very unstable and
facilitating the derailment.
<P>

According to Emergency medical Services (EMS) officials, one
person was killed in the derailment and at least another
seventy-eight (78)people were injured.  At least ten (10) of the
injured are reported to be in critical condition at several
Phoenix area hospitals.  Several were described by paramedics
and deputies as having "crushing injuries" and borken bones.  At
least two patients had suffered severe head and chest injuries.
Most were removed from the remote accident scene by helicopter
and flown to trauma centers.
<P> 

Two typewritten letters were reportedly found at the scene by
passengers and turned over to law enforcement agencies. They
were was allegedly addressed to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) and to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. They talked about the attack being "pay-back" for
the events of Waco and at Ruby Ridge. The letters were signed by
an unknown group called the "Sons of the Gestapo", an obvious
reference to Hitler's W.W.II secret police and a possible link
to a neo-nazi organization.
<P>

Sources close to the investigation say that no explosives were
used to derail the train, but that it would appear to be an "act
of sabotage".  They say that the saboteurs had a knowledge of
both railroad procedures, the vulnerabilities of the trackbed,
and railway warning systems.  Reportedly, the removal of the
ties and a widening of the tracks was done in such a way to
cause the train to derail just as it approached an overpass that
covered a ravine.  As the train derailed, several cars tumbled
into that ravine.  A veteran railroad worker, who has worked on
Chicago Northwestern tracks for more than 20 years told ENN,
"whoever did this, they knew what they were doing."
<P>

Clark Staten, Executive Director of the Emergency Response &
Research Institute (ERRI) said that the fact that the tracks
weren't actually "blown up" does not mean that this wasn't an
act of "domestic terrorism."  The tactics used, according to
Staten, could be indicative of military or terrorist
training of the perpetrators. "This type of derailment is a
common tactic, taught in Ranger or Special forces courses, for
soldiers of both the United States and many other countries."
Staten added. "In wartime, this kind of act is used to halt the
movement of troop trains or vital supplies."  You can also read
about it in a number of "survivalist" and other books that
describe special forces or underground types of tactics.
<P>

Speculation as to the perpetrators has centered, thus far, on
connections with neo-nazi and white supremacist organizations
that are known to frequent Arizona and the Southwestern part of
the United States. Identification of the "Sons of the Gestapo"
has, however, proven illusive so far. Staten, in an exclusive
interview with Chicago's FOX-WFLD-Channel 32, that was aired
tonight at 9:00p.m., told reporter Kevin McCarty that the name
may be a fictitious "red herring" used to confuse law
enforcement agencies or that it is a name chosen just for this
operation. Staten said that a search of an extensive ERRI
counter-terrorist database and that of two other agencies has
produced no evidence of that name or a derivative thereof.
Another alternative involves the possible formulation of a new
terrorist group.  Staten told McCarty that terrorists often
engage in misinformation or misdirection, in order to attempt to
prevent detection and apprehension.
<P> 

"Several parts of the puzzle fit and could indicate a domestic
act carried out by neo-nazis or white supremacists...that
geographic area is rife with paramilitary groups and militia
members...and there is known animosity about Waco and Ruby Ridge
in some circles there", Staten added. "Other facts are
incongruent and could lead one to believe that it was carried
out by a disgruntled railroad worker...who had been passed over
for promotion or 'banished' to the Arizona desert", Staten
continued. "We just don't have enough hard evidence, at this
point in the investigation, to reach any firm conclusions....
but, certainly those that have done this...intended to maim or
kill a lot of people" Staten concluded.

<H2>Baltimore Firefighters Fight 12 Alarm Blaze</H2>
<P>
<BR>
By Steve Macko
<BR>
11/09/95 (ENN) --Firefighters in BALTIMORE, MARYLAND, fought a 
spectacular 11 Alarm fire at Hollins and Calverton in Baltimore's southwest
district.  At about 0010 EST, fire started in a 3-story brick vacant warehouse.  
The huge blaze was apparently started by some homeless people who were trying 
to keep warm.  The original fire building was fully involved and it 
was reported that firefighters encountered water problems.
<P>  
The fire reportedly communicated to three other large exposure buildings.  
All of the exposure buildings were described as warehouse-type buildings.  
One was described as being 10-stories and another was 6-stories.  One 
of the buildings was called the Hollins Street Exchange, which is a 
block-long complex that was occupied by 50 small businesses.  The original fire 
building, the 6-story and 10-story buildings were believed to be destroyed.
<P>  
The third exposure building was well involved with fire through the roof.  
It took Baltimore firefighters about seven hours to bring this blaze under 
control.  Baltimore Fire Chief Herman Williams said that this fire was
the largest in the city in recent memory.  Three firefighters suffered
minor injuries and mutual aid from Baltimore's suburbs was required.

<H2>EPIDEMIC OF COCAINE-RELATED EMERGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

A major study has found that medical emergencies from cocaine use in all forms dramatically increased in California during the mid-1980s, dropped in 1990, and then surged through 1994. Useage of the drug is still on the rise.  More seriously ill drug-users are found in San Francisco and its East Bay area than anywhere else in the state.
<P>

The study was conducted by the Public Statistics Institute in Irvine, California.  The PSI is highly respected and tracks health care and disease issues.  In 1995, the institute published a similar report on amphetamine use in California.
<P>

The report cited that thousands of cocaine users are going to hospital emergency rooms in record numbers every year.  These patients suffer from: brain hemorrhage, cardiac arrest, chest pain, seizures, shock, fever and acure paranoia.
<P>

According to the report, such emergencies are only "the tip of the iceberg."  There are said to be countless cases that "are often treated through primary care or drug treatment programs, or are simply not treated," the report said.
<P>

James K. Cunningham was the leader of the research team for the study.  He said that any trends that were uncovered in the report probably underestimate the actual numbers of emergencies caused by cocaine use.  This is because emergency room records may not account for all cocaine-related cases.  Cunningham said, "Cocaine continues to be a major public health issue in California.  We had hoped that the drop in emergency room admissions during 1990 signaled the end of the state's cocaine epidemic.  Instead, it was just a pause in a mounting health problem."
<P>

The study found that in 1985 there were 3,688 cocaine-related emergencies.  That number jumped to 10,660 in 1988.  In 1990, cocaine-related emergencies dropped to 7,545.  This decrease lasted only one year.  The numbers have climbed steadily to the record high of 13,496 in 1994, the last year that records were made available.
<P>

The statewide rate of cocaine-related emergencies was about 42 per 100,000 people in 1994.  San Francisco was 270 percent higher than the statewide average and nearby Alameda County was 108 percent higher.
<P>

The report also found that the number of blacks who were admitted for cocaine emergencies has soared.  In 1985, the rate of blacks admitted was 63.5 per 100,000.  In 1994, that number surged to 275 per 100,000.
<P>

Crack cocaine is said to be widespread in impoverished inner-city communities. Crack is also said to be far cheaper than powdered cocaine.  Since the 1980s, the price of cocaine has been, for the most part, declining.  The study said, "This may be encouraging heavy users to use more and encouraging occasional users to use more heavily."

<H3>DEVELOPMENTS IN ISRAELI SECURITY...</H3>
<P>
By Steve Macko
<P>
Since the tragic assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
the first political assassination in the 47-year history of the Jewish
state -- security has been unprecedently tightened.  There are many
examples in this new state of security awareness by the Shin Bet.
After a recent two-hour weekly cabinet meeting, reporters were kept
about 200 yards away -- previously, before the assassination,
reporters had always been allowed to interview departing cabinet ministers
when they emerged from a meeting.  But now, even before reporters were 
allowed to attend an official briefing by the cabinet secretary, they
had to wait until Acting-Prime Minister Shimon Peres's official car
pulled away.  Peres' automobile was preceded by a police car with red
lights flashing and siren sounding -- also something new.
<P>

The Israeli government recently gave its "full backing" to the Shin Bet.
The Acting-Prime Minister said to his cabinet that he did not know "a
better, more dedicated group of people ever ready to risk their lives."
Peres has been guarded by Shin Bet security personnel for a number of
years.  But there has been a special commission set up to inquire how
Shin Bet agents allowed 25-year-old Yigal Amir to get within a few feet
of Rabin and fire off three shots that killed the 73-year-old prime
minister and wound a bodyguard.
<P>

It is being said that the Shin Bet security detail is keeping a very
tight leash on Shimon Peres.  When Peres is out in public, a bodyguard
walks behind him and can be seen speaking into a hidden microphone in
his sleeve.  At a recent rally to dedicate Yitzhak Rabin Square, the
site of where Rabin was killed -- Peres did not attend this rally for
security reasons.  Again, this is something new to Israeli leaders
who had always felt safe mingling with the public.  Attacks by Arabs
had always been a high priority with Israeli security -- but these
new protective measures have gone into effect to provide protection from
possible Jewish assailants, as well.  Even though Peres did not attend the 
renaming ceremony of the square -- there was still about 2,000 police at 
the scene, including rooftop snipers.
<P>

How did this tiny country get to this point of now having to watch
for assassins from within ... rather than from assassins from historic
enemies?  A preliminary report from the Shin Bet security service,
released only four days after the assassination of Rabin said, "As a
result of defective planning and implementation ... the murderer
succeeded in approaching the prime minister to a fatal proximity."
As a result, four top Shin Bet officials were fired and/or reassigned.
<P>

The story of some of the miscues made by Rabin's security detail is
quite astonishing.  The driver of Rabin's armored Cadillac automobile
related about how, after being shot, Rabin was stretched across the
back seat bleeding.  The driver, Menachem Damti, had not been given any
previous getaway instructions in case of an emergency -- being given
such instructions should have been standard procedure.
<P>

With the prime minister mortally wounded, the dying man's bodyguard
screamed at Damti, "Drive!  Drive!"  Damti said that the quickest route
to the hospital was blocked by surging crowds.  Again, standard
procedure should had dictated an unobstructed exit for the prime minister's
car.  The urgent trip to get Rabin to a hospital was further hampered
by the desperate driver having to argue his way through a police
roadblock.  And when they finally did reach the hospital, no medical
teams were even ready for the medical emergency with a dying prime 
minister who had gaping gunshot wounds caused by bullets with hollow-points.
Nobody had called ahead to the hospital -- again, something that should
had been standard procedure.
<P>

In a recounting of that tragic Saturday evening in Tel Aviv, about
100,000 people had filled the square for the peace rally.  Hundreds
more reportedly watched from the top of nearby 8-story buildings that
surround the square.  The security was somewhat unusual.  Tight in
some areas and very lax in others.  Spotlights were brought in to
scan the nearby rooftops for potential snipers.  Some apartment units
had been physically searched.  Parking to area residents was limited.
Police presence was seemiingly everywhere.  That was the tight security.
The lax security was at the entrance of the stage area.  People entering
the area were not searched.  Many people reportedly were allowed to leave
and return without any kind of a check.
<P>

A security guard was asked why a man who only waved a small ID and
shouted, "It's okay, I was here before." was not properly checked.
The security guard said, "He's a Jew.  Why would he want to do any
harm?"  That was the attitude that showed a fatal flaw in Rabin's security.
<P>

Shimon Peres said that security was alert on that evening.  But they
were alert for a possible Arab attack ... not for an attack by a
Jewish radical.
<P>

Near the end of the rally and about ten minutes before the prime
minister was shot, a reporter remembers passing unchallenged within
only a few yards of Rabin's automobile, which was parked at the foot
of the staircase from the stage.
<P>

The assassin, Yigal Amir, was seen talking on a public phone only
ten yards from the prime minister's car, just before the shooting.
The assassin said that he was able to stay in the area during most
of the rally.  To reduce the chance of suspicion he had removed his
skullcap that he usually wore.  Amir remained close to Rabin's car.
It is believed that security personnel mistook him as a VIP driver.
<P>

Most people in the parking area were kept at only a minimum of five
yards away from the prime minister's car.  But many others were allowed
to stand next to the staircase that led to the stage.  Photos show
Shimon Peres shaking the hands of supporters as he walked down the
staircase.  Peres then talked briefly to Rabin's driver and then made
a decision that probably saved his life -- instead of waiting for
Rabin, Peres walked towards his car.  The assassin told investigators
that it was his plan to kill both Rabin and Peres.  But because
Peres had walked away, Amir decided to focus only on Rabin.
<P>

At 9:40 p.m. Prime Minster Rabin walked down the staircase.  He was
surrounded by at least eight bodyguards and police officers.  However,
there apparently was no human shield as he prepared to enter his awaiting
Cadillac.  There was only one bodyguard.  The other two bodyguards
who are supposed to form the "inner circle" around the prime minister 
had walked around to the other side of the car.  As Rabin was just
entering the auto, the assassin approached him from the rear, apparently
not seen by either the bodyguard or Rabin and began firing with a 9mm
Berretta from less than two feet away.
<P>

The Prime Minister suffered two gunshot wounds.  One to the abdomen and
the other to the chest.  Apparently the shot that caused the stomach
wound hit him from the back.  One shot struck a bodyguard as he struck
Amir's arm.  The bodyguard then threw Rabin and himself into the armored
car and the driver sped away.
<P>

The driver of Rabin's car, Damti, at first did not realize that Rabin
had been wounded.  He asked the prime minister if he was injured.  Rabin
replied, "Yes," and whispered that he had pain in his back and also
said that it was "not too bad," before losing consciousness.
<P>

The hospital that Rabin was taken to is very close to site of the
rally.  Less than 1,000 yards away.  But because of the thousands of
people who attended the rally blocked the quickest route to Ichilov
Hospital, valuable time was lost.  The driver was forced to take a
route that was considerably longer.  More precious time was lost
trying to talk their way through a police roadblock and acquiring a
police escort.
<P>

The medical personnel at Ichilov Hospital were not alerted to expect
a shooting victim.  When Damti stopped the car at the gate of the
hospital, he had to explain what happened and then assisted the wounded
bodyguard and a police officer to carry Rabin into the emergency room.
Upon entering, Damti shouted, "The prime minister's wounded, take care
of him!"  The nurse who is in charge recognized that the victim was the
prime minister and called for all available doctors.  Rabin was
unconcious and did not have a pulse upon first examination.  Doctors
later said that Rabin only had a slight chance of survival after he
had been hit.
<P>

After a preliminary review, the Shin Bet security service acknowledged
that there had be an intelligence failure and had advance knowledge that
there was a plot to kill Rabin.  Shin Bet said that a friend of Amir's
had provided authorities with a very accurate description of Amir after
being told plans of Amir's intentions to kill the prime minsister by a
mutual friend.  Shin Bet did what was considered a very superficial
check on the information and then decided to ignore it.
<P>

Most top officials in the Israeli government have now been given
24-hour protection and now must coordinate their every move in 
advance with their security details.  And most of these government
officials don't like that.  In the past, as it was in the United States
before the assassination of President Kennedy, successful politicians
like to jump into crowds and mingle with the people -- potential voters.
In the U.S. the president would ride in a parade in an open car.  Doing
things such as that are a security detail's nightmare.  Especially,
in today's world.  So most of these government officials in Isreal are
having a difficult time adjusting to the idea of having security.
<P>

One particular unhappy Israeli official, the Secretary-General of the
ruling Labor Party, Nissim Zvilli, said in exasperation, "We simply
can't live with this.  It's a very serious problem.  They must find a
middle way."  The secretary-general must realize that it is a serious
problem for the security detail just to keep their charges safe from
harm.  Some charges have been holy-terrors for their protectors.  There
are famous stories of President Harry S Truman who would just grab his
hat and go out for a walk onto the streets of Washington whenever he
felt the urge.  And he didn't forewarn the Secret Service.  He'd just
go and the Secret Service agents would just have to chase him.  Some
people would say it was a different and safer world in those days, but
many people forget that there was a very serious attempt upon the life
of President Truman on November 1, 1950.
<P>

As the U.S. Secret Service did after the assassination of President
Kennedy, Shin Bet is now implementing unprecedented security precautions
on the people that they are charged with protecting.  In fact, after
the attempted assassination of President Reagan, the U.S. Secret Service
again increased the level of security afforded to the president.  So,
Shin Bet is responding in the only way that they know how and their
charges are going to have to adjust to the realities of today's world --
there are people out there wishing to bring them harm.
<P> 

One Israeli cabinet minister complained that the new security precautions
have "changed our lives."  Shimon Peres is now being asked to wear a
bulletproof vest during public appearances.  Police and IDF units now
patrol near the homes of officials who are determined to be a special
risk.  Security details have been assigned to Cabinet minister's homes
at night -- this was never done before.  Before the assassination of
Rabin, bodyguards were rarely assigned to Cabinet ministers and very
rarely ever assigned to their homes.
<P>

But Shin Bet has very good reasons for the increase of security.  Acting-
Prime Minister Shimon Peres has received several death threats since
he has become the head of the government.  What is surprising is that
these threats are coming from radical Jews and not so much from Arabs.
It is being said that the protection of Peres is of the utmost paramount
importance, because should there be another political assassination in
Israel the result would not be another week of mourning but civil strife.
<P>

But still some officials are not really appearing to understand the
security situation.  Israeli President Ezer Weizman has stated that
he will refuse the new security restrictions that are being recommended
by Shin Bet.  Weizman said that he will not ride in an armored vehicle
and has every intention of mixing in crowds of people, like he has always
done.  President Weizman has this attitude because in the past he has 
always had a seemingly good rapport with people -- even through the
political tensions and difficulites Israel has experienced since signing
the peace accord with the PLO.  On a security standpoint, the president
is not being realistic.  Anyone is a target -- including the Pope.
<P>

Some other signs of increased security in Israel were at a recent meeting
of the Israeli Labor Party's central committee.  The meeting was held at
a rented hall.  Long portions of streets that led to the hall were
blocked off by police.  Anyone entering the area were checked.  Anyone
going into the hall had to pass through three security checkpoints and
had to pass through metal detectors.  Some people, including committee
members were frisked.
<P>

That's the reality of today's world.  It's new to the Israelis, but they
will have to adjust -- just as Americans had to adjust when entire
American expressways are closed off to traffic so that the President's
or Vice-President's car could have the entire expressway to himself.
It's very, very inconvenient ... but necessary to protect the life of a chief executive.

<H2>Bomb Attacks in City Centers</H2>
<BR>

By TIMOTHY HILLIER
<BR>
Chief Superintendent Hillier serves in the Operational Support
<BR>
Department of the City of London Police, London, England.
<BR>
<HR>
Massive explosions in London, New York, and other major cities
worldwide clearly demonstrate that important financial districts
have become prestigious targets for terrorist organizations,
regardless of their motives. In addition to causing significant
loss of life, these bombs can severely disrupt trade and economic
transactions. Further, modern satellite communications broadcast
grisly bomb scene images around the world within minutes, adding
to the lure of this type of target for groups seeking media
publicity.
<P>

The primary law enforcement objective must be to keep such   
incidents from occurring. However, as vividly revealed in London
and New York, a democratic society with freedom of movement makes
prevention difficult, at best. Therefore, police departments must
be prepared to deal with the aftermath of bomb detonations in
highly concentrated business districts to reduce deaths and
injuries, to preserve the crime scene, to investigate the crime
successfully, and to help local businesses recover quickly from
the damage.
<P>

While the device detonated in New York's World Trade Center
caused substantial problems, the injuries and damage undoubtedly
would have been far worse and spread over a wider area if a
similar or larger device had exploded in the street at the same
time of day. Yet, the inevitable tightening of security within
buildings will make the street bomb more likely in the future.
<P>

Within the past 2 years, two massive bombs rocked the streets   
of London's financial district. Terrorists used a truck to
deliver the April 10, 1992, bomb that exploded in front of the
Baltic Exchange. Just over a year later and only 200 yards away,
a similar truck bomb exploded in front of Bishopsgate on April
24, 1993. Both devices contained homemade explosives consisting
of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and sugar ignited by a commercial
or military explosive, such as Semtex. Just as effective as
military explosives, home-made explosives require more to get the
same result. The bomb in Bishopsgate is estimated to have weighed
between 2 and 4 tons.
<P> 

Two aspects of the London explosions stand out: The scale of the
damage, especially the amount of glass broken over such  an
extensive area--more than 400 meters (437 yards) in each
direction--and the unpredictability of the blasts. The City of
London Police learned lessons by dealing with these detonations
that can help other cities prepare for such attacks. This article
discusses how law enforcement can develop contingency plans for
bomb incidents and prepare the business community for such a  
possibility.
<P>

<HR>
<B>DESIGNING A CONTINGENCY PLAN</B>

When creating a contingency plan, police departments should take
into account evacuation plans, pre- and post-bomb cordons, other
emergency services, and changing bomb scene objectives. A
thorough, well-rehearsed plan for coping with the aftermath of a
detonation can help cities to reduce the devastating effects of a
bomb, ensure maximum public safety, and return rapidly to       
normality.
<P>

<I>Deciding Whether to Evacuate</I>
<BR>

When dealing with bombs in the street, London police previously
had  advised evacuation of the area in the face of a realistic
bomb threat. However, significant problems prompted a revision of
this advice. Difficulty in locating the bomb, the possibility of
secondary devices (designed to attack police and placed where the
terrorist believes police will rendezvous), unreliability of
warnings (if given), unpredictability of detonation time, and the
dangers of flying glass and debris make it prudent to include 
the option of not evacuating onto the street. After all, what is
the point of evacuating people onto the street only to expose
them to substantial injuries from flying glass, shrapnel, and
falling masonry?
<P>

Instead, evacuation to previously identified safe areas within
buildings away from glass, such as in basements, should be
considered. This option proved itself when the Bishopsgate device
was detonated, and persons near the explosion evacuated to a
subbasement. Although shaken, occupants of the building sustained
no serious injuries. In addition, experience has shown that a
total collapse of buildings is unlikely, even for those
structures close to the device.
<P>

Clearly, though, a direct threat to a building itself or a device 
planted within a building, as opposed to on the street, requires
evacuation. It must be emphasized that only qualified structural
engineers can give advice about safe areas. Not every building
will have a suitable area, either in terms of safety or
sufficient capacity, so evacuation planners should designate
additional or alternate sites, if possible.
<P>

<HR>
<I>Pre-Bomb Cordons</I>
<BR>

Plans should be designed for both pre- and post-bomb cordons
because the requirements differ. Pre-bomb plans assume the luxury
of prior knowledge of the device, either through its discovery or
a warning. Because warnings can be unreliable, extreme caution
should be exercised. For example, London police received a
warning about the Baltic Exchange bomb, but the tipster
incorrectly placed it one-quarter of a mile from its actual
location.
<P>

In the London Police Department's experience, large car bombs in
the street require a minimum cordon of 400 meters (437 yards), or
more than the length of four football fields. An explosion can
cause injuries and damage even beyond this distance, so everyone
should exercise caution near the perimeter. Considering this
scale in the center of any city, the enormous difficulties
encountered with pre-bomb cordons become apparent.
<P>

Occupants of the danger zone should be warned immediately so they
may seek a safer location. Yet, to effectively warn the vast
number of people in a large business area poses an insurmountable
problem to police because people are bound to be missed. However,
improvements in the warning mechanisms that require minimum input
from police to reach the maximum area can help. The City of
London Police has implemented two new warning systems--one
high-tech and one surprisingly traditional.
<P>

First, the city established a dedicated pager system to warn
people simultaneously throughout the city. Building managers or
security officers can rent pagers that receive messages from
police about suspected bombs. The messages indicate the device's
location and size, if known, so that the recipients know whether
their building is at risk and what precautionary measures to
take.
<P>

Second, officers on the beat carry whistles again. Radios had
replaced whistles some time ago, but when police tried to shout
warnings to pedestrians, everyone ignored them. The loud,
piercing sound of whistles, however, attracts attention and
reaches farther, enabling more people to hear the warning.
<P>

<HR>
<I>Post-Bomb Cordons</I><BR>

The chaotic aftermath of a bomb presents a different set of
considerations. Damage from bomb explosions usually covers a vast
area, necessitating both inner and outer cordons.
<P>

The outer cordon marks the farthest extent of the damage and
serves safety and security purposes. After the blast, tons of
glass fall and continue to fall, often from great heights,
presenting the most hazardous effect of the explosion. For
example, at the Baltic Exchange bomb site, workers cleared 500
tons (1 million pounds) of glass shards and debris from the
street. Glass and fragmentation cause most of the injuries, and
therefore, should be foremost in the minds of those responsible
for preparing contingency plans.
<P>

Several other factors impact the placement of the outer cordon.
In addition to the street-level destruction, damage occurs to
underground railway systems, electric and gas lines, sewer and
water pipes, and telecommunications systems, either as a result
of the initial blast or the subsequent ground shock. Vibrations
from subway trains and from aircraft passing nearby can dislodge
debris, adding to the hazards of the bomb scene, as could weather
conditions. In terms of security, many offices, shops, banks,
jewelers, etc., are blown open and become easily accessible to
thieves.
<P>

The inner cordon marks the most severely damaged area and the
crime scene. Officers must determine the extent of the crime
scene as quickly as possible so that it can be preserved
properly. As soon as it is considered safe, police must search
this area thoroughly to recover bomb and vehicle parts and as
much other evidence as possible. Of course, detectives may find
some parts of the bomb outside of the crime scene area as well.
<P>
<HR>
<I>Emergency Services Coordination</I><BR>

The whole thrust of the response must be multiagency
coordination, with all components (police, fire fighters, rescue
workers, public works officials, and structural engineers)
working in unison toward one goal--restoring normality. In the
United Kingdom, the initial response to all such incidents, from
train wrecks to bomb explosions, is the same, although the
demands on the agencies will vary according to the different
scenarios.
<P>

For every incident, the police control and coordinate the
response, from initially ensuring public safety through the final
stages of investigation. Not trained or equipped to fight fires,
deal with casualties, or advise on structural safety, the police
must assist those who perform these duties. Regular meetings of
all agencies working at the scene ensure that everyone works in
unison.
<P>

Bomb scenes in the city immediately become hard-hat areas because
of the damaged buildings. As a safety measure, all emergency    
services need to work under the advice of the local authority
structural engineer, in coordination with the police. Use of
heavy equipment to clear streets and shore up buildings should
not occur until approved by local authority engineers. If these
individuals are not readily available, recovery from the incident
most likely will take much longer.
<P>

Fire and rescue teams must be able to access the area
immediately. Therefore, although not a first priority, police
must handle the traffic situation quickly, establishing alternate
routes to ensure that emergency services can get to and from the
scene and the hospitals.
<P>

As the dust settles, tremendous pressure comes from business
owners to return to their premises as soon as possible. Indeed,
in the zone between the inner and outer cordons, i.e., outside of
the crime scene but inside the damaged area, the main aim should
be for the  dislocated tenants to resume responsibility for their
own office space. To limit chaos at the scene, officials must
plan carefully for the tenants' return and work closely with
other services, taking into consideration safety and crime scene
demands.
<P>
<HR>

<B>Changing Objectives</B><BR>
Primary concerns are to rescue casualties, to set up cordons, to
evacuate everyone from within the inner and outer cordons, to
preserve the inner cordon as a crime scene, and to institute
traffic diversions. Yet, these objectives change as the incident
gradually comes under control.
<P>

The emphasis shifts to making buildings safe and clearing the
streets, minimizing cordons, minimizing traffic diversions, and
returning tenants to their premises. As the objectives are
achieved, the requirements for emergency services at the scene
will be reduced. The area can be handed over gradually to  city
administrators to organize the structural recovery and to service
the needs of the community for alternative accommodations,
interim communications systems, etc. Contingency plans should
prepare for the changing concerns in order to help make the
transition safely and efficiently.
<P>
<HR>

<B>PREPARE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY</B><BR>

While local authorities must be prepared to respond to bomb
incidents, so should businesses that could be affected. Police,
in conjunction with local authorities, should educate business
owners and building managers and help them to develop individual
contingency plans. Establishments located in potential target
areas should prepare and practice contingency plans to deal with
both pre-bomb and post-bomb incidents. Businesses should be made
aware that film on windows and properly designed net curtains
provide added protection and may reduce injuries.
<P>

Many emergency requirements apply to incidents other than bombs,
such as fires, but it is critical to stress the differences as
well. For example, there must be no confusion that fire
procedures will always require evacuation, whereas bomb plans
might not. Major problems will be encountered in moving the large
number of people who occupy modern buildings, and these
difficulties should be taken into account during the development
of contingency plans.
<P>

Organizations (including emergency services providers) also need
to consider the potential effect on their businesses if they are
unable to use their premises for 1 or 2 days, a week, or maybe
never. For example, contingency plans and computerized systems
need to be stored or to have a backup at least one-half mile
away. Security arrangements, identification of key personnel,
telephone requirements, interim office space needs, and
arrangements for contractors to make repairs and replace
shattered windows all should be considered ahead of time to
facilitate quick response to an explosion. By educating and
working with the business community before a bombing takes place,
police departments can help to make the response to such an
incident run more smoothly, reducing casualties and minimizing
the time required to restore order.
<P>
<HR>

<B>PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE</B><BR>

The need to practice planned responses to bomb incidents cannot
be overemphasized. In addition to the citywide plan, each of the
emergency services must have its own contingency plan, which must
be practiced, coordinated, and kept up-to-date.
<P>

These plans should include alternatives in the event that
buildings housing the emergency services themselves (e.g., fire
stations, police precincts, and hospitals) are damaged or
destroyed. Just as businesses should prepare for being unable to
use their premises, so should  emergency response teams. Routine
evaluation and revision of the city's contingency plan, as well
as coordinated practice drills, should be scheduled.
<P>
<HR>
<B>CONCLUSION</B><BR>

All major incidents are demanding and stressful for both
organizations and the individuals. This particularly applies to
bombs, because they represent a deliberate effort to kill, maim,
and cause the maximum damage, disruption, and cost. With
appropriate planning and training, casualties can be reduced, and
the main priority--restoring normality--can be achieved more
efficiently and quickly.

<B>Elements of an Explosion</B><BR>

<I>Blast</I><BR>

Air being propelled at tremendous force and speed creates an
over-pressure traveling outward in all directions away from the
source for great distances.
<P>

<I>Augmented Pressure</I><BR>

The pressure wave, reflected and channeled by the design of
buildings and layout of streets. This causes the pressure effect
to last longer and can increase structural damage.
<P>

<I>Fragmentation</I><BR>

Any item that is part of or near to the bomb when it explodes
becomes a projectile. The larger the explosive charge, the
farther the fragments will travel. Fragments normally travel in a
straight line but, like a bullet, can also be deflected.
<P>

<I>Secondary Fragmentation</I><BR>

This occurs as the blast over-pressure hits and breaks
structures, e.g., windows, doors, collapse of false ceilings,
office equipment, etc.
<P>

<I>Partial Vacuum</I><BR>

Return to normal pressure. At this stage, windows not destroyed
by the initial blast may be sucked out.
<P>

<I>Ground Shock</I><BR>

The transmission through the ground of the blast wave pressure.
This causes problems with gas, water, electricity, sewers,
telecommunications, etc., and may also cause structural damage to
the foundations of buildings and subway systems.
<P>

(The density and height of buildings, the width of streets, the
size of the device, the time of day the device is detonated, and
whether a warning has been received exacerbate the effects of the
explosion.)

<H2>Commuter Trains Collide in Secaucus, NJ; Three Dead, 150 Injured</H2>
By: Clark Staten
<P>
ENN is receiving numerous reports of a commuter train crash in Secaucus, NJ.  The crash reportedly occurred at approx. 08:40EST this morning.  According to Dan Jerrard of UMDNJ, numerous mutual aid Fire and EMS services are either enroute or on the scene of the head-on crash.
<P>
At least three people are reported dead in the accident, and more than 150 are injured. Several people had to be extricated from the mangled wreakage. Rescue efforts were complicated by the fact that the accident and derailment occurred in a swampy area with no immediately accessable roads.  A State police helicopter did respond, and landed in a nearby area. Firefighters and paramedics then hand-carried two critical patients to the copter, by transversing a thirty foot embankment.  At least 73 patients were reported taken to a number of hospitals by various EMS units
<P>
According to a Jersey City emergency dispatcher, an EMS ambulance that was responding to the train crash was involved in a "head-on" accident with a school bus. Both EMT's from the ambulance were seriously injured with possible fractures.  Both were taken to Jersey City Medical Center trauma center. The number of injuries on the bus, if any, is unknown at this time.
<P>
New Jersey Govenor Christy Whitman reportedly also responded by helicopter to the scene, which is located four miles west of New York City and near both Jersey City and Hoboken.  Several key commuter trains are reportedly shut down and thousands of commuters are stranded by the blocked rail lines.
<P>
No cause for the accident has been established, and a Jersey City Police Capt. told ENN that a major investigation is ensueing.

<H2>Massive Police Campaign to Stop Crime in Chester, PA</H2>
<P>
CHESTER, PENNSYLVANIA (ENN) - The Pennsylvania State Police will begin periodic patrols in the city of Chester on Saturday.  This is part of a campaign to reduce crime in the city of 41,000 people. On Thursday, a large number of police, state and federal law enforcement agents ascended on the city and made about forty arrests.
<P>

The Delaware County District Attorney said, "We wanted to let everyone know that street-corner dealers won't be tolerated in Chester."
<P>

A State Police captain said that the state troopes will not patrol in Chester every day, but will spend a substantial amount of time in the city.  About 12 Chester Police officers are usually assigned to a shift.  The addition of the state troopers will double that number.
<P>

Chester for the last several years has had the highest crime rate in the State of Pennsylvania.  The police sweep on Thursday involved 117 officers and agents.

<TITLE>Stop "Futile" Resuscitations</TITLE>

JAMA STUDIES CALL FOR PARAMEDICS TO STOP "FUTILE" TREATMENT</H3>
<BR><IMG SRC="/C-P-R.GIF">

By Clark Staten, EMT-P, I/C
<BR>
<P>
Chicago, IL -  Two studies published in the Journal of the
American Medical Association (JAMA) say that paramedics
should be allowed to discontinue Cardio-Pulmonary
Resuscitation (CPR) and other advanced life support
procedures when faced with a cardiac arrest patient that
doesn't respond to aggressive care.  Primary reasons cited by
the study include economic efficiency and more appropriate
use of limited emergency medical care resources.
<P>

According to one JAMA study, the cost of "futile"
resuscitations has risen to approximately one billion dollars
($1,000,000,000) per year.  This figure includes the costs of
paramedics, ambulances, nurses, doctors, emergency room
supplies, and intensive care costs for people who never live
to leave the hospital.  The report shows that this enormous
cost is the result of attempting to resuscitate patients who
have suffered serious brain and heart damage and can only
exist through "heroic" measures such as respirators,
pacemakers, and heart-lung machines.
<P>
Secondary in consideration is the fact that prolonged
resuscitation of patients in asystole (no viable electrical
activity in the heart) takes valuable community resources
from those that could actually benefit from the efforts of
paramedics and other emergency medical care providers. One of
the studies reported that a single cardiac arrest patient may
require as much as an hour or more of paramedic's time, two
hours of nursing time, and an hour of emergency physician
time. In many communities, the number of paramedics and
Mobile Intensive Care Unit (M.I.C.U.) ambulances is extremely
limited.  Often, paramedics working on "hopeless"
resuscitative procedures cannot respond to other calls where
their presence could make a life-saving difference.
<P>

Third, doctors say that the policy of "declaring the patient
dead at the scene" will help to safeguard emergency
responders who are often hurt while bouncing around the back
of a speeding ambulance while enroute to the hospital for the
patient to be pronounced "legally dead" by an emergency
physician.  Doctors say that little is gained by rapid
transport of a non-viable person upon whom aggressive
resuscitative measures have already been undertaken. In fact,
this practice may put additional people at risk for little
benefit.
<P>

The doctors warn, however, that the idea of discontinued
resuscitative efforts must be part of a paramedic system that
includes only the "best" Emergency Medical Service (EMS)
providers, (EMT-Paramedics) who have received competent
training and have adequate radio/telephone communication with
an experienced emergency physician.  They cautioned that
lessor trained or uninitiated paramedics or EMTs must
continue to provide CPR and transport even questionable
patients to the nearest appropriate hospital.
<P>

Fears have been raised by some physicians that less capable
paramedics will mistakenly not resuscitate patients with
hypothermia, drug abuse, extremely low heart rates, or other
conditions that may mimic death.  At least one case has occured
in New York City, involving a woman who was suffering from
hypothermia, that was not correctly diagnosed by Emergency
Medical Technicians (EMTs).  She was found alive by a coroner's
office worker after being "left for dead" by the ambulance.
These types of conditions have been specifically excluded by
the JAMA studies as causes for non-resuscitation.
<P>

Other observers have suggested that paramedics, in general,
are not adequately trained to make such important decisions.
But, Dr. Paul Pepe of the Houston, TX and author of one
JAMA study, disagrees and is quoted in USA Today as saying,
"It's about time we all start doing this formally . . . this
is a universal, aggressive, attempt to save everybody . . . but
if they don't respond to treatment . . . they don't respond".
Supporters of the policy point to EMS systems in Seattle,
Pittsburgh, Milwaukee and Houston, where the concept has
proved to be feasible.
<P>

The JAMA report says that the best opportunities for
successful resuscitations include fast access to emergency
dispatch systems (911), immediate initiation of effective
Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), rapid defibrillation of
fibrillating (uncontrolled quivering) hearts, good
oxygenation of brain and heart tissue, and administration of
appropriate medications to regulate the patient's heartbeat
and blood pressure.  Experts say that paramedic systems are
the most timely and cost effective way of providing these
essential services to those in greatest need.

<title>Fairness Required in Israel/PLO Dispute</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<body>
<p align=center><em><strong>ENN Editorial Comment-09/29/96</strong></em></p>
<p align=center><font size=5><strong>Fairness Required in Israeli/Palestinian Dispute</strong></font><br>
Editorial Opinion: By Clark Staten, ENN CEO and Publisher<br>
</p>
<p align=left>It is hard to imagine the position that Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyhu finds himself in today. Strategically and tactically 
speaking, his country has been surrounded and threatened by hostile forces in both Syria and Lebanon and is now suffering 
the internal throes of the latest Palestinian uprising.<br>
<br>
Politically speaking, Mr. Netanyhu was elected by a coalition of conservative and religious groups who did not agree with 
the past practices and agreements of the Peres and Rabin administrations. In fact, it was their intent to roll-back or resist as 
many of the provisions of the PLO peace accord as was feasibly possible.<br>
<br>
Now, faced with the most recent crisis of the &quot;Tourist Tunnel&quot; controversy, Netanyhu finds himself being criticized by both 
European and Mid-Eastern leaders and at a cross-road in PLO/Israeli relations. He must decide if political and security 
concerns out-weigh previous agreements made by the Israeli government. Most of all, Netanyhu and the Israeli people 
must decide if Israel is to continue on a course that may provide peace, in exchange for land that was paid for in Israeli 
blood in 1967 and 1973. <br>
<br>
The issues in this conflict are not clear cut, as they often are not in such geo-political struggles. But, in our opinion, at least 
five things should be given appropriate consideration in the coming days:<br>
<br>
<img src="Redball.gif" align=bottom width=20 height=15> The issue of the Jerusalem &quot;tourist tunnel&quot; is really inconsequential and should not be given such importance by the 
Palestinians or the media. It is a &quot;red herring&quot; used to incite violence and express PLO displeasure with Netanyhu's 
reluctance to move forward with a withdrawal of Hebron and further &quot;land for peace&quot; deals.<br>
<br>
<img src="Redball.gif" align=bottom width=20 height=15> Israel must live up to agreements that they have already made, including the Oslo accords. To do otherwise will 
undermine the standing of Israel in the world community and place the credibility of the Netanyhu administration in 
question. Regardless of internal political considerations, or disagreement with the actions of previous administrations, 
agreements already signed must be honored and the necessary actions taken to fulfill Israel's obligations. Most assuredly, 
the Netanyhu administration will decide about current and future agreements, but it is important that they honor the word of 
Israel from the past.<br>
<br>
<img src="Redball.gif" align=bottom width=20 height=15> The PLO must do everything within its power to end this latest rioting and discourage further violence. The current 
situation makes it appear that the PLO is involved in the use of terrorism, intimidation, and the threat of general unrest to 
press its demands for greater autonomy and control of more territories. The PLO's history of past involvement in terrorism 
and political violence should not give it the latitude to use a threat of further violence as a negotiating ploy.<br>
<br>
<img src="Redball.gif" align=bottom width=20 height=15> Israel must be assured by all parties of its internal security and borders. It must be allowed to protect itself in ways 
deemed necessary. The recent movement of Syrian and Hezbollah military forces, to the edges of the Israeli borders, did 
little to contribute to the peace process and probably contributed to the current unrest. In fact, they could appear to 
Netanyhu and his advisors as evidence of an orchestrated intimidation by Palestinians and their Islamic extremist 
supporters. Much could be accomplished to de-escalate current tensions, by the withdrawal of these antagonists.<br>
<br>
<img src="Redball.gif" align=bottom width=20 height=15> If the two sides actually want a just and lasting peace, it is suggested that purposeful multi-lateral talks be begun, at the 
earliest opportunity. Further, these talks should not be sponsored by countries with a direct geographic, political, or 
ideological interest in the conflict. A traditionally neutral country like Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, or Australia 
might be a good choice to mediate the talks. It is suggested that, due to ongoing political influences, that the United Nations 
may not be a suitable forum.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, it is our opinion at ERRI, that what is most needed right now is an end to the escalating rhetoric and 
posturing by all of the other countries that have interjected themselves into this debate. The issue can only be peacefully 
resolved by rational and amiable negotiations between the Palestinian people and Israeli people. After all, it is they who 
must live together after all the talking is done. <br>

<center><H2>Colombo Truck bomb Kills 55, 1,200 Injured</H2></center>
<center><B>By: Clark Staten, ERRI, Counter-Terrorist Analyst</B></center>
<P>

Chicago, IL, January 31, 1996 (ENN) -- In what is being described as
one of the bloodiest terrorist bombings in recent memory, a
truck bomb has exploded this morning, devastating the main
business district of the capital city of Colombo, Sri Lanka. The
immense detonation occurred at 10:45a.m. (0515GMT)and may have
been preceded by an exchange of gunfire between security forces
and the suicide bombers. According to Sri Lankan Heath Minister
A.H.M. Fowzie, 55 people were killed in the blast and another
1,200 injured, more than 100 of them seriously.
<P>

Eyewitnesses described the scene as one of total chaos, with
fires burning out of control and hundreds of people trapped by
flames, fallen debris and badly damaged buildings. The truck
that exploded was reportedly driven into the front of the
Central Bank Building, which manages all of the finances of the
country.  At least eight (8) other high-rise buildings were also
damaged or set ablaze by the explosion, which was called
"massive" by police personnel. Military sources said that they
believed that the "suicide truck" was loaded with as much as 440
lbs (200kg) of high explosives.
<P>

Rescuers were seen crawling through badly damaged cars and into
the fronts of smashed buildings, their walls ripped off by the
potent burst. The bodies of at least a dozen people were seen
lying in the street, many of them dead and disfigured by flying
glass and shrapnel generated by the bomb. Pools of blood were
seen everywhere. Small mercantile stands that sell cigarettes
and sundries, outside the bank building, bore much of the brunt
of the initial assault. Many of the dead and injured were
probably making small purchases there just moments before they
were killed. Soldiers, firefighters, and ambulance personnel
were still pulling wounded and disoriented people from the
rubble, hours after the detonation.  Some fires reportedly were
still burning eight (8) hours after the initial incident.
<P>

Although no one has claimed responsibility for the tragedy,
military and police experts are blaming the disaster on the
Liberation Tigers of the Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist group
that has been fighting for a independent homeland on the
Northeast corner of the island nation. The LTTE has allegedly
been responsible for dozens of attacks that have killed as many
as 50,000 people, during the past thirteen (13) year of conflict
with the central government. Brigadier General Sarath Munasinghe
of the Sri Lankan military told the Reuters News service, "It
has to be the Tamil Tigers...who else would have done such a
thing."
<P>

A counter-terrorist source, close to the bombing investigation,
told ENN that two suspects had been arrested shortly after the
blast, and that a enormous manhunt is now underway to find other
members of "the Tigers" who may have participated in the attack.
The purposely unidentified officer said that they believed that
three (3) insurgents were involved in the original shooting and
bombing incident.  News reports of a secondary device and
explosion have not been confirmed by police sources.  The
officer concluded his interview with ENN by saying that their
greatest fear is that this latest, and biggest, bomb is not the
end of violence in Sri Lanka. He said that unless the issues of
Tamil independence are resolved, or they are all killed or
captured...more bombs are likely to follow.

<B>**LEAD STORY**</B>
<H2>UNITED STATES TURNS UP THE HEAT ON IRAN ...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

In a speech to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, United States Secretary of State Warren Christopher, on Tuesday, said that there was growing evidence that the rogue state of Iran was using terrorism to undermine the Middle East peace process.  Christopher renewed a call to European allies to join the U.S. in imposing trade restrictions with the country that is known to sponsor international terrorism.
<P>

Christopher did not name, but did accuse an Iranian-backed group of conducting a drive-by shooting at a bus stop in Isreal last week that resulted in the death of an Isreali- American.
<P>

The Secretary of State said, "There should no longer be any debate about Iran's involvement in terrorism against the peace process.  The evidence has grown in recent months. In advance of Isreal's elections, Iranian-trained terrorists have been sent to infiltrate Isreal and the Palestinian territories.  Some have been intercepted.  Others narrowly failed in carrying out their deadly activities.  Still others have succeeded in their murderous missions.  We believe that an Iranian-backed group was responsible for last week's drive-by shooting of an Isreali-American yeshiva student in the West Bank."
David Baum, an Isreali-American student was shot in the head on 13 May 1996.  A car with gunmen identified as Palestinians shot into a crowd at a bus stop in the West Bank and killed Baum.
<P>

Christopher said in his speech that Iran is providing upwards to $100 million to the Hezbollah terrorist organization in Lebanon.  Iran also gives several million dollars a year to other terrorist organizations such as Islamic Jihad and HAMAS. Besides money, Iran is also known to provide terrorist groups with arms, training and sometimes "operational guidance."
<P>

The Secretary again called upon U.S. allies in Europe to join the U.S. in restrictions on trade with the outlaw country.  He said, "We now share a similar analysis of the facts, we differ when it comes to how best to deal with Iran. The Europeans themselves acknowledge that their policy has produced no significant change in Iranian behavior.  We remain convinced that no amount of dialogue will alter Iran's policies unless it is coupled with real economic pressure."
<P>

At the U.S. State Department, spokesman Nicholas Burns later said that the Secretary of State made his comments based on "dramatic and additional evidence that Iran is behind a variety of terrorist groups and terrorist operations throughout the Middle East."
<P>

In Isreal on Wednesday, Prime Minister Shimon Peres said that Iran was still plotting attacks against the Jewish state.  Peres said, "They're almost nervous as we're coming close to the end of the election.  They really want to stop the peace process. They want to frighten our people and they want to topple our government."
<P>

The Prime Minister was asked what evidence that he had to support his statement, and Peres replied, "We have caught some people who came under the strict orders of Iran to cause here killings and damage.  And we know for sure from our information that Iran is pressing very hard upon the Hezbollah and upon Islamic Jihad and upon HAMAS to try and destroy the electoral process by bombing and killing and sending Katyushas."
<P>

In another interview in the London-based Jane's Defense Weekly, U.S. Army General Binford Peay, the commander-in- chief of the U.S. Central Command, said that Iran's current arms program far exceeds what it needs to defend itself and its missiles could soon reach targets in Europe.  Peay also said that Iran's neighbors are becoming increasingly concerned about the intentions of the rogue state.
<P>

General Peay said that the rate of Iran's recent modernization of its navy, missiles and weapons of mass destruction is well beyond what it needs to just defend itself from attack.  Peay said, "Clearly, every senior leader -- civilian or military -- emir, king or chief of service that I talk to in the Gulf today describes Iran as the long-term threat."
<P>

The General also said that scientists from the former Soviet Union are now known to be working in Iran in an effort to extend the range of Iran's Scud missiles.  Peay said that he believes Iran's missiles will soon be able to reach targets in Europe.  Central Europe is only 1,500 miles from the borders of Iran.
<P>

A senior Iranian offical in Tehran on Wednesday angrily denied the assertions of the United States.  Atollah Mohajerani, the vice- president in charge of parliamentary affairs, accused the U.S. of formenting tension in the Gulf and for presenting Iran as a threat of countries in the Middle East region.
<P>

Mohajerani said that Iran resents the military presence of the United States in the Gulf region and said the patrols of the U.S. Fifth Fleet in support of the U.S. policy of "dual containment" against Iran and Iraq was, in his opinion, "A major source of tension."  Mohajerani also said, "Regional security is the responsibility of regional countries alone, and no-one else's."
<P>

In referring to the United States, Mahajerani said, "Certain countries, in order to dominate the region, try to create a gulf between the regional countries.  They also try to distort Iran's image and present the Islamic Republic as a potential danger to other regional countries."
<P>

If one were to read between the lines of Mohajerani's rhetoric, what he was really saying is that he wishes that the United States would just go away and leave the Gulf area so that Iran can increase its efforts to overthrow Arab governments and establish other strict Islamic regimes with Tehran at its center.
<P>

Also on Wednesday, Iranian state radio said that the U.S. wants to destroy Iran's Islamic government.  The commentary said, "Fabricated and relentless United States and Zionist regime <I>black propaganda</I> against the Islamic Republic of Iran is part of their common strategy to destroy the Islamic government in Iran."
<P>

With all the rhetoric coming out of Tehran in response to Christopher's speech -- it reminded one of a hornets nest turned angry.  Even the Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei got into the act on Wednesday.  The Ayatollah rejected the U.S. Secretary of State's offer to open a dialogue between to two countries.  Khamenei said, "In principle Islam believes in dialogue and talking.  But talking to whom, where and about what?  They (Americans) basically want the Islamic Republic of Iran not to exist in the world."
<P>

Analysis of Iran's rhetoric may be interpreted that Iran may, indeed, be feeling some heat from its criminal actions and they are becoming quite concerned that U.S. allies in Europe may finally join in imposing strict economic restrictions on the government in Tehran.  Iran may finally join the group of world pariah nations that boasts Iraq and Libya as members.
<P>

Military confrontation between the U.S. and Iran looks to be getting closer and closer.  Prime Minister Shimon Peres says that it is only a matter of time ... before something dramatic will happen.

<H2>15 Year Old Hijacks Bus; Kills Self</H2>
<P>

TAYLORSVILLE, UTAH (ENN) - A 15-year-old student who was armed with a .357 Magnum revolver hijacked a school bus in suburban Salt Lake City on Wednesday.  He shot the driver, led police on a high-speed chase, crashed the bus into a house and in the end shot and killed himself.  The subject was identified as Justin Allgood.  Police said that they believed he put the gun in his mouth and killed himself before the bus crashed into the house.
<P>

Printed newspaper obituaries of three close friends of Allgood's were found in his pocket.  The friends had all died in traffic accidents in the last two weeks, including one who died on Monday.
<P>

Salt Lake County Sheriff Aaron Kennard said, "All the information we have is he's a good kid who has gone through some personal tragedies in his life that have pushed him over the edge."
<P>

Sheriff's police said that the subject boarded the bus at 0720 MDT on Tuesday morning.  He brandished a revolver and ordered the bus driver and one of his friend's to get off the bus.
<P>

The bus driver said to Allgood, "You better not take that to school or you could get in pretty bad trouble."  The bus driver held out her hand for the gun.  Without a word, Allgood shot the 40-year-old driver in the thigh.
<P>

The subject then took the wheel of the bus as other students scrambled to get off.  Allgood then led police on a 30-block high-speed chase through the suburban town.  During the chase, the bus rammed a car, ran over a chain-link fence, jumped a two-foot-wide creek and then crashed into a house.  Half of the bus landed inside the home of a retired sheriff's deputy.
<P>

The owner of the home was still in bed when the bus crashed into his living room.  The retired deputy, not knowing what was happening, grabbed his gun and ran outside.  There, police officers tackled the man and slightly injured his shoulder.
<P>

A police SWAT team was called to the scene and fired tear gas into the bus. But, it was too late, and officers then found Allgood, strapped to the drivers seat, with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the mouth.  The bus driver, who was shot in the thigh, was reported to be in stable condition at a local hospital.

<font size=5><strong>EARLY WARNING: JFK AN EASY MARK FOR TERRORISTS</strong></font><br>
By Jim Fay, ENN NYC-NJ Metro Correspondent<br>
<br>
NEW YORK CITY (ENN) - The Sunday New York Times continuing it's coverage of airport security, cites confidential 
internal reports by the management of John F. Kennedy International Airport which calls the facility suseptable to, 
&quot;...fanatics and suicide missions.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Port Authority is a bi-state agency that owns and operates the three NY-area airports, and also the World Trade 
Center, the Port Authority Bus Terminal in midtown Manhattan, as well as all the bridges and tunnels between NY and NJ.<br>
<br>
One report obtained by the Times is written by an unidentified Port Authority Police Inspector who summarized a report 
done by an unnamed security consultant. However, according to ENN sources, the report was a duplication of an earlier 
report done by the same inspector heading up a committee of P.A. Police officers, detectives and superior officers who 
found the same, if not more, deficiencies in the security. The Port Authority management rejected the initial police report 
because, according to insiders, they felt that the police were &quot;padding their own nest...&quot; by overemphasizing security 
problems which would have resulted in the need of more police, more training and more overtime.<br>
<br>
The P.A. then sought out an outside security firm, believed to be one headed by a former NYPD official, to do the security 
evaluation again. The security firm's results were detailed in a report by the police inspector, which stated, according to the 
quotes from The Times, &quot;JFK Airport is subject to fanatics and suicide missions intending to blow up American aircraft.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Port Authority rejected the recommendations of the security report regarding the establishing of both a P.A. Police 
Bomb Squad and SWAT team, stating that the NYPD, the New Jersey State Police, and the Newark (NJ) Police 
Department would handle any and all situations of that nature. But what was not taken into consideration was, in the case 
of the NYPD Bomb Squad, the amount of time it would take for that unit to get to JFK from their headquarters in 
Manhattan's Greenwich Village, or what would happen if two terrorist incidents happened at JFK and LaGuardia Airport 
simultaneously. Both JFK and LaGuardia are covered by the same NYPD Emergency Service (or SWAT) units.<br>
<br>
The reports did not only cover the airports, but also the World Trade Center, and the bridges, tunnels and railroad 
operated by the P.A. The earlier reports cited severe security problems at the Trade Center, including whether having a 
public underground parking facility in such a high-profile building was a good idea. In 1993, terrorists entered the parking 
area with a truck loaded with high explosives which caused six deaths and extreme damage.<br>
<br>
The Times article goes on to report that still other reports were done by the P.A., in 1986, 87, 91, and 93. Many of the 
recommendations were rejected out of hand by the agency, and ultimately only about 50% of them were implemented. 
However, the Times quotes one present P.A. manager who stated that none of the recommendations were rejected 
because of cost.<br>
<br>
The 1987 report also faulted the airline security screening for accessing high-security areas, as well as the P.A. failure to do 
more to secure the ramp, or tarmac, areas. The Times article also quotes a retired civilian manager of JFK, who, up to his 
retirement in 1995, felt that the P.A. was still only reacting to potential hijacking of airplanes, and that no one in the P.A. 
thought that &quot;other kinds of threats (i.e. bombings) were likely...&quot;<br>
<br>
Although recent aircraft incidents out of JFK shows that security should be a top priority, within days of the TWA Flight 
800, French radio news reporters accessed high-security areas at JFK, and, most recently, a local New Jersey newspaper 
reporter stood by a jet aircraft on the tarmac at Newark International Airport, and was unchallenged by airport security.</p>

<H2>Ozone Disco Fire Kills 150 in Manila, Phillipines</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

The death toll in the tragic Manila disco fire has risen to at least 
150.  Survivors from the worst nightclub fire since a blaze killed
164 people in Southgate, Kentucky, in 1977 said that they saw electric
sparks and smoke just before the lights in the building went out.
When the people inside of the disco realized that there was a fire
and that there was only one way out -- they panicked. A stampede soon ensued.
<P>

The heat from the blaze was so intense that many bodies were reported
to be charred and fused together.  Manila police said that Identification of many of the victims
is said to be very difficult, due to the extent of their injuries. Many of those killed may have been 
trampled in a rush to the exits as late recognition of the fire occured.
<P>

When the fire broke out at a little past midnight, the club was
packed with about 350 young people. Most were college or high-school 
students celebrating the end of the school year. The club once had a 
fire exit, but that was said to be blocked by a new building next door
to the disco. Firefighters, after knocking down the blaze, reported that bodies were
piled waist-deep and that many of the victims were trampled to death
by a stampede to get out of the burning building.
<P>

One female survivor described the scene, "We saw smoke and tried to
run outside, but were caught in a stampede.  I was stepped on, but
managed to force my way out." Another survivor said, "Suddenly the lights went out.  I thought it
was a gimmick, but then suddenly somebody shouted 'Fire!'  All I
can remember is that there was panic... and a lot of pushing and shoving"
<P>

Cause of the fire has not been officially determined, but there has
been reports that a fuel tank in the kitchen may have exploded.
Some of the survivors said that it appeared that the blaze began as an 
electrical short in a disc jockey's booth.
<P>

Manila hospitals were reportedly overwhelmed by the number of
injured victims; many that were brought in with second and third-degree
burns and smoke inhalation injuries. Others had suffered broken bones as the result of being stepped on. Several victims are reported to be in extremely critical condition and doctors say that the death toll may continue to rise as 
<P>
Police and fire officials said an intensive investigation was underway to ascertain the actual cause of the fire. One investigator told ENN that the possibility of "sabotage" or arson has not been ruled out, and that "all possible causes" would be given "due consideration."

<H3>Two Detroit Police Officers Shot</H3>
By Gary Baumgarten, 
<BR>
Michigan Public Safety Network
<P>

DETROIT (MPSN) - Two Detroit Police officers were shot, one critically, as they stopped to investigate two young men they thought might have been school truants. Officers Kelvin Patrick and Cathy Warren of the 12th Precinct were rushed to Grace Hospital after both were shot several times while sitting in their police car. Officer Patrick, who got the worst of it, was in critical condition. Police took six people in for questioning but were not immediately certain whether the trigger man was among those arrested. Police say it was particularly disturbing to them that the gunman calmly walked over to the police car and smiled as he shot the officers. Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer, who rushed to the hospital emergency room, called the shootings, "cold blooded."
<P>
In an update to this story, Officer Patrick, age 39, was shot several times in the chest and may have suffered permanent spinal damage.  Officer Warren, age 45, was in good condition with a gunshot wound to the arm.  Both officers are said to be 20-year veterans and were transported to Detroit's Grace Hospital via patrol cars.

<H3>Armed Robbery and High-Speed Chase</H3>

PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY, MARYLAND (FRW) - One armed robbery suspect remains at large after a high-speed chase in Prince George's County that ended with a bailout outside a Federal Courthouse on Thursday night.
<P>

Montgomery County undercover officers had the two men under surveillance when they attempted to rob a Silver Spring convenience store. The officers followed the suspects, who police said may have been involved in several other robberies, for about 30 miles through Montgomery and Prince George's County before attempting to pull them over.
<P>

Police tried to block the suspect car's path on an exit ramp onto I-95, but the car rammed a Maryland State Police trooper and continued for about 15 miles before driving off the road and stopping adjacent to the Federal Courthouse.  Police caught the first suspect within 10 minutes as nearly 100 offciers surrounded the perimiter. The other suspect remained at large.

Chicago, IL., (ENN) August 21, 1995 -- At 07:53 a.m. this morning
(local time) the #26 Bus pulled up to a stop in Ramat Eshkol, a
northern suburb of Jerusalem. Within seconds of its arrival,
according to eyewitnesses, it disintegrated in a smoking mass of
rubble, blood, and body parts.  The unthinkable had occurred
again; an alleged female suicide bomber, acting on behalf of the
Hamas extremist organization, had detonated an improvised
explosive device on a crowded bus.
<P>
According to an official from Magen David Adom (Israeli
Emergency Medical Service), five (5) people are known dead and
at least another ninety-two (92) were wounded as the result of
the blast. A cab driver, at the scene, said that he actually saw
people being blown through the windows of the bus as the bomb
exploded.  More than twenty of the injured are believed to be in
critical condition at Hadassah Mount Scopus Hospital, Hadassah
Ein Karem (Trauma Center), or Shaare Tzedek Medical Center,
where most of the victims were transported.  Several people were
said to be undergoing surgery as the result of blast injuries,
including head, chest, and extremity wounds. Many were wounded
by flying shrapnel, and others by concussion injuries.
<P> 
At least eighteen ambulances were originally sent to the scene
and more were requested when the magnitude of the incident was
understood.  According to one report at least two soldiers and
four policemen were injured/killed in the blast.  Numerous
security forces were sent to the scene to attempt to control
crowds that began to immediately gather. Israeli EMS authorities
have also requested emergency blood donations, to assist in the
disaster.
<P>  

An unnamed police official says that it was extremely lucky that
the bomb exploded when it did, because the blast occurred just
outside of the Rene Kassem High School, at the Kassem Junction
on Eshkol Boulevard. Fortunately, school was not in session at
the time of the detonation. The officer said that had the school
been in session, that hundreds more would have been wounded or
killed.
<P> 
Shortly after the blast, several Israeli officials began to
arrive at the scene to survey the damage and attempt to calm
angry crowds that had begun to protest the deaths of their
countrymen and women. According to a highly placed emergency
service source, Police Minister (Labor) Moshe Shachal was forced
from the scene by "angry mobs" who were shouting "Traitor" and
"Death to Rabin" and attempting to approach the minister. 
Police reportedly were having great difficulty with crowd
control, and several arrests were made. Police then sealed all
exits from Jerusalem and the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF)
reportedly set up roadblocks to the North of the city, in the
direction of largely Arab Ramallah, Shufat, and Beit Hannah.
<P>
In response to the blast, Prime Minister Rabin has "indefinitely
canceled" autonomy talks with PLO officials and sealed the
borders with it's Arab neighbors. Both Conservative
anti-government protesters and Moslem organizations are
reportedly calling for the ouster of Police Minister Moshe
Shachal for his failure to provide security on the nation's
buses.  A large number of border police are reportedly
assembling near the blast site and at other major intersections,
where the militant "Zu Artzeinu" (This is our Land) has called
for late afternoon demonstrations and a stoppage of traffic. 
Local emergency officials say that "it looks like it's going to
be a very difficult day" in the Israeli capital.

<H2>ERRI Announces Terrorist Watch Chart</H2>
By: Steve Macko, Managing Editor
<P>

Chicago, IL., August 9, 1995 -- The Emergency Response &
Research Institute (ERRI) today announced the first release of a
by a new computer-generated reporting tool regarding both
international and domestic terrorism, and particularly
anticipated acts directed against the United States.
<P>

Clark Staten, Executive Director of ERRI, a Chicago-based
emergency service 'think tank", said that the new reporting
mechanism will reflect the latest advances in computer
information gathering and analysis.  Staten said that the ERRI
"prediction chart" is based on a database of twelve (12) years
of accumulated data on terrorist incidents, that have occurred
throughout the world. Staten continued by saying that current
data is updated on a daily basis and that the program attempts
to make predictions based on modeling and tracking of trends
that have precipitated violent acts in the past. Additionally,
human analysis of current data, as it is entered, allows it to
be given greater or lesser weight in the overall determination
of future threat levels.
<P> 

Although Staten admits that this subjective input can change the
outcome of predictions made by the "expert system", and that the
programming is constantly being upgraded to provide a better
technical picture of the world situation, he says that the human
evaluations are still necessary to give the program a more
accurate picture of near-term anticipated events.  As additional
"expert rules" are added, he continued, it is anticipated that
the program will get better and better at identifying
circumstances that could forecast potential terrorist acts.
<P>  

Tom Lorinzi, ERRI computer systems analyst, said that ERRI and
it's reporting arm, EmergencyNet NEWS, have been using the new
system for most of 1995, and have found it to be "amazingly
accurate" in anticipating times when the likelihood of an
extremist act is increased. He said that the biggest problem
encountered, so far, is the inputting of the tremendous number
of variables that are necessary for the program to make "good
decisions".  Lorinzi concluded by saying that the ERRI system is
one of the few in the world, outside of major intelligence and
police agencies, that is attempting to analyze and report on
potential acts of violence.
<P>

Staten concluded the interview by saying that ERRI will utilize
the new "Terrorist Watch Chart" in future news releases, when
significant events warrant a change in the threat status of the
United States.

<H2>THE CHANGING FACE OF THE FIRE SERVICE - PART 1 </H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

As editor of this publication, I am asked from time-to-time: "Why don't you include more Fire/EMS articles in the daily report, or on the webpage?"  The only reply that I can give is that the number of news-worthy incidents involving fire/EMS services has declined.
<P>

When I first started perusing the major news wires, about three years ago, there weren't many but there were always some stories on fires.  Unfortunately, most of those stories involved a family killed in a tragic blaze.  Every once in a while there may be a feature on some fire department in the U.S.
<P>

In all honesty, in the past year, those kinds of stories have all but disappeared from the news wires.  Why?  First, I don't believe its because of lack of interest.  Hopefully, we all think that if there are no reports about a family of five being killed in a fire -- that's a good sign.
<P>

Statistics show that the number of fires in the United States has dropped dramatically in recent years. This appears the first reason and most important reason that I must give.  There is just no longer a large number of incidents to report about.  In Chicago, 90 percent of the phone calls to 911 are for police service.  About seven (7%) percent of 911 calls are for EMS service.  That leaves about three (3%) percent for fire service. Of that three percent, only a very small number are of news consequence.
<P>

The second reason that I must give, and it's unfortunate, is that the fire service, on a whole, does a poor job of promoting itself to the media.  As an example, the Chicago Police Department gives a monthly news conference just to disseminate crime statistics. Why does the CPD do that?  Well, they know that the reporters will go back and write a story about it.  So?  In the view of the police department, the more that they are mentioned in the news the better.  Why?  Mainly, because it helps them at budget review time.  Mayors and city councils are always looking for ways to cut their budgets and city department heads must justify their budgets.
<P>

The Chicago Fire Department does not give any such news conference. In my opinion, the Fire Commissioner, himself, shys away from the media as much as possible.  I'm not entirely sure why.  And, Chicago is not much different from most major city fire departments. Many seem to avoid the press at almost all costs.
<P>

I don't know why the fire service does not do more to promote itself.  I, as the editor of this publication, would be more than happy to help promote it.  Everyday I scan a number of both local and out-of-town newspapers just looking for fire-related news .... But, folks, it's just not there.
<P>

The following article I wrote in November of 1994, to show how far back I'm going to find fire-related material.  It explains how the fire service is going through a change and I think that it explains, very well, how the number of fire-related incidents has dropped in recent years.

Until then ... I will search high and low for news for our friends in the fire and EMS service.
<HR>
<H4>EMS in the Fire Service</H4>

In recent years I've been asked many times to explain the reasons for the dramatic decrease in the number of structure fires in the United States and in Chicago in particular.  This article, part of a two part series, deals with the situation and implications of and to the Boston Fire Department and is now indicative of all major departments in the United States. In order for most major departments to survive massive budget cuts, they are going to have to adjust their mission, a bit. That's why we call this series ... The Changing Face of the Fire Service.
<P>

The number of serious structural fires in Boston has been halved in the last ten years, reflecting a national trend that may force the tradition-bound fire department to redefine and broaden its mission.
<P>

Boston's 1,570-member department fought fewer than two "Working" or multiple alarm fires a week last year, less than half the number of 1983.  And while the department responds to more calls of service -- more than 40,000 a year -- less than 5 percent of those calls are building fires.  And less than one in every 500 building fires is considered serious.
<P>

In fact, the only firefighter who died of injuries sustained in the line of duty in 1993 was a veteran department member who fell down a dimly lit staircase while checking out a defective furnace -- a call that reflects the diverse nature of the chores in which the department is involved.
<P>

Between 1980 and 1992, the number of fires in the United States dropped dramatically -- from 2.9 million to 1.9 million, according to the National Fire Protection Association's annual survey of fire departments.  Fire-related deaths and injuries of both firefighters and civilians have also fallen markedly.
<P>

The number of building fires has diminished because of improved code enforcement, mandatory sprinkler and smoke alarm laws, and stepped-up fire prevention methods, experts say.  Technical innovation has also provided firefighters with better equipment, enabling them to contain and extnguish fires faster.
<P>

Fire is an unpredicatable phenomenon and a certain level of firefighting readiness is considered essential and prudent, but the success of firefighters and others in reducing fires is raising fundamental questions about staffing and funding levels for fire services, which consume large portions of city budgets.
<P>

"About 15 or 20 years ago, we set a goal to reduce fires in the United States.  We have been very successful, probably more successful than we ever imagined we would be," said Gary Briese, director of the International Association of Fire Chiefs.
<P>

In Boston during the first eleven months of 1993, there were 33 "Working Fires" and 49 multiple-alarm fires.  Only nine of those fires went beyond two alarms.  Three engines, two trucks and a rescue company -- 30 people in all -- respond to each confirmed structural fire.  At each subsequent alarm, the department dispatches more equipment and firefighters.
<P>

Yet more than 80 percent of the department's $84 million budget is reserved for "fire suppression."  And Fire Commissioner Martin E. Pierce, Jr says he needs 100 more firefighters to reach what he considers a level sufficient to maintain the best service to the public and optimum safety conditions for the firefighters.
<P>

Pierce, a 26-year veteran of the force, said that because so many firefighters respond to calls, they are able to contain and extinguish fires more rapidly -- an advantage in highly congested, densely populated neighborhoods.
<P>

But the fire department -- the fourth largest Boston city department after schools, Health and Hospitals and police -- has resisted change, even as other city departments have sustained major cuts to adapt to more austere economic times.  The fire department budget was cut only slightly in the last fiscal year.
<P>

"It's more a question of getting the fire department to change its emphasis and content than in cutting it," said District City Councilor David Scondras, who first came to public prominence fighting arson in Boston's Symphony Road area.
<P>

Some observers argue that Boston is more vulnerable to fire and more in need of a large department than many other cities of comparable size because of its old wooden housing stock, density, topography and large population of low-income residents and immigrants -- whose poverty, customs and lifestyle are said to make them more vulnerable to accidental fires.

Yet critics say the department clings to outdated practices, including the maintenance of 1264 municipal fire alarm boxes at an annual cost of $1.2 million.  About one-fourth of the department's 43,401 calls during the first 11 months of 1993 were false alarms, and about a third of the false alarms came from street boxes.
<P>

Meanwhile, John DeJong, chairman of the Boston Finance Commission, a state-appointed fiscal monitoring agency, said a preliminary review of the fire department has found what appears to be an excessive number of supervisory positions.
<P>

"We have looked at other city departments and they have a triangle structure.  With the Boston Fire Department, it's not a triangle, it's a rectangle," he said.  He also said that contract provisions allow firefighters to collect hazardous pay even if they never leave the fire house.
<P>

At a time when Mayor Menino has said he wants to improve and streamline city services, the fire department is mentioned by many in and out of government as a prime place for realignment.  As critics say, the department is taking some steps toward broadening its mission.  A reveiw of its 40,000-plus calls shows the department is turning into an emergency and disaster response service.  The fire department responds to myriad emergencies -- from rescues on the Charles River to automobile accidents, overlapping in some cases with the city's Emergency Medical Services.
<P>

Pierce said he wants to absorb the Emergency Medical Services fleet and staff, which now works for Health and Hospitals, and takeover the firefighting component of the Massachusetts Port Authority, which deals primarily with airport-related disasters.  "We respond to anything," said Pierce.  "I think we have a lot to offer."
<P>

Emergency medical services and disaster response are the jobs of the future for major urban fire departments, said the International Association's Briese.  Boston's Emergency Medical Services fleet of 14 ambulances and staff of 200 responds to more than twice as many calls as the fire department each year, at a much lower cost of $10 million.
<P>

But because of the size of the Boston Fire Department and the location of fire houses in virtually every neighborhood, it is able to respond more quickly to emergency calls than any other city agency.  To take advantage of this quick response time, Boston's Health and Hospitals Department has agreed to train all firefighters in the use of external defibrillators, a device that jump-starts the hearts of heart attack victims.
<P>

As Pierce sees it, "I still need people and always will."
<P>
<HR>
On Wednesday (June 11th) , in Part 2 of this series, we will look at how more and more fire departments in the country are turning to EMS to justify and/or expand their budgets.

<H2>The Latest Wave of Terror...</H2>
By Clark Staten
<P>
Chicago, IL, July 29, 1994 -- There may, in actuality, be no rational
explanation of the most recent wave of violent attacks against
Israel and her allies.  On the other hand, by gaining a
historical perspective, we may be able to better understand the
issues that have resulted in the current dilemma.  The roots of
the problem date back to May, 14, 1948, when the British
Mandate, and control of the "Holy Lands", expired.  A guerrilla
war between Jewish settlers and previous Palestinian inhabitants
has continued, almost unabated, since that time.  Territorial
claims to Jerusalem and the surrounding areas have been
presented by many groups, but the force of arms has prevailed,
and Israel has repeatedly been able to defend its sovereignty. 
<P>
<HR>
<B>Suez Canal Crisis</B>
<P>

1956 brought the Suez Canal Crisis, and an Israeli advance
into the Sinai, prompted by English and French complicity in a
plan to take the strategic canal away from the Egyptians.  The
fledgling Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) performed admirably and
territorial gains resulted. 
<P>
<HR>
<B>1967 Sinai War</B>
<P>

In 1967, Palestinian raiders from Syria increasingly put the
lives of Jewish immigrants in danger.  Encouraged by the
U.S.S.R., Egypt, and its charismatic leader Gamal Nasser, was
thought to have "expansionist" tendencies, and a desire to
invade Israel.  As 100,000 Egyptian troops massed on the Sinai,
Israel took the only action available to prevent certain
defeat...on June 5, 1967, they attacked.  A brilliantly planned
air attack destroyed almost the entire Egyptian air force as it
sat on the ground.  By gaining air superiority, the Israelis
were then able to maneuver their tank corps with impunity, not
fearing Egyptian air attacks.  A series of armored cavalry and
tank task forces then advanced rapidly and surrounded or cut-off
Egyptian defenders.  Six days later, it turned into a rout, and
the Israelis gained both territory and the respect of other
military forces in the region.
<P>
<HR>
<B>Attack on the Golan Heights </B>
<P>

By October 6, 1973, Egypt had all but forgotten its devastating
defeat at the hands of the Israelis.  Again encouraged by the
Soviet Union, Nasser and Anwar Sadat decided that the time had
come to again attempt to demonstrate that Egypt and the Arabs
were stronger than Israel.  Encouraged by massive amounts of
Soviet military aid, and hundreds of T54 and T55 tanks provided
by the U.S.S.R., the Egyptians believed that they could easily
defeat the smaller Israeli army. They began their assault on Yom
Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement.
<P>  

The Egyptian aggression met with initial success, largely due to
a failure of Israeli intelligence. They failed to believe that
Egypt would undertake another war so soon after their previous
defeat.  For three days, the Israelis suffered heavy losses,
both of men and materials.  The Egyptians, however, also
suffered the pains of their attack.  Massive armored assaults
continued, with Israel eventually scoring a major victory on the
Golan Heights.  Both sides were resupplied; Israel by the United
States, and Egypt and her allies by the Soviet Union. By October
23rd, it was obvious that the IDF had once again prevailed.  The
Israelis had again defended their homeland.
<P>
<HR>
<B>Israeli/Egypt Peace Agreement</B>
<P>

By 1979, Israel and Egypt had begun to resolve their differences
and negotiate a settlement to the possession of disputed lands
in the Sinai and the West Bank.  A historic Israeli-Egyptian
peace treaty was finally worked out and signed at Camp David in
the United States.  It signaled the first possibility of Israel
bargaining away land for peace.  Further, it strengthened a
relationship between the United States and Egypt. 
Unfortunately, it also stirred the wrath of the PLO and other
extremist groups that claimed Israel as their "homeland".  The
stage was set for continued negotiations by Israel and further
terrorist acts by those that would attempt to defeat her.
<P>
<HR>
<B>Problems in Lebanon</B>
<P>

During the 70's and early 80's, Lebanon became a "hotbed" or
revolutionary thought and action.  Conflicts between various
religious "surrogate" military forces embroiled the formerly
placid resort country into a place torn by civil strife and
religious fervor.  In keeping with this migration, members of
the PLO, Islamic Jihad, Black September(Abu Nidal Organization),
PFLP, and dozens of other Islamic and Palestinian "freedom
movements" emigrated to Lebanon and set up bases. Beirut itself
became a battleground for conflicts between the various
religious and nationalist organizations.  Soon the entire
country was involved in the anarchy, and several elected
government have fallen or their leaders assassinated.  Cross
border raids, into Israel, also began and escalated.
<P>

The United States has been inextricably involved in both
counter-terrorism and the Middle-East situation since a failed
mission to Beirut that resulted in the destruction of a U.S.
Marine Barracks on October 23rd, 1983, and the deaths of 241
Marines.  Concurrent with the attack on the U.S. "peacekeepers"
was a devastating attack on as French Foreign Legion Compound
nearby. Several dozen French paratroops also died on that
fateful day. The day of the Shi'ite suicide truck bomb had begun.
<P>

The mid-to-late 80's brought continued terrorist attacks against
Israel, on her border with Lebanon.  Terrorist attacks let to
military reprisals and incursions by Israel.  Moslem extremists
and PLO sympathizers carried out skyjackings, bombings, and
street riots against Israel and her allies.  Nations like Iraq,
Iran, Libya, and Syria were soon tied to complicity in terrorist
acts against Israel and the countries that supported her.  Both
the tempo and ferocity of the aggressions seemingly increased
with each passing year.
<P>  

America and her sphere of influence continued to prompt Israel
to make peace with her neighbors.  Both military and financial
incentives were given to Israel to encourage less militant
actions and reward diplomatic initiatives that might lead to
peace.  Yet, both internal and external conflicts prevented many
Israelis from adapting a peaceful stance towards their Arab
neighbors.  They had suffered far to many casualties, during
their forty (40) year struggle for independence and sovereignty,
to easily give back the land that had been won with blood.  The
negotiations, although cautious, continued throughout the
Middle-East.
<P>
<HR>
<B>Persian Gulf War</B>
<P>

During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Israel displayed the greatest
restraint in the history of the often beleaguered country.  Even
though they were repeated struck by Iraq's SCUD missiles, they
refused to retaliate, largely because of requests and
reassurances from the United States that their inaction would
best serve the Allied Coalition in it's overall goal of
defeating Iraq.  The Persian Gulf conflict also cemented
relationships between Israel and several of her Arab neighbors,
lessening tensions and improving diplomatic ties.
<P>

Strangely enough, the development of these diplomatic and
financial ties may have further "fanned the fires" of radical
Islamic Fundamentalism.  A Washington-brokered 1993 Peace Accord
between Israel and the PLO seems to have been the impetuous of
the latest round of terrorist atrocities.  As the likelihood of
a peaceful subdivision of Israel came to fruition, the radicals
began calls for a complete subjugation of Israel and total
annexation of the country. Several Palestinian "splinter
groups", not represented by the PLO, were not satisfied with a
"limited self-rule" agreement for parts of Israel...they wanted
the whole country.  Since then, there has been a tremendous
increase in the number of terrorist incidents directed against
the Israelis and her allies.  Which brings us to the present.
<P>
<HR>
<B>The Rise of Iran and Islamic Fundamentalism; <BR>
A New Kind of Threat</B>
<P>

It should be noted that concurrent with the historic struggle
for a Palestinian homeland, a major "Islamic Revolution"
occurred in Iran.  Although the Iranians may have supported the
basic principals of the return of Israel to the Palestinians,
they also set out on an "expansionist" campaign of their own. 
Beginning in 1987, the Intifada, or Holy War, was begun, with
the expressed intent of exporting the Iranian brand of
Fundamentalist Moslem religion to the rest of the Middle-East
and even the world.  The Khomeini regime' also chose Israel as
an enemy, further compounding and expanding conflicts in the
region.
<P>

Israel's fight against Iranian-backed terrorist organizations is
probably the most complex problem facing the world today.  The
organizational structure of the many extremist splinter groups
is a bewildering maze of interlocking "cells" that may act as
surrogates of Iran or independently, as the leader of each group
may see fit. Although the weapons, explosives, and training may
have been provided to each group by Iran, the actual control of
each group is probably a "local" decision.
<P>  

Admittedly, Iran may have influence with hundreds of these types
of small groups, and even be able to encourage them to undertake
specific terrorist acts, Iran doesn't have absolute authority
over their actions.  This very fact complicates the possibility
of apprehension of the terrorists, or military revenge against a
given country.  Iran has what is called, in diplomatic and
intelligence circles, "deniable plausibility".  In other words,
they can honestly deny direct involvement, even though they may
have supplied all of the necessary elements and religiously
condoned the action.
<P>

It is believed that this is the case in recent bombings in
Argentina, Panama, and London, England.  The organization, or
organizations, responsible for these atrocities may have no
"direct traceable link" with Iran, even though they may have
been previously paid, equipped, and encouraged by Iran.  Each of
these belligerences has probably been carried out by a small
team of experts, often from different "extremist" groups, who
were assembled for the purpose of committing the specific act. 
Almost always, this is done with the assistance of a local
accomplice or accomplices, who are responsible for acquiring
equipment, weapons, explosives, and vehicles.  In each case,
however, we see one or more "fanatics", who are Moslem zealots
and prepared to die for the cause of Islamic expansionism.
<P>

The organizational structure of these "mission specific"
terrorist groups provides for a maximum of security, in that the
members don't even know each other, should they be caught and
interrogated.  Secondarily, it further complicates the process
of establishing responsibility for the act.  A typical example
would include the World Trade Center Bombing, which included
"experts" from several countries.  In some cases, their only
common element was an Islamic zeal to cause damage to "The Great
Satan", that is the United States. Thus, the problem confronting
the both Israel and the United States at the time of this
report. 
<P>
<HR>
<B>Threats Against the United States </B>
<P>

Both the U.S. State Department and FBI have reportedly issued
warnings, within the past six hours, that they have received a
"credible threat" against Jewish targets within the United
States.  Huge sand trucks have been moved to block the front of
the Israel embassy in New York City.  The Israeli Consulate is
Washington, DC is said to be on "full-alert", with additional
barricades installed and parking prohibited in the area.  A
senior emergency service official, in New York City, says that
Fire, Police, and EMS services have adapted an "increased state
of alert" there, and are awaiting further information about the
potential threat.
<P>
Most counter-terrorist analysts are presently urging extreme
caution, but also don't want to unnecessarily alarm the general
populace with unconfirmed reports of possible terrorist acts. 
In general, local, state, and federal officials seem to be
taking the threat seriously, but with reserved optimism that a
catastrophic event can be avoided by preparedness.  So...the
country waits, in heightened awareness, for the heinous act that
everyone hopes will never come.

<H2>ANOTHER IRA BOMB EXPLODES IN LONDON...</H2>
By Steve Macko
<P>

One person was killed and eight others were injured when a bomb
ripped through the top portion of a London double-decker bus on
Sunday night.  London police said that they did not receive any
prior warning of the blast, as is the usual case.  Speculation
is now centered around the bomb accidently went off and the bus
was not the target of the blast.  The person who was killed most
likely was an IRA terrorist transporting the device from one place
to another.
<P>

The bomb exploded in the late evening at 10:38 p.m. (1738 EST) in
the Aldwych area of central London, near the intersection of
Wellington Street near the Strand.  The bus exploded near the Waldorf
Hotel and had been any other night than a Sunday, the street and bus 
probably would had been filled with theater-goers. 
<P>  

The Number 171 bus had reportedly just crossed Waterloo Bridge and
turned into Aldwych when the bomb went off.  The area of the blast
is near the London School of Economics, the headquarters of the BBC
World Service and Somerset House, which is a palace that was built
in 1550.
<P>

Witnesses said that the explosion ripped the bus apart like a
sardine can.  The entire top of the bus was ripped open and the
lower portion was gutted by fire. One witness to the blast said, "I was
walking down the road and I saw a big white flash in the sky.  I looked 
and then I saw a double-decker bus but there was nothing left of it.  It was completely
blown to pieces."  Another man who witnessed the tragedy said, "The bomb was on the
bus.  It blew the whole top deck clean off.  It was definitely
planted on the top deck.  There was no ceiling, no roof.
<P>

Five pieces of fire equipment and a number of ambulances immediately
responded to the explosion and were on the scene within moments.
London Ambulance Service said that a total of eight victims were
taken to area hospitals. Another witness told, "I saw one woman who looked severely injured,
she was lying in a pool of her own blood, there was blood on her
head.  She was motionless."
<P>

Six of the injured victims were taken to nearby St.Thomas' Hospital.
A doctor at St.Thomas' said, "Five men and one woman, all relatively
young adults, were brought by ambulance to the hospital.  Three of
them have significant head injuries, one lady and two men."  The
other victims that were brought to the hospital were said to have
only minor superficial injuries and lacerations to the body.  The
doctor also said, "The man with the most severe head injuries has
significant facial injuries and arterial bleeding."
<P>

The director of the north-east division of the London Ambulance
Service said, "The staff in central ambulance control heard the
explosion and were therefore able to mobilize necessary resources
immediately.  I am delighted that once again LAS staff responded
in such a professional manner."  Emergency workers who responded
to the scene of the blast were amazed that there were not more
casualties.
<P>

On Monday, the Belfast, Northern Ireland, office of the British 
Broadcasting Corporation received a telephone call stating that 
the Irish Republican Army (IRA) was claiming responsibility for 
Sunday's blast.
<P>  

In a statement to the BBC, the IRA said, "The bomb which exploded
last night was one of our devices.  We can say at this stage we
regret the loss of life and injuries which occurred."
<P>

Commander Tony Rowe of Scotland Yard said that police are working
on the theory that the bomb went off accidentlly while it was being
transported to its target.  Police believe that the person who was
killed was the bomb carrier.  It would not be the first time that
an IRA bomb had gone off accidentally killing the carrier.
<P>

This was the third bombing attack in nine days in London by the
IRA.  It is believed that the terrorist organization intends to
target London and not Northern Ireland in its campaign of terror.
The main reason for targeting London is because of the publicity 
that it can receive.

<TITLE>Methuen, Mass. 6 Alarm Fire; 33 hurt</TITLE>

**LEAD STORY**
<BR>
<H3>CONFLAGRATION IN NORTHERN MASSACHUSETTS...</H3>
By Steve Macko
<P>
In what is being called one of the worst fires in Massachusetts history,
a 6 Alarm plus fire struck the four-building Malden Mills complex located
at Route 28 near Broadway in Methuen, Massachusetts, on Monday evening.
At about 2020 EST, an apparent boiler explosion set off a huge blaze at
this complex that is located about 26 miles north of Boston that makes
clothing and upholstery fabric.  700 people were said to be working in
the complex at the time of the initial explosion.
<P>

The initial blast was followed by a series of explosions which were
apparently caused by ruptured gas mains.  Massive mutual aid was sent
to the scene from neighboring towns, towns in New Hampshire and from towns
as far away as the southern suburbs of Boston.  In all, it was reported
that 200 firefighters battled the blaze with 67 engine companies and
22 truck companies.
<P>

33 people were injured in the blaze.  Eight of the victims are reported
to be in critical condition.  Numerous ambulances were sent to the
scene, along with four medevac helicopters.  Some of the most serious
victims were airlifted to hospitals in Boston and Worcester.
<P>

Firefighters were hampered by temperatures that were near zero degrees (F)
and winds that gusted at 45 MPH.  Three of the mill buildings were
reported to had been destroyed by the heavy fire.  Burning embers set
two nearby residential homes on fire and a seperate 2 Alarm fire was
called for at #11 Annis Street.  Embers set a 2-story wood frame furniture
repair store 75x75 on fire.  Heavy fire and smoke conditions were reported
in this blaze that started at about 0025 EST.  During the height of the
fire, one police officer said, "It's like it's raining fire."
<P>

Water supply problems also hampered firefighters who were battling the
inferno in the 200x400 complex which was reduced to rubble.  It was
reported that a collapsed wall fell upon a pumper from the city of
Lawrence, who really cannot afford to lose firefighting equipment.
<P>

Methuen Fire Chief Ken Bourassa said on Monday evening, "The initial
explosion was so intense that it blew out the sprinkler system.  Malden
Mills is a mill building.  It has all the hazards of a mill building ...
lint and chemicals and hazardous materials of that nature."
<P>

Authorities said that some victims could be found dead in the ruins.
But as of 0600 EST on Tuesday, no bodies had been found.  Arson 
investigators from the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms are investigating the huge blaze.  The ATF investigating a
major fire is not unusual.

<H2>Train Derailment and Sulphuric Acid Leak in Leadville, CO</H2>
By Clark Staten, ENN
<P>
Chicago, IL, February, 21, 1996, (ENN)--According to the Colorado State Patrol, there are two confirmed fatalities in a train derailment and toxic material spill that occurred today near Leadville, CO. Both of the dead are believed to be Southern Pacific Railroad employees, who were aboard the train at the time of the derailment. The accident occured at approx. 06:00a.m. this morning, near U.S. Highway 24, between Leadville and Minturn, Colorado.
<P>
Twenty-five (25) cars of the mixed load freight train left the track and several cars overturned. Two of those cars are believed to be leaking sulphuric acid onto nearby Highway 24.  A toxic gas cloud was reportedly formed as the spilled sulphuric acid mixed with snow and began to react. At least one person was admitted to the nearby Vail Valley Medical Center with respiratory difficulties, and "several others" were treated for eye and breathing irritation.
<P>
Several nearby homes and businesses were evacuated as a a special hazardous materials spill team attempted to control the spill and limit the spread of the gas cloud. Highway 24, itself, was reportedly contaminated and closed by State Patrol officers, as the firefighters worked to mitigate the emergency. Traffic congestion was also reported, as Interstate Highway 70 was previously closed by a snowslide and Highway 24 was being used as an alternative route.
<P>
The cause of the accident has not been established, but is under intensive investigation following a rash of train crashes and derailments in other parts of the country in recent days.  The Avalanche Information Center of Colorado speculated that the crash was caused by 16 inches of new snow and a snowslide that may have covered the tracks.  A State Patrol spokesperson said that "all theories" regarding the calamity would be given consideration, but that it was to early in the investigation to reach any conclusions.

 <center><H2>A Message from the Webmaster</H2></center>
<P>
<B>As much as it troubles us to do so, we find it necessary to discuss the issue of financial support with you, our esteemed readers, observers, and participants. It is our first priority to make this resource available to everyone from the emergency response community, and those with an interest in what we do. We sincerely want to do that with no strings attached...meaning that it is our desire to not require user IDs, passwords, or subscription fees. Even though several site vistors have suggested that we could charge for this service, we have so far been able to resist that impulse.</B>
<P>
<B>Unfortunately, as with most good things, the costs of providing this site and its information to you are high. Suffice it to say that the purchase of a separate server, software, network equipment and installation of a dedicated Internet line were an expensive undertaking. Hundreds of man-hours were spent assembling original reference information and posting it here for you to read and download. Dozens more are spent every week by our world-wide staff, covering and analyzing the most up-to-the-minute emergency news and issues that we believe are important to you.</B>
<P>
<B>We are attempting, as best we can, to off-set these costs by offering advertising and other revenue-generating sources here on the site.  We would ask that you seriously consider patronizing our advertisers, recommend them to others, and maybe even drop them a e-mail note and tell them how much you appreciate their support for your interests.  It would be our greatest hope that their continuing support would help to provide for our expenses, in lieu of any actual charge for your personal use of the news and information here.</B>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="/pilecash.gif">
<B>Our hope and faith is also in you.  We believe that you will recognize the value and utility of this site and help us to continue this effort.  Although some will think us naive and even scoff and laugh at this request; they will also continue to visit the site, and take what we have to offer. Many will never pay "a nickle", assuming that we can afford to provide this service for them...for FREE...forever.  Of course, they are wrong.
<P>
 Hopefully, others will feel differently, appreciate our hard work, and voluntarily send in a few bucks to assist us in the maintenance and improvement of this unique asset. They might buy a book or computer program from us to help offset the cost of this site. Or, they might subscribe to our on-line bulletin board or daily ENNFAX emergency news service. Or, they will send in a news tip, article, or graphic for inclusion here. If every one of our current website users sends in only what <I>they think</I> our news and information are worth, we would more than be able to meet our annual budget.
<P>
The alternative, if no one choses to contribute in any way, is that this site may (at some point) have to become a totally commercial venture with all of the inherent costs and restrictions. We sincerely hope that doesn't become a necessity.
<P>
It is<I> ONLY</I> with <I>YOUR </I>assistance that this site can continue, improve, grow, and prosper.</B>

A powerful explosion that could be felt as far away as 30 miles
ripped through a steel plant in Portage, Indiana, on Wednesday
morning.  Three people are reported dead and eight others were
injured.  The blast occurred at 0708 CST at the Beta Steel plant,
located in Porter County, east of Chicago.
<P>

Preliminary reports are that an electrical explosion triggered a
gas explosion that knocked out a wall and caused a partial roof
collapse in different areas of the large 5-story metal-clad
building. An investigation continies regarding the involvement of a 
large water containment vessel that could also have been involved 
in the incident.  There was little or no ensuing fire.
<P>

A supervisor at the plant said that a tank located in the basement 
of the building that held water or hydralaulic fluid under pressure
had exploded.  The supervisor described, "All of a sudden there was
a huge explosion, like a time bomb.  Everything went kaboom."
<P>

Several employees were in a locker room when the roof collapsed and 
narrowly escaped serious injury or death. According to EMS sources, 
they were taken to several area hospitals, most in good condition. 
At least two employees underwent surgery for their injuries.

A central New Jersey industrial gas plant was allowed to burn
on Tuesday because firefighters were unable to use water on the
blaze.  The fire started at about 0900 EST at the Hunterdon
Industrial Gas plant located on the Delaware River, just outside
of Frenchtown, New Jersey.  No injuries were reported in the
incident.
<P>  

Firefighters could not put water on the blaze because of the
chemicals involved, which included helium, acetylene, propane
and oxygen.  The fire was allowed to burn itself out.  200 homes
within a half-mile radius of the plant were evacuated.

<H2>"COMMERCIALIZATION" TAKES "PUBLIC" OUT OF PUBLIC SAFETY??</H2>
By Jim Fay, ENN NYC-NJ Metro Correspondent
<P>

Firefighters and fire officers from several paid fire
departments have rallied to the support of paid and volunteer
firefighters in Westchester County, New York. Recently, a
contract was signed with a private corporation, who will set up 
and run a local fire department. The company, Rural/Metro 
Corporation of Scottsdale, Arizona,  is known nationwide as 
a company that is able to establish emergency service systems
in towns and corporate facilities. Rural/Metro claims to save 
the towns money by eliminating administrative overhead and 
management "headaches" involving municipal emergency workers, such as firefighters.
<P>

Rural/Metro has set up a fire department in Rye Brook, NY,
a village approximately 20 miles north of NYC.  Rye Brook
was previously contracting with an adjacent town of Port Chester 
to provide this coverage, and paying them about a third of the 
funds required of Port Chester to run its entire FD.  However, one 
thing that Rural/Metro has encountered in NY, that was not a problem 
anywhere else, is the support of strong unions of the paid drivers 
of the Port Chester Fire Department, and the large unionized  
membership of the various fire departments in other cities within 
Westchester County.
<P>  
Rural/Metro is not a union organization, and can pay its employees
substantially less than its counterparts in the paid fire
departments.  Many of the paid fire department members are
residents of Westchester County, and feel that, not only is the
"privatization" of a fire department a threat to their jobs,
but may cause a compromise of their own safety and that of their
families.   According to news reports, Rural/Metro firefighters
allegedly will not receive the basic hourly wage requirements of 
volunteer fire fighters in NYS.
<P>
Rural/Metro's business base has been primarily out in the west,
where small towns have developed, but the population cannot
sustain a paid department, or the population is made up of
retirees, unable to perform firefighting operations in a
voluntary capacity.The three-year Rye Brook contract is the
first contract in the northeast, where paid departments, as well
as paid/volunteer departments with ample volunteer members, exist.
Port Chester, the town that had been providing volunteer members
for Rye Brook's coverage, is an older town which still has names
such as "Reliance Hose Company" and "Putnam Engine & Hose 
No. 2," over the doors of their firehouses that were built in the
1880's, and where members have maintained a heritage and esprit 
de'corps. The corporate fire department, firefighters feel, has no
attachment to the community it serves, and the town will
suffer from it.
<P>

While other departments' unions are not as strong, their members
are just as vocal about the privatized operations. The privatized
fire departments  "...are no longer there to benefit the community,
but rather to benefit only their stock holders," says Captain Rob
Ullinger, a 16-year veteran of the Kent, Ohio, Fire Department,.
with  a "...decrease of service to the customer (the community)."
Ullinger calls it the "commercialization" of firefighting,
an occupation known for its dedication to, and stabilizing of,
a community. Kirk Harless, a firefighter/paramedic in South Dakota
called the fire service a "brotherhood," and "not run like a
(commercial) company, " referring to Rural/Metro's need to
maintain corporate profits. Rural/Metro has, in fact,
proven that it can make a profit and has become a worthwhile 
stock portfolio acquisition for investors.
<P>

Recently, Paradise Valley, Arizona, approved a contract with
Rural/Metro.  In the contract, Rural/Metro will be responsible for
the billing and collection of fees from home and property owners,
in lieu of taxes.  This was called a form of  "coercion and
intimidation" by Councilwoman Phyllis Sears, of Paradise Valley,
since it will be up to Rural/Metro to privately enforce the contract for
basic fire protection.
<P>  

However, this contract also calls for Rural/Metro to provide quarterly reports, estimates of water use, and fire prevention education, and a promise to build a second fire station. In addition, the company will provide ambulance
service for the town.  While Rural/Metro will collect the fees,
it will pay the town a quarterly license fee of $5000, or $20,000
a year, and use the collected fees for the running of the
emergency services.  This all appears to be a rather appealing
situation to a small government entity,  because it provides a
necessary service without the need of a government bureaucracy.
<P>
While it is not answered in the reports on this contract, a
question arises as to what the company does if a property owner
becomes in arrears in the fees. What happens if several of
property owners are in arrears?  Will they still get their fire
protection? If the property is abandoned, do only the fee-paying
exposures get protection?  Since the government is not collecting
taxes for this operation, can they step in on behalf of the
emergency service provider...or for that matter, for the homeowner?
While these questions may have been addressed in individual 
contracts, the details are generally not known. This may be one of the 
discouraging aspects of the commercialized service.
<P>

"The only things that are for sure is death and taxes,"  says
the old saw.  But, what has always been "sure" and taken for
granted, is that government intervention will occur when disaster strikes.
If the various units of government are not in the disaster business 
anymore, and someone who requires a profit every quarter is, then 
it would seem prudent for citizens to re-examine their priorities and 
be sure that they understand what their expectations can be.
<P>

<B>In the interest of fairness, EmergencyNet News hereby issues an open invitation to Rural/Metro and/or their corporate officers to address these concerns and present their side of this issue. Rural/Metro or other interested parties are invited to send replies to Mr. Fay at enn@emergency.com. Pertinent responses will be published here in the future.</B>

THE FOLLOWING IS A REPRINT FROM THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIRE CHIEFS NEWSLETTER 
<BR>            
<H3>"ON SCENE" </H3>
<BR>
     THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE IS WRITTEN FOR THE EMS MEMBERSHIP SECTION. PLEASE PASS ON TO OTHER FIRE AGENCIES AND FOR MEMBERSHIP INFORMATION IN THE IAFC-EMS SECTION, CONTACT 703-273-0911
<P>                         
<H3>   THESE TRULY ARE EXCITING TIMES!</H3>
<BR>
                         Gary G. Ludwig, MS, EMT-P
<P>
Some of most exciting news I can deliver is the stage is set to develop the largest fire-based EMS system in the United States with some 200+ ambulances.  If everything goes smooth, New York City EMS will be merged with NYFD in the near future.  I have had a chance to look at the proposal and speak with Fire Commissioner Howard Safir.  Commissioner Safir tells me that he fully expects to have EMS merged into the fire service by the first of the new year.  He further added, "this merger will introduce a new facet to New York City never seen before.
 A multi- tiered emergency medical care system which will increase our out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival rates."  He cited a recent fire in Queens where one of the first-due engines who had been trained as first responders found four children in cardiac arrest.  Resuscitative efforts were begun and all four children survived.  As it turns out, they were the children of a firefighter.
<P>
    
I also spoke with Deputy Commissioner Dolan who wrote the plan.  I must note it is a well-thought-out and written plan.   Deputy Commissioner Dolan tells me he relied very heavily on the experiences of other fire-based EMS systems from across the country while developing the proposal.  In essence, he found what worked and did not work elsewhere.  Two big components of the plan call for moving first-line EMS supervisors from their cars to front-line ambulances, in the same manner that first-line fire supervisors work on front-line apparatus.  Currently, only 60% of NYCEMS personnel work on an ambulance.  Another component of the plan calls for battalion- based systems with three or four ambulances working collectively out of 64 stations to handle a geographic area.   Presently, EMS works collectively out of only 16 stations.
<P>  
   Supplementing the ambulances is the first responder program started earlier this year.  Currently the average response time for a first-due engine is less than five minutes, and with the merger, ambulance response times would be less than 10 minutes.
<P>      
     Commissioner Howard and Deputy Commissioner Dolan wish to recognize IAFF Local 94 and Local 854 of the Uniformed Fire Officer's for their strong support. 
<P>
<HR>     

More Excitement - Colonel David Abner, Executive Assistant Chief of the Louisville (KY) Fire Department informs us that Louisville EMS, a third service municipality, has been merged into LFD as a bureau.  The process started under retired Chief Russ Sanders and continued under the present chief, John Corso.  To start the process, LFD began training firefighters as EMTS three years ago.  Additionally, anybody graduating from the academy had to be certified as an EMT.  In January of 1994, LFD began running first responder calls and expects to have AEDs aboard the engines soon.  Louisville EMS personnel have received 400 hours of "modified firefighter training."  In essence, they were issued personal protective gear and are trained for every aspect of firefighting except interior attacks.  Colonel Abner tells me the merger and the consolidation of the communication centers has benefited the community by improving service levels, at no additional cost.  Colonel Abner noted the strong positive support of the IAFF local in coordinating the merger.  You can reach Colonel Abner at 502-574-3701. 
<P>
<HR>   

More Excitement - Chief Tom Siegfried, last year's president of the IAFC tells me that beginning January 15, 1996, his department in Altamonte Springs, Florida will begin ALS transport.  In a head-to-head battle with remnants of CareLine, the Altamonte Springs City Commission voted 5 - 0 to have the fire department begin transport.  The Commission also voted 4 - 1 to encourage Seminole County as a whole to begin ALS transport.  In all, Seminole County will have more than 20 fire department staffed ALS transport vehicles to serve its citizens.  For the citizens, it's a double-win as the service improves while the average rate for transport will drop from $325 under a commercial (private) provider to $182 under a fire-based system.
<P>
<HR>        

More Excitement - The Portland (Maine) Fire Department under the direction of Fire Chief Joseph E. Thomas and EMS Section Member, EMS Chief Martin J. Jordan have received Maine's coveted "Service of the Year Award" for community service. The PFD provides a variety of community programs which helped favor them from among 228 other licensed services.  You can speak to Chief Jordan at 207-874-8406.
<P>
<HR>
     

More Excitement - Dr. Zeccardi, Deputy Commissioner of Emergency Medical Service for the Philadelphia FD tells me they have increased the number of ambulances on the street by 40% over the last calendar year.  After January 1st, Philadelphia FD will have 35 vehicles in operation while an additional 89 new paramedics will have been hired.
<P>
<HR>

Chief John Bergmann is proud of his recent accomplishments in Kansas City, Kansas.  His quagmire included a FSLA settlement and being told to cut his budget while increasing service simultaneously.  To accomplish this, all paramedics have been cross-trained to be firefighters and placed on the city's 18 engines, resulting in four man ALS engine companies.  ALS transport was contracted out to a public utility model to complement the single tier ALS system with ALS first response.  The average response time for a KCKFD paramedic/firefighter to any medical emergency is now 3 -5 minutes, at no additional cost to the city.
<P>
<HR>

It is not too late to register for Fire Rescue East '96.  A strong EMS agenda is planned for the January conference to be held in Tampa.  The itinerary includes nine EMS sessions including; "Electronic Collection of EMS Field Data", "Educating the Field Medic", "Quality Improvement Workshop", and "Transport of the Sick & Injured, Public or Private".  Fire Rescue East '96 runs from January 6 - 11, 1996.  For more information call Larry Scovotto at 904-676-2744.
<P>
<HR>

In the last column I told you about how the Salt Lake City Fire Department has made a proposal to upgrade the service delivered to its citizens by assuming the transport role of EMS.  Obviously, the owners of Gold Cross Ambulance, the current provider has objections to this plan.  To help their cause, as reported in The Salt Lake Tribune, there has been a total of over $10,250 known Gold Cross-related contributions to mayoral hopeful Rich McKeown.  Gold Cross stands to loose $200,000 a year if Salt Lake City decides to operate its own emergency ambulance service.
<P>
<HR> 

Picture this all too familiar scenario - firefighter/paramedics inside their engine house hear a siren coming down the street.  As they walk outside, they see a commercial (private) ambulance flying past their station, hands waving out the windows, lights flashing and sirens blaring.  Sound familiar?  Well for Chief Robert Brown, Jr. of Anderson Township Fire and Rescue Department near Cincinnati, Ohio it has happened too often and he is drawing a line in the sand.  Chief Brown tells me that the commercial provider, Medic One Ambulance Service has responded on numerous occasions into their Township in an emergency fashion.  Some calls were even to a nursing home facility directly across the street from an engine house with paramedics and an ambulance.
<P>  

Unfortunately, the commercial providers response times were sometimes over 15 minutes in duration to critical patients.  A series of letters has gone back and forth including one from Medic One's attorney that says "immediately cease your interference with Medic One's `business` relationship with Salem Parke Nursing Home."  It is sad!  This sentence summed it all up - business first, patient care last.  Chief Brown tells me that is not a private versus public issue - he feels it is a patient care issue.  Chief Brown has formed a Task Force with management and IAFF Local 3111 to deal with this issue.  Best of all, he has the support of the citizens and the city council.  You can contact Chief Brown at 513-474- 5562.

<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE-EMERGENCYNET NEWS SVC.-08/16/92-2130CDT </p>
<p><font size=5>JAMAICAN &quot;POSSE&quot; ATTACK KILLS FOUR, 18 INJURIED </font></p>
<p>Miami, FL - A drug gang war that started in Kingston, Jamaica early in 1992 may have recently spilled 
over into the streets and bars of Miami. Reportedly, an early Saturday morning nightclub shooting of 
twenty-two (22) people involved members of the Jamaican &quot;Shower Posse&quot;. Gang Crimes officers of 
the Broward County Sheriff's Office say that the nightclub killings may have been retribution for the 
February killing of Mark Coke, a leader of the Jamaican &quot;Shower Posse&quot; drug gang. The &quot;Shower 
Posse&quot; supposedly gets it's name from the &quot;shower&quot; of lead it shoots at rival gangs. </p>
<p>An agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobbaco, and Firearms says that Saturday's shootings &quot;had all the 
earmarks&quot; of a Jamaican &quot;Posse&quot; hit. Special Agent Joe Vince was quoted by the United Press 
International as saying, &quot;the posses are the most vicious organized crime group in the United States 
today&quot;. Capt. Al Lambeti of the Broward County Sheriff's Office said that the shooting was a &quot;...perfect 
textbook example of how the posse does business&quot;. </p>
<p>The Jamaican's typical method of operations (M.O.) reportedly includes multiple shots with multiple 
weapons, in a crowded public place. The Jamaicans are known for their frequent use of 9mm large 
magazine semiautomatic handguns and sub-machineguns. Their favorite weapons include the Uzi, 
Mac-10, Mac-11, Intra-tec, MP-5, Browning Hi-Power, Berreta F-92, Smith &amp; Wesson 9mm pistols, 
Glock 9mm, and Colt .45 semiautos. Most of the weapons they prefer are not the so- called &quot;Saturday 
Night Specials&quot; of the gangs of yesteryear; the weapons that they choose are expensive and efficient 
&quot;weapons of war&quot;, commonly used by worldwide military forces. </p>
<p>Limited eyewitness reports suggest that as many as four (4) gunmen opened fire in the &quot;Taste of the 
Islands&quot; club at approximately 3:30 a.m. on Saturday morning. Four people were declared dead at the 
scene, and eighteen (18) people were transported to area hospitals; several were reported to be in 
critical condition. More than one-hundred (100) shell casings were found in the club and surrounding 
parking lot. Emergency Medical Services officials said that several of the victims had suffered multiple 
gunshot wounds, which was indicative of the type of weapons routinely used by drug gangs. </p>
<p>A spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation said that the &quot;Shower Posse&quot; is one of 
approximately forty (40) Jamaican drug gangs that frequent the United States. He said that as many as 
twenty-five of them operate or are based in Florida. According to police sources, the Jamaicans may 
control as much as a quarter of the &quot;street-level&quot; drug trade in Florida. Other major Jamaican &quot;posses&quot; 
reportedly operate in Washington, D.C., New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and several other 
large U.S. cities. Police intelligence reports say that the Jamaican gangs are allegedly attempting to 
spread their influence and drug dealing efforts into several other parts of the country. </p>
<p>Evidence of the Jamaican Posse's violent activities were seen in Chicago, IL. on February 16, 1992, 
when two alleged members of a New York City (NYC) Posse were charged with the shooting of two 
Chicago Police officers during a botched armed robbery attempt. Both managed to elude police after 
the shooting and escaped to New York. One assailant was arrested in NYC while seeking treatment for 
a gunshot wound that he had received in the shootout with Chicago police. Subsequent investigation 
revealed that his accomplice was also hiding among Jamaican Posse members in New Jersey. Both 
were arrested by New York authorities to stand trial in Chicago. </p>
<p>While police detectives in Miami say that there were dozens of witnesses to Saturday morning's 
shootings, they lament the fact that not one has voluntarily come forward to identify the gunmen or 
provide details. According to Detective Dan Blocker, &quot;there were between 75 and 100 people in the 
club at the time of the shooting...we are looking for four gunmen or more...there are people who have 
vital information...that have not come forward&quot;. Police veterans say that witnesses may be intimidated by 
the already demonstrated violence and the fact that the Jamaican posses are known for deadly 
retribution against their enemies...as evidenced by the bloody attack of Saturday morning. </p>

<H3>Patrol Shift Schedule</H3>
<BR>
By Mark W. Moore
<P>

Days-Evenings-Second Shift-Midnight-Graveyard! Police officers use
different terms to describe their working hours. No single term is
universally accepted, but every officer knows what it means to be
assigned to patrol duties on a rotating basis. Officers also can attest to
the challenges that the patrol shift schedule places on their professional
and personal lives.
<P>

At the same time, police supervisors face dilemmas when scheduling
patrol officers. Weekends, peak crime hours, service demands, and
availability of personnel all tax supervisors who must ensure that a
sufficient work force is on the streets to enforce the law and to protect
citizens.
<P>

Unfortunately, no patrol shift schedule will work for every police
department. A review of the literature on this issue reveals different
stances taken by law enforcement professionals. However, the majority
believe that the patrol schedule should be based on the needs of the
agency and the community, which in this case, can be determined by
calls for service and the distribution of those calls. Personnel should be
deployed where they are needed, when they are needed, and in
proportion to the workload.1
<P>

There are numerous indicators for effective patrol division scheduling.
Some considerations include output (productivity), overtime accrual,
hidden costs for other units, officers' use of sick leave, number of
accidents involving patrol cars, collective bargaining agreements with
employee associations, and officer morale,2 as well as the the number
of hours worked each day and the number of days worked each week.
<P>

The four 10-hour-day work week receives much attention and support.
In addition to enriching an officer's professional and family life,3 the
four 10-hour day patrol schedule has other advantages, such as
maximum use of the workforce during critical service demand hours,
equal distribution of the workload, efficient shift changes, and balanced
use of equipment.4
<P>

As complex and demanding as scheduling patrol work may be, several
departments have adopted systems that best serve their needs. This case
study details the revamping of the patrol shift schedule for the Abilene,
Texas, Police Department.
<P>
<HR>


<H4>Former Schedule</H4>
<BR>


In the early 1980s, the Abilene Patrol Division, which was divided into
three companies with three squads each, worked rotating 8-hour shifts
with fixed days off. For example, Squad 1 of each company did not
work Friday and Saturday; Squad 2 of each company was off Sunday
and Monday; and Tuesday and Wednesday were days off for Squad 3
of each company. Supervisors overstaffed their companies on
Thursdays to accommodate inservice training. In addition, the
companies rotated shifts every 4 weeks.
<P>

A captain, a lieutenant, and three sergeants were assigned to each
company, which had the same number of officers. The assistant chief in
charge of the Patrol Division appointed personnel to each company at
his discretion.
<P>

The configuration worked for an extended period of time, despite some
inherent problems. On some days, a captain supervised a company; on
others, a lieutenant was in charge. This prohibited consistency in the
chain of command, and lieutenants and captains exercised the same
amount of control. The shift commander, regardless of rank, monitored
calls and radio traffic, serving mostly in a reactive capacity.
<P>

Increasing call loads and decreasing budgets marked the mid-1980s. In
an effort to service these calls with fewer resources, the chief of police
appointed a committee to develop a new scheduling          
configuration for the Patrol Division. This committee devised a plan
that called for a five-company system with a four 10-hour-day work
week, rotating shifts, and rotating days off. Unfortunately, the new
system failed to address the disparity of heavier call loads during
evening and weekend shifts. And, while the system allowed for 3 days
off each week, it also led to  many personal problems, particularly with
the scheduling of family events.
<P>

This system also eliminated the day in the previous patrol schedule that
supervisors overstaffed to allow for inservice training. Supervisors now
had to place officers on special assignment duty to attend training
sessions, which further decreased availability. This schedule, which
quickly became unpopular with most officers, still did not meet the
needs of the department.
<P>
<HR>


<H4>A New Approach</H4>
<BR>


In October 1988, the department took a different approach to patrol
scheduling. The new schedule retained the four 10-hour-day work
week, with fixed shifts and fixed days off. What changed were the
configuration of the Patrol Division-from five to six companies-and
supervisory responsibility for the companies and squads.
<P>

With the new schedule, a lieutenant supervises each company, which
consists of either two or three squads. Each sergeant, in turn,
supervises a squad made up of six or seven patrol officers who work
the same days and hours.
<P>

Regular patrol duty consists of four 10-hour days per week. Patrol
companies (designated A through F) work a fixed shift with fixed days
off. All companies, however, work on Wednesday. In other words, an
officer works either Sunday through Wednesday or Wednesday through
Saturday and works the same hours each week, with the exception of
the hours worked on Wednesdays.
<P>

Each Wednesday, supervisors alternate one-half of the division for
special assignments and inservice training. Actual duty hours and
number of officers vary by company and squad and depend on
workload. Occasionally, supervisors can alter the hours worked by
officers to address the workload or to provide security for special
events.
<P>

The workload required a major overlap in patrol hours from 8 p.m. to
2 a.m. As shown in the table, Company D works 1 hour later than
Company C to accommodate the busy weekend periods, and a third
squad was added to Company D because of the high call load on the
days that company works. Also, the Traffic Division now supplements
the patrol force during daylight hours by responding to calls involving
traffic accidents, abandoned vehicles, and traffic direction.
<P>

Currently, the Patrol Division consists of 10 patrol districts and 1 desk
position staffed by each patrol company. Computer-aided dispatch
supports all patrol districts and call assignments.
<P>

Once each year, the assistant chief in charge of the Patrol Division
reorganizes the division to adjust for workload, vacancies, and new
employees. This gives supervisors and veteran officers the opportunity
to choose their assignments, which are governed by seniority.
<P>
<HR>


<H4>Benefits</H4>
<BR>

The Abilene Police Department's new patrol schedule provides many
advantages to both the department and its officers. For the department,
the plan maintains clear lines of authority and unity of command. It
also allows for inservice training and special assignments, because all
companies work on Wednesdays. Instructors can teach an inservice
course to the entire division in 4 weeks, and officers are available to
assist investigative units, conduct community-oriented policing projects,
serve warrants, and provide selected traffic enforcement.
<P>

Other benefits also accrued. First, the amount spent by the department
for overtime pay was reduced. The department realized a 32-percent
reduction in overtime pay when figures from fiscal year 1985 were
compared to those of fiscal year 1994. In addition, there were fewer
hours of sick leave taken by officers. And, it has been determined that
this scheduling was a contributing factor in the reduction of employee
turnover.
<P>

Officers, however, receive the real benefits. They like having 3 days
off each week and maintaining a regular schedule. They also can take
advantage of extra duty, overtime assignments, and
department-approved security jobs precluded by previous schedules.
Furthermore, senior officers have the opportunity to select the shift that
they want to work.
<P>

Both the department and the officers benefit from regular inservice
training and officer availability for special assignments, which promotes
career development. This not only improves the department's efficiency
but also increases officer morale.
<P>

The community also wins with this patrol schedule. With the overlap in
shifts, more officers are available to answer calls for service when they
are most needed.
<P>
<HR>


<H4>Conclusion</H4>

<BR>

Several other departments similar in size to the Abilene Police
Department have studied and implemented its current patrol schedule,
some with limited success. The most important consideration, however,
is to develop a system that works best for the department and the
community.
<P>

Customizing a schedule involves research and analysis. It requires
patrol officer input to ensure a workable patrol schedule that is
acceptable to administrators and a schedule that meets the needs and
expectations of the officers. Often, the attitudes of those most affected
control the success of any new approach. But, in the end, the time and
effort expended to devise a workable and accepted patrol schedule will
go a long way toward maintaining departmental efficiency and
improving officer morale.

<font size=4><strong>Eight Hour 3-11 Alarm in Chicago</strong></font><br>
<br>
CHICAGO (ENN) - Chicago firefighters battled a very unusual fire for eight hours overnight on the city's South 
Side. Starting at about 2245 CDT on Tuesday night, there was a 3-11 Alarm on Box 2183 at 1400 West 44th 
Street. Fire was in a large 4-story brick box manufacturing company with dimensions of 100x300.<br>
<br>
This blaze was not described as spectacular, but it was obviously stubborn. Very heavy smoke conditions were 
reported and it was very, very difficult to find the seat of the fire.<br>
<br>
Firefighters took a real beating and an Emergency Medical Services Plan Number One was put into effect to treat 
firefighters. 15 handlines were used and firefighters had to chop through very thick concrete walls in an effort to find 
the fire.<br>
<br>
Chicago Fire Commissioner Raymond Orozco finally struck out the blaze at about 0645 CDT on Wednesday 
morning.<br></p>

<H2>MILITIA GROUPS INVADING NEW ENGLAND ...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

If you thought that militia, hate groups and extremist organizations were only a product of the South, Southwest and Northwest portions of the United States ... you were wrong.  Last week, Brian Levin, the associate director of Klanwatch, which is a project of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said that in the past few years six militia groups have sprung up in Massachusetts and eight have appeared in New Hampshire.  New Hampshire is one of 21 states in which regular paramilitary exercises are being conducted. There are also at least 12 other militia organizations operating in the rest of New England.
<P>

Levin said that the militia movement in the U.S. is "growing." He said, "The vast majority of the movement is benign.  The groups just want a rhetorical sounding board for their theories. But that ten percent underbelly are plotting against the government and carrying out illegal paramilitary training."
<P>

The Southern Poverty Law Center acts as a clearinghouse for information on military militias, hate groups and extremist organizations.  They are recognized as being experts in this field.  Levin said that support for militias and armed citizens' groups is now coming from other groups such as Second Amendment gun "fanatics," tax protesters and even radical anti-abortion activists. In practice, any number of these groups that oppose the government and the current administration seem drawn to ally themselves in preparing for potential violent actions. 
<P>

It appears that in the 1990s the militia and all other types of movements have become united in their anti-government rhetoric.  Three developments brought this into being.  They were: the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992, the Waco, Texas, incident in 1993 and the passage of the Brady Bill in 1993.  And, many are now waiting and watching for the outcome in Jordan, Montana; perhaps the next rallying point for anti-government forces.
<P>

Levin said, "It's a rallying point for these groups."  He said that the movements anti-government rhetoric are really only a disguise for racism and bigotry.  "I call this 'stealth bigotry.' You can't use the n-word, but if you talk about the government, people will listen to you," Levin added.
<P>

According to Levin, the right-wing extremists have gained strength from an increasingly dissatisfied mainstream, whose confidence in government, law enforcement and the court system has been virtually lost.  He said, "The mainstream is getting carried across this bridge to extremism.  You can establish bridges if you keep the terms coded."
<P>

As reported in this publication previously, many of these groups have now shifted themselves into small cells that are harder to locate, identify, or to prosecute.  Levin said that the extremist groups have gained access to the mass media and that this is giving them an opportunity to speak to and recruit young people. And, current trends do not bode well for the future; teenagers are reportedly currently responsible for 50 percent of all hate crimes against minorities and homosexuals.

<TITLE>Detroit FD; First Paramedic Graduation</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->

<B>ENN 5/17/96  08:14</B>
<P>
<H2>First Class of DFD Paramedics to Graduate</H2>

DETROIT (ENN) - The first class of paramedics from the Emergency Medical Service Division of the Detroit Fire Department will graduate on Monday, 20 May 1996.  This graduation is the beginning of an effort to train two-thirds of the DFD's EMS Division in advanced life support skills by 1998.  Gary Kelly, the Superintendent of the DFD EMS Division said, "These new paramedics, who have passed the stringent standards of emergency medical professionals, together with new EMS vehicles, are building one of the strongest EMS systems in the country."
<P>

Doctor Brooks Bock, the Medical Director of the Detroit East Medical Control Authority, said, "Our ability to save the lives of emergency patients will be significantly enhanced with this new group of paramedics in the field."
<P>

Currently, there are 210 emergency professionals in the Detroit Fire Department EMS Division.  About 33 percent of them are paramedics.  The rest are Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT's). Detroit did not enhance their EMS capabilities before because the city said it did not have the resources to do so.

<title>Basque Separatists Bomb Airport, Hotel, Sreet</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<body>
<p><font size=5><strong>Basque Separatist (ETA) Attack at Three Sites in Spain</strong></font></p>
<p>At 19.40 hours (Barcelona time) there was an explosion that involved three explosive devices done by the &quot;Armed 
Basque Organization&quot; (or Organization of Armed Basques) ++ETA (++Euskadi t ++Askatuta). The explosions were 
aimed against Spanish tourists as a part of a campaign that started about two weeks ago. This attack is the latest in a 
series of explosives set off in different cities in Andalucia, an area south of Spain. Before the explosions occurred, the 
ETA/ABO sent warnings of the upcoming attack to the newspaper Egin of San Sebastian and to the AVUI of 
Barcelona. <br>
<br>
Today's attempts, were in the airport of REUS, some 120K outside of Barcelona. During the summer, this airport 
hosts a large number of tourist flights including charters whose final destination is the Catalan coast and the foothills in 
the area. <br>
<br>
The explosive devices were deposited in a paper sack inside the women's bathroom, a place that was sure to result 
in grave injury to a janitor who worked for the airport. It also resulted in the injury to 24 tourists, one an older 
English woman, who were waiting to board a flight bound for Glasgow after vacationing on the Catalan coast. <br>
<br>
There were also explosions, without victims, in two cities close to the REUS airport: Cambrils, and Salou, both in the 
Province of Tarragona. ,<br>
<br>
The members of the ETA/ABO have specialized in attacking sites visited by Spanish tourists since 1983 since 
negotiations with the Spanish government to obtain the independence of the Basque province to that of a nation. <br>
++Pais (++Euskadi).</p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>PRESIDENT PUJOL VISIT TO THE INJURED</strong></font><br>
<br>
President of the Generalitat of Cataluna (the autonomous governor of Cataluna) became very upset when he heard 
about the successful bombing attempts today in Reus and the cities of the Gold Coast, Cambrils and Salou. The 
President is, at this time, visiting the injured that are being attended to in the Hospital Joan XXIII of Tarragona. <br>
<br>
The Reus airport is back in operation after the confusion initiated by the explosion. There were about one thousand 
people that could not be evacuated after the ETA sent a warning to the daily Egin and to Avui newspapers about 
today's bombing projected to be at 19:30 and 20:00 hours. However that only gave five minutes notice before the 
explosion at the airport. The second device, located in the hotel CAMBRILS PRINCEP, had the same amount of 
time to evacuate, but was probably able to avoid injury to those located there. The third device exploded in a central 
street of Salou.<br>

<p><font size=5><strong>Intel Brief -- ETA: Basque Homeland and Freedom </strong></font><br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>OVERVIEW: <br>
</strong></font>Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA), a terrorist organization founded in 1959 and dedicated to promoting Basque 
independence. The group began its terrorist activities in 1968. ETA regularly targets Spanish government officials, 
members of the military and security forces, and moderate Basques for assassination. The group has carried out 
numerous bombings against Spanish government facilities and economic targets. In recent years, the Spanish 
government has had more success in controlling ETA due in part to increased security cooperation with French 
authorities. In early 1989, the Spanish government held a series of meetings in Algeria with ETA representatives in an 
attempt to reach an agreement ending the campaign of terrorism. <br>
<br>
ETA has killed about 800 people in Spain since 1968. The ETA continue to operate in the south of France and 
occasionally bomb local government institutions, travel agencies, etc. Attacks against premises are often conducted 
with the help of local ultra-leftists <br>
<br>
The ETA has been accused of working for the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and there is good evidence to show a 
working relationship.They have also been unconfirmed links to other South American nations either as political 
activists, or working for government or rebel organizations carrying out terrorist attacks on their behalf.<br>
<br>
Until now ETA attacks against public sites usually occur late in the evening, in an apparent attempt to minimize 
casualties. However, there have been a number of murders of Spanish government employees and Basque 
moderates. ETA occasionally stages attacks against Spanish state and business interests in Italy<br>
<br>
ETA may also stage attacks against French business and state-related premises in protest at France's help to Spain 
in its efforts to counter ETA in the French and Spanish Basque countries.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>OTHER:</strong></font><br>
On Saturday 4 April the British newspaper the Guardian reported that all the leaders of the Basque separatist 
organization ETA had been captured in a police raid in France. While the claim that all leaders of the group were 
arrested seems highly unlikely, this may be part of the reason for renews violence and the new violence against the 
public. <br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>ACTIVITIES IN 1996</strong></font><br>
The ETA has claimed responsibility for, and provided photographs of, a Spanish prison officer it kidnapped in 
January.<br>
<br>
The group claimed responsibility for killing former Spanish Basque socialist leader Fernando Mugica in February. <br>
<br>
On 14 February Jose Tomas y Valiente, Professor of Law at the Autonomous University in Madrid, who was shot 
dead by an armed gunman, believed to be a member of the Basque armed group Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA). <br>
<br>
They have also claimed responsibility for a grenade attack on the Civil Guard barracks in Urdax in June which 
caused damage but no injuries.<br>
<br>
<font size=4><strong>ACTIVITIES IN 1995</strong></font><br>
The following information is from the United States Department of State, in their report &quot;1995 Patterns of Global 
Terrorism&quot; <br>
<br>
In 1995, Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA) terrorists conducted attacks on Spanish rail lines and stations, banks, 
police officers, and political figures&oacute;including the assassination of the Partido Popular mayoral candidate in San 
Sebastian and the attempted assassination of the leading contender for the prime ministership. In addition, ETA 
targeted French interests in Spain in 1995. In February a suspected ETA bomb exploded at a French-owned bank.<br>
<br>
Following a joint Spanish-French operation that thwarted a plot to assassinate King Juan Carlos while he vacationed 
in Majorca last August, suspected ETA members or supporters tossed molotov cocktails at a Citroen car dealership 
in Navarre, destroying five vehicles. In mid-December suspected ETA members detonated a car bomb in Madrid, 
one of the worst attacks in years that claimed at least six lives and wounded 15 others.<br>

<TITLE>New Years Eve Report</TITLE>

<BODY>
<H3>Happy New Year!...Seek Cover, not Concealment</H3>
<B>By Steve Macko, Managing Editor</B>
<P>
ERRI wishes all our friends and subscribers a very Happy New Year!!
Everyone please stay safe and don't forget to take cover at midnight.
<P>
For our friends in other countries who may not understand the above
sentence -- Many people in the United States, and especially in urban
areas, have a tendency to celebrate the New Year at midnight by firing
guns indiscriminately into the air.  They usually don't realize that
the bullets must come down somewhere or, that in many cases, bullets can crash through windows at a location many blocks from where they were fired.
<P>
After your editor had written the above, he came across the following news report:
<P>
In New Orleans, a massive publicity campaign has been launched in
effort to stem the tide of using guns as New Year's noisemakers.
Posters, flyers, billboards and television and radio commericials
are telling people, "Falling bullets kill."
<P>
On New Year's Eve in 1994, an 11-year-old boy in Phoenix and a
50-year-old woman in Atlanta were killed by New Year's gunfire. 
A police helicopter in Riverside, California was hit by bullets
apparently fired by New Years Eve celebrants.  The pilot was wounded and the fuel tank of the helicopter was punctured, forcing an emergency landing
<P>
The problem of gunfire used to be much in worse in Los Angeles, But, since 1990, all ammunition sales in the weeks leading up to New Year's Eve has been banned. When the law was first instituted, gun shop owners said that it wouldn't work.  Statistics would seem to indicate, however, that the regulation has had some positive effect; calls to police about New Year's gunfire fell in L.A. from 706 in 1989 to 265 in 1992.
<P>
Experts say that most people who shoot into the air on New Year's Eve
are good people who just are not thinking about what they are doing.
Most people don't realize, or don't remember, that bullets fall at
lethal speeds after they have reached their apogee and come back to earth.
<P>
To relate to it on a personal level, your editor, who lives in a quiet
suburban neighborhood, can attest to hearing several "Pop ... pop ... pop ... pop's" every year at the midnight hour.  And... he always tries to stay away from the windows. <G>

<H2>Amtrak 'Capital Limited' hits MARC No. 286; 12 Dead</H2>

Chicago, IL, February 16, 1996 --A Chicago-bound Amtrak "Capital
Limited" passenger train tonight ran head-on into a MARC
commuter train near Silver Spring, MD. An explosion and fire
resulted, as well as the derailment of several cars of both
trains.  According to Montgomery County Fire Officials, twelve
(12) people were killed and at least 36 others were injured,
some critically. The crash happened at approximately
5:45p.m.EST, in a major switching area for the Washington rail
corridor.
<P>

"We grabbed two or three of the more severely injured and
immediately loaded them into ambulances," volunteer firefighter
Brian Hall told reporters shortly after the accident. "The
people were frantically yelling..because of the tremendous shock
of what had happened...several of them panicked", Hall
continued. Firefighters said that they transported at least 21
people to Suburban Hospital in Silver Spring and Holy Cross
Hospital in Bethesda. Some of the victims were said to have
suffered smoke inhalation, and others had bumps, bruises, and
broken bones.
<P>

 Neighbors said that they heard a large explosion and then saw a
"fireball" engulf the front of one train as the two trains
impacted. Large amounts of smoke quickly filled the residential
neighborhood surrounding the tracks. An unidentified eyewitness
said that she heard the collision from three blocks away and
immediately ran to the scene to see what was the matter.  When
she arrived, she said that the scene was "total chaos" and that
smoke, fire, and screaming people were "everywhere". The woman
said that many of the Amtrak passengers exited the train by
themselves, but that the people on the commuter train weren't so
lucky.
<P>

According to an Amtrak spokesperson, Cliff Black, only ten
people on the Amtrak train received minor injuries. All of the
dead and seriously injured were reportedly on the MARC train,
which according to at least one witness, may have been stopped
at the time of the impact.  A Montgomery County administrator
said that several bodies are still on or in the wreckage of the
MARC cars and may not be moved until the local and state police,
and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have had an
opportunity to begin their preliminary investigation into the
crash. 
<P>

No cause for the calamity has yet been established.  The "black
boxes" that contain details of the motion, speed, and operating
procedures taken were removed from one of the trains at about
11:00p.m. this evening and have been turned over to the NTSB for
evaluation.  Montgomery County Police would not speculate in
regard to any of the other details surrounding the tragedy.  An
officer told ENN that "it is entirely too early to tell anything
about what caused this tragedy...but I can assure you, we'll get
to the bottom of it."

<font size=5><strong>PIPE BOMBINGS EXPLODE: BOTH REAL AND IMAGINED</strong></font><br>
By Alijandra Mogilner<br>
<br>
The 28 July shutdown of San Jose airport because of a bomb hoax was only one of dozens of such copycat 
bomb incidents, either real or fake, in California following the bombing at the Olympics in Atlanta and the 
probable attack on TWA Flight 800 in New York.<br>
<br>
The San Jose airport was shut down for about 30 minutes after a flight attendant for Alaska Airlines found a 
note on a food tray that read &quot;Bomb on board&quot; during a flight from Portland. All 128 passengers and 12 crew 
members were taken off the plane and their luggage was searched after landing in San Jose. The airport shut 
down inconvenienced hundreds of flyers and cost the airport and airlines a substantial amount of money.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, San Francisco area law enforcement groups had to deal with several bomb scares on 30 July. The 
San Francisco Hall of Justice was partially evacuated for an hour after the district attorney's office received a 
bomb threat that had been telephoned to a local television station. The call was a hoax. In the town of Moss 
Beach in San Matero County, the sheriff's bomb squad investigated a suspected paper bag bomb outside a 
grocery store. The contents consisted of road flares, a shotgun shell and a fake trigger. The city of San Rafael 
had several &quot;bottle bombs&quot; actually explode at an industrial park during the lunch hour. There was no damage 
caused by the bombs.<br>
<br>
Police public affairs officers in the Bay Area say such a rash of fake bombs are to be expected after a highly 
publicized attack, such as the one in Atlanta. After the Oklahoma City Bombing, there were over 200 threats to 
federal buildings recorded. However, police, fire and other emergency services must take threats seriously and 
they cost everyone a great deal in both time and money.<br>
<br>
However, law officers in San Diego County, some 800 miles south of San Francisco, are not taking bomb 
scares so calmly. There have been an increasing number of very real bombing incidents in the area this year, and 
pipe bombs are by far the most popular device used.<br>
<br>
San Diego Police logged a &quot;normal&quot; number of bomb calls over the weekend: four on Saturday and one on 
Sunday. But Saturday was much busier for the sheriff's department. They had a very real pipe bomb to defuse. 
It measured 4 inches by 2 1/2 inches and was found about a mile from the Olympic training facility in Chula 
Vista.<br>
<br>
&quot;We opened it up, and it was a live pipe bomb,&quot; Sgt. Conrad Grayson, head of the Sheriff's Department bomb 
and arson squad, said.<br>
<br>
On average, sheriff's investigators handle about 350 bomb calls a year, of which about 70 percent are pipe 
bombs or other explosive devices, Grayson said. The remainder are either fake telephoned threats, or 
suspicious packages, some of which are destroyed with an explosive countercharge. The last few years have 
seen an increase in the number of pipe-bomb makers who wrap the devices with nails and other sharp objects 
to &quot;guarantee a shrapnel zone,&quot; Grayson said.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's starting to get crazy out there,&quot; said Grayson. &quot;The last few summers have been fairly routine, but right now 
bombs are on a lot of people's minds.&quot;<br>
<br>
The most notorious local pipe-bomb incident was the 1989 blast on La Jolla Village Drive that destroyed the 
van of Sharon Rogers, wife of the skipper of the U.S. Navy cruiser Vincennes after the vessel had shot down 
an Iranian airliner. The case was never solved.<br>
<br>
Grayson says the most likely type of person to build pipe bombs are those that have a lot of guns at home and 
wear camouflage. &quot;They like to play soldier.&quot; According to Grayson, people who build pipe bombs are almost 
always white males who fall into two main groups:<br>
<br>
-- Teens from 13 to 17, especially 14-year-olds, who for some reason are particularly fascinated with 
explosives. &quot;They make the most bombs and take the most chances,&quot; he<br>
said.<br>
<br>
-- Adults, mostly in the 21-41 age range. &quot;These are boy- men, the guys who don't grow up,&quot; Grayson said.<br>
<br>
Criminologists from San Francisco State University emphasize that there is a big difference between people 
who plant bombs and people who make idle threats to plant bombs. &quot;A person who actually plants a bomb is 
typically looking for revenge,'' says Michael Rustigan a professor of criminology at SFSU. &quot;Their motivation 
may be quite abstract -- a grudge against the government or `foreigners,' and a desire to strike back at them. 
They harbor a great deal of deep hostility, even rage.''<br>
<br>
Crank callers making bomb threats, on the other hand, tend to be young males who are ``idle and bored, 
looking for kicks,'' said Rustigan. &quot;They make the threat, they see the results of the fuss they caused on the 
news, and they enjoy a great sense of power, of self-worth.''<br>
<br>
Rustigan said pipe bombers may cause less damage individually than people who set off truly huge bombs, but 
that they are collectively just as dangerous.<br>
<br>
&quot;Eighty percent of the bombs that are exploded in this country are pipe bombs,'' said Rustigan. ``Both the 
materials and the instructions are ubiquitous. We worry about international terrorism, but the real threat is right 
here -- it's homegrown. There are thousands of people across this country who know how to make and use 
these devices.''</p>

<H2>ERRI Preliminary Report; Virtual Disaster Networks</H2>
By: Clark Staten, ERRI CEO</center>
<P>

Chicago, IL, March 11, 1996 --A little over one year ago, the
Emergency Response & Research Institute undertook an exploratory
examination of emergency service computer networks. This study
had a particular emphasis in regard to the use of networks and
the Internet, as it applies to disaster preparedness and
response situations. The results of this preliminary study are
outlined below.
<P>
<HR>
<B>Hypothesis:</B>
<P>
It is proposed that private and government computer networks and
the Internet could be used to exchange planning information,
transfer working information during disasters, coordinate mutual
aid, and obtain needed personnel and resources during a large
scale incident. Further, that this networking could begin with
one local system and grow proportionately to the size of any
disaster....up to and including a national or international
response.  By utilizing state of the art computer equipment and
networking tools, it is believed that better cooperation and
coordination can be achieved and lives saved. 
<P>
<HR> 
<B>Methodology:</B>
<P>
The study was begun by announcing it's intent and purpose
through a number of channels, including;
<P>

 Internet News Groups
<BR> 

 Commercial Computer Services (ie.Compuserve, etc) 
<BR>

 Emergency magazines and periodicals 
<BR>

 Via e-mail and U.S. Mail, to interested individuals and groups
<BR>

Comments, questions, suggestions and analysis of a concept
called a "virtual disaster network" were solicited from all
interested parties.
<P>
Next, a survey of currently available computer resources was
done via the Internet. Specifically related servers and services
were identified and cataloged in regard to their purpose and
utility, and potential for use in a larger network effort. Both
data/information collection sites and dissemination sites were
both identified during the course of this survey. A number of
individuals contributed a variety of information about different
sites and some pertinent data about the capabilities of the
personnel operating them.
<P>

A public attempt was made to gain an understanding of the
computer and networking capabilities of a number of large and
small emergency agencies, admittedly without much success.
Voluntary participation in such a survey didn't appear to be
viable, due to an apparent reluctance on the part of many public
agencies to participate. It is believed that many systems have
had some components that could allow interactively, but that
they have not voluntarily made such information public.  It is
also believed that some agencies may also have "links" with some
other agencies. 
<P>
<HR> 
<B>Preliminary Findings</B>
<P>
 Anecdotal reports suggest that the degree of computerization
varies greatly across the country and that little or no
standardization of equipment exists either within or between
agencies. Many agency communications centers contain only
proprietary hardware and software, designed to meet individual
system needs...with little consideration of any possibility of
inter-operability.
<P>
With the exception of the NCIC (National Crime Information
Center) and some other confidential/secure law enforcement
networks, little interactively presently exists. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) can activate UHF, VHF, and
satellite radio nets and a limited number of portable computer
links to it's headquarters, in times of specific need.  No other
formal (government sponsored) Fire, EMS, or disaster networks
were identified that regularly facilitate an exchange of
intelligence, trends, solutions, or planning efforts between
systems.
<P>

 The a majority of primary links that currently exist between
differing emergency systems are informal and personal, rather
than formal or organizational. Very little vital information is
currently being shared between systems, except by individual
"computer literate" members of each department. It would appear
that very few emergency agencies currently have active Internet
connections, even on a dial-up basis. A better national survey
of these assets must be made before additional analysis can be
undertaken.
<P>

 Few, if any, emergency agencies have undertaken any dedicated
computer communication linkage between themselves and other
nearby (mutual aid) systems.  This deficit is particularly
evident in regard to relationships between differing kinds of
agencies. (i.e. few Fire/EMS agencies have any computer linkage
to any Police Agency) Fewer than twenty (20) systems were
identified, nation-wide, that had formal connections with other
agencies. 
<P>
 A primary consideration in most disaster situations is that
communications. Or rather, a primary disaster difficulty is
communicating on already overwhelmed radio, telephone, or
cellular communications frequencies. The problem is compounded
when an emergency manager begins to attempt to communicate
between agencies on differing frequencies and interact and
coordinate essential and simultaneous actions of field
personnel. It is believed that computer linkages, be they
permanent or virtual, may be a major answer to those problems,
so frequently encountered in large scale incidents.
<P>
<HR>
<B>Proposal</B>
<P>
Based on the preliminary data that we have acquired in the past
year, it is respectfully suggested that a demonstration grant or
other major funding would be necessary to provide "seed-money"
for a test of this concept. Much of the money would be used for
establishing high through-put TCP/IP connections and the
connecting of Internet dedicated landlines in a specific area.
After "wiring" multiple agencies, at least one dedicated server
would be required for the purposes of storing and dissemination
of information, and real time communications.
<P>

On any system, in its simplest form, e-mail could be utilized
for the sharing of intelligence and planning information, and
the storing of reference documents. A World-Wide-Website could
also be added to the server to make accessing of pertinent
documents easy for participants. As the number of agencies
increased, the size of a disaster dictated, or the complexity of
operations increased, additional servers could be brought
on-line in an increasingly larger area. "Live data connections"
could be made with other dispatch centers and maintained for the
duration of an emergency.
<P>

Dispatch information, mutual aid requests, and requests for
logistics and materials would be sent by computer, rather than
phone or radio. As previously mentioned, laptop computers with
cellular modems, or dedicated UHF or 800Mhz data frequencies
could be used from the scene to transmit updates and make
requests. The utility of using dedicated radio frequencies for
data communications and use of the Internet has been
demonstrated by the U.S. Navy and other military organizations.
<P>
<HR>
<B>Conclusions</B>
<P>

 In light of our preliminary data and review of this concept, we
believe that the idea of a "Virtual Disaster Network" is a most
viable alternative to the current state of the art in disaster
management. Additionally, this idea can be begun within
individual systems and between local agencies without major
costs, aside from the "hardware and connections necessary to
implement these new data communications channels. There are,
undoubtedly, some technical issues to be resolved, but none that
appear insurmountable. 
<P>
The primary difficulty that we anticipate in the implementation
of this idea involves overcoming a resistance on the part of
emergency service and communications managers to implement the
aforementioned data communications links. Some reluctance may
also be encountered within dispatch centers, as additional
computer skills and duties are required of dispatchers. Both
groups are familiar with and very oriented to the instantaneous
flow of information provided by voice/radio communications. A
period of re-learning may be necessary to facilitate computer
data exchanges, rather than simple voice transmissions.
<P>
 The Emergency Response & Research Institute (ERRI) has
committed itself to a continuing examination of this concept,
and a refinement of the applications, connections, and content
hereto. We would welcome comments, questions, suggestions, and
public comment in regard to the idea of further development of a
"Virtual Disaster Network". Our ultimate objective would be to
actually design and implement at least one working network of
smaller agencies, which could be replicated and installed at any
number of server sites throughout the country.  It could then
become an easy task to link servers sites into a national
network or even an international network of emergency and
disaster organizations.
<P>
<HR>
(Ed. note: It should be noted that all research funding for this project,
to date, has been privately provided by ERRI and it's
subsidiary, the EmergencyNet News Service.  It would appear that
the only feasible way to further test the utility and
capabilities of this concept would be to obtain outside funding
and technical support.  ERRI would welcome offers of sponsorship
or other support in order to continue these efforts.)

<H2>Two Dead, Ten Injured in NYC Fire</H2>
By Paul Anderson, Metro Correspondent
<P>

Three people, including two small children, were killed and
ten other people were injured when fire swept through an
apartment building in The Bronx on Thursday morning.  The fire
started at about 0825 EDT on the second floor of the three-story
brick building.  It took firefighters about 90 minutes to bring
the blaze under control.  Authorities are suspecting arson was
the cause of the fire.
<P>

Assistant Chief James Murtagh said, "We suspect that the three
who died were on the third floor and fell from the third floor
to the second floor.  It's my opinion that all three were dead 
long before the fire building collapsed."  Murtagh also explained
why he suspected arson was the cause, "The burn pattern is
extensive.  It's probably one of the worst fires we've had of
this magnitude in this short period of time."
<P>

Among the injured were five members of the FDNY.  All of the
injured firefighters reportedly received minor injuries.  The
other five injured victims were civilians.  Three of those
victims, including a 3-year-old child, are said to be in critical
condition after receiving very serious burns.
<P>

Some of the victims did reportedly jump from the windows of the
burning building.  David Billig, a spokesman for the FDNY EMS
said, "Five people have been taken to hospitals with injuries
including burns and trauma.  The reports from the scene said
there were people jumping out of the building."

<H2>Gwinnett County, GA Police Search for Stolen Explosives/Truck  </H2>

   Gwinnett County, GA police today are searching for a large quantity of explosives stolen over the weekend from a plant in a northern Atlanta suburb.  Sgt. Dan Branch said the explosives were stolen from Controlled Blasting Inc. in Norcross, GA on Sunday evening.
<P>
   <B>A nationwide alert had been issued</B> for a company truck carrying the explosives and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) had joined Gwinnett police in the probe of the robbery, Branch added.
<P>
   "A person or persons unknown stole a white 1986 one-ton flatbed Ford truck...it had in it 24 pounds of dynamite, 108 blasting caps, and 29 tubes of ANFO (ammonium nitrate with a fuel mixture)," Sgt. Branch told reporters.
<P>
      This was not the first theft of explosives from this Norcross firm, according to Branch.  On Oct. 8, 1995, 1,000 blasting caps and 550 pounds of ammonium nitrate were also stolen from the company. Sgt. Branch said, "That case is still not resolved." "Whether or not it's related to this theft, we do not know," he continued.
<P>
          The truck has "Controlled Blasting Inc." printed on the front doors in black lettering on a white surface. At the rear of the truck is a special compartment, that carries explosives, with the number "44" printed on it in large black letters. The truck's Georgia license plate number is<B> SB 9981</B>.
<P>
   Gwinnett County Authorities warned that anyone who spots the truck should not approach it. Anyone locating it or having knowledge of the incident should immediately contact their local BATF office or call<B> Gwinnett County police</B> at<B> (770) 513-5300</B>.
<P>
Published by ENN as a public service to assist Gwinnett County Authorities in their search. Please contact them with any pertinent information.

<strong>**LEAD STORY**</strong></p>
<p><br>
<font size=5><strong>INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE SAUDI 
TERRORIST ATTACK CONTINUES</strong></font><br>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor<br>
<br>
Under a very hot sun on Thursday, FBI agents and Saudi authorities searched for clues at the U.S. 
military complex that was victim of a terrorist bombing on Tuesday night. Suspicion for the attack is still 
being focused on Muslim militants who are opposed to the 5,000 U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia.<br>
<br>
Working in 100-degree heat, the FBI agents combed through mounds of concrete and twisted metal. 
The investigation at the crime scene will continue around the clock until the investigation is finished. It is 
expected that the agents will stay in Saudi Arabia for several weeks.<br>
<br>
So far, there has been no direct evidence that any foreign sponsorship was involved in the terrorist 
attack. However, on Friday, investigators were starting to believe that a very high explosive was used in 
the attack, such as TNT, and it appears, for whatever unknown reason at this time, that this might ... 
repeat ... might point to foreign involvement.<br>
<br>
Many experts and analysts on Thursday started to express their opinion that tension and violence may 
continue indefinitely in the Saudi kingdom. It is beginning to appear that there is growing opposition by 
Islamic militants to the U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia and of a very conservative society comint 
to terms -- or not coming to terms -- with rapid change. Much like American society in the late 1960s.<br>
<br>
One Middle East analyst said, &quot;You have a situation where Saudi Arabia has serious economic 
problems, social problems, political problems and succession problems. They are all coming together at 
the same time with unusual intensity.&quot;<br>
<br>
And, unfortunately, the Americans may be right in the middle of this change in Saudi society. The 
presence of non-Muslim soldiers in the country of that is home of Islam's holiest cities has upset many in 
the deeply conservative society.<br>
<br>
The possibility of Iranian or Iraqi involvement in the bombing has not been ruled out, but most U.S. 
experts and analysts believe that it is far more likely that the attack -- like the one in November of 1995 
-- was domestic in origin.<br>
<br>
One U.S. official said, &quot;This is as much an anti-regime action as an anti-American one. I think what 
people want to do here is attack the symbols of the monarchy and that would mean the security 
establishment and their partners, the international legitimacy that they (ruling officials) enjoy, and that 
means the relationship with the United States.&quot;<br>
<br>
Experts believe that there are more than 15,000 Mujahadeen in Saudi Arabia who fought with Islamic 
fundamentalist militants in Afghanistan, who have now returned to Saudi Arabia and have formed small 
cells. They are being seen as taking advantage of Saudi Arabia's inner turmoil and are seeking to purify 
the country of foreign influences.<br>
<br>
Anthony Cordesman, a highly-regarded military analyst at the Center for Strategic and International 
Studies, predicted, &quot;There will be at least 10 to 15 years in Saudi Arabia and the entire southern Gulf 
region of a very difficult adjustment to new levels of wealth, population growth and incredible social 
change ... and with that will come violence and political uncertainty.&quot;<br>
<br>
On Thursday, U.S. authorities admitted that they were not prepared for an explosion as big and as 
powerful as Tuesday night's truck bombing. That was because their threat assessment was based upon 
the 250 pound blast that occurred in November of 1995.<br>
<br>
U.S. Major General Kurt Anderson and Brigador General Terry Schwalier, the commander of U.S. 
forces at Dhahran, both said that they did not anticipate such a huge bomb. In all fairness to the generals, 
nobody anticipated a 5,000 pound terrorist bomb.<br>
<br>
Schwalier said that based on the assessment that was made, he was satisfied with security arrangements 
in Dhahran. General Anderson said, &quot;Every experience, no matter how tragic it might be, is a learning 
experience. We will use this as a learning experience and, as you might expect, significant changes will 
occur.&quot;<br>
<br>
Because of the terrorist bombing, the U.S. military will act to improve protection of its troops abroad 
from terrorist attack. U.S. Army General John Shalikashvili, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
said, &quot;We must be as clever as we can to find perhaps different things that we can do to protect the 
safety for our men and women that they deserve.&quot;<br>
<br>
It was the General's opinion that moving barriers further away from buildings was not an answer in itself 
because terrorists would simply use a &quot;bigger and bigger bomb.&quot;<br>
<br>
The bomb that exploded on Tuesday night was about 100 feet away from the apartment building that 
took the brunt of the blast. Shalikashvili said that he and other military officers expressed surprise at the 
size and magnitude of the bomb.<br></p>
<hr>
<p><font size=4><strong>Related Events</strong></font></p>
<p><br>
In other related developments on Thursday, the United States Senate with the terrorist bombing in mind, 
unanimously passed legislation that will allow the U.S. military to train law enforcement agencies in the 
U.S. against terrorism that involves nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.<br>
<br>
Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, the co-author of the measure, said, &quot;We are woefully unprepared to deal 
with this kind of catastrophic act of terrorism if it occurs. The police departments, the fire departments 
are on record as saying, 'We need help' and that's what we're trying to do here. This is not going to 
solve the problem. This is a beginning.&quot;<br>
<br>
ERRI fully agrees and supports the sentiments of the senator. ERRI has urged for passage of this 
measure because public safety departments in the U.S. are essentially unprepared to deal with the 
threats of nuclear, chemical and biological terrorism. <a href="/chembio2.htm"><strong>Click here to see March, 30, 1996 ENN Story on 
Chemical/Biological Preparedness</strong></a>
<P>
The measure will draw $150 million from the Pentagon budget and
$85 million from the Department of Energy for a variety of training and assistance programs. Among them are $35 million to develop expertise and strategies for medical teams responding to nuclear, chemical and biological attacks. $29 million will be used for research into detection methods for 
weapons of mass destruction and $15 million will be used to conduct emergency response exercises 
with local law enforcement agencies. Other monies will go toward increasing federal efforts to intercept such weapons at the border.
Nunn said that terrorist acts have replaced the threat of nuclear war with Russia as the foremost national security concern.
<p>
Despite the unanimous 96-0 vote in the senate for the measure, the fate of the legislation in the House is 
said to be uncertain. Some House representatives have said that they were not prepared to endorse the 
legislation in its entirety. Cost of the measure was given as the main concern.<br>
<br>
One Congressman, Charles Schumer of New York, though is urging for passage. Schumer said, &quot;Simply 
put, U.S. cities are not prepared to deal with a terrorist attack. If we do not prepare now, innocent men 
and women will lose their lives later.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sam Nunn added, &quot;I, like many of my colleagues, believe there is a high liklihood that a chemical or 
biological incident will take place on American soil in the next several years. We do not want to be in a 
posture of demanding to know why we weren't prepared. We do not want a domestic Pearl Harbor.&quot;</p>

<TITLE>AOL Gold Trojan Horse Virus</TITLE>
<!-- Comment Here -->
</HEAD>
<BODY> 
<H2>Information on the AOLGOLD Trojan Program</H2>
<P>
The AOLGOLD Trojan program was recently discovered on America Online (AOL).
 Notice about the Trojan has been circulated to all America Online subscribers.  Notice about the Trojan and a copy of the Trojan program were supplied to CIAC by Doug Bigelow, who is on the staff of America Online.
<P>

Apparently, an e-mail message is being circulated that contains an attached archive file named AOLGOLD.ZIP.  A README file that is in the archive describes it as a new and improved interface for the AOL online service.  Note that there is no such program as AOLGOLD.  Also, simply reading an e-mail message or even downloading an included file will not do damage to your machine.  You must execute (or run) the downloaded file to release the Trojan and have it cause damage.
<P>

If you unzip the archive, you get two files: INSTALL.EXE and README.TXT.  The README.TXT file again describes AOLGOLD as a new and improved interface to the AOL online service.  The INSTALL.EXE program is a self-extracting ZIP archive.  When you run the install program, it extracts 18 files onto your hard drive:
<P>

MACROS.DRV VIDEO.DRV INSTALL.BAT ADRIVE.RPT SUSPEND.DRV ANNOY.COM MACRO.COM SP-NET.COM SP-WIN.COM MEMBRINF.COM DEVICE.COM TEXTMAP.COM HOST.COM REP.COM EMS2EXT.SYS EMS.COM EMS.SYS README.TXT
<P>

The file list includes another README.TXT file. If you examine the new README.TXT file, it starts out with "Ever wanted the Powers of a Guide" and continues with some crude language.  The README.TXT file indicates that the included program is a guide program that can be used to kick other people off of AOL.
<P>
If you stop at this point and do nothing but examine the unzipped files with the TYPE command, your machine will not be damaged.  The following three files contain the Trojan program:
<BR>
MACROS.DRV VIDEO.DRV INSTALL.BAT
<P>
The rest of the files included in the archive appear to have been grabbed at random to simply fill up the archive and make it look official.
<HR>

<H4>ACTIONS</H4>
<P>
The Trojan program is started by running the INSTALL.BAT file.  The INSTALL.BAT file is a simple batch file that renames the VIDEO.DRV file to VIRUS.BAT and then runs it.  VIDEO.DRV is an amateurish DOS batch file that starts deleting the contents of several critical directories on your C: drive, including:
<P>

c:\
<BR>
c:\dos
<BR>
c:\windows
<BR>
c:\windows\system
<BR>
c:\qemm
<BR>
c:\stacker
<BR>
c:\norton
<P>

It also deletes the contents of several other directories, including those for several online services and games, such as:
<P>

c:\aol20
<BR>
c:\prodigy
<BR>
c:\aol25
<BR>
c:\mmp169
<BR>
c:\cserve
<BR>
c:\doom
<BR>
c:\wolf3d
<P>

When the batch file completes, it prints a crude message on the screen and attempts to run a program named DoomDay.EXE.  Bugs in the batch file prevent the DOOMDAY.EXE program from running.  Other bugs in the file cause it to delete itself if it is run from any drive but the C: drive.  The programming style and bugs in the batch file indicates that the Trojan writer appears to have little programming experience.
<P>
<HR>


<H4>RECOVERY:</H4>
<P>
<B>**WARNING** Do not copy any files onto your hard disk before trying to recover your hard drive.</B>
<P>

The files are deleted with the DOS del command, and can be recovered with the DOS undelete command.  The files are still on your disk, only the directory entries have been removed.  If you copy any new files onto your hard disk, they will likely be written over the deleted files, making it impossible to recover the deleted files.
<P>

If you have delete protection installed on your system, recovery will be relatively easy.  If not, the DOS undelete command can be used, but you will have to supply the first letter of each file name as it is recovered.  In many cases, you will probably want to restore the directories by reinstalling them from the original installation disks, but do that last.  You must recover any unreplaceable files first using undelete and then replace any others by copying or reinstalling them from the distribution disks.
<P>

<B>To recover the system:</B>
<P>

1. Boot the system with a clean, locked floppy containing the recovery program for the recovery files you have installed, or the DOS UNDELETE.EXE program if you do not have recovery files installed.
<P>

2. Type the VIRUS.BAT file to get a list of the directories the Trojan tried to delete. Ignore any directories that don't exist on your machine.
<P>

3. Run the recovery program and recover your files. You may have to help it find the recovery files, such as MIRROR, which will be in the root directory. You may have to recover the MIRROR file first and then use it to recover the other files.
<P>

If you are using only the DOS undelete command, type:

   undelete directory
<P>

where directory is the name of the directory to examine. To undelete the files in the dos directory, use:

   undelete c:\dos
<P>

The undelete program will present you with a list of deleted files with the first letter replaced with a question mark. Without delete protection, you will have to supply this letter in order to undelete the file.
<P>

4. After you have restored as many files as you want or can using the UNDELETE command, replace any others by reinstalling them using the original installation disks.

The Operations staff at America Online has released the following bulletin to their users:
<P>

<B>- --BEGIN MESSAGE--</B>
<BR>

Dear Member:
<BR>

As you know, we strive to keep you informed on various issues regarding online safety.
<BR>

We want to take this opportunity to remind you about potential computer viruses and Trojan horses and how to protect your computer.  First, a virus is a program that is designed to spread and usually attaches itself to a program with the goal of spreading to other computers.  A Trojan horse is a program that is intended to corrupt your computer but has to be activated before it can be executed.  For example, a Trojan horse can be distributed as an attached file to an email but the file has to be downloaded and executed before harm is done.
<P>

If you receive email from unknown senders with an attached file, it is a good rule of thumb not to download the files.  In addition, if you ever receive a file in email you believe could cause problems, please forward it immediately to TOSEMAIL1, and explain your concerns to our Terms of Service staff.
<P>

We have received recent inquiries regarding a Trojan horse that is sent as an attached file in an email message entitled "AOLGOLD" and "Install.exe". It is important to understand that no virus or Trojan horse can be passed along by simply reading email.  However, we strongly urge that if you receive email with an attached file with this name not to download it.
<P>

Due to the private nature of electronic mail, we cannot scan files in email for viruses as we do with files in public areas of the service.
<P>

We have never had an occurrence of a virus or Trojan horse being spread through simply reading email.  In order for one to spread to your computer, you would have to proactively select the attached file and download it to your hard drive.  It is therefore advisable never to download attached files from an unknown sender.
<P>

AOL incorporates virus protection throughout the service and scans all posted software, text, and sound files in public areas. We also offer our members the Virus Information Center on AOL where you'll find information about the latest virus or Trojan horse, along with updates to all the popular commercial, shareware, and freeware anti-virus tools.  Keyword: VIRUS.
<P>

Thank you for taking an active role in maintaining a safe online environment.

<TITLE>Twin Suicide Car Bombers Strike in Gaza</TITLE>

Two suicide bombers were killed and 11 people were injured when two
car bombs exploded minutes apart this morning in the PLO-ruled Gaza
Strip.  PLO police said that the bombings were in retaliation of last
week's killing in Malta of Islamic Jihad leader Fathi Shakaki.  It has
been reported that Islamic Jihad has claimed responsbility for today's
blasts.
<P>

The two bombs went off a minute apart and about a half mile from one
another in the center of Gaza.  The first attack occurred near the
Kissufim crossing when a bus carrying Israeli child-care workers that
was being escorted by two IDF Jeeps.  The driver of the bus said a car
drove slowly in front of the lead jeep.  Then as the bus driver described
it, "The soldiers signaled for him to move aside, but he didn't respond.
The minute the jeep passed and I started to pass on the left, the car 
entered my lane and exploded."  Three soldiers and five women, who were
on the bus, were injured.
<P>

A witness who was on the bus said, "I was talking to my friend and suddenly 
I saw pieces of glass, chaos, screams.  The bus driver was covered in blood.
They took us off the bus, and then we heard another explosion."
<P>

The second blast occurred near a bus that was waiting for an IDF escort.
Soldiers who were alerted to the possibility of a suicide attack were
able to prevent the second suicide bomber from getting close to the
second bus.  The second suicide bomber was unable to get very close to
the bus and blew himself up about 50 yards away from the bus.
<P>

A hospital spokesman at Soroka Hospital in Beersheba said that all
eleven victims that were brought to their facility suffered only
light injuries.

<H2>"ABANDONED CALL" PROBLEM IN CHICAGO'S NEW 911 SYSTEM...</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

More than 98 percent of the 911 calls coming into the new
Chicago Emergency Communications Center are said to now be
answered in two rings or less.  That accomplishment has
pleased the designers of the $217 million facility.  But
another "glitch" seems to have been found in the system.  And,
this problem could be dangerous. It appears that several calls a day to 911 are somehow not
being connected.  Technicians at the new center and at the
Ameritech phone company have been looking into the problem
for a while now.
<P>

According to ECC records, several calls a day are being cut off
before a dispatcher can answer.  These are called "abandoned calls."
They may be the result of people just dialing 911 and then hanging
up.  But officials with the safety committee of Fraternal Order of
Police, Lodge 7, a police union, say that faulty transfers from
Ameritech's switching station are probably responsible.
<P>

Harold Kunz, who oversees the union safety committee, said that
he recently had a meeting with the head of the new 911 center,
William Corbett.  Kunz said, "There are some instances where people
dialed 911 and didn't get 911.  We were informed that they've had
some problems with Ameritech switching calls to the new center."
Mr. Kunz said that the problem itself is known, but the reason why
it is happening is not.
<P>

According to Kunz, this switching problem is potentially dangerous
to both citizens and police.  A person in a truly life-and-death
situation may call 911 and be cut off.  That person may not be able to 
have a second chance to redial 911 if they are in extreme danger or 
are being injured.
<P>

These problems have been reported in two days worth of dispatch records from
the new ECC that were leaked to a number of press agencies.  During the first 18 hours on
February 7th, 5,743 calls were made to 911.  Records show that 224
of the calls were considered "abandoned". During the first 12 hours of February 
8th, 3,029 calls were made to 911. 87 of those calls were considered "abandoned".
<P>

The records show that 85 percent of the abandoned calls were cut off
in less than two seconds.  This point is important.  It takes 1.6 seconds
for a call to 911 to be completed.  It is believed that if a person
were to call 911 and then decided to hang up, it would take more than
two seconds.  The recorded times would seem to indicate that the problem is elsewhere
and not just people "goofing around" with the phone system. It is more likely 
that the issue is related to a "switching problem" within the equipment itself.
<P>

William Corbett, the head of the Emergency Communications Center,
said that he is investigating the problem with the abandoned calls.
But he was careful to not just pin the blame on Ameritech.  Corbett said
that this problem and others have to be taken in perspective.  He
said that some bugs have been found in the huge and complex computer
system and have been corrected.  Other complaints, he said, were
unfounded.
<P>

Chicago Police Superintendant Matt Rodriguez, through a spokesman
said, "As one might expect, our objective is to have all aspects
of the system working flawlessly.  We're at the point now of fine-
tuning the system to continue raising the performance." A spokesman 
for Ameritech said that the phone company has been
asked by the City to investigate the abandoned calls to 911.  The
spokesman also said that it is too soon to say who and what is 
responsible for the problem.
<P>

In other complaints about the new communications system, police
officers have complained that it is sometimes taking too long
for dispatchers to give assignments to beat cars, even for crimes
in progress.  They also say that dispatchers do not always keep
a record of the locations of officers on the street.
<P>

Kunz gave an example of one incident that happened in the 3rd Police
District on Chicago's South Side.  Two officers became involved in
a fight at a fast-food restaurant during their 30 minute break.  They
called for a "10-1" (Officer needs help.).  But the dispatcher could 
not determine the location of the officers, even though the locations  
of where the officers are taking their 30 minute break is supposed to
be recorded on the computer.  Kunz said, "It's extremely important that 
dispatchers know where officers are."
<P>

We hope in future articles we can relate some good news about how
well the new communications system is working.  However, the Chicago
Fire Department is due to begin the change over to the new center this
month.  And that, most likely, could open another new "can of
worms", as the Fire/EMS dispatchers learn to use the new system and add 
an additional call load on the computers.

<H3>FIREFIGHTERS TURNED ARSONISTS...</H3>
<P>
By Steve Macko
<P>
(ENN) Nov. 17, 1995--A Federal Bureau of Investigation study of 25 cases of firefighter
arson in seven U.S. states and one Canadian province recently found 
that the number one motive was for excitement -- especially among young
firefighters who were eager to put their training to practical use
and been seen as heroes to fellow firefighters.  In the study, 66
men were found to be responsible for setting 182 fires.
<P>

In the State of South Carolina, for example, there were 40 arrests of
firefighters for the crime of arson in 1994.  An executive director
of the South Carolina Insurance News Service said, "This is not an
uncommon thing across the country.  Sometimes there is a tendency ...
that they get the bug to set one so they can go ahead and put it out."
<P>
Then there is the interesting story from a rural area in South Carolina.
Recently five members of the Arkwright Volunteer Fire Department have
been arrested for allegedly setting about 150 fires between 1991 and
1993.  The suspicious fires only involved vacant buildings or land
and reportedly caused no injuries.
<P>
The fire chief of the department, Vincent Sherbert, said that before
the five men were arrested, there was something about them that bothered
him.  Sherbert said, "Sometimes when we'd get an alarm at midnight, they
would be at the station."  What was unusual is that some of the men,
two of them former chiefs and one a former captain, lived as much as
20 minutes away from the fire station.
<P>
Authorities said that they believed that the motive for the arson fires 
was a desire to practice their firefighting skills.  The five suspects are currently
out on bail and all have left the volunteer department.
<P>
Some fire experts have expressed concern that with a decreasing number of fires, nationwide, that this trend of firefighter-caused arson fires may increase. They say that examples of the behavior have been reported in too many places for it
to be an abberation in the statistics.

EmergencyNet News Service
<BR>
For Immediate Release: 12/29/95- 17:00CST
<BR>
<H3>Dangerous Drug ALERT!!</H3>

The metropolitan NYC area has witnessed an major increase in the number of overdose patients it is treating.  This increase in O.D. call volume is being attributed to what appears to be, at present, a  designer drug. The drug, with a street name of POLO appears to be a  combination of Scopalomine and Heroin. UMDNJ-EMS in Newark, New Jersey has reported that <B>over 60 overdose patients have been treated within the past 24 hours. </B>
<P> 

Consistent with this significant rise in related call volume and  response trends and reminiscent of the "Tango & Cash"  & "China  White" crisis of the past, UMDNJ - EMS has issued a "Emergency  Memorandum" to all EMS systems and Emergency Departments. Additionally, NYC-EMS has issued an Operations Order to alert all pre-hospital care providers of the potential for increased activity related to this influx.
<P>

 Patients usually present with a significantly altered mental state followed by respiratory and cardiac arrest.  Resusitation of these patients require large doses of Naloxone (Narcan) and patients if successfully resusitated often experience agitation and seizures.   Additional pharmacological intervention with physostigmine and diazepam may be required to manage these clinical findings.
<P> 

It is not unusal to discover more then one patient experiencing these problems at a given location.  Experience with other "herion crisis" has taught EMS systems and providers to be prepared by increasing availabilty of opiate inhibitors/antagonists and bag valve mask manual resusitators to enhance the efficacy of patient care, at scenes where multiple patients are being encountered.
<P>

All EMS systems and Emergency Departments are encouraged to remain alert for patients presenting with similar symptoms and patient presentation trends. Caution is being urged by ERRI for other parts of the country, due to the fact that this drug may have been exported from the NYC/NJ area.
<P>

Responding agencies may notify ERRI of occurances of this type so that information can be further disseminated by calling (312) 631-ERRI -24hr. HOTLINE, faxing the information to (312) 631-4703, or e-mail enn@emergency.com.

<H2>Watford City Police Officer Killed in Shootout-LOD Death</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>
A police officer was killed in a shootout at the American Legion
Club in Watford City, North Dakota, on Wednesday.  Two other
men were held hostage for nine hours and were later freed unharmed.
The reason for the incident was apparently over the quality of
beer served in the bar.
<P>

The incident began at about 1700 CST, when the suspect, identified
as 41-year-old Robert Mead, Jr., walked into the American Legion
Club bar and complained about the quality of the beer that was
served.  Mead left and shortly returned with one lever-action
rifle and semi-automatic rifle.  A witness said, "He fired a shot
into the ceiling and then said, 'Now, bring me a real beer."
<P>

Police officer Keith Braddock responded to the call of shots fired
at the bar and was shot and killed in an exchange of gunfire with
Mead.  Mead suffered a gunshot wound to the thigh.
<P>

Watford City Police and state police surrounded the building and
tried to negotiate with Mead for several hours.  It was reported
that Mead spoke with officers on Braddock's police radio until
the batteries went dead.
<P>

The police chief of Watford City said that Mead was well-known to
his department.  The chief said, "We've had troubles with him before.
He appears unstable."
<P>

At about 0220 CST on Thursday, Mead calmly walked out of the
building and was taken into custody without further incident.
Watford City is located in northwestern North Dakota and has
a population of about 1,800 people.

<H2>Recovery Effort Called "Extremely Difficult" by Rescuers</H2>
By Steve Macko, ENN Editor
<P>

MIAMI (ENN) - The recovery effort and the investigation of what caused ValuJet Flight 592 to crash into the Florida Everglades continued on Monday.  It was reported that no bodies were recovered and only a small part of the plane were recovered all day on Sunday.
<P>

National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) vice-chairman Robert Francis said on Sunday, "We're going to have to be prepared for the fact that this may take some time."
<P>

Experts are being called in to think of ideas on how the investigation into the inky swamp should proceed.  Officials from the Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Navy, NTSB, state and local agencies are said to not even be close to a consensus on what to do.  One of the better ideas, even though it would be difficult, would be to dike off the crash site and then drain it.
<P>

Police sources said on Sunday that some body parts were found, but federal officials said that they were not aware of that. Navy divers have been brought into the area to aid in the search.  It seems like the Everglades literally swallowed the plane.  Visibility in the water is measured in inches.  An NTSB investigator said, "They're down to less than an inch as far as underwater visibility.  A lot of it is being done by feel."
<P>

The depth of the water ranges from 6-inches to 5-feet, but underneath the water is muck that may be as deep as 30- to 40-feet.  Navy experts in underwater salvage recovery are bringing in sonar equipment to help with the search.
<P>

NTSB investigators, who have experience in investigating hundreds of plane crashes say that this is "the most difficult scene that they have ever encountered."  The crash site is very inaccessible, far from any road and can only be reached by helicopter or airboat.

<TITLE>Chicago 911 Center Update</TITLE>

<H3>UPDATE ON THE CHICAGO EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS CENTER...</H3>
<BR>
<P>
By Steve Macko
<P>
<BR>
In our continuing report on the new $217 million Chicago 911
Communications Center that is located at 1411 West Madison Street
on the City's West Side, some glitches have been found in the computer
system of what is being called the nation's most sophisticated emergency
communications system.  This new center is replacing the more than
30-year old communication system at Chicago Police Headquarters, located
at 1121 South State Street, where police dispatchers still keep track
of the 911 calls and the squad cars on the street with handwritten cards
and sit in front of blinking maps.  The new center is highly computerized
and has what is described as state-of-the-art software that is so
detailed it has information about every street and building in the City 
of Chicago.
<P>

The police department is slowly bringing districts on-line at the
new center.  Currently, eight districts -- 16,17,19,20,23, and 24 are
being dispatched out of the new center.  Districts 13 and 14 have
recently been added to the list.  Officials at the center say that they
hope to have all 25 police districts dispatched from Madison Street
by the first of the year.  The computerized system will be supplemented
by a more sophisticated mobile computers by the end of 1996.  The
mobile computer system will allow patrol officers on the street to
retrieve basic information without verbally interacting with dispatchers
and will help in the time-consuming task of writing out reports.
<P>

However, there have been some problems, bugs and glitches found in
the system.  Harold Kunz is the trustee who oversees the Fraternal
Order of Police safety committee.  He has said that he has received
numerous complaints from members of his union about the new system
and has asked Chicago to delay putting more districts on-line until
the problems can be fixed.  Kunz said, "The physical plant is
beautiful.  The theory behind it is good.  Their ability to put it
to practical use is something else.  I think that the department is
more worried about getting this city up and running by the time of
the Democratic National Convention, so that it's a showpiece more than
anything else."
<P>

The problems and the complaints come as no surprise to the people
implementing the system.  Some problems have to be expected when
installing a brand new computer system.  In reality, no comparison,
but in the past week -- the Emergency Response and Research Institute
had significantly upgraded its computer system that allows "real time"
internet e-mail, along with other enhancements, and we encountered
a few glitches and computer bugs.  This is to be expected.  But in
Chicago, the example comparison can be made that the experience is 
like going from a typewriter to a personal computer.  What may complicate
the situation, a little bit, is that police officers are generally
suspicious by nature and are historically slow to embrace change or
something new.
<P>

Admittingly, some of the snafus that have been encountered with the
new 911 system have had the potential to be deadly.  Just three days
after the new center went on-line, on September 26th, a glitch in the 
telephone system caused the entire system and its backup ... to crash.  
That happened on a Friday evening, at the busiest shift time of day for 
the police department.  For two-and-a-half hours, residents in the 16th 
and 17th Police Districts, on Chicago's far Northwest Side got nothing but 
silence if they called 911.  One police communications supervisor said, 
"If you tried to call 911 during that time, you got nobody."  Supervisors 
in the 16th and 17th districts ordered their squad cars to put their
flashing lights on and drive slowly through neighborhoods to help
residents contact authorities should they need help.
<P> 

Some officers were very upset over that incident.  Some say that
there has been some repetitive problems, such as constant busy signals
for callers of 911.  Many officers say that the city is moving too
quickly on the project.  One officer from the 17th Police District
said, "Some of this stuff should have been worked out before they
started using us as guinea pigs."
<P>

Another major complaint of patrol officers is that they are being
dispatched in what they call a "willy-nilly" fashion.  Many times
they are being dispatched to an incident from the opposite end of
their district and even on some occassions -- outside of their
district boundaries.  Officials at the new 911 center said that this
is happening because there was some inaccurate geographic information
programmed into the computer software.
<P>

The project coordinator for the new system, William Corbett, said
that the problems encountered have been minor and would be rectified
in the coming months.  Corbett said, "There has to be tolerance.  We
have the next generation.  Every part of it is evolutionary ... we
don't progress day-by-day.  We get better by the hour."  Corbett said
that it would probably take a good six months to iron out some of the
bugs.  Again, according to some experts, that is to be expected.  However,
these same experts wonder if the city has the right type of people who
will be able to understand the new system and be able to work it.
Answers to questions about proper training on this new "evolutionary"
system have not been totally answered.
<P>  

There have been a number of documented problems with the new system,
but the city has refused to furnish a detailed list of them.  One
bad incident happened on October 23rd at 1130 CDT in the 4200
block of North Keeler Avenue in the 17th Police District -- a man
witnessed a burglar kicking in the front door of a neighbor's house.
The witness attempted to contact the police by calling 911.  He could
not get through after repeated attempts.  The witness, a retiree, was
able to contact the police by directly calling the 17th District
police station.  Officers, there, tried to call 911 but could not get
through.  By the time the police were notified, the burglar was long gone.
<P>  
  
Corbett replied to being questioned about that incident as knowing
nothing about it, but would look into it.  He reiterated that most
of the problems have been minor and not life-threatening.  He said
that the dispatchers at the new 911 center are answering phone calls
faster than at the old communications center.  He said that during
the month of October, the new center answered 90 percent of the phone
calls to 911 in 12 seconds or less.  That is compared to a percentage
of 50 to 60 percent at the old center.
<P>

Currently, there are 61 retired police officers who are forming what 
is called the "core cadre" of civilian dispatchers at the new center
on Madison Street.  One of these retired officers firmly believes in
the new system that he described as "the most comprehensive and
quickest in the world."  It was this dispatcher's experience that the
problems so far encountered have not been severe.  Luis Frazer said,
"If there was nay way that it jeopardized any police officer or the
public, the dispatchers would be the first to say, 'This don't work,
and we should get out of it and go back to the old system.'  It's sure
as hell going to be better than what we have now."
<P>

That is true.  Chicago needs this new emergency communications system.
Something is needed at the coming of the 21st century.  The core of
the Chicago Fire Department's communication system is almost 100 years
old.  It still works ... but things will be better.
<P>

Chicago's Police Superintendent, Matt Rodriguez, says that he is 
appraised of the complaints and problems.  He has instructed the
supervisors at the old communications center to watch out for any
problems that may be encountered.  But Rodriguez said, and rightfully so,
that the new communications center is vital to the safety of city.
He said, "Nothing is ever perfect.  But we do the best we can, especially
when it comes to safety."
